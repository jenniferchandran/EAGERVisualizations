Comments
A comment on commenting. I appreciate a good comment as much as the next thru hiker and look forward to hearing from family, friends, and even strangers. However, I've noticed that some commentors can't help but make inappropriate or unnecessary comments. To alleviate this problem I've decided to turn off the guest book feature for this journal.  Instead, I prefer that all comments be sent to the email address listed below.
I will try my best to respond to emails but I won't make promises. I have two things working against me which makes replying a bit difficult. First, I will be using my phone as my computer and I hate typing on my phone. Second, I won't always have a signal and I'll need to ration my phone time to preserve battery life.
Thank you for understanding and I look forward to hearing from those following my journey.

Bob Weaver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665063,"Happy Thru Hike Eve!
If you're reading this it means my AT thru hike is no longer something gnawing at my entire being.  In just a few short hours I'll be taking my first northbound steps on what I hope to be a journey of a lifetime.   As I contemplate my journey I feel much the same as I did the first time I went skydiving:  Anticipation and excitement mixed with a little trepidation.  
First, a thought (I know, dangerous territory).  This is mostly directed towards the Appalachian Trail (AT) aficionados and through hiking experts both actual and self-proclaimed:  I will often provide information that,  to those “in the know”, will believe unnecessary, irrelevant, or meaningless.  Sorry.  Believe it or not, there are actually people in the world who have zero or less knowledge of the Appalachian Trail and/or through hiking and all that it entails.  I remember when I first discovered online trail journals and read my first book about the AT.  How fascinated I was with all the myriad facts about the trail and the through hiking culture and community. The names of places, traditions, trail conditions, jargon, equipment, weather, culture, and, well, you get the point.  There’s a lot to feast on. Fast forward a few years and I would sometimes find myself yawning thinking the author was treating me like the village idiot with all this pointless recitation of facts about the trail that everyone must by now know for fact the same as they know 2+2=4 (except in Common Core math).  Then the epiphany came!  I had this random thought that while this may be the bazillionth hiking account I’ve read, there is some family member, friend, or random person reading about the trail for the first time, and how they must be experiencing the same fascination with their new-found experience as I.   Perhaps the seed of someday hiking the trail is now being planted in their being.
Without further ado...
Intro 
(Every journey, every story must have a beginning)
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step (Lao Tzu)
So, does that mean a journey of nearly 2200 miles begins with 2.1 steps?  Speaking of steps, I’ve read and heard on several trail accounts that it takes about 5 million steps to hike the Appalachian Trail (AT).  I’m (well, Garmin, actually) going to count them to see if that’s true.
It’s hard to believe that something I’ve dreamed of for almost 50 years is about to actually happen.  Each day brings an exponentially higher level of excitement and anticipation as my start date draws nearer.  Way back in high school I read an article about the Appalachian Trail. The tidbit of information that got lodged somewhere deeply in the gray matter was that a person could walk, mostly in the woods, over mountains, from Georgia to Maine.  I’m still trying to wrap my head around that.  First, that there’s that much continuous woods and mountains that haven’t been turned into golf courses, housing developments, or shopping malls, and second, that seems like a long way to walk.  While not on the magnitude of Lewis and Clark, Magellan, the Vikings and other great explorers, this still seems like a big adventure.  
When I mention that I'm going to hike the Appalachian trail I'm met with a mix of reactions, mostly positive and encouraging. There is the occasional, “That’s not for me” or “Say what? Why would you want to do that?” ""The whole thing?"" To, that's so cool!  I wish I could do that! Followed by a string of questions.  
At this point in time the hike is in the early attempt stage; with a very strong emphasis on “attempt”.  The reality of the situation is strong in my mind that only about 25% of people who set out on this journey actually complete the trail. Let that sink in.  Only one in four people who begin the hike, finish the hike.  Lest you think that really, not that many people would try to do this thing, think again.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) estimates that over 4,000 people attempt the trail each year.  Those are the hikers the ATC knows about.  I’m sure there are many more who don’t register their hikes with the ATC. 
Considering that statistic:
In our feel-good world where everybody should always have the highest level of self-esteem, finish in first place, and graduate without having to work for anything, our school systems would be twisted in knots over such a statistic.  The trail wouldn’t be fully accredited.  We would commission blue ribbon panels to study the cause of the low completion rate. There would be no hiker left behind. Hiker remediation and re-hiking initiatives would be put in place until all hikers accomplished their attempted through hikes.  If that approach didn’t prove successful they would begin leveling off the mountain tops and paving the trail.  If the success rate still wasn’t high enough they would provide shuttles from Springer to Katahdin complete with a resource hiker to offer encouragement,  cook meals, set up camp and read bedtime stories and sing lullabies.  If you, dear reader, think that was so much hyperbole, then you haven’t been a part of the American Educational Industrial Complex.  Sorry for the Bob moment.  Back to the main event…
The Southern Terminus of the AT is an arch on Springer Mountain in Georgia.  Most through hikers begin their hikes there hiking north to Mount Katahdin in Maine.  These northbound hikers are known in trail parlance as NOBOs.  There are three ways to get to Springer: Drive, hike, or skydive (actually happened).  Most hikers don’t have the resources to skydive and driving isn’t the easy alternative it seems so that leaves hiking as the more frequently used alternative.  Hiking happens on the approach trail.  The approach trail begins near the visitor center in Amicalola Falls State Park and is not part of the actual Appalachian Trail.  That means it doesn’t count.  You read that right and understand correctly.  The beginning of the hike to begin the hike doesn’t figure into the five million steps.  It’s just another walk in the woods. Bonus miles.  The warmup.  But it’s not just any ol’ walk in the woods.  Nope.  The approach trail is an arduous, nearly nine mile long climb, including steps (yes, actual man-made steps.  As in stairs. About 600 of them.)  Sadly, some hikers have abandoned their through hiking dreams on the approach trail.  I was listening to a podcast recently where this was indeed the case.  The person said it was so much harder than they imagined.  Hmmm…really?.  Not sure what they expected.
In four to six months of hiking mountainous terrain a lot can happen to derail the journey.  Heck, in normal life a lot can go wrong in four to six months (or minutes, even).  So, yes, attempt.  Attempting everyday until hopefully I beat the odds and am sitting on the side of the teeter-totter that is up in the air. (With the requisite, OSHA and other government agency approved safety devices, of course.)
Though not an expert on through hiking or the entire trail tread of the AT, I’ve been on the AT and in the mountains enough to know that the trail is not the idyllic path imagined by many.  This trail was not imagined, planned, or created by Disney.  Sure, there are stretches of well-groomed, nearly level, rock-free trail tread or fire road but those miles are few and far between.  The actual trail, for the most part, either goes up or down, sometimes very steeply, sometimes gradually and seemingly forever, over an obstacle course of roots, rocks, and streams with each step potentially being the end of the through hiking dream.  It’s a well-documented fact that the rocks in Pennsylvania are particularly evil. And then there’s the no-joke mountains in New Hampshire and Maine.  As in most games of chance, the odds are in the favor of the house and the house usually wins.
So, back to peoples’ reactions and questions.  I’ll give my current responses while reserving the right to change my answer when reality merges with speculation and the real answer becomes available.
Some of the most frequent statements and questions are: “That’s awesome! or Why would you want to do that? How long is the trail? Are you going to do the whole thing?  Are you going alone? How long will it take you?  Aren’t you scared?  Are you going to carry a gun?  What about food?  Where will you sleep?  What if something happens to you?  What if you get lost? What about bears? What if it rains? Will you have cell service?  Are you going to blog/vlog/keep a journal? Where are you starting?  What will you do while you’re out there?”
All fair questions and to be honest, as I researched the trail and planned for my hike, many of these same questions were in my mind.  Based on all the trail journals, books, YouTube videos, and podcasts out there, these are the same questions posed to almost all through hikers.  And remembering that the only dumb question is the question you didn't ask, nobody should apologize for their questions.  Most of the “fear-type” questions come from those who haven’t spent much time alone in the outdoors, or alone period, and can’t imagine themselves living the through hiker life.  Or they watch too many movies where bad things have to happen so people will watch the movie.  Like really, how riveting is a movie where a kid is babysitting while watching a Disney movie, the power stays on, the weather is perfect, the children all behave, there is no conflict or controversy, the parents return home on time, and the babysitter makes it back home all safe and sound?  It’s much better when there’s a serial killer on the prowl during a thunderstorm when the power suddenly goes out...
When asked “Why would you want to do that?,” my first thought is, “Why wouldn’t I want to do this?” I would rather be outdoors than indoors. I’m not good at sitting around or sitting still. I like physical and mental challenges. I love hiking and camping.  And I just can’t get the trail off my mind.  There are shopping people, TV people, sports junkies, beach people, woodworking people, car people, etc.  I’m a pretty much anything outdoors person and I love being in the mountains.
My vision of hiking the trail has always been, wake up, pack up, start walking, stop to rest, walk, stop to eat, walk some more and keep repeating that cycle until I’m tired.  Sleep.  Every few days, make my way into a town to get more food, get back on the trail and do it all again.  My research has shown that many people take this approach.  Others group up and form trail families (tramilies).  Some stop at just about every hostel or town for a break from the trail (Taking a zero - hiking zero miles that day or a nero - limited miles due to time in the town.)  What will I actually do?  It depends.  Depends on how I feel at any given time.  I’m purposely trying to avoid specificity in planning my hike.  I haven't set a goal of daily miles (although, based on experience, I have an idea), actual hiking speed, where I’m going to be when because I simply have no control of outside factors.  Many people spend hours fretting over all these little details creating spreadsheets of mileage charts and where they’re going to sleep, resupply and so on.  Then, all that goes out the window when faced with the reality of the trail.  Like Mike Tyson says, “Everybody has a plan ‘til they get punched in the mouth.”  I’ve read thru hiker journal entries and watched YouTube videos where prospective hikers lay out their plans.  I shake my head in amazement when I see the level of detail some put into planning their hike. Some of these hikers didn’t even make it through the first week and most didn’t finish the trail. Their journals usually end abruptly leaving you hanging, like when you find a paperback with a great story line only to find somebody tore the last chapter out of the book.  Pro-tip; if you’re going to read trail journals, find journals written by people who finished the trail.  Unless you like a good cliffhanger or you’re reading my journal.
When will I start?  June 15.  I chose that date a few years ago and stuck with it.  It's the most specific plan of my entire hike.  Didn't even need a spreadsheet to figure it out.  I’ll be making my journal entries by hiking day (Day 1, Day 2, and so on) and post when I’m in a good Internet spot and have time to struggle with using my phone like a computer.
Where will I start?  Much as I'd like to start at Springer, I’ve opted to doing a flip-flop hike out of convenience.  A what?I?! A flip-flop hike is another type of through hike.  So NOBOs are hikers heading north from Springer, SOBOs are southbound hikers who began at Katahdin and flip-floppers (they don’t have a cool acronym for us) are the people who, for a variety of reasons start somewhere in the middle, head some direction, turn around and head the other direction and work it out so they still hike the whole trail. Some flip-flops are straight forward like mine.  Others involve jumping all around the trail. I’m starting at Rockfish Gap heading north.  Once I summit Katahdin I'll make my way back to Rockfish Gap and go southbound to Springer.  Why Rockfish Gap?  Logistically, it’s my closest access to the AT and I have a friend who jumped at the chance to drive me there.  That being said, there’s still the logistics of getting from Katahdin back to Rockfish and from Springer back home.  I have a plan.  But first, I need to get to Baxter State Park before worrying about how I’m going to execute the flip. Or is it flop. All a matter of perspective, I suppose.
Gun?  No.  Not practical for a lot of reasons.  Not really even necessary.  There are legal considerations, weight, maintenance, security, safety, and convenience. If you’re curious about this topic, the Internet is full of articles and discussions. All I can imagine is being confronted by a person or bear intending to do me harm and I have to ask for a timeout while I rummage through my pack to find my gun.  Open carry? I’m sure that would freak most people out resulting in frequent encounters with the  local constabulary. So, no gun.
How long will it take me to do the trail?  That’s an unknown. My best guess is 4 1/2 to 5 months.  Most people take around 6 months. Some hikers try to do the trail in 100 days as a challenge.  Others hike it in sections (a LASH aka Long @$$ Section Hiker) over several years or just take their sweet time and finish when they finish. The fastest time for an unsupported hike is 45 days.  That’s an average of nearly 50 miles per day. I also recently listened to an interview where the guy hiked the trail in sections and it took him like 25 years. I figure to hike between 15 and 20 miles per day which should be a reasonable pace while hiking 8 to 12 hours per day.  (For all you mathematicians out there that figured out the miles per hour and thought, Wow!, he's walking slow, remember, these are backpacking miles on uneven terrain.  A huge contrast to a stroll through your neighborhood or the mall unencumbered by a backpack.)
What am I going to eat?  High calorie food of questionable nutritional value. Hikers burn about 4000 calories a day.  After a few weeks they develop a condition known as “hiker hunger” where they are perpetually hungry and will eat gargantuan quantities of just about anything they deem edible.  There are specialty dehydrated meals that can be purchased (at five star dining establishment prices) or a lot of hikers buy Knorr’s sides, packaged meats, ramen noodles and other such calorically dense, lightweight foods.  Then there’s honey buns, cookies, Snickers bars, Clif Bars, and other foods similarly high in calories. Jennifer Pharr-Davis, former AT FKT holder, had problems with her portable stove and ditched it in favor of eating Pop-Tarts while completing her first through hike.  All hikers look forward to supplementing their food intake with town meals whenever they get the chance.  Water is readily available all along the trail during most of the year.  Some hikers swear it’s OK to drink the water straight out of a spring or mountain stream while most other hikers, including yours truly, filter their water. (Giardia while trying to hike does not sound fun.)  While doing trail runs this is how I refilled my hydration bladder during my long runs.
Am I going alone along with aren’t you scared?  What if something happens to you?  First, going alone.  There are a lot of people on the trail at any given time.  That makes it sound like a New York City street.  No, all those people are spread out over a couple thousand miles, concentrated usually around trailheads.  I simply prefer going alone.  I'm sure at different times I'll be hiking with others but that's not something I'm actively pursuing.  Through the years I’ve found only a couple of people I don’t mind doing long runs or long bike rides with.  I know my capabilities and it’s frustrating to plan on a four to six hour run or ride only to have it cut short because the other person is having issues.  If I’m by myself and have to bail.  No big deal.  If I’m feeling really strong I don’t have to worry about leaving somebody behind. I’m used to being my own playmate because most people don’t get the same sense of satisfaction out of spending all day running or biking that I do. If there’s a real emergency, I have a satellite communicator with an SOS button.  I’ve been hiking and camping alone many times in my life and was never scared or bored.  I’m looking at this as a long series of day hikes. 
What about bears?  I’ve run across bears in Shenandoah National Park and they have always been more afraid of me than I am of them.  I give them their space and watch them wander off to do their bear thing.  Sure, there might be that one but statistically, I’m more worried about the people driving while messing with their phones than I am a bear.  That being said, aggressive bear behavior has been on the increase since COVID.  I attribute that to all the (expletive deleted) who suddenly became nature lovers and leave their trash all over the place thinking the rangers or trail crews will clean up behind them much the same as their moms must clean their rooms for them.  And Disney has made them believe they are doing a good deed when they feed the cute, furry little creatures who are so unfortunate as to have to live out their existence in the deep, dark forest.  Look at the  proliferation of idiots who have been making the news lately for doing stupid things in our National Parks just for that selfie or some dumb Tik-Tok or Instagram video.
Snakes?  I’m more worried about them than bears.  Especially copperheads and timber rattlers.   Rattlers usually warn you with their rattle that you’re too close. I give them all the space they want and then some. Copperheads are a little more worrisome because they blend in to their surroundings so well and don’t warn you of their presence.  I’ve almost stepped on them a few times in my travels which gave me quite a fright.   
Growing up I developed a mindset/strategy that has served me well in life.  I think this started creeping into my being while I was a swimmer trying to survive some pretty tough workouts. When I joined the Army after high school the fear mongers told me that Basic Training was so hard that I probably wouldn’t make it.  News flash, it wasn’t that hard. Because I had a secret mental weapon:  One day at a time.  One thing at a time. Go to sleep.  Wake up. Do it again.  Don’t dwell on the negative. Focus on the positive.  There’s always a positive.  Sometimes it’s hard to find but it’s there if you look hard enough.  Make the most out of each situation.  Don’t whine or complain that life or your situation is not fair. Just play the hand you’re dealt. Don’t quit, regroup.  I don’t know how I figured all that out but it has gotten me through a lot of challenging situations over the years. I’m confident that this mindset will get me through the trail. So, why?  When I was 16 or 17 I  thought the idea of hiking from Georgia to Maine sounded like a cool idea and 50 years later, it seems like an even cooler idea.  Do I have what it takes?  Only one way to find out.  What better way to transition from the work life to retirement life?
So, if you’re reading this, I’m already out on the trail somewhere.  While I’ll do my best to update my journal each day, I’ll only post updates about once per week.  If you wish to contact me (comments will be highly appreciated) please email me at this address: bobshike2023@gmail.com  i can’t promise I’ll respond to all emails but I’ll try.

Day 1
Rockfish Gap to Turk Gap 
12.1 AT miles
Hard to believe the big day was finally here. My friend Paxton, from school, picked me up at 730 in the morning, and we headed towards Rockfish Gap, the Southern end of Shenandoah Nat'l Park.  We had a great conversation on the way as Paxton is a guru on geology and rocks, and is always fun to talk to. We made my traditional stop at the Xion Crossing Sheetz to get some breakfast and head back out on the road. We arrived at Rockfish Gap around 9:45.  There we met up with my good friend Shigley who's going to do the first 3 days of the trail with me. We took some pictures and said our thank yous and goodbyes to Paxton.  Then we were off on the beginning of my great adventure. It was a beautiful, sunny day with Temps around 67°. Big billowy clouds filled the sky as we began the Weaver and Shigley reunion tour. We spent several years running most of the 500+ miles of trails in the park, often talking about hiking the AT.  We haven't been able  to get together for a run in 2 years so we were both excited to get on the trail again.
The plan was day 1 hike with a day pack, day 2 hike with backpack minus food, and day 3 begin hiking fully loaded.  I'd spent most of the past 2 years getting out of shape so this seemed a sensible approach to me.  Shigley was going to hike the first 5 or 6 miles each day the run back to his car and meet me at whatever gap I planned to end the day at.
Shortly after entering the Shenandoah National Park, we stopped and registered for our back country permit.   Now it's official.
We saw a lot of flowers, and our first wildlife encounter was a big black snake, which we had to stop and admire. During the course of the day. We saw 5 other North bound hikers and a few day hikers. Yeah, I talked about the 5 mile mark. We quickly hit the 5 mile mark and Shigley turned around to run back to his car.  He was going to drive and meet me at the Turk Gap parking lot. So, the next part of the hike was me by myself which was really pleasant. I saw 4 deer, one of which was totally unconcerned with my presence.  His brother was looking at him like, why aren't you running?  Of course, there were also all the other usual outdoor creatures, except for bears. The spring I had planned on getting more water at was nothing more than mud and damp rocks and I was running a low on water but hoping to make Turk Gap before I was miserable. Shigley arrived at Turk Gap just before I arrived and greeted me with an ice cold Gatorade.  We decided to go to the Loft Mountain. wayside to buy some water.  Once we got to the wayside, we bought our water.  The snack bar smelled so good we decided to rough it by eating hamburgers in the snack bar.
By this time it was getting late and we still had to drive back to Turk Gap and find a place to camp.  We decided to continue roughing it by getting a campsite at Loft Mtn campground.  I used my lifetime National Park Pass to get us a $15 campsite. We set up camp, drank a nice cold brew and were in bed by nine o'clock. Not a bad first day.
Day 2
Turk Gap to Brown's Gap
11.9 AT Miles
Day 2 to took us from Turkey. Gap to Brown's gap. Got kind of a late start. It was really cold in the morning.
Day 3
18.3 AT miles
20.4 mikes total
Brown's Gap to Hhightop Hut.  Just hiking.  Highlight of the day was seeing a ruffled Grouse for the first time ever.  
I didn't plan to hike this far. Originally plan was 13 to 15 miles camping just after Powell Gap.  The next section of trail was a path midway up (or down) the mountain with a field of stinging nettles on either side.  No choice but to keep moving forward.  I finally decided the best alternative was to push on to Hightop Hut and Spring.  No worse for the wear I set up camp, cooked s dinner of creamy chicken and noodles with olive oil and chicken breast. Fig bars for desert.  Cleaned myself off a bit and was in bed at 8.
Day 4
Hightop Hut to Steslth site mile 925.1 
AT miles 18.6
Miles hiked 22.6
Slept great last night.  Filtered water from the spring and headed out.  Another nice day.  Stopped for water at South River Picnic Grounds.  All faucets were turned off.  Really?  Ran out of water.  Was able to get water at Pocosin Spring.  Really nice spot so took a break and ate lunch.  Back on the trail and thought a lot about what I could ditch from my pack.  Food and water would lighten the load the most. Bad choice.
Stopped at Lewis Mtn Camp Store for snack and to charge phone and call dad.  Found out I already lost my fast charger.  Bought a not so great charger for $8.  Text people. No answer when I called dad. Will try again tomorrow at Big Meadow.  
Another long stretch with no water. Hoped to find a stealth camp site near a stream near Big Meadow. Nope.  Ended up making my own stealth site.  Met YouTuber Sugar Bear who was also looking for a stealth site. He's doing the trail in long section hikes and documents his hikes on YouTube.  Set up camp the moved a ways down trail to fix dinner. While waiting for my water to boil another hiker, Crossroad,  stopped to chat.  She was trying to make Big Meadow campground but didn't think she could make it by dark and the batteries were dead in her headlamp so I gave her my extras and she was on her way.  I ate 2 Knorrs sides with chicken breast.  Didn't want to wait til the noodles were soft so crunched through them and went to bed.  Not 5 minutes after I layed down my air mattress deflated.  Too tired to mess with it I rolled over and slept like a rock.

Day 5
Stealth site at mile 925.1 to Byrds Nest Shelter #3
AT miles 16.1
Miles hiked 28.4
Despite the flat air mattress I slept great and woke up ready to get going. The plan was to stop at Big Meadow for breakfast, buy more snacks, recharge my phone and head out.  I intended to only hike about 15 miles depending on places to camp and water availability. 
The first thing I saw when I crawled out of my tent was a deer munching on leaves.  I started packing up only to have the call of nature screaming at me. GO NOW! So off to find a good spot to, well, you know.  Yeah, TMI, but there is somebody who's wondering…
A short jaunt up the trail and I was at Big Meadow Wayside looking for some biscuits and gravy.  I even talked them into scrambling a couple of eggs for me.
The weather was again awesome as I made my way to Rock Spring Hut for water and lunch.  Just as I finished packing up it started raining so I had a 30 minute or so hike in the rain.  About 5:00 I ran into another hiker who was headed to the same campsite as I.  About 5:45 the skies opened up and we were smacked by a big storm.  He left me in the mud climbing the hill. (All these hikers who started in Georgia and have 900+ miles under their feet tend to float up hills.)  I made it to Pinnacles Picnic Area frozen and wet.  I got under the shelter and put on a dry shirt and rain coat and decided to cook dinner whlie i waited out the storm.
I headed out for camp with about 4 miles to get to camp.  The wind was howling and the rain was coming in waves.  I got to the campsite at 8:35 with barely enough light to set up camp.  The rain was pounding but somehow I got the tent set up, waterproof bag in the tent with me right behind. I got my wet stuff off, dried off best I could and used foot powder to finish the job.  GOOD NEWS! My air mattress stayed inflated. It went flat because somebody didn't put the cap on the inflation valve.  I tried calling dad but the phone reception was bad so I'll have to try again the next time I have a cell signal.
I turned off my phone and crawled under my quilt only to have water drip in my eye. The rain was blowing so hard it was coming in the tent vent. I tried blocking it with my waterproof bag with marginal results. I ended up with my wet raincoat over my head and passed out. Thank goodness I didn't need to use the bathroom after I went to sleep. The rain didn't let up the entire night.
Day 6
Byrd's Nest Shelter $3 to Gravel Spring Hut 
AT Mile's 15.4
Total miles hiked 17.1
Woke up to a windy, cold, rainy morning.  The thought briefly crossed my mind to continue sleeping but reality dictated that the only way to get up the trail was to get up and get hiking.  I put on  my driest wet socks and driest wet underwear along with the rest of my still wet other clothes and began breaking camp. It went quickly although the wind helped make sure that any part of the tent that managed to stay dry last night got soaked while trying to get it stowed.  
The spring was close by. Only a .3 mile walk down a slightly steep hill.  Great warm up for the day.  While walking down to the spring, lost in thought on how I was going to get stuff dry enough to sleep that night, an explosion erupted from the underbrush right near my feet making me nearly jump out of my skin.  It seems I startled a Grouse who was probably off in its own little grouse world before a human startled it.  Got my water and filtered it then trudged another .3 miles back up to my pack to begin hiking.  The wind and rain were still nasty but to make things more fun and more wet there were all kinds of weeds and bushes leaning over the trail.  After a bit I stopped for a snack and a drink when  the hiker I hiked with yesterday caught up to me.  We then hiked to my favorite restroom facility in SNP: Panorama.  There are basically 4 big bathrooms connected under an awning.  They have heated hand dryers and electric outlets. We spent about an hour there drying our socks and drawers, charging phones, and eating a snack.  Somewhat refreshed we headed back out to rehydrate out clothes.  About midday the rain let up and although it was windy it warmed up a bit and seemed like it would be an alright day.  My hiking buddy soon left me going up a hill with plans to stop at Gravel Springs hut.
I hit Elk Wallow Wayside just as the sun came out.  The ranger was giving a lecture on bears which was pretty interesting so I set my stuff out to dry and ate some lunch. 
After my tent and quilt were dry I started for camp.  About 2 miles before camp it started spitting rain. Not wanting to deal with a repeat of the previous night, I ran most of the last 2 miles to camp. No rain yet, set up then took my food down to the shelter to cook dinner and talk with the other hikers.  Surprisinhly, they were all clearing out of the shelter to set up tents.  It took less than a minute to figure out why - there was something big trapped under the floor and you could hear it trying to get out. Yikes!
So, quick dinner, some stories from the trail, then bedtime around 8:30.
Day 7
Gravel Spings Hut to Mountain Home B&B
AT Miles 13.8
Miles hiked 14.6
Today turned out shorter than planned.  It was pretty cold last night and seemed like it took forever to get warm.  Once I finally got warm I was reluctant to crawl out of the tent in the morning.  No rain last night but a lot of wind. Finally popped the valve on the air mattress and had no choice but to get moving.  The plan was to hike to Highway 522 where there was a trolley stop into Front Royal.  I was going to hop into town, go to the local outfitters where they had a shower and laundry service.  While waiting for laundry I would eat lunch, resupply my food, pack back ip, and head up the trail a few more miles where there was another shelter.  Not an hour into the hike the wind picked up a notch and it started pouring.  Change of plans.  I started frequently checking my phone for service and finally had a hint of 4G.  I called Mountain Home B&B which has a cabin for hikers.  I was fortunate enough to get through to Lisa, one of the owners, and reserve the last bed in the cabin, before losing signal.  Fingers crossed that she got all my info.  Six hours more of hiking in the rain and I was there.  Scott, the other owner, thru hiked the trail in 2014 and is a strong supporter of hikers and was a driving force in Front Royal becoming an ATC recognized AT Trail town.  They provide loaner clothes to hikers while they do laundry. I still had a dry pair of shorts so I chose a red polo shirt and was ready to go to town for my resupply.  Scott drove 3 of us into town.  Our first stop was the outfitters so one of the hikers could buy new shoes.  I bought a long sleeve shirt to help stay warm.  This late October weather looks to be around for several more days and I had packed for summertime. After the outfitters we walked to Martin's for trail food. Martin's also had a food buffet so we got dinner to go and called Scott to come get us.  After dinner I called Robin, Lynn and Phil, and dad and mom.  It was good to talk to them finally after a week on the trail. By the time I got off the phone everybody else in the cabin was in bed asleep.  (Hiker midnight is around 8 or 9.  Most hikers out here are out here to hike and aren't playing around.   There are those like me who have waited most of there lives for this opportunity and this may be their only shot at realizing their dream.  There are others who are way past being kids but who aren't retirement age who saved up enough money to do this and basically sold everything and hit the trail.  The rest are high school and college age kids practically racing the trail trying to finish before next school year or their new job starts in the fall.  Yeah, I suppose there is a party crowd but I haven't seen that.  One of the hikers at Gravel Spring said those hikers don't last and the ones you see now who started in Georgia who have made it this far aren't playing around.
I updated my journal and tried to remember how to get pics from my real camera to the Internet. It is a pain so I gave up. I updated my journal and could hardly keep my eyes open so I took a shower and passed out.
I need to figure out my Inreach in the morning.  Breakfast is scheduled for 830. I hope to wake up early and get that done.

Day 8
Mtn Hme B&B to Whiskey Hollow Shelter
AT miles 14.8
Miles hiked 15.2
Week number 2 begins. Woke up early-ish to the sound of rain on the roof of our cabin.  Gonna be another wet one.
Got started around 1045 after a good breakfast of scrambled eggs with cheese and veggies, homemade apple cider, and fresh fruit provided by the hostel owners.  Tuna Shorts and a couple from Holland along with Lisa, had a great breakfast conversation about travel and local history.
The wet trail was made wetter by all the vegetation hanging over the trail but mostly was smooth going. Around noon, the sun came out and I was thinking the rain was finally over. Nope. By 1 it was raining again. Met a guy from Ohio at a road crossing who was finishing the hike in memory of a friend who died during COVID.  They had started the hike back then but had to get off the trail  because of the pandemic with plans to finish the trail at a later time.
Nearly had my first fall today. Was crossing a creek on some rocks when my right foot slipped off a rock.  Just before doing the splits in the creek I somehow got my left foot around to prevent that but my right foot went full in the drink with a splash to equal a cannonball.  At least I stayed vertical.
Stopped for water at Manassas Gap shelter then continued on to Whiskey Gap shelter.  In case you're wondering, shelters or huts are basically sheds minus one wall.  Some are kinda not real great and others are pretty nice.  This was a pretty nice shelter. There were 7 of us who stopped for the night, all happy ro be out of the rain and somewhat dry.
Fixed a quick dinner of ramen, summer sausage, and cheese then went to bed before 8. 
Day 9
Whiskey Hollow Trail to Sam Moore Shelter
AT miles 15.5
Mile's hiked 15.8
Originally vowing to not sleep in a shelter, this shelter was a welcome relief after being so wet and cold. This shelter looked like somebody's vacation home, minus the front door. .  I woke in the middle of the night needing to go, if you get my drift.  It was dark as if I were in a cave.  I didn't want to wake the others so I rolled back over and tried to sleep.  
As I was packing, I noticed some gross sticky stuff got on the bottom of my sleeping pad. Yuck.  I packed up anyway deciding to clean it when I got to next camp.  As we were packing we were asking if there were any mice the night before (shelters are known for their mice which is why I prefer to not sleep in them.)  Everyone said no except for Squirrel.  Mice had gotten into his M&Ms.  One of the first rules of sleeping in a shelter is no food. At least his bad decision  probably kept the mice too busy to bother us.
Started out in the rain then things got fun.  The trail was overgrown with weeds, bushes and trees. So, not only was I getting wet from the rain, the vegetation was doing its part to make me even wetter. Sort of like walking through a car wash. Finally, the rain stopped around 1100 so I only had to deal with the wet brush.  
Stopped for lunch and water at the Rod Hollow Shelter. Made some chicken noodles soup and ate some chips.  Back on the trail and soon began the famous Virginia Roller Coaster.  The roller coaster is about a 14 mile section of rocky, steep uphill followed by similar downhills.  The downhills usually ended with a creek crossing a rocky trail.  At least the brush wasn't so bad.
My day ended at the Sam Moore Shelter. Merlin (the dog guy) and Wade (the dog), CT (Pennsylvania guy), and a lady (Saucy) I've not seen before were at the shelter when I arrived.  
There were a lot of nice tent sites so I set up the tent and cooked supper.  Tonight's fare was chicken and rice burritos with dark chocolate and peanuts for desert.
Some might be wondering, what's with these unusual names.  Well, wonder no more.  There is a hiking tradition where hikers have trail names.  Some hikers choose their own names out of fear they'll get a terrible or embarrassing name.  Thing is, you don't have to accept the name if you don't like it or you can change your name.  I decided to take my chances and let the trail (other hikers) name me.  Or, I'll just stick with Bob because hey, there's not many names cooler than Bob.
We sat around talking until about 8 when everybody got ready to sleep.
Day 10
Sam Moore Shelter to 4 Mile Campsite
AT miles 19.2
Miles hiked 22.2
Started raining again last night around midnight.   Been steady all night.  Woke about 5 hoping the sky would run out of water so I could pack up and get on the trail.  Hiking in the rain isn't bad (minus hiking in wet weeds) but packing in the rain is not so fun.  Oh well, here goes. Time to jump in the pool.
FINALLY! The rain stopped about 8 and the sun came out about 830. Turned into an awesome day for hiking.  Finished the roller coaster and was glad to be finished (for the time being) climbing on the wet rocks.  I stopped at a view but didn't get to see much because a cub scout troop was climbing on rocks and yelling and screaming while the adults stood around talking.  Couple that with the fat guy who had a big, high energy dog who was constantly barking and trying to get away from its ""owner"".  Moving on.  
A short time later I moved over to let a family pass by me.  The dad stepped off the trail motioning me by. As I got next to him he asked if I were a thru hiker.  He then offered some trail magic (2 Clif Bars!) and we had a brief conversation.  As we started to go our separate ways he wished me luck and  told me I was living his dream.   There were a lot of day hikers out today enjoying the nice weather for a change.  I stopped at the next view for a snack and a break. Three guys about my age and a younger guy asked if they could join me on the overlook.  We were all soon engaged in conversation and we found out we were all Hoosiers!  They were from Kokomo here for a reunion.  We talked about sports, boy scouts, and living in the 70s.  The younger guy said it sounds like he missed out on a good time to grow up. He did.
Back on the trail I soon needed water so waded through some black, mucky mud trying to keep my finally dry feet,  dry.  Wasn't easy but I managed.  As I was filtering water I was  joined by Shaman, a hiker from Czechoslavakia.  We too had a great conversation.
More hiking and I somehow missed the Virginia, West Virginia border sign.  My first state line! Yay!
I decided to eat lunch at a view at about 2.  It was sunny and I could lay some of my wet stuff out on the rocks to dry.  I peeked under the rock I was going to use looking for snakes.  Seeing none,  I dropped my pack and started digging stuff out. I then heard chhht. Hmmm… I glanced down and less than a foot away was a big, fat, timber rattler.  Holy Guacamole!  I stepped back, grabbed my back pack and beat a hasty retreat minus some of my gear.  The snake didn't seem mad yet so I carefully retrieved the rest of my stuff. Intent on eating my snack I gave Mr. Snake a wide berth and sat on his overlook to enjoy my snack while keeping an eye on him keeping an eye on me.  That seemed to be a good arrangement until I saw a second rattler under a  bush about 3 feet away. OK, outta here. Not that hungry.
As I was repacking and getting ready to move out, a hiker from Canada, High Speed, showed up at the view with the same plan as I – until I told him about the snakes. Of course, pics were in order then we both left.
I was feeling pretty strong today so planned to hike to a tent site about 5 miles from Harper's Ferry.  About 2 miles before the tent site is a crazy road crossing.  There was a gas station about a 10 minute walk down the road so I walked up to buy a Mountsin Dew, cheese curls and use an indoor, not stinky, bathroom. Ahhh!
About 4 miles up the trail I found my spot with 2 deer grazing nearby.  I set up camp, hung wet stuff out to dry, gave myself a sort of camp bath then  walked up the trail a bit, ate a quick  snack then got myself into bed.
Just as I was finishing my journal entry the nearby locals started shooting off fireworks.  I love the peaceful sounds of nature.Please email comments to:

Day 11
Sam Moore Shelter to Crampton Gap Campsite
AT Mile 14.2
Miles hiked 15.8
Harper's Ferry and ATC HQ Day!  For hikers starting at Springer, this is the psychological half-way point.  The Appalachian Trail Conservacy is also located here.  The ATC keeps a yearbook of thru hikers where they take photos of hikers and include some basic info such as as name, trail name, start date, and where you're from, and what number hiker you are registering.  I was flip-flop hiker 295. A NOBO told me his number was 925.  I think its too early for SOBOs to be passing through.
This is also one of four locations where hikers can earn their AT hang tags for their pack by attending a Leave No Trace class and passing a test.  Although this is something ingrained in me since my Boy Scout days, it struck me that every person desiring to enter a state or national park should have to take and pass this test.  Later on in the day I had similar thoughts about requiring cyclists to take a trail etiquette test before allowing them to ride on multi-use trails.
The ATC has a hiker lounge in the back where hikers can leave their packs and charge devices while in town. If you've never been to Harper's Ferry (HF) you should put that on your list of places to go. Especially if you're interested at all in American history. I've been to HF several times since I used to frequently bike pack the C&O Canal trail to WV and back or rent a canoe from River Riders.
I had four goals on this visit: get better shoes, get in the yearbook, get my hang tag, and eat in the caboose.
The folks running the ATC were fantastic and very helpful to hikers.  Next stop was the outfitters to see about shoes.  Every day after about two hours of hiking the bottoms of my feet started to ""burn"".  I've never had this problem before – even while wearing Uncle Sam's ""every foot is the same shape"", Army boots.  The shoes I was currently wearing were shoes of last resort.  I had a terrible time finding a shoe in my size that was suitable for hiking and that fit.  My number one choice, the Altra Lone Peak was sold out everywhere I looked.  The outfitters at HF had them in my size and they felt great. Not only that, they were at least $40 cheaper than anyplace else that sold them. Bonus! They donate used shoes to someplace that gives shoes to people in need.  I happily made my contribution.  With new shoes on my feet it was time to tackle that fourth goal.
 I always ate at this BBQ restaurant in a train caboose whenever I was in HF.  The restaurant is still there only now it's a pizza and sandwich place named Isabella's.  Sticking with tradition, that's where I ate. The steak and cheese was very good and the fries were awesome.  
Back UP to the ATC. Oh, there's the upper town and the lower town.  If you ever go there it won't take long to figure which is which and why. My charging  block still needed some more time so I relaxed in the hiker lounge listening to other hikers talk about their hikes.  I left at about 330 with 11 miles to go to my next camping spot.  
It was a good thing I filled both water bottles at the ATC.  It was a hot, humid hike with no water stops until the state park right before the camp site.  
On the way was Weverton cliffs. Spectacular views. Glad I didn't pass that side trail up.
I arrived at Gathland State Park right at dark, stopped in the bathroom to fill my bottles then had a heck of a time finding the trail in the dark.  Finally getting back on trail, it was a steep climb out of the park.  I finally got to the camp site.  I think I was the only person there. Set up in the dark and decided to skip dinner and instead start counting sheep (or deer, or bears, or…)
Sometime before the park I entered Maryland. My third state!
Wait, my feet.  If it's possible, my feet felt better after hiking 11 miles than at any other time in this hike. For the first time I set up camp without gingerly hobbling around like an old man.
Shortly after drifting off to sleep I was awakened by thunder and lightning. I let the flaps down on the tent right as the rain started.  It didn't last long so I  woke up long enough to roll the flaps back up. 

Day 12
Crampton Gap Camosite to Pine Knob Shelter
AT Miles 12.5
Miles hiked 15.0
Thankfully, last night's rain didn't amount to much so everything was dry.  I need water so I had to hike more than a half mile back down to that state park to get some water. I decided since I was there I may as well see the sights so I took my camera and water bladder and headed out.  Pretty fascinating history stuff there related to the Civil War.  Got my pics and water then headed back up the trail to grab the rest of my stuff.  
Today was a planned easy day, partly to help adjust to zero-drop shoes (the heel is not elevated) and also to rest my legs a bit.   The walking was mostly comfortable with few rocks and climbs.  Also, about 6 miles down the trail awaited a free shower at the Dahlgren camp site.  I arrived at Dahlgren about lunchtime so feasted on beefsticks, chips, and lemonade.  I cannot begin to describe how good the shower felt.  There was even warm water.  I also washed the clothes I was wearing and the amount of dirt I wrung out of them was incredible.
I topped off my water and set out for the original Washington Monument located in Washington State Park in Washington County Maryland. By the time I got there I was sweating buckets as the temp was 88.  I also felt a little sick.  I ate a protein bar and slugged back a liter of water and in about 10 minutes all systems were GO.  The monument was really neat. Impressive, though smoggy, views. I also saw a turkey who stuck around long enough for a photo op.
The next leg of my journey took me over I-70 on a pedestrian bridge.  I've seen the bridge many times while driving. It was surreal to actually be walking on the bridge.  As I neared my destination for the day the air turned cool and there was the rumble of thunder off in the distance.  I quickly set up my tent and got ready for the night/storm.  Dinner was creamy chicken noodles, chicken, mashed potatoes, and lemonade. After the last 2 days it really hit the spot. 
The storm seemed to have passed us by as the thunder receded in the distance and the sun came out. 
Finished my camp chores so going to see if I have s cell signal then go to bed.
Tomorrow, if all goes well, Pennsylvania, otherwise known in AT thru hiker circles as Rocksylvannia.

Day 13
Pine Knob Shelter to Cross Creek Campsite
AT miles 18.8
Miles hiked 20
My feet were now pain free.  The going was mostly easy until I got to Falcon Rock.  There's usually a story behind every named place and as I struggled up a steep climb there were soon big rock formations, one of which clearly resembled a falcon head.
My climbing discomfort was soon forgotten as I neared the top and saw a group of 6 to 8 year old kids playing in a stream.  They grow 'em tough around there.
Near the top of the climb was a big roar of thunder followed immediately by rain.  I had about .5 miles to a nearby shelter. I got there just as the sky opened up. A southbound hiker named Bulldog was napping in the shelter as I arrived. She got up and started asking questions about the trail up ahead when suddenly there was a group of Amish backpackers  who seemed to appear out of nowhere, standing in the shelter.  The head of the group sat and chatted with us while the girls started writing in journals and another male stood to the side and listened. Somewhat strange but pretty neat at the same time.
After about an hour the rain stopped and the sun came out so it was time to be on my way. I said my goodbyes and headed out.  Bulldog said to be careful on the rocks since they'll be wet.  Ok, thanks.  Little did i know. 
After walking downhill around 15 minutes I saw this unusual rock formation and thought, ""I feel like I've seen that before."" But that would be impossible because I've never been here before.  Or have I. Oops. Back up the trail I go. I passed the Amish girls and they looked at me kind of funny so I said I went the wrong way.  To which one responded. ""Oh no, now you have to climb back up this hill."" Yeah.  Then soon I passed the head Amish guy who said ""you liked it so much the first time you had to go back.""  That's right.  As shocking as it may seem, going the wrong way  happens to most thru hikers.  While emotionally I took solace in that faux pas, physically my legs were berating me telleing me I'd pay for this later.  What an understatement.
As I was hiking I went through a somewhat rocky section and dutifully heeded Bulldog's warning to be careful. I had no idea. 
Presently, I came to a section called 2 Mile Cliffs at the Maryland Pennsylvania border. There were some sketchy places with rocks and I thought, ""well. maybe this is what Bulldog was talking about."" Then there it was. A rock covered side of the mountain with occasional trees and no dirt.  Just rocks, rocks, and more rocks. The trail was a game of following random white  blazes through the rocks.  For awhile I was basically traversing the mountainside when the ""trail"" turned downhill. Good.  I'm headed down out of this mess.  Then there was a right turn followed by about a 20 foot traverse followed by another right and I was now headed back up. Soon, the trail made a left turn to put me at about the same level  as before the whatever this is turned downhill.  Guess the trail marking guy got lost or made a wrong turn.  
After what seemed like two eternities the madness finally ended and it was back to mostly normal hiking.
I finally made PenMar Park about 630. Almost three hours later than originally planned.  No resupply this day. The park was very nice. I made full use of the facilities then went over to the sunset viewing shelter to not watch the sunset but to watch the rain come in. After about 30 minutes I was able to head for the night's camping spot. I pitched my tent next to a creek, cooked the last meal I had with me and started trying to figure out how I would get into town the next day.
I slept like a rock.

Day 14
Cross Creek Campsite to Rocky Mtn Shelters
AT Miles 14.4
Miles hiked 15.0
Resupply and re-fit Day in Waynesboro, PA. 
The major goal for today was to get to a Wal-Mart to get more food and to find a way to reduce my pack weight.
I had a little more than 2 mile hike to the road into Waynesboro and the whole time I was trying to figure out a way into town followed by a way back onto the trail.  Hitching is a popular means for thru hikers but I wasn’t keen on that.  Banking on the popular adage, ""The trail provides,"" I hoped for the best. Soon enough I was at the trailhead parking lot where a guy driving a minivan asked if I were a thru hiker.  Yeaaah? Then he asked if I needed a ride into town.  Yes.  He said he just dropped off another hiker and was on his way back into town. To Wal-Mart it was.  He told me if it was his day off he'd wait around and take me to the post office and someplace to eat. Instead, he gave me his business card with his and his wife's cell numbers.  He called his wife and let her know I might be calling for a ride later. 
First things first, there was a donut trailer outside the store that I couldn't pass up. Then it was shopping time.  I got everything I needed and was soon spread out in front of the store packing things I didn't need on the trail to mail to Lynn, throwing away other stuff, and repackaging food so it took up less space.  All told I downsized 5 to 7 pounds. As I was sorting things out several people stopped to ask about my hike, wish me safe travels, and/or talk about their dream of someday hiking the AT.  One guy who passed by asked if I needed a ride back to the trail. I told him I needed to go to the post office first thinking that would be a deal breaker. He said ""No problem, I'll be about a half hour."" Sweet! I finished my chores and ran into Subway and bought a sub.  We threw my stuff in his truck and headed to the post office. I found out he fully retired in December and also that he had retired from the Army at Fort Lee three years after I retired from Fort Lee. Small world.
Back on the trail my pack was SO much more comfortable.  I planned to hike a couple miles to the next shelter to eat lunch before continuing on.  About a half mile from the shelter there was a trail maintainer working on clearing a blow down from the trail. I offered to help and we made short work of his project.  I told him of my lunch plans and he said that was where he was headed as well. When I got to the shelter, Coyote (South  African guy), Banana (Switzerland girl), abd Road Runner (Canada guy) were just finishing lunch. Coyote had just returned to the trail after spending a couple days touring D.C. He was pretty excited to share that experience. Then he showed me pics of the two Triumph Spitfires he was restoring as well as some knives he made in his blacksmith shop. Very interesting guy.
While we were talking, the trail guy showed up and says, ""I think I have something you may be interested in."" The he opened an insulated lunch box with some cold beers! Nice! So we all sat around and talked some more while drinking our welcome trail magic. Soon enough it was time to head back on the trail. Road Runner snapped a group pic, we bid Auggie farewell and thanked him profusely for his kindness. 
I still had a long walk ahead of me to the next shelter.  Part of the hike was through a pine forest. The first so far on the trip.  For the most part the trail was was going with only a couple of steep climbs and rocky sections.  I took a side trip up to Chimney Rock and the views were breathtaking.
I finally made it to camp about 8 and immediately sat down to finish off my sub.  There was a noisy bunch of what looked to be high school or college kids down by the tent sites. Saucy said they were some kind of outdoor adventure group. I mentioned that I had said hi to them a couple of days earlier and they all looked at me and not a single one spoke. I said I assumed they must have been foreign and didn't speak English. High Speed (from Canada) busted out laughing and said they were probably the whitest white kids from America.
After finishing my sandwich I put my food bag in the bear box and went down to set up my tent. By this time all the thru hikers were either in their tents or about to be in their tents.  I found a spot to set up, next to Forrest  and crawled into my tent by 845. Those Outdoor Adventure jerks were up til about midnight laughing and talking loudly and walking around with flashlights on shining them in tents.  More than once I stopped myself from going to the fearless leader and telling him to can it. 

Day 15
Rocky Mtn Shltrs to Birch Run Shltr
AT miles 13.0
Miles hiked 15.2
Karma.  Just after 7 AM some tree cutters fired up their chainsaws.  Hope that woke that noisy bunch of kids. 
This was a kind of a lazy day.  Feeling low on energy the plan was to hike to Caledonia State Park, use the facilities, borrow some electricity, and either update my journal or rest. Or both. I woke up in time to hike down to the 65 South BBQ place for some lunch.  When I got there several hikers were  already there including Forrest and Tuna Shorts.  This is where I met Proof, a hiker from NC.  He could eat more than any 2 people I know.  The food was great and we definitely got our money's worth.  As we headed back to the trail we could feel all that food jostling around in our stomachs.  Forrest was taking a slack day as he would soon be flying home to interview for a new job.  Tuna and I pushed on as we had 10 more miles to our stop for the night.
About 3 miles up the trail was an oasis in the middle of the forest.  Quary Gap shelter. The caretakers for this shelter went out of their ways to make this seem like a home away from home.  Including air freshener in the privy.  It was so nice and peaceful that we put our packs down and stopped for an afternoon siesta. Refreshed, we were back on the trail making great time when we came upon a PATC cabin where former thru hikers set up a multi day trail magic station. I had an apple and piece of apple pie.  We sat around listening to some of their hiking stories from the 90s then it was time to go.  They gave us an apple for later and we were gone. 
It seemed like we reached camp in no time at all.  Still full from lunch and the trail magic,  we ate a snack while talking to another hiker who had arrived before us, hung our food bags, and turned in for the night.
The whippoorwills were so loud it was hard to sleep.

Day 16
Birch Run Shltr to Alec Kennedy Shltr
AT miles 25.1
Miles hiked 26.2
Today Tuna and I got on the trail quick to make it to Pine Grove Furnace in time for breakfast.  Pine Grove Furnace is the home of the AT Museum and the Pine Grove General Store, home of the half gallon challenge.  The store is located just past the physical mid-point of the trail so somebody came up with the idea of celebrating by eating a half gallon of ice cream in a single setting.  The current record is just under 5 minutes.  Much as I like ice cream I decided to pass.  I've had a serious craving for French fries and Tuna has been craving bacon and eggs.  We made great time  and arrived while they were still serving breakfast.  The sandwiches were like homemade. After breakfast I toured the museum waiting for them to switch over to lunch so I could get some fries.  A small fry is 2 pounds of hand cut french fries and they were amazing. After eating I had to wait for my telemed appt.  My doctor renewed my prescription, told me to enjoy the trail, and call when I finished.  That was good news. 
Tuna left before me saying I'd catch him up the trail.  He had about an hour head start.  I left the store at 238 and beat feet down the trail.  I was averaging over 3 miles an hour trying to make the shelter before dark.  At 12 miles I ran into a hill so steep it may as well have been a wall of rocks.  By the time I reached the top it was starting to rain, getting dark and I was out of gas.  With still more than 2 miles to go I had no choice but to push on.  Then the fun really began.  The trail designers created an obstacle course through the rocks at the top of the mountain that seemingly took forever to negotiate and navigate.  Once I was through that I had right at 2 miles to go.  It got dark well before I reached camp.  At one point I thought I had arrived when I saw a campfire.  It turned out to be a dad and his son camping.  Onward. I finally reached camp at 935.  As i was coming up the hill to the dhelter i hear a wuiet voice ask, ""Hiker or bear?""  I wanted to say bear but i was nice since it was late so I whispered. ""Hiker.""
K yhen hesrd him say, ""you can go bsck to sleep."" Turnd out it wd z couplevfrom Tennessee.
There were 2 other campers there all sound asleep.   No dinner tonight. I found a place to pitch my tent and was buttoned up inside in no time.
Somehow I missed Tuna on the trail.  Not sure where I passed him.

The sounds of other hikers packing up woke me at about 6.  Therwere others camped there were all gone before I even had my tent down. Plan was to hike into Boiling Springs and get a good breakfast.  I was making pretty good time (I thought) when I heard voices behind me. I stepped off the trail and it was an Indian family out on a morning hike.  The dad hung back and started talking about hiking. Seems he had hiked all of Pennsylvania last year and as soon as his youngest daughter is in college he's heading out to hike the AT.  He was a very friendly guy and we had a great conversation for the hour we hiked together.  He recommended Cafe 101 for breakfast and it was fantastic.  The Spanish omelette took over half the plate and the home fries the other half and then some.
Boiling Springs is a real nice, outdoorsy type of town.  In the short  while I was there I saw cyclists, roadrunners, trail runners, hikers, and people fly fishing.  The ATC has an office there and I briefly chatted with the volunteer staffer about his thru hike in the 80s.
The hike this day had a different feel than any other day so far as the trail mostly went through fields, meadows and pastures.
My hike ended soon enough at Darlington shelter where some hikers I'd not seen before were staying.  I found a nice tent site away from the shelter and fixed dinner.  Shortly after, Coyote, Road Runner and Banana showed up. We talked while they ate then smelled rain in the air and it was time to get in the tent. It poured all night but luckily I stayed pretty dry in the tent.
Day 18
AT miles 10.9
Miles hiked 11.5
Today was Duncannon day.  On paper and the Far Out App it looked like an easy hike. My feet begged to differ.  Maybe if it hadn't been raining it would have been smoother hiking but dealing with rocky stretches of trail with slick rocks and roots and dealing with vegetation overhanging the trail made for some relatively slow hiking.
There was an amazing view with about 2 miles to go and sort of listening to the day hikers at the view I understood the trail was likely steep.  Yep. Steep.  With irregularly spaced rock steps going down about a mile was like doing deep, single leg squats for 20 to 35 minutes.  I couldn't contain my shout of joy as I took that last step onto the road into Duncannon.
I caught up with a hiker named Jose Rio, a member of the Warrior Expedition, a program designed for selected veterans as a type of therapy to help them work through whatever it is they are dealing with.  We stopped at 7-11 for a celebratory extra large soda as we made our way to Kind of Outdoorsy.  Kind of Outdoorsy caters to hikers with showers, loaner clothes, resupply needs, some gear, bunks, and a hiker lounge.  I can't describe how good that shower felt.  Their scale says I've lost almost 9 pounds so far.  I figured when I started I would lose 20 to 25 pounds since that's how much weight I've put on the past couple of years.  On the way.
While I was doing my laundry Tuna showed up.  He said I must have passed him when he went to a shelter to see if I was there.
While looking for a new pair of socks and enjoying the classic country music playing in the store the lady working there said there were tornado warnings for the area and thunderstorm warnings in the late evening.  I decided to rent a bunk and go to dinner.  I wanted to enjoy my recently clean, still dry clothes for at least a little while.
Tuna and I went to the iconic Doyle Hotel for dinner.  But first, i put my tent and footprint out to dry.  Tuna  ordered a steak that was at least a pound.  I had a more ""modest"" meal of fish and chips. Proof showed up later and after seeing Tuna's steak, he ordered the same.
After dinner I came back to Outdoorsy to sort out and repack my pack and update my journal.
Plan for tomorrow is to hit the breakfast place across the street on the way out of town and get back on the trail.  The famous rocks are coming soon.  Hope my feet are ready.

Day 19
AT miles 17.6
Miles hiked 18.8
The hostel was hot like a sauna so none of us really got great sleep.  Coyote, Banana, and a couple of other hikers were going to Hershey Park for the day. Roadrunner said he was hiking and I had planned on about 18 miles so we hiked together.  The miles flew by while we talked about how we each found the trail and comparing Canadian culture to American culture.  
The hike started off through Duncannon, crossing the Juniata and Susquehanna rivers.   Soon it was a steep climb out of town on a smooth trail.  No sooner than my comment about how nice the trail was came out of my mouth than we were faced with a steep, rocky trail. The rockiness continued for quite awhile but mostly hiking a ridgeline, it wasn’t too bad.  After a couple of hours we took a rest break at a powerline that had an awesome view then hoisted our packs to continue on.
Back on the trail it was more of the same until we stopped for lunch.  We were starting to run low on water with a long stretch to the next water source which involved a longish trek down then up a steep trail.  And the water availability was questionable.  Roadrunner made the comment that it would be nice if thre was some trail magic in the form of water at a parking lot that ws coming up.  Once again, the trail provides.  Chained to the gate at the parking lot entrance was a cooler with six gallon jugs of water for thru hikers. Holy water buffalo!
While I was getting my water bottles out I noticed my camp.shoes were missing.  The other day a bunch of us were sitting around talking when the question came up as to what you were willing to go back for.  Now I know.  I took off back up the mountain to retrieve them.  After what seemed like a long time running I passed a couple of hikers who confirmed they were still back there.  Eventually I found my shoes. I was so happy to see them.  I grabbed them and took off back down to the parking lot.  Roadrunner said it only took 15 minutes.  It felt much longer.
On the trail again we were cruising along when we came to a view.  I dropped my pack, grabbed my camera, and walked off to see what there was to see. Roadrunner almost passed on the view but changed his mind.  I was looking out over the valley admiring the scenery when he said something along the lines of OMG. Thinking he was talking about the view I said, ""yeah, it's nice isnt it?""  He said, ""No, look at that snake."" OH! A big rattler was napping on the ledge right below us.  And close by was a second rattler.  We took some pics then left them to their naps.
The rest of the hike was more of the same: real nice,clear trail occasionally interrupted by some rocks.  
We got to camp at out 6. There were two other hikers and a dog already there.  The spring was flowing good so we set up our tents, fixed dinner, hung our food bags, and were in our tents before 8:00.
As I was falling asleep I could hear fireworks from out across the valley, and another camper arriving.
Wow, that last fire work sounded loud. And close.  Then the unmistakable sound of the patter of rain drops told me it was time to let the tent flaps down.  The drizzle became a roar as we had our own fireworks on the mountain in the form of thunder and lightening.
Day 20
AT miles 20.1
Mils hiked 25.2
Independence Day! 
Despite the rain I slept great with only minimal dampness in my tent. Roadrunner said he didn't get wet. Saucy, one of the other hikers camped there, had to find a way into town to dry her sleeping bag. I was moving in slow motion this morning and was still the second person out of camp.  
For a change, the trail started out going downhill and it wasn't rocky.  Shortly, there was a road crossing with a trail head parking lot at a beautiful stream crossing.  The next section of the hike was through a section of mostly pine forest.
Soon enough it was time to climb. Although not particularly steep, I hiked uphill for well over an hour before the trail settled into a comfortable, rolling track.  Along the way was a monument to somebody who created a trail in the area and must have spent a lot of time caring for the trails. 
The trail started becoming quite muddy in sections.  Muddy as in the consistency of a good milkshake.  A few places the trail was actually going up a creek.
I passed Yellow Springs Village, the site of an abandoned coal town from the mid-1800s.  I spent a few minutes there exploring then moved on.  The day was really nice with the sun finally making an appearance around 11.
Sometime later I heard the roar of a mountain stream which paralleled the trail to a Gravel road.  Here was the site of another abandoned village that once had a population of around 1000 people. The trail going forward crossed a huge beaver dam or there was a 1.6 mile detour.  While debating the merits of each route, Roadrunner caught up.  We decided to cross the beaver dam.
The trail went through the old village and we could see the locations of homesite and foundations. I took a side trip over to the old cemetery then joined Roadrunner at the beaver dam.  We videoed each other making the crossing which I'm sure was a lot more exciting then the alternate route.
After several miles of descending we came to Swatara Gap.  As we were hiking down to the gap Roadrunner said it would be nice to have some trail magic. And just like that, near the bottom of the hill, was a cooler with a couple of Gatorades, freeze dried meals and some oatmeal. We each grabbed a G-ade and headed down to the river to soak our feet and legs.  The cool water felt great.  We still had a little more than 2 miles to camp but I needed to get to town to pick up enough food for a couple more days.
There wasn't much traffic so the prospects of somebody feeling generous and offering a ride were slim.  There is a 2.5 mile bike path that runs to a KOA campground. I speed walked to the store and found some overpriced things that would work.  Wendy's was right across the street so, since I was already in town, I stopped in for dinner.  As I was leaving a couple started chatting me up about the trail and their son's plans to hike the trail.  After about a half hour it was time to get going.  
Speed walk back to the gap.  I was starting to feel like something was in my left shoe.  I stopped to check. Nothing.  Shoe back on, continue journey, something is definitely going on here.  I finally reached the parking lot at the gap and my foot discomfort was increasing.  It was also starting to get dark making the game of ""find the trail"" even more fun.  After passing the turn off twice I finally figured it out.  Roadrunner text me the location of the tent site and said the trail starts with a steep climb but I could do it.
After 10 or so minutes of climbing a fairly steep hill the trail levels off and I thought, ""hmm, not so bad.""  Then came the steep, very rocky, 1.5 mile climb.  As I was stumbling along I was trying to envision where they found a place big enough to pitch even one tent, let alone the 3 to 4 claimed by the app.  Finally, just after 10, I spotted Roadrunner's tent.  
On the way up the trail I heard fireworks on both sides of the mountain but couldn't see them. Right as I was setting up my tent they started again and lasted until nearly midnight.  After pitching my tent the next order of business was to hang my food bag.  I quickly found a tree that would work, tied a rock to my rope and threw a perfect strike over the limb.  Don't celebrate too early though.  The rock came of the string and sailed off into the valley leaving about 1 foot of rope dangling from the tree branch.  I pulled the rope back down and went off in search of another rock.  I was amazed, on a mountain so full of rocks, how hard it was to find a rock.  After about 25 more minutes my bag was properly dangling from a tree branch and I was in my tent listening to the lullaby of fireworks in the distance.

Day 21
AT miles 17.9
Miles hiked 18.3
When I crawled out of my tent Roadrunner was already awake and said he was surprised to see me.  I told him the only tent site I saw close to ours was so close I didn't see the point in stopping.  After deciding where we would stop for the night he was quickly packed up and moving down the trail.  I finished breakfast and soon enough was on trail myself.  About an hour after heading out I heard a tree branch fall and looked to my left to see a bear run off followed by another bear jumping off a tree and running off.  Now that makes me wonder about all the other tree branches I've heard fall the past few days.
The rocky trail continued, made more challenging by what I determined to be a blister under the callous on the ball of my foot.
I stopped for a break and a snack at the William Penn shelter.  Glancing inside I saw a rubber snake hanging from one of the pegs in the shelter.  Cute.  Maybe somebody did that as a mouse deterrent. As I was eating my snack I heard a thud in the shelter.  The snake had fallen off the peg and was crawling towards the back of the shelter. And yet another reason to not want to sleep inside a shelter.
The trail went back and forth between frustratingly rocky and pretty nice.  As I was approaching Hwy 501 there was a sign announcing trail magic.  What a spread!  Fresh, made to order subs with all the fixings, ice cold sodas, fresh fruit, and homemade brownies.  And actual chairs to sit in.  The trail angel and his wife decided last year they wanted to do something nice for hikers.  I left feeling very satisfied and profusely thanking the gentleman who provided the food.
Once again it was time to deal with the rocks.  Between them and my foot my pace was really slowed a lot.
I finally made it to the campsite a little after 9:00. Far Out showed I wasn't there yet but a monument near the trail showed that I had already passed the site.  After several minutes bumbling around in the dark I saw a red light flash in my direction several times.  I followed the light and found the campsite.  It was the New Jersey couple and Roadrunner.  We planned to make Port Clinton the following day but it's over 15 miles and I'm not sure how fast I'll be able to hike or if I'll even make it there. 
No dinner, just sleep.
Day 22
AT miles 14.8
Miles hiked 15.6
Long, slow, hot, painful day.  Foot hurt to put pressure on it.   I was last out of camp and moving very slowly on the trail.   About an hour in I stopped to get some water and was passed by another hiker. 
A lot of the trail passed through a planned burn area so there wasn't as much tree cover as usual.  This seemed like the hottest day yet on trail.
Just after noon there was a rumbling of thunder off in the distance that was getting closer.  I could also hear a town's storm warning siren way off in the distance.  I took the side trail to Eagles Nest Shelter both to use the privy and duck out of the coming storm.  At my slow pace it seemed like forever before I got to the shelter. The  thunder was getting very close, the air cool, and it was beginning to sprinkle.  I took the opportunity to eat lunch and take a quick nap.  The storm never materialized so it was time to get going again. 
As bad as my foot was hurting I decided to camp on the mountain instead of going into town.  Those plans changed when I didn't have enough water and there were no nearby water sources.  So, what's 3 more miles of hiking anyway?  Thankfully, the trail had minimal rocks and it was a comfortable downhill.  Roadrunner had told me the descent was going to be very steep.  This wasn't bad.  Until I got to the place where Roadrunner was correct - sort of.  It was very, very steep with big rock steps.  And it felt like it would never end.  I had the brake pedal smashed against the floor on this descent.  Finally the bottom. Nope. One more even steeper drop to the road below - in case I didn't get enough during the last part.  Rapelling would have been much easier and safer.
The trail ended in a rail yard / historical park which was pretty cool.  If it hadn't been thundering and starting to rain I would have liked to look around some.  Motivated to keep moving I made my way to the church pavillion where a local church has created a space for hikers and where Cabella's runs a free shuttle to Hamburg for resupply.
The people I passed were all pretty friendly.  As I was walking past one house some people were out in the street talking. I greeted them and one of the ladies asked if I need water.  It was the famous water hose house.  So I happily stopped to fill my bottles before continuing to the pavillion.
The pavillion was nice and it was obvious the church people put some effort into providing this facility for hikers.  I chose to tent next to the river in the provided park across the street.  I called Dominos for a pizza delivery and made camp. Just as I finished my dinner a hiker from Australia showed up and we talked a bit before I headed to my tent. 

Day 23
AT miles 7.5
Miles hiked 8.5
Resupply day.  Despite some complaints about road and train noise,  I was only awakened once by a train. But then again, I had not closed the valve all the way on my sleeping pad which had mostly deflated so I had to wake up enough to reinflate my sleeping pad. Otherwise I slept like a rock.  Ate some oatmeal for breakfast and let some of my damp stuff air/dry out in the sun and morning breeze while waiting for the 1015 shuttle.   There's a hiker from Australia, Beauty Boy,  here who showed up last night plus another tent so somebody else arrived after I was in bed.
I caught the 1015 shuttle to Cabela's with Beauty Boy.  I felt like I was in a prison van on the ride over.  They locked all the doors from the outside before we took off.  Maybe they've had problems with hikers changing their minds about the shuttle and diving from the van.  I don't know.  About 10 minutes later we were parked in front of the world's largest Cabelas and the wardens unlocked the van doors.  Honestly, they were very friendly and showed us where to store our packs, charge devices, places to eat, and most importantly, where the Wal-Mart was located. I took an obligatory lap around the downstairs of Cabelas and payed my respects to the aquatic residents of the store in the giant aquarium, admired the stuffed animals (not sure if they were once alive or just good replicas), then headed upstairs to the camping section to get a new headlamp.  They had the Black Diamond Spot (same as the one that died) in red. Perfect! After checking out it was off across the expansive maze of big box store and restaurant parking lots to the king of big box stores.  There were a lot of hikers in there doing the same as I. Checked out and still time to eat lunch.  I was not in the mood for fast food so looking around I saw a Chinese- American buffet.  Perfect.  And for less than a meal at a fast food joint I had mashed potatoes, gravy, pork roast, broccoli, mac and cheese, fresh fruit, and sweet tea.  Twice.  If you ever find yourself in Port Clinton at mealtime, give J S Buffet a try.
A quick walk back to Cabelas arriving just in time for the shuttle back to the trail.  They dropped us at the post office which gave me a place to organize my pack and mail some rocks to my favorite rock collector back home.
While in the post office I heard the sound of thunder followed by rain.  A customer came in saying it was raining so hard up north she had to pull over.  I sat on a trash can under the post office awning waiting for it to stop. Postal customers told me this was going to last into the evening.  The radar confirmed their prognostication.
Despite the grim forecast, I took off as spon as it stopped raining.  In the wrong direction.  I finally figured out my navigation error and was soon on trail.  In PA. the trails coming into and out of town are usually long and steep.  This trail was no exception but I noticed two pleasant things: 1. My foot didn't hurt as bad as yesterday  and 2. My legs seem to be getting stronger.  Of course there were the mandatory rocky sections of trail but for the most part the afternoon's hike was over fairly smooth trail. 
I originally planned to stay at a shelter about 5.5 miles from town but when I arrived I was feeling good and decided to make it to Pulpit Rock.  About a half mile from my destination the trail turned steeply up and got very rocky. The final .2 miles was somewhat challenging but when I arrived the view was probably the most stunning of the hike so far.  Located not too far away is an astronomical site with what appeared to be huge telescopes.  There was  also a privy that appears to be placed there for AT hikers. Nice!
I found a place to set up camp, ate a quick dinner at the view, hung my food bag and got ready for bed.  The wind started picking up and rain started falling some so it might be a rainy night.
Day 24 
AT Miles 19.1
Miles hiked 19.3
This is the day the rocks got real. 
Slept pretty good last night. Was awakened once by something scratching at my pack.  I gave my pack a good smack and my nighttime visitor scurried off into the woods.
I planned on hiking 20 miles this day since my foot seemed to be better.  I got an early start eating breakfast on the trail.  The trail was still rocky from where I left off yesterday but I was positive I read somewhere that the trsil becomes very walkable to Highway 309.  I was beginning to have my doubts as I navigated through the rocks on a couple of climbs. The first view I came to, the Pinnacle, had an nice view but the sun was in a bad place making it hard to see good.  What impressed me about the Pinnacle was not the view but instead the huge pyramid shaped pile of rocks somebody created nearby.  That was no easy feat.
Soon I came to the easy section and was cruising along. I stopped at the pipe spring and quickly filled up since it looked like water would be scarce today. 
Soon enough the trail veered left and it was hello rocks. The name of the game was hop or step from rock to rock while hopefully staying on trail.  I did not realize all the different ways my feet could bend and twist.  Sometimes there was a foot shocking toe stub, not to mention the hidden little pointy rocks that were particularly painful to the balls of my feet and my heels.  These sections of the trail were interspersed with smaller awkwardly positioned rocks and blowdowns.
I ran into a Southbound hiker named Pinnacle, named after the aforementioned view.  He gave me some in sight on what was to come.  Pinnacle helps maintain a section of the trail further north but often hikes the section of trail I was doing today.  He warned me to get water at the upcoming spring saying the water sources were dry to the Thunder Lodge.  He also recommended dinner at the lodge and a shower, laundry, and breakfast at the nearby hostel.  He took a selfie of us, wished me luck on my journey, the we were on our ways.
About an hour later I came to the stream when suddenly hikers seemed to appear out of nowhere.  There were about a dozen all told. We stood around talking, filtering water and eating our mid-morning snacks.  Soon everybody was on the trail and climbing gbrough the rocks.  Then there was an invigorating almost 2 mile climb up to a view called Dan's Pulpit.  As I arrived a group of hikers were drying their shoes and socks on the hot rocks while eating lunch. Brilliant.  Being tired of wet socks and wet feet I joined them.
I almost had my first fall today and it would have been a doozy. I was climbing over a blowdown that was too tall to straddle with both feet touching the ground.  As I pushed off my left foot to get my right foot on the other side I started falling backwards from the weight and momentum of my pack.  Just before reaching the point of no return I planted my trekking pole on a rock behind me.  Now my left foot is in the air stuck on the tree, my right foot is awkwardly stuck on the ground, and my trekking pole is the only thing holding me up.  After a bit of struggle I managed to right the ship and get myself together. 
There were a couple more sections of rocks, then nice trail.  I made good time on the nice trail and made the lodge at 530.  As I was eating a husband and wife from near Roanoke, VA who were hiking the trail came in and introduced themselves.  Then Jose came in followed by Roadrunner. Surprisingly I had caught up with them. I moved to their table to finish dinner and they told me that the hostel next to the trail had a tent site and offered a shower, laundry, and breakfast for $15. Deal. I contacted the owner to make the arrangements, hiked up the trail, set up my tent, and went to the hostel. Jose showed me around and soon I was clean and would have clean, temporarily dry clothes.
There were 5 guys I've hiked with or around since just after Front Royal there plus another South African guy named Seth.  All but Roadrunner, Seth and I are slack packing about 15 miles tomorrow.  Roadrunner, Seth and I are planning about 14 to the next shelter.  We are supposed to have major rain starting tonite that is a concern.  Sometimes the weatherman is wrong.  Here's hoping.
Pennsylvania people love their fireworks.  As I lay in my tent finishing this entry the smell of rain was strong in the air.
Day 25
AT Miles 13.3
Miles hiked 14.3
Got some major rockstacles ahead of us today.   When I got up to the hostel everybody was busy getting ready for the day and fixing their pancakes for breakfast.  Roadrunner was the late sleeper but he eventually showed up and somehow beat me in line for coffee and pancakes.  
When Roadrunner pulled out his waterproof cover he found what looked like an ant nest in it.  Crazy! Anyway, after admiring and cleaning that up we were off.  The mandatory climb out was not bad this morning.  We got into the rocks quickly which was a good warmup for the Knife Edge.  
The Knife Edge was a lot of fun. Made all the more exciting carrying a backpack.  After carefully making our way across we rock hopped over the Bear Rocks which after the Knife Edge was OK but not that hard.  Later we came to another pile of rocks that rivaled the Knife Edge. I stopped to get a snack and Roadrunner was gone. I passed Jose and a couple of the other slack packers after about 6 miles.
Starting the day's hike we knew there would be no water until the shelter.  Hiking on I found a water cache near a powerline tower base.  I slugged back a liter of water then filled both bottles.  As I was crossing the parking lot a lady in a car yelled,  ""Hey, thru hiker!  Want some trail magic?""  As I walked over to see what this trail angel was giving out, she opened a box of donuts.  Manna from heaven! I grabbed a yeast donut, happy for the calories.  She said take two so I grabbed another, thanked her And took off.  And just like that the rain came.
Usually, rain starts out light and gradually increases in intensity.  Not this time. This was like somebody opened the faucet to full blast.  Dry one second, drenched the next.  Then  came the thunder and lightening. In no time we went from hiking the Appalachian trail to wading the Appalachian River.  After the water was over ankle deep I met High Speed voming from the opposite direction who was doing a 20 mile slack. We fist bumped and remarked how much fun we were having.  About five minutes later I passed Fish who was on the same slack. We fist bumped and wished each other well.
The trail climbed up to a ridge that would have had stellar views on a clear day.  Today, with the lightening and wind I was running every section I could so I could get off that ridge.  At one point the trail looked vaguely familiar and I had that uneasy feeling that maybe I had been there before.  Pressing on and hoping for the best the trail finally dropped down into the woods.  With the rain still shooting down it was good to at least be off that ridge.
Finally, I saw the roof of the shelter.  Roadrunner had arrived about 10 minutes before me.  There was also a couple here doing a flip flop hike.  After about an hour Seth showed up. I asked how he got here so fast.  He said he ran almost the whole trail here and had a couple of falls.  But was glad to finally be out of the rain.  All of us are normally tent campers but there was no place nearby to pitch a tent and at least we could cook out of the rain and stay warm.  After eating,  the Pennsylvania flip floppers taught Roadrunner how to play Yahtzee while I tried correcting all the typos in my journal so I could post an update next time I had Internet.
Soon another couple showed up and they chose to move on.  Then another couple showed and chose to do the same.  Two guys who had already hiked 25 and looked really beat  (Link and Chia) showed up and we couldn't send them on. Chia set up his hammock and Link set his sleeping pad under Seth's hammock. Unbelievably, yet another couple of hikers had spent the day out in this mess and this time there really was no extra room.
Soon enough it was hiker midnight and as if by magic all conversation ended and everybody made their way to bed for the night.

Day 26
AT Miles 16.9
Miles hiked 17.7
After yesterday's drenching everybody was up early eager to get on the trail.  What we were not so excited about was putting on our cold, wet clothes.  Whole still eating breakfast a trail angel showed up with honey buns and Cokes.  I passed on the Coke but that honey bun was soooo good.
Roadrunner and I filtered 2 liters of water knowing it was a long haul to the next water source.  We had about 1.5 miles to hike to our first challenge of the day - the Blue Mountain Rock Scramble.   We got our first view of the rocks while crossing the Lehigh River.  From a distance it was intimidating. After crossing the highway the trail wasted no time in gaining elevation.  It wasn't long before we reached the scramble.  There is a winter trail that can be used to avoid the scramble but we were determined to stay true to the AT.
Roadrunner was the first to go up.  We were no longer hiking.  We were now rock climbing up a near vertical cliff while wearing backpacks.  I'll admit there were a few tenuous moments while clinging to the rocks with my toes while looking for finger holds to help move up the rocks.  Once we were at the top we fist bumped each other on not falling off the cliff then started up the trail to another scramble.  There were three all together. This was followed by a ridge walk around the Superfund site. 
Years ago there was a zinc smelting operation in the area.  The pollutants from the fumes was so toxic it killed nearly all the vegetation on the tops of two mountains.  The federal government created a fund to clean up these kinds of areas.  The group doing the work up there has so far done a fantastic job.  
I stopped for lunch and to let my shoes and socks dry out for about an hour while Roadrunner continued on.  It was starting to get hot and water was a concern.  
Shortly after resuming my hike I ran into a group at an overlook and they, of course, were curious about my hike.  They were all my age and have been hiking the trail in sections.  They plan to do Virginia next.  One of them gave me a Snickers bar as I was leaving.  The hike around the Superfund site is amazing.  Both in regards to the view and the quality of trail work that's been done as part of the reclamation process.
Leaving the SF area meant the end of easy hiking for the day.  The trail varied from rocky to kind if rocky to a level of rocky that caused me to talk to the rocks in a sharp tone of voice.  
Towards mid-afternoon I was feeling the effects of limited fluid intake which was causing my concentration to wane which in turn increased the frequency of my conversations with the rocks.  Finally, I came to a spring which may or may not be dry according to the Far Out app.  I was hoping that the recent storm of near biblical proportions might have seeped deep enough into the aquafer as to at least release a trickle of water.  Would the .38 mile stumble down a steep, rocky hill pay off?  Eureka! Excellent flow filled my 2 liter water bladder in 16 seconds. I filtered a liter and chugged it down.  Then I refilled that bottle and the bladder and lugged them back up the hill.  I made a liter of lemonade and drank it while finishing off my Pringles.  Already feeling better, I stumbled through the hike until finally arriving at the tentsite a little after 8.  Not the nicest place I've camped but it was a place to sleep.  
I started dinner while setting up my tent and getting things organized for the night.  By the time I finished dinner it was well past hiker midnight.  I cleaned my cook pot an set it upside down on a rock to dry, hung my food bag, and was soon asleep. 
Day 27
AT miles 13.8
Miles hiked 16.2
I awoke to a slugfest. No, hikers were not engaged in a brawl. There were slugs stuck to virtually everything. It was a level of grossness that can't be described in polite circles.  There were slugs on the insect netting in my tent. There were slugs on the inside and outside of the tent. There were slugs on and in my shoes. There were slugs on and in my cookpot.  They were on just about everything I owned.  Lest you think these slimy gastropods are slow moving creatures you may be surprised to learn that no sooner had I removed them from one object to turn to clean another object, the previously cleaned object would almost immediately have slugs on it again.  Somehow through all this I refrained from vomiting.  
Finally packed up, I headed to the nearest spring to get water.  Roadrunner was going through an equally unpleasant experience of his own as I left.  
I came to the spring much sooner than I expected based on Roadrunner's description from the night before. I quickly filled up and headed for a viewpoint that was about a mile away.  I hoped to eat breakfast without being attacked by slugs.  I found a nice rock to sit on and enjoyed my morning feast of oatmeal and raisins.  Roadrunner showed up as I finished and off we went.  
As we were hiking he told me the place we got water from this morning was bone dry the day before.  Also, I wondered out loud how he was so fast through the rocks.  He said put your head down and take big steps.  I expressed my reservations about this method saying I usually took smaller steps to eep from dtripping and face planting.  This is where his mechanical engineering background came into play.  He said bigger steps mean fewer rocks which in turn means fewer chances of falling.  Smaller steps mean double the rocks and double the chances of falling.  Those mechanical engineers.  Anyway, I tried his way and whether or not the science and math are accurate, I did go faster and stumble less.
We got to Wind Gap a little before 11.  Some trail angel had left a water cache so we filled up.  I mentioned that since we were in an actual town it would be a shame to pass up on a  good lunch.  He agreed so we went to a nearby sports bar for lunch. I've been craving spaghetti for about a week and wouldn't you know - it was on the menu.  Along with a salad.  After a very satisfying lunch we headed back to the trail for the long, rocky climb out of town.  
I stopped part way up he hill to call Robin while I had service and we talked for a good little while. It was nice to hear her voice.  We said our goodbyes then it was back to stumbling- er - hiking up the mountain.
In all honesty, the hiking seemed much easier than yesterday.  Not sure if it was the actual trail or the bigger steps. As I was getting closer to camp there was an interesting section of trail named Wolf Rocks.  Unless some explorer from another time spotted a wolf roaming here I'm not sure how the area got its name but it was fun hiking/scrambling.  I was really hiking through huge rocks on the very top of the mountain.   After hiking through this and playing a game of ""guess where the trail is"" (a popular pastime I'm finding out) I eventually climbed down to normal trail.  For the first time in 3 or 4 days I was able to walk normally for a considerable distance. 
Even though I was camping at a site past the shelter, I needed to stop at this shelter because there was a water spigot nearby.  Bottles filled, I was off to dinner and camp.
When I arrived at the campsite, Roadrunner's tramily had finally caught up with him.  This campsite was the best I've stayed at so far.  It was a grass field overlooking a valley.  I set up my tent and fixed a quick dinner then was quickly in the tent.
Day 28
AT 6.2
Miles hiked 6.2
Well, I had an experience on the trail today I never planned on.  Yes folks, I had an emergency root canal.  I did something to my tooth a couple weeks ago and there was random pain but nothing I couldn't tolerate.  But it seemed like everyday it got a little worse until I had to take ibuprofen.  Then that stopped working.  I had tried finding a dentist last week but doing internet things in the phone is pretty frustrating.  I called my daughter and she found a place that handles dental emergencies and got me an appointment for the next day at noon.
Today's hike was pretty uneventful but really nice. I arrived at the Church of the Mountain Hiker Center at 1100.  I called the dental place and she asked if I could come in at 930 instead. Of course. Then while giving her my info she said they could see me today at 2.  OK.  I told her I was in my dirty hiker clothes and she said, ""No worries, come on in."" 
After hanging up she text me about 5 minutes later saying they could see me at noon if I could make it.  Lynn got me a Lyft and I was sitting in the dental office at 1145 - despite the Lyft driver's GPS getting lost.
The entire staff at Advanced Dental Associates was super nice and made this experience a lot less painful and stressful than I expected.
After my dental adventure it was off to the Wal-Mart for my prescription and resupply.  The co-pay for my prescription was much higher higher than I expected expected so I asked about Medicare and TriCare.  TriCare and Wal-Mart had a parting of the ways and are now back on good terms but I was their first customer to try to use it. I felt bad for the tech who was trying to help me. The TCsebsite wasn't working and they put him on hold when he called the help line. He kept apologizing but it wasn't his fault. After about a half hour I decided I would just pay the full co-pay so I could leave.  The guy said let me try this one thing that might help you.  Whatever he did knocked about two thirds off the cost.  I really am impressed with how nice the people in that town are.
The Lyft driver who took me back to the church said the GPS anomaly on my trip to the dentist was a normal thing.  He uses his own phone as a backup.  And indeed, his Lyft GPS tried to put us on the Interstate to Jersey but his phone gave different, more accurate directions.
Back at the church I set up my tent and repackaged my food (food is heavy).  Following that, I took a shower and went off in search of a milkshake. I found a place that specializes in deserts. The shake wasn't bad but they need lessons from my mom on how to make a truly good milkshake.  After the shake I was really hungry so stopped at a pizza place for fries and ended up with a side of cheesesteak hogie. It took forever to ear taking chipmunk sized bites but that just made the goodness last longer.
I gave Robin a call before heading to bed to see how she was doing.
I forgot to buy a fuel canister at Wal-Mart so now need to wait for the outfitter to open before I hike out.  Guess I'll pass the time waiting with some coffee abd a donut.Please email comments to:

Day 29
AT miles 13.7
Mikes hiked 16.1
I slept in this morning since I had to wait for the outfitters to open at 930.  I forgot to buy a fuel canister at Walmart yesterday so now I need to pay a little extra in terms of time and cash for that oversight.
While packing up I developed a taste for a donut and chocolate milk.  So, I stowed my gear at the church and went off foraging for donuts and milk.  Ah, the thrill of outdoor adventure.  I found a Dunkin' Donuts just past the outfitters and timed my purchase and consumption to coincide with the opening of the outfitters. I was a bit early so I helped them roll the life jacket racks out while I waited. 
Fuel canister in hand it was off to the church.  I checked my  bank account, paid my bills and was about to head out when I saw Roadrunner had returned.  His poison ivy rash was among the worst I've ever seen.  He was feeling a little feverish so returned to town in case he needed to see a doctor.
He told me about some of the upcoming trail, we said our ""see you  up the trails"", I shouldered my pack, and was headed north.  A couple of locals wished me ""happy trails"" as I headed out of town.  The hike crosses over the Deleware River on a bridge made of concrete and steel.  You just never realize the flexibility of those structures until you're bouncing up and down while walking across the bridge. About half way across is the PA/NJ border. My fifth state!
After crossing the bridge you hike through a park and past trailheads of several trails.  I found the AT and was quickly heading uphill. Soon enough the rocks returned.  It wasn't long before I arrived at Sunfish Pond.  This pond was created when the glaciers receded.  The water is so acidic that only sunfish and perch live there. The water was crystal clear and seemed very shallow.  The trail was a jumble of rocks following the shoreline. Not an easy hike but definitely a pretty hike.  After passing around the pond the trail turned back into Rocksylvania on steroids.  Back in the day, cartographers took the easy way out and used the Deleware River as the boundary between the states. Geographically, they were a little over 40 miles off.
There were nice views along the way but I eventually topped out on Racoon Ridge with eye popping views in nearly every direction.  Too soon, that view was behind me.  I was running low on fluids and saw there was a creek near an outdoor center.  As I crossed the creek I saw a hen turkey coming up the forest road.  I went into stealth photographer mode so as not to scare her off and snapped a few photos. I was amazed that she didn't run off in fear. I quietly put my camera away and started past her. She just looked at me as if to say, ""Hey"" Then went back to eating bugs. There was a sign that said ""Food/Drinks"" so I figured I could fill my bottles up and maybe grab something cold to drink. When I got there I was surprised to see my Virginia friends were there waiting for a mail drop.  They had been there for an hour or so.  They asked if the turkey was still down there. Wow. Must be the center's mascot.  Two cold root beers and peanut butter cookies later I felt refreshed and ready to start hiking again. 
I hiked about two more hours to Rattlesnake Spring.  There were campsites nearby but I saw what seemed like a surprising number of hikers.   Turns out it was an Outward Bound group from Philly.  They were much friendlier than the group I encountered in Maryland.
I gave them some space,  found a nice campsite, did the camp setup routine, ate, hung the food bag, and crawled into bed. I text Robin then next thing I know it's almost 2 hours later and I was awakened by what sounded like a bugle.  It was.  Somebody was playing Tattoo (A military bugle call that it's time for lights out and to get ready for bed. I didn't hear Taps but if they played it, it was drowned out by the Whippoorwills over my tent. I rolled over to go back to sleep when I was shocked fully awake by the sound of raindrops on the tent.  I dropped the flaps and this time was out for the rest of the night.

Day 30
AT miles 18.0
Miles hiked 18.6
One month on the trail.
I woke up early this morning hoping to get in a 20 miler.  Off to the east looked like a nice orange sunrise through the trees.  The birds were singing cheerfully so I just knew it was going to be an awesome day.  Then, as I was getting my food bag down an old rhyme my dad taught me way back started playing in my mind: ""Red sky at morning, sailors take warning…""  Nah, look how nice it is.  I fixed my Carnation instant breakfast and 3 packs of oatmeal and was looking at the Far Out App to plan my day.  Just as I put that last spoonful of apple cinnamon oatmeal in my mouth I felt the first raindrops.  I got everything I could, including myself in the tent and started packing up figuring this was just a passing shower.  (Another weather rhyme from dad, ""Rain before 7 ends before 11"" Hope that one is also accurate.) Then it turned 9 o'clock at night dark, big flash of lightning, big boom, then like Uncle Sy (Duck Dynasty) would say, ""It was on like Donkey Kong.""
So I sat in my tent turned ark hoping the water wouldn't make it over the gunwales. Soon I was sitting in a growing puddle of water inside the tent wondering if I forgot to seam seal the floor of the tent.  
The storm finally stopped after about 30 minutes so I packed up the muddy mess and set off to wade up the trail  with hopes of a sunny day to dry things out.  
A little over a mile into my hike I crossed a road and saw a parking lot full of cars. Why would so many people be out hiking in that mess?  Turns out it was the Hunterdon Hiking Club offering trail magic as a way to welcome hikers to New Jersey. They had burgers, dogs, veggies, fruit, cookies, chips, candy and soda. There was already one hiker there and we were soon joined by my hiking friends from Bedford, VA.  Also turns out one of the trail angels was named Bob and years ago he had to have an emergency root canal on his bike trip across America.
Belly full and spirits high, I was off hiking.  The entire day was filled with the ominous rumble of thunder.  The hiking was pretty nice and I eventually came to a rock outcrop with some less than usual overcast.  I set up my tent and hung my clothes in a bush and sat down for a rest and a snack.   Soon enough, with a little help from a brief appearance by the sun, the tent was dry and my clothes were now only damp so it was time to pack up and move out.  
What a day!  Trail magic and now sunshine.  I was cruising along making good miles enjoying the day despite the constant rumble of thunder.  One of the commenters in the Far Out App complained about a poorly marked section of trail on a rocky ridge.  I dismissed it as whining because so far this section of trail was well marked.  
Even though it was only about 5 it suddenly turned dark as nighttime. And I was on the aforementioned section of trail looking for blazes. I even backtracked thinking I missed a turn.  Then the temperature dropped and it started to rain. I stopped to put on my rain jacket and put my phone and camera in ziplocs when it cut loose.  Suddenly, BOOM! Lightning struck too close for comfort.  Nothing to do but get off that ridge.  I pretty much ran down into the woods and stood there for about 45 minutes feeling like I was being sprayed with a fire hose. 
The storm finally  passed so I could resume my game of find the trail.  It took awhile but after using a grid search I found the blaze.  The trail was very clearly marked if you knew where to look. I was tempted to go into town and buy some white paint to do the job right.
The sky looked like things were clearing up and I still had 2 hours of hiking ahead of me.  The trail came out on a road and I could see a gas station just down the road.  I headed that way for a snack only to find out that the only thing they sold was gas. Bummer. 
Oh well.  Back to hiking. The going was slow and I didn't make it to camp until around 1030.  There was one person sleeping in the shelter. I put my foodbag in the bear box, set up my tent and was out like a light.  Until I was rudely awakened by yet another thunderstorm.  Oh well, nothing to do but hope I stay dry. 
Day 31
AT Miles 19.8
Miles hiked 20.3
Ahhh, morning time. The rain stopped sometime in the night and all my stuff was still dry. Hallelujah!  
Got my food bag out of the bear box and noticed the other hiker had already left.  For some reason ramen sounded good for breakfast so I cooked some up. It met all my expectations.  As I was enjoying my soup and planning my day I caught something moving out of the corner of my eye. Yikes! Yogi was trying to join me for breakfast. His nose was in the air twitching about a 100 miles an hour.  I yelled at him to go away and he turned like he was leaving then  looked back over his shoulder and gave me that, ""Are you sure?"" look.  I yelled at him again and he started to walk away then looked back one more time and decided to come back.  You know how when somebody cusses you out in a foreign language you have no idea what they just said but you know it wasn't good?  Yeah, works with bears too. And he seemed to get the message. I threw a rock at him for good measure and he took the hint and ran off.  After he got about 100 yards away he sat down for a minute then started walking away.  I took a couple of pics and some video and figured that's that.  Until he came sauntering up another path like a happy puppy dog looking for love.  So I more vociferously expressed my objection to his presence and launched another rock at him.  He ran faster and farther this time.  
I kept an eye out as I packed up and sure enough he came in again through the back part of camp.  Once again I told him to leave and once again he begrudgingly left. I couldn't help but laugh as I thought about how similar he was to Yogi Bear in the cartoons.  Ranger Smith is not going to be very happy Yogi.
Soon after hiking out I came upon a deer off to the side of the trail eating. As I often do when I come upon animals I started talking to the deer in a quiet, calm voice.  It looked at me then started walking along beside me.  After about 50 feet I shooed it off not wanting to end up being one of those Instagram idiots.
Soon and unexpectedly the trail turned from rocky to smooth which made for some fast hiking.  The sun came out and it was a glorious day for hiking.
Once again, water sources were farther apart than my thirst and I was starting to get a bit worried. As I came to a shelter there was a water cache on the bear box.  Score!  I filled up and was wanting to take another break but there was no shade at the shelter so I decided to move on. Just past the shelter was a bear moseying through the woods.  I took a couple of pics but I don't know if he even saw me.
Soon I crossed the road and there was a guy standing by his truck looking in my direction.  As I entered the parking lot he asked if I saw the bear.  I told him I had and showed him the pics. Turns out he (the guy, not the bear) was there offering trail magic.  He had just put the snacks away when the bear came through the parking lot.  He is 5th generation in his family living in the area and we had a great conversation about his local roots, the area history, and stories behind the names of places.  He's been hiking in that area since he was a little kid and was describing the trail like he was describing the inside of his house.  He also told me that as soon as he retires he's hiking the AT. Yep, his name is also Bob.  He gave me his number and said if I needed anything between there and Bear Mountain to call and either he or his wife would be happy to help me out.  
Some of the trail went through fields and the trail was still very wet and muddy in places.  Climbing over a stone field wall I startled a roosted turkey which exploded from a tree scaring me half to death.  As I approached a pond I was startled again when a wood duck took off from almost under my feet.  
A few miles of slogging later I was supposed to come to the trail to the Secret Shelter. Due to health issues of the owner the place is overgrown so hikers have been avoiding it.  I never did see the trail to the cabin so it really is a secret.  Shortly after wading through mud and water about half way up my shins I came to not one, but two signs warning hikers to take the alternate AT route around the swamp area because it was dangerous.  It was becoming headlamp time so I heeded the warning and avoided the swamp. 
My destination for the day was Unionville, NY.  Supposedly, thru hikers could camp in the town park and there was a pizza place across the street.  I was beginning to feel like I would never get there as the trail grew wetter and muddier with each step.  It was so humid it may as well have just continued raining.
Finally, pavement.  I was sure I needed to turn left but Google Maps said turn right.  Ok.  Then it changed its mind. Ok, so I turned around. Then it changed its mind again.  Enough.  I restarted my phone and was finally pointed in the right direction.  From the looks of things they got a lot of rain recently.
As I was coming into town I saw a couple of guys talking in a parking lot. I asked if they knew anything about the camping. They not only knew about the camping, they were very friendly and very helpful.  They gave me directions to the park and told me to makexsure i got to the pizza place before it closed. I arrived at Annabelle's Pizza with a little more than 30 minutes to spare.
After eating I walked across the street to the par and set up my tent. There was one other hiker camped there.  
One of the perks of this place was a water hose we could use so I cleaned all the mud off my legs before going to bed.
Sometime during the night it poured. Thankfully, I stayed dry.
Day 32
AT Miles 17.0
Miles hiked 17.3
This day was probably my most miserable day on the trail. Let me restate that - this day was definitely my most miserable day on trail.  
I woke up around 630 and noticed the other hiker was already gone. Wow!  He had packed up and left in the rain. Tough guy.
I really wanted breakfast before heading out and saw that the general store was open. Well, maybe I could at least get chocolate milk and a stale honey bun.  When I got there, much to my surprise. the hiker from Cincinnati I had met a few times on the trail was already there. He was on the phone working on getting trekking poles sent to him on the trail.  It didn't sound like it was going smoothly.
I went in the store to see what I could find and much to my shock and joy they had fresh, just made, donuts!  Big, greasy, sugar coated rings of delight.  I ordered two. One was a yeast donut filled with apple filling like an apple pie donut.  The other was your basic glazed. Oh, and a chocolate milk.
They had a nice porch with chairs, tables, books, and electric outlets. Nice place to eat and socialize. Cincy hiker finished his phone call. Turns out he was the other camper but his tent started leaking because of the broken trekking pole so he grabbed everything and sat on the front porch of the store until it opened. 
We discussed our hiking plans for the day and left for the trail together.  The trail was nasty muddy and wet and suddenly there were clouds of mosquitoes relentlessly attacking every piece of exposed flesh.  Thankfully, part of the trail included a road walk.  Blessed relief from what we just experienced.  Walking along I heard familiar voices yelling ""trail magic!""  Link and Daddy were sitting in a carport where a lady had snacks and sodas.  Hey! 
Back on the road we soon came to the  trail.  It started out with a climb that was steep but at least not wet and muddy. Yet.
Then the rain returned. 
The rest of the day was hiking in rivers of water pouring down the trail except where the trail was flat. The flat sections were huge ponds of water, some knee deep.  In all fairness, there were occasional stretches of trail that didn't involve wading but with soaking wet socks and shoes that made that squishing sound, it didn't matter.
Finally, mid-afternoon, the sky ran out of water.  While the trail mostly sucked, at least it wasn't raining.   The downside of the rain stopping though was the mosquitoes got worse.
About a mile from camp, I turned at a trail intersection and came face to face with a bear about 10 feet away. We looked at each other for a second and off he ran.
I finally made it to camp at the Wawayanda shelter.  There were several hikers there most of whom I'd never seen before but all around my age.  I fixed chili flavored ramen mixed with fajita flavored chicken for dinner.  Very spicy.  I set up my tent and crawled into bed. Funny, my sleeping pad seemed under inflated. I aired it up again and soon found myself lying on hard ground.  I figured out it was leaking from the valve. I messed with it some but was too tired to care so I just slept on the hard ground.
It rained a bit during the night but more as a rubbing salt in a wound sort of gesture than serious rain. 
Day 33
AT Miles 16.2
Miles hiked 16.5
(I somehow deleted this day so had to recreate it after thr fact. When I get on a real computer I may be able to restore the original post.
I was up before all the other hikers for a change and quietly made my way to the privy. As I was exiting the privy I heard an exclamation of surprise as High Noon was reaching for the door handle at the same time I opened the door.   So, I do know somebody camped here.   And now that the morning quiet has been shattered, I'm sure hikers will be stirring about.
I quickly packed up trying to evade the mosquitoes with plans of eating breakfast at the nearby state park HQ.  I never saw the headquarters so just kept on hiking. Someone latervtold me itcwas off the trail, back in the woods and you had to be looking followed it to see it.
I was soon pulling myself up over ledges and boulders instead of walking up steep rocky trail.  The trail here was way different than any I've hiked so far.  I caught up with a hiker from NJ who had recently returned to the trail after a short break.  He said he felt like his legs forgot what it felt like to hike.  I just knew I felt like iI was working harder than usual.
Once I was at the top of the mountain the trail followed along the flat, mostly smooth sections of rock with occasional climbs up and down.  This would be incredibly fun in less humid conditions without a backpack.  As it was, it was still pretty fun and a departure from just steady, constant walking.   It was on these rocks where I had my first fall. 
While trying go walk down one of these rocks I soon found myself sliding down the rock on one foot toward a jumble of rocks.  This could have ended in one of three ways: One, my forward momentum is suddenly arrested and I pitch forward, face first into the rocks. Two, I stop suddenly, posed on one foot, perfectly balanced throwing my arms in the air like an Olympic gymnast on a dismount. Or, my foot goes out from under me and I fall backwards with my backpack cushioning my landing. Fate chose the latter and after a moment to figure out what just happened, I got back up and continued my descent. This time in a more controlled fashion.
After several miles of this the trail ""settled down"" and I began looking for a place to camp.  I chose a nice stealth site for the evening. The ground was relatively rock free which suited my flat sleeping pad.   I was joined for dinner by a swarm of mosquitoes and gnats.
The approaching darkness told me it was time to hang the food bag so off I went in search of a tree.  Sadly, the best tree I saw was next to my tent.  I found an old forest road and followed it until I found a good tree.  The branch was kind of high but worth a try. I got the rope over on the first try but the branch was too springy and I couldn't pull the bag up.  On to tree number two.  It took a couple of throws but I finally got the rope over the branch.  The rock was too light and wouldn't pull the rope down.  New rock, good throw and much to my dismay, the rock spun around the branch and I couldn't get it down.  McGyver time.  Back to camp to retrieve my knife and a piece of rope.  Off in search of a long, straight branch to lash the knife to.  I pulled the slack out if the rope and managed to cut the rope (not the easy feat you might imagine).  Now, on to tree number three.  I got a better rock, got it over on the first throw but again the rock was too light.  I found a long forked stick and coaxed the rock down but now my rope was too short. I used a sheet bend to join my other piece of rope and finally got my food bag hung.
I made it back to my tent after donating only a pint of blood to the local mosquito population. Despite my flat mattress I slept pretty good.
Day 34
AT Miles 15.8
Miles hiked 17.8
This days hike was pretty uneventful.  It was a lot of putting one foot in front of the other, fording stream (both real and on sections of the trail).  I did run into Jose who had taken a fall the day before so was slack packing southbound.  We tried to have a conversation but the mosquitoes were too bad.  Nothing to do but keep moving and swatting.  Had it not been so wet I feel like I could have made really good time on this trail.
At one creek crossing I passed a family that is hiking the trail. I later learned they are from Massachusetts.
As I came to a stream where the water actually looked clear I stopped to filter some water.   The family caught up and soon joined me. We all ate a snack then took off.  They were hiking faster than me so we're son out of sight.
There were a couple of good rock climbing sections then it was back to nice trail again. Oh, and rain.
As I entered Harriman State Park I passed the family again. I was off in Never Never Land while hiking on this wonderful forest road when it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn't seen any white blazes in awhile. Turns out like in almost a mile of awhile.  Yep. Love those bonus miles.  Finally back on the actual AT and not my version of the AT I was looking forward to the highlight of the day: The lemon squeezer.  I've read about it and head it mentioned on podcasts and now I was about to see if it lived up to the hype. 
But to get there required several steep climbs up and down some mountains.  Sometimes I wondered if I was just doing the same mountain over and over. How big was this place anyway?
Finally the trail led to an old mill race before the climb. I stopped to get water and admire the craftsmanship of the stone masons who built the race.  As I was headed up the trail the dsughter of the family passed me.  The first thing you pass through is like a big cave and my thought was, ""This isn't so special."" Then I turned the corner and thought, ""How am I going to fit through that?""
The daughter went through with no problem.  I got stuck.  I had to worm my way backwards, get my pack off, throw my trekking poles up on a ledge, push my pack through ahead of me until I got to where I could lift it over my head and throw it up on the ledge, the squeeze myself through and climb up on the ledge to gather my gear.  Right after the lemon squeezer was a climb up a rock wall. Try as I might I couldn't figure out how to get up it while wearing my pack.  After a few unproductive tries and slips I took the blue blaze trail around. It was no piece of cake. 
Finally on top I finished the hike in Harriman and finally arrived at the William Brien shelter where I was stopping for the night.  This was the saddest looking shelter area I've seen so far.  At least they had a new bear cable system and a spring.  I cooked dinner, cleaned the mud off my legs, and hung my food bag.  Then it was time for bed.  I really missed my once inflatable sleep pad.

Day 35
AT Miles 19.7
Miles hiked 20.2
This was a great hiking day.  Despite the mosquitoes. The terrain was pretty nice, the trail was pretty smooth and relatively rock free.  My only concern was what it would be like going up and over Bear Mountain.  First, due to the severity of the storms, Bear Mtn State Park was closed. The trail through the park was now open to thru hikers. Second, given all the other ascents in NY, I wondered how difficult climbing their biggest mountain would be.  On the plus side word was that the vending machines were working so I was looking forward to a cold drink to go along with my lunch.  
Entering the park were signs saying the trail was closed but rangers had been telling hikers it was OK to hike through the park.  
The trail looked fine.  I was waiting for disaster. It never happened.  The Trail was very nice with some good views.  There were also these rustic benches at the views dedicated to the memories of different people I reckon were somehow associated with the park. 
The approach to the summit was not a series of harrowing climbs. Instead, I found a marvel of carefully laid stone steps going up the mountain.  I cannot imagine the labor that went into the construction of those steps.
Once at the top of the mountain I saw the soda machines near a restroom being renovated.  The only soda not sold out was Coke Zero. You know what they say about beggars.  Coke Zero it was!
It was a bit surreal up there feeling like I was the only person in this usually bustling tourist atraction. I went over near the tower looking for a good spot to eat lunch and found out I was not the only person in the park. The New Hampshire family hiking the trail was already there eating their lunch and we remarked how odd it felt to be the  only people there.  They took off after a few minutes and now I had the mountain all to myself.
I finished lunch and started the walk down the mountain.  Steps just like before but on this side of the mountain the ravages of the storm were evident as parts of the trail were completely washed away.
The park has a museum and zoo that hikers like to visit as well as a good restaurant and food stands. All these were closed.  The only other soul I saw on my way through the park was a guy mowing grass.
Since the zoo was closed I had to take the blue trail out of the park.  The trail wasn't well maintained so it kind of spoiled the mood.  I spooked a deer which ran ahead a bit. As I rounded a corner, there he was again. Again he took off. I finally got off the trail onto a walkway to cross the Bear Mountain bridge into Connecticut.   The deer was still in front of me and sprinted into the enclosed bridge maintenance facility. I wonder what the bridge crew thought of that.  Or the deer for that matter.
It took a moment but I finally figured out where to cross the highway so I could cross the Hudson River.  It was a nice, scenic walk.  
After a short road walk I was soon on a trail that was supposed to go up to Mad Anthony's nose.  The trail was so messed up I had a hard time following it.  I somehow ended up almost at the top of the mountain before I realized I was not on any marked trail.  I worked my way back over to the AT and continued my ascent.
After looking at Far Out I figured I could make the Appalachian Market for dinner and resupply then camp at the Graymoor Friary.  The plan worked. Jose Frio was already there and he recommended the chicken Quesadilla.  Good suggestion.  I bought three days of food and snacks, repacked my pack. And hiked to the friary.
Since the early 70s the Friars have allowed through hikers to camp on the softball field there.  There is also a picnic pavilion, cold shower, water spigot, and electric outlets. 
I got in the shower with my hiking clothes and did laundry at the same time I took a shower.  While a lot on the brisk side it was nice to scrub all the mud off me.
I quickly dried off, put on dry clothes and sprinted to my tent hoping to outrun the mosquitoes. When I got to my tent I realized I was missing a sock. So much for diving into bed. Now I'm on a scavenger hunt looking for my sock in the dark trying not to disturb the sleeping hikers. I finally gave up and took my tired self to bed.
The long grass of the outfield provided some nice cushioning.
Day 36
AT Miles 13.6
Miles hiked 14.3
Today was a planned easy hike.  It was slightly over 14 miles to Canopus Lake where they have a section for thru hikers to camp. They leave the beach, restrooms and showers open for hikers after hours.  If you arrive early enough there's also a concession stand. I figured I could make the concession stand before closing. 
I slept in and took my time packing up letting everything lay out in the sun to dry from the dew.  Jose and I spent some time looking for my sock. I finally found it in the floor of the shower.
While eating breakfast, Lynn and I tried to figure the best place to send my new pole tips and sleeping pad.  Not as easy as it sounds.  We finally decided on a post office about 50 miles up the trail in Connecticut. Turns out, in trying to work out the logistics of my pole tips and sleeping pad, I walked off and forgot my spoon.
I left a little before 10 expecting to be at the lake around 5.  On the way out I visited the Friars Cemetery and 9/11 Memorial then soon was on the AT heading south. Oops!  Reoriented I was on my way to the lake.
This did not turn out to be the easy hike I had envisioned.  This ended up being a hard day of hiking with only a few short stretches where I could just go.  There were plenty of rocky sections and steep climbs.  There were also sections where the vegetation was so thick I wasn't entirely sure if I was still on trail.  Oh, and plenty of muddy sections.
I stopped around 1 for a lunch break and to filter some water. Back on the trail, I came to a low spot that appeared to be a small, baby poop green pond which looked and smelled disgusting.  Sorry leave no trace purists, there's just absolutely no way I was going to walk through, let alone any nearer to that cesspool.  Apparently, I wasn't alone in my reasoning as I soon found a ""trail"" leading in a big circle around to the AT.
About two miles before the lake the trail turned super smooth. I believe it was once a mining road.  About 1.5 miles from the lake was an interesting kiosk.  Mounted to the kiosk was an old dial phone called the Telephone to the Wind. The purpose is to call relatives and friends who have passed to share your feelings with them.  The bugs were so bad that I'm sure the phone, for the time being, doesn't get much use. 
Pressing on to the lake it seems like the trail designers took the longest, hardest route possible to reach the thru hiker area.  Once there it was really a nice place to camp.  Sans mosquitoes.
It's kind of weird, after camping alone or with only a couple of other hikers to suddenly be at a camp with about 20 hikers. It's amazing how friendly everyone is.  Although strangers, in just a few moments it's like you're old friends.
Another soft, grassy area to pitch my tent.  
Day 37
AT Miles 9.9
Miles hiked 10.7
Yesterday's easy hike wasn't.  So I made today my easy day.  The morning started off with a rain shower that, thankfully ended quickly.  I packed up my wet tent and other belongings and headed up to the shower/restroom area of the lake to eat breakfast with the other hikers. I then took off for the first stop on the deli trail: Stormville, NY.  The blue trail back to the AT seemed a lot nicer than yesterday and before long I was following the white blazes to the pizza.
The first half of the hike was fairly easy, sort of like a trail maintainers apology for the day before.  The second half was a workout but since it was a short day and pizza was on the menu, it was okay. 
The mosquitoes and gnats are impervious to insect repellant.  I've taken baths in mosquito repellant which seems to attract rather than repel mosquitoes.  That and all the vegetation hanging over the path made me decide on a different wardrobe.  I was contemplating the merits of long pants and long sleeves when a SOBO passed me dressed in long pants, long sleeves, gloves, and a head net.  He almost looked like a beekeeper. Perfect for this current state of affairs.   We talked for awhile about what lie ahead for each of us. I asked about his pants and shirt and he said it was the only way he could tolerate the bugs which will get worse farther up north.  He gave me the website and said they were currently on sale.
The hike ended at a hiker friendly pizzeria/deli (Coraddos in Stormville, NY) that has a tenting area out back.  I had 2 huge slices of supreme pizza and 2 root beers then set up my tent and layed my clothes out to dry.  
The bottoms of my feet feel bruised and as I was examining my shoes I think they are the culprit.   I would relate the sensitivity of my feet to the Princess and the Pea.  While walking I feel nearly every imperfection in the ground and some of them are quite painful.  To experience this for yourself, get some jacks and Lego blocks, scatter them on the floor, then walk across the floor bare footed. Yeah.
After attending to my hunger and camp chores I spent most of the afternoon laying around resting and ordering long pants and a long shirt for hiking.  
Dinner was at the deli and the sandwich was huge. The guy making the sandwich seemed to take a lot of pride in creating the ""American Combo"": roast beef, ham, turkey, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, mustard, and mayo on rye. I could only eat  half.  I had the other half wrapped up to eat tomorrow.  While eating, one of the other hikers, Traveller, from Ireland, joined me and we talked about the hike and what brought each of us to the trail.  I felt much better about my recent fatigue and slowed pace after talking to him.  He said New York has been hard for him too with its many steep, often rocky ascents and descents.  I'm coming to believe that despite what some may say, there is no easy state.  They are all, to some degree, hard in their own ways.
After dinner I retired to my tent to update my journal and not surprisingly fell asleep.  Something woke me up so I decided to hit the privy before the pizza place closed.  When I crawled out of my tent there was my buddy Jose.  We made plans for breakfast, I did what I needed to do then was back in the tent.
At 340 AM there was suddenly all this noise coming from the factory across the street that continued all night.  Turns out it's the place where they make Quickcrete.

Day 38
AT Miles 14.6
Miles hiked 15.6
Plan for the day was to hike to Toni's Deli in Pawling, NY for dinner and depending on how late I arrived I would either camp there or continue down the trail for a few more miles.
All the hikers along with locals around Stormville heading to work were keeping the deli busy with breakfast orders. This town and business are really hiker friendly as they all stopped to talk to us snd wish us safe travels.  Jose and I ate breakfast together then I finished packing up and hit the trail.  Surprisingly, it was mostly a nice dirt trail. There were the usual rocks, mud, climbs, and bugs.  But nice hiking all the same.  
At some point I heard a bunch of screaming and yelling up ahead so I stopped to listen.  Apparently, the family from New Hampshire had run into a yellow jacket nest.  Forewarned, I proceeded with caution and moved slowly and carefully up the trail.  There was indeed a huge swarm of yellow jackets.  I did my best version of the yellow jacket whisperer and moved through them unscathed.  
I arrived at a shelter about the time my stomach was letting me know it was feeding time.  I made some grape kool-aid and pulled out the other half of my sandwich from yesterday.  Delicious! While eating I was also swatting at mosquitoes. Just as I was moving out a couple of SOSOs came by and I warned then about the yellow jackets. They were most appreciative of the tip.  We said our happy trails and moved on.  Soon after I passed another hiker eating lunch. Turns out her name is Lunch Box.  How apropos.
As I was leaving, a couple of weekend hikers passed by. I joined them and they started asking about my hike. Soon it was like we were lifelong friends joking and telling  stories.  About 6 miles later they were at their stopping point. We wished each other well then I continued on.
The trail went through some pasture land that offered some great views as well as a marsh and a board walk through a wetland.
Pretty soon I was at the Appalachian Trail rail stop in Pawling, NY. As I was heading up the road to the deli a guy from Boston was in the area to go hiking and saw the sign for the AT.   He was asking about my hike and telling me of his plans to hike the trail.
I finally made it to the deli.  So far in New York, the people I have met have been incredibly friendly.  I expected more brusqueness.  I finally found that NY/NJ attitude in the woman running the deli. At least the food was good and reasonably priced.  I took my burger and fries to the campsite to eat and set up.  
Somehow, Lunch Box and a couple of her fellow thru hikers beat me there as well as a guy I'd not seen before. He introduced himself as Paddy O, a former thru hiker, friend of Lunch Box, now turned trail angel/shuttle driver.  He was fixing LB's tent then took them to the store for resupply.
I was sitting by the deli charging my phone and trying to update my journal when Paddy O came over to talk.  He reminded me a lot of one of my best friends growing up and soon we were reminiscing about being kids growing up in the 70s, music, my army career, teaching, and of course, hiking.  A couple hours later, as he was leaving,  he told me he was going to come up with a trail name for me.
It was way past hiker midnight so I was off to my tent for, as it turned out, a not great night of sleep.  First, there was a train that went by about every hour that announced its presence with several long blasts of its horn.  Then there was the noise from the nearby highway. To top it off, down the road somewhere, a car alarm kept going off.  At least it wasn't raining and breakfast was close by.
Day 39
AT miles 15.8
Miles hiked 16.2
As I was leaving Toni's my Virginia friends Cheesecake and Hooty Who show up in a car.  They jump out and we had a quick reunion.  The driver offered to take me and Greyhound back to the trail.  Better than walking back up that highway.
Thd trail started out through a wet field overgrown with weeds. Might as well get my feet wet early rather than suffer the indignity of dry feet.  This was also prime mosquito habitat so we got off to a grand start.  
I soon left Greyhound behind as I climbed, stumbled, swatted, and walked up the trail.  This actually would have been a nice section of hiking were it not for the mosquitoes and gnats.  I can't wait for my new hiking clothes.
About an hour before my planned stop for the day I caught up with Saucy who was planning to camp at the same site as I.  On the final climb we caught up with a group of scout leaders out on their annual boy scout camp out minus the scouts.  One had received a slight wound to the head from contact with the trekking pole of one of his companions who had slipped and fallen on one of the many rocks decorating the landscape.  The Three Stooges Go Backpacking.  
It wasn't long before we made our arrival at the Schagticoke Campsite.  The mosquitoes were so bad it was almost impossible to set up our tents.  But we succeeded.  Saucy said someone had built a fire at the last place she camped to keep the mosquitoes away.  Good idea.  I quickly made a small, smoky fire providing enough relief from the little bloodsuckers to allow us to eat. 
When I went to my tent to get my cook pot I noticed a huge swarm if bees around my tent.  Wonder where they came from. I soon discovered I had driven one of my tent stakes into their nest and they were attacking the offending tent stake.  I very carefully added the last tent pole to make my tent freestanding, and slowly removed the tent stake and moved my tent to another spot.  Catastrophe averted.  Pizza Hands arrived just as I started eating and was more than happy to sit in the smoke so he could eat.  
I went up the trail to use the privy and as I passed one of the scout masters (Curly or Moe), he said with a funny grin, ""You must be on your way to the gentleman's room.""
Not understanding the joke I just said sure and continued on.  Then the humor became obvious as there, in the middle of the forest, sat a commode.  All by its porcelain self.
On the way back to the campsite a hiking couple were trying to set up camp while battling the mosquitoes and having a pretty rough go of it.  When I arrived at our little area Kibbles and Greyhound were sitting in the smoke eating dinner. I checked for a signal and went off to call Robin while swatting mosquitoes.  When I got back to camp everyone was already in their tents and the fire had gone out.  I was soon behind the protective insect barrier of my tent trying to find the smoothest part of the ground to sleep on.

Day 40
AT miles 13.6
Miles hike 16
Today was a town day with a stop in Kent, CT for a shower, new spoon, shoes, pole tips, sleeping pad, laundry, and food.
I woke earlier than usual and spurred on by the mosquitoes was on the trail quicker than usual. Saucy was already gone, Pizza was still in his tent, and the others were just getting up.  
The hike to the road went by quickly.  As I was coming off the trail I was getting my phone out to figure out how to get to town.  Before I could turn on my phone a car stopped in the road and I heard someone call my name.  It was Christine, the shuttle driver from the day before.  She had just dropped off some hikers snd saw me come off the trail.  She offered a ride and of course I accepted.  About halfway to town she saw Saucy so stopped and gave her a ride too. She dropped us at the town center then gave us an orientation so we would know where everything was.  I walked up the street to get coffee and donuts and ran into Cheesecaje and Hooty Who.  They told me the shoe store was closed but maybe the outfitters would have shoes.  Hopefully.  Got my coffee and a roll and headed back to the visitor center so I could start running my errands.
This was a very nice, hiker friendly town where everything was within easy walking distance. First stop was the shower at the visitor center where for $2.00 you get a four minute hot shower.  You can get clean in four minutes but there's no standing around enjoying the feeling of a hot shower.  Cleaner than I was 4 minutes ago, I was off to the PO to pick up my pole tips and sleeping pad.  Then back to the laundry for the obvious.  While my clothes were washing I dashed over to the IGA to buy some food for the trail and then dashed back over to the laundry just in time to throw my stuff in the dryer.  While my clothes were drying I repackaged my food.  I finished that just as my clothes dried.  I went back over to the visitor center to change clothes.  After changing, I finished packing my pack and walked over to the outfitters to borrow a pair of pliers so I could change my pole tips.  As I was tending to that, the wind picked up and it started to rain. Oh joy.  So much for clean, dry clothes.
With new pole tips and a freshly packed pack I headed off to find lunch. I stopped at the Cafe where I'd eaten breakfast and Pizza Hands was just finishing his lunch.  Pizza headed out while I was just starting to eat.
The rain finally let up so I headed back out. The first part of the trip was a long road walk out of town to the trail.  The road walk at first was nice and easy until it started going steeply uphill. Eventually the road came to the trail where the steep uphill continued. 
As soon as I got on trail the mosquitoes attacked me.  After a bit of hiking I came to the first campsite out of town where Pizza and Saucy were camped.  I stopped bybto sau, ""hey"" then continued on. The trail suddenly became wide and super smooth following the river.  I called Robin until I lost service while I flew up the trail.  I came to a spring and filtered some water then made the final climb up to Silver Hill Campsite which was a very nice camping spot.  I set up my tent and fixed a second dinner then was off to sleep.
Day 41
AT miles 15.1
Miles hiked 17.1
Today the plan was to make Falls Village to pick up my mosquito proof clothes at the post office.   
After the last 5 miles of trail yesterday I had my hopes up for more of the same. Nope. Today was a kind of hard hike with lots of ups and downs mixed with a little rain.  
At the top of one climb was a grandmother out hiking with hervtwo granddaughters.  She had lots of questions about my hike and asked me to tell her granddaughters about the AT.  One looked at me like I was crazy but the other looked like she was read to go right now.
About lunch time I passed Lunch Box sitting in a rock by a stream. She said that Paddy O had come upbwith a trail name for me: Taps.  I like it. I told her to thank him for me then moved on.
At some point I heard what sounded like somebody on a motorcycle racing up and down a road.  When I got to the hanglider overlook I could see a racetrack.  I was hearing race cars.  Then I heard thunder.  Time to get going.   Maybe 10 minutes later I was getting soaked.
I finally arrived at Falls Village.  This is a sleepy little town where they roll up the sidewalks at 5:00.  I, of course, came rolling in much later than that. I met another hiker also just coming into town. There was a cafe called the Toymakers Cafe which went out of business.  However, the owner still allows hikers to camp behind the cafe.
There was another hiker camped here who was having a phone struggle with Apple.  I felt really bad for him but there was nothing I could do.
The only food options were cooking my dinner and eating with the mosquitoes or the Falls Village Inn.  The rain had finally stopped so I set up my tent then went over to the Inn to see about dinner. The food was excellent but expensive.  After dinner the hiker I came into town with and sat on the Village Inn front porch charging our phones and talking.   Mountain Goat was still trying to fix his phone problems when we psssed him on our way to our tents.

Day 42
AT miles 15.3
Miles hiked 17.3
No need to be in a rush this morning since I had to wait for the post office to open.  The mosquitoes were pretty annoying at the little campsite so I went to the cafe and sat on the steps waiting for them to open.  Outward appearances of the place was that of expensive coffee and stale, designer pastries. I was surprised when I saw they fixed real food.  I ordered pancakes, eggs, and bacon and was further surprised at how generous the portions were.  And the coffee was good.  By the time I finished, Mountain Goat and the guy I hiked into town with showed up. Mountain Goat had finally straightened out his phone debacle from the day before and was in a much better mood.  
As feared, my package had not made it to the post office. Such is the peril of mail drops.  The postal employee said they could forward my package so I left my info to have it forwarded to Great Barrington.  Here's hoping.  
I walked back to the cafe to get my pack and hit the trail.   The plan was to pass through Salisbury for lunch then hike to a shelter that was about 5 more miles up the trail⁶. A planned 20 or so mile day.  The weather was beautiful, the mosquitoes somewhat less annoying and the trail wasn't real taxing.  
At the top of one climb there was a grandmother out hiking with her granddaughters and she asked me to tell them a little about my hike andvthe AT.  One had that look in her eyes that said that is the craziest thing I've ever heard of.  The other had the look of a future thru hiker.  Once that bug bites you it doesn't let go.
As I was crossing a stream I passed Lunch Box who was taking a lunch breakĺ while sitting on a rock.  She told me that Paddy O and she had come up up with a trail name for me.  Taps.  I like it. It reflects my military service, musicianship, and patriotism. I wished her happy trails and got back to hiking.  I made it to Salisbury and ended up at a bakery eating a couple of cookies and drinking iced tea.  Not exactly what I envisioned but the cookies were good and the tea was cold. Calories.  While I was eating, a couple of guys started chatting me up about the trail and telling me about their hiking experiences.  As I was leaving I asked if there was anyplace close by where I could get a soda.   There was.  A grocery store was less than 100 feet away that I hadn't noticed.  I thanked them and headed to the store.  Sitting outside the store was Pizza Hands, the guy from Falls Village and an older hiker, No Rush,  who was my age doing the same thing as me. He retired from the Air Force and Civil Service and started hiking the trail with his son.  He's been out here for 10 months.  He had to get off the trail twice for medical issues and expects to complete his flip flop next month.
I went in for my soda and got some ham and cheese from the deli and a roll to make a sandwich along with a Mountain Dew. I joined the other hikers and listened to No Rush's  hiking stories.
Pizza asked where I was hiking to and after I shared my plans he said I was free to do what I want but that he heard that there were 3 hard mountains before that shelter.  I hadn't considered that but didn't abandon my plans.  We left town together and overall, the hiking was nice.  There was a cooler of trail magic at the bottom of the climb so we each grabbed a root beer and headed  up. He stopped for a break at Riga Shelter and I continued up Bear Mountain.  The views from the mountain were spectacular. I celebrated my summit with my root beer and some pretzels while enjoying the view.  Pizza soon joined me and as the sun was starting to set we headed down to Sages Ravine.  I decided to stop at the campsite there for the night instead of continuing on.  It was dark by the time I cooked dinner. While eating I could swear I heard kids voices but couldn't make sense of that out here in the dark.  Anyway, I put my food bag in the bear box and went to sleep.  About 1030 I heard some noise down by the bear box and looked out of my tent to see some headlamps so figured it might have been some late arriving hikers.
About 330 in the morning I heard a commotion down by the bear box again and saw three headlamps at the box. I flashed my light at them and they left. Having heard of people stealing food bags I went down to the box to check and my and Pizza's food bags were still there.  Farther off in the woods was a concentration of light so I sat outside my tent keeping an eye on the situation. A little after 4 here comes the 7 dwarfs. No, it was a youth group on a night hike.  Talking to Mountain Goat the next day it was a YMCA youth group going up Bear Mountain to watch the sunrise.  There is Karma because it was so foggy and overcast the next morning that all they would be able to see was white.  

Day 43
AT Mile 14.0
Miles hiked 14.1
I eventually got some sleep but was awakened by the patter of rain on the tent. So, I was up and packed in a hurry.  On the way out of the campsite I stopped to filter some water. 
Good thing I heeded Pizza's assessment of the trail ahead.  It would not have been a fun hike in the dark.  The climb up Race Mtn wasn't too bad. On the way up I passed Mountain Goat.  At the top was a group of scouts out for the weekend.  The views along the mountaintop were spectacular despite the fog.  The trail hugged the edge of the cliffs in several places so one misstep would have spelled disaster in a major way.  The trip down the other side involved some climbing and a couple of butt slides along with a few unplanned foot slides courtesy of my well worn shoes.  After a bit of comfortable hiking it was time for a long uphill grind to the top of Mount Everett.  Mountain Goat was there taking a break and talking to a couple who lived not far from his home in Canada.  It was my turn to take a short break while they all left.  The climb back down was not as hard as the climb up.  Soon I was doing some flat hiking passing a pond and crossing several streams.   Then the thunder started.  Next up was Mount Bushnell where the Far Out comments said this was a bad place to be in the rain. Fantastic.
Now I was pushing harder than I wanted to get up, over, and off that mountain.  The echoes of the thunder across the valley was unbelievable but also spurred me on.  Now the special effects included flashes of lightning.  Finally down off the mountain it was about 5 miles to Great Barrington.  The trail would have have been perfect for a leisurely hike on a nice day.  This day, it was dark and spooky.  I thought I heard voices a few times and got the feeling I was being watched.  The wind was howling, the lightning was flashing, and the thunder was shaking the ground.  I could hear it raining but the forest canopy was so thick that the ground was still dry.  I was practically running.  Then the rain won and I was wet.  The hike went through fields and marshes and crossed a couple of roads.  Finally, the rain stopped when I got to a road crossing. I took out my phone to see where I was and it was so wet it was useless.  Then the rain started again.   Along with all of Mother Nature's pyrotechnics.  Strangely, there was this massive tent like structure in a field across the road.  I clawed my way up the roadside hill to get under its cover.  I messed with my phone until finally giving up and stuffing it in my backpack.  Back in the rain for the finishing kick through knee deep water and pig sty-ish mud.  A final push across a stream, er, field and I was at Highway 7.  Now what?  I didn't know which way to go I just knew it was a little more than 3 miles to town.   I saw a business across the road and decided to ask for directions.  About 3 steps into the parking lot a car pulls up beside me and asks if I needed a ride into town. 
 ""As wet as I am?""  
"" Sure!  All the more reason to give you a ride.""  He is a hiker, trail name Steady Stream.  He owns his own business so whenever he runs errands or is on his way home or to work he checks to see if hikers need rides.  
He got me into town the told me to text him when I'm ready to leave and he'll drive me back out to the trail.  
Once again, the trail provides.  I checked into a hotel, cleaned and started drying my stuff when I fell asleep.  I woke up and called Robin, got dinner, bought some snacks and headed back to my room.
Day 44

New shoes and hiking clothes day! 
Weird but i didn't sleep well in my hotel bed last night. Woke up every hour. I got up early and went to the hotel laundry to wash and dry my clothes.  Afterwards I went to eat the complimentary breakfast. The pancake machine is a technological marvel.  
After eating. I packed my pack and left it with the front desk while I walked into town to get my new hiking clothes from the post office.  There was a shoe repair/hiking boot and shoe store.  They were very knowledgeable of hiking footwear and soon had me in a new pair of hiking shoes.  I couldn't wait to throw the old ones away.  
I got back to the hotel, changed clothes, performed the ceremonial disposal of my old shoes, and headed to lunch and grocery shopping.
When I finished lunch my buddy Jose was also at McD's.  We went to the store together then he went to the community center to workout and swim. I charged my phone and used the not primitive facility while I waited for my ride to finish work.  I may camp here instead and head out in the morning.   Jury's still out.
I fell asleep at the center and when I woke felt it was too late to head out so this became my first zero.
I called Robin, ate a snack and called it a day.
Not so fast. Sometime in the middle of the night I thought I heard Jose heading past my tent on the way to the woods.  Then I heard this voice from outside my tent quietly say, ""Pardon me sir, may I have a moment of your time?"" 
Now I wondered if I was dreaming. Then he walks away and I hear him at another tent.  Odd. Then I'm sure I hear a dog growling but I don't remember seeing a dog.  Am I  dreaming this? Am I dreaming that I'm dreaming this. If I was awake I went back to sleep. If I was asleep then I continued sleeping.

Day 45
AT miles 10.3
Miles hiked 10.8
Ok. So I wasn't dreaming. The main topic of conversation in theornong was, ""Did some strange guy come to your tent last night?""  And there was a dog sleeping in one the hikers tents.  The guy in a hammock next to No Rush said the guy was looking for bug spray. No Rush gave him some and the guy took a bath in it.  It's important to add that the mosquitoes where we were  camped were no joke.
Jose and I packed up then went to McDonald's for breakfast then we hurried back to the center to meet our shuttle ride back to the trail.
I was sporting my new hiking ensemble to hopefully be able to better deal with the mosquitoes.  Although there was a black cloud of the buzzing bloodsuckers I only suffered one bite.  Jose, on the other hand, was getting lit up as his sun shirt was no match for the probing probisci of these evil insects.  About an hour into our hike two young guys hiking in shorts and tank tops practically ran past us spraying each other with Off.
Shortly after that it started raining. Oh joy.  Nothing to do but swim on.  Thankfully, the rain stopped after about two hours.  Around 8 miles in was a road intersection with a  big sign announcing trail magic 600 steps down the road.  It was lunch time and I was hoping there would be something good.  I was not disappointed as these were basically professional trail angels.  A couple purchased property near the trail just to be able to do trail magic. There was an old chapel which was their center of operations along with a clean port-a-john, electricity, and a mostly mosquito-free lawn.  They have plans for a bear box and to allow hikers to camp there.
The two young guys were there when I arrived and they were covered in insect bites.  There was also a SOBO who gave us a preview of what to expect up north. Marc (one of the trail angels) was fixing ham, egg, and cheese sandwiches on toasted bagels which along with the fruit and other treats nade for a good lunch.  Jose came in about 30 minutes after me.   We sat around sharing stories when three more hikers arrived.  One was Proof, the guy with the incredible appetite who I'd not seen since Duncannon.  They had also been destroyed by the mosquitoes.  One of them however had been doing his part to eradicate the pests as he was hiking with an electric flyswatter.  Genius!
Hoping to beat the impendinding storm we expressed our gratitude for their kindness and generosity and headed out.  Maybe 20 minutes later we were being pelted by big ol' cold, fat raindrops.  Then the wind kicked in and the intensity of the rain picked up and soon we were wading up the trail.
I was the first to reach the side trail to Benedict Pond where I quickly found the thankfully unlocked, warm bathroom of Beartown State Forest.  Soon the other hikers joined me and we found the camping area and set up our tents.  I'm not sure what the others did but I went back to the camp bathroom and cooked some ramen and chicken, ate two honey buns and my leftover biscuit from breakfast. By this time it had stopped raining but the wind was insane.  
I cleaned up my mess then changed out of my wet clothes and headed to my tent where I basically passed out.

The rain ended last night and it got really windy.  It made for good sleep. I woke up early and hung my wet clothes and shoes on the fence by the beach to let the wind and sun work their magic while I ate breakfast. 
Miracle, Sunshine, and Proof got out about a half hour before me.  My stuff finally dried and I headed out while Jose was still drying his stuff out.  Although the trail was wet and muddy, at least the mosquitoes were not as bad as in the past couple of weeks.
The destination for the day is the Upper Goose Pond Cabin, a historical fixture on the trail.
Nothing spectacular happened this day.   The trail was really full of tree roots with occasional rocky sections.  The last 5 miles of the trail were fairly smooth so I made good time.  However, the closer I got to the cabin the worse the mosquitoes got.
I finally arrived at the cabin just before dark and somehow Jose was already there. He showed me around and I chose to sleep in my tent rather than the crowded bunkhouse.
Shortly after Jose's tour, Sue, the caretaker, gave me and the just arrived Miracle, Sunshine, and Proof the official tour of the camp. They had a lot of rules that they seemed very strict about. 
After the rules tour we set up our tents and cooked dinner.  I talked to Robin and Raina a bit then went to sleep.   It got pretty cold during thd night and I ended up sleeping in my puffy.

One if the highlights of the cabin stay is the blueberry pancakes for breakfast.  Caretaker Sue said she starts serving them at 630.  Silver Back, another hiker, and I showed up around 650 and Sue seemed a bit put out that she had to make more pancakes so brought out 9 pancakes and said what we don't eat we should take with us for the trail.  Silver Back and I looked at each other like, ""Is she serious?""  We took 3 each thinking she would make more if other hikers came in. Nope. Several other hikers came in asking about pancakes and she told them they were too late.  Really?
I took a few moments to look at the lake then headed out for the Cookie Lady figuring to grab a couple of cookies then hike on about 5 more miles.  I stopped for a morning break on top of Beckett Mountain. Proof passed me and as I was leaving, Miracle and Sunshine showed up.  We hiked together eventually catching Proof.  To pass the time we played some made up game where we guessed random stuff until we figured out the category of what the person was thinking.  It worked. It seemed like in no time we arrived at the Cookie Lady's house.
The house is actually located on a blueberry farm and this Cookie Lady is Cookie Lady 2.0.  The original Cookie Lady passed a few years ago and when the current owners of the farm took over they all wanted to continue the tradition.  We were greeted by Cookie Son who showed us where the homemade cookies were and brought jars of homemade lemonade. 
They have a deal where if you pick a bucket of blueberries they will fix you dinner and allow you to camp at the farm.  So, I became a migrant worker and earned my burger, chips, fresh salad, and pea soup.   Very delicious. We were sitting around talking to a SOBO about what was coming up when Cookie Son started baking pizza in his recently finished homemade pizza oven for the first time.  It took him a few tries to get it right but he kindly shared all his ""rejects"" with us hungry hikers. 
Wasn't long before hiker midnight was closing in so we all retired to the airplane hangar for the evening. Good thing we dleptbyhere as the sky unloaded sometime during the night.
Day 48
AT miles 19.2
Miles hiked 22.0
We all got packed up, filled our water bottles and were ready to roll when Jose showed up followed by Roadrunner, Coyote, and Banana.  We all were happy to see each other with everybody fist bumping and talking about a million words a minute. It was  like a family reunion.  Coyote told me all about his trip to New York City and Roadrunner told me all about his Lyme disease.  They were staying for cookies and Jose asked me if I'd like to meet his sponsor. He told me I would be amazed at this guy's farm and his tribute to military veterans.  Curiosity aroused, I said ""sure."" 
His farm was only a half mile down the road.  Jose had already told him about me and since I was a veteran he said I could come.  Entering the farm, or should I say, compound, I was immediately cognizant of how neat and orderly everything was.  Jose took me to a barn-like structure and said this was the museum. It was.  Around the lower walls was a timeline of 9-11.  There were very large information posters of all the U.S. Special Ops units along with timelines of major engagements in Afghanistan.  In the center of the room was a table with photos and bios of specops personnel who were KIA during various operations. Then his sponsor came in and introduced himself and gave a brief explanation of his farm then told us to go down to the memorials and look around then come back to the museum.  Ther was a memorial to Seal Team 6 with two Chinooks, along with other memorials listing the battle info and U.S. casualties.  This was a very somber place.  We returned to the museum and were soon joined by Eyal.  We had a great conversation that ended with an open invitation to return anytime.  I was awestruck by his patriotism and love for the U.S. military.  Easily the highlight of my hike and time well spent.
Back on the trail I was off to Chesire to camp at Father Tom's campsite.   But first, I had to pass through Dalton, MA.  The trail went through the middle of town.  I stopped at a sandwich shop for a cheesesteak and fries.  I saved half the sandwich for dinner and hiked on.
I arrived in Cheshire before dark thanks to four miles of fairly smooth trail and a bit of trail running.  This campsite is maintained by the town in memory of Father Tom who did a lot for the hiking community as well as the community of Cheshire.
Day 49
AT miles 16.2
Miles hiked 17.7
I woke up early knowing I had to pick up a package from the Williamstown post office and an Amazon drop at a store near the post office.  
Today's hike took me up and over Mount Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. The climb up was surprisingly gentle and an all around nice hike.  I somehow missed the excellent trail magic on the way up.
The views from the mountain top were spectacularly amazing.  It was a very clear day and I was able to see mountain ranges in Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.
While I was eating a snack a youth summer camp group asked if they could sit next to where I was sitting.  Of course.  The counselors and I got to talking and they asked if I could talk to the kids about what an AT thru hike is.  They were very attentive and full of questions.  As I was getting ready to leave they all thanked me and wished me luck on my journey.
I was hoping to make Williamstown to pick up my quilt and meals from the post office and also my camera batteries from the Amazon drop box.  If it was smooth hiking I had a chance.  The trail was not smooth and the going was painfully slow.  With a half mile to go it began to look like it was time for Plan B (which I hadn't figured out yet). It was here that I ran into a local hiker who was full of questions. I had asked him how far it was in to town and so had decided I would have to hike through town to the next shelter then hike back into town the next day (Plan B).   After a couple more minutes the guy said, ""I'd like to drive you into town.""  I told him it wasn't necessary but being a section hiker he understood how hiking logistics work and insisted on helping me.  He got me to the post office before it closed then took me to my Amazon drop. Once again the trail provides.
Bad news on the camera.  The new batteries made the problem worse and it appears the last storm may have  fried the motherboard.  Disappointing. Trying to decide whether to have it repaired or to buy a new camera. 
The hike out of town seemed long but in no time I arrived at the campsite. It was packed, making it difficult to find a good tent spot. There were SOBOs, NOBOs, section hikers, and weekenders all at this one site.   There was no Verizon service here and word is that that will be the norm through New England where apparently ATT rules the cellular world.
It was nice having my warm quilt back and I had my best sleep in days.9

Day 50
AT miles 18.3
Miles hiked 18.3
I got off to another early start today knowing the going would be a little slower with all the roots, rocks, and mud.  I wasn't wrong.
About an hour into my hike I came to the Vermont border.  This is also the start of the Vermont Long Trail, the oldest long distance hiking trail in America and the inspiration for the AT.  Vermont is also known as Vermud.  It didn't take long to figure out why.  The trail was pretty muddy. Except where is was grossly muddy.  To be fair there were occasional stretches of nice trail tread.  At some point I caught up with Roadrunner and we hiked together until it started to rain.  He stopped to put on his rain cover and I kept going.  I caught up with coyote and Banana when we got to the long section of irregularly spaced rock steps.  We all had the same plan: get off these steps before they get wet.  I got a thigh crushing workout getting down that mountain.  
It was pouring by the time we reached the road intersection.  Nothing to do but keep our heads down and hike.  I stopped at the Nauheim shelter but they kept going trying to make more miles because Roadrunners parents parents were coming from Canada to visit him.
I set my tent up in the rain and went to the shelter to cook dinner.  There were a couple of SOBOs in there telling us what to expect in New Hampshire and Maine.  We all had lots of questions.  What we came away with is that it will be hard but the experience of a lifetime.  By this time, much to everyone's relief, it had stopped raining. 
Soon enough it was hiker midnight so we all went off to to our tents, bunks, or hammocks.
Day 51
AT miles 12.8
Miles hiked 12.8
About 3 AM we had a big storm roll in. I was hoping the tent would hold up as hard as the wind was blowing and the rain was coming down.  I woke up about 6 when it stopped raining figuring I had a small window of opportunity to get packed up and eat before the rain came back. 
The plan was to do about 20 to get me closer to Manchester so I could do a resupply.  I ran into Jose who was slackpacking back to a hostel that was near where I planned to stop. After a bit we caught up to two guys from New York who were hiking the Long Trail.  We all hiked together planning to stop for lunch at the next shelter. 
On our way to the shelter a guy went flying past us up the mountain.  I thought he was a deranged trail runner.   The second trail runner I'd seen out in this nasty weather on this even nastier trail. Hard core.
I was surprised to see a crowd at the shelter when we arrived.  Unusual for the middle of the day.  Everybody made room for us to get out of the rain.  The crowd of people, including the aforementioned trail runners were all attending to a female hiker or runner.  The first trail runner who passed us turned out to be her husband.  The second was a medical guy.  The girl was a trail runner trying to set the Southbound FKT for the Long Trail.  She got caught out in the storm, got hypothermia and was dehydrated when she came past the shelter.  The hikers staying in the shelter gave her first aid and sent for help.  Apparently she was on pace to break the record when she broke down. 
Jose left because he was getting cold.  I cooked lunch so I could get something hot in me.  My mileage plans changed after 6 hours of hiking in the misting rain, wading through mud, slipping and sliding on rocks.  The thought crossed my mind that if this is America's oldest long distance hiking trail then by now the maintainers could have fixed some of the crappiest sections of trail instead of being proud of their mud bog.  But hey, that's just the midwest/southerner logic coming out in me.  What do I know about New Englanders?
I stopped instead at the Kid Gore Shelter where there weren't really any good tent sites.  Silver Back and Spiccoli convinced me to stay in the shelter since it was getting ready to storm again.  Hopefully, no other hikers show up.  Spiccoli entertained us with some rather excellent guitar playing and it wasn't long before we were out for the night.
Day 52
AT miles 15.2
Miles hiked 15.7
The morning sun woke us around 6 do we all crawled out of our quilts and started making breakfast.  The plan for the day was yo make it to Stratton Mountain, catch the gondola ride done to the bottom of the mountain, grab some lunch at the café, gondola back up then hike to Stratton Pond for the night. 
There would be no fast hiking this day.  But for good reasons.  
I was the last to leave the shelter and was enjoying the sunshine and extra warmth, but not so much the mud and slick rocks. After a couple hours a rather unusual hiker passed me.  Silver Back and I refer to her as the ""Woods Sprite"".  The first thing I noticed was that she was hiking barefoot.  She stopped to chat and I learnes she was hiking to her new job in Connecticut.  She was wearing a dress and carrying a skimpy bag.  She mentioned that she'd read the book about Grandma Gatewood and that book inspired her hike.  She said her trail name in Polish saying her family had immigrated from Poland.  She then translated her name for me to mean Sophia the Stubborn. We wished each other well and I kept thinking that may have been the strangest thing I've seen out here so far.
A bit farther up the trail I met a LASH who was nearly finished with his multi-year attempt at hiking the trail.
After these two delays all I could envision was Silver Back riding in a gondola down to the cafe for lunch and me eating the kast if my snacks.  I was practically running up yhe trail trying to catch him when I came to a road intersection with a trail magic sign.  Dilemma.  Skip thd trail magic to hopefully make the gondola ride or go for the sure thing.  Then Silver Back yelled to me.  Problem solved.  Bratwurst, corn on cob, chips and chicken buffalo dip, ice cold drinks, homemade cookies and great conversation with the trail angels and other hikers who showed up.  One of the trail angels was the 80th person to complete a thru hike of the AT.  Hiking royalty.
After a long stay and lots of food we were back on the trail.  And 2 miles later, more trail magic! More conversation, this time with former thru hikers who were also local trail maintainers.  
Well, definitely no gondola ride this day but I wasn't complaining.  Now for a looong climb up Stratton Mountain to climb the fire tower. The forest turned into a spruce forest near the top of the mountain and the air smelled like Christmas.  There was no view from the peak of the mountain but that all changed as soon as I started climbing the fire tower.  I felt like I could see forever!  The views were amazing.  I was lamenting yhe fact that my camera had died but yhen thought, ""let me give it one more try.""  It worked! My camera came back to life. So, back up the tower I went to hopefully capture some better pics.
It was starting to get late and we still had over 3 miles to Stratton Pond so off we went.  
Stratton Pond was a busy place with a crossover of SOBOs and NOBOs along with Long Trail hikers and weekenders.  Silver Back and I each found camping spots then went to the pond to filter some water.  Pond water is not my favorite but Orange Crush drink mix greatly improves the palatability. 
I seriously needed a resupply as I was totally out of snacks and breakfast and fuel.  An older couple came to the shelter and poured out their food bag and said take what you want because we are going home a day early to avoid the coming rain.  Included was a fuel canister.  Once again, the trail provides.
We cooked dinner at the shelter and traded trail info with the SOBOs.  Before long it was past hiker midnight and we all went off to bed.  
Day 53
AT miles 10.5
Miles hiked 10.8
Between the cool air and absence of the threat of rain, I slept really good not waking up until 7. I easily could have rolled back over and slept some more.  But, I needed to get moving because Silver Back and I were going to Manchester Center for resupply and we were splitting a room at the Aspen Motel.  As much as I needed food, Silver Back was in desperate need of shoes as the bottom of one of his shoes had separated from the top and he'd been hiking like that for a week.
It was more than 4 miles into town and farther than that to the motel so we tried our hand at hitching and in less  than 5 minutes a former thru hiker stopped and drove us to the motel. 
We took quick showers then walked into town to the outfitters then lunch.   I got some new socks, a sleeping bag liner. and pole tip covers for when I get to the White Mountains.
After that we ate a huge lunch at a Tex-Mex place then stopped at a gas station for snacks and headed back to the room to do laundry and rest.
After cleaning up and organizing my gear I went to work on updating my journal and photos between naps.  I was shocked at how far behind I'd gotten and felt bad because I know that family and friends are trying to follow my journey.
Silver Back was doing the same thing with his video journal.  
By the end of most hiking days all I really want to do is go to bed.  I try my best to keep up with the journaling so when I have wi-fi I can do an update.  Well, I have wi-fi so I'd better get to it.
Tomorrow we need to go back to the outfitters then the grocery store for trail food.  I also need to get a new SD card.Day 54

Zero day.   Ate a huge breakfast at the upstairs Cafe Went to the outfitters to do a sock exchange.  Darn Tough guarantees their dock wont get holes in them.  If they do they will excang the holy socks for new socks.  My feet are tougher than their darn socks.  I went to the library to send out the cross country training plan and fix my AT spreadsheet.  By then it was dinner time so back to the hotel to pack.  We ordered pizza for dinner and fell asleep watching some stupid movie on TV.
