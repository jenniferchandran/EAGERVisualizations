The temperature drops 3.5 degrees for every thousand feet of elevation. By the time I got to about 3500 feet it was a cold steady rain. Time to put on long sleeve wool shirt, rain coat , wool gloves with Gore-Tex mitts and a black beanie and zipped on my legs on my hiking pants. It was a wind driven rain and cold.

It held off for a couple hours then came heavy all day and cold. By the time we reached the shelter we were cold and soaked. Got into dry clothes and into sleeping bag for awhile. We got here at 2:00 . Once we cooked we were in our bags most of night. My air mattress is leaking. We’re into Port Clinton tomorrow, I’ll buy new one at Walmart and send mine home.

Hiking was good at times and really rocky at times. We saw the sun briefly. We had intermittent rain all day. The day finished with a long stretch of easy hiking and we got to the hostel at 2:30. I’ll wash clothes and shower and do a small resupply.  They have free waffles here for breakfast, so we made ours for breakfast and put them in refrigerator and made some more for supper.

We ran into a trail maintainer hiking south. He told us we had the Knifes edge coming up an gave a few pointers on going over it. We were soon there a huge rock formation that drops off on both sides. Of course it was raining to make things more interesting with slippery rocks! We took our time and got thru it. Water is a problem because we’re hiking ridges. So it’s drink a liter carry 2 or 3. In the afternoon we went down into Lehigh Gap and the had a steep 1000 foot climb in the rain again. This time it was technical and we’re carrying lots of water. Lots of hand over hand climbing, looking for 1/2 inch spots to put our feet on to work our way up sheer, wet rock wall formations. Pretty hairy but we took our time and got to the spot we’re tenting at. Just before a zinc Superfund site we’ll go by tomorrow. Sun when we got here but rain twice drove us into tents.

I think we’ve seen rain part or all of day 10 straight days. We broke camp at 6:30, walking through a Superfund site but you wouldn’t know it. We had the Pennsylvania rocks all day. It made for tough hiking. However we still made good time over 2 miles an hour cold an rainy again but not much water here so it saved us walking way off trail to get water. We got to a stealth campsite at 3:35 and the sun came out. No cell service though. We’ll get out of Pennsylvania tomorrow these rocks have been tough. We expect to get to Delaware Water Gap early afternoon. Todays miles 18.3.","

Trail was rocky again but we’re getting used to it, we were moving pretty good. I took a spill before Wolf rocks. Just a couple more scrapes and bruises.
