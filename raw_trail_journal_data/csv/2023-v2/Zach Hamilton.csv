Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661659,"Hello Everyone,Three days to go, and the nerves are definitely here. All the errands are done, and I just finished my final pack. A bunch of you have been asking where the journals are, and to you I say, I'm working on it. Apparently you need three entries before the account shows up. To get up to three, I'm going to do two today, and one after the first day on trail. I am not a writer, but I am going to try and document both the highs and the lows when I can. I hope everyone enjoys, or at least gives my mom some peace of mind that a bear has not yet eaten me. For the first entry, I figured I'd make a glossary of terms I'll be throwing around, and well as a couple of starting stats. 
For Photos, I'm going to make a public Google Photos Album, that seems a little easier than messing with HTML to include them here. To request access, please email zhamilton21893@gmail.com. If I don't add you, email me again, or text me. Please don't assume I'll add you without emailing me first, including you Granny. It will help me keep track of who I have added. 
AT- The Appalachian Trail. A foot path leading from Springer Mountain in Georgia, to Mount Katahdin in Maine. This year, the AT is 2,198.4 miles. Yeah, it changes every year don't worry about it.
ATC- Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the organization that oversees the maintenance, conservation, and advocacy for the preservation of the AT. The headquarters is in Harpers Ferry.
Thru Hiker- Somebody who thinks it's a good idea to try to hike the entire trail. Let it be known, even the people who started the trail did not anticipate people would walk the entire thing at once. About 1/5th of those who attempt a thru hike make it to Maine. 
NOBO- North Bound
SOBO- South Bound
Section Hiker - Backpackers who are out for short sections of the trail. 
LASH- ""Long Ass Section Hike"". It's like a section hike, but longer. 
Flip Flop- A light sandal with a throng between the bid and second toe.
Flip Flopper- A hiker that walks part way up the trail, then goes to the other side and walks back. The ATC considers a thru hiker anyone who walks the entire trail in a year, they don't care what order you do it. 
The Bubble- If you want to make it to Maine, there is a relatively narrow window of starting. Baxter State Park, home of Mount Katahdin, closes down in October. The Bubble is the mass of hikers that started in ""prime time"". I should be in the tail end of the bubble, hopefully. The ATC has a voluntary registry to help spread out the masses, and ideally keep it under FIFTY hikers in a day during peak. There are about 19 other hikers starting on the same day I am.
Blaze
- The bit of paint that marks a trail. Typically on a tree, but sometimes they get creative with placement. I've seen them on people's mailboxes. 
White- The AT's Blazes are white. Purists think if you don't pass every single white blaze your hike doesn't count.Blue- Side trails. They can lead to everything from water to views. Blue Blazers will sometimes skip sections of the AT with side trails. Yellow- The yellow marks on the highway. Yellow Blazers hitch hike or take shuttles ahead to skip sections of the trail. Pink- Pink blazers set their pace based on a potential romantic interest. I think Haley is technically a Pink Blazer. 
Trail Name- Most people wind up getting a trail nick name they go by instead of their real name. 
AWOL- Short hand for ""The A.T. Guide"". Written each year by a former hiker, whose trail name was AWOL
Tramily- The group of people you latch onto and hike with for extended periods of time. I think it's a dumb name and I refuse to use it. 
Zero- A day where you walk zero miles. Typically in a town. 
Nero- ""Near Zero"". A day you walk very few miles. Typically into a town you are staying in. 
Trail Magic- People who, out of kindness and with no expectation of repayment, do a kindness for hikers. This could be a well timed free ride into town, or a 6 pack of beer sitting by a tree. 
Trail Angel- People who do trail magic. 
Shelters- Shelters are spread out roughly every 8-12 miles on the AT. In some areas, you are required to camp around them. They typically are 3 walls and a roof. They range from modern and new to dilapidated.
HYOH- ""Hike your own hike"". It's backpacker speak for ""To each their own""  
Base Weight- They weight of your pack and all of your gear, minus food and water.
Ultra Light- A Base weight of under 10 pounds. I sprung for some ultra light gear, but I am nowhere near an Ultra Light hiker. These folks put out serious miles. 
Formatting- Something that's very easy to do on a computer, but not so easy on a phone. Don't expect every journal to be so nicely formatted. 

Starting base weight: 22 pounds
Starting weight: 200 pounds
Starting back packing experience: ~172 miles. 
Amount of blisters: Zero
Remaining toe nails: 10
Cigarettes per day: About half a pack

Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661710,"Hello All,Just a quick post, to get up to that magic three entry number to be easier to find. To test out some of the new gear, I went on a two day in and out hike. Starting at Dahlgren campgrounds. If anybody wants to try out backpacking, I really recommend the Maryland AT section. Dahlgren is basically the halfway point, has free hiker parking, AND has a free hot shower. The Maryland section takes 3-4 days depending on your speed. You can pack a couple days worth of supplies and then restock at your car at the halfway point.Nothing too exciting on the shakedown, as I've done all of Maryland 3 times now. The Washington Monument is always nice to stop at for lunch, but there was an entire swarm of 6th graders there for a field trip. I ate my lunch as fast as I could, and kept it moving. The next stop was Pine Knob shelter. I met some interesting people that were camping there for the night. First, Nomad. He is technically homeless, and lives on the trail. He has been living on the trail for about 3 years now if I remember correctly, but this was the first time he wintered over. I'd be lying if I said he didn't give me some weird vibes, but he seemed mostly harmless, and we had some good talks. I also met Magpie. She was somewhere between 60-70 years old, and was a self proclaimed ""FLASHER"" (LASH+Flip Flopper). She is trying to do the whole trail this year, but seems to be doing it in no particular order. She was great for giving some early thru hike trips. After chatting with them for a bit, I moved on to the nights camp, Annapolis Rock. It's a great view, and has plenty of campsites. It's also within day hiking distance of Greenbriar state park, which has a nice campsite with an artificial lake than can be seen from the rocks. Being way out of the bubble on a weekday, I had the whole place to myself. Alcohol is not allowed on the trail in Maryland, so I did not enjoy a nice sip of brandy with dinner on the rocks. (Pictures on the Google Drive, if you haven't requested access to that).One tip I read once that taking pictures of scenery is nice, but what you should make sure you get is pictures of the people you meet. I didn't get Nomad or Magpie, so we aren't off to a good start. However, Magpie said we will try to meet back up at Trail Days, a hiking festival, in Damascus. Trail days is in April, and hikers will often hitch hike back or forwards to attend. Side note, I have suddenly developed a taste for bluegrass/folk music. Trying to get in the Appalachian mood I guess. ",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Fri",0
Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661711,"Hello All,Entry number 3, hopefully I should show up on the list now. It's the day before flying down to Georgia, and I absolutely should not be taking time out of the day to write journal entries. Here's the plan for the next couple of days.Friday 4/7 -Errands, Errands, Errands. I've been running around the last week, but I somehow still have plenty of things to do. -Last night at home for a while. Going to spend it with Haley and The Cat. I have a cat sitter coming to live at the apartment until Haley gets back, she will be here Sunday.Saturday 4/8-8:00 flight to Georgia. We were trying to figure out how to get from the Atlanta Airport to the trail, about 80 miles away. After looking into shuttles, and trying to figure out how much an Uber would set us back, I realized I know a guy. During the early COVID lock down, a friend and I were playing a game online, and got grouped with a random guy. He was funny, and way better than us at the game, so we grouped up and played a few rounds with him. Fast forward a few years, and I still play with him occasionally. ""Hey, didn't you mentioned you lived in Georgia?"". Just like that, we had a place to stay Saturday and a ride to the trail. For those of you worried about a bear taking me out, meeting up with a guy from online and going into the woods is WAYYYYY more exciting. Sunday 4/9-Wake up as early as I can convince our host to, drive an hour to Amicola visitor's center. Get signed in, get my number, and get a picture next to the famous arch.-The original plan was to hike the approach trail. About 9 miles of trail before the AT even starts. It's a very hard first day. Unfortunately, with Haley's schedule, it makes sense for us to skip the approach trail and jump straight to Springer. -Get back in the car, drive another hour to the top of Springer.-Walk south for half a mile.-Turn around, walk north for 2200ish miles. ",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Fri",0
Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661975,"Hello Everyone!I'm going to try to do these often, but it's hard to find time to write, AND wifi at the same time. Going forward, I'll probably try to type notes for the day before bed, and copy paste them all here in batches. Remembering the details of the last few days is already getting tough. I think going in with low expectations was the way to go, because every expectation has been exceeded. ""If I gave every view the attention it deserved, I'd never get anywhere"" - Gary Sizer, I have said that to Haley so many times already, that I've taken to just saying ""Gary"" as shorthand when we need to get moving. Pictures do not do it justice. I had intended to caption all the photos, but we will see how that goes. Spirits are high, feet are still whole, and I'm feeling optimistic. I've also been named ""The Navigator"", see day 2 for story. Here's a recap of the last few days. Day 1: Springer Mountain to Hawk Mountain-Ellerbee, a contact in Georgia I had from an online shooter of all places, volunteered to pick us up from the airport and give us a place to stay and a ride to the trail. He wound up having work, so his partner Lauren drove us around for errands and to the trail the next day. We got extremely lucky with our start day, as the previous day had ludicrous amounts of rain.  We started at Amicolala to register our hikes, and get the famous arch photo. I am hiker #2388 for the season. After getting checked in, we got right back in the car and skipped the approach trail (it's not officially part of the trail). I was a little bummed about it, but Haley's schedule worked better if we skipped it. I've heard from other hikers that it was a beast of a climb, and nobody has had anything nice to say about it. Our ride Lauren took her little Hyundai up one of the most treacherous service roads I have ever seen (topped only by the road our bus got stuck on in Peru). I was a nervous wreck in the back seat, I can't imagine how driving it was. Thanks Lauren!We had to back track a mile to get to the start of the trail, but we couldn't start skipped blazes already. Day 1 was a relatively easy start, but I could already tell I am not in the best shape.We met Olive, who I have dubbed All Terrain Boston. Her and her owner, Oyster, are trying to day hike the whole trail, staying in her vehicle at night. She gave us our first trail magic, a Doctor Pepper. We met a few characters. I can't include everybody, but here are the ones who have spent time with us so far. Megan and Poncho. They travel full time, and intended to do the Pacific Crest Trail, but decided 3 weeks ago to switch to the AT. Lynx- A girl with way too heavy of a pack. She got off trail the next morning to go to town to switch up gear. We were the last ones to leave camp in the morning. We woke up at about 6, and hung around since we knew we had a relatively short day. Day 2: Hawk Mountain to Gooch ShelterFarout is an awesome app for back packing. It tells you just about every thing you need to know along the trail. Shelters, water sources, particularly good views, and elevation. Talking with a few people in the morning, I told everyone it should be a relatively easy day. (It was not).Along the trail, we met Droobe. We were immediately envious, as he was gliding along the trail. He also has amazing dreadlocks, and looked every bit what you expect a long distance hiker to look like.  We immediately knew he had done at least one long distance trail before. Turns out, this is his first back packing trip, and he is from Perry Hall! We met a fellow named Chris, whom we had dubbed Two Pack. He isn't very social, so he hasn't accepted the name yet, but it's what everybody knows him as. You may guess, but it's because he has two packs. Im not an expert, and I don't want to talk bad about the guy, but everybody is worried. His two packs come off his body by about 3 feet, must weight 70 pounds. He is wearing jeans and army boots. When we passed him, he asked where the next water source was, I told him ""3 miles, and all down hill"" (It was not) (Between this, and my morning prediction for our day, I had earned my trail named, nominated  by Poncho, and unanimously decided by vote on the night of day 2)Day two was very challenging. I'm slow going on the uphills, and Haley struggles with the downhills. Day 3: Gooch to Lance CreekDay 3 was not as physically demanding as day 2, but nothing has been a walk in the park so far.  Uphills suck, but they are very frequent. However, the moments between the ups and the downs make everything worth it. When you can put away the poles, walk and just take everything in.  If you are following my photos, you'd assume the trail is flat. That's because I'm too busy watching my feet and gasping for air to take pictures anywhere but the flat sections. Day 3 was the first day we spent time walking with other people. It's interesting, when we walk alone, we are pretty slow, but once you get a good march going with a group, it's easier to keep a good pace. We walked with Matt, Paisley the dog, Paisleys owners whose name neither I nor Haley remember, and Steve. We camped at lances creek, our first campsite without a shelter, privy, or bear box. About 10 of us shared a fire, expertly made by Steve. Watching him work a fire is better than tv. His name came to me. I put it to a votie, and again by unanimous consensus, Steve became ""Bushwhack"".The night ended on a high note, when out of Nowhere Lynx rolled into camp, with a pack 15 pounds lighter. I was not expecting her to catch up so soon, and she most definitely earned the applause she got stumbling in. Most of the night, the talk was on Blood Mountain, the boss fight of Georgia. It's the highest peak in the state, and nobody was sure if they were ready.The fire and comraderie started to slow, and when hiker midnight (8:00) came we all made our way to bed, to rest up for Blood Mountain. That's all for now (because it's 10:30). Next update soon.Happy Trails,The Navigator","

Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662269,"Disclaimer 1: I wrote an excellent journal entry today. It took about an hour. It was a master piece. The best journal entry in the world. Near the end, the webpage refreshed, all was lost. This is not the best journal entry in the world, this is just a tribute. 
Disclaimer 2: Haley has had some sorm issues along the way. We agreed to not write about them until she was done, as to not scare anybody. *SPOILER*  Haley has finished her section safe and sound. During our trip, there was always at least one road crossing in a day. We made sure to regularly check in and make sure she was able and willing to keep going. She is a trooper, and I would've quit if I was in her shoes. 
Day 4: Lance's Creek to Blood Mountain (7.2 miles) 
Lance's Creek was our first camp not at a shelter. That means we didn't have modern amenities, like a privy. Pro tip for your aspiring back packers out there, dig your cat hole the night before. 
As I've mentioned, uphill sucks. It feels like my calves are going to explode the whole time. Luckily, for the most part the days have started with some warm up time before the ups. Unfortunately, the start of the climb to Blood Mountain starts at Lance's Creek. 5 miles of increasingly steep uphill. 
On day 3, Haley started to have some issues with her knees, as well as blisters. That makes down hill pretty bad for her, so she was my cheerleader for most of the day. About a quarter of the way up, we met some older gentlemen, one in his 60's and one early seventies. We talked for a bit, then the hurt our pride by shooting ahead at about four times our pace. 
As a whole, Blood Mountain wasn't as bad as everyone expected, and the peak made it worth it. Our first 360 degree view. The only word I can think of to describe it is vast. The Blood Mountain Shelter is at the actual peak of the mountain, and was a cabin made of stone without a door. It's the first shelter I've seen that wasn't the three sided wooden design. 
We stayed at the peak for about 30 minutes with Matt, Bushwhack, Tell and his dog Paisley, and Brenda. Brenda is a section hiker with a slow pace, but long days. She is walking to the N.C. line. 
The way down was rockier than what we've experienced so far. About halfway down, Haley fell. I heard, turned around, and saw her head on a rock. Turns out, she fell as gracefully as possible, and only rolled over onto the rock to take her pack off. She somehow managed to land without so much as a scratch. 
At the bottom of Blood Mountain is Neel Gap, home of the famous Mountain Crossing Outfitter. The trail literally runs through the outfitter, under an arch between their bunk house and the shop. The outfitter blew me away, and I was more impressed by it than our earlier summit. All of it's employees are former thru hikers. The atmosphere is perfect, and I can't imagine a better business and location. 
As soon as we arrived Bill ""The Pack Whisperer"" grabbed Haley. He could tell immediately she needed some advice. He told her she was ""a mess"", but quickly upgraded that to ""a hot mess"". He said she wasn't wearing her pack, she was carrying it. I didn't escape either. He grabbed me and did what I have dubbed ""the kidney inspection"". He jammed his fingers, not at all gently, into my side. Turns out I did have hips, and they are about 4 inches higher than where I was wearing my pack. After resupplying, my pack was a few pounds heavier, but felt lighter with his adjustments. 
We hung out for an hour or more with the other hikers congregating on the porch. We heard good things about the outfitters pizza, but opted to skip as we were going into town. Before we left, I did see one come out. It was a Red Baron frozen pizza. I could tell because it was served on the box. 
Matt, Bushwhack, Haley and I split a shuttle into Blairesville. Out shuttle driver Jeff was a nice fellow, and gave us the tour of the town before dropping us off. He recommended staying at The Seasons Inn, and I'm glad we did. They definitely cater to hikers. We got to dig through our first hiker box. A place where hikers leave gear and food they don't want. 
We are at Lucky's Cantina. The food and drinks were excellent. The vibe was great as well, with just the right amount of skeletons hanging from the walls. 
Day 5: Neels Gap to Low Gap (11 miles)
Some people take trail magic VERY seriously. We were racing the rain all day, and Haley's knees and feet were bothering her. We were going down for what seemed like forever. I was convinced the next shelter was going to be an under ground vault as sea level. 
As we hit the bottom, we found a parking lot, with fold out tables, lawn chairs, and what was for all practical purposes a buffet. King Tut and Georgia Bird have been setting up here for over a decade. They had snacks, hot and cold drinks, medical supplies, and best of all, a panini press. They also had free ultra light towels, and hats made by there churches women's group. They asked us to sit down, and i expected the conversion attempt to start. Instead, they gave us a short lecture on trail safety. They went as far as to tell us how to stay safe as trail days in Damascus, to avoid the areas where hard drugs would be, but if we did to stay in these certain areas where the cops turn a blind eye. They are the definition of trail angles, and wouldn't accept any type of donation.
I also learned where I sit on the purist scale. Immediately after was a half mile, 900 elevation scramble. Since the weather was turning, they offered to drive us up the road where the trail crosses to avoid the climb. It felt weird to skip even a mile, so instead they took Haley and my pack to the crossing. I slack packed the mile with only trekking poles. I flew up the climb, and literally ran the next half mile to make up for lost time. 
Day 6: Low Gap to Blue Mountain (7.3 miles)
We had our first all night rain. I woke up to what I thought was a leaking tarp, but it was actually just condensation dripping on my face. I have to unpack everything to repack my pack, and doing all that under my tarp was definitely something I have to work on. 
We got a pretty earlier start, but besides that not that much happened. We saw a tree with bear scratches. We walked up, we walked down. 
We got to Blue Mountain Shelter early, and spent several hours hanging with the normal crew, with a couple extras. Brenda kept going, as her husband was picking her up to take her into town for a day at the next stop. 
Pancho and Megan were at the shelter, and let us know they were getting off trail. 
Toward the end of the night, the shelter gathered around and watched as we removed Haley's pinky toe bandages. She almost got the trail name ""Gangrene"".
I had my first really scary night. I had set my hammock up and went to bed. During the night, a storm started to roll in. The wind picked up, and I realized I made a very rookie mistake. I set up my hammock on a ridge with nothing to break the wind. I thought my tarp was going to blow away. I broke camp, and hap hazardly moved everything to the shelter. I didn't have a sleeping mat, so I did my best to make a nest on the wood floor with clothes and my quilt. Just as I was finally falling asleep, I heard a sound. I turned on my headlamp and their was a mouse about a food from my face, with four of his buddies scurrying around behind him. 
Day 7: Blue Mountain to Sassafrass Gap (13 miles)
A wonderful and a terrible day. 
Lets get the bad out of the way. The day was long and hard. We climbed 2.5 mountains (we started the day at the top of one). Haley was in pretty rough shape, but refused to get off trail. She is an absolute trooper, and I would have quit if I was in as bad of shape as her. The muscles in my calves were reaching the failure point, and we had to stop every 100 feet or so going uphill. In total, we did about 4000 feet of elevation change (I rounded the numbers when doing the math, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).
The good. It was a day of magic. We hit FOUR hiker feeds. There was a trail magic turf war we hit at about 9:30 am. A former thru hiker and his family have been setting up in the same spot for 11 years. This year a church group moved in. The thru hiker offered to combine and do one big feed. The church group refused. The church group also makes sure to get there earlier to set up closer to the trail to be the first people hikers pass. Unlike the previous church group, they were very preachy. I don't like being proselytized, I feel like it takes away from the generosity. To me, it feels like doing something generous with the express purpose of getting into heaven takes away from the goodness of the deed. I still ate their hot dog though, so my morals can be bought with food. 
The second group was a lot more chill, and fed us even more. They offered us beer, but it was 9:30 so we didn't partake. Haley did take two for the road. He suggested we put them in the stream at camp to cool down. 
We hit another hiker feed, then another. The last of the day was absolutely wild. They had music, pop up tarps, a spread of food, and local craft beers. It was a former thru hiker and some friends. They have been setting up for a few years, but only for one weekend a year. We lucked out. They told us their goal was ""inspiring zeros"". They tried to get more hikers each year to stop for a day and camp with them. I had an IPA and a burger with sausage gravy on it. So far, the hardest mile of the trip was walking away from that group. 
We got into camp just before sunset, almost literally at a crawl. I've said it before, but Haley is a beast. The determination on that last mile, when her body was nearing failure, was something I hated to see, but will always admire. We drank our beer warm. 
Day 8: Sassafrass Gap to Dicks Creek (7 miles)
Because of the extra miles, we got to do a short day to our next destination. We were still exhausted from the previous day, so though short, it was not easy. What should have been a relatively pleasant hike still kicked out butt. We got to Dick's creek at about 2:45, to catch a free shuttle into town at 5:30. After we got comfy, Haley realized the shuttle only runs on week days. 
We lucked out an a couple was getting a shuttle to a nearby shuttle. Dick's creek has no reception, so I asked if we walked to the hostel if we could use their phone. They did one better, and shoved the four of us into the van to drive us there. Once there, they offered to shuttle us to town, along with some other hikers already at the hostel, to town for $5 each. They also sold the head lamp I had left behind at a previous shelter. 
Matt, Bushwhack, Haley, and I got to Hiawassee and had dinner at Hiawassee Brew,Andrew, a hiker we had run into at Blairesville joined us. I wasn't as charmed by Hiawassee as I was Blairesville, but the brewery was the highlight of the shoe. Great beer, and one of the best burgers I've had. 
Day 9: Hiawassee ( 0 miles)
We took our first zero, and boy did we need it. We did errands, and ate a lot. Haley fed me and the boys all day long. She's grown quite attached to our little group, and it's not making our parting tomorrow any easier. 
On a high note, at the last possible moment, Haley got her trail name by some hikers we were hanging out with in the parking lot of the budget inn.
We were talking, and they recognized her form some hiker gossip. Apparently, word has spread about a girl who carried two Miller Lights in her side pocket up two mountains. 
Writing this twice has taken way too much of our last night together for a while, I'm going to go spend some time with my lady, Miller. 
Happy trails,

Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662305,"Day 10: Hiawassee to Bly Gap (9 miles)I started the morning with an iced coffee. Sure it was a gas station ice coffee, but it beats Folgers instant coffee any day. Side note, Georgian gas stations are wild. It had a mini casino, every type of smoking implement I could think of, beer, and a really good selection of snacks. We got in our shuttle and headed back to the trail after a very needed zero day. We had a great time in town. Getting on trail was tough today, because Haley didn't come with us. We said our good byes on the side of the road and parted ways. With my hiking partner now on her road trip, I had to keep up with Matt and Bushwhack for the day, and I did! They go at ever so slightly faster of a pace than I. I can run with them, but I can't take many moments to take in the scenery. The goal tomorrow is to wake up earlier and get a head start so I can enjoy my morning walk without quite as much cardio. Ended the day early, but with a big mile stone. This trail journal is brought to you live from North Carolina! With our first border crossing in the bag, spirits are high. I even treated myself and broke out the Mio. I told myself I was going to save it until I was bored or water, but I don't have champagne. It'll do.Happy TrailsNavigator ","

Addendum to 4/18
I wrote yesterday's entry earlier in the evening, but it was a very, very eventful night. 
We shared a campfire with Bobcat and Pilgrim. Pilgrim is a 70 year old, who tries to do something challenging and active every 5 years. This year was the AT. He is a spry old man, and very kind. 
After dinner, everyone except me went to hang their food bags. There is a new preferred method of hanging called the PCT method. I can't tell you more, because I use an Ursack and just tie it to any old tree before bed. Bushwhack was going to show Bobcat how to do it, so they were gone for a bit. Then they were gone for a while. 
Matt finally comes back up, and I ask if everything is alright down there?
""Pilgrim fell out of a tree""
For those of you that don't know, hanging a bear bag does not involve climbing a trees.
Apparently, Pilgrim's cord got stuck on a limb, and he decided to climb up and get it out. As I mentioned, he is a spry man, so by the time anybody noticed he was up. The branch broke. 
Long story short, he could tell immediately his collar bone was fractured. Since I was the only one who had reception, I stayed up the hill and communicated with 911. 
Long story short, he used to do search and rescue. They got him back up to camp and he walked us through the first aid. He stayed in high spirits the whole time. After 2 hours, search and rescue showed up with ATVs and got him out. 
Before he was evacced, he agreed to change his name to ""High Dive""
Obviously a lot more happened, during the time, but it was quite an event. Below is the update I received from him today. (He encouraged us to tell the story, and even forfeited the copyright for the movie. 
Hey Nav 
Thank you guys for all the great support and work that you did with me last night. I've now traveled in three states within 24 hours-Georgia, North Carolina and I am in Chattanooga Tennessee at a trauma center.
The damage report is as following: five fractured ribs in the back with one of those ribs fractured in the front. Also have a fractured collarbone and my right ankle is swollen. I am surprised that I am not in significant pain. My pain rating is a one and I haven't been on any pain medication, all of this is good and I've been very blessed.
What were those Trail names given to me last night. Also, where are my trekking poles given to the rescuers. I've got my pack, but not my trekking poles. They may have bounced out on the way down last night. Oh, were you able to let the other hiker know what happened to me?
Again thank you so much you guys were superb. All of you did the right thing and now I have great stories to tell about your hike on the Appalachian Trail.
4/19: Bly Gap to Beach Gap (12 miles)
Despite being up late waiting for search and rescue, I woke up feeling very rested. I got a head start on the group, and flew through the first few miles. 
I've mentally started compartmentalizing big climbs. What I do is look for a tree or rock about 100 feet away. My rule is I won't stop until I reach it but I won't walk past it without stopping for as long as I need. Typically that winds up being a couple seconds, just long enough to find the next spot. Sometimes 30 seconds to stretch the calves. 
 I'm not going to say I've already got trail legs, but the calve pain was very minor even on some steep ups to start the morning. I even forgot to do my routine of picking stop points for most of it. I also think walking alone in the morning at my own pace helped. It was very peaceful, and I think I'm going to try to walk by myself before lunch when I wake up early enough. 
Yesterday, we met a hiker going SOBO just prior to the NC border who congratulated us, and warned us we were about to get ""Bitch Slapped and Humbled by NC.""
We had a big climb toward the end of the day. After a long lunch to let Bushwhack rest from some hip pains, My glow from the morning was gone. I was feeling full, lazy, and for the first time so far, really dreading our first big climb of NC. 
Turns out, North Carolina doesn't mind switch backs. It was very easy, and we didn't stop until the top. Sure it took 3 times as long as the Georgia method of going straight up, but it definitely felt better. We were standing at our highest elevation yet, just north of 5000 feet. Bush, Matt and I spent about 20 minutes hanging out at the peak, taking pictures, and having a good time. We still had 3 miles to go, and were running short on light so we couldn't stay long. 
I had some of my first annoying pains today. The dreaded chub rub. It didn't slow me down too much, but I'm hoping it calms down by tomorrow. 
In addition to Bobcat, a few new people joined us for our nightly entertainment of watching Bushwhack work his fire. A couple of former through hikers doing a section, and a couple named Namastay, and Namago. They are a married couple also attempting to thru. We are all aiming for the same camp tomorrow.
It was good to have some new people we got along with around. It also let us hear some new stories and gossip. There are already a few new AT legends being made even this early. I've talked about Walmart, but it seems like everyone also has a story about Billy McDab.
For anyone who doesn't know (I'm hardly an expert myself) a dab is concentrated THC. You can guess where the name comes from. In no particular order, here are some of McDabs exploits. 
-During the shakedown by the rangers, they made him switch his mason jar for of dabs to a plastic one.
-He made pemmican for the trail. It's made him very sick.
-He only brought water purification tablets that take 4 hours to use. (I'm not even sure where you find tablets that slow). During one of his pemmican sicknesses, a woman found him waiting for his water to purify. After giving him some electrolytes, he  offered her a dab in exchange. 
- I have only met him once, very briefly. He told me his name, and I said ""Oh I've heard of you"" quick small talk and then we parted ways. After a couple of minutes I realized he was walking the wrong way. 
 
This is getting long today, but I'm having trouble sleeping. I believe two owls are having an argument outside of my tent. I'm hearing some heavy steps in the woods. Matt might be peeing, or it might be a bear idk. I'm going to try to get some sleep, as we are aiming for another 12 miles tomorrow. 
4/20: Beach Gap to Rock Gap (15 Miles)
It was a very eventful 36 hours. 
I had some trouble getting to sleep. No particular reason, and I was probably only up for an extra 30 minutes. When I fell asleep, I was out. Until somebody started yelling at 4:30. 
My first thought was ""What kind of asshole hoots and hollers at 4:30 in the morning"". My second thought was ""Oh no somebody is yelling at 4:30 in the morning"".
Turns out a bear was doing the rounds. He got 3 out of the 6 bags at camp, including mine.  Once people started getting out of their tents it ran off. 
I don't really do gear reviews, but I'm gonna go ahead and give the Ursack Major XL a 1 out of 5 stars. Did not survive first contact with a black bear. The knot was tied well and held up. The bear instead went directly through the bag. The only things that survived were half a pack of smokes, my spoon, and my mug is damaged but useable (it looks pretty cool with the tooth dents). It ate my tooth brush. 
Matt and Bushwhack's bag hang probably saved the remainder of the hikers food. You can tell the bear spent a lot of time trying to get there's. See the photo drive for the after math. It actually cut their line but couldn't get to the bag. It broke a tree and tore up another one in the attempt. Because it cut their line, we had to make a spear and cut their bags down.
We had two options to get to town. And 8 mile day, and a 15 miler. I was not gonna let a glorified racoon ruin my day, so I threw in my vote to earn our zero with a big 15 mile day. 
We had seen comments on Farout that bear activity had been high in this stretch, and when we got to the next shelter 4 miles away, they had also been hit around midnight. We think it was the same bear. 
Halfway through the day, we got to Albert Mountain, and one of the first fire watch towers on trail. 
I've used the word ""climb"" to describe mountains so far. I feel like that may take away from saying this was a CLIMB. 
At a few spots, I had to throw my trekking poles ahead and climb up with my hands. The hard part was only the last half mile, but it was a beast. I had to stop every few steps. 
The view at the top was worth it. The room on the tower is closed due to vandalism, but you can still climb the steps. The slightest breeze gave me vertigo at that height. I'm taking a selfie everyday to do the beard time lapse at the end. You'll be able to tell the day because I look like I jumped into a swimming pool, and was subsequently beaten.
That was only the first half of the day though. 
We had a shuttle coming at 6:30. I think it was around 1:30. We had 7 miles to go. I took a last look around from the peak, and had my first ""Gary"" of the day. The boys were resting, and I went ahead full speed for the head start. 
Matt's pace has really picked up, and he typically gets to the next break point way before us. I decided since I was getting a head start, it was my turn to be first. 
I really turned it on, but after about 20-30 minutes, Bush almost ran me over. He was power walking like one of those ladies you see at 9:00am on a Saturday in the mall.
He didn't even slow down, he just said ""If I stop I'll die"", and zoomed past. 
I should mention, Matt is an awesome dude. We've been having a good time, and he hasn't done something to even annoy me a little bit. But sometimes, when you are really struggling, you're brain will latch onto something for motivation. In this case, it was ""F*** Matt"". I was going to beat him to our stop. 
Eventually, things started going numb, but I was in the zone. Also maybe a little manic. I literally started running at one point. I caught up to Bush, and both of us started running. I was using my poles to vault over rocks. Coincidentally, right about them Haley texted me to be careful. I was not. 
We wound up at a shelter, and I realized shelters are not directly on the trail. In a classic Nav move, I made a wrong turn during our frantic sprint. It only cost us maybe a quarter mile, but it broke the spirit. 
Maybe another half mile further, we stopped with 2.5 miles to go. Bush set a 5 minute timer so Matt didn't catch up. He got there with 2.5 minutes left on the timer. We checked our pace, even with the running, we beat our normal 2 mile average by about 7 minutes. Time and miles make no sense to me. 
With that, my second wind ended. The third wind did not come. The last 2.5 miles could be described as rapidly falling forward and catching myself with my poles. Saying I shambled would be generous. Blisters were popping up and my thighs were starting to chafe. 
We were going through my favorite terrain. Relatively flat with Rhododendron tunnels. I didn't take in any of the view, and it was not peaceful. During the haze, I passed a significant milestone. Somebody had made a 100 mile marker out of leaves and sticks. Gary.
We got to our stop about 40 minutes early and took a shuttle into town. I called Haley, and fell asleep on the phone after a few minutes. The shower was nice. 
We are taking a zero today, I'm going to go with a hang bag this time. Having a good day so far, and I'm nowhere near as beat up as I expected. Definitely hitting the local bar later, The Lazy Hiker. It feels fitting. 
Luckily, since we got off early, our next resupply will be in about 3 days, so a bit lighter packs. Nantahala Outdoor Center, here we come. 
Happy Trails

P.S. I wonder how Gary Sizer would feel about me invoking his name when I don't have time to enjoy things. Sorry Green Giant. ","

Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662887,"Hello All,As per usual, I've been surprisingly busy for somebody who has no job and lives in the woods. Here's the last few days journal entries. Spoiler, it gets gross and ends in a cliff hanger. 4/21 Franklin NC (Zero Miles)I said I'd write the good and the bad. Sleeping alone and feeling beat up from the surprise 15 mile day wasn't great. The loneliness kicked in for the first time. There's a few hundred miles to go before visits from Haley start becoming at all possible, and another few hundred before they are feasible. I miss the cat too. I think I've decided that assuming I make it to MD, I'm not going to go home until I'm done. I don't want to pop in and then have her upset when I leave again. My rule I set for myself is I'm not going to think about getting off until I have 3 really bad days. If that point comes, I'll start pondering my options. So far, we haven't had one of those days yet. That's enough of the bad for now though. Franklin really caters to the hiking crowd, and it seems like it's a big part of the towns identity. They have a hiker shuttle that you can call for in town rides for $1 per person. We took full advantage. Our first stop was the laundromat. Bushwhack did a weird amount of research on them, and insisted we go to the further away one because ""it had better reviews"".A woman came over and asked if we were thru hikers. It's a weird question actually. At the time of this conversation, we had walked 105 miles. 4.7% of the trail. That seems to early to claim to be a thru hiker. I wonder what mile I'll go from ""I hope so"" to ""yes""Anyway, we talked for a while, and she asked if we were keeping a blog. Turns out, yes I am. I gave her my information so she can follow along. I'm also very rude, and forgot to get her name. Laundromat woman, if you're reading this, it was great meeting you.To replace my food and gear we went to Outdoor 76. The place is awesome, they even have a hiker lounge in the basement. It's great. It consists of four lawn chairs and a coin operated washer and dryer. That's it. My standards are rapidly falling. The store has a map of the entire trail. It must have been 10 feet long. Matt could cover the portion we have hiked with his fingers. He was super amped about it, I had a minor feeling of doom. To each their own. We did some other chores, and wound up at The Lazy Hiker. The brewery is awesome, the beer is good, and food truck food hit the spot. We ran into Ivan and Ricky, whom Haley and I met on the first night out. We have run into them a couple times, but they joined us for a couple of beers. Since the shuttle only operated until 3:30, we walked 2 miles back to our motel. Two whole miles on a zero day. How messed up is that?4/22 Franklin to Wine Spring Camp (12 miles)Not a whole lot to write about today. Which is good because it's cold and I want to get under my quilt. We went up, we went down. I was super excited to cross our first Bald, a mountain with no trees. The AT went through about 30 feet of it and then back into the woods. Bushwhack taught me how to do the PCT hang, since I now have to hang bags (Thanks again Ursack). It's actually pretty neat. Kevlar may not have been able to stop a bear, but let's see how it handles a carabineer and a stick.Monday and Tuesdays night time lows look to be about 21 degrees. Really going to test out the sleep system. Bushwhack's hip is really bothering him, to the point he is starting to worry if it will take him off trail. He bought a new pack at the outfitter, which will hopefully help. We are planning on a short 8 mile day, which I hope gives him some more time to recover. 4/23: Wine Spring to Cold Spring: 8 MilesI keep telling myself that I'm going to write these every night, because things blend together and it's hard to keep track of what happened when. This entry is written on 4/28, 5 days after the fact. At this point, writing sort of happens by committee. I'm still with Bushwhack and Matt, and we brain storm what exactly we did. Wyah Bald was one of the more touristy feeling views we have had, but that didn't take away from it at all. Some civilization is good to break up the trees. There is a gravel road that leads up to a parking lot with a stone fire tower. It seems to be a pretty well visited spot, and for good reason. Unlike the last fire tower, this one had full access, but was a lot shorter. It still offered commanding, 360 degree view of the area. It seems like at some point there may have been a fire, or heavy deforestation. A significant portion of the trees were dead or dying, but the under growth was alive and well. From the tower, you could actually see where the trees filled out again. There were a lot of informational signs, which I absolutely did not take the time to read. I did however take pictures, so if you want the history get it from the drive.Bushwhack's hip was still bothering him, so Matt and I got to the tower sooner. Matt let me know that he is considering getting off the trail at Clingman's Dome, the 200 mile mark. it was pretty surprising, since he seems to be excelling at this more than Bush or I. He just doesn't feel like he is getting much out of it. Valid enough reason in my opinion. Since Bush had been in pretty low spirits due to his hip, he asked to keep it between us for now. Bush caught up, we got some group pictures, and carried on to Coldspring Campsite. Cold Spring lived up to its name. It was freaking cold. We sat around Bushwhack's fire with a couple other people. Ash, whom we had met in passing once or twice. Hello, whom is cool, but was doing 16-18 mile days. She ditched her group because they were too slow for her. I assume I will never see her again at that pace. Finally, Bean and Bell. I honestly can't remember which one is which. One is a nice young lady, the other is a Jack Russel mix. They are trying a thru hike as well.The lady was nice to talk to, and the dog was a good morale booster. However, despite wearing a sweater, the dog was shivering pretty heavily. I felt horrible, and gave it my puffy to wear for a while.That night, it got so cold we had to sleep with our water filters and electronics. 4/24 Cold Spring to Nantahala Outdoor Center (11 Miles)Waking up is a bit of a process. First, my legs are extremely stiff. I have to lay in my hammock and stretch them out before I can even consider getting up. Once I get the blood flowing, I realize it's too cold and go back to sleep. I'll repeat that process 2-3 times.Once I managed to get out of bed, typically during or right after sun rise, I put on all my warm clothes and make coffee and breakfast. With a warm mug in my hand, and a pop tart, I'm ready to delay starting my day.After a sufficient delay, normally about an hour, I'll pack up camp and get moving. About halfway through the day, I came to Wesser Bald. It has the scariest looking fire tower. At this point, I've survived a bear encounter, so I wasn't going to let structural stability stop me. The railings were rusted and visible leaning. The watch platform was made of very old 2x. Despite it's looks, it was a a tually extremely stable, and an excellent spot for lunch. The highlight of the day was ridge walking. Previously, ridge walking had been relatively flat ground, where I can see the mountain start to go down on either side. It's nice. This time was pretty wild though. The ridge was probably only about 8 feet wide, with the trail being about 2 feet wide in the middle. The ridge didn't ""drop off"" per day, but it didn't go down at a pretty good incline almost immediately. When the ridge ended, it looked like the trail would literally walk off a cliff. Turns out it wasn't too far off, and the way down was pretty steep and rocky. At what looked like the end of the trail, the trail turned sharply right and down. Standing before that turn was awesome, in the literal sense of the word, and also a bit scary. Some wind blew, and I instinctively leaned backed as far as I could. It gave me a sense of vertigo. Talking to the boys later, they had similar experiences with it. The original plan was to stay at the shelter before the NOC, but Bush and I agreed that if there is a room literally on the trail, we should take advantage of it. By the time we got to the campsite, Matt had already set up his tent. When we told him we had a bunk, he happily tore everything down and joined us. The NOC is an outdoor center, mainly focused on rafting, but also has zip lines and other outdoor activities. More importantly, they had burgers. Similar to Mountain Crossing, you literally go through the NOC on the trail. A long bridge, marked with a white blaze, goes over the river they use for rafting. On one side of the river is the general store and outfitter, the other has their bar and lodging. We met some pretty cool people that night. The most note worthy was Randy. Randy was probably in his late 50s, and rocking a kilt. Not one of those rain kilts, an honest Scottish kilt. The boys and I could all be called ""nerds"". We are into dungeons and dragons, table top gaming, video games, and the like. But Randy, he is old school nerd. Like from back when you got beat up for it. His dungeons and dragons group has been going on since I was in elementary school.We stayed up with him pretty late, drinking a local mead (the nerdiest of alcohol), going over different table top systems, discussing the ins and outs of stratagem and how best to build adventuring party compositions, the usual. He sent us off with some spare food he had, including a prepacked lunch with each individual item label with it's calories. He really recommends going to Gen Con, I won't be able to make it this year, but hopefully I'll see him next year. Our bunk house was that and nothing more. It had 2 bunk beds and a heater that sounded like a diesel generator. The ceiling, walls, and I'm pretty sure the mattress were all made of particle board. It was the worst night of sleep I've had so far, but it was warm.4/25 Nantahala Outdoor Center to Locust Cove (11 Miles)Just prior to crossing the Georgia/North Carolina border, a SOBO hiker warned us we were about to be ""Bitch Slapped and Humbled"". But so far, that hadn't been the case. No day is ""easy"", carrying 35 pounds up and down mountains never really qualifies. Things had been very manageable.I was pretty sure today was going to be the smack down. Out of the NOC, the trail goes vertical for 8 miles. No flat breaks, no downhills, just a continuous up hill for 8 miles. My mantra so far has been to treat every big climb like it's going to be the end of me, and I'm always pleasantly surprised that I make it. We all pretty much agreed, forget miles today, we make it to the shelter near the top and call it a day. 8 miles, about 3,500 feet of elevation gain.Let me just say, the surprise was real this time. I got to the shelter we were supposed to stay at that night, and had lunch. Matt only beat me by 10 minutes. My first words when I saw him weren't ""Damn"" or ""Help me I can't breathe"", they were ""I'm not done yet, are you?"".Admittedly, it wasn't the steepest or the most technical climb we had done, but it was still as long as some days we have done in terms of mileage, and I was feeling on top of the world for knocking it out. I left some friendly goading in the shelter log for Bushwhack, who still hadn't gotten there after an hour lunch, and we added another 5 miles to the day.(We learned later that Steve apparently didn't leave the NOC til 1:00 due to some intestinal distress, but he still caught up to us just before dark)4/26 Locust Cove to Yellow Creek Gap (11 Miles)*Disclaimer, this is where it gets gross, but context is important. If you don't want the TMI, you can skip the rest of this journal entry knowing I survived.Today sucked. It was cold and raining all day. We decided to move our zero up a day to avoid some of the worst weather, but we had 11 miles to go before our shuttle pick up. The first 5 miles were hard. It's the first day I listened to my audio book the entire day. No sounds of nature, only Michael Kramer and Kate Reding reading me The Wheel of Time. Cold, wet miles.We met up for lunch at a shelter. It was small, and every hiker within a few miles must have been on it. I ate about 1,000 calories for lunch. (Including a 750 calorie gas station honey bun. It was needed today, but did you know in real life your supposed to split those things with 2 other people?). I wasn't feeling super talkative, so I huddled up under a pile of my dry clothes and ate.Not long after, my butt started to feel irritated. I attributed it to the single ply toilet paper. After about half a mile, I had to stop, find a busy, and put some hydrocortisone cream up there. I thought I had made a terrible mistake, as I don't think I've felt anything burn like that. After a minute, it subsided and I was able to walk again, if a bit uncomfortably. The next 5 miles weren't much better than the first, but I made it. We got a ride into town, had some Mexican, and called it an early night. 4/27 Robinsville (Zero Miles)I woke up at about 3:00am in a lot of pain. About 4 years ago, I had surgery to remove a very problematic hemorrhoid. It was back with a vengeance, and about the size of a grape. I spent the entire day barely able to walk, and absolutely miserable. Bush and Matt handled some of the chores for me, and I walked as little as I could. I spent about 4 hours reading Wikipedia pages on the Warhammer 40k universe, most of that time in the bath tub soaking in Epsom salt. The guys are into it and had been talking about it, and I couldn't do much else.This could potentially be the lamest hike ender ever.4/28 Robinsville (Zero Miles)I spent another good chunk of the day soaking, but this time with only sporadic hot water. Things still aren't great, but I'd say I'm at about 10% of the pain I was in yesterday, the recovery seems miraculous, as last time this happened it got to the point of surgery. Having to take another zero to recover was not ideal, but the guys decided to stay with me for another day. At this point, Matt has all but made his decision to leave, so his timeline and finances don't matter much. Bushwhack got sappy, and wasn't ready to part ways yet. Since I wasn't incapacitated, I was able to move around today. We did a few more chores and stocked up for the next leg of the journey (5 days of food, which is more than I've had to carry yet). We sat in the parking lot of the motel, talked about life and philosophy, made butthole jokes, and did our best to plan to try to make it to Clingman's Dome together.The boys have a shuttle coming tomorrow, my plan is to go with them, but if the morning comes and I don't think it's wise to hike yet, we part ways. Even if I go with them, it's likely I'll need to stop early and won't be able to keep up. I hope I can, I really like the guys. Also, Robinsville is a dreadfully boring town.Happy Trails,Navigator ","

Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663510,"Hello everyone!Time for my usual disclaimer about not posting for a while. I planned to write this journal for myself. I have a terrible memory, and I wanted to be able to look back and remember some of the day to day things. However, Haley let me know that she has had at least 3 people ask if I'm still alive, because the journal hasn't come out in a while. Sorry, but I'm going to use the same excuse as every other time. If you are wondering if I'm still alive, read on and find out! Also, I may break the entries up today into a couple posts, so make sure you are reading the oldest one first. 4/29: Robinsville to Fontana Dam Shelter: 8 MilesI got up with the guys, and decided I was probably good to get back to hiking. In hindsight, being terribly bored may have contributed to the decision.It should have been a pretty easy day, but I was still recovering, so it was a bit of a slog. Pains can be a bit of a drag when you feel them every step all day. I did another day listening to my audio book. Apparently we walked through a section of trail next to a beautiful flowers, filled with butter flies. I didn't see it, but Matt and Bushwhack assured me it happened.About 7 miles in, we arrived at the Fontana Marina. Fontana has a resort that really tries to lure in the hikers. Right on the trail they have a dock with actual bathrooms, as well as a small resupply. For $3, they will send a shuttle to bring you into the resort proper. At the resort, they have lodging, hiker mail pick up, and a restaurant. We were suitably lured in and hopped in the shuttle.Despite being a nature resort, they are also a hub for car enthusiasts, probably do to their proximity to The Dragon Tail. I know absolutely nothing about cars. I just know they were a lot of them, and they were expensive.We had lunch at the restaurant. They had a burger with Carolina Reaper sauce, and ghost pepper pepper jack cheese. I have a higher than average spicy tolerance, so I was excited to see it on the menu. However, since I have a higher than average spicy tolerance, I was a bit disappointed by how mild it was. Still an good burger though. We got the shuttle back to the Marina. We had about a mile to go, and it had almost no elevation change.Let me tell you, all three of us agreed that it was one of the hardest miles so far. The first section went up maybe 200'. If you've been reading these journals, you know that should be nothing. We were so filled with beer and burgers, that by the time we got to the top of it we were exhausted and sweating. The rest of the mile was flat, but even that was tough. We finally made it to our destination, The Fontana Hilton. The Hilton got it's name because it has more amenities than any shelter has a right to. The shelter could probably sleep 20 comfortably. Right next to the shelter is a faucet with drinkable water, no filter required. About 100 yards away is a bathroom with real toilets, AND A HOT SHOWER. If all that wasn't enough, the shelter also has a solar powered phone charger, equiped with USB plugins. Oh, did I mention its water front property on Fontana Lake?There were probably about 10 people staying for the night. Most I hadn't run into yet. The only faces I recognized were Boots and Purple Haze. Boots is a girl in her 20's and Purple Haze is in her 50's if I had to guess. They have a mother/daughter relationship despite meeting on trail. They stick to themselves though, so I don't know much about them besides a few conversations.I became quite the life of the party when I whipped out Marshmallows for everybody to go with Bushwhack's fire. I had been carrying them ever since running into Randy at the NOC. I didn't realize that despite being fluffy, it was actually almost a pound of marshmallows I had been carrying. We were all discussing how the shelter had everything, except a cat to deal with the mice. No more than 10 minutes after we had moved on from our feline fantasy, a woman came down to the shelter from the nearby road. She asked if any of us had seen a cat.Apparently, two days prior there was an RV accident. One person died, and two were in critical condition. During the crash, their cat escaped, and they think it's in the area of the shelter. After she left, Matt and I looked at each other. We didn't need to say what we were thinking. The trail provides. 4/30: Fontana Dam Shelter to Robinsville: -1 milesThe night prior, I let the guys know that I think I might have rushed back onto the trail too soon, but I would decide for sure in the morning. Come morning, I decided I should go back. At this point, Matt would be getting off trail in a few days, and I didn't have a whole lot of faith that I'd be able to catch back up to Bushwhack. We said our goodbyes, and it sucked a bit more than I anticipated. Something about shared experience and hardship forges bonds very quickly. They are huggers, I am not. I took one for the team though. I sat around camp for a few hours. I wasn't in a huge hurry to get back to Robinsville. While I was sitting around, Minesweeper and Hemlock showed up. We had met them around the area of the NOC. While we were chatting, they told me about another instance of weird trail magic. The day prior, they were sleeping in their tent at a stealth site they made next to a road. They woke up as a murder of crows around the area started cawwing loudly. As the crows went on, something hit their tent. Hemlock got out, there was no sign a car had driven by, or that anybody was in the area. What hit their tent? A Cliff Bar. Eventually I walked back to the Fontana Marina. Spirits were already low, but walking the wrong way on the trail did not help, even if it was only for a mile. I got picked up, and headed back to good ol' Robinsville. Before checking in, I stopped by the CVS and got a bigger bag of Epsom salt.5/1: Robinsville: Zero MilesI soaked in Epsom salt.5/2: Robinsville: Zero Miles I did it again. When I called Haley that night, I let her know I felt like a salted slug, but my butt felt, if not great, okay. I was ready to hit the trail again. Happy Trails,Navigator ","

Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663515,"Hello everyone,I'm doing a couple of sections today, so make sure you start at the right one. Also, my phone screen is starting to get kind of beat up, typing is getting a bit wonky. Typically auto correct figures out what I meant, but it might miss some. 5/3: Fontana Dam Shelter to Mollies Ridge Shelter: 11 Miles The shuttle driver was actually able to drop me off at Fontana Dam Shelter. It had everything else, I don't know why I didn't assume it had easy road access. Coming off my 4th zero day in Robinsville, I swore I would never be back. I either had to make it to the next town before something else fell apart, or I was done. Luckily, I was going into The Great Smokey Mountains. I was excited, as I've heard it's a beautiful section of trail. Before that, I had about a mile of trail, including the Fontana Dam.You'd think I'd be the most excited about the nature. That would make sense, after all I did decide to go live in it for a while. But, what I get the most excited about is seeing the small towns and things like that along the way. The Fontana Dam isn't along the trail, it is the trail. You walk across the dam to get into The Smokies. The dam has a really nice visitors center that has an overlook. I never thought I'd think a dam was pretty, but it really was. Walking across it got my mind back into the adventure mindset. I must have taken 20 pictures just walking along it. The Smokey Mountains are pretty, but they are also one of the few spots along the trail notorious for regulations. The first, and arguably the biggest, is that you only have 8 days to get through them. At this point, most hikers would knock them out in about 6, but I was coming in with some lingering issues and no momentum. When you enter the park, you have to date the physical back country permit, and put half of it into a collection box. I was a bit worried about the timing.Additionally, you are required to camp at shelters throughout the park. Most years, you are actually required to sleep in the shelter, but luckily there are still some holdovers from COVID, so I was able to sleep in my hammock. The shelter spacing can be a bit weird, some days you might have to decide between an 8 mile day, or an 18 mile day, with no in-between. There are a few other regulations, but those are the big ones. About a mile into the park, I had my first encounter with the deer. In many sections of the trail, there is physically nowhere to walk but the trail itself. In this case, the trail was cut into an incline that would be too steep to walk in either direction. On the trail ahead of me was a deer. Where I come from, a deer will run as soon as it sees you. Smokey Mountain deer are apparently very acclimated to humans. I got to about 20' away from it before I stopped. At this range, I could see it was a young buck, antlers just starting to come in. I don't know if the young guy thought I was here to steal his does, or if I just smelled so salty he wanted a lick, but he started walking closer. I'm not an expert on deer body language, he didn't seem hostile, but he was still getting a lot closer than I wanted him. I thought I was going to have to club him with my trekking poles. Or give him my lunch money. He got closer than 10' away before he went off trail into the woods. The next exciting and terrifying part of the day was Shuckstack. Shuckstack is an OLD fire tower. The fire watch used to have a cabin next to the tower, but it's fallen apart to nothing except a partial chimney. The tower is by far the tallest so far, and the narrowest, and by far the sketchiest. Look through the Google Drive photos, you'll know which one it is. Did I mention it was super windy? Prior to coming out here, I did roofing sales in the city. The city has some old, weird buildings that required odd ladder set ups. I've had some dicey climbs. Shuckstack was scary. Thousands of people climb it a year, and as far as I know, very few of them die. So up I went.  I'd have to stop when a wind gust came, and the landings between stairs had no guard rails.  When I got to the top, I was not exactly bolstered to see that when the wood of the watch room rotted, they just put more wood on top. When that wood rotted, they did it again. 3 layers of wood, and not even the top one looked that nice. The room was the size of a small elevator. Maybe 4 people could have stood in it, if they didn't mind bumping shoulders. The tower swayed, and the sheet metal rattled in the wind. I had to sit to calm my nerves and in-between wind gusts I managed to stand up and take a video to prove I was there. I'll put it in the drive. If you watch it, make sure the sound is on. I went down much faster than I went up. 5/4: Mollies Ridge Shelter to Derrick Knob: 13 milesI'm writing this a bit after this stretch of trail. I don't remember anything particularly bad or good about the day. That's not a satisfying read though, so instead I asked ChatGPT, to write me a vivid description of this section of the trail. I've added notes on how well it captured it.  I love the future. The Appalachian Trail between Mollies Ridge Shelter and Derrick Knob Shelter is a breathtaking stretch of the trail that takes hikers through the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As you start the hike from Mollies Ridge Shelter, you'll immediately notice the dense forest canopy overhead, providing cool shade and a peaceful atmosphere. (Actually, this was the first day I didn't wear my wide brimmed hat, the canopy did just start to come in and provide shade)
The trail begins with a gradual climb up Mollies Ridge, offering panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. You'll feel a sense of accomplishment as you make your way up the ridge, passing through patches of wildflowers and occasional clearings that provide glimpses of the stunning landscape below. (No real clearings, but the wild flowers were really picking in in some places)
As you descend from the ridge, the trail winds through lush forests, with towering trees providing a natural canopy overhead. The path is lined with ferns, moss-covered rocks, and babbling streams that offer a cool respite on hot days. (There was a couple small springs to refill water, but no babbling streams on this stretch, the moss was really starting to show up here though.)
The highlight of this section of the trail is undoubtedly the climb up to Thunderhead Mountain, which provides sweeping vistas of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The trail takes you up through dense rhododendron thickets and wildflowers, with the final push to the summit offering a challenging climb that's well worth the effort. (Yeah, that's pretty accurate)
After taking in the views from Thunderhead Mountain, the trail descends to Derrick Knob Shelter, where hikers can rest for the night. The shelter is situated in a quiet, secluded spot and offers a cozy respite from the rigors of the trail. (Actually, this dude named Pajamas was there, and made the most chaotic fire in the shelters fireplace. Not quite at all this night.  I miss Bushwhack's calm orderly fires. Pictures in the drive to show what I mean)
Throughout the entire journey, hikers will be treated to stunning vistas, tranquil forests, and the peace and solitude that can only be found in the great outdoors. It's a challenging but rewarding trek that will leave you feeling invigorated and inspired. (Actually, my feet hurt, and I looked like an old man everytime I stood up)Happy Trails,Navigator ","

Zach Hamilton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663529,"Hello everyone. Last of 3 posts for today. I didn't want to put everything in one post and wind up with a massive wall of text. Sorry if it sent out multiple emails!5/5: Derrick Knob to Double Spring Gap: 8 milesToday was a beautiful day, which is unfortunate. For the last two days, the forecast has been calling for rain (when I'm able to check it). I strategically slowed down a bit, because Clingman's Dome is coming up. Clingman's is the highest point on the entire trail. Tonight and yesterday, I walked through a day with no rain, just to find out the rain had been pushed back to the next day. I've taken to being the last one to leave the shelter. First, I'm not in any particular hurry. Second, I've found, at least in The Smokies, if I quietly sit in the shelter for a bit, the wild life really comes out. This morning there were 4 deer grazing around the shelter, along with birds singing and chipmunks and squirrels darting about. It can feel like a Disney movie. I think they all come around in the hopes to find crumbs or something salty a hiker left. One of the really cool things about the trail, is how abruptly the scenery can change. So far, I've been walking through deciduous forest for the most part. Today, it switched to a beautiful pine forest. There wasn't a transition period at all. Since at the higher elevations, leaves haven't fully come in, you could see it coming. One step and suddenly the forest was pine and the ground was covered in moss. Everything out here is beautiful, but after a while a change in scenery was exciting. I mentioned previously that the regulations along this section of trail can lead to some awkward miles. My choices for the day were 6, 8, or 20 miles. We opted for 8.I was making pretty good time, and got to Silers Bald Shelter for lunch. I ate with a guy I've mentioned before, but used the wrong name. You see, it's easy to get somebody's name wrong when they have several. This guy is a character. We met a bit ago, and during our introductions, this is what he said. ""The thru hikers know me as Napa, the weekend warriors know me as The Cigarette kid, and the females know me as Pajamas""Now typically, anybody who refers to women as ""Females"" in casual conversation gives me a weird vibe. Not to mention some of his conversation topics are a little weird. But, we kept running into each other, and he seems harmless, even a bit entertaining. We had a LONG lunch. About 2 hours give or take. There was less than 2 miles to go before the shelter we both planned on stopping at. I was in even less of a hurry that usual. That night, the shelter had 10-15 people in and around it. Napa made another chaotic fire. This guy will literally go into the woods, and come back with a whole tree stump. He had quite the pile of firewood. There was even a several foot long, 6"" wide tree branch. To make things more exciting, since it couldn't fit in the fireplace totally, he had half of it resting on his pile of tinder while the branch burned. You could tell people were torn between being happy somebody made a fire, to being concerned this man was going to burn down the shelter. 5/6 Double Spring Gap to Gatlinburg: 3 milesHonestly, things have been a bit tough. Sure I'm feeling beat up physically, but the mental game is hitting too, just not in the way I expected. In a couple days, I'll have been out here for a month. That is a whole lot of time to think. I believe my priorities have shifted. I'm not going to go into that in a public journal, but know I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to have priorities change. That being said, I was not feeling good. I wanted to make sure I you in my headspace, so when I say that I walked 200 miles, reached the observatory at Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the entire Appalachian Trail, and it was foggy, I was deflated. I decided to call it there, and go into Gatlinburg and think things over. One of the options I wanted to think over was renting a car and driving home. But, I hadn't hitch hiked yet and I couldn't leave until I tried. First, I decided to break out the charm and try to weasel my way into one of the visitors cars. I struck up some nice conversations, but Napa kept jumping in. ""Yeah, those rocks were slipperier than a goose shit on Easter"". Yeah, I don't even know what that means. Napa continued on the trail, and I decided to Hitch the old fashioned way.The parking lot at Clingman's Dome has one way in, and one way out. I started making my way to the exit, and as soon as I got there another Thru hiker stopped me. ""You're going to have to find somewhere else, your going to mess this up for me"" he said in his snooty British accent. No hello, not what's up. I usually like British accents, but this guy just sounded like a jerk. I told him I wasn't here to mess up his hitch, and I'd go eat some lunch in the shade and wait my turn. He mentioned he had been at it for almost an hour and a half. He got picked up not long after that. I finished up my lunch, brought out my trusty stool, stuck my thumb out, and channeled my best tour guide smile. I was on my way to Gatlinburg about 10 minutes later. 5/6: GatlinburgI spent most of the previous night sitting at the only non touristy bar. No easy feat if you've never been to Gatlinburg. It is, by far, the most commercialized, tourist trap of a town I have ever seen. I went to that bar four times during my stay. It was right next to my hotel, had excellent food, and the bartender had the prettiest Southern accent I have ever heard. The first night, I talked to a woman at the bar for most of the night. Well, I was talked at all night. I didn't get much of a word in. Since she was talking in circles, about 2 hours in I said, ""So what do you do besides work?""She immediately started crying, and told me about her terrible relationship with her husband. I gave her a shoulder to metaphorically cry on for the night. I hope she finds some peace. On a happier note, the next day I did the sample run. The main strip of the town has quite a few wineries, breweries, and distilleries. All of them provide free samples. You can get quite a nice buzz going, as well as get some steps in. The only one I paid for was $5 for the full Ol' Smokey tasting. The guy leading the tour had the humor, and looks, of a washed up Dane Cook. That being said, he was hilarious, and way better at leading a tasting than I ever was. ""Some people mix this one with coke, but I recommend you start slow. Don't put $200 dollars worth in"" In-between drinking, I had some decisions to make. At this point, I have decided I am not a through hiker. I just don't want to do this for 5 more months. I still had to figure out my next move though. Was I ready to get off the trail now?I decided that I was not. I'm a section hiker, I just don't know how long the section is yet. I made some calls and arrangements. 5/8 Gatlinburg to Hot Springs: 60 miles (by car)I'll tell you first folks, I'm a dirty Yellow Blazer. I found a shuttle driver willing to take me to the next town. Bushwhack had been letting me know his mileage, and I decided to do some of my own trail magic and get him and I a room for the night. The shuttle driver was awesome. She had previously hiked the trail after quitting an executive level job. Now, she shuttles AT hikers and does some other side hustles. They were a self proclaimed ""Platinum Blazer"" they stayed in town whenever possible, skipped a couple of sections (under 200 miles worth, so technically still a thru hiker according to the ATC), and we're not afraid to throw some money around to make sure they didn't miss anything. They really helped solidify that Hike Your Own Hike means different things to different people. We had an awesome chat over the hour long ride, and I'll definitely take some of the things she said to heart.5/9: Hot Springs North Carolina: Zero miles Hey, look I caught up on the journals! I will say I'm a little disappointed. Hot Springs whole thing is the Hot Springs. I was picturing being like one of those monkeys you used to see on Animal Planet, soaking in natural springs. Well, turns out there's just one spa here that you can pay 60 bucks an hour for to sit in a hot tub, which they pump with spring water. For the most part, the town is a main street with a few restaurants. However the main street side walk is the AT. Instead of blazes, there is actually a metal AT emblem twice a block or so. The absolute highlight has been WayCo. I went down to the Tobacco House, which is a liquor store. As I was checking out, something caught my eye. ""Sir, do you know there is a rooster in your store?""He pointed to the counter. The rooster has its own post card. Small towns are absolutely wild. If you want to see what pure joy looks like, go check out the photo album. Yes, I've never held a chicken before.Oh yeah, I guess hanging out with Bushwhack was pretty cool too. We are heading out tomorrow, he has been hitting some big miles, so I don't see us sticking together for too long. But the guy running the outfitter let us know that a couple shelters coming up are closed due to unsafe bear activity. Our options tomorrow are 5 miles, or 20.Happy Trails,NavigatorCoo,WayCo ","
