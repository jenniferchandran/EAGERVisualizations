OG Baggins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654476,"It’s hard to believe that I’m about to press the button on my first trail journals entry.  I’ve been reading other people’s journals since sometime around 2007, dreaming and planning on one day writing my own.  But now that it comes down to it, it seems like a big commitment.  It means announcing publicly that I’m going to make this hike with all the associated opportunities for embarrassment and failure.  Welp, here goes.

The first I remember learning about the Appalachian trail was when I was in Boy Scout camp at Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco which lies in northwest New Jersey right below the Kittatinny Ridge.  At the time there was a requirement for advancement to complete a 10-mile hike.  We were up on the AT heading south towards Catfish Pond when we ran into a couple of thru-hikers heading north.  Since this was probably around 1974-1975 timeframe, I imagine them wearing cut-off jeans, ankle-high work boots, and canvas rucksacks.  We stopped to talk to them for a few minutes and I remember being fascinated and amazed that someone could just step out on a trail in Georgia and walk and walk and walk for months and walk all the way up to Maine.  I was hooked.

Several years later, the first time I read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, the fantasy was rekindled when Frodo steps out of his front door with nothing more than a pack on his back (and a ring in his pocket) and a year later, after many meetings and many partings, relying entirely on his own wits and the people he meets along the way, returns home with a lifetime’s worth of adventures.

So after 40 years of work, three kids, and a few mortgages, I’m getting ready to retire this coming February, cast off the yoke of responsibility, and set out on my Long Expected Journey in March.  I’ve been cured of my romantic visions of what a thru-hike will be like after reading hundreds of Trail Journal entries.  I know the majority of the thousands that start a thru-hike every year never make it due to injury, family obligations, and most commonly, sheer boredom. And when it comes to 62 year old desk jockeys like myself, the completion rate is even lower.  
So why, after all that, do I want to put myself through all this?  That’s a story for another day.",,View Entry,"Jul 11, Mon",0
OG Baggins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657597,"So, I’m almost 6 months away form my planned start on March 11, and man, am I out of shape.  Last year I was in pretty good cardio shape, but for a variety of insufficient reasons my exercise regimen over the last 12 months has been pretty poor.  Starting today, that changes.  I did a 5K run this morning and I’m committing to either a run, a hike, or a treadmill 5 days a week for the next 6 months. I have 10 -15 lbs. to lose in that time. While I know maintaining weight on the trail is a problem for many people, and so shedding pounds is not necessarily a good idea right before a thru-hike, I don’t think a 10 pound beer belly is going to help me on the trail any.

OG Baggins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659419,"Well, my training has...not been a complete bust.  I'm up to running and/or walking probably 50 or 60 miles a week and I've shed 5 pounds. But I really need to kick it up a notch this last 3 and a half months.  I'm still dialing in my gear list.  I've gone on a few overnights and added or replaced a few items, but I'm still struggling to keep my base weight under my target if 20 pounds and fit it all in my 45 litre pack, so I'm still looking at things to swap out or leave home. I've dehydrated 50 or so meals which should get me through. For dinners I'm figuring maybe 1/3 meals I've dehydrated at home, 1/3 or more that I resupply and 1/3 or less off trail. Breakfast and lunches will be mostly resupplied on the way.And, the big commitment was I've made reservations at Amicalola Lodge for my wife and me for my start on March 11!

A friend couple is heading from North Carolina with my wife and me to see me off on the trail.  I've obsessed and sorted, packed and repacked my pack and I'm more or less happy with my 17 lb. warm weather base weight and my 19 lb. cold weather base weight, which means I'll be leaving Amicalola with 33 pounds including 4 days food and water.

OG Baggins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659996,"I've avoiding writing about why I'm doing this hike. Every time I try to put it in words it comes out sounding so trite or too precious. Then I found this poem online that thru hiker Andy ""Raven"" Cai had written several years ago in a shelter log on the AT. For me it hits the nail on the head.5 Million StepsThe month of March will set into motion  a journey through woods as wide as oceans, from the Georgian foothills of Nature’s fane to sky altars in the mountains of Maine, a pilgrimage of whole devotion.

I shall hike on this Appalachian trail, following the blazes of white detail, ‘neath the open sky be it blue or grey,  looking forth only to the northern way, across these wild rivers, ridges, and dales.

Twenty-two hundred miles to walk and wend, five million steps before I reach the end. From start of Spring I now must sprout the will to go outward bound until Autumn’s chill, with the last days my youth has left to lend.

And in these earnest months of much travail, when I’m lost amidst fog draped morning veils, immemorial truths I hope to find from the whisper of branches, leafed or pined, to the roaring vigor of rain-kissed gales.

This I walk not because I’m bold or brave, but from fear of that day I’m old and grave, and with regret, I’ll only meekly sigh of an unlived life that has passed me by. This is an adventure I cannot waive.

While I know not if I’ll succeed or fail, I do ask of you, dearest friends, regale! For now, walk along with me in your mind. And should you find your own path as divined, by taking that first step you’ll have prevailed.

Started out at 9 after an adequate breakfast buffet at the lodge.  Said goodbye to my wife and friends and set out with my son Justin.  It was 36 and sunny and a great day for hiking.  It was also a pleasure hiking with just a small day pack and we made great time, doing the 8.8 miles to the top of Springer mountain, the start of the AT, a little after noon.  There was a small crowd of day hikers there, so after a snack and photo op, we headed down the Actual AT, following the white blazes north. 
Before long we were at Justin's car, and after picking up my pack and saying our goodbyes, I was off on my own.  A quick 2.8 miles to Stover Creek Shelter and my first day on the AT was done by 3:15! Although I briefly considered pushing on, I'm trying to be smart and take it slow. 
I've been having problems with my left knee lately and I was very happy that it held up well with only a few twinges.

Last night it started blowing and raining around 10 o'clock and it did not let up.  The lightning started at 2 and went well past 5. It made for a restless night.  I was up by 8 (having lost an hour to daylight savings time) and on the trail by 9:30.  It drizzled and spritzed all day and what was an enjoyable morning gave way to a less enjoyable afternoon as the temperature dropped and my legs gave out.I leapfrogged a number of people who stayed at the same shelter as I did and also passed a number of day and weekend hikers.  I was aiming for Gooch Shelter, which would have been over 13 miles today, but my legs had other ideas.  I pulled into Justus Creek campsites, which has a dearth of suitable hammock hanging trees, around 4:30. Mark from Detroit pulled in about an hour later as I was making dinner. It's now 7 o'clock, approaching hiker midnight, and I'm in my hammock. Supposed to get cold the next few nights.  Below is a picture of one of the many Rhododendron tunnels, one of the reasons the AT is sometimes called ""The Green Tunnel""","Stover Creek Shelter

Last night it got down to 35F, and I was toasty warm. Tonight is supposed to be 27 and it will be the first time I've used this setup in the 20s. The cold forecast caused many hikers from Texas, Florida and the UK to head for a hostel tonight. Time will tell if they were smarter than I.
I have to tell you, the trail in Georgia is beautifully maintained, especially for all the traffic it gets.  All the big ups have stone or wood steps, there's almost no erosion, and every stream has either a bridge, logs, or stepping stones. Kudos to the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club for a great job.
I slept well last night and was on the trail by 8:50.  I stopped at Gooch Shelter for the privey, some water, and a chat with the folks that stayed over night. I was on the trail again by 10:15.
I stopped for lunch at 11:30 and chatted with Bumblebee, whom I'd seen at Gooch.   
At Woody Gap I received my first trail magic (a clementine and Little Debbie apple pie) from Chillbilly.  
On Preacher's Rock I met Mango,  a chubby little black and white dog who hiked the entire AT in 2015 with her owner.  If Mango can do it on 5"" legs, surely I can too!

It was a chilly 23 degrees when I got up at 7:30 this morning and the wind was howling all night long. But I stayed pretty warm in my mummy bag and hammock.  At camp last night were Mark, Sauce, George and his daughter Madeline (whom I'd met at the lodge), a few other couples and a family of 15 kids and their mother (seriously). I hope all those little kids were warm last night!
I was hiking by 8:50 and leapfrogged with Pixie and her friend most of the morning. 
Mark caught up with me on the ascent to Blood Mountain, the highest point on the Georgia AT at 4442 feet.  It was a tough ascent, but the views were spectacular.  Chatted with Bumblebee on top. Some people will tell you that going down is as hard as going up, but don't you believe them. Going down was a breeze in comparison.  
Mark and I are splitting a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins.  We resupplied at Mountain Crossings outfitter that has everything a thru hiker could possibly need, and then some.  I ordered a pizza and soda from them for dinner. Mountain Crossings have a boot tree outside where hikers who give up the trail at Neel Gap can throw their shoes. Luckily mine are still on my feet.","Lance Creek Campsite

We ordered breakfast from the lady at Blood Mountain Cabins, but had to wait till 9:00 to get it (which in Georgia means anywhere between 9:05 and 9:20) even though we were ready to hike by 8:00. So that was a bit annoying, but a delicious everything bagel with chive cream cheese, capers, sprouts and a generous helping of smoked salmon made up for it.
We had perfect hiking weather today: upper 30's, bluebird skies, and a light breeze.  We had lunch on top of Cow Rock Mountain with beautiful views.
Down in Hogpen Gap we had wonderful trail magic courtesy of The BFG and September: hot chicken and dumplings, chips, sweets, wine, water, and I picked up a Coors Light that someone else left on the side of the parking lot.
That gave me the energy to finish the final 5 miles into Low Gap Shelter. We walked along a ridge with a forest fire burning below us, which we were later told was a controlled burn.  
It's supposed to rain for the next 2 days so we made a reservation at an Econo Lodge in Helen, GA where we're going to take a day off after what will be 6 straight days of hiking.  A new record for me!","Neel Gap

Last night was down in the mid 30a with a light breeze. I had the best night's sleep I've had in quite a long time.  I think the woods are taking over and the stress levels are starting to melt away.
The first half of today's hike was beautiful: we were on what seems to be an old forest road, maybe built by the CCC. Gradual slopes, no rocks or mud, nice stone work.  
The second half was back to a foot path: rocky, rooty, and seemingly always uphill.
No long breaks today because we were trying to meet a 1:30 shuttle we'd ordered to get into Helen GA for our zero day (Zero = a day with no hiking. Nearo= a day with a short hike, like, <5. Hero = a day when you go into town and back out again without staying over)
Today I was hiking with or around Mark, Bumblebee, Fox Trot, Pixie, Lotus Bliss, Nibbles, and a few section hikers.
We caught a shuttle into town and checked into the Econo Lodge with Mark. Not impressed. But it's clean and cheap and a good place to wait out tomorrow's rain.

Low 20s and a wicked wind had my hands and face numb for the first hour until I got on the leeward side of Rocky Mountain. All day it was adding and shedding lawyers as we hiked in and out of the wind.
In addition to Rocky, we also did Tray and aptly named Dismal Mountain for 13.1 miles with 3596' of ascent and 4226' of descent.
At the shelter are Squirrel, Globetrotter, Bumblebee, Fox Trot, Mark, Andy, Nibbles and a few others. We started a fire to pass the time till it got dark, but the wood was wet so it was a sad fire.
The picture above is of me in my hammock.  It's supposed to get down to the teens tonight and on a night like this I sleep with my water filter to prevent it from freezing and cracking, my electronics so the batteries don't die, and my hiking clothes so I don't have to put on frozen clothes the next morning.

The day started cold again: it was 19 when I woke up and 16 when we hiked out of the secluded hollow of Deep Gap. We quickly formed a convoy with Nibbles and Tulio in the lead, then a young couple, Mark, and finally me, the slowest bringing up the rear.
After a quick 4 miles, we hit Dick's Creek Gap and did the half mile road walk to Around the Bend Hostel and Outfitters for a quick resupply and an early lunch. The Hostel looks amazing and they let us use their beautiful Kitchen and bathrooms all for the price of a bean burrito and can of Doctor Pepper. 
Back on the trail, we hit a long series of PUDs (pointless ups and downs) that plum wore out my legs.  Generally, my body is doing as well as I could have hoped for and better than I'd feared, but my legs were shot today. Finally, around 5:00, we hit the GA/NC border! One state down, 13 to go! 
We're camped at Bly Gap just inside North Carolina. After a failed dinner of Knorr's pasta with cheese and broccoli plus tuna fish (bleech!) We gathered around a fire courtesy of a thru hiking family composed of a mom and two young boys (Goose, Sonic and Buttercup, collectively the Dirtbag Family). Also here are FoxTrot, Thunder, Mark (now Frostbite) and another pair of older ladies whose names I didn't get).
Also, after pressure from my lovely wife, I'm adopting the trail name ""Baggins"". I'm not 100% sold on it (every year there are multiple self-named Bilbos, Frodos, and assorted Gandalfs hiking the trail), but it will do unless something better comes up.

It was a cold morning again, but 2 big ups right out of camp was enough to get the blood pumping. Frostbite, Fox Trot and I leapfrogged each other all morning up and over Sharp Top
Around noon Fox Trot met a guy she was hiking with earlier who was having trouble with his knee and was trying to get off trail for a bit. She stayed behind with him at Deep Gap parking lot to try to get him a shuttle, and we didn't see her the rest of the day.
I've heard-tell some thru hikers in and around our bubble that have started dropping out: he realized it wasn't for him; a few bad knees; a bad back.
Frostbite and I took a late and long lunch at Standing Indian Shelter and filtered some water. We didn't get back on the trail till almost 3.
The views from the top of Standing Indian Mountain were jaw dropping...due partly to the fact the all the trees on top, including all the Rhododendrons over a few years old, were dead.  Forrest fire? Blight? I'm interested in getting some internet to find out.    
We cruised the last 4 miles downhill into camp at Beech Gap. Nice campsites that supposedly had some bear problems last summer, but none recently. Hopefully we won't have a return engagement.
We arrived the same time as 2 other thru hikers and their dog, a rambunctious 10 month old Aussie Cattle Dog named Buckwheat. Squirrel pulled in about an hour later, and right behind him was the Dirtbag Family! Amazing, mom, a three year old and a five year old did over 12 miles, all with packs, in the same time as we did. And the kids still had plenty of energy to burn. Goose (the mom) said she's already done over 1000 miles backpacking with these 2, and there are 2 older kids back in California who will join them when school is out. Me, I can hardly look after myself!

It was a cold night again last night: 21 on the thermometer when I got up to pee, but I slept pretty well.  Frostbite and I were on the trail by 8:45, skipping breakfast for now.
A quick 3 miles through the cold and clear mountain air found us at a deserted Carter Gap Shelter for breakfast and privy, soon joined by Squirrel, the dog Buckwheat and his guys, and the Dirtbag family.  An quick up and a long leisurely down took us through a long and totally dead rhododendron grove similar to the top of Standing Indian. It was very creepy with almost no living things except a few young rhododendrons trying to repopulate the dead zone.
After crossing Betty Creek Gap, we started up Albert Mountain. After exchanging phone numbers, squirrel hurried on ahead to try to catch a shuttle into Franklin NC. He was a nice guy to hike with and I hope we meet again. 
The path up Albert Mountain was a cool but somewhat daunting trail: a 2 foot treadway with steep moss-covered cliffs on the left running with melting ice, and long, steep drops on the right. Gave me the heebiejeebies a few times.
We stopped for lunch halfway up when we found a shallow cave in the left hand cliff. Before long the trail turned steeply up with many wooden steps and a few difficult rock scrambles. We were rewarded with beautiful views on top and a ""100 miles"" sign scratched into the leg of the Albert Mountain Fire tower.
A gentle 4 miles down through more rhododendron groves (live, this time) led us to a beautiful new 2 story Long Branch Shelter. Here are Dragonfly, the Dirtbag Family, Buckwheat and his guys, and 9 or 10 other thru hikers scattered in tents and in the shelter.
Usually as people arrive at a shelter or campsite, they set up their tents or claim a spot in the shelter with their bags, filter water from a nearby river or spring, and cook dinner.
Around 5 or 6 they may start to drift off to their tents or stay up and chat around a common area like a fire pit (if anyone has had the energy to collect wood and tend a fire) or a picnic table (if there is one). By 8 o'clock, (which is ""hiker's midnight"") most people are in bed and quieting down. It's 8:40 as I write this and the last few holdouts are finally heading to bed.","Beech Gap

The forecast said it wasn't supposed to start raining today until 9 am, so my plan was to get up, packed and hiking by then, but it actually started drizzling at 4:30 am. This necessitated breaking camp in the rain for the first time this trip. It's a little harder for a hammocker than for a tenter because you don't have that enclosed tent space to change your clothes and repack your pack.  Luckily it was only a light rain so I didn't suffer too much for my mistakes.  It's something I'll have to get better at.
The whole shelter cleared out between 8:30 and 9 except for the stoners who seemed to take up permanent residence in the shelter's loft area, and an hour and a half later we were all at the Rock gap parking lot: Chief and Buzzard (Buckwheat's 2 humans), sisters Double Back and Rest Stop, Wonko, Dragonfly and the Dirtbag Family. Most we're catching a shuttle into Franklin, but Frostbite and I had 4 more difficult and very soggy miles to get to Winding Stair Gap where my lovely wife (now nicknamed Sherpa), my brother and sister-in-law we're picking me up. 
First stop was the Lazy Hiker Brewery where Sherpa, I and some friends went 2 years ago. At the time Sherpa vowed that when I hiked the AT this would be our first meeting place. Low and behold, 2 years later, here we are!
We rented a nice VRBO on the Little Tennessee River for a few days. After a shower and sorting through and drying out all my wet gear and restocking my food from the boxes Sherpa brought, I went to pick up Frostbite (who was staying at the Onwards Hostel) and bring him to our cabin for a nice dinner of steak, baked potatoes, roasted asparagus, and cherry pie (courtesy of Frostbite) for desert.
It's evenings like these that make it more difficult to get back on the trail.Editor's Note: For those who are interested, I went back to the beginning of the Journal and added more photos to some of the entries","Long Branch Shelter

It was a gradual climb out of Winding Stair Gap through a large burn area. It looks as if they had a fire as recently as last year because there was almost no leaf litter and no undergrowth.
We got to Siler Bald around 12:30 and had lunch, but we didn't bother climbing all the way to the top because of low cloud cover that probably wouldn't have afforded very many views. 
By 2:15 we were back on Wayah Gap Road where the ladies picked us up. A quick detour through downtown Franklin so I could sign the big 2023 thru hikers' banner in the town square (Baggins NOBO '23) and were we're back to the VRBO for an afternoon snooze.
Tomorrow I start again in earnest.","Winding Stair Gap

The song was playing as my brother and sister -in-law dropped me off where they picked us up yesterday, and as appropriate as it was, I couldn't get it out of my head all day. I loved my day off and spending time with my wife and family, but it was time for me to get on the trail again.
The climb from Wayah Gap Road was an almost constant, but gentle 3 hour incline.  At the top was the Byrne memorial tower, fantastic views back over the Georgia and North Carolina mountains we'd recently climbed, and Trail Magic!
The Trail Angels were three friends who had just recently completed a TWENTY YEAR section hike of the AT. Talking to them about how hiking equipment and communications technology had changed since their thru hike turned into a section hike back around 2001 and hearing their stories was fascinating.
But I had to go, I was meeting up with Frostbite at Cold Spring Shelter and I didn't want to keep him waiting.  Until I ran into a second trail magic. 
Àt Burningtown Gap I came upon an encampment of a half dozen white canvas tents, cooking fires, and a bunch of people in pioneer clothing.  Turns out it was a group called Frontiersman Camping Fellowship from Arkansas out on their annual Trail Blessing trip. The FCF is evidently a church affiliated group that models themselves somewhat like the Boy Scouts except all their camping and activities are pre-1840's style: canvas tents, period costumes, wrought iron cooking over open fires, black-powder and bow hunting, etc. I only had a small bit of what was on offer: some decidedly post-1840s Dr Pepper, vegetable soup (with post-1840s quinoa), and biscuits baked in a Dutch oven.  Very nice group and a lot of fun.
A mile later I met back up with Frostbite and since the next shelter was 6 miles on, we decided to call it a day.
In camp are also Dragonfly, a Swedish and an Aussie, and Gunsmoke and Songbird (whom I'd seen at Amicalola Lodge). The Dirtbag Family and a few others are in the Shelter. And sadly I found out that Annie from St. Louis had broken her wrist on the trail from a fall and is headed home, and least for now.","Wayah Gap Road

We were hoping for a nice sunrise this morning because we were camped on top of a ridge, but were disappointed when we woke up to stormy skies. We even had a rogue hail storm around 7:30 as we were packing up. But by the time we made it a half mile down the trail to Copper Ridge lookout, we were rewarded with awe inspiring views as the sun broke through the cloud cover.
A long gradual decline to Tellico Gap and more trail magic! A tramily (trail family, a bunch of people who met on trail and hiked together) from 2019 consisting of BC, Slim, Queen and a few others got back together to have a reunion party and spread a little hiker love.  I chose a hotdog on white bread with ketchup and bacon and a bag of Doritos.  
We were talking about some of the families out hiking the trail when Slim says, motioning toward Frostbite and me, ""then there's these older guys out there and you look at them and say 'if they can do it, I should be able to do it too' "". I looked behind me and there was no one there, so I guess she was referring to me. Alrighty. So I guess I've now transitioned from striving middle age guy to inspirational old guy.  
Next it was a grueling climb up to the Wesser Bald fire tower, with fantastic views from the top.  
The next 4 miles we mostly walked along a ridge, leapfrogging Gunsmoke and Songbird along the way. Some of these ridges were amazing: 4, maybe 5 feet wide at the top with steep grades, almost cliffs, falling away at either side covered with a jumble of brambles, blowdowns and trees. It was like walking along the edge of a knife.
Finally around 3:30 we stumbled into the NOC, a commercial outpost that offers a general store, outfitter, bar, restaurant, cabins, bunkhouse, white water rafting, zip lining, whitewater slalom courses, and anything else you could imagine.
We chatted for a while with Burnt from New Zealand, then went to the outfitters and bought and printed out our permits to hike through Great Smokey Mountains National Park (GSMNP). We checked into our bunk house which was a disappointing 8'X10' plywood box with two 2'X4' and plywood bunks and not much else (I guess that's what you get for $30 each). Then we showered ($3.50 a towel) did a load of laundry ($8.50) and had a decent meal at the restaurant.  
All in all a difficult hiking day, hoping to recharge for tomorrow.Editor's note: it's too hard to embed additional photos in these blog posts from my phone, so I'm going with just one primary photo. You can check out additional photos from most days in the Photo section","Cold Spring Shelter

In retrospect, even with the crappy accommodations last night, it was worth it to have a climate controlled room to sleep and pack up in and a community kitchen and dining area to make breakfast.  
We were on the trail by 8:40 and we started our 6 mile, 3300' ascent to Cheoah Bald at 5052'. It was exhausting. We leapfrogged with a tramily consisting of Sparky, Magpie, Cyclo, Tech and Uncle Billy. They all started on March 13, 2 days after us.
By the time we made it to Locust Gap we were too tired to push on since the closest camping is almost 6 miles away. We didn't have it in us.  There's now 12 or so tents in the Gap.  Mostly thru hikers, but also a few overnighters.
I've been getting dizzy late in the day or after a particularly strenuous trail section. I first thought it was dehydration, but I also think it's because I'm running at a calorie deficit. They say when hiking mountainous terrain you burn through 4500- 5000 calories per day, and I know I'm getting nowhere near that, so I'm bonking by mid day.  I'm going to have to start concentrating on finding food with a high calorie/weight ratio and not just what tastes good.  
Today's earworm was Monday Morning by Fleetwood Mac, which at least was an improvement over yesterday's Slow Dancing by Jonny Rivers. Once I find a song with a tempo that matches my hiking tempo, I can't get it out of my mind and it drives me CRAZY!
Notable birds seen so far this trip: Eastern Towhee, Eastern Bluebirds, Brown Thrasher, Carolina Wren, Red Headed Woodpecker, along with assorted Nuthatches, Chickadees, Vultures and Juncos.

One Bite at a time...that's how you eat an elephant. I kept telling myself that as I climbed ""Jacob's Ladder"" coming out of Stencoah Gap.20 steps, then double over and huff, and puff, and pant, and wheeze.  Then 20 more steps.
I was leaving Stencoah Gap around 10:30 after having second breakfast at Melissa and Bill's trail magic (2 chili dogs, a bag of Cheetos a can of V8 and some Oreos to go) when I hit the trail and the trail hit back. 700 feet elevation in 1.2 miles that took me well over an hour, maybe an hour and a half.  I have to tell you, I was a little discouraged that I was still having such a hard time after two and a half weeks on the trail, but some people have said it will take at least a month to get your trail legs, so I'll have to be a little more patient. 
The second half of the day was much better as we navigated a bunch of little ups and downs and raced the rain into Cable Gap Shelter around 3:30.  There are more than a dozen tents here and as of 7:45, late comers are still straggling in. Here with Uncle Billy, Magpie, Sparky, Tech, Cyclo, Northstar, Gunsmoke and Songbird, Superman and Lois Lane, Chief and his dog Buckwheat, Cricket, Frostbite and several more.

We started out from Cable Gap leapfrogging with Superman and Lois Lane, Gunsmoke and Songbird, Northstar, and Young Swede. 
As we hiked out of the mountains to a lower elevation, it was clear spring was starting to appear in the valleys: Trillium was popping up, Dutchman's Breeches, fiddle heads, and all sorts of plants are waking up. The British Science Association has calculated the spring travels north at about 1.9 miles per hour, or over 45 miles a day. So unless we hike more than that (we don't) spring is bound to overtake us.
Arriving at Fontana Dam, Superman and Lois Lane were leaving the trail because they were teachers at Auburn and had to go back and finish the semester, Gunsmoke and Songbird had to sadly get off the trail for a week to attend the funeral of a friend's son, Northstar was staying in a hostel in town, and Young Swede had to keep hiking because, as a foreigner he didn't have time to dilly dally if the wanted to finish before his visitor's visa ran out. Frostbite and I decided to make it a Nero today and stay because the next leg is a pretty steep climb onto the ridge in the Great Smokie Mountains National Park 
The Fontana Dam Shelter is called the Fontana Dam Hilton because it's so spacious and well kept, has bathrooms and shower, and a solar powered charging station. It's really nice.
When Frostbite and I got to the parking lot, we met Sunnyside who thru hiked last year and had come back to do trail magic. As his hiking partner Mother Hen hadn't arrived yet, he agreed to shuttle us all over town: to the post office to pick up my mail drop, for resupply, and out to lunch. He was very generous with his time and very generous with his other trail magic later in the day: ziti, salad, drinks, snacks, chips, etc 
Since we had a lot of extra time, we lounged around the trail magic, the fire pit, got to know some of the other hikers we'd been hiking with for the past few days, and had a relaxing afternoon in preparation for the big climb into the Smokies tomorrow. And Squirrel caught back up! It was good to see him again after he'd taken 3 zeros in Franklin to deal with a knee issue.

We walked across the Fontana Dam and entered the Great Smokey Mountain National Park.  After a brief road walk, we dropped out hiking permits in the drop box and hit the trail.
First climb was a 4 mike, 2700' hike up to Shuckstack fire tower. The tower was not in great repair, missing a few hand railings and the floor boards up top we're starting to rot through.  But, there were fantastic 360° views including views of Fontana Dam and Lake. 
Another 4 miles and a series of ups and downs brought us to Doe Knob ( get it? Doe Knob?) were Frostbite and I stopped for lunch and to attend to some blisters that had popped up.
Doe Knob and a mile on either side was an amazing scene: a silver birch forest with Small Blue and yellow striped Swallowtail butterflies flirting over a beautiful carpet of blood root blossoms: white, lavender and white with lavender stripes. If ever the there was a place where you might expect tiny faeries to pop out of a hollow log, this was it. Unfortunately, very difficult to capture the effect on a camera. 
After reaching Mollie's Ridge Shelter, we decided to push on an additional 3 mile to Russel Field Shelter to make for an easier day tomorrow. This made it a 15 mike day, my biggest yet! 
This final thought is brought to you by today's earworm, We May Never Pass This Way Again, by Seals and Croft.  The last 3 miles of today's hike I was hiking alone as the sun was going down, and taking my time. After singing We May Never Pass This Way Again in my head all day, I started thinking about how the experience of age lends a unique perspective to this hike. I will surely never pass this way again. I'll never see that tree, this flower,  that rock, this mountain again. Finishing this hike is not guaranteed, and even tomorrow is not certain. Sometimes I feel like I'm sitting at the table after a pot roast dinner with a loaf of bread, mopping up every last drop of gravy, and then licking the plate. I'm so fortunate to be out here, and who knows for how long? I just want to soak it all in.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Luckily no boughs broke and I awoke to spitting rain as I packed up my camp. 
It rained on and off most of the day and the wind gusted up to 35 or 40. That meant layers on, rain skirt on, rain skirt off, rain coat off, sweating up hills, cold down hills. There were 2 nice views today, one on Rocky Top and one in Thunderhead Mountain, but the weather was so nasty I just snapped a few photos and hurried on.
One person who quit early on said all the YouTube channels he watched only showed the good parts of hiking and not the nasty sucky days, so he felt duped and quit after 4 days. Well I don't want to be accused of the same thing so I'm here to tell you, today sucked. No gravy today. Just nasty weather, raw feet and aching legs. I had a lot on my mind and I just wasn't into it. 
Frostbite and I ended up at Derrick Knob Shelter around 1:30 after a slow nine miles. We ate lunch,  hitched up our packs and we're just about to set out for the next shelter 6 miles out when it started raining again. We looked at each other and decided we were going no further. We sat around the rest of the afternoon as rain-soaked hikers came in and filled up the shelter. In this section, the AT hugs the North Carolina/Tennessee boarder and dips back and forth between the 2 states.  Derrick Knob Shelter is actually in Tennessee, as was yesterday's camp.
It's supposed to rain, thunder and lightning starting around 3 am with wind gusts into the 60 mph range, so I'm sleeping in the shelter for the first time, but I don't have an air mattress so I'm sleeping on the hard wood floor. Tune in tomorrow and I'll tell you if I got any sleep.

By using my inflatable pillow as a hip pad and my clothes bag as a pillow, I was able to find comfortable enough sleeping positions to get some sleep last night. Sleeping in a shelter is not bad, and will be even better with a sleeping pad 
The wind picked up around 5am and didn't quit all day.  It's still howling at 8:30 at night as I write this.  But the rain let up around 9:00, and so we started out.
Today was a good day of hiking: my legs felt better after a long rest yesterday, my spirits were lifted by a text from my daughter, my feet felt better after I applied another layer of Leuko tape, and a few podcasts helped the first 6 miles fly by. 
1:00 found us ready for lunch and a privy at Double Spring Shelter. Lunch was a surprisingly delicious summer sausage with Chinese hot mustard in a wrap. My wife says if I'm hungry enough, I'll call anything delicious, and I guess she's right. Anyway, it gave me the fuel I needed for the 3 mile, 1200' ascent to Clingman's Dome.  
The ascent was awesome, probably my favorite part of the trail.  It looked like what I imagine hiking in the Pacific Northwest must be like: hemlock forest, soft, pine needle covered trails, luscious green moss covering almost everything.
When we got to the top, we found that the road to Clingman's Dome, at about 6620' the high highest point on the Appalachian Trail and one of the highest points east of the Rockies, was closed due to the high winds, so we had the place to ourselves.  We climbed to the top of the observation tower, took a few photos, enjoyed the view and hurried back down because the wind was so vicious.
The final 4 miles plus  half mile side trail led us to the shelter where we did our camp chores, planned the next few days, and crawled into bed.
Today we were hiking with Highspeed, PF, Early Bird, Northstar, and we caught back up to the Moonshiners tramily (Uncle Billy, Tech, Sparky, Magpie, and Cyclo).

It was a cold night last night: the temperature was only a bit below freezing but there was a steady wind that got under my tarp and blew through my hammock all night.
The trail was pretty today and mostly downhill, so 5 miles flew by and by 11:00 we were at Newfound Gap. The Moonshiners were there waiting for a ride into Gatlinburg, and the parking lot was full with tourists, hikers and tour busses.  After availing ourselves of the facilities (flush toilets! But no sinks) and access to a cell signal to call home, we headed up the trail. The trail was full, and I mean full, of day hikers going up to see the sights. Several of them stopped to ask us about our hike and as they oohed and ahhed over how far we'd come and how far we were going, I felt a little like a rock star! It was cool.
We got to the shelter around 1:00 and Crushin' It was just heading out for the next shelter as we ate and weighed our next move. We'd done 8 miles and it was too early to stop, but if we went 7.8 to the next shelter, the options for tomorrow would be 6 miles or 17. So reluctantly, we decided to stay.
Northstar showed up and stayed as did a ton of section hikers and day hikers. The Moonshiners came in later fresh off a resupply and pizza lunch in town. The shelter is full and there are a dozen tenters as well. GSMNP does not allow camping except for at shelters, so they are seemingly always crowded. 2 more nights and we'll be out!","Mt.

Subsequent versions moved the start time up to 2:00, then 11:00.  We got a little late start because I overslept, so we were racing the rain all day.
The trail started out in a well worn groove, in places a rut 2 or 3 feet deeper than the surrounding land, because we were still on the popular day hike route to a scenic overlook called Charlie's. Bunion. We soon passed the Bunion and the trail became less worn. I did not do the side scramble to see the view, but Frostbite did and he said it was worth it 
The geology in this area includes a lot of slate and shale and other metamorphic rock. When these mountains (amongst the oldest in the world) were lifted up by the collision of tectonic plates hundreds of millions of years ago, the layer of rock bent and buckled as if you'd taken a book and bent it until it burst open. In some places you're walking on the edges of the layers like you were walking in the edges of the book. In other places you're walking on it at various angles. The colors ranged from slate grey to iridescent orange and green or rust.
Much of the morning was spent on an aptly named section of ridge called the Saw Tooth. I tried to describe the ridges in this area a few days ago, but today I kept getting the feeling like I was walking along the backbone of some huge beast, along the backbone of the earth itself. The treadway was only a foor or two in some places with the earth falling away steeply at both sides. Sometimes there was only a single tenacious tree or bush on each side. There were some spectacular views but most of the time I dare not look up and kept my eyes firmly on where I was placing my feet.
We stopped for lunch near the side trail for Peck's Corner Shelter.  The wind grew colder and the sky  started spitting rain, so I put my pack cover on and donned my foul weather gear and set off again.  We were off the ridge by now, back into green, mossy pine and hemlock forest.  
We got into the shelter around 3:30 and the shelter was already crowded with a lively crew.  The  Moonshiner were there along with a new collection of section hikers. I had trouble finding a suitable hammock spot so I'm set up 50 yards the other side of the privy. Patriarch is hammocking closer to the Shelter and Northstar is tenting.

I woke to the warbling of the wrens this morning, and everything was wet from the dew.  But it was warmer. By the time I had packed up my hammock and made it to the shelter, the Moonshiners were gone: they had a 17 mile trip to get out of the park where a friend was picking them up. The less ambitious of us milled around and after breakfast, we were on our way.  
It turned out to be a beautiful warm, breezy blue bird day. After an initial climb, we started a long, slow descent out of the park, from 6300' down to 2500'.  The GSMNP is essentially a 75 mile long  elevated ridge rising from 1700' at Fontana Damn, to 6600' at Clingman's Dome and back down to 2000' at Davenport Gap.It was fascinating watching the change in climate and plants as we descended:At 5000', the rhododendron tunnels began to reappear. At 4700', the hemlocks began to give way to mixed hardwoods, the moss ground cover began to thin out. The soft pine needle trail changed over to hard dirt and leaf litter.  At 4600' the wild flowers began to reappear, carpets of Spring Beauties and now yellow Trout Lillie's, along with the pollinators.  At 4500', I got my first black fly bite in over a week.  By the time we got to 2500', the trees were budding and we'd climbed right down into Spring 
After lunch at Cosby Knob Shelter, we took a .6 mile side trip to Mt Cramer Lookout, a fire lookout built by the CCC in the 30's. The views were amazing, and well worth the detour.  
After a foot-punishing Rocky 4 mile downhill, we made it to Davenport Gap Shelter by 5:00 after a 14.6 Mike day, not counting the side trip. I'm staying in the shelter tonight due to a dearth of hammocking sites, a long with Squirrel, Bumblebee, Pickles, Podcast, Remmy and others.

I slept on and off in the shelter.  Sleeping on hard boards without a mat is not very comfortable.  But one of the advantages of sleeping in a shelter is there's so much less to pack up in the morning, so we were out on the trail by 8. 
It was a quick 3 mile or so run downhill and out of the park. There were nice waterfalls and some beautiful new wildflowers including Fire Pinks and wild Geraniums. Throughout the Smokies we've been hiking on and off with a guy with the trail name Adjunct who is an adjunct professor at a college in West Virginia in the biology or botany field and he said the Smokies have the most diverse wildflowers (in North America, I think?) Which was why he was out there.  And lest you think I know how to identify all these wildflowers, I don't.  I use the Seek app by i-naturalist to ID plants, reptiles, amphibians, and insects, and the Merlin app for birds, primarily for bird songs.
Anywho, as we were exiting the park there were a couple of local guys giving out trail magic.  Yukon Raspu-ton through hiked (I think in 2009) and his buddy Zigzag is a section hiker.  I had a vola and 2 bags of chips (Doritos and sour cream and onion Lays) and a nice chat, then we pushed on the last mile uphill to the Standing Bear Hostel.
Standing Bear is a unique place, kind of a cross between a hippy commune and a hiker hostel. All the buildings and all the furniture in all the buildings (except the main house where the owner lives) are made out of logs and rough-cut lumber with recycled doors and windows. Everything, including the shower rooms, are paved with local river stone accented with pieces of pottery, colored glass, broken tile etc.  There are a half dozen ""staff"" that the owner says work for stay, but I didn't see much work going on, mostly partying. Anyway, I thought the vibe was very cool and laid back. See my photos for some pics of the place.
So I took a nice hot shower, did my laundry on a sink with a washboard, had a couple of beers, caught up on journaling, resupplied, chatted with fellow hikers and re-bandaged my feet.  
Most of the people we were hiking with didn't stay over, they just resupplied and moved on. Throughout the day a whole crew of people we'd never met before drifted in to stay.  This left Frostbite and me feeling like we were falling behind and wanted to catch up with our crew.  But we really needed the nearo after like 2 weeks of straight hiking.  
As the newcomers and staff got rowdy around the bonfire, Frostbite, I, and a few other tired hikers retired to the bunk room and drifted off to sleep.","Davenport Gap Shelter

We were up early and anxious to get going because we knew we had a long day ahead of us, but it was nice to be able to sit in a kitchen and prepare breakfast (even if it was just oatmeal) with bowls and a sink instead of squatting on a log in the middle of the woods.
We had a long 4-mile, 2000' foot climb right out of the gate. At the top of the slog was Snowbird Mountain and an FCC navigation beacon. As we took a break, 2 guys from the local electric utility pulled up in a truck to fix a power issue at the beacon.  While they waited for info from their dispatch center, they came down and chatted with us for a while. They were interested in our thru hike and had some good local knowledge about the mountains and where to find the best burger in Hot Springs.  Nice fellas, after we overcame our language barriers (they were speaking Tennessean, and we were evidently speaking Yankee)
A few more miles downhill and we stopped for lunch near Groundhog Shelter, after which we immediately proceeded up a series of hills, culminating at the top of Max Patch.  Max Patch (Mack's Patch) seems to be a former cattle grazing meadow (owned by Mack?) That is now maintained by the NPS as a bald. It had spectacular 360° views and is very popular with day hikers, but since it had been threatening rain all day, Frostbite and I had the place to ourselves.
After taking a bunch of photos, we started down the final grade, through a few meadows, and into Roaring Forks Shelter. We were surprised that there were only 2 other guys, soon joined by a third, but we all had expected there to be many more.  People say that after the Smokies, where everyone is required to stay at one of the few and therefore crowded shelters, the groups of hikes begin to spread out a bit and the trail seems less crowded.

It started raining at 7 this morning just as I was getting up.  The forecast was for rain all day today and tomorrow. I had a bar for breakfast and we started out, not wanting to delay the inevitable.
The first few miles were down and the rain was light. I was composing this journal entry in my head: ""It was a ""soft day"" as they say in Ireland, and the rain went pit pat on the leaves and my rain hood as the small streams sprung to life and gurgled their way down the mountainside..."". Shortly, the trail turned up, the rain came down and the trail turned into a river.  Screw the ""pit pat"".  The day turned into a mud-slipping, boot-squelching, soaked-to-the-skin, chilled-to-the bone, eyeglass-fogging, snot-running, finger-pruning slog of a day.
After a midmorning stop for another bar, we pushed on for the last of our 14+ miles without stopping, our only aim being to get to the shelter and out of the rain. When faced with a day like this, the only thing to do is focus on the trail and the obstacles in front of you, and just walk.
Safe and dryish at the shelter now, Frostbite and I are hoping no one else shows up tonight so we don't have to move all our wet stuff to make room for more wet hikers. The three guys we camped with last night pushed on the additional 3.5 miles to Hot Springs and we're wondering if we should have, too.  But, with no reservations and no cell service, we decided to ride it out here tonight and get an early start to get to the post office before they close at 10:30 to get my mail drop, get some town food and a warm bunk to ride out the rest of the storm.","Roaring Forks Shelter

The astute reader will have noticed that I changed the signature quote at the bottom of each blog entry from the overused Lord Byron quote to a passage from the equally overused Robert Frost poem, The Road not Taken, reproduced here in full
The Road not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.
I'm lucky to have found a compatible hiking companion in Frostbite so early in my trip, but he's a stronger hiker than I, so I'm often hiking for hours alone, which I love as it gives me time to think. It's occured to me that one of the main reasons I've undertaken this journey is I have unfinished business with the dreams of my youth.  Like most young men I had dreams of adventure and intended to avoid the 9 to 5 rat race that I saw my father run his whole life.  The first thing I intended to do when I was finally free was to hikeThe Appalachian Trail. But as I went through college and fell in love, ""starting my real life"" started to mean earning my own money, getting married, having children, and making a home. And so I did, without regret.  The Appalachian Trail became the Road not Taken, both literally and figuratively.  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. And yet, here I am. How did I ever get this lucky? 
And I have time to write this because we're here doing a nearo in a seedy little hotel in Hot Springs NC, resupplying, refueling, and drying out.   More adventure to come...","Deer Park Shelter

Frostbite and I hiked out of Hot Springs on Easter Morning before the town woke up.  I had eaten well the day before including a huge breakfast/brunch at the Smokey Mountain Diner and an excellent burger and loaded baked potato at the Iron Rail Tavern, so we were ok missing breakfast. 
Hot Springs had been a local resort town since the early 1800s and there are a few old spas and retreats left from last century. In the 1880s they changed the name from Warm Springs to Hot Springs, I can only imagine based on some keen marketing advice. They also housed German POWs from World War I somewhere in town. Now a days it seems they make most of their living from hikers, white water rafters, and retirees. 
We crossed and then paralleled the French Broad River for a mile or so.  The river was raging from all the rain we had recently. The trail turned left up  the cliff and there was some pretty hairy cliff walking as we climbed high above the town. 
Hiking through an area of meadows and gravel roads, a lady flagged Frostbite down and gave him 2 Easter baskets: ziplock bags with 2 Easter eggs, a tangerine, headache powder, trail mix and lots of Easter Candy.  All the hikers we ran into today also had Easter baskets from the nice lady. Easter trail magic! 
We hiked up to the fire tower on Rich Mountain and had a late morning snack. We were joined by Adjunct, Carlos, the Moonshiners (minus Uncle Billy who had to leave the trail for a week or so), Bumblebee, and several day hikers. I sent out some Easter texts and called some family since I had cell service. I really missed being with family on Easter.
We got to our intended destination, Spring Mountain Shelter, but it was still early, we still had energy, and everyone else was hiking on, so we pushed on to a stealth site (an unofficial  camping area not marked on any guide) at Allen Gap.
In addition to the aforementioned thru hikers, we're also here with Squirrel, Remey, and Stairmaster.
Today marks my 30th day on this thru hike, and I've completed a little more than 1/8 of the trail. My assessment after one month:
Physical: I'm finally getting my trail legs and I can power up hills that would have taken me several rest stops when I first started. I'm still one of the slower hikers in my group, but I think I'm just naturally a slow walker. My knees and back are doing better than I could have hoped for. My feet are still finding new places to get blisters. After 30 days I wouldn't think that possible!
Mental: I've had very few days so far that have made me think of quitting, and none seriously. I have to remind myself to hike at my own pace and let it go when people I've been hiking with take off on longer miles, or when I get passed by people who started later than me. Finding a compatible hiking partner early on has certainly helped my mental state.
People have said the first month in the trail is like a honeymoon. The second, it becomes like a job where you just get up every morning and hike because that's what you do. The third month is when people really start questioning why they out here. So far, ""a honeymoon"" has been pretty accurate!","Hot Springs NC

Our camp site was right next to a secondary road, so I was awakened by tractor trailers and trucks hauling hay, bright and early. 
We hiked a few miles to Log Cabin road and encountered trail magic: Mickey and Minnie who thru hiked a few years ago left out coffee, chocolate milk and some cakes. Just down the road was the ""Southern Cookie Lady"" who passed out free home baked cookies from the front porch if her beautifully restored log cabin. Last year she gave away over 2000 and she's on a pace to pass out even more this year.
We hiked all day with the Moonshiners, Adjunct, Carlos and Fettuccini.  We stopped at Blackstack rocks for lunch. Blackstack is an awesome cliff face with excellent views. 
After that was a long ridge walk that included Big Firescald Knob with challenging rock scrambles and again, gorgeous views. Shortly after coming down from the ridge, we passed the 300 mile mark! The last 2 miles to Jerry's Cabin Shelter seemed to take forever, and we were exhausted by the time we got there.  
The people we were hiking with for the last 2 days all pushed on and we were joined by 15-20 hikers we'd run into at Standing Bear and Hot Springs. The only ones we really know are Bumblebee, Podcast and Northstar, who pulled in late. I have a really nice hammock spot for the night, and Frostbite is sleeping in the shelter with a bunch of the young'uns!","Stealth Site, Allen Gap

Today's earworm: How Lucky, by John Prine
Today I walked, down a street I used to wanderI shook my head and I made myself a betThere was all these things, I don't think I rememberYeah, how lucky can one man get?Yeah, how lucky can one man get?
We had a short climb out of camp and walked through two nice mountain top meadows as the sun was still clearing the trees.  There was still frost on the grass, although I didn't think it got down to freezing overnight.  We rock scrambled over Big Butt mountain, foregoing the Big Butt Bypass.  We then started a four mile, gentle, enjoyable descent under blue skys.
We stopped at Flint Mountain Shelter for elevensies along with Puff, Pink Flop, Fucket, Kirby, Bob, Mantis, Waldo and Podcast, much of the same crew we've been shadowing the last few days.  We continued our descent, across a road and started up again, past some beautiful waterfalls.  I was having a tough time and we finally stopped for lunch around 1:00. After some food and a rest I had a little more energy to finish the climb.
We pulled into Hogback Ridge Shelter around 5:00, totally bushed.  The shelter was full and there were half a dozen tents already up.  By the time 7:00 rolled around, there were 14 tents and 3 hammocks, in addition to the full shelter.  I thought the bubble was finally thinning out, but what seems to happen is when bad weather comes in, people gather up in a town or hostel and everyone leaves as soon as the weather clears, so it takes a few days for everyone to separate again.","Jerry's Cabin Shelter

You may notice that I talk about ascents and descents a lot. That's because my frame of mind at the moment is often tied to whether I'm climbing up, or strolling down. Several climbs today were arduous and dispiriting. I must admit, a few times I wondered how I was ever going to get to Maine if I didn't start handling the climbs better.  I'm sure it gets boring for the reader, so I'll try not to harp on it too much.
So back to today. Coming out of the shelter we continued along Hogsback Ridge, so named, I suppose, because it was a series of quick ups and downs kind of like the profile of a razorback hog.  The trail was hugged on the left for miles by an old barbed wire fence, likely an old property line.  On the other hand, we've been walking for the last week and a half right along the North Carolina- Tennessee state border, criss crossing it several times a day, so that might have actually been the state line.  There are also many small, old cemeteries in this area: some marked and maintained, some just a few old tombstones in the woods.  Most of the ones I could read were born in the mid to late 1800's, a few died as recently as the 1950's and early 60s.
Coming down into Sam's Gap there was trail magic! I had a Coke, Hostess cupcake and an orange.  The thing is when you come to a gap, you always have to climb back out, and climb we did: 6 miles and 1700' up to Big Bald Mountain.  As we neared Big Bald we came to a spot where the trees thinned out and the ground was covered with Spring Beauties. It was magical, right out of a fairy tale.  At the top of Big Bald, Frostbite was waiting for me. I flopped on the ground to recover from the climb then got up to admire the 360° views. As we sat, 8 or 10 of the folks from the shelter last night came up and we all lounged in the sun for an hour or so, eating lunch.  
I finally got up and limped my way down the final 2 miles to the Big Bald Shelter where we were staying.  Everyone else pushed past us, anxious to get to Erwin the next day.  Frostbite and I are staying in this very nice shelter with Trinity, Hos, and a late arriving older (my age) hiker putting in 25 mile days!","Hogsback Ridge Shelter

The older hiker who came in last night (looked a little like Willie Nelson) was up and out before we could even get his name. He's doing big miles and we'll probably never see him again.
We were on the trail by 8:00 and it was an absolutely gorgeous morning, hiking through open, grassy glades as the sun came up through the trees. It felt like walking through the garden of Eden and my heart was full of joy.  
Overall, the day was probably the easiest day of hiking I had yet, with short, manageable ups and long, gentle downs.  I had eaten a bigger breakfast than usual and decided from now on I was going to take at least three pack-off breaks each day: 10:00, 12:00, and 2:00, and to drink as much water and electrolytes as I could. This seemed to help keep my energy and hydration up. 
We stopped for lunch and a nice day-hiking lady let me charge my phone on her spare battery pack. I had been below 20% battery with another full day to go and thus was hiking with my phone off, and this let me turn back on to take some pictures and call my lovely wife in the evening. 
We pushed a little past Temple Gap to a stealth site, giving us a short walk into Erwin tomorrow. We're camping here with Papa Kitty and his son Magic Man from South Dakota and their dog Chewy. Magic Man is assisting his father in his thru hike and had schlepped 2 ribeye steaks from town, which had been marinating all day. They cooked them over an open fire and Papa Kitty gave us some of his. MAN, was that one good tasting steak!","Bald Mountain Shelter

Frostbite and I set alarms to wake up early, but didn't need them because the birds were up before the alarms.  We packed our camps and hustled the 3 miles to get to Uncle Johnny's Hostel on the outskirts of Erwin when it opened.  Uncle Johnny's is a small compound of several buildings offering a general store, bunk house, small private cabins, showers, laundry, tenting area and a hammocking pavilion.  We waited for 2 bunks to clear out, claimed them, threw in a quick load of wash and caught the 9:00 shuttle into town.
I was alarmed to find I lost 20 pounds in 5 weeks, down from around 185 to 165.  That would explain my dizzy spells and why I was running out of gas every day: I was just not getting enough calories.  So after being admonished by Sherpa ""Eat Baggins, eat!"" I made like a hobbit: I had 2 protein bars for breakfast, I had second breakfast at a coffee shop in town (sausage egg and cheese on a bagel, not bad for Tennessee, and my first good cup of coffee in over a month) and elevensies outside of Food City after shopping for resupply (brisket BBQ sandwich) and dinner at a Mexican restaurant to top off the day.  
The rest of the day was catching up on laundry, sorting and drying gear, and planning food, shuttles and hiking plans for the coming days.","Stealth Camp outside Erwin, TN

Gman form Unicoi Shuttle picked up Frostbite and me up at 7:00 along with Long John Silver and his son, got breakfast at the market at the Shell Station and dropped us off up north at Iron Mountain Gap.  The plan was to hike the 20 miles back to Uncle Johnny's Hostel with a minimum of equipment (basically food and water) while leaving the rest of our gear back at the Hostel, and spend another night there 
The day was overcast and a little drizzly as we started hiking South bound for the first time. We very quickly ran into the Moonshiners who were just leaving their shelter and continuing north. It was great to see them, we hadn't seen them in a few days. But because they were really 20 miles north of where we'd ended up the day before, we're probably not going to see them unless the slow down or take some days off 
One of the good things about hiking south while everyone else is going north is you get to see all the people you've been hiking around but maybe have been missing.  And we saw almost everyone.  In addition to all the people we were with at the Hostel and the Moonshiners, we saw Squirrel, Stairmaster, Trinity, Carlos, and Northstar.The first half of the day was hiking in the clouds.  The pine forests were already dark and close, and the fog gave them an ethereal feel. It reminded me of the descriptions of Mirkwood in the Hobbit and LOTR.
About half way through we ran into some excellent Trail Magic on the Beauty Spot.  Friends from several earlier thru hiking classes had set up tents and chairs and were dishing out burgers, dogs, chips, fruit and drinks. There was quite a crowd gathered and we got to meet several new hikers as well as see many of those we'd been hiking with lately.
Hiking without a full pack was a joy and I felt like I virtually floated up the mountain (that, plus maybe all the calories I packed away the night before). However, 20 miles is still long, and the last 3 hours of the day were a real slog even with a clearing day and an easy, downhill trail. We'll eventually have to hit some 20s with our packs on if we want to finish this thing, so I guess we still have a little conditioning to do.
Back to the Hostel, Frostbite and I took 2 of their loaner bikes on the 3 mile ride into town to get some food and a little last minute shopping at Dollar General. That was the last thing my legs needed.  A quick shower and laundry and it's time to hit the sack and beat the worst snorers to sleep.","Iron Mountain Gap

My day started off on the wrong foot as I was running late, problems with my phone, and misplaced gear forced me to unpack and repack my pack several times on the front deck of the hostel as our shuttle driver patiently waited for me to get my act together.  
I felt all discombobulated, but once on the trail I got recombobulated and started hiking strong. The day before at Walgreens I bought these blister plasters that are like gel filled bandages they said they had an analgesic to deaden the pain and for the first time since day 3 or 4 I was hiking in pain free feet! 
The weather was great but I knew we were expecting rain in the afternoon. We had lunch on this rock outcropping that had beautiful views of the Tennessee countryside. We reached our minimum goal campsite at around 2 and decided to push on to our secondary campsite at Ash Gap for a 12.6 mile day.  Soon afterward, the dark clouds appeared and the sky just opened up. We were soon drenched and hiking in a river of mud. The sky started to clear around 3 as we were pulling into camp, allowing us to set up camp out of the rain and hang out our wet stuff out to dry.
By 5:00 the wind was whipping and I was freezing and crawling into my hammock with the hopes of warming up, reading my book, updating my journal if I could get a signal, and not emerging for 14 hours.A note about my trail name. A while ago I was considering changing my name from Baggins because there was another Baggins hiking in front of me and people kept saying ""hey, I met another Baggins..."". In the end, a few comments from my family convinced me I should keep Baggins, but I gave it a modification suggested by Squirrel. Now I'm OG Baggins (but you can still call me Baggins) OG, for oldsters like myself, is slang and stands for Original Gangster but simply means the original and the best.","Iron Mountain Gap

The wind was howling and it was fa-fa-fa-freezing last night.  I was miserable packing up with my numb hands and putting my numb feet in frozen boots. The hike up Roan High Knob helped warm me up, but it remained cold and blustery even though the sun was out. 
We soon came to Cloudland, the former site of an 1880s hotel reached by narrow gauge rail that gave southern city dwellers relief from the sultry summer, over 6000 feet ""above the level of the sea"" (as an advertisement from the day said). There we had breakfast and tried to hide from the wind behind one of the ruin walls.
Traveling on, we passed the side trail to the Roan High Knob shelter, the highest shelter on the AT. Later in the day we met 2 guys who tented there last night and they said it was miserably cold and windy, so we were glad we stayed at Ash Gap, which was bad enough.
We descended to Carver's Gap through beautiful spruch and pine forests, then up to what's known as the Roan Highlands. The Roan Highlands are a series of beautiful balds over which the AT passes offering sweeping views of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. We stopped for lunch in the woods after Jane Bald, still trying to hide from the wind.  On top of Little Hump Mountain (adjacent to Hump Mountain) we were nearly blown off our feet a few times as wind gusts up to 50 MPH hit us like a hurricane flipping an 18 wheeler on the interstate.  
We climbed down the gap between Little Hump and regular Hump mountains and are camping in a beautiful little camp site. It's supposed to get to the mid 30's tonight and the wind isn't supposed to quit for another day and a half, so I'm bundled up and hoping for a better night tonight.","Ash Gap

Our campsite last night was in a nice secluded glen, so although I could hear the wind raging like a freight train all night, I was warm and slept well.
After breakfast, I hitched up my pack, took three steps out of camp and this root reached right out, grabbed my foot, and down I went like a sack of potatoes.  Luckily, the trail was soft and I sustained no damage. It was actually my second fall; I slipped on a root during our slack pack and fell on my keister.  I know 2 people so far who are off the trail due to broken bones, so I'm trying to be careful.
Shortly after leaving camp, we were out on an open bald, climbing Hump Mountain. The mountain face was totally exposed to the wind, and with it blowing at 25 MPH with gusts up to 50, I was actually knocked off the trail and into the grass a few times on the climb. I'm running out of superlatives to describe the views in the Southern Appalachians: expansive, magisterial, audacious, breathtaking, they all apply here in the Roan Highlands.  
After crossing Hump Mountain, we started down, down, down, a gentle grade, 2600' to Rt 19E. Half way down we crossed the North Carolina/Tennessee border for the last time, and are now firmly in Tennessee.  For the last 2+ weeks we've been following the border between these 2 states, jumping back and forth between the two, but now I'm done with North Carolina.  2 states down, 12 to go!
We hung a right at Rt 19E and road-walked a half mile to the Station 19E Hostel. Every Hostel I've stayed in has been unique. This one is a warren of bunk rooms built on top of a small pub and dance hall. For $30 you get a bunk, shower, laundry, and hiker breakfast.  Had lunch and dinner in the pub (we're pretty much a captive audience here) and will be up and ready to go tomorrow morning after our included breakfast, 8:00 sharp!

Most everyone was up and packed and ready for a big breakfast by 8. We had scrambled eggs, biscuits with sausage gravy, pancakes, and home fries with bacon and cheese.  We all went away full.
Dave from the hostel gave us a ride to the trailhead where he also picked up Trinity, coming in for a resupply.  She had an unsettling night last night when some guy without a backpack and who didn't seem like a hiker was sitting up on a ridge overlooking her camp watching her. She said she slept with her knife in one hand and a can of bear spray in the other.  She seemed relieved to see a couple of friendly faces at the trail head.
We started out hiking up through some old pastures and orchards of an old farmstead with Lorax and Puff.  For a while we were walking through a rural community, past a church (there are SO many churches down here) and a cemetery and across a few rural roads. And we passed 400 miles!
We took a break by Jones Falls, a pretty spectacular 50 foot cascade and soaked our feet with Lorax and Bumblebee.
The rest of the hike was pretty unremarkable. We leapfrogged with Long John Silver and his son Jimmy, High Def, Camel and First Step, and Johnny.  
We're camped now by a pretty little brook (Upper Laurel Fork)  and the weather is supposed to be dry tonight, so I'm sleeping without my tarp and Frostbite is ""cowboy camping"", that is sleeping in the ground without his tent.
We're doing a leisurely 12-13 miles a day for the rest of the week, trying to get our timing right to meet Sherpa and her sister Dink in Damascus VA. They're coming for a visit and we're renting an AirBnB in town. I miss Sherpa and can't wait to see her! (And Dink too!)","Station 19E Hostel

I slept great last night for whatever reason, probably got a solid 9 or 10 hours, so woke up feeling great. 
Today was a nice relaxed day: nice weather, soft smooth trails, leisurely pace.  We're not doing big miles so we're taking in all the scenic overlooks, long lunches, and trail magic. 
Speaking of which, we rounded a corner in the middle of the woods and there on a dirt road was Nibbles with a white pickup, a few dozen doughnuts and a box of Dunkin' coffee! We hadn't seen him in weeks. He was working in Norfolk and took a day off to ride out and meet his old tramily. There we saw Bumblebee, Puff, Lorax, Jimmy, First Step, Camel, and High Def.
I'm hammocking now at Black Bear Hostel, doing a resupply and doing some laundry.
Before my hike people asked what I would eat on the trail and I told them what I thought I would eat, but now I know for sure.  Here's my normal day:
Breakfast I'll have a Carnation Instant Breakfast with powdered milk. Then I'll have one or two packets of instant oatmeal.  I prepackaged some at home that I added walnuts, pecans, dried blueberries or strawberries, chia, flax or chocolate chips.  My favorite is the strawberries with chocolate chips. A lot of people eat Poptarts for breakfast or snacks, so against my better judgement, I'm adding those in this resupply.
For lunch I'll have something on a tortilla: peanut butter with trail mix added for some crunch, prepackaged chicken salad, or a meat (spam, pepperoni, sausage) and a cheese stick.  I'll have one or two of these, then some snack, like a trail mix or dried fruit.
For dinner I'll have one of the meals I've dehydrated at home or a freeze dried hiker meal that I bought at a resupply.  If I don't have any of those, I'll have a ramen or pasta side dish with some type of protein added, like tuna or chicken from a foil pouch or spam.
For in between meals I'll have a protein bar, fig bar, or trail mix.
The trick is finding high calorie foods at a minimum weight.  Of course, I never miss a chance to get town food! Tonight during resupply, I hit up the Subway.","Upper Laurel Fork River Campsite

We got a bit of a later start today because we had to wait to close out our tab with the hostel owner, and we decided to buy breakfast from their general store (Jimmy Dean Breakfast Bowl for me). The owner also agreed to give us a ride to the trail head to save us a half mile road walk. So we didn't get started till around nine.  
Our plan was to put in an extra long day to make it to Vandeventer Shelter because it was supposed to rain and get cold tonight.  Then we could wait out the storm in the shelter and do shorter miles the next day. However, the Upper Laurel Fork River gorge and waterfalls we so gorgeous, we took a lot of extra time taking pictures and videos and by the time we started the long, hard climb out of the gorge, we were running late.  
The trail then ran down to and around Lake Watuga, a large recreational lake in eastern Tennessee.  After we crossed the dam, there was another huge climb and ridge walk to the shelter.  By the time we stumbled up the last rise after 7:00, I was very disappointed to find the shelter full and 3 or 4 tents already set out. I guess everyone else had the same idea we did.  We had, however, set a new record for us for a kon-slack pack, 17.6 miles. I set up my hammock and cooked dinner in the dark and prepared for a wet night.","Black Bear Hostel

It started raining around 3:00 in the morning. I later found out that there was a wicked thunder and lightning storm right on top of us that I somehow slept through.  However, due to the way I set my tarp and my position on a pretty steep slope, a lot of the rain ran down my rain fly and into the gear sling under my hammock where I'd put my pack and clothes, presumably to stay dry.  Instead, they were sitting in a 6 inch puddle of water.
So after the shelter cleared out, I dragged all my gear into the now empty shelter to try to dry it out a little and have some breakfast. After the rain abated a bit, I packed everything up (now. Several pounds heavier thanks to all the absorbed water) and set out.
We walked most of the morning in the clouds and rain, so by the time we reached the next shelter 7 miles away for lunch, I was done.  Just not feeling it. Then suddenly, our luck changed.  A cabin had just opened up at a nearby campground, so we hustled the next 4.6 miles (which seemed to fly by) to the next road crossing where the owner picked us up.
The camp ground was very basic (more like the guys back yard) but I was able to hang up my stuff to dry and get a hot shower.  Suddenly, all was right with the world.  The trail is like that sometimes.

Somehow the notifications for my Google Calendar got turned on and now every morning I get a message that says ""You have no appointments scheduled for today"" and I'm like YES!  This must be what retirement is like! Sometimes I'll say to Frostbite ""well when I retire..."" and he has to remind me that I am, indeed, already retired. I like this!
Campground owner Windy dropped me, Frostbite, Long John Silver and KP off at the trailhead on TN 91 and we started to hike through beautiful pastures and meadows.  Soon the trail turned to a gently rolling single track, and really stayed that way for the most of the day.    
We hiked most of the day with Long John Silver, KP,  Yardbird, Piper, First Step, and Camel (whom I now call ""Wallet"" because he managed to lose (and find) his wallet twice in the last week).
At 11:30, we were coming down to a road crossing and low and behold, trail magic! Hydrator and his wife Mrs. Hydrator we're there making grilled cheese, cheese quesadillas, hotdogs, and all manner of drink, chips and snack cakes.  I had one of almost everything.
And then, not an hour later as we were crossing a small gravel Forest Service road, a pickup truck pulls up and out jumps Butch, whom we'd camped with at Black Bear, with more trail magic! Coffee, brownies, and a PBR that I packed out to have with dinner.  
The sun, which had been teasing us all day, finally came out to warm us up. Soon we crossed the Tennessee/Virginia border: three states down, only eleven more to go! We took many breaks today but still made good time because of the easy terrain. And another pack-on record for us, 19.4 miles!

After a mile or 2 we separated from the Virginia Creeper and started up hill. After a climb up and down we crossed the Trail again (a very popular rails-to-trails route) and followed it for a few miles, including over an old trail trestle. Shortly we separated from the trail again and climbed our last climb to our shelter for the night.  There were only 3 people in the shelter and 3 tents set out, so I decided to stay in the shelter to skip the chore of setting up and breaking down my hammock.  We didn't know any of the hikers here.  I have a feeling most of the people we've been hiking with are either a few days ahead or staying in Damascus and slack packing for a few days.A few days ago I was playing around with my pack fitting and after watching a few YouTube video, decided that I had the location of the shoulder straps wrong.  I actually had it much closer when I started my hike, but had made 2 adjustments in the wrong direction.  After fixing that, my pack has been much more comfortable and reduced some back pain and chaffing.  Imagine finding out your pack was wrong after 40 days of hiking!","Stealth camp, outside Damascus

I woke up cold this morning, which gave me second thoughts about giving up my 15 degree sleeping bag for my 32 degree bag, as I had planned to do.  I started out hiking in just my hiking shirt, trusting that when I started the uphill climb to Whitetop Mountian, I would quickly warm up.  What I forgot is that the first half hour was downhill, and cold.  We passed through an active pasture and started the 2000' climb up to Buzzard Rocks near the top of the Whitetop Mountain, where we stopped for lunch.  
Since we were scheduled to meet Sherpa and Dink at the Elk Garden Trailhead in 4 hours and less than 4 miles away, we had some time to kill.  So we just lounged around, relaxing and talking to other hikers.  Eventually it was time to go, but by the time we got to the trailhead, they were still an hour away.  Just then, Gina pulled up with some trail magic as she waited for her hiker-husband to come off the hill, so we passed the time talking to her and other hikers until Sherpa and Dink arrived.
We drove back to Damascus and checked into our AirBnB and enjoyed hot showers, soft chairs, a bottle of wine, and a spaghetti and meatball dinner lovingly prepared by my wife and her sister. Tomorrow is rest and resupply!","Lost Mountain Shelter

After breakfast and cleaning up the AirBnB, Sherpa and Dink drive us to the trailhead where they picked us up 2 days earlier.  I was sad as we hiked away, and they say in the car and watched us hike away until we vanished over the ridge.  Mt. Rogers was in fog and we donned rain gear as we climbed.  It started raining around 11:30, and it rained all day and night.  
Someone told us that Mt. Rogers and the Grayson Highlands were amongst the most beautiful sections of the trail. And it might have been, but in the rain and fog we couldn't see more than 50 feet in front of us, so it looked like open fields, scrub and briers and large rock outcroppings. We did get to see some of the famous wild ponies that they keep there to graze and keep the area and open pasture.  
I also took my third fall when I stepped on and slipped off a wet rock.  Luckily, I fell in the wet moss just off the trail and had a soft landing.  
We stopped at Wise shelter for lunch and a group of hikers were already settling in for the night because of the rain. By the time we reached our target of Old Orchard Shelter, it was full, we were wet, and we set up our tent and hammock in the rain.","Elk Garden Trailhead

It started to let up around 5:00 and I was tempted to get up and pack up while it wasn't raining, but I was too warm and cozy in my hammock.
In the end, we were one of the last groups out of camp, and we hiked on in the mist and fog. It was mostly an unremarkable hike today: the sun was in and out, the trail was gentle, and the weather mild. The only stand out was Comer Creek Falls which was running high due to yesterday's rains.  The crossing was a bit tricky, but both Frostbite and I managed to get over without going for a swim.  
We got to the shelter around 4 and snagged two spots because there was a possibility of rain. We were there with Grateful Ed, Nala, Seaweed, George, Aloha, Yahtzee and a few more.  By 5:00 I'd eaten and set up my bed and had nothing to do, so I hung out, went to bed early and listened to a few podcasts.
For a certain type of personality, walking 8 to 10 hours a day with nothing but your own thoughts to keep you company can be challenging. Without the daily distractions of job, family, TV and chores you can spend a lot of time entertaining demons from your past: mistakes, failures, regrets, missed opportunities, and slights both real and imagined can haunt you like the Ghost of Christmas past, and can be difficult to exorcise. I suppose if you can deal with these feelings in a healthy way, real growth can be had. But it is not an easy journey.","Old Orchard Shelter

First up this morning was a walk through a working pasture. I had to detour a bit off trail due to a heifer and her calf blocking the trail, and tiptoe through the cow pies.  
Next up, trail magic by Jerry, and courtesy of a local Baptist Church. Or Trail Ministry, as they call it.  After a cup of coffee, doughnuts and a tuna wrap, the walking was pretty easy along several rail beds and old carriage roads.
We arrived at the beautiful Partnership Shelter and found Nala and a guy getting off trail because his beautiful husky dog had injured her paw, and he was giving away the rest of his trail food.  On our way across the parking lot adjacent to the shelter, Gina was there again, this time with her husband Euchre, Seaweed and Nala. More trail magic!
After that, the walking got much tougher: lot of ups and downs and rocks, rocks, rocks.  We got to Chatfield Memorial Shelter by 5:45.

Within a few miles we were at the Settlers Museum of Southwest Virginia and the Linda Mood one room schoolhouse that they let thru hikers use as a shelter.
It was raining and misting all morning which made for muddy and slippery walking, which lead to fall number 4 for me. This time, I fortunately fell in the soft wet grass at the side of the trail.
By 10:00 we were at a gas station in Atkins VA drinking coffee and eating pastries. By 11:00 we were on our way again through the rain, walking through small pastures, past old farmhouses and 300 year old cemeteries.  Frostbite said it was all very Virginia-y.  
And just like that, we made it to mile 549.6, one quarter of the way from Georgia to Maine! It was a bit of an emotional lift on an otherwise damp day.

It was overcast and blustery today. The temperatures dropped to the forties and the winds picked up, making for a dreary day of hiking. 
Not much to speak of except maybe our first stream fording without a bridge. The water was only up to our calves, so it wasn't that bad.

The wind was howling last night and reverberating around the shelter, rattling the door and making quite a racket. I got up and went outside around 1:00 am to go to the bathroom and the clouds were racing across a bright moon and the stars were peeping out in between. The farm valley below was so dark that  lights on the farmhouses looked like a half dozen tiny white Christmas lights set on a black velvet background.
We descended from Chestnut Knob and we're crossing a wet seepage when WHACK! Down goes Baggins for fall #5. Slipped in the mud, fell flat on my back in the mud and in trying to get up looked like a turtle trying to right himself.
We were ridge walking for most of the day. After fall #5 we climbed back up on a rocky, windy ridge. It was tough walking because it was so rocky, but the climbs were short and the sun made for a pleasant day.
After we descended to a shelter for lunch, we climbed back up on a second ridge. This one was a lot easier because most of it followed what I suppose to be an old logging road. Gradual grades, smooth treads.  
Virginia seems to be happy to let the AT run along old forest roads, carriage roads or rail beds and don't feel the need to take you up and over every peak in sight, in sharp contrast to the trail in NC and TN.  So the walking has been much easier, as evidenced by our increased hiking distances. 
We got to our target camp with some sunlight left and gas left in our tanks, so we did a few more miles and got on top of a hill to make tomorrow's walk, which should be a long one, a little shorter.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

So now you know how I feel about this wind, which hasn't let up for days.  But at least it hasn't been raining, and going back a few days, rain was predicted every day this week.  Then I'd be writing poems about rain instead.
As we were packing up camp this morning, some of the people who had camped down below us started to hike up and past us. And then who should come up over the ridge but Northstar! We hadn't seen her in a few weeks when she hiked on ahead of us.  She'd taken 4 zeros to fly home to celebrate her birthday with her family and boyfriend and was now back on trail doing big miles to try to catch up with her previous cohort.
We hiked 5 miles through the sleet, wind and fog and came to the Brushy Mountain Outpost, this dinky hole in the wall establishment (store? Food stand?) right on trail that had a kitchen. For second breakfast I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, Cajun fries, a Dr. Pepper and the last slice of apple pie. The outpost was filled with hikers filling the few tables and sitting on the floor recharging their electronics and chowing down all sorts of fried ànd grilled food, ice cream and sodas.
Full and happy, we hit the trail over an hour later and climbed back up on another ridge. The afternoon was another pretty easy walk, but still cold and windy. We wound up at our target shelter around 5:00, but decided to push on another mile or 2 since rain was not predicted for the night. We got to the campsite we wanted, but it was pretty full.  Frostbite wedged himself in between two tents and I went off to find two trees in the woods to hang my hammock.
We did 19 miles today, and hit the 600 mark! That's 7 days in a row over 14 miles, thanks mostly to the easier ridge walks.
Our first 100 miles took us 11 days. The second hundred also took 11 days, the third took 9, the fourth took 9, the fifth took 8 and the last one took 7 days. So we're making steady progress, but I just don't see us putting in consistent 20-plus mile days like these youngsters.

What a beautiful morning for a hike this was. The sun was out, the wind had abated, the birds were all out singing, and the trail was gentle and smooth. I was enjoying the trail and listening to the birdsong, pulling out my Merlin app to ID any particularly interesting tune: Oven bird (no, not a turkey), wood thrush (actually saw this one), Philadelphia warbler, pine warbler, red-eyed vireo.
We got to VA 606 and, hoping to replicate yesterday's second breakfast paradise, turned left and walked the half mile to Trent's Grocery. The cheese burger and tots didn't measure up to yesterday's but a hot meal is always welcome.  And throw in a V-8, Blue Bunny ice cream bar and a bag of cheddar and onion Ruffles for good measure.
Hoping to avoid backtracking the half mile to the trail, we thought we'd be smart and take the forest service road that paralleled the AT on the other side of Dismal Creek and hop over the creek above Dismal Falls to rejoin the AT. A few local fellers in Trent's advised us we could. What we didn't anticipate was when a local feller says ""just a little further on"" he means in pickup truck time, not hiking time.  So we spent a few hours hiking up dusty gravel roads before we found the crossing for Dismal Creek.
Once back on trail, the afternoon was super easy hiking in flat trails through rhododendron groves and across many streams. We stopped in at Wapati Shelter to say hi to sister and brother team Runt and Ken. Runt turns 66 tomorrow and Ken turns 70 on Sunday, and they are kicking butt on the trail. After that was an unwelcomed end-of-day climb up to the ridge where we found our camp site. It's supposed to get down to freezing tonight.

We made it to Woods Hole, one of the most celebrated hostels on the trail.  It's a refurbished log cabin with an added bunk house, shower/laundry house and glamping tents. We lounged around in the sun drinking coffee and eating home made bread and cheese for lunch, resupplying, showering, and planning our next leg.  They serve dinner and breakfast during bubble season all made from produce from their organic gardens or other local produce.  This is one place I'd come back to for a few unplugged days even if I wasn't hiking through.  Fantastic! New birds seen today: Black Throated Blue Warbler; Ruby Throated Hummingbird; Song Sparrow; Eastern Phoebe; American Redstart.P.S.: don't forget to check out the photos section for more pictures on the day.","Camp site mile 620

Neville would bring him food and water and Fearless would ask her friend who was coming to pick her up, to pick up some medication.
After some debate, I decided to hike on: there's not much I can do for him and I expect to be slowing down in 9 days to hike with some family and he can catch up then, if not before.  I feel pretty bad leaving him, though. But hopefully I did the right thing.
So after a breakfast of eggs, oatmeal with homemade yogurt, jams, apple butter, cinnamon toast, grits cake and lots of coffee, I helped clean up the kitchen and got a belated start on the trail.  
The first few hours to Pearisburg were easy and pleasant. After a long winding climb down into town, I was surprised by trail magic! I sat for a spell and chatted with the hosts and with fellow NOBOs Waldo, Turtle Tracks and Side Miles.
After crossing over and under a few highways, I started the climb out of Pearisburg. A long hot climb brought me to a beautiful mountaintop bald with an old shelter on the edge.  After setting up my hammock, I went to the edge of the bald to watch the sun set over West Virginia and chat with Lollipop and Wolfie (SOBO section hikers) Turtle Tracks and Side Miles, and Ron from Belgium.

It was a beautiful sunny morning, and I set off across the meadow in bright sunshine. The first 8-9 miles were straight across a ridge and looked like easy hiking.  In reality, there were a lot of rocks and small ups and downs that made it harder than it looked on paper.
For most of that ridge walk the trail runs right on the Virginia-West Virginia line.
One thing I discovered about hiking by myself is I hike noticeably slower and make more frequent stops to listen for birds, ID flowers etc. I guess I don't feel like I'm holding anyone else, so I take my time.
I heard from Frostbite: he's taking another zero at Woods Hole and will hike out tomorrow and do a few short days. He'll probably catch me in a week or so.
Around 10:00, the sun went away and the wind picked up.  Around 11:00 it began to sprinkle, then rain, then pour.  At 1:30 I ducked into Pine Branch Swamp Shelter for lunch and to dry out. Ron was already there and Turtle Tracks and Side Miles soon joined us.  When the rain let up a little, I decided it was time to do the last 4 miles to the next shelter.  It was a tough 4 miles with climbs and mud.  I trudged up to the shelter after 4 and was soon joined by Ron, Turtle Tracks, Side Miles, and a fella from Italy.  He's been a trail runner in Italy for 10 years and he said the AT is much harder than he thought it would be.

Didn't sleep too well in the shelter.  Imagine 6 very tired guys sleeping in a space no bigger than a small bedroom in a hard wood floor.  The snoring symphony was at full volume.
The day started out warm and sunny. The trail was pretty flat but very rocky, which made for tough going.  Just a warm up for Pennsylvania, I figure.  I made it to War Spur Shelter for lunch by around 1:15 and was soon joined by Ron. I realized I was pretty tight on food and should just make it to my next resupply in two and a half days with nothing to spare.  Turtle Tracks and Side Miles pulled in as I was getting ready to leave.  
The subsequent climb up to Kelly's Knob was very tough for me: my legs felt like rubber, my energy and my spirits were low. There was a gravel road crossing about 3/4 of the way up the hill and I kept telling myself ""just make it to the road and you can take your pack off for a break.""  Well what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a pick up truck and a guy offering me a beer! Trail Magic where I least expected it and most needed it. One of the many sayings out here is ""The Trail Will Provide"". Well today, at least, it did for me.
Easy Boy is from West Virginia and got interested in the AT by watching YouTube videos and drives all the way down to do trail magic. He's also a trail maintainer on the Allegheny Trail, an avid birder and volunteers at a raptor rehabilitation center. And he adopts stray dogs. Quite a guy, but if I'd just seen him in his bib overalls and pickup truck I would have written him off as just a local Bubba.  I'm learning not to judge books by their covers out here.  More on that in a future post.
And at that trail magic I met a nice lady, Arden, from Indiana. Our was it Illinois? One of those ""I"" states, sorry Arden.  Anyway when I told her my trail name she said ""OG Baggins! I'm following your journal in Trailjournals! We have a celebrity here!"" And I felt like a celebrity, a trail celebrity! It was very nice. She's out here doing a section hike. Does it every year, takes a ""mom's weekend"" and lets her husband and son fend for themselves for a few days.
Anyway, I had a Coke, a Dr. Pepper, Oreos, chips, candy bars, a beef stick and packed out a Yeungling to have with dinner.  The resulting sugar rush propelled me up the rest of the mountain and I hiked the remaining 3 miles to the shelter with a renewed vigor.

The Whippoorwills started whippoorwilling around 4:30 this morning. The were loud and incessant, so not many people slept in.  Most were on the trail around 7:30, including me.  
My Garmin weather forecast said 0% chance of rain today.  It was 100% mistaken. I was walking through a series of pastures and meadows around 8:30 and it started to rain.  I decided to go without my rain gear because it was pretty warm and my clothes were filthy so I figured they could use a rinse.
I passed the Keffer Oak today which is purported to be the second largest White Oak on the Appalachian Trail.
The rain let up and I took my morning break at a power line cut where I had some views. I looked across the valley and saw the next wave of showers moving in so I moved in and it was soon raining again.  The trail ran along a series of granite ledges for around a half mile, which get very slippery when wet. I slipped off one of the ledges and down into some bushes about 3 feet below. Luckily, no injuries, just some scrapes and mud.
I passed a spot labeled as the Eastern Continental Divide where all water to the left of me flowed to the Gulf of Mexico and all water to the right of me flowed to the Atlantic. I know the Continental Divide isn't a single spot but a line that runs the length of the Appalachians, so it's kind of strange to me that they labeled this particular spot.
Winding down to the valley and winding down the day I came to VA 621 and there was Alan, handing out trail magic! I had 2 hot dogs with home made relish, a few cups of lemonade, some chips and a boiled potato with slabs of butter, sour cream and chives.  That hit the spot!  There were Meadow, Victory, Ron, Trotter, Quill, and Seinfeld.
We had to ford one more stream before I found my campsite for the night, joined by Trotter and Quill.","Laurel Creek Shelter

May 10th dawned sunny and warm. I had a nice chat with Quill over breakfast. Quill is a trail ambassador in Georgia and had a lot of good information on the AT. She's also an accomplished children's author.
The climb out of the gap was easy and I stopped many times to ID birds.  I took a rest on the top on a bench as I approached the Audie Murphy Memorial to phone my wife, Sherpa.  
Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier in WWII, and he died in a plane crash on this mountain in 1971. A local VFW group erected a monument to him in 1974, and it was very nice.  
There was a climb down before another ascent to the Dragon's Tooth, an impressive stone monolith popular with day hikers. I took lunch on top of the hill before Dragon's Tooth and chatted with Copperhead (the hiker, not the snake).
The climb was tough, but I was feeling strong. What was very hard was the climb DOWN from Dragon's Tooth. Steep, long (2 miles) and at places I had to walk on a ledge no wider than my foot. After the slip and fall the day before, I was very cautious and I was moving probably no more than 1 MPH.
By 4:30 ish I'd made it to 4 Pines Hostel, a donation-based rough hostel in a converted 3 car garage for resupply, shower and laundry.  I was aghast to see i'd lost another 5 pounds (if this scale is to be believed) so when we resupplied at the local gas station, I ordered a full pizza, bacon cheese burger, and 10 chicken wings.  I didn't finish the pizza, so that will be breakfast and packed out for lunch.In the evening we sat around a campfire getting to know my fellow hikers a little better and watching the starts come out. Then I retired inside to update this journal, on which I'd fallen 5 days behind.
At the hostel are Bumblebee, Seaweed, Puff, Peroni, Seinfeld, Copperhead, and a few others.

Today was a great day all around.  The sun was out and there was a light, warm breeze as I sipped a few cups of coffee at the hostel,  packed  up my leftover pizza (and an orange for later) and headed for the trailhead.  First I forgot my hiking poles, and when I returned to get them, found I had also forgotten my headlamp.  Then the little 3 month old puppy from the hostel followed me down the driveway, squeezed under the fence and started following me to the road, so I had to grab him and hike him back up the driveway to the hostel.  But eventually, I got back on the trail.
The first hour or so was through fields and pastures, before turning up onto a long undulating ridge.  The trail descended again then turned up for the long climb to McAfee Knob.
The parking lot was pretty full for a Thursday, and there were a lot of day hikers on this popular hike. I stopped at a shelter for lunch and talked to a family climbing to the Knob. I finally made it to the top and had my picture taken on the famous ledge that is supposedly the most photographed feature on the AT.  Bob, a volunteer with the Forest Service, was up there and offered to take everyone's photo with their camera.  The views were stupendous, and after a half hour rest I pushed on the Tinker Cliffs, 6 miles off.
Tinker Cliffs, McAfee Knob and the Dragon's tooth make up the ""Virginia Triple Crown"" and I have to say, they were some of the best views so far. Because they're so popular, camping in this stretch is only allowed at designated locations, so I had to push on the Lambert's Meadow Shelter.
The shelter was full, but there are dozens of camping spots nearby.  I hung my hammock on the banks of a stream and after chatting with Seaweed and Peroni for a while, retired and was fast asleep by 8:00
Oh, by the way, I passed 700 miles yesterday!

The Whippoorwills started in around 5:00 this morning which started up the entire morning chorus of birds. It reminds me of when someone's car alarm goes off at some ungodly hour and all the dogs in the neighborhood start barking and no one shuts it off for 1/2 hour.  Oof. But, we are in their neighborhood after all.  
So I was on the trail by 7 this morning.  It was mostly a ridge walk down into Daleville/Troutville with lots and lots of rock scrambles. Virginia Tech is having their graduation somewhere nearby this weekend, so all the hotels are sold out and/or charging premium rates.  And there are lots of young adults in VT paraphernalia on the trails, some dragging their parents and younger sibs along. I wasn't going to stay in town, but I sucked in by the town vortex and managed to get a Quality Inn smoking room for $180.  Yikes.  That's a room where smokers stay, not a smoking hot room.  
So I went to the Verizon Store to fix some phone issues, the Outdoor store and the Kroger for a few resupplies, the Three Little Pigs BBQ for some lunch, walked a mile across a few highways to get to the Hotel, and am now planning on Cracker Barrel for dinner! Making the most of a town day.
Yesterday was 2 months on the trail, so here's my belated 2 month report card:Physical: B+. Legs, knees doing great. A few blisters coming back, nothing too bad.  I am getting stabbing pains between my shoulder blades towards the end of the day and I'm getting some epic chafing on my hip from the pack, but all in all very good for a 62 year old former desk jockey.Emotional: B-. I have my days when I'm down and miss home and Sherpa (every day), but I expected that and I'm not thinking too seriously about quitting. Given that probably half the people that started have dropped out by now, I have to give myself an above average.Spiritual: tough to answer. I'm not sure that I expected and life-changing revelations on the trail, I wasn't hoping to find myself in nature.  But I think I've got some insights into myself and others through the people I've met on the trail and had my faith on the generosity of strangers strengthened and renewed.  I'll give it a C+.","Lambert's Meadow Shelter

I had a very restful night at the hotel and had a BIG free breakfast before I left.  Weather forecast on the TV didn't look very promising for the next few days.  I was out the door by 7:30. 
The mile back to the trailhead was probably the most dangerous I've walked so far: dodging trucks and cars across freeway entrances, traffic circles and underpasses. I started the morning nice and clean and within an hour I was soaked and stinky with sweat again
I passed the 1/3 way mark early on! Suntori took my picture at the sign as he happened to be passing me at the time. 
I met KP (Long John Silver's son) running the trail Southbound, and sure enough, a half hour later here comes LJS himself.  I stopped and had a nice chat with him.  He was staying 2 or 3 days at a hotel in Daleville and slack packing down the trail.  I think he's actually slack packing and staying in hotels more than backpacking and sleeping on the trail.  Hike your own hike, I say, to each their own.  
I had lunch at Wilson Creek Shelter and Suntori was there. After he left I got a nice, closeup look at a pair of Scarlet Tanagers and some Wood-Peewees and Phoebes.
The afternoon was a series of ups and downs. The last 3 or 4 miles the trail came out and started paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway. I was running out of steam again as I was walking through the Montvale Overlook, and here come Top Dog, opens his trunk and says ""want some snacks?"" Yes please: beef sticks, chocolate covered nuts, fig newtons, just what I needed.  The last 3 miles was still a trudge, but I made it to the shelter, found a marginal hammock site, and called it a day.","Daleville

It rained last night, but I stayed dry. After 2 months, I might be getting the hang of this hammock thing!
I was on the trail by 7:00, anxious to get to the meeting spot for my nephew Lucas (Bald Eagle) and his daughter Haley (whom I named Lead Dog for this trip for the way she took charge leading our team of three down the trail) . I was really looking forward to hiking with them.
The day started out foggy but eventually the sun broke through and it was a nice dry day. It was an easy-ish hike down to the parking lot at Jennings Creek. I unpacked all my gear, spread it out on the gravel lot to dry, and repacked everything just when they showed up. And brought me lunch! And fruit! And my resupply box from home! Now I had waayyyy too much food, I couldn't even fit it in my food bag! I also gave them some of my cold weather gear that they are going to get home for me.  
The 7.9 miles to our intended camp was very tough going, but Bald Eagle and Lead Dog are experienced and accomplished hikers, and it was all I could do to keep up with them! 
We pulled into our camping spot a few hours later, filtered water from a distant and very slow flowing spring, made dinner and hung our bear bags.  After dinner we had a chat with Samurai who pulled in late, and hit our respective tents/ hammocks.","Bobblet's Gap Shelter

It started raining around 3:30 am, and rained for the rest of the night.  It stopped raining around 7:15 for an hour or so, just long enough for us to have breakfast, pack up and get on the trail..
All day it was either misting, or hiking in the clouds and fog, so there were no views. But it never rained too hard.
We pulled into camp and it had stopped raining. We filtered water and set up camp.  Soon Stairmaster pulled in and set up his tent and we had a nice chat. He was coming off two zeros with his fiance in Daleville and was putting in big days to try to catch up with his hiking cohort. He gave me some news on the whereabouts of some of the people I'd been hiking with: Northstar was 2 days ahead, Squirrel was now hiking with Fuckit and Pink Flop and Remy was now like 100 miles ahead.  
After dinner it started to rain again so around 6:30 we retreated into our respective sleeping containers for the night.  I finished reading a James Patterson paperback that was so terrible I can't believe I'd carried it with me for the last few weeks, and I burned it in the fire pit the next morning.","Stealth Camp mile 769

Things were drying out nicely by the time we got up, so we had a nice breakfast and got on the trail.  The weather cleared a little during the day and we got some sun on and off. But mostly it was hot and humid and we were soon drenched in sweat. 
Tje rhododendrons are now in full bloom, and we hiked through row after row of them.  Marvelous.
After a climb, we hit a long decline that went through an area posted ""area closed to camping due to aggressive bear activity"". This area included Matt's Creek Shelter where we stopped for lunch, replenished our water, and cleaned up a little in the stream. Around and on the shelter were dozens of these beautiful Red-spotted Admiral butterflies.
After lunch we hiked another mile and crossed the James River on the James River Foot Bridge (ironically named after a couple who did a lot of trail building with the last name of Foot). It was another three or so miles to the Johns Hollow Shelter.
While getting water and soaking our feet in the brook near the shelter, we met a young couple with quite an amazing story to tell.  Two days prior on mother's day, they were tenting at a site a mile above the Matt's Creek Shelter. Within the closed area. A half hour or so after they went to sleep, they were awakened by the snuffling and breathing outside their tent of a bear! Well they tried to scared it away by yelling and making a lot of noise, but it kept circling and charging their tent. They called 911 and got shifted from agency to agency until they finally got to a ranger who didn't cover the area, but at least knew something about bears. It would be hours before anyone could reach them, so with their head light and phone charge both running low, they decided they had to make a break for it.  Backing down the trail in the dark, throwing rocks and actually hitting the bear, the bear was not deterred and followed them down the trail getting as close as eight feet.  Finally after a long while the bear gave up, they reached the road and hitched into town (they had by then lost battery). The next morning they returned to their camp with the ranger from the area with a shotgun (he was off the day before) to retrieve their gear. They found their tent slashed with claw markers, the guy's clothes bag and pack ripped open, but their food, properly hung in a tree, was untouched.  The ranger said the bear (who had a cub) had also harassed a mother and daughter out hiking 2 days before, which is why the signs were posted, and he hoped the bear wouldn't have to be out down.
Well, we were amazed by the story, and also amazed that two days later, here they were continuing their trip, packs and tent repaired with duct tape, and now armed with bear spray.
Right after we finished eating, the skies opened up again, but this time it really poured and everyone ran for their tents. This was the hardest rain I've experienced all trip, and there was a river running right under my hammock.  Poor Lucas and Haley, we had rain every day they were out here, but they were real troopers and their spirits never flagged. Their optimism really kept me going as well.","Harrison Ground Spring

The rain stopped overnight and by morning things were almost dry enough to pack up.  Over the course of the morning we finally got some nice weather and some nice views.
There was a fair amount of climbing in our relatively short day today, but spirits were high and with Lead Dog taking the point, the miles flew by.  We were hiking around Randy (Cloud) who just started out in Roanoke going north, and will then return after Katdahdin to hike the southern part, and Gary, doing a LASH (long-ass section hike). There were also a lot of new thru hikers and section hikers I didn't know.
We made it to Punchbowl Overlook and Lucas' truck by 1:30. They dropped me off at the White Tree Inn Airbnb in Buena Vista that I had booked.  I was sad to see them go.  They are excellent hikers, better company, and we're a real boost to my morale.  
I checked into my room and spread out my gear on their front porch to dry.  I borrowed one of their bikes and rode to a local Mexican restaurant where I gorged myself on Carnitas Especial and a 32 oz. Dos Equis.  Back on my bike to do a small resupply at the Family Dollar store. Back to the Inn, shower, laundry, repack my pack, do my journal, and bam, it's 9:30 and way past my bedtime.","Johns Hollow Shelter

I awoke early so Icould have breakfast before my shuttle back to the trail.  I walked about a mile to this little hole in the wall called Good Kharma, seemingly the only place besides fast food to get breakfast in Buena Vista. They make their own doughnuts, so I had an excellent glazed doughnut and coffee while I waited for my breakfast bowl, which is a hiker's delight: hash browns, a layer of bacon, fried eggs all smothered in an inch of biscuit gravy.  
Happy and full, I waddled back to the White Tree Inn where I was staying.  The Inn is really a circa 1850s house that the owners are restoring and they rent a few rooms through AirBnB.  It's still a work in progress, but for $50 I got a real bed with sheets and pillows, a real shower and bathroom, and the run of a well stocked kitchen, sitting room, and a very nice and helpful proprietor, Marie.
Marie's daughter gave me a shuttle back to Punchbowl Overlook and I got back on the trail.  
The trail was remarkably quiet. It was a sunny breezy morning, the trail was flat and covered with pine needles, and I made good time.  I hiked for a while with Smoke, and when I stopped for lunch I met Freeze and saw Heimlich, whom I'd not seen in a few weeks. He'd been hiking with Movin' On who'd recently left the trail.  
I stopped for an afternoon rest at a shelter to prepare for the final four mile, 2600' climb and saw Long John Silver, slack packing South bound as usual. I should tell LJS he could have saved a ton on his camping gear since he never seems to use it.  I also saw Aloha and his crew who are hiking out to Rt 60 to wait for a ride down to Trail Days in Damascus.  Trail Days is a big bacchanalian festival every year that celebrates the AT and draws hundreds of vendors and thousands of current and past thru hikers and hangers on.  
The climb went well, and before I knew it I was at Cow Camp Gap considering the .6 climb down to the shelter.  As there didn't seem to be any good camping or water options in the next 5 - 6 miles, down I went.  I'm here with Smoke, Mousetrap, and Happy knees. Oh, did I mention I hit 800 miles today?!?

I can understand why people say the hike starts to become like a job at this point: wake up, put on the same clothes, eat the same thing, pack up in the same way, and walk, walk, walk.  This is where the nickname for the AT ""The Long Green Tunnel"" really starts to make sense.  As spring fully takes hold, it can seem as if you're  surrounded by nothing for green for miles on end with no views and little variation. Of course there's actually endless variation of you pay attention, but people start to get bored at this point.
There was a Facebook post in one of the AT thru hiker pages asking how one avoids boredom on a thru hike, followed by the usual inane comments. But it got me to thinking. I thought three things.
First, you can distract yourself. There are many ways to do this: listening to music, podcasts, using apps like iNaturalist or Merlin to learn more about the floral and fauna you're walking through, even writing this blog is a form of distraction.
Second, you can embrace the boredom. In daily life we're so distracted by readily available media that our attention spans have been wrecked (I know mine has) and we've become conditioned to always, always have to be entertained. But boredom leads to daydreaming, and daydreaming leads to creativity and creation. One of my goals on this trip was to get bored, to try to release my mind from the constant craving for social media, TV, and activity.
Third, be fully present. Practice mindfulness. Be in the moment, and fully experience the hike. The sights, the smells, the feelings, and do it with a sense of gratitude. This is my ultimate goal, and something I struggle to do so often.
So back to the hike. After walking the .6 back up to the trail, I continued north through foggy woods and overcast skies. It was a little chilly in the mid 50's. I leapfrogged Smoke for most of the day.  I ran into Long John Silver getting dropped by a shuttle at Salt Log Gap at 10.:00.  He was trying to do 27 miles today to catch up with his son, but he was getting a late start. I saw him later at a lunch break and he definitely was not on a pace to finish by dark, and since he was slack  packing, he didn't have much gear: it was being dropped at the end by the shuttle driver. I sure hope he makes it.
In the afternoon the sun came out just in time for me to take a break at Spy Rock with great 360° views. I made some family phone calls and left in a much better mood.
I'm now at The Priest Mt Shelter. There are around 8 tents here, almost all containing men in the over 50 age range. I think that's the effect of Trail Days drawing off so many of the younger crowd. 
Priest Shelter also has a log book where people write down their ""confessions"". Most are comical, such as ""forgive me father for I have sinned, I have unpure thoughts about the all women I see on the trail. Even the ugly ones"". But there are also some genuine heartfelt entries, like one talking about the breakup of his marriage.","Cow Camp Gap Shelter

The hiking part of today was tough. 5400' total ascent and 4000' descent in fifteen and a half miles. This was one of the toughest days on the trip, certainly the toughest since leaving North Carolina.
Most of the descent was right after leaving camp and climbing to the top of The Priest Mountain: a straight 4000' descent that while taxing in the knees, was definitely the easy part.  I was down in about 2 hours. This being Saturday, there were many day hikers and over-nighters out, which I love to see. While some thru hikers think they deserve some kind of special status on the trail, I think we are privileged to use a public resource so extensively and the trails belong to the average citizen and love to see people enjoying them so thoroughly.
Then the climb up a grueling opposite slope, making the day's climb like a 4000' letter ""V"". But there's also a 300' descent in the middle of the climb making the total ascent 4300'.
The non-hiking part of the day was fantastic, though. At the start of the climb I passed members of the Tidewater Appalachian Trail Club (TACT), all the way out from the Norfolk area on one of their 2 annual Trail maintenance weekends. They drive the 4 hours from the Tidewater area in the spring and in the fall with smaller trips in between to clip, dig, saw and clean the trail into shape. While taking lunch at one of the shelters they maintain, Michelle invited Smoke and me to dinner at the campgrounds where they were staying. They planned on 60 people for dinner but only had 40 people there. We promised we could help them with some of that extra food!  And we could camp over and use the facilities (hot showers!). And she would pick us up and have us dropped off at the trail head! Mega Trail Magic! 
So that lit a fire under us and gave us a time limit to finish the climb and subsequent descent to Reid's Gap parking lot where. My legs were burning and my will was wavering by the time I made it through the Three Ridges Wilderness. Michele was waiting as promised at 4:30. She drove us back to the campground where the TACT was staying and the people could not have been nicer.  A great dinner (and seconds and thirds), great conversations afterwards, people pulled out their battery packs and opened their cars so we could recharge our electronics, arranged to get us back on the trail tomorrow, and gave us food to take with us! Thank you TACT, what a wonderful and generous group of people!","The Priest Mt. Shelter

I was up, ate breakfast and packed an hour and a half before our ride back to the trailhead was scheduled to leave.  I chatted with some of the TACT members and Andy decided he could take us a few minutes early and drop us off.
The morning was sunny and cool, the trail was flat but very rocky. I caught up to Trotter again, hadn't seen her since before Dragon's Tooth.  Around 11 we ran into some Trail Magic from a guy whose daughter had thru hiked 5 years earlier.  He was also interviewing people on an NSF grant about how they regulated body temperature and dealt with over heating while cold weather hiking. I was more than happy to be interviewed as thanks for the bagel with cream cheese, Coke and fresh fruit. At the trail magic was Smoke, Trotter, Creiger and Mama-razzi
There was a moderate climb in the afternoon with some nice views.  Overall, this was some of the easiest hiking I've had yet, and a welcomed change from yesterday. If it looked like there was some decent camping options past the Paul C. Wolff Shelter where I stopped, I would have pushed But there doesn't seem to be any for another 12 miles or so. So I'm camped here between the shelter and a nice running stream with a half dozen other tents.

Trotter had arranged a shuttle into town and Smoke and I were thinking of hopping onto it too.  So I was up early and careful to not wake Elsa and her dog Goose who has camped a few feet from my hammock.  By 9:00 I was standing at the kiosk at Rockfish Gap talking to Long John Silver and his family.
I decided it was too early for me to go to town since I didn't have much I had to do there, and kept hiking into Shenandoah National Park (SNP). After some hassle, I arranged a shuttle to pick me up at Beagle Gap in the park
Shuttle Driver Mary picked me up before 1:00, and in the front seat was section hiker Houston whom I'd met several times before. On our way out of the park we also picked up Elsa and Goose and Forest Walker, who also was at the shelter the night before.  
I checked into the Quality Inn and was able to shower before Sherpa and my friend Jeff (who I'll call ""Jim"", since I seem to be giving everyone nicknames in the blog) arrived.
We went out to Blue Mountain Brewery, a restaurant on the other side of Rockfish Gap where Sherpa and I had been before, and they stuffed me full of food. On the way back we visited a winery, the outfitter, then did a small resupply at Walmart and topped the night off with some ice cream.
Back at the room I repacked and did laundry. Then we played a game of Five Crowns and watched some TV and went to bed.  What a great day!","Paul C. Wolff Shelter

Frostbite was in town staying at Stanimal's Hostel, so we picked him up and went to breakfast at Weasie's Kitchen.  Over omelets and biscuits and gravy, we made plans to meet up tomorrow and continue hiking together.
Back at the hotel, we packed up and checked out, then headed to the Ranger's station at Shenandoah National Park.  Sherpa bought her Senior Lifetime National Park pass which we hope to make good use of in the future, and which also covered our entrance into the park.
We drove to Beagle Pass where the shuttle had picked me up the day before, and ""Jim"" and I slack packed 3 miles or so and Sherpa picked us up at a road crossing.  Donning my pack, I said a sad farewell to ""Jim"" and Sherpa.  
I wasn't going far because I was slowing down to let Frostbite catch up.  I felt a little down as I hiked to a stealth camp site by the Riprap Trail.  I was at the site by 4:20 and am camping by myself tonight.
People I saw on trail today are Ron from Belgium,  Timber, Baggins (the other one) and Mme Morrell, Long John Silver, Pink Flop, Mantis and Squirrel (!).
I'm being passed up by a bunch of people who had passed me by a few weeks ago ànd took a few days off to go to Trail Days in Damascus. I'm also being passed by people who started a few weeks after I did but are stronger hikers now getting their trail legs and are doing 20+ days. I believe everyone has to hike at their own pace, but I'm starting to get anxious as everyone is passing me by. Not because it's some kind of race, but because I know I can be doing more miles: the trail is easier, the days are longer, and I'm feeling good. And I'm starting to look forward to this hike being over.
When I meet back up with Frostbite, we talked about putting in some bigger days. I hope it works.","Beagle Gap

I woke up early and was on the trail by 7:30. It was a beautiful, sunny, breezy day.  I was in no particular hurry. I only had about 10 miles to hike to the camp where I would wait for Frostbite to catch up, and that would put at camp around noon.  I stopped to talk to section hiker Duo for a while, and later Houston, whom I've seen 5 or 6 times now 
The walk up Blackrock Mt was long and arduous, but at least the views from the top were worth it.  The top of Blackrock is a jumble of granite boulders, ranging in size from 2-3 feet to 15-20 feet. If you scramble to the top you're rewarded with an excellent 360⁰ view.
I got to Loft Mt Campsite run by the National Forest Service around 12:30.  I went to the ranger station and purchased my senior citizen (!) Lifetime America the Beautiful park pass.  It gets you into any national park for free and gives you discounts on other things, such as 50% off the campsite I was booking.  I chose a beautiful tent site overlooking the AT with nice views of the valley below.  I walked to the camp store to recharge my phone, buy a sandwich for lunch, some ice cream, a beer etc. While there I chatted with Waldo, Smoke, Trotter, Baggins and Mme Morrell, and Pink Flop who were all doing the same. 
Then I went back to the camp site to await the arrival of Frostbite.  There he goes, walking down the AT and right past the camp site until I hailed him and he turned in.  A happy reunion, with plans to walk together again for as long as the fates allow.","Stealth campsite mile 881.1

Many of my readers have been worrying about Frostbite: ""Where is Frostbite OK?"", ""When are you meeting Frostbite?"" ""Is Frostbite OK?"".  Sheesh people he's fine and he's here! He's fit as a fiddle and ready to play, as me ol' Da used to say.
It got down to the lower 40s last night. I didn't think I'd see those temperatures again for a while, but it's going to be in the 40s at night for the next few.
It's strange how luxurious it feels to have a picnic table and a water spigot that you don't have to filter after backpacking for a few months. It was nice staying at the camp.
It started out cold today and warmed up a little, but stayed a real nice day for hiking.  We only met one other thru hiker: Purple Haze, who is finishing up the triple crown this year (the AT, the CDT and the PCT). Other than that, it was a nice bunch of day hikers and section hikers. The hike today was pretty unremarkable, but we did pass the 900 mile mark! The hike looked pretty flat on the map, but we still did 4800' ascent and 4200' descent over 19 miles, so I was knackered  by the time we got to our stealth camp just past US 33.
I hung my hammock, made some dinner, Frostbite and I made some tentative plans for the next few days, then crawled inside our sleeping bags while the sun was still up to journal and relax. It's nice to be back hiking with Frostbite!","Loft Mt Campground

Frostbite and I slept a little late, so we didn't get on the trail until a little after 8. Nonetheless, we had a plan to eat lunch at a Camp Store at one of the park campsites, dinner at one of the camp grills or ""waysides"", and still get 20 miles in.
We made it to Lewis Mountain Camp Store by 11:30 for an early lunch: ham and cheese sandwich, a honeybun, chips and a soda. And we made it to Big Meadows Wayside by 4:30 for dinner: double cheeseburger, fries, a beer and one of their trail-famous blackberry milkshakes. I got my calories today! 
Frostbite and I have this running joke that after someone stops us to ask us about our thru hike, we say to each other ""you're such a rock star!"". Well a girl actually asked to have her picture taken with us today. But no autographs. We're such rock stars!
The last 2 miles today were tough, but we made our 20! We made it to the shelter by 7:00. There were a lot of people there and we only knew one or two of them. This being the beginning of Memorial Day weekend, there were a lot of section hikers. There was a dearth of hammock or tent spots, so we decided to stay in the shelter.
New or significant birds today: at lunch I got a terrific look at a blackburnian warbler. It's a beautiful, bright orange and yellow little bird and I think the first time I'd ever seen one.","Stealth Camp site just past US 33

Last night we went to bed around 8:30 after the last of the campers finished dinner and left the area in front of the shelter where Frostbite and I were the only ones staying.  Around 9:15 this group of 12 young men come marching in with their head lamps and flashlights on, looking for a place to camp.  All the tent sites being full, they moved the picnic table from in front of the shelter, pitch their tents right there, lit a fire in the fire ring and started cooking dinner over the open fire.  Around 11:00 after much noise, clatter, and flashlights shining in my face I'd finally had enough and yelled at them to shut up.  My only consolation is I thought I'd get revenge when we got up at 6:00 the next morning to hike out.  No such luck.  They were up at 5:30 talking and laughing and rekindling the fire.  I got maybe 4 hours of sleep. I woke Frostbite up and told him I had enough and was leaving.
Pro tip: if you're looking for peace and quiet, avoid national parks on holiday weekends. 
The upside is we were at Skylands Resort by 8:30 for the all you can eat breakfast buffet.  Three helpings and several cups of coffee later we were back on the trail.
By 2 o'clock we were at Mary's Rock, a very popular day hike destination and the first stop inside the park for many people.  I was surprised to find 50 or 60 people hanging out on top of the rock.  In our 2 mile trip down to the parking lot we passed at least another 100 people heading up.  I could not imagine where they all came from until I saw the enormous parking lot at the trail head.  See ""Pro tip"", above.
We got to our stealth camp by 6:00 having completed our 20 and camped with a really nice couple, Micheal and Jess, doing a couple day hike in the park. They are both accomplished hikers and Micheal was warming up for a hike in the Cascades next week with his friends.
There was a very friendly young buck wandering around and into our camp.  He wasn't afraid of us at all and had obviously been acclimated to people.  He was like someone's big pet dog.","Rock Spring Hut

I was awoken around 6:00 by our deer friend poking his head around and under my hammock tarp.  I think he was trying to get at my salt-stained hiking shirt stored under my hammock.  I think I woke up the whole camp trying to shoo him away, but he would not be deterred.  He didn't move away until I got out of my hammock and threatened him with my hiking pole.
Saying goodbye to Michael and Jess, we were on the trail by 7:30 and at the Elkwallow Wayside for breakfast by 8:30: 2 Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, 2 coffees and 2 chocolate cupcakes
We stopped at Gravel Spring Hut for lunch and water.  I met a nice brother and sister hiking duo, Cruise Control and Encore.  There were tons of day hikers out today, which is nice when they're all spread out. 
We hiked out of Shenandoah National Park having completed it in 6 days.  We got to Tom Floyd shelter just outside the park boundary. The shelter is full tonight with Fuckit, Cruise Control and Encore, Mme Morrell and Baggins, and a college professor from Germany taking a few days in the woods after his conference in DC. 
New and notable birds today:-Hanging outside the Wayside, I had a very nice view of a pair of cedar waxwings. (Visual)- Barred owl (call: ""who cooks for you? Who cooks for you?"")-Yellow-billed Cockoo (call.  I'd love to see this bird)- Red-eyed vireo (visual, call)-Cerulean warbler (call)-Ruffed Grouse. I was walking down the trail and kicked a stick off to the side which scared a little brown chick hiding in the bushes.  The momma grouse jumped out in the trail in front of me, puffed out her chest and spread her tail feathers like a cartoon turkey, looked me in the eye and said ""come at me bro!"". After her chick was a safe distance away she deflated and strutted off the trail. Chalk one up for momma grouse.","Stealth Camp mile 950

It started raining around midnight and rained pretty much all night and morning, hard at times.  But I stayed dry and was able to pack up my gear with only the rain tarp getting wet. Success
Frostbite and I hiked the short 3 miles to Rt 522 where Dave from the Stumble Inn Hostel picked us up.  He drove us to the 7-11 so we could pick up some breakfast, coffee and lunch before heading to the Hostel.
Dave and Danielle were thru hikers around 2019 and decided to open the Stumble Inn as a not for profit enterprise allowing underprivileged kids to participate in 4H summer programs that get them learning STEM subjects in outside environments.  
The Hostels I've stayed in fall into a few categories.  There are the ones with the commune vibes (Standing Bear and Woods Hole), there's the rustic cabin camps (Blood Mt Cabins, Black Bear, Uncle Johnny's), the ""stick everyone up in the attic"" (Station at 19E) and the ""come stay in my home"" (Quarter Way Inn, White Tree, and Stumble Inn). It's a close tie between the Quarter Way Inn and Stumble Inn for the nicest of the bunch.
Dave and Danielle have a beautiful log cabin home and they've finished the basement with 3 bed rooms with 2 bunk beds in each, a brand new kitchen, bathroom, common room, covered porch with a grill, everything you could want. A great place to stay and rest.
After lunch, laundry and showers we went to downtown Front Royal for dinner at a brewpub, ice cream and resupply at the supermarket.
We're here in the Hostel with Shade, Silva, Operator, and the Chipmunk Tramily (Papa Smurf, Applesauce, Trail Boss and a few others). The best part is we missed a day of hiking in the rain.","Tom Floyd Wayside

Danielle at the Stumble Inn fixed us a killer breakfast of biscuits and gravy, eggs, pastries, juice and COFFEE.  We packed up and we were back on the trail by 9:00.
The morning started out hot and humid and we were quickly drenched in sweat. My nice clean clothes! About a half mile in from the road we came upon a baby fawn laying right on the edge of the trail. It could not have been more than a few days old. It was laying totally still, but breathing and we wondered if it was ok.  A young lady just in front of us left a note ""please don't disturb the fawn. It's ok and the mother knows it's here"" laying on the grass right next to the fawn  How she knew the mother knew I don't know. But Smoke and Trotter, whom we hiked with on and off throughout the day, were about a half hour behind us and said when the passed the note was still there but the fawn was not, so I guess it was just fine.
We took our first break at the Jim and Molly Denton shelter. It's a fabulous shelter with a big deck with Adirondack chairs, a separate cooking pavilion, horseshoe pit, and a spring-fed shower. 
At the 16 mile mark, the guide showed a camp site and then no other camping opportunities for another 7 or so miles after the trail passed through a state park with camping prohibitions. The problem was the camp site had been bulldozed and sprayed with an herbicide, apparently in preparation for building some houses. It was a very unappealing place to camp, and there were no trees for hammocking at the site or within 1/2 mile. so I decided to ""cowboy camp"" which is just sleeping on the ground in the open. I rigged up my hammock tarp over my sleeping area to keep off the morning dew.  Frostbite and I built a small camp fire to cheer up the place before I crawled under my tarp for the night.
New and notable birds: yellow breasted chat, voice ID'd and then seen by me singing from the top of a dead tree just before the sun went down.  I must have added a dozen or more new birds (Including the chat) to my life list on this trip. I was never really and avid birder and don't have a comprehensive life list. I've always incorporated casual birding not whatever other activity I was doing. But this Merlin app has really added to my enjoyment of IDing a wider variety of birds.","Rt 522

I slept great in my cowboy camp last night. I woke up every hour and a half or so, but was very comfortable and went right back to sleep.
Trotter, who had also camped by us, was up and out by the time I crawled out of bed at 6:30.  By 7:30 when we had breakfast and packed, Smoke found us and we hiked together for the rest of the day.
The first 7 miles passed quickly as the trail was smooth and flat as it wended its way through the state park.  At around 11:00 we entered ""The Rollercoaster"" which is a 12 mile stretch of trail that runs over 10 or 12 roughly equally sized  sinusoidal peaks. By 1:00 we'd hit the 1000 Mike mark and we all stopped to take our pictures. 
By 4:30 we'd done only 17 miles but also over 4500' in ascent and 4000' in descent thanks to the rollercoaster, and all three of us were knackered, so we decided to stay at the Bears Den Hostel which was right off the trail.  The Bears Den Hostel is a beautiful stone mansion that had been willed to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) and is run by the Potomac  Appalachian Trail Club (PATC). I decided to hammock outside because it was going to be a good weather night.  For $18 I got laundry, a shower, use of the hostel (sitting room, hiker room, tv etc) and a pancake breakfast the next morning.
I set up my hammock near Granny Square, Yoga and Trotter. In addition to a beautiful old building, the grounds are beautiful and wonderful to camp out on.
We walked to the Bears Chase craft brewery and restaurant for dinner (beautiful place) then came back and had a piece of homemade pie someone had made, a few slices of pizza, made plans for the next few days with Frostbite, Smoke and Trotter, and went to bed.

By the time I got into the Hostel in the morning, Trotter and Smoke had already fixed the coffee and were making pancakes.  I had 2 helpings of pancakes with syrup and berry compote and a few cups of coffee.  
Back on the trail, we finished up the last 2 humps of the Rollercoaster, then the trail flattened out for the rest of the day.  Around noon we took a side trail that lead down to the Blackburn Trail Center, another facility owned and operated by the PATC. We filled our water bottles, lounged on their screened in porch, chatted with the caretaker for a while and enjoyed a complimentary soda and Cutie orange.
Back on the trail, we reached the Virginia/West Virginia border! Glad to be finally done with Virginia and moving on to the remaining 10 states! 
When Frostbite and I hit Rt 9 we hung a right and walked the road for 1/4 mile to a gas station where we did a minor resupply, had some ice cream, a gatorade, and packed out sandwiches for dinner. Frostbite even bummed a ride for us back to the trailhead from some guy in a pickup truck getting gas.
A few miles later we reached our intended campsite, called 4 mile Campsite because it's 4 miles outside Harpers Ferry. I'm here with Frostbite, Trotter and Smoke.
Highlights of the day include seeing a big rattlesnake just a few feet off the path and getting a closeup look at a Pileated Woodpecker tearing apart a rotten log and eating the grubs.
A few days ago in the Shenandoahs, a guy hikes by me and Frostbite taking a break and asks ""Are you guys brothers? You look so much alike!"". Not 10 minutes later as I'm walking by a young day hiker with his dog he does a double take at me and says ""didn't I just see you? Some who looks exactly like you just walked by!"" And I said ""no, just some other old white dude with a gray beard. We all look the same"". So now that we're walking with Smoke, we're really going to mess with their heads.  Do we really look that much alike?

It was beautiful sleeping weather last night and I slept without a tarp for the first time.  Trotter and Smoke left early and Frostbite and I met them around 8:45 at the ATC building in Harpers Ferry.  We ran down to a bakery a block away and got a coffee and cinnamon bun while waiting for the office to open.
Harpers Ferry is the ""spiritual halfway point"" in the trail; the actual halfway point is another 60 miles ahead.  We checked in when they opened and had our pictures taken for the official record.  I was number 455 to check in whereas my start number was 978, which means about half the people who started before me either dropped out, are behind me, or bypassed the check-in.
Trotter hiked on, but Frostbite, Smoke and I walked downtown and looked at a number of the historical buildings and exhibits.  Then we went to the outfitters for a few things we needed and had an early lunch at a bar and grill. We walked back up the hill to the ATC headquarters to retrieve our packs and electronics which we left charging before heading back down the hill to the trail (and grabbing some ice cream in the way).
The trail here crosses the Potomac River on a railroad bridge, then along the C&O canal tow path bike trail for a few miles before turning uphill to the shelter.  On the way up I passed 80-90 5th graders and their teachers/chaperones on and end of year class trip.  They were so cute asking questions about my hike.  
Just Smoke, Frostbite and I are at the shelter. Trotter must have hiked on.  The Ed Garvey Memorial Shelter is an excellent shelter with varnished wood floors, a second story reached by an external staircase with big plexiglass windows overlooking the deck below which has a picnic table and benches.  The fire pit has benches around it and a large tenting area has its own picnic table.
The weather is supposed to be beautiful all week with the exception of some possible brief showers the day after tomorrow.  We should be able to make some good mileage.","4 mile campsite

Pickles and Sticky came in late last night. It was nice to see them, hadn't seen them since Damascus. 
It was a cool and breezy night, and I slept well in my hammock without a tarp, but as soon as I got on the trail my legs felt heavy and I felt sluggish.  I had a protein bar and some electrolytes and that seemed to help a little.
The first part of the hike was flat as we walked along the ridge of South Mountain, but there were tons of rocks so the going was a little slow.  We walked through a Maryland State Park at Crampton's Gap where a civil war battle was fought as part of the Union's attempt to break McLaw's siege on Harpers Ferry. We took off our packs and read the many plaques and signs.  There was also a monumental arch in honor of war correspondents who gave their lives in combat zones. There were 4 new plaques in honor of journalists who gave their lives covering the ""War on Terror"".
A little further on we crossed another battle field at Fox Gap. Here also was a monument to General Reno, the first Union general to die in battle.
Next, we had lunch at a campground maintained by the PATC and even used their shower house: hot water and soap! Frostbite and Smoke decided to have a pizza delivered at the next road crossing, but I decided to eat lunch from my food store and hiked on.
I hiked through Washington Monument State Park where the first complete monument to George Washington was built by the townspeople of Boonesboro in 1827. There was also a ""Trails Days"" event being held there, which perhaps explained the dozens of day hikers and weekend hikers I encountered today. I also ran into at least 3 Scout troops. The trails were getting their workout today.  
After a steep climb I reached our intended target: Annapolis Rock, which is evidently a popular day hike destination. They have a dozen or so designated campsites, a privy, a piped spring, and an on-site caretaker to look after it all.  And also nice views from the rock ledges.  All built and maintained by the PATC.
Now I'm settled into camp and taking in the views from Annapolis Rock, waiting for Frostbite and Smoke to show up.  What are the chances the saved me a slice of pizza? (Answer: zero)","Ed Garvey Memorial Shelter

It was an overcast morning, so I went to the cliffs without expecting a view while the others were getting ready. What I did see was a small group of cedar waxwings chasing each other around through the hemlock trees. Such beautiful birds!
The morning was a long, rocky ridge walk, and by the time we got to Ensign Cowell Shelter, Frostbite was struggling. He had mentioned back at camp that he wanted to hike a few short days: 10 or 11 miles.  I decided that I needed to hike more than that for various reasons and decided to hike on.  It was a difficult decision, but I hope to be back with him and Smoke before long 
And there was another Squirrel sighting! He and his tramily took a few days off in Harpers Ferry and so were behind us, passing us for probably the 5th or 6th time.
High Rocks is an outcropping above Waynesboro PA, and evidently it's socially acceptable to spray paint and graffiti the rocks. I didn't go out to the rocks, but many of the trees and rocks on the way back down were all spray painted up. It was disheartening and sad to see.  
The climb down from High Rocks was extremely difficult and rocky. Soon I was at PenMar Park, a park right in the Pennsylvania/Maryland border.  They had a band playing at the bandshell and the park was full of family picnickers and dancing oldsters. And and ice cream truck! 
While I was reveling in my Maryland Mud/Apple Pie double waffle cone, a couple came up to me and Waldo on the park bench and started chatting about our hike, then asked if we needed anything, like a resupply ride into town.  Yes please! 
Daryl and Jen were the nicest couple, and evidently they come down to the park periodically to see if the can find hikers and provide trail magic. They dropped us off at the Walmart in Waynesboro and gave us their numbers so we could text them when we needed a ride back.  After resupply, Waldo and I walked across the parking lot for dinner at Applebee's, then texted Daryl and Jen to pick us up.  They were there in a few minutes and a few minutes later we were back in the park and walking down the trail. Thanks Daryl and Jen, you were so generous and kind!
A few minutes later, I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and thus into Pennsylvania.  We've now completed 6 states (GA, TN, NC, VA, WV, MD) and have 8 more to go (PA, NJ, NY, CT, MA, VT, NH, Maine) Another 0.9 miles and I found a campsite and was down for the night.","Annapolis Rock

Around 10:00 this morning I passed Fire and Kanga taking a break by a stream. After chatting for a while they mentioned that they always have the bad luck of taking a break in the wrong place, like 50 feet before they hit trail magic. Well, not 50 feet after talking to them I passed a sign reading ""Trail magic today. Yes really!"", then ""Trail Magic this way"", and ""You're almost there, just up this hill!"". Upon climbing said hill into Old Forge State Park, I saw Tycoon by a picnic pavilion with the charcoal grill going and Reboot and Adirondack already digging in. A few minutes later, Fire and Kanga come up, laughing at their continued bad timing.  
A former thru hiker himself, Tycoon had everything a thru hiker could want: hot dogs, soda, Gatorade, chips, snack cakes, battery charger, repair kits, hand sanitizer refills, OTC medication, you name it.  I myself had 4 hot dogs (he insisted!), 2 chips, a soda, and a Gatorade.  Tycoon was also full of advice and information about the upcoming trail sections. Thanks Tycoon!
All that fuel prepared me for the following 1000' climb up to Chimney Rock. At Chimney Rock, Trotter and I ran into Patchwork who was also at the trail magic. Patchwork invited the two of us to camp with her and her husband at Caledonia State Park which was my target destination anyway.  We quickly accepted, and the three of us leapfrogged each other and Kanga and Fire (whom she also invited) the rest of the day.
The trail down to Caledonia was lined for literally miles on both sides and as far back as you could see with beautiful blooming mountain laurels.  We were all in awe and took many photos and videos.  Just gorgeous!
When we reached the park, Patchwork went ahead with Fire and Kanga while I waited for Trotter. Trotter and I walked into the park and waited for Patchwork's husband, Hawkeye, to come pick us up.  There was a little miscommunication about where to pick us up, but he found us after about a half hour. On the way to the campsite, Hawkeye told us about the history of the land the park was on when it belonged to Thaddeus Stevens, congressman and famous abolitionist. You may recall he was played by Tommy Lee Jones in the movie ""Lincoln"".
Hawkeye is supporting Patchwork's hike after she injured her IT band back around the Smokies and had to take 5 weeks off the trail. Patchwork now skips around doing different sections of the trail, which is how I believe she got her name.
Hawkeye and Patchwork were so gracious and generous, giving the four of us all kinds of food from their cooler.  Hawkeye even split his beer with me!

Before I went to bed last night I considered leaving my power bank charging over night in the camp restroom since we were only 50 yards from it and could see it from our campsite, then thought better of it.  Unfortunately, Kanga and Fire did not think better of it.  When they went to retrieve their electronics this morning, someone had stolen their 3 power banks, all their cords, and Kanka's $400 Garmin satellite communicator.  On the trail you grow to trust the people you're hiking with so that you normally don't give a second thought to leaving your belongings unattended, but we're in a public park now.
Kanga, Hawkeye and I jumped in the car and went to the spot where the Garmin last pinged around 10:30 the previous night.  We walked up and down the trail and surrounding park land expecting to find a couple of kids passed out in a tent, but found nothing.  
Dispirited, we headed back to camp and Trotter and I headed out after getting dropped off at the trail again by Patchwork.  We leapfrogged Reboot and Adirondack for most of the day.  This was Adirondack's last day of his 2 week LASH (Long-Ass Section Hike).
I stopped in at some trail magic hosted by Jessie when we crossed a dirt road called Dead Woman Gap Road.  I'm sure there's a story behind that name somewhere.
The length of the AT changes slightly every year as the trail is rerouted and switchbacks are put in, so therefore the midpoint changes every year.  There's a nice signboard where the 2022 midpoint was, and a few miles on a really nice Boy Scout-built monument where the 2011 midpoint was.  Somewhere in between, at mile 1099.2, there's a little ""1/2"" sign built out of rocks and twigs on the side of the path where this year's midpoint is.  But the lack of monumental signage didn't diminish the emotions I felt having finished the first half of this beast.  A little less exciting was the 1100 mile marker I passed 0.8 miles later.
I got to Pine Grove Furnace State Park General Store a few minutes after Trotter did, around 5:00.  Pickles, Sticky and, Riddle had already started on the famous ""Half Gallon Challenge"" where you eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting to commemorate the half way point of the trail. Frankly, I think it's a shrewd marketing ploy by the General Store to sell lots of ice cream because over the next 2 hours there were about a dozen thru hikers there each eating a half gallon of ice cream.  Trotter and I both opted for the ""one pint challenge"" and were better off for it.
I had decided to rent a campsite for the night but the office closed at 4 and you could not reserve same-day on line, so as I started to walk down to the camp sites to investigate, I hear ""Paul!"". I turn around and who is it but our friends and neighbors  Mike and Vicki! Mike had texted me earlier in the day asking where I was going and I told him Pine Grove SP. Well they were driving home from South Carolina on I-81 and made a sharp right turn and met me at the park.  Mike drove me around to find a campsite, bought me dinner, and Vicki gave me and Trotter everything we would take out of their cooler.  It was great catching up with them.
Trotter decided to split the campsite with me so we walked down and found one, I took a shower, brushed my teeth, and it was off to bed for me.
Frostbite had noted soon after we left Shenandoah NP and were approaching Harpers Ferry how the noise from air traffic had increased now that we were under Washington DC air space.  I started noticing how traffic noise and train noise was now a near constant as opposed to a rare exception like it was further south.  We're also crossing several roads a day instead of one road every several days.  I expect this trend to continue as we approach Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
P.S. I got a text from Kanga tonight.  His Garmin started pinging again as we were leaving the campsite.  Using the coordinates they tracked down where the thieves had thrown the device in the woods, right near where we had been looking for them in the morning.  I guess they realized that we could track them down if they used the device, or at the very least deactivate the device so it was unusable.  Kanga and Fire are still out a hundred and fifty bucks in power banks, but at least he got the most expensive piece of gear back!","Caledonia State Park

I was up early, but you have to get up very early to beat a Trotter! By 6:00 she was packed and ready to go.  I figured I'd get breakfast first at the General Store, but I got there at 7:00 and the sign said they didn't open until 9:00. I didn't want to wait, so I pushed on.
The first mile or so wound through the State Park and past some of the historical features before turning up and through the woods.  I soon got behind Terry and chatted with him for a while. Terry's wife was supporting him on his hike and waiting for him at a road crossing up ahead.  Terry was well traveled and he and his wife had traveled and hiked all over the world so he was interesting to talk to.  
I took a morning break at the James Fry Shelter, and decided to push on past the shelter I'd originally planned to stop at so I would have a shorter hike on Thursday to where my niece was going to pick me up.
The trail was generally flat and easy today, but there was one section that ran across a hog's back ridge with many large rocks, and the trail builders seemed to relish in taking us through the most difficult crevasses and over the most difficult boulders. 
The last mile or so was through wheat, corn and soybean fields that it seems the ATC has purchased and leases out to farmers to preserve their ""historic and pastoral"" setting.  The AT Backpackers Campsite is on the edge of one of these fields.  Here are Trotter, Riddle, and a few others.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

The Far Out app I use to navigate the trail has user comments that note the freight trains that pass by the campsite I'm at during the night. What they didn't mention is that the tracks are literally 50 feet behind the campsite.  Every hour or so throughout the night the trains came: whistles blowing, brakes screeching, cars rumbling.  Around 5:30 I gave up trying to sleep and started packing up.  
The walk first took me through Boiling Springs and a town park being renovated. After a street walk, the trail turned behind a few businesses and next to some farm fields.  The Cumberland Valley where I am is pretty populated and housing developments and warehouses are going up all over.  The ATC seems to have bought several tracts of land in order to build a buffer around the trail and leases them back to farmers to preserve the ""pastoral and historic"" nature of the trail. The result is sometimes like walking on a small weedy patch between a parking lot on one side and an empty lot on the other. Very different from the ""wilderness"" feel of the first half of the trail.  Not my favorite, but I guess it will often be like this until I get past New York.
I was trending an hour early for my rendezvous with my niece Jess and her husband, Junie, so after crossing Rt 11 I climbed down to the highway and walked a half mile to the Middlesex Diner and ordered the Hungry Man Omelette, which I polished off with no trouble. 
The trail was flat and easy, which meant I was still 1/2 hour to meet Jess.  Junie picked me up at 1:00 and took me to their house where I spent the afternoon and evening showering, doing laundry, eating, drinking, and catching up with my wonderful niece and family. 
Notable birds today: Eastern Meadowlark (I'd heard them before, but got a visual ID today) and a female wood duck and about a dozen little ducklings (so cute!)","AT Backpackers Campsite

I had a nice breakfast with my niece and her husband, then they both drove me along with their big german shepherd Klaus. I got on the trail and about a mile later, there were all three of them standing on the trail where it crossed another road! What a great time I had with them, and they were so generous with their hone and their time.  
It was a fairly mild walk until about 1/2 way through the Pennsylvania ROCKS appeared, for which the state is so famous (in AT circles, anyway). The result was that I was pretty tired by the time I climbed down the last hill into the town of Duncannon, even though I'd only hiked 13 mikes  
Duncannon is a rundown little town, but it's very friendly to hikers with many hiker-friendly businesses and hostels.  I checked into the Doyle Hotel, an AT landmark which had supposedly been completely renovated.  At least that's how they justify charging $60 for a room with ancient garbage-picked furniture on a four-floor walkup and a shared bathroom on the third floor. I'd hate to see what it was like BEFORE they renovated it. Based on the construction materials in the hall, maybe they just haven't gotten to the fourth floor yet.
I went to the bar for a beer and jalapeno poppers and there was Squirrel! He was waiting for his family to come pick him up for a few days to celebrate his birthday. It was nice catching up with him. 
I went down the street for a sub-standard pizza, then back to the Doyle for a beer and to listen to the local musician they had in the bar, but I was too tired.  Couldn't even finish my beer! So I retired to my room with the door knob falling off and the extension cord running across the middle of the floor so they could plug in the air conditioner.  I'm sleeping on top of the covers tonight!","Sherwood Drive

It's been so nice to be taking a zero day at home.  But a zero day doesn't mean I did nothing! After going out to get bagels for breakfast, Sherpa and I did the Sunday crossword together, I unpacked, washed, restocked and repacked, had a visit from some friends, played board games with Sherpa, went to REI and got a new pair of trail shoes, then has my son and his boyfriend over for a BBQ.  Lots to do on your day off!
Today marks three months on the trail. Here's my three month report card, and it's graded on a curve.
Physical: A- I'm feeling strong, nothing really hurts besides a few blisters and these 62 year old knees. The only thing that's preventing this from being an A or A+ is I've lost too much weight.  I have been able to put on about 8 pounds (if I believe the scales on the hostels) but I still think I need another 10. As a bonus, my blood pressure has been down so I've been slowly reducing my blood pressure medication and now I've stopped completely.
Mental: B+ I think I'm finally at the point where sometimes this hike feels like a job. I'll wake up and say ""do I really have to hike today?"" and I just want to roll over and go back to sleep. But besides one or 2 bad days, I really have no thoughts about quitting and by and large I'm enjoying the heck out of this hike.
Spiritual: B Hawkeye asked us over dinner a few days back ""so what has everyone learned about themselves this hike?"" and I couldn't come up with a good answer. But at 62, I didn't come out here to learn something new about myself. I came to experience the world in a more raw state and to experience myself as part, and not apart, from nature. In that respect, I'll give myself a B. Final exam in 3 months.","Home

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.
I went out and got bagels for breakfast and a sandwich to pack out for lunch.  I had breakfast with Sherpa and started the 2.5 hour drive back to the trailhead where Dave and I were picked up 2 days before.  At the trailhead I said a sad goodbye to Sherpa, and befitting my mood, it started to rain.
A one mile climb up to the AT, and by 11:00 I was hiking north again. This was mostly a ""put your head down and watch your feet"" kind of day. Lots of rocks, lots of mud. I only saw 2 or 3 people all day. 
This is the kind of day that makes you wonder why you're out here hiking and about all the things you're missing at home: time with loved ones, summer vacations, picnics and barbeques, concerts, nights out with friends.  I suspect any time going back on the trail after being home will engender these feelings.
It rained till about 2, then slowed down for a while.  Frostbite texted me and said the shelter I was heading to was filled so I should grab a campsite while the rain had stopped, which is why I did.  I'd just set up my hammock and it started raining again. I huddled under my tarp and started to fix dinner (ramen with dehydrated ground beef, red and green peppers, cherry tomatoes, added olive oil for some healthy fat) and it started to pour.  
Hoping for a better day tomorrow, both weather wise and mood wise.","Victoria Trail

I woke up early and thankfully everything was dried out.  I was on the trail by 6:30 and got to Frostbite's and Smoke's campsite by 7:20.  They were camping with Victory, Meadow, Drive Thru and Frosty.  We caught up on happenings while I waited for them to have breakfast and packed up.
As we come to a road crossing, there's a cooler full of ice cold drinks and a note on top that says ""trail magic 1/2 mile. Take a drink if you need it now and I'll take the empty. Jinx"". What could I do? I took a Dr. Pepper!  Sure enough, at the next road crossing was Jinx, a section hiker, handing out...wait for it...root beer floats! She also had all sorts of snacks, home baked treats, and a box labeled ""Jinx's Bin of Requirement"" (for you Harry Potter fans) that had every supply item a thru hiker might need. Jinx does this once a week from the beginning of May through the end of July.  Thanks Jinx! 
A few hours on we came across Slick, also doing trail magic at a road crossing.  Slick had sodas, snack cakes, Gatorade, bananas, and chairs, so we sat a while and had a second helping of magic!
Our last stop for the day was 501 Shelter, an enclosed shelter right near PA 501 with bunk beds, a huge skylight in the middle, a porta potty, and water and electricity at the nearby caretakers house.
When I walked in and was introduced to a young lady named Sunshine, she says""Wait, I'm getting a message from the spirits. Your name is Paul""""Yes""""You live in New Jersey?""""Yes""""Did you recently purchase a senior citizens park card?""""Yes!!!""""Wait a minute, I'm hearing...you have $13 in your wallet, which is more like a plastic bag..""""I think I have more than $13...let me check""**Checks for wallet, can't find it. Can't find my wallet**""Damn, you found my wallet!!!""Sunshine and everyone else breaks out laughing...seems she found my wallet 2 days ago on the trail and had been looking for me. Smoke, who arrived a few minutes before I did tipped her off.  I could not thank Sunshine enough, and she was so happy to find its rightful owner.
Smoke ordered 3 supreme pizzas to be delivered to the road by the shelter for him, me, Frostbite, Victory and Meadow.  I happily shared my portion with Sunshine since it was way too much for me to eat. Also staying at the shelter tonight are Drive Through, Frosty, and a nice couple from Austria.","Tentsite mile 1177.9

I had swapped out the air mattress I had for a foam pad in an attempt to save some more weight, and it was way too thin for sleeping on a plywood bunk.  I didn't sleep much last night.
I had some of the leftover pizza for breakfast along with my Poptarts.  I can't believe some of the things I've grown accustomed to eating out here. 
It started to rain almost as soon as we started hiking, and it didn't let up until 2:00.  I thought it was clearing up when a thunderstorm popped up, then it got pretty cold.  This was another ""heads down"" kind of day.  With my head down, I totally missed when we passed the 1200 mile mark!
We got to Eagles Nest Shelter around 3 cold, wet, and tired.  Devil Dog was in the shelter and Dabba-doo wandered in before a Scout troop (working on their 5 Merritt Badge), Frosty, Drive Thru, and Rodeo (fresh from the airport after flying in from Dallas).  
I was cold and in my hammock by 4:45.  I fell asleep pretty quickly and woke up around 8:00 to get news about the birth of my third granddaughter! Welcome to the world, Juliette!","501 Shelter

I woke up early after falling asleep early last night.  I lay in my hammock, just thinking and pulling up old memories: about when my kids were small, about the neighborhood I grew up in, the kids I was friends with, the things we used to do.  It's funny how one thought triggers another and another..things I couldn't ordinarily remember but that are unearthed when they are wedged out by another memory.
We were on the trail by 7:50. Early morning is my favorite time to hike: the air is cool, the sun slanting through the trees, and all the birds are at full crescendo. 
The trail today was a mix of flat dirt, dirt with lots of pointy rocks,  and straight up rock hopping.  It seems like the fabled Pennsylvania rocks are finally making a showing.  
Frostbite had reserved a shuttle at 11:30, so we hustled down the hill and into Port Clinton. Port Clinton is a tiny little town with a preserved train line for tourists, a few houses, a fire house, post office, hotel, and not much else.  The shuttle took us to Hamburg where there's a Walmart, Cabela's and lots of other stores in a large shopping area.
We resupplied at Walmart. I only needed a few things to make it through to Saturday.  Several times while we were sitting inside Walmart charging our phones,  people would stop and ask if we were thru hiking and we would have a nice chat. The Optometrist even came out and gave each of us a dozen eyeglass cleaning packets and an eyeglass repair kit.  Everyone was so nice!
We had lunch at a Logan's Steakhouse.  Pro tip: don't get the fish and chips at a chain steakhouse in the middle of Pennsylvania. No good can come if it.
The climb back out of Port Clinton was steep and rocky.  We had 9 rocky miles to get to our shelter.  We were the only ones there for a while until Animal and another thru hiker came in late.  2 day hikers wandered over and asked us a lot of questions about the shelter and about thru hiking.","Eagles Nest Shelter

The Pileated Woodpeckers had me up at 5:00 this morning.  Because we did a resupply yesterday, I had a little extra food and today was a 4 Poptarts day for breakfast.  
The first part of the day was pretty easy hiking.  We climbed to Pulpit Rock for some nice views, then on to The Pinnacle for more views. We then had a long woods road walk to Eckesville Shelter, which is a shed behind the caretakers house with 4 bunks and a table inside.  We got there just as it started to rain, and found Mousetrap, Happy Knees and Sunshine already there and staying for the night.  We had lunch and recharged our electronics at the caretakers porch while we waited for the rain to pass.  Which it did, about an hour and a half later.  
There was a steep climb out of the gap and we took a rest at Dave's Pulpit (lots of pulpits today). That's when the fun really began. The last 6 miles of today's hike was rocks, rocks, and more rocks. Pointy rocks, slippery rock, big ones, small ones, loose ones to roll your ankle, sharp ones to bang your shins. Rock hopping slowed us down from our usual 2.3 miles per hour to under 1 at the worst parts. It was a miserable half day of hiking and we arrived at the shelter totally beat.  We're supposed to do 20 miles tomorrow, but if the rocks don't let up, I'm not sure how we're going to make it.","Windsor Furnace Shelter

We were up and on the trail by 6:50 because we'd been seeing signs for the last 2 days about Trail Magic at Bake Oven Knob parking lot from 11:00 till 1:00, and we wanted to make sure we would be there at 11:00! The first few miles were nice easy forest roads, comparatively rockless.  We leapfrogged with Poppins and her dog Wiley (or Wile E., as in Coyote) who had tented at the shelter last night.  
We got water at the back of the Thunderhead Inn at a spigot they let hikers use, and took a break at the picnic tables out back with a family of 5 doing a flip flop.  They hope to be finished by Thanksgiving, and I guess their kids don't need to attend school(?)
Pushing on, I passed Kanga and Fire who were just packing up camp.  Kanga had just almost been crushed by a falling tree while he was squatting to poop! They were both laughing and shaken by the ordeal.  I mean, the jokes just write themselves folks, but, what a way to go!
Soon the rocks started up again and we came to the famous Knife's Edge, a 50 yard stretch of trail that rides the top of a ridge of stone slabs at intense angles that has you balancing or crawling on all fours. Check out the photos page for more pictures of the Knife's Edge.
We got to the Bake Oven Knob parking lot around 10:55 and to our disappointment there was no sign of trail magic.  We dejectedly decided to rest there anyway and eat another protein bar when a car came up, parked and started unloading.  The two guys (Froth and I'm sorry I forget the other name) who had thru hiked in 2012 started unloading their trunk and apologizing for being late, but the grill they had borrowed was missing the regulator so they had to go buy a charcoal grill and charcoal.  We enjoyed sodas, beer, cherries, nectarines, watermelon, chips, and snack cakes while they assembled the grill, started the coals, and cooked us hamburgers and hotdogs.  Joining the party was the family of 5, Kanga (who animatedly repeated his near death pooping story  to everyone's delight, complete with a reenactment of him running with his pants around his ankles and diving out of the way as the tree crashes to the ground), Fire, and a few others.
Totally stuffed, we climbed the pure rock path up to and down Bake Oven Knob, which had nice views from the top and lots of muggles out for the day (no offense to the muggles).
The afternoon was much smoother with fast walking on forest roads and smooth trails, which put us way ahead of schedule to meet our rides for our planned zero tomorrow.  We crossed an open ridge line that provided views of the Lehigh River and it flowed toward the Lehigh Gap, and we walked across the top of the Rt 476 tunnel. The blueberries on the open ridge are just starting to get ripe.
We hung out for a half hour at the George W. Outerbridge Shelter and talked to a few weekenders until Cookie, Fire and Kanga came by (telling his poop story again) and we made our way down to the parking lot to await our rides.
My family friend Peg came to take me and Smoke to my house where we're taking a Father's Day zero, and we left Frostbite waiting for his wife.  Frostbite is taking a double zero, and we're going to catch up later in the week.  Thanks, Peg, for driving 3 hours round trip to deliver some awesome trail magic.

For breakfast, I ran out and got 2 Taylor Ham, egg, and cheese bagel sandwiches so I could introduce Smoke from Roanoke to the Jersey State Sandwich.  Not that he didn't like it, but I'm not sure it made a particularly strong impression on him.  I'll put it up against biscuits and gravy any day.
My good and generous friend Jeff picked us up from my house at 7:00 and drove us back to the trailhead parking lot at Lehigh Gap where Peg had picked us up on Saturday.  The climb out of the gap is purported to be the toughest in Pennsylvania, and you won't get an argument from me.  A very steep 1 mile climb over boulder fields, often requiring you to climb on all fours, took over an hour.  It was a lot of fun, but tough work.  
Up top we met Sunshine again taking a rest, and we walked and talked with her for a while. Sunshine's attitude and outlook matches her name. She is a very interesting person and really is a joy to be around.  She works seasonal jobs, basically to get enough money to hike.  This is her third time on the AT.  This time she started in Florida on the Pinoti trail (which links up with the AT) in December and has been hiking ever since. 
The trail this morning alternated between soft dirt through white birches, pine needles, rock hopping, and super fund cleanup sites.  Blue mountain was the site of zinc mining and smelting for over 100 years, and so some of it is actually a super fund site.
Some of the rock fields had beautiful rock work done by the Keystone Hiking Club. Obviously hundreds of hours of work went into moving large boulders so they lay flat, making almost a paved treadway or stone steps, and breaking up larger rocks (with sledgehammers?) To make gravel to fill in the gaps.
Still, walking on rocky paths is very tiring because you can never take a full stride, you have to carefully place your every step wherever they can find a clear spot, and you can't look up or look around. The moment you do, a rock jumps out and smashes your big toe.  Ask my big toes how many times they were smashed today.
We got to the shelter around 5:40, exhausted and out of water. Because of the lack of rain this spring, many of the normal water sources have been dry.  We found a nice spring with a great flow, but it was a half mile down the mountain, which of course means a half mile back up.  I'm really getting used to this beautiful mountain spring water.  When I drink town water now I can really taste a difference.","PA Rt 873

I was awakened by a whippoorwill at about 4 in the morning.  I hadn't heard a whippoorwill since way down south, maybe in Tennessee.  Smoke and I chatted with All-star for a while, who had come in late last night to the shelter.
We walked the 4 or so miles down to Wind Gap where Rt 33 and a local road pass through.  We saw Fire walking back from the town of Wind Gap, PA. He had stayed at a local motel.  We had extra time today so we decided to hike the extra mile down to a gas station for second breakfast. I got 2 breakfast sandwiches (two for $6.00. who could resist?) And a cup of coffee, and we hung out in front like a couple of vagrants.  Actually, we were a couple of vagrants.   
Back on trail, we hit the rocks again.  We passed Poppins and Wiley and climbed over Wolff Rocks, a granite ridge through the middle of the woods that afforded few views but lots of climbing challenges.
We made our way down to PA Rt 191 and found Sunshine already there where Wardrobe and his partner were providing trail magic (double Boca Burger for me). Wardrobe was a ""2020 Orphan"" as he called it because he had started the trail in 2020 when the ATC had ""closed"" it due to COVID, and he finished up in 2021. Poppins and Wiley soon joined us.
My friend and former co-worker Adam picked us up at the parking lot around 4:30 and drove us for a light resupply at the Family Dollar and then to the Elks Club where they were having Taco Tuesday. Adam is a member of the Elks, Moose Lodge and VFW and does an amazing amount of charity work with those organizations and several others. It's really inspiring, and amazing how much you may not know about your co-workers until you get to know them on a personal level. My other former co-worker John and former boss Mike joined us for tacos and beer, and I had a great time catching up. I know several other co-workers wanted to join us but couldn't because of the last-minute nature of the get together, so to all you who couldn't make it, I feel you and I thank you.
Back on the trail, it was a quick half mile hike to Kirkridge Shelter.  Smoke and I decided to camp at a field a few tenths past the Shelter where we'd heard we might get a good sunrise.  Adam said the field is or was used for hang gliders.  We settled in for a good night's sleep.","Leroy A Smith Shelter

There were nice breezes all night where I set up my hammock, but no sunrise. The field pointed almost due south, which I would have known if I'd consulted my compass.  Oh well, it was still a nice place to camp.
Poppins and Wiley passed us while we were still breaking down camp, and we would leapfrog them most of the morning.  A few rocks turned into a mostly smooth forest road all the way to Mt. Mikisi at the Delaware Water Gap.  I'd hiked Mt Minisi and Mt. Tammany many times in the past, but it was a different sensation hitting them In the middle of a 2200 mile hike as opposed to a day hike. They're put in perspective as part of a continuous landscape instead of a feature you're going to visit.  
We hiked down into the town of Delaware Water Gap, PA and went to the local bakery and had egg sandwiches and coffee.  Sunshine showed up again (she's everywhere!) with a friend of hers who grew up in the town.
Back on the trail, we crossed the RT 80 bridge across the Delaware River. It was an emotional moment for me as I stepped over the line separating Pennsylvania and New Jersey, my home state. 
We walked past the visitors center, under the interstate, and up the trail to Sunfish Pond where again, I'd hiked many times.  Around Sunfish Pond and across a beautiful stretch of Kittatiny Ridge to Camp Road where we waited for my longtime friends Bob and Eileen.  
They drive us back to their house in PA where I'd spend many happy weekends in my younger years and feasted us with dips, cheeses, wine, grilled chicken and salads.
Catching Up with Bob and Eileen, I had a ""George Bailey Moment"". I'm imagining how George Bailey felt at the the end of It's a Wonderful Life when he sees all his friends and neighbors coming to his aid and realizing how many people actually care about him.  All the offers I've had a long the trail from friends, family, friends of family and family of friends have been amazing and overwhelming.  So to all of you who have offered a ride, a resupply, a meal or a bed, whether or not I've actually availed myself of your kind offers, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You've made me feel loved, and what could possibly be better than that?","Field, Mike 1290.7

I was up early, but the coffee pot was set for even earlier! I had 2 cups of coffee and three danishes before anyone else got up! Eileen put out a great breakfast and loaded us with as many goodies as we were willing to carry.  After saying good bye to Bob, Eileen drove us back to Camp Road and we reluctantly took our leave. 
We were hiking by 8:30. After a quick climb we had a pretty easy walk continuing along the Kittatinny Ridge. We passed a newly painted red and white fire tower, then an Outward Bound group hiking up to the tower.  
We took our morning break above a beaver pond where there were at least 3 beaver lodges and many trees either downed or in the process of being downed by the busy little critters. I always thought they chewed down relatively small trees, but there were some 12""-18"" diameters trees they had felled. Very impressive! 
In the afternoon we came to the spot on the trail above Sand Pond where Scout camp No-Be-Bo-Sco is located. This is the spot where, as I believe I related in an earlier post, I first encountered 2 north bound thru hikers back in 1973-1974 as a young Boy Scout and the seed to hike the trail was planted. I've been looking forward to reaching this spot since the beginning of my hike, and I expected to find a rip in the space-time continuum that would allow me to see my 13 year old self standing there slack-jawed while I, taking the place if the north bound thru hikers, explained how 100 days ago I started walking from Georgia and here I was, in New Jersey. Instead all I found was an overgrown tract of woods that I didn't recognize.  I was so disappointed. But then again, yesterday was ""Hike Naked Day"" and I didn't see any naked hikers, so it's been a week of disappointment.
In the afternoon we hiked with Heimlich, whom I had not seen since the Shenandoahs. It was threatening to rain all day, but we never got more than a misting.  When we reached the shelter we were the only ones there.  Eventually, Poppins and Wiley and one other camper joined us. The last couple of days it seems to me we've seen very few thru hikers. I wonder if we're temporarily in between bubbles or if everyone has thinned out and this is the way it's going to be for the rest of the trip.","Camp Road

I must have been tired yesterday because I fell asleep early while trying to write this journal, and slept for most of the night.  
We had a quick 4-mile hike to the Culver Gap parking lot off RT 206 where Smoke and I were to meet my friends Matt and Nicole who were going to do a few miles with us.  After a brief mix-up on the meeting location, we were off. It was nice having some old friends to share the trail with, and the 5+ miles passed too quickly.  We had lunch at the Sunrise Pavilion and they surprised us with a couple of trail beers!
After Matt and Nicole left, it started to rain and it rained on and off for the rest of the day. We got to Mashipacong Shelter where I'd done a shakedown hike last fall, and we took a break to get out of the rain. We sat and chatted with section hiker Chairman whom we'd met at the Culver Gap parking lot. He had hired a shuttle from there to a point further north and was hiking southbound back to his car.  Shaggy also stopped in for a break.  
From the shelter we had 5.5 fairly unremarkable miles to the High Point State Park HQ building where Sherpa and Dink were meeting us for another zero at home. It started raining again, and we huddled in the entryway of the closed office until they arrived. We drove the hour back home where Sherpa fixed us a fantastic meal while Smoke and I cleaned up and did laundry. A great ending to a wet day!","Brink Road Shelter

Sherpa and Dink slackpacked us today so we were able to make some good miles.  They dropped us of at the place they picked us up on Friday and we hiked off into the fog. 
Shortly, we passed Poppins and Wiley and chatted for a bit. As lunchtime approached, we hit Lott Road and made a left across the state border and into Unionville NY.  We went to the General Store and sat on the porch where we saw Batman. Since we had packed out meatloaf sandwiches Smoke and I only bought a beer to split.  All I needed was a blue tick coon dog and a whittlin' stick and I'd a fit right in!
After lunch we went to Main Street Scoops for some awesome ice cream: a double scoop of cookies and cream and banana pudding!
Back on the trail, we traveled for a time along an old roadway or an old rail bed which paralleled the NJ/NY border for a time. We passed by many old stone walls and foundations along the way. Some places looked like there might have been a settlement there at one time.
The path took us around a wetlands preserve, then up Pochuck Mountain. We stopped in at Pochuck Shelter and talked to a family of 4 who were already bedded down for the night.  We descended Pochuck Mountain to RT 517 right at the beginning of Pochuck Boardwalk.  Sherpa and Dink picked us up there and brought us home for another dinner, shower and bed.","Huge Point State Park HQ

After being dropped off by Dink, we started out on the Pochuck Boardwalk, a popular part of the trail. It's a mile long elevated section through a swamp. Frankly, I think it's maybe overrated as we've hiked many similar sections of boardwalk and wooden suspension bridges.
After crossing the swamp, the trail goes up the ""Stairway to Heaven"", a steep rocky climb. This was not overrated.  Probably the most difficult climb in NJ so far.  
The rain was threatening all day and thunder was constantly in the distance. The rocks were still wet from earlier rain which made the undulating ridge precarious at times.  We passed Bill, a section hiker, looking down and dejected. He said he was ready to quit, mentally he had already given up. But, he was committed to staying out until July 8. After giving words of encouragement, we moved on. 
We passed Yoga, whom we'd not seen since Standing Bear in Virginia. We passed Radish, Icemen, Batman and Pirate. We met House and hiked and chatted with him for a while, then we met Spoon, House's hiking partner from the beginning of the trail who was there doing trail magic and picking up House for a night off the trail.
We met 3P and at the NJ/NY border we saw Possum. The last time we saw Possum was at the PA/NJ border. 
The ridge along Greenwood Lake contains a series of Rick climbs and ridges. The wet rocks slowed us to a crawl, sometimes literally.  We all slipped a few times, making us even more cautious.  The conditions made this some of the most difficult hiking in a long time.
When we could we hurried along to our meeting point as it started to rain. My friends Dave and Liz picked us up at RT 17A and this conversation took place:Dave: (hands us 2 beautiful looking apples) ""do you know why I'm giving you these?""Me: ""uhhhh...nope!""Dave: ""They're Fuji apples.""Me: *still nothing*Dave: ""Because they're asian apples and I'm giving them to you for the Apple-Asian Trail!""Me: ***CRUNCH*** (very tasty pun Dave, thanks!)
Liz and Dave also had for us 2 bottles of water, a package of Oreos and a package of Cheeze-Its, most of which we finished on the way home. As we drove away, the rain turned into a torrential downpour.  Many of the people we passed on the ridge were headed into the town of Greenwood Lake. I hope they all made it on time because the weather was really nasty.
Dinner awaited: antipasto, pizza and strombolis for me, Smoke, Sherpa, Dink, Ivette, Jeff, Liz and Dave. Another happy homecoming!","Rt 517

It was supposed to rain again today so we took our time getting going while we assessed the situation. The morning looked better than the evening, so Sherpa drove us back to 17A and we got on the trail by 9.  I wasn't going to see Sherpa for 4 weeks and it was hard to say goodbye, both to Sherpa and to home.  It started to rain.  
We had some difficult climbs, made harder by the wet rocks.  Soon our nice clean clothes were soaked with sweat.  We passed through many more stone walls and foundations, remnants of old settlements.  We stopped and had leftover pizza that we'd packed out for lunch.  We passed by a former thru hiker doing trail magic, but couldn't stay for long because we were already running late for a pickup from a friend.  
Ray met us on Orange Turnpike around 3:00 and took us back to his house where we visited with Sue and Betty, and Betty's granddaughter Rose.  We had beer, pizza, doughnuts and soda.  Rose let us choose snacks from a little store she set up for us.  She was so cute! After a welcome rest and a great visit, Ray dropped us back on the trail and we hiked on!
We hiked over the New York State Thruway, a road I traveled many times on my way to work.  Passing under the Appalachian Trail overpass, I dreamed of one day hiking the trail end to end, and this was my day!
We hiked into Harriman State Park and to a stealth camp above Island Pond.  It was a gorgeous spot, but we couldn't admire it for too long because it started to rain.
Calling Sherpa from my tent, she was concerned because the weather radar showed a red thunder storm right over where we were.  Don't worry, I said, it's only raining and I'm high and dry.  Well. No sooner did I hang up from her when the rain picked up, and the wind picked up. One of my tent stakes let go and I jumped out of my sleeping bag and stuck it back in the ground.  Then the wind really hit. All the tent stakes in the left side of my tent popped and went flying. The tarp was whipping above me like a flag in a hurricane. I was laying there in my hammock with nothing above me but a bug net and the rain pouring in.  I jumped out and tried to corral the tarp but the wind was too much. It had to be blowing 60.  So I grabbed my now soaking wet sleeping bag and liner and ran the 30 yards to Smoke's tent in nothing but my underwear and a t-shirt  
""Smoke, let me in!"".  He let me in and I lay on the floor of his tent, trying to catch my breath. Then I got in my wet bag and lay down for a half hour till the rain started to let up.  I went back to my hammock and miraculously found all my tent stakes. I untangled the lines and reset the tarp, emptied the 6 inches of water that had accumulated in my hammock, then went back to Smoke's tent and retrieved my bag.  I crawled back into my wet bag in my wet hammock and tried to sleep.
Thankfully, the artificial fill of my bag will still keep you warm, as opposed to down, which is useless when wet. As soon as the adrenalin receded, I was able to drift off and sleep.  What a night!","Rt 17A

I packed up my wet gear in my wet pack and had a joyless cold breakfast.  Back on the trail, we hiked through the Lemon Squeezer and past the junction with the Long Trail, areas I'd hiked many times in my youth.  We hiked through an old mining area with flooded mine shafts and through swarms of mosquitos.  
Shortly before Fingerboard Shelter, we stopped and spread our gear on the rocks, hoping for a little sun to dry them out. The sun was not cooperating
We took the short road walk to Tiorati Circle to use the bathrooms and fill up our water.  Approaching William Brien shelter, we came upon a young lady just sitting in a rock, in the middle of nowhere handing out Oreo cookies dipped in Nutella to passing hikers.  Was she a mirage? Smoke assured me she was not.
We stopped at the shelter for lunch, then pressed on, up Blackrock Mountain for some nice views of the Hudson River and West Haverstraw from the ridge. We climbed down and crossed the Palisades Interstate Parkway, ignoring the recent re-route that would have avoided the road crossing and added a mile to our trip.
Up the next ridge we went, bypassing the West Mountain Shelter for a stealth camp a mile or so down the trail.
Climbing into my still-wet sleeping bag, my spirits and my motivation were at an all time low.  It's probably the closest I've felt to quitting since I've started.","Stealth camp, Island Pond

New day, new opportunities.  House and Lava passed us by as we were packing up.  We finished walking the West Mountain ridge and went down to cross Seven Lakes Drive.  We started up the backside of Bear Mountain.  
The New York/New Jersey Trail Conference did amazing stone work with hundreds of stone steps, stone paving and crib walls up both sides of the mountain, and I marveled at the thousands of volunteer hours it must have taken.
When we got to the top of Bear Mountain, unfortunately the observation tower was closed.  But the porta potties and vending machines weren't! I made good use of both.
Down the front side we went, and around the lake where picnickers were starting their fires and kids were running and laughing.  A Muslim family motioned us over and offered us a delicious grilled beef kabob and pickled onions.  They were amazed when we told them we were walking 2200 miles from Maine to Georgia.  They asked Smoke if he was the scientist from Jurassic Park! Now that I think of it, he looks just like him!
Next we walked through the Bear Mountain Zoo where we saw our first bear for the trip! And our first bobcat, our first beaver....
After a break, we walked over the Bear Mountain Bridge, with awesome views of the Hudson river valley. When the Bear Mountain Bridge was completed in 1924, it was the world's longest suspension bridge in the world, the first one with a concrete deck, and the only river crossing between New York City and Albany.  
We hiked up into Hudson Highland State Park on the other side of the bridge. We stopped at the top for lunch with Lava, and House and 2 other thru hikers passed us by .
Another 4 miles brought us to a RT 9 crossing and the Appalachian Market, where we bought a second lunch and another sandwich to pack out for dinner.  
Just past the Market we made a right on Franciscan Way, which leads to a baseball field at the Franciscan Friary where they've let thru hikers stay since the 70s.  They provide tent space, a pavilion, picnic tables, a cold shower and power outlets! I had a bracing cold shower, washed my clothes, hung my hammock, had my sandwich for dinner along with a beer I'd packed out, then updated my journal (which you are now reading).
I got some bad news about a family health issue that I'm going to have to help Sherpa with.  She will be picking me up at the end of tomorrow and I'll be off the trail for a few days.  Hopefully I'll be back on the trail before long to finish this thing off!","Stealth Camp, mile 1403.1

The Friary ballfield was a great place to stay, and very generous of the monks to make it available for all these years.  We left around 7:50 and heard the carillon playing hymns through the woods as the clock struck 8:00.
Most of the day was hiking the ridge along the west side of the Taconic Parkway. Even though there were no big climbs today, the trail was constantly going up or down.  We accumulated 6500' of altitude change (3500' up and 3000' down) with no hills more than 200'.  The day was hazy (thanks to the Canadian wild fires), hot and humid with the constant presence of mosquitos.  
As I was walking past a rotten log, I must have stepped in the wrong place and I felt hot darts sticking in the back of my leg.  I was being attacked by a swarm of yellow jackets.  I'll bet I looked a sight, hopping and running across the rocks in my pack while swatting at my legs and butt.  I ended up with a bite on the back of my right calf and one right under my waist band up under my pack.  It could have been worse but man, do they hurt.
We passed Nate who was at the ballfield with us, nursing some painful feet.  Slim Pickens, also from the ballfield, caught up to us and we chatted for a while.  They call him Slim Pickens because he plays the guitar and carries one with him on the trail.  Nice fella.
Despite the adverse weather conditions, we made pretty good time. We came to a narrow, raised road bed identified on the map as ""mine road"" that ran through the woods for a mile. I'm thinking it must have been a narrow gauge rail road back to the mines back in the day.
After lunch we hiked around Lake Canopus and Smoke took a blue blaze (side trail) to the lakeside with a beach, camping, and concession stand.  It was sad to say goodbye to such a good hiking partner and all around good guy. But many strange things happen in life and it's a long trail. Maybe we'll meet again. 
I hiked the last 3 miles to the designated pickup spot. Dink and Sherpa arrived almost as soon as I did, and we started the 2 hour drive back to my house.  Hopefully I'll be back on the trail in 5 or 6 days after I help Sherpa deal with a few family things, so check back and I'll see you down the trail!

It was an emotional day today.  I was home for 3 days helping Sherpa prepare to move her father into our house for hospice. It was sad to leave Sherpa and my 2 granddaughters along with Dink and her granddaughter who are at our house for a few weeks. I felt very selfish for leaving her and going back on the trail. This is, after all, a very selfish trip on my part (and I'm speaking only for myself): leaving all responsibilities behind to someone else to go on a make believe adventure for 6 months. I was very tempted to just stay in my air conditioned house with my dry, comfortable bed and hang out with my granddaughters and help Sherpa. But I know if I don't finish this thing, I would regret it ""maybe now now, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of my life"" to quote Rick Blaine in Casablanca.  Knowing this, Sherpa was selflessly insistent that I go, too.
So Dink dropped me back where she'd picked me up on the 30th and off I went into the hot, humid, sticky, rainy day.
I met Little Fruity and Robin Hood on the trail.  We crossed under the Taconic Parkway and hiked along the ridge to the east.  We then crossed RT 84 and RT 52.  So the road noise was as thick and overpowering as the mosquitoes all morning. 
I did a side trip to eat lunch at the Mountain Top diner off RT 52.  They are very nice and hiker friendly there. They even gave me a free danish, which I packed our for tomorrow's breakfast along with a beer for tonight's dinner.
Right before I reached the shelter, I passed the 2/3 completion point! I rolled into Telephone Pineers Shelter around 6:00, exhausted. For my former work colleagues, the shelter was build by a local chapter (I believe White Plains?) of the Pioneers.  At the shelter was Little Fruity and Robin Hood with their Tramily, which includes Captain Nemo, Silence, and two other guys whose names I cannot remember.","Long Hill Road

For breakfast I ate the Danish they'd given me at the deli yesterday, and it gave me a good sugar rush to start the day.  It was a very mosquito-y and gnat-y day; the air was thick, warm, and still. 
As I came down the first incline and entered a swampy area, I heard a crashing through the underbrush to my left. I turned to see the back-end of a bear as it fled. I guess you could say all I saw was a bear behind.  My first bear on the trail!
Coming out of the swamp, the trail crosses the Metro North commuter line.  At the Appalachian Trail train station there, you can catch a train right into NYC.  
Turning left on RT 22, Native Landscaping is a business that lets hikers hang out on their front porch and recharge devices. They also have a water spigot and shower and a room you can hang out in.  Captain Nemo and Little Fruity were there figuring out food supplies.  My phone is having charging issues and only seems to recharge from my spare battery, so I didn't stay long. One of the managers came out and said ""I wouldn't want to be out hiking today. Gonna be a hot one"". Boy, was he prescient.
Crossing Rt 22, the trail goes through a long swampy area with slippery 2X8s laid down as a boardwalk and a very overgrown area.  On the other side of a hill was a cooler left as trail magic. I had a Sam's Cola and refilled my water.  Shortly after, I crossed out of New York and into Connecticut.  Nine states down, only five to go! The bugs seemed to moderate in the afternoon. I suppose like any reasonable animal in this heat, they were off taking a siesta.
In the afternoon I really started to struggle with the heat.  A moderate climb had me stopping every 20 yards for a rest. I hadn't struggled so much since the Three Ridges Wilderness, and that was a much tougher climb. I was afraid I was starting to get heat exhaustion.
As I started my last climb, 2 young bears walked out of the woods and onto the trail in front of me.  They were in no hurry, and despite my attempts to scare them away, they just looked back and me and took their sweet-ass time before turning back into the woods.  Three bears in one day!
On the last hill, the bugs came back with a vengeance and I had to don my head net for the first time.  I really want to know what those gnats wanted from me.  They just hang in front of your face all day and, besides occasionally embarking on a suicide mission to fly into your eye or up your nose, they just hang there, looking at you. What are they looking at?
I pulled into camp around 5:30, filtered water, cooked dinner and chatted with Dead Man Walking for a while, bemoaning the heat.  He had a prominent sub-dermal pacemaker in his chest, I assume his trail name has something to do with that.  By 8:00, I was in bed and sound asleep.","Telephone Pioneers Shelter

I got up this morning feeling rested. I'd slept well the night before.  But as soon as I started out I knew there was something wrong.  I was almost immediately tired, dizzy, weak muscles, and sweating profusely.  I never really recovered from the day before and I was very dehydrated.
I sat in a brook for 15 minutes to cool off and drank a lot of water, and that helped for a time. But half an hour later I was feeling terrible again.  I called my brother in law to come pick me up at Skiff Mountain Road.  He was originally going to pick me up further down the trail, but I couldn't make it.
I'm recovering at my sister's house now and I'm going to take tomorrow off.  My blood pressure was very low from dehydration and heat exhaustion. And from being stupid and trying to do too many miles.

We dropped my sister's car off in Falls Village where we plan on being Sunday afternoon, and my brother in law dropped me and my sister back at Skiff Mountain Road.  We started uphill and kept a nice easy pace for most of the day.  
The trail came down and went along the Housatonic River for a few mile and through some large fields.  We got water at a spring before the trail turned back up away from the river and along a ridge.  After 3 more moderate climbs, we were at our Campsite. I felt pretty good and I'm cautiously optimistic that I'll be able to continue hiking as long as I take it easy in the heat.
At the campsir.te were the Austrian couple and a father/son team doing a section hike.  My sister had a Mountain House freeze dried beef stroganoff dinner, which was too much for her non-thru hiker appetite, and I had a concoction I've been planning to try for a while but never got around to: about 2 cups of hot water, 1/2 package of instant mashed potatoes, 1/2 package of powdered gravy mix, and a 5 oz foil packet of Starkist Chickens breast.

At the top of the mountain I hear whooping and hollering. I come up to the top and find Honey Bee and (sorry, I forget his name). They thought I was a bear coming up the trail and tried to scare me off! Sorry, not a bear!
By 11:00 it started to rain, then it got heavy with lightning and thunder. Since I was already soaked in sweat, I didn't bother with a raincoat. At least the rain temporarily tamped down the bug assault, letting me take off my bug net. 
Coming in to Falls Village there was a sign that said ""700 Mike to Mt. Katahdin"".  Counting down instead of counting up? I like it!
I'd left my next food supply in my sister's car, planning to get it when we got to her car. Since she picked up her car earlier today, she stashed it for me at the AT kiosk in the parking lot at Falls Village.  Falls Village was having a car show today which was rained out, so I used the event tent to sort out my resupply used and the port-a-johns to do port-a-johns stuff.  I had a late lunch at the Falls Village Cafe. There was no room at the (Falls Village) Inn, no hostels and the local business that lets hikers camp behind their shop has no trees for hammocks, so despite the teeming rain and dismal forecast, I decided to hike on the the next shelter
(Narrator voice: this was his first and most serious mistake)
The trail out of town took me past a sign that read ""1500 Miles from Springer Mt"" (yay!), a very large waterfall (thus ""Falls Village"") and a hydroelectric facility. The mosquitoes came back with a vengeance despite the rain.  In 4 miles I came to the 1/2 mile side trail that lead down a steep cliff, past a long waterfall and to the shelter.  I slipped in the mud coming down a steep slope and got very muddy.
At the shelter I met Blue Bird Bard and a ridge runner named Mary. I decided to set out my hammock instead of stay in the shelter in order to avoid the mosquitoes.
(Narrators voice: this was his second mistake)
I ate a cold dinner, wiped off as much mud as I could with my wet bandanna, put on my change of dry clothes and hung my wet stuff over my hammock ridge line, but under my tarp, to see if  they would dry a little. (spoiler alert: they didn't)
The rain was absolutely teeming as I fell asleep.  I woke up a few times during the night and the rain never let up.  By about 3:00 am, the river that ran next to the campsite overflowed its bank and was starting to run under my hammock.  I moved my shoes (still soaking wet) to higher ground so they wouldn't be washed away and tried to go back to sleep.

So I was fine, of course.  Last night was the night of all the flooding in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and especially Vermont.  We got almost 7 inches over night.  My gear got wet from the splash back of the water coming off the tarp, but I stayed mostly dry. Although, huhwhen the stream at the campground stared overflowing and coming under my hammock I started to panic a little. So I texted a few numbers that the guide listed as having rooms available, and when I got a positive response on one, I started transporting my gear up to the shelter, made a quick breakfast and packed up.
The cascading stream that I hiked down the night before was now a raging torrent.  The trail was mostly flooded so I just waded through, sometimes up to my ankles My shoes and socks were already wet anyway.  I got to the house in Salisbury before noon and checked in. The accomodations left something to be desired, but I was able to lay out my gear in the backyard, and it was right across the street from the market where I bought my lunch and dinner. Salisbury is a quintessential New England small town 
I also met two nice people at the hostel: Ninja, a young lady from Germany and Cliff, a guy from Houston. 
Cliff grew up in Arkansas, went to law school at Rutgers, and recently retired at age 50.
This is Ninja's fifth consecutive summer doing a long distance hike, including the PCT and the CDT. She said she never even unpacks her pack when she goes home, she just leaves it and heads out the next year.  Her pack is a little larger than a school backpack and can't weigh more than 10 pounds, and 25-30 miles is a normal day for her.  When she goes home in a few days she's starting a job with Sea Watch, an NGO that rescues refugee rafts in the Mediterranean Sea.  She'll be the vegan chef on board one of their new ships, feeding the crew.

I had packed up the night before, so, anxious to get going, I was awake by 5, on the road by 6, and back at the trailhead by 6:20.
The trails were totally wet today, in many places the trails were streams, the streams were rivers, and the rivers were overflowing.  There was no hope of staying dry.
I leapfrogged with Cliff all morning, and we took a break together on top of Bear Mountain, the highest point in Connecticut. The climb down Bear Mountain was steep and treacherous, so we moved very slowly. 
We hiked down through Sage's Ravine which had gorgeous cascades and waterfalls, and with the recent rain, it was breathing. Maybe the most beautiful scenery we've had on this hike yet. We waded across the river, out of Connecticut, and into Massachusetts. 
We hiked up Race Mountain and had great views from the cliffs. I stopped for lunch on top and Cliff hiked on. I took off my shoes and socks to let everything dry out and enjoyed the sunshine and the breeze.  
After lunch there was a long ridge walk before descending to a buggy, swampy section and finally arriving at Rt 7. I arranged a shuttle from a trail angel into the Great Barrington Regional Community Center where they let thru hikers sleep in a field out back. I was supposed to meet Cliff there but he never showed up. I had dinner at a Mexican restaurant across the street. Then I set up my hammock on two pillars of a gazebos behind the rec center and passed out for the night.  
4 month report card:Physical: I have to drop this grade down to a B. My legs, knees, back, and stamina are still all doing very well. However, I've had trouble with dehydration and heat exhaustion recently and I've developed a pretty bed pack rash on my back from being constantly wet and warm. So not perfect but still better than expected.
Emotional: I have to drop this one to a B also. Lately there have been many days when I just wasn't feeling it and was looking forward to the hike being over. This is understandable what with the rain and the bugs and the heat making for some unpleasant hiking conditions. Some days are just not enjoyable. Still, this is to be expected and I'm getting some very good support from family and friends when I'm feeling down.
Spiritual: this one is still hard for me to grade. To do the subject justice would take more than a few lines in a hiking blog. I'll give myself a C+","Undermountain Road

I packed up quickly this morning and by 6:30 I was at the Great Barrington Regional Community Center. For $8 they let you use the locker room facilities, so I used the bathroom, recharged my phone, took a sauna, and had a nice long hot shower. The Center is a beautiful new facility and they run many programs out of it. I saw flyers for yoga classes, weight training, genealogy classes, art classes for kids, etc. I wish I lived near such a nice facility. 
I called Stonelegs for a $5 shuttle and by 8:00 I was back at the trailhead. Thankfully he reminded me to put on bug repellent because as soon as I stepped on the trail the mosquitoes were horrendous. At one point they were so unrelenting that they nearly drove me to tears. There was little breeze all morning and I had to don my head net and roll down my sleeves. I realize I'm entering mosquito country in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, and I promise I'm not going to complain about the mosquitoes every post, so let's just assume that the mosquitoes are always bad unless I say otherwise.
The other thing that carried over from yesterday besides the mosquitoes is the flooded trails. The first few miles were through a bog and due to the recent rain the trails were underwater, at one point up over my knees. 
I met Curious George when I stopped at a shelter for lunch and we commiserated about the trail conditions.  The trails in the afternoon were actually not too bad, but the mud and the rocks made for slow hiking and I did less than 2 miles an hour.
About an hour before camp, the sky started to get dark and I heard thunder in the distance. I got that ""oh no, not again"" feeling and I picked up my pace. I got my hammock set up before it started to rain too hard and most of my gear stayed dry. The rain didn't last for long. In camp are Curious. George, Fuel Rod, Cruise Control (a different one from the one I hike with down south) and two young ladies doing a northbound section hike.

I had expected it to rain last night but it didn't. I got up and had breakfast at the picnic table next to which I had pitched my hammock. I had a nice chat with Conductor, a retired municipal attorney who lives in Hanover, New Hampshire and is hiking home. He's an experienced outdoorsman having climbed most of the whites and a lot out west. He talked about a friend of his who eschewed what he called ""stamp collecting"", or performing an activity just to be able to say that you did it, like climbing all the 14ers in Colorado just for the glory of doing so.. Sometimes when this guy would climb with a bunch of people he would stop 100 ft short of the summit to make his point that the beauty is in the climbing, not in the accomplishment. Seems a bit eccentric.
I suppose there is an aspect ""stamp collecting"" in me finishing the AT. I wouldn't say that I've experienced everything I can experience out .ere, but there's nothing that I couldn't return to experience at another time. But I really want to complete this trail for the accomplishment of it, so I can get the stamp. Or the tattoo. So I can say I'm a thru hiker.
The hike today stared out going through a number of pastures and bogs. The mosquitoes weren't as bad as they were yesterday. Crossing Jerusalem Road I came upon a ""Trail Stand"", just a little shack with a supply of snacks, hiker food, toiletries, a small refrigerator containing drinks and ice cream an outlet to recharge electronics and even wifi. All on the honor system.  I bought a Dr Thunder (cut rate Dr Pepper) and downed it in a few gulps.
I took a break at Goose Pond Road and a day hiker stopped to chat and gave me a bag of chocolate covered almonds (""I brought this in case I ran into one of you guys"").
More mud, across Rt 84 (the Mass Pike), more mud, and up to Becket Road where my friend (who gave herself the trail angel name of Fetch-it) picked me up at 1:00. We went back to her house where I showered and did laundry, then she made me lunch before we ran out to resupply. In addition to the grocery store and CVS, we found a Verizon store because I had to get a new phone. My old phone was not charging reliably and when I could get it to charge, did not hold a charge for long. As I'm entering the more wilderness states again, I'm going to need a phone that I can rely on because it's my main tool for navigation.
We then went back to Fetch-it's house for an outstanding dinner of ribeye steak, roasted potatoes, and salad. 
I've diagnosed this itchy rash I have over my entire back as similar to diaper rash because my back has been wet and sweaty pretty much 24/7 for the last 10 days. So I'd bought Desitin at the CVS and Fetch-it helped me smear the baby butt-cream all over my back. Don't think she didn't make fun of me for that!
Fetch-it and I are old work friends and we had a hoot reminiscing about people we worked with and laughing about our exploits before I turned in for a good night's sleep.
Earworm redux: I'm bringing back the earworm today because I think it's funny the song and the particular line that was stuck in my head today:
""His foot hit the brakes to slow him downBut the pedal floored easy, without a sound;And he yelled Christ! CHRIIIIST!It was funny how he'd named the only man who could save him now!""

Fetch-it made me a fantastic breakfast of the best scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and tea. She's making it hard to get back on the trail! She drove me to the trailhead and we promised each other to get together soon.
I started up the trail and wouldn't you know it, it started to rain. It's like some Hollywood movie environmental mood seeing, everyone I leave a loved one or the comfort of home, it started to rain. As the trails got wetter and the mud got deeper,  I finally gave up trying to keep my feet dry and walked right through the middle of it.
I stopped at a shelter for lunch to dry out, call Sherpa, and check on the trail conditions in Vermont. I texted Northstar who's a few weeks ahead of me and she said they had to take a few road detours to get around some high water situations, but the trails in VT are muddy but passable. SOBO hiker BFG confirmed the same.
The afternoon hike was muddy with no views, but the trail was relatively flat. I got to the shelter around 5 and I was the only one there. Two SOBO hikers, Easy and Rodeo came in around 5:45. Very nice kids, and said the same thing about VT trails.
Easy and Rodeo had been hiking muddy trails all the way from Maine for a few weeks now, and one thing I learned from them is after a day of slogging through the mud, it's not enough to just dry your socks.  The socks get a layer of fine sediment in them that when dry acts like sandpaper and chaffes your feet.  You need to wash them in a stream at the end of the day, even if that means putting on wet socks the next morning.  After 123 days on the trail you can still learn something new, if you keep a beginners mind.","Becket Road

I wished Rodeo and Easy well on their journey South and hiked on three muddy miles into Dalton, Massachusetts. As I came off the hill I was held up by a freight train at a rail crossing. Moving on into town, I saw Peroni waiting for a shuttle. I had not seen him probably since Southern Virginia. 
I had a second breakfast at a little restaurant called Java and juice and while there made several phone calls to plan my upcoming days.
Dalton is a very nice mid-sized Berkshire suburban town, notable as the only source for paper for US currency. I walked a mile or two through their suburban streets and it reminded me of any town USA: American flags, people mowing the lawn, softball games in the park. It was a nice change from the trail.
The trail climbing out of Dalton was surprisingly dry and soft through pine forests. I had lunch at an overlook called the ""Cheshire Cobbles"" which overlooked Cheshire Massachusetts and Mount Greylock in the distance.
As I came down into Cheshire, there was a little roadside stand where I got an ice cream and a soda.  I filled up water at the Fr. Tom campsite across the street, a sweet little camping area provided by the town, complete with a shed with loaner bicycles for thru hikers.
I was headed to the Mark Noepel Shelter which is 3/4 of the way up Mt. Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts. The climb with nice and even and the weather was enjoyable.  When I got there I met Samwise, a ridge runner. He was an interesting guy who had thru hiked in 2018 and interesting things to say about his love for the woods, soccer, yoga, and bouldering.  He also told me about hiking the ""Triple Tierra"" of the Long Trail, the John Muir Trail, and the Colorado Trail.  Sounds like something I might be interested in!","Kay Wood Shelter

I woke up at 5:15 to the sound of rain. I hurried to get my gear over to the shelter so it wouldn't get wet before I packed it up. I had breakfast and consulted with Samwise about the rest of the day. I was dreading hiking in the rain, but Samwise's nonplussed attitude about the rain and enthusiasm for being in the woods inspired me.
If you have the proper attitude, hiking in the rain can be kind of enjoyable, as long as the temperature is not too cold, and I actually sang a few rounds of Singing in the Rain.  You realize that the fear and anticipation of getting wet is worse than the reality of it. Now, dear reader, what other areas of our life can we apply this simple concept to?
The 2 mile hike to the top of Mount Greylock went by quickly, and I found the Bascom Lodge that Samwise had told me about at the summit. I went in and took of my wet pack, then sat down for a cup of coffee and second breakfast. I'm beginning to like this second breakfast thing, I'm going to need to incorporate this into my real life.
Continuing my hike after second breakfast, I hiked past the war memorial at the summit of Mount Greylock which was obscured by the clouds.
After a long wet 6 mile downhill run, the trail runs right through the town of North Adams. On the street next to the high school is an Appalachian Trail kiosk and behind the kiosk were four coolers filled with all sorts of goodies for hikers: cold drinks, personal hygiene products, all sorts of supplies and snacks. I drank a Gatorade and took some Devil Dogs and Cheese-its with me. The people of North Adams really outdid themselves!
I was hoping to eat lunch at a restaurant that Samwise told me about,  but they were closed between 1:00 and 5:00. With no other dining options, I sadly sat on the side of the road and ate peanut butter and tortillas out of my pack, with a side of Devil Dogs and Cheese-its.
I crossed the road and started a long uphill climb next to a raging stream and series of waterfalls. It was supposed to start raining around 5:00, but held off. I passed the 1600 mile mark, and soon afterwards entered the state of Vermont. I could tell I entered Vermont because immediately the mud became deeper and thicker and the mosquitoes more numerous.
I made it to the old Seth Warner shelter site. The old shelter was torn down this year and they are building a new one three miles further on. I decided to camp at the old site even though the Green Mountain Club is trying to discourage it. There were already 2 tents there and Stitch and another lady joined us a half hour later.

It started raining around 9:00 last night and rained at least to through midnight.  The camp site was a pretty dreary place. Since the old shelter was torn down earlier this year, the site had not recovered or regenerated yet.  The trails this morning were wet, muddy, and pretty dreary.  About mid morning the trail came out to a power line cut where there was a nice refreshing breeze and somewhat of a view.
For lunch I stopped at a shelter where I met Captain BG. Captain BG had just started hiking again at Mount Greylock where he had stopped last year after injuring a tendon in his foot.
The hike down to route 9 was very steep, but the trails seem to be drying up. My friend Ed and his son Logan were meeting me to hike for the next 2 days, but they weren't going to be in Bennington until 3:00. I got to the trailhead at 2:20 and decided to try to hitch into town. After trying for about 45 minutes and walking a mile or two, I finally got a ride from an older couple and an older gentleman sitting in the back seat. By ""older"" I mean about my age.  They told me stories about how they always used to hitch back in the 70s and so were inclined to pick up hitchhikers when they saw them. So now I could check off ""hitch a ride"" on my Appalachian Trail Thru Hike bingo card.
Ed and Logan pulled into the parking lot at the Autumn Inn hotel soon after I got there. I took a shower, laid out my gear to dry and we went out to do a resupply. Ed treated me to an excellent dinner at a local brew pub in Bennington.
After dinner we got some ice cream at the local Stewart's and sat on the stoop of a local store like a bunch of hoodlums. Ed is my longest tenured and one of my best friends from grade school, but we haven't seen much of each other in the last couple of years as life has taken us in different directions. So we had a lot of catching up to do.

It's strange, when I sleep in a bed lately I don't seem to sleep all that well.  I laid awake from 2:00 - 4:00 last night and I was up again at 6:00.  I packed up my gear and had a light breakfast.  Ed, Logan and I stopped by a gas station after checking out of the hotel and I got a danish and some OJ.
The climb out the Rt 9 gap was steep, but the trails were starting to dry out. Logan is an outdoorsman and Ed had been training for this trip, so the miles flew by as Ed and I caught up with each other's lives and we talked about Logan's plans. As a matter of fact, sometimes I had to hustle just to keep up with them.  
We stopped at Goddard Shelter for lunch and decided to push on the 4.3 miles to the next shelter.  We arrived at Kid Gore Shelter just as it started to rain. There were really no good hammock sites so I decided to stay in the shelter, which I had not done in many weeks.  Dave was already at the shelter and Captain BG pulled in soon after we did.  Fuel Rod and Cruise Control came in and set up camp as they waited for CB Mike who missed the turn off for the shelter.  He eventually realized his mistake and had to backtrack several miles.
We made dinner, then Logan packed his pack and headed back into the rain around 6:00. Since they couldn't find a shuttle to help them drop their car at the far end of their hike, he was hiking back to their car at Rt 9, driving it around to the end, and was going to hike southbound to meet us in the morning.  Ed was a little worried, but he also knew Logan was a seasoned outdoorsman who often night hiked in adverse conditions. We all drifted off to sleep to the sound of rain on the shelter roof.","Rt 9, Bennington

It rained pretty much all night, and I slept surprisingly well for being in a shelter with only a 1/4 inch foam mat between me and the hard wood floor. I heard Ed stirring so I asked him ""have you heard from Logan?"", at which he pointed to a big green lump in a sleeping bag on the bunk next to him.  Logan had hiked the 14.4 miles in with us yesterday, doubled back, drove around to the far end, then 6 miles back southbound and got in around 4:30 AM. After hiking out with us, he will have done over 40 miles in a little over 24 hours, half of it in the rain and dark.  Amazing!
Because of the overnight rain, the trails had returned to mud. But that didn't dampen our spirits as we continued our trail conversations from yesterday, ranging from Logan's mountaineering exploits, to the the big bang origins of the universe, to family dynamics and the finer points of financing high tech startups.  Coming down the mountain I slipped and fell twice. I fell on and bent my trekking pole which will now not telescope any longer.
Around 10:30 we arrived back at their car and we said our sad farewells.  I headed out for the climb up Stratton Mountain, but first the trail dipped down through some bogs and I was ankle deep in mud again.  I stopped on a log for lunch and to tape up some hot spots on my feet before starting the climb.  A little bummed at losing my hiking partners, I put on some podcasts and before I knew it I was out of the bogs and approaching the sunny, breezy, pine covered top of Stratton Mountain.
According to the plaque on top of Stratton, this is the place that in 1909 James Taylor got the idea for a ""long trail"" thought the wilderness, from the Massachusetts border to Canada, which of course became the Long Trail. Then 12 years later on the same spot, Benton MacKaye got his inspiration for the Appalachian Trail. 
I climbed the fire tower at the summit. There were beautiful breezes and views once I cleared the treetops.  I climbed down and took off my shoes and socks to let them and my feet dry out in the sun and cool breeze.  I was in a good mood again.  
I chatted with Cruse Control before heading back down the mountain. The trail down was beautiful: mossy, piney and fern-y with clear cool springs sprouting from the moss.  
I made it to Stratton Pond Shelter, a very large multi-level shelter within an on-site care taker. I set up my hammock as Cruise Control and Fuel Rod pulled in. CB Mike had taken a short cut and was already set up and off swimming in Stratton Pond. I chatted with Cheese Fingers, a young lady hiking the Long Trail as I prepared dinner.  Then off to bed for me! It was a good day.
New and notable birds:from the top of the Stratton fire tower I looked down and saw 4 or 5 magnolia warblers. From this angle it was easy to see their distinctive yellow rumps as the fed in the tops of the pine trees.On my way down Stratton Mountain, I startled a half dozed ruffed grouse, and they in turn startled me, as they took off in a flurry of feathers.","Kid Gore Shelter

A tramily of a half dozen or so young-uns came in to the shelter last night and they were all up and packing as I passed the shelter.  
I saw what I believe to be a moose today! I heard a crashing through the underbrush and I looked up, expecting to see a bear. I saw a dark brown shape running away from me, and I'm pretty sure I saw a large head with antlers. So I'm calling it a moose.
I stopped at Prospect Rock with beautiful views of the town of Manchester for a break and to make some phone calls. I chatted with Cheese Fingers who was killing time because she was early to meet her mom in town. I continued along the ridge. The trail was drying out nicely and it was because a very enjoyable hike.
My friend Ed asked me yesterday ""what do you think about all day on the trail?"".  Good question.  Here's a sample of my thoughts on the trail today
**Notice: these thoughts have been modified from their original content to make them suitable for (and intelligible by) a general audience**""So it's 10:30 and I have 4.3 miles to go, so at 2 miles and hour that would be like 12:35, I should tell them 12:45 for a buffer..ugh, mud pit...""thirty thousand pounds, of bananas""...stop singing that song, sing something else...""thirty thousand pounds""...ugh!..wow, that breeze feels nice, be sure to note that in the journal...is it supposed to rain today?

I had not seen them since they came down to see me in Franklin all those many weeks ago. Also in the parking lot was a guy giving out trail magic while waiting for his brother who was on the trail, but a few days behind.

I had a bagel, egg and cheese sandwich and coffee at my brother's house before my brother, sister, and I loaded in the car to return to the trailhead.  They accompanied me to Bromley shelter before turning back, and I continued up to Bromley peak.  The trail joined a ski run before reaching the summit, where I talked with a group of 8 or so parents and daughters doing a Vermont section hike southbound.
The trail down from the summit was a nice gradual pine needle covered trail.  I ate lunch atop Styles Peak. It clouded up but never rained.  I climbed Peru Peak then reached Griffiths lake, which had several tent platforms, a privy and a full time caretaker.  
This section of the AT has many more shelters and camp sites than any other section, perhaps because it is also the southern section of the Long Trail.  Today alone I will pass 6 shelters or official camp sites, some of them only 2 or 3 miles apart, and many employing full time caretakers.  The Green Mountain Club evidently employs dozens of young men and women during the summer for such positions.
I was tired and dragging in the afternoon despite the trail being relatively easy and the weather being favorable. Baker Peak had a challenging rock ridge leading to nice views from the top, kind of like the Knife's Edge back in Pennsylvania.
I reached the Big Branch River around 5:15 and found a hammock site.  The Farout guide recommended camping at the river instead of the nearby shelter.  I could see that many of the normal camp sites near the river had recently been underwater in the recent flooding.
I also saw that I had totally missed the 3/4 point of the AT when I was hiking 2 days ago.  Only about 550 miles to go!","VT Rt 11/30

I was up early and on the trail by 7:00.  I stopped by Big Branch Shelter to use the Privy and pressed on.  The first part of the trail was very rocky die to erosion, which made hiking difficult. 
I crossed RT 10 where there was a large parking lot and took the trail up to Little Rock Pond.  I found Captain BG sitting by the pond having a snack and stopped to talk for a while.  Little Rock is a beautiful little pond that has a full time caretaker and many tent sites.  Since the AT joined the Long Trail at the Vermont state line a few days ago, I've seen many Long Trail Staff and Caretakers, all young people employed by the Green Mountain Club, which I think is great.  
It was a beautiful sunny, breezy day, and as the trail turned up from the pond, the trail got soft and piney. I stopped by the White Rocks ""Gnome Garden"" for a snack and to send out some texts. The  Gnome Garden is an outcropping of white limestone where people (or Gnomes?) had piled up white rock cairns.
I saw a bunch of day hikers climbing up as I hiked down to VT 140 where I stopped for lunch. Then, as usual, another long climb up again and across a ridge before descending once more through Clarendon Gorge where I met my brother and sister in law. Clarendon Gorge is a deep rock gorge spanned by a wood and cable suspension bridge, and is a pretty cool place.
I went back to my brother's house and got cleaned up for one last evening at their house before going out to dinner at a local restaurant.","Big Branch River camp.

There was an immediate steep and rocky climb out of Clarendon Gorge, and a second one  up  the aptly named Beacon Hill, which had a light beacon on top.  After that was a relatively flat section through some pasture land, boggy spots, and across a few back roads. At one such road I met MD Driver sitting by his car with some trail magic and waiting for some hikers. For the last few years he's been driving these five women (presumably one being his wife) around on their annual section hikes. They are aged 62 through 82, and today they were tackling Killington Peak.
At some point I passed the 1700 mile mark. I also passed the 500 miles to Katahdin point. I can't believe I only have a few weeks to go!
Another few mile brought me to the Governor Clement Shelter, where I had lunch.  There I met 2 SOBO young ladies named Catnap and Sweet Tooth.  They gave me the names of several Trail Angels I can call when I get to Hanover NH.
I was seven miles into my day and had been climbing steadily for the last few miles, but here the trail really turned up as I started the final 4 miles to Killington Peak. The path was first a washed out mountain road, then a single track footpath, then a steep traverse over rocks, roots, and fallen trees. As I neared the top I saw the line of 5 women who were with MD Driver coming the other way. I don't know why,  but I find the sight of competent, older women in the back country very moving and inspiring. It might be very paternalistic of me, but maybe it's because I know that when they were growing up, backpacking and other difficult outdoor activities where not encouraged for young women, so they either had bucked that limitation or came to it in later life. Seeing that 82 year old lady handle the same terrain I was having so much difficulty with, with confidence and a smile was humbling.
After a long grueling climb I reached Little Killington Peak, then the Cooper Lodge Hut where I stopped for a break.  The hut was a mess, covered with graffiti and in disrepair, perhaps because it's within reach of the lifts at the top of Killington. As I sat, 2 young mountain bikers came down from the peak and started climbing on the roof of the shelter. The outhouse, too, was absolutely inundated with flies, and I wouldn't go in. I didn't take the 0.2 mile side trail to the peak, so I started down.
The trail was a nice gentle decline for several miles across the back of Rams Head mountain and eventually to the shelter. I set up my hammock, got water and made dinner.  I was the only one here until a late hiker came in around 8:30. I only did 16 miles today, but I was pretty exhausted. Tomorrow I'm trying to do 19, so off the bed for me!
Update on Frostbite and Smoke: Smoke is 2 days ahead of me and Frostbite is 3 or 4 behind.  Both are doing well and we keep in touch with each other on a group text.","VT RT 103

I had a chat with Goldie over breakfast.  Goldie had come into camp after I was already in bed last night. It was overcast and cool as I started out. 
I hiked out to VT Rt 4 then up to Maine Junction where the Long Trail and the AT split, the LT continuing north and the AT heading east for New Hampshire. I took a break on a rock in the middle of the trail to call Sherpa.
Coming down off the ridge, I hiked through Gifford Wood State Park camp grounds. It was a good looking camp grounds with full services.  I wish I had camped there.  Right across the street was Kent Pond where I met a lot of day hikers and paddlers.  Shortly past Kent Pond was Thundering Falls, a very large cascade with a board walk and viewing platform.  Here I met Professor Sprout, Fire, and Mayhem.  Crossing a swamp on a boardwalk, I started a long and steep climb which really took the wind out of my sails.  
I took lunch at some power lines, hoping to find a breeze and a view, but found neither.  Passing Stonybrook Shelter and arriving at Stony Brook, I found the largest grouping of thru hikers I'd seen in a long time: Prof Sprout, Fire, Mayhem, Goldie, Mary Poppins, and surprise guests Victory and Meadow! I don't think I'd seen them since the Jinx trail magic back in PA.  They had been off trail for a few days which allowed me to catch up to them.
I met Pixie coming SOBO.  She's a NOBO hiker but had tripped on a root a week ago and cracked some ribs and got a concussion, so after a week on a couch, she was slack packing to see if she was ready to get back on the trail. She still seemed a little confused and unsure if she was ready to continue.
I had planned on doing 19 miles to The Lookout, a private cabin that the owner lets hikers use that's supposed to have a great view.  But I decided to stealth camp after 17 because a) The Lookout didn't have any water or Privy b) this would even out my three day hike to Hanover into three more even days, and c) I was just plain tired. I found a small spot by the side of the trail and set up my hammock.
Bird update: I heard many black-throated blue warbles in the past few days, but they remain stubbornly up in the tree tops, out of reach of my feeble eyes.  Also, I downloaded the north east regional bird database for the Merlin App, and all the calls I thought were wood thrushes are actually hermit thrushes.  Their songs are similar, but I haven't been paying close attention.","Churchill Scott Shelter

The day dawned bright and clear and the forecast promised good weather today. Within a mile of leaving camp I saw another black bear walking parallel to the path. He didn't seem to notice me and just ambled on through the underbrush. I tried to get a video but it didn't come out very clearly.
The first few miles went by quickly and I stopped by Winturi Shelter shelter for a break and to use the privy. Shortly after the break I saw Goldie and Mary Poppins by a forest road. They were taking the forest road down to VT Rt 12 to a coffee shop, but my plan was to stay on the AT to route 12 and then take a half mile road walk to the coffee shop.
Let me tell you, it was worth the walk. Abracadabra Coffee Shop in Woodstock, VT roasts their own coffee, and also sells soft serve ice cream and pastries.  A nice young lady named Faye struck up a conversation about thru hiking as I pursued the menu and asked if she could buy me my coffee.  This simple kindness touched my heart and made my day.  Simply because of the name (and because there were so many choices), I got a Nilsson Schmilsson, which had toasted coconut and lime zest. I chose that because I'd been singing this Harry Nilsson song (see below) for the last few days.  Only after I drank it (it was fantastic!!) did the lightbulb go on and I remembered that Nilsson also sang the song ""You Put the Lime in the Coconut"".  I also had a raspberry doughnut (10 out of 10) and a Maple Creamie (softserve made with local syrup).  I sat enjoying this feast with OG (just plain OG, a guy I met a few times already but only now got his name), Goldie and Mary Poppins, and a few SOBOs.
Right before and right after. VT Rt 12, the unavoidable mud returned. Right before Pomfrey Road, I had to ford a foot deep stream which washed out most of the mud, and afterwards I took a break to let my feet dry out before the last 4 miles of the day which were a pretty steep climb. 
By the time I got to the shelter, the mosquitoes were horrendous. I made a quick dinner fighting off the swarm, then retreated into my hammock for refuge. Five mosquitoes found their way inside my bug net and I hunted each one down without mercy. I went to sleep looking up at my bug net with a dozen or so mosquitoes on the outside looking in, just inches away from my face.  
Here's the Nilsson song I'd been singing.  A good one when you're having a bad day and you're crying in your tea: 
Think About Your Troubles


Sit beside the breakfast table
Think about your troubles
Pour yourself a cup of tea
Then think about the bubbles
You can take your teardrops
And drop them in a teacup
Take them down to the riverside
And throw them over the side
To be swept up by a current
Then taken to the ocean
To be eaten by some fishes
Who were eaten by some fishes
Who were swallowed by a whale
Who grew so old
He decomposed, ooh
He died and left his body
To the bottom of the ocean
Now everybody knows
That when a body decomposes
The basic elements
Are given back to the ocean
And the sea does what it oughta
And soon there's salty water (not too good for drinking)
'Cause it tastes just like a teardrop (so they run it through a filter)
And it comes out from a faucet (and it pours into a teapot)
Which is just about to bubble
Now

I was the first one up at 5:30, but still the last one out of camp at 7:00. I guess I'm just not that efficient in the morning.
Once on the trail I soon passed OG, who stayed at the same shelter but got in at 9:00 last night, well after I was in bed. 
The trails today were gradual, muddy, and overgrown, passing through several mountain meadows. Overall the trails in Vermont have been very nice, but not very well maintained. The trails down south seemed to have to take you over every peak available, just to bring you down the other side. The trails in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey had to take you over every rock outcropping it passed, even if there was an easier way around.  In Vermont, the trails are content just to get you from one place to another, which can make the hiking a little boring, but at this point I'm OK with a little boring.
It started raining around 8:00 and would rain on and off all day. I stopped for a few minutes to talk to SOBO Rabbit Foot, and he gave me a preview of the White Mountains to come. I hiked down into the little town of West Hartford, Vermont. I made a wrong turn and as I was doubling back to the trail I heard a voice call ""Hey do you want some coffee and a donut?"" Coffee and a donut? Heck yes! I went up on the porch to find Linda and her husband handing out coffee, carrot cake and many other goodies and there sat Goldie and Mary Poppins, already at their coffee. After about a half an hour later I continued on under route 89 and back up into the woods. I stopped for lunch at the cute little Happy Hill Shelter.
Around 1:30 the sky just opened up and poured for a half an hour. Coming out on a suburban street, I walked through the back streets of Norwich, Vermont, past some beautifully maintained (and no doubt very expensive) old New England style houses. I came across ""The Mechanic"" sitting by the side of the road next to his Mercedes  Spriter camper van and under a pop-up tent. The Mechanic claims (with all humility) to be the best masseuse (body mechanic) on the Appalachian Trail. He gave me a quick shoulder massage (8 out of 10) and a beer and I carried on to downtown Norwich. I made a left to the post office and picked up two food packages I had mailed to me (one from Sherpa and one from my brother), but now had way too much food. So I went back into the post office and mailed half of it ahead to Glencliff, New Hampshire, where I hope to be on Sunday. 
I made my way down to the well known Dan and Whit's General Store and there saw Victory and Meadow who were taking shelter from the rain and trying to decide how much more they were going to hike today. At Dan and Whit's I filled in a few things on my resupply list (like more ibuprofen!)
Turning around, I walked across the Connecticut River and into New Hampshire, up the hill into Hanover and Dartmouth college. On Main Street I got dinner at Molly's Bar and Restaurant and called Hanover Adventure Tours and Hostel, and Jane came to pick me up. At the hostel I washed my clothes, took a shower, sorted my food, and caught up on my journal. 
Also at the Hostel, I had a new pair of Saucony Peregrine 13 trail runners that I had shipped from REI. They're the same model I'm currently hiking in, but the lugs on the bottom are starting to tear and I wanted to make sure I had good traction for the Whites.  They're the 4th pair of hiking shoes I've used on this trip, and they should get me through to the end.

Today's hike is brought to you by the letter M. M is for muddy, and muggy, and mucky. M is also for mosquito-y. But M is also for magic, as in trail magic.
But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me go back. I woke up and made a batch of pancakes at the closed down hostel, then Jane drove me back to the CVS in Hanover where she had picked me up the night before. I walked through the town of Hanover and the campus of Dartmouth College where the movie Animal House was filmed. There is some very nice sidewalk art pertaining to the Appalachian Trail done by the local high school. As soon as I turned off the road and walked along the edge of the Dartmouth college athletic fields, the mud began along with the other nasty M words. I got a little bit lost on the way up the first climb because, evidently, white paint is in short supply in New Hampshire, or you would think so by the dearth of trail blazing in this section. I had to put on a second dose of mosquito repellent because the little buggers had found their way through the first dose.
I was getting very discouraged when I came upon a dirt road and found Bullseye and Tom with their grill set up and two tables full of hiker food. I sat and had a second breakfast of a burger, a beer, a Coke, an orange, and some chips. Bullseye had hiked the trail 2 years ago and has hiked all over the United States and Europe. I come to find out only later that he was one of the co-founding of the Jet Boil company, makers of the stove that I'm using on this trip. I wish I had known that when I was talking to him. Which is probably why he doesn't volunteer that information up front.
Anyway, the day improved after that, although I did get lost a second time but found my way back to the trail by doing a half mile road walk. The last climb of the day up Moose Mountain was the most difficult at 1200'. Moose Mountain is the site of the crash of Northeast Airlines flight 945 back in the 60s. As I was getting close to camp, I was passed by 3 other northbound hikers and saw Daisy setting up a stealth camp shortly before the Trapper John Shelter. I'm camping tonight with two of those northbound hikers. A group of 10 or so hikers just came in around 9:00 and are setting up tents down behind the shelter.","Hanover, New Hampshire

I was on the trail before 7:00 and by 7:30 I was down at Grafton turnpike, the location of the ice cream man house. Bill Ackersly was a trail angel for many years before his death a few years ago and used to give out ice cream to all passing hikers. Either his family or whoever owns the house now is carriying on the tradition and you can go up on their porch, recharge your electronics, take an ice pop from their chest frezer and refill your water from their spigot.
I met Daisy soon after and we leapfrogged and chatted for most of the day. The climb up Lambert Ridge was nice, not too many bugs and the mud was moderate. The subsequent climb up Smart Mountain was very difficult, very steep and about 2,000 ft. We were rewarded at the top, however, with a breeze and great views from the fire wardens tower. At the top were a group of a half dozen search and rescue volunteers out on an annual fitness exercise and with two students from Dartmouth College. The search and rescue team were discussing the missing hiker Steady Eddie and thinking they were going to be called in on the search since he was officially Dr declared a missing person. Steady Eddie went missing a few weeks ago leaving the Long Trail Inn and never showed up at his next stop and has not contacted his family.
I had a bit of a conundrum. Hexacuba shelter was only 6 miles from the top of Smart Mountain and that would give me only a 12 mile day. However, the next camping spot was 7 miles farther on and I was not feeling up to 19 miles. Plus it was supposed to rain this afternoon, and I was tired, and not looking forward to another big climb up Cube Mountain. So I decided to do a short day and stay at Hexacuba shelter. I'm now happy with that choice as the rain and wind got worse throughout the afternoon. I'm here now with Wrong Way, one of the hikers from the big group at Trapper John last night who got soaked in the storm. Later in the day several more hikers showed up, including 3-D, Goldie, Marry Poppins, Dream Catcher, and Squatch.
Hexacuba is a unique hexagonal shaped shelter with a 5 sided privy, the Penta-Privy. Both are appropriate for structures on Cube Mountain.
New and notable birds: - I got a positive visual ID on a hermit thrush today.- As I was walking down from Smart Mountain I heard a commotion in the trees behind me. I turned around and looked up and there were three or four golden crowned kinglets (the cutest little birds) in the branches above me just looking down on me, and a red-breasted nuthatch about three feet right above me.","Trapper John Shelter

I was up early, having only slept in half hour intervals last night, as expected for sleeping in a shelter.  Daisy never made it to the shelter last night, which had me a little concerned. I assume when the rain got heavy he found a stealth site on the way up.  The temperature in the shelter was 53 when I woke up, and it started me thinking about whether I'd need my cold weather gear again before I finished.
The crew that came in last night did bring some news, which I verified online today: missing hiker Steady Eddie was found dead a mile and a half downstream from where the AT crosses Stony Brook in Vermont.  That's the place I was 3 days ago when I said I saw the most thru hikers together in one place in a long time. He evidently tried to cross when the water was too high after the horrendous flooding they had earlier in July.  I feel so bad for his family. People may say he made an obvious bad choice, trying to cross alone in high water, but who among us has not made the occasional bad choice, and yet have not had to pay for it?
Anyway, I was hiking by 6:15, and the trip up Cube Mountain was something special.  It was steep, and dark and wet, climbing over slick quartz and quartzite ledges through dense pine forests. I'm sure glad I wasn't trying to do this in the rain yesterday (that would have been a bad choice). When I got to the top, there were none of the promised long distance views, but there were some dramatic cloudscapes as the wind whipped the clouds across the summit with occasional views of the valleys below. 
On the way down I saw many day hikers and trail runners, this being a weekend. It occurs to me that most of the under thirty crowd I've seen of late have been trail runners, complete with trail running shoes and water vests, while most of the oyber thirty crowd are more traditional day hikers 
I did slip and fall on the way down today. I've lost count, this must be eight or nine on the trip. I was distracted, thinking about what I was going to write in my journal no or some by other such nonsense when in my foot slipped on a wet, sloped rock. I fell flat on my pack, but my rolled up foam sleeping mattress acted like a spring board and catapulted me back in the air and I landed on the rock, flat on my face.  No broken bones or blood, but I did get a stern talking-to from my inner parent: ""Common Maz! Get your head in the game! You've got to do better than that!!!""
Making my way down to Rt 25, I found more trail magic! Thets twice in two days! Popeye, 2022 thru hiker, was there with his wife, his dog, a grill, a tent, and lots of food. I had a second breakfast of a hot dog, hamburger, soda and chips.  Also there were Rocket and Groundhog (have not seen them in months!)
In general, the day was cool, sunny, and breezy. Perfect hiking weather as far as I'm concerned. For a while I hiked behind Scallywag, who was hiking in one trail shoe and one Croc, because his other trail shoe had blown out the side and he was trying to to make it to an outfitter.  
I hiked down to Hikers Welcome Hostel on Rt 25 where Smoke was taking a zero and waiting for me so we could hike the Whites together.  Man, it was good to see him again. The hostel had been without water for a day due to a problem with the main, but I decided to stay anyway.  We went for a resupply and by the time we came back the water was back on so we were able to shower and do laundry.  Also here, or here and gone to find a place with water, are Goldie, Mary Poppins, Pirate, Aloha, Yahtzee, 3-D, Wrong Way, Rocket, Ground Hog, T Dubs, Scallywag, and a few others. Scallywag even found 2 pairs of shoes that other hikers had left, on a rack, in his size! So he had his choice of free replacement  shoes.  Talk about trail magic!","Hexacuba Shelter

I was up at 5:30, took a shower, made coffee and had a couple microwave breakfast sandwiches for breakfast. Smoke and I were on the shuttle by 7 along with T Dubs and a couple of ladies hiking North. The future dropped us off at Kinsmans Notch and we started slack packing south, back to the hostel.
We immediately started to climb up alongside Beaver Brook Falls, a spectacular 1200' or so cascade that comes down the east side of Moosilacke mountain. The trail up the falls was steep and slick. Many wooden steps and chiseled hand holds have been built next to the falls because it gets a lot of traffic, but I was still glad we weren't wearing our full packs. The going was  slow because we stopped so many times to  marvel at the falls and take photos.
We stopped for a break at Beaver Brook Shelter, about 2/3 of the way up. As we resumed our climb, we saw Goldie, Mary Poppins and Squatch coming NOBO, having just left the summit.  The tree line on Moosilacke is around 4700' and as we emerged onto the 4800' summit, the views and the cool, fresh breeze took our breath away.  We stayed for a while, enjoying the views with a small group of other hikers before starting down again., The trail cut a sharp path through the stunted evergreens just below the tree line. We took a quick detour on a 0.2 mile side trail to the south summit, where we saw a storm blowing in a few miles away. We donned our foul weather gear and hurried down the mountain. 
We passed about a half dozen other hikers with whom we shared the hostel last night, and we were glad we were headed down, and not up into the storm.  In the end, it only rained for 10-15 minutes, and it really wasn't that bad.  
We ended our short slack pack back at the hostel and Smoke caught the shuttle run to the store to pick us up some brats for dinner. There are about a dozen other hikers here in the hostel tonight, some we know (like Tenacious and Freebird), but most we don't.

After               dropping us at the trailhead, the shuttle was taking most of the contents of our packs to The Notch Hostel outside of Lincoln NH where we are staying tonight so we can slack pack the 16 or so miles to Franconia Notch
We started from the trailhead around 6:40 and immediately started a steep climb up Wolf Mountain. We met Daisy on the way up and hiked with him for most of the morning.  The ridge between Wolf Mountain and South Kinsman Mountain was very difficult: all boulder, bogs and rock scrambles. What makes it so hard is you can't get 3 or 4 regular strides in a row, you're always either hopping, climbing or sidestepping some obstacle. We couldn't have made more than one mile an hour over this section.
We had lunch at Eliza Brook Shelter and there met Cajun, a school teacher who lives in Branchville NJ and teaches in Montague.  After lunch, the trail followed along Eliza Brooks as it tumbled and cascaded down from the bogs under South Kinsman Mountain.  
The climb up South Kinsman was very steep and technical, sometimes requiring that we go on all fours and pull ourselves up by handholds. I was very glad to not be doing that with full packs.  We were rewarded for our climb when we emerged at the summit and had beautiful 360 degree views of the White Mountains.
The walk from South Kinsman to North Kinsman was easy and we passed many day hikers.  The approach to the Kinsmans from the north seems to be more popular with day hikers and weekenders.  
On our way down we stopped at Kinsman Pond Shelter, a nice new shelter right on the shores of Kinsman Pond.  The last 6 miles down to Franconia Notch seemed to take forever and was a bit tedious.  We stopped at Lonesome Lake Hut, one of several glamping huts run by the AMC. Smoke and I had a cup of coffee to pass some of the time because we were running early for our 7:20 pickup by the shuttle for The Notch Hostel.
We got to the pickup spot and they came a bit early for us.  The Notch Hostel is a beautiful and well run Hostel that has 15 or 20 people here tonight.  We ordered Chinese food delivery for dinner, did our chores, and tried to get to bed early to catch another 7AM shuttle back to the mountains. 
Today's walk was tough, over hard terrain with about 5300' in elevation gain and 5600' in descent.  But so far, the White Mountains have been gorgeous and if this is any indication of what's to come, we're in for a real treat.
New and notable birds: I'm very excited that I saw and heard several boreal chickadees today. That's a new lifer bird for me.  I'll have to go back and count, but I'll bet I saw at least a dozen new lifers on this hike so far.","Kinsman Notch

This really was a day to remember. I've been looking forward to hiking Franconia Ridge for a long time, and the day was finally here.
The hostel offered shuttles back to the access trail at 7:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Originally we were going to take the 7:00 shuttle because 11:00 was too late, but Smoke wasn't feeling too great in the morning, so we got Stonelegs (the same guy who shuttled me in Great Barrington MA) to shuttle us at 9:00. After a quick stop for some supplies and a 1 mile walk up the access trail to the AT, it was almost 10:00 a.m. before we started our climb. 
We completed the steep climb up to Liberty Springs Camp Site by 11:45 and to our first break. Another climb, a short ridge walk, and another steep 700' climb brought us to the top of the cliff on Little Haystack and a breath taking view back over the way we came. Another short walk and we were above the tree line on Little Haystack looking down the length of Franconia Ridge. And wow, the view looking forward was epic. 
Franconia Ridge is a very popular, 3.5 mile long exposed ridge walk that goes from Little Haystack Mountain, over Mount Lincoln, over Mount Lafayette and down towards Mount Garfield. The views are stunning on all sides and you can see for miles and every direction. The walk is exciting and unique, like nothing I've ever done before.
We had lunch on Little Haystack and watched military A-10 aircraft practice their low altitude flying by buzzing Mt Lafayette and flying low in the valleys below us.  Later, I saw a glider plane catching an updraft and skimming low over Lafayette. 
Soon we had to move on and we walked the ridge over Mount Lincoln and Lafayette.  Then the trail descended slowly towards a tree line in the valley between Lafayette and Mount Garfield. The descent was very difficult in the climb up Mount Garfield was steep and tiring, especially on already-tired legs. We descended Mount Garfield and eventually got to the Garfield Ridge campsite. The day's hike was only a little over 10 miles,  but we were exhausted, having climbed almost a mile and descended another mile. 
Here at the campsite were Nom Nom, Smokey, Shaggy, Cajun, CB Mike, Cruise Control, Fuel Rod, Stealth, Pigeon, and a bunch of college and High School aged hikers.
New and notable birds: I got a nice long close-up look at a spruce grouse. A very handsome bird and a new Lifer for me.  That's two lifers in as many days!","Franconia Notch

I slept like a baby last night, and woke a little late. After a quick breakfast and filtering some water, I was on the trail by 7:00.
The first task I faced was getting down from Garfield Ridge.  The trail was very steep and flowing with water, so it took some scrambling and sliding.  From there, the walk to Galehead Hut was pretty easy.
As I neared the Hut, one of the facilities run by the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), under a special permit from the USFS, I started passing dozens of hikers disgorging from their overnight stay.  The Huts can hold two, three dozen people at capacity. Lake of the Clouds can hold 90.
I got to Galehead to find Smoke, Nom Nom, Shaggy and Cajun already eating the free breakfast leftovers the Hut Croo had set out for thru hikers.  I had some cold oatmeal, cold pancakes, berry cobbler and a cup of coffee for a buck.  Just to energy I needed to make it up South Twin Mountain.  
The climb up South Twin was steep, but I blasted up.  At the top I found Cruise Control who was eventually joined by his brother Fuel Rod.  I took in the fine views back towards Franconia Ridge and Garfield, called Sherpa, then headed down and over to Guyot Mountain.  
As I neared Guyot, I encountered a large hiking party and a guy with an older dog. As we traversed a rock slide the guy picked up and carried his dog and one of the hikers joked to him ""I wish you would carry me like that"" to which the guy replied ""You haven't dedicated 13 years of your life to me"".  Got me right in the feels.
After Guyot we headed towards Zeeland.  I stopped on a rock outcropping for lunch, then hiked to Zeacliff for some nice views.  There I met a group of 8 or 10 teenagers on an in outing with 2 adult leaders.  
Again I caught up with Smoke, Shaggy, Nom Nom and Cajun at Zealand Hut. When Thru hikers pay a fee to stay at one of the AMC camp sites, they get a card that entitles them to a cup of soup, a pastry, and some bread at one of the huts.  I used my card for a brownie and a cup of bean soup and paid $6 for a fantastic pulled pork sandwich.  We all sat in the Hut (really, a very nice lodge) and looked at maps, trying to plan our way around a coming rain storm.
The final 5 or 6 miles to our target campsite was relatively flat and smooth, and we got there by 6.  I got a weather forecast from my Garmin device and we all made the decision that climbing the Webster Cliffs tomorrow in the rain was a bad idea. We decided to get down to Rt 302 in the morning and try to stay at the AMC Wilderness Lodge at Crawford Notch. This will necessitate 2 short days in a row to position ourselves to cross Mt Washington and the Presidential Range.  I know it's the right thing to do, but I hate losing a day when I feel like I'm hiking so strongly.
New and notable birds: I heard and saw a white winged crossbill on my way to Galehead Hut this morning.  He was just sitting on the top branch of a pine tree, singing his tiny little avian heart out.  That's three life birds for me in three days! To be sure, these are fairly common birds in this area, I've just never birded at this latitude and altitude.","Garfield Ridge campsite

Change of plans again.  We hiked down to Rt 302 and hitched a ride down to the AMC Wilderness Center. Cajun caught a ride while Smoke waited for me at the trailhead.  We caught a ride with a nice family from Iowa who stuffed us in the trunk of their minivan.
We intended to stay the night at the Wilderness Center but they had no vacancies.  So we availed ourselves of their $14 all you can eat breakfast. Let's just say we got our money's worth.
Unable to stay, we decided to take the Crawford Trail up to the Mizpah Hut and Nauman Campsite instead of going back up to the AT.  The Crawford Trail is billed as the oldest continuously used mountain trail in the US, having been built by Abel Crawford and his son Ethan Allen in 1819.
The Crawford Trail knocked about 3 miles off our day and also avoided the Webster Cliffs, Webster Mountain, and Jackson Mountain. I feel bad about ""blue blazing"" this section of the trail since I've been very strict about hiking the whole trail thus far. But I guess I consider this a prudent ""bad weather route"" to avoid the exposed terrain during the predicted (but never materialized) severe thunderstorms in the afternoon. 
We got to camp around 11:00 and set up camp, then went into the Mizpah Hut to avail ourselves of the free leftovers and picnic tables as Nom Nom, Shaggy, Smokey and the other hikers from Ethan Pond who did the actual trail arrived an hour to two later.  Peroni arrived later, I haven't seen him since Massachusetts.
We lounged around for the rest of the day, talking and playing games in the hut, napping, eating, and getting ready for tomorrow.  Smoke got a ""work for stay"" deal at the hut where he works for 2 hours and in return gets to eat leftover dinner and breakfast and sleep on the floor of the hut.  I missed out on the deal by 30 seconds, but I'm fine with my dehydrated dinner and sleeping in my cozy hammock. 
It seems like everyone we've been hiking around for the last few weeks is assembling here for an assault on Mt Washington tomorrow and Pirate, Scallywag, Aloha, Yahtzee, Rocket, Groundhog, Stealth, Pigeon, 3-D, and others arrived late.","Ethan Pond Campsite

Wow, what a day! We started early at 6:10 and immediately hit a 500' climb up Mt Pierce.  We were in the clouds, and it was mid morning before the clouds started to break up enough to get any views.  
The AT over the Presidential Range doesn't summit all the mountains, it clings to the shoulders of Eisenhower, Monroe, and later, Jefferson and Clay.  Cajun, however, is trying to bag all peaks over 4,000 feet in the US, so he took the loop trails over all the summits and still kept up with us.
We all met up at Lake of the Clouds Hut for leftover breakfast and coffee.  Next, we started the Long (but not too steep) climb up Mt Washington. Unfortunately, the top was still in the clouds, so we didn't get any views from there. Instead we went to the visitor's center and recharged our electronics and our bellies. I had a chocolate chip muffin, coffee, chocolate milk, and a cheese dog.  
We started the long descent down the rocky slope. Cajun and I took a wrong turn down the Jewel Trail at a poorly marked junction. This necessitated a 300' climb back up, and we met Nom Nom coming down, having made the same mistake. Later, we found out Shaggy and Smoke made the same mistake.
Next stop was Madison Hut where Smoke and I were hoping to get work for stay, but struck out. That meant a 3 mile, 3000' foot descent to Osgood Campsite that seemed like to longest 3 miles of the trail. But first we had a very steep and windy climb up Mt Madison.
Today's hike had awesome views almost all day. It was 14.8 miles and took us almost 13 hours.  14 of the miles must have on rock. By the end of the day my knees were shot and my dogs were barking. One of the toughest and most rewarding days on the trail so far.","Nauman Campsite

We only had 4.8 miles to go today but Smoke and I were looking to get into town for breakfast. we started out at 6:10 and by 9:00 we were at the Pinkham Notch visitor Center. We quickly hitched a ride from a nice young fella named Andre who dropped us off right at The Barn hostel in Gorham, New Hampshire. 
We checked in and went down the road to the Road Hawg BBQ joint for an enormous second breakfast. We met Cajun at the Big Day Brewery for a goodbye beer (he's getting off trail after a one month section hike). I took a nap before catching up on my journal and then going out to dinner with Nom Nom and her friend, Smoke, Shaggy, Smokey, Pigeon and Stealth to the all you can eat Asian buffet. They definitely lose money on long distance hikers.
My feet definitely needed the short day today. I have to wait for the post office to open at 8:30 to pick up my cold weather gear and some food Sherpa mailed to me, so we'll be getting a bit of a late start on the Wildcat Ridge tomorrow, which should be a tough day.","Osgood Campsite

I'd made a strategic mistake by having my resupply mailed to the post office in Gorham instead of the hostel. I had to wait for the post office to open at 8:30, thereby missing the free 7:30 shuttle from the hostel and requiring that I hire a $45 private shuttle. This also meant we didn't get on the trail until 9:30 this morning.
Right out of the chute we hit Wildcat Mountain and a 1000' climb in 1 mile that's been called the toughest mile on the AT. I'm not sure about that, but, but it sure was challenging. Another 1000' in the next 2 miles brought us to the top of Wildcat D and the top of the chairlift of the Wildcat Ski resort. This brought back a lot of memories of skiing there with a friend many years ago. Nom Nom and Shaggy were just leaving after eating lunch, but we pushed on because it had started raining.
Next was Wildcat Mountain and then a descent into Carter Notch where we took a break at the AMC hut around 3:00.  Smoke wasn't feeling it today, so even though we had only done less than 7 miles, we decided to see if we could get a work for stay.  
An extended family group of around 20 people were staying at the hut and 4 of their party either didn't show up nor had left early due to the rain. When Mike overheard Smoke talking to the Hut Croo about work for stay, he offered us their reservation for the night. Talk about trail magic! Full dinner breakfast, warm dry bunks, a $150 reservation for free! We quickly accepted and couldn't thank them enough. Snap and Detour took the other 2 spots. The only drawback is that leaves us with 15 miles for tomorrow in what's supposed to be torrential rain to get out to the road. But that's tomorrow's problem

P it rained and poured all night, we were very glad to be indoors and more grateful than ever for the people that gave us the bunks for the night
We ate a great breakfast at the Hut: oatmeal, crumb cake, coffee and tea. After that we headed out into the rain and things went downhill from there. 
It rained almost all day making the trails into rivers and the mud over our ankles. We went over Mariah Peak, Carter Dome, South Carter, Middle Carter, and North Carter, all in the clouds with no views. The climb down North Carter after lunch was very difficult, steep and slick. I fell in the mud twice. We stopped at Imp Shelter for a late lunch, and topped Mt Moriah after lunch.
We got to the trailhead at 6:30 and called the White Birches hostel but they said they had no shuttle driver. We started to walk the 2 miles to the hostel and got a hitch for the last mile. 
The hostel is a cramped, grungy old barn at a campground. They had no food but we got pizza delivered from a local lady who charged $15. My knees are really hurting today. I don't think they ever fully recovered from the climb down from Mount Madison in the Presidential range.

Smoke informed me first thing in the morning that he wasn't feeling very well and was going to stay at the hostel for an extra night. It was a tough decision because Smoke is such a good hiking partner and I enjoy his company, but I decided to hike on.
Smoke had talked one of the campground owners into giving us a ride back to the trailhead in the morning so he dropped me off and I started on my way. 
The first mile and a half was a road walk before I got to a parking lot and turned uphill on the Appalachian Trail. On the first uphill I met CB Mike and talked to him for a while, then passed him and hiked on. Soon after, T-Dub passed me and I didn't see him again all day.
The first climb was up Mount Hayes with views back towards Gorham. Next I climbed Cascade Mountain and on the way down passed a troop of boy scouts and several SOBOs. I passed Dream Lake and got to the beautiful Gentian Pond shelter around 3:00 where I met Goldie, Mary Poppins, and Smokey whom I'd been leapfrogging all morning. They decided to push on to Carlo Col Shelter, another 5.7 miles along with 2800' of climb and 3300' of descent.  I decided I would join them because this would allow me to tackle Mahoosuc Notch in the morning, on Thursday, instead of the afternoon.
We had a big climb up Mt Success which gave us views back to Mt Washington and a farewell look at the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The descent from Mt Success was very steep and slippery with several butt-slides and mud slips.  
I had a short celebration at the Maine/New Hampshire border with Goldie, Mary Poppins, and Smokey, but I hurried on because light was fading and I still had to get to camp. I got into camp around 8: 15 in the dark. It had taken me 12 hours to do the 17 miles and I was exhausted. I set up, ate, and went to bed very muddy and very tired.

This was a 9.5 mile day that felt like 20. We had to complete the Mahoosuc Range which consisted of Goose Eye East, West and North Peaks, Mahoosuc Notch, and Mahoosuc Arm.
Each of the Goose Eyes consisted of a steep climb and a tricky descent, although they looked like mere bumps on the map. Mahoosuc Notch is a mile long boulder field in a narrow v-shaped canyon: boulders the size of buses, cars, and washing machines all jumbled together in a pile, and the hiker is challenged to find a route between them, over them and under them with little direction from the trail builders. The young bucks I was hiking with flew through like Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott doing Parkour! I went more cautiously, while visions of Medevacs dances in my head.It took me almost 2 hours to complete the one mile. Mahoosuc Arm came next which is a 1500' climb, one mile climb, said to be the steepest mile on the Appalachian Trail. I thought that mile would never end. 
Finally in camp, I found Nom Nom, Goldie, Mary Poppins, Smokey, whom I'd been hiking with for most of the day, and Cruise Control, who was on the tent platform next to mine.
I was exhausted, but it was an exciting and satisfying day.","Carlo Col Shelter

I woke up this morning in a crummy mood. It had rained all night, everything was wet, my knees hurt and I just did not want to get out of bed. 
I packed up and climbed Old Speck Mountain with Nom Nom. It was windy, cloudy and somewhat treacherous, but also exhilarating. I did the four mile hike down to Grafton Notch with Cruise Control. Talking with someone really makes the miles go by quickly and I enjoyed walking with Cruise Control when suddenly the shoulder strap on my backpack broke. I fixed it up with some paracord and it worked pretty well to get me down to the parking lot. I guess I'll have to start calling Old Speck ""Broke Pack Mountain""
At the parking lot Trail Angel Candice was in a camp chair giving out water and donuts and she asked ""Does anyone need a ride anywhere?"" Well I'll be. I did happen to need a ride to an outfitter to get a new backpack. I guess it's true: The Trail Provides. So she got a girl sitting in the parking lot to cover her trail magic for her and she drove me 18 miles to the nearest outfitter where I bought a new backpack and got my hiking pole fixed. Then she drove me back into Bethel, Maine and dropped me off at a hotel run by a friend of hers. 
I checked into the Bethel Village Motel with my new backpack and figured how to send my old one back to Gregory Backpacks for a warranty replacement. Then I resupplied, had a nice lunch and dinner and rested my knees. I redid my schedule and now I have a tentative plan to finish on September 2nd. It's going to be tight but I think I can do it. 
I guess my broken backpack strap, besides costing me $250  gave me the rest I needed and jolted me out of my sour mood.
5 month report card!: Physical B -: My knees have really been hurting me the last week or so and I feel like my body is getting worn down. Still all in all, better than I might have hoped. 
Emotional C +: I've been discouraged and down lately, really wanting to get this hike over with, but I'm powering through and keeping my head up, and the trail gives me enough surprises and unexpected beauty to keep me moving forward day after day.
PS: I just got a text from Northstar, whom Frostbite and I hiked with down in the Smokies. She and Stairmaster summited Katahdin today, the first of my former hiking friends to summit (that I know of). So happy for them. It's getting close!","Speck Pond Shelter

Candice pick me up at 6:00 at the hotel and I went with her on her rounds opening up the town park before she dropped me off at the trailhead at 7:00.
I started my hike up Baldpate Mountain and stopped at Baldpate Shelter to adjust my new pack and have a snack. My new pack isn't as comfortable as the old one and I was having a little trouble getting the adjustments right.  But it is a pound lighter, so, tradeoffs.  At the shelter I saw Aloha, Yahtzee, Copperhead, Wrong Way, Pirate, Groundhog and Rocket, getting ready to leave. I Ieap frogged with them for most of the morning.  
The views from the top of Baldpate were amazing , and it was a very challenging climb. I descended into Frye Notch but couldn't stop at the Frye Notch Shelter because they were expecting a helicopter delivery of some materials for the privy, so I pressed on.  Trail volunteers were out there controlling the flow of foot traffic. I stopped on a rock in the middle of the woods for lunch: half a bagel with tuna and the other half with gobs of butter.  Very satisfying.
The rest of the afternoon wasn't very notable,  but the trail was easier than it had been recently. I'm hammocking behind the Bemis Mountain Lean-to. The Aloha tramily has moved on past the shelter because they want to be off this ridge before the storm that's supposed to move in over night.

The day began with a long and steep descent to Sawyer Notch, then a steep climb up Moody Mountain. Coming down again to South Arm Road, I had to wade across a 2-ft deep brook. The Aloha tramway was just leaving to go into town. Next was a 2200 foot climb to Old Blue Mountain where I found a nice rock on top for lunch and had another tuna salad on a half a bagel and gobs of butter on the other.
The rest of the day had ridges and small ups and downs and lots and lots and lots of mud. Maine has been beautiful but very tough hiking: mud unmaintained trails, lots of vertical, and rain almost every day. But then, there are the blueberries. Whenever there's a clearing to let in enough light, like on the top of a peak, the blueberry bushes are bursting with ripe fruit. It takes a while to collect a handful even so, because you have to pick them one at a time from under the leaves, so you can seriously slow your progress if you indulge too much, but sometimes you just need some fresh berries.
I also feel like a lot of my equipment is starting to break down, including my knees. I've had to sew rips in my hammock several times. I sewed up the strap on my backpack several times before it finally ruptured. My poles are falling apart. My water filter has slowed to a trickle. I just need everything to last another 250 miles until I get to Katahdin (especially my knees)
I did 13 miles today in 10 hours. Not very good, but about par for the trails in Maine and New Hampshire. Mary Poppins came into camp after I did and said they saw a moose swimming at Surplus Pond. I've seen lots of moose signs like moose droppings and moose footprints in the trail, but I've yet to see a good view of a moose. I have another 2 and 1/2 weeks. I'm sure I'll see one before the end.

I was on the trail by 7:00, and soon passed by Mary Poppins, Smokey, Squatch and Sempre Dry.  The views from Bemis Mountain towards Saddleback Mountain were beautiful but ominous under stormy skies.  The blueberries were particularly plentiful and juicy.  
There was a steep descent, a stream fording and a steep climb back up to Rt 17 that was easier than I thought from looking at the map. As I continued up Spruce Mountain I was again accompanied by some spruce grouse who walked beside me next to the trail.  The red squirrels in the New Hampshire and Maine woods are particularly playful and cute, although I'm sure they're a terror to the locals. In size they're between a grey squirrel and a chipmunk, but less shy. They are always chattering at you from above your head or throwing pine cones down at you or scurrying around the campsite.
I hiked along a ridge and past several mountain ponds and bogs. No moose, but plenty of hoof prints and droppings. I stopped at Sabbath Day Pond shelter and heard my first loon call! The afternoon hike was pretty flat, but very muddy and frustrating as I only made 13 miles in 8 hours. At 3:00 I gave up and pitched my hammock at the Little Swift River Pond campsite. I was alone, but soon the Aloha tramily rolled in, and by nightfall there were a dozen tents. The campsite has 3 canoes in various states of seaworthiness, but I was too tired to bother.

There was a beautiful sunrise over the pond and I got up, convinced I was the only early riser, and determined to take the one good canoe out.  But several people were already at the shore and the canoe already out on the water, so I just took pictures.
I was on the trail by 7 and at the Rt 4 parking lot by 9:30. 5 miles in 2.5 hours was a good pace, which reflects the good conditions of the trail.
My friend Ken and his brother picked me up and took me to their beautiful house in Rangely. We did the usual shower, laundry, resupply, then went out to lunch in town.  We went for a wonderful swim and rest down at Rangely Lake.  Swimming out to the floating dock brought back memories of Boy Scout camp in the Adirondacks in the 70s.
We went back to their house for a steak and potato dinner. The steaks were huge like the Flintstones' brontosaurus ribs and so delicious. I had no problem polishing mine off.  I can't thank Ken and Dave enough for their hospitality. Tomorrow I'm back on the trail for a 5 day stretch without resupply.","Little Swift River Pond campsite

Before long I was up in the clouds and it was rainy, misty, and windy.  There's a 3 mile ridge walk from Saddleback to The Horn to Junior Saddleback Mountain that on a clear day must offer spectacular views.  But in the blowing clouds there was all shadowy outlines of trees and rocks, and a foreign, slightly disorienting feeling. In treeless landscapes, trails are marked with small piles of rocks called cairnes.  I'd sight the next cairn on the top of a rise and assume I was approaching the top of the hill. When I get to the cairn, another granite cliff would loom in front of me out of the fog, and so up I would go, rise after rise, never knowing when I'd reached the top.  
By the afternoon I'd climbed down from Saddleback Junior and was having lunch in the rain when I got a text from Sherpa that her father's health had taken a turn for the worse and it was only a matter of days (he has been Ill and this was expected). I spent a half hour making plans to get out of the woods and home ASAP. Luckily I had cell service. 
I hiked on to the Poplar Ridge Shelter and because I had to get out as early as possible the next day, I decided to sleep in the shelter instead of my hammock.  Mary Poppins and her tramily came in around 6:00 and set up tents around the shelter.","Rt 4 trailhead

I was up by 5:00 and on the trail by 6:00. It had rained all night and was still raining when I left. I've been in Maine for about a week and I don't think there's been a day that it hasn't rained. 
The hike today was full of mud and bogs, rocks and roots. At one point I slipped on a submerged root and fell flat on my face in a 6 inch deep mud puddle. I swear Maine is out to get me.
I called Sherpa when I got cell service and found out that her father had passed away in the night.  Jim was a good man, a good father, father in law, and grandfather. He will be missed by all who knew him. 
I climbed Mt Spaulding and Sugarloaf. I passed the ""200 miles left to go!"" point, then shortly after, the ""you've already gone 2000 miles"" point. My celebratory mood was somewhat dampened by the fact that I was leaving the trail, unfinished for now, while being so tantilizingly close. Next was a slippery climb down into Caribou Valley where I finally emerged from the clouds after 2 days. I turned right on Caribou Pond Rd and walked about a half mile to the gate across the road and the trailhead. Then I walked about another mile until I saw Ken, Dave and my sister in the pickup truck, coming to pick me up.
We went back to Ken's house where I showered, again, then my sister drove me to her house in Connecticut where my brother will pick me up tomorrow morning and take me home in what I've been calling the ""Baggins Relay"".  
I'm so overwhelmed by all the help and support I've received from family and friends at this time. Not only Ken and his brother who drove all over for me and my sister and brother made long trips and took off from work or other plans, but I got several offers to come up to Maine and drive me home from other friends.
I will be off the trail for a week to 10 days, but fear not! I shall return to finish this thing out. Please come back and finish it with me.","Poplar Ridge Shelter

I spent 8 days off the trail with my father in law's funeral. Even though the reason for being off the trail was sad, I was glad to see all my family and friends and especially my new baby granddaughter. With the weather forecast calling for rain in Maine 9 out of the next 10 days, my departure was less than enthusiastic. 
Although it was difficult to leave, I only have 2 weeks left to finish off my thru hike and I'm anxious to get it done.  My son drove to the airport and I checked my garbage bag-wrapped  backpack for the flight to Portland Maine. I passed the time before my flight with an overpriced bloody Mary and worried about what else I forgot.  I originally made my flight for the wrong day, then I forgot to take the fuel canisters out of my backpack, then forgot to take my knife out of my carry on, then forgot to put my rain jacket back INTO my backpack, then forgot whether or not my notebook and pen were in my backpack.  My brain is all over the place.  
The flight was without incident. My pack made it through baggage claim without damage, I found my shuttle driver right away. Kim, the lady I had arranged the shuttle with, had to go to the hospital yesterday so she arranged for Kevin to pick me up. Turns out Kim is Kevin's ex.  Kevin was an hour from the airport, the ride to the trailhead was 3 1/2 hours, then he had a 3 hi our ride home.  Needless to say, Kevin earned his fee today.  We had a very nice chat during the ride, Kevin is an interesting fellow.  
By the time I walked from the Caribou Pond trailhead to the trail it was about 3:30. I had planned to go only a mile in today, but I decided to press on and try to find a stealth site.  I climbed South Crocker then North Crocker Mountains in the rain and the clouds The climbs and descents were easier than some of the recent climbs. I found a stealth side on the down side of North Crocker by 6:15, had dinner, and settled in for the night under rainy skies.
Editor's note: I heard from Frostbite and Smoke while I was home.  Smoke injured his knee when he slipped down a wet rock face. He's back home rehabbing for the next few weeks.  Frostbite rolled his ankle and slid down another wet rock face.  He's convalescing for a few days in Bethel ME and should be back on the trail soon.","Caribou Pond Rd Trailhead

It rained most of the night, but not too hard.  It stopped around 4:00 and I was able to pack up camp without getting  rained on.  
I filtered some water with my new water filter. I didn't realize how slowly my old filter was working until I saw how fast the new one was. I started the long gradual 4 mile descent to Rt 27.  It was rocky and rooty, but not very difficult.  The sun came out for about 10 minutes when I reached the road, but quickly retreated behind the clouds.
The climb up Bigalow South Horn was steep and technical.  I was back in the clouds so the Horn offered no views. I met Freebird whom I had not seen since Vermont, and his friend No Bear at the Horn Pond overlook.
I had lunch at the Horn Pond shelter while it started to rain. I continued the climb up the South Horn.  After the Horn came Bigelow West Peak. It started raining hard with thunder in the distance as I approached the top.  The peak was an exposed granite knob that was a little tricky in the rain and the wind. The Farout Guide says the West Peak has some of the best views in Maine and you can see all the way from Mt Washington in the south to Mt Katahdin in the north. Needless to say, I saw lots of clouds.  Next came Bigalow Avery Peak, named after Myron Avery, one time resident of Maine and the main architect of the AT.  I leapfrogged with Sweet Tooth over the Bigalow's.  The climb down was a little tricky even though the rain had stopped, so I went slowly.
I hit the 0.3 side trail to the Stafford Notch camp site, which wound through a notch strewn with huge boulders. I set up camp in the dark and dank campsite and called it a day.  I have to say, it was a pretty miserable day of hiking.","

It didn't rain last night, but everything was still wet when I woke up.  The forecast called for more rain today, and I was still up in the clouds.  I was hiking by 7:10 and back on the AT by 7:25.
The climb up Little Bigalow Mountain wasn't too bad, compared to recent climbs.  Little Bigalow is actually a 1/2 mile long ridge that, on clear days, supposedly has great views.  I had, you guessed it, more clouds. But it did give me a cell signal and allowed me to call Sherpa and wish her a happy 40th anniversary. One of my regrets on this trip is I'm not able to celebrate our 40th, but we'll make up for it when I'm done.  
The descent down Little Bigalow was gradual and easy hiking.  About half way down I dropped out of the clouds and started getting some nice views.  I passed several day hikers and SOBOs going the other way, including a nice local family, Mike, Shannon and Anneliese. I stopped to talk to them for a while and answer their questions about my thru hike.  They said they were going to check out this blog, so if they do, hi guys!
The trail was easy and I made good time.  I stopped for lunch on a quiet pebble beach on Flagstaff Lake.  I took my afternoon break on the shore of West Carry Pond. I was going to stop at West Carry Pond campsite for the day, but it was early and decided to hike on. This would put me in a better position to get to the Kennebec River before 2:00 to catch the canoe ferry and into Caratunk for resupply. More on that tomorrow.
The trail between West Carry, Middle Carry, and East Carry Ponds is the portage route used by Col Benedict Arnold and his forces on their way to attack Quebec. It was also extremely wet and muddy. This had me thinking about how difficult it must have been for an army of 1000 soldiers and all of their supplies and weapons to cross through the wilderness with the type of tools, navigation and clothing they had back then.  Being a soldier must have been a difficult proposition.
The descent to East Carry Pond was much easier, and I arrived at my target stealth site on the shores of the pond around 5:30. I set up camp, had dinner, and watched the sun set while I worked on my journal from a rock jutting out into the pond. Eventually the bugs drove me away from the water and into the safety and comfort of my bug-net-enclosed hammock for the night. If yesterday was a miserable day for hiking, today was stupendous.","Stafford Notch camp site

I woke up around 11:00 last night and looked out of my hammock to the right.  The moon was up and glimmering on the pond and I heard 2 loons calling in the distance.  Maine perfection.
I got up early this morning because I was nervous about making it to the Kennebec River to catch the canoe ferry before the ferryman goes home at 2:00.  I had to use my headlamp to pack up and crept down to the water side to get a few pictures of the dawn breaking on the lake.  
The sun was out today, but it started pretty cold in the morning.  I could see my breath for the first time since Georgia, but I can't tell you the temperature since the battery on my little pack thermometer seems to have finally run out.
The trail had some very soft and smooth pine-covered sections interspersed with the usual mud pits.  I met a few SOBOs, flip-floppers and LASHers all heading south.  I stopped at Pierce Pond Lean-to for a break.  The Lean-to is right on the beautiful lake, and I saw my first pair of loons, far out in the middle.
The ford of the Pierce Pond Stream was mid-thigh on me due to all the rain we've been having.  Turning right, the trail follows the stream for several miles, past many powerful waterfalls and cascades, some 10 to 20 feet high.  
After crossing a stream that feeds the Pierce Pond Stream on a funky log bridge, I met Juno putting her shoes on.  She had just forded the stream, not noticing the bridge.  
Pierce Pond Stream empties into the Kennebec River near the ferry landing. The ATC pays to have a ferryman take hikers back and forth across the Kennebec in a canoe from June through September, but he's only there from 9:00 till 2:00, so if you miss him it's either wait till tomorrow, or a long walk around.  Or if you can get him on the phone, he may agree to make a special trip for you (for $50).
Juno and I were there by 11:00, so the ferryman (I just like saying that word) and his beautiful golden retriever took us across.  I gave him a tip, but as the song says, I didn't pay him  till I got to the other side.  
Once across, I called the Stirling Inn in Caratunk to give us a shuttle to their place 1 1/4 down the road and he was there in a few minutes.  Juno is staying there tonight, as I had planned to, but it was only 12:00 and perfect hiking weather, so I decided to press on.  But not before resupplying, charging my spare batteries, and eating a frozen pizza for lunch (after it had been properly cooked).  I turned down the offered free shower and laundry because I'm sure if I didn't, I'd end up staying the night.
The guy at the Inn drove me back to the trailhead and there I met Pilgrim and Mrs. Pilgrim handing out trail magic. Pilgrim thru hiked last year and he and the Mrs. Drove up from Texas and we're following the SOBOers down the trail. I didn't take much since I had just eaten and resupplied. There I also met Boomerang who was just around 150 miles from completing his triple crown! The triple crown of long distance hiking is the AT, the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail.
Turning up from the parking lot, the trail got very muddy again, then dried out for a while as it headed the last 5 miles to the Pleasant Pond Leant-to where I'm staying.  It's only 4:00 but I'm tired and pleased with the 15.5 miles I did today, including the ferry and the resupply stop.  This also positions me to shave a day off my current schedule which I can use in the 100 mile wilderness, or to take a zero the day before summiting Mt Katahdin.","Stealth Site, East Carry Pond

It rained a little this morning right before dawn but stopped by the time I got up. 
I was on the trail by 6:50 and the trail quickly turned up Pleasant Pond Mountain. The trail was not difficult but pretty muddy in spots. The top of the mountain was once again in the clouds and so afforded no views. The ridge walk over to Middle Mountain was pleasant and easy walking. After a day or two without rain, the trails are finally starting to dry out.
On the way down from Middle Mountain. I met Rock Hound who got his nickname because he is a retired geologist. He's flip-flopping from Unionville, New York where he got off the trail for a few weeks after injuring himself. Many times, if a NOBO gets injured and they are delayed such that they will be unable to finish before Baxter State Park closes in early October, they will flip up to Mount Katahdin and start hiking south back to the point they had to get off. I had a nice chat with him and his hiking companion Wood. I didn't even want to know how Wood got his trail name.
I met several other south bounders, all either section hikers or flip floppers.  It's a little late to be starting SOBO now because you'd be hiking through the southern mountains in the winter. 
I stopped for lunch at Bald Mountain Lean-to, and the sun started peaking in and out. I proceeded up Bald Mountain, which some people call Moxie Bald because it's next to Moxie Pond. It seems a lot of mountains are named after ponds and ponds are named after mountains up here.  Bald Mountain is mostly treeless on top due to forest fire that occurred in the early 1900s. There were some views on the way up but once again, I got the top it was socked in. I did however get cell phone service for the first time in a while and so called Sherpa and made a reservation with Shaw's hiker hostel in Monson for tomorrow. 
It was a long and gentle descent down from Bald Mountain. The trail has been much easier since Little Bigelow and I've been able to make bigger miles. 
I had to ford two rivers this afternoon, one thigh deep and slow moving, one knee deep and a little swifter. I have two more tomorrow, too. This is when the mesh-top trail runners come in hand as opposed to waterproof boots. I just wade in and within a half hour, my feet are relatively dry again. 
 I stopped at a stealth site off an old logging road that crosses the Appalachian Trail at around 5:45. I made dinner (freeze dried chicken teriyaki, pretty poor) and once again the mosquitoes drove me into my hammock by 7:00 where I caught up on some journaling.","

It was a quiet night last night. I was camping by myself in a dense pine forest off an old logging road. Except at the Sterling Inn yesterday, I've only seen a few NOBOs the past few days.
I was on the trail by 7:00.  I had 13 miles to go till I reached ME 15 and the shuttle to Shaw's Hiker Hostel. Shaw's is a very popular place for hikers to stop off and prepare for the 100 Mile Wilderness where there are no resupply opportunities or other off-trail services. I was glad I called yesterday and nabbed a bunk because I got the last one.  Because of the rain forecast for today, I think a lot of people are zeroing at Shaw's. 
I had to ford 4 rivers today, including the East Branch of the Piscataquis River.  The Piscataquis was thigh deep and moving fast. I was a little nervous crossing it alone, but I went slow and prevailed.  
Most of the morning followed the Piscataquis down stream, and I made over 2 mph because the trail was smooth, mostly dry, and cruisey.
I saw very few people today, just a few SOBOs and one NOBO, Peace Pipe.  I'd last seen him a few days before I got off the trail for a week, so he's obviously going pretty slow.  He told me a story about a SOBO woman he spoke to who got lost for 9 days in the 100 Mile Wilderness with no food or gear.  She'd lost her way going for water after she pitched her tent. After she finally found her way out, she went to a hospital and recovered for 2 weeks before buying all new gear and continuing her hike south.  That's crazy stuff! 
I got to the ME 15 parking list around 1:40 and caught the shuttle into Shaw's. I showered, did laundry and resupplied for the next 100 miles.  Over $100 and has to be well over 15 pounds, maybe 20! Yikes! 
I caught up on my blogging and now I'm ready to head into town and get some real food!  I don't think I'll have much cell service in the 100 Mile Wilderness, and anyway I'll be preserving my battery.  So I won't be updating my blog for the next week.  Next time you hear from me, I should be getting ready to summit Katahdin!","Old logging road stealth site

Last night I went to The Lakeside pub in Monson and sat with Pork Chop and Pinky.  I had the pot roast which was excellent.  This morning was breakfast at Shaw's Hostel: 3 eggs, home fries, bacon, blueberry pancakes and lots of coffee. While waiting for the shuttle I chatted with CB Mike.  It seems Fuel Rod and Cruise Control are a few days behind us and doing big miles, so should be catching up soon. I also spoke with Traveller, who was with Smoke when he hurt himself and decided to get off the trail.
Poet drive us to the trailhead and shared some of his poetry and words of wisdom with us on the way.  You could feel the excitement in the van as everyone is stoked to start this final leg of our journey.
The weather was perfect for hiking today: clear and cool, sunny and breezy, and it's supposed to be like this all week. . The rocks in the beginning were slate, and so are slippery when wet. The trail was fairly flat today, pine needle covered with sectionals of mud and roots. I passed manywaterfalls small ponds and bogs. I think Maine is becoming my favorite section of the trail, especially as the weather starts to get better.
I forded 4 streams today. Other hikers stopped to take off their boots and put in their Crocs for the crossing, but I just waded in with my trail shoes and socks. First because I have no Crocs and my sandles don't offer enough protection for my feet, second because my feet are usually wet and muddy already and this offers a chance to at least get them clean. It did not occur to me until the third crossing, where the water was almost up to my waist, that perhaps I should take my phone, which I keep in my fanny pack, and put it in a plastic bag before I wade into the water 
I hiked in and around Shaggy, Eight Lives, Pigpen, Ronan, Zen, Checkmate and Caesar. Eight Lives got his trail name back on April 1st during a wind storm when he came within 5 feet of getting clobbered when the top half of a tree broke off and fell on the trail. I passed Peace Pipe 2 or 3 times as well. He's a very slow hiker.
I arrived at Long Pond Stream Shelter around 6:00 tired but pleased with my 15 miles considering my late start and my heavy pack with 7 days of food. And, less than 100 miles to go! Excited for the rest of the 100 mile wilderness and to get this thing done!","

It was cold last night.  I think it must have got down in the 40s, which made it difficult to get out of my sleeping bag this morning.  For breakfast I had a dehydrated quinoa bowl, with carrots, pineapple, cranberries, coconut milk etc.  It was very good, and filling. I'm so tired of oatmeal or pop tarts.
My first climb this morning was to the ledges on top of Barren Slide. There were some beautiful views of the lake below, and I just missed seeing a float plane take off. Zen, Pigpen and Ronan were there packing up their gear, having slept at the ledges last night.
Heading towards Barren Mountain, I passed the tents of several more people who slept up there last night.  On top of Barren there is a partially dismantled fire tower, but no views. There was however a cell signal, so I called Sherpa.  
Next came 4th Mountain, then 4th Mountain Bog which had a lot of carnivorous pitcher plants.  Climbing up 3rd Mountain, the trail passes the site of a plane crash from the 1980s, which I'm told involved a father and son, both of whom survived.
I stopped on some ledges leading up to Columbus Mountain and enjoyed my Spam-on-a-tortilla with mustard in the beautiful sunshine.  All day has been perfect hiking weather yet again. 
After Columbus Mountain, I met Here and There at a stream while I got water.  He was a nice, laid back dude flip flopping down to Pennsylvania. Most of the day I've been leapfrogging with Shaggy, Checkmate, Caesar, Zen, Pigpen and Ronan. 
I pushed on to the summit  of Chairback Mountain which had some nice views of Hay and Whitecap Mountains, tomorrow's challenges.  
The next 2 or 3 miles into camp were unremarkable except for a treacherous descent down a rock slide coming down from Chairback.  I'm camped at a stealth site next to East Chairback Pond. I'm about 15 yards away from the edge of the lake and I'm going to try it without my tarp tonight so I can get a view of the stars and moon.","Long Pond Stream Lean-to

Laying in my hammock last night, it occurred to me how silent Maine is this time of year.  No mating birds chirping, no crickets or frogs. When the wind is down and you're not near a stream, the silence is complete.  
Some hikers are starting to slow down now. After rushing to make miles for so many days, they suddenly realize the end is near. Many can have no jobs or spouses or children to go back to. I'm getting some of that feeling myself. Although I'm still looking forward to after the hike, I realize for me this may be a once in a lifetime chance to live in the woods, be a nomad with nothing more to do than get up, pack up, and walk. The simplicity can be addicting. I've never been able to completely shake the feelings of off-trail responsibilities, but that's just my personality. That feeling of being free, yet tethered has been difficult. I think some people become untethered out here and never fully go back. 
It was a nice quiet night and morning on the lake.  Someone had commented in the Farout trail guide that they had seen a mother moose and her baby swimming in the pond a few months back.  No moose for me. But I did get a nice peaceful sunrise over the pond in the morning.
I was back up on the AT before 7:00. The trail was a nice gentle slope down to the Pleasant River, which I had to ford.  My feet had been totally dry for one whole day!  The other side of the river started an area called the Hermitage Preserve and Hagas Gorge.  I spoke to Huff, an ATC Ridgerunner who shared a lot of info about the section of trail coming up and about Katahdin .  The Hermitage has some old growth pines and the Gorge is a series of cascades and waterfalls in a steep rock canyon.  I took part of the Hagas Gulf side trail to look at some waterfalls, then continued up the AT.
I hiked with Geo most of the day, and also leapfrogged with Shaggy and Eight Lives.  We climbed Hagas Mountain and I got a call out to Sherpa from the top.  We had lunch at Sidney Tappan tent site and we were joined by Boomerang. After lunch I hiked mostly alone up West Peak, Hay Mountain and Whitecap.  From Whitecap I got my first view of Mt Katahdin! Man, it looks big! 
My target was Long Brook Lean-to, but my stretch goal was East Branch Lean-to which would cut my 20 mile day tomorrow down to 16.  But I started getting really tired on my way down from Whitecap, and when I saw Geo setting up camp at Logan Brook, that sealed the deal: I stayed at Logan Brook tonight.","Easy Chairback Pond stealth site

I was the first one out of camp this morning. I had 20 miles to do and I wanted to get an early start.  I stopped and talked to Traveler who was camped down the trail a bit. He's hoping to summit on the 8th, the same day I am.
The first half of the morning was easy hiking: smooth, soft, gradual descent with perfect weather.  I did 2.5 mph for the first few hours.
I hiked up Little Boardman Hill, which was fairly easy, but still 800' of elevation. That was the only elevation change to speak of today.  
I passed 3 section hikers, and one of them told me there was trail magic all day at Jo-Mary Road, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  That put a bit of a spring in may step.
I ate lunch on a nice sandy beach on Crawford Pond.  Two locals and their dog came along and we had a nice talk, telling me all about their hiking adventures in the area. Or, one of them had a nice talk, and I had a nice listen, it was a little hard to get a word in edgewise. But they were very nice.
After lunch I hurried along to Jo-Mary Road, hoping for a second lunch.  There was no trail magic there, but there were a few other disappointed hikers who had heard the same story from the same section hiker.
The last 4 miles into Antler Campsite were equally easy.  I arrived at this beautiful campsite under large red pines on the shores of Jo-Mary Pond.  I was the first one there. Geo followed about an hour later and three others eventually came, but I had expected a larger crowd on such a beautiful day over Labor Day weekend.
The weather was pretty much perfect again all day. It got a little hot in the afternoon, so I worked up a sweat and it brought out the mosquitoes for the first time in a while.  
I sat making dinner and having a nice chat with Geo and Modesty, one of the other 3 hikers.  As the sun set, I crawled into my hammock and decided to go without the tarp tonight.  Maybe I'll get to see some stars.","Logan Brook Lean-to

I slept without my tarp last night, so I was able to see the moon and the stars through the trees above. It occurs to me that I haven't seen much of the stars this trip, and camping out so much of the time you might find that surprising.  But most of the time I'm usually under the trees or my tarp or both, and after hiking all day I usually don't have the energy or desire to crawl out of my hammock in the middle of the night to see the stars 
I got up at 5:00 this morning to go sit by the lake and watch the sunrise.  Definitely the best sunrise of the trip.  I took a time lapse video of the sunrise and didn't realize that it drained 25% off my phone battery.  Oops.
Had a nice breakfast and good conversation with Geo and Modesty while we watched the sun come up.  I had this dehydrated buckwheat breakfast with bananas and coconut milk. So good! 
I was on the trail by 7:00, and the first 8 miles flew by at almost 2.5 mph.  The trail was flat and dry and went mostly along the Nahmakanta River.  I stopped at the Nahmakanta River Lean-to for a break and saw Shaggy just leaving. Then I stopped at Nahmakanta Lake beach for lunch and met Spicoli and his dog, Lucy, whom I'd seen several times yesterday.  
Geo caught up with me at lunch and we hiked together for the rest of the day.  We leapfrogged with Spicoli and Lucy and Shaggy for much of the day.  I also met Chuckles, a NOBO lady who sounds like she's from Australia.
It was sunny, warm and humid today, which quickly sapped my strength in the afternoon. I saw Katahdin two more times today, each time getting closer!
I rolled into Rainbow Stream Lean-to around 5:45 and it was already getting dark. I set up camp, filtered water, bathed in the me stream and cooked in the dark, talking with Geo.  
We did 21.6 miles today, which I think is a record for me with a full pack.  In general I'm feeling strong, but I was totally spent by the end of the day today. And I have something going on in the bottom of my foot for the last two days, a bruise or some sort of deep tissue injury. But at this point I'm gutting it out! 30 more miles and 3 more hiking days until I achieve one of my life's dreams!","Antlers Campsite

It was a nice campsite, under the pines, by the stream.  I slept without my tarp and I could see the moon at night, and I heard float planned and loons in the morning as I started out.
I hiked alone along Rainbow Stream for the morning, stopping several times to try to get pictures of the loons.  I stopped for a break when I saw Shaggy at the side of the trail, and Geo caught up with me.  We hiked together for the rest of the day.  
The trail was easy for the 4 miles next to Rainbow Lake. Geo is a faster walker than I, so we made good time as I hurried to keep up.  In the afternoon we climbed Rainbow Ledges where we got the last cell signal before Katahdin. I made reservations for a hostel in Millinocket for two days hence and called Sherpa.
Coming down from the Ledges and heading out of the 100 mile wilderness I started getting the feeling that this hike was coming to a close.  We stopped at the Hurd Brook Shelter, the last one in the 100 Mile Wilderness and read the log book entries of many of the people we'd hiked with over the last 6 months and had passed this way before us.  We left messages for those who would pass this way after us.
We hiked the last 4 miles out of the Wilderness with Shaggy, out into a dirt road and across Abol Bridge where we were taken back by a view of the looming Mount Katahdin. Geo and I decided to take a cabin at the privately owned and operated Abol Bridge Campground and invited Shaggy to stay with us.
I took a shower and washed my hiking clothes in the shower as well. Went back to the camp store and got some beer and ice cream (all the essentials) and went back to the cabin to make dinner.  We sat at the picnic table and talked until the bugs drove us inside. The little no-see-us left big red welts on the tops of my feet and my arms.
I realized I wouldn't be sleeping in my hammock any more on my trip. I probably won't be using my stove or eating out of plastic bags anymore either.  I only have an easy 10 miles to Katahdin Stream Campground, two nights in Millinocket as I wait for my friends to arrive to accompany me up the last climb, then the ascent of Katahdin on the 8th. This really is coming to a close.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Shaggy left early to go out his name on the list at the kiosk at the entrance of Baxter State Park for one of the 12 camping spots reserved for thru hikers at the Birches campsite. Turns out he didn't need to hurry because he was the only one there and the spaces didn't fill up as everyone fears.  He came back to Abol Bridge campground and had the included breakfast with me, Geo, Juno, Spicoli and a few others.  
Geo and I set out at 8:10 at a quick pace.  We had 4 hours and 10 miles to go to meet his wife at the Katahdin Stream Campground where she would drive me to my hostel in Millinocket and then to their Airbnb. The trail was easy (except for the swarm of bugs) and we got there in plenty of time.  I joked to Geo that the walk was like on the finale of Survivor where the final 3 walk down the path to flashbacks of all the contestants to jat came before, except this was a trail flashback: thera some mud like Vermont, and some rocks like Pennsylvania.  Here's a river crossing like Maine, and some mosquitoes like Massachusetts!
We registered at the Ranger station where I got NOBO card number 616.  I was number 978 at Amicalola and something like 475 at Harper's Ferry, so that would tell me something like 140 people passed me between Harper's and Baxter.
Geo and his wife Sue dropped me off at the Appalachian Trail Hostel and we promised to keep in touch. He's summiting tomorrow, and I'm waiting for the day after. I went through my regular (and final) Hostel routine: loaner clothes, shower, laundry, charge electronics, resupply, eat.
I had Mac and cheese with brisket burnt ends for lunch and a bacon cheese burger for dinner.  Trying to pack away some calories. I made some phone calls and caught up on my journal.  Tomorrow will be a zero, and then Friday is the big day!","Abol Bridge campground

My 3 good friends Harry, Kerry and John, came to pick me up at the hotel and we went out for dinner in Millinocket. We were planning an early morning, so we went right back and went to sleep.
I didn't sleep very well. I think the excitement got to me and after sleeping for a few hours I lay awake from 11:50 till about 3:00, before getting a few naps in until our alarms went off at 4:30.  We were at the CircleK gas station at 5:00 for a quick breakfast and in line to get into the park by 5:45.  We parked at the Katahdin Stream Campground day use lot and I was surprised and pleased to see Cruise Control and Fuel Rod walking across the lot. We were on our way up to Mt Katahdin by 6:50.  
The day was overcast and as we approached the steep part of the ascent, the tops of the peaks of Mt Katahdin were wreathed in clouds. Mount Katahdin has several peaks including Baxter Peak, our destination. 
As we left the tree line and started up the daunting granite slabs and boulder fields, it started to rain.  We soon stowed our trekking pokes so we could use our hand to climb as the rain got heavier. There were a few sections that were quite challenging, including areas where we had to use rebar that had been drilled into the granite to haul ourselves up.  About half way up the steepest part, the rain, mixed with sleet, really came down and the wind started blowing it sideways. We sought shelter in a small cave and found Cruise Control and Fuel Rod huddled there.  I briefly thought about calling off the climb, but no one wanted to go back down those climbs in the rain, and it probably would have been unsafe.
After about 15 minutes it had stopped enough to continue our climb.  Eventually we reached the ""tablelands"" where the trail leveled out and for a mile or so as it ran towards Baxter Peak.  The views from the tablelands were amazing.  In front of us you could see the shredded clouds blowing up one side of the mountain through the gaps and out the other side. Behind us and below the clouds, you could see the other Katahdin peaks and the lakes and streams below.  
We climbed the final rock piles of Baxter Peaks we passed CB Mike on his way down. A little further and I saw it: through the blowing clouds, the outline of the Katahdin sign and the rock cairn marking the top of Baxter Peak. And then it was gone again in the clouds.  I may have cried. A little.  I waited for my compatriots and we walked up to the sign. I hugged it, then climbed up the back and had my picture taken by myself, then with my friends, then with Cruise Control and Fuel Rod who were waiting at the top.
The views from the peak of the valleys, mountains and lakes below peaking in and out of the clouds were magnificent. We lingered for a while eating lunch and talking to 2019 thru hiker 7-11 until it got close to 1:00 and we had to go. We decided to hike down via the Abol Trail to avoid descending the sheer rock faces on the Hunt trail that we followed up. So when we got to Thoreau Springs (named in honor of Henry David Thoreau who attempted, and failed, to scale Baxter Peak in 1846), we hung a left and started our descent.
The descent of the Abol Trail was very challenging in and of itself, but as Poet, the proprietor of Shaw's Hostel said, ""If you fall going down Abol you'll skidder. If you fall going down Hunt, you splat. It's better to skidder than to splat"".
My hiking buddies were feeling the wear and tear of the climb today, so it was a little slow going. We left the park by around 7:00 and got to the hotel in Bangor around 8:00.  Our wives were waiting for us in the lobby with balloons, signs, champagne and a stack of pizzas!  It was the most thoughtful and fitting celebration I could ever ask for.  
Well, that's it, really.  I plan on posting a few post-hike blog entries, one with further reflections on my reintegration into polite society and maybe a gear review, so please come back. I will also be editing and posting a few videos after I get a chance to wade through the thousands of photos and videos I took, so search for Paul Mazouat and AT Thru Hike on YouTube in a few weeks.
I have so many people to thank, which I will do in one of those future posts, but for now I really want to thank my wife, Sue, without whom none of this would be possible, and my many fellow class of 2023 who shared their passion for the woods and for this fantastic trail.  And thanks to all of you readers.  Thanks for following along!","Katahdin Stream Campground
