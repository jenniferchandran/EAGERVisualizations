Flip-Side or Boudreau (Boo-droh),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659819,"So, in 2021, the plan was to retire in January 2023, thru-hike the AT and live off my savings/investments.
Then 2022 happened, so, I had to get creative.
The Plan:
Instead of retiring, I will continue to work around 12 to 20 hours a weekSince my work is mostly autonomous and can be completed anytime/anywhere, I will hike 5 days a week and work 2Using 2 cars, I can hike from one car to the other and always have a way to drive into town to work when necessaryI can also use my 2 work days to rest, clean up and resupply

Flip-Side or Boudreau (Boo-droh),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659820,"My first practice thru-hike will be the Foothills Trail. Last spring, I hiked the trail from Oconee State Park to the half-way point and back but I've never hiked it from one end to the other as one continuous effort. The trail itself is 76.2 miles but there are several additional side trails to waterfalls and points of interest.
I did the out-and-back in 4.5 days. First day was a half day at 10 miles, second day was 16+ miles, third day was 13+ miles, fourth day was 21+ miles and the fifth day was 16+ miles. I was beat when I arrived at my car. That fourth day was just too much.
This time I plan on taking 5 whole days and splitting up the mileage more evenly. I may even take an extra half day depending on how the weather looks. Right now, it's supposed to be cloudy, cold and rainy with a chance of freezing rain on Day 3. Not looking forward to that but what better way to dial-in my gear. And since I'll be using 2 cars on the AT, I'll be able to stuff them with back-up/situational gear to make each stretch of my hike more enjoyable.",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Wed",0
Flip-Side or Boudreau (Boo-droh),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659827,"*I am posting this using the email method so no telling if it will work or not. Also, this should be my 3rd post so my journal should go live. Fingers crossed.* 
If I have learned anything from the countless backpacking trips I've taken over the past 13 years, it's that I hate using gear that's not easy to use. Same goes for gear that takes too long to set up or that must constantly be adjusted or attended to. 

I love the warmth of my NeoAir XTherm sleeping pad but I hate blowing it up (or using the inflation bag). I also hate deflating it because I have to roll it up to squeeze out the air and then roll it back out so that I can fold it over and re-roll it so that it will fit in the stuff sack. I could forgo the stuff sack but after experiencing a pin-hole leak one night that forced me to have to re-inflate it several times throughout the night, I am motivated to protect it. 

Sometimes I just need to practice using a piece of gear to perfect a reasonable method for setting it up. I used to hate my Big Agnes Scout UL2 until I figured out the best and quickest way to set it up. It's a trekking pole tent that uses 12 stakes. When I first started using it, I would fight with it for 10 - 15 minutes before I was somewhat happy with the result. Now I can set it up perfectly in about 5 minutes. Yeah, there are free-standing tents that can be set up in 2 or 3 minutes but they weigh more and/or they're smaller. The Scout UL2 weighs 25 ounces (not including stakes) and is 90"" x 54"". It also has a peak height of 43"". I can practically dance a jig in this thing. 

I'm somewhat frugal so I resist the temptation to upgrade to the latest gear if I'm happy with what I have. I'm still entering my gear into the GEAR page but when I'm done, I'll post an entry about it. 

Thanks for reading!

Flip-Side or Boudreau (Boo-droh),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659840,"I've been reading a lot of comments from previous thru-hikers about how they didn't use a bear canister and, more than not, hung their food in the shelter or kept it in their tent when cables or a good tree were unavailable.Before moving to SC, I never had to concern myself with bears (just racoons) so hanging a bear bag is relatively new to me. But I'll admit, I get it. At the end of a long day when there's barely enough light to set up my tent and get supper going, finding a suitable tree branch to hang my food is the last thing I want to do. 

So, since I know myself and how I feel after hiking all day, I'm carrying an extra 2 pounds (BearVault BV450 Solo Bear Resistant Food Canister). And hey, it won't really be extra because I'll cut 32 ounces from somewhere else to make up the difference. Two ounces here and three ounces there (times 6) should do the trick. And besides, my bear canister can also double as a small table or stool! Another bonus is that it will protect my food from mice as well. WIN WIN! 

And although I don't know how true this is on the AT, I can't help thinking about how they say ""a fed bear is a dead bear"".",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Fri",0
Flip-Side or Boudreau (Boo-droh),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659886,"For the past couple of years, I have become increasingly interested in Stoicism (and to a lesser degree Taoism). Every day I read a chapter from *The Daily Stoic* by Ryan Holiday. I've also read *How To Think Like a Roman Emperor* by Donald Robertson. I have another 10 or so ebooks/audiobooks that I plan to read/listen to as well. Right now I'm at the stage where I recognize the wisdom but find it challenging to implement. I'm trying though.

*The Daily Stoic* begins with a discussion about control and choice using the well known prayer, ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference.‚Äù The author explains that we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle. 

This may seem like common sense but how often do we hear people incessantly complain about the weather or beat themselves up over a bad gear choice. In the case of the former, the weather is beyond our control. It is not out to get us. It just is. In the case of the latter, that decision is in the past. Yes, we must live with the consequences until we have the choice and control to change it but we can also choose to innovate a temporary solution, appreciate the lesson we have learned and/or embrace the suck. The key is to not set ourselves up for misery by making sure that we adequately prepare for the journey. My next entry will detail how I plan to do that and what, specifically, I will be trying to learn. 

""Everyone faces up more bravely to a thing for which he has long prepared himself, sufferings, even, being withstood if they have been trained for in advance. Those who are unprepared, on the other hand, are panic-stricken by the most insignificant happenings."" - Seneca, Letters from a Stoic",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Wed",0
