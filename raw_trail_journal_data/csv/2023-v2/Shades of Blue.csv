Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659511,"I've been doing a lot of day hiking and a few overnight hikes in preparation for my thru-hike.   My focus for this hike was to camp in cooler weather since I have a start date in late February.  I hiked a loop in the Smokies following the Wolf Ridge trail over Gregory Bald (which the old AT used to go over).  Camped at campsite #92 on Long Hungry Ridge trail, up to the AT on the Twentymile trail then back to the Twentymile Ranger station and home.  It was a good hike.  I did a little over 11 miles the first day then around 8 miles the next day.   Gregory Bald was absolutely beautiful and I had a great view of Cades Cove (which my wife and I had camped at in our camper over the past weekend).  I need to work on venting my tent to bring condensation down, but other than that a successful hike.",,View Entry,"Nov 29, Tue",0

I averaged around 12 miles a day including hiking the AT back to Fontana Dam.   Great weather on the first two days then a nasty, cold and rainy day on the last day.   My gear held up well but didn’t get to test sleeping below 35 degrees on this trip.  I enjoyed the historical parts of the hike.  There was an old town of Proctor at Hazel creek.   You can only access it by boat or foot now.   There were all sorts of old abandoned cars mainly on the section between eagle creek and Fontana dam.",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Mon",0

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659784,"So, I started out on Big Creek Trail and hiked up Swallow Fork trail to Mt. Sterling Ridge Trail and camped at the Mt. Sterling fire tower campsite (#38).  Temperature was forecasted to get to 32 with a windchill in mid to low 20's.  I set up my tent to try to avoid the worst of the wind, but still had wind all night. This is the coldest I've camped in quite a while.   I stayed up on the fire tower for the sunset which was beautiful.   There was a full moon over the valley also.  Unfortunately, I allowed my self to get too cold while enjoying the sunset and then cooking dinner.   I forgot my hot chocolate at home which would have helped with the warmth.  I got into my tent, changed into my mid weight smart wools and got in the bag.  It's rated for 10 degrees and down.  It usually does the trick pretty quickly but it took a long time to get warm this time.   Part of the problem was that when I zipped my tent fly closed I pulled on the wrong zipper and left a big gap for the wind to get through.   I was shivering while doing this and I think I made poor decisions.  Normally I would've noticed that.   I noticed it after a few hours of trying to warm up.  I wasn't shivering any more, but wasn't comfortable.   I noticed  I could see stars through the fly and my brain finally figured out what I had done.   I corrected the mistake and then cinched up the hood on my bag tighter.  I quickly warmed up and was warm for the rest of the night.   I believe it was colder than the forecast because my water bottle was partially frozen (inside the tent) and my water bladder was worse (in the vestibule).  I bought a thermometer from Amazon and will take it on my next hike so I will know the actual temperature.  The next morning I warmed my hiking clothes up in the sleeping  bag and broke camp.   I was able to stay warm enough in the morning and my layers did well.   I then hiked back to Big Creek via the Baxter Trail.Lessons:  Need rain pants as a layer to keep warm over my smart wools in camp.  I currently use a rain skirt.  I ordered the pants from Anti Gravity Gear.  Need a Pillow for better sleeping.  (Ordered from Backcountry.com)  I've had my Western Mountaineering sleeping bag over filled with down (3 oz).  They say it should get my to a 5 degree bag.  The bag I used for this trip was my wife's while mine was sent away.  Everything is harder to do when cold.   I have a lot of experience backpacking on the AT, just very little in cold weather.  Most of my cold weather camping has been either spring break or training for my upcoming thru-hike.  I need to work on my food bag choices and campsite selection for wind.  I am planning shake down hikes throughout January and early February to build endurance and experience with cold weather camping.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Thu",0
Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659837,"I hiked up Big Creek trail in the Smokies and took Camel Gap trail to the AT and camped at Cosby Knob Shelter.  I had new tyvek that my good friend Bill gave me.   Bill was the School Resource Officer of one of the schools I taught music in.   It made a tremendous difference.  My old tyvek was well....old and I had washed it.   I'm not sure if the washing or if it's age had caused it to lose its effectiveness.   I will say that the new tyvek transferred the moisture out of my tent to the ground.  At Mt. Sterling and the old tyvek, the tyvek was frozen.   It was colder at Cosby Knob and underneath the tyvek was wet while the rest of the ground was frozen.   It was 40 degrees inside the tent and 20 degrees outside (per my thermometer).  I was able to stay toasty in my bag and my gear kept me relatively warm while I cooked breakfast.The second day took me south on the AT to Balsam Mountain trail.   I followed it down to Laurel Gap shelter.   It was the longest day with a backpack in a while.  13.9 miles.  My legs and feet held up well, although I arrived at the shelter with only a 1/2 hour of daylight left.  The only good camping spot had widow makers above it and it was windy....so I stayed in the shelter.  Temps got down to 28 degrees and my bag held up fine without the tent.   My pad slid a lot on the tyvek.  I tried putting a shirt under the pad but I kept sliding.   Not sure how to fix that.   While my plan is to avoid shelters, there will be times when shelters are necessary.   I originally planned this as a five day hike but I got a text from Bill saying conditions for Thursday and Friday had changed.   It was supposed to be light rain and possibly light snow.   It changed to heavy rain and wind on Thursday with temps dropping Thursday night to the low 20's.   Friday was supposed to have more snow.  My Fifth day had two streams I had to ford and I didn't want to face the fords with heavy rain.   There was an alternate way to the car, but that would have kept me at a high elevation for much longer in the day.   I decided to hike out on the third day instead.The third day took my down the Gunter Fork trail.   I didn't know this until I hiked it, but there had been a landslide on part of the trail (still passable) but also a lot of erosion on the side of the trail with steep mountain side below me.   That slowed me down greatly for the 4.1 miles.   Instead of 2 crossings,  I had to put my water shoes on four times to cross Gunter Fork creek and then Big Creek.   My feet got pretty cold.   I had to strip down to just underwear and a top to ford Big Creek.   The water came up about a foot above my knees.   The crossings were successful, but I'm not sure how I would have tolerated both cold water and below freezing air if I'd hiked it Friday.  The lower portion of Gunter fork is in ok condition and the falls are worth the walk from Camel Gap/Big Creek trails.   Be careful of the fords though.   When I got home, the forecast changed again from light snow to 3.5 inches before sunrise and 6 to 8 more inches during the day.  Even more Friday night.   I got a text Thursday from GSMNP backcountry office informing me of the forecast.   Overall, I think I made a good decision to hop off the trail early.Much nicer hike in general.   I need to work on learning how to sleep while camping again.   I'm not bothered being alone in the woods.   It's more sore legs and being in a mummy bag.  I'm hoping my new pillow will add to my comfort and allow me to sleep better.   I am still tweaking my food bag, not happy with it yet, but it's a work in progress.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660119,"I have been working on replacing a section of my deck at home for the past 3 weeks (Thanks for all the help Bill).   I've done very little training but was able to get out for a nice 4 day hike in the Smokies.   I started at Mt. Sterling Gap and hiked the long bunk trail to the Little Cataloochee trail and camped at Campsite #39.   It was tough getting back on the trail after so many weeks of not training, but I got to camp and used two new items.  I bought a Deuce trowel from tent lab.  it is light and works great.  I had tried using my hiking poles to dig with to save weight but I could never get deep enough.  I used this trowel for poo, but also to bury any grey water and when I brushed my teeth.  Much easier and worth the less than 1/2 ounce.  I also used a pillow this trip, Sea to Summit Aeros premium pillow at 2.8 ounces.  I slept much better on this trip, not quite as good as home yet, but much better.  The worst sleeping night was at Laurel Gap Shelter.
The most interesting thing on this trip was that I was stalked by a large group of wild hogs.  I was at the junction of Balsam Mt. Trail and Balsam Mt. Road having a snack before walking the closed for season road to the Palmer Creek trail.  As I was eating my chips I kept hearing what sounded like large animals moving in the distance.  I thought they were deer at this time of year.  They kept getting closer so I stood up and turned around to look.   About 100 yards off I saw six large wild hogs coming toward me.  I yelled and hit my hiking  sticks like I do when I see a bear too close.  They all squealed and turned tail and ran away.  But off to my left about 3 to 4 more large hogs ran and with them 6 to 8 smaller pigs.   It's the most pigs in the Smokies I have ever seen.   After I watched them go over the mountain I sat down to eat again.   About 10 minutes later I had this odd feeling, then I heard a pig snort close to me.  I jumped up and yelled again and a large pig had returned and was 20 yards from me.  He ran away and I packed up and walked down the road.  I didn't see any more pigs on the trip.  I reported the large group to the back country office for the Smokies.  They are an invasive species and the park hunts them.
Everything except my food worked well on this hike.   I've decided to take my alcohol stove on my thru hike instead of my canister stove to save 7 ounces and not carry chicken and noodles/rice for my dinner.  I couldn't stomach the food on any of my shake down hikes.  I am either going to eat oatmeal in the evening with hot chocolate or something else light.  My body can only eat so much after hiking all day.  I figure that may change over time, but it is what I am going to start with.   I am adding beef jerky and nuts for protein.   
I start my hike two weeks from tomorrow.  I feel good about my gear and plan.   Good ideas for food, but it will be tweaked.  I am going to walk my mountain at home over the next two weeks and take as may day hikes as I can manage.  My next entry will either be from Amicolola Falls, or after I have hiked the trail for a few days and have enough signal to update.  Thanks for following my pre-hike journal and I'll talk next from the AT.",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Sat",0

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660311,"Today I started at Amicalola Falls campground, cooking breakfast of eggs and bacon. Mary and I drove to Springer Mountain trail head. We hiked southbound to the summit of Springer and then back to the car. I kissed Mary bye and begin my trip northbound on the Appalachian Trail.
I saw all sorts of people in the beginning, but after a while, I hiked mostly by myself. Right before I was beginning to climb Sassafras Mountain I ran into a trail angel. He offered me water and a tootsie roll pop. I met a through hiker there called First Grader. He is from Michigan and is a retired first grade teacher. I left him at the gap and hiked up Sassafras. This was at the end of a long day for me. It was a tough climb, but I was able to do it.
At the bottom of Sassafras, I took a snack break. I had 2 miles left to camp. First grader stopped where I was having snack we began a conversation and hiked together most of the 2 miles to camp.  He quoted Mike Tyson saying everything goes to plan until the first punch to the face. I hadn’t told him my name was Michael Tyson yet. The 2 miles flew by as we talked and then we traded contact information and he hiked on to Gooch gap shelter.
I set up camp and got water for the evening. The tough part came when I was trying to hang my bear bag. It was a fiasco.  I had practiced well and thought I was prepared. I couldn’t find a proper tree and fouled up my line. It took forever to untangle. I finally got it untangled and hung my bear bag. 
Overall, it was a great first day hopefully tomorrow the bear bag hanging will go better.","Springer Mountain

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660340,"I woke up early before sunrise because I was able to get to sleep early last night.  I expected rain, but it didn't come in the morning.  I hiked a few miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter and had breakfast.  I saw a few hikers there including Turtle Tracks from Greenville, NC.  I continued north and later in the morning the rain began.  At first it was light and variable, then it became windy with steady rain.  I ate lunch at Woody Gap under a small National Forest board with a small overhang.  I then entered Blood Mountain wilderness.  The trail was mud but the rain became less of a nuisance as the day progressed.  I ran into a South Bound hiker who was finishing his hike (Mayor).  He said that most people were moving on to Neels Gap and that there probably wouldn't be many people at Blood Mountain Shelter and it would be a good sunrise tomorrow.  While it was further than I had planned, I thought it would make my next day .8 miles shorter and the climb over Blood Mountain would be done.  I decided to go for it.  The shelter is dry (no water) so I carried up 3 liters of water to the top, hiking through heavy wind and fog, but little rain.  I got to the shelter which is an enclosed old two room hut and there were five people there.  Six including me.  I got my bear bag up (on the first try) and then picked out a spot to sleep.  One room was completely wet through a windowless opening and a doorless opening.   One hiker already had the driest spot.  The other room had four people in with the only space underneath a window that was covered with tyvek.
The tyvek was held down with two very heavy rocks on beams above the window and the bottom of the tyvek had 5 very heavy rocks holding it down.  All through the night the wind was blowing the tyvek in a few inches and pulling it out a few inches but it seemed like it would stay.  Unfortunately, it became more windy in the night and blew the heavy bottom rocks off of the ledge and very close to me.  My phone was beside me and one of the rocks hit my phone and it wouldn't work any more.  There was a big crack down the center of the screen and the screen was black.  I had planned on using my ear buds as ear plugs with music but without my phone that wouldn't work.  I got very little sleep.
The next morning one of the hikers allowed me to use his phone and I called Mary for a pick up to repair or replace my phone.  More tomorrow.","Justice Creek

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660341,"After using a fellow hikers phone to call Mary I began my descent of Blood Mountain.  The wind had dried a lot of the rocks so it wasn't as slick as I expected.   There was a lot of mud though.  I had a great hike down to Neels Gap and the Outfitters of Mountain Crossing.  I picked up my supply drop and talked to a worker about my leaky fuel bottle (a mess) and he recommended a coke bottle.  I will try that when I carry my stove after Dicks Creek.  
Mary arrived quickly after that and we drove to the Mall of Georgia to the Apple store.  We had to wait 2 1/2 hours to get an appointment for them to look at my phone.  They felt it was fixable, but it took 3 hours for them to get to the phone after that.  We ate at the Cheese Cake Factory, walked around the mall, talked and mainly waited for them to fix the phone.  They finally got it fixed, they said it was only the screen.  I don't know if it was a glancing blow from the rock, or if the case protected it, but I am grateful to have my phone fixed.  I use it for so much, especially navigation on the trail.  Also an important safety tool.  
I am at home overnight.  Wednesday night, Thursday and Friday looks like heavy rain and warmish temperatures.  Difficult to cook in unless I am at a shelter, which I am not planning on being at.  I've decided to leave the stove at home for the next few days.   I will resupply at Dicks Creek and overnight at home.   I will reassess if I am going to pick up my stove then.
Mary has been a lifesaver and of course the love of my life.","Blood Mountain Shelter

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660355,"Today, started at home with me saying bye to Mary. My brother-in-law Will drove me to Chick-fil-A for breakfast and then on to Neels gap.
After I stretched, I started to put my pack on and the pack whisper from mountain crossings happened to be outside and saw me. He came over to me and helped to fit my pack. I had been wearing it too low on my hips and he show me how to properly wear it and tighten the straps And it made a huge difference as I walked today. This is a new pack for me and it always felt weird on my hips. Now I know why. I moved the hip belt this evening per his instruction.  That should make even more of a difference.


A couple of miles past Neels gap I ran across a group of day hikers who had a lost dog. Later in the morning I ran into another hiker who had seen the dog at the gap ahead. I called Mountain Crossing and told them about the dog and where it was. My hope was the day hikers would talk to the people at Mountain crossings. As I got to the gap I ran into a lady hiker. It was waiting on someone to pick her up. I told her about the people looking for the dog. She was concerned that they wouldn’t come and decided to take the dog to the vet hoping it was chipped. I hope everything works out it is a beautiful and pleasant dog.


After Hogpen gap, I ran across a reroute of the Appalachian trail. I realize it’s a reroute, because there was freshly made Trail, orange strips, tied on trees to mark the route and no white blazes. I saw a woman looking on her GPS as I hiked by her. That’s when I started looking for white blazers and couldn’t find them at the end of the reroute. I saw where it joined the old Appalachian Trail. The old trail had logs over it to keep people from walking down it. Hopefully they will blaze it soon. I recognized it as a reroute, but new hikers may not.


I’ve set up my camp. My bear bag is hung. And now it is time for relaxation and bed.","Neels Gap

There were thunderstorms last night with lots of rain.   The tent held up pretty well, but got lots of mud on the corners.  
I walked in a light drizzle to light rain all day.   Everything seem to go very slowly and it was difficult to make my miles today.   At the end of the hike, I was wet, cold, and muddy.   I am now in my tent, warming up and getting well needed rest. Hopefully I will sleep better tonight.


Tomorrow promises to be a lot more rain up to 2 inches. Fortunately I have about 11 miles to get to Dick’s Creek gap.  I will go home from there and resupply, wash my clothes and myself, and go back to the trail the next day.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660408,"I slept really well last night in my tent.  It helped me a lot as I hiked today.  My tent got pretty wet last night and was even worse once I packed it up.  My tent site selection had a few issues and I got some water under the tent.  It didn't affect my sleeping and all my camp clothes and down gear stayed dry.There had been a lot of rain over the past two days and it was still raining.  This made the trail very muddy and slippery.  I fell walking back to AT from the shelter.  I didn't fall anymore on today's hike, but I was slipping and sliding on all the down hills.  I could see the skid marks from hikers who were in front of me.  My attitude today was good, even though it was wet and muddy.   I made reasonable time today.  The hardest part was because cold rain made my tendons to tighten which led to hurting feet and tight hamstrings.   There is an old saying on the Appalachian Trail:  ""No Rain, No Pain, No Maine"".  To anyone reading who doesn't know much about the AT it basically means if you can't deal with rain and pain, you can't make it to the end of the trail (Maine).  The pain wasn't to bad, but out of the six days hiking so far it has rained 3 days.I got to Dick's Creek Gap around 2:45 and saw two hikers underneath the overhang of the forest service map.  I recognized one of the hikers from last night.  I can't remember his name, but it starts with Frozen.  He is a retired pediatrician.  Since I had dropped my car at Dick's Creek earlier in the week, I offered them a ride.  I took frozen to the hostel around the bend and the other hiker to Clayton.I went to Ingles for a quick resupply and then home.  Mary helped me wash all my gear and clothes.  I then washed myself.  It is amazing how much mud I accumulated.  We built a fire and are now taking a much needed rest.  I have to let everything dry so I will pack in the morning.  I go back out tomorrow morning.","Tray mountain shelter

When we got Dick's Creek gap, there were a lot of people there.  I started my trip back on the AT.  The hike went well and the day was very pretty weather wise.  I crossed over my first state line into North Carolina.  I have a photo of the crossing, but for some reason I can't upload it.  The climb into North Carolina was very steep.  Still, I made good time to the shelter.  I have never seen so many people in one place on the Appalachian Trail.  They must've been 30 people at the shelter and in tents surrounding the shelter.  I decided to hike on about 2 miles and set up camp.  There are 3 tents here including mine.  The hikers are Cruiz and Mr. Maps.

Toward the end of my hike today I had to climb Jacobs ladder. This was an assent of about 700 feet and .6 miles. I remember this section for my other hiking trips. It was very steep until I got to near the top where is starting to switch back. Then I had to descend to the shelter where I met another through hiker.


Tomorrow I will reach Fontana dam and the edge of the great smoky mountain national park.  Mary and I are getting hotel so I can resupply and not have a long trip home and then have five days to hike through the park.

I made good time the first half of the day and stopped at Cable gap shelter. When Mary and I were a section hiking for our honeymoon, we spent our last night there.
The climb out of Cable gap shelter, started off OK but it times was steep with eroded trail. There was one time I thought I had lost the trail. I didn’t see a blaze for quite a while, and the trail did not look well traveled.  Fortunately, it was the trail just poorly marked.

The trail was well graded and I made decent time climbing the nearly 2200 foot mountain.  I took the side trail up to Shuckstack and saw the chimney from the old fire warder's cabin.  There was no view due to the fog and rain.  I continued my hike and saw more hikers than I thought I would in such poor conditions.  I saw 2 sets of 2 non-thru hikers out for a few days.  I also saw the two brothers Enguard and I think the other brother is Frestarter.  I've been seeing them for the past few days.  I also saw Treebeard who was waiting on his brother Conductor.  Conductor is making his thru-hike being over 70 years old.  Treebeard is in a similar age, but younger.  The rain slowed down, but I noticed a temperature shift and almost swore I saw snow mixed in with the rain, but eventually the rain/snow mix stopped as I arrived at Russell Field.  The shelter was full of people (so much for the horrible weather making the trail and shelter less crowded).  They have a tarp over the front of the shelter like they used to in the Smokies during Winter.  They haven't been doing this because of Covid.  Later shelters this week won't have the tarp.  I decided to tent because the forecast is for the rain to go away, but be very cold.  A better hike today than I expected.Peace!","Fontana visitor’s center

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660852,"After a nice night's sleep I woke up and opened my tent flap.  There was snow all over the ground.  It wasn't deep snow, maybe and inch or so.  I tried to throw my tent fly flap back like I always do and it wouldn't flip.  My entire tent fly was frozen with thick ice.  The temp was around 22.  I crawled out and got my pack and food down from the bear cables and took it into the shelter.  Most everyone was getting ready.  My pack was completely frozen with snow and ice.  I had hung my pack because of Smokies regulations but won't be doing that any more in these conditions.  I spent quite a bit of time getting as much ice and snow off my pack and preparing breakfast to warm up.  I then had to pack my pack and take down my tent.  While packing my sleeping bag my stuff sack ripped the top off and was no longer completely water proof. I put my camp shirt over the end that was ripped and put the sleeping bag in my trash bag I use as secondary water protection.  Since I was several days before I could get it replaced I hope it stays dry.  It is my last, best protection from cold.  I got a lot of the ice off my tent fly, but it still had remnants of ice that I couldn't remove.  It took a long time to get out of camp.  I didn't start walking until 9:30 AM.  
The trail was slick and there was quite a bit of climbing today.  My pace was super slow compared to what I usually hike and while it was pretty, the temperature never warmed up.  I would guess it was in the mid 20's with a steady wind of 15 to 20 miles and hour with higher gusts.  The only time I was out of the wind was where the wind was blocked by which side of a mountain I was on.  The wind chill made the temperature feel like the low teens.  I couldn't make very much headway and arrived at Derrick Knob Shelter around 4:00 PM.  I had 3 1/2 hours of daylight left but would have to hike 5.7 miles.  I originally had planned to hike to the shelter after that for the day.  Normally, I could have hiked fast enough to make it to the next shelter.  Today's pace with cold and snow and don't think I could have made it to the next shelter.  I decided to stay at Derrick Knob and change my goal to get through the Smokies in five days.  
I set up in the shelter and Treebeard and then Conductor arrived and set up also.  I couldn't set up my tent because it was still frozen.  I made hot chocolate and oatmeal for dinner, hung my bear bag only this time and got in my bag around 5:30 PM.  I stayed in my bag for the rest of the day and night.  The temperature got down to 15 degrees.  My bag held up well, but I could feel wind through the shelter at night.  I am guessing but maybe 5 MPH or so.  That would make a wind chill on my bag about 7 degrees.  I had to wear my down jacket in the bag in the middle of the night.  I didn't really sleep trying to stay warm.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660853,"It was 15 degrees when I finally got out of my sleeping bag.  I quickly changed into my hiking clothes (15 degrees and partially naked while changing isn't for the faint of heart).  I had poured the water out of my platypus (water storage container I use to carry more than a liter of water) so I had to travel down to the spring again to get more water.  My nalgene bottle was partially frozen and the cap was difficult to get off, but I hit the cap on a tree to knock loose some of the ice.  I made breakfast and packed up quickly.  I still got out of camp at 8:30 AM and I usually like to start hiking around 8AM or as close to dawn as I can.  Making this happen in cold is difficult.  I had to climb over Clingman Dome today.  Clingman Dome is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail.  I don't know how much it warmed up, but it didn't feel like much and it was even more windy today.  I would guess that with windchill I was hiking in what felt like from 5 degrees to -1 degrees depending on how much wind was hitting me.
I made better time today with a better graded trail.  While there  was more snow in places the higher I got, sometimes the snow had been blown off the trail.  While there was ice in places it wasn't too bad until I got near Clingman Dome.  I stopped at Siler Bald Shelter and then at Double Spring Shelter to get out of the wind and eat more.  I noticed that yesterday I couldn't stop to eat and drink much so my body wouldn't perform well in the harsh conditions. I did have problems with my Nalgene today.  The cap kept freezing and making it difficult to open to drink water.  Once I got it open it froze quickly and made it difficult to get the cap back on.  All of this took time.
I finally got up to Clingman Dome and it was too fogged in to go up the tower, but I saw lots of snow in the fir trees.  Although the conditions were truly horrible, it was also beautiful.  I saw several groups of college students who were hiking with backpacks up here.  I was surprised that any one who wasn't a thru-hiker was out in these conditions, but it was their first day (I could tell by the condition of their clothes) and I hope they were prepared for how cold it was going to get.  I continued over the Dome and ran into a lot of ice.  In places the trail looked like a river of ice with light snow covering it.  I put on my microspikes and  continued.  At places the snow was deeper it depended on if the trail was out of wind or not.  I arrived at the trail which lead to the shelter.  Mount Collins shelter was 1/2 mile off the AT which is a long way for the Appalachian Trial.  I usually go to shelters which are only .1 or .2 off the trail.  
I arrived at the shelter and set up around 5:30 PM  It was down to 15 degrees again which meant the later part of the day I had been hiking in what felt like -5 degrees.  There was a light breeze entering the shelter on my left side that I couldn't avoid.  I got my bag set up and then worked hard to open my nalgene.  I hadn't drunk much in the afternoon because of I was afraid I couldn't get my water bottle closed again.  It was mostly ice and water chunks, but I heated it up and had hot chocolate.  Normally I would drink water in the night but It was supposed to get colder and I didn't think I would be able to get it open.  I drank what water I could and tried to empty the bottle of ice.  I got into my bag around 6 PM.  Tree beard and his brother arrived and made camp also.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660854,"I had lots of difficulty staying warm in the night.  I'm not sure how to explain this but to say while I wasn't freezing cold, I had to work to stay warm.  I couldn't quite get comfortable, but I wasn't miserable.  My breath was freezing when it left my mouth and getting the top of my bag near my mouth frozen.  My pee bottle even froze during the night.  My apple watch said I slept some, but I don't remember loosing consciousness during the night.  Before I got out of my bag the temperature said 10 degrees.  My bag is rated for 10 degrees.  I had it overfilled with 3 ounces of down which was supposed to get it rated to 5 degrees.  With wind chill I would guess the temperature in the shelter felt like 1 degree.
I kept my thicker camp clothes on because of how cold it was and put on my frozen boots.  My boots have been frozen blocks of ice every morning in the Smokies.  I had read about this happening in other journals so I made sure my boots were as open and loose as I could make them before going to bed.  I didn't have any water  so I dry swallowed my Blood Pressure medicine and quickly packed up with only nuts and a few skittles for breakfast.  It was still twilight just before dawn when I started my hike to get back to the AT.  
I arrived on the AT and headed North.  While there was still a lot of snow and ice and my elevation, I had no idea what it was like at Newfound Gap and the road.  Sometimes the park closes the road for ice so I have been nervous about that.  Fortunately, after about an hour of walking I started running into day hikers and new the road was open.  The lower in elevation I got the warmer I got and less snow.  By the time I reached Newfound Gap it was still cold and some wind, but no comparison to what I have endured.  I got their about 10:15 AM and was picked up by Will.  I got warm in the car and we ate and I came home for a few zero days.
I thought I would reflect on the past four days of hiking in the Smokies.  While the snow and ice slowed me down, I think it was the toll on my body of the cold temperatures that affected me most.  Unless you have experienced it, exerting lots of energy hiking and trying to stay warm in temperatures that are in the low 20's approaching to feeling like close to zero really has a great effect on your body.  One day and night enduring being wet during the day was one thing.  A cumulative of 4 days of bitter, unrelenting cold is different.  I had the gear to survive it, but it has completely zapped my body of energy.  I used it to do what I had to do.  I listened to my body and did what I needed to do to get through.  I will go out again after resting and continue.  If I was further away from home I would be doing this in a hotel with a shuttle to and from the trail.  I have been blessed to be close enough to home not to have to pay the price for that.  I have wondered if I would truly experience winter on my thru-hike after all the warm, wet weather in Georgia.  Winter struck back for these four days and may strike again before Spring is over.

He retired the same month that Mary went into Marine Corps Boot Camp.
After all that, we went to Arlington House.  This was the home of Robert E Lee and his wife, Mary Custis Lee.   They lost the house when Robert E Lee joined the confederacy instead of the union.  It was interesting seeing how close his house was to our nation’s capitol. The photo for today’s journal is from the front yard of the house.  
We spent so much time at Arlington cemetery and Arlington house that we decided to call it a day. We are getting lots of miles in, but it’s mostly flat with no backpack.   The concrete and speed of our walking is the challenge. I am hoping I don’t lose my trail legs during this week.

I then descended for 6/10 of a mile.   After that, I began the second stage of the climb.   This was over 2100 feet.   It was very rocky and steep.   By the time I reached the top I was exhausted.  I think high mileage days combined with this nasty climb caught up with me.   I  rested at the top, and then began the descent of Three Ridges.  It was steep and very rocky.   It took longer than usual to hike the miles to this point.  I still wanted to get to Waynesboro tomorrow.   That meant I had to hike about 7.3 more miles.   The profile did not look bad for the miles.  Unfortunately, most of them was very rocky.I caught my second wind after a while.  As I hiked, I noticed all the green and poison ivy around all the trees.  This was not conducive for me putting up my hammock.   I got to the place I had planned to camp.  There was so much poison ivy I couldn’t do it.    There was a stealth camp 7/10 of a mile further north that is where I ended up.   I got to camp about 20 minutes before sundown.   It wasn’t easy finding a spot to set my hammock up but I picked two trees and gave it a try. No matter what I did the hammock would not set up correctly.   The only thing I can figure is that one of the trees that I had chosen was too small in diameter.   After trying for 30 to 40 minutes to fix the hammock, I changed trees.   Fortunately, that worked.  After my shelter was put up I was able to eat about 8:45 PM.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664186,"So I want to start with that I am safe and dry.   Considering all the things that went wrong today that’s a good thing.


I started the day having a good nights sleep. The stumble inn hostel is a very Zen place.  My shuttle driver picked me up again.  As he drove he missed a turn.   That led to us passing by Dunkin’ Donuts and I got a latte and donut.   So far so good.


I started hiking north and while I had climbs, they weren’t too bad.  Then came the roller coaster.   It was very rocky, and the climbs were steep most of the time.     The rock slowed me down in a major way today.  


I had hoped to stop by Bear’s Den hostel.   It is only 1/10 of a mile of the trail and I wanted ice cream.  Unfortunately for the time I reached the side trail. It was late in the day.   I wouldn’t be able to get through the roller coaster and go to the hostel.  I was tempted to stay there.   Unfortunately, it would be too far from there to make it to Harpers Ferry tomorrow.   I decided to hike on.There was a 50% chance of rain storms today. They started close to Bear’s Den hostel.  It was a light rain and I didn’t get to wet.  I felt pretty lucky.   I crossed over a major highway and was within 4 miles of my planned camping spot.   The rain started again.   At first it was light, then a little heavier.   Then it became a torrential downpour.  It rained for a very long time.  As I hiked in this downpour I saw lots of day hikers rushing back to the cars.  They were soaked without rain gear.  Most were wearing cotton.    I felt bad for them.This rainstorm was a big deal because I have lost my pack cover.  I worried that as hard and long it rained that my down gear might not be useable.   It was protected in a stuff sack that was wrapped in an unscented plastic trash bag.  My camp clothes were inside the plastic trash bag also.   I had to wait until camp to find out if my gear was dry.  By then, if it wasn’t, it would be too late.


I got water from the spring 7/10 of a mile below my campsite.   I had one last climb to make.   For whatever reason they decided to have a nice easy switch back climb.  I had to carry a lot of water because it is 10 miles to the next water source that isn’t far off the trail.  It was getting dark as I made the ascent.  


I was determined to not let the roller coaster beat me.   As soon as I passed the sign saying I was through the roller coaster, I found a camping spot.   I set up my camp.  All, but one corner of my top quilt was completely dry. The corner was slightly damp.   My under quilt was completely dry.   My camp clothes were completely dry.  With how hard it rained it is almost a miracle.


Today had two milestones. The first was completing the roller coaster.   The biggest milestone was passing over the 1000 mile mark.  While the picture for today is the roller coaster sign, the 1000 mile mark photo is downloaded to Trail Journals also.  


While today was a very hard day, I feel good about what I accomplished.  I’m glad to be safe and warm.

 it seems a lot of people on the trail are aware of what happened to him.   


I stayed for a while to let my food settle, then I hiked on.  The trail passes through the Cumberland Valley.   This section is relatively flat for about 14 miles.  The trail passes through a lot of farm land.  A good amount of the trail has tree cover.  There were parts that were open fields, though.   That section was very hot.   
Since it’s Memorial Day weekend, there were lots of people out.   Some were day hiking and some were backpacking.

I started this morning, walking through a wildlife preserve and boardwalk.  I saw a black bird with an orange pack, sitting on a stalk of grass.  His neck puffed up then he opened his beak and sang.   I’ve never seen a bird sing before.   It was mesmerizing.    A little later on the boardwalk I heard a large animal rustling in the grass.   I looked and saw my first bear of this hike.  I saw his black tail and the telltale bear ears.  He walked off of ways then turned and looked at me.  He was behind grass and all I could see was his eyes, muzzle, and ears.   I said “hello bear“. He then turned and walked out of sight.   


Later in the hike, I came across NJ  94– Vernon.   Heaven Hill Farm just west of the road has a store with small pies another hiker treats.  I had a small apple pie, an apple cider doughnut with ginger apple beer.   It was awesome.  


I’ve then climbed the stairway to heaven.  It was steep and rocky but then leveled out at the top.  The second highlight of the day after the bear, was completing New Jersey and walking into New York.  I’ve now completed 8 of the 14 states on the Appalachian Trail.  
The 1st mile or two of New York followed, rocky, outcrops. It was slow going, and I really had to concentrate to navigate my way.   It was not blazed very well.  In foggy or misty weather, it would be very difficult to follow the trail.   There are places it would be dangerous in rain.  I saw my first set of rebar ladders on this hike.  It was similar to Maine without a severe elevation loss and gain.   There was a 90% chance of rain today.   Fortunately for me it started raining just after I got off the trail.

I think he thought I was going to give him food.   He started to walk toward me.  I said “hey bear!”   The bear decided to walk a little bit further away from me.   He sat down and pick up something someone had left with his paws and started to eat it.  It was an amazing moment. I continue hiking on until I reached the reroute.   They decided to reroute the Appalachian Trail because someone had gotten killed on the Palisades Road.    In at about 1.5 miles.   I took a break and then started the reroute.   The first part of the reroute was fairly level trail.   It was well marked and I had no problems following it.  After I crossed over the Palisades Road on a pedestrian bridge I got water at the Anthony Wayne recreation area.   It was about 2/10 off the trail.   This is where things got a little dicey.    It started to rain. It then started to thunder.   The last for the reroute is very exposed on a rock out crop.  By the time I got there, I was in the middle of the thunderstorm.   If I had known it was so exposed, I could’ve continued on with Fawn trail which the reroute left to take me up exposed place.  It was shaved a half a mile of the AT but it was at a lower elevation and would have been safer.  I would recommend if anyone is in a thunderstorm on the reroute to take Fawn to the AT as a bad weather route.  The only thing you would miss is a view of the Hudson Valley.  I continued hiking in the storm abated.   A little later I start to climb Bear Mountain.   They were some beautiful views, and I enjoyed hiking there.   The descent from bear mountain was well done.   When I got down to the lake, everything had closed.   I had to take the blue blaze around the Trail side zoo because it was closed.   The blue blaze then becomes the official Appalachian Trail.   I crossed Bear Mountain Bridge then climbed Anthony’s Nose.   I finally got to the road crossing without getting rained on anymore.  A long a good day.Peace!","Arden Valley Road

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665720,"(S)One of the things that I have noticed recently is how loud the forest is with birds.   Birds sing all the time and there are many different types of birds.    When I have section hiked the trail before I always had earbuds and listening to music.   This hike I have not, at least not so far.  This is changed my perception of the trail.  The morning part of my hike was smooth and quick.  The only downside was that after the pasture it wasn’t well-maintained.   The grass was high and there was lots of overhanging limbs.  This made for a wet morning hike.   When I crossed into Connecticut, there were several welcome to Connecticut signs. The trail went in and out of New York at least twice more. I have used the photo from the last crossing.   I have finished nine states I have five more to go, including Connecticut.At the top of 10 mile hill, I checked my phone to make sure everything Was OK.  The act of doing that reminded me of when Mary and I hiked and did the same thing.   That is when we found out a beloved cat lady had died.  This pulled us off the trail.   As I looked around, I could vividly remember everything that happened.   After hiking down to 10 mile river, I crossed over and hiked up to the road.   That is the last place that Mary and I had gotten into on our section hike.   Everything after that was hiked 18 years ago.The second half of the day had a few more climbs and some descents.   I’m not sure if I was tired or if they were harder but it slowed me down.  I am now in camp and relaxing.  Peace!","NY22

Today was a tougher day than the last few days.  I think part of the reason why I didn’t get good sleep last night.  Another is that the ups and downs seem to be steep even though relatively short.  The descent from St. John’s ledges felt especially steep. 
After this dissent is a very nice walk along the river for almost 5 miles.  It is relatively flat and pleasant.   It may be a little bit buggy, so be prepared.  
After this nice walk, the returns to the steep ups and downs.  
I saw several thru hikers today and some section hikers.  Two of the section hikers I saw today were teachers.  One was from Connecticut, and the other from Florida.   They are boy head friends, hiking the AT in Connecticut.   
We are camping in a state park in New York State.   It is relatively close to the trail and they have a very nice shower.    Time to rust.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665860,"(S)The day started with a climb up the lions head, and then Bear Mountain.   The climbs are not bad, and I was making good time.  Bear mountain is the highest point in Connecticut.   There was a big rock monument at the top.   The descent off of Bear Mountain was steep.   There were a couple times I had to sit down and use the slide method to get down a rock face.


Before long, I came to the Connecticut Massachusetts border.      They’ve put up a new sign that is accurate.  I have not completed 10 out of 14 states.      I took a good break and went online.   I saw that a bear had gone onto my back porch at home.    Will was very excited.   
From here I climbed Mount Race.      It was a steady Climb that had great views.   It was after this that things went South for me.    The descent off of mount Race was worse than Bear Mountain.   The descents were taking a lot of my time.  


I then ascended Mount Everett.   Far out says it is a grueling climb in both directions.    There were boards bolted into the rock to make steps.   I think that was mainly for the south bounders.   I finally reached the summit and took a break.  The descent of Mount Everett initially wasn’t bad.   It seemed the closer I got to Jug End the worse the descent became.   The descent of Jug End at times is like going down a lava waterfall that had hardened into stone.  None of the descents were impossible to do. They just took a lot of time.  
Once I got off the mountain, I was walking through a pasture and saw a large cat.  I think it may have been a lynx. 
I started this slack pack at 6:50 AM.   I ended at 8 PM.   I am slow, but this is a new record for me.
I am very tired and when I get back to camp, I’m going to shower and go to bed.

Today was a very nice day, hiking. It is probably one of my better days in recent memory.   The rain that was forecasted in the afternoon waited until I got off the trail.  Yesterdays hike ended in a spruce for forest.   Today’s hike began the same way.   That spruce scent is one of my favorite scents in the woods.  


For about 10 miles the hike was level (ish) to downhill.  The climb out of Dalton was mostly were graded.   I had hoped to stop at the ice cream shop in Dalton. It had not open yet when I arrived.   I got some pizza from the gas station and something to drink instead.


On the way to Cheshire, I ran into “K”.   He was at the ice cream shop that was closing in 30 minutes.   He asked if I was going to get ice cream but I said I was meeting Mary and didn’t want to get ice cream without her.  He is meeting his wife tomorrow and taking three days off.


Mary and I got ice cream not far from where we’re camping.  The storm is arriving thunder and lightning, but I am in the car dry.


Tomorrow is supposed to rain all day so I will get wet.  Today, however, was a great day.

I had one of the largest climbs today that I’ve had quite a while.      There was lots of water on the trail this morning from the past two days of rain.  The climb wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t too hard either. The higher I climbed the more it smelled like Christmas.  The spruce fir scent and the beautiful forest made the crime worthwhile.   I made decent time on the climb.   Before I knew it, I was close to the summit of Mount Greylock.   


Just below the summit is a pond with a well house.  I have a painting of that same pond from my previous section hike.  It is a very special place.  I stayed there for that and then climbed onto the top.  I had lunch in front of Lodge.  Unfortunately, it was closed and I couldn’t go in.   As I was having lunch, fog moved in.  It looks like a storm might be coming so I left the summit. This is where things became difficult for the day.  The trail from the summit was a very steep downhill.  It was not well marked all.   I stopped several times to try to make sure I was on the trail.  As I was looking at the FarOut app to make sure I was in the right place I heard a boom above my head.   I felt one drop, then several drops.   Before I could get my rain jacket out, the heavens opened up.  I was trying to protect my pack from getting soaked, get my rain jacket on, and get my rain skirt on.  I’m usually pretty good about weather,  but this took me by surprise. 


I continue on down the trail wondering if I’m in the right place and getting wet.   The trail was very muddy from previous rains, and I could not even see the trail at times for all the water.     I was slipping and sliding in the mud and trying to get away from the summit.  I finally got to a trail junction and saw a White blaze.  As I turned to continue following the trail I stepped ankle deep mud.   Fortunately, it did not go over my mid-top boot.   


My feet were completely soaked, and as I walked in bog bridges, some of which were underwater, I hit my head on a low angle tree.     I was focused on not falling off the bog bridge.   Fortunately, I was going to slow it didn’t knock me down.  


As I continued down the trail, it sounded like a creek with all the water running through the rocks.   I swear I heard the gecko from the Geico commercial as he was white water rafting down the trail.   It was a crazy descent.


It took forever to get down the trail, which is sad, because the morning had been such a good one.  I think I’m good whether it would not have been a bad descent.   With the mud and water it was absolutely crazy.


I am now in camp.  I am showered, fed and dry.   Tomorrow is another day.

I forgot to pack food wise today.   I stopped for my first break at Mad Tom Notch road.  I met at tramily (Trail family) that I just seen a bear.  They hiked on and I finished my snack.  The climb up styles peak, which had less elevation in Bromley was much more steep.  I’m not sure if it’s because I was tired or because I had already climbed Bromley but it was very difficult.   The descent of styles peak was even steeper.  I met the tramily again at the shelter.  Everyone was eating and I sat and ate also.  We all talked about the whites and our plans.  Once everyone had left the table and gone back to the shelter I started to put Band-Aids on my feet.   The rain has caused havoc with my little pinky toe.   Couches to Trail through hiker I had just met offered me some Luka tape.  It will stick to your feet better than Band-Aids, and is waterproof.   It worked very well.I hiked on to the next shelter where I saw couches again.  She offered me more tape in case Mary couldn’t find it in the store.   The kindness of people today made up for how tired I was, and how difficult the trail was.   On the way back to camp Ben & Jerry’s was open.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666333,"Mary and I had a conversation this morning about how unhappy I have been for a while.  It caused me to think a lot on today’s hike.  There have been lots of obstacles and problems lately.  My feet with blisters and all this rain.   While this has not helped me, it’s not the real culprit.   It is fear.  Fear that I am too slow, fear that I won’t be strong enough to hike the Whites in enough time to go home with Mary at the end of summer.  
While I am slow, I am strong.   I’ve always walked slower than everybody, whether on the mountain or at home.  As the old Bobby McFerrin song goes: “In every life we have some trouble, when we worry we make it double.  Don’t worry, be happy.”   I realized that worrying about what will happen just takes my joy.  It doesn’t solve any problems.  If I get to the whites and I can’t hike the schedule I want, I will try to use the extra days to still go home with Mary.  The worst thing that could happen is that I finish after Mary gets home.
This realization made today’s hike much better.  About 20 minutes after having this revelation, I put my foot on a log and fell hard.  I hit my left knee, my left hip, elbow, and then my left shoulder.   My boots were deep in mud.  As I lay there on the log I checked myself out and made sure I was OK.  I got up, brushed myself off, and continued hiking.  
I am going to fall, and when I do, I will get right back up.  Worrying about things won’t help.  
Even with the rain, today’s hike was very nice.  Little rock pond was beautiful.   The climbs were steady but not too difficult.  I also saw five grown men racing remote control four wheelers down the trail.  Not a boring day.

The climb up Holt’s Ledge was steep.  I think this has become the new normal.  On the north side of the mountain, I had several views of Smart mountain and its fire tower.  I will be crossing over this monster tomorrow.


We are at a campground near the Glencliff Trail crossing.  This is where I will come out in two days.   I will then have a zero day and begin the Whites.  


My pinky toe is losing its nail.  I think that this is part of the problem and why I was having so much pain.   Mary cut most of the dead part off.   We taped it up again.  It’s a lot better today even though there is still some pain.

When you climb up smarts mountain, you first go up Lamberts Ridge.  He walk along some rock cliffs once you reach the ridge then you ascend some more.  It then becomes steeper and you start going up Smarts mountain.     They added rebar to make steps going up the rock face.  At the top there is a fire tower, which is really cool.   There is also an old fire wardens cabin they use as a shelter.  There were several hikers climbing Smart’s mountain today.  I finally learned the name of a couple I’ve been seeing over the last five days.   The girls name is Sparks and she is from Ohio.  The man’s name is Stealth and he is from Germany.  


The descent off of Smart’s Mountain was gradual and nice.   I got water at the bottom, and then began to climb Mount Cube.  The first part up to the shelter was difficult but normal.   After the shelter it became very rocky.   With walks on ledges and rock faces.  I had to follow cairns to not lose my way.  I was very tired once I reached the top.  I was going to take a break, but it was threatening to storm.   I decided to get off the summit.   The trail maintainers have recently built a new trail here.  It was a very nice descent for about half a mile.  I could see where they were working on more trail but it wasn’t ready yet.    The current trail  was muddy, slick and slow.  


I reached Brackett brook and where I am camping.  The rain finally came as I was setting up camp.  It let up and I ate and stretched.  


I think one of the reasons I was so tired on the climbs was because it was taking so long to get up to the summit I was going past my typical break times.   This meant I didn’t have enough fuel in my body.  Since the trail here on out is  going to be difficult; I need to rethink my breaks and food.


Both of the major mountains I climbed today were beautiful.  They were well worth the work.

At the end of my hike, some nice ladies from New Hampshire and Maine were doing trail magic.  The one lady had already hiked the Appalachian Trail.   She highly recommended doing Moosilauke sobo.  The northside is very steep with ledges that are very dangerously slick in rain.  I may slack that mountain then have Mary shuttle me back to the north trailhead to continue on with my backpack that day.  They are forecasting lots of rain this week and that has me very concerned about above the tree line. 
Those ladies very nice and offered Mary a place to stay when we are in Monson Maine.  They also gave us a resupply advice about 100 mile wilderness.  I wealth of information.   I am currently 399.1 miles to Katahdin.
We ate at a local restaurant and came back to the camper.   It started raining hard and storming.  I feel for any campers out right now especially in the Highlands.   I am grateful to be indoors, warm and dry.  Knowing that I have a zero day tomorrow is priceless.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666672,"Today was a much needed rest day. It rained all day with the promise of a heavy storm tonight.  We have been under a flood watch for the last two days.  We ate at a place called Calamity Jane this morning.  The main talk of all the locals was about how much rain has been coming down recently and the flooding.  
Because of all this rain, I’ve decided to hike Moosilauke southbound as a slack pack.  Mary will then take me back north of Moosilauke and I will hike with my backpack for a few more miles to camp.  I have one big ford to make at the end of the slack pack.  I will check it in the morning to make sure I can get across in the afternoon.   
I was already apprehensive about the Whites.  It is supposed to rain all week with tomorrow and the next day not being as bad as today.  I will have to be flexible and see what the trail brings.  
As I was planning my hike out to Maine I realized that one of the slacks I did in my section hike was to a road that no longer is passable.  That means it will take an extra day to get through that section.   That will leave me two days of wiggle room to summit by August 17th.  I also have a zero day or two that I can cut if necessary.   
I don’t know what the next week or day will bring.  I have to take it one day at a time, but still plan for the future.   This is part of being on the trail.   I am unsure about cell signal through the whites.   I will post my Journals as I can.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666832,"I woke up early and got on the trail at 6:20 AM.  I wanted to beat any storms that might come and get over South Kinsman early.  I had to climb Mount Wolf right off the bat.   Like all of New Hampshire it was steep, but not too bad.  I then had to descend 4 miles to the shelter.   I had hoped to make up some time on this descent but it was more difficult than the climb, and took more time.  There were all sorts of rock faces I had to climb over and slide down.   About a mile and a half from the shelter the trail moderated some.  


I then began my ascent of Kinsman mountain.   The 1st mile wasn’t too bad and followed a cascading stream.  The next mile and a half was probably the steepest mountain I have climbed with a pack on this journey.  I eventually reached the summit.   It was very foggy and windy and there was no view.  


The dissent to the shelter was deep, but not too bad.   I saw the caretaker at the shelter and bought the thru hiker pass.  The descent after the shelter was down sheet rock faces with some help at times but was unrelenting.   The trail profile eventually flattened out for a while, but the trail didn’t get the message.  It was puds with sheer rock faces up and down.  
After the hut I had more rock faces to deal with and rocky trail.  I then had a major ford of Cascade Brook.  After this, mercifully the trail became easier.  


I took the Whitehouse Trail  off the AT to get to the parking area.  This is about 8/10 of a mile off the trail.  After 2/10 of a mile the trail splits to go to the Liberty Springs parking; you go up the mountain on a trail.  The other split goes to the flume parking and is paved.  From what I could see, it stayed flat.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666834,"The day started with me hiking a side trail back to the AT.   I had a 2.7 mile hike up to liberty Springs campsite and then another .3 up to the ridge.  The beginning of the climb was actually switched backed.  I saw stealth and sparks during the climb.   


It was very hard work after the switch backs, but no climbing over steep rock faces.  I got to the campsite and spring.   I got 2 L of water and hiked on.   I walked a  ridge for a while then began the climb of Little Haystack Mountain.  During this climb, I got above tree line.  After climbing a steep rock face, I turned around and saw this beautiful view.  Walking a little bit further I came out to the beautiful view of Mount Lincoln.   From this point on for the next 3 miles I was above tree line.  I didn’t think I could be awe inspired above tree line after Moosilauke.  This is an epic place with an outstanding view.  Words can’t describe how I felt seeing this beautiful place.  All the hard work was worth what I saw.


I hiked over Mount Lincoln then continue to Lafayette.  It was a very hard walk but beautiful.   I was concerned about storms, so I didn’t take long breaks on the hike.  However, you couldn’t help but enjoy the views you as you walked.  


After Lafayette, the descent was steep and time consuming.  Before I dropped back into the trees, I had a good view of Mount Garfield.   Just on the other side of Garfield is where I was going to sleep.   It’s a little disconcerting seeing how far you have to walk before you can rest.


Eventually, I climbed Garfield and looked back at Lafayette.   I met a hiker called Superior because she’s from Michigan.   She is a slow hiker like me and we talked as we descended Garfield.   


The shelter area and campsite is very crowded but the tramily Mary had breakfast with and who had helped me back in Vermont is here. I tend to camp away from crowded areas. This is a little bit odd for me.  Hopefully things will get quiet once darkness comes.

I had to continue my descent off of Mount Garfield.  It was steep with lots of rock faces.   At one point it was like walking down a waterfall.    Not a gushing powerful waterfall, but a waterfall all the same.   I eventually got to Galehead Hut.   Their breakfast was gone, but they had a carrot cake and it was good.  


Immediately after the hut, I had to climb South Twin  Mountain.    It was a steep .7 1130 feet up.  Believe it or not, no one passed me.   That is a minor miracle for me.    Four or five thru hikers were packing their packs in preparation for the ascent as I left.  


I was above tree line for a while, but it was very cloudy, and the views were OK but not great.  I made it to Zeeland Falls Hut around 3:20 PM.  I used my thru hiker pass to get a bowl of soup.   I also had a baked good and some lemonade.   Over the hike today I kept running into a man and his son and his son’s friend.   The boys were probably early high school age.   They were super excited about their hike and very polite.  The father is worrying about the weather tomorrow.   The boys are gung ho to climb the mountain.   


The trail from the hut was mostly flat.  It is the first time in New Hampshire that I walked more than 2 miles an hour.   I have noticed that the bog bridges are rotten and broken many places.  It made for very difficult walking to swampy areas at times.   The AMC needs to invest money and time into these repairs.   It’s not just here but a lot of New Hampshire.   


I loaded up on water and walked about a half mile and found a good campsite.   Tomorrow I have 3.4 miles to the road.   Mary is going to pick me up for a Nero day.  Tomorrow is supposed to be very rainy and stormy, so a good day to be off the trail.

After the view, I had to start climbing steep rock faces.   The trail got much tougher.   Also the trail wasn’t marked very well. It was hard to navigate.   Cup of soup passed me on the trail and we took a break on the top of Mount Webster.

I  hiked over Mount Washington, the second highest mountain on the AT.   It was very foggy, windy and cool.  I stayed at the summit and had a hot chocolate in the visitor center.   


The descent of Washington started my bouldering. Except for a few places, I had to walk over boulders until I got below tree line.  About a half a mile from Madison Hut it began to rain.   It wasn’t a hard rain, but it got things wet.  I took a break at the hut but when I got ready to leave, it started thundering.  I waited a while, and things cleared up.   It was very windy coming over Madison.   The trail was not marked well.   At the summit of Madison there was a sign for another trail but not the continuation of the AT. It almost looked like the Trail just ended.   I hiked a little further, looked backwards and saw a white blaze.  There was no discernible Trail. I just had to follow the cairns.  It was very difficult walking and I was very tired after all the boulding from before.  I found out later that Couch to Trail fell in this area on her back.   Fortunately, for her, the pack took the brunt of the fall and she was OK.  She could’ve been hurt very badly.


I eventually reached tree-line and then started descending steeply.  It was very tiring after all of the bouldering I had done.   I decided to stop short of my planned camp because it got dark.  I set up camp with a headlamp as it begin to sprinkle.   I ate dinner away from camp in the light rain.  I then hung my bear bag, stretched and got into my hammock.    A tough day.

The climb of the wild cats was very difficult for me.  It was very steep with lots of rock faces.  I remember from the section hike that this place made me think of my fear of heights.   It is so again.   There is one ledge where you have a great view of Mount Washington.   It just so happened the fog that surrounded the summit cleared.   The photo for today is looking down a steep rock face that I just climbed up.


Near the summit of the first wildcat is a gondola building.  This is where I slept in my section hike.   I checked the door, and this time it was locked.   After the summit of the first wildcat I descended with rock faces.    It was just a very difficult section.   The last wildcat Mountain was the easiest to climb.   


I thought the steep descent to the hut was going to be extra brutal.  They actually had rock steps and some switch backs.  It was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

Today was a very difficult hike.   They were steep ups and downs with lots of rock faces.  I spent a lot of time, trying to figure out how in the world I was going to go up or down something.   The hardest was usually going down.     


There were moments of zen though at times. One such a moment was on top of Goose Eye East Peak (there were three different Goose Eye Peaks).  It was a barren summit with a nice breeze.  I had lunch and just relaxed.    It was a beautiful view of places that I’ve already hiked and places that I soon would hike.  


One thing I have noticed about Maine so far is theirtheir use of rebar.  I have seen more rebar ladders in the short time I have been in Maine than all of the time in New Hampshire.   This is not an exaggeration.    I’m not sure if it’s because the trail is that much harder or if the Maine ATC club is just more concerned with our welfare.  


I saw CAVU about .5 miles into Maine and again at full goose shelter.   He had about the same hike that I did.    He expressed this several times and a sobo hiker had a really big eyes.  I told CAVU but he was scaring the sobo about tomorrow :-).  The sobo told us of a nobo thru hiker that had a meltdown today and was thinking about quitting.  Crazy stuff going on right now.

It is amazing how hiking without a backpack can make you feel.  It was an absolutely wonderful day.   The climb up Baldpate became steep after the first lean to.   Baldpate West Peak wasn’t anything special, and then you descend into a col.  The col looks like it held a reservoir of lava.   I then ascended to Baldpate West Peak.  It is an amazing place above tree line.   It would be a great place to cowboy camp on a clear night.    
The descent from little Baldpate was extremely steep.  It would be difficult on a wet day.  There was one more climb after the next lean to and then some very walkable Trail.  It is the first trail in a while that I could do a steady pace.

Today was a clear day for hiking.  The rain from yesterday left the trail, very muddy and sloppy wet.   I saw many thru hikers heading north, and a couple southbound hikers. While the trail today wasn’t terribly strenuous the terrain and conditions made for slow hiking.  
I met up with a flip flopper named shamrock.   He is from Waco Texas.    We talked about the fords as he is hiking sobo.  We hiked the last 2 miles together the road.     It was fun conversing with him.

Today was all about ponds.   I walked by Long Pond, Sabbath Day Pond and my favorite Little Swift River Pond.  All of these places would be great to camp out. Little   Swift River Pond had canoes (two looked like they would float) and paddles.  
The terrain today was excellent for speed.   The only problem what’s the deep, mud pits and broken bog bridges.

The highlight of the day was hiking over tree line.  This was going over Saddleback Mountain and the Horn.  It was an amazing day.   Very clear and windy.   It was also very chilly.   My kind of weather.   The views were outstanding in every direction.    It reminded me of Franconia Ridge but without all the crowds.  I took breaks on the summits of Saddleback, The Horn, and Saddleback Jr.    For the first time in months, I had to wear my gloves and my toboggan.    It was awesome.   


I am told that after Saddleback and Sugarloaf (which comes tomorrow) the trail begins to be easier than Southern Maine.   Today’s hike was so beautiful, but I didn’t mind the hard work. The hardest part of the day for me was the ascent of Saddleback Jr.     It was absolutely no fun, but the view from the summit was great.


I forded Oberton stream near the end of the day.   The water came up just below my knees.   I have another ford at the end of tomorrow.   I read that the reason there are not many bridges in Maine is that they’re destroyed in the spring thaw.   The MATC felt it wasn’t worth the money to keep replacing them every few years.  I can understand that.   It does make for some dangerous crossings though with as much rain as we keep having.   The sobos say most stream crossings were fine except for two near Monson.   I will keep my eye on the weather and make judgments about what to do as the fords come up.


Today was a really good day.

There was trail magic in the form of hotdogs  in the middle of nowhere.  It was from father and uncle of a hiker that I’ve been seeing on and off for about a month.  After the magic, I had a ford Bald Mountain Brook.  I used my water shoes for that crossing.  
I hiked a couple miles further and had to ford Marble Brook. This was a confusing place and I had to backtrack to find the AT.  I lost at least 20 minutes trying to figure out where I was at.   About .4 miles later I forded the W. Branch of the Piscataquis River.  That is the photo of the day.   I didn’t use my water shoes, but I took my insoles out of my boots and socks off.  I then crossed in my boots.  This is the ford that everyone has been concerned about.  When I crossed the cubic feet flow rate was about 110.  The crossing is safe as high as 400.   The water came up to just below my shorts.

There was a blue blazes trail that started my walk around. That was the easiest part, navigation wise.  There was little signage and the far out map didn’t have all of the road on it.  I think because some of them are private roads   The GPS locator on the FarOut app did help me figure out where I was at and I only got turned around once. I was constantly unsure of where I was at.  That was not a good feeling.


Because of the hard rain, I didn’t stop to eat except at the first shelter.   A group of young adults with an older leader came into the shelter.  I asked them if they were doing the walk around.   They had no idea what I was talking about.   I airdropped the map to them and explained want to do.  I never saw them after they passed me on the trail just after the shelter.  I also saw 4 thru hikers.

Today’s hike took me over the Barren and Chairback mountain ranges.  It is described as very rugged hiking.  I would agree.   There were some steep descents and rock ledges.  Between the difficult terrain and large mud pits with water everywhere, the hiking for me was very slow.  


One good thing about today is all the blueberries.  I guess that was another thing that slowed me down.    I kept hiking, and eventually got to the Pleasant River.   It was pretty late, maybe a half hour before dark.   I had to decide whether to ford today or tomorrow.   The water was higher and a little faster than I preferred.  I felt like I could do it though so I did the ford in my boots.  The river is about a  100 feet wide at the ford.  I took it slowly and carefully.   I got to the other side safely.

Shades of Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668000,"Today was a full day.  I woke up, tired and sore, but I had to keep going.   After looking at the weather forecast Mary had sent me yesterday I thought it would be a good idea to get on the North side of the ford.  That would be walking .7 more miles.  


I knew I had to cross over the whitecap range, which are the highest mountains in the wilderness.   I walked hard and did my best.    I was able to walk relatively fast to the Gulf Haigis area of the trail.  I slowed down some as I began my climbs.    As I was climbing Whitecap Mountain it  begin to thunder.  Once I reach the summit I checked the weather forecast.  Mary had sent me an update.   It had changed from 3/4 inch of rain overnight to 1 to 2 inches or rain overnight.   Another inch of rain on Friday.  This made it even more imperative to get across the ford.


While on top of whitecap I heard a sonic boom.  I looked over and saw a military jet flying, not far from me at all.  It banked hard right.  I could see the contrails off its wing tips.  Another jet was following it.  I saw the jet first then heard the boom.  It was very cool.   


I got down to the shelter to get water.   I saw airleron and warned him about the change in the forecast.  He wasn’t going to cross the ford but decide to because of what I said.  


As I got closer to the next shelter, I stopped to take a picture.   This was the area I had camped in during my section hike.  When I stopped, I heard this loud crash to my left.  I looked over and saw a Moose.  It moved too quickly for me to take a picture, but it was great seeing it.  I’ve now seen bears, loons and a moose.  How cool is that? 


I got to the river and looked about 30 yards up stream.  I saw some rocks and bushwacked to them.   I was able to rock hop across the water.   Two of the rocks were barely underwater. If I had waited until tomorrow, I am not sure I would’ve seen the submerged rocks.   I had just watched Airleron cross.  It was scary to behold.  I’m glad he got across, but I didn’t want to go his path.


Another late day with more rain on the way.  While today was a cool day, I am really getting sick of the rain.   The forecast Mary sent me looks like summit day will be a bad day.   If it continues to be that way, I will have to wait another day to summit.  Mary worked out camping in the Park.
This means I can come off the Trail Abol Bridge, and be with her.  Not sure if I can walk the 20 miles I have scheduled tomorrow with the heavy rain.    We will just have to see.  It is 67.8 miles to Katahdin, which I saw from whitecap.

I came across an unnamed brook.   The AT guide didn’t call it a ford.  Comments on Far out had people rock hopping just a few days ago.   With the recent rain, the rocks were completely submerged.   I looked for and saw a log upstream going across the brook.  I’ve had such a good luck with these things that I went for it.  I got almost to the other end when there were several smaller logs to step on.  As I stepped on it, the logs started to submerge. I then heard a loud crack and suddenly I was hip deep in the brook.  I grabbed onto the boulder to keep from going down stream.  I then climbed out of the water.  My pack was dry, but I was not. I had worked so hard to keep my boots and socks dry because of my feet.  All that work was gone in a second.   The next ford was so shallow that I could walk across the small rocks in the creek bed.  It’s funny now, but not so funny then.  


Because of the cold water my feet were sore all day.  Cold makes the tendons in my feet tighten.   I walked through the pain and kept on going.


In the middle of the day I had to climb Nesuntabunt Mountain. After walking a relatively flat trail for so many miles, the climb was difficult.  It was worth it though, because at the summit, with a 200 foot walk was a great view of Katahdin.  All of my other views have been cloudy or foggy.  While it wasn’t completely clear I could see Katahdin very well.  I have walked thousands of miles, and there it was.  Wow!


I walked beside rainbow stream for several miles before I got the lean to.   At first nobody was here, but several people showed up after I made camp.   If the weather continues as forecasted, this will be my last night camping on my thru hike.  This is because I will have a day between being at the base of Katahdin, and then climbing Katahdin because of rain on Tuesday.

It took a long time to climb this section.   I eventually got to the gateway.  The trail flattened out and became the table land.   It was foggy but little wind.  After a while, the fog burned off, and it was clear on the table lands.  I had another climb and then I reached the summit.  The hiker who was signed in before me was still there and took my picture.   She then left, and I meditated on my journey.  It was amazing being on Katahdin again.   I thought about all of the adversity of cold, rain and pain. I also thought about the joy and peace I experienced.  
After a while, another thru hiker came up to the summit.  I took his picture with his phone.  I then began my journey home.
I want to thank Mary for all the help she gave me on my thru hike.  Her belief in me helped me believe in myself.  I will add one more entry into this journal in a week or two.   I want to give myself time to reflect.   Thank you for following my journey.
