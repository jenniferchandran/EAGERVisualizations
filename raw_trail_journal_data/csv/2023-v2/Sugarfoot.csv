Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659550,"Do you see the list of my other journals to the left?  If you are using a smart phone or tablet, you may have to rotate your device to landscape mode for them to become visible.  2013.  2018.  2021.  2022.  Each represents a failed attempt at an Appalachian Trail thru-hike.  And here I am, starting another journal for 2023.  IT’S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME!  How many times have you said or heard that?  But I’m sure it will be.  Otherwise I wouldn’t be starting again.  
In 2013, I started at Amicalola Fall State Park in Georgia.  From the first step, my knees hurt but I kept thinking they would get used to it.  I was first diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knees in 1997 and heard the dreadful words, “Progressive and degenerative.  Eventually you’ll need knee replacements.”  I tried every remedy and nostrum, ranging from supplements like glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, and even proteolytic enzymes to Cho-Pat straps, knee sleeves, and eventually custom off-loading braces.  I tried cortisone injections and viscosupplement injections, only to discover that I’m allergic to the latter.   None helped, at least not for long.  In 2010, I had arthroscopic bilateral release surgery to free my patellae which had become locked and frozen.  That worked and relieved the pain, which was why I thought I could thru-hike in 2013.  I made it to the Nantahala Outdoor Center in North Carolina, trail mile 136.7.  It’s a 2,300’ descent over four miles to the sports complex on the river, and I could smell bacon fumes wafting up the whole way.  They seduced me into moving far too rapidly and by the time I reached River’s End Restaurant, I was a wreck and unable to walk without wincing pain.  
We had been living in Sarasota, Florida for a long time, but with retirement in 2016, we moved to Burlington, Vermont.  Yes, that’s the opposite direction from what most people do, but even on a cold snowy day, we have no regrets.  I consulted the orthopedic surgeons at the University of Vermont Medical Center.  They didn’t think that my knees were bad enough for replacements yet but recommended physical therapy.  Why no one had up until then is a mystery, because it worked wonderfully and my 2017 AT hike worked very well.  So in 2018, I decided to thru-hike, starting from the Flip-Flop Festival in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.  My cousin Rocky Raccoon joined me to Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania and from the start we had a great trail family (tramily), including Willow who remains a lifelong friend.  I came home for a few days from the Hudson River, after 382 miles, but on my return to the trail, my knees starting hurting in a bad way, like pain at the level of 7 or 8 on the 0 to 10 scale.  Home again.
Now I was ready for new knees, and I’m grateful for the excellent surgeons at Mansfield Orthopedics in Morrisville, Vermont.  I had them done in February and October of 2019.  With Rocky Raccoon, I tried again, starting southbound from Harpers Ferry in August 2021.  It was too soon and my knees, or rather the muscles, ligaments and tendons around the knees, were unable to tolerate day-after-day hiking.  I lasted 115 miles to Swift Run Gap in Shenandoah National Park.  
I returned to physical therapy and a brutal program of interval training to build up my “tissue tolerance.”  I improved to the point that I could comfortably hike double digit miles on consecutive days carrying full pack.  So in April 2022, i started once again from Harpers Ferry heading northbound.  Ness was my special trail friend on this hike and I did fine until I hit the rocks of Pennsylvania just north of Duncannon.  it was supposed to be an 18 mile day, and I called for a shuttle after 7 miles.  Back to physical therapy, this time to discover that the standard advice parroted by orthopedic surgeons of avoiding high impact after knee replacements is largely unsupported by evidence.  So I trained for impact and returned to Harpers Ferry in August, planning to hike south to Georgia and then hike the northern section in spring, 2023.  Rocky Raccoon joined me again.  The 161 miles down to Waynesboro went well, completing Rocky’s section, and I continued on.  On the second day, I started having a burning sensation on the back of my calves, bad enough that standing at the Tye River looking up at the 3,000 foot climb of The Priest, I knew that I couldn’t do it.  Home again.  
The good folk at the University of Vermont Medical Center ruled out circulatory issues,  compartment syndrome and a slew of other nasties, concluding that the pain was muscular or nerve-related.  They referred me back to physical therapy.  The therapist I had been using left private practice for a position with the Veterans Administration so I tried a practice within walking distance from our condominium and was assigned to a young DPT named Harry.  He has proved to be magical.  He asked excellent questions and by manipulating my legs was able to reproduce the pain that drove me from the trail.  Three days of supine sciatic glides, sometimes called nerve flossing, solved the problem, but Harry found other problems with my gait, stemming from years of accommodation to bad knees.  The improvement has been staggering,  Between his exercises, the stretches I was already doing, foam rolling, almost daily walks, and visits to the Y, I’m exercising about 25 hours a week.  He has me doing things I never thought possible after knee replacements, like lunges and squats with weight.  In the few remaining sessions I’ve scheduled with Harry, he promises to give me a home maintenance routine and an on-trail routine.  
So I’m ready to try it again. The witticism, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results,” is often attributed to Albert Einstein.  But, you see, I am not doing the same thing over and over again.  I have learned from each previous attempt and addressed the cause of each failure.  So I start my 2023 thru-hike with a great sense of optimism, although there is something lurking in the far recesses of my mind reminding me that there are infinite causes of failure still to be discovered.  Sigh!",,View Entry,"Dec 11, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659569,"I feel confident that physically I am ready for a thru-hike, or at least that I’m doing everything that I can to prepare my body.  I dealt with that in my last entry.  But what about my mental toughness when it rains for several consecutive days? My personal record is 18 days of wet, cold rain in Pennsylvania in May 1998.  Rocks and rain are a bad combination.  What if I make a good friend who has to go off trail?  Can I speak of them in the past tense and hike on, placing my mission ahead of the person?
Warren Doyle, Ph.D. is the director and founder of the Appalachian Trail Institute in Banner Elk, North Carolina.  He has thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail nine times and completed an additional nine section hikes. He’s one of the strong personalities that the AT tends to breed.  Through his Institute, Warren offers five-day programs designed to prepare aspiring thru-hikers to succeed.  He deals with the physical and cultural aspects but focuses more on mental and emotional preparation for the psychological demands of a long hike.  You can like or dislike Warren, but you have to respect him.  The facts are that only about 20-25% of people who start a thru-hike successfully complete it but 75% of his program graduates do.  I met him once on the trail and we did not hit it off, but that is neither here nor there.
Jennifer Pharr Davis devotes the second chapter of her 2010 book, Becoming Odyssa, to Warren and his Institute and particularly his icebreaker question for the first session, “Let’s go around the room and have everyone tell the class who they are and why they want to hike the Appalachian Trail.”  All kinds of reasons to hike were offered, including someone who wanted to hike it for fun.  Hah!  There are days that are fun, but far more that would appeal only to a masochist.  Jennifer offered that it was something she felt she was supposed to do, and under prompting by Warren, realized that it was a calling, that the Trail was calling her.  Jennifer and I served together on the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Board.  She doesn’t say things she doesn’t believe.  She has hiked the AT three times and for four years held the fastest known time on the AT, completing it in under 47 days.  She’s also completed over 8,000 miles on other trails and is a frequent speaker and hike leader through her Blue Ridge Hiking Company.  
So I have to ask myself why I want to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, knowing that i’ll need an answer that will sustain me when my body is aching or I’m suffering from homesickness and there are dozens of things that I would rather be doing, not the least being enjoying good food and drink.  Do I have an unquenchable thirst and compulsion to complete a thru-hike?
I look back at my history on the Appalachian Trail.  I have a memory from age seven, although I can’t be sure it really happened.  My family drove down to Florida from Baltimore on vacation.  This was before Interstate Highways and most of it was on U.S. Route 301.  Memories include tons of Stuckey's, South of the Border Motel, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  I also think we may have driven through Carvers Gap on Roan Mountain to see the rhododendron gardens.  When I first hiked this section in 1996, it looked very familiar and I had a fuzzy recollection of seeing hikers crossing the highway and hiking up Grassy Ridge. I didn’t know where they were going, but I wanted to go with them.  True or not, I count it as my first encounter with the Appalachian Trail.  
I hiked a little of the AT around the James River in Virginia while in high school and lots of Georgia and the Smokeys when I spent a year at the University of Georgia doing research while an undergraduate at New College in Florida.  My interest in science diminished during that time, but my interest in natural history grew.  Life intervened and I didn’t return to hiking until I started to section hike the AT in 1994.  Except for 2019 when I had my knees replaced and during rehab in 2020, I did at least a short section of the AT annually, including my four previous thru-hike attempts, so perhaps it is an obsession with me.  Seeing the Appalachian Trail the first time as a little boy, or imagining that I did, was love at first sight, and that passion has matured into a long-term relationship, secure enough to have survived fourteen years on the board of directors of The Appalachian Trail Conservancy and its predecessor board of managers. If serving on endless committees, including a day-and-a-half debate on double blazing policy, haven’t dissuaded me, I’m not sure what could.  I haven’t kept careful track, but I’ve hiked at least 6,000 miles on the AT.   The Appalachian Trail is such a part of me, that when I’ve hiked other trails I have felt like an adulterer.  
Hiking the AT is more than the fulfillment of a fantasy for me.  Each and every time I start a hike and get far enough from the trial head for the road noise to diminish, I feel suddenly taller and have a sense of belonging.  Each hike is a homecoming for me.   I shed my cares and concerns and never sleep better than when on the Appalachian Trail.  I’m prone to repetitious and compulsive behaviors.  Maybe I’m confusing a habit with a calling.
I started to collect inspirational sayings that I could fall back on during the tough times on this hike, but they all sound so trite and cliché, like a Hallmark Christmas film, that I quickly lost interest.  I much prefer film noir or even 1950’s horror films.  I’m not against positive thinking, and certainly negative thinking would guarantee my failure, but do I really want to skip down the trail saying, “I think I can, I think I can …”?  When I fall, as I tend to about once every two weeks, do I want to remind myself to get back on the horse?  Do I need an imaginary Norman Vincent Peale scolding me that “It’s always too soon to quit”?  Or rabid anti-semite Henry Ford lecturing me that “Failure is only the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently”.  I’m sure there are dozens of inspirational books that I could read to bolster my courage but I would sooner pray a novena to Bernard of Menthon (11th century), the patron saint of hikers and backpackers.  Or at least carry a small keg of brandy like the dog named after the saint.  
I saw a t-shirt at the Y a few weeks ago that summed it all up.  There was a crest on the left front from some exclusive health spa and their tag line was printed on the back:  What the mind can concieve (sic), the heart can believe, and the body can achieve.  If the misspelling and not-so-buff wearer were not sufficiently off-putting, there was the message itself that reeks of the power of positive thinking.  It’s a version of a quote from a 1937 book by Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich. 
I’m sorry, but wishing don’t make it so.  My praying is more listening than entreaty.  Whether wrapped in the claptrap of positive thinking or prosperity theology, the notion that if my faith were sufficiently strong, I will obtain my heart’s delight repulses me.  I haven’t read a self-help book or guide to feeling good about yourself since Jonathan Livingston Seagull in 1972.  
That being said, there are a couple of rules that I follow when I’m tempted to quit.  One is the old hiker adage of never quitting when it’s raining.  And the second is akin to a suicide prevention contract, when I commit to myself not to quit unless I still feel that way in seven or eight days.  Usually whatever was disturbing me passes or the sun shines or I simply forget that today is the day I was supposed to quit.  
So why do I want to thru hike the Appalachian Trail?   Because it’s what I do.  I’m not hiking for a cause, neither a dread disease nor in celebration of the LGBTQIA community.  It’s where I belong.",,View Entry,"Dec 15, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659578,"With this entry, my journal goes live and will show on the journal listings.  I kept the same direct link as last year, www.trailjournals.com/sugarfoot and apparently some of you bookmarked it and are receiving update notifications.  I hope it isn’t an accident and that you will continue to follow me in 2023!  I should have mentioned it in my last entry, but knowing that there are people who are actually reading my trail scribblings is very encouraging in keeping me from quitting.  But no more talk of quitting, since I haven’t even started yet!
I didn’t plan this, but my first entry dealt with my physical conditioning for the trail and the second with my mental conditioning.  So it seems only right that I should now deal with the stuff I’ll be carrying.  I updated the gear tab on the sidebar.  That’s where you will find the details of what constitutes the 15 pounds that I consider my base weight.  It includes everything except consumables, which I define as food, water, gas canister, toilet paper, Aleve and anything I expect to use up during my hike.  I’ll be starting with four days of food, averaging 1-1/4 pounds of food per day.  I’ll also start with 1-1/2 liters of water.  With all the other consumables, my leaving town weight will be no more than 25 pounds, which is well within the capacity of both my backpack and my strength.  As I hike further into spring, I’ll send some unneeded clothes home, reducing my pack weight by about a pound.  But initially, the weight of the extra clothing is worth it to me considering that lows in the 20’s are possible on the ridge in Shenandoah National Park.
Many hikers obsess over pack weight, and that is not a bad thing, especially if your goal is hiking high daily miles and spending little time in camp.  When I made the decision to carry a bear canister several years ago, I realized that ultralight pack weight was now out-of-reach.  I had been down to about 11 pounds of base weight, but the bear canister weighs two pounds and I found that I needed a more substantial pack to carry it in comfort.  Then there are my luxury items that add more to my happiness than the weight detracts from it.  You might well decide that camp/town shoes are an unnecessary 10 ounces.  And you might decide to go stoveless, saving another 8 ounces plus the weight of the gas canister.  I find that a hot meal at night is worth the weight penalty.
Deciding what to carry is matter of optimizing several conflicting factors.  Weight, cost, comfort, and durability come to mind.  What is optimal for me may be unworkable for you, so please don’t view my gear list as a shopping list for yourself.  I find it humbling to know that what I consider optimal now will change during the course of this hike and certainly by next year.  As a small example, when I just went to ULA Equipment’s website to verify the recommended carrying capacity of the Circuit backpack I use, I noticed that they now have a new model called the Ultra Circuit made of what sounds like a superior fabric. Similarly, Zpacks has replaced my Pleximid Tent with the Plex Solo Tent.  In both cases, I will wait until my present ones wear out, but already I know that my gear is no longer optimal!  You may have issues, like an allergy to goose down or be plus-sized and face limited choices.  Find what works for you, knowing that whatever you choose, there will be better options tomorrow!
In this entry, I’m just going to discuss the changes I made to my gear since I started my 2022 hike.  I keep my gear lists on spreadsheets, with actual weights to the tenth of an ounce.  I weigh things myself rather than relying on manufacturers’ websites.  In comparing my April 2022 gear list to the one for April 2023, I note the following changes which add a cumulative 13.0 ounces to my kit.  That will seem blasphemous to some of you.
Sleeping Pad (+5.3 oz) - My old Thermarest NeoAir Uberlight pad started leaking and I was unable to patch it.  Aside from needing to be reinflated every 30-40 minutes by the end, it was always a very noisy pad.  The Exped Ultra 1R is quiet, much more comfortable and the fabric is considerably more rugged.  The extra weight includes Exped’s Schnozzel inflation bag that eliminates nightly huffing and puffing and also keeps moisture out of the pad.
Tent Stakes (no change) - After an incident of shepherd crook stakes pulling free in a bad squall, I switched to Titanium V-stakes but they could not tolerate being pounded with rocks.  The MSR mini-groundhog stakes weigh the same but offer considerably greater holding power and tolerate pounding well.
Pot Lifter (no change) - I replaced a GSI Outdoors MicroGripper with a Miksa Pot Lifter.  The former is like a pot holder for your fingers.  Transferring a full pot into the pot cozy often meant dipping my fingers into hot food.  The Miksa Pot Lifter is made in a Canadian garage from aluminum and allows me to lift a loaded pot without burning my fingers.
Olive Oil Bottle (-0.7 oz) - I really don’t need extra fat added to my meals.  I have plenty of fat of my own for now. 
Dr. Bronner’s Soap (no change) - I switched to scentless soap from lavender scent.  Their original peppermint scent is the most common, but I find it too astringent.  I don’t know which bears prefer.
Hoody (+6.6 oz) - For the first couple of weeks of my 2022 hike, layering a t-shirt and a long-sleeve zipper t-shirt left me feeling cold for the first couple of hours of the day, but it wasn’t cold enough for my down puffy.  I’m adding an old favorite, the Montbell CoolLite Hoody that I’m pictured in.  Either the hoody or the zipper t-shirt, along with my fleece cap, gloves and rain mitts, will go home after a few weeks, when it warms up.  
Spare T-shirt (-2.9 oz) - A spare short sleeve t-shirt was simply not needed.
FITS Socks (no change) - I have switched to FITS Rugged Light Crew socks from their Light Hiker socks.  I’ll write more about them, because I love, love, love them!
Distance Glasses (-0.7 oz) - I don’t legally need distance glasses to drive but the astigmatism correction does improve my distance vision.  I carried them in 2022 but never wore them.
Sandals (+7.8 oz) - I started my 2022 hike with Mayfly Imago 2 sandals, weighing 2.0 ounces for the pair.  I loved the weight and the bright colors, but unfortunately they proved useless for walking, even for nighttime pissing.  The Xero Z-Trail EV sandals weigh more but I could actually hike in them if need be.
Groundcloth (-1.7 oz) - I used a Dyneema Composite Fabric groundcloth under my sleeping pad in shelters.  With the more rugged sleeping pad, this is unnecessary. I admit to waffling on this item, and I may carry it if the on-trail routine that my physical therapist recommends requires lying down.  We are leaning toward doing the stretching routine after walking a few miles to warm up.
Baby Rocky Raccoon (-0.7 oz) - My cousin whose trail name is Rocky Raccoon knit this little beast for me to remember her by.  She can be with me in spirit without the weight, and I’m hoping she’ll join me for part of this hike. The real Rocky Raccoon is preferable to the stuffed one.
Hiking Shoes (n/a) - Altra replaced the Olympus 4 trail running shoes with the Olympus 5.  I like the additional padding, but I needed a half-size larger for the same comfort.
Trekking Poles (n/a) - My Leki Carbonlite Aergon Speedlock trekking poles were only about 10 years old but ready to be retired after one of the speed locks broke.   While I’m sure that Leki could have repaired them, I was ready for a new pair.  I look forward to using the Leki Black Series poles in 2023.  The straps are so much more comfortable and the adjustment much more secure.
Gaiters (n/a) - The Dirty Girl Gaiters I used for several years were wearing out.  I replaced them with Altra gaiters which have Velcro on both sides of the heel, for a more secure attachment in the “Gaiter Trap” on the heel of the Altra shoes.
Hiking Shorts (n/a) - For years I used Patagonia hiking shorts with a Spandex liner.  While very comfortable and good at preventing chaffing, I find that I prefer Montbell’s hiking shorts that are unlined but highly breathable. 
Looking back over the gear changes I made in just one year amazes and embarrasses me.  If you are just starting out and assembling your gear, take comfort in knowing that you will end up regretting most of the choices you make, and either on your hike or in subsequent years, you will end of replacing it.  It is still a relatively inexpensive hobby compared to car racing or even golf, and for me, infinitely preferable.",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659592,"Socks.  What’s the first thing that comes to your mind?  The garments on your feet?  Perhaps your collection of mismatched socks kept in hopes that one day the missing socks will return from wherever it is they go?   Perhaps the sock that gained Dobby the House Elf his freedom in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets?  If you are of a literary bent, in Shakespeare’s comedy Twelfth Night, wearing yellow stockings and smiling all the time were sufficient to suggest that the butler Malvolio was mad.  And, of course, Blue Stockings was the name of an 18th-century English literary society.  
Socks, whether the garment or the feline variety, are popular in children’s literature.  The award-winning Socks by Beverly Cleary (1973) comes to mind and inspired the name of the White House kitty under President Clinton.  Socks are free from sexual or gender overtones that might attach to other undergarments and in these times lead to a book being banned.  Shhh! Don’t tell anyone that sock can be slang for condom, lest Dr. Seuss’ Fox in Socks joins six other Dr. Seuss titles out of publication because of racist or insensitive imagery.   
Since Covid, I’ve satisfied my book fix mostly by downloading ebooks from Burlington’s Fletcher Free Library, a member of the Green Mountain Library Consortium.  Books on the virtual shelves can be browsed in any number of ways, including curated collections of mysteries, native American heritage, seasonal holiday romances, and so on. This being Vermont, there’s even a collection of 240 books banned elsewhere.  I scanned the titles, confirming that socks are unlikely to offend community decency and mores.   Heaven forbid that our precious little ones should be contaminated by such filth as Lord of the Flies, Kite Runner, The Bluest Eye, 1984, The 1619 Project, or the demonic Harry Potter series!  Remind me to put my eyes out and floss my brain for having read and enjoyed such things.  
Censorship and the attempts to assure that children, and indeed, all citizens are exposed only to ideas and imagery that offend no one are sore points with me.  What would it have meant to me growing up in the 1950’s to have discovered that there were other people with feelings like mine or to have been read a story by a drag queen, or to have learned that people come in all varieties, flavors, shapes, colors, likes and dislikes and that we all deserve to be celebrated and valued?  But I digress, and if you have read many of my entries in past years, you are not surprised.  On the other hand, if you want your trail journals tidy and unadulterated by the concept that a hiker is more than a means to carry a backpack from Georgia to Maine, this may not be the journal for you.  One reason that I hike, especially when hiking solo, is that when my body is working and not in pain, my mind is free to float away, possibly even to commune with the missing socks in some sacred space.  I’ll share with you not only the adventures of my feet, which let’s face it, can be boring, but also the encounters I have with fellow hikers and townspeople and even the fantasies that occupy a great deal of my hiking time.  
Now back to socks.  Socks are what come between a hiker and shoes, boots, or sandals and are far from trivial.  The right socks can be the difference between nursing blisters and having happy tootsies.  Happy feet make for a happy hiker, freeing attention to be directed elsewhere, whether to the wild digressions I favor or simply fixating on the all-you-can-eat buffet in the next town.  
About ten years ago at a meeting of the Appalachian Trail Club of Florida (decidedly not a maintaining club), I met a guy who had been in Special Forces who raved over FITS socks, made in the USA.  I ordered a couple of pair of their light hikers and I’ve been using them ever since, usually ordering three pair a year.  A pair I purchased in 2021 seemed to me to wear prematurely and I sent an inquiry to them, asking if they had changed their fiber source or manufacturing, and attached a photo of the pair with my big toes sticking out.  Brandon from customer services responded by return email, assuring me that nothing had changed and offered to replace them under their two-year warranty.  But first he wanted to know my shoe size and how I used them.  I had been using size Large but their fitting table suggests the Extra-Large, and Brandon felt that their Light Rugged - Crew might be a better choice.  He sent me a pair in Extra-Large, and while I liked them, by the second consecutive day of use, they started to bunch up in my shoe.  So Brandon sent me a pair in large, and they fit perfectly.  I took advantage of their Black Friday 25% off sale and ordered five additional pairs to qualify for free shipping.  What’s special about them?
The interior of the sock is Merino wool for excellent moisture control.  Under the foot and around the heel, the wool is full loop, providing excellent cushioning.  On top of the foot and on the ankle, it’s a Merino blend mesh for breathability.  The exterior is nylon for durability.  I sent the socks off to InsectShield for permethrin treatment (good for 70 washes) and have been wearing them at home, for exercising, and for walking, typically for three consecutive days.  I’ve never really done this before, but these particular socks really seem to benefit from washing inside out.  
On a hike, I wear one pair of socks and carry two others.  I use one of the clean pairs as sleeping socks and then move them into day use on day three or four.  The first pair goes into a separate stuff sack that I designate as my toxic waste bag.  The third pair becomes my sleeping socks and I wear them on the last day of a section, to go into town.  I apply Foot Glide or a similar anti-blister balm to my feet each morning, especially to the heel, ball of the foot and toes.
When I moved to Vermont, I expected to migrate to Darn Touch socks that are made here in Vermont.  I tried several pairs of their Midweight Hiking Socks and their Micro Crew Lightweight Hiking Socks.  They are excellent socks and very similar in fit, materials and construction to FITS, but the seam above the toes is slightly more pronounced and resulted in blisters on top of my toes.  On the other hand, Darn Tough offers an unconditional lifetime guarantee.  Darn Tough is probably the most popular sock on the Appalachian Trail and some outfitters will replace worn ones on the spot.
Other people swear by Injinji socks which are like gloves for the feet, with little pockets for the toes.  My toes are less flexible than ideal and I have a hard time getting my toes into the right pockets.  They offer excellent protection against blisters, I’m told.  
Thanks for reading.  Aside from giving me a chance to rant in the first few paragraphs, discussing socks gives me a way to show how I make gear decisions.  It’s never easy for me and I frequently change my mind.  But at least with respect to socks, I have found the perfect pair for me, for now.",,View Entry,"Dec 22, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659642,"People I know at church and at the Y have started to ask questions.  No, not about my sexuality.  Being gay in Burlington is about like being Baptist in Alabama and not noteworthy.   Pride month, celebrated in June in most of the country, is postponed until September in Burlington, when the University of Vermont students have returned.  It’s a community-wide celebration, and Church Street is festooned with rainbow flags of every variety.  Seeing people of the same sex or indeterminate sex or gender holding hands or exchanging affection doesn’t warrant a raised eyebrow.  Everyone is normal in Burlington.  
The question I’ve been getting, especially this winter, is why I walk almost everywhere.  That seems queer to people.  Don’t we have a car?  Yes, we have a Subaru Outback (the unofficial state vehicle of Vermont) that is 6-1/2 years old and has nearly 15,000 miles on it.  We do drive it for groceries, some doctors’ appointments, an annual leaf peeping tour and every other day just around to keep the battery charged.  Almost everything we need is within a 1-1/2 mile radius, including the Y, a food co-op, the public library, Swiss chocolatier, church, pharmacy, dentist, medical center, and most critically, our hair stylists.  Restaurants and specialty stores line Church Street, which has been a pedestrian mall for over 40 years. Left to my own devices, I would get rid of our car and shop nearly daily at the food co-op, City Market, maybe carrying a cute little wicker basket.  I just prefer to walk, but that is hard for many people to understand.  I admit to having my own doubts occasionally, like on Christmas morning after a nor’easter blasted through, when I trudged down to church wearing insulated boots with NanoSpikes and several layers of clothing.  The windchill was wicked.  The service was not well-attended. Walking is just something that helps define me, and indeed helps to define our human species.  We evolved to walk, not to sit encased in a metal cage that magically transports us from one place to another.   
I’ll be starting my hike in Shenandoah National Park, which was the first national park designed with those metal cages in mind.  You probably know that the original Appalachian Trail was paved over to create the Skyline Drive that runs the 70-mile length of the park.  The reconstructed AT crosses and recrosses the Skyline Drive with lots of opportunities to meet curious tourists at designated scenic overlooks. Many park visitors never walk more than ten feet from their cars unless it’s at a wayside (restaurant and gift shop) or one of the park’s resorts or campgrounds.  I had a family warn me not “to go in there,” meaning follow the trail into the woods, because they had seen a bear not long before.  Ah, bears!
Questions about bears frequently arise.  Usually the question is phrased in two parts.  First comes the “Have you ever seen a bear on your hikes?”  Yes, I explain, in 12 of the 14 AT states.  I’m missing only Maryland and Connecticut to complete my bingo.  Perhaps the prize will be finding something else to do.  Then comes the real question, “Aren’t you afraid of bears?”  This is really a statement disguised as a question, roughly translating as “I would be so scared if I saw a bear that I would s**t my pants and tootle Dixie through my sphincter!”  Asking it as a question avoids admitting the fear.  I’m never certain how to answer.  
On one hand, why would I be afraid of a big hairy mammal that can weigh up to 700 pounds, have fangs three inches long and claws four inches long?  I’ve only seen one male bear approaching that size, on Loft Mountain in Shenandoah National Park in 1997.  The park naturalist and I both estimated his weight at 600 pounds.  He was feeding alongside the trail when I came along.  He merely looked at me, sort of shrugged his shoulders, and continued feeding.  I backed off a far piece and took a break until he moved on, fortunately not in my direction. 
For my “on the other hand” I was going to write about how rare black bear attacks have been in the eastern United States.  Then I Googled the topic. Wikipedia has a set of tables by decade and bear species titled List of fatal bear attacks in North America.  There have been nine fatal wild black bear attacks in the eastern United States since 1900. The most recent was in 2020 of a backpacker at a campsite near Hazel Creek in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  In 2014, three men were day hiking in a nature preserve near West Milford, New Jersey.  A bear started to stalk them, and they ran off in different directions.  Darsh Patel chose the wrong direction.  In 2006, a bear crashed a family picnic in the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee killing a six year old girl.  There was terribly sad incident near Fallsburg, New York in August 2002 when a bear knocked an infant out of her stroller and carried her corpse into the woods.  In May 2000, a camper in the Smokies was attacked and partially consumed near Elkmont, Tennessee.  In 1943, a hunter in Vermont was killed by a bear he had wounded but not fatally enough.  That sounds more like self-defense to me.  There was a teenage boy in Pennsylvania in 1906 who came upon a bear, thought it was dead, and started skinning it.  The bear was merely asleep.  Oops.  And finally in 1901 three children gathering flowers near their home in Job, West Virginia were attacked and killed.  None of these attacks occurred on the Appalachian Trail, but even so it does give me pause.  There are some takeaways:  Never run from a bear and never awaken a sleeping bear, at least not by trying to skin it.  Instead gently tap it on its shoulder and offer it a nice cappuccino.  ATC has some helpful information on their website: https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/plan-and-prepare/hiking-basics/safety/bears/.
In total, I’ve seen a couple of dozen black bears along the Appalachian Trail.  Some have been more curious than others, especially the yearlings who after two winters with momma are on their own and still have lots to learn.  For the most part, bears want nothing to do with humans and most of my sightings have been of their butts vanishing over a ridge or into the deep woods.   I’ve seen momma bears with their cubs, always from a safe distance.  I try to be alert for bear sign, such as scratch marks high on tree trunks and piles of scat. I have gotten pretty good at aging the scat.  When it’s still steaming and maggot-free, it’s fresh indeed.  Bears also have a unique slightly skunky odor, the males being somewhat more acrid.  Likewise, I suspect that bears are well aware of human sounds and odors, especially those of a hiker out for several days.  Surprising a bear would be unusual.   Proper food storage, either making use of any available metal bear-proof storage boxes or cable systems, taking the time for a proper food hang, or carrying a bear canister is just good manners, because a bear who becomes accustomed to human food faces euthanasia, a polite term for murder.  So really, I’m not afraid of bears but I give them proper respect.  
My dear friend Sandy, my chosen big sister, says she knows I could be eaten by a black bear but thinks that is very unlikely, having heard my spiel before.  She worries more that I won’t have the sense to bail on a hike if I hurt myself but would continue out of stubbornness or pride. My hiking history suggests otherwise!  I can tolerate some degree of pain but I don’t enjoy it and I am not averse to taking a few days off in town or coming home early.  I asked what questions she had.  Sandy wants to know how I go about planning a hike, how I know where to stop for the night and what resources I’ll find along the way.  She thinks that I’ve memorized the trail and nearby towns from previous hikes but wonders what a newbie would do.  That will be the topic for my next entry.",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659698,"Okay, Sandy, this entry is for you, and I’ll even try to stay on topic.  Well, sort of.  I do need to salute the New Year and celebrate that it is exactly three months before I fly down to Charlottesville, Virginia to begin my hike.  Hoorah!
If I were to start on Springer Mountain in Georgia knowing only that the Appalachian Trail were marked (blazed) with white painted 2” x 6” rectangles on trees, would I make it to Katahdin in Maine, 2,198.4 miles away?   I might, especially if there were other hikers around and one of them took pity upon me and told me about the blazes being yellow in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, painted on rock cairns since it is above treeline.  Other hikers, especially ones coming from the other direction might tell me how far it is to the next shelter or good campsite, although their advice would be suspect.  The distance they have come from a shelter may be very different than the distance to that shelter, depending upon the terrain and the time of day.  A mile uphill is a lot further than a mile gently downhill, and morning miles are shorter than afternoon miles.  I would quickly learn that trail miles are not measured by laser, or in the old days, chains, and vary by direction, time of day, and the way I feel.   But if I were patient with myself, I would probably find a shelter for the night.  There are over 250 shelters along the AT, averaging 8.8 miles apart.  In areas like national forests dispersed camping is permitted so there are plenty of places to spend the night.  A shelter usually has an associated tenting area, a water source, and a privy (an outhouse).   Shelters are natural gathering places at night, and as a solo hiker, I enjoy the company to some extent.  I might even find people that I enjoy hiking with or wouldn’t mind sharing a motel room with.  There are more than 500 public road crossings, many with trailhead parking areas.  Perhaps there would be a day hiker standing around who could tell me where the road led and how far it was to a town, and if I were pathetic enough, might offer me a ride.  They might even know if there were a grocery store, laundromat, and a hostel or motel in town.  
I would greatly improve my odds of getting to Maine if I carried maps or some other navigation aid.  Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s Ultimate Trail Store has links to trail clubs and vendors for the necessary maps, which aggregate $335.90.  The maps range in quality from excellent to useless and wouldn’t reflect recent relocations.  In addition, I would need an annual guidebook with information about services available on the trail, including trail mileage, shelters, water sources, profile (elevation) maps and town services  The most common are the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers’ Companion published by the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association (ALDHA) and ATC for $15.95 and the A.T. Guide by David “Awol” Miller costing $17.95.  Both are updated annually.  So for under $350, I would have the information I need to plan a thru-hike.  Of course, I wouldn’t want to carry all of the maps, so I would have to parcel them out into “mail drops,” packages that I would have a friend mail to me at post offices or businesses along the way, adding to the expense and inconvenience.
Alternatively, I could download an app for either iPhone or Android called FarOut for $59.95 that not only has all of the above information for the entire Appalachian Trail but also locates me on it using the GPS function of my phone even in airplane mode, shows me the direction of my travel when I get turned around, and includes recent comments from other users about such things as whether a spring or stream is running well or if a hostel owner is actually hostile toward hikers.  This app is updated whenever there is internet connectivity.  I personally use the FarOut app and the PDF version of the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers’ Companion that is free to me as a life member of ALDHA. I haven’t carried maps in years, although I still carry a small compass, just in case I get lost, my phone goes dead, and I don’t want to walk in circles.  
Okay, Sister Sandy, with those resources in hand, I’ll try to describe how I’ve actually planned this hike.  My first decision was which direction to hike and where and when to start.  About 80% of thru-hikers start in Georgia and hike northbound to Maine.  Under 10% start in Maine and hike southbound.  The rest start somewhere else.  A thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail means hiking the entire trail in a 12-month period.  It doesn’t have to be hiked in one direction from end-to-end.  Not liking crowds and preferring to do things my own way, I’ve decided to flip-flop.  I’ll start at Rockfish Gap, the southern end of Shenandoah National Park, between Charlottesville and Waynesboro, Virginia and hike north to Katahdin in Maine.  Then I’ll return to Rockfish Gap and hike south to Springer Mountain in Georgia.  Starting a flip-flop hike in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, the psychological half-way point of the trail, is more common and has the advantage of easier logistics, since it is easily accessible from Washington, D.C. via Amtrak.  I’ve chosen Rockfish Gap because Shenandoah National Park, Maryland, and southeastern Pennsylvania are some of the easier miles of the Trail and will be a kinder break-in for my old body.  I’ll have 286 miles to Duncannon on the Susquehanna River before the start of the infamous rocks of Pennsylvania.
I chose April 2nd as my starting date because the weather then is typically clement.  The average high and low temperatures in Waynesboro are 60* and 38*, possibly 10* cooler on the ridge.  Snow is possible, but accumulating snow is unlikely.  I spent some time deciding how to get to my starting point.  I could take Amtrak to Charlottesville but I wouldn’t get in until evening and have to spend the night there.  Hotels near the train station cost about $250 per night.  Or I could fly into Charlottesville at less cost than Amtrak business class, arrive early afternoon and arrange a shuttle into Waynesboro.   I’ll have the shuttle driver stop at the outfitter between Rockfish Gap and Waynesboro, because I’ll need a fuel canister for my stove and you can’t fly with one.  The outfitter is listed on FarOut and in the Companion.  The Quality Inn in Waynesboro is much more reasonable ($75) than Charlottesville, and I will have my choice for dinner of Ming Garden (an enormous Chinese buffet) or The Green Leaf Grill (excellent American cuisine).  I’ll choose Ming’s because I know if I go to Green Leaf I wouldn’t resist ordering a Hendricks martini and wine.  I don’t want to start my hike hung over.  So I purchased my plane ticket and reserved at the Quality Inn for Saturday, April 1st.  April Fools’ Day seems appropriate to me.  On Sunday, I’ll have an adequate complementary breakfast at the Quality Inn and If there is an early service, I’ll attend celebrate Palm Sunday at the Episcopal Church a few blocks away.   I’ll get a shuttle to Rockfish Gap and  start hiking in the late morning.  
Going north from Rockfish Gap, the first few shelters are spaced 7.7, 13.0, 13.2, and 8.2 miles apart.  There was a time when I would start a hike doing 15-17 mile days and hit 20 mile days in my second week.  Those days are past, so the spacing of the shelters looks good to me.  The fifth day will be 11.7 miles to Lewis Mountain Campground, the historic black campground from when Shenandoah National Park was segregated.  I will reserve a cabin for the night and enjoy a shower and do laundry.   Dinner will be something microwaveable at the camp store and I’ll try to resist the Bearfence Double IPA brewed by Classic City Beer in Waynesboro — delicious!  For some reason, craft beer is cheaper than soft drinks in the park.  The next day is undecided.  I’ll pass Big Meadows Resort after 8.7 miles, but it won’t open for the season until April 21.  Big Meadows Wayside after 7.8 miles, however, opens March 23 and can be accessed via a level 0.4 mile walk on an old fire road.  I’m hoping the grill will be open but at least the camp store will be. It has the best selection of backpacker-type food in the park.   Information on opening and closing dates is found on the website of Shenandoah National Park, following the link to the concessioniaire. It’s another 4.4 miles to Rock Spring Hut, hut being what shelters are called in the park, or 9.0 miles to Skyland Resort, which opens on the day I would arrive.  Staying at Skyland is rather expensive but I really like the trout dinner and the mountain blackberry ice cream pie.   It would be a long day, 16.8 miles, but food is powerful motivator.  I’ll have to decide in advance so I can reserve a room, provided that I can get cell phone reception.  It tends to be poor in the park.  The next day will be either 14.1 or 9.5 miles to Thornton Gap and a shuttle into Luray, Virginia where I’ll take a zero (a non-hiking day) for Easter Sunday.  If I stay at Rock Spring Hut I’ll stop at Skyland for breakfast the next morning.  Open Arms at the Edge of Town Hostel & Inn gets excellent reviews on FarOut and includes a shuttle from Thornton Gap, or there are many B&Bs or hotels to choose from.  I haven’t gone into Luray on previous hikes, so it will be a new adventure.  
And that’s the first section of my hike.  All of the information is in FarOut and the Companion, except for my food critiques.  I have planned beyond Luray, but I only finalize my plan a section at a time.  While in Luray, I’ll reserve lodging in Front Royal (either a hostel by the trailhead or a motel in town) and lodging in Harpers Ferry.  I may take another zero in Harpers Ferry, depending on how my body feels and if my friends who live there are available to play. 
So, Sandy, far from winging it, I’ll be hiking with the equivalent of a AAA TripTic showing every turn along the way, every shelter, gift shop, motel and restaurant.  If anything, there is too much information making it hard to pretend that I’ll be on a wilderness adventure.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659824,"I sat down to start my next entry the day after posting the last one and quickly realized that I had nothing to say, which is very uncharacteristic of me.  I was in the doldrums, a sailing ship adrift on windless waters.  All dressed up with nowhere to go.  My gear all gathered, reservations made, only needing to buy food for the first few days.  And still nearly three months until I leave.  
Then I got excited over the word doldrums, which may derive from Old or Middle English dull or dullen, “to make or become blunt or dull; to make or become dull-witted or stupid or become inactive,” the same root as dolt, meaning Homer Simpson.  I was sure that I first encountered the word in Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick.  It was the only novel assigned to me in high school that I still treasure and reread on occasion.  Not once have I been tempted to reread Silas Marner (egads!) or The Scarlet Letter.  I couldn’t even bring myself to watch the 2005 film of Pride and Prejudice that was partially filmed in Sarasota, not far from our house.  
So I started to reread Moby-Dick for something to occupy my time.  I’m 60% through it and doldrum has yet to appear.  I found a Melville Glossary online, and it isn’t there.  I found a searchable Moby-Dick online.  Nada.  But I am enjoying my hunt for the doldrums and finding great comfort in knowing that however often I digress from my topic, I can’t touch Melville for side excursions.  His digressions, however, even if they feel as eternal as a whole ham in the fridge (to borrow from an old edition of Joy of Cooking), filled in knowledge gaps he presumed of his readers or propelled the characters forward if not the action. (I promise that I will bring this one back to the Trail at some point.)  
Do we really need to know Melville’s tortured cetacean taxonomy in Chapter 32, including his assertion that “a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail”? The mammalian status of cetaceans was generally established in the 18th century.  Ishmael our putative narrator is aware of this but rejects it, consigning mammals to land and fish to the sea.  I’m surprised that Melville doesn’t invoke Genesis, since in those preDarwinian days, it was clear that God created fish and birds on the fifth day of Creation, and animals that live on land as well as humans on the sixth, a very busy day indeed.   I wonder if Ishmael would insist that bats are birds?  I have to ask myself, why did Melville include this chapter?  It’s not like he was being paid by the word.  In fact, Moby-Dick was a critical and publishing failure during Melville’s life, selling only 3,000 copies.  He could have written it as a romantic travelogue in the style of Typee and made a mint.
Why was it so important for Ishmael to demammalize whales and reconstitute them as piscine creatures, at the risk of boring generation after generation of readers?  I’m going to hazard a guess, created from whole cloth.  If there is any substance to my conjecture, it is bound to have been written about before.   Melville wrote Moby-Dick in 1850 and 1851, coincident with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act by the United States Congress.  As an ardent abolitionist, Melville was undoubtedly infuriated. While there is racist language used on the Pequod and it permeates Ishmael’s brain, nonetheless the Pequod provides a set for the coming together of the races in mutual dependency.  Except for the key positions of captain and mates who are white though of varying classes, it is skills and talents that earned a crewman’s lay (share of the voyage’s profits) and not color, ethnic background, or religion. Ishmael was a brilliant autodidact and felt things keenly.  He could have extolled the oneness of all things like Walt Whitman, but instead insists on distinguishing fish from mammals.  I suggest that Melville was engaged in parody of the Southern distinction of white and black.  Calling whales fish would make it easier to justify hunting, extended torture, and killing them for the literal enlightenment of white humankind, much as Southerners viewed Africans as inherently inferior to whites and thus suitable for enslavement and brutality.  Combat troops continue to be trained to demonize or dehumanize the enemy, making them easier to kill.  Was this Melville’s point for this overly long chapter?
As a digression from my digression, marking a brief return to the Trail, note that the iron plantations of southeastern Pennsylvania were managed like whaling ships, and except for the ironmaster and key positions, were open to all races.  Like whaling captains, ironmasters were often Quakers and the plantations a safe destination or wayside for runaway slaves.  Ask to see the hidden ladder to the subbasement of the Ironmaster’s Mansion in Pine Grove Furnace State Park, near the halfway point of the Appalachian Trail, where a runaway could be hidden from the slave hunters empowered by the 1850 Act.
There are a couple of other connections between the Appalachian Trail and Moby-Dick, although I realize that this is like playing the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon parlor game.  Melville wrote Moby-Dick while living at his home, Arrowhead, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Mount Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts and crossed by the Appalachian Trail, is clearly visible from the porch of Arrowhead.  Some say the shape of the mountain inspired the White Whale.  Melville occasionally visited the nearby Shaker community in Hancock and witnessed their ecstatic worship.   In Chapter 71 of Moby-Dick, the Pequod meets another Nantucket whaler, The Jeroboam, captained by Mayhew but under the control of a raving lunatic who calls himself The Archangel Gabriel, recently of the first Shaker community established in the United States, north of Albany, New York called Niskayuna, now known as Watervliet.  Gabriel is supposedly based on what Melville observed at Hancock.  Just a few hundred feet from where the AT crosses Jerusalem Road above Tyringham, Massachusetts, there was an active Shaker community from 1792 to 1875.  You may still hear a Shaker hymn in the wind if you camp at the Shaker Campsite, and in keeping with the rules of the post-apocalyptic community, sex is forbidden.  
If I had not been Sugarfoot for more than two decades, I would be tempted to take Ishmael as my trail name.   The first sentence of Moby-Dick, “Call me Ishmael.” establishes the narrator, who will serve as our eyes and ears aboard the Pequod.  I hope to do the same for you on the Trail.  Ishmael never claims that Ishmael is his given name.  Is it his whaling name?  Signing aboard a whaling ship was to be reborn.  Your past could be cast aside and a new identity created.  As I approach my fifth thru-hike attempt, I have to wonder if Katahdin has become my Great White Whale.
Did you know that Ishmael enters into what is perhaps the first gay marriage in literature?  After but one night of sharing a bed, Ishmael marries his hot tattooed cannibal harpooner Queequeg.  From Chapter 10: after the sharing a preprandial pipe, “He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married.” Ishmael continues that Queequeg meant that they were bosom buddies, willing to die for each other, but still as a closeted high school student, I wondered. I suppose Florida high schools no longer teach Moby-Dick, since it might be construed as running afoul of their “Don’t Say Gay” law.  
At any rate, reading Moby-Dick and pondering it on my walks has allowed me to escape from the doldrums.  I’ve made a few changes in my discipline to give me the illusion of progressing toward my goal.  I’ll share those with you in the next episode.  I promise to post it soon, and progress from beginning to end without diving down the rabbit holes that populate my universe.",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659849,"Now that I have escaped my doldrums and avoided sinking into the Slough of Despond, I can proceed with preparing for my thru-hike.  I realized that I need some mini-goals to keep me moving in the right direction.  
My first thought was to review my gear list and eliminate things that are not truly necessary.  Fortunately, my first thought was followed by a second, the realization that the nearer to the start of a hike, the greater the likelihood that gear will be added instead of removed.  Fear and worries often substitute for common sense, leading to bad decisions.  The only redundancy on my current gear list is a few Katahdin Micropur water purification tablets weighing 0.2 ounces, in case my filter dies between towns.  There are a few precautionary ounces, like a repair kit for my sleeping pad and couple of strips of repair tape for my tent.  And I suppose that most of my first aid kit might fall under “what if something happens.”  My head net isn’t needed, at least not until it is needed.  I’m happy with my gear and I’ve used almost everything I carry on past hikes.  The bear canister is the elephant in the backpack but is staying put on principle.  Damn principles; they always get in the way!
Then I had a third thought, that weight reduction doesn’t have to be limited to the contents of my pack but could be more personal.  I don’t worry about my body weight obsessively and neither do my doctors.  My BMI shows me as overweight, but fails to consider the muscle that I carry.  My experience has been that I’ll lose an average of 1/2 pound a day for the first two weeks of a hike, until my hiker appetite engages.  Those two weeks of adjusting to pack weight are precisely when I mind it the most.  So I’ve decided to lose 10-15 pounds before the start of my hike.  I usually start dieting coincident with Lent, which starts February 22 this year, so I’m thinking of my new dietary discipline as pre-Lenten and not a sacred vow to the Most High, more of an aspiration.  My goal is to lose one pound per week.  I don’t believe in magic or trendy diets but rather the old fashioned approach combining calorie reduction and exercise.  I’m already exercising between 20 and 25 hours a week, and that is quite sufficient.  But I can improve my diet, simply by reducing the useless calories I consume.  
When we retired, we decided to limit our booze of choice, gin & tonics, to weekends and special occasions.  The weekends rapidly grew to three nights and I never realized how many special occasions that there are.  For example, today is the anniversary of the marriage of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence in 1236.  And on January 14, 1784, the U.S. Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris with Great Britain that ended the Revolutionary War.  January 14 is the Christian Feast of the Ass, celebrating the Flight into Egypt by the Holy Family evading Herod’s Massacre of the Innocents.  So much to celebrate!  So effective last week, I am limiting my cocktails to two nights a week and only two a night.  Come Lent, those go away as well.  I am really looking forward to a zero day on Easter in Luray, Virginia.  Cheers!
My typical breakfast before walking and going to the Y is a one-egg omelet flavored with whatever is around, usually including sprouts or shoots, folded onto a toasted English Muffin, along with a handful of blueberries.  No more muffins.  My after lunch cookie is also gone.  If it were just one cookie, it wouldn’t matter, but I cannot stop with one cookie and find it easier to have none than one.  And my 4:00 before-dinner snack is severely curtailed, except on drinking nights.  
So far, so good, and I feel like I’m doing something for my hike.
I’ve gotten in the habit of using my AirPods on my morning walks and listening to either NPR Morning Edition or the classical station.  I don’t use them on my hikes and don’t even plan to bring them this year.  The first week of a hike, especially with shorter miles, seems to drag on.  So this year starting with Lent, I will go AirPod-free and count on my ability to daydream for the necessary distraction from the endless steps.  I’ll try to make it a walking meditation and pretend that the linear bike path is actually a labyrinth.  No I won’t.  On days when my body is behaving itself and nothing hurts, my mind floats away to another land and I’m unaware of the miles passing.  Lately, there have been more pain-free days than the other sort when I’m conscious of each step.  I am grateful to Harry the physical therapist for getting me to this point!  This morning I was treated to a pileated woodpecker brilliant against fresh snow and a King Charles Spaniel, kitted out in black snow booties, ecstatic and vigorously wagging his tale 180 degrees.  Actually the spaniel seemed incapable of wagging his tale and settled for sashaying his rear half and the tale moved with it.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659863,"Did you read the recent article in Science and other periodicals about two research teams who have demonstrated the reversibility of epigenetic degenerative changes that typically occur with age and affect a cell’s ability to repair DNA breaks?  Mice could seemingly be aged “forwards and backwards at will,” according to one of the scientists.  Whether a similar mechanism is operative in human cells and could be as easily manipulated remains to be seen, but the possibility is provocative.  I can imagine few things worse than living forever or for a very very long time.  
I’ve been thinking about this because at age 72, I’ve attained the median life expectancy of a male born in 1950.  In other words, half of my male birth cohort is dead.  I’ve been fortunate.  So far medical issues that have surfaced have been dealt with and at the moment there is nothing on the horizon.  My physician, a gerontologist, assures me, however, that I will die from something.  I take great comfort in her words, and yet, I am fascinated by the concept of living for centuries or forever.  You know my fondness for 1950 horror films.  Of all the humanoid creatures, only vampires win my heart, and a part of me wants to believe in their existence.  Werewolves, mummies, zombies?  They do nothing for me.  Neither do space aliens.  In Mars Attacks!, it is the music of Slim Whitman (Indian Love Call) that terrifies me, not the Martians with their death rays.  There is an exception.  I saw The Blob on my eighth birthday and came away convinced that it lived in my closet.  I made a deal with it, that it would stay in my closet if I made sure the closet door was tightly closed at night.  I knew it was capable of oozing under the door and phagocytizing me in my sleep, but I trusted the Blob to be honorable.  The closet door stayed firmly shut until my last year of college, but do we need another digression?
We all have secret fears and develop ways of coping with them, or not.  We pretend that we outgrow them but they always seem to be lurking in the recesses of our minds.  Some are planted by our parents to frighten us into good behavior.  Bogeymen are found in nearly every language and let us not forget to give credit to the Devil!  Children and adults are quite capable of manufacturing their own monsters in nightmares. Are they condensations of our own anxieties or something more, nighttime visitations from the beyond? And let us not forget the succubus and incubus that appear in dreams to seduce men and women.
Among my favorites are the ama yvwigisgi, water cannibals of the Cherokee, spirits who live at the bottom of deep rivers and live upon human flesh, particularly tender children.  They emerge at daybreak, going invisibly from house to house until they find someone still asleep.  They shoot the lazy lout with invisible arrows and carry the corpse down under the water for breakfast, replacing the body with a zombie who seems to be alive but who withers away and dies in seven days.  Sleeping late has its hazards!  Ethnographer James Mooney collected this story and included it in his Myths of the Cherokee (1902).
As a little kid, I had recurrent nightmares featuring a pistol-toting pirate and would wake up in terror.  I taught myself what I now recognize as lucid dreaming so that I could intervene in my own dreams without awakening.  I discovered I could fly but pirates could not, so I had my escape.  The pirate soon lost interest in me and went on to haunt other kids, but then a few years ago he was back.  Only this time instead of flying away, I confronted him, grabbed his pistol and shot him.  The fierce buccaneer only laughed, saying, “You can’t kill me; I’m you!”  Wouldn’t Carl Jung have loved this dream?
One of the reasons I love long backpacking trips is that I sleep so well in the woods.  Part is undoubtedly sheer exhaustion after a day spent walking.  Part too is that the air temperature usually falls at night, as does my body temperature, so that I’m comfortable throughout the night.  At home, I often awaken feeling too warm in the middle of the night.  Also, my frequency of vivid dreams, dreams that seem so real and are easily recalled in detail, is much higher in the woods.  I feel so sorry for people who don’t remember their dreams!
There are many people and even hikers who fear night in the woods, especially if they are alone.  Every night sound is threatening!  Even if you know it is the call of a barred owl, it can still send chills up your spine.  A tree frog being rotated by a snake before being swallowed head first can cry like a human baby. Tree limbs rubbing together in a breeze are the creakiest hinges of the most haunted house.  So many things go bump in the night!  Footsteps or breaking twigs near your tent are the worst, especially if there is the sound of heavy breathing.  I can sleep through them all, with one exception — the whippoorwill.  How I loathe this creature!  We all have visions of hell perhaps replete with fiery brimstone and demons torturing sinners with hot pokers.  Hieronymus Bosch’s scenes of hell, very popular in the 16th century, now seem incredibly surrealistic but still not a dream vacation.  My personal hell features an inviting bed, but every time I lie down to sleep, a symphony of whippoorwills commences making sleep impossible.  Then suddenly it stops, just long enough for my eyes to close, before starting again with renewed vigor.  If you have hiked overnight in the Eastern woods and haven’t heard a whippoorwill, consider yourself blessed and offer sacrifice at once.  
So sleep well in the woods at night.  Aside from the occasional cannibal spirit, ravenous bear, eighteen-foot boa, murderous night hiker, and mad geneticist out to manipulate your epigenome, what is there to fear?  Pleasant dreams!",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659919,"On rare occasions, things work out the way you wish they always would.  On the trail, one of the best feelings is to have gotten into a shelter, fetched your water, switched from your hiking shoes into sandals, changed into camp clothes (long underwear), and just settled down to decide which noodles to cook for dinner, when all hell breaks loose and a major thunderstorm with marble-sized hail moves in.  Is it being in tune with the universe, being where you ought to be when you ought to be there?  Is it due to the intervention of your guardian angel or divine providence?  Is it planning?  Is it luck?  I’m inclined toward the latter, but whenever it happens, I feel grateful and abundantly joyful.  I try not to let it show when soaked hikers come running into the shelter looking like wet cats.
I had a mini-version of that this morning.  We had about three inches of wet heavy snow last night, on top of the slushy mess we still had from the last storm.  Our trusted TV meteorologist Gary said that we were between systems and a second batch of snow would move in around 8:00.  I knew that the bike path wouldn’t be plowed yet so it wasn’t a good morning for a long walk.  After breakfast, I did some light stretching and walked down to the Y.  Legs are so much easier to work without walking several miles first!  Then I went over to the food co-op for a few things I needed for dinner.  The weather has been so dreary that when I made my grocery list for shopping yesterday, I had decided to make tonight a comfort meal of corned beef and cabbage, with potatoes and carrots.  I even verified online that corned beef brisket was in stock, although I had to drive to a different Hannaford than my usual for it.  Naturally they didn’t have it and probably won’t until nearer to St. Patrick’s Day.  So I bought a chuck roast and a bottle of Malbec, thinking that Yankee pot roast and cabbage would be almost as good.  I forgot to buy onions, celery and beef broth, so I needed to pick them up this morning.  I got home from the Y and City Market a few minutes before 8:00, just as the first snowflakes fell.  What a wonderful feeling!  Of course, I would much rather walk through snow than a thunderstorm, but it still feels like a blessing not to have to.  And now I’m thinking that it’s for the best that corned beef wasn’t available.  We don’t need the salt bomb and besides, this way once the pot roast is simmering in the oven this afternoon, I’ll have an open bottle of wine calling to me.  I’ve recorded a NOVA and a new Nature episode.  Between them and Moby-Dick, aided by the Malbec, I should be guaranteed a good nap.  The Universe is a nice place today.  
The blessings of life are all around us, if we take the time to notice.  In ordinary life, it is easy to take them for granted and ignore them altogether, or to somehow think we earned them.  On the trail, with the enforced drudgery of the daily routine (wake, eat, hike, eat, hike, make camp, eat, sleep), blessings stand out like a billboard for Stuckey’s on old Highway 301, before the interstate highways went it.
First and foremost for me are meeting other hikers, whether day hikers, section hikers or thru-hikers.  Especially in the olden days, before the Appalachian Trail became relatively popular, meeting someone was a treasure.  I often hiked solo out-of-season and saw people mostly on the weekends or in town.  Every one of them had a story and freely shared it with minimal prompting.  This is especially true of someone hiking in the opposite direction who chances are would never see you again.  I’ve even had townspeople confess horrible secrets to me, making me the classic scapegoat, receiving their sins and carrying them off into the wilderness.  Sometimes when I got back into the woods, I would open my arms from my chest with my hands open, and imagine their little sins running off into the undergrowth to live happily ever after.  There are times when you immediately connect with someone and sometimes remain friends for years.  Sometimes if I have trouble falling asleep at night, I will think of them in order, starting with Skinny Badger and Dances with Hooves from 1994 and ending with Ness from last year.  Of course, there have been people that I wish I had not met but they are tiny fraction.  I had the honor to meet Gene Robinson who in 2003 was the first openly gay Episcopal priest to be consecrated as bishop.  He faced death threats and at times had to wear body armor.  He told the story of people getting in his face and yelling obscenities at him.  Gene says that he would mentally step back and think, “Oh, Lord, I’m going to be with this person for eternity.  Help me to find something to love about them.”  I do try, but isn’t always easy. 
Trail magic is an obvious blessing.  I don’t think I can improve on The Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s definition of trail magic:  Finding what you need most when you least expect it; Experiencing something rare, extraordinary, or inspiring in nature; Encountering unexpected acts of generosity, that restore one’s faith in humanity.  A few examples will suffice.  Early in my hike last spring, the piezo-electric ignitor on my stove failed and I found that I had lost my mini-Bic lighter somewhere along the way.  The next morning, I found a full-sized Bic lighter, in blue, my favorite color, in the middle of the trail.  That evening at Dahlgren Campground, a facility provided by the State of Maryland that includes free hot showers, I was talking with a newly wed couple at an adjacent tent site.  The guy had lost his lighter that day, but he told me to keep it because he had a spare.  They were on their honeymoon, so I spontaneously invited them to dinner at the nearby Old South Mountain Inn.  I not only received magic but I got to give it, making me a trail angel, and I hope, giving them a story they will remember in future years of happy marriage. Trail magic frequently involves food, but it can be a day hiker at a trail head offering a ride into town and refusing to accept compensation or someone who comes along after you’ve fallen and extends a hand to help you up.  It can be a shy smile that warms your heart.   And of course, trail magic extends to the work of countless volunteers who maintain the Appalachian Trail.  Trail magic can be the clean smell and blindingly white clothes of a day hiker.  
That towns near the trail welcome and even celebrate us is magic as well.  It’s true that we contribute to their economy, but does that outweigh our slovenly appearance and matching aroma and the impression of the town we leave on civilized visitors?   Yet they put up with us and in many cases go out of their way to offer us rides and even sometimes a home-cooked meal.
For many, perhaps most, AT hikers, it’s the grand vistas from above treeline in New Hampshire and Maine that are most magical.  For me, it’s the dense forests of Virginia south and Vermont.    That second and third growth forest can be so magnificent awes me, and the few remnant patches of old growth sing to my soul.  The song of a wood thrush or a hermit thrush is the grandest alleluia.
Gratitude is the natural response to trail magic, gratitude to the angels and the birds, and gratitude that we live in a world filled with beauty.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659943,"I got to check two items off my thru-hike checklist!  Six days ago, I downloaded the 2023 Edition of the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers’ Companion, and since then I’ve updated my hike planning spreadsheet, pictured to the left or above.  Click on it to see if full-sized.  It continues to Katahdin and I have a separate spreadsheet for the southbound hike. I also finished reading Moby-Dick, but that wasn’t a checklist item.
I described the first section pictured here, from Waynesboro to Luray, Virginia, in my January 1 entry.  It isn’t a requirement to even plan a section at a time.  I could just leave town with five days of food and wing it.  Except for the Hundred Mile Wilderness in Maine, from Monson to Katahdin, that’s probably enough to get me to the next town.  Even then, I could arrange for a food drop half-way through the Wilderness.  But I would hate to carry the weight of extra food when I only need three days.   For me, planning is essential and it’s something I enjoy.  I have the time, and it lets me relive past hikes.  I try not to view my plan as  much more than a suggestion for what I might do.  That said, with decades of experience, I’ve gotten pretty good at knowing what I am capable of doing and will want to do.  
My fondness for spreadsheets predates my career as a CPA.  In the early 1980’s, I taught spreadsheeting for a local computer store in Sarasota, Florida where I lived at the time.  The SuperCalc software predated Lotus 123 and was way before Excel or Numbers.  It ran on the CP/M operating system on 8-bit computers.  Even mentioning that makes me feel like a dinosaur, having lived in a long vanished paradise of 8” floppy disks, when the maximum sector of a hard drive was 5 MB.  Punch cards, anyone?  I actually ran a service business under those constraints, designing a customer and service database, service reminders, price calculations, and the entire accounts receivable function.  Consider that today the Apple Series 8 watch runs on a 64-bit dual-core processor and has 32GB memory capacity with 1GB RAM.  It’s been amazing to watch the continued innovation.  Do I sometimes get nostalgic for the slide rule I carried in high school?  No way! 
So it’s natural that I would plan my hikes using a spreadsheet.  They used to be very simple, just a listing of daily destinations and daily mileage.  The current iteration is two years old.  In the upper left, I enter my start date (actually my leaving home date) and the 2023 length of the Appalachian Trail, 2,198.4 miles.  Down the left hand side, I list shelters, tent sites, potable water sources, and features that interest me, many involving food.  This isn’t intended for on-the-trail navigation but to assist me in planning my hike.  The “Miles from Springer” column matches the 2023 Companion.  Eventually FarOut will update its mileages, although in 2022, they never did south of Daleville, Virginia.  The mileage figures south of New York were unchanged in 2023.  Starting in New York, I was able to update the 2022 figures with a simple addition formula into an empty row and then use a copy and paste formula results back into the second column, with occasional adjustments, like for the relocation of a Vermont shelter.  Obviously, the Miles from Katahdin is a subtraction, using the total miles figure.  I then reviewed both the Companion and FarOut for changes in trail services, like new hostels, unofficial campsites included in FarOut, and restaurants convenient to the trail.  The Day column is constructed so that when I enter the day of the hike, the date pops up in the next column, formatted with day of the week and date.  I chose this format because I find that I often lose track of the day of the week while hiking.  It’s important to know since many restaurants are closed on Mondays.  i would hate to walk 1/2 mile off the trail only to find that the restaurant closed.  The miles are calculated by looking up the previous day and subtracting the mileage from Springer on the previous day from the current day.  I’ve constructed it so that fields not on a row with a day entry are blank, so the display isn’t cluttered with useless information.  There’s a hidden column where I track zero days, meaning that the distance from Springer is unchanged on consecutive days.  The Days Food column is manually entered, roughly what I need to buy.  At the bottom of the spreadsheets, I calculate statistics, like average miles per day, with and without zero days.  The average of 11.4 miles a day is actually ambitious for me.  I would prefer to limit the first week to 8 to 10 miles a day, but that’s not how the shelters are spaced.
I use the actual columns as I go along, and at the end of a hike, I can compare what I did to what I had planned, hopefully gaining feedback for my next hike.  I can also use the actual columns to play “what if,” like if I’m in Duncannon, I can play with the days to Port Clinton so that I arrive when the post office is open (M-F 12:30-4:30, Sa 8:00-11:00) and when I can get French fries at the Port Clinton Hotel.  The hotel and restaurant are closed on Mondays and their hand-cut French fries are the only redeeming virtue of the town. My first visit to Port Clinton was in 1998.  It was a Saturday afternoon after the Post Office had closed.  I had to wait until Monday afternoon to retrieve it.  All I could find to read was a single Louis L’Amour western which did nothing for my mood.  I won’t be sending a mail drop there this year and will probably shuttle to the Microtel by a Walmart for reprovision.
Using a spreadsheet like this is certainly not typical of thru-hikers.  You get to decide whether I am nerd, geek, dork, dweeb or some chimeric hybrid.",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659989,"I came down with a cold four days ago.  I do not do sick well, having had relatively little experience with it.  I just wanted to crawl into a hole, pull it in after myself, and hide away with a box of soft tissues (not the ones with lotion, please), a trashy book, and Diet Vernor’s Ginger Ale.  I haven’t found Vernor’s locally, although I haven’t made a comprehensive search for it.  Canada Dry is a poor substitute.   My symptoms were confined to sinus congestion and sneezing.  No fever, no cough, no muscle aches, no changes in taste or smell, no swollen lymph glands and my lungs remained clear.  I suppose it could be Covid-19, but I don’t have a test kit and since I’m getting better, I can do without the bragging rights.  Either way, I’m staying away from people.  If you are wondering, yes, I am fully vaccinated and boosted.  Today I’m feeling human again and well enough for some light exercise.  
Ever wonder what you would do if you come down with something like a cold while hiking the Appalachian Trail?   The last time I had so much as a sniffle was on my 2018 AT thru-hike attempt.  It manifested itself with very similar symptoms as this one when I was a couple of days north of Port Clinton in Pennsylvania.  I’ll resist blaming it on Port Clinton since I didn’t spend a night there.  A friend who is an architectural historian rescued me and spent a few days teaching me the differences between English and German colonial design, with a few Swedish structures thrown in for extra credit.  With my beard and coming from Sarasota, Florida, a popular retirement and winter destination for Anabaptists, I was taken for lapsed Amish.  The real Amish were scandalized when I told them that their Pinecraft brethren peddled large tricycles instead of driving buggies.  
It was horrible being sick on the trail.  I had two bandanas and would wash one out and hang it off the back of my pack to dry until the other became too gross for another sneeze. I tented to avoid others, and had no choice but to reduce mileage.  My lungs were involved and getting up the hills was at glacial speed.  I went into Wind Gap, about 15 trail miles south of Delaware Water Gap.  St. Luke’s Hospital runs a walk-in clinic there. The physician’s assistant who treated me confirmed that I had an URI, which at first scared me, until he translated it as ‘Upper Respiratory Infection” or a summer cold.  Professional use of acronyms should have a diagnostic code of its own.  He suggested that I take a Zyrtec before bed and use an Albuterol inhaler on the hills.  Following his suggestions and having had the house-made chicken soup and a grilled cheese sandwich at the Gap Diner for dinner, I cruised into Delaware Water Gap the next day and took a zero.  I credit the live jazz and excellent grilled lobster salad at the Deer Head Inn for cementing my cure.  
Except in the Hundred Mile Wilderness in Maine, from Monson to Katahdin, you are never far from a road crossing on the Appalachian Trail.  And roads always lead somewhere where you can rest and get medical attention if needed.  I had previously been diagnosed with cold-onset exercise-induced asthma from a problem on a hike years ago but hadn’t had another incident.  Since the 2018 incident, I now carry an Albuterol inhaler and few Zyrtec tablets in my first aid kit. I have contracted poison ivy on a couple of hikes, once badly enough to require Prednisone.  So I carry a current prescription for that on my hikes.  Like the Albuterol, carrying it seems to have worked because I haven’t needed it since.
Those are the only illnesses I’ve ever had on the trail in over 25 years of long section hikes.  I contracted Lyme Disease on a hike in Vermont but I was home before it hit and started a course of doxycycline, rapidly resolving the symptoms.  That would have been miserable on the trail since doxycycline has an unfortunate side effect of extreme light sensitivity.  A member of my 2018 tramily contracted two tickborne diseases, Anaplasmosis and Babesiosis, and ended up hospitalized.  He took every possible precaution, including treating his clothing with Permethrin, applying DEET (I prefer Picaridin) to exposed skin, and a careful self-examination at night.   If you want to scare yourself about ticks, please visit https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/diseases/index.html.
Then there were various hikes curtailed by problems with my knees or last year the sciatic nerve.  I don’t count these as illnesses but more as mechanical problems that replacements and physical therapy resolved.  I hope.  
Other common Appalachian Trail ailments include Norovirus (cutely called Spewmageddon) and Giardia (misnamed Beaver Fever), both offering a roller coaster ride of alternating nausea and diarrhea, sometimes simultaneously.   Norovirus usually passes on its own in 1 to 3 days.  The greatest risk is dehydration, treated with lots of fluids and possibly an oral rehydration solution like Pedialyte.  The best preventatives are good hygiene, including hand washing and avoiding sharing food with others. Giardia may resolve spontaneously, even explosively, or may need treatment with an antibiotic or antiparasitic medication, and some remain asymptomatic spreaders.  Delightful!  Water filtration, even if the water looks clean, is the best preventative.  
Blisters, chafing, sprains, cuts, hypothermia, hyperthermia, dehydration, sunburn, bee stings and bug bites can happen anywhere, and for the most part, are easily treated with minimal first aid supplies and a basic knowledge of first aid, but in their more severe forms require medical intervention.  If you are allergic to bee stings, carry an autoinjector and tell your hiking companion where you keep it.   Events like broken bones and frostbite require off-trail treatment.  As much as I gripe about the number of hikers on the AT, having others around can be very helpful in an emergency, even if only for their hiking to a place with cellphone reception and calling 911.  Heart attack survivors have hiked the AT, but having a heart attack on the AT is usually fatal.  If you are an older adult, checking with your doctor before embarking on a long hike is a good precaution, and if you experience symptoms that may be cardiac-related, don’t delay in calling for help!  Carrying a satellite communicator is not uncommon.  The Garmin InReach Mini 2 weighs 3.5 oz.  The iPhone 14 includes emergency satellite SOS.  My iPhone X is failing and I plan to replace it with an iPhone 14 before my hike.  I will disable the Fall Detection, however, so an SOS is not sent every time I trip over my own two feet.  
Being sick on the Appalachian Trial is no fun.  Neither is being sick at home.  What’s the worst that can happen to me?  I can die.  Whether I die at home with my loved one or die in the embrace of Nature, the result is the same.  And I can live with that.",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660058,"This is a good day to write a journal entry.  I have plenty of time since I’m not out walking.  Why not?  Last week’s head cold is in the past.  At the insistence of a Wisconsin friend, I stopped by CVS and picked up a supply of Covid tests.  I tested negative.  No, it’s another kind of cold that is keeping me indoors.  My limit for walking is windchill of minus 20.  Coming home from the Y yesterday, the ambient temperature was minus 2* and the windchill minus 25*.   I wore the right layers and used my Buff as a face mask.  Even so, that was too cold for wimpy me.  This morning is minus 15* and the windchill is minus 40*.  That’s cold even by Vermont standards.  I’ll do my exercising at home while giving thanks for central heat and for not being on the summit of Mount Washington, where the windchill is minus 108*. 
Last week, Delta Airlines emailed me with a change to my flight schedule.  This was the second change. Back in December, my departure from Burlington was moved up to 8:15 am from 8:30 am and I would have gotten to Charlottesville at 1:39 pm instead of 2.35 pm, reducing my layover at LaGuardia to only 2 hours and 23 minutes, which is about right, given the time it takes to change concourses at the remodeled LaGuardia.  Last week’s proposed change wasn’t as pleasant.  I would face six hours at LaGuardia and not arrive in Charlottesville until about 5:30 pm, too late to stop at Rockfish Gap Outfitters for fuel.   Following Delta’s instructions, I logged into my account and brought up my flight.  I clicked “change flight” and an alternative was presented of leaving Burlington at 6:00 am and arriving in Charlottesville at 12:52 pm.  One more click to accept and a couple more to select my seats, and I was set.  Plus, my credit card was instantly credited with $60 since this was a less expensive flight.  Once again, Delta came through for me, reinforcing their status as my favorite airline.  I have no problem with leaving so early since I’m an early riser anyway, and I’ll enjoy flying through Atlanta again. 
That may strike many of you as odd.  Atlanta is the busiest airport in the world, but I think of it as almost a second home.  When I lived in Sarasota, flying meant Delta 90% of the time, and that almost always meant changing planes in Atlanta.  When I served on the board of ATC back in its Appalachian Trail Conference incarnation, I was flying to Washington Dulles a minimum of four times a year and sometimes as many as eight times.  Plus I had one annual business trip to a tax conference and at least one trip for a hike.  This was back when 24 flight segments qualified for Medallion Level on Delta.  Changing planes in Atlanta meant that each trip was four segments.  I was frequently upgraded to first class and used my Delta SkyMiles to maintain a membership in the Crown Room.  With the current rules, Medallion Level and the Crown Room are out of reach for me, but even so, I still find the Atlanta Airport very pleasant.  Changing concourses is fast and efficient, and there is always a new place to eat. Plus Krispy Kreme Donuts is on Concourses B, C and D!   They are worth eating if the “Hot Now!” neon sign is flashing.  
Most of my hikes have started and ended with a flight, although I’ve used Amtrak if the schedule works out.  Amtrak business class or especially a roomette is a very pleasant way to travel and assures that I arrive rested and relaxed.  It doesn’t work for this hike, but I will use Amtrak for a short visit home from somewhere around the Hudson River.  The Ethan Allen Express puts me at the bottom of the hill where I live.  Travel on Amtrak is subject to the same TSA restrictions as flying, the difference being that it is totally unenforced, meaning that I can travel with a fuel canister and my sharp-tipped trekking poles.  Also, I can keep my pack with me so I don’t have to worry about the airline losing my checked pack.  That only happened to me once, on U.S Airways which at the time served West Lebanon, New Hampshire, near Hanover.  Our tiny plane’s luggage ended up in Presque Isle, Maine and we had theirs.  The pack was returned to me that evening, but I lost a day’s hiking and had to pay for a night’s lodging, which was very expensive because it was Dartmouth’s first-year orientation weekend.  
For several years, I used an ultralight Zpacks backpack and feared that it might be damaged by the airline.  So I purchased a pack duffel, the Osprey Airporter.  Zpacks now offers an ultralight pack duffel.  With the heavier duty ULA Equipment Circuit, it really isn’t needed, but I still use it on the way to a hike, when various items of gear and my hiking poles are attached to the outside of the pack.  I mail the duffel home via Priority Mail.  Returning from a hike, there is plenty of room in my bear canister for all of the external goodies and my disassembled poles fit inside the pack.  I tighten all of the straps and wrap the ends around the straps, so there are as few dangling things as possible to snag on the luggage handling equipment.  It hasn’t been a problem.  
One reason I’ve often started or ended hikes in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia is that it is served by Amtrak as well as a commuter rail service to Union Station in Washington, D.C.  Going home, I can catch the 5:30 am Marc train to Union Station in time for the Amtrak Vermonter to Essex Junction, about 20 minutes from my home.  Or I can book the Northeast Corridor to New York City and take the Ethan Allen Express.  From Union Station, the Metro subway connects to both National Airport and Dulles Airport.  There is late afternoon and evening service from Union Station to Harpers Ferry.  
Getting to or from other airports or train stations is a little trickier and usually involves engaging a shuttler or relying on taxi services, Uber, or Lyft.  Both whiteblaze.net and The Trek maintain lists of shuttle drivers:  https://www.whiteblaze.net/forum/articles/2022-shuttles.pdf and https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/accessing-the-appalachian-trail-shuttles-buses-taxis/.  Some shuttle drivers are included in The Appalachian Trail Thru Hikers’ Companion and the FarOut app, especially in the comments section.  Also outfitters, hostels and B&B’s can frequently arrange shuttles.  Cash is appreciated by most shuttle drivers.  
There is direct bus service from Boston’s Logan Airport to Hanover, Gorham, and Pinkham Notch, New Hampshire.  It’s a little tricky, but you can get from New York City’s major airports to Grand Central Station and catch Metro train service to various towns in New York near the trail, including Port Jervis, Garrison, Pawling, Poughkeepsie, and Peekskill.  There’s even limited weekend service to the Appalachian Trail Train Station near Pawling.  Bus service is available from Port Authority to Bear Mountain Inn and Greenwood Lake.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660109,"In 2021, Nimblewill Nomad, M.J. Eberhart, completed a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail at age 83, claiming the oldest thru-hiker record from Grey Beard, Dale Sanders, who thru-hiked in 2017 at age 82.  I still have twelve more years before I can try for the record.  There’s a part of me that wants to do it, even if I need a crew of supporters to minimize my pack weight and nights on the trail.  It would be a grand thumbing-of-my-nose to all of those kids who taunted me as sissy and spastic all through school.  
They weren’t wrong, in that I was afraid of so many things and never could throw a ball or climb a robe, but it was how they said it, like being unathletic, clumsy and having no interest in sports made me less of a man, a certainty in their eyes, and less of a person.  It may have factored into my choice of a college that had no athletic department and no required physical education.  New College in Sarasota, Florida was paradise for me.  
I was in the fourth entering class and it was still operating on the “learning hotel model,” where students checked in, had interaction with brilliant students and faculty, cleared a few academic hurdles including a baccalaureate thesis, and checked out with a Bachelor of Arts degree.  A transcript was optional and there were no grades or rankings.  This was even before the creation of the myth that it was named after New College, Oxford, for its emphasis on tutorials and seminars.  In truth it was really “A New College,” waiting for a wealthy donor to claim the naming rights.  Failing to attract such a donor, New College was forced to merge into the University of South Florida until it became an independent unit of the state university system as New College of Florida, serving as the honors college of the state.   It had to add more structure as it grew, but even so it retained its quirkiness, its focus on independent scholarship, and its national reputation for excellence.  I intentionally use the past tense, because Florida Governor DeSantis has loaded the board of trustees with conservative appointments, fired the college president, and seemingly embarked on a course to change it into a southern outpost of conservative Christian Hillsdale College, complete with a Great Books program.  I only hope that they have the decency to rename it.
Returning to my topic, being taunted in school, and this was before gay and faggot became common put downs, gave me a certain sensitivity to language and stereotypes.  I thought I had gotten past that, when suddenly it returned in a different way when I retired.   One of the most common cocktail party questions is, “What do you do?”  Even before retirement, I hated answering, because I never felt that “I’m a CPA"" said anything about me.  But it was an acceptable answer, allowing the questioner to know what box I belonged in.  It was far worse once I retired.  Saying “I’m retired,” ends the conversation.  Only rarely is there a followup “What did you do before retirement?”   I’ve been consigned to the retired, waiting for the Grim Reaper box, and what more is there to say?  I guess I should be glad that thus far I’ve been spared the super loud well-enunciated voice and being called dearie, gramps, good boy or other tokens of Elderspeak.    
I reached the age of invisibility a couple of decades ago at the Y, when I could gaze at the eye candy with impunity and not even be noticed, because I’m just another old man.  Last year, I started my spring hike with a flight to Washington National Airport.  On the Metro to Union Station, I was offered seats twice, even though I was wearing a full backpack. And once at one of the Mt. Wilcox shelters in Massachusetts, a Boy Scout offered to fetch water for me.  Sure, why not?  I hope he earned a merit badge for his unnecessary kindness.  Sometimes, the school crossing guards here insist upon helping me across the street on my daily walk.  Am I really so decrepit?  
I seem to be learning the art of looking befuddled and pathetic and using it to my advantage.  On Monday, I did my homework on the four iPhone 14 models, deciding that I wanted the iPhone 14 Pro, because it has the smaller screen and superior telephoto lenses.  I could have ordered the phone directly from Apple, and they were offering a trade-in on my dying iPhone XR of $150.  Nevertheless, I made an appointment for the next day at the Verizon store.  The sales representative I was assigned, John, was very nice and seemed determined to be kind to the helpless old man.  I let him.  He guided me through the model decision process, reaching the same conclusion that I had in about double the time it had taken me.  I mentioned that I had heard that there were sometimes trade-ins for old phones.  He spent another half-hour researching every combination and permutation available through Verizon eventually coming up with credits of $840, which would have covered the base iPhone 14 model.  He then proceeded to spend another twenty minutes optimizing the plan we have on our three lines for a monthly savings.  I wanted a case and screen cover, which he installed. John explained that if I ordered a third accessory, I would receive a discount and actually pay less.  So now I have a redundant wall adapter that actually saved me $5 over just the two accessories.  Then John insisted on handling the transfer to my new phone from my old phone for a minimal fee.  I’ve done it before in the past, but that was before I was a senile senior.  John walked me out to my car, I suppose because he was afraid I would totter off the curb and fall down.  I thanked him profusely for the over two hours of his time and assured him that with the savings he had found, I would be able to eat this month. If you run into me on the trail this year, please don’t call me a senior citizen or a geezer or accuse of being spry, feisty, or spirited.  On the other hand, if you want to fetch my water, set my tent, cook my dinner, or massage my feet, more power to you.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Fri",0

2Packs wrote about his struggles to refrain from offering advice to other hikers, even when he knows absolutely positively that he is right.  Your might get away with offering a hand, but anything more, like, “You might have more success if you try it this way,” or “Hanging your food  six feet off the ground isn’t a very good idea,” is skating on thin ice.  Especially here in northern New England with global warming, thin ice is a danger to be respected.  Two brothers intending to icefish on Lake Champlain, along with their ATV, perished in the last couple of weeks.  I don’t want to copy 2Packs, but I would like to flip it around and write about the other side of Hike Your Own Hike, namely relying upon yourself and not asking or taking advice from other hikers. Doing things the way that others do quickly becomes hiking someone else’s hike and not your own.  I’ll extend it to borrowing gear from others instead of relying upon what you brought with you.  In my 2018 tramily, we modified HYOH to Hike Your Own Hike and Carry Your Own S**t, which is a fair approximation of Shakespeare’s “Neither a borrower nor a lender be.”   
Imposter syndrome, which is common in people other than extreme narcissists, is self-doubt ratcheted up a few notches, so that that you question your own skills, talents, and achievements and live in fear that others may come to know you as a faker or a fraud.  It’s the fear of exposure, that others will realize what you believe about yourself, that you are not good enough, talented enough, or worthy enough to be praised or loved by others.  Raise your hand if this describes you, even just a little bit.  The article hit home for me.  My upbringing couldn’t have been more calculated to inculcate self-doubt.  I’m sure my parents were just repeating what they had known, but it took more than a couple of decades of good friends and therapists to overwrite things.  As a kid, I would lip-sync rather than sing out loud in class.  I would make myself sick rather than give a book report in front of the class.  It turns out that I have a decent voice and am an effective public speaker.  
I’ll press pause now and give you an update on progress toward my thru-hike.  The first week of my hike was pretty set except that I’ve been debating whether to spend my sixth night at Rock Spring Hut or press on to Skyland.  Skyland Resort opens for the season on the day I would arrive and I know that I would need a reservation, but I also know that cell phone reception is weak in Shenandoah National Park.  I’ve been going back and forth in my thinking.  Staying at Rock Spring Hut would mean a 12.2 mile day, plus a mile roundtrip to Big Meadows Wayside, and 14.1 miles the next day to Thornton Gap for a shuttle into Luray.  Staying at Skyland would mean 16.8 miles but only 9.5 to Thornton Gap.  Oh, what to do?  Fortunately for me, the same thaw that cost the fisherfolk their lives also melted the ice on the bike path.  I was able to wear my trail running shoes instead of boots and Nanospikes and walked 13 miles on Wednesday.  Could I have walked another four miles, knowing that there was good food awaiting me?  No problem, and I wasn’t even sore on Thursday.  So I’ve made reservations for a cabin at Lewis Mountain on April 6 and Skyland on April 7.  Having my itinerary set, let me complete the online permit required for backcountry camping in Shenandoah National Park.  You can fill out the carbonized form manually at kiosks at the northern and southern entrances to the park, but it’s much easier to deal with online.  I also emailed Alison at Open Arms at the Edge of Town Hostel in Luray to reserve a bed for the nights of April 8 and 9.  My walk confirmed to me that the larger size 11 Altra Olympus shoes are perfect for me, so I ordered another pair along with SuperFeet Insoles so Tom can mail them to me when I need them.  I’m hoping that the first pair will last 550 miles, to the Hudson River and my visit home, but I’m not expecting that given the rocks of Pennsylvania.  As long as I was ordering from REI, I ordered four Mountain House freeze-dried dinners.  It’s hard to find single portion dinners and until my hiker appetite kicks in, that’s the size I need.  And finally, I ordered an MSR Handheld Piezo Igniter for my stove.  I’ll still carry a Mini-BIC lighter in my first aid kit, for sterilizing a needle to pop the blisters I hope not to have.  
As nice as it is to have these pre-hike chores dealt with, it is far better to have had the reminder courtesy of 2-Packs and The New Yorker that this is my hike and the greatest obstacle to achieving it is my own self-doubt.  I will hold the Cowardly Lion front and center in my mind and whenever I feel doubt intruding will say aloud, “I do believe in myself, I do believe in myself, I do, I do, I do, I do!”  And I will ignore the Wicked Witch of the West.  To well meaning hikers offering unwanted advice, I will sagely nod, thank them for their concern. and proceed to do things my way.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660216,"Today is Ash Wednesday and marks the start of Lent, a forty-day period of preparation for the great feast of Easter.  If you are interested in the religious and spiritual meaning and practices of Lent, you can research it yourself.  Suffice it to say that it’s about more than chocolate bunnies and heaven forbid, Peeps.  Peeps, along with Circus Peanuts, are my two least favorite candies.   I’m not a big fan of peanut butter, so my third would be Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. It’s not my intention to evangelize or proselytize about either my religion or my candy preferences (dark chocolate, by the way), and certainly trailjournals.com is not the place for it.  But both religion and chocolate are important to me and so I’ll share them with you.  If my mention of either religion or chocolate in connection with the Trail offends you, go ahead and skip this entry.  
My pre-Lenten discipline of reducing my consumption of gin and cookies did not go so well.  I lost a couple of pounds but not the ten I was hoping for.  So now it’s time to up my game. Starting today, sweets and other empty calories are off my diet.  I finished my Valentine’s chocolate truffles yesterday.  No more gin & tonics, not even with Diet Tonic.  No more sweets.  We had our little private Mardi Gras feast yesterday, so today at least, I’m not tempted.  I find it much easier to go cold turkey than to limit myself to one after-lunch cookie or one Friday night drink.  Going cold turkey avoids such weighty philosophical disputes as whether cookie crumbs or broken cookies count and whether freshening a drink is permitted.  Better to make a clean break of it.  I will continue this through the first week of my hike, which coincides with the last week of Lent, Holy Week.  But I fully intend to devote myself to gustatory debauchery on my first zero day, Easter Sunday, in Luray.
Starting this morning, I am leaving my AirPods at home and walking in silence.  I won’t be bringing them on the hike this year so I might as well get used to it.  Spending time listening to nothing is prayer of a sort.  I’ve gotten lazy and accustomed to being distracted and entertained instead of relying on my own imagination.  There’s a whole other universe in silence, just waiting to be explored.  I don’t think I will miss the AirPods on my walk, but I’m not looking forward to working out at the Y without them.  Silence is one thing but overhearing inane conversation is something else entirely.
Lent really isn’t about giving up things, like sweets, booze, and AirPods, except to the extent that it creates a space for something else. I take no pleasure in self-deprivation, and I’m not about to replace my wicking inner layer with a hair shirt or to take up self-flagellation.  
In college, I started saying the Daily Office, usually Matins, as a discipline.  It’s a way of marking the passage of time and participating in an ancient rite dating back millennia, probably having its roots in Jewish temple worship.  When I moved to Burlington, I found a small group of five or six people meeting at the Episcopal Cathedral at 8:30 to say Matins on weekdays.  I would walk down there after the Y and then return home for breakfast. This was before my knee replacements and I was limited in the distance I could walk without pain.  When Covid came on the scene, Matins became a Zoom service.  Instead of meeting in a small chapel, breathing the same air and sharing a common cadence, it became Hollywood Squares.  I put Zoom in the same category as Peeps.  I reverted to saying Matins alone, and I confess that I’ve gotten very sloppy about it, often skipping the canticles and shortcutting the prayers.  So as part of my Lenten discipline, I will follow the rubrics and do it right.  Timing wise, I prefer to say it after my morning walk, workout at the Y, and after a snack of grapes or some other fruit.  On the Trail, I defer it until the end of the day and make it Vespers.  I’m always anxious to start my hike early and would be tempted to rush Matins.   I find Vespers a nice way to close out the day after making camp, before dinner.
Aside from foregoing sweets and alcohol, I won’t be fasting during Lent and especially not during the first week of my hike.  I admire those who fast every day during Ramadan, the entire 24 hours of Yom Kippur, and for those Christians who subsist off nothing but communion wafers for the entire 40 days, but I would not get very far up the trail if I attempted it.  I tried intermittent fasting, delaying breakfast until after my workout, but once I began morning walking again, it was just too much.  Fainting or bonking is not a recommended spiritual exercise.     
Today feels like the start of my final preparation and I just hope the next few weeks pass quickly!  It is going to feel very weird starting my hike without a bar of chocolate from Nu Chocolat in Burlington in my pack, but I know if I carry it, I will eat it.  Instead I’m hoping to find a chocolatier in Luray or at least Lindt Bars in the grocery store.  I’m almost tempted to do a mail drop solely for Nu’s 85% Dark Bar, a single origin dark chocolate from the Tumaco region on the western coast of Columbia, my all time favorite.  Forty days of deprivation will only heighten my appreciation for whatever goodies I find to eat and drink in Luray.  For me it will be Paradise.    
For some, just the act of walking or the goal of Katahdin is sufficient motivation to keep them hiking.  They minimize their time in towns, only rarely spending a night.  That doesn’t work for me.   I need regular rewards, particularly food and drink, the promise of which carry me from town to town.   Skyland is the first and then Luray. Front Royal will pose a great predicament for me since I’m not planning to zero there and there are so many excellent food options.  The crispy duck at Thunwa Thai or the excellent Nepalese cuisine at Royal Spice?  Or the BBQ at PaveMint?  Life on the Trail is so difficult sometimes.  
Oh my, only the first day of Lent, and already I’m fantasizing about food instead of thinking holy thoughts.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660342,"I am getting excited and have managed to convince myself that this will be my year to successfully complete a thru-hike.  Every time a doubt surfaces, I slap it down.  No negative thoughts allowed.  I’m feeling great physically and passed my annual eye exam last week.  My cataracts still need to ripen a bit more before dealing with them.  I wonder if I’ll miss seeming life in soft focus?  Harsh reality may be too much for me.  A routine dental cleaning, haircut and the annual inspection of the car remain to be done before I leave.  Poor Tom will be stuck with the snow tire changeover and the six-month servicing, but I’ll make appointments for them.  I also have the usual pre-hike chores of buying food, weaning myself off coffee, and lubricating the gaskets on my bear canister.  And I’ll need to set up a shuttle from the Charlottesville Airport to Waynesboro, but it’s a little too soon for that.
I had some good feedback on my last journal entry.  I thank David and Terry for signing my guest book.  TrailJournals is a relatively primitive platform.  The only statistic I get is the page count, so I don’t really know how many people are following my entries or what they would like to see in my journal.  I’m writing blind.  One thing that I’ve concluded is that the more personal I make my writing, the better the response.  That’s a little scary, akin to public speaking.  There’s still the old tape running through my head, “If you let people see what you are really like, they won’t like you.”  I’m trying to work out how to balance being personal without providing too much information.
I’ve been asked how I manage to write a journal from the trail.  You know I’m desperate for a topic when I’m reduced to writing about writing, starting with the logistical aspects and then moving onto more interesting terrain of what I choose to write about.    
I rarely take notes during the day but I try to remember to take one photo for uploading to the journal.  I realize that Instagram and TikTok are the popular platforms today and photos and videos the preferred media, but I like words.  Words connect me to the experience but the act of taking photos, even selfies, makes me feel distant.  You probably understand or you wouldn’t be reading TrailJournals. When I get into camp, I have a fairly rigid protocol.  First, I fetch water, filling my three-liter reservoir with unfiltered water, using an 8-ounce titanium mug as a scoop if necessary. The Katadyn BeFree Filter screws into the top of the HydraPak Seeker reservoir.  I filter into a 16-ounce Lexan bottle, drink my fill, and cap off the bottle and reservoir.  This gives me enough water for cooking, drinking through the night, and starting the next day’s hike.  I only like to fetch water once, especially if the spring or stream is at some remove from the shelter or campsite.  Then I use the titanium mug and a half-bandana and wipe myself off at a suitable distance from the water source.   I return to camp, change into my sandals, pitch my tent or claim a space in the shelter,  inflate my sleeping pad, spread my sleeping bag to loft and change into my camp clothes, either a second pair of shorts or long-underwear bottoms and usually a long-sleeve top.    All the while, I’m reflecting on my day.  I’ll do a little light stretching, particularly the sciatic nerve glides that my physical therapist taught me.  Then, I’ll say Vespers.  If I’m alone I might chant it, but otherwise I say it silently.  Then, unless I’m ravenously hungry and can’t wait for dinner, I start my journal entry  
I type with one finger on my iPhone into Pages, which is Apple’s equivalent of Word.  My fingers are too large to use any more than one, so it’s a slow process.  As I wrote this last sentence, I realized that I haven’t looked for a lightweight Bluetooth keyboard in a while.  Google to the rescue!   I’ve just ordered Adafruit’s Mini Bluetooth Keyboard weighing only 1.4 ounces.  It measures 4.5” x 2.4” x 0.3” and uses a charging cable that I already carry for my headlamp.  I was able to type on a BlackBerry, so I’m hoping this keyboard will let me touch type and enter the zone when the words flow from my fingers and surprise my eyes.  I’ll review this product when it arrives later this week, but $12.95 plus shipping is a small risk.
I try to post daily but it depends if I have a strong enough cellphone signal.  I use Verizon, said to have the best coverage.  Shenandoah National Park is prone to weak signals, so it could be several days before my first trail post. When I have a  signal, I cut and paste my entry into TrailJournals and upload my daily photo.   Because I keep my phone in airplane mode and carry an Anker PowerCore Lite 10,000 mAh battery, I don’t expect battery life to be an issue.  It hasn’t been on past hikes, but this will be my first time using the iPhone 14 Pro. 
I try to think of my journal entries as one-act plays.  I set the stage with the weather and the trail itself, in other words the physical strata on which my day rests.  Then I reflect on the dramatis personae, the cast of characters I have to work with, including fellow hikers and plants and animals.  As a general rule, I’ll only use trail names, and if they are apt to be a recurring character, I’ll ask their permission.  If there is someone I don’t like (yes, it happens), I will invent my own name for them, like Ferret for the sharp-chinned doofus who was proud for having kept the entire dorm room at the Ironmasters Mansion awake in 2018 with his abysmal snoring.  The act of walking a linear trail propels the plot and characters move in and out.  I try to avoid detailed descriptions and stacked adverbs and adjectives.  There will be no rosy fingered Dawn in my journal, nor many gods and goddesses unless they chose to reveal themselves.   Magic, of course, is welcome.  I will particularly avoid descriptors like unique and iconic.  If I find something unique or iconic, I’ll tell you why.   I try to find something that happens during the day that might interest you and that I want to remember, which is the primary reason for this journal.  I can’t promise that my entries will have tidy beginnings, middles, and ends, but I will try.
I have the luxury with my pre-hike entries of writing them over a number of days and editing them.  That’s not the case with my trail entries, so I ask your forgiveness for grammatical and spelling errors and only hope they won’t be too grievous.
Now that I’ve bored you writing about writing, won’t one of my readers suggest a topic in my Guest Book?  I also invite your suggestions for an ebook to purchase before my hike, something so well written that I will want to linger over sentences and paragraphs and savor them.  I”m tempted to reread Gertrude Stein, but I have a habit of starting to imitate what I read.  Is the world ready for The Autobiography of Every Hiker, or a reflection that a rock is not a rock is not a rock?",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660414,"The mini Bluetooth keyboard looks exactly like the one pictured in my previous entry, but my nails are not as well manicured.  It isn’t large enough for me to touch type with 10 fingers but I can use two thumbs with relative ease.  Once I was comfortable with it, I timed myself typing a paragraph from my journal.  One big disadvantage of using the Bluetooth keyboard is that auto-correction and predictive text are not available.  I find both features very useful.  Predictive text has learned my word preferences.  Surprisingly often it suggests the word I want after I type just a few letters.  So typing on the iPhone was significantly faster even with one finger.  Then I had the brilliant idea of rotating the iPhone into landscape mode, making the keyboard as large as the Bluetooth keyboard.  Duh!  So my new toy will stay at home. Anyway, it weighed 1.5 ounces on my scale, not the advertised 1.4 ounces.
Yesterday morning featured azure skies and bright sunshine, a quintessential Vermont winter day when it was easy to imagine Robert Frost or Grandma Moses hiding behind a tree trunk.  It was spectacular in and of itself and also for its rarity.  Early March is cloudy 78% of the time, which dismal as it is, is better than December, our gloomiest month at over 90% cloud cover.  Naturally, the sunny day was a weather-tease, and by afternoon it was clouding over in advance of a snow storm last night that will continue through today.  We should end up with another 5” or so of wet heavy snow on top of the 6-8” we already had on the ground.  Yesterday morning, it was 24 degrees with a stiff north wind making it feel like 15.  I was very grateful for my insulated boots and Kahtoola NanoSpikes. The stillness was deafening.  I met two women busily engaged in scraping off hate stickers that seem to pop up everywhere, even in Vermont.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660482,"Alas, none of you suggested reading material for my hike, so I’ve been left to my own devices.  I don’t want anything current, and after the past few hikes (Anna Karenina and Brothers Karamazov), nothing Russian.  Then I remembered something assigned to me in twelfth grade English fifty-some years ago.   Geoffrey Chaucer will be a boon companion, especially seeing as I’m starting the hike in April.  You will, of course, recall the beginning of The Book of the Tales of Caunterbury:
     Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote, [When that April with its showers sweet,]
I had never heard of Middle English when we were assigned the text.  To save a few bucks, I raced down to the Norfolk City Library and checked out a copy, not realizing that it was the original Middle English.  I thought it a little queer and slow going, but found that if I read it aloud, I could ferret the meaning.  
I doubt that I have the same patience today, so I asked a friend on the English faculty of the University of Vermont to recommend a lively modern translation available in an e-edition. After consulting with her fellow medievalists, she came back with Shiela Fisher’s 2011 translation.  I also downloaded the Middle English original (Penguin edition) for old time’s sake.  I’ll read sections in Middle English first and then the modern translation to see how close I get.  Since I won’t be pushing miles, I’ll have plenty of time. 
I really wanted an e-book, both for the savings in weight and to hide it from prying eyes, sparing me accusations of carrying pornography.  Yes, that’s right!  Canterbury Tales was banned by the U.S. Postal Service under the Comstock Act of 1893 as obscene, filthy and inappropriate, and even today is usually taught in abridged (censored) form.  By reading it in Middle English, albeit by accident, I got to enjoy the dirty parts. It is rather bawdy in places, no denying it, but I find censorship to be more obscene than any writing.  Does it offend you that The Wife of Bath brags on her sexual talents and her five happy husbands, boasting,
     And trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me / I hadde the best quoniam myghte be
Shiela Fisher’s new verse translation is delightful, but she wimped out a little:
     And truly, as my husbands all told me, / I had the best quoniam there might be.
Quoniam is italicized and footnoted:  “quoniam: in Latin, literally, “because” or “whereas.”  Used here as another euphemism for female genitals.”  
The Harvard translation, available on the web but not as an ebook, is a bit bolder, using pudendum.  Really, can you imagine a bawdy person saying pudendum?  Would you be offended if for “best quoniam,” I substituted “finest pu**y,” still preserving the meter?
And don’t get me started on The Pardoner, who with his high voice and smooth face might be either a eunuch or a homosexual (Perish the thought!).  And that Alison, the Miller’s wife, is quite the trollop.   
If you were a high school teacher today, would you dare to teach Canterbury Tales?   In Vermont, you might feel safe, but what about teachers in Florida and Arizona?  Perhaps for the sake of children’s souls, we ought not to teach them to read, and heaven help us if they start to think.
This collection of flawed pilgrims gathered around the fire at night telling stories is the medieval equivalent of a tramily (trail family).  It’s a diverse collection of people brought together for common purpose, a pilgrimage, who probably never knew one another before the journey and will probably never see one another again after reaching Canterbury.  It’s much easier to confess to strangers than friends, and their stories feed off one another.  It’s nice to realize that the easy shared intimacy among long-distance hikers on the Appalachian Trail has ancient roots.  I can only hope I meet fellow pilgrims as interesting as The Wife of Bath, The Pardoner, and The Miller.  And I can only dream about writing character sketches as vivid as Chaucer’s.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660647,"Now that I’ve dealt with the most pressing of my pre-hike matters, the choice of what to read during my hike, I can start checking off items of lesser importance.
I cleaned and lubricated the gaskets on my Bearikade canister.  There are four nitrile o-rings, one under each of the three quarter-turn fasteners and a large one in a narrow grove around the opening that seals the aircraft aluminum cover to the composite carbon fiber cylinder.  It’s important to use a pure silicone or synthetic lubricant designed for use on nitrile.  Solvents like acetone will degrade the o-rings, which otherwise should last for 15 years.
I requested a refill for the Albuterol inhaler that I carry.  My last one expired unused and I hope this one will as well.  I had asthma as a kid and had one incident on a hike.  It was termed exercise-induced cold-onset asthma.  That was over a decade ago and I’ve carried an inhaler in my first aid kit ever since.  It has worked well in that carrying it has kept me asthma-free.  I suspect that living in Vermont and walking on winter mornings has acclimated me to the cold.  I don’t mind walking in the snow, but unless I’m on a hike, I avoid the rain.
I inflated my Exped Ultra sleeping pad in the afternoon and it held its pressure overnight.  I never want to go through what I did last year, with a pad needing to be reinflated several times during the night and being unable to find the leak.  A good night’s sleep is worth a slightly heavier pad.
I arranged for a shuttle from the Charlottesville Airport to Waynesboro on April 1, and a shuttle to the Rockfish Gap trailhead the next morning.  I used Pam Bennett “Ping” in 2015.  She was both reliable and entertaining, so I’m glad she is available. 
I stopped by the Post Office after my walk one morning and picked up a Priority Mail box and attached postage and my home mailing address. I plan on leaving it with my pack duffel inside with Rockfish Gap Outfitters.  Ping will stop there so I can pick up a 4 ounce fuel canister.  The Post Office will be closed before we get to Waynesboro and packages thicker than 1/2” can’t be left in a collection box.  
And then I had some wonderful news.  I was a little down that I would be starting a hike without my cousin Rocky Raccoon.  Then I got an email from Curious George.  Rocky and I met Curious George at Bears Den Hostel, about 18 miles south of Harpers Ferry, in August 2021.  We stayed in touch and then in April 2022, Curious George and his wife Stephanie gave me a ride from Pen Mar Park to the Cobblestone Inn.  They had been visiting their son at Penn State where he is completing a Doctor of Music Arts in piano and were in the neighborhood.  George and Stephanie live in Warrenton, Virginia which is pretty close to Shenandoah National Park.  He has competed almost all of the Appalachian Trail and suggested that he join me for the first week through Shenandoah National Park.  I’m delighted and was able to change my reservations for rooms with two queen-sized beds instead of a single king-sized bed.  Even though George is Mennonite and I’m Episcopalian, we seem to have a lot in common including our commitment to pacifism.  I am looking forward to getting to know him better.  Curious George is not a replacement for Rocky Raccoon.  It’s just that Rocky’s role has changed from her self-described anchor role at the start of my hike, stopping me from doing too much too soon, to a carrot role.  She’s hoping to join me in Vermont in June.  Looking forward to the pleasure of her company is sure to keep me going.  Not all of my carrots are food-related!
Another friend will be starting his hike from the Flip-Flop Festival in Harpers Ferry so will be a few days behind me.  I wouldn’t surprise me if he caught up to me.   
I’m running out of pre-hike chores.  I can postpone one that I don’t enjoy for another week or so — trimming my body hair.  It definitely makes it easier to stay cleaner and spot ticks, and I suppose it is nearly sheep shearing season in Vermont. In fact, nearby Shelburne Farms shears their dairy sheep In February. I say Baaaa to that and will wait as long as I can and still get through the itchies before my hike.  About the same time, I’ll start weaning myself off my one daily cup of dark coffee, Peet’s Major Dickason’s Blend.

This past Sunday’s Gospel lesson was Jesus meeting the Samaritan woman at the well.  The Samaritans were the transpeople of their age, at least for the Jews.  Jesus scandalized his own disciples by having the effrontery to converse with her, accept water from her, and stay in her village for several days.  To their credit, the disciples said nothing.
Please, please, I implore you!  If you are going to be hiking on the Appalachian Trail this year or if you live in a community visited by hikers, please welcome everyone.  Don’t judge us by how we look, how we dress, or even how we smell.  Don’t judge us by how we identify and who we love.  Underneath our polyester, wool, fleece, down, dirt and grime, we are just folks like you.  If you can’t welcome us, at least say nothing.

And how can I separate my selves from what unifies them all, Nature?  I better switch gears before I’m accused of being just another tree-hugging transcendentalist or more accurately a panentheist.  Sandy is eminently practical and dislikes it when I go abstract on her.

Usually I wait until nearer to sunrise to start my walk.  That was 7:00 yesterday, but it didn’t freeze Friday night so I left the condo at 5:45 and wasn’t worried about frozen snow melt.   Perhaps I should have been.  About four miles into my walk, I started encountering patches of black ice.  There was enough clear trail between them that I would lengthen my stride and increase my cadence and then nearly fall when I hit another clear ice patch.  I was attending to my inner voice and not paying attention to cold, very hard reality.  That’s the danger of daydreaming while walking.  Occasionally on the trail, it causes me to miss turns and find myself confused as to where I am.  I haven’t fallen yet this winter and would prefer not to, so I turned around.
I find it easy to daydream when my body isn’t hurting anywhere.  Readers who are middle-aged or younger might not understand this, but my older readers will.  At a certain age, it is rare to have a day when nothing hurts, and a good day means that the pain today is in a different body part than yesterday.  So I feel very fortunate indeed that lately nothing has been hurting.  Even all my toenails are intact and regrown since my last hike.  My legs and knees are not only uncomplaining but if I take a zero day, they get antsy.  So my overwhelming mood, Sister Sandy, is one of gratitude.  I’m grateful to the surgeon who did a fine job replacing my knees in 2019.  I’m grateful for every physical therapist I’ve had since and particularly to Magical Harry for solving the problem that threw me off the trail last September and for retraining my gait, so that walking, particularly going up and down hills is much more pleasant, and I can lose myself again.  I’m grateful to be living in Burlington, Vermont, a welcoming, inclusive community of ever increasing diversity and grateful to have left Florida before their current governor took office.  
And I’m particularly grateful for my husband Tom. I have never had a bucket list, things I feel that I simply must do before I die or my life will not have been worthwhile.  Perhaps the closest I have been to wanting something that i didn’t have was in the early 1970’s, when I was testing a religious vocation at an Episcopal monastery on the mid-Hudson River.  One of my fellow postulants who was very familiar with that area knew the two gentlemen who lived in a house where the monastery’s driveway turned off US 9W.   They were both teachers and operated a small antique shop on the weekends and in summer.  They had a swimming pool.  On Sunday afternoons, our only free time, if I wasn’t hiking, I would be sunning by the pool and enjoying their hospitality.  It was the first time that I had ever known a long-term gay couple and hadn’t realized that such a thing was possible.  I discovered my true vocation, and after completing my postulancy and being invited into the novitiate, I left the monastery.  Two years later I was living with Tom.  It was love at first sight and 46 years later it still is.  So aside from feeling grateful for Tom, I’m also feeling more than a little wistful and a tidge guilty for planning to leave for six months, with only occasional visits home.  Tom is fully supportive and knows that if he were to ask me not to go, I would not.  But he would never do that, one of the many reasons that I love him.  
I also feel a deep sense of peace.  I don’t think it qualifies as stoic equanimity or even Christian peace that passes all understanding.  It’s more a sense of being where I ought to be, like in the Shaker Simple Gifts hymn:
     ’Tis the gift to be simple, ’tis the gift to be free,
     ‘Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be,
Don’t worry, I won’t be singing Kumbaya around the campfire and hugging strangers.
What I’m not feeling is any sense of fear as to the hike itself.  Not of bears, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, crazed hikers or townspeople, or even ticks.  There’s a slight sense of dread that once again, I might not succeed, but that wouldn’t be the end of my world.  I’ve gotten quite accustomed to failure.  
As far as mental preparation goes, Sister Sandy, it has been a gradual process of withdrawal.  As an inveterate thinking introvert — a daydreamer — this isn’t very difficult for me.  Giving up the AirPods has been wonderful.  I am no longer surrounded by national and world affairs that I cannot influence or control.   But I am counting on my friends to let me know when a certain past president is indicted, whether this Tuesday or sometime during my hike.  I confess to more than a little Schadenfreude.  
My period of mental preparation coincides with Lent, a time of refocusing, that is reinforcing my sense of being in the right place mentally.   A week into my hike, I’ll be ready to burst from my chrysalis, reborn as a creature of the trail.  Easter in Luray.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661157,"When I wrote my last entry, two weeks before leaving for the trail, I felt that I had everything under control.  I actually wrote about feeling at peace.  I thought my mania for spreadsheets and checklists would take care of everything, that my role was simply to list a task, not to actually do it.  Sometimes i miss having employees!   Checklists and due date lists are an occupational hazard for a tax CPA, and I should have remembered from umpteen tax seasons that the nearer a deadline approaches, the work that needs to be done multiplies.  So this week, I’ve managed to busy myself with the following tasks, related to the hike and my leaving home for a long time:
Trim body hair — I do this a week or so in advance of the hike so that the itching will have stopped before I get to the trailhead.  I try to trim my hair from neck to thighs using a guard over the electric trimmer but inevitably I discard the guard when the hair doesn’t cooperate and I nick myself repeatedly.  Do sheep itch after their shearing?  
Finances — One of the great things about being legally married, and there are many, is having joint financial accounts.  So having Tom pay my bills in addition to his is not a great imposition.  I transferred a little more cash into checking as a cushion, with the thought that if it is still sitting there in July, I might be tempted to reserve space in the AMC huts through the Presidential Range in New Hampshire.  I did it on the cheap in 2000, including a couple of work-for-stays and didn’t enjoy feeling like a dog under the table.  I’ve printed out envelopes for our property tax installments and put our insurance policy renewal premiums and my Medicare supplemental premiums on autopay.  It’s hard to be the one who stays home, so I want to do everything I can to minimize hassles for Tom.  Every thru-hiker should have a Tom or the equivalent to handle things at home!
Coffee — Most people develop a tolerance to their usual dose of caffeine.  I don’t and each coffee or cola is a mini-jolt to my system, increasing my pulse rate and blood pressure.  I get a buzz each time, but it limits how much coffee I can drink.  Any caffeine after noon affects my sleep, and if I go cold turkey from my one morning cup, I have headaches for several days.  So I’ve learned to slowly wean myself off coffee starting two weeks before a hike and having none in the final week.  I’m just about at that point now.  I could bring instant coffee with me on the trail, but i find the taste unbearable, yes even Starbucks Via, and I won’t carry the weight to make a proper cup.  When I’m in town, coffee is a luxury I look forward to.
Water Filter — After my last hike, I carefully cleaned my Katadyn BeFree filter, including soaking it in distilled water, but it was starting to show its age.  I tested it this week and it took a lot of pressure for very little flow, so it is time to replace it.  There is no point in going to REI until I go ahead and pack my pack and see what else is missing so …
Packing my pack — This didn’t take very long.  I keep a gear spreadsheet, of course, and put an X in a column as I pack an item or an X in another column if it’s something I will pack nearer to my flight, like my sleeping bag and stuff that I regularly use here such as my puffy and rain gear.  On recent hikes, I’ve used a three-liter HydraPak Seeker as a water reservoir.  The BeFree filter screws into it.  I’ve kept it in a side pocket of the pack secured by the side strap, but I realize that I rarely use it except in camp. It’s a nuisance flapping around empty.  So this time, the Seeker and filter are rolled up in a stuff sack, still in the side pocket.  Unsecured items in the side pockets tend to escape, so I need to buy a small carabiner to lock it in place.  I also need a second carabiner to secure my 16-ounce Lexan bottle and 8-ounce mug (replacements for the ones that popped out a year ago) and a third to attach my thru-hiker hangtag that I’ll pick up at ATC headquarters in Harpers Ferry.  I also realize that I am out of Nuun rehydration tablets.  Now I’m ready to visit REI.
Visit REI — We are fortunate to have three outfitters in the Burlington Area.  Outdoor Gear Exchange downtown is locally owned, but I haven’t gotten over that when they replaced the carbide tips of my trekking poles, they epoxied the new tips in instead of using hot glue.  As it turned out, my 10-year old Leki poles have since worn out and needed replacing well before the tips wore out, but I’m still holding a grudge.  Eastern Mountain Sports was here before their bankruptcy and are back again.  I really ought to visit them.  REI opened in nearby Williston a couple of years ago.  They still had my membership on file from the 1970’s, although my unused dividends from back then had long ago been donated to charity.  Their staff is uniformly friendly and helpful.  Plus I had a 20% off on one item coupon and my annual dividend, so it was a no brainer where to go, even if it meant a major road trip — six miles.  We drive under 3,000 miles a year, unAmerican as that is.  Most everything is within walking distance of our condo.   I hated using the 20% off coupon for something as inexpensive as a water filter, but I really don’t need anything else.  After the filter, three carabiners and a tube of Nuun tablets, I still have unused dividends for my next visit. 
Visit ATM —  I rarely transact business using cash, especially since COVID, and still had some from last year’s hikes, but I needed more.  Trail businesses and shuttle drivers greatly appreciate cash.  That sets my auditor sense to tingle, but I cheerfully comply.  
Sharpen Kitchen Knives — This is something I don’t do as often as I should, but it wouldn’t be right to leave dull knives for Tom.  
Cut Tags off Clothes — Almost all of my clothes are from previous hikes, but InsectShield insists on sewing a new tag in each treated item, except for socks that they stencil.  
Visit Dentist — Last year, I scheduled a cleaning for late May.  If I had stayed on the trail, it would have been a hassle to time my visit home to keep the appointment.  This year, I scheduled the cleaning early in late March before my hike and the another for mid-August when I”ll be home from Maine.  It’s one fewer constraint on my hiking schedule, even if it means three cleanings this year instead of my usual two.  I now have my dentist’s blessing, to use his word.  i wonder how much weight a dentist’s blessing carries with the trail gods?
Buy Food — It was my week to cook anyway, so I picked up all of my trail food for Waynesboro to Luray, except for flour tortillas that I’ll buy shortly before leaving.  My goal is to arrive in Luray with an empty bear canister.
Wash Car — When we lived in Florida, not having a clean car was viewed as a moral shortcoming.  In Vermont, no one cares, so two or three times a year I run it through the car wash whether it needs it or not.  Road salt doesn’t seem to bother it, but I suppose it’s time.
Set iPhone to Maximize Battery Life — The iPhone 14 Pro has excellent battery life, but now I’ve disabled the Always-On Display, limited the Frame-Refresh Rate, turned off Auto-Brightness, and reduced Background App Activities to only FarOut and Delta.  I’ll turn off Delta after getting to Charlottesville.  On the trail, the phone will be in airplane mode except when I check for messages and post to this journal.  
Start Flonase — The tree pollen count in Northern Virginia is already high, so I’ve started snorting Flonase daily so I’ll be asymptomatic when I start my hike.  I don’t need to be sneezing my way down the trail and rubbing my eyes.  
Well, now I am feeling at peace once again with a week to go and the only remaining chores buying tortillas, the annual car inspection, a haircut, charging electronics, and trimming my nails.  I am looking forward to tapering off my workouts at the Y, as Magical Harry suggests.  I’m sure other tasks will surface in the final days.",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661352,"It seems like almost everything I’ve done this week has been a Last, as in the last time I’ll do something before my hike.  It started a week ago, on the last day of my cooking week, when I took out the garbage, recycling and compost to the carriage barn behind our condominium, where the bins live.  I won’t miss that.  Saturday was my last coffee.  Sunday was my last time at church and the last time I saw my chosen brother Henry.   This morning was the last time I went to the Y before my hike and this afternoon, I had my last haircut.  Tomorrow will be my last time driving.  There are many things I’ll miss while on the trail.  Driving isn’t one of them, but Nathan, my “hair artist,” as he styles himself, is right up there.  Oh, I dread going to a real barber shop with magazines like Field & Stream and posters showing the three or four permissible haircuts. I’ll do my best to remember to scratch myself, manspread and respond to any question with a low-pitched growl or mumble.  I’ll keep my wrists stiff and deny knowing the names of colors other than blue, red, brown, yellow, green and camouflage.   Is there a straighter place in all of America than a small town barber shop?  The barber shop in Port Clinton, Pennsylvania is said to be hiker-friendly, but I’m sure to out myself if I ask for my hair to be texturized.  Maybe I’ll wait until Delaware Water Gap which is infinitely more civilized.  
I feel like I’m fading out of my regular existence but that i haven’t fully materialized on the trail yet.  I’m in a state of suspended animation or Limbo.  This divided state is why I prefer taking the train to the start of my hike, so that it feels like I’ve left someplace and am going to another.  Sitting in a metal tube hurtling through the air is too much like enduring an MRI without the peculiar clicking sounds and beeps.  It will be in the mid-30’s and raining when I leave Burlington and even though the calendar says it is spring, there are still patches of snow and the crocus, daffodil and hyacinth stems are just starting to show themselves.   It’s all black and white.  Waynesboro, in contrast, will be in the mid-60’s with all kinds of blooming plants and trees and even green grass.  A modern jet plane is not the same as a farmhouse caught up in a cyclone, but the transition from sepia-toned Vermont to Technicolor Virginia will be as abrupt to me.  What do the good citizens of Waynesboro call themselves?  Waynesborians?  Waynesboroites?  I’ll just think of them as Munchkins and Ming Garden as the guildhall of the Lollypop Guild.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661488,"I came upon this saying in the introduction to The Canterbury Tales and thought that I would appropriate it to mark the transition from my pre-hike ramblings to tomorrow’s start of my hike. You can trust my entries for whatever value they have in and of themselves but how they relate to either me or what’s happening on the trail is essentially unknowable even to myself.  I’ll have lots of time to think about that. 
I enjoyed my last Burlington walk yesterday morning seeing very little other than flocks of Canada geese making their way north punctuating their journey with raucous honks.  The exception was a flock of 8 to 10 geese that seemed very confused, flying due south in V-formation. They were not casually honking but having a serious disagreement, with the backseat geese screaming, “You’re going the wrong way. Who ever taught you to fly?  I should have listened to my mother, ‘Look at his father; that’s who you’re marrying!’”  And the lead goose responding, “Go to Hell! Who the f**k do you think you are, telling me how to fly?  If you think you can do better, go ahead!”  One of the following geese took the lead and wheeled the flock to a northerly compass point, and order was restored. 
In the afternoon it started to snow. It was above freezing, so very little stuck and none on the salt-encrusted streets. About 3/4” accumulated on our balcony. It felt good knowing that today I would be heading south to a forecast high of 72 in Waynesboro. 
The same front that brought us snow yesterday made for a choppy flight today, limiting the cabin service. I still managed to get a fancy granola package and two Biscoff packs, one of the best things about flying Delta.  I’m saving one pack of Biscoff for a trail snack. 
Uh-oh! Thunderstorms over Atlanta forced us to divert to Columbia, SC to add fuel and wait out the storms. We will get into Atlanta a couple of hours late. I don’t know what that means yet for getting to Charlottesville!
The weather in Atlanta couldn’t be nicer now.  Blue skies, gentle breeze, 66*. We arrived after my flight left. I’m booked on the next one at 9:45 tonight and I’ve confirmed that my checked pack knows about it. I’ll get to Charlottesville at 11:12 tonight.   And bless her heart, my shuttle driver Ping is willing to meet me then. George will pick up a fuel canister at the outfitter. So other than having to stay awake waaaaay past my usual 8:00 bedtime, all is good. Note to the wise:  Don’t try the Chinese stir fry in the Concourse C food court!  
Dinner was at Phillips Seafood on D Concourse and the crab cake and shrimp platter was quite good. Now I’ve met the daily minimum requirement for grease. I had iced tea and now I’ll be able to stay awake for a few more hours. George is going to Ming Garden for dinner and I’ll miss that. It’s not the greatest Chinese food but is the largest buffet on the trail. George has a similar sleep pattern to mine, poor guy, meaning early to bed and early to rise, early in his case being beddy bye around 7 or so and waking up about 3. I thought I was bad at 8 and 4. I am sorry that I’ll have to wake him up in the middle of the night, but it can’t be helped. I just hope this flight is on-time. 
Delta wants me to get my exercise today.  The gate for the Charlottesville flight started on Concourse C, switched to D, then back to C, and now it’s back to D.   I’m on board the flight to Charlottesville and so is my checked pack. I’ve confirmed that with Ping. So I’ll end this entry now. Any fresh disasters can wait until tomorrow!

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661513,"The flight from Atlanta arrived in Charlottesville 10 minutes early but was a rough ride. There were high wind warnings issued with gusts possibly up 65 MPH. Once we descended below 10,000’, we were buffeted sideways and up and down. I feared the pilot would be unable to land and we would be diverted again but he landed without incident. Whew!
I was asleep by 12:45 and hoped to sleep in, but I couldn’t. It’s like I’m programmed to wake up at 4:15, so I’m operating today on 3-1/2 hours of sleep with a carryover deficit from the night before. George took a Benadryl as a sleep aid and it worked very well. Unfortunately Benadryl makes me antic. I showered, never being one to pass up a chance of being clean. The breakfast at the Quality Inn was adequate. The instant scrambled eggs were yellow but bathing in salt water.
We walked over to St John’s Episcopal Church for the 8:00 Palm Sunday service advertised on their website, but there wasn’t one. They are between priests and the supply priest only does one service on Sunday. George suggested we take in the United Methodist 8:30 service and we were warmly welcomed. Communion with oyster crackers and grape juice in tiny shot glasses lacks something for me. We met Ping at 10 and started hiking from Rockfish Gap at 10:15. Ping insisted that we touch the white blaze for good luck.
The hike itself was uneventful which is a wonderful thing.  It started out windy and cloudy in the low 40’s but by afternoon was sunny and calm, in the lower 50’s. We stopped for lunch in a sunny glade by McCormick Gap and took a couple of breaks in the afternoon, arriving at the spring on the shelter path around 3:15. I had shed layers at each break, but now I’m wearing most of my clothes including my long underwear and puffy. It will be in the mid-30’s tonight , but the rest of the week will be warmer. 
A solo woman hiker, AJ from around Princeton, New Jersey came in and joy of joys, she started from Rockfish Gap today as well and is flip-flop thru-hiking. I’m sure I’ll be seeing her again. Just maybe, we are starting to find out tramily!

I woke at my usual time of 4:15. Sunrise isn’t until about 7:00 here, so I had plenty of time to break camp, eat breakfast, and explore the composting privy. 
The 13 miles including two packs off breaks and a lunch break, and numerous brief catch-your-breath breaks, took us 8.5 hours. The trail was very good, but still goes up and down with occasional rocky areas. Nothing special. We will gain speed as we get used to our pack weights, but for Day 2, it was a good day. We met a 20 year old woman Rainbow and her 18 year old brother who started in Georgia on February 2. They will do 20+ miles today so we won’t be seeing them again. AJ left later than us but passed us a mile or so before the shelter. She’s tented close to me. Mine is the blue tent. George couldn’t find a level tent site and is staying in the shelter.

When I awoke, before leaving my tent, I stuffed the sleeping bag in its sack and rolled up the sleeping pad as well. I changed into my trail clothes and put on my shoes sitting in the tent door. I had forgotten to put the gaiters with the shoes so after breakfast I had to take the shoes off and put on the gaiters. Breaking camp will quickly be automatic for me. 
George and I started our hike about 7:15, stopping at Dundo Picnic Ground about 2 miles later. I needed the privy. The views from the summit of Blackrock Mountain were spectacular. It’s a rock jumble that the trail crosses on a pathway built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930’s. The amount of labor required to clear a trail and backfill it with small rocks and gravel amazes me, and I am very grateful. The CCC really built Shenandoah National Park including Skyline Drive, the relocated Appalachian Trail and the huts. 
We stopped for lunch at a picnic table by the Loft Mountain Camp Store which hasn’t opened for the season yet. It was sunny and warm today. A cold soda or an ice cream would have been welcome. At least there were trash cans there so we could offload a little weight. 
AJ caught up to us. She carries 40 pounds and can hike circles around me. She and Curious George stopped at Ivy Creek Spring for water. I continued hiking since I still had enough water for the remaining 3.7 miles. There was one final uphill and I paced myself, meaning that I stopped every 50 or 100 steps to breathe. I was kind of glad to be alone. I’m sure that as I get accustomed to my pack weight, the ups will become easier. 
I got to Pine Field Hut about 3:00 after a snack break at Ivy Creek Overlook. There were several cars and a camper there but no magic offered.  The tentsites here are steeply up hill and I can’t face it. I’m staying in the shelter tonight as is Curious George. Superwoman AJ is camping on the ridge above. One Hundred Percent came rolling in around 6:00. One Hundred Percent has taken his name to establish that nothing less than hiking 100% of the Trail is acceptable to him. He needs a shorter name.  I suggested Hun, as in either Attila the Hun or short for Honey. He prefers the latter at age 70 and having 10 grandchildren. CG’s is 62. Hun is 70. AJ is 59.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661628,"I fell asleep at 7 last night. A Georgia to Maine thru-hiker came in sometime last night and set up in the shelter next to me. I didn’t hear a thing and slept solidly until morning. I had a vivid dream in which our little group was abducted and taken to a medical research lab. They implanted control devices in our spinal cords so that if we tried leaving the facility our legs gave out, like a spinal nerve block. At one point I had the sensation of waking up and couldn’t move my legs. I fell back asleep into the dream. I was glad when morning came. I met our overnight guest Ope. He did 40 miles yesterday!  
Because we were only going 8.2 miles today, we started late, after 8:00. There were three good ups today. Midway up the first up where the trail crosses the Skyline Drive, AJ’s husband was waiting for her. She plans to slackpack 12 miles today and spend the night in a hotel.  He offered Curious George and me fresh fruit — our first trail magic. I had a delicious banana and was able to leave the peel with him. CG carried out an apple. 
I began to have pain in the back of my calves on the second climb, forcing me to stop often for the pain to abate. The third climb up to the shelter was agony for me, very like what drove me off the trail last September. The difference is that thanks to Magical Harry the physical therapist, I knew what to do. The first thing I did after getting into the shelter was two sets of nerve glides.  The pain vanished and I fetched our water from a spring steeply downhill without pain. I’ll do another two sessions this afternoon and evening and just pray that the resolution is as simple as that! 
I’ve been using sun block in addition to Picaridin each day. The Picaridin is to prevent ticks. The understory is just starting to leaf out but the trees are still bare. Redbuds and a few dogwoods are in bloom.

We are showered, our clothes is freshly laundered and our tummies full. What else is there to want in life?  The managers of the camp store, Ken and Katia, couldn’t be nicer. Ken thru-hiked in 2020 so he understands us.  We got here about 1:30 after several long breaks. Curious George needed to replenish water twice. I was fine and only drank 1 liter.  How much should you drink?  It depends on the person. This sounds gross but the color of my piss is a pretty good indicator. Any more than a light golden is a sign that I need to be drinking more, but that hasn’t happened yet this hike. 
Backing up a little, I was really worried about the leg pain I had yesterday because it was so similar to what drove me off the trail last September. When I got to camp yesterday, I did the sciatic nerve glides that Magical Harry the physical therapist taught me, repeating them three times last night. I did another couple of sets this morning. The result was that my legs felt loose, limber and pain free all day. The 11.8 miles passed quickly, even the uphills.  So I am very grateful to Harry. I’m actually looking forward to 16.8 miles tomorrow. 
Another treat today was AJ coming up behind us this morning.  She’s considering taking the trail name Chocolate Chip or Chip for short. She’s a superb baker. Tonight, she’s at Bearfence Hut, 0.7 miles north of here, all downhill. 
And now Hun. He came into the shelter last night in awful shape, having been out of food all day. He had counted on Loft Mountain Camp Store being open, but it won’t open until May. Between Curious George and me, we gave him enough food to get here to Lewis Mountain. Then we opened the bear box at Hightop Hut and found more food. That’s the way it is on the Appalachian Trail. Each hiker is independent yet there is no more caring community willing to help each other. We were delighted to help him since it meant lightening our loads!  Hun got to Lewis Mountain, registered for a tent site and got to the camp store 15 minutes before it closed.

We started at 6:30, first light, and made the 8.7 miles to Big Meadows Campground by 10:30. We had an early lunch sitting in the warm and dry Campground laundry room. We got to Skyland Resort at 3:00, so including breaks, we averaged just under 2 MPH. I’m happy with that. I had wanted a room close to the lodge and dining room, but instead we are about 2/10 mile steeply downhill. 
After showering, Curious George and I walked back up for dinner. Today is the opening day for Skyland so things were a little confused, like the breadbasket being delayed nearly the entree and the Caesar salad dressing being a simple vinaigrette. I had a cup of very good Brunswick stew, the not-so-Caesar salad, and a trout baked in foil with julienned peppers and wine served with a rice medley and green beans. I thought the beans were slightly overdone. George found then underdone, which probably means they were just right. I snapped a photo of a large two foot tree bole yesterday but didn’t look at it until this evening.  I did a double take.  Is it a tree becoming human or a human becoming tree?  An ent?  Either way, it’s scary and a reminder of the odd things living in these woods  
I’ve phoned Allison at Open Arms Hostel for a 2:00 pickup tomorrow at Thornton Gap. I’ll text from Mary’s Rock above the gap with a better estimate of my arrival time. 
This was my longest day so far and the longest I have planned until nearly the end of July, but who knows?  I’m tired tonight but nothing specific is sore. I am glad that tomorrow is only 9.5 miles, mostly downhill, and that Easter Sunday will be a zero day. That means a rest day with zero trail miles hiked. I’ll spend some time Sunday evaluating the first leg of my thru hike and planning the next section to Harpers Ferry. For now, I’m looking forward to a good night’s sleep!","Lewis Mountain Campground 
",Skyland,"Apr 07, Fri",16.80
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661773,"I had to use my first aid kit for the first time last night. Probably because of the damp socks yesterday, I had the start of blisters on the balls of both feet. Compeed seems to have them under control and they should be healed before I start hiking again on Monday. 
Yesterday I had a food fantasy about a spinach, ham, mushroom and Feta cheese omelet. I almost fulfilled it this morning at Skyland, substituting tomato for the mushrooms. We left Skyland with full bellies about 8:45. It was a bit chilly, in the upper 20’s and I started out in most of my clothes. It warmed up quickly and I soon packed away my puffy and rain pants. By the start of the descent from Mary’s Rock to Thornton Gap, I was down to my long underwear bottoms, shorts, and my garnet hoody. 
Since it was a lovely spring weekend day, the trail around Hawksbill Mountain and Mary’s Rock was crowded with people and dogs. Allison, the owner of Open Arms Hostel in Luray asked for progress reports and she was waiting at the trail crossing of Rte 211 in the Gap at 1:30.  But first I had to say goodbye to Curious George at the side trail to the Panorama parking area where his wife Stephanie would meet him. I’m grateful to Curious George for seeing me through the first week of my thru-hike during the awkward adjustment to life on the trail. There were areas of disagreement, the usual political and religious topics, but we had far more in common and each learned from the other. I’m sure we’ll remain friends, even brothers, and simply avoid issues bound to be upsetting to one of us. I would gladly hike with Curious George again. 
Allison is a gracious and generous host. Along with her dogs Blaze and Fifi, she made me feel welcome. Half of her lunch of a Rueben sandwich, fries, pickle and mandarin orange slices was sitting in a foam tray. Could I help her finish it, she asked?  Not a problem I assured her. She oriented me, provided me with wonderfully comfortable cotton loaner clothes while she did my laundry and I showered. They felt so good, that I continued to wear them. 
On the way to the hostel, Allison said that I had a dinner date tonight at the Brookside Restaurant. It was Hun!  He was cold yesterday morning from tenting at Lewis Mountain Campground and shuttled into the hostel. He’ll return to the campground on Monday and resume his hike. Meanwhile it’s good to see a familiar face and definitely tramily. Now for the highlight of the day. 
Brookside Restaurant offers a country buffet for $20. The features tonight included a copious salad bar, fried chicken, braised pork chops, Swedish meatballs, fried shrimp, greens, ratatouille, rice, scalloped potatoes, stewed apple slices and MORE, plus a dessert bar. I had to pass on the latter. I complimented our server on the greens and she brought me a small carafe of vinegar. If you don’t know, adding a splash of vinegar to collard greens makes them come alive!  
As I ended my hike today, I noticed a part of the Vibram sole of my left shoe was starting to flap. I had already glued the right one back together with SuperGlue at Lewis Mountain. I repaired the left one tonight and filed a warranty claim with Altra. They barely have more than 100 miles on them. Meanwhile I’ve asked Tom to mail me my spare pair to Harpers Ferry. 
I’ll continue tomorrow with a self-assessment of my first week on the trail.","Skyland
",Thornton Gap (Luray),"Apr 08, Sat",9.50
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661811,"I had the room to myself in the hostel last night. Even though Hun is in a separate room with two closed doors between us, I could hear his snores, but only at subdued volume and not bothersome. 
So what do I think of my first week on the Trail?  I hiked 80 miles and averaged 11.2 miles per day. I’m pleased with that, but realize that I would have been wiser holding to 8-10 miles per day. The spacing of the shelters didn’t allow for that. I could have broken up the 16.8 mile day at Big Meadows Campground and that would have been wise, but I wanted to test myself. Pride goeth before the blisters. And I wanted to be in Luray for Easter.  Except for a deep blister under the ball of my left foot, I have no physical complaints. I had a repeat of the leg pain that curtailed my 2022 attempt, but this time I knew how to deal with it. I’m grateful to Magical Harry the physical therapist. 
The only gear I am not completely happy with are my shoes. The Altra Olympus 5 remain the most comfortable trail shoes I’ve ever used, breathing well and offering great traction. But I am having a problem with the Vibram soles delaminating. I’ve made a warranty claim and will pick up my spare pair in Harpers Ferry. SuperGlue will hold them together until then. I have woren every article of clothing I brought except for the rain mitts, so I’m happy with my choices. When it gets warmer, I will send a little home. 
Psychologically, having Curious George as a companion my first week was a major advantage. There are adjustments to life on the trail and having someone to share them with was a big help. That being said, I’m also looking forward to some alone time. I’ll probably fall into a tramily as I progress, but I can handle it either way.  There have been a lot more thru-hikers than I anticipated, including several who started in Georgia in early February and are making excellent time. I mostly see their dust. There have also been several southbound flip-flop thru-hikers who started in Harpers Ferry. I expect to meet many more northbound flip-floppers after the Flip-Flop Kickoff in Harpers Ferry ends next Sunday. They tend to start various places to spread the mini-bubble out. 
By and large, I have had very good weather for the first week, with only the one cold rainy day with even some freezing rain and snow. It’s 28* in Luray at the moment. But yesterday with the clear views descending from Mary’s Rock, it was easy to see the green line of spring working it’s way up the mountain. At elevation, the trees are still bare with just the understory starting to leaf out. Bloodroot is the most common wildflower followed by violets and spring beauty. The lilies are just emerging. I’ll be moving into lower altitude this week and that ought to portend many more wildflowers. 
Time for breakfast. The hostel has various frozen treats available for microwaving and the coffeemaker is set up. I had my first cup of the hike at Skyland and it was a special treat!  I couldn’t find the microwave treats so I fried a couple of eggs and made a sandwich with some excellent seeded whole grain bread. 
Alison will drive me over to Christ Episcopal Church for the 11:00 Easter Spectacular. That’s the main reason I did the long day on Friday so I could be here for that. I won’t stay for the following Easter Egg Hunt since it’s for children only but will find a restaurant downtown. It’s easy as a hiker when visiting a town to limit interaction to necessary chores, but so much more rewarding to interact with the townsfolk. Who knows but maybe I’ll be invited home for Easter Dinner!  Okay, I’m fantasizing again but it’s hard not to with the hostel kitty Molly sleeping and purring on my lap. She’s projecting her food dreams directly into my brain. 
I wasn’t invited for Easter Dinner, but people were very friendly. Noteworthy is a Tiffany stained glass window above the altar of what I take to be Jesus doing his suffer not the little children gig. Afterwards, I met Hun at what the locals call The Old McDonald’s, now Rancho Viejo Mexican restaurant. Lent is over, so I had a lime margarita the size of a fish bowl and a steak quesadilla grande. I deserve it. I weighed myself this morning and I’ve dropped ten pounds in the past week. Needless to say, that is not sustainable!  I’m perilously close to what I consider my ideal weight.  I commend to you the All You Can Eat; All You Can Carry diet. 
After lunch, I went across the street to the grocery store and then texted Alison to pick me up. She will join Hun and me for dinner tonight.  I am getting to know Hun better and will miss him tomorrow. The way things work on the trail, we are bound to cross paths again.  I’ve also made a reservation for Tuesday night at Mountain Home B&B, an antebellum plantation home 200’ from where the trail crosses U.S. 522 to Front Royal. I stayed in their hiker hostel before in renovated slave quarters. This time I want to stay in the Main House. 
Dinner tonight was a repeat of last night except the entrees were fried chicken, fried shrimp, ham, turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, baked mac & cheese and the veggies were southern green beans and Brussel sprouts. Not even a hiker appetite can induce me to eat the latter. I substituted a slice of chocolate pie now that Lent is over.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661918,"I will miss Alison and Open Arms Hostel!  I slept well last night, having the three-person room to myself again. Alison drove me back to Thornton Gap and I started hiking at 7:30. Almost immediately I noticed a qualitative difference in the trail.  The trail was mostly dirt with relatively few rocks.  Some of it even looked like the photo, lined in bright green grass!  There were a couple of ups in the morning and I arrived at Elkwallow Wayside about 11:45. The grill won’t open until May 5. Alison had mentioned this so I wasn’t crestfallen from expecting a smash burger and a mountain blackberry milkshake and made due with a turkey sandwich and a Diet Coke. I don’t know why I bought a Diet Coke, except out of habit. Sometime this afternoon the blister beneath my calloused feet by my three little toes found a way to drain. I think it will be much more comfortable tomorrow. This afternoon was a 1,000’ up followed by a long down to the shelter side trail. I missed the side trail, in a daze, but I hadn’t gone 10’ when two ladies with two children materialized hiking southbound and corrected my oversight. I am grateful. They were the first hikers I saw today. I wonder how far I would have gone?  
Wildflower is mom of two eight-year old twin girls joined by a friend Lisa. The kids, Butterfly and Stinkbug, are a handful. Butterfly is fascinated by snakes and keeps spotting them, including a copperhead. She also found a bullfrog by the spring and the burrow of a small weasel. Stinkbug contented herself climbing atop the concrete directional post and posing like a statue.  They are tenting below the shelter. 
Three thru-hikers from last year are doing a reunion hike and celebrating in the shelter. Love and Forever celebrated their wedding in Hot Springs last year. Fuzz, named for his uncontrollable black hair, is a dear friend to them, possessed of a droll wit. They plan to tent to escape a large rat named Annabelle who lives in the shelter. I am tenting above the shelter. 
It warmed up nicely today, starting about 30* and getting near 60*. I stripped layers this morning, but now that the sun is going down (it’s 5:30), it’s getting chilly. I had an early dinner of Ramen and tuna, knowing I wouldn’t be very hungry after the wayside. 
Curious George texted me, extending an invitation to spend a night with him and his wife Stephanie sometime this week. Friday, when I would have been at Bears Den Hostel looks good to me, but we’ll have to finalize arrangements tomorrow. There is no signal here. 
The ladies who pointed out the shelter path to me met AJ at about 10:00 this morning. Because I took a zero day in Luray, she is now a day ahead of me. 
It’s too early for sleep but I’m chilly enough to want to get into my sleeping bag!  Good sleeping weather!","Thornton Gap (Luray)
",Gravel Springs Hut,"Apr 10, Mon",14.30
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661928,"It got cold last night, not cold enough to freeze my water bottle, but cold enough for me to be uncomfortable in my 35* sleeping bag. I woke up shivering a few times!  Fortunately, it looks like the last really cold night. I woke up at 5:30 with the intention of hiking by 6:45, but it didn’t happen. Another hiker, GI Joe, came in and kept Annabelle company. He thinks there are two rats. He thru-hiked a few years ago, then did the Long Trail and the Adirondacks 4.000 footers. Now he’s back to hike all of the 500 miles of trail in Shenandoah National Park. He lives in upstate New York. So I left at 7:40.  The trail immediately climbs Mt Marshall and a few miles later, Compton Peak. Then it’s mostly downhill and level until the park boundary.  I saw neither a Ranger nor a bear in the park, but scads of deer. Just north of the park boundary is the steep Rocky descent of Possum Ridge and then a switchbacked descent to the fence marking the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Center used for breeding endangered species. None were visible today. The center was developed by the U.S. Army to breed cavalry horses. 
Mountain Home Hostel and B&B is located just a couple of hundred steps from where the trail crosses U.S. 522. I opted for the B&B and it is very nice indeed, recently renovated in an antebellum plantation house. The slave quarters known as The Cabbin is the hostel. I’ve stayed there before, but this time I wanted a private bath and the opportunity to soak in the tub. My left foot continues to bother me. Scott and Lisa are gracious hosts, doing my laundry and shuttling me into Front Royal and back. I started at the outfitters for three freeze dried dinners and then ate at the Thai Restaurant adjoining the Baymont Motel.
The broth of the Tom Yum seafood soup was delicious, quite spicy, but the mussels, calamari and scallops were over done. The shrimp were fine. I’ve ordered the Crispy Duck with fried basil several times on previous visits to Front Royal. This time the breading seemed overly thick and cloying. It was good, but not orgasmic, but at any rate quite filling. 
I walked over to Martins Supermarket and bought food for the next few days to Harpers Ferry. I phoned the B&B and Lisa quickly picked me up. After sorting through my purchases and getting my pack ready for tomorrow, I soaked in the tub long enough to prune my toes, hoping it would help the blister. I wrote this entry while in the tub, but that isn’t why there is no photo today or yesterday. The Wi-Fi isn’t strong enough. 
I’m looking forward to breakfast at 7:30 tomorrow and setting out once more. I’m intentionally reducing my daily miles on this next section for the sake of my foot and to allow my body to consolidate its gains. A thru hike is not a sprint!A brief update:  Altra approved my warranty claim for the delaminating Vibram soles and has issued full credit. I’ll order another pair to replace my spare pair that Tom has sent to Harpers Ferry. Good for Altra to stand behind their products!","Gravel Springs Hut

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661960,"Breakfast was scrambled eggs with veggies and cheese, fruit plate including berries, melons, and kiwi, orange juice, toast and coffee. Scott’s homemade jams were featured with the toast. A southbounder who had slept in a basement room for less joined me for breakfast. He’s a performing arts director for a New Hampshire theater and knows the Flynn in Burlington and it’s recently retired director who I also know. The trail is a very small place!  
I didn’t start my hike until 9:40 but reached Jim & Molly Denton Shelter, 5.2 miles uphill, in just two hours and ate an early lunch. There was a group of twelve retired persons from  Washington, DC who try to hike every Wednesday, spread out along the trail. I passed about half of them and five never made to Denton Shelter. One of them was an older man who didn’t look well at all. I asked if he were okay. He said he wants to get back into hiking. I asked if he had checked with his doctor and he said that he had. Not my problem. I did enjoy the company at lunch and was able to save one man possible embarrassment by loaning him my toilet paper for the privy. Perhaps loan is not the correct term!
By then it was getting rather warm, reaching 82*, and I suffered on the two remaining ups of the day, including a long stretch of mountain top meadow in full sun. I took break at the picnic table at the Tucker’s Lane trailhead before the final up to the shelter. This is one of the original shelters dating to the 1930’s. There are said to be copperheads in the rocks below the fire pit — I won’t be checking — and quite possibly a resident black snake. That’s quite possible. When I swept the shelter floor, there were no mouse turds. Black snakes make fine shelter companions and will also keep any copperheads at bay. The piped spring below the shelter is gushing and refreshingly cold. 
My blister on the bottom of my left foot drained into my sock today and the dressing remained in place. I’m hopeful it is on the mend now, with no sign of infection. 
Tomorrow’s high is forecast to reach 85* so I am hoping for an early start. Tomorrow’s section takes me through Sky Meadows State Park and a significant part is will be in full sun. 
Today’s section, starting at Tucker’s Lane is George’s maintenance section. As you can see, parts of it are lovely, an ailée of redbuds.   [Note: You can’t see — the photo won’t upload — use your imagination.] At the lower elevation today, compared to Shenandoah National Park, the understory is fully leafed out.","U.S. 522 - Mountain Home B&B

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662043,"I was alone last night and slept soundly in the shelter, without even a mouse for company. I started on top of my sleeping bag, but by morning was zipped inside. I started hiking at first light, about 6:20 making excellent time to Sky Meadows State Park. I saw a few white trillium and was looking forward to the trillium “garden” that is world renowned. Unfortunately, either side of the trail for some distance had been brutally bush hogged. The wildflowers were not spared. I noticed last fall that the trail was overgrown in this area, but nothing that a little judicious hand pruning wouldn’t have managed. On the north side of the park is a memorial bench, a welcome opportunity for a break. That’s where I saw my first people of the day, five section hikers heading south. And it’s also where the heat of the day started bothering me. I trudged on, stopping at a stream for more water. It was the first time on this hike that starting with two liters wasn’t enough for the day’s hike. The blister behind my three smaller toes is healing, but my effort to avoid putting pressure on it has resulted in another blister on the back of my heel. I really do need a zero day!
To compensate for the lost trillium, the trail provided an abundance of bluebells today and the mayapples are just starting to bloom, cute white blossoms hanging demurely under the umbrella leaves. 
I arrived at Rod Hollow Shelter at about 2:00 totally spent. The shelter and food pavilion are overrun with large carpenter bees!  Hundreds of them busily flitting about in their loud droning way. They don’t sting but are very annoying, so I’ve set up my tent. The spring is piped and running well. I doctored my blisters. Tomorrow is only 10.5 miles but it is the Roller Coaster, a series of steep ups and downs. I’ll make to Snickers Gap to meet Stephanie, George’s wife by 2:30.  If I’m early, I’ll hang out at Bears Den Hostel and enjoy a Dr. Pepper.  I only rarely have carbonated beverages at home, other than diet tonic water, and a mini-Diet Coke a couple of times a month. But out here, I crave Dr. Pepper fully sugared, even the ersatz product stocked in Shenandoah. And the past couple of days, I’ve been craving pizza, which I haven’t had yet on this hike. I try to think about more elevated things as I hike along or just get swept up into the beauty of it all, but lately thoughts of food, glorious food, have crept in. I think my hiker appetite is emerging. 
A couple of day hikers, Pat and Rolf,  stopped into the shelter, asking if there were any water. I pointed out the path to the spring and asked how they were going to treat the water since they looked kind of naive. They were nonplussed, assuming that back country water is naturally pristine and pure. I assured them that it MIGHT be and suggested they visit a local outfitter to explore treatment options. I filtered a couple of liters for them and was rewarded with a bunch of grapes!  A fair trade indeed.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662083,"I was alone again last night and slept very well. One dream featured the cast of Seinfeld, without an overarching plot. I left at first light and soon came to the sign announcing the start of the Roller Coaster.  Look at the screen shot and the name makes sense. Because of a narrow right-of-way, the trail builders were forced to follow the razorback ridge without switchbacking or escalators. Steep trail equates to eroded trail, meaning that much of the day was on rock. Most thru-hikers rank the Roller Coaster in their Top 10 sections of nasty trail. In terms of difficulty, I would rate it as a 7 on a 0-10 scale. I’m pleased that my knees and legs were fine. The impact, however, was unkind to my blisters and really slowed me down. 
I met a fair number of hikers today. My favorite was a guy from Texas about my age, flip-flop thru-hiking starting south from Harpers Ferry. I asked if he had a name yet. He was considering using what his doctor said when he told him about of his hike plans, “You!”  I think You! is a fine name. I also enjoyed meeting a Hoosier section hiker named, So Far So Good. 
Curious George’s wife Stephanie met me at the parking area at Snickers Gap, below Bears Den. On the way to their house in Warrenton, we stopped at a CVS. I needed more blister dressings and some quart Zip-Locs. A shower felt blissful and I confirm my ten pound weight loss in the first two weeks. Tonight’s dinner of hamburgers, stuffed shells, salad and chocolate chip cookies should help address my calorie deficit. What a wonderful surprise this has been.
Light rain is forecast tomorrow, but the low tonight will be only 61*, so just a rain jacket will be fine. There’s still a little bit of Roller Coaster left, but for the most part, it should be a much more pleasant day l, ending at the palatial David Lesser Shelter.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662135,"Today I cried for the second time on this hike. I don’t normally leak, but out here in the woods my feelings are close to the surface and just escape sometimes. The first time was with Hun in Luray. He was telling me about his son having a terrible accident and dying in his arms. Cue the waterworks.  Then today I decided to take my lunch break at Wilson Gap, just below Blackburn Trail Center. There was a troupe of Girl Scouts and I asked I could join them. With their permission, I sat on a fallen log and assembled my chicken salad on tortilla wrap. They had lots of good questions for me, like how I could carry water for several months. At one point I told them how fortunate they were to be in a troupe with leaders who would support them however they saw themselves and expressed a little envy for not having had that opportunity. Again came the tears. One of the leaders said, “You’re not only a Sugarfoot but a sugar heart!”  All together now, “Awwww.”  They will be following my journal and promise me cookies if I make it all the way.  With an incentive like that, how can I fail?  They are staying at Blackburn Center. I could have stayed there instead of David Lesser Shelter and still gotten into Harpers Ferry early in the afternoon. They even tempting me with s’mores if I had!  
Curious George fed me well this morning with bacon, scrambled eggs with mushrooms, red bell peppers and cheese, fresh berries and melon and toast. He dropped me off at Snickers Gap at 8:30 on his way to clear water bars on his maintenance section. A section hiker, Draggin (as in my ass) from North Carolina started the same time. He’s been following my journal and I enjoyed walking with him for a while. Being a weekend, there were lots of hikers. I especially enjoyed Hari, an Indian-American who has hiked to Everest base camp and plans to climb Kilimanjaro this year but whose dream is to thru-hike the AT. At 11:15, I came upon  a group of eight Swiss and German men celebrating the sign marking the official end of the Roller Coaster! They come over for a couple of weeks a year to slackpack the AT. They started in Georgia years ago and passed 1,000 miles yesterday. They are basing at a hotel in Winchester for one more night and then will relocate to a hotel further north. One guy does all the planning and no one complains. They are planning to join an REI hike transecting the Presidental Range in New Hampshire using the AMC huts in June. Their only connection is their association with the aluminum industry in Europe. 
I saw the first blooming native flame azalea of my hike this morning and took this photo. I haven’t seen another, but it won’t be long. I also passed the WV/VA state line this morning!
David Lesser is a premier shelter of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club with a modern shelter and a separate dining pavilion. The only issue is that the spring is about 0.3 miles steeply downhill, with a large blowdown adding insult to injury. The six-person shelter has five hikers in it tonight. Two women my age, Linda and Anita, are along one side. They are both lovely!  I met them last year on my spring hike.  I’m on the other side. Between us is a young couple, Eric and his dog Levi and Fancy from Harpers Ferry. I wonder if I’ll need my ear plugs?  
The blisters didn’t bother me as much today but are still a nuisance. If they are not looking better by Monday after a relatively easy day into Harpers Ferry tomorrow, I may seek out a walk-in clinic. If I need to stay in Harpers Ferry a couple of days, that’s okay, but I really want them resolved before hiking on!","Snickers Gap (home with Curious George)

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662165,"I didn’t need earplugs last night. The only snoring was an occasional snorgle probably from Levi the black mostly Labrador dog. I tried leaving this morning without changing the dressings on my blisters but that didn’t work very well so I found a convenient blowdown to sit on and tend to them. Then i could move okay. Laura Mae who was tenting at the shelter last night came along and we hiked together to Harpers Ferry. I was grateful for her company both in and of itself and also as a distraction from the blisters. Laura is a registered nurse at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore as a travel nurse. She works four 12-hour shifts and then has four days off, giving her time to pick up sections of the Appalachian Trail. We separated at the end of the bridge over the Shenandoah River at noon, Laura to catch a shuttle to the Harpers Ferry Visitors Center where her car is parked and me to walk to the nearby Quality Inn. 
I went ahead and extended my stay through Tuesday and they were able to find me a room I could keep for all three days and I was able to check in early. The guest laundry costing $4.75 really made me appreciate the $1.75 price at Lewis Mountain Campground last week. So now at 3:00 my clothes is clean, I am clean, and I have a grocery list for this evening. Dick and Laurie Potteiger are picking me up at 4:30 for dinner and grocery shopping. Laurie served as “trail mom” for ATC for many years and is a good friend. It will be fun to catch up!
I’ve redone my blisters with antibiotic ointment and waterproof bandages and my foot is feeling better. I’ll need to buy more blister supplies this evening. I am still wondering what brought on the blisters. I wore the same model shoe and socks for about 500 miles of walking back home in Burlington without problems either with my feet or the shoes. Perhaps the manufacturing defect of this specific pair with the delamination of the sole and the disintegration of the upper led to the blisters.  More of the tread came loose today.  At any rate, I’ll pick up the replacement shoes tomorrow morning and walk minimally for the next couple of days. The foot feels so good at the moment that I’m tempted to resume my hike on Tuesday, but I’m not that stupid. When I leave on Wednesday I want to be able to enjoy my hike and hike at a more normal speed.  Maybe I can find a product tonight named something like Blister Be Gone and think no more about them. 
Tomorrow I’ll also pick up my thru-hiker hangtag at ATC Headquarters and either tomorrow or Tuesday pick up a gas canister and a few supplies at the local outfitter. 
A woman named Vicki who has been following my journal is taking me for lunch tomorrow in Middletown. There are Middletowns nearby in both Virginia and Maryland. I haven’t been to either, so it will be a special treat for me. She also hid a Dr Pepper for me at Keys Gap this morning, but because my phone was in airplane mood, I missed out on it. I wonder what it is about Dr Pepper that makes me adore them when I’m hiking but not at home. Maybe it’s like my only crying in the woods. At any rate, I will enjoy meeting a new person tomorrow and am already feeling grateful and humble for the attention.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662223,"Laurie and I ended up at Mi Degollato Mexican Restaurant in nearby Charles Town last night. Laurie’s husband Dick was unable to join us, much to my regret. I had a large lime Margarita and the Enchilada Supreme, four enchiladas, one beef, one chicken, one bean and one cheese, all buried beneath cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. I resisted licking the plate clean. The taste reminded me of Manuel’s Restaurant in Athens, Georgia where Tom and I ate in our early years together, making it a very nostalgic meal for me. Then to Martins for groceries and CVS for blister pads. I found some cushioned Compeed hydrocolloid gel pads designed for the bottom of the foot and tried one this morning. It’s a major improvement, and I’m optimistic about resuming my hike on Wednesday. 
Breakfast at Quality Inns is hit or miss. This one is one of the better ones, featuring genuinely fluffy biscuits, sausage patties, and egg-like yellow ovals. There’s also sausage gravy that I’m not fond of, and also the typical hotel waffle station with flavored corn syrup, and yogurt, pastries, cereal, and a bowl of apples, along with juices and coffee.  If I were really craving a great breakfast, I would walk to the Country Café in Bolivar, which adjoins Harpers Ferry, but it won’t be open again until Thursday. 
I walked up to ATC Headquarters this morning, recited the seven Leave No Trace principles and received my official thru hiker’s hangtag. I like the color, although rainbow would be even better!  The Post Office had the package Tom sent. The new shoes grip my feet slightly better so should reduce the chance for more blisters. The Vibram soles are black, white and green on the new shoes instead of solid black, so perhaps they will hold together better. I can hope. 
Vicki Lynn picked me up at 11:30. I was a little fearful that she might be a stalker or worse, but instead she is one of the great angels of the trail, kindly people who genuinely go out of their way to help hikers. Vicki is a retired CPA who worked for the FDIC and lives with her husband in Rockville, MD. A friend’s daughter thru hiked the PCT and kept an online journal, including instances of being surprised and helped by strangers. Vicki was hooked when she realized how close she lives to the AT in Harpers Ferry and Maryland. Collecting thru hikers has been her hobby for several years now. She targets thru hikers either through their online journals, like me, or by visiting Dahlgren Campground and Gathland, often bringing portions of restaurant takeaway or homemade food and driving hikers wherever they need to go. She took me to the Main Cup in Middletown, MD for lunch, a very nice slightly funky restaurant. We shared an appetizer of assemble-your-own romaine lettuce wraps with a warm crispy Brussels sprouts leaves, bacon, Parmesan balsamic mixture, insisting that I eat most of it. I ordinarily avoid Brussel sprouts, but these were delicious. I followed with a humongous but elegant Cobb salad. Then Vicki showed me the sights of rural Maryland including Boonesboro before taking me to the outfitter in Harpers Ferry and back to the hotel. She left me with food for tonight and tomorrow, including six large slices of pizza, a quart of beef barley soup made by her husband, six of her homemade brownies, a Cherry Dr Pepper and an orange. Vicki more than earned her angel wings. I would nominate her for a higher rank in the Celestial Hierarchy, a trail archangel or even a trail principality!

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662310,"The magic continues. There was some difficulty checking in at the hotel on Sunday. I wanted to extend my reservation by a day, avoid having to switch rooms, check in early, and be on the first floor to avoid the flight of stairs. Yeah, I know, Princess and the Pea. The manager was harried, training a new desk clerk, and the computer system wasn’t behaving. She was unflappable and succeeded. Then I asked for $5 in quarters for the guest laundry and thought I gave her a five dollar bill. A couple of hours later, the manager phoned and asked if she could come down for a minute. When the trainee counted the till, they were $5 short. They assumed, quite reasonably, that in my confused transaction, they had forgotten to take my proffered bill. No problem. Then yesterday, the manager phoned and came down again. The night auditor found they were $5 over. They reviewed the lobby security video and I had paid for the quarters. So she returned my $5 with a small hiker gift bag of a green tea drink, a granola bar and a bag of Cheddar Goldfish! As a former auditor, this kind of thing warms my heart (yes, CPAs do have hearts). Employee honesty starts with the tone at the top, so kudos to the manager. It’s hard to admit an error. 
Today is a true zero day. I reserved a room at the Cobblestone Hotel near Pen Mar Park where I’ll be on Saturday. There were only a couple of rooms available and since hotels are pricing like airlines now, they were more expensive than I would have liked, even with a 20% hiker discount. I also ordered a small selection of chocolates for Archangel Vicki, not that I could ever thank her enough for yesterday!  My remaining chores today are packing up, walking over to The Rabbit Hole for lunch, taking a long soak in the tub while reading a Canterbury tale in Middle English (if I drown, you’ll know why), and reheating Vicki’s leftovers for dinner.  A most arduous day to be sure!  I am ready to be hiking again. 
The fish and chips at The Rabbit Hole were so-so, but the local Abolitionist IPA was delicious, unfiltered in the Vermont style, and almost creamy.  The server was a charmer and I tipped her well.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662374,"What a lovely day of bright sun and gentle breeze and kind trail. It was 32* when I left the Quality Inn after breakfast. The trail starts just about 100’ away with an uphill and side hill trail around Harpers Ferry before descending to historic Lower Town. Deer were everywhere along the trail and have made nuisances of themselves in town, cute nuisances albeit. The trail crosses the Potomac River on a walkway cantilevered from a railroad bridge. As is the fashion now, there were dozens and dozens of locks attached to the fencing and structure, each engraved with the initials or names of couples bound together for eternity. Who says love is dead?  The walkway ends at a metal staircase spiraling down to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath, another unit of the National Park Service.
There I met Mike, a retired U.S. Army Master Sergeant who is walking to Georgetown in Washington, D.C.  He has previous walked to Nebraska to visit family. We both intended to saunter down the lovely near level path but somehow kept gaining speed until one of us remembered our goal. The 2.8 miles, the easiest part of the Appalachian Trail, passed too quickly. Good company makes short work of the trail!  
In the adjacent parking area below Weverton Cliffs, I met a cyclist just starting on his ride to Oregon. He had previously peddled cross country via U.S. Bicycle Route 76 that goes through Damascus, Virginia, reputed to be the friendliest town on the AT.  His bike was custom built for touring on rough terrain.  
It was still nice and cool for the 1,000’ climb to the ridge of South Mountain. I didn’t go out to the cliffs this time and just maintained a steady rhythm. I didn’t break a sweat. From there the trail just bumpety bumps along without much elevation change, following an old woods road. What a contrast to the Roller Coaster of last week. 
While taking my 10:00 break, Coach and Mario came along. They are serial section hikers, this year going from Harpers Ferry to Mt Holly, PA.   We leapfrogged each other during the morning. They stopped at Ed Garvey Shelter for a break. I continued going until lunch at Brownsville Gap.  We hiked together to Gathland State Park with the memorial arch to war correspondents killed in combat.  I arrived at Compton Gap Shelter, 0.3 miles east of the trail at 2:00, still wearing my long-sleeve zipper t-shirt.  Coach and Mario went on to the next shelter, doing 15+ miles on their first day. Coach is a retired high school football coach and athletic director and strikes me as a compulsive planner who feels duty bound to follow his plan regardless of conditions and physical complaint. Mario goes along with whatever Coach plans. Not feeling compelled to turn my hike into a death march, I doubt that I’ll see them again. 
I intended to tent here at Crampton Gap on one of the well-maintained tent platforms near the AT. I didn’t feel good about leaving my pack there while I came down to the shelter 0.3 miles for water. I knew that the shelter dated from the 1930’s and was surprised to find it in excellent condition with a recently added wooden front porch. The spring is flowing nicely and there’s a wooden bridge to the composting privy. It’s all set in such a lovely quiet ravine that I decided to stay down at the shelter. I swept out the shelter and as a bonus, it appears to be mouse-free!
Five Mainers are now tented above, including two awesome hiking grannies and three high school seniors who will be starting their southbound thru-hike after graduation in June. The grannies are showing them the ropes.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662419,"As I was eating dinner last night (Knorrs Parmesan Noodles with tuna), a young woman rushed onto the shelter porch, dropped her pack, and grabbed her toilet paper. The privy is just across a wooden bridge. When she came back, feeling much more relaxed, we introduced ourselves. Sara is 35, from Frankfurt, Germany where she works for the federal police in airport security. Her English is good enough so we can communicate. She came over to hike the trail, hoping to thru hike, and started today from Harpers Ferry. She is not very experienced but she will be soon. Meanwhile Sara is asking many questions.  She is bringing out paternal feelings in me!  We shared the shelter. 
After eating breakfast and using the privy, I left the shelter about 7:00.  After just a couple of miles I started feeling the urge to poop again. It was still several miles to a shelter and privy or to Dahlgren’s Backpacking Campsite that has real flush toilets. I tried to hold out but the urge became more incessant. The Leave No Trace guideline is to walk 200’ off trail, dig a cathole, squat and attend to business. Sometimes LNT has to be taken as an aspirational goal. I had time to drop my pack, grab my toilet paper and run maybe 20’ from the trail, lower my shorts and explode, all the while praying that no one would come along. My prayer was answered and I spent about 10 minutes burying the evidence. 
Shortly after, a northbound thru-hiker who had started in Georgia trotted by, serving as yet another reminder of my age. 
Sara came along and we enjoyed a break at Dahlgren’s. The State of Maryland operates a free bath house for hikers there, complete with hot showers. Today was a hot humid day. What was the point of showering when we would be just as sticky again in just a few minutes?  I left first and climbed to the Washington Monument, a round stone tower on the ridge said to be the first memorial to our first President. I stopped for lunch shortly after. Sara passed me and a couple, Magilla Gorilla and Broomhilda came along. They are in their 50’s and 60’s and are flip flop thru hiking. They started at the first crossing of the Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park a week before I did and are proceeding slowly and deliberately. They are coming to Pine Knob Shelter tonight.  I move ahead. 
When I got to the campground by the shelter, Sara was here getting water and taking a rest before moving on. It was only 2:00 so I don’t fault her. I probably won’t see her again. I got water from a piped spring and set my tent. I apparently snagged my puffy on something this morning and when I put it into my pack this morning, I noticed that it was shedding feathers. I repaired it with a needle and thread and was very glad that I thought to pack a needle threader!  
Magilla Gorilla and Broomhilda came in and will be staying in the shelter. Broomhilda earned her name by sweeping out the shelter three times. Magilla had mentioned that he uses a CPAP machine at night, one of the reasons I chose to tent. Magilla retired as a master sergeant in the U.S. Army (my second in as many days) and then worked for the New York Highway Patrol. They live near Ithaca, New York. Broomhilda worked as an events planner for Cornell University. We enjoyed dinner together and now I’m looking forward to a good night’s sleep. Tomorrow will be a shorter day for me but I hope to start early to beat the heat.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662507,"It was miserably hot and humid last night. I fell asleep lying on top of my sleeping bag, before sunset. I was awoken about 9:00 by sirens on nearby I-70 that I crossed shortly before the shelter. The car noise is like white noise, but the trucks downshifting to get up to the gap got old very quickly.  In my semi-conscious state, I panicked because it seemed like a white flashlight was strobing on my tent. I made sure my headlamp was off, before remembering that it only flashes in red mode. And I checked my iPhone. I finally looked outside. There was a tower in the middle distance with a bright white flashing light. Could it be part of an airport approach system or a UFO landing signal?  I don’t know what it was other than very annoying. By then it had cooled down enough to make my unzipped sleeping bag comfortable. 
I awoke at 5:00 and starting hiking at 6:30 with the climb up Annapolis Rock which was not difficult. With the exception of one rather long “rock garden,” it was a pleasant hike. Even taking three breaks and stopping at a stream before the shelter for water, I still arrived here before 11:00. The shelter is modern with a second sleeping level. I played Broomhilda and swept it out. No mouse turds, always a sign of quality lodgings. I explored the shelter area, locating the tent pads, a new composting privy and bear pole and “bathed,” meaning wiped myself off with a wet bandana, and set up in the shelter. I want an early start tomorrow. 
The Verizon signal is weak here, but from a high point along the way, I texted a shuttle driver for a ride from Pen Mar Park to the Cobblestone Hotel tomorrow. I may not know if he responds until tomorrow. I’m not worried. It always works out, especially since it will be Saturday and lots of people around, one of whom just may be a trail angel ready to earn their wings by taking me to the hotel. I am not above playing the pitiful old man card. On the other hand, rain is supposed to move in about 1PM. 
Magilla Gorilla and Broomhilda arrived about 3:00 in the heat of the day. I’m glad to have missed it!  A northbound thru hiker stopped in to eat a pizza he had delivered to the road below and then hiked on for another 5 miles, bringing his total for today to 25. Oh, to be young!","Pine Knob Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662522,"Another northbounder came in last night. His name is something like Nobody and he wasn’t talkative. I don’t even know if he is thru hiking. There was gentle snoring in the shelter, easily cancelled by my ear plugs. I slept well and awakened at 5:00. I left at 6:00, just bright enough to see the blazes, and made very good time until the steep long rocky climb of Raven Rock. Good time for me means anything in excess of 2 MPH. 
The highlight of the day was meeting another scout troop on top of Raven Rock. It was an all-gender Boy Scout troop. I asked one of the leaders which genders they had. She replied, “Many,” and indeed the scouts appeared to my eyes to represent a broad spectrum of gender and sexuality. Oh what fun that would have been for me growing up!  They said they sometimes have problems with other scout troops at jamborees and such, but within the troop, they seem tightly bonded. When meeting groups like this, I feel optimistic for our future. 
Shortly after meeting them, I had a strong cell signal and was able to reach Dennis the shuttle driver. I estimated 11:00 for my arrival at Pen Mar, but the steep rocky descent of Raven Rock slowed me down. Also I stopped to photograph a 6’ black snake very near the park. I kept Dennis waiting for 10 minutes. It’s only about a ten minute drive to the Cobblestone Inn but I wouldn’t want to walk it. He’ll pick me up 9:00 tomorrow morning. 
My room wasn’t ready yet, but the desk clerk let me leave my pack in their meeting room. I took my rain jacket in my day pack and walked over to Masa Sushi & Asian in a strip of stores perpendicular to the Walmart. My server, June, originally from Indonesia was a joy to visit with. He is fascinated that anyone, let alone an old man, would voluntarily choose to wander in the woods. Then again, June loves baseball and willingly sits through live games, something I would find akin to torture. The tom yum soup with shrimp was better than I had in Front Royal and really the perfect thing to rehydrate me. The green salad that came with the lunch sushi rolls was 90% iceberg lettuce, but this isn’t exactly à great metropolitan area. The rolls, a crispy shrimp and a spicy yellowtail, were better than grocery store sushi but barely dented my appetite. I’ll deal with that at Applebees tonight!
A Super Walmart is always an adventure to me and overwhelming. I fear I bought too much to get me to Boiling Springs but the packages were all so large. I needed my rain jacket to return to the Cobblestone. There were even small hailstones. The storm should pass in time for dinner.  Shortly after I returned and still way in advance of check-in time, my room was ready.  I was expecting to pay $167 with the 20% hiker discount but the super nice clerk cancelled that reservation and charged me only $122. I don’t know why I am having such good fortune with lodging on this hike, but I am very grateful!
I showered while my clothes washed. Two GA-ME thru hikers and a hiker finishing up his incomplete thru from last year have checked in. They are making many more miles than I am so are not potential tramily.  The blisters that were bothering me are mostly healed but now I’m dealing with one sore toe on each foot. That’s much easier to put up with, but sometimes I think these problems are not happenstance or caused by anything in particular but are God’s way of keeping my mileage down and forcing me to be kind to Brother Ass. 
Brother Ass ate well this evening at Applebees, piling calories upon calories with very little effort: a side Caesar salad, a whiskey bacon burger piled high with fried onions, bacon, tomato and lettuce and a side of fried onion rings.  Pause to belch. The only disappointment was their selection of draft beers which were flavorless and lackluster, Mondelo and Sam Adams’ Summer Ale coming the closest to real beer.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662587,"I stopped 1.2 miles before my intended destination, Tumbling Run Shelters. I’ll explain that in a bit.
As is often the case with the first night sleeping indoors, I didn’t sleep well, and my left big toe was bothering me. Breakfast was reconstituted eggs that resembled little yellow turds, hockey puck biscuits, juice and coffee, but I lucked out by being early and snagged a fresh navel orange. Dennis picked me up on time and delivered me back to Pen Mar Park. A group of people waved to me. I naturally waved back, but couldn’t recognize them until I got closer. It was the all-gender scout troop from yesterday, just having finished their hike and doing a post-mortem on the good, the bad, and the ugly of their hike. Such sweet kids!  
The trail skirts the northern edge of the park, soon crossing the train tracks that once carried passengers on the Western Maryland Railroad from Baltimore to Pen Mar Park for a band concert in the pavilion. The park was built by the railroad to increase their passenger count. Then the trail crosses the Mason-Dixon Line into Pennsylvania. When I first hiked this section in 1998, one of the original survey markers was here. It was since appropriated as a souvenir so now a simple wooden sign suffices. 
The trail today was very good, with relatively few rocky areas.  Even so, I found it intolerable to hike with my big left toe. Kicking a rock or whatever led to a stifled scream and stars. The blisters that plagued me last week have healed up, but the toe does not look good. I took a lunch break at Deer Lick Shelters and decided that medical attention is needed. Some local day hikers wandered by and confirmed that Waynesboro, PA is the nearest hospital. There’s an adjacent walk-in clinic open until 8PM tonight. I phoned Amberson House, a B&B in Waynesboro not far from the hospital.  The innkeeper Amanda was very nice, but they are fully booked. What she will do is shuttle me back to Waynesboro for a minimal fee. So I’m sitting in a park pavilion now awaiting her. I’ll probably stay at the Days Inn downtown and  walk over to the walk-in clinic about a mile away. Hopefully it’s just a matter of cleaning my toe up and maybe a course of antibiotics, but we will see. I had planned to zero in Duncannon, but a zero in Waynesboro will be just as much fun!  
The walk-in clinic was very efficient. It was a mile away. I sponged off first, not wanting to shower since it would mean having to replace the colloidal gel dressings. I showered yesterday and today was cool enough, a high in the low 50’s, that I never sweat. The nurse assistant took my history but didn’t need much. They were able to access my University of Vermont Healthcare records!  She asked me to remove my shoes, socks and dressings. When I tried removing the bandage from my big toe, the toe nail started to lift too. “Never mind,” she said, clearly grossed out. The nurse practitioner confirmed that my blisters have healed but when she started to remove the dressing from the big toe, I suggested that she first apply some freezing spray. Much better!  She confirms that it’s infected and prescribed a 10-day course of Keflex. Unfortunately, CVS closes at 5PM on Sunday, so I’ll have to walk back tomorrow morning for the antibiotic. Meanwhile I’m to leave the nurse’s dressing on and avoid getting it wet. The nurse practitioner says that I should feel better soon and probably taking two days off will be enough. I’m pretty sure that the toe nail will come off with the dressing and that alone will remove a lot of pain. They always grow back, but like a lizard’s tail, never quite as nice. 
So I’m luxuriating at the Days Inn for the next two days. I’m downtown instead of in a big box oasis like last night. There’s a wide array of food to choose from.  Tonight, on the recommendation of the clinic staff, was Montezuma’s Mexican. Excellent!  There’s a little Japanese restaurant, Sapporo’s, that Amanda enjoys. And I noticed a barber shop just a couple of blocks down Main Street.","Pen Mar Park (Cobblestone Hotel)

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662632,"A town visit for me usually entails trying to arrive in time for lunch, doing laundry and grocery shopping, having dinner, and returning to the trail after breakfast. I did all of that at the Cobblestone on Saturday. So I find myself with two days of unexpected time in Waynesboro, PA with none of my usual chores needing to be done except for eating. My dance card is nearly empty. I walked through downtown along Main Street yesterday on the way to the walk-in clinic. There are definite signs of life and a number of cute restaurants and stores l, even a tea room, along with businesses like  barber shops and a gun shop and range, and a lot of urban infill since Waynesboro Mall opened, stores like Dollar General and various used goods stores (antiques), a game store, tattoo parlor and a massage parlor. And a lot of churches ranging from Catholic to mainline Protestant to storefront evangelical ministries. My first impression of Waynesboro is of a town in recovery.  A local nonprofit, Mainstreet Waynesboro, Inc, seems to be spearheading the effort and sponsored a Downtown Food Stroll yesterday. 
There is a one-screen movie theater downtown, with 80 for Brady currently showing.  I don’t think so. The Alexander Hamilton Memorial Free Library opens at 10AM so that may be a foot-friendly place to sit and catch up on periodicals. 
From Wikipedia, I’ve learned that the Borough of Waynesboro in the Cumberland Valley was settled in 1749 and has a population of about 11,000.  The first settlers were Scotch-Irish but it quickly came to be dominated by Pennsylvania Germans. It’s named after Revolutionary War General Mad Anthony Wayne and was an early milling center. It played a role in the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War. In the early 20th century, it was a manufacturing center.  A number of local structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  There is a public museum and park, but that would entail walking and standing. Maybe next time I find myself captive in Waynesboro. The Waynesboro Historical Society is nearby in a restored Queen Anne house, but it’s only open for a few hours on Saturday and by appointment. 
Now I feel oriented to Waynesboro but no closer to knowing how to fill the next two days. My first task after the complementary breakfast at the Days Inn will be to walk the mile back to the CVS for my prescription.  Ah, breakfast!  Your choice of three cereals, partially frozen white or raisin bread (a toaster is provided), frozen butter, mini-yogurts, and the ubiquitous waffle maker, juice dispenser, and coffee machine.
The one-mile walk to and from the CVS was extremely uncomfortable, but mitigated by a stop at The Crispy Biscuit for brunch. This 1958-themed diner/restaurant features chrome and Formica tables and an aqua/coral color scheme. As you can see, the portions are enormous. What you can’t see is how delicious it was. I ate all of the western omelet and biscuit, but left a few potato morsels. The antibiotic is to be taken with food and the Days Inn breakfast just didn’t qualify. 
Now that I’ve started the prescription, I could remove the nurse practitioner’s dressing. As I expected, the big toe nail came away with it, leaving an nascent nail beneath it. And as I had hoped, the pain vanished along with the nail. This sounds much grosser than it is. Shedding toe nails is common among runners and hikers.  Now I can finally shower.  I have no other plan for today until dinner. I want to allow the toe to air.
About 3:00 I started going stir crazy. I put an ordinary bandage over the big toe, just to keep it clean, and the toe was uncomplaining on the walk to the library. Unfortunately, the selection of magazines was on the rather skimpy side, so I settled for the New York Times. Not many restaurants are open on Monday, so I tried Waynesburger for a burger and fries. Really good!

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662690,"My day started with a hearty (not!) Days Inn breakfast. It was down to freezing again this morning but that looks to be the end of the cold weather.  Dennis, the excellent shuttler from Sunday, will carry me back to Old Forge Park tomorrow morning. I have a tentative plan for making up these two toe days by the time I leave Duncannon, but I will listen closely to Brother Ass. If his hooves are hurting, he won’t be traveling far or fast. 
I have an appointment at the Alex Ivan Barber Shop, very near the Days Inn, at 11:30 for a haircut and a beard trim. I am amazed how unkempt I become in only four weeks.  Some thru hikers take a Nazirite vow for the duration of their hike, forswearing haircuts, wine and grape products, and contact with corpses.  There are apparently no restrictions on beer and pizza. No Samson am I. Not only am I getting a haircut, but I also had raisin bread at breakfast. 
My first delightful surprise was the barber Alex, who came to the U.S. about 40 years ago from Belarus at age 22 with his degree in civil engineering. He quickly found that he enjoyed cutting hair and interacting with clients more than engineering.  He knows his craft and my hair looks very much like it did at the start of my hike. My beard has been tamed again. He even shaved beneath it with a Sweeney Todd cutthroat razor. Like most barbers, Alex holds strong opinions on almost everything, especially on the culinary and medicinal properties of various mushrooms and credits one mushroom in particular for protecting him from Covid. He and his wife walk the Trail often, usually foraging mushrooms. 
Smelling like a fresh haircut, I walked down to Sapporo’s, owned by a Korean and offering Korean and Japanese cuisines. In spite of glowing recommendations from both Amanda and Alex, I didn’t have high expectations. I was wrong. The sushi and sashimi combo came with miso soup, a bit more flavorful than the usual, and a spring greens salad with spicy ginger dressing. Then came the photographed platter. Even the California roll in the center was flavorful and well balanced in textures. The fish was really fresh.
I didn’t expect to be hungry this evening after that lunch, but I am. Maybe it’s just the thought of resuming my hike tomorrow. I thought about all the food I’ve eaten in Waynesboro. Which restaurant would I most like to return to?  If I lived here, which would I frequent on a regular basis?  So it’s back to Sapporo’s to try their Korean food! On the recommendation of the server I had at lunch, I ordered the Gop-Dol Bi-Bim-Bap, described as “assorted vegetables, beef and egg topped over rice in a hot stone bowl.”  Hot doesn’t begin to describe it. Think Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace of Nebuchadnezzar!  In spite of near continuous stirring initially, some of the rice crisped, adding a textural element. The dish is enhanced by a little Gochujang, Korean red chili paste. This is comfort food on a global scale.
I’ll leave Waynesboro with many good food memories, a collection of bandages, and another eight days of antibiotics.","Waynesboro

About half way up at the side trail to Tumbling Run Shelters I met Luna, a flip flop thru-hiker who started from the Flip Flop Kickoff last Sunday.  She’s faster than I am but takes more breaks. Luna has a friend who is friends with the maintainer for this section, Phase II, and he joined us up the remainder of the hill to the viewpoint at Chimney Rock, a jumble of rocks offering a great view to the east, and then to a gas pipeline marking the end of his maintenance section. It was nice to have a guided tour. Luna moved ahead but I caught up at the side trail to Rocky Mountain Shelters where we took an early lunch break. Luna was out of water so I shared mine since I had plenty. Emily from Australia came along. She started in Harpers Ferry and hopes to reach Katahdin if time permits. Then along came Wildflower!  I met Wildflower at Gravel Springs Hut in Shenandoah National Park when, in a daze, I walked right by the shelter trail. She saved me from walking goodness knows how far!  It turns out that she also has a bad foot, a possible stress fracture, and took two days off in Waynesboro while I was there, but we never crossed paths. She stayed at Amberson House, taking the room that otherwise would have been mine. And finally The Calvinator, came by, another flip flopper. He was given his name by his study group at his Presbyterian church and is quite conservative. Luna is meeting her husband at Caledonia State Park today and Emily, Wildflower and The Calvinator are all tenting there. I continued for another two miles, including a steep 500’ climb, to Quarry Gap Shelter, meeting Rerun along the way. He started in Georgia in 2020 and is doing annual long section hikes. He started today and will go to Delaware Water Gap, shelter hopping at first until he regains his legs. 
Quarry Gap Shelters had been lovingly maintained by Jim Stauch “Innkeeper” for many years. It’s a double shelter, each holding four people, with a cooking area in between, all under a metal roof, complete with a cupola. Baskets of petunias hang from the eaves and gnomes and stone animals hide in the foliage. There used to be solar lamps lining the paths to the spring and the privy, but the club felt that wasn’t in keeping with the primitive ethic. Don and another guy have come in. Don is sharing the shelter with me. The second shelter is closed because the floor was just painted. 
What about my toe?  Nary a complaint today. I can’t begin to describe how wonderful it was to walk without pain. I’ve changed the bandage as I was instructed to do daily until it heals up.  Today there were stretches where the trail followed the ridge which is a jumble of large rocks, taking concentration and time. Otherwise, the trail was kind. I passed one circular burn scar about 15’ in diameter, the site of a charcoal rick for the iron furnaces that dominated this area in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Dan got in about 1/2 hour before me. At first I didn’t recognize him because he was clean. Magilla Gorilla and Broomhilda are here, only Broomhilda is now Hot Foot and is recovering from a spill of hot water on her ankle. A woman I didn’t know, Ultra, recognized my trail name. I hiked with her husband Jedi last year!  She texted her husband who sent back a photo of the two of us. New to me is Radiator, another older guy, and Chip who is very quiet. And then One Hundred Percent, Hun, came in!  It struck me — these are all part of my tramily.  It’s free flowing and anything but formal. Ultra is an ultra marathoner, so I probably won’t see her again.  There are dorms downstairs and upstairs. Following the example of Ness last year, I chose the upstairs dorm. The only other occupants are Ultra and Chip. Hun, bless his heart, is downstairs but I expect to hear his snores through the floor!
The Ironmaster’s Mansion is in Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The lake in the park was the iron ore quarry. I’ve mentioned the charcoal. Lime rock is common and was used as a flux to remove impurities from the molten iron. There would have been a hammer mill driven by water power to breakup the ore and lime rock. When there were sufficient quantities stockpiled, the ironmaster would schedule a burn that would continue until one of the ingredients was exhausted. Water power would drive the furnace bellows. At the proper time, the furnace would be tapped and the molten iron run out through channels, resembling piglets suckling on a sow, hence the name pig iron. The pig iron would be further purified and cast into objects at forges, like the one that used to be at Old Forge Park. Until the Bessemer process was developed to make use of the abundant anthracite coal found in Pennsylvania in the counties lining the AT trail north of Port Clinton, southeast Pennsylvania was the center of the iron industry in the United States, with additional furnaces and forges found in New York State and Massachusetts. The AT north of the Potomac River travels through the industrial history of this country, although most hikers are ignorant of it. 
I’ve decided to sit out the rain tomorrow. There will still be rain through the weekend for me to enjoy. The iron plantation’s grist mill is now the Appalachian Trail Museum.  Unfortunately, it won’t be open tomorrow, but the general store will be. Today I passed by a monument marking the midpoint of the trail. There’s a tradition for Georgia to Maine thru hikers to mark the occasion by attempting to eat a half gallon of ice cream at the store. My midpoint won’t be until slightly before Monson, Maine. Nonetheless, I may attempt a Dixie cup of ice cream tomorrow. 
My body, including my feet, tolerated today’s distance well. I’m a little sore and ready for a good night’s sleep. I’m not intending to do such miles regularly. Brother Ass is too old for that!","Quarry Gap Shelters

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662863,"I slept well in the upstairs dorm. Two guys came in after 8:00 but I never heard them. I didn’t even need earplugs last night. 
The innkeeper, made pancakes at 7:00 and had various pastries available. I invited her to join me for lunch at the general store that opens for the season today. I think she appreciated being included, and I know I enjoyed her company and learning more about her.  She was the innkeeper when I was here last year and I barely got to know her at all.  We both had California burgers (meaning a burger with avocado served on ciabatta) and hand cut fries. Because of the rain, we carried our burgers back to the hostel to eat. The food at the General Store is very good and reasonably priced.  They also carry enough food for short-term resupply, like Ramen noodles and Knorr pasta and rice bags.
Hikers have been coming in all day to get out of the rain so it looks like a full house tonight. I’ll go back over to the store later and try to find something lighter for dinner, along with a single scoop of ice cream, my token nod to the midpoint celebration. 
The rain will be showers tomorrow morning and only cloudy in the afternoon. I’ll start hiking after breakfast and go 15+ miles to Alec Kennedy Shelter, four miles from Boiling Springs. Sunday looks like another rain day, so I’ve made a reservation at Cardinal Bed & Breakfast. Dan has done the same. They will pick us up in Boiling Springs Sunday afternoon, giving us time for brunch, to visit the outfitter and convenience store and to have a carry out dinner prepared. I stayed at Cardinal last year. While the rooms are very nice indeed with luxurious bathrooms and the breakfast more than I can eat, the hosts Bill and Joanne are fond of relating their life story. A lot of active listening is called for!
I’m going to explore the mansion now and read more about its history.  There is some debate about the role of the Ironmaster's Mansion in the Underground Railroad under various ironmasters, one of whom was the largest slaveholder in the county.  But even then it is thought that enslaved folk running for freedom may have been sheltered among the free blacks and in some of the more remote buildings.  Dinner tonight was another visit to the General Store for a chicken fajita wrap.  I intended to save half for tomorrow, but inspired by Hun's success at the half-gallon ice cream challenge, I ate it all.  I passed on buying any ice cream.","Ironmaster’s Mansion Hostel

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662902,"At breakfast this morning, we learned that Hun received an urgent message from home, an illness in his family. He will shuttle into Carlisle, rent a car, and drive home to Wisconsin. I hope he returns to the Trail!  I was touched that he enveloped me in a giant bear hug to say goodbye. We’ve shared a lot that isn’t in my journal, and I’ll miss him. Only rarely have I met anyone with his strength of will!  Don, who I have been calling Dan, and I left after breakfast, about 8:00. The trail wanders through the picnic area of the park and by the lake that was the iron ore quarry. It gradually gains elevation, following an old iron industry road. In fact the first eight miles today followed old roads and as we approached PA 34, we hiked on an old rail bed. It was easy hiking and we made 2-1/2 MPH including breaks and lunch. There was slight mist at times, enough for Don to put his pack cover on and to rig his hiking umbrella to his pack. I was comfortable in just shorts and t-shirt. 
There’s a general store and grill just 0.2 miles down PA 34, but we both have an abundance of food so didn’t bother with it. After crossing the road, the trail steeply ascends Whisky Spring Rocks and at the top celebrates the giant black boulders by wandering over, alongside and between them. At one point, I had to take off my pack and lift it onto a high ledge and then join it. My legs are just too short to do it gracefully. Some of the steep descents tested the limit of the flexion of my knee replacements, slowing me down. We reached a stream about 0.1 before the side trail to the shelter and filled our reservoirs there. There is access to the stream from the shelter, but it’s steeply downhill. We met a local high school teacher there who is out for a section hike. Goodwill teaches interior design and culinary arts and carries healthy snacks for other hikers. Don took an apple and I got a banana!  
The shelter will hold 8 and there’s room for at least half a dozen tents. We got here at 3:15 and are still alone at 5:00. Several people from the hostel should make it in before dark.  It is forecast to start raining around midnight and up to 2” is expected tomorrow.  Fortunately, we are finished with the bad rocks and have just one up, White Rocks, and a total of four miles to Boiling Springs, much of it pasture walking. We should arrive in time for brunch and to pick up what we need to get to Duncannon, just one overnight. I don’t think I need anything. We are both looking forward to sitting out the rain at Red Cardinal Bed & Breakfast.  The weather starting Monday looks much better!","Ironmaster’s Mansion Hostel

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662928,"Two more hikers, Sea Dog and The Calvinator came in about 6:00 but first Juliette from Boiling Springs stopped by on her walk. Juliette is originally from Jamaica and talked nonstop in her delightful sing-song voice about this that and the other thing without pause for breathing. It was a monologue not a conversation and lasted over an hour. Topics included the paradise Jamaica used to be before bad government compelled a IMF bailout and the United States became involved in eradication of the marijuana crop and introduced semi-automatic weapons. Now it’s a dangerous place, she says. I was fascinated by not only Juliette’s endless patter but also by her shearling like leggings and fur lined boots that reminded me of Thomas the Faun from Narnia. I was curious to see if Juliette had cloven hooves but thought she might not understand. 
It started to rain sometime during the night with thunderstorms rumbling through. One nearby lightning strike got our attention, waking up all four of us!  It was still raining this morning but should stop later tonight. Don and I were ready to leave at 6:30 but waited out another thunderstorm. The trail today climbed White Rocks, which fortunately is not very rocky, and then descended to pastures surrounding Boiling Springs. Walking through wet pasture is unpleasant. We made excellent time, covering 3.9 miles in 90 minutes, motivated by the thought of breakfast. 
We had a warm welcome at Café 101 and were even allowed to bring our wet packs inside. I enjoyed orange juice, a Greek omelette, home fries and rye bread toast. I couldn’t finish the home fries. TCO outfitters is predominantly geared toward fly fisherfolk but has enough backpacker supplies to replace or upgrade failing gear, including an extensive shoe department with top brands, and Alpine Aire freeze-dried food. The Food Mart is sufficient for short-term resupply. I have more than enough food to get to Duncannon and bought only a couple of Clif Bars. We waited for Bill from Red Cardinal B&B at a covered table outside of Café 101. Three women who were at the Ironmaster’s Mansion with us came in. Yesterday they hiked from the Mansion to the road crossing after the nasty rocks, before the shelter. The Quality Inn near Carlisle, just down from the trail crossing of U.S. 30, now offers pickup service and shuttled them back there this morning. They hiked the six miles to Boiling Springs this morning and will hike another eight up the Cumbersome Valley this afternoon to the Quality Inn.  I would have hiked there today but I chose to stay at the B&B instead, to be kind to Brother Ass. 
We bought takeout dinners at Café 101 and Bill, one of the hosts, picked us up at 12:15. While waiting, I ate a single scoop of chocolate chip ice cream. Bill and his wife Joanne are considerate hosts. The house dates to the 1850’s but has been added onto several times. They have sensible rules, like packs remaining in the garage. The two rooms are warmly appointed with private baths. I’m sitting here now in a plush bathrobe sipping hot chocolate and nibbling on one of Joanne’s brownies. I’ll heat up the Southwestern chicken and black bean wrap for dinner.  
Bill will return us to Boiling Springs after breakfast tomorrow. We’ll walk the 14 miles up to Darlington Shelter and be in Duncannon on the Susquehanna River on Tuesday. I’ve reserved a room at the Doyle Hotel. Beyond that, I have no definite plans. I need to see how Brother Ass handles the rocky trail this year. This is where I was defeated last year.  At the moment, I’m feeling good. My legs and knees are pain free. My blisters are fully healed. My left big toe looks much better and probably won’t need to be bandaged after Duncannon. So I’m hopeful that this year will be different, but also a little fearful that it won’t.","Alex Kennedy Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663003,"I noticed an error in yesterday’s entry that I’m not going to correct because it might be an apt description. I referred to the Cumberland Valley as the Cumbersome Valley. That’s the way it felt today. The walk through Boiling Springs and up the center of the valley through a very narrow right-of-way, surrounded by farms sodden from yesterday’s rain, was nearly level, until the last mile rising 750’ to Darlington Shelter. There are frequent road crossings including both the east-west and the north-south Pennsylvania Turnpike. Road noise was near constant, punctuated by train whistles. My shoes were still wet from yesterday and stayed wet from the puddled trail. Plus it’s a case of water water everywhere but not a drop to drink. ATC owns a small property midway up the valley, Scott Farm, that it used to store equipment and as a staging area for trail maintenance. Several years ago the well was found to be contaminated and so is no longer available to thirsty hikers. There’s still a Port-a-Potty available.   So from a hiker’s perspective, perhaps Cumbersome Valley is not altogether wrong. 
I really enjoyed Red Cardinal B&B. Billy and Joanne treated us like guests, even honored guests, and did everything possible to make us feel at home. Breakfast this morning was truly farm-to-table featuring eggs from their hens and spinach from their garden, along with home fries and toast, served after fresh berries with crème fraîche. When we could eat no more, Billy brought out two slices of Joanne’s blueberry pound cakes and a Hershey nugget for each of us. We ate it all, but didn’t stop for lunch today. 
Billy dropped us off in Boiling Springs at 8:00 and we were at the shelter before 2:00. We put our raincoats on for about 15 minutes but more rain is expected tonight and tomorrow. The water source here is about 0.3 miles downhill from the shelter, an intermittent spring running well with the recent rain. At the bottom of the hill coming up to the shelter is a sign warning hikers that the shelter spring may be dry. The thought of carrying water up that hill led us to take a chance and we were rewarded. 
A gentleman from Luxembourg and his girl friend were here when we got here but hiked on while we fetched our water. He is being sponsored by various corporations to hike The Triple Crown as a fundraiser for a particular childhood disease in Luxembourg. 
This is a nice shelter that would sleep eight people. So far there’s Don, me, and a southbound section hiker named Andy who is quiet but pleasant, from the Lancaster area. 
The weather continues unusually chilly for this time of year with a forecast low of 41* tonight. It’s the end of my first month of hiking. Had I known how cold it was going to be, I would have started with my 20* sleeping bag instead of my 35* one. Otherwise, I’m happy with all my gear choices. I’ve dealt with shoe failure, blisters and an infected toe and find myself one day behind my fictitious schedule and have hiked 276 miles. I’m satisfied.","Boiling Springs (Red Cardinal B&B)

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663082,"“The Girls” rolled in about 5:00 last night. Enuf who teaches shooting in coastal North Carolina appears to be the ringleader, deciding how far they hike and where they stay. White Bird raises goats and makes cheese in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Emily who I thought was from Australia is from New Zealand and is younger and stronger. She could be hiking longer distances but seems to delight in the company of Enuf and White Bird. I like all three and hope to get to know them better. 
I needed my earplugs last night. Don was snoring quite vociferously. It was about 40* and again I was wishing for my warmer sleeping bag. Also, I wish that when I bought my Exped sleeping pad that I had gotten one with greater insulation value!  Mine is really a summer pad and it hasn’t felt like summer. 
Don and I left about 7:20 in light rain but it didn’t take long before we had to stop to strip off layers. It’s a choice between getting wet from rain or sweat. The trail was rocky in places and I was inattentive and fell. No damage done but my knee is a bit abraded. The descent into Duncannon on the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers is extremely steep and a little slippery when wet, with lots of uneven stone steps. My knees did not approve, but while tired by the end, performed a little slowly but alright. It’s another reminder to me to focus on the trail and not my usual random thoughts. 
We got into town at noon. The Doyle was closed for maintenance. Sorrentos is closed on Tuesdays. So we both had 1/2 pound burgers at The Pub along with French fries. Ugh! After lunch, I was able to register for my room at the Doyle. For those who remember this place, let me say that first, the electrical system has been redone — no more bare buzzing wires and lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling. I took a room with private bath. It’s immaculate, with air conditioning and a wall-mounted TV.  The mattress feels new!  I stayed here for nostalgia’s sake. Don is staying in the bunkhouse in the back of the outfitters. We met after showering and shared a load of laundry at the nearby laundromat. We were short a quarter and a rather large gentlemen dressed in ancient Goth insisted on giving us one. Spike Venom now deals in antiques and curios but was a professional wrestler!  I was particularly taken by his hat band featuring more skulls than Kali’s necklace. Welcome to Duncannon!
Between the outfitter and the Mini-Mart we were able to reprovision without arranging a shuttle to the grocery outside of town. I had to buy single packages of Aleve to refill my bottle. 
The Girls got into town about 3:00 and we will meet for dinner at the Pub at 5:30. 
The next four or five days will be challenging for me, not only because of the infamous rocks of PA, but because it’s where I had to quit last year.  It seems selfish to pray for my knees but that’s what I’m doing!","Darlington Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663140,"Dinner at the Pub was fun, with the three Girls, Don and me, and a section hiker Tracker from Birmingham, Alabama who started his serial hike in Georgia in 2021. He’s starting at Duncannon this year and heading north probably to somewhere in Massachusetts. He’s 65 and retired and seems in excellent shape. Starting a hike with the rocks of PA is a gutsy move!  We sat boy, girl, boy on one side and girl, boy, girl on the other. Aren’t we proper?  I had their famous crab cake, salad and coleslaw. The salad with bleu cheese dressing was very good. 
Don, Tracker and I had breakfast at Goodies across the street from the Doyle at 7:00. The eggs in my eggs, cheese and sausage sandwich on whole wheat toast were perfectly tender and gave me good energy for the morning. Today’s hike started with a walk down Duncannon’s High Street.  The homes and most businesses, with the exception of the churches and funeral home, suffer from neglect. I see no sign that Duncannon is experiencing a revitalization. We crossed the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers on highway bridges, crossed three train tracks, and climbed 1,000’ up Peters Mountain on very good trail with switchbacks. We started in very light rain and stopped once to take our rain jackets off. Shortly after attaining the ridge, the trail devolved into bouldering requiring a few moves that were near technical. That behind us, the trail was nice, only occasionally rocky. We stopped for lunch after the pedestrian overpass over Peters Mountain Road that features hairpin curves on both sides. It was a treacherous crossing and I was nearby hit there in 1998. Scout caught up to us there and we walked the remaining three miles to the shelter together. Shortly after lunch, we were pelted by BB-sized hail for about 20 minutes. So now I’ve had snow and graupel in Shenandoah National Park, an abundance of rain, and hail today. Bring on the hellfire. Speaking of which, part of the trail this morning passed through the charred landscape of a recent fire that smelled very recent.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663271,"The Girls came rolling in about 4:00 in good spirits as always, but tired. It was one of the few times after making camp that I didn’t clean myself using half of a bandana and a cup of water. It just seemed too cold for that!  I was in my sleeping bag at 5:30, wearing my long underwear bottoms and shorts; t-shirt, long-sleeved zipper t-shirt and hoody; and fleece hat and gloves. I read until my arms grew tired. I missed two gentlemen coming in late and deciding to tent. 
Don and I left at 6:45 wearing shorts and several top layers. Don led on the three mile level and down to PA 325, Clark Valley Road. Willow from my 2018 tramily texted me that Higher Ground might be there feeding hikers, but alas he was not. This is where I got off the trail last year, so passing it was a victory of sorts!
I led on the 1,000’ uphill after the road crossing.  We met a southbound hiker my age named Spot. He lives near Port Clinton and is hiking to Georgia and back. He has completed the AT eight times!  We stopped for lunch at the intersection of the Horseshoe Trail. Tracker caught up to us there and we walked the remaining miles to the shelter. The treadway was rocky at times even though it was usually an old road. We entered the coal mining region today. One stream was flowing bright orange from a poorly sealed mine. We didn’t stop for enough breaks today and I was quite tired after the 18 miles. 
Emily from the Girls came in about an hour after us.  Enuf and White Bird eventually did too. Emily told us that we left too early this morning. Higher Ground was just setting up when she got to the road crossing. She had a shrimp and veggie stir fry!  And apparently he was set up at the crossing of Peters Mountain Road yesterday, after Don and I crossed. At another road crossing, Emily was invited to join a picnic. Meanwhile Don, Tracker and I had none. So sad!

",Rausch Gap Shelter,"May 04, Thu",18
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663307,"I’m starting this entry while in a trauma bay in the Emergency Room of Hershey Medical Center.  I’ll get to that.  
The day started with Enuf announcing that she had had enough. A medical condition she has recurred and walking is just too painful. White Bird who had come with Enuf to the trail will leave the trail also. They will walk several miles to a parking area and arrange a shuttle.  We were all saddened.  
Don and I left Rausch Gap Shelter about 7:00. I slept soundly last night and was feeling good.  Don left it up to me, and I opted to take the bypass around the beaver dam rather than risk a morning dunk. When we came back to the AT, we took a wrong turn. It was such a lovely path that we should have known better. We lost a mile and came up behind Emily. A short time later, the three of us caught Tracker who was filtering water. 
The trail alternated between nice old roads, some with scattered anthracite coal attesting to the roads’ former use, and rocky trail, sometimes with large rocks and other times with small rocks. Nonetheless we made good time.  Highway 501 and the 501 shelter were in sight when I tripped on a root. Or so Don tells me inasmuch as he was following me. I did a face plant and passed out briefly. I came to with Don, Emily and Tracker standing over me. I didn’t know what had happened or even the names of my friends. One of them applied a bandage to my forehead but that was far too little. My right face was swollen and my lip split on both the inside and outside. I stood up and walked bleeding the remaining 25 feet or so to Highway 501 which was the end of the day’s hike.  Even though I couldn’t see myself, just from my memory lapse I knew I needed medical attention. 
I think it was Don who spoke to a dayhiker in the parking area. Blessed Saint Bill, angel par excellence, is a retired nurse and agreed to take me to an Urgent Care in Lebanon, PA, affiliated with Lancaster Hospital. They took me right in, decided that I needed CT-scans to check for any brain bleeds or broken cranial or facial bones and referred me to Milton Hershey Healthcare. Bill waited the entire time and when the clinic decided I was stable enough to transfer by private vehicle, Bill drove me to the ER in Hershey. The whole time I was in a daze but my memory slowly restored, except for the fall itself. 
The Hershey ER is a Level One Trauma Center and they immediately took me into Triage to see if I fit their criteria for trauma care. I hadn’t seen myself up until now, but talked a nurse into taking me to a rest room.  She insisted on pushing me in a wheelchair.  I nearly didn’t recognize myself beneath the swelling and blood. Then they called a trauma and I was transferred to a trauma bay and surrounded by medical personnel who removed my smelly clothes and checked me thoroughly for injuries other than my head and hooked me up to a monitor. They ordered CT scans of my cranium, face and mandibles after which they would stitch me up. The ER was busy so there was a wait. I amused myself by setting off blinking lights and beeps on the monitor by controlling my breathing (less than 8 breathes per minute did the trick) and to some extent by manipulating my blood pressure. My memory was returning and I knew it was Cinco de Mayo, although at first I couldn’t recall the year.  Bill waited the entire time. I asked for him to come back and suggested that he leave. I was in good hands and the wait looked to be long. What a wonderful person and I’ll be indebted to him for a long time. 
Finally I was taken for my CT scans and fortunately nothing was amiss. Then two doctors worked together to place sutures it forehead and upper right lip and, using dissolvable sutures on the inside. The Lidocaine injection was effective. They were impressed that I knew the names of the nerves they were blocking.  They offered me some instant Mac & Cheese (I hadn’t eaten since about 1:30) and allowed me to get dressed. I put on my least smelly clothes and was released about midnight. 
The lacerations need to be kept clean for two weeks, something that is impossible on the trail, and the exterior sutures removed in five days. Plus if I have any signs of concussion, I need to seek out medical care again. They called me a cab and I went to an airport hotel in Harrisburg. I wasn’t supposed to shower for 24 hours, but there was no way to fly home covered in trail filth and stench, so I did the best I could to keep the sutures dry. 
I booked a flight home this morning, which is certainly cheaper than spending two weeks in a hotel. I’ll see my doctor in Burlington, who thru-hiked, and discuss returning to the trail. I was cautioned however that I should avoid the sun for the next six months to minimize facial scarring. Plus, I need to discuss the frequency of my falls and near falls, in spite of various balance exercises. 
The irony is that even after successive days of 18 and 17 miles on rocky trail, my legs and knees feel great this morning. So what limited me in previous years has been solved. Now it’s something new. 
I’ll let you know how I’m doing and what I decide in a few days. Meanwhile I’m filled with gratitude for my trail friends Don, Emily and Tracker who saw me through this, especially for Bill for spending hours seeing to my welfare, and for the compassionate doctors and nurses who comforted me and put me back together last night.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663483,"I left you hanging in my last entry, so let me bring you up-to-date. 
I slept miserably at the Fairfield Inn at the Harrisburg Airport.  It wasn’t the fault of the hotel at all.  The room was very nice and the bed marvelously comfortable compared to anything in the past five weeks.  By the time I showered, it was about 1:30 in the morning.   I wedged myself in bed using the many pillows so I would stay on my back and avoid bleeding on the nice linens.  I set the alarm for 6:00 but tired of the thoughts racing through my addled brain, got up at 5:00 and walked down to the guest laundry in my cleaner shorts and rain jacket — I wanted to wash my rain pants to use as travel pants.  While the clothes was in the washer, I started organizing my pack for checking it, including disassembling my hiking poles so they would fit inside my pack and sorting through my leftover food, discarding any open items that while perfectly edible on the trail might be questionable in other circumstances.  All electronics and things with batteries went into my day pack, along with a few snack bars and a bag of M&Ms.  I completed my packing as my clothes dried and walked down to the complementary breakfast, which was more than adequate, including fresh scrambled eggs, sausage, a wide variety of breads and pastries, and fresh fruit.  I was ravenous, but quickly grew frustrated with having to cut up everything into small pieces to get it past my swollen lips.  I sat in a corner facing away from people.  My right face had matured into mottled mess of purples and blacks from the angry reds of the previous evening.  The swelling around my right eye severely limited my vision.  I returned to my room and did a half-assed job of brushing my teeth while avoiding my upper lip.  I checked out and walked over to the airport, allowing plenty of time for long lines, of which there were none.
I had one piece of good luck with American Airlines when I booked my ticket.  First class was only $60 more than economy and included free checked luggage, meaning that it cost me only $30 more.  It was well worth it for the more comfortable seat and additional leg room, and on the small planes used to Philadelphia and then to Burlington, it meant I could book the single seat on the left side of the aisle and avoid conversations that invariably began with, “So what does the other guy look like?”  I had a brief moment of panic when the TSA agent compared my driver’s license photo to my face, but I held his gaze with my one good eye and he allowed me to pass.  The flight time to Philadelphia from Harrisburg is only 16 minutes, so I didn’t benefit from my first class status.  The American terminal in Philadelphia consists of three spokes radiating from a central food hub and is very easy to navigate.  I sloppily ate a chicken quesadilla from QDOBA, trying to minimize moving my upper lip.  After washing my face, I felt much more content.  The flight to Burlington boarded early, starting with first class, so I had the pleasure of being on display to most of the passengers.  One little boy about three years old stopped by me, stared, and said to his father, “Oooooo, ouchy!”  At least he was merely curious and not afraid.  Two gin and tonics later, we landed in Burlington about 20 minutes early.  Tom was waiting in baggage claim and for once in my life, my pack was the first bag off the plane.  We managed to get into our condo unit without seeing any neighbors, and I haven’t gone out since.  As always when I return from a trip, I am awed by the view from our living room, overlooking the City of Burlington, Lake Champlain, and into the High Peaks of the Adirondacks.  No wonder I seldom walked out to a viewpoint on my hike.  Tom served chicken pot pies for dinner, our ultimate comfort food.  
It’s now been four days since my little tumble.  The swelling and discoloration is diminishing.  I can see out of my right eye again.  The sutures will be removed in two days.  Friends are wanting to get together, but I’m putting them off at least until then.  I am NOT ready for my close up yet, Mr. DeMille.  
If I return to my thru-hike, I’ve decided to skip ahead to the Hudson River and start from Fort Montgomery, New York, on relatively gentle treadway.  After summiting Katahdin, I would return to Pennsylvania, hike the skipped 214 miles, and then complete my flip-flop from Rockfish Gap south to Springer Mountain.  If is the operative word.  I just don’t know at this point.  Talking with the doctor on Thursday may give me some insight.  The release notes from Hershey Medical Center advise avoiding the sun for the next six months to minimize scarring.  I’m not concerned about my lip; that’s what mustaches are for.  But I really would prefer not having a scar on my right forehead, even if it is more linear than lightning-bolt shaped.  I wouldn’t want to be known as The Hiker Who Lived.  And then there is the matter of my increasing clumsiness in the last few years.  What is causing it?  My balance is good, or as often as I trip over things, I would have fallen far more frequently.  One suggestion is that it relates to the cataracts that have started to impair my vision.  It’s hard to avoid obstacles if I can’t see them clearly.  A consultation with my ophthalmologist may be in order.  There is risk associated with any sport, and indeed, with sitting in a recliner doing absolutely nothing, but I would be irresponsible to ignore the reality of my increasing falls and rely upon soft landings to avoid more serious injury.  As much as I would like to complete a thru-hike, I would like more to live to talk about it.  This fall scared me, and it easily could have turned out worse than it has.  
I’m grateful for the support of my friends and for the kind messages left in my guest book.  I’ll let you know what I decide.","Burlington, Vermont

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663636,"I went to the doctor yesterday to have the sutures removed.  Tom drove me because I didn’t feel comfortable driving myself.  I now have an official name for what resulted from my fall a week ago.  It’s concussion, second stage, or if you prefer, traumatic brain injury.   While the outward signs like swelling and bruising are improving from day-to-day, I am still having to deal with ongoing problems with my memory and cognitive abilities.  For example, yesterday I was unable to retrieve the word concussion.  Only contusion would come out, or appropriately, confusion. While I’m capable of reading and understanding anything, a task like making a menu for the week and a grocery list is too much.  For an inveterate planner, being deprived of my ability to plan is very frustrating.  That includes planning for if or when I can continue my hike.  Fortunately, my ability to obsess on the future also seems suspended.  Living in the Now has certain advantages.  
Especially in older people, such symptoms can persist for weeks or even longer.  The doctor gave me permission to start walking at a moderate speed for 1/2 hour per day and to increase the daily time by 1/2 hour each week, if I tolerate it.  I’m also going to try some light stretching and, if possible, balance exercises.  No weight lifting at present.  The doctor who removed my stitches scolded me for the distances I was hiking “at my age” and for my poor nutrition on the trail, as evidenced by my rapid weight loss.  He is neither a hiker nor my regular physician and I’m tempted to ignore him, except that the symptoms I’m dealing with are not so easily disregarded.  Everything I’ve read online emphasizes the importance of a gradual return to normal activities and the lack of any effective treatment for concussion .  The potential consequences of trying to bull my way through this are too great.  So I will follow his protocol and in a few weeks, check with my regular physician who is a gerontologist and a former thru-hiker.  For now, I am delighting in certain elements of being home again, such as my husband Tom, indoor plumbing, Charmin Ultra Soft toilet paper, and cotton clothes.  The tulips are in full bloom here.  I’m glad not to have missed springtime. 
I’ll post again when I’ve made a decision about returning to the trail, but we kind of know where this is heading, don’t we?  I’m just not ready or able to admit it yet.","Burlington, Vermont

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663866,"The brain fog has lifted!  I woke up on Sunday without feeling like my brain was buried deep in the ground.  I could think again and the mental acuity persisted through a hour’s walk Sunday, yesterday and today.  I wish I could describe to you what a concussed brain feels like.  The closest I can come is what it feels like to wake up from general anesthesia, if you’ve ever experienced that.  So I’ve contacted my primary care physician and I have her grudging permission to return to the trail, with conditions.  
First, I can’t return for a least one more week and preferably longer.  I had already decided that if I got to return, I would start from the Hudson River and save the rest of PA, NJ and NY west of the Hudson for later.  Graduation ceremonies at the Military Academy at West Point, which is just north of Fort Montgomery, are next week, so hotels are fully booked.  It’s like a military-industrial conspiracy to get me to behave.  So I have reserved a seat on Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express from Burlington to Poughkeepsie, New York on Monday, May 29.  I will shuttle from there to Fort Montgomery (thank you, Christine!), and stay at the Holiday Inn Express using points I’ve accumulated over the past several years.  I’ll start hiking on Tuesday morning.
Second, I must greatly reduce my daily mileage initially.  Dr. M insists that even though I might feel back to 100%, my brain is probably still healing, and that’s an energy intensive process.  She cautions me to “pay close attention to [my] body, take breaks when tired and, don’t overdo it!”  “You need to start low and go slow,” she writes.  “Your risk of serious injury will be that much greater if you take shortcuts with your brain health.”  
Message received!  Doing low mileage days will be very difficult for me, especially if I meet people I would like to be hiking with.  I’ve been given a second chance, and I mustn’t blow it! I will try to practice gratitude for the things I can do and not begrudge the things that I can’t or shouldn’t do.  (I must have really hit my head hard if I’m saying this.)  At least I won’t have to carry very much food.  I count at least five delis or opportunities to order pizza in the first six days!","Burlington, Vermont

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664218,"Having an accident and coming home for a little while to recuperate seems to have opened the floodgate to well-intended commentary from friends and strangers alike.  They have ranged from earnest advice like “Your health comes first; the Trail will still be there waiting for you” to an enigmatic guest book entry “Do what makes you feel good internally not what makes you feel good externally.”  Is this a Zen Koan designed for me to see my feelings as external to myself?  Spooky stuff.  I’ve had my share of comments like, “I told you that the woods are a dangerous place and bad things happen there” and “How can you even think about going back?”  And of course there have been equine references, about getting back on the horse that threw me.  Then there are the ones that sow doubt, “Isn’t a second concussion more serious than the first, especially in the elderly?”  Like I haven’t thought about this?  And even fashion suggestions, such as adding a helmet to my kit.  Most rewarding have been hearing from old friends like Mountain Laurel, Day Maker, and FussyMary and people I hiked with or met this year like Curious George, Dan, Kidding and Luna and from strangers who have been reading my journal this year and in past years who are missing their daily fix of Sugarfoot.  
Thank you all for your well wishes and prayers and, in one case, the promise of trail magic in New York or Connecticut.   I am feeling very blessed.  There’s still a little facial swelling and discoloration under my eyes, but I’m feeling strong again.  My walking speed with just a daypack is back to four miles an hour and walking up the hill from the lake is effortless.  For my spring allergies to tree pollen, particularly oaks, I’ve switched to Allegra from Flonase after reading that a common side effect of Flonase is dizziness.  Could it have contributed to my klutziness on the trail last year and this year?  I don’t know, but my eyes are not itching nearly as much on Allegra.  
The only chores remaining before I return to the trail in a week are buying a few food items, weaning myself from coffee again, charging electronics, and visiting my “hair artist” Nathan next Saturday.  I’ve made a few minor tweaks to my gear.  I’m leaving my gloves and rain mitts home until I get to New Hampshire but I’ve added a second Montbell t-shirt and my AirPods.  With the short days I’m planning to hike initially, I’ll need a little distraction in camp    At the suggestion of Mountain Laurel (Laurie), I’ve also downloaded two nature apps to my iPhone to help fill time.  Merlin Bird ID identifies birds by their calls. Picture This identifies plants from a close-up photo.  Take a photo of the flower or plant and in a few seconds, the app returns the identification and field notes.   I was trained in the laborious use of dichotomous taxonomic keys so this app feels like witchcraft to me, like when handheld calculators replaced slide rules.  I like it a lot!   
If you recall, the soles of the Altra Olympus 5 trail running shoes I started with delaminated in the first week, leading to blisters and an infected toe.  I had Tom mail me a second pair from a later production run in Harpers Ferry.  They have performed perfectly and will probably get me through Vermont or at least Massachusetts.  Altra issued me full credit under their warranty and I ordered another pair on Wednesday and had them free-of-charge, including shipping, on Friday.  I visited the local REI during their anniversary sale and picked up another set of SuperFeet Trailblazer Comfort insoles at 25% off, plus a gas canister to start my hike.  I also replenished my duct tape that I used to hold the first pair of shoes together until I found some SuperGlue.  Otherwise my gear is unchanged.
Before I left for the trail in early April, I felt very excited and anxious to start.  My feelings are more mixed as I prepare to return.  My trail friends from this year will be ahead of me and with the short days I have planned for the first few weeks, I won’t be catching them.  It is possible, however, that Magilla Gorilla and Hotfoot will have caught up to me.  We will now be doing similar miles.  If I find myself tripping over objects real or imaginary, I know what that means for the rest of my hike.  It will be over.   So that adds an element of doubt.  
I’ll start writing my next entry on the Ethan Allen Express to Poughkeepsie and post it from the Holiday Inn in Fort Montgomery.  Then I hope to post daily again, starting with a series of deli and pizza reviews!","Burlington, VT

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664696,"My last entry on reactions of friends and strangers to my returning to the trail hit a chord with some.  I was very pleased to hear from Hungry Cat. He thru hiked the AT in 2018 and we followed each other on TrailJournals, meeting in person near Unionville, NY. He hiked the Continental Divide Trail last year. You can follow his adventures at https://unfetteredfootsteps.com. 
Then I heard from Girl Scouts Junior Troop 60160 from Arlington, Virginia. I had lunch with them on April 15 in Wilson Gap, just south of Blackburn Trail Center in Northern Virginia. I was so impressed with their unrestrained joyfulness that I realized what I had missed growing up, an open, accepting, supportive community of friends and adults, and reacted with unabashed tears for what they had and I had lacked.  They more or less adopted me and I was thrilled and honored.  When they read that I had, in their words, smashed my face on the ground but was returning to the trail, they were excited and made cards to motivate me. They’ll email them to me as I hike. Here’s the first two!  How can I possibly fail with supporters like these?  Oops, I’ll post them tomorrow because something just happened even more amazing!
Walking down to Union Station this morning was a pleasure. It was warm enough for shorts and a light shirt to be comfortable but not so warm that I sweat.  I’m a little sad leaving home, but I will be back for a few days in early June, from Hanover, New Hampshire. Writing that reminds me that I’ll have to make my AMC hut reservations for the Presidential Range before too long. I’m planning a zero day in Great Barrington, Massachusetts in a couple of weeks.  By then I should have an idea of my schedule and be comfortable committing. 
My timing was perfect. They were starting to board just as I got to the station and the business class coach (half of the café car) was the first one I came to. Yes, it’s a little luxury, costing all of $113 compared to $70 for coach. Business class is sold out today, but for now, I’m the only one!  So it’s concierge service. They greeted me by name and brought me water and coffee at my seat. I love Amtrak!  By the way, the coffee is really good.  I haven’t had any for several days so I’m enjoying it. And there’s a new menu in the café. “My” attendant recommends the chicken bánh mi for lunch. 
I figured out that by getting off in Poughkeepsie and shuttling to Fort Montgomery I’m saving three hours over  going to Moynihan Pavilion at Penn Station, walking to Grand Central Station, taking MetroNorth to Garrison and a taxi to the hotel.  I might have missed dinner if I did all that. 
A Thai family from Bangkok just got on in Middlebury with three children and twelve pieces of luggage.  The oldest one just graduated from Middlebury College and the second one will graduate next year. The youngest will be starting there in the fall. And this you won’t believe!  With permission, I’ll share with you his name, Adul Samon, and why you may recognize it. He was one of the soccer players rescued from a flooded cave in Thailand in 2018, the only one who spoke English, one of his four languages. He served as the liaison between the international rescue team and the trapped boys and their coach. Middlebury, which is known for its language programs, awarded Adul with its inaugural Global Citizen’s Award in 2019. He will be the first honoree to attend the college. Here we are!  I confess to watery eyes yet again. 
The bánh mi wasn’t bad. The vegetables were crisp and the sriracha aioli hot enough to be interesting.  Unfortunately, the baguette suffered from refrigeration. 
We would have arrived in Poughkeepsie on time if not for a stalled train ahead of us. So we arrived a half hour late. Christine, the shuttle driver, was waiting for me and I enjoyed our conversation. I checked in at the Holiday Inn at 5:45 and walked over to the nearby Barnstormer barbecue restaurant. I phoned yesterday to verify that they would be open on Memorial Day, but they were closed. Dinner was a gas station convenience store Cobb salad and a bag of chips. It was adequate but left me looking forward to breakfast tomorrow.","Burlington, VT

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664729,"As always, I sleep miserably the first night away from home. It’s not the bed’s fault or even the pillows.  Even so I was up before 5. Breakfast isn’t served until 6, so I made a cup of coffee in the room and took a shower. I might as well start out clean. I’ll give Holiday Inn full marks for their water pressure. The shower could wash an elephant.  A Holiday Inn breakfast is better than a Quality Inn breakfast, but not an order of magnitude better. In addition to reconstituted or prescrambled eggs, there were premade semi-circles labeled as vegetable omelets, both turkey sausage patties and pork link sausage, a wide variety of breads, cereals and pastries, yogurts, and juices as well as fresh apples and oranges. 
I checked out at 7:00 and walked about 2-1/2 miles south along Route 9W to the Appalachian Trail where the trail exits the Bear Mountain Zoo, the low point of the Appalachian Trail at 121’ above sea level. The trail follows a sidewalk on the Bear Mountain Bridge across the Hudson River and then a short distance north on Highway 9D. At the trailhead kiosk, I took my hiking poles off my pack, adjusted their length and applied Picaridin to my legs. The 700’+ climb up Anthony’s Nose was rocky but not difficult. I took a 15 minute break at Hemlock Springs Campsite but otherwise kept walking at a slow to moderate pace to The Appalachian Market on Highway 9. I had an early lunch of an excellent chicken and cheese quesadilla with onions and peppers and was glad that I only asked for a half order. There were several southbound section hikers at the outside picnic tables and a couple of GA to ME thru hikers who are doing much greater distances than I can at this point. I ordered a turkey sandwich to carry out for dinner. It was just another 0.6 miles to Graymoor, a Franciscan Friary. They make their ball field available to hikers, including potable water, a cold shower, Port-a-Potty, pavilion and picnic tables. Another hiker, Tysam from Leesburg, Virginia, was already here, taking a zero day. He’s 29 but has a health problem that limits his hiking distance and sometimes requires days off. I’m glad for the company. I was here by 1:00. I’ve set up my tent on the soft grass, cleaned myself with a wet bandana (no cold shower for me) and still have lots of time to kibbutz and journal before dinner. My body as well as my brain had no problems with today’s hike, which including the road walk was 9.0 miles. I was very cautious on the rocks and the downhills, perhaps overly so, but it was a good restart to my hike. No one would mistake me for a sure-footed mountain goat, just one of many old goats toddling along.","Fort Montgomery, NY

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664787,"A total of 8 hikers pitched tents or hung hammocks at Graymoor last night. I was asleep at 7:00 and missed meeting some of them. Aside from TySam, my favorites were Spicey and Jen. Jen is from New Brunswick and coaches field hockey at a college in Baltimore.  She passed me while I was taking my mid-morning break today and is going on to the next shelter. I started hiking about 6:30 this morning and got here at 12:30.  TySam got here about 4:30 and I look forward to finding out more of their story.  A GA-ME thru hiker OG is here and also a flip-flopping couple TwistTie and Spreadsheet. 
The trail today was well-maintained but like yesterday, the blazes would benefit from refreshing. I got off trail twice but never for long. I am concerned that I am not being sure-footed like a mountain goat but being a little stumbly. I’m hoping it improves by Kent, CT on Monday. I certainly can’t consider New Hampshire and Maine this way!  
Dennytown Campsite has two lovely group camping sites across the road, but they require reservations. The area assigned to AT hikers is near the road and far from level.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664834,"I slept soundly again, starting on top of my sleeping bag but by morning, I was zipped in it and partially mummied.  I was in no hurry this morning and wanted others to leave first so I wouldn’t be demoralized by their passing me later. They will all be doing greater distances except for TySam. TySam hammocks and has been very cold at night. So they plan to hitch or Uber into Newburgh where there are two outfitters. TySam wants to buy a warm down sleeping bag.  They still hope to make it here today. 
Parts of the hike today was difficult, with rocky treadway and even a rock scramble. There were also sections of lovely trail, like following an old mining cart track that was nearly level. My legs and my brain seemed much more secure today and I never felt in danger of falling. I’m still taking my time with frequent breaks and staying hydrated. That’s becoming more difficult as more and more streams and springs are going dry. There used to be a well and pump at this shelter, but the water failed to meet standards. I stopped at a stream about 1/10th of a mile before the shelter and filtered enough to refill my reservoir for tomorrow and I carried three liters into the shelter for tonight. 
I passed a trail side kiosk today dedicated to the Telephone of the Wind, inviting passersby to reach out to loved ones who are no longer here. I didn’t try it. I wonder if there is an operator in charge of routing the calls. Is there a special toll for calls to Hell?
There’s one GA-ME thru hiker in so far, Normy. He was given the name as a diminutive of normal because his fellow hikers said he lacked anything distinctive. We will combine our orders for pizza tonight!  This shelter is set in a residential neighborhood, screened with plants. The trail app has a suggested fake address to use, but as soon as we gave it, she went, “RPH?”
So we’re covered. Caesar salads and a large pizza with pepperoni, black olives and onion. I can definitely eat half of that, but it’s enough to share if TySam comes in. I’ve started to feel a little protective of them. 
Today went well enough that I’m confident I will make it to Kent, CT on Monday. I phoned the Fife & Drum for a room in their inn and for dinner reservations. They still have the duck prepared table side (think 1950’s) that I enjoyed in 1999 there.","Dennytown Road Tenting Area

Mileshka is a New York City model from Puerto Rico. Go ahead and Google her and see what you think. She often escapes the city on weekends to hike sections of the AT. Mileshka is planning a 2024 GA-ME thru-hike. Judging by her tiny pack, she has already mastered the ultralight game. She will be the focus of shelter life during her hike without having to say a thing. Beauty speaks volumes. 
Segueing from the sublime to the mundane, I’ll tell you about the rest of last night and today.  The pizza and salads were delivered in only 20 minutes and it was almost more food than Normy and I could eat. Each salad would have easily fed three regular people, but we are not regular. I could only manage three of my ginormous pizza slices, but Normy polished off five, plus a half loaf of garlic bread. I only managed a couple of slices of my bread. TySam did not make it to RPH so I didn’t have to feel guilty for not waiting on them to order and for not saving them a slice or two. A hammocker came in later carrying about a pound of sliced organic turkey, far more that she could eat. I was too stuffed. Plus I had already brushed and flossed my teeth. Normy was noble and ate the remaining turkey. Normy is a husky fellow!  He’s already lost 40 pounds and hopes to lose at least 20 more, calling it a reset of his health life. 
I slept well again, as I almost always do outdoors. I dreamed that we were back in Florida and I was having to drive Tom’s car without adjusting the seat. Tom is over 6’2”, after age shrinkage, and I’m 5’6”. Somehow I could reach the accelerator but not the brake pedal, so I was forced to run lights. We ended up at a strip club that Tom had taken a financial interest in and were served by a hag with wrinkled drooping boobs. Welcome to my dreams!  Trust me, Tom would never make such an investment and if he did, it would be an exemplar of excellent taste. Could this have been a pizza dream?
I awoke early and hiked the 5.1 miles to NY 52 by 9:15. I was back to being Mr. Stumbles again and not feeling clear headed. I walked the 1/2 mile down to Mountaintop Deli, which has changed owners for the better since I was last there. I started with the Hangover breakfast sandwich, as pictured, with a chicken cutlet, hash browns, bacon and two eggs, washed down with a Barq’s Root Beer. Normy joined me and inhaling a gigantic cinnamon bun and a bag of chips with a lemonade GatorAde. We each ordered Italian combo sandwiches to carry out for dinner. The guys who own the deli now are very hiker friendly, providing a recharging station, clean bathroom and allowing hikers to eat in the air conditioning. Did I mention that this day started warm and rapidly became hot and humid?  I also carried out two extra liters of water since the streams before Morgan Stewart Shelter were reported as dry. They were. The extra four pounds plus my dinner and a few energy bars that I bought made the 3.9 miles to the shelter unpleasant. 
I got here about 1:00 and set up in the shelter. Rain showers and thunderstorms are forecast for this evening. In fact, at 3:00 now, I can hear thunder. I sacrificed a cup of water for a bandana bath and feel much better now and looking forward to meeting new friends and eating a hearty dinner.","RPH Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664960,"Cap and Kodiak, GA-ME thru hikers, came in for a break and stayed a couple of hours. Cap found a book of trivia left in the shelter, and the two of them amused each other with it. Do I really need to know how many states start with New (four) or the state with the longest coastline (Alaska)?  But I enjoyed watching the two of them bickering like an old married couple and assumed they were married. They are just good trail friends but everyone makes the same assumption. Cap is going off trail for a few days to visit his real girlfriend in New York City. I didn’t catch Kodiak’s plans but it’s hard to imagine them hiking apart. I won’t ever know what Trail Cupid has in store for them!  They left about 5:30 to get to Pawling for Cap to catch MetroNorth. 
No one else came into the shelter. About 6:30 a severe thunderstorm swept through with nearby lightning strikes, winds of about 40 MPH and quarter-inch hail. I moved my sleeping pad and sleeping bag against the rear wall to keep it dry. It passed in about 30 minutes and the temperature blessedly plummeted, for a good night’s sleep. 
There was one fresh blowdown this morning and plenty of smaller limbs. The trail was mostly good and being a cool Saturday I met plenty of day hikers and weekenders. I took two breaks and arrived at the Dover Oak about noon.  The Dover Oak is reputed to be the largest oak tree on the Appalachian Trail. From there it was an easy walk, mostly through pasture and along boardwalk above a marshland to Rt 22. Tony’s Deli is 0.6 miles trail east, meaning northbounders turn right. They have a grassy field between busy RT 22 and the train tracks used by MetroNorth for hiker camping. The cost of $2 includes 24-hour access to a bathroom and use of outdoor electric outlets in front of the store. I have my external battery charging as I write this.
I started with a pastrami melt with Swiss cheese and spicy mustard and will enjoy dinner and breakfast before I leave in the morning, carrying out a sandwich for lunch. 
Physically I felt fine today. The nice cool weather undoubtedly helps, but mentally I’m still feeling the effects of the concussion, as though  my skull were stuffed with gauze or sawdust. Things like trail blazes are just not registering. Three times this morning, I found myself off trail and had to backtrack. The blazing was quite clear. It was just me. It’s becoming obvious to me that my brain needs more rest than the ten hours of sleep it’s getting out here. I’m staying well hydrated and thanks to the abundant NY delis, I’m well fed. I’ll make my decision tomorrow, because if I decide to go home from Kent, I’ll walk across Bull’s Covered Bridge and up US 7 rather than crossing Schaghticoke Mountain.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Tony’s Deli opens an hour late on Sundays, at 5:00. I waited 15 minutes so I wouldn’t appear anxious and ordered a bacon, cheese and egg sandwich on a toasted bagel. Like all their sandwiches, it was generous, at least a quarter of a pound of bacon. I also ordered a ham and cheddar roll to carry out. A black capped chickadee was very friendly as I ate the breakfast sandwich back at my tent site, but I doubt that he found many crumbs. 
I walked the 0.6 mile back up the highway to the trailhead. The first couple of miles were poorly marked pasture walking with far more cow pies than blazes. The trail was badly overgrown in places and I was glad to have applied Picaridin to my legs since it looked like tick heaven. My brain again felt foggy and I had no doubt that I wasn’t ready to backpack yet. Three weeks is just not enough time to overcome a second stage concussion. My even trying is proof enough of my faulty judgement and I kind of wish my doctor had been firmer. I don’t blame her. She said the right things, but I wasn’t processing them. It’s like my seeing blazes but failing to register them. 
My shuttle driver from last Monday, Christine, texted me. She had read my journal entry for yesterday and suggested that if I did decide to road walk into Kent tomorrow, I might find Schaghticoke Road on the west bank of the Housatonic River more scenic and safer than US 7 on the east side.  I made my decision and texted back my thanks and asked if she could shuttle me to a Metro station on Tuesday. She could, but it would have to be Rhinecliff, New York. That works perfectly since the Ethan Allen Express stops there on the way to Burlington. So once again, I avoid having to visit “The City.”  When I had a stronger cellphone signal, I booked my ticket on Amtrak. 
The rest of the hike was routine, including my new norm of mistaking my location. This time, near Hoyt Road, shortly after crossing the pictured temporary bridge over a creek, I was actually on the trail when I realized that I hadn’t seen a blaze in some time. Far Out showed me on a side trail, so I backtracked 0.4 miles until I met a northbound thru hiker from Germany who assured me that we were indeed on the trail. Once he was sure that I was properly oriented, he sped off, and I continued my slow trudge. The trail and blazing improved immensely at the NY-CT border!
The water pump at Ten Mile Shelter is shut off for contaminants like the last few in New York. The Housatonic and Tenmile Rivers are also considered untreatable. Rather than leave my pack unattended, I carried it to a stream across the bridge over the Tenmile River and filled my reservoir. Then I backtracked to the shelter for the night. After making camp and wiping myself off with a wet bandanna, I ate the sandwich I carried out and a snack pack of black olives. I also finished my Nu Chocolat bar. I’ll nibble on an energy bar for dinner. 
Well, I made one good decision by staying in the shelter. A group of nine Boy Scouts and three leaders is setting up in the adjacent tent site. It’s the first overnight for the boys and they are loud!
I’m sorry to disappoint my readers by returning home, and I’m sure that when I do I’ll regret my decision. But for now, I have no doubt that it’s the right thing for my health. I still have many years left, and I would prefer having my brain intact for the duration.","Rt 22 (Tony’s Deli)

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665049,"Ghost, a GA-ME thru hiker came in last night. He retired after 20 years in the armed forces and plans to use his GI Bill to earn a second Bachelor’s Degree, but first he wants to hike the Triple Crown. He’s a man on a mission. 
The bird alarm went off at 4:00 and I was hiking by 6:00. Where the AT turns left to climb Schaghticoke Mountain, I continued straight up Schaghticoke Road for several miles to Kent. It was a most pleasant walk with just a few cars and trucks. The mountain and the Schaghticoke Reservation was on the left and the Housatonic River on the right. I saw a slightly squished but quite dead timber rattlesnake, only about a foot long. After washing my hands and face at the visitors center bathroom, I went to the laundromat, or rather tried to. It’s about a three minute walk but it took me nearly thirty minutes trying to follow Google Maps. The app was perfect but my brain just couldn’t seem to get things straight. I walked back to the visitors center to change out of my rain suit into clean clothes, stopping at the ATM at the bank. I found I had forgotten my PIN number but fortunately remembered what it spelled. And gave thanks that I’m going home to more fully recover. 
Most restaurants in Kent are closed for lunch on Monday, but I enjoyed a Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken and a loaf of garlic bread at KPG Kitchen and Bar. My appetite, at least, is healthy. I checked into the Fife & Drum Inn at 2:00 and luxuriated with a long shower, running out of hot water at the end. It only took three shampoos and soapings to feel clean. At 6:00, I’ll walk downstairs to the restaurant and eat and drink way too much. 
I heard from several folks reading my journal expressing their sadness and commending me for my good sense (what remains of it) and received more cards from the Girl Scout Junior Troop in Alexandria, Virginia. I look forward to seeing the original cards when I get home, and also the pictured painted rocks that I’ll keep on my desk. 
I stayed up past my trail bedtime, but it was worth it. The French onion soup was marvelous — not overly salty — and used croutons instead of a solid piece of bread so you could actually eat it.  A Hendricks martini, dry, straight up with a twist of lemon, left me mellow. And a glass of Super Tuscan was perfect with the pasta and light tomato-based sauce. The pappardelle were delicate and the shrimp tender.  This was decidedly not trail food so my hike is over.","Tenmile River Shekter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665228,"The Amtrak Ethan Allen Express got into Burlington about 10 minutes early on Tuesday (6/6) evening.  It was raining lightly, so I put on my rain jacket, hefted my pack, stepped onto the platform and promptly started walking in the wrong direction.  I know the station well but I was confused.  Did I really need another reminder about why I was coming home?  
I rested Wednesday and Thursday and tried making an appointment with my primary care doctor who understands me well.  Her staff offered me an appointment with the traveler doctor who removed my stitches, but I declined.  His advice to me a few weeks ago was essentially to act my age and to take up a more age-appropriate activity.  That wasn’t what I wanted to hear then and it isn’t what I want to hear now.  He had nothing to compare my immediate post-concussion status to.  Grrrrr!  I trust that they will get back to me with an appointment with my regular doctor.  If she offers the same advice, I’ll take it seriously.
I’ve unpacked my pack, including washing my down puffy and sleeping bag.  I’ll wash the other gear this weekend when it is forecast to be sunny.  Between rain showers and the Quebec smoke haze, New York State has been largely invisible across Lake Champlain.  I’ve duplicated my gear spreadsheet and saved it under 2024, noting changes I want to make and items needing replacement.  That’s right.  I’m already thinking about trying to thru-hike again next year, perhaps starting in Georgia so I can fail in a different state.  Next week, I’ll write a final entry focusing on what went well and what didn’t as a final entry for this journal.
As far as my gear went, I was pleased with it and plan very few changes.  My ULA-Equipment Circuit backpack is showing signs of wear and should probably be replaced with the Ultra Circuit. The strength and water resistance of the fabric has been improved.  I remain committed to carrying a bear canister and it fits well in the Circuit.  I will omit one shoulder pocket that I used for sunscreen, Picaridin, and things that I like to have at hand, like my tiny knife, whistle, and tick removal key.  They will fit nicely in one of the hip belt pockets.  I use the second hip belt pocket for snacks.  The second shoulder pocket is for my phone and reading glasses.  If I start in Georgia in mid-March next year, I’ll carry my 20* Western Mountaineering UltraLite sleeping bag instead of my 35* bag.   I am very happy with the Exped Ultra 1-R sleeping pad, but might switch to the more insulated 3-R model to start.  Also I would bring my REI fleece-lined trail pants through Mt. Rogers in Southwest Virginia.   I like my Altra Olympus V shoes but would probably switch to the water-resistant GTX model to start.  I’ll also consider a drinking tube insulator and moving my water reservoir to the inside of my pack. The southern Appalachians can be quite cold in early spring!  I need to replace one MSR Mini-Groundhog tent stake that I was unable to remove from the ground at Tony’s Deli.  I also need to reevaluate my first aid kit.  At the moment it is weighed down with blister remedies because of the problems I had early on this year, caused by the shoe delamination.  I’m not expecting that to recur. 
Resting is doing me good but complex thinking remains a stretch at this point.  I’ll start my morning walking and resistance training again tomorrow, but only if I tolerate it well.  I suppose I was foolish for returning to the trail just three weeks after my fall, but I really felt fully recovered.  I wasn’t.",,View Entry,"Jun 09, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665528,"[edited to add comment on rain pants 1/16/2023]My doctor has ordered an MRI of my head since some of my concussion symptoms, especially mental fog and confusion, came back when I returned to the trail. The MRI might show something but is more likely just to eliminate other causes than the nebulous diagnosis of post-concussion syndrome.   Now that I’ve been home for a week, the brain fog has lifted and I’ve returned to my routine of morning walks and strength training at the Y.  As is typical for me after a hike, I have found that I had to reduce weights about 15-20%, even on legs.  The only muscles that maintained their strength were the triceps, and that’s probably a result of using hiking sticks, especially double-poling on steep uphills.  My walking has been limited by a stalled frontal system that has brought nearly daily rain showers.  I was able to walk eight miles yesterday in two hours, but really should have slathered on Picaridin first.  The combination of warm temperatures and lots of standing water made for clouds of mosquitoes.  While my brain is feeling normal again, little things pop up that make me realize that it hasn’t fully recovered.  This morning, I walked down to the Y in the rain intending to work legs, but I forgot to bring my ankle straps.  Earlier this month, I mailed the quarterly property tax payments but forgot to put a stamp on the envelope.  It might be tempting to chalk up these minor lapses to normal forgetfulness of age, except that it’s not normal for me.  
Assuming that the MRI is unremarkable and that all of the post-concussion symptoms resolve, I intend to try yet again to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail next year.   I’m hoping to deal with my cataracts first.  Seeing obstacles clearly might reduce the odds of my tripping over them.   I had thought of doing a traditional northbound Georgia-to-Maine hike, but a friend in Atlanta reminded me why I’ve been trying flip-flop hikes lately.   March in Georgia and the Smokies can be very unpleasant, the wettest month in the Georgia mountains with snow possible and low temperatures in the teens.  Then there are the crowds.  The voluntary ATCamp registration chart on ATC’s website shows 1,366 Springer Mountain starts in March 2023, an average of 44 hikers a day.  No, thank you.  I’ll start at Rockfish Gap, the southern end of Shenandoah National Park, again in early April and hope to stay ahead of the bubble.    
I will make a few changes from this year, including starting with my 20* sleeping bag instead of my 35* bag.  I’m not sure where I’ll switch to my lighter bag, possibly Duncannon.  I played with my pack a little and found that moving my Platypus Big Zip Evo water bladder into the pack, using the hydration sleeve that used to come standardly with ULA packs, works very well.  Ever since I had a bladder leak in my pack, I’ve kept the water on the outside.  The leak was caused by a cross-threaded drinking tube at the bottom of the bladder.  The Big Zip opens at the top and seals well.  I trust it not to leak in my pack, and having the bladder between my back and the bear canister is very comfortable.  That would free up a side pocket for my sit pad.  I’ve been keeping the pad in the front pouch along with my sandals, but it’s hard to get in and out.  Having it more convenient might encourage me to use it at breaks and take longer breaks.  I made my pad years ago from a section of an old Therm-A-Rest Z-Lite pad, and it’s badly worn.  Some of the newer pads look much more comfortable.  On this last hike, I found myself lying down in camp when I would rather had been sitting because my pad didn’t provide enough cushioning under my relatively skinny butt.  I also want to upgrade my rainpants to the Montbell Rain Trekker model from the Versalite model.  It's a slightly more robust fabric and includes zippers on the lower legs so they can be put on and taken off over shoes. Too many times I didn't use my rain pants on chilly mornings or in light rain because I didn't want to deal with finding a place to sit.  As a bonus the new pants included a zipper fly!
The really good thing about this year’s hike was that my knees and legs were problem free.  The knee replacements will never have the range of motion of the factory originals.  Early on this year, I had a repeat of the pain on the back of my calves that knocked me off last year.  This time I knew what to do, thanks to what I learned in physical therapy.  A couple of days of sciatic glides, and the pain vanished, not to recur.  Sure, i got tired on the longer days, but the knees did very well on the rocky treadway of Pennsylvania, certainly better than my head did.   
Thanks for following along on my journey.  Next year’s will be longer!",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Thu",0
