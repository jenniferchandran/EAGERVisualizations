Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663553,"Sunday, May 21, I’m starting my hike of the 2,198 mile Appalachian Trail. This site will act as on my online journal. I can tell you where I am and what I’ve been doing and upload photos along the way.

I purposely did not tell many people about my plans. I didn’t want to make this big thing of it, then decide not to go. Then, as departure day approached, I didn’t want to detract from Phil’s illness and funeral service. I didn’t want the girls distracted from their studies and I didn’t want to deflect attention from the softball team and toward myself. I’m sorry if anyone feels let down by that.

Hiking the AT really captivated my imagination ever since I first read about the existence of the Trail as a teenager, probably in a Reader’s Digest. I was amazed by this hiking path that ran the length of the Appalachians, often right through or next to, towns. It seemed exotic and far away and something I’d probably never see.

I also recalled vividly the story of the guy who did a “Walk Across America”, a fair portion of which turned out to be along the AT. His trip was featured twice in National Geographic in the mid-70s. It was a very compelling story that turned into a book and a franchise (“Walk Across Europe”) even though I’m pretty sure this guy was not only the world’s worst writer; he might also be the world’s biggest liar. NG apparently never bothered to do much fact-checking on that tall tale.

Still, the idea never left me and I’ve since read a number of better books about hiking the AT in the last decade or so. I finally decided I need to do this, but as you can imagine, a 6-month hike is a bit hard to schedule what with a job, softball (girls and me), a divorce, nobody to watch the girls (or the dogs), a lawn that needs mowing, etc., etc. All the usual daily stuff that keeps us saying “yeah, someday...” 
So, I kept putting it off even though I knew if I waited too long, I might not be able to physically manage it. At the least, I’d have to wait for Paige and Amy to graduate high school. And now they have.

It still seemed like a long shot, then I lost my job in September and I knew this was it, now or never. I retired from softball coaching, clearing out my spring and summer. All that was left was the actual, conscious decision to really do it, which still took a couple of months to make. In fact, I didn’t really, finally commit until about a month ago.  

There are a number of ways to make the hike. The traditional method, and what I’d prefer, is to depart from Springer Mountain, GA in late March or April and walk north to Mt. Katahdin, ME over the course of five months or so. Most hikers do it that way, moving north as the weather warms, hopefully reaching Maine before the north end of the trail closes for the winter. A big problem, and one reason I decided not to do it this way, is tons of hikers start north over a couple of short weeks in the spring. They call it the “bubble”. The pack eventually thins out, but until then, you are competing for shelter space and sometimes walking in a crowd.

A few hardy types start in Maine and head south. That’s really tough due to terrain, weather and black flies and, although I admit to being intrigued by the novelty of a reverse hike, I know my limitations.

Section hikers complete stretches of the trail over time, eventually hiking the whole thing over a period of years. One guy took 21 years to finish the AT, basically a week at a time. I considered doing this, trying out a week or two just to see if I was really cut out for it, maybe giving myself the option to just keep going if it all went well. But not completing the trail in a single calendar year is less than a true thru-hike.

Since I had decided to wait for the kids to come home from college anyway, I ended up unretiring to coach a spring softball team with the idea that I could head to Georgia at the end of April, but business obligations and Phil’s funeral ruled that out. Eventually pushed back to a mid-May start, I’ve opted for a flip-flop hike, starting at the traditional midpoint of Harper’s Ferry, WV, then hiking north to Maine, where I’ll flip-flop back to Harper’s Ferry and hike south to Springer Mountain.

The advantages are obvious. It works with my schedule. I’ll have the most favorable weather for the north end of the hike, especially the dangerous stretch through the White Mountains, which I should hit in early July. I should complete the northern leg by early August and finish in Georgia by mid-Oct, avoiding the worst of the summer heat. I’ll be ahead of most of the northbound hikers going north, and they’ll be past me when I turn around to go south. The trail north of Harper’s Ferry is pretty easy, at least until you get to northern PA, so that gives me time to condition.

I’m well aware even if I make it to Maine, it will be very difficult to resume my hike in WV. The kids will be headed back to school and I don’t know who can watch the dogs. It will be very easy to just say, that’s enough, but I will be disappointed all the same. That’s a major drawback of the flip-flop. I suppose I could do the southern end next year, but that isn’t a true thru-hike. I guess I should try to survive the first week or so before I worry too much about that.

The amount of planning I’ve put into this is hard to believe. I spent several weeks evaluating, reading reviews and help guides, and trying stuff out. Even with the best lightweight gear I could find my pack weight is probably going to be over 25 lbs, I was hoping for closer to 20. That might not sound like much, but it feels like 40. I spent $400 on a sleeping bag that weighs less than a pound and $600 on a tarp and hammock that weigh almost three pounds. A $300 lightweight pack weighs two pounds. Three days of food and a 2 L of water, that’s 13 pounds, including the bear canister. Spare clothes, rain gear, a stove, various camping stuff, a phone, toiletries, it really adds up.

Several people asked if I will carry a gun. My lightest option is a five-shot 38 revolver that weighs about a pound, loaded. I’m more worried about two-legged varmints than bears, but as a practical matter, carrying a pistol is tough. Many states, basically North Carolina through Massachusetts, prohibit pistol carry without a permit. And to reach Harper’s Ferry, I probably have to fly into Wash DC or Baltimore, neither of which is known for firearms tolerance, so I’m not sure how I’d get a pistol to the trail in the first place. I don’t like it, but I may have to hike naked.

I plotted the route and know where I can stop for supplies and a rest. I estimate I can spend about 27 of 73 nights on the northern leg in a hotel or hostel. 42 nights can be in or near a shelter and 4 nights I’m in the open. Most hikers rest one day a week or so, that means 80 days to Maine. 
I practiced with my gear. I slept on the floor with my pad and sleeping quilt (my back got sore). Tried out the stove, figured out how to fit everything in the pack and I did a 10-mile test hike in Sam Houston Forest.  The bills are on autopay, I canceled the TV cable and I told my client I'm going to be busy for several weeks.

I don’t really know if I can do any of it. I told myself, no matter what happens, I will give it two weeks. Maybe I’ll end up hating it so much, I’ll pull the plug. Or I could get injured, a sprained ankle, infected blisters, Lyme disease or sore knees and hips that keep me from continuing.  But if I don’t do it now, I’m might never, so here goes.",,View Entry,"May 10, Wed",0
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664141,"Pretty long, hard day of travel and I haven't even walked anywhere yet.Got in from my final business trip last night and spent a few hours finishing up on last minute details. Got up at 7:00 this morning to find out my flight was delayed, instantly creating anxiety as i had only a two hour window to make the train in DC and Southwest just cut that in half. Flight wasn't really a problem but we land in Washington at 2:48 and the train leaves at 4:05. The train only runs once a day so if I miss this one I'm not getting to Harpers Ferry until Sunday night. I'd be a day behind before taking my first step on the trail. So, I'm in row 20 tapping my foot waiting for the slowest deplaning passengers in recorded history to get out of the way. I finally get off the plane and find that my Uber, $23 on the plane, is now $55. Oy. I walk out of the airport after a much-needed bathroom stop and come out right by the cab stand. Guy asked me if I want one, I figure why not, the taxi is right there, I'll have to wait 5-10 min I don't have for an Uber and a cab can't be more than 55 bucks right?Lots of traffic but i make it to Union Station with 40 min to go. Best, the cab ride only cost me $20. Cool. I even tipped the dude $10. I get into the station and after a few troublesome moments managed to find my way to the right gate. In the end, it worked out fine, but I havent been in a train station since Amsterdam in 2008; having the signs in English was only marginally easier.It took about an hour ago to get to Harpers Ferry. Of course, just as we pull in, it starts pouring rain. At least I know my new rain jacket works pretty well. Harpers Ferry is tiny, there's really only one place to stay here that doesn't cause 200 bucks a night and it was full. I took an Uber to a nearby town and I got a free room at the Motel 6 thanks to my hotel.com points. Very decent room unfortunately the other guests are Motel 6 quality.Had some surprisingly decent Mexican food and bought some snacks at the Dollar General so I'm set until tomorrow. Naturally, as soon as I get back to the hotel, my reading glasses break so I'll have to go back to the dollar store tomorrow. Then it's back to Harpers Ferry, over to the ATC headquarters for my photo, and a 2-mile walk to pick up my pack. Tomorrow night I'll be camping at Crampton Gap shelter, an 11 mile walk. With all the other stuff I have to do, I figure I'll be there by late afternoon. Here's hoping the rain goes away. I'm going to have to deal with it sooner or later, but be nice to figure some things out before I have to worry about getting drenched.",,View Entry,"May 20, Sat",0
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664213,"Started the day a the ATC headquarters. Got my photo taken and my pack tag, then I had to walk 2 miles to get my pack which I was happy to have. It's an easy walk out of Harpers Ferry aling the Potomac River and rather pretty too. I'm in Maryland now my second state already.
 Picking up the pack was rough. I had to climb up the side of a hill that was so steep they put ropes there for you to pull yourself up.. But I was happy to get it with no problems.
There was a guy there told me his pack was over 50 lb. He was a big dude but I can't believe that. He was rather complimentary when I told him mine only weighed 28.
After a few miles you leave the river tow path and start walking up hills. It's Sunday so I saw lots of day hikers, but they gradually petered out the farther I went Just woods now, nothing spectacular.
I started running low on water toward the end of the day . The shelter has an unreliable water source but there's a park with a spigot less than a half mile beforr you reach the shelter. I didn't realize the trail goes right through the park in fact I got a bit confused and thought I missed a turn. I got filled up then I had to find where the trail went from there which was not easy. 
The trail leading out was brutal, short but steep. Made it to the shelter about 5 and got set up. It took me four tries to get my hammock hung though. I practiced at home but I couldn't actually get in the thing until now. That made it a bit harder. Even though I just filled my bottles I was out of water by the time dinner was over. I guess I'd gotten quite thirsty.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, it is 7 miles to the next water source.So I put on my Crocs and walked back to the park to refill the bottles. Climbing that steep section again sucked, I was pretty sweaty by the time I got back to camp
The hammock is indeed comfortable but it was hot as hell at first and you better not have claustrophobia. It probably took me about 3 hours to set up camp, cook dinner, and go get more water. I'm sure I'll get faster. 
Looks like there's only one other guy here at the camp site. I only saw him when he hung his food on the bear pole. I'm glad nobody saw me struggling with the hammock but it does occur to me it might be nice to have several other tents around instead of being out here by myself.
My feet and legs are a little sore but not bad. 13 miles tomorrow and there's a place for a free hot shower at the halfway point. I'll probably take advantage of that.
Wildlife count: three deer, a 3-ft long black and green snake, a groundhog and lots of cardinals and butterflies.
I'd say today was about 90% hassle and 10% fun. I'm sure that will improve though.","Harpers Ferry

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664387,"Day started easy, I quickly hiked 7 miles to Dahlgren backpackers campground where I got a hot shower and had some lunch. I wanted to charge my phone but the outlet didn't work so I had to keep the phone off for the next couple days.
I was feeling pretty good but I think I went a little too hard on a warm afternoon and burned myself out. The last 200 yards to the shelter were uphill and pure misery. The campground had a ton of people in it and there was no place to pitch my hammock. I was too tired anyway so I just threw my stuff into the shelter with some other hikers including Julie that I met the day before and a guy from West Bloomfield named Jack.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664390,"After the hard day yesterday, I thought it might be a good idea to cut this one a little bit short. Looking at my options, I noticed that my original destination, the Ravens Rock shelter, was at the top of a very steep climb. I don't want to do that at the end of the day when I'd be tired. 
I woke up to the sight of a huge spider on the wall of the shelter. The hiking wasn't particularly notable other than a couple of rocky bits. I reached the shelter about 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon. Julie and Lisa another hiker who was at Crampton Gap said they were going to stop there but I guess they decided to go on to Ravens Rock because the place was empty when I got there.
The maintenance guy came by after a couple hours and gave me a big bag of Gummy Bears. It's amazing how generous people are. I ate a few then gave the rest to some other hikers who showed up including three who started in Georgia back in March. Then a girl came by with a bunch of fresh picked strawberries and handed those around, boy were they good.
My cough is really bad at night. Fortunately, my hammock was not close to the shelter or I would have kept everybody awake. 
Things that have been great: 
Tuna with mayo - heavenly
Weather - perfect. 60s-70s, sunny, no rain
Hiking poles - absolute necessity. Save me from a number of falls already
Stuff not so great:
Hacking cough - i may have to go the doctor
Knee pain - one of the other hikers had a compression sleeve he recommended it I'll get one tomorrow and see if it helps
The food mostly sucks  - I didn't eat much the first few days. Most hiking food is really awful or maybe I just don't have much of an appetite because I don't feel like eating candy bars or trail mix either.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664391,"I wanted to get up early and make good time because I had to get to Rouzerville for a package before the post office closed at 4:30.
The first bit was very easy, hay fields and relatively flat terrain. Then I hit the climb up to Ravens Rock shelter. Boy, I'm glad I didn't try to do this yesterday, it was steep. I stopped there for some lunch and change my socks. It was at this point I realized I left my new rain jacket at the last shelter. Bummer.
I thought I had an even steeper climb ahead of me. That turned out not to be true, but there was a very steep rocky drop. My left knee has been hurting and it's worse on the downhill so that was very slow and difficult. Once I got to the bottom it was pretty easy and I raced to make it to the road by 345 pm. The post office is about a mile and a half from there and I didn't know if I'd make it but a guy stopped and offered me a ride. He already had another hiker with him named Eight Lives. I got my box and he took me to the hotel where I checked in.  I went out and had some dinner then stopped by Walmart to pick up a few things, including a knee brace.
I'm only slightly behind at this point since I considered stopping for night here anyway. Back on tomorrow we'll see how I do with the knee and the cough.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664493,"Had breakfast at the hotel got my package mailed and caught a ride back to the trailhead from a guy who used to live in Allen Park and Taylor, right at Van Born and Pelham. I didn't start hiking till about 10:00 a.m. and made it to the shelter about 4:00. There's a mom there with her kid, he just graduated from the University of Michigan.Not sure if the knee brace is helping or not but about half the day I had no pain at all, unfortunately other times it felt like I couldn't put any weight on that leg at all.I packed up my Under Armor base layer because it's been very warm, of course as soon as I mail it the temperature drops into the mid 40s.  Fortunately, at the last minute I decided to keep my silk underwear which was nice. Also very happy with my down quilts, I didn't get cold at all. The sleeping quilt was expensive but has been worth every penny.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664495,"Same deal as yesterday with the knee. Put in 6.6 miles by lunch, more than halfway, but it took me almost 5 hours to go to the last 5 miles. I did spend almost an hour at a state park dumping some trash, washing up in the restroom and trying to get my phone charged. I shouldn't have bothered.
The shelter is the nicest one I've seen so far all the other hikers are taking photos, it was so cool. I'll post one later.
The mom and the Michigan kid are here so is a guy named Buckle that I met yesterday. He's in his seventies but he keeps passing me up the trail, I can't keep up with him. He's already done at least one thru hike. 
Trying to go to bed but this lady showed up with two young girls and they're making all sorts of racket. Hikers are usually asleep by 8 or 9:00, I think these people are just weekend campers.

",Quarry Gap shelter,"May 26, Fri",12
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664634,"Got started early and made the first 8 miles pretty fast even though there was one steep up a steep down. Pennsylvania is much drier than Maryland with some conifers which is nice. I found the MD woods to be a bit dreary and dank.
Knee pain comes and goes for no apparent reason but does seem to be less frequent each day.
Lots of people out for Memorial Day weekend and I twice ran into Trail Magic. The first after a steep drop that had me limping. Someone had put out some rolls of toilet paper for whoever needed it and a cooler with cokes and candy bars. I sat down with a couple female hikers one named Sunkist who started in Georgia back in March. A few miles later, someone left a box of chips in a parking lot by the road. I grabbed a bag of Fritos for later.
I arrived at the shelter to find Buckle, the U of M kid and his mom, whose name is Susan. They made fine company, we had a long chat around the campfire ring. The campsite was great right next to a babbling brook, but crowded with all the Memorial Day campers.
Susan and her son saw a huge rattlesnake earlier in the day.  They left warning notes but I guess I didn't see the first one only the second, after I passed the spot. The snake must have moved on.
No wildlife today","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664635,"I covered the four miles into Pine Furnace State Park pretty easily. I can feel my legs getting stronger.
Pine Furnace is famous for its ice cream challenge. Thru hikers must eat a half gallon of ice cream to win. I was doubtful about doing this. I didn't have much to eat for breakfast, so I ordered a sizeable egg bacon and cheese sandwich from the grill. Figuring I needed to wait 45 minutes for my phone to charge and after watching some skinny hiker kid finish the challenge, I figured what the heck. Took me about an hour but wasn't really all that hard. For my effort I get a little wooden token. 
Susan and her son are going home they were only out for a week. She gave me her last instant Starbucks and her leftover fuel can. She also gave me her email and asked me to let her know if I make it or not.
Buckle is also leaving the trail I think he's going to Harrisburg for a few days. I'm sure I'll see him later.
Turns out my body really needed all that sugar and protein from the ice cream. Kept me pretty charged up into the late afternoon. I got to a private campground by 6:15 and rented a tent space for $10. Had a huge pizza and a shower (I was starting to smell like 3-day-old spoiled shrimp) and I'm ready to pass out. Boy, my feet hurt.

Got out about 7:45 a.m. A little rugged in the morning had to get up and over a couple of ridges, but once I reached the other side it was all corn fields to Carlisle. Reached the trail town of Boiling Springs about 2pm and had a snack. Nice looking place. I've now hiked 100 miles.
As I'm walking out of town,  I meet a guy walking his dogs and he offers to carry my pack for me back to where his truck was parked, two miles away. That gave me a nice break and we had a very nice chat on the way. 
Gear has been good. It has mostly performed as expected and I haven't had any major failures. Weather has been gorgeous. Maybe I can be the first guy to walk the AT without ever being rained on. I doubt it, but nine days in a row to start.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664818,"My zero day was pretty boring, but I figured my feet and legs could use the rest. Ate some pancakes, did a little shopping and some laundry. 645 am this morning, i was back hiking.
My feet and legs felt good all day long. Weird because they were sore and stiff the whole time in the hotel.
Walking was easy first few hours, hay fields and pastures. Really nice spring day, something the photos can't show you is the scents. Fresh cut hay, wildflowers, just overwhelming greenery.
The walk up Cove Mountain was a little tough and I almost ran out of water. Getting water at the top of the mountain was really tough, you got to walk down a steep trail almost 300 yards and I had to do it twice because I dropped my filter bag on the first trip.
I was originally going to stay in that shelter but decided there push on to Duncannon and stay in a hostel tonight. I'm officially a little ahead of schedule now. Buckle is here, he didn't recognize me probably because I shaved back in Carlisle. He's going to Harrisburg tomorrow.
Had dinner at the Doyle Hotel, a famed hiker hangout. Quiet night or maybe the rowdy days are over. 
I'll pick up my box at the post office tomorrow morning then I'll have a short day, only 11 miles to the next shelter. I did 18 today, a new high.

A lot of climbing early in the day and it's been hot. Some great views today. I forgot to put my knee brace on this morning, but since the knee wasn't giving me any pain I didn't bother. Held up good all day. Yay. And my cough is all but gone, too. I think I've decided I can do this indefinitely.
Shelter's pretty nice and i have a good campsite, but to get water you have to go 300 yards down a really steep path. It sucks, but I have to go back down again tomorrow morning to fill up since it's more than 6 miles to the next water source.
The shelter also has the worst privy I've seen in the whole trip. It's norovirus waiting to happen, better to poop in the woods.
The next shelter is 18 miles away. I think I can make it although the route does not look that easy. Hopefully I can get a very early start and get a lot of miles in before it gets too hot, will be over 90 tomorrow. 
Met a Jewish kid named Bambi at the shelter. He's at least the third Jew I've met on this trip. They all knew right away that Amy and Paige were on a Birthright trip to Israel.Also here is Red and his girlfriend.

My hat is also nearly a goner. I kind of laughed when Leya gave it to me this hat with all of its lights, but it turned out to be really useful. I wore it all the time, something she found endlessly amusing. But the wires are all corroded and brittle. I tried repairing them before I left but it only lasted a day. I have another one that Alex and Andrew gave me I'll probably use that even though it only has one light instead of three.
Long walk today, didn't get to the shelter till about 7:30. As soon as I get my hammock and tarp up, the rain moves In. I thought about bailing for the shelter but since everything was already pitched I just rode it out. Just a steady light rain for 2 hours.

There aren't many options in this stretch, so I just have to hang tough until I get to Port Clinton in a couple of days.
Met a young girl on the trail named Jukebox. I just finished a 1,000-ft climb and was sitting down to rest when she came along gasping for air, asking why do they do this to us. She's 21 and just finished college.
Jukebox was at the Penn shelter when I showed up.  A troop of Boy Scouts and a couple of dads were also there. Looked like rain and I didn't feel like putting up the hammock anyway so I threw my stuff in the shelter. Good thing too, because right after dinner it starts raining. Not too hard, just fits and starts that would make you miserable if caught out in it. Even though the floor is kind of hard, I kept warm, snug and dry.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665036,"I wanted to try to hustle today and make it to the next shelter even though it's 19 miles and the trail has been getting very rocky.
I make it to PA 183, my original destination by 5:00, so I can make it to the shelter by 8:00 or 9:00. That would leave me with a short hike to Port Clinton tomorrow, which would be great. I need time to resupply, get a hotel, do some laundry.
The last couple of days I've been cursing whatever Trail Club is responsible for this stretch of trail. It is marked very poorly, I often have to guess which way to go. I'm right most of the time but I got one wrong and I ended up about 0.25 mile out of my way before I figured it out.
When I reach 183, there's trail magic, which is awesome since I'm on short rations anyway. I get two pieces of very tasty homemade bread and two Modelos. I had no idea how important that was going to be.
I cross the road and go about a half mile when I come out of the woods with four roads in front of me and no markers. I put my pack down and scout down each of the four looking for a blaze, but there isn't one. I finally decide the gravel service road in front of me is the best option and start walking. 
My phone tells me the trail should be up ahead a mile or so, but when I get there it isn't. I wander down a couple of overgrown forest roads trying to find it to no avail. I meet two different couples out walking the road they both tell me the trail crosses again but it's several miles ahead. I can see it on my phone, I also see that's only a mile from my shelter. 
So I start hoofing as fast as I can, hoping to get there by dark. Of course I never find it. I pitched my hammock along the trail and will figure out what to do in the morning. I built a small campfire which was nice and ate what little food I had left. Using my phone to try to find the trail depleted the battery.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665050,"Pretty cold last night, probably made worse that my stuff was damp. The hammock, sleeping quilt, clothes and me all stink to high heaven. I got up after an hour and washed off with a little soap and water just so I could sleep.
Looking things over I had three options. I could keep hiking up the service road and hope to finally find the AT. I could take a blue blazed side trail that is supposed to intersect the AT and find it that way. Or I could turn around and go back to the highway, hoping to find the right route this time.
I decided to walk back to PA 183, then head south to the interstate about 3 miles away, then try to get a ride into Hamburg or Port Clinton where I can resupply and get a hotel. I was done with that stretch of Trail.
I get packed up and 5 minutes after I start walking four Forest Service guys come along in a pickup truck and give me a ride back to PA 183. I can't believe how far I walked it must have been five or six miles. I hike down to the interstate and there's a strange gas station/ sheepskin store. Like a convenience store crossed with a Wilsons or Sheplers. I end up having a couple cups of coffee with the old ladies who run the place and got my phone charged up.
I had no luck getting a ride in the Hamburg but with my phone charged I could see there was a state road that ran parallel to the interstate to Hamburg, about 10 miles. I walk about 3 miles and in the middle of nowhere where it has no right to be is a coin-operated laundromat. There's nobody there. I get quarters and detergent and wash all my clothes. At my last stop, I bought a cheap pair of shorts and a shirt so I have something to wear while I wash my dirty stuff. 
While I'm waiting for my clothes to dry, this old guy comes in to wash his whites. He sees my pack and starts asking questions and I tell him what I'm doing and where I'm headed. I get all finished up, I'm getting ready to go and he offers me a ride. Awesome. He takes me to Hamburg then up to Port Clinton, shows me around, then back to Hamburg and he drops me off at the hotel.
Bad news though, the hotel has no vacancies and this is the only hotel open in Port Clinton or Hamburg. But the girl says check back after 3:00 maybe they'll have a cancellation. So I walk next door to the Cracker Barrel where I wolf down a roast beef dinner. I was so hungry only shame could keep me from ordering a second one.
I get over to Walmart and replenish my supplies. There's a Cabela's here that runs a shuttle up to Port Clinton for hikers, I think the last one leaves at 5 pm. I can't get anybody at the hotel on the phone but I have just enough time to walk back down there and check. If they don't have anything, I'll have to walk over to the Cabela's, catch the shuttle, camp in Port Clinton tonight and then two more days before I get a chance for a shower. 
Hallelujah,  they have one room and I get it. I don't even care what the rate is. I get a shower, clean up all my gear,  repack everything and go out for a burger. I get a bunch of phone calls and other business done. The shuttle out of Cabela's leaves at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow so I'll get up, eat breakfast at Cracker Barrel and be back on the trail by 10:30, more or less on schedule.
Strictly speaking, I'll bypass about 14 miles of trail. But I probably wandered around for six or seven miles last night trying to find blazes that weren't there and I had to walk another five or six miles before I got a ride to Hamburg. So I'm not going to feel too bad about it. I will have missed Jukebox in Port Clinton, which is disappointing as I rather liked her.
Saw four more deer before the forest guys picked me up this morning. Man, they were thick back there.","

Two hikers were waiting to take the shuttle back into Hamburg, one was the girl i met at the Duncannon post office. I dont recall her name, but with her glasses and short brown hair, she looks like Luann who used to live next door on S Vaughn Cir.Met a couple om the trial, Right Here and Blaze. They started in GA, but injury to Blaze forced them off in Damascus, VA. After healing up, they rented a car and got back on at Pt Clinton.Stopped got lunch, then the rain came. I struggled to get my poncho over my pack, but finally managed to use it and my rain jacket to cover up. I probably looked like an idiot, but it worked. The rain only lasted 20 min, but made everything damp and sticky for the rest of the day.Ran into Hero and two other hikers late in the day. They made great company for the last 3 miles. Made it to the shelter, it is a converted garage with bunks, running water and a shower.There are two Germans here that I met this morning in the hotel. They were having breakfast when i left so I'm not sure how they beat me here.Pretty good day despite the rain. Saw a doe and two fawns and two red spotted newts.","
",Ecksville Shelter,"Jun 06, Tue",15
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665168,"Got on the trail about 7:30 a.m. The early going was rough with a steep climb and lots of rock scrambles. By 1:00 p.m. I'd only gone 7 miles with 10 to go. I wanted to make the shelter so I'd have a short hike into town tomorrow and possibly take an extra day off with rain in the forecast.
The first few miles after lunch were really easy, then I hit the Knife Edge. This is a ridge of rock 5 to 10 ft wide with 80 ft drops on each side. I had to lash my hiking poles to my pack and climb along a bunch of narrow ledges by my fingertips. I made it down without incident but man I hope I never have to do anything like that again. Talk about your anus-clenching adventure.I finally make it to the shelter about 7:30 Julie is there the hiker I met on the first night. We don't recognize each other at first probably because I have a much thicker beard and she was wearing a hoodie. She came out of her tent when she heard me yelling at a porcupine that had wandered over and was chewing on the shelter floor while I was making dinner. She's from Florida and didn't know porcupines can't shoot their quills but can climb trees. The porcupine didn't run far so she did get some nice photos.The weather has been unseasonably cold, at least 15 degrees below normal. Probably because there's a big forest fire up in Canada casting a heavy haze of smoke the last 2 or 3 days. Looking out from the ridges you can't see anything it is so thick.The shelter is old and lopsided. There's no place to hang my hammock here and no water. I wear three layers of clothing to bed. Around 3:00 a.m. I hear scratching outside the shelter. I flash my light outside but don't see anything. 15 minutes later more scratching, close. I turn on my head lamp and there's the porcupine on the shelter step, two feet from my head. I holler at him until he waddles off. My shelter mates probably think I'm nuts. I sleep the rest of the night with my hiker pole next to me. The porcupine doesn't return probably realizing if he does, he's going to get a sharp poke this time.","

A couple days ago I coincidentally heard from two different softball parents within an hour of each other. For you softball families out there, make sure your daughters know how important they are to keeping me motivated. I'm sure they remember the many occasions I quoted what Tom Hanks says in A League of Their Own when Geena Davis wants to quit, that if something was easy anybody could do it. The hard is what makes it great.
Now it's time to take my own advice. The thought of disappointing any of those kids, including my own, keeps me going.
And boy, I needed it today. I planned to hike to Palmerton only 9 miles away and stay there overnight. But I couldn't find any place to stay, so I reserved a spot at a bed and breakfast in Danielsville, 5 miles further. The owner warned me those five miles were very steep. It didn't look bad on the map but she was right. After a steep 300-400 ft ascent on the trail,  I came to a series of boulder fields and cliffs. I had to climb over and through a bunch of huge rocks, then haul myself up three 30-40 foot high cliffs. Fingers and toes gripping inch-wide ledges, I managed to get up to the top without breaking my neck. I signed up to hike, not solo free climb sheer rock faces.
I said yesterday I hope I never had to do a climb like that again. Well I did, and about 10 times worse. I guess I've managed to successfully navigate every challenge the trail has thrown at me, there's that. I'm not sure how much further I want to press my luck either.
The bed and breakfast is rather lovely. I ordered and ate an entire pizza. 15 miles tomorrow the Wind Gap and I'm taking a day off. 15 miles after that and I'm done with Pennsylvania. Every hiker I've met is ready to be done with this stretch.If you want to see what I climbed today, look for YouTube videos titled AT climb out of Palmerton. There's at least two videos,  although truthfully they don't really capture the height and steepness of my personal Cliffs of Insanity.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665257,"Ate a serviceable breakfast at the BnB, then the host dropped me off at the trailhead at 8 am.
I hurt my right knee on one of the rock climbs a couple days ago. Doesn't really hurt much but it's very swollen. I was going to ice it last night but I fell asleep. Anyway I put the brace on that knee today and it seemed to do ok. I have ice for it tonight.
Fairly pleasant hiking today. Cool sunny weather, only saw a couple hikers today. The trail was a lot less rocky that has been the past several days.
Right at the end of the day I came across a burned area of woods. We've been hearing for several days there was a forest fire in this area and I think they actually closed the trail for a while. I guess it is out now.
I was going to spend two days in Wind Gap since I have to pick up my box from the post office here. But on the hike I decided to make it just one since the weather is going to be good tomorrow and probably Sunday before rain moves in for several days. I'll wait till then to take a day off.
Good call as the only motel here is an absolute fleabag. Seriously,  the worst I've ever been in. I'll probably sleep in my quilt on top of the covers rather than get into the bed. I'll have to be sure to stash all my food or I'm sure mice will get it. At least I got a hot shower.
I may have to rethink some of these town stays. I need to go into town for supplies but lodging has tended to be overpriced,  a dump, or like tonight, both. I'd be better off sleeping in the woods honestly.
20 minute walk into town but I did find a very nice sports bar where I had some chicken wings. Hoped to find a decent breakfast spot near the post office but no luck, so I'll be having tea and some Hostess Donuts in the room tomorrow morning. On my search for a breakfast cafe I did find an ice cream shop which had a bunch of really cool vintage candy including candy cigarettes and bubble gum cigars. I had a sundae and bought a couple snacks for the trail.
It's still very cold, dropping into the low 40s at night.

I got a fair number of things I needed out of the bounce box like sanitizer, a fresh bottle of insect repellent, hot chocolate mix, potatoes, trail mix and mayo. I also retrieved my Under Armor base layer which means it will be 90F every day from now on.
I mailed the remaining items up to Kent, CT where I'll be in about 14 days. That's probably the final trip for that box, anything left over after Kent will probably just get shipped home.
I didn't get on the trail until 10:00 a.m. Julie aka Chicken Wing was at the trailhead enjoying some trail magic. I realize I've been telling you about all these people but you have no idea what they look like, so I'm going to take photos, starting with Julie.
With a late start, I had to hurry to make it to the hostel at Delaware Water Gap at a reasonable hour. Although the trail was really rocky for most of the day, I did pretty well and got to town about 7 pm, well ahead of my best expectation.
I'm staying in a church hostel tonight. It is very clean and comfortable and I surprisingly have the place to myself. And it's free although I did leave $10 in the donation box.
DWG is like most of the other small Pennsylvania towns with a bunch of old houses, but they mostly seem to be pretty well kept up here. They have a nice section of town with some cool restaurants although everything closes up by 8 pm, even on a Saturday night.
20 miles tomorrow so I have to get up early. The hostel in High Point had an cancellation, so I'll be staying there Monday and Tuesday night, taking a zero day. Probably going to rain everyday starting Monday, so might as well.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665361,"Done with PA! Nothing wrong with Pennsylvania at all, but it feels good to cross a state off. At 229 miles, only Virginia, Tennessee and Maine have more trail.
Too bad the rain wasn't coming in today because the church hostel in Delaware Water Gap was great and I wouldn't mind staying there another day. I was the only hiker there so I just slept on one of the sofas.
There was a scale at the hostel. I weighed in at about 196 lb. I'm not sure what my weight was when I left but probably 208-209 lb, so I've lost at least 10 lb. I may have to buy new hiking pants.
I crossed the I-80 Bridge into New Jersey at 6 am and hit the trail. I made pretty good time and that let me stop at the AMC Mohican Outdoor Center for lunch. It was pretty great, a grilled ham and cheese with chips, cucumber salad, and a Milky Way bar. I washed it all down with two Diet Cokes, one of the things I crave the most while on the trail. Man were they good.
On the way out, I ran into Bob and Tracy. a couple of hikers I've been seeing regularly the last couple weeks. Bob is from New Hampshire, I'm guessing Tracy is too.
Bob is a snake magnet, he's seen at least a dozen rattlesnakes in the last week. He also saw two bears a few hours before this photo was taken. They started in Georgia in March and I'm rather pleased to be keeping up with these two veteran hikers.
I had some easy stretches in the afternoon which was great since I had a long way to go. While crossing a road, I found one of those air horns. It still works, so I'll keep it handy if any bears decide to show up tonight.
Bears don't worry me too much, they tend to be rather timid, although this time of year before the blueberries come in they are still hungry from hibernation and don't have a lot of food sources. I like my hammock, but if a bear decided to bite me while I'm in it, it's almost impossible to get out of fast. Do you know what you call a hiker in a hammock? A bear burrito.
21 miles today, a new high. I'll break it tomorrow because I have to go 22 to make it to High Point State Park. That's where the hostel will pick me up for my 2-day stay.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665409,"The bears left both me and my bear canister alone last night. I got up at 5 am, had something to eat, broke camp and was on the trail by 6:20.
All day it was chilly, windy and overcast. I didn't see the sun once all day. The hosteler agreed to pick me up at High Point State Park at 8 pm. I started to think I was going to dodge the rain until about 3:00 p.m. when it started to drizzle off and on. It did that for a couple hours, then it started to rain steadily. The shirt I'd been wearing all day was completely soaked, so I changed into my dry Under Armor and that kept me warm and snug. I threw my poncho on, successfully this time, and i was in pretty good shape for the next couple hours. My gaiters keep my socks and the top of my shoes dry and the poncho covers everything down to my knees.
With all the rain I couldn't use my phone or map. I had told my ride earlier in the afternoon I was going to make it out at 7:30 pm, but when they texted me asking how close I was, I couldn't reply. I didn't know anyway because I couldn't check the map for landmarks. The rain made the rocks pretty slippery and I fell once while descending a cliff face, without injury but it could have been worse. I was really happy when I walked out into the state park headquarters parking lot at 7:29. The shuttle had given up and gone home, she had to come back and get me. Fortunately, the headquarters building keeps the vestibule open, so I was able to get inside out of the rain. Now, I'm at the hostel, in dry clothes after a hot shower.
I decided 20+ mile days are too long. I can't move fast enough. I have to get up early and hike late to make that distance. I have tomorrow off, then another 20 mi hike to Vernon NJ. That's the last one for a while.Sometime around midday, I crossed the 300 mile hiked threshold. I'm over 25% of the way to Katahdin.

Bob and Tracy showed up in the afternoon. I didnt know it would be them as the hosteler referred to them by the their trail names AOG and Mule.

Hiking was pretty easy all day. It was great having the company of the other three hikers. The rain started about noon when we reached Unionville, NY where Bob and Tracey had some new shoes shipped. Mine are getting worn, too. Hiker shoes are good for maybe 500 miles, but 1 mile in PA probably counts as two.
We had lunch and set out in the rain. It wasn't too bad, my jacket and poncho did a decent job keeping everything dry. The rain lifted for a couple of hours as we passed through a wildlife refuge where we saw several deer, a crawfish, turtles and more. The rain started up again later in the afternoon, so we cut our day about 3 miles short and caught a shuttle to our motel. 
Today might have been most enjoyable day of hiking, even with the rain. The four of us seem well-matched, so perhaps we will stick together for awhile.
Bob is a hunter and tracker, he showed me photos of some of the monster bucks he's shot in Vermont and New Hampshire. He sees the most wildlife, including three bears today, one of which I probably walked right by without seeing.

Right in the middle is a rather cool wooden suspension bridge. We somehow only made about 4.miles in 3 hours, probably because we stopped to talk to several people along the way. At a road crossing, we got ice cream, donuts and hot dogs for lunch, pretty much in that order.Then we had to ascend The Stairway to Heaven. Very steep 800+ foot climb with lots of rocks, many arranged like steps hence the name. That took a solid hour. I regretted my two hot dogs.Due to our late start and slow pace, there was no way we were going to make it to the next shelter on the trail, so we opted for a hiker mainstay, the drive-in theater in Warwick, NY. For five bucks they let you put your tent on the grass at the back of the lot and you can watch three movies at the same time.

A guy bought us some bananas and trail bars, then a woman driving her husband up to the trail offered to come back and pick us up. 
We got started about 9 am, but only had 12 miles to go. By noon, we'd reached the NY state line. Shortly after, the trail got rocky, with several climbs. The only really steep bit had metal rungs, but the rock climbs went on for two hours. Then the rain came in, hard and steady. Fortunately, we had only a couple more climbs on the wet rocks. Bob, Slipper and I were able to help each other out, but we all still fell at least once. 
We caught up with AOG at a road crossing about 330 pm, two miles short of the shelter. He'd already called a shuttle and motel. We were all soaked to the bone, hands and feet shriveled from the wet, so the idea of camping in a damp shelter wasn't appealing, even if it meant another short day. The motel is pleasant and inexpensive, and the manager did our laundry for us, although my shoes will still be wet tomorrow.

First part of the day was very nice, sunny and breezy. Lots of rock climbs though, Bob can't say enough about how much he hates the trail in NY. The climbs mostly aren't very high or difficult but there are lots of them and early on Slipper slipped (hence her name).  I saw it happen and hoped it wouldn't be as bad as it looked, but it pretty much was. She barked her shin on a rock edge and went down immediately. I can say it wasn't broken, but that hurt. In a matter of minutes, she had a huge swollen yellow and purple bruise. Tough lady, she put some cold water on it and carried on. It was a reminder to us all, be careful.
Ticks are a real concern now. We stopped for lunch and were constantly picking deer and dog ticks off each other. It is definitely time to renew the tick treatment on my clothes.
Late in the afternoon, a thunderstorm rolled in. Not a lot of rain, but we got hit with pea-size hail. All the climbs wore us out, so when we reached the state highway a few miles short of the shelter, everyone was ready to bail. We caught an Uber to the nearest fleabag motel and settled in.

The hotel was a bit rough, so the other hikers didn't even want to fill their water bottles there, but I did. Good thing, decent water sources have been hard to find in New York, giving Bob one more reason to hate the state.
Encountered the lemon squeezer today, a rock fissure so narrow you have to push your pack ahead of you until you can lift it up out of the squeezer. Not difficult but unusual.
Right after though is an overhang. It is only 8-9 ft high, but the rock juts out with few handholds. Tracey tried, but couldnt do it. He and Bob bypassed it, Bob has too many miles in to get hurt on an unecessary climb.
Slipper did it though, so I decided to take a look. It was a bit tricky with the barest of hand and toeholds, but I made it. Slipper and I both felt rather proud to have made that climb when the other two guys couldn't.
We stopped for lunch at a state park on Lake Tiorati. It was very crowded being Father's Day. All we could get was some junk and ice cream out of the vending machines. We ate our lunch with the smell of grilling hamburgers all around us. Nobody offered us as much as a cookie.
For you non-hikers:
If you see a hiker walking on a road, he is not hiking, he is looking for a ride.
Hikers will always accept, and are almost always looking for, food handouts. Our diet tends to be monotonous and spartan. I watched the guy at the table next us eat four cupcakes all by himself. Couldn't you at least let us lick the paper cups?
The weather is quite nice, sunny and warm but a bit of a late start, a lot of time fooling around with the lemon squeezer and a long lunch at the state park meant we had to stop at a shelter a little earlier than planned. It probably didn't matter, Bob's foot is really hurting him and this stretch of trail does not have conveniently located shelters. 
The early halt let us relax and eat dinner together. It was actilually really nice to sleep in my hammock.

Not much when I walk thankfully, but sitting and sleeping can really aggravate it. The brace doesnt seem to help much. I need to ice it, but seems like i cant get ice anywhere.We made good time early and reached the Palisades Parkway mid-morning. That's a very busy freeway and a hiker was killed there a couple years ago, so they've now set up a 3.6 mile detour. Bob told me later he wouldn't have done it if he knew how far it was. When we crossed the bridge across the parkway, it really wasn't that busy, we could have crossed it easily.After a pretty stiff climb, we got back to the AT proper, then to Bear Mountain. The Bear Mountain section is the most heavily used portion of the trail and there were hundreds of people there today, I guess because it was a holiday. The trail there is basically paved with stones including steps. But it is still very long and very steep. There is a lake and a park at the bottom where we had a lunch of burgers and beers. We planned to stop in Fort Montgomery so Tracey could go to the post office.

The day started out overcast and cool, probably good as we had a 550 ft climb after we crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge. The bridge is known to have nesting peregrine falcons and they can be aggressive, fortunately nobody got attacked although I did see one.
Later in the morning it became sunny and hot. I'd guess my water intake doubles for every 10° F rise temp. I'm not sure we got over 80F, but I sweated buckets all day. Still I felt really good. My knee didn't bother me too much, my legs were strong all day and my pack didn't hurt me too much despite having picked up several pounds of food last night.
We stopped for lunch at a nice deli that is right next to the trail. There were several other hikers there. We all had monster sandwiches even though we just bought food last night and probably should have eaten that instead to lighten our load. I just wish I had done what Slipper did and chugged a large Gatorade before we left as good water is scarce in NY.
Trail wasn't too tough after that early climb. Late in the afternoon when we were getting close to the campsite, Bob and I came up on Slipper stopped in the trail. There was a 3-foot copperhead right on the trail ahead. She said she almost stepped on it before she saw it. It wouldn't move so we had to walk around it.
After our usual dinner, I pulled out a surprise. I was tired of eating dehydrated hiker food so I bought a loaf of raisin bread, peanut butter and honey. I thought Slipper's eyes were going to bug out of her head. I offered to make her a sandwich that she at first she politely refused, but she had such a ravenous look on her face I burst out laughing. She didn't refuse a second time. The look on her face well eating that treat was utter bliss. I made one for myself and it was quite tasty. I'm very pleased with myself over that one.
I told the group I'm going to start early tomorrow and do 19 miles so I can be in Kent by Friday. I didn't really expect them to go with me but I think they're all going to try. Slipper doesn't usually hike that far and I know Bob's feet are hurting him. I really appreciate that they want us to stay together. If I do get out ahead, I'll probably find a place to stay for a day this weekend and let them catch up. It's going to rain anyway.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665816,"June 21, the longest day of the year, is designated as naked hiking day. We did not participate. Neither did anyone else we saw. Perhaps it is an urban myth.
We had some light rain last night, but it cleared out by morning. We were all out of camp by 6:30 a.m. I didn't really have the energy I had yesterday and the trail was unexpectedly rugged.
Water continues to be a problem. There are few sources and many of them are undrinkable due to contamination. We stopped for lunch at RPH shelter which was one of the nicest I've seen so far. I forgot to take a photo, but it's an enclosed building with bunks and a covered roof for the picnic area. Best, it had a stream nearby where we could soak our feet and get water, although it had an odd after taste. Probably not from our feet.
The trail got even tougher in the afternoon. It wasn't real steep or rocky, but it was narrow and there just weren't any easy stretches. The trail just beat us all to death. At the 15 mile mark we met up with a hiker who told us storms are moving in tomorrow morning. We got into town, had pizza and wings, and checked into a hotel. 
Declaring tomorrow a zero day was unanimous. We need to do laundry, visit the outfitter, and generally rest up. I won't make it to Kent in time to pick up my package, so I'll have to call the Post Office tomorrow and ask them to forward it up to Salisbury.
Sometime today I hit 400 miles hiked. I'm ready to get out of New York, the trail has been kind of tough, there's no water, its been hard to find camping sites, and there's trash everywhere. We hadn't seen any trail magic at all until today when somebody left some Gatorade in a cooler, boy was that nice.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665972,"We all took a zero day today. The idiot hiker we met on the trail told us thunderstorms would be moving in this morning, of course it never rained a drop. 
Still, we were so beat up from that day on the trail taking a day off was probably a good idea. We checked into the hotel, I took a shower and collapsed on the bed, waking up at 2:00 a.m. I realized I didn't have any clean clothes so I got some quarters from the front desk and did a load of laundry. Sign on the laundry room door says it gets locked at 9:00, but since it was open I went ahead anyway. I've been carrying three laundry pods around with me for a while. I texted the other hikers in case they wanted one. They're all trying to figure out why I was asking that at 3:00 in the morning.
After that we just hung around and rested up at the hotel. We made arrangements to slackpack on Friday. Slackpacking is where you make arrangements for your pack to be carried forward on the trail or for you to be driven somewhere then picked up so you don't have to carry all your stuff. This will be my first opportunity to try slack packing, get to see if it all it is cracked up to be.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665900,"We got dropped off about 6:45 a.m. The trail was easy and with little more than some rain gear, a little food and some water, the hike was as effortless as it comes. We covered 10 miles by lunch.
It began to rain pretty good as we prepared to get back on the trail, so I decided to try out my new rain pants. It only rained hard for about 20 minutes but they worked great. The pants didn't make me hot and sweaty like my jacket does and they dried out right away. When I was planning the trip, I really worried about rain. I didn't want to have to deal with wet clothes and sleeping gear, but so far rain has been very manageable. Getting water has been a far more difficult problem and it's not going to get a whole lot better over the next few days.
We did five more miles after lunch, then got picked up and were back to the hotel by 4:30 pm. We did 15 miles about 8 hours, double the pace of our last hike. Slackpacking is definitely the way to go. When we get to New Hampshire, Bob promised to slackpack us every day. His wife will drop us off and pick us up and we'll stay at his house overnight. He says she's already laying in supplies. Still seems a long ways off, but we'll reach Vermont in just 10 days.
We should be in Connecticut tomorrow. Going to rain for the next 4 or 5 days.
We saw a beaver at Nuclear Lake, so named because an explosion at an experimental lab in 1972 spattered plutonium into the lake and surrounding forest. Alleged safe now. No, the beaver did not have three eyes.","
",NY 22,"Jun 23, Fri",15
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665985,"We all went back to the diner this morning for one more plate of their great blueberry pancakes. By the time we'd walked back to the hotel, it was absolutely pouring rain, with more forecast for the next few days.
We spent the next hour brainstorming various plans to get around the weather as painlessly as possible. We finally got a tip from a shuttle driver about a B&B that is not listed in the guides, right near Kent, Connecticut. Miraculously, the host had openings for four hikers for four days. We got the shuttle driver to take us to Enterprise where we rented a car and drove up to the B&B.
The place is fabulous. The couple who live here have had the house in the family since it was built in 1967 and have been farming here since the late 18th century. The home is beautifully decorated and they have the garage all set up for hikers with tables, hooks for hanging and drying your gear, just everything we could want.
The rain had pretty much stopped by the time we had lunch in Kent so we decided to get some hiking in. This was an excellent idea as it really sets us up for the next couple of days. Using the B&B as a base and the rental car we can slackpack all the way to Massachusetts.
So what we did today is drive to our stopping point at the Connecticut state line. Bob and I start hiking south from there. Tracy and Melissa drive to where we stopped yesterday, park the car and start hiking north. When we met them halfway, they gave us the car keys. We hiked to the car, drive back to where we started and pick up Tracy and Melissa who had finished by then. Awesome.
We hiked the seven miles in about 3 hours and that finishes New York. The trail was pretty easy although it was very wet, muddy and humid from all the rain and we got hit with a short 10 minute shower after a couple hours. It definitely would have been nasty to camp in the wet woods.
We drove back to Kent, had some Chinese food, then back to the house for dessert courtesy of our host, and showers.
Bob is so thrilled with this strategy, he's talking about having a relative drive his truck down from New Hampshire so we can do the same thing through Massachusetts and Vermont. Melissa likes the idea too, but I can tell she was feeling a little guilty about it like we're cheating or something. Hey, as long as you walk the trail, and it doesn't matter which direction you do it, then you've hiked the AT.
The downside is you have to find a place to stay and whether that's a hotel or a B&B or a hostel, those cost money. Of course, once the weather clears up a little, we can still take advantage of campsites and shelters.
So a full day tomorrow with two tough climbs but empty packs and hopefully not much rain.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666036,"All done with New York, another state finished. Connecticut will be next, it is only about 50 miles of trail and we did a third of that today.
Tracy and Melissa dropped Bob and me off at 9:00 a.m., a bit of a late start. We had to start right off with the St John Ledges which was a bit of a climb, but not too bad. If the climb above Palmerton was a solid 8.5, this one was more like a 6.
The trail was tougher than it has been the past two days and Bob's feet are still hurting him, so we only made 5 miles in the first 3 hours. We decided to have lunch and fill up with water at the Mt Algo shelter. We met several hikers there including another Belgian, the third I met on the trip. I asked him if he knew any Claeys, he said he thought maybe he did.
Bob and I started putting on the miles after lunch. It was pretty warm and extremely humid. We had to do three pretty solid uphill hikes that left us soaked with sweat.
We met up with Slipper and AOG about 230 pm and got the car keys. They were far ahead of our pace, but as it turned out that's because their end of the trail was much easier than the side we started on. In the end, all four of us finished are the almost exactly the same time.
Rain was forecast today but it was mostly sunny until late afternoon when some dark clouds and thunder rolled in. We could actually see and hear it raining in the woods right next to us but we never got wet. Slipper and AOG were a little distressed to find out we came through dry because they got absolutely hammered by two downpours that soaked everything they had with them.
We went out for a bite, then back to the house for dessert and showers. Very likely it's going to rain tomorrow, so if we wake up and the weather is bad, we'll do some shopping, then maybe do a short hike in the afternoon if it clears. Tuesday looks even worse, unfortunately.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666077,"The weather's been pretty uncertain, forecast tells us anywhere from 50-90% chance of rain but we've often seen several hours of clear weather. 
The weather looked good enough this morning to go out, so we set up a quick 6 mile hike along what the map told us would be very easy trail. And it pretty much was, a nice level walk along the Housatonic River for almost the entirety. We finished quickly and had some thoughts of extending the hike five more miles, but some light rain moving in at the end pushed us to quit while we were ahead.
Good thing too, because by the time we finished lunch it started raining hard. The heavy rain continued into the evening and we even got some hail. We use the off time to do laundry, pick up groceries and grill cheeseburgers for dinner.
The forecast looks bad again for tomorrow, we'll just have to get up and see. With good weather we could be in Massachusetts in 2 days.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666134,"Thunder, lightning and rain all night. Or so i was told, I slept right through it.
We decided the weather looked ok enough to try for a full day. The woods were soaked from last night's storms, but it wasn't unpleasant at all, in fact it was rather lovely with water clinging to all the leaves and the streams running high. 
Mid-morning, i coukd hear the race cars running on the famed Lime Rock race track. Tracy told me the track was close but I didn't think it would be in use on a Tuesday morning. I watched the cars circle for a bit while i talked to Pinky, the girl I first met in Duncannon that I thought looked like Luann, the girl next door.
The trail continues to be pretty easy, few rocks, soft pine needles to walk on, not too many steep climbs. Given we are slack packing we really should be able to do 18 or 19 miles a day,  yet it took us 9 hours to hike just 14 today, probably because all took a long lunch together at the Pine Swamp Brook shelter (nicer than it sounds). We had light rain off and on through the morning but the afternoon was clear and not too warm.
When we got back to the house I had my packages waiting for me. Got the hat that Andrew and Alex gave me, and my new hiking shoes, finally. Travel day tomorrow as we relocate to Massachusetts.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666217,"Weird day. We dropped off Tracy and Melissa at the north end of the day's trail, then Bob and I had to drive back to Barby's because he'd overpaid her a considerable sum. She only deals in cash, so we went back and got it. It's already a 90-minute drive from the house to the starting point so by the time we did all that, Bob and I didn't get started till after 10:30.
My new shoes, however, are a dream. I raced down the trail doing the first 4.4 miles in less than 2 hours. Bob kept calling me a slave driver, but we quickly overcame our late start and ended up doing 14 miles in only about 8 hours. Easy trail mostly.
Lots of trail magic today. Starting out, we met a guy who thruhiked in 2021. He gave us some snacks, but the most interesting thing about him is he kept it daily journal of his hike then, when it was over, he downloaded the journal into Word and had it published as a glossy paperback with all his photos. Pretty cool. 
We picked up some Powerade in a cooler by the road shortly after, then ran into a guy who was cooking hot dogs for hikers with beer, watermelon and other snacks. 
Bob and Tracy hit their 1500 mile mark today. Bob wants to average 100 miles a week to the finish, faster than what we've been doing but a very reasonable pace. That will put us at Katahdin around August 15th, or about a week later than my originally projected date.
Had a pleasant dinner with Tracey's brother and friend at the end of the day. Long drive back, so we all went to bed late, but not before I showered and got to shave for the first time in about 2 weeks.

It can be like hiking up a running stream. There are lots of muddy stretches, often with standing water. All you can do is try to go around. The wet also makes the rocks slick. i'm glad I have new tread.
We went up Mt Race first today. Not a bad climb, the trail skirts the eastern edge of the mountain with a steep 2000 ft drop. The view is magnificent, but the Canadian fires gave us mostly haze today.
I ran into Julie/Chicken Wing here. I hadn't seen her since Wind Gap in Pennsylvania. She was with Marikka, the rumored third Belgian hiker. Marikka told me Claeys in Belgium is pronounced clahs.
We had to hike to the top of Mount Everett (2600 ft), then down the back along a very steep ridge called Jug End. That was really rough on my feet and knees. Then a five mile dash through a boggy area infested with clouds of mosquitoes. Fortunately, Melissa had warned me about it and I stopped to put on bug repellent before we got down there.
i was amazed to realize with my pack 20 pounds lighter and my having lost at least 20 pounds, my legs are carrying 40 pounds less weight than they were a month ago.

Traded partners today, i went with Tracey. He's much faster than me, so it was like hiking alone most of the day. That was a nice change really.
We finished almost an hour before Bob and Melissa and had to wait 90 minutes for them to pick us up. The mosquitoes were so bad we had to put on our rain jackets and zip them up tight.
Some hikers skip portions of trail that are uninteresting, too rugged or because of bad weather. They often say they'll ""do it later"" but mostly they don't. That's yellow blazing because you drive past. This bit in Mass is widely considered the ugliest stretch on the AT and a prime candidate for a yellow blaze.
Its been hard to maintain interest the last couple of days. It is just trail and miles with little other reason to be out here. Hikers warn that the monotony can get to you and that's what I'm feeling right now.

We only hiked 8 miles.

You do what you can to keep your feet dry, but that only lasts so long. Eventually, they get soaked, then it doesn't matter. You just walk right through the mud and puddles. All the streams were running high, we had to ford several of those through knee deep water. 
Not many other hikers on the trail. I suspect most headed to the nearest hostel or hotel to dry out. We did meet one couple drying out their stuff at a shelter. They looked miserable.

He was so happy at how great it worked for him that he kissed me on top of my head.
Unfortunately, because it was the 4th of July, virtually nothing in the town was open other than the convenience store. We bought some snacks and drinks and waited out another hard rain shower that blew by.

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666593,"We dropped off Tracy and Slipper on Cloudland Rd, then headed south for our start point. This part of Vermont is somewhat remote with few road crossings and the only one available for 10 miles in either direction turned out to be impassable. 
We got within 1.5 miles of the trail and probably should have just parked the truck and walked in, but Bob didn't want to park on the narrow road. Instead, we spent two hours driving up various dirt roads, trying to find a route in. Finally a local told us what we already knew, there just isn't any good way to get up there. The best we could manage was a road crossing that was only six miles from our start.
It got worse from there. We also found out that central Vermont got four inches of rain last night, causing flooding and washing out the roads. A large mudslide forced the closure of Vermont 4,  the main road between us and the southern part of the state.
We had a beautiful sunny day, but getting only six miles in left me pretty morose. The irony is if we had just hiked the trail, we'd probably be okay other than maybe some high water stream crossings. But committed to driving back and forth to the trailheads has us stymied. We can probably still do it but it would require a longish detour each of the next 2-3 days.
The other hikers are talking about just punting on Vermont and heading east into New Hampshire. That pretty much defeats the purpose of the rental house since Bob only lives an hour from here.
Time is becoming a factor. It is probably 30 days minimum from here to Katahdin, meaning I'd get there no sooner than August 8th, not accounting for off days and bad weather. Finishing Vermont will take another 8 days. 
The kids will be gone by the 10th. I can probably manage to get the house and dogs looked after for a week, maybe two at the outside but no more than that. I've known for some time I simply would not have time to finish the southern leg this year. I was, however, kicking around the idea of hiking south until October 1 which would probably be enough for me to finish Virginia, or roughly half the southern AT. But if I can't finish the northern trail until late August, that's probably not doable either.
I'll just have to do what it takes to reach the northern terminus at Mount Katahdin, and then figure out the rest after that.

Late in the day, we find out our house has no running water. Either the pump or well failed. The management company found us another rental but it is smaller. Plus, Bob invited Chance, a hiker we'd met a few times and last seen in Kent, to stay with us, so it is a bit crowded.

Today would be a short hike, 14 miles, but the route also goes over two mountains, Cube (2900') and Smarts (3200').
It only took two hours to reach the top of Mt Cube. The views were terrific and the higher elevations are nice, fewer bugs with pine trees, rocks and moss everywhere, just like I thought New Hampshire would look. The water level in the streams had definitely gone down; we had to wade across a few but it wasn't bad at all and the trail wasn't nearly as muddy as I expected, at least at first.
It all went downhill from there literally and figuratively. The saddle between the two mountains was pretty rugged and very muddy. At one point I sank almost to my knees in mud while crossing what looked to be a shallow puddle. A thunderstorm blew in about 4:00 p.m. and dumped hard rain on us for 10 or 15 minutes. It also made the rocks wet and slippery, all the worse since most of our remaining hike was going to be sharply downhill.
I slipped and fell first, mostly because of my weak right knee. I was just standing talking to Bob and my left foot slipped causing my right knee to bend more than it can take. The funny thing is, it doesn't hurt to walk on it but I can't bend it very much without excruciating pain. Anyway that left me lying in the middle of the trail. Bob had to help me up.
Bob fell next. I just caught up with him after falling behind a bit when whoops his feet shot out, poles went flying, snd he was quickly flat on his back in the mud, but luckily unhurt.
Then it happened to me. We were only a couple hundred yards from the parking lot when I went down hard on my side, so fast I'm not even sure how it happened. But now I was covered in mud from my ankle to my shoulder. My thigh landed on a rock; I'll probably end up with a nasty bruise but it's not bad.
Bob and I washed some of the mud off in the creek by the parking lot before climbing into the truck for the ride home. It was 7:30 p.m. by the time we came off the trail. It took us two hours to do the first 3.5 miles, then over 8 hours to hike the next 10.5 miles. Nobody expected a tough day like that one.
Moving day tomorrow, we will be headed to Bob's place in NH. 
Flooding has done an unbelievable amount of damage to Vermont; they say it's the worst since 1927, literally the flood of the century. Multiple roads and bridges have been washed out, including some major ones. We heard from several hikers who were trapped in shelters by high water. The local AT commission has ordered all the hikers off the trail. They had to go shelter to shelter through the state, rescuing stranded hikers or just telling them to head to the nearest town.
More heavy rain is forecast for this weekend. We are about to climb Mt Moosilauke, a serious test and a prelude for the Presidential Range in the White Mountains. I'm already worried about my ability to handle that with my bad knee, trying to make those climbs in a rainstorm is potentially life-threatening. Maine is flooded too, and we got dumped on today, seems like we can't stick our heads out the door without a thundercloud rolling in.
Slipper has decided to leave the trail. She didn't go out with us today. Tomorrow, she'll go to the bus station and make her way home. I think her feet and knees just hurt too much. I will miss her; she was literate and interesting.
Saw two deer today.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666801,"Busy morning, had to pack everything up, then drop Slipper off at the bus station and say our goodbyes. Bob was going to drop Tracy and me off so we could hike the 10-mile run up to the base of Mt Moosilauke, then take all our gear and supplies to his house. Unfortunately, we took Slipper to the wrong station and we had to go back and try sgain. With all the back and forth, we forgot to go to the post office and pick up John's package. Sorry John, will try again tomorrow.
By the time we got to the trail, it was 11 am. The first 2 miles was a complete mudhole, but it got better after that and the miles went pretty fast. The trail still had its muddy sections and we had to cross Mt Mist (2300'), but it wasn't too bad and we were done by 4:00 pm.
Supposed to go over Mt Moosilauke tomorrow, but there's a nasty storm blowing right now. We could see Moosilauke from the trail this afternoon and it looks monstrous at 4800 feet.
At Bob's house tonight. Five people, four dogs, two bedrooms.
Saw one red eft and a deer today.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666838,"With Bob's wife Diane able to drop us off, the three of us can now hike in the same direction. 
Multiple hikers, including Bob, recommended hiking Moosilauke southbound as the north face of the mountain is very steep and much easier to hike going up rather than down.
The ascent was nearly vertical in parts, very rocky and very slick. It rained last night and everything was wet, but I doubt this path is ever dry. The trail is slippery, the rocks are slippery, the roots are slippery, even the trees are slippery. All you can do is be very careful, take your time, and not take chances. Bob works search and rescue in this area and as we were going up he told us about the injured and dead hikers they've had to pull out of here. Charming.
After a couple hours of climbing with hands and feet, the trail leveled out a bit. It took about 4 hours to reach the summit which is above tree line. Rock cairns are built to show the trail as there are no trees to put blazes on. There were plenty of other hikers up there, apparently there is a road that leads to a trail that is only 40 min from the top. The view was amazing; we were able to see Mt Washington in the distance. 
The summit was windy, cold and at times foggy. It was a warning to be prepared for the climbs over the next week. I'm glad to have the box Paige sent me with my winter clothing.
The descent wasn't nearly as steep, but it was wet and tricky enough, at least for the first hour or so. I had a couple of close calls but eventually the trail leveled out a bit and became just a long slow walk down. 
We are now officially in the White Mountains. I was a little worried about my right knee,  but I seemed to do okay today. Many of the remaining mountains are higher than Moosilauke, but i don't know if any are steeper.
Saw five wild turkeys today.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666897,"Planned a 16 mile hike today. Nobody really liked the idea, but there are very few trail crossings that would allow us to shorten the day.
We got up late, left late, then went to the wrong trailhead. Where we did finally park turned out to be a mile from the trail. We didn't actually start hiking until 930 am.
I had a bad feeling about the whole thing from the start. I almost told Bob and Tracy to go ahead and I would sit this one out. I should have listened.
The trail was fairly rugged and rocky with sections steep enough to require stairs and handholds cut into the rock. All of it was wet and slippery.
Made it to the Lonesome Lake Hut by noon. The huts are hostels maintained by the AMC and are quite popular in the summer. They aren't cheap, up to $200 a night for a bunk and meals, assuming they have space. 
By 3 pm, I'd crossed both peaks of Mt Kinsman. But that left 10 miles to go. It would be midnight before I'd reach the truck at the current pace. The back side of Kinsman was even steeper than the side I'd already climbed, so that was going to be really slow hiking.
Tracy had already descended Kinsman and was probably a mile ahead. Bob was maybe a half mile behind me. I texted him and told him we needed an exit plan, we just weren't going to make it. No way I'm hiking this mountain in the dark.
Bob wanted to hike down to a side trail about 3.5 miles down, then to a road another 3-4 miles from there. I was pretty sure we couldn't do that before nightfall. I turned around and climbed back up Kinsman to meet Bob. We spent 30 min arguing the options, but I already knew I was not going any further. Bob decided to press on and I turned back the way we came. 
I didn't like doing that, but I'd felt wrong about this hike from the start and it was time to listen to what my gut was telling me. I made the six miles down in only 3 hours, the last half hour in rain and it was dark enough by then I had to use my hat light. I was so relieved to get out before it got really dark. I was pretty worried about Tracy and Bob, they did in fact take about an hour longer to reach the road and it was already dark and rainy in the woods when I got out. Diane picked them up, then they came and got me.
We got word this morning a hiker fell while night hiking the same trail on Kinsman, was seriously injured and had to be rescued. Bob said he saw snow on his way down, I wasn't sure I believed him until the rescue team said the same thing.
I may be done. Off today, it is raining hard and more is expected in the next week. The difficulty of the trail doesn't worry me that much, but conditions are terrible and while I was initially very glad not to have to hike the Whites solo, disagreements like yesterday make me question whether we are making the best decisions.
I'll take today to consider my options. I really would like to reach the top of Mt Washington, but I just don't know anymore. Tracy says he might be done, too. After 1800 miles, he's had enough and is thinking about finishing next year.
Saw one deer today.","
",Flume State Park,"Jul 15, Sat",13
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666946,"Tracy decided today to end his thruhike after 1800 miles. Once he announced his decision to end his hike, so did I.
The trail conditions through what is probably the most difficult stretch have been very poor. Looking ahead, we see little other than more bad weather and today we got word that much of the trail through Maine is deemed impassable.
Am I disappointed? Well, of course. I wanted to hike the entire trail and when that began to look out of reach, I set my goal on reaching Katahdin, then I thought I might at least scale Mt Washington. Looks like Mt Kinsman is as far as I get.
But it was a great adventure all the same. I hiked over 600 miles, more than half of it solo. It was a terrific challenge and I managed to accomplish more than I'd ever thought possible. My dream of hiking the AT was never dependent on successfully finishing it; I knew up front the odds of success were poor. The dream was just getting out here and actually doing it for 56 days.
I think my planning and preparation was pretty good. But one thing i couldn't control was awful weather. When you hike the AT, you have to expect rain, mud, bugs and worse, but floods that shut down entire states, it is hard to anticipate that. It is ironic the one of the reasons I chose to flip flop hike was the expectation I'd have the best possible weather. Well, that didn't happen.
I'm sure there are hikers out there right now that are somehow going to manage to get through this mess. But I just don't have that kind of margin of error. 
I've been away long enough. I miss my girls, my house, my dogs and my friends. I have a business to run. It was worth postponing real life for two months to do this, but at some point you do have to go back.
Everyone has been so supportive. Thank you so much for that. But I also realized so many of you worried every day something was going to happen to me. I won't be doing that to you any longer, which I'm sure is a relief.
I will see you all soon.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668175,"A really good start. Flight to DC was on time, bought lunch and an extra sandwich for dinner at the train station and got to Harpers Ferry about 5:00 pm. I bought a couple things at the Outfitters and was on the trail by 6:00.I only had four miles to go to the campsite but I didn't know when it would get dark. It would be light until after 9:00 pm back in June but it's 2 months later now.The trail was pretty easy so I made very good time and got to the campsite about 7:30.  Good thing because it started getting dark about eight and was pitch black by 8:30 pm. There's another guy here from Maryland so we got to sit down and chat quite a bit. Big day tomorrow, 16 mies, so will see if my trail legs are still good after a month offSaw one deer.","

Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668199,"I was pretty happy to be able to get that first four miles in last night. Only four miles but it's enough to cut the hike to Front Royal from four days to three.
Pretty easy trail in the morning and I made good time. I met Dan again at the Blackburn Trail Center where we had lunch. The trail got tougher in the afternoon as I'm now getting into the Roller Coaster. That's a section notorious for a bunch of ups and downs. They mostly arent steep or very high, but they do wear on you.
Mid afternoon, I encountered a rattlesnake. I'd never seen one before. It was about 2 ft up the trail on the left side, I stepped back as soon as I saw and heard it, but before I knew really what it was. The rattle was more of a high pitched whine so my first thought was I had stirred up a nest of hornets or something. Even after I could see it was a snake, I wasn't sure it was a rattlesnake until I could see the rattle. I snapped a couple of photos, but the light wasn't very good. The white rattle is easy to see though.
About a mile before I got to my campsite there's a trailhead and a guy named Fresh Ground and was doing Trail Magic. He gave me some Gatorade, filled up my water bottles and i ate several slices of watermelon. Dan was there too. I guess he's got problems at work so he's going to have to cut his hike short and go home tonight instead of tomorrow. 
Going to be a tough day tomorrow. Long miles and I got to fight the Roller Coaster. But after that it's a short jog to Front Royal and I'll get a night in a hotel or hostel.

",Bears Den Rocks campsite,"Aug 19, Sat",17
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668239,"Long hike today and most of it will be through Roller Coaster, an infamous stretch known for a close-spaced series of seven up and down ridges. I'd already gone over the first one the day before, but wasn't too certain my legs would hold out long enough to get to the Whiskey Hollow shelter, 18 miles away. I wanted to do that so I'd only have 15 miles into Front Royal on Monday where i can get a night in a hostel. 
I needn't have worried. There were two relatively high and steep ridges but mostly it wasn't anything more difficult than what I'd seen in Pennsylvania and New York. I think this is notable in Virginia because most of the trail here is nice hard packed dirt with few rocks and mostly very level. Best, it is dry which is nice after a month iof slogging through mud with 2 inches of standing water.
Maybe too dry, it's been very difficult to find water. I wasn't sure I could make the last climb over Sky Mountain with barely a liter of water. Fortunately, I ran into some high school kids who had a cooler full on their car and they show up a water bottle for me and I wouldn't have made it. 
Also fortunate there was a water source near the shelter. it wasn't much, basically a pool 2 inches deep and 3 ft wide but it was enough. Both guides caution that the water in that creek is not good, so I both filtered it and used chemicals. With few other sources there's not much else you can do. I was so hot and thirsty I drank two liters before dinner.
Pretty happy with today looking forward to tomorrow, then a shower and a night in a bed.Nobody at the shelter tonight except me and four deer.","
",Whiskey Hollow shelter,"Aug 20, Sun",18
Toadkiller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668244,"it was really hot last night, I didn't use either quilt but I still slept pretty well. I was kind of slow getting out of camp, didn't leave until 8:00 a.m. Kind of dumb, you'd think I would want to hurry knowing that I have shower and solid dinner waiting for me the end of the day.
The hiking was pretty easy for the most part with just the one steep climb out of Manassas Gap. But it was pretty hot and it was hard to find water. I got some out of the creek where I stopped to have lunch,  but that water didn't look very good and didn't taste very good either. On the final climb before the long slow descent into Front Royal I came to the Denton shelter that thankfully had a spring that hadn't quite gone dry yet. That was some nice clear cold water. I dumped out the water i was carrying and filled up out of the spring, but not before drinking about a liter.
I burned up the trail from there, covering the last 5 miles in only a little over 2 hours. The hostel is terrific, it's a really nice bed and breakfast run by a couple of former through hikers. The B&B folks are probably paying $150 a night, they only charge us hikers $40. They took me out for one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life along with a hot fudge custard sundae.
All things considered I've had 4 days of pretty good hiking and I've decided that's enough. I'm going home. I didn't like how my hike ended in New Hampshire. They always tell you not to quit on a bad day. Now I know I didn't quit because of the weather or my co-workers or because of the White Mountains. I stopped because i just didnt want to walk 15 miles a day anymore. That became very apparent after only a day or two on this trip. I'm glad I gave it a second chance because that's what I wanted to know. 700 miles is enough.
I'll leave the door open if Bob and Tracy want to finish their hike next year. I could just do Vermont which is maybe 10 days, but I don't know if I would commit to a month long trip through Maine. Vermont would give me an 800 mile line from Mount Kinsman in New Hampshire to Front Royal, Virginia.
Thanks for all your well wishes and support. I'll be back in Houston Tuesday night ready for the pool and the cold drink.Saw two deer, a doe and a baby buck.","
