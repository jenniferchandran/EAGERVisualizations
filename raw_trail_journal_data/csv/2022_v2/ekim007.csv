ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647723,"So I'm leaving for Atlanta later this week.  Looking to slack the approach trail maybe on Friday if timing works out - much to do and seemingly no time to do it.  This trip came about on a bit of a whim about six weeks ago, so I am both physically and mentally somewhat underprepared for this, so will be taking the first few weeks slow and steady.  I'm not wholly unfamiliar with the Trail - I hiked the Whites as a youth, and have lived in Massachusetts for the last few years, so I have some confidence, but would like to be a month into the hike sooner rather than later.  Looking forward to meeting as many of you as possible, and can't wait to get started.",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Tue",0
ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647730,"So, this is entry two - I’m guessing I should discuss how much I’ve overpacked and what will I do - but I’ve lived my life so far by the mantra that things will work out - I might end up needing all the cold weather gear I’ve packed, or I might dump it at the earliest opportunity (until the Whites).  Thing is, it doesn’t matter.  Just keep doing what is right for you, and everything works out.  For me, most times, I end up not necessarily where I expected to be, but I end up exactly where I’m supposed to be…",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Tue",0
ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647759,"So it is the day before I leave and start this bit of fun.  I'm admittedly nervous - pretty much the same butterflies and knots I had before starting the various military schools I attended.  I'm hoping to see or at least hear some of the Ranger candidates during their Mountain Phase along the TVD.  Worried about things like pack weight, doing a respectful yet comfortable number of miles the first few weeks, hoping i have enough of the right gear - have plenty of gear, just not sure it is all the right gear, and just looking forward to getting the first few weeks in the rear view mirror. Would be remiss to not mention all the help and support i've received from my wife and family - thank you all very much!",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Wed",0
ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647781,"So travel day is finally here - I'm ready to go, but so ill-prepared for the trail.  Like I've said before though, things generally will always work out - it may not be in quite the way you expect, but they will work out.  I've got a few knots in my stomach, and I'm dreading opening the box I pre-sent with all of my gear, weighing in at just around 50 pounds. Extra food and winter clothing make up the added weight, but I still feel like I've overpacked, especially in the first aid department, which is something I will not feel too comfortable compromising on.  Let's see how that plays out once I've humped a few miles.  Thanks to my wife and girls for helping me out on this.  And so it begins...",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Thu",0
ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647961,"Today I completed the Approach Trail to the start of the Appalachian Trail, which is about 9 miles that don’t officially “count” as miles on the Trail itself.  Due to logistics, I did this in reverse, which meant my day ended with  670 step stone walk up the Amicalola Falls.  Hard, but fun.  Was also able to work out some other logistical issues that had me a bit stressed, so that went well.  For those of you looking for a shuttle driver in North Georgia, look up Frank Huggins (four o four) two eight one six six eight zero. He is fantastic and will  do virtually anything  he can to help you out.  Final note - backpacks are heavy 🥲.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Fri",0
ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647963,"so I will not be posting every day, but I will try to keep this updated.  I think I only walked around seven miles of the actual trail today. I did take a six mile round trip detour to see Camp Merrill, where I attended Ranger School in the  early 90’s.  Much has changed, yet a great deal was eerily familiar.  There is a fence now, so access is restricted, but I was able to hop inside a revisit the room they bring all new recruits to.  Not sure it was worth an extra six miles, but glad I did it.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Sat",0
ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647964,"Today was tough.   Not so much in the hiking itself, although for reasons I will refer to later, I only made it about three miles today.  Things I learned:1.  Stop and take your pack off now and then, and soak you feet in a river.  Back in the Army days, that pack went on and stayed on your back until mission accomplished.  There is no mission here.2.  Use your walking sticks.  Too many times I found myself mimicking holding an M4 or an M16 at the ready.  Not helpful anymore.3. It’s okay for things to dangle off your pack.  Again, in the Army, if it wasn’t a Light Antitank Weapon, M60 tripod or extra ammunition, then all  your stuff went in your ruck or on your ALICE gear.  Now, just strap that stuff on as best you can and move out.4.now the reason for the delay - it seems not all Walgreens/CVS stores in North Georgia carry every kind of medication, so I can’t just pop in and ask for a refill.  I’ve researched Walgreens up the trail and now know to make the request about a week in advance - yes, the trail does go through or near many towns.  Meanwhile, while I wait I’m spending the night in luxury at the Dahlonega Mountain in.  Living the life!",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Sun",0
ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648068,"Yesterday I finished Blood Mountain- didn’t realize I was on Blood Mountain until I hit the Blood Mountain shelter. Not at all what I was expecting, but made me a bit thrilled that I was finishing one of the toughest mountains in Georgia.  Got to Neel Gap after dark, so finagled a ride back to Dahlonega yet again for the night - this town is a trap!!  Heard and saw a number of Army Blackhawk helicopters yesterday - made me miss my many helo jumps, but not sure I have the stomach for it anymore.I’m posting on Facebook as well, probably more than TJs, but will keep this as updated as possible.Just keep walking.","Wood Gap

ekim007,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649845,"hi everyone,im still hiking, but no longer posting on Trailjournals - it is just too cumbersome compared to Facebook.  For those interested in following, my Facebook entries deal solely withe the trail - the page is Michael Horner, and the photo is me with the cowboy hat and sunglasses.  Just keep walking.Mike",,View Entry,"Apr 29, Fri",0
