Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646251,"Hi,
 My name is Rob Potvin and my trail name is Westy. I plan to through hike the Appalachian Trail starting on February 9th. 
I completed a through hike in 2016 so I pretty much know what I’m getting myself into. 
I'm sure many of you are wondering why I would ever want to through hike a second time. Sometimes I wonder that myself. It isn't that it was easy the first time or that I don’t remember all the times I wanted to quit and only my stubbornness kept me going. I guess the good times outweighed the bad or at least I remember the good times more vividly than the bad. There was much of the trail that I didn’t fully appreciate the first time which I want to re-experience. In 2016 I spent too much time just trying to get from one place to the next and not enjoying the journey. Don't think I didn’t experience a whole lot the first time. I clearly remember the difficulty of the ups and downs, the heat and cold, the drenching rain, the sloshing through mud and the hiding behind rocks to get out of the wind. I also remember the friendships I made, the stunning views, the quiet forests, the brilliant skies and the roaring waterfalls. All those things I’ll for sure never forget. But, strangely, I want to experience them again. Not to dwell on the difficulties but to savor the thrill of overcoming them and to relive the incredible feelings of achievement I felt almost every day. 
There are also a few things I didn’t accomplish the first time around that I want to this time. My first through hike was a flip flop and, although every bit as much a through hike as any other way, I did miss the exuberance and pure joy of finishing my hike at the summit of Katahdin. So this time I will do an end to end through hike. 
I also didn’t participate as fully in the social aspects of the trail as I should have. I didn’t stay up late enough many nights to sit around a campfire with other hikers. I stayed in hostel bunk houses working on my journal and resting many nights when other, albeit younger, hikers were out  celebrating life at a local pub. I didn’t write down the names of many of the through hikers I met along the way or spend the time and effort to get to know them better. This time I know my body doesn’t require that much more rest than the youngsters on the trail and that I don’t have to keep moving on at the exclusion of stopping and sharing  a few moments with others. This time I already have a journal record of a day by day through hike so I don’t have to report on every mountain I climb or every rainstorm I endure. I plan to simply report where I am, how I'm doing and any special experiences when I have the time to do so without impacting my ability to get out and have fun with other hikers.
Logistically I’m changing a few things this time around. My wife Kathy will still support me by meeting me periodically but this time I’ll hike the first six weeks unsupported and she’ll meet me in better weather and prettier places. She loves to camp and day-hike so she’ll meet me where she can really enjoy those activities. Places like the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, The Blue Ridge Mountains, The Green Mountains, the Whites in New Hampshire and the beauty of the State of Maine. 
I also plan on taking less time to through hike this time. Last time it took me seven months this time I plan on six. I was pretty lazy (well, maybe more cautious than lazy) the first time, taking more zeros than necessary because I wasn’t’t sure how my body would hold up. This time, even though I am six years older (I’ll be 74 in April), I know what I can and can’t handle far better. I also have better rain gear, a warmer sleeping quilt and a nearly waterproof backpack so I don’t have as much of a mental excuse for not leaving towns or hostels on cold and stormy days.
So, for those of you who followed my journal (trailjournals.com/westy) last time, welcome back. For those that didn’t, you are invited to share my journey. You won’t get daily update (at least most of you won’t; I will text my family every day to let them know how i am doing) but I will try to write every time I am in a town or hostel, so long as it doesn’t interfere too much with socializing, letting you know what's going on and what wonderful or miserable experiences I have had.

Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646338,"Hello again,
Today I’ll tell you about how I am preparing for my upcoming thru hike. 
You might think I walk twenty miles a day or do dozens of squat thrusts and deep knee bends every day to get ready to do this hike. The truth is that all I do is walk and not that many miles. I average about five miles a day. Some on sidewalks in the neighborhood and some on hiking trails near where I live. What somebody told me early on during my first thru hike is that “you don’t get in shape for the AT, the AT gets you in shape”. This really is true. By starting out with 8  mile days and gradually increasing to 12 then, eventually to 15 0r 20 miles a day. This way I will gradually build up my strength and endurance. That’s good because to finish my thru hike in less than seven months I will need to average about 80 miles a week.
I’ve also developed a very detailed spreadsheet that lists where I will hike to and from each day, the number of miles I’ll cover and the number of hours it will take. As I mentioned above, I plan to start out with short days and stretch them out as I get stronger. My spreadsheet also lists where I will pick up mail drops (food and toiletries mailed from home), and where I will take zero days (days when I don’t hike) to rest, journal and pig out at local restaurants. I will zero about once a week; always at a town or hostel. It  makes no sense to me to zero in my tent in the wilderness where there is no plumbing, electricity, internet, hamburgers, beer and ice cream.
I’ve already bought most of the non perishable meals for my mail drops. For breakfast I’ll eat freeze dried meals; either granola, milk and blueberries or scrambled eggs and bacon. For lunch I’m planning a concoction of powdered milk, powdered peanut butter, two packets Carnation Chocolate Breakfast Essentials and water. For supper I will usually eat freeze dried meals. My favorite brand is Mountain House and I will eat a package with a serving for three every evening when I’m on the trail. For snacks I will eat protein bars and Snickers bars. On my last thru hike I lost 30 pounds the first four weeks. Everyone looses weight on a thru hike because thru hikers burn five or six thousand calories a day. I will lose some weight this time as well but I will do what I can not to loose so many pounds so quickly. Last time I didn’t get a “trail appetite” until two or three weeks on the trail and for the first week or two I was so tired by the time I got to camp that I sometimes didn’t even bother to cook a meal. This time I will eat as many calories as I can carry every day even if I’m tired or don’t feel hungry. 
I will probably write a couple more blogs on this journal site before actually starting my hike. After that I’ll write when I have power for my cell phone, access to the internet and something interesting to write about. I’ll try to blog every 6 or 7 days.

Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646373,"I’d like to tell you about some of the gear I will use on my thru hike.
Much of what I carry will be from my first thru hike in 2016. This includes an Enlightened Equipment 30 degree down quilt, a Therm-a-Rest Neo Air Lite sleeping pad and a Zpacks Duplex two person tent. I’ll also use the same SteriPEN UV water purifier,  Nalgene Ultralite Wide-Mouth 32 ounce water bottles, Hyperlite Mountain Gear stuff sack pillow and Black Diamond trekking poles.
I’ve changed my backpack from a ULA Equipment Ohm 2.0 to a Hyperlite Mountain Gear 4400 Windrider. This new one has more volume and is much more water resistant. My cooking system has also been upgraded. Last time I used an alcohol burner to boil water. I’ve switched to a MSR Jetboil MiniMo stove that utilizes a fuel canister with a 80/20 blend of isobutane and propane. This system is about 6 ounces heavier but brings water to a boil much quicker is also easier to use.
Since I am starting earlier in the year than last time, February 9th instead of March 15th, I will be carrying a warmer sleeping system for the first 4 to 6 weeks. This new system includes a Katabatic Gear 15 degree sleeping quilt and a Therm-a-Rest X-therm sleeping pad with twice the R value of my old pad. I’ll carry these until around April 1st when I switch back to my original sleep system. I will also be carrying much warmer down mittens, a merino wool neck gaiter and a pair of Kahtoola Microspikes.
You’ll notice that I am carrying a sleeping quilt not sleeping bag. A sleeping quilt is three sided so it doesn’t wrap completely around my body. Somebody figured out that the insulation (in my case down feathers) under a body is crushed and provides little if any warmth. Since weight is so important to backpackers, they simply eliminated that part of the sleeping bag.  
I’ve also added a couple of “convenience” items that, while increasing my pack weight a little, will make my life on the trail easier. The first is a Therm-a Rest NeoAir mini air pump, powered by two AAA batteries, that will inflate my sleeping pad. This amazing little device weighs only 4.3 ounces (with batteries) and will relieve me of the nightly ritual of inflating my pad with lung power. I will also carry an 8 ounce Gossamer Gear umbrella that will attach to the shoulder straps of my backpack and keep rain and sun off of me while hiking. These have become very popular with through hikers in the last two or three years so I think it’s worth giving it a try.
The weight that I gained on these two convenience items is more than made up by the change I made in camp/shower shoes. I replaced my Croc’s with super lightweight booties made out of neoprene and nylon.
One safety item I’ve added is a Garmin InReach MiniGPS Satellite Communicator. This super small, rugged and lightweight (3 1/2 ounce) devise has an SOS button that gives me instant access to a Garmin search and rescue coordination team should an emergency occur. It also has preset messages (like “starting out for the day” or “just checking in”) that can be sent to pre-selected family and friends at the touch of a button. Since it works on a worldwide satellite system these messages will be sent even when there is no cell phone coverage. These messages will also send my location which will show up on a mapping app so recipients can use to track my progress in real time.
I have five pair of Saucony trail runners; two pair of Peregrine 7’s and three pair of Peregrine 8’s for my trip. I also splurged and upgraded my down jacket from a Patagonia down sweater to an Enlightened Equipment Torrid Apex jacket. It is warmer, packs smaller and weighs much less. The only disadvantage is that the outer fabric will tear much easier so I will just have to be careful to stay out of briar patches.
That’s it for now. I may write one more pre-hike journal entry to share my journalling plan between now and February 9th.

Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646483,"Hello again,
I am starting my hike on February 9th which pretty much assures that I will encounter much colder weather for the first several weeks than I did on my previous hike. I expect many nights will get to the low teens or single digits and some days may not get out of the 20’s. I will certainly see freezing rain and snow at some point and the trail will probably be icy many days when I am hiking. Especially at higher elevations.
To deal with these conditions I’ve had to look at all my gear and decide what needed upgrading or adding. Here is what I decided to do.
For sleeping, as I mentioned in an earlier journal, I had to really beef up my gear. I upgraded my sleeping quilt from a 30 degree to a 15 degree rating. I also improved my sleeping pad (air mattress) from a Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Xlite with a 4.2 R value to a Therm-A Rest XTherm with a 6.9 R value. I tried out both of these new purchases on my back porch on a night when the temperature got down to 12 degrees and, while I wasn’t exactly toasty warm, I was able to sleep through the night without being bothered by the cold.
To deal with ice and snow on the trail I’ve added Kahtoola MICROspikes and matching gaiters. I also upgraded my Dirty Girl foot gaiters to Kahtoola INSTAgaiters which are better at keeping snow out of my trail runners. If a serious winter storm dumps a foot of snow in the mountains of Georgia I will just have to hunker down someplace until it melts a bit. 
An upgrade to my cooking system was also driven by colder weather. I switched to a Jetboil MiniMo. This system boils water twice as fast as my alcohol burner. That’s important because waiting for water to boil in freezing temperatures is no fun at all. 
All of these changes increased the weight of my backpack by more than two pounds so, except for the Jetboil cook system, I’ll revert back to my older equipment in mid April when the weather starts to heat up. Shedding these pounds along with much of my other cold weather gear is something I am already looking forward to.

Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646990,"Time to bring you up to date on my through hike. 
First and foremost, I am off the trail and will not be returning. I got off of the trail at Neel Gap when I started experiencing strange trembling of my lips and severe light headedness. I really thought something was wrong with my heart and, as quickly as I could, headed to the emergency room in Dahlonega, Georgia. 
Since I had checked in to the ER thinking my heart was the issue and also because of my long history with heart disease, they investigated that and discovered that one of the leads to my pacemaker might be loose or faulty.
They also did blood tests which revealed that I was experiencing rhabdomyolysis which is often caused by unaccustomed and strenuous exercise. This was much more likely to the real cause of my symptoms.
Rhabdomyolysis can be pretty serious and have long term consequences. Having a faulty pacemaker is not so good either. Both of these can be treated but not while traipsing up and down mountains. So, at the advise of the doctors at the hospital and the strong encouragement of my family, I got off the trail and headed home. 
I did learn a few important things during my short time on the trail. 
The first thing I learned was that the mountains in southern Georgia were taller, steeper and altogether much more difficult than during my previous hike. This is possibly due to global warming and seal level changes but most likely to me being older and my body much less capable of meeting the challenges of long distance hiking.
The second thing I learned, or relearned, is the incredible camaraderie that exists along the AT. I met some truly exceptional people along the trail. I will miss them very much. 
Thirdly, I learned that my long distance hiking days are  pretty much over. Understanding this will help me let go of the AT or any other really long trail and get on with new and more age appropriate pursuits. 
Thanks to all who were rooting me on!
