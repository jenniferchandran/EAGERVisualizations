Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616763,"I retired the end of 2017 and enjoy travel, hiking, gardening, scuba diving, and snorkeling.  I consider myself to be a fairly physically active person, but am overweight (working at that).  I did my 1st attempt at a thru-hike of the AT in 2014 and hiked 554 miles north from Springer, having to take a month off before going through the Smokies due to a high left Achilles injury.  On my 2nd attempt (in 2018) that left Achilles continued to bother me and I never was able to get comfortable/ ""get my trail legs""/ increase my daily mileage.  In 2018, I hiked about 1/3 of the way through the Smokies and turned around and hiked back to Fontana Dam and called it quits (hiked total of about 200 miles that year).  After that my left Achilles tendonitis/ bursitis persisted, flaring up on and off until late April, 2019 when a stool I was standing on at home flipped out from under me, I fell, and I ruptured my left Achilles tendon.  I underwent surgical repair on 5/30/19 and was placed in a splint and now am non-weight bearing on that leg/ foot.
Picture is from 6/4/19 - surgical dressing and splint.
So --- here I go again.  Still have that ""white blaze fever"".  Preliminary plan is to start a 3rd attempt at an AT thru-hike early in 2021.  A lot of variables to consider between now and then - 1st will be my recovery from my Achilles surgery.  More to follow.",,View Entry,"Jun 19, Wed",0
Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616876,"I went to see my orthopedist for my 1st post-op follow-up visit 2 days ago.  He removed my splint and surgical dressing, then removed about 18-20 skin staples from a 7-8” long J shaped incision down my lower Achilles area and J hooked behind my left heel (incision looked clean and fairly well healed before he put cast on - that was nice to see, although I didn’t expect that long an incision). Then 9 steri-strips placed across incision, lower leg/ ankle/ foot wrapped in “felt”, and fiberglass cast put on.  Picture is of my new cast.
My orthopedist said he placed 4 “absorbable”, non metallic screws thru my Achilles and into my calcaneous (heel) to hold the Achilles in place.  He wants me non-weight bearing on my left foot/ leg for another month until I follow-up w/ him again on Tuesday, 7/16.  
Then supposed to be in a ""boot"" for a month, then physical therapy.  My orthopedist says he thinks I should be able to eventually get back to long distance hiking.  More to follow.",,View Entry,"Jun 20, Thu",0
Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617338,"When I started my AT hike in 2014, I weighed about 220# (see photo).  By the end of my hike that year (about 550 miles), I had lost about 30# and weighed about 190# (see my ""about"" photo).  I think at that time I felt like I was in my best physical shape in 30+ years.  
In 2018 when I started my AT hike I weighed 240#.  After hiking 200 miles, I had lost about 20#, but still weighed 220#.  Since then, partly due to activity limitations from my chronic left Achilles tendinopathy and partly due to poor dietary choices, I have gained 10# and now am struggling to not go above 230#.  Last year I started in worse physical shape and never felt like I got my trail legs.
I know better.  If my left leg/ Achilles cooperates and heals well, I will do better.  As soon as I get this cast off, I plan on doing everything I am told to do by my orthopedist and by physical therapy to get in shape for long distance hiking and a generally more active and healthy lifestyle.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619555,"Cast was removed from my left lower leg last Tuesday, 7/16/19.  Sent home wearing a ""walking boot"" for at least 3 more weeks, but have started physical therapy.  I am full weight bearing on my left leg now, just supposed to wear the walking boot, except when I shower or sleep, to protect the Achilles tendon repair and allow time for it to heal.
Started physical therapy the day after the cast was removed and going twice/week - 2 visits so far, 3rd is tomorrow.  Doing home exercise regimen for 1-1/2 hrs twice/day.  Seems to be coming along slowly.  Trying to be religious about doing the home exercises.  Having a little pain/tenderness at my inner posterior heel area - hope it is just the surgery healing and that it resolves soon.  
I see the orthopedist again 2 weeks from today.  Hopefully I can get permission to ditch the walking boot and start walking/hiking.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625706,"It has been almost 6 months since I last posted to my journal.  I finished my physical therapy the end of August, then started walking more.  I last saw my orthopedist, Dr. John DiPreta, on 12/10/19 (just over 6 months following my left Achilles tendon repair) and was given the ""all clear"" w/ no activity restrictions.  I can't explain how wonderful it is to walk w/out pain any more.   My thanks to Dr. DiPreta.
We (my wife and I) finished up 2019 celebrating the holidays visiting our 3 sons and their families.  Thanksgiving week was spent in Atlanta w/ our oldest son, his wife, and our 2 younger grandsons (ages 5 and 3).  Christmas week was spent in southern LA/ Redondo Beach w/ our middle son, his wife, and our 2 older granddaughters (ages 11 and 8) and older grandson (age 6).  Finally, for New Years/ Hanukkah week we were in Pittsburgh w/ our youngest son, his wife, and our youngest granddaughter (age 17 months).  We travel to see all our grandchildren several times each year and our sons and their wives invite us to stay in their homes.  We are truly fortunate and blessed to have such close relationships with them.
Throughout the holidays I considered what goals/resolutions I should set for myself for 2020.  I wanted to keep them simple.
#1- I had seen a post/ challenge on the internet suggesting running or walking 2020 miles in 2020 - so that is my #1 goal.  2020 miles is just over 5.5 miles/ day.  That seems not only doable, but appropriate w/ my planned 2021 AT thru hike attempt.  Unfortunately, I got off to a little bit of a late start.  I came home from Pittsburgh on New Year's Day w/ a bad cold and am just getting over it now.  So I started on this goal today with a 9 mile walk along our local Mohawk-Hudson Bike Hike Trail.  I am able to walk to this trail from my home (no drive needed) and as can be seen from the photo I can walk long distances on it.  I hope to add hikes in the high peaks in the Adirondacks, including some overnighters, in the spring, summer, and fall - those will require about a 2 hour drive.
#2- Like so many others, my 2nd goal is weight loss.  I am 65 years old, 5'11"" tall (I think I was 6' when I was younger), and weigh 233#.  Like I said in a previous post, when I hiked in 2014, I started my hike at 220# and after hiking some 550+ miles my weight had dropped to 190# and I felt great.  When I hiked in 2018, I started my hike at about 240# and after hiking 200 miles my weight dropped to 220#, but I never felt I got my ""trail legs"".  My goal for this year then is lose some 20+# and get my weight down to 210#.  I am hoping that in the process of working on goal #1 that goal #2 happens simultaneously w/out much additional effort (other than dietary ""moderation""). 
Happy New Year to all.

My thoughts go out to the Class of 2020 - both those still hiking and those who have postponed or suspended their hike.
And for my fellow Class of 2021, I fear that our class will perhaps grow excessively large w/ those who reschedule their plans/ dreams to next year.  Only time will tell.
As for myself, I continue to try to walk regularly, although that has decreased somewhat in the last couple weeks for a variety of reasons (mostly because of a 2 week vacation on the water limiting my ability to walk, but made up for w/ lots of swimming and snorkeling).  So here are my numbers.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628113,"It has been a long 2 months since my last entry in this journal.  Living in NY State has been surreal.  NYS has had 352,845 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 28,558 Covid related deaths thru 5/19.  Although I live in Upstate NY where the outbreak has been nowheres as bad as in the downstate/ New York City area, the state as a whole has been under a stay at home order for 2 months now.  This week much of Upstate NY is beginning a phased reopening based on meeting certain ""metrics"".  Downstate is still closed.  Most of us are practicing social distancing and wearing masks when in public places/ within 6 feet of others.  Being a ""senior citizen"" (albeit a healthy one), I continue to limit my exposure as much as possible.  
All of that being said, I do live close to the Mohawk-Hudson Bike-Hike Trail and several nature preserves - within walking distance from my house so I don't even need to get in my car to use them.  These trails are rarely crowded enough to necessitate the wearing of a mask.  I continue to walk on them several times/week and have maintained my goal of averaging 5.5 miles/day.  Some days I work outside in my garden and yard and don't go out for a walk, some days weather is less cooperative, other days I take 3-6 hr walks.  Yesterday I did 15.6 miles.  Here are my numbers since my last post-
Average daily mileage -

My total miles walked for the 1st 140 days of 2020 is 775.6, an average of 5.54 miles/day.  Most of these miles are over relatively flat terrain, so I will need to step up my game if I hope to be in shape for the trail next year.  In the next couple months I hope to start hiking the high peaks in the Adirondacks in Upstate NY (2 hrs drive north for me) and do some overnighters w/ full pack.  For those not familiar w/ the Adirondacks, there are 46 peaks of 4000+ ft elevation.  I would like to complete all 46 this spring/summer/fall.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630103,"The last 3 months since my last post have seen some dramatic changes.  The Covid outbreak has moved thru much of the rest of the country and NY State is now doing well.  In fact, if I travel to any of 33 other states, Puerto Rico, or the US Virgin Islands and stay for 24 hours or more, I am required to quarantine for 14 days on my return home to NY.  Colleges in the area have accepted students back for in person classes.  Students attending them from any of the quarantine list states are being quarantined in their dorms for 14 days before being allowed to join in any activities.  
Our economy is opening up - all regions of New York have entered Phase 4 of reopening. Bowling alleys were able to reopen on 8/17, Gyms and fitness centers are reopening on Monday, 8/24.  Indoor shopping malls, movie theaters, and casinos remain closed.  But businesses are struggling still.  Many won't survive.
We (my wife and I) continue to socially isolate and wear masks when we go out.  We rarely go out other than for groceries except for my walks and in our yard.  My plans to start hiking the high peaks in the Adirondacks in Upstate NY have been delayed for various reasons - I hope to do some hiking there in the fall.I have generally continued my walking.  Here are my numbers since my last post-

And my weight is down to 210#.
Now my change of plans.  We have 7 grandchildren now - 3 (ages 11, 9, and 7) in the southern LA are in California; 2 (soon to be ages 6 and 4) in Atlanta, Georgia; and 2 (ages 2 and almost 3 months) in Pittsburgh, PA.  Since our 1st grandchild was born we have traveled to see all of our grandchildren at least 4 times/year.  That stopped w/ Covid except for 1 trip (500 mile/8 hr drive) to Pittsburgh about 5-6 weeks ago to see our newest grandson (born on 6/10/20).  We (my wife and I) are in withdrawal and ""need"" to see our grandchildren.  To hike the AT in 2021 would mean delaying most visits w/ our grandchildren until the last 4 months of 2021.  After our isolation this year, I have made the decision to delay my AT hike until 2022.  I have edited my ""about"" page to reflect these changes and moved my start date to 2/15/22.
Again, please continue to take care of yourselves and stay well. Good luck to the class of 2020 - I am glad the trail reopened for you and hope you succeed in reaching your goal.

Covid in the US is still raging w/ new cases, hospitalizations and deaths all at record levels.  The vaccine gives us hope, although the roll out so far has been less than optimal.  I remain optimistic that will improve over the next month, that our government agencies and the health care industry (our public health care system, hospitals, private health care providers, the pharmaceutical industry, and pharmacies) will become increasingly efficient and proficient at distributing and administering the vaccine.  In the meantime we (my wife and I) continue to physically distance ourselves and take all possible precautions.  This certainly has been made easier by us both being retired.  We do miss traveling to see our sons, their wives, and our grandchildren.  Hopefully that will change by this summer.
The events in Washington and the attack on our Capitol last week were sad and overwhelming.  I watched fixed to the tv, much as I recall watching during what transpired on 9-11.  I hope our country can get through the next 10 days peacefully.  After 9-11 our country seemed to come together, showing incredible strength and resilience against a common external enemy/ threat. This past week's threat was domestic and seems much harder to fight. There were most certainly extremists involved and who are still plotting against our democracy and our rules of law. There were certainly others involved that simply had opposing opinions to those of the ""winning side"" and got caught up in the ""moment"". Should they all be treated the same???
Our country needs to heal - how do we do that???
As for myself, I missed my goal of hiking 2020 miles in 2020.  I didn't do bad though, averaging 5.1 miles/day for the entire year - between 1850 and 1900 miles total.  I am setting my goal for 2021 at 6 miles/ day (2190 miles for the year), but trying a different method to get there.  I have been listening to (binging on) the Mighty Blue podcasts while walking 4-6 hrs most days, usually listening to 2-4 podcasts on each walk.  Mighty Blue describes in his book of his thru-hike in 2014 (coincidentally the same year as my 1st attempt) how he figured how many miles/day he needed to average to finish the trail, then tried to ""bank"" surplus miles and only take a zero when he had enough miles in the bank.  That is my plan this year to try to stay on schedule to reach my goal. On a more general note, the 2021 hiking season has begun and I look forward to reading and watching this year's hiker's blogs and vlogs.  Good luck to the Class of 2021.  Your hiking experiences may be different w/ shelters closed and town visits likely still strained at times w/ Covid still raging.  But while hiking the trail, seeing the magnificent vistas and scenery, sharing your daily lives w/ the AT tramily, I am sure you will be making memories that will last a lifetime.  Again, please continue to take care of yourselves and stay well.",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Sun",0
Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632350,"Quick update today.  I am trying to follow my plan and have been doing fairly well at it so far in 2021.  Upstate NY winter weather can be tough, but it will hopefully prepare me for an early start next year.  I have different combinations of layered clothing and various head and neck gear (buffs, balaclava, fleece or wool hats) I resort to depending on temperature and weather conditions and generally can stay very comfortable down to 10-15 degrees. Today's 9 mile walk was in a snow squall that dumped about 1"" snow during 1 hr of the walk.  I took this selfie and look a little ""frosty"", but felt very comfortable and thought it was 1 of my more enjoyable walks - everything looked so clean and fresh.  So far for the 1st 21 days of 2021 I am averaging 8.3 mils/ day, giving me about 48 miles ""in the bank"".  Again, my goal for 2021 is 6 miles/day for the whole year.  6 miles/day x 365 days = 2190 miles, or about the length of the AT. 
I am starting to enjoy some of the early 2021 AT hiking blogs and vlogs.  One of the more difficult hikes I have seen is by Greenleaf and Apple Pie who are SOBO (apparently they left Katahdin on 12/7/20) and are posting brief videos on Youtube - take a look.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Thu",0

I hope my plans do better for my AT hike than the JMT hike I had planned w/ my middle son earlier this month.  After repeated attempts to get a permit thru the JMT lottery system w/ both my son and I applying, I finally got a permit for the 2 of us to start 9/23/21 from Happy Isles in Yosemite to hike SOBO to Mt Whitney.  I was aware that early winter weather could be a factor and after multiple attempts was able to get the permit changed to a start date of 9/11/21 from Lyell Canyon in Yosemite.  I had my flight to LAX booked for 9/8/21, we had reserved a 1 way car rental from LA to Mammoth Lakes for 9/10, had a room reserved at the Mammoth Mountain Inn for the night of 9/10, then YARTS bus tickets purchased (Mammoth Mountain Inn to Tuolumne Meadows Store - near the Lyell Canyon Trailhead) for the morning of 9/11. On the morning of Monday, 8/30 my son had mailed resupply buckets for us to Red's Meadow, Muir Trail Ranch, and to a hotel in Onion Valley.  Then that very evening (Monday, 8/30) we heard that they were closing all the national forests in California to redirect resources to fire fighting.  That meant that Donahue Pass (the Pass out of Yosemite) was closed as was most of the JMT south from there (only the trails in the National Parks would remain open).  As a result we had to cancel our planned JMT thru-hike, as did many others.  We understand and our prayers and thoughts go out to all the firefighters and those affected by the fires.  But I still feel down about missing this opportunity to hike the JMT, both because it would have been a great shake-down hike for my planned early start on the AT and because I am sure I would have loved hiking the JMT w/ my son.

Since my last post here on 9/16/21, I have been listening to hiking podcasts (especially to ""JESTER"" Section Hiker) and became interested in the idea of switching from my mummy sleeping bag to a quilt.  I am an ""active"" sleeper and I often end up twisted up in my mummy bag by morning.  Anyways, Enlightened Equipment had a Black Friday sale w/ 20% off ""stock"" quilts and I couldn't resist.  I purchased the EE 0 degree Enigma Quilt.  It just arrived yesterday (my wife found the idea of a quilt amusing as she is a ""Quilter"" - obviously a quilt means something different to her than it does to me) and I tried it out w/ my Nemo Cosmo Insulated 25L Sleeping Pad.  It definitely feels warmer than my Marmot 15 degree Plasma Mummy Sleeping Bag and is 2-1/2 oz lighter.  In addition, I was planning on packing my Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Mummy Bag Liner (9 oz), but will not need that now.  Total weight savings of 11-1/2 oz w/ the switch.  Now my base weight for my backpack, tent, sleeping pad, and sleeping bag is an even 9#.  I know my sleeping pad is heavy, but I consider it to be my luxury item and my back and hips appreciate it every night.

I made fairly good time hiking over 4 small to medium peaks - the 1st 2 each about 200', the 2nd 2 each about 400'.  No open views to take pix, although lots of views thru the mostly naked trees.  Got to Low Gap Shelter about 1:20 PM and thought about eating lunch and hiking another 2 hrs/ 3-4 miles to a campsite and set up my tent, but combination of shelter, picnic table, water source, privy, and bear cables to hang my food convinced me to stay.  Not a lot of flat ground here to set up my tent, so staying in the shelter tonight.  That should also make it quicker to pack in the morning.
I visited w/ some other thru-hikers when I got to the shelter.  The 4 who were at the 1st 2 shelters were here - trail names Artisan, Flex, Rocky, and Zero (Zero is actually only hiking for a couple weeks) - they set up tents and a hammock nearby.  Thru-hiker Guam is staying in the shelter as well tonight.  I think 3 other thru-hikers are also here setting up tents or hammocks.  And section hiker Nap is staying in a tent.
