Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650454,"Day 3 Sun, 24 Aprhttps://maps.google.com/maps?q... Appalachian TrailAppalachian Trailmi 275.1 • Elevation: 1333 ft35.893032,-82.826250 (±115 ft)GPS Ping at 3:25:40 PMI am at the Laughing Heart hostel in Hot Springs, NC.  For those of you concerned that I am alone I will try to upload some pictures of the hostel at the moment.   I am hoping that not everyone leaves at once tomorrow. I set a goal for a 12 mile per day average at the beginning of the hike. So far it’s 20 and that seems more reasonable for the first two maybe four weeks. I decided to get on the trail without tuning up first. I’ve done that 3 times and got in shape and couldn’t do the trail.  This time the plan is to get in shape while making miles. I believe it will work - it’s just painful. A different muscle complains every hour. But “pain is just weakness leaving the body” as my drill instructor used to say. I have plenty of weakness so….It’s hard for me mentally to go slow and get passed so often but the goal is to finish not to win. Say it over and over, Wes!  So far only one person my age so let the twenty something’s fly. Next stop will be Sam’s Gap I think in TN. 4 or 5 days to go 45 miles but a lot of vertical as well. Currently sitting at 1300’ and have to get back above 5000’.  Weather supposed to be good, some showers on Tuesday. Hike On!","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650456,"Day 5 Tuesday 26 AprRain “showers” started at 8:30 and went until 3:30. Temps going to freezing at night so I stopped at a stealth site around 4:00 to get set up and dry before it got cold.  Hot meal, dry sleep clothes and no one else around. Expecting a good nights sleep.","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650457,Day 6 Wednesday 27 AprWoke up to frost on tent and ground. Spent an extra hour in the tent waiting for Sun to come up. High the day around 50. First day I have ever worn my hoodie to lunch time. Usually comes off after 30 minutes of hiking. But it was really windy. Cool day and good sleep made for my best day yet in miles -12.8.  Right knee was talking to me today. Vitamin I to the rescue. At a shelter so snoring abounds. Yuk.,"

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650458,"Day 7 Thursday 28 AprYep. Lots of snoring. About 80% sleep for me. As is often the case, protecting the knee yesterday caused the hip to be sore today. More vitamin I. (That’s ibuprofen to non-hikers.) plus I was in such a hurry to get away from the shelter that I really didn’t eat enough breakfast.  A bit down the trail was a 3.5 mile climb. No water for 6 miles. So I started up with 3 liters - about 7 pounds. I HATE carrying more than a liter of water. Predictably, I bonked  at the top. Hungry and no energy. So I stopped and made a hot spaghetti lunch. Napped for 20 minutes and was like new - make that gently used - again.  Was able to get to Sam’s Gap and hostel for the night. Sleeping in a cabin by a great creek. Such luxury!!!","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650459,"Day 8 Friday 29 April Yep. The cabin was great for sleeping. Babbling brook beside and no snoring. Made me think of a John O’Hara. After the hiking season they cater to bikers. He would have been right at home here.
Up for breakfast at 7:00 — two Jimmy Dean meat lovers breakfast bowls. Pure heaven.  Went thru gear and food. Resupplied a little right at the hostel. Back on the trail at 10:00 am. Late but moving faster on real food. Still made 11 miles today and not tired. 🤞8:00 pm — hiker midnight!Shutting down.","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650460,"Day 9 Saturday 30 April I’ve stopped 3 miles short of Erwin TN. I swear I can smell the real food. But I promised myself 4 weeks of not pushing. This was the first test and I passed - barely. Got 11.7 miles in and feel pretty dang good. Just as I was about to stop for lunch, I happened upon trail magic. Hard boiled eggs, apples, bananas and homemade cookies. I was greedy and had one of each. What a great lunch—thank you trail angels!
Passed over Big Bald test and forgot to mention it. Balds are really cool. All at once the trees get really small then stop altogether. I’ll include some pictures. 
Real food tomorrow and maybe a break.","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650461,Day 11 Monday 2-May No cell service yesterday so a very quick two day update. Covered 23 miles in the two days. Ate a ton of town food in Erwin and resupplied for this week. Meeting Clare on Friday near Roan Mtn TN. Actually starting to get about half of my stage 1 trail legs. Been doing 11 miles a day for the last few without getting exhausted. Big improvement from week one! Feel like I am where I would have been if I had trained up for a couple of months. This is clearly more time efficient but way harder on the mind and body.,"

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650462,"Day 12 Tuesday 3-May Fun fact - my iPhone no longer recognizes me. We'll see if a shave cures that. No cell service now. Send later. Another 11 mile day. I got part way up Roan Mtn which is good cuz it's a 3000' 5 mile climb. Gonna be a tough start in the morning.Made myself a stealth tent spot at about 6:00 which was really good.  Gave me enough time to set up my tent and hang by bear bag line. At 6:15 the rain started!I tossed everything inside the tent and made dinner. Got a break about 7:15 so I ran out to hang my food on the bear line - in my underwear. Was able to say hi to my unexpected neighbor lady. Oh well, pride does not work on the trail.  I think she is still giggling.  Sigh...Lots of lightning around. Glad I wasn't at the shelter on top of the mountain. It's smack on top of a bald. Highest shelter on the AT at 6200+ feet and no cover. All for now.","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650463,"Day 13 Wednesday 4-May Well, it rained pretty much all night - not real hard but in showers off and on. The hike up Roan Mtn was in light drizzle and fog and chilly. Don’t think it got above 45 until the sun broke out around 1:30. I think Roan might be the last 6000+ mountain on the trail. I kinda hope so - they are butt kickers. Stopped short today at 3:30 to let stuff dry out. Only covered 9.6 miles but only need 11.1 to meet Clare on Friday morning. So I’m actually right on schedule. Still no canopy of leaves. Hope they come soon. The day sun is hot! New and different flowers are coming out and a lot of the bushes are just about to pop. It’s pretty and pleasant. Not sure what to do with all this extra time tonight!  Weird to not walk until it’s time to eat and crash.","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650464,"Day 14 Thursday 5-May Another short day - 10.8 miles but done st 3:00 pm. Grueling downhill to finish over very rocky terrain. While it takes less effort coming down, the pucker factor is much higher when the footing is unstable.  I think I get just as tired as going up.  Maybe not. You saw the video from the top of the bald. Those places are just amazing. Also saw a strange new yellow ""flower"" today. Not sure what it was maybe someone else does.  Officially left NC today although it's been in and out with TN for the last 120 miles. Meeting Clare in the morning for my first Zero day. We'll be in Roan Mtn TN. Getting resupplied, reconnected and eating everything in site. At the end of 14 days I'm at 145 miles and exactly where I expected to be. That's good news. Even better news is that I passed a guy going up the mountain today. I'm now only the second slowest person on the AT.","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650431,"Ok -- I think I might have this working now with the gracious support of Liz C.  I simply cannot get enough bandwidth on the trail to reliably log on to the site.  Liz has agreed to post the texts and pix here that I send to her which works much more often.
Many, many thanks to Liz.
Tonight in Roan Mtn, TN at a B&B with Clare enjoying a night not under the stars.  It was hailing an hour ago! NOT fun in a tent.
My first official ZERO - meaning i made no forward progress on the trail.  Usually a rest and recovery day.
More to follow and thanks for your support - it really, really means a lot.","

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650516,Day 16 Saturday 7-May Yesterday was my Zero day in Roan Mtn TN. Clare came up and we stayed in a very nice B&B named Roan Mtn B&B. Not sure how they came up with the name. 🤔I think I passed muster - at least she didn't try to drag me off the trail. Clare dropped me off at the trail at 9:15. Hiked until about 5:00 and got in 13.1 miles. Also passed 400 mark. Yay!  It rained all day - steady drizzle and occasional shower. So I arrived at the very lovely Laurel Fork shelter named after the river I can hear in the distance. I'll attach pix of the shelter (right now I have it all to myself!) and the river with the laurel in bloom. Actually very beautiful. The river cascades rapidly downhill so there is plenty of white water and great sound. I love sleeping by running water. So I'm sitting in my dry sleep clothes - the most important thing in my kit. Supposed to be low to mid 40's,"Roan Mtn, TN

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650517,Tonight. So here it goes   Clare you were right to make me keep my cold clothes another two weeks. I would have survived tonight but it would have been very chilly!Trying to get to Damascus VA by Wednesday because Trail Days start on Thursday.  It's a huge 3 day festival which would be great fun. But I can't afford the time. So I'm trying to get through while there are still supplies on the shelves. Hope the journal works out. Again thanks Liz. Thanks to all who signed my guest book!,"

Fizzix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650926,"Friday the 13th. Perfect timing. I haven’t updated this week because it isn’t a great update.  I took a bad fall on Sunday and had to come off the trail. Looks like this year’s quest is shot. I have a broken ankle and fibula on the right leg.  Surgery is scheduled for Tuesday.  I will be non weight bearing for three months after that.  So it will be fall before I can get back on the trail which I will do.  Just don’t have a firm plan yet. What happened?Took my eye off the trail for a second when I should not have is the root cause.  I was coming down a long two mile mountain a day after steady rain.  Trail was very slick - wet clay. I was being very careful due to the conditions.  As I got to the bottom, I approached 3 log steps and a very wet area. I looked up to see where the dry was going to be and slipped on the stairs.  I fell straight back with with right foot trapped under me and ended up at the bottom bent like a pretzel. I had to get out of my pack and then survey the damage. Nothing protruding and no blood so I was hopeful. Waited for the nausea that can accompany a broken bone and it never came.  So I put my puffy on - always be prepared for shock - got up and hobbled about a mile to get to the Boots Off hostel.  Called home and the wife came to get me. So I am broken but not beaten. I will do this just cannot finish in 2022. More as I figure things out. I really appreciate all the support I have gotten from you. Thank you!","
