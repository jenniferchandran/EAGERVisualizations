Unfinished,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646188,"Hi Everyone!,This is my second trail journal entry. Today I received my 3 new stuff sacks and my sleeping bag liner!! To say I was thrilled is an understatement.I live near the A.T here in NC, and spent last season working at Fontana Village Resort, in Fontana Dam, NC. I met many hikers and even a couple ridge runners while I was there... everyone had the greatest advice!I leave in March 2022, and though I have been WIDE OPEN with excitement, I'm feeling some anxiety creeping in and I wonder if I will be as ""okay"" as I've been thinking? Maybe it's natural to feel a bit uncertain before embarking on such a trek?~ Unfinished",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Thu",0

Game changer for packing my sleeping bag! Also for my clothes.I've been working to get signed up on these various hiker websites so that I can communicate with friends and family while I'm gone. Some of them are a little confusing, including this one? But I'm learning.I still need help with my daily planning???  Can anyone give me some ideas, please and thank you!~ Unfinished",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Fri",0
Unfinished,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646206,"Hi, Everyone!!  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!Today's focus is on my backpack, and learning all of the cool adjustments and all of the pockets!! I'm carrying a Osprey Aura 65 AG, and I'm really happy with it! I first started with a Kelty 50, and quickly realized that it was too small for what I needed. I'm starting out with the ENO Hammock Sleep System with under quilt, and may decide later on my tent.  I'm still waiting on a few smaller gear pieces and a second pair of shoes.I live in Western North Carolina, in between Nantahala (NOC) and the Great Smoky Mountain's, so I have the best day hikes ever.  I'm also really watching the weather in my area and the Shenandoah's. I may try to leave a month or so earlier than planned... not sure yet??  Happy Hiking!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sat",0
