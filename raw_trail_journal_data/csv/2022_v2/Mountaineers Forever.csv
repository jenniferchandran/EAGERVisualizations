Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532976,"The Mountaineers Forever team consiste of ""Mountaineer"" and ""Golden Bear"". After I read the ""AWOL"" book, my grandson ""Golden Bear"" and I ""Mountaineer"" decided in January we would hike the AT. To get a feel for the AT, we are going to do a section hike in June in the Shenandoah Valley for a week of about 92 miles. And when I am no longer working and he's is not taking college summer classes, we will hike the entire trail. At that time, we will hike half of it one year and the remaining half the next year. It is amazing all of the equipment and supplies we need. We just have a few minor items to obtain. And we are very excited to get started. I have learned a lot from just reading AT journals.   We will try to keep our journal updated during our hiking week if we have cell service.","

This Saturday, we will test our backpacks with them loaded on a 10 mile hike up a couple mountains and along a river. This will give us an idea if we need to make any adjustments to our gear. With two of us sharing the load, we should have an advantage.   And we need to prepare our clothing to protect us from the ticks. Mountaineer and Golden Bear","Skyland Resort

We will be testing our equipment tomorrow with a ten mile hike up and down couple of mountains. And with the chance of rain, we can determine if we can stay mostly dry. And it will give us the opportunity to make any adjustments to our backpacks.   Based on the hikers journals, we will be crossing several streams by just hopping along rocks. And several bear sightings along our proposed hike. We do have our plans will we expect to shelter/camp for each night for a week. I am hoping this hiking week will fuel our desire to complete the entire trail in the next two to three years.Mountaineer and Golden Bear","Skyland Resort

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534373,"Today Mountaineer and Golden Bear tested our equipment and endurance on a 7 mile hike that took us 3/12 hours including our breaks and adjusting our backpacks. This was a good test for the AT. It had rained earlier so we dealt with a muddy trail and water running down the trail as we climbed the mountains. Started with 1/4 mile on pavement and then hit the muddy mountain trail that involved switchbacks, straight up the mountain, and even had a mile of roller coaster trail when we reached the peak. Going down the other side of the mountain was tougher due to the slick muddy conditions. After three miles, our trail leveled out as we hiked along a very muddy river. After over another mile, we were hiking on railroad tracks. After a break we had to climb another mountain for a mile. Then it leveled off again and eventually we headed down hill and arrived at our vehicle.We ready to get the packs off and get out of the muddy shoes and wet socks. We were very tired and ready to go home. Getting more excited about the AT. We did see deer, frog, turtle, several crawling insects and some raccoon tracks at several locations.

We just finished up acquiring our last two items. And last night I bagged up our daily food requirements and bagged up our snacks so we could keep the snacks handy while hiking during the day.   And along our journey we will have the chance to have some non trail food. And hopefully find some trail magic too. I keep wondering if we have missed anything. But I know we will be with other hikers so we will be in good hands.

Based on reading some journals of hikers that just hiked our route, it has been interesting regarding bears and snakes. One hiker had seen six bears. One bear near a shelter where hikers were camping. And it was good to read that one hiker actually stayed at three of the shelters we plan on camping. And updates on water locations and if any are now dry.   Regardless of bears, snakes, water, rain, etc., we are ready for the challenge. Mountaineer and Golden Bear""Persevere""","Skyland Resort

There were many people out enjoying the historical buildings and grounds. And we had the chance to see several hikers pass by. Golden Bear and I decided to cross the river via the railroad bridge that leads you to Maryland if heading north. That was our ten minutes on the AT.   Tomorrow we will be shuttled to Skyland Resort and have a big breakfast on Sunday and then hit the trall.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537119,"It was early to rise at 6:00 this morning so we all could have the breakfast buffet at the Resort. After breakfast Golden Bear and I headed to the trailhead and our family was there to send us off onto our adventure. It would be 10.9 miles to Pass Mountain Hut. And the forecast had bad storm arriving that afternoon. And with hail and wind gusts of 22MPH. We hit the trail at 9:00AM. And we saw our first bear near the parking lot. Amazing. Immediately it was a long climb up the hill. It didn't take long until we knew this would be tough because we didn't have seasoned trail legs. About two miles in, Living Proof, a thru hiker passes us, and we chat for a few minutes and he was long gone. He had started in Georgia 931 miles ago. Up and down steep mountains with 30lb packs on our back we kept pushing forward. The terrain was very rocky at times and the rocks were sharp. Golden Bear's back began to hurt and I was feeling it in my shoulders and feet.When we visited the ATC (Apppalachian Trail Conservatory) in Harpers Ferry the previous day the workers there couldn't believe we were being that aggressive with the miles. They had been thru hikers years ago. And they told us how we would feel and we are feeling it.We made it to Pass Mtn. Hut at 3:00PM and we just were so happy. There were two thru hikers already, Pops and The Kid. The shelter is three sided with a roof and this one sleeps eight. Two young ladies arrive, Moose and Raw arrive. So us six have the lower floor and two others arrived and they took the two spots. And we had a mouse and small ring neck snake in the shelter. Many more hikers appeared and they had to do tent camping.In Shenandoah National Park you can't stealth camp so you have to shelter/camp at the shelters only. This creates what they call bubble camping and you have many at each location..Tonight was noisy until about 9:30 when us six in the shelter wanted to go to sleep before 7:00PM. One hiker showed up with whiskey and one had pot. Very interesting conversations around the campfire. Today we saw three deer and one bear.Mountaineer and Golden Bear""Persevere ""","Skyland Resort

After a tough day yesterday of 10.9 miles, we weren't sure about 13.4 miles now. Some were amazed we hiked 10.9 miles on our first day on a rough rocky trail. We headed out by 6:00AM this morning. We were looking forward to a stop at a wayside on Skyline Drive for a hot meal. It would be about 7.2 miles to the Elkwallow Wayside.   That motivated us. We arrived four hours later. Ate and chatted with Pops and The Kid too. Moose and Raw arrived later. We had a nice two hour stay there. Refilled our water and headed onward Gravel Springs Hut. And we saw a bear at Elkwallow. Along the way we saw bear tracks twice and bear scat at a few places. We had 6.2 miles to go. Today was not as bad as yesterday and today was three miles longer. Not a bunch of rocks today. We arrived around three today at the shelter. The Kid started a fire for everyone again today.Pops is very informative and we are learning a lot from him. Thank you Pops. Tonight we see some of the folks from the previous night. Eight of us in the shelter. A grandmother and her grandson are doing a south bound (SOBO) section hike. They are in the shelter too.More and more hikers show up and there are tents everywhere. There were over 20 hikers there tonight. Another example of the ""bubble"".

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537182,"This morning was another up early at 5:00 so we could get to the shuttle pick up by 2:20 so we could get driven into Front Royal. Along the way we got another shuttle and got to our hotel earlier than anticipated.   The Kid, Golden Bear and I woke up feeling bad. It is hard to tell what is making you feel bad. Is it the long hikes, bad water, dehydrated, stomach virus, not eating properly, etc. The thru hikers said it is hard to determine. When hikers went thru Smokey Mtns several ended up with the norovirus at those shelters. Some left the trail and some continued their journey while sick. And there are signs posted at each shelter now along the trail stating there could have been sick hikers there so be careful to keep your hands clean with soap.. Sanitizers won't combat norovirus. So tonight we had our first shower in three days and a change of clothes. Yes it feels good to be cleaned again. We ate light but still not feeling well. We keep drinking water and Gatorade to get hydrated. The next hike would be 13-18 miles and part of that is about 10 miles of the roller coast. That is 13 climbs of 500 feet. So either we shuttle around it or shuttle to our car and go home. And determine what we did wrong and how to lower our backpacks to about 22LBS rather than 30LBS. And start out with six to eight miles a day and have fun rather than deal with distances. And we are already finding ways to lower the weight. But this has been a good learning lesson and just listening to the thru hikers you gain so much experience. Whatever we decide to do, we won't give up our dream of completing the AT no matter how many years it may take.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537414,"Well we decided to delay our hike and make adjustments for our future section hike. We got shuttled from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry and headed home. Mark (shuttle driver), was a thru hiker in 2009 and now he works couple jobs and shuttles hikers from about anywhere in northern VA to southern PA. So we talked about what we just did the last few days and we actually did well for beginners. He did say when he thru hiked, he started out with 5-7 miles a day for the first week. I mentioned we are coming back later this summer to hike the state of Maryland. And hike the WV trail which is only about five miles. Then we can mark off two completed states.We started evaluating equipment when we got home and have it reduced to about 18 lbs before we add food and water. So food for 4 days is about 7 lbs for each. And water for a day of hiking is about 4 lbs. So when we start the next time, we should be about 29 lbs each.My pack was about 34 lbs on the last hike and Golden Bear had about 36 lbs. Now we know why we felt it along with not having hiker legs like the thru hikers that already had 900 miles when we met them.We are not finished. Now we have to determine the dates for the next journey.Mountaineer and Golden Bear""Persevere""","Front Royal

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544462,"It has been almost two months since we (Mountaineer and Golden Bear) got off the trail and now we have time to begin another section hike journey. We have changed our strategy since we know it will take a few years to complete the 2180 miles by just doing short section hikes. Since the AT passes thru 14 states, we are planning to knock them off state by state.   This time complete two of the shortest states, WV and MD. And then plan for our next one or two states.   And it didn't take long last time to find out what you believe is a good plan, isn't a good plan. Reading the journals you see that everyone has their plans changed at sometime. It is sad to see several thru hikers have come down with Lyme Disease after completing over 1400 miles. And some have returned and plowing forward.We have decreased our weight for the back packs. Golden Bear is now at 30 lbs including food and water after hauling 37 lbs the last time. Mountaineer will be carrying about 26 lbs after carrying 33 lbs on the last trip. Both of us have been doing some training hikes this time. My latest training hikes have been with 30 lbs on my back. And we will not be starting off with 11 to 13 miles a day. First day will 6 miles and then a 9 mile day. And to take our time and enjoy the trail. And I hear MD has some minor water issues but the state parks have water.   So we may have to carry more water than usual this time.This late in the year we may not see many hikers unless they are day hikers. It is amazing how much valuable info is shared by the thru hikers journals. Well tomorrow we begin again and we are excited to get back to the AT for a few days.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544661,"Today we drove five hours to reach Harpers Ferry and we were picked up by a shuttle driver ( Mark ""Strings"" Cusic) and we were dropped off at Keys Gap Trailhead. And we began our journey north to Harpers Ferry. I was thinking maybe no rocks today but we saw rocks 90% of the time on the trail. But not even close to the ones we saw in SNP in Virginia. I can't imagine the rocks in Rockslavania. But nothing wrong being challenged by some rocks. Better than bears, snakes and ticks. We took our time and enjoyed the hike and conversations. We did see some very fast deer darting across the trail a couple of times. We didn't expect to see anyone today since the NOBO thru hikers are long gone and the SOBO thru hikers haven't made it this far south yet. We did see a father (Bobcat) and son heading south on a section hike. And we caught up with a young lady section hiker heading north to Harpers Ferry. She is from Pittsburgh and was heading to DC in the morning to meet up with friends. No water to be had on our portion of the trail today. Which that seems to be the norm just about everywhere on the trail right now. Unless you find some parks or campgrounds that have spigots.

Mark Cusic, shuttle driver, picked us up at Harpers Ferry and shuttled us to Pen Mar parking lot. Also where the Mason Dixon line is located. So we were actually in PA and all we had to do was to hike few feet to MD. Our goal is to complete MD by Monday. The hike immediately began up a steep rocky trail. Mark had mentioned the first two miles would be the hardest in Maryland. And that day he was correct. It was one mountain after another up hill with boulders. And eventually we had about a mile that was so nice and flat and no rocks. That was a treat. We were hiking 9.8 miles to the shelter. We didn't pass many hikers. We began our hike about 9:30 and arrived at the shelter about 3:30. We decided to tent tonight and a small rain shower came through that cooled the temps. It felt good. Then a couple and another hiker showed up and stayed in the shelter. We did meet Momma Moon at a creek location and chatted with her a few minutes. She was section hiking. She is from Texas.

Fortunately there are two places to get water at Ensign. The AWOL guide mentions the spring next to the shelter is usually stagnant or dry. But if you go about 200 yards down the service road there are two places to obtain water. And today's hike would consist of 8.1 miles. Today was not as rocky as Friday so we made better time and arrived at Pine Knob by noon. Along the way we saw over 30 day hikers and a couple of section hikers. Golden Bear even took the lead at times and left me behind. So he was feeling good at times. After we arrived at Pine Knob, we got this idea to head to Dahlgren Camp Ground which was another 5.2 miles. A big decision for us since we have never hiked more than 13.1 miles. So off we went. We stopped at the first George Washington Monument and resupplied our water at GW State Park. We arrived at Dahlgren and this place has functioning bathrooms and hot water showers.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545050,"What a day we had on Sunday. We were going to have a short day since Saturday was the longest day we ever hiked which was 13.5 miles. So our goal was about 6.2 miles to Crampton Gap which has water issues. Very sporadic even if there was water. So we were going to sleep in on Sunday. I got up at 6:30 anyway and let Golden Bear sleep another 45 minutes. And I made him breakfast. We finally broke camp at 8:20. Said good by to the hikers we met. There are really some great people out here on AT. We make it to Crampton and decide we will hike another 0.3 mile to Gapland State Park for our break and good water. Right before Gapland we met Waffles on the trail. She was so relaxed sitting there reading her book. She started from Georgia in April and heading to Maine where she lives. She has hiked some 28 mile days and hopes to get to Maine late September by doing 20 plus miles each day.   These thru hikers make it look so easy since they have hundreds of miles on their legs. We rest and obtain our water and decide to hike onto Ed Harvey Shelter for the night. We make it to Ed Harvey which now makes it a 10.2 miles day. We sit at the crossroads and believe we can make it to Harpers Ferry today. Another 6.3 miles with three flat miles at the end along a Canal Path. Off we go and we make it to HF by 5:20 and then drive 5 hours to our home. A crazy tiring 16.5 miles exciting day. But Monday will be a Zero Day since I had planned to be on the trail. But may become a Nero Day if I mow grass. We never saw a snake or bear in Maryland. We met some great hikers and exchanging info is very valuable. Our biggest pain was our feet. No blisters or injuries but our feet ached. Need to find better ideas on socks and/or liners. Or wear couple pairs of socks.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559754,"It is a new year and almost time to join the trail again. My goal is to section hike all of Georgia later this month. Last year, Golden Bear and I (Mountaineer) hiked a small portion of Shenandoah National Park and later that year we came back and completed WV and Maryland. Of course, those two states are not very long but we did mark them off of our list. Golden Bear will not be with me in Georgia since he will still be in classes at the Univeristy. And then he has two Summer classes. So I will not have my grandson there to push me along the trail. He will be missed. Maybe after Summer classes, he can join me for a long weekend hike on the AT. I have been training since March 1st by hiking 8-10 miles 4 to 5 times a week on some trails at a park. Even though there are some inclines to climb, they don't compare to the AT mountains. But I feel good about getting many miles on my legs. I have been working on backpack weight and now I have it down to 20lbs before water and food. And since my plan is to carry only 5lbs of food and only 60 ounces of water, my hiking weight will be about 29lbs. And I have been training with 28 to 32 lbs. I am not going to use a water bladder this time so I don't have to deal with about 4-5 lbs of water near my shoulders. And w/o the bladder I have more room in the backpack. So I will have to be sure to hit the streams along the way. By having the Hiker App and reading journals, I have an idea where to find a working stream or spring. I am anxious to get started. I have read so many journals and I hear the Norvirous is along the AT in Georgia. And many have stated they have been sick. No one is talking about bears, snakes or ticks. So the plan is to be on the trail on April 18th and hike 9 days and stay off the trail two of those nights. Nothing like a nice shower and a real juicy cheeseburger and clean clothes. I have a plan and I pray that the Lord has the same plan for me and keeps me safe. Looking forward to making some more hiking friends. Mountaineer""Persevere""","Home

And where I got dropped off, in order for me to make sure I don't miss a white blaze, I had to hike South 0.1 mile up Springer Mountain and of course very rocky and it had to rain. I signed the register and had my pic taken and that is the very beginning of the trail. And we don't count the 0.9 mile south to begin the hike. And off I went toward Hawk Mountain Shelter with about 10 others that started about 10:30AM. I have to say the first day was an easy hike. Just setting me up for the next hard day. Thanks to those 4-5 days each week of hiking 8-10 miles really helped me. Of course my pre hiking miles don't compare to the AT terrain. I arrived at the shelter about 2:40. And I was still feeling good but I didn't want to go beyond my plan and suffer my adding more miles. I was fortunate to get to the shelter early enough to get a spot. We had five on first floor and four in the loft. And there were about 15 hikers in their tents. I was ready to go to sleep but several of us chatted and got to know some things about each other. We had three dogs at this site. Tripod who now is from Atlanta but is from Charleston WV was there. So we got to talk about some things. I got to know Boowah and Sketchy. Several of the hikers don't have trail names yet. Some wait to earn their trail name along the trail. All in all, most hikers respect each other and several end up being great friends.

Well, couple of us had a plan to head out this morning by 7:00AM and as soon one stepped out to leave at 7:00 we had a very heavy rainstorm for 30 minutes. It was so foggy we couldn't see the sky and had no idea iit was about to rain. So we left at 7:30. My original plan was to hike 7.7 miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter. Well my new two friends and me talked about how we had so much free time on Tuesday. So I decided to to see if I could keep up with them and their goal was to make it at least to Woody Gap. That would be 12.7 miles. Sketchy left way after me from Hawk and caught up with me and she slowed down and we chatted for four miles. It is easier to hike when you are talking with someone. She pulled me up and down Sassafrass Mtn which is one of the two toughest mountain climbs in Georgia. And then we headed up Justus Mountain which was easier. And I felt no pain. Sketchy has already hiked PCT and another long trail and she wants to average 22 miles a day to reach Maine by August. She then takes off and is gone. Then I see Booya at Woody Gap and we have lunch and she says she may try for Lance Creek Campground. Then I fall in line and head that way too. We made it to Lance by 4:00. A very long 16.2 mile day. So with Booya pulling up and down Sassfrass Mountain and then That tied my longest day that occurred when I was hiking with Golden Bear in Maryland. When he was pulling me along those 16.2 miles.

Then I got checked into a great cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins. And the staff here is so accommodating. Today Booya and I hiked together from Lance Campground to Neels Gap. And we had to climb the dreaded Blood Mountain that so many hikers talk about everyday. Going up was not as bad as I thought it would be but going downhill 2.3 miles to Neels Gap was tougher. So many rock faces we had to walk across and had to be extra careful not to slide down the hill. One time I had to use all fours to get down one rock face. The top of Blood Mountain had a wonderful view. Blood Mountain is the tallest peak on the AT in Georgia. And when we got to Neels Gap I had to take pic of the famous soles tree. Over the years several leave the trail here and go home and some have thrown their shoes onto the limbs. I saw Tripod here and he was continually to head North. Booya' family her here today so I probably won't see her again. She was going to continue North. The staff here does our laundry that is included in the hiker rate.

And of course 99% of the time we begin our new day up a mountain. I stopped and talked to two other hikers and they were going to head there. We climbed Cowrock Mountain too and the view was wonderful. It was still early, so I said I am going forward. We passed each other a couple of times. The last two miles were nothing but large rocks and up hill. We thought it would better to get these two bad miles behind us since we were already exhausted. And not start with them the next day. It felt great to make it. I had a few thank you Jesus moments today. I saw my first serpent today and it stuck its tongue out at me. I tented tonight at the mountain shelter with 5 others and I experienced my first storm on the trail. You could hear the wind most of the night. The gusts had to be 25mph. And it did rain. It was great to hear my first owls talking to each other tonight. I was hoping they were talking about a possible mice dinner. Another a very thankful hiking day. It is great to be out here.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561364,"We woke up to a beautiful sunrise after the storm last night. Today is Saturday, April 22nd, and another day of a few mountain climbs. These mountains just make us stronger. Plus using the trekking poles while climbing and descending makes our arms stronger. You get to see beauty out here and get to improve our health. If only we would eat more. It seems most of us have trouble eating on the trail until they get out of Georgia. Then the hikers can't get enough to eat as they continue north. And we have to drink quite a bit of water to stay hydrated. Fortunately we find places to filter our water. Sometimes we hike 3-4 miles before we find a good water source. I stopped for a break at Indian Grave Gap and I see a copperhead about 18 inches long looking at me. And he just stayed there looking around. Break over and back on the trail. As I said more mountains. My goal was to get to Tray Mountain Shelter which would be a 8.1 mile day. I arrived at the shelter at 12:30. Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain were long climbs. And I met Brent who is a trail ambassador for the AT. He is a volunteer. And Lady Tree (from Georgia) was there and we were talking about the storm heading to us later this evening. And Brent informed us about future water. We get water and Lady Tree and I decide to head to Addis Gap which is another 5.6 miles north. This gave me a 13.7 mile day. And we found some great tenting sites there and along comes Mocking Bird from KY. So we three tent there and shortly after hiker midnight, we can hear the big storm heading our way like a train. Then lightning and thunder. It rained about all night. Another adventurous day and we were safe and not wet yet. ""Persevere""Mountaineer","Blue Mountain Shelter

We tried our best to keep everything dry this morning but it was not happening. So everything was primarily wet and we were drenched in our effort to hike 5.4 miles to Dicks Creek Gap.   We left Addis Gap at 7:30 and arrived before 11:00. Based on the never ending rain and wind we did very well. Lady Tree had her car there and our reward today was to go straight to DQ to eat and have ice cream. And we did. And it was warm and dry in there. Lady Tree (new trail name now is Sergeant). She made me eat snacks and drink water this morning. She could see I wasn't eating and not drinking much. We had a fun hike in the rain and muddy trail. Even in adverse conditions you can endure when you have new hiking friends. Mocking Bird said he was hiking slow, but he wasn't slow. For some reason when you are with others and all are talking you automatically hike based on leader's (Sergeant) pace. So Sergeant went back home since she was just doing a five day hike and headed back to work here in Georgia. Mocking Bird and I are warm and dry tonight. We both got rooms on this Nero Day and he is taking a Zero Day Monday due to weather and wanting to rest. And I will head north on Monday morning in the rain as long as there is not any lightning. Maybe I will find a new hiking buddy tomorrow to keep my mind off of a long elevation climb later in the day. Good night since it is way past hikers midnight. ""Persevere""Mountaineer","Addis Gap

I had a great nights sleep on Sunday night and got all of my gear cleaned and dried from the Saturday night storm and the Sunday morning rain. So today (Monday, April 24th), I got shuttled to Dicks Creek Gap where I got off on Sunday. And you know what was waiting for me? Another mountain waiting for me to challenge it and up I went to the top. After two miles, I had my first fall on the trail. And it was not graceful. I didn't lift a foot high enough and hit either a root or rock and stumbled and tried to catch myself with the poles but the backpack shifted and then I was flying in the air. The owls thought it was funny. The vultures were flying over to see if I would recover. What seemed like over a minute of slow motion falling, my poles went flying, my arms were grasping at air, and all I could see were the trees coming right at me. Then I hit ground and ended up on my back (house) and looked like a turtle on his back. I got up and everything was still in place and no blood. We carry our home on our back everyday like a turtle. So onward I went and today I actually took a few more pictures. I didn't have anyone hiking with me today since some started late or took a Zero Day due to the predicted rainy day. It did not rain a drop to the shelter. The hiking day goes quicker for me when I have someone to chat with during the day. I arrived at my destination by 2:15. Then about 15 more hikers arrived before hikers midnight. Three in the shelter and the rest in their tents. There was a slight chance of rain (20%). And of course about 8:00 it rained for about 10 minutes. The temperature was in the 40s and it felt colder than 40s. It was a nice evening listening to everyone talk about their food or what was their plan for Tuesday. My plan was easy. Since I was now in NC it was time for me to hike the 4 miles to Deep Gap early on Tuesday morning and get my car that was staged and headed home. Rafiki was up and ready to leave at 7:00 so we were first out of camp and hiked the 4 miles together. When we arrived I gave him my remaining food. And Rafiki headed up a very big climb while I headed home. And tomorrow I begin planning my next trip on the AT. After I mow grass. It feels good to have another state completed.

But my body was thinking otherwise. We were on the trail by 7:00 and I did my best to hang for 6 miles. Then I told him to keep going and to hike at his speed.  No way I was keeping up with a 22 yr old that is fit. As I began my 15th mile and it happened to be uphill.

There were six of us in the shelter and one hiker snored (sawed timber) the whole night.  It was so loud, all the bears headed back to NC. Of course most of us snore at times, but this was scary. I hope the hiker doesn't have sleep apnea.  One reason we don't like shelters but it makes it easier to set up camp and break camp if you don't need to deal with the tent. Anyways, Rafiki and I hit the trail at 6:45 and after one mile Rafiki was long gone. I hiked 14.6 miles today and tenting at Laurel Creek Shelter. i have not seen any bears or snakes this week. And to date no ticks on me. I did see two Dung Beetles rolling a dung ball the size of a golf ball across the trail today. It was amazing how those two beetles worked so well together to get it across the trail. I got that on video. If I wasn't watching my feet to make sure I didn't trip I would not have seen them. The hike was a long day for me but it had some level trail for a few miles and water was scare at times. I did have a 2.5 miles climb up to Kelly Knob with an increase of 1700' in elevation. The trail may not be forgiving at times but we see beautiful views from the peaks. I have seen many butterflies this week and at times they fly next to me for several feet.

You can figure out how it got named. It really wasn't that bad since it took 4 miles to reach that elevation. We had some nice switchbacks too that were great. Today I got to enjoy walking thru some pastures which are normally level and no rocks. I believe 4 of my 14.3 miles day were in pastures with several cattle. In one wooded area several cattle were blocking the trail and looking at me, as to say, ""dude go around us"".  No way was I missing a white blaze. The cattle parted to the sides of the trail and kept their eyes on me. A couple of them were having some fun. Today was another water issue day as we ended up hiking 10 miles before a wet stream. I passed the Keffer Oak, largest oak tree on AT in the south, over 18' around and over 300 years old. Tonight I am tenting near Craig Creek Road and it has a slow moving Creek. I had to scoop the water and to make sure I didn't scoop up some of the tadpoles. Rusty from Oklahoma is here too.

Many shots and at times 12-15 pops in quick succession. And three small explosions. It continued until at least 10:00 before I finally gave in to exhaustion. There must have been a gun range up the road. Rusty and I headed up Brush Mountain and not an easy climb. The AT passes thru Jefferson National Park. At the top along the ridge was a bench. I sat down and waited for the bus. U Turn appears and she sits down.  The bus must not run on Saturday's so we headed north along the ridge. LOLWe stop at the Audie Murphy Memorial here on Brush Mountain. For anyone that doesn't know about him (several younger hikers hadn't heard of him). Audie was probably the most decorated soldier during WWII.  He even received the Medal of Honor at 19 years of age. His plane crashed on Brush Mountain in 1971. After the war he became a successful actor in war movies and westerns.  I have watched them many times. Google his bio for the rest of his story.  He was negatively affected by the war. Down Brush Mountain and up Cove Mountain. Now at Dragon Tooth which is a tall rock that is to look like a Tooth. Dragon Tooth is at mile marker 700. Going down Cove Mountain was a scary descent. Nothing but huge cliffs and we had to use our hands and take off our back packs. I met Osprey at the Tooth and we met a day hiker Gloria/ Sherpa.  Osprey and I decided to team up for the descent so we could hand the heavy backpacks to each other. Osprey is 76 and wanted to make it to PA. I just wanted to make it to back to WV in couple of days. Gloria said she would help too. Immediately we had a trail angel. We walk over to the edge and I said a silent prayer for safety and I hear Gloria/Sherpa saying one too. And down we went. It took us probably 30 minutes to descent 100 yards. After that stress, Osprey asks for a 10 minute break. Gloria/Sherpa gives each of us a paper towel soaked in ice water. It felt so good to wipe my face and neck. Then she gives Osprey a bottle of water since he ran out. That left her with 1/2 bottle and she said I could share it if I needed too.  I had 1/2 bottle left for the 2 mile descent to the parking lot so I was good. Now Gloria gets a trail name. She said she would carry Osprey's backpack and he could carry her small Day pack.  So now she gets the name Sherpa. And she doesn't do overnight hiking and she has his 30 lb plus pack on her back. She does workout so that helped her. Like I said a true Trail Angel.  Then she said she would drive Osprey to the Hostel and drop me off at the convenience store. Gloria said she now knows why she was to climb that mountain today. Immediately I got a quart of Gatorade and sweet tea and pizza and ordered a cheeseburger. And later butter pecan waffle cone. And there were about 6 other hikers at the picnic tables that I have seen off and on this week. I decide to walk 0.7 mile along the road to the Hostel to tent in the field there. A car stops and Flatline is in the passenger side and yells get in. We both get dropped off at Hostel. Flatline was looking for Roi but she went on the trail so Flatline got back on the trail. i finally get everything set up after dark and then I realize I didn't get my trekking poles out of that car and I didn't know the driver and Flatline was gone. Decision time for me tomorrow. Goodnight to all. ""Persevere""Mountaineer","Craig Creek Campsite

I was on the trail by 9:00.After about three miles, the clouds opened up and really didn't quit raining the whole day except for a few brief teasing moments.  Going up mountains, it was nothing but streams coming at me.  And the level areas were nothing but puddles so I decided since I was already soaked, just have fun and splash thru it all. At least it was warm enough that I didn't freeze. You couldn't see anything on the mountains due to the fog. On top of one mountain is a strange looking white tower.  It is a navigational system tower that the planes use to verify their navigational systems in the Southeast.  That is why I heard many planes today but I couldn't see them due to the fog. I arrive at the shelter about 2:00 and no one is there. So I remove the wet clothing and hang them and put on my dry sleeping clothes. When you stop hiking, the wet clothes make you freeze now.About an hour later two young men arrive, Curtis from Georgia and the other was from NC. They were SOBO (Southbound) hikers. So now we have more clothes hanging on the line. As it continues to rain, about 6:30 two young female hikers from Wisconsin arrive that are heading NOBO. This is their first day ever hiking. They began about 12:30.  Since it was pouring no one was setting up their tents. So all five of us could fit in the shelter.  We fixed our dinners and then just laid there and watched it rain and traded stories until about 9:00 and tried to sleep. And this place is known for mice.

The two men would be heading southbound and the two sisters northbound.I never saw another hiker until I got to top of Max Patch and there were several tourists there.  They could drive to a parking lot and then walk about half mile to the top.  Since the sky was clear you could see for miles. And the top was just one huge bald with grass.  In the tall grass you could see where bears had been resting at times.  Plus bear scat.  And some berry patches. There wasn't much more to see on the trail today.  The streams were flowing well. If you look at my photos that are posted, you will see two contrasting pictures. One pic shows two half trees being used as a bridge to cross a so called stream about two feet wide that has almost no flow.  And then I walked five feet and here is this overflowing stream without a bridge.  There is a pic of that too.   It just made for a humerous moment.

After a six hour drive down to Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) near Bryson City, NC, I was shuttled north to Fontana Dam Visitor Center. I got on the trail about 1:00 and immediately journeyed up a mountain. A good way to begin a hike and get all heated up even when the temp was about 60.  A good hiking temperature. I didn't see any hikers on my walk to Cable Gap Shelter but I heard the Bear dogs. In NC it was Bear hunting season with dogs. And I know the hunters probably wouldn't hike to the top of the mountains to chase bears so I was thinking the dogs would chase the bears up the mountains. Fortunately I didn't see a Bear today.  The leaves had fallen from most of the trees so part of the trail was slick going down the mountains. It was not an easy 7.1 mile hike since I didn't have hiker legs this time. I arrive at the shelter and there are four hikers already there and they had a fire started.  I am thinking yes a warm fire for the cool evening and someone to chat with this evening. These four were on a section together. Couple of them from Indiana and couple of them from Georgia.  And then here comes three more hikers.  All of the hikers were northbound except for me. We had a great evening sharing stories.

I was on the trail by 7:10 and heading south.  The other hikers would be having a short day going north to Fontana Dam and heading home. At least we don't have to worry hunters today since it is Sunday and no hunting here on Sundays. I did hear that over 200 bears have lost their lives so far in this county. I have seen more squirrels and chipmunks this trip than I have seen anywhere else. There are tons of food for them and the bears this winter. I saw one northbound hiker and one southbound thru hiker today.  The thru hiker hoped to summit Springer Mountain Georgia by Friday and he and his dog Wes will have completed the 2190 mile walk. My goal is to make it about 12 miles to Locust Cove Gap and tent tonight. That would leave me 10 miles on Monday and complete my short section hike.  I get to Locust by 2:00PM and water up from the stream and take a break. Ahead of me is the climb up Cheoah Bald which is a 5,000' elevation. But it is over a 2.5 mile climb.  So I decide to head up the mountain and change my destination to Sassafras Gap Shelter so I will only have 6.7 miles on Monday to my vehicle. It was a long climb but I have climbed higher mountains this year. At the top the views were breath taking but it was windy and cool.  I was drenched in sweat until I summited and then the sweat became ice cold water.  I had to put my jacket on to stay warm. Even in these conditions, hypothermia does happen to hikers. Down the other side of the Bald I arrive at Sassafras Gap Shelter before 5:00 and there is not anyone here yet. And since we just set the clocks back an hour, the sun will set at 5:30. I ate and prepared my bedding for the night. This shelter is a double decker and sleeps 14. The three tent sites are on slopes so I climb up into the upper berth of the shelter and spread out.  There is a great stream about 30 feet from the shelter, so plenty of water. Since it was dark I was in my sack by 6:00 and relaxing.  No one else was there except for couple mice trying to find something to eat. A very long day for me but I felt great knowing Monday would be a short mile day and I would not have to challenge the Bald when I broke camp in the morning. Even when you think you can't go another mile or even another step, we find a way to make it happen. Goodnight to all. Mountaineer""Persevere""","Cable Gap Shelter

But when it is time to get up I am rearing to continue another day on the trail. Shannon shuttled me to Iron Mountain Gap at NOBO mile 364.0 according to 2018 AWOL Guide. I got on the trail at 9:15 and my goal was to make it to Ash Gap Campsite which would be 12.4 miles North.  My training for the last three weeks were 5 miles three days a week and fitness center workouts the other 4 days a week. 
My so called plan is to hike two nights/three days back to Mountain Harbour Hostel B/B which is about 31 miles.
So off I go up a mountain (normal) and it is very windy so I keep my puffy jacket on for the first few miles then take it off and on several times during the day.  It was mostly sunny and windy all day.  The beginning elevation was 3723' and then several ups and downs and eventually to Ash Gap at 5340'. 
There is plenty of water along this trail today due to all of the past rain, so no problem filtering all of the water you need. 
I took my first long break at Clyde Smith Shelter at mile 370.0. It was a great 30 minute break and flowing water there. 
When I made it to Ash Gap Campsite the wind was howling (I wanted to howl back at it, but I couldn't win). I knew it was another 3.6 miles to Roan High Knob Shelter (Elevation 6186').  I am at Ash Gap thinking can I make it to Roan Shelter today and not have to dread the climb on Tuesday morning. And I wouldn't have to set up the tent.  So far I had not anyone on the trail. Well off I go up toward Roan and the trail is primarily rock with water flowing back at me. And I walk around two sections of ice on the trail.  Finally at 4:30 I make it to this Shelter that can sleep 15 people.  It is fully enclosed with a door that you can lock.  This shelter is the highest one on the AT and of course the wind has gusts over 30 MPH. I get settled in and lights out by 7:30 and no one else is here. So a very long 16.0 miles day.  I am very tired but I accomplished more than I thought I could do today

I did here the wind gusts as I was restless but I got enough rest to continue my journey.  I had a cold breakfast and I was not in a hurry to get outside in the fog or clouds this morning.  I was expecting a short day compared to yesterday.  The shelter is nice and is damp in the winter time. I broke camp at 8:30 and I was dressed very warm for the dampness from the fog/clouds and I headed north. This time I actually was heading down hill. The trail is rocky and water flowing everywhere and a couple places were icy on the descent. Later today I would be climbing Little Hump Mountain and Hump (Big) Mountain. After the hike yesterday I was expecting an easier one today. As I arrive at Carvers Gap, it is foggy and as I climb I am in a cloud.  No views from Carvers Gap this morning.  Before noon the fog is gone and the blue sky is a very welcome sight.  The puffy jacket comes off, gloves off and the toboggan. The big climb today was Grassy Ridge Bald at 5899'.  I stop at Stan Murray Shelter for a snack.  This shelter has a new floor and the trail goes within ten feet of it. The next shelter would be the Overmountain Shelter but since I stopped at Stan Murray I bypassed this one since it is 0.3 off the trail. It is a converted barn as you can see in the pic.  Now it is time to climb Little Hump Mountain.  The pic of the barn/shelter is taken as I climb Little Hump. The trail up Little Hump is primarily a field up the mountain. There are some great views from here. When you arrive at the summit you can look north and see the taller Hump Mtn. Of course, I had to hike down Little Hump before I climb Big Hump. It was great to know that the two big climbs were completed for the day.  It was great to have a snack at the summit and enjoy the sun and the views.  I knew the next 3.0 miles were down hill to the main highway US 19E and where Mountain Harbour Hostel is located and my car. I begin my descent which is very rocky for about the first mile.  I reach Doll Flats which is at the official NC-TN border NOBO.  That is the end of NC for anyone NOBO and now you are back in TN.  This is a great campsite and room for at least 10 tents and all flat and surrounded by farmland. I was only 0.7 mile from the main highway so I continue north to my vehicle. Today I saw two day hikers, one heading north and one south. There was plenty of water to filter today. It was another long day of 14.8 miles and an excellent day.  So rather than three days on the trail, I go home a day early and complete my 30.8 miles trip. This was definitely a great training session for me.  I need to cut back on the miles when I head back to the trail in couple weeks and add a couple of days to my hike. So long for now and I hope to see you on the trail. Mountaineer""Persevere""","Roan High Knob Shelter

The limbs are huge and no way for me to climb over or pick my way through the limbs.  I get this smart idea that I will hike uphill to the roots and go around the monster.  As I get back on the trail by the tree, I trip and fall forward.  Thankfully my two hands and one of my knees catch me from a face first.  Eventually after 10.6 Miles I make it to Jerry Cabin Shelter and I am hoping there is room in there for me so I don’t have to mess with setting up the tent in the rain and dealing with it in the morning.  The shelter holds 6 and there is one left for me.  Yeah.  In there is Noodles, Happy Feet from Seattle, Giggles from New Mexico, Sparrow, and Moonshine from WV.  Now we have two Mountaineers here.  Noodles plays the song Country Roads and all six of us begin singing the song.

She also asks us our trail name, state we are from and where we started our hike.  Sam’s Gap is only 2.4 miles from the shelter last night and since it is early, foggy and a little cool I am wearing my puffy.  When I get to the Gap I remove my puffy and put it on the fence post since I am too warm now.  More about this brilliant maneuver later.Now it is time to begin a 6.5 miles climb up Big Bald going from elevation 3724’ to 5516’ to the summit.  There are some ups and downs along the way.  It is not that tough of an elevation climb based on the mileage.  Anyways, I will still be taking my short breaks along the climb.  I reach the summit and it is still foggy and the sun is doing its best to disappear the fog.  I can see the fog moving past me at a rapid speed. No photo ops at this time of day.  Now it is time to descend and about a mile later I slide down the trail on my back.  No one is around to score my slide technique. I forgot to mention that most of the trail is still a muddy mess but the sun and wind are working together to dry out the trail. As I am taking another short break, I see Short Sticks and she stops and says, “Mountaineer, I believe I have your jacket that was left at Sam’s Gap.”  Elmo Pantry stated she thought it belonged to Mountaineer and Short Sticks carried it to me.  The best trail magic I have received since we need warmth on this chilly nights. I would not have missed the puffy until I reach Camp.I reach  Bald Mountain Shelter about 1:25 and decide to take a break until 2:00 and have lunch. A couple of other hikers are here that passed me today and they will continue to hike 20 miles today so they will have only 6 miles left to get to Erwin on Saturday.  One of the churches in Erwin is providing a free hikers feast.  Based on the comments I heard last night at the shelter about 10 of them were going for a 20 mile day.A few minutes later here comes Noodles and he plans to just stay this shelter tonight and rest his knee.  This will give him a 10 mile day.  I have seen him the last three days.  I reach Whistling Gap about 3:00 and the stream is flowing so I water up and decide to hike on to Spivey Gap where there are several places to tent and a stream flows by the site. This will add 2.2 miles to my day making it 15.8 miles and leaving me only 11.1 miles on Saturday to reach Erwin.I arrive at Spivey Gap and here is Sparrow and another hiker I have seen this week.  There is Johnny Appleseed that is hiking SOBO.  They have a campfire going so I go ahead and find me a flat spot near some bushes by the stream and set up my tent.  I head back to the campfire and eat dinner and chat with the other hikers.  At 7:30 I head to my tent since I am tired.  I sleep better in my tent vs the shelters so I am expecting a good nights sleep.Mountaineer“Persevere”","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Moonshine didn’t begin his hike as early as them from Whistling. That was the last time I saw them since they are many years younger than me and have thru hiker legs now. The trail is nice and dry today.  There are several streams along the trail today for the first 5 Miles.  The last 6 miles do not have any water on the trail. So we make sure we drink as much as we can hold and then fill up our bottles and march onward to Erwin.Today I officially meet Toastie and Goodwood on the trail.

My goal was 12 miles and stealth camp by the river.  After 10 miles, I made it to Mountaineer Shelter (what a name coincidence) to have my lunch at noon.  There were five males hiking together south that were going to stay one more night at the shelter and hike south tomorrow.  There was a lady hiker staying there and she was heading north.  She was here on a Visa and had a few weeks left before she had to fly to Europe. As I was finishing my lunch, the other hiker arrived to have lunch. I was surperised he had not passed me by now with his thru hiker legs. I told him I may camp by the river and save the last mountain climb for tomorrow and he was going to go the distance to 19E. I made it to the river about 1:30 and decided I would try to hike the additional 6 miles and head home a day early. So up I go the last mountain of the day but just a 1000’ climb over couple miles.  Actually it was an easy climb. I never did see the other hiker again  I completed the 18.4 miles and it felt great to push myself beyond my goal for the day and still have a great time walking on the trail.  I did see two hikers heading north over the last six miles. Sometimes it is very easy not to enjoy the beauty of the trail if we push for too many miles.  It no longer is a walk but a race to whatever our goal may be out here.  It was a nice safe 4 hour drive home and I am thankful for the opportunity to be out here one more time. Mountaineers Forever “Persevere”","Moreland Gap Shelter

And a great view from here. I didn’t see any bears or poisonous snakes today.  Like I say, we never know what was looking at us. I did see one 5’ black snake right on the trail. It had its head in a small hole on the trail as if it was looking for a meal in the hole. I walked around it and said, “have a great lunch”.I finished about 4:00 and it was a great miles day for 8 hours and I still got to enjoy the walk.  The long descent made up for the climb up Unaka Mtn. And I also had an orange for my lunch.

We didn’t get on the trail until about 10:45 after being shuttled from Daleville.  We were at the shelter by 4:00 and decided to shelter rather than set up the tent. We did receive some trail magic in the parking lot that leads to the Trailhead to McAfee Knob.  Dinah, a member of the local AT club provides info on the climb and had some nice treats.  She stated they are very active at the lot to see if Day hikers are taking water with them.  The emergency services is providing many rescues on that trail due to hikers thinking they can hike 8 RT miles without water.  
When we arrived Tinman from NYC was here with a hiking friend.  A few others arrived with about 10 setting up tents and five of us in the shelter.  Notes and her hiking buddy and Waldo the dog were here.  We had conversations until about 9:00 and no matter when it is sleep time on the trail I don’t sleep well.

The first time for Cody on the AT. Our hike, as usual, began with a climb but only 500’ over two miles, so easy compared to many of my hikes. The temp was 55 degrees and by end of day it would be 85 degrees. After three miles we pay our respect to Nick “Hermit” Grindstaff’s Monument.  He was a legend and one of the stories says he was a hermit and he had traveled out West and struck gold but on his way home he was robbed.  He built a small cabin on this spot and he had a pet rattle snake in the rafters.  Supposedly the snake bit him and he died.  He “lived alone, suffered alone and died alone”.Throughout the day we only saw about 11 hikers.  We stopped at Iron Mtn Shelter for our first break and no one was there.  There are not any big climbs today but many PUDS (Pointless Ups and Downs).  Our next break was at Vandevanter Shelter and we met Beast.

Immediately we begin to cross flowing springs and a creek.  So it wasn’t any problem finding water today. There wasn’t much to see as far as views today.  After the 600’ descent, we have a 600’ ascent.  We pass by the Scales Livestock Corral.  We see about six hikers today going SOBO. Our last three miles was nothing but big rocks and some were very sharp.  There was so much pressure on the feet due to the steep descent and the rocky trail.  We did find bushes and bushes of berries today.  Most of them weren’t ripe yet but we enjoyed the blackberries that were ripe  We make it to our vehicle about 3:00 and head for Damascus. We decided to stay here tonight rather than camp and enjoy this small town that has the Creeper Trail and the AT going through it.  We stayed at the Dancing Bear Inn.  There is not a two night minimum here and Elizabeth is a wonderful person.  An excellent room with a private bath.  We decided to eat at Damascus Diner and it was a great choice.   So much food for a nominal price.  Golden Bear got this huge meatloaf sandwich and tator tots. I got the Angus Cheesburger and fries.   Our next stop was a walk down to Wicked Chicken for ice cream and then we walked back to the Inn.  It was very good day.Mountaineer and Golden Bear“Persevere”","Massie Gap

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630005,"After we had our breakfast, we drove to  Beech Mtn Rd trailhead and parked and Barbara picked us up at 7:15 and dropped us at Elk Garden trailhead.  We were on the trail by 7:45. Now it was time to hike south today.  We would start with a 850’ climb over the next 1.7 miles to the top of White Top Mountain. It actually was a gradual walk up the mountain.  It seemed easier than our shorter climb yesterday. There was only one slow moving stream along the climb to the top of the mountain. We only saw two hikers on our climb but we saw about six hikers camping on the mountain.  And there is a spring on the mountain that was flowing. Since we had a short day we wouldn’t need to filter any water today.  There were many blueberry bushes on the mountain.  And the berries were tasty. Now we are walking along the ridge and we see Buzzard Rock in the distance with a white blaze painted on it.  Golden Bear decides to walk across the top of the rock to its peak and take a break. We had some very nice pics from there.  After our break we descended almost 1600’ feet over 2.5 miles.  Almost all of it was sharp rocks and steep.  Really rough on the knees and on the feet.  We see a few hikers heading up the mountain and we were thankful we were going down no matter how we felt. We didn’t see one reliable stream going down the mountain. We made it to our vehicle before 11:00 and we headed home.  Even though it was a short day, we were happy we got some miles in today.  Now we have to determine when we can hike again and what part of VA we want to walk. Mountaineer and Golden Bear“Persevere”","Elk Garden - VA 600

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631757,"Cody (Long Stride) and I (Mountaineer) decided to squeeze in a long day hike.  During this hike, Cody finally got a trail name. He is tall and is a long distance mom trail runner and his stride makes two of mine.  Unless I stay ahead of him, he will be out of sight within minutes. When we get to blow downs, he just strides over them.  And I am there trying to figure out can I get across it or have to walk around it.  But I am glad he finally got a trail name.  We parked at Fox Creek and Barbara picked us up and shuttled us north to South Fork Holston River. Barbara has shuttled me three times and she is always a few minutes early.  And her prices are very reasonable.Today we started off with a long climb of 4.6 miles with an elevation change of about 1300’.  You would think that would be an easy climb over 4.6 miles but we had the usual PUDS so an up and down climb.  Now it was time for a 3.5 miles descent of only 700’.   Most of the time we enjoy the descent but there are times the descents really affect the knees if the descent is too steep.  Today it was good.  There have been many times I would rather have had an uphill walk rather than some bad descents.  And usually you don’t have face plants when you go uphill. At times we have had problems finding water but today all of the streams were flowing well and we could get water every couple miles if we wanted it.  Long Stride calls me a camel at times because I don’t drink enough water and nature doesn’t call me very often.  We came upon a bridge at Comers Creek Falls that was to be out of order due to some structure problem but we crossed it one at a time and had no problem.  The falls was gushing as you can see in the photo.  Today we only saw four hikers and no unusual animals and no bears. At Comers Falls, this black large animal came around a bush in front of us and for about three seconds I thought it was a bear.  It was a huge Great Dane.  Long Stride first thought was we were dead.  I happened to be in the lead at the time. Even though it was only 13.8 miles it still tires me out.  But it was still a great hike.Mountaineer and Long Stride“Persevere”","VA 670 South Fork Holston River

WE NOW HAD 2.5 MILES DESCENT TO JENKINS SHELTER TO STOP FOR LUNCH.  IT WAS A GREAT BREAK AND THEN WE CAMEL UP AT A CREEK ABOUT 200 YARDS FURTHER UP THE TRAIL. AND AS US WALKERS KNOW, DOWNHILL THEN MEANS ANOTHER UPHILL CLIMB. IT WAS ACTUALLY A STEEP CLIMB UP BUT WE HAD A GREAT SURPRISE AT THE TOP. THE TRAIL WAS NOW ON AN OLD ROAD THAT WAS WIDE ENOUGH FOR A BUS IF YOU COULD MISS THE TREES. FOR OVER A MILE WE ENJOYED A FLAT TRAIL. AND THEN A NICE DESCENT TO LAUREL CREEK.  LAUREL CREEK HAD NICE LOW WIDE FALLS. THERE IS A ROAD AND A SMALL PARKING AREA THERE. WE WALKED ANOTHER QUARTER MILE TO A SMALL CAMP SITE THAT HAD A PICNIC TABLE AND A FEEDER STREAM INTO LAUREL CREEK. IT WAS JUST US THREE THERE.  WE GOT OUR TENTS SET UP AND THEN GOLDEN BEAR AND KURT BEGAN WORKING ON A CAMPFIRE WHILE I GATHERED FIREWOOD.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659412,We finally found a weekend for a section hike. Kurt (no trail name yet) and myself (Mountaineer) drove south to Bear Garden Hostel area to park our vehicle and Bubba shuttled us north to VA623.  Our goal today was to hike only 8 miles south to the pond and camp since there is water. The first 5 miles were rather flat and rocky in a few spots and then a short climb up to Chestnut Knob Shelter. The inside of the shelter looked dark and damp since it was a block building and had a door. Recent posts stated couple black snakes hang out there at times.  There was a privy behind the shelter and no need to use one yet. There was great view from here down into the valley as you can see in the photos. So far we had only seen two hikers today. After a nice food break we continued our hike down to the pond. We arrived rather early here so we decided to continue south since it was primarily down hill. We were not sure how far we would go until we camp.  We arrive at Lick Creek Campsite around 3:30 and call it a day.  It was an enjoyable hike and arriving early we set up camp and relaxed. Kurt has his hammock up quickly and decides to take a nap.  We eventually built a fire at the nice fire ring and great logs to sit on. This creek was about 4 inches deep today but sometimes after a big rain the water could be waist high and that is why there was a nice bridge here before it was washed out by a flood. The remains of the bridge could be seen.  Someone had installed a line across the creek to hold onto while crossing.  Later on in the evening someone camped a little down stream from us. At about 9:00 it was time for sleep.  Mountaineer and Kurt“Persevere”,"VA623

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659413,"Last night was an uneventful night. No loud noises, just a soothing stream rippling by the camp.  Today would be a shorter day of about 6 miles and an elevation climb of 800’ to Brushy Mountain and then a one mile descent to our vehicle. We only saw one hiker today and we passed by Knot Maui Branch Shelter. The trail terrain was not a factor. We were at our car before noon and at Bland DQ shortly afterwards for lunch and then on toward our homes. Another great weekend to be back to nature.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659508,"Uncle Judge and I decided to take on a section hike today and tomorrow.  On our way South, we had a flat tire that had to be replaced and delayed our journey by two hours. But so what, we knew soon we would be back on the AT so our plan was not in jeopardy. Dawn would be our shuttle driver today and she met us at Settlers Museum in Atkins, VA and shuttled us North to the Davis Cemetery. The trail was hiker friendly and that was great due to the Nicole storm passing through the area.  We visited the Lindamood School House after our hike and that was where we saw our only hiker today. Now it was time for our short drive to the Long Neck Lair hostel where we would stay tonight in the bunkhouse. The owner has an Alpaca Farm here. This was a wonderful bunkhouse and the owner was wonderful.  There was another hiker staying there tonight and he was from France and had been on trail for six months. He began in Canada and will finish in Florida. He made French coffee for us tonight. Uncle Judge and I had dinner at Sweet Water Diner. 
Tonight Uncle Judge made his remarkable hot chocolate which contained his secret ingredients. It is now 9PM and hikers midnight for me while Uncle Judge and the Frenchman continued their conversation and eating their cinnamon rolls and drinking their hot chocolate.

Mountaineers Forever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659510,"Last night was cold, windy and raining and it felt great to be in the bunkhouse rather than in a tent on the trail. Today we had an eight mile hike and the first four miles would be an 800’ elevation climb. This morning we parked again at Settlers Museum and Carrie was our shuttle driver. She drove us to VA622 so we could hike North. We reached the peak of Glade Mountain after the four miles. The terrain wasn’t rocky until we reached the peak and we had a half mile hike along the ridge. We had a great view of Walker Mountain in the far distance. Now we had a descent of 500’ over the last four miles. There were a couple of steep declines. The last mile we had at least four streams to cross and only one had two logs for a crossing. Due to the Nicole storm the stream was higher than normal so we did our best of rock hopping but we did get wet but we didn’t fall into the stream. It did create some small waterfalls. We took a small break at the Chatfield Shelter to consume some snacks and I finally drank some of my Gatorade. Also we did change socks before the last crossing. Today we didn’t see any hikers. We head home after two days of fun hiking on the AT.  We have one more stop to make and it is the DQ in Bland, VA. Mountaineer and Uncle Judge“Persevere”","VA622
