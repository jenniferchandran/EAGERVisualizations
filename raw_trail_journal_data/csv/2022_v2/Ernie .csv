On 27 April, I’ll be starting my attempt to hike all 2194 miles of the Appalachian Trail (the AT) in the USA.
In 1921, Benton Mackaye a utopian socialist, set out a vision for a continuous wilderness trail with rural  community retreats. Whilst the trail got made and is maintained by hiking clubs along the trail, there are no rural community retreats for frazzled east coast workers as Mackaye hoped. But there is a network of more than 300 three sided wooden shelters along the trail, to support people to backpack and camp out. This is what makes the trail unique for a brit like me, as hikers on the AT are actively encouraged to wild camp and supported to do so at shelters, that are often close to water sources and sometimes have the luxury of composting loos.


Wild camping away from the shelters is also allowed on most parts of the trail, and this is called ‘stealth camping’.  My plan is to camp most nights, carrying 3/4 days food with me and checking into a hostel or campground with showers about once a week to freshen up. 


Walking the entire trail in less than twelve months is called a thru hike and those that attempt it are known as thru-hikers.  
I am beginning my thru-hike from Harpers Ferry in West Virginia, roughly in the middle of the AT and walking north for just under 1200 miles to Mount Katahdin in Maine.   If all goes to plan, I’ll return to Harpers Ferry and walk south for 1000 miles or so to Springer Mountain in Georgia to complete my thru hike.  


Starting in the middle of the AT and walking north and then retuning to walk south is known as a Flip Flop thru hike, so I will soon be an AT Thru Hike Flip Flopper Class of 2022!!!


There are a few big benefits to flip flop hiking the AT: potentially kinder weather; a relatively easy first few hundred miles; and avoiding the northbound ‘bubble’ of thru hikers who start in Georgia in March/April.
The down sides to flip flopping are mainly psychological - I will not be walking north in one continuous line towards my goal, and the earliest starting and/or fastest hiking north bounders (nobos) will pass me more than half way through their thru hike when I have barely started mine. 


I hope to complete the AT within 6 months, walking an average of 15 miles a day for 150 days and taking up to 30 rest/travel days.  That’s the strategic plan, but I have absolutely no day to day plans. I’ll just start walking and take it from there…",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Sat",0
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648925,"Hiking the AT - Hopes and Fears


I’m walking the AT simply because it exists and I can afford the time. I enjoy hiking and it’s great physical and mental exercise.  I love the simplicity of the daily routine of walk, set up camp, sleep, pack up camp, walk, set up camp etc.  It’s a flow activity that allows me to completely tune out from the demands and complexities of modern life, which feels like the ultimate luxury. 


I’ve also started to take great enjoyment from feeling like (a tiny inconsequential) part of the chaotically beautiful natural world.  And I hope spending 6 months in the wilderness might help me further along this mentally peaceful and relaxing path. 


Long distance hiking has a particular appeal for me in that - whilst let’s be honest, it is just walking - it tests psychological resilience  and provides a tough challenge but one that is in theory achievable for someone of my age and health.  It’s something to do, and a lovely rest from having to answer questions about purposeful or productive activity. I am walking, and tomorrow I am walking and the next day and the next…


My hopes for my AT adventure are to: 


enjoy going with the flow and not making plans beyond the simple goal of walking 2194 milesbe grateful for everything the trail provides and take pleasure in getting through the rough stuff I know it will throw at me. (I have a wry smile ready and waiting.)Be a good role model for my two adult sons: to live freely, independently and to choose their own paths; and being aware that the best achievements in life bringing the most joy also require resilience and hard work; and that this makes the joy even brighter.  (Family perhaps being the best example of this!) 


I also have some fears:


I lack the physical or mental strength to walk 2194 milesI start over-planning and getting anxious about making it to town, buying food, having a shower etc and don’t just enjoy the joy of plodding along in the wild. I get bitten by a snake or eaten by a bear!


Mainly, I’m desperate to start walking as my anxieties get worse every day now. It’s been good to get away for this week to Crete with Fi, my wife. Otherwise, I’d have been packing and unpacking my backpack 5-10 times a day or sleeping in my tiny tent in the garden…",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Sat",0
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649323,"AT Gear List
What do you carry on your back to walk snail-like for 2194 miles and camp out most nights for 6 months?  The answer is as little as possible, with a few luxury items to boost morale.
Last year, I tried and tested most of the clothing and gear I am taking on the AT on two long hikes of the Pennine Way and the Coast to Coast walk.  And that leads to my top tip if you ever fancy backpacking a long trail.  Online reviews and youtube videos can teach you a lot, but not as much as testing your gear out on a 2 or 3 day hiking expedition.  What suits the majority of hikers might not work for you.  The warmth and comfort you need to stay positive might be a tad higher than the young fit person who can walk 20+ miles every day.  And the hiking shoes that lots of people love may just be plain wrong for your feet.
My fully packed rucksack/backpack weighs 9.5kg before food and water.  Not ultralight by any means, but lightweight with just enough comfort for me.  Here’s my full gear list.
Rucksack/Backpack
Sierra Designs Flex Capacitor 40-60 litre.  Lightweight with a wide hip belt, adjustable volume and a Y shaped internal suspension frame that keeps weight on your shoulders and waist and ensures airflow on the back.  More expensive ultralight frameless backpacks are available but I prefer the carrying comfort and storage options of this pack. My 3 part rain protection system is: pack cover outside; heavy duty black bin bag inside; and separate waterproof sacks for clothing, sleeping bag, electronics etc.
On my feet 
Altra Olympus trail shoes.  Don’t be tempted to use your ‘trusty walking boots’ for a long distance hike.  After 2 or 3 days of 15 miles plus a day your feet will swell and your old boots will likely give you painful blisters.  I wore Altra Lone Peak’s with their ‘zero drop’ and ‘big toe box’ - half a size up from my usual size -.and they worked perfectly on the Pennine Way and the Coast to Coast.  My feet were fine with no blisters.  For the AT, I’ve gone with the Altra Olympus as they have more cushioning than the Lone Peak’s and I find them easier on my knees, particularly for extended rock, road or gravel path walking. 
Darn Tough socks.  I’ll be taking 3 pairs of Darn Tough midweight ‘socks.  My shoes are super quick to dry but they aren’t waterproof so I regularly change my socks and put the damp ones on the back of my pack to dry.  One pair is for sleeping in if it’s cold enough and only for walking use in emergency during very wet weather. 

Crocs.  I’ve been undecided between bulky comfy crocs and some ultra light and packable sandals.  Comfort has won out for this trip and I’m going with the Crocs.
Top tip for keeping feet happy is to take your shoes and socks off and take the insoles out of your shoes every break, even if it’s just for 10-15 minutes.  Your feet will thank you. 

On my legs 
Patagonia Nine Trails shorts, which have mesh liners.  These are super comfy to walk in and they have good odour control, which is important as I’m only taking one pair!
Alpkit Koulin Trail tights, which I’ll wear under my shorts on colder days or if I want to protect my legs from tall grass, biting insects etc
Decathlon MT500 trekking trousers.  I’ve had these for years.  Less than £30 and they are lightweight, stretchy and fantastically quick to dry.  I’m taking one pair of Rab Forge Boxers to wear under these.  
Having a second walking option is a luxury but I like having trousers for days. I want to completely protect my legs (e.g. from sun, insects), and for looking a bit more human when travelling and in trail towns.
I’m taking a Rain Kilt, which is lighter and less sweaty than rain trousers. 
TopsI’ve got a 5 layer system that works for me.  Never needed to wear all of these layers at once, but I like the flexibility these choices give me.
Patagonia capilene t-shirt.  These are expensive but the one I am taking has survived 3 years of hiking and it’s still in shape and it doesn’t smell. Result!
Rab Capacitor light mid layer.  This is a light and stretchy technical ‘waffle’ mid layer that’s great for cold mornings and/or altitude and I love the thumb loops.  On very cold days it’s a warm base layer.
Rab Vital windshell jacket.  This is paper thin, ultralight, good value for money at £25 and it gives great protection from the wind.  I often wear it over just my t-shirt, for example when wind is chilly or temperature drops at altitude but I’m working hard hiking uphill and a mid layer would be too hot.  Over the light rab mid layer and the t-shirt, I’m good to hike in wind chill temperatures close to freezing (as long as it’s not raining or snowing as this jacket is water resistant but not waterproof).  

Decathlon warm midlayer.  I added this warmer synthetic fleece to my kit recently to put on when I stop for a break or when it’s very cold (i.e. near or below freezing).  On UK walks, I’ve relied on a down puffy jacket as an extra warm layer and for breaks.  But on the AT, I want to be sure to keep my puffer dry and warm for camp in the evening. If I get this synthetic top wet whilst hiking I’ll still have the dry puffer for camp and this synthetic top should dry quickly to hike in the next day. 

Mountain Equipment Lhotse rain jacket.  No jacket is fully waterproof through a whole day of torrential rain but some jackets are much more waterproof than others!!  This jacket was expensive (over £300) and is relatively heavy for long distance thru hiking but for my peace of mind I like having a jacket that feels bomb proof in heavy rain and wind.
Decathlon merino scarf (a buff), a merino trekking headband and merino gloves.  The buff is great for keeping heat in the body on windy/cold days and the headband is mainly to stop my earpods falling out of my ears!!  Cheap as chips too.

As a little luxury, I’m taking a Columbia hiking shirt. I like a cool shirt with long sleeves and collar for super hot days or when there’s loads of midges or other bitey things. Paired with the hiking trousers it’s useful for travelling and for town.
Headwear 
A  light and foldable wide brimmed floppy sun hat with a chin cord that I’ve worn on all the long trails I’ve hiked.  It looks ridiculous but only cost a tenner from Millets and it does the job on the sunniest and windiest days.  Also, works well under my rain jacket hood to keep rain off my glasses.  Winner! 
Smartwool 150 merino beanie for cold days, nights and when exposed at altitude.
Sleepwear

Millets North Ridge merino long johns - cheap and warm
Patagonia long sleeve capilene t shirt 
Plus, one of the pairs of Darn Tough socks if it’s cold enough to need them
Camping 
Lanshan 1 tent with 8 pegs and a compression bag.  It’s cheap, weighs less than a kilo and it’s big enough to sleep in!  I’ll probably invest in a Lanshan 2 Pro before my wife joins me for a few weeks in August and perhaps use that for my last 3 months on trail.Thermarest ZLite Sol sleeping pad.  Slept on this enough to know that it works for me as a side sleeper. It’s cheap and I can’t be arsed with blowing up an expensive ultralight air pad after a long day hiking, or listening to it rustle below me all night!
ZPacks 20F (-6) down sleeping quilt.  I spent over £300 on this quilt with a sewn toe box from Zpacks in the USA.  It’s packed with lots of down, it’s super light for the warmth rating and most importantly it’s toasty at night. Has its own waterproof stuff sack to keep it dry.
Decathlon Forclaz MT100 puffer down jacket.  Great value down puffy for less than £50 that puts the Patagonia, Rab, North Face et al competition to shame on quality/price. All it lacks is the logo, otherwise it’s a great piece of kit.  Worn mine for more than 3 years now in camp and on chilly evenings and it’s one of my favourite bits of kit.  Go buy one! 
Cooking

Alpkit 650ml MytiMug titanium cook pot
Mini gas stove (unbranded, tiny and cost about a tenner)
Long titanium spork - to reach the bottom of dehydrated food pouches
Sea to Summit collapsible mug for morning coffee and afternoon tea
Sea to Summit 14ltr waterproof food bag (plus throw rope for bear bag hanging)
Sawyer Mini water filter for filtering water from springs and streams on the trail
2ltr Cnoc water bladder (fits the sawyer filter) for collecting spring/river water
1 ltr and a 0.5ltr water bottles for carrying clean drinking water.
Other gear

First Aid Kit; prescription meds, paracetamol, naproxen, imodium, rennie, wound wipes/dressings, blister tape, plasters, eye drops, sting cream, vaseline and a bandage.

Loo Kit: trowel, loo paper, mini bidet (!), composting wipes

Wash Bag: towel, comb, victorinox nail clippers, toothbrush and paste, anti bac gel

Electronics: IPhone13 mini, Kindle, PowerBank, Earpods, Headtorch, 2x charging leads

Bug head net for when midges are out in force

Swiss army knife, includes tweezers (for ticks) and scissors.
Compass and Guide Book, for back up navigation if phone dies…
Spares and repairs:  rope, paracord, carabiner, washers, duct tape, seam sealer

And finally my 0.5kg extra luxury item, a Helinox Zero chair.  Hideously expensive at £99 (now £124!) but oh so comfortable and relaxing to sit in, particularly for an older person with creaking joints.  Everyone laughs that I carry it and all are jealous when they see me sitting in it making coffee or reading my kindle.
This all adds up to about 9.5kg as my base weight.  I’ll also be carrying enough food for 3 or 4 days plus 1.5kg/ltrs of water.  So my total pack weight will be something like 12.5kg or 25lbs.  I can carry this comfortably and, for me, this is the right balance between going lightweight and being comfortable.  As the weather warms up, I will send some of my warmer layers up the trail in a US Postal service ‘bounce box’ or swap out some items, such as my heavy ME rain jacket for a lighter weight Patagonia Torrentshell.
AT hikers pack their fears and soon send unused clothes and gear home. That’s probably going to be true for me too.  I’ll update this list as the weeks and months pass on the trail. But this is the stuff coming on the plane to the USA with me!",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Thu",0

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649854,"Out of the blocks


I was so anxious to start I had a flashback memory to 11 years old standing on the start line of a 1500m. That was only 5 minutes of hell in front of me but this hike is going to be 6 months. That said, I do only have to walk every day and how hard can that be?


I had to wait until 9 for the ATC office to open to pick up my thru hiker tag - I’m 120 of this year’s flip floppers.  The tag identifies me as a thru hiker even though I’m yet to walk a mile!


What would have been a dull flat walk was enlivened by terrapins, orioles and some small yellow and black birds that kept me company. 


A climb up to the ridge gave me my first taste of real AT hiking in the woods. It’s a great time to start as trees are budding their first soft green leaves and wild violets are everywhere. 


After 10 miles I stopped for lunch by Gaitland State Park rest rooms. There was also a bench and electric sockets.  A couple of other flip floppers come thru but they were keen to push on. I ate my lunch and treated myself to a tumeric tea. 


One of the hikers who passed me looked familiar - someone called Steve who I’d chatted to online. I know he is 66 so I was shocked to see him swiftly stride across the meadow and uphill at great pace, like a Gazelle.  As I have got to know Steve a bit I suggested this as his trail name and after some reflection he accepted it. 


I caught Steve up later in the afternoon whilst he was taking a break. And we walked together to the camp ground.  It had flat pitches and showers. Shame the rest room had no heat as it was cold as hell when I got out of my shower.  And don’t get me started on my paper thin ultralight towel, that would fail any trade description case.  


Cold first night about 34F but my bag kept me warm.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649869,"It was bitterly cold when I woke up about 6am.  So I decided to go make my morning coffee in the camp restrooms. Not heated but a few degrees warmer than outside. Only 3 men in tents at the site so I thought the ladies restroom would be a good hideaway.  Surprised by a mystery woman who was just leaving - who explained that she had slept on the floor in the loo all night rather than brave her tent!


Options for the day were shelters at 14 or 19 miles.  I decided to make my mind up depending on what time I got to the first shelter and how I was feeling. 


Early on I walked with Steve/Gazelle and we took in the  original Washington monument together.  After about 9 miles I stopped by a spring to collect water and eat lunch while Gazelle pushed on. 


I had a great late morning/early afternoon for the next 5 miles or so. Saw (and got some video of) some white tailed deer, more Orioles, and some big colourful butterflies. There’s a white wild flower with a tiny yellow centre which is coming out in abundance all along the trail here. Mixed with lots of wild violets and the occasional early vivid pink rhododendron it was every thing I’d hoped from the trail, a wild woodland idyll.  


I got to the shelter at 14 miles after a sharp and rocky up and down that sapped my legs and spirit.  It was only 2.30pm so I decided to push on.  But not before I took a 30 minute nap!  Steve was at the shelter when I got there and he hiked on while I napped. 


It was a tough last 5 miles, with lots of rocky sections both up and down that slowed me down to a careful plod.  No water at the shelter I was heading for meant I had to pick up 2 litres in my bladder from the cascade spring about .7 mile downhill from the shelter.  Carrying the bladder and my backpack meant that the .7mile took me an age at crawling pace, a struggle to put one foot over another on a steep rocky climb.  


It was worth the effort as the shelter was sociable with plenty of grim humour about the impending cold night. And I spent my first night in a 3 sided AT shelter, lying on the wooden floor in my sleeping bag on my foam pad with 4 other hikers. A very cold 29F/-1C night was bearable though getting up to take a pee it two was no fun!


A big (for me) 19 mile day. Another great day on the AT.","Dahlgreen state campground

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649874,"The day started at 6 with a coffee to warm up. Then to the privy for my constitutional.  The privy had no front door so I got to poop with a view.  I had two visits in quick succession. I may not buy the backpackers pantry pad Thai again!!
Despite being up first, it was Gazelle who packed and left first, followed by me and then Dave/Rootfinder, another flip flopper hiking similar miles a day. The first few hours out of camp were stunning - bright and cold, and I kept a good few layers on and zipped along to warm up. I saw a Giant Woodpecker and heard quite a few more, so loud like cartoon woodpeckers, or err woodpeckers. Five miles in marked the end of Maryland and the beginning of Pennsylvania.  After a fruitless search for water at Pen Mar Park, I crossed a train track and arrived at the Mason-Dixie Line. Got a passing hiker to take my photo and headed on another 2.5 miles to find a creek where I finally got some water. After another rocky  up and down, I reached 8 miles for the day and a bench by a creek (and a busy road) where I had lunch with Solo another flip flopper who was there before me, and Rootfinder who arrived just after. The next 5 miles were the nicest on the trail so far, easy rolling hiking, few rocks and lush forest. I stopped for a nap in Forge Park at the 12.2 mile mark. And then cantered up the hill to Tumbling Run shelter. I decided to sleep in the shelter as it uses minimum effort (no tent to pitch and take down).  I am finally up to date with these journals. Planning a short 10 mile day and trip into Fayetteville to a Hostel with showers and laundry.  I stink..","Raven Rock Shelter
",Tumbling Run Shelter,"Apr 29, Fri",13.20
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649981,"Woke on floor of shelter about 6 as usual - same routine: unhook bear bag from wire, make coffee, visit privy, eat breakfast bar and pack up. As usual that took about 2 hours. So I was out of camp just before 8. My plan was to hike the 10 miles to town as quickly as possible without stopping because the promise of late breakfast or early lunch at a Rutters gas station with a diner was huge motivation. 
The only real test of the day was the first 1.2 miles or so up Chimney Rock which was steep and rocky in places, but nothing to dampen my early morning enthusiasm with hot food on the horizon  
On another cold bright morning, perfect for walking, I zipped along passing a few locals and a couple of hikers who’d left camp before me  
The first person I saw on trail was a hunter in full camouflage with a big gun. I would have been alarmed if a trail volunteer hadn’t visited the shelter to warn us that Turkey Hunting season opened this week. I was excessively polite and asking whether he’d had any luck when I realised that my shouting ‘good morning and any luck so far’ was unlikely to improve his chances as any turkey in earshot would be long gone. Though whether wild turkeys break into a jog or attempt flight or just look surprised when faced with a hunter I’m not sure. 
I had just realised what wild sticking up hair I had after 3 days without a shower and wearing a beanie and sun hat when I caught up with another thru hiker, Bubbles. With the sun behind me, the silhouette of my head looked like Ernie from Sesame Street. And after some discussion with Bubbles and Early Riser later in the day that is now my trail name.  Ernie. 
After a scrambling rock section that I had a little trouble navigating, I met a woman with two young boys out for a hike and all wearing bright orange reflective ‘I am not a turkey’ vests.  On one hand sensible, but would you take your kids for a walk somewhere they could get shot by someone shooting turkeys??
The hostel in Fayetteville was 0.8 miles off the trail along the shoulder of a busy highway and I was gutted that the promised gas station with diner was another mile up the road from the hostel. Showered at the Thru It All hostel run by lovely kind people at a small local church (in a hamlet with almost as many churches as people, and certainly more churches than diners.)  Then walked the mile to the diner in my crocs - black bean burger double cheese melt, fries, coke and an ice cream sandwich for the walk back. Joy!
Now have two small blisters on the ends of my second toes where they jam on my trail shoes on rocky descents. Hoping to do two long days of about 20 miles each to get to the trail town of Boiling Springs for Monday night.  But who knows? One day at a time…","Tumbling Run Shelter
",Fayetteville,"Apr 30, Sat",10
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650046,"I was up and out of the Thru It All hostel in Fayetteville at 6.50. And back again just after 7 to retrieve my lunch from the fridge.  
The .8 mile road walk back to the trail took about 15 minutes.  Today’s trail was undulating but had no serious climbs and no big rocky sections.  With nothing to slow me down apart from the 12 kilos on my back I am hoping to make it 20 miles to a hostel, with a shelter at 16/17 miles as a back up option. 
The half day off the trail and the chance to ice my knee and sort some minor blisters had done wonders. I felt strong and had romped an easy 10 miles by 11am, when I stopped at a shelter with a nearby spring to collect and filter some water. 
I am slowly learning to gauge how much water I need for each 5/10 mile section between water sources so I have just enough and not too much extra weight of water I won’t drink.   I also drink a lot early in the sections to reduce the time I carry the full weight of water.
In the next 7 miles I passed two official half way on the AT markers, and I hear I’ll pass another tomorrow.  As the AT changes in length with reroutes so the half way mark moves, hence the trio of half way markers. I still have more than a 1000 miles to go on my first flip north and then another 1000 or so when I flop south. Halfway a dream for me at present.  
After 17 miles I feel I have earned lunch and can enjoy it knowing I will make the hostel at 20 miles in good time. I make tea and a sandwich and munch crisps and chocolate. It has started to rain and I share a covered lunch bench with 3 hikers: a southbounder; a new flip flopper; and a section hiker thinking about thru hiking next year.  Gazelle passes thru and promises to save me a bunk at the hostel. 
It’s less than 4 miles to the hostel, and I still felt great but it was raining hard. At 3.30pm I stood soggy in the hostel lounge with a big grin on my face. I’m starting to feel like a thru hiker. 
Tomorrow is another 20 miler but as a bonus there’s a grill restaurant and supplies shop about 9 miles in.  Simple pleasures mean happy days.","Fayetteville
",Ironmasters Mansion Hostel,"May 01, Sun",19.90
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650124,"I set out at 7.30 with a deadline of 4.30pm to hike 19.2 miles for a hostel pick up. 


The first few hours were easy going. I had hoped to have breakfast at a diner just off trail about 9 miles in. But I walked past the turn off - saw no sign - and was half a mile up the trail before I realised.  No slap up breakfast. Another bar - yippee!


Before missing the diner I got lost in the mist for a while - the first time on this trail.  On a more positive note,  I had a close encounter with an elegant wide winged Heron taking off a just a few feet in front of me.  
Middle section of the day was hard.  Steep incline for a good few miles that had me soaked with sweat and puffing hard.  Worse at the tree enveloped summit - with no view as usual - the trail went up, over and through huge boulder piles for a mile or more.  Torture! 


Exhausted by 2pm, I had a late lunch after 15 miles.  Beautiful spot for a shelter that I had to myself. And there was 5G reception to follow the last 15 minutes of Fulham’s championship title winning game.  Filtered some spring water and got going again. 


Refreshed I bounced up and down a few sharp hills and across a few miles of meadows into the pretty town of Boiling Springs at 4pm. Had time to enjoy the afternoon sun by the lake and eat my first Honey Bun!","Ironmasters mansion hostel 
",Boiling Springs,"May 02, Mon",19.20
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650269,"Thunder and Lightning (very very frightening)


The day started with a loss. I left my green t-shirt - one that I’ve worn on every long hike for the last few years - at the hostel which was a 10 minute drive outside the beautiful little town of Boiling Springs.  


I tried in vain to get the owner to drop it into town for me, or give it to a hiker to bring up the trail for me, or even acknowledge in any way that she could help me, perhaps post it if I paid the postage?  But no, she was like tough shit the deal was you have your stuff together at 7.35 and we drop you into town. You left something?  Boohoo… 


I decided just to go with the flow and not worry about it. Outfitters in town had the exact same type of t-shirt and I bought a replacement. I ate a huge breakfast with 3 coffees at a great little diner. And a lovely man in the US Postal Service was super helpful getting the gear I’ve decided I don’t need sent home to the UK.  An enjoyably slow start to the day, which made a nice change. Plus a lighter pack.


Even better the first 10-12 miles walking was across fields and on flat paths.  I knocked out 12 miles in less than 4 hours, even whilst chatting to Fi on the phone for nearly an hour. 


There was a shelter at 14 miles but I knew it would be crowded as there were quite a few thru hikers at breakfast, so I pushed for another 3 miles or so to a stream where I decided to wild/stealth camp.  I found a perfect flat spot not to far from the stream. 


I knew there was a risk of rain and even a thunderstorm. But I was not expecting the super scary lightning and thunder that woke me at midnight and the torrential rain that fell for 2 hours. The lightning was illuminating my tent and my surroundings like a cartoon where you see skeletons of people and animals when they get electrocuted.  Though this was not a funny cartoon!   The rain was so hard it felt like the fire service had a high pressure hose directed at my tent.  And I lie wishing that I’d asked the Eastbourne fire service to test my tent with their hoses as part of my preparations. 


The noise of the rain on my tent and the thunder was so loud that I couldn’t hear music or podcast in my headphones. So I laid wide awake anxiously checking my tent for leaks and reading the Guardian, which is always good for reading about people in far worse positions than oneself. That did help calm my nerves a bit. Though I did put on my rain jacket in case an emergency evacuation became necessary (eg the tent collapsed).
Finally, about 2am the rain slowed and the thunder stopped and I fell asleep. In the morning, my tent looked like it’s been 10 rounds with Joe Frazier, beaten up and badly bloodied but still on its feet!  


Strangely, the experience makes me feel more confident in camping as it is reassuring to know that my tent can survive such an immense deluge.  I’m proud of the little fella! 


17 or so miles. Another exciting day on the AT. What next?","Boiling Springs

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650270,"I was packed and out of my stealth camp by 7, pleased to be heading for town as I had a wet tent on top of my pack. 


It was 7.3 misty drizzly miles into Duncannon - first up a rocky climb, then along an undulating ridge and finally down a precipitous rocky path into Duncannon. With an evil little uphill slog over a lump of rock just outside town. 


I got to town about 10.30 and headed to the laundry.  I must have looked desperate as I looked around wild eyed for a change machine , soap and any spare clothes I could wear whilst I washed mine.  A fellow hiker donated his leftover quarters to me and a local woman went out to her car to fetch me some clothes intended for the charity shop.  


I put everything I owned in a machine and wandered into Doyle’s Hotel.  “Aha it’s the Englishman , we’ve been waiting for you” said the barman.  He promptly brought me coffee and breakfast, introducing me to an older local with an interest in history and all things English. She was excited to tell me that Charles Dickens once stayed at the hotel.  The hotel had another name at that time and Dickens only stayed because his travel plans went awry.  I got the impression. that not much happens in Duncannon, apart from thousands of hikers coming through town every year. 


Went to The Pub (great name and good pub) with Burgerfeet for a long lunch.  Had dinner with Gazelle and EarlyBird in a pizza place with spectacularly rude staff.  


7.3 miles today and a half day milling around in a town that Dickens once visited by mistake.  Days off with no miles walked are called zeros.  A day with only a few miles in or out of town is called a ‘Nero’.","Stealth Camp

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650477,"EarlyBird and Gazelle were already up the trail when I left the Doyle Hotel at 7am, laundered, well fed and fresh legged. The trail went through town for about a mile. Fun to see a bit of small town America. Big yellow school buses and signs in front yards, such as “If Orioles are near, love is close”.  Or the other way around!?
Tramped over two long river road bridges and then a slow steep climb back to the Appalachian ridge. 


Half way up to the ridge I met Larry, a turkey hunter, who was so quiet and stealthy in his camouflage I nearly walked into him. He told me a bit about turkey hunting - they lure them out with a whistle, they leave yearlings and the meat is ‘not like a butterball’.  Not my thing but Larry was a lovely man. 


Long trek along the undulating rocky ridge with some fine views over the meandering river. First real views of the trip as the trail is purposely kept wooded either side to promote a sense of continuous wilderness. I met Crossword, who has a long streak of completing the New York Times crossword that he has kept up on the trail.  And then I spend a good hour walking and talking to some ‘Trail technicians’  who maintain the wilderness and the boundaries of the trail corridor, to stop private landowners encroaching on park lands. 


Had lunch at a shelter at 12 mile mark, with Burgerfeet, Crossword, EarlyBird (who I had caught up) and the technicians.  All very jolly and good fun. 


There followed a long 6 miles, 3 hours, along the trail and down to river with low water reserves. Caught Gazelle just before the river and agreed to push for a campsite at the 21 mile mark.Good plan that led to my first 20 plus mile day but it involved a long slog uphill for almost 2 hours. I’m feeling strong now but the steep uphills never get easy. 


Got to the campsite and Gazelle wasn’t there so assumed he’d pushed on further. Once I had my tent pitched on a stony little gap in the trees, I realised the lovely flat campsite was 0.1 mile further up the trail and Gazelle was there.  Too late to move  


Ate dinner and hung my bear bag.  Tent and sleep.  Rain forecast tomorrow.","Duncannon

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650480,"I’m sitting in McDonalds in damp clothes having eaten two breakfasts as I write this. Yesterday was miserable. 


I woke about 5am with rain tin-panning on my tent. I dozed for 30 minutes then packed my backpack whilst sitting in my tent. A skill I a learning for rainy mornings. Got my bear bag out of tree and rolled my tent soaking wet, attaching it to outside of my pack. 


All going well. Now to poop in the woods. I went for the hang onto a small tree and squat method. There was a loud crack and my bare arse hit the cold wet ground. The tree had snapped.  Note to self, you’re a big fucker so pick a bigger tree in future! 


Left camp at 6.45. A mile up the road in the pummelling rain, remembered I had hidden my penknife under a rock. No thought of going back with a 20 mile day ahead. Another item to list of growing list of gear I have lost (was eating dinner with my penknife because I lost my spork the day before).  Stopped at spring to filter some water.


Eight mile trudge in torrential rain to next shelter to make coffee and eat breakfast bar.  Path was a stream and my feet were soaking after about 30 minutes.  Started to feel cold about an hour before I got to shelter. Along with rain , It was 10C with a chill east wind. Realised my expensive gortex pro rain coat could only handle a couple of hours of intense rain. Leaking through all zips and soaked through in places.  £10 kilt doing a much better job keeping my shorts dry. 


Had a much needed hot coffee and a honey bun at the shelter. I love these buns! Changed out of my wet t shirt and put my lightweight mid layer on. Assumed it would get wet too but offer me more insulation even when wet. Two options now  - stay at this shelter for a long day and night. Or push on 13.8 miles to next shelter. 


I went for it. The miles were certainly walkable and my plan was not to stop, but push on the whole way in the rain, eating trail mix and energy bars. 


First, I had a stream with a beaver dam to navigate. Given that the whole trail was not a running stream, getting wet feet was not a concern. I balanced across the branches making up the dam without falling in, probably because I had no fear of falling in as my feet sodden already. 


The next 5/6 miles passed fairly quickly though I did walk the wrong way (south) for about 15 minutes after getting disorientated at a camp ground where I stopped to pee. Luckily, I walked into Gazelle who was 30 minutes behind at the previous shelter. Turned around feeling lucky and massively irritated at adding 30 minutes to my hiking day. 


I got in a fast hiking groove to keep warm and was going strong, until I slipped over and then again and then a final time when I bent my hiking pole through 45 degrees or so.  Wet AND muddy now. 


Got to a bridge over river with a sign showing 7.2 miles to shelter.  Steep climb for 30 minutes or so was a blessing as it warmed me up. But a nasty chill wind up top had me singing Spice Girls hits to keep my spirits up. 


The trek along the ridge was sometimes flat and easy if wet walking. But occasionally a quarter mile of sharp rocky stuff would test my concentration.  Twisting an ankle or worse would result in an uncomfortable slow tent (already wet) erection and a less than comfortable night.  I was soaked again through by now but my mud layer whilst soaking wet was still keeping me warm (ish).  Now deep into shelter as my ‘true north’ psych to keep me trucking forward. 


About 5pm - and 10 hours in the pouring rain - I made it to the shelter. The platform upstairs had 3 hikers warming up. I spread my wet stuff out on the wooden platform. 
Got into dry clothes, into my sleeping bag and got some hot food and drinks inside me. 


Gazelle arrived and then Unwound (a younger hiker who’d done 30 miles or more). Both as waterlogged and cold as me. 


Once warmed, we started to make plans. Another day of even worse rain forecast for tomorrow, persuaded us all that a few miles walk in the morning to the nearest road and a shuttle to a hotel was needed to warm us up and raise morale.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650593,"Gazelle and I had a lie in at the shelter, leaving at 8.45 to walk the 2.1 miles to the 645 Highway where we had a shuttle to town booked at 10. 


It was raining even harder now and set to rain all day again so we were very happy with our plan to dry ourselves and our stuff at a hotel. 


Fast Eddie arrived in a 450HP Mustang, a strange car for a hiker shuttle service. But he was a lovely guy and we were in Pine Grove in 10 minutes or so. We agreed that he’d take us back to the trail the next morning. 


I ate two McDonald’s breakfasts whilst we waited for our noon check in at the hotel. I had the American biscuits instead of buns as they add about 100 calories to each breakfast burger!   In excess of 1500 calories for breakfast means that my hiker hunger has finally arrived!


Gazelle and I trashed the room, covering it in wet tents and clothes.  We jacked the heating unit up to the max and rigged clothes lines above it. 


I had a long video chat to Fi and it was fantastic to see her and doggo. I then went to the Dollar General (think Poundsaver) for food supplies. 


Ate dinner in a brilliant 50’s themed local diner with Gazelle and also EarlyBird, who’d walked 15 miles in the rain whilst we’d be lazing about.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650637,"Fast Eddie was outside and waiting in his mustang at 8.30 to take Gazelle and I back to the trail.   This trip was hair raising as he was keen show us what the wild horse could muster. I was less keen. 


A hundred yards up the trail and Gazelle had a sharp pain in his Achilles. I offered to take it slow but he said to hike on and he’d take it easy.


I have a habit of hiking 4 hours straight each morning to try knock a good few miles off the day’s total out of the blocks. I snack at the 2 and 3 hour mark but don’t stop.  At 4 hours I check how I am doing and generally keep going until I have more than half and often two thirds of the day’s miles underfoot.  This allows me to plod in the afternoon and - rocks permitting - enjoy looking for wildlife. 


I was a bit low through the morning.  The 21 miles in heavy rain and the sameness of the Pennsylvania scenery were getting to me. Plus the rocks for which PA is renown make it hard to ever look up, so I’ve spent a lot of time looking at my feet!


In checking at four hours, I’d made rapid progress and only had 5 miles to go to the night’s shelter. This lifted my spirits and I found a great spot by a stream for a longish lunch. The afternoon was a relative stroll, despite more rocks which are murderous and require a lot of concentration. Thankfully, my falls have been the result of slipping in mud.  A fall on the jagged rocks here would not be pleasant. So I take great care on every boulder field, of which there are many to cross. If you see rocks ahead, the AT will go straight over them!


The shelter was 0.3 miles down a side trail beyond a gushing stream. The Eagles Nest was empty when I arrived but soon filled up. I shared the shelter with two people, and 4/5 people camped including Gazelle.
Gazelle got into camp a long time after me and his Achilles issue seems bad enough to send him off the trail. Sad for him and me as we have been a happy odd couple the last 10 days or so.  I will miss his company.","
",Eagles Nest Shelter,"May 08, Sun",16.40
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650721,"Earliest start yet at 5.30, just light enough to see the trail. 


Early morning in the woods was atmospheric and it reminded me to take time to savour my surroundings and not just chase  miles.  Watching the sun rise through the trees, I saw two white tailed deer springing about, as they do. 


My goal was to walk 9 miles into Port Clinton, an old coal town with a river and a railway, to pick up a free shuttle to a outdoor outfitters in the nearby town of Hamburg.  The first five miles were easy enough, then I hit rocks that slowed me down and finally a vertiginous descent into town.  


At the town’s hiker pavilion I made myself a coffee before the shuttle pick up to cabellas outdoor store. 


I’ve been losing and breaking stuff. I bought new hiking poles, a new rain jacket, a spork, and a penknife plus some dehydrated food for the days ahead. Cabellas was something else. The gear wasn’t great quality but this was the outdoors at superstore size with a bit of Disney thrown in.  For a second, I thought there really was a waterfall and a bunch of deer at the back of the store!


I crossed the business park - not easy on foot in the US - to get to a Starbucks: flat white, a breakfast burger and yoghurt granola. Got the 1pm shuttle back to the hiker pavilion in Port Clinton. 



I took the steep rocky climb out of town in ‘full burro’ mode up to ridge. Burro is neither happy nor unhappy, he is simply a beast of burden who plods up hills. He knows and wishes for nothing else. 


After a rocky ridge walk the trail became a bit kinder and I made the William Furnace Shelter by 6.30. 


After a long day it was fun to meet a bunch of kids from a Philly school out hiking for a week with their teachers. But after a brief chat to Jedi, another flip flopper, I was ready for the floor of the shelter and bed.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650723,"Up at 5, out of camp at 6. 
I had organised a hostel stay for tonight but I had to make a 5pm pick up 20 miles or so up the trail. And I had been told it would be a rocky and testing section. Brutal the word used by other hikers. 
There was a shortcut ‘blue blaze’ trail that would have saved me 4 miles but it’s not the AT and I have set out to walk the AT, so for me the short cut was not an option. Much as the little devil on my shoulder kept suggesting it would make for an easier day. 
The first section up to the Pulpit and the Pinnacle were easier than advertised by other hikers.  Not too much of a climb for either and only a rocky scramble up the last few metres.  I got some youngsters up at the Pulpit to take a few photos that turned out great with the sunrise behind me. 
Despite the early start, the easy going and warm sun with a cool breeze had me in elated mood. By the time I stopped for lunch at Dan’s pulpit after 5 hours of walking, I’d covered over 11 miles - not bad over rocky terrain.
The middle 5 miles down Dan’s pulpit to the Allentown shelter were perhaps the toughest 5 miles I’ve done so far. The trail was scattered boulders pretty much the whole way. Ankle bruisers, ankle breakers and heart breakers, every kind of rocky moraine it would be possible to dump and laugh as hikers cry and lick their wounds.
I saw my first snakes on the AT, both what locals call Rat Snakes, which are non venomous. The first one was sunning itself right across the trail In front of me, eyeing me up on its right flank and then on its left as I made a wide circle around it.  
I ran out of water before I finally reached the Allentown shelter, where sprite and smugness kindly gave me some of theirs before I headed off downhill to the water spring and slogged back up again with it before collapsing in the shelter shade. 
After Allentown, the rocks ended and it was a gentle two hour walk to the pick up point. Lovely hostel tonight with laundry, shower and breakfast included.","William furnace shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650793,"It was hard to leave the Shanty on Blue Mountain hostel, partly because our host Lynn made blueberry pancakes and partly because today’s walk included the Knife Edge!


Lynn dropped Smugness, Sprite and I at the trail just after 8.30am.  I planned only 13.7 miles so I could take the long rocky sections safe and slow. And thankfully, the weather was perfect, sunny with a cool gentle breeze.  


The first few miles were easy going. After about 3 miles the trail became mostly rocks as I approached Knife Edge. 


On the way up I meet Moonhawk, a local trail club maintainer. He gave me some great advice about the rocky sections ahead. Best of all that he had trimmed the trees to the left of the Knife Edge, allowing a traverse away from the steeper drop on the right side.  Also that I should pack my hiking poles so I could use my hands to scramble. 


Armed with this advice, I got up and over the Knife Edge with no problems.  Better, I was starting to enjoy rock hopping as my confidence grew.  


I enjoyed the hopping and scrambling over Bake Oven Knob (real name, honest!) and took lunch at the Bake Oven shelter.  The shelter itself had a hornets nest in it so I had to settle for a bench in the sun to eat my tuna wrap and snickers bar.  A spring provided some much needed water for the next 7 miles or so. 


As I left the shelter, I nearly trod on the tail of a rat snake. I only stopped a few inches short because it hissed loudly at me. Not aggressively but more ‘could you watch where you are walking!’  



The remaining miles were a bit of a slog. Not matter the length of the day, the last few miles always seem to drag on.   Shelter is old school and no privy. But I got a spot near the corner and any night I don’t have to pitch my tent is a good night!!

A short descent led to a road bridge over the Lehigh River. The ascent from the Palmerton ‘gap’ back up to the ridge was mighty steep. So I took it real slow and enjoyed the smell of pine and the cool morning air. 
As the rocks increased in size, I took off my pack and put away my hiking poles as the last 75m of ascent was a boulder scramble that required both hands, plus an ability not to look down. At the summit the rocks continued with a mile or so of boulder scrambling along a traverse just north of the top ridge line. I’ve learnt to take these boulder fields real slow as a fall could be hike ending or much worse consequences.  A sunny cool morning with a light breeze was perfect for taking this on. Not sure I’d be comfortable in heavy rain and/or high winds. 
When the rocks ended, Lunchbox a northbounder with over 1200 miles hiked, caught me up.  The trail became flat and easy on the ridge line and we walked and chatted for a few hours, with me privately struggling to keep pace.  At 10.7 miles I needed a break and Lunchbox pushed on though not before agreeing to share a motel room together that night. 
Today’s hike was unusual in that there were no possible water sources for 17 miles, and no guaranteed water for 20 miles. I’d carried about 2 litres but was down to 0.7 litre for the 6 miles to the shelter with possible water.    It was now hot and those miles dragged on as I rationed my remaining water. When I finally got to the shelter I was completely out of water Luckily, the spring was flowing. I sat by the stream and filtered and drank a litre before filling my bottles with 2 litres more and heading back to the shelter for lunch. 
On leaving the shelter - which was at the 17 mile mark - there followed a horribly rocky section that went on for a few miles and sapped the last energy out of my legs. Better was the final few miles of switchbacks down to Windy Gap. 
Lunchbox was at the motel and we headed off for food. Food was great but the mile walk to the restaurant and back was less enjoyable.

Today, I walked the last 15.1 miles of the AT in Pennsylvania.  


The motel in Wind Gap that I stayed in last night should be demolished. The guy who owned it was eager to please but the place was a tip and the rate charged was extortionate. The most unforgivable of a long list of issues was that the bed blanket was filthy and had multiple cigarette burn holes in it. 
I was out at 6.30 and slowly crept up the only real climb of the day.  The weather was what I would call soft, not raining but the air was wet. Up on the ridge it was spooky as visibility was low in the mist and I was on the lookout for bears.   Be easy to walk up pretty close with so a short sight line so I decided to sing loudly enough to scare any living thing away!!


For 3/4 miles the going was tough, ankle biting and breaking rocks all the way.  After a brief respite of flat AT superhighway, there was a quarter mile big boulder scramble. Dangerous in the wet ad the rocks were slippery as hell.  Two buzzard vultures had stationed themselves at the scariest section, with an exposed edge. I assume they were hoping for human remains!!
The shelter at half way for the day was sociable with a few nobos (over 1200 miles into their AT journey) and Rerun and Irish, two more flip floppers that I’d last seen in Port Clinton. 
The last six miles were a drag, mainly because my right thigh has a deep bruise that’s been expanding for a few days since I fell over onto a jagged tree stump.  Today, it was like a ‘dead leg’ and it hurt every time I pushed on it, being particularly painful downhill. 
The long, sometimes steep and sometimes winding descent into Delaware Water Gap, was therefore a giant pain in the arse. It took me about an hour longer than usual and I limped into DWG.



On the plus side, I saw 4 chipmunks in the last few miles. And I love watching the cheeky little fellas!! Remember, ‘Chip and Dale’?  I also saw my first groundhog a few days ago - apparently they like to stick to the same routine every day :-)   


At the hotel, I immediately had  a long bath. Followed by a few visits to the ice machine to start reducing the swelling on the various bits of my legs and feet that are sore, 


Glad to have completed the Pennsylvania section of the AT. Looking forward to a less rocky New Jersey.

After arriving at my hotel in Delaware water gap on Friday, I did my laundry, had a bath, iced the most painful areas of my legs - right thigh, left knee, and right ankle - ate a huge lunch at the apple pie bakery, and enjoyed dinner and a few beers at the sycamore grille. 


I had the whole of Saturday free to laze about in DWG.  I decided to walk as little as possible, spending as much time as I could icing my sore legs and keeping my feet up. 


I got all my resupplies in less than a hour at the local outdoor shop, the bakery and the service station.  That saved me getting an Uber to a Walmart and having a soulless traipse around the cheap but depressing aisles of processed food. 


My other mission was to keep eating and cramming calories as I am losing weight a bit too fast. For breakfast, I scoffed three iced donuts and coffee. And I went to the Sycamore grille again for lunch and dinner!!   


In the evening, we got a little hiking crew together for dinner including EarlyBird, TinMan, Pozzi and Ness.  It was good to catch up with EarlyBird who’s been a day behind me for a about a week now.

Plan A was to walk 15 miles to a campsite. Plan B was to walk 16.7 miles to another campsite. And plan C was to stop at just over 10 miles if the forecast of possible thunderstorms or heavy rain were proved right. 
There was a mile or so of road walking, over the Delaware river and through the parking lots for day hikers. The ascent back to the ridge was gentle and easy going. What a difference a state makes!!!
Sunfish Pond is a glacial lake and apparently one of the seven wonders of NJ. It was impressive though the rocky moraine along the side of the lake made for slow and careful progress. 
The ridge ran parallel with the Delaware river below for all of the morning, allowing glimpses of the valley, and the hills and woods to the far horizon. At 1pm, I stopped for good lunch at a rocky viewpoint with a beautiful broad vista. No lunch is complete without a packet of Cheetos now! No sign of rain so I pushed on along the grassy ridge, full of tree in leaf and wildflowers. Dropping down towards the AT mountain centre at 10 miles, I came across a cooler full of ‘trail magic’. The cooler was full of water, snacks and medical supplies provided for free by a local Methodist church group. I drank a water and filled my bottles with two more. Also grabbed alcohol wipes and green tea bags that I couldn’t find in town.  The snacks and treats looked tempting but I had a full food bag so didn’t take anything else.  My first trail magic!
Later, I stopped at the poorly named Rattlesnake Spring to collect enough water for an overnight stay at a dry campsite. Soon after, I came across a taped off area with signs warning of an aggressive bear in the area. There taped area contained a big metal baited bear trap, working by means of the one way flap method.   If caught, I hope the bear just gets moved along and nothing more. 
Putting a few miles between myself and an aggressive bear felt sensible, so I summoned the energy for plan b and the campsite at 16.7 miles. The next campsite beyond that was 4 more miles. I had the energy for it but I stuck to my promise to myself to limit my miles, to keep my legs happy and to savour the trail a bit more.  
As I erected my tent, thunder could be heard over on the next ridge   I ate dinner with Smugness and Sprite - who’d arrived just after me - guessing when the rain would reach us.  Unexpectedly, we were treated to a glorious sunset and then just a light smattering of rain.  But it’s only 8.30pm and it could be a long night if we do get the predicted thunderstorm.","Delaware Water Gap

I rolled out of my tent at 5.15 to find some cooler air.  Made coffee and slowly packed up. Left at 7 and walked solidly for 5 hours to make the 11.8 miles to Gyp’s Tavern. On the way, I had a fall. I slipped on a glassy wet rock and my feet went from under me in classical fashion. I landed flat on my back, which would have been v painful if I had not been wearing my backpack. As it was, it was like flopping on a gym mat, with no harm done. 
Today, Gyp’s Tavern has a taco food truck outside, sells cold beer and welcomes hikers to charge their phones and whatnot. It’s an institution on trail and it was great to spend a few hours there.I left 2.45 hoping to get to a shelter 3 miles away before a thunderstorm was due.

It’s been close to a perfect day, only Fi being with me could make it better. I had a dehydrated breakfast of eggs, potatoes and bacon bits plus coffee at 6 and I was on the trail at 6.30. After almost 6 miles of gentle up and down, smooth and rocky, I stopped at a shelter for 10 minutes to rest my back and eat a snickers. The next 7 and a bit miles were a bit tougher, ending with a steep climb to a fire tower - with good views - and then down to another shelter where I had a good lunch of bread, salami, cheese and a hard boiled egg. The view at the fire tower included the cenotaph shaped needle marking NJ’s High Point at 1798 feet. I didn’t go up the side trail to see it so I do not know whether it is another of seven wonders of NJ to add to my check list. (In case you have not been keeping up, yesterday I walked around the glacial Sunfish Lake - my first visit to a wonder of NJ.)After lunch the path lost height and the walking was easy, except for two nasty little steep PUDs (pointless up and downs) before my arrival at the secret shelter. Jim Murray is an ex-thru hiker who owns the land where the shelter is located.  Amazingly, he allows hikers to use it for free. The hiker hut has 4 walls (v unusual),  a water spigot, electric sockets (!!) and a privy.  But the best feature is it’s Eden like location. And the friendly donkey called Jake, who called to visit soon after I got here.  I am sitting on the porch of the hut watching Jake and an assortment of birds amongst the wildflowers and it’s a moment in my life that I will never forget.  Thank you Jim Murray!","Gren Anderson shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651284,"The secret shelter kept giving. At twilight, a doe and two fawns entertained us by frolicking at the end of the pasture. The fawns would run, get their legs tangled up, struggle to stay upright and then have another try.  
The walk out of the shelter was flat for a good few miles, which including walking over big boards and along a road to avoid the worst of the marshes.   Along the way - a little bit off trail- I  popped into Horley’s General Store in Unionville for a big breakfast sandwich, a coffee and a extra sandwich for lunch. The highlight of the morning was walking around three sides of a big wetland nature reserve. Lots of birds to see but it was red buntings that mainly kept me company. 
The middle miles of the day were the familiar mini rollercoasters of the AT, up and down, up and down. At 13 miles there was a road crossing with a garden centre selling various produce and ice creams. Ate my sandwich there, had a Gatorade and an ice cream and headed for the steep climb of the day. 
The climb was called ‘the stairway to heaven’ and it was rocky and fairly steep in places. On the way up, I saw my first Garter Snake, not that I knew that when I saw it and took picture. But that’s what folks tell me it is, another non poisonous snake. 
After the climb was 3 more tedious rocky up and downs before I reached the shelter. Steady is here, who was at the secret shelter last night. Plus two new flip floppers to me-  Silver and Fallout. 
Tomorrow is a short day: 10 miles to a hot dog stand and an ice creamery, and then a pick up to the motel lodge where I have a room.","The Secret Shelter

I set off at 7am with 10 miles to hike to the 17A highway crossing, where I was to picked up by the Greenwood Lake Lodge motel shuttle. There was also the promise of a hot dog stand and an ice cream shop near the road crossing. 
The elevation profile showed a few minor ups and downs but what looked like a long ridge walk.  It was not! After a few miles of powering along in the drizzle there was the first of many very steep scrambling ups and downs on some wet and very slippery rocks. In the 5/6 miles of continuous rocky ups and downs, I fell over 4 times, grazing my hands a bit more each time as my legs went from under me and I broke my falls the best I could manage. 
A couple of the sharp descents on slick lichen covered rock, had my toes and fingers in tiny inch or two crevices as I tried and just about succeeded in not tumbling 20 feet or so onto a rocky landing.  I was swearing and cussing and generally mad at myself for letting my expectations of an easy day get the better of me. 
To cap a bad morning, when I finally made it to the road crossing the hot dog stand was closed!!!
On more positive notes, I saw my first wild orchids (ladies slippers?) and some sweet smelling wild azaleas. The hosts at the lodge are also lovely people, offering the shuttle for free and doing my laundry for $5. There’s also a bath!!!!","Wawayanda shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651610,"This was a bad day. The hardest day of walking so far and my lowest day physically and mentally.  And the first time I have thought about quitting. 


My day off was not as restful as I had hoped.  The 10 miles into town were hard and once there I had a lot to do in an afternoon: visiting the post office, buying supplies and ice for my aching legs.  Plus the centre of town was a good half mile walk from my motel.  It was good to have a bath and rest and ice up but it was over all too quickly. 


The motel owner drove me back to the trail junction. I had been told it was a tough stretch ahead and that proved true almost immediately. 


In the first few miles there were two big rocky outcrops to overcome; the Eastern Pinnacles and Cat Rocks. With some difficulty, and the odd treacherous slip I made it.  After wildcat shelter I thought the terrain would get easier. 
That was wishful thinking. For the 16.6 miles I walked today, I must have bouldered up 20 or more rocky little summits. After the first few of these scrambles I was ‘all in’ with hardly any gas left in my tank. I just seemed to run on empty all day, getting through each scramble by sheer desperation. 


My mood was awful: flustered and negative. I tried to turn myself around about half way through the day with a big effort to be more positive and push a bit harder, but I almost immediately got lost and walked over 0.75 of a mile on the wrong trail, adding 1.5 miles to my day. 


For the rest of the day I had grim thoughts about giving up and not being physically up to the demands of the AT.  Though I did rally enough to haul myself through and up and over the famous Lemon Squeezer rocks.  


Just before I got to the shelter, walking pitifully slowly, I turned a corner to find a big deer just 7 or 8 feet away staring at me quizzically. It stood staring at me for a full 5 seconds or so in what seemed a kindly manner. And I took this as a sign to calm down and relax, as if the deer were saying “You’re ok. Take it easy, You got this. We’re watching over you”.  An uplifting end to a bad day. 


I collapsed into Fingerboard shelter just before it started to rain heavily.  Fallout was there ahead of me, smugness and sprite rolled in wet 30 or so minutes later.  The shelter was busy with New Yorkers out hiking for the weekend, making for a social evening. 


It was a hot sweaty night and I slept anxiously worrying about the next few days hiking. 


It was a hard day and I’m doing ok, but I need to be careful not to push myself too hard.  16.6 was probably 4 or 5 miles too much for me today.","17A highway

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651611,"I started today at 6.30am feeling anxious after yesterday’s struggle.   And aware that it would be a hot day with temperatures up to 95F. Fortunately, the trail was mellow to begin with allowing me to get into a steady stride and process the events of the day before. 
I kept up a good lick all morning, knocking off miles of my day. But also saving my energy for Bear Mountain later in the day.  
The mountains before and after Bear Mountain looked steeper to me so I was pleased to get over the first of these in good shape.  
I’ve got a solid approach to walking up long steep hills on big mileage days, which is to take them real slow and let the mountain come to me.  The slower I go the quicker I seem to make the ascent as I never stop as  going so slowly means I am never out of breath. I call this the ‘million steps of zen’ method and I always thank the mountain for giving me time to mediate at the start of a climb. Cheesy? Perhaps?  It works for me…
The climb up bear mountain was fine, not  hard at all.  At the fire tower, I was shocked to see a mass of cars and hundreds of people out for the day. Though happy to buy a coke from a vending machine.  
I bounced down the 1.7 miles of steps down the other side of the mountain, watching NY’s finest struggling up the hill in their best clothes, many with music blasting out to bring a festival atmosphere  .
The bear mountain recreation ground below was heaving with picnickers.  It was fun to see so many people out enjoying the sun with their families.  And I got to rest up, eat lots of food and use the rest rooms. Result!
The end of the day was a near vertical ascent of Anthony’s Knob (it’s not a knob but I can’t remember it’s real name).  I had to use all my zen powers to get up and over and then a mile or so on to my campsite. On this occasion, I might have forgotten to thank Anthony for his knob. 
At the campsite, I realised I had lost my tent stakes.  I used some twigs and my tent pitch wasn’t too bad though I was glad that  no wind was forecast!","Fingerboard Shelter

Today was another very hot (95F) day but slightly easier terrain and included a stop at the Appalachian Trial Deli for breakfast, more supplies and recharging. A hiker oasis.
Three days food on board plus water meant my pack was the heaviest it has been.  I made pretty good progress until a a late lunch at a state camp ground about 13 miles into my hike.
Thw afternoon and the last 5 miles or so were a drag, particularly a couple of miles around Canopus lake to get to the shelter. The water was always close but the trail, as the trail does, took the steepest, rockiest path up and around the lake, which had me walking at snail pace.
The shelter itself is new and the lake has some facilities, most of them closed but a rest room and some sockets are always welcome.
Watched a big thunderstorm with a giant rainbow from the shelter  and slept better as night was much cooler.  If the humidity is lower I might even get to put on dry clothes to hike in for the first time in 4 days.  There’s nothing like putting on wet clothes every morning.

I had a lie in, sauntered to the lake rest rooms for my morning ablutions and checked in with Fi at home.  I had coffee and danish apple pastry and took in the sunny morning. 


I left the shelter at 7.30. The terrain was easy to begin the day, a short up and over and then a long lazy descent. After 4 miles, I came across a delightful old shelter which I took the time to explore whilst eating a snack.  


I also met Easystreet there doing the same thing.  And we walked on together for the next few miles chatting about the trail, other trails and life at home.  


I ate lunch in a car park lying on the back of a pick up truck.  The guy who owned it had been at the shelter last night and he said I could leave my rubbish by his truck.  He was a bit taken aback to see me actually lying on his truck eating lunch but he was very kind about it. Even giving me the remainder of his water. 


The afternoon was a lovely hike warm in the dappled shade of the sun, with the occasional light breeze. I bopped along and all was good again.The shelter for tonight is a lovely old fashioned one, well tended by local rangers and volunteers.

I’m lying alone in Ten Mile shelter in Connecticut - yes I am now in my 5th state - watching deer graze at the end of a meadow.  The sun is going down, birds are chirruping and I’m about to go to sleep after another good day on the AT. 


The walking started at 7am as the previous day had left off. Some gentle climbs, some flat ‘AT superhighway’ and a long easy descent. Then an eerie walk by Nuclear Lake - not kidding it used to be a nuclear fuel research site! 


I caught up with BigEasy ,who’d left last night’s shelter 30 minutes earlier than me, and we walked on loosely together until we’d done 11 miles and hit NY Route 22. 


At the road junction, there was the option of a deli and pizza place half a mile down the road, or a garden centre next to the trail. We chose the garden centre, where the lovely owner let us sit in her gazebo to eat lunch, use her rest rooms and fill our water bottles.  She also had coke and ice creams for sale which were a good bonus. Plus it was a gorgeous natural garden centre that only sold plants growing wild in the area.  


After lunch there was some easy meadow walking with good views. All a bit little house on the prairie in a good way. It’s nice to escape the trees for a bit though it also reminds one of how much shade from the hot sun they provide. I pushed on from BigEasy because whilst my plan A was to walk 16.6 miles to the Wiley shelter, I wanted the option to walk on another 4 miles to the next shelter if I had the energy. 


I got to Wiley shelter by 3pm, ate and drank as much as I could and enjoyed a restorative 20 minute nap. 


The next 4 miles were lovely as the sun weakened and the woods became a near dark world apart.I made the Ten Miles shelter about 5.45, got some food on, chatted online to Fiona and then went for an early night.

Glad to only have 9 miles or so into the town of Kent, where I have a room booked for two nights of comparative luxury. 


Left the shelter at 6.45, and the first 3 miles were much as the day before, enjoyable hiking on rolling woodland trail. 

The middle section was a bit more taxing as the rock count increased but my average speed was good and I hoped to be in Kent by noon.  Wishful thinking!
The final 3 miles were tough, with some nasty steep rocky ups and jagged, leg sapping downs. It’s the descents that show up all my various foot, ankle and knee issues and encourage me to hike tentatively. My main thought is to be careful so as to get to Kent in as good shape as possible. Sore is ok, injured would make for a less restful off day  
On the final descent to the road crossing that will lead to Kent, I stop in the final shelter to take some pain killers, put my pack down, have a snack, and drink a lot of water. 


The tough last section means I get to town about 12.45.  My hotel room isn’t ready so I drop my pack and head to a diner for lunch.  Fresh food joy! I have a cobb salad, with orange juice and cherry pie and ice cream for dessert.

Iced my sore ankle and big toe and headed out to the diner for lunch.  Ate lunch and made a rough plan for the next 5 days or so. There are some tougher days coming up so I need to plan for less mileage a day. Plus it’s my birthday soon and it would be nice to be in town that day. 
Packages arrive from REI (US outdoor outfitters) and I’m super happy with my new light sun hoody and ultralight Patagonia joggers/trousers. For me, long sleeves and trousers are the way to go in the heat with lots of mozzies around.

Kent's affluence is hugely different to the grittier ex mining trail towns in Pennsylvania, such as Duncannon.  On occasion whilst in Kent, I've felt like an extra on The Truman Show as everything feels a bit too perfect.  But it's a great place for a rest day and the locals have been kind and welcoming (with special mention to Blondin Shea opticians who fixed my glasses and gave me cleaner fluid and a cloth with no charge and best wishes for my hike).  For dinner, I had an expensive tuna salad, a few craft beers and some enjoyable bar conversation in an upmarket tavern.I get a lot of joy from Americana and the kindness of strangers in trail towns.","Kent

I left Kent about 7am and road walked back to the trail.  I cruised up the big ascent to start the day, running through lots of bits of good news from home in my head.  


Before I knew it I was at the summit and descending to the Housatonic river valley. And what a descent it was, probably the most technical I’ve done so far -  huge chunks of rock, tumbling down the mountain. All wet, mossy and very slippery. I had to do a few sections on my butt.  It took me some time but I managed it unscathed. I got new hiking shoes delivered whilst in town and I was glad of their extra grip. 


The trail then followed the river for a good few miles. After 7 miles, I stopped in a shelter to rest my back and have a snack. Heavy pack today as it’s loaded with food for three or four days. Despite packing heavier stuff lower in my pack it still made my shoulders ache enough to take a break every three hours or so.

The last 10 miles were a rollercoaster of big ups and downs that tested my legs and overall resilience. The second to last climb of the day I called ‘the imposter’ (for not being the last climb of the day) and it fought back with three or four false peaks to test my resolve. 
I shot up the last steep ascent of the day, keen to get the shelter before the predicted rain. I succeeded by staying dry and arriving  at the shelter about 5.30pm. 17 miles closer to Mt Katahdin.","
",Pine Swamp Brook Shelter,"May 27, Fri",17
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652090,"I’ve been threatening to rein back my daily mileage for some time now.  And today was a good opportunity to do that. 


It rained heavily overnight. So the choice between my two options for today was easy. 11 miles with one big climb at the end of the day and a slap up brunch/lunch at 8 miles. Or a 21 mile day with three big climbs (2 of which are over 2000ft) and two very tricky rocky descents.  Plus more rain was forecast. I chose the 11 mile option. 


The lure of proper food led me to walk an undulating 8.1 miles in two hours and forty minutes.  The Mountain Cafe was excellent and I had two breakfasts, coffee, juice and a turmeric tea over two long hours of warm relaxation - enjoyed in my dry town clothes - that included reading the Saturday paper.  The lovely folks in the cafe also allowed me to charge my power block, phone, ear buds and kindle. Big win!


I left the cafe at noon for the final 3 miles of the day; a short section by the Housatonic River (again) and the big climb of the day. The climb was fairly easy with a lot of switchbacks though persistent heavy rain made it a sweaty endeavour in full rain gear.  The shelter turn off was less than half a mile after the summit.  The day’s toughest test was a perilous descent by a raging stream to the shelter. 


I arrived at the four to six person shelter to find 5 hikers already hiding from the rain.  A bit of shuffling up by fellow flip floppers - Silver, Splash and Earlybird - and space was found for me.  No fun setting up a tent in the rain, so I was relieved.

",Limestone Spring Shelter,"May 28, Sat",11.30
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652235,"I am writing this after deciding to leave the trail. More about why in my next post. 
I was last to leave the shelter at about 7.30am. Another crowded night in a shelter with snorers and noisy sleeping mats (thermarest neoair...grrrr)  made for a broken night’s sleep.  The holiday weekend has brought lots of day and section hikers on the trail.  They smell SO clean I get hit with a huge odour punch every time I pass someone.  Even a short waft provides notes of apple shampoo or Sure anti-perspirant.  As hiker trash, I have a deeply engrained pungent body odour that I notice most as I sweat uphill.  It’s not unpleasant to me but I am sure it is to the clean scrubbed day hikers.  
The Lion’s Head is an easy enough climb with a final rock scramble; probably less fun to descend than go up.  Bear Mountain is slightly tougher uphill - a lot of big stone steps- and an absolute nightmare to descend.  I get down very slowly, picking my way through the boulder jumble.  And sliding down on my bum on the really scary bits. I escape with nothing worse that grazed hands.  But there’s a life changing, potentially mortal danger to these AT descents that make me apprehensive.  Having an arthritic knee and two sore rolled ankles does not make me a graceful descender.  
There’s another big climb, a longish rocky ridge with some fine views and unwelcome exposed edges, and then another horrible descent before I reach my campsite for the night. 
The lack of views on the AT makes the climbing and descending feel pointless at times. I didn’t take much notice of the ‘green tunnel’ tag applied to the AT before I came, but it’s most apparent to me when climbing the mountains out here. Mostly, there’s no view at all.  There’s been a couple of great views today, particularly at the summit of Bear mountain where I had lunch.  But these view areas are tiny rare platforms - often crowded with day trippers - in a vast ocean of trees and rocks.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652254,"I decided to quit the trail last night after my phone call with Fi and the boys. I realised I had sounded low on the call and that’s because the trail has been grinding me down over the past week. 
I’ve been making great progress and walking good miles; well ahead of my schedule. But I’ve not been enjoying the hiking which has become a daily chore. 
The humidity means that nearly every morning starts with putting on wet clothes.  And checking for more mosquito bites which I now have all over my face, on my neck,wrists and legs. I have no serious injuries but I have two swollen ‘rolled’ ankles and my usual stiff arthritic left knee.
 Once I get going, I have generally enjoyed the first 3 or 4 hours of every day. But the rocky terrain, formidable steep ups and terrifying descents are starting to wear me down in the afternoons. And the constant mosquitos usually have me hiking with a head net in the lower terrain. Despite these challenges, I’ve kept making good miles and amongst my fellow flip floppers I am considered a strong hiker, some jokingly call me a machine. But as the trail wears me down I don’t feel like one.  I feel all too human. 
The worst bit of the trail over the last few weeks has been the complete lack of views despite regular days ascending over 4000 feet.  Staring at scrubby bush and trees in the ‘green tunnel’ has become boring for me, making the grind of hiking big miles every day harder, and that has made me question whether I want to do this for 4 more months? The simple answer for the question for me is no.  The opportunity cost is too high. I have a lovely wife, two boys and a home in a beautiful bit of the world. And that makes the bar for an adventure away from home very high. For me, the trail has been an incredibly positive experience but after 500 miles and 34 days it’s time for me to say goodbye.  Maybe, I’ll comeback and hike another section? Maybe another trail in a different bit of the world will be more appealing.  
I’ll write an after trail summary of my reflections when I feel a bit less raw about deciding to quit.  
I am happy.  I am healthy. I know I am making the right choice to leave. And I walk away from the AT glad of the experience.","Race Brook Falls campsite

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654869,"Hello folks!
I will be back on trail on 5th August. The AT is an itch I can't stop scratching.  And I hate to quit on a challenge.  It may prove beyond me, but I have not yet given up on my goal of 'thru hiking' at least 2000 miles of the AT in 12 calendar months.
I'm going to pick up where I left the trail, a few miles from the town of Great Barrington in Massachusetts.  I had completed 499 miles northbound from Harpers Ferry in my first 34 day adventure.  My aim on this trip is to hike the remaining 669 north to Mt Katahdin in Maine within 8-9 weeks to complete the northern section of my AT flip flop.  
If - and it is a massive IF - I complete this section then I might come back in the Spring to try to complete the southern section, from Harpers Ferry to Georgia.   But at present that's just wishful thinking, as I know the next 669 miles are some of the hardest on the AT, including the White Mountains in New Hampshire, in which the AT goes over 9 mountain summits higher than Ben Nevis (the highest mountain in the UK).  
I was homesick when I left the trail. And It was great to get home to spend my birthday at home with Fiona, Jack and Louis.  I generally float positively through life but I have always suffered from periods of depression, usually a couple a days a month when I need to hide to regroup.  I've learnt to be pretty good at spotting the signs of these looming lows but the last few days on trail I missed the signals and put my low morale down to the constant physical grind of the trail.  
In retrospect, a few more days or even a week's rest off the trail would probably have been enough to get me back buzzing for the challenge.  If home was in the USA, I may well have been itching to get back on the AT in a week or two.  In any case, I needed to recharge and being home has been wonderful. The big learning for me is to keep pushing hard when I feel good but also to give myself much more physical and mental recovery time when I need it.  
I'm sticking with most of the kit that worked well earlier in the summer. I'll update my kit list - on my original journal post - in the next few days with comments on new items, and those that I left in hiker boxes, sent home or lost.  
Be helpful to hear from US friends/followers about likely night time low temperatures on the AT in NH and ME in September and early October.  I probably going to bring a summer quilt for August but keen to know when i should post my 20F quilt out to the US for colder nights?

The day started with a steep climb and then eased off into rolling ups and downs. Hard enough for me but kind by AT standards.
I met Kung Fu Kitty, a southbounder at the Tom Leonard shelter after about 5 miles. Apparently, KFK has moves and once ate cat food for dinner on trail when he found other resupply options too expensive.  He didn’t recommend it!


It’s in the 90’s today, making uphill stretches more painful than usual. I’ve also lost my trail legs and I just plodded along most of the day. 


I had lunch at the South Wilcox mountain shelter and the ascent up to it had me pretty much at a standstill. I collapsed into the shelter hot and bothered with jelly legs. 


After a rather posh wrap - featuring cheese, red pepper and micro greens - and half an hour lying down. with my legs up on my pack I was ready to go again. 


Not for long though.  A slow 2 miles later at North Wilcox mountain shelter, I stopped for the day at 13.4 miles. It was only 2pm and I could have probably managed another few miles but I judged it better to rest up out of the sun and go again tomorrow.

Had the company of a frog in the privy for my morning constitutional. 


Someone had written on the door “remember you are on vacation” and I smiled because that’s true but it’s not exactly a pool and Margaritas experience.   Perhaps a working holiday?


First shelter I’ve stayed in with no water as the stream was dry. Thankfully, I’d read the warnings and packed enough in.   Water situation is tough, as in 95F you need to drink a lot of it.  And even some water sources marked as reliable in past years have run dry. 


My day started with a 4 mile or so descent to the Shaker Campsite.  Then a nice but hot sweaty climb up to Tyringham Cobble, where I met a Trail Angel called ‘wheels’ who asked questions about the best trails in the UK. And then she told me about the water and trail magic spots up ahead, including some that she provides every day.


Had a second breakfast on a bench in the shade at the top of the Cobble.  Still rocking the cheese, red pepper and micro greens wrap.  A steep descent to a road, where 50 yards to the left was a Trail Stand that people with a house next to the trail have set up. A little shack with a fridge/freezer stocked with coke, ice cream and various sweets to buy, and free water and power sockets. Genius!  I sat down (again, it was hot!) with a coke whilst I got some juice into my power bank and phone. 


Next up a tramp across an open pasture in full sun for a mile or so before I found the trail magic from wheels. Water flagons - as the next water a long way off, plus bananas and apples. Such kindness is lovely and reminds me of the huge community that supports the trail, mostly volunteers. Without their kindness it would have been a much more difficult and potentially dangerous day for hikers on this section.

Made it the 14 miles for the day to Goose Pond shelter, which used to be a private house. It was gifted to the trail and now volunteers look after the house and hikers on weekly rotation. I had a wonderfully refreshing swim in the lake (too big to be a pond?) and slept like a log in my bunk. This place is off grid with no power or mains water.  Perfect! 



The volunteer family made awesome blueberry pancakes and coffee for breakfast at 6am. All of this was free, with a very gentle request for voluntary donations. 
Great day. Almost felt like a holiday!","North Mt Wilcox Shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656093,"My day begins at 6am with blueberry pancakes and coffee in the living/dining room of the Goose Pond lake house by gaslight.  Our little huddle of hungry scruffy and frankly smelly hikers eating in the half light has a slightly Dickensian air.  


Back to reality, it is a half mile trudge uphill to the trail.  I amble for a mile or two and then through an upmarket country house lodge hotel and then climb Beckett Mountain. It’s hard work in the heat but it’s the only real climb of the day so I put a bit of effort into getting up quickly.   


Despite walking 18 miles in near 100F the rest of the day was easy by AT standards. No major climbs and lots of opportunities to rest. 


At October Mountain shelter at 8 miles, I meet unicorn, book couch and maximus and stay much longer than intended as the company is enjoyable. Unicorn and maximus have hiked over 1500 miles of the AT and they are inspiring company.  There’s a tiny dribble of water in the stream and I use a leaf and my mug to collect enough to keep hydrated for the next few hours. 


Another 3 or so miles along the trail, I visit the Cookie Lady at a blueberry farm.  Other younger hikers collect a can of blueberries each in return for a free lunch. I lounge around, enjoying the free pink lemonade and cookies.  I sit on the porch chatting to other hikers and struggle to leave. Another example of great trail community support for hikers and I make a donation. 


The afternoon’s hiking has no major ascents or descents, but it is hot and I still have another 7 miles or so to cover. I listen to music and try to keep moving fast. 


It rains for the last the mile of the day and I arrive wet at the Kay Wood shelter. It’s a modern shelter with separate bunks, and a picnic table covered by the front or the roof. For a rainy evening it’s a perfect retreat and the company is good too. Gummy Bear and The Mechanic are around my age, perhaps older, and have hiked the whole AT northbound to this point, mostly together.  


All the hardened hikers sleep in their tents so I have the shelter to myself.","Goose Pond Shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656098,"I woke at 5.15 and hit the trail just after 6am.   I am keen to get a hustle on as the trail passes through the town of Dalton, Massachusetts in 3 miles and it has a well stocked gas station that opens at 6am. And that means a monster coffee and a big breakfast!


The 3 miles are mainly downhill though there are the obligatory little steep climbs along the way. I imagine the AT route planner smiling as they detour the trail through every single lump of rock for 2200 miles. 
AT hikers generally agree that whenever unsure of where the trail goes at a junction, picking the nastiest rockiest and steepest route will generally be the right way. 


I sit on the wall of the gas station, happy with breakfast empanadas, a banana and coffee. Other hikers drift past, getting provisions for the days ahead. Gas stations are an oasis for hikers. 


I’m on a short day, about 12 miles in total to Cheshire, where I have a shuttle (private taxi) picking me up and taking me to a hotel in North Adams tonight. 


It’s not yet 8am and I hike up through thick woods towards the crystal mountain campsite about 4 miles away.   The AT in Massachusetts has forgiving soft terrain even on the climbs. There are roots and rocks but nothing like the rubble and boulder strewn trails in Pennsylvania, NY and NJ. 


I bounce into the campsite after a couple of hours sweating buckets and have a long break at the picnic bench, eating snacks, hydrating and catching up with family and football scores. 


The descent into Cheshire - it is always down into town - is shorter and steeper than the ascent,and rocky in places. I pick down it slowly feeling each step. By the time I reach town everything hurts but it feels good to get there. I buy an ice cream milkshake and wait for my ride.  Dave is a local and he drives the long way to North Adams to give me a view of Mount Greylock, the mountain I will summit tomorrow. 


In north Adams it’s hotel, shower, and laundry followed by pizza, fries, Caesar salad and beer for dinner.  Stacking the calories!


Dave’s picking me up at 7am tomorrow to take me back to Cheshire so I can walk back here over Mt Greylock with just a small day rucksack and not my usual huge backpack.  (In the US, they call this slack packing.)


Tomorrow will be the my full day in Massachusetts, before the AT enters Vermont.","Kay Wood Shelter
",Cheshire,"Aug 08, Mon",11.70
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656168,"Dave is waiting outside my hotel at 7 with a daypack for me as promised.  It is raining as we drive back to Cheshire but dry when I start hiking. 


It’s just under 15 miles today, 8 miles up to the summit of Mount Greylock, a ridge to a second mountain top, and then a steep downhill section of 3 or 4 miles. 


It’s an amazing feeling hiking without my backpack, and I feel like I am almost floating.  


It’s such a nice feeling that I bounce up the highest mountain in Massachusetts like a jack rabbit.  Though I am slightly embarrassed when I meet Unicorn and Book Couch struggling up a steep section with full packs. 


It’s cooler today, in the 70s and there are gusts of wind that suggest rain is coming.  I have a quick break at a shelter just over halfway up. And then just keep gamboling up to the summit where views can reach 90 miles on a good day.  


Today is not a good day and it is a complete mist out at the top. I go to the lodge where I plan to have lunch and ….it is closed. Just a piece of paper on the door ‘can’t be arsed to open because it’s raining and we don’t give a damn about hikers’ or maybe it just said CLOSED, I can’t remember. 


I’ve only got 2 snack bars so it’s going to be a long afternoon.  To improve matters it starts to chuck it down with rain. There’s a tiny 4ft square of shelter under an arch and I dive in to find Laygo, a NOBO, already in there.  It’s a very heavy shower and over the next few minutes two day hikers and Nighthawk (another NOBO) arrive soaked to the skin and huddle together with us. The day hikers have food and start feeding me and it’s a sociable party for 15 minutes or so. Perhaps a more enjoyable party for the two of us that are dry?




The rain suddenly stops and we all dash out to start along the ridge and down the mountain.The ridge walk is cool and I keep my rain jacket on to warm up.After the second summit, the descent is slippery. It’s not too rocky but I have two near misses and then one comedy sliding fall. 


Just before town, I meet Nighthawk and we amble the last half mile to the  Route 2 highway where Dave is picking me up. 


No views but a good day and what turned into 15 easy miles with an actual hiking time of less than 6 hours.  A great day to slack pack. Back to normality tomorrow!","Cheshire

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656260,"I wake in the comfort of a hotel bed, take a bath and then head out to buy enough food for up to 4 days out on the trail. 


At 10, I go to Mass MOCA for a wander around the contemporary art gallery housed in a series of huge warehouses for a couple of hours. It is excellent, particularly the three floors of Sol LeWitt artworks.  It is a relaxing and inspiring way to spend a morning off trail.  Batteries recharging!


Dave picks me up at 1 at my hotel and drops me back on the trail.  At first, my pack feels worryingly heavy, partly because it has 4 days food in it. And partly because I hiked without it yesterday. 


Within an hour, the feeling of over heaviness had gone and I am (almost) bouncing along again. It’s amazing how quickly the human brain and body react to and accommodate change. 


The first 4 miles are uphill, all fairly easy because of the forgiving  Massachusetts terrain. For me it’s been the easiest and one of the most enjoyable states to hike on the AT to date. The are roots and rocks but enough decent footing to hike with your head up sometimes rather than always staring at your stumbling feet.


As a sting in the tail, the final summit in Mass has me stumbling and cursing up and over a horrible jumble of leg sapping boulders for about 300 feet.  Part of my cursing is because there are no markings on the rocks so not only is it painful but also hard to figure which way I should be heading.  Straight up is usually right on the AT and that proves true yet again. 


After the summit, I leave the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts to enter the mere State of Vermont.  Vermont is famous for ….errr…mud…and despite the lack of rain recently it’s my first experience of regular mud on the trail. 


Tonight’s shelter is only 7 miles from my start point and I reach it after 3 hours or so.  There’s a lot of hikers at camp tonight, both north and southbounders and it’s a sociable meet and greet occasion where everyone smells bad.  I am happy to see Gummy Bear and The Mechanic, two great guys walking NOBO that I’d like to stick around as they are good company. 


An enjoyable short day and I am in good spirits.  I might even be starting to enjoy myself?!","Route 2 Highway
",Seth Warner Shelter,"Aug 10, Wed",6.90
Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656272,"Up at 5.15 and out of camp at 6am. My plans for a 13.5 or a 21 mile day are kibooshed by a blocked water filter. 
I use my filter 3 or 4 times a day to fill water bottles from streams and in the heat it is a vital bit of kit. I need to replace it immediately and that means heading to the next town, which is Bennington, a mere 11.6 miles away.  
On the bright side, I’ll be visiting a town in Vermont for the first time in my life. And I like visiting trail towns…
Prince Charming (a nice lad from Nebraska) lends me his water filter so I set off with  1.7litres to last the day.  I make good pace and while I am walking I book myself a cheap $60 motel in town. Though the owner does ask me to ring back ‘at 8 when we open’ when I first call at 7.15.  Jeez, I’ve been up 2 hours…
I pass Beaver Pond. I see no beavers but it is a beautiful spot that makes me wish I could sit and watch the wildlife for an hour or two. Instead, I put some leg muscle into a long uphill section. 
I make the 7.2 miles to Congden Shelter just after 9am.  There’s cell reception so I message with family and friends at home and check the football news. I also chat to Magic Hat and his friend  who are 1600 miles into their hike. 
I ask for their top tip and they tell me that would section hike the AT and not try and do it in one go.  If I asked them tomorrow or next week they’d say something else.  Moods swing with the wind on the AT. 
The 4 mile drop into route 9 starts kind but turns mean. The last mile is a widow maker of jagged tumbling rocks. My thighs hop and my calves are cramping.  But word of trail magic at the car park keeps me focusing on the prize.  And in the car park, that prize is an ice cream sandwich and a Gatorade.
A car pulls in and it is the free 5 mile shuttle to Bennington included in the $60 Catamount motel rate. The driver is the motel owner.
The afternoon is spent going to Walmart for a new water filter.  
In the evening, I got to town for food and beer.  Bennington is buzzing with a classic car ‘cruise in’.  I love the car body and interior designs of yesteryear but in these times of rapid climate change the exposed engines might seem like a  human middle finger to the other occupants of our planet.  They are certainly a positive example of the human  ingenuity we will need to clean up the mess we’ve made. And my mind jumps to the memory or the recent ‘e-fair’ in Eastbourne showing the last electric bikes and cars.  Buffalo wings, pizza and beer are all excellent at the 421 restaurant and brew pub. I walk up the hill to my motel at 8pm filling full and ready for bed.","Seth Warner Shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656366,"I get a lift to the trail at 8.15 with nighthawk (a NOBO and dry stone waller by trade) and a Canadian hiker. The driver asks if we need any weed which is legal in Vermont.  We all politely decline. 
I am now around a bubble of hikers every day, some north and some southbound.  I don’t see many people whilst hiking but I am aware of who is up front and who is behind me.  As I set off at the trailhead, another shuttle turns up with  Magic Hat and Racoon man. 
I want to push myself to do a few more miles today. So I work heard to keep pace with Nighthawk up the first climb.   And I keep working hard without a break for four hours and 8.9 miles to Goddard Shelter, just below the summit of Glastenbury Mountain, at 3750 feet. 
I have a good lunch for 45 minutes. in the shelter, bang on the trail with flowing water a few feet away. 
I miss the highlight of day, the great views from the fire tower because I am chased by a dog, which first appeared friendly and then not so much!  By the time I had escaped I was 0.2 mile past the tower, and I wasn’t about to turn back  
I crack on for another two hours of mainly downhill hiking through roots and rocks, with the occasional steep small up for variety. After two hours I stop at the Kid Gore shelter which boosts a great view, and catch up with Unicorn and Reading Couch.  A snickers and some water and I am off again. 
The last 5 miles of my day are a slog, though I have the sense of positive achievement of walking 19 miles today. A good effort over a sizeable mountain. The Fulhamish podcast keeps me going for the last hour. 
At the Story Spring shelter there are a bunch of Brits I have not met before. - Emma, Baby Goat, Snooze, and Summertime from the US. They are all nobos who’ve been ill or injured and had to jump 500 miles or so up trail to ensure they finish the northern section before the ending of the trail closes in mid October. 
Magic Hat and Racoon Man arrive at the shelter about 90 minutes after me. They eat and push on in the dark to find a camping spot further up the trail. Christian - an older NOBO - comes in when it is pitch dark and sets up his tent expertly. He’s from Boston, a very slow but also supremely  tenacious hiker.  It is due to be colder tonight, about 50F, so I have pitched my tent rather than sleeping in the shelter as I only have my summer quilt and a sleeping bag liner.","Route 9 , Bennington

The first rocky scramble is a struggle, and despite the terrain being ok for the day ahead I am not feeling good. A sore back and knee and a lack of sleep make me grumpy.  A mile in I take a blue blaze shortcut to miss the main mountain of the day and lol at the quickest way to get into town.No cell reception means I can’t ring for a hostel bed or listen to Fulham on the radio.

I shop for supplies for four days, three nights and 55 miles in the Vermont wilderness at Price Chopper. It’s expensive but it does have my main go to food items: wraps; salami, cheese, rocket, red pepper, packs of tuna and Idahoan mashed potatoes; and wide variety of energy bars. 
I get a shuttle to the trail from the folks at Green Mountain hostel for $7, and a few other hikers from the free camping at VFW also jump in. 
The big event today is a climb up and over Bromley mountain. Near the peak it opens to green pasture and there are great views all around. Some visitors have come up the ski lift for the view.  They are friendly and despite my smell they chat to me about my hike and take a photo for me at the summit. 
The next two lower summits of Styles Peak and Peru Peak have trees so no views. The rest of the afternoon is downhill to the spiffy Peru Peak Shelter.  I have an enjoyable dinner and breakfast with Shadow (a NOBO) and Ali, a teacher from Vermont who is hiking 50 miles of the Long Traill that follows the AT for  about 100 miles before heading up to Canada.","Manchester

I eat breakfast with Ali and Shadow and hit the trail at 7.45.  Early enough for a 15 mile day with no major climbs. 
The first 6 miles passes Griffith Lake and offers lots of photo opportunities. There’s a mile or so of duck boards which make for enjoyably springy walking. I filter water from Branch Brook and fill up my two water bottles. 
The next 3 or so miles to Lost Pond Shelter are slower as the hiking is technical with lots of roots and rocks and there is the chunk of rock of Baker Peak (2771ft) to scramble over.  This is tough enough to have a bad weather alternative but today with the rock dry I find my inner goat and get up and over it. 
I eat lunch at the Lost Pond shelter. The usual wrap of salami, cheese, red pepper and rocket. During lunch I write yesterday’s journal. 
I walk along the lake for just over a mile and then fill up my water bottles before heading up the last 3.7 miles to tonight’s shelter. The Greenwall shelter has no reliable  water source so I collect 2.5 litres for my pack. 
I go straight up a rocky climb which is harder with an extra 2.5kilos and my shoulders feel the weight.  It’s a struggle. As are all of the next 3 or so miles of rocky undulating terrain.  
I’m shattered when I get to the shelter but glad to be here.  The AT in Vermont is great hiking with fine views.  The lack of almost any mobile signal makes it a true wilderness experience! Ali and Shadow make it too so another evening of good company

I stop for water at Bully Brook, having walked 1.6 miles rather than 0.8 miles to get there.  Despite my error, I remain in a good mood as it’s my son’s birthday and I’m thinking happy thoughts. I pass Ali half way up the first hill of the day and catch Shadow just before Domed Ledge.  
I’m feeling good this morning and hike 9.1 miles to the shelter where I plan lunch.  Shadow arrives soon after me and we chat about his hunting in Michigan whist eating and resting up.   A family of Dutch tourists,  who are day hiking also make a surprise appearance. 
After lunch there’s a wickedly steep but thankfully fairly short climb up to Beacon Hill.  
The rest of the afternoon is mildly uphill as we edge towards Mt Killington.  It rains for an hour to liven things up. Like others, I hike faster, as I always seem to do when it rains.  Probably to get out of it!
At just under 15 miles for the day, Governor Clement Shelter is a welcome sight. Though it’s dilapidated, with no bear box and no picnic bench. 
For the second night in a row, I set up my bear line over a tree branch before making dinner. After dinner, I hoist my food, cooking pot and toiletries high enough to be out of a bear’s reach.

No time for coffee this morning, so I eat a honey bun for breakfast and put some electrolytes in my water bottle and set out. 
It’s a long two and a half hour climb to make the 2000ft up to the shelter near the summit of Mount Killington. I have a bite of a cliff bar and some water before I set off up to the summit without my pack, which I leave by a tent platform. 
It’s a difficult, rock strewn  climb but worth it to be up at 4000ft for the first time. It’s cloudy but the clouds are mostly below me. And despite the clouds there are spectacular views.  The descent is harder but I feel elated from the achievement. 
When I get down the remainder of my cliff bar has gone.  A chipmunk has had it and it keeps coming back whilst I make coffee to see if it will get more food. The Vermont chipmunks are more assertive than those elsewhere! 
I work hard for the 6 mile descent to catch a bus at 12.20 to Rutland.  I would have just caught the bus but I am lucky to get a ride with Shazam a finished thru hiker who has come back to see some friends. He drives me direct to my hotel and will not take money for gas.

I plod very slowly up 1300ft of hill. I get a good rhythm going, changing the length of my step as the hill gets steeper but keeping the same cadence.

The next few miles are a bit easier going. I stop for lunch at another shelter at 9.9 miles, taking a good 45 minutes rest  
I eat my usual wrap for lunch. For dessert, I go with a peanut butter and dried blueberry wrap. Surprisingly good!  I manage to collect some water from a very slow running spring which is a relief as I was almost out. 


After lunch, I hike 4 miles through the usual green tunnel but also some beautiful open pasture with wildflowers and butterflies.  After a couple of hours I get to a road, and walk north for a few hundred yard to a farm shop. I gorge myself on ice cream, a fresh cranberry and orange muffin, a coke and a packet of crisps/chips.


The last 0.7 mile of the day is up a steep hill to a flat camping spot in the woods. It’s a nice place to be on a warm dry evening, with a gentle cool breeze as the sun goes down.  The lack of moisture in the air offers some respite from mosquitos and means my hiking clothes stay dry when hung out overnight.

We have discovered that we can stay for free at the ‘Blue Barn’ tonight in West Hartford. This gives us just over 12 miles to hike rather than our previously planned 16 odd miles. 



The hiking is the usual pleasure that has been Vermont, soft going and switchbacks up the bigger mountains. Also, the green tunnel is occasionally broken by pastures full of wild flowers, butterflies and birds. It reminds me of home!I get to the Blue Barn about 3.30. I’m invited to grab a soda and some water melon from the porch and introduced to Linda Hart, the owner. 


Linda and her family were greatly impacted by floods during Storm Irene, as their house was under water up to the first floor and their van was swept away by the raging river. She and her family survived by climbing the hill behind their house. They were not insured and have had to slowly rebuild. 


Despite this, Linda opens her now mostly rebuilt property to hikers, allowing them to sleep in the barn or camp in her garden. She offers a constant flow of food and coffee and muffins from 6am. She’s also good company and clearly enjoys chatting to the hiking community.  There’s a jar for cash donations but she rarely mentions its existence.  From my time at her property, she seems a genuinely kind and hospitable person as are the rest of her family. And they are perhaps the best example in my experience to date of the community that serves AT thru hikers. Though the fresh baked bread pudding brought along for us by cousin Kim may be affecting my judgement!

Today’s one large 1200ft of ascent is spread over about 4 miles and is fairly easy going, though it is a very hot morning. After the ascent, the trail undulates for a few miles before dropping into Norwich, the last city on the trail in Vermont. 


Norwich is picture postcard pretty and the well dressed locals seem very friendly to hikers, with almost everyone I pass saying hello as I walk down Elm Street and Main Street. 


It is now very hot and the road walk over the bridge to Hanover and then up a steep hill into the centre of Hanover is frankly a drag. I’m glad of my long sleeve sun hoody and lightweight Patagonia trousers though to the locals I bet I don’t look dressed for summer! 


My mood improves quickly in town when I met Giggles and Aiden, two young Nobos, who invite me to lunch with friends.  Friends who turn out to include Raccoon Man and Magic Hat, two other thru hikers that I’ve met before and like.

We eventually got back on the trail in Hanover at  8.30. I climbed hiked nearly 17 miles today and climbed almost 4000 feet and yet I had a relatively easy day, taking an hour for lunch and arriving in camp at 5pm.New Hampshire started where Vermont left off, with meandering long climbs on mostly leaves and soil, with the odd steeper section to keep me honest. This will only last one more day and then I will be in the rocky White Mountains, with 9 peaks higher than Ben Nevis. I feel great all morning and the break has clearly been good for my energy level.  I’ve got to a nice point with hiking up mountains in that I am generally get up in one go at a steady pace without blowing too hard.  Though I am soaked in sweat on every uphill as it remains hot and humid all day  The last 1200 foot climb up to The Ledges was a tougher test at the end of the day but It had the benefit of offering fantastic views at several points near the summit. I pitch my tent at Trapper John shelter as the shelter itself is full of noisy Harvard students who have walked up from the road a mile or so away for a night of fun in camp.  I think perhaps this shelter should be renamed as Crapper John as the privy is close to overflowing!","Hanover

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656929,"I woke at 6 and left the camp site at 7.45.  With Shadow around there are no quick getaways. And we were joined in conversation this morning by Jolly Lobster.  Jolly knows his history and we had fin chatting. The first 6 miles up Smarts Mountain (3237ft) to the fire tower were tough. I made the miles and the 2300 feet of elevation in just under 4 hours.  And I was happy with that given the rough terrain and the tough rock scrambling in many sections. I get a wriggle on for the next 4 miles of downhill as I need to make a pick for a hostel tonight and there are 12 plus miles to go. And another big mountain to get up and down. I am a bit reckless down the rocky sections which are wet, surviving the 4 miles in an hour and a quarter. Lightning fast for me. Next it’s a steep climb up to a ledge with a bit of a view, followed by a long climb up to the Quartzite Ledges, which are scarily slippy but offer a great view at the top. I muster my remaining energy for a last ascent up The Cube (2909ft) which has a bald top and outstanding views. I call the hostel to say I am 1.5 hours from my road pick up point. And quickly eat my lunch and chat to an Irish NOBO called Frost Bite. I make another rapid descent of 3.3 miles to the road, using speedy feet and jumps to navigate the most slippery rocky sections, It’s a high stakes game but it’s good to make quick miles.The hostel owner takes me to Walmart to resupply with foods for the next 3 days and then on to the hostel.I reflect positively on the hardest day since I’ve been back on trial. It was difficult, but I’ve got my trail legs back and I’m confident getting up the big climbs and making the miles.","Trapper John Shelter

I saunter along knowing that I only have 10.8 miles of forgiving terrain to hike today.  This will take me to the foot of Mount Moosilauke, my first 4000ft mountain on the trail.  (Mount Killington in Vermont was up a side spur)


After 4 miles, I take a 45 minute break by the first stream of the day. I collect water and sit chatting with Fi on WhatsApp.  Papa Bear joins me and we chat trail and about family back home. 


I amble along for another 2.9 miles and then take a side ‘blue blaze’ alternate trail to Wachipauka Pond. Frost Bite (from Ireland) is already there and takes a swim. I laze about eating my lunch and chat to her for an hour.  


The final 3 miles for the day take me to the foot of Mount Moosilauke.  I am content that climbing over that 4000ft monster can wait until tomorrow even though it’s only 2.45pm. 


I set up camp, book my hostel for tomorrow night and check the weather.  It looks fine until mid afternoon tomorrow when heavy rain is due. 


I got to bed at 7.30pm and set a very early alarm so I can be off the mountain before the rain. It’s only 8 miles tomorrow but there are 5 very steep miles up and 3 even steeper miles down so I am expecting to make slow progress.","Highway 25A

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657040,"Not a great day. 


I get up at 4.30am and am on trail by 5.30am, hiking in the dark using my head torch as the sun is yet to rise.  I’m up this early as a thunderstorm is predicted for some time after noon and the Moosilauke mountain descent for today has a fearsome reputation. 


I get about 1.5 miles up the mountain when it starts to rain fairly hard. I’m not sure if this is a sudden shower or the start of the forecast thunderstorm. 


I think about my options, as my plan B is to walk back down the same way I am walking up if the heavy rain comes before or when I am at the summit. But heavy rain now so early in the day is hugely disheartening as it means the vertigo inducing descent will be wet and slippery even if I do beat the thunderstorm. 


With a heavy heart, I turn back choosing not to get caught up the top of the mountain in heavy rain and knowing that I want to avoid a wet descent. 


As I get back to the shelter the rain stops and I start second guessing my decision.  But after chatting with Fi via text I walk back down to route 25 and get a shuttle to my hostel for the night. 


I only walked a few miles of my intended 8.4 today but on the bright side I’m safe and in good shape and ready to go again tomorrow. 


Having talked to other hikers at the hostel about the difficult of tomorrow’s hike, I’ve arranged to slack pack the 13.5 miles over South and North Kinsman to the Lonesome Lake hut. And the weather looks set fair.","Jeffers Brook shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657126,"I am slack packing today, carrying just what I need for a day hike in Louis’ old string school bag.   


Tonight I am staying in my first Appalachian Mountain Club Hut.  It’s a basic bunkhouse with a composting toilet and cold water sinks. But no showers or electric sockets.  What’s great is that in the main hut they serve a full three  course dinner and breakfast.  Also providing hot drinks and baked products all day. 


I get dropped off at the Beavers Brook trailhead just before 8am, along with Resupply and Road Rash.  We are all slack packing because today’s section has a tough reputation. 


Resupply and I immediately start hiking together up the first steep stack of rocks. And it’s clear that we both like to chat and have similar pace.  


The first 6/7 miles of the day are all about getting to the base of South Kinsman Mountain.We’re mostly going up and the terrain is tough with plenty of Lego brick tumble rock climbs and slanting boulders to run up, or skirt up by grabbing trees at the side  of the trail.  It’s foggy and damp but sunshine is due later. 


Thankfully, most of the rock is grabby on the soles of my shoes and despite feeling precarious at times I don’t fall despite a few slips. The trail is also muddy in places so after a couple of 10 minute water stops we’re happy to make the 6 miles up in just over 3 hours.  I would have been at least an hour slower with my full backpack. 


The climb up South Kinsman is extremely tough, with a lot of big boulder scrambles and some excruciatingly steep steps.  The only positive is that the trail goes pretty straight up and it’s ONLY 2.5 miles to the summit. 


We stop and have lunch at 4300 feet in the sun at a small bald (no tree area) with truly fantastic views.  I feel elated and make celebratory poses for a set of summit photos. 


The summit of South Kinsman Mountain (4358ft) is 0.1 further up the trail but it’s tree covered so we choose the right lunch spot.A mile further on we reach the peak of North Kinsman , our second 4000 foot mountain of the day and similarly lost in trees. 
The downhill is painful as always and dangerous at multiple points.Thoughtfully, there are occasional wooden and metal steps bolted into some of the bare rock faces to descend. But getting down is tortuously slow as usual.
I arrive at the AMC hut at 3.30pm, have a coffee and write my journal.  Dinner is  at 6 and I am starving! 


In the morning, I will pick up my backpack that last night’s hostel (the old ski colony) will drop at the trailhead another 3 miles down the trail.

Shadow made it to the hut just before 8pm last night, after almost 12 hours hiking. It was good to chat and compare horror stories about the trail last night and this morning over breakfast. 


I head out straight after breakfast to get 3 miles along the trail and a mile along a side trail to pick up my full back pack. 


Resupply sent me a text with a photo showing me where my pack was hidden. I was glad to find it but not so glad to put it on again. 


I called and chatted with Louis and spent almost an hour checking the news and social media. 


I walk  back up the spur  trail and rejoin the AT.  It is only 2.5 miles to the Liberty Springs campsite just shy of the Franconia Ridge. But the last mile is straight up and is a very slow hike. Fortunately no big boulders to navigate so no scrambling but tough enough up and up and up hill for 2400 feet of height gain with a full pack. 


The campsite is organised by the AMC. It only has wooden tent pads and it takes me some time to pitch my trekking pole tent on one.Not a great pitch but with no bad weather due it will do. 


Weather is meant to be good again tomorrow so I will attempt a 10.4 mile hike along the ridge and over at least four more 4000ft plus mountain summits to the Galehead Hut.  A short day but a few more miles along the trail.","Lonesome Lake Hut

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657226,"Out at 7.30am with Steady Stream.  Shadow is still packing up. He is delayed searching for his lost his cooking pot. 


It’s a leg warming 0.3 up to the Franconia Ridge. Initially, there’s no view but after an hour of clambering up Little Haystacks I am above tree line.  Near summits the fir trees get smaller and smaller. That and the cooler air are the most encouraging signs whenever I am climbing. 


It’s foggy up top and there is no view. I have no trouble following the trail which is well maintained and clearly marked with additional cairns.  I meet a ‘summit ranger’ and she tells me I have crossed  the summit of Mount Lincoln without noticing it. 


Getting up to Lafayette, the tallest peak of the day at 5600ft takes a bit more graft. There is still no view but the sun is trying to burn off the mist. I get a free fleeting glimpses of row upon row of mountains silhouetted in the far distance. 


As I start the precipitous descent of Lafayette the views open up and I take a lot of photos.  I can see the Garfield ridge and mountain that I am about to hike.I stop at Garfield pond for water but it’s too boggy for me to get close enough to collect.  I start up Mount Garfield a steep but not too testing 500ft or so of climbing.  The descent is hideous and includes a hike down a waterfall.  Not next to a waterfall but actually down it!  Hairy stuff and I make tortuously slow progress. There’s a final 0.6 steep rocky ascent to the hut that I fly up and I am hungry and ready to be off trail for the day.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657324,"I set out at 8.30 after a full breakfast at the Galehead Hut. 


I have just shy of 7 miles to walk to the next hut at Zealand Falls.  


The first 0.8 miles is straight up to the summit of South Twin Mountain at 4900 feet. This is not as bad as it sounds as the hut is at 3800 feet so it’s a one thousand one hundred foot climb.  I get up in one go, building up a sweat and getting into the swing of the day. 


The summit offers a spectacular 360 degree panoramic view. I pause to  take some photos and almost go the wrong way off the mountain.  I avoid this by checking my online map just I am about to go down the wrong trail. 


I descend for a while then climb above the Guyot Spur at 4200 feet where I enjoy a million Christmas tree view.   The next mountain, Zealand at 4260 ft provides no view and I don’t stop there, preferring a comfy rock seat a half a mile further on for a snack and some water. Lara bars are my current favourite. 



The last few miles are downhill to the Zealand Falls hut. There are a few sketchy sections but the rocks are mostly dry and I get down safe and sound.
I get to the hut at 1pm, after 4.5 hours hiking, with sore knees and ankles from the awkward descents of the past few days.   Even when I push hard my average pace in New Hampshire is closer to 1 to 1.5 mph than the 2 to 2.5 mph I have achieved elsewhere on the trail to date. 


I consider pressing on as it’s early in the day but decide to stick to my plan to do shorter days through the White Mountains. 


I am enjoying  the catered AMC hut experience,  as they feel like a throw back to the youth hostels of 1970’s Britain.  Built and run to serve hikers, and catering for but not pandering to folks wanting a weekend break in the mountains.  The mix of people in each hut makes them a fun and educating experience.  They also have book libraries which make me happy! 


Shadow and Willow have ‘work for stay’ deals at the hut. They are staying for free but must clean up after dinner and breakfast and only eat after all the other hikers are finished.

After another filling AMC hut breakfast, the staff read the daily weather report for the summits and valleys. The threatened storm passed over last night so today is a better day than previously predicted.  I decide to walk 14 miles rather than the seven I had planned last night. I leave the hut about 8 am  
From Zealand Hut to route 302 are easy miles.  Five miles of relatively flat trail followed by a kindly descent to the road. I fill up with water from the River Saco and continue.
I am ready for a serious climb up the Webster Mointain (3920ft) from the road  and so it proves to be for 2.9 miles of unrelenting rocky suffering. On the way up I take a break at the Webster Cliffs to catch up with home as I find the first cell signal for over 24 hours. To reach the summit, I scramble up an exposed rocky cliff face for 0.4 miles. I pack my trekking poles and manage it without any drama. Though I am careful never to look down!The view from the summit is great but the wind has been picking up and the sky looks ominous. I press on, down a few hundred feet and along a ridge and then up Mount Jackson (4052ft).  The last 0.1 up Jackson again requires some backpack bouldering!
From the peak of Jackson the Mizpah Sorings Hut is visible, lonely in a sea of pine trees. I find some more pace and reach the hut at 3.30pm. There is only one other thru hiker here, a SIBO called Tim. I am so smelly I get given an eight person. Ink room all to myself.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657426,"I started from the AMC Highland Lodge at 5.50 am.  This was going to be a big day and I needed an early start. 


I sped up the 2.7 miles and 1000ft of ascent back up to the AT, working hard to arrive just past the Mizpah Springs hut at 7.30am. 


I soon leave the tree line,  entering the alpine zone, to hike the 4.7 miles to the Lake of the Clouds Hut.   


With a clear sky, I have wonderful views opening up in every direction with visibility up to 80 miles.  That said, I struggle to see my way with the low sun and soon hit my head on a tree branch. Nothing serious but I swear like a trooper and a bump is growing.  


I have great pace today and reach the hut at 9.30. 


I get a coffee and some cake. There is excitement in the hut as a helicopter is on its way with supplies.  I leave the hut and wait a few hundred feet up the trail.   I watch the helicopter fly in and land precariously by the hut.   Most of these huts are in inaccessible wilderness making supplying them expensive, hence the hefty costs to stay at these simple lodgings. 


I start up the 1.5 miles to the summit of Mount Washington. There’s a sign warning people to turn back in bad weather as the next 8 miles of ridge have the worst weather in the USA, and have claimed the lives of many hikers. I am enjoying a beautiful sunny day so I feel safe to continue. 


Near the top,  I miss the sign to head up to the peak and walk along the wrong trail, missing the summit entirely.  When I realise my mistake I am almost a mile from the summit.  I bite the bullet, drop my pack and head back up the trail as fast as I can, running in places.  I am gasping when I reach the peak of Mount Washington, at over 6000ft. But happy to have made it.  There’s no more than a fresh breeze on the mountain, famous for the world’s highest recorded wind speed of over 200mph. 


I meet Shadow in the cafeteria and he tells me to calm down (as I am jabbering about getting lost) and to eat something and take my time.  I do calm down a bit whilst I eat half a sandwich, some crisps and a soda.   And then take a quick summit photo before legging it back downhill to my backpack. 


Today was going to be a long day and now I’ve added another 1.8 miles to it due to my navigational error.  I sit by my pack and eat the rest of my sandwich, eat chocolate snacks and drink water. 


The afternoon offers consistently stunning views for more than 6 miles but also some very tough hiking across boulder fields for miles and miles on end on the ridge. 
The trail passes close to the summits of Mount Jefferson and Adams but I don’t have the energy to walk the extra distance and height up the side trails to bag these peaks. I therefore send my respects to these two giants from a slightly lower position, befitting their stature and mine!


About 3.30pm, I reach the Madison Springs Hut near the end of the ridge to finish what has been the most spectacular hike of my life and my first time up a 6000ft mountain. 


It was perhaps also one of my strongest ever hikes as I made a lot of elevation at good pace and my rock hopping speed and sure footedness is improving. 


I covered almost 12 miles of the AT today, though the extra miles back up to Mizpah Springs hut in the morning and my costly diversion in Washington meant I hiked over 16 miles in total. What a Wally!

I leave about 8am and within a few paces of the hut, I am slowly making my way up Mount Madison (5367ft).  The views from Madison are stunning and today again visibility is 120 miles.  It’s difficult to comprehend how many other mountains I can see from the summit.  More of a hazy lunar landscape than a countryside view. 
The 3 miles of descent from Madison to get off the presidential ridge are brutally hard going.  I navigate very slowly through piles of jagged rocks, sometimes fear provokingly steep and always painful on the toes and knees. I take almost 3 hours to descend 3 miles to the Osgood campsite, where I take a break and collect some water. 
The gradient gradually eases and the 4.8 miles down to Pinkham Notch are unremarkable. Except, another tree branch attacks my head. This time, I am crossing a stream by hopping from rock to rock when I jump into a low hanging branch which stops me dead and plonks both my feet in the water.  As I am wearing a cap, I just carry on and hope it soaks up any blood!! The new bump is next to the one I got yesterday. Arriving at Pinkham Notch is surreal as from the wilderness I am now in a huge car park and visitor centre full of day trippers.

I am a little nervous today.  Thunderstorms are predicted for early afternoon and the next hut  on the trail is fully booked.  That means I either have to walk 13 miles over very challenging terrain or find a stealth camp spot, ideally before the rain. The trail undulates for a half a mile and then it turns steeply uphill. 
After a few minutes. I see Māori up ahead and he waits for me.  We then spend the morning hiking together, first up Wildcat Summit D at just over 4000, which takes 3 hours to climb but feels longer as it’s one of the harder seemingly never ending ascents on the AT.  And it takes us another hour to reach the main Wildcat Summit at 4442ft.  


We take a break for water and snacks and take in the view. I keep well away from the immense sheer drop from the peak’s best viewpoint as my vertigo or ‘don’t die now reflex’ kicks in. 


I drink the last of my water and eat a snickers bar.  The mile down to the Carter Notch hut has steps the whole way like something from my perfect dream descent. Māori and I decide the descent should be renamed as Ernie’s Stairs. 


Whilst in the hut, I start chatting to Hope, one of the croo.  She shares that she was adopted and I tell her that I am too. I ask about good stealth camp sites further up the trail, and she asks whether I would like to do ‘work for stay’.   I agree immediately as it means I will stay dry overnight as I get to sleep in the hut for free and eat dinner with the staff, saving £120.  


My work is to clean the double glazed bathroom windows which are full of flies and other insects. I quite enjoy it and I’m done in 90 minutes.

I want to leave before the 7am hut breakfast, so Hope kindly makes me some porridge with oat milk. It is delicious and I am grateful enough for this and other kindnesses from the Croo to leave a good tip. 


I walk out into the drizzle with a plan to hike 15 miles to route 2 and a hotel in Gorham.   Plan B is to stop at a shelter at 13 miles, with Plan C a shelter at 7 miles.  


The start of the day, the first 7 miles over Carter Dome and three more peaks on the ridge line, and a hairy descent to Imp shelter will be tough and much harder in the rain. The second half of the day has the final mountain in the Whites, and then it’s all downhill. 


Optimistically, I leave the hut in shorts and a t shirt. I know I’ll get wet but I move fast to keep warm. The hike up Carter Dome is super steep rock scrambling and steps to start with and it has me panting.  The climb softens about half way up and by the time I reach the summit it is easy going. No view today as I am blanketed in cloud. That’s 2.1 miles done. 


I set about the next three summits in the Carter range that are along an undulating ridge. Three more down and up hikes to summits on rocks, roots and now large puddles. 


After the third summit, I start down to Imp shelter. They should give ropes out for this descent! It’s scarier in the rain and I use every trick I can: throwing poles down and scrambling, shuffling down on my ass, and going down near vertical rock faces backwards.  I consider throwing my pack down at one point but worry it will roll off the edge of the trail. 


During the descent I start to get cold as I am soaking wet and picking my way slowly.  When I get to the hut marker, I fly down the 0.3 to the shelter to get out of the rain.  I change all my clothes, make coffee and eat a snickers. After 30 minutes, I put my waterproofs on and head back to the trail. 


I hike up Moriah Mountain (4049ft) in a cloud between the pine trees decreasing in size to show my ascent.   There are 2 or 3 places that could have been the summit of Moriah but I missed it wherever it was and the 0.1 spur that would have taken me to the very top.  I am walking up and down in an inescapable cloud!!


Once down from Moriah the trail becomes easier, and the last 4 miles are a joy of gently descending trail along the Rattle River bank, albeit in pouring rain. 


I reach the car park and wonder how I will make the 2 miles into Gorham.  A guy winds down his window and asks if I’d like a soda.  I reply no thanks but that I could really use a lift into town.  His hiker name is Iceman and he’s a trail angel supporting thru hiking friends and other hikers.  Iceman takes me all the way to my hotel and does not ask for any money for gas.  A true gentleman of a trail angel.


Moriah was the last mountain on the AT in the Whites. And 15.2 miles today means Mt Katahdin is now only 298 miles away. I may have a beer tonight!","Carter Notch

I am in a funk today, not looking forward to the first 100 miles of hiking in Maine and generally feeling fed up with the daily grind of hard hiking. 
I am only planning to walk 7 miles but given the terrain I expect this to take about 7 hours.  I climb Carlo Col view for the first half a mile and then start on the three mountain summits on an undulating ridge line; Goose Eye West, East and North.
 I put on my headphones and listen to Jack’s Immaculate Vibez playlist on Spotify.  I trudge along and zone out, barely taking in the above the clouds views on the summits.  I cuss the bogs and the mud and the steep climbs and the slippery descents.  I fall twice, just slips and nothing worse than grazed hands. I am not using my hiking poles this morning as there is a lot of scrambling and my right shoulder is sore from yesterday’s fall. 
The music is helping and I pass a couple of hikers who left the shelter much earlier than me. And then catch TK, Chipmunk and Patience, a little NOBO tramily. They are good company and I walk with them until the Goose Eye Shelter, where we have lunch at about 12.30. Stove Top arrives about 30 minutes later and joins us.

The AT throws in an annoyingly steep and scrambling climb for half a mile and then the usual terrifying descent for a mile down to the infamous notch. On the descent my cap falls off down a 20 ft crevice and is lost.  I arrive at the start of the notch at 1.50pm, hoping to complete the 0.9 mile in under 2 hours.  Without my cap my glasses will fall off, so I use my snood as a type of ninja headband, a look improved by my two hiking poles sticking up from the back of my pack. 
The notch is a steep valley floor with huge boulders at every angle blocking the way through.  As a AT thru hiker, the trick is to find a way to pass these giant rocks by any means possible.   Where it looks impossible there are a few holes to push packs through and crawl under. 
I find that within a few hundred yards I love the challenge of the notch.  It’s a huge hiker playground and every few yards presents a new challenge. It reminds me of the army assault course I used to enjoy as a teenage cadet. It helps that I have long legs and enjoy risky rock hopping.  I only take my pack off once to squeeze through a hole, the rest of the time I clamber over every obstacle. I finish the whole notch in a very respectable 80 minutes. 
I immediately fill my water bottles and look for the camp site. I find it just 0.2 along the trail.  My day is done at 3pm. 
Dinner is Idahoan instant mashed potato, tuna, a little tub of black olives and some chilli flakes all mixed together. Dessert is a snickers bar.","Carlo Col shelter

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657701,"I wake at 6, after a good night’s sleep in my tent. I make coffee, eat chocolate raisin porridge (again) and pack my gear.  It’s just after 7.30 when I leave camp. 
Less than half a mile in, I stop to collect and filter a litre of water. I start the climb up The Arm, which I know is one of the hardest climbs on the AT, full of confidence after the fun I’d had scrambling through Mahoosuc Notch yesterday. I keep my poles stashed on the back of my pack and enjoy climbing up the granite slab.  
The Arm is steep with steps in places but more often large expanses of granite slabs that I monkey up on all fours or skirt the edges using pine trees for leverage.  I’m in a zone this morning and enjoy the long tough climb. At the summit, there’s a great above the clouds view. A nice reward for a punishing hour and a half of effort. 
The descent is a little sketchy but not too bad by AT standards. I dive with some urgency down a side trail to a shelter to use the privy. It might suit bears to shit in the woods, but it’s really not my thing if I can avoid it. 
I soon start up Old Speck, another mountain which is a rocky jumble lower down and as I ascend develops into another granite slab climb, though adding half a mile of above the tree line exposed scrambling for good measure. Not a climb I would like to do on a wet or even worse a windy day. At the summit the sun is shining and I have 3 bars of AT&T!!!  I stop for a break catching up with Fi and also my good friend Jim who has just returned to the UK from a work trip to Thailand. 
I phone the motel I am staying at tonight to ask for a shuttle pick up at 1.15pm.  3.5 miles of downhill walking is dull and painful on the feet and joints. I slip over twice more on the descent, thankfully more embarrassing than painful.
I arrive at the trailhead and Kevin the motel owner is waiting for me. The Bethel Village Hotel is 25 miles from the AT but they offer cheap shuttles to entice hikers. Bethel is a pretty town of 2500 inhabitants with all the amenities a hiker could desire.  I eat a great salmon noodle fusion lunch bowl and enjoy a glass of wine. In the evening, I meet Māori for wings/pizza and beers in Suds Tavern.  Almost a holiday!!","Informal Tent Site

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657735,"I get a lift back to trail at 6.30 am from Kevin, the motel owner. Māori joins us.  He slept by the river last night after the beers, wings and pizza we shared at Suds pub.  
Kevin tells great but rambling stories without beginning, middle or end.  I’m happy listening to his strong Boston accent and noticing the leaves  beginning to turn a startling shade of red on a few trees. In a few weeks Maine will be in full autumn glory. 
I am slack packing today, as Kevin is picking me up at the next road crossing, just over 10 miles away.  I begin the big climb of the day up the Baldpate mountains, with a spring in my step from a lack of 30lbs on my back! 
For the first mile, I feel I am floating up the hill, but as the grade steepens on this long 4 mile ascent I start to feel the usual tightening in my leg muscles.  These mountains are large lumps of granite and that’s the surface I climb for most of early morning. About half a mile from the peak, I burst through the tree line and  scramble up to the summit, just about about to walk most of the time, but scrambling on all fours when the need arises. 
The view at the summit is simply stunning. A panorama of mountain peaks with cotton wool clouds masking valleys. I am so far above the clouds it’s hard to take in. A view I’d expect from a plane, not whilst hiking!  The hiking is often so hard it’s difficult to focus on the beauty around me, but today in the sunshine and no pack on my back I appreciate my good fortune. I sit and eat an apple and take it all in. 
On the third summit on the ridge, Little Bald, I call the motel. It’s 11am and I judge I’ll need a pick up at 1pm with 6 miles to go. And this will likely be the last mobile/cell reception. 
I soon regret this. The descent down wet granite is not much fun and slow going. Though I am glad of my new super grippy trail runners. After 1.5 miles and an hour, I take a short break at a shelter.  I then realise that there’s 700ft of climb in the next half a mile before I start the descent to the road.  
I put the after burners on and fly up the hill with no name ( the sneaky bastard!) and keep up a solid pace for an hour until I am back on schedule for my shuttle.  After the ‘hour of power’, I slow to my usual pace and enjoy the wildlife: red squirrels, woodpeckers and ever present chipmunks. 
I step out of the wilderness just as Kevin pulls up. It’s 1pm and the 10 miles has taken me 6 hours without a pack and with no long break. That would make this an 8, or more likely 9 hour walk with my pack.  Just another day in Southern Maine. So far I am loving it!!!","Bethel

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657776,"I go downstairs to pay my bill at the Bethel Village Motel at 6.20am. Kevin has the car ready with the trunk open to take me back to the trail. It’s a 30 minute drive, and as we pull up at the trail head, I see Maui about set off for the day. We chat and walk the first mile or so together. Then he waves me on up the first mountain of the day. Hiking up Wyman Mountain is relatively easy compared to everything else I’ve climbed in the last few weeks.  I amble up 5 miles of gently ascending trail to reach the summit at just under 3000ft.  Not that I notice the tree covered summit, as when I check my phone to be sure where it is, I realise I have walked past it! The trail undulates for a few miles, past a shelter where I eat my lunch and then a Brook where I collect more water.  Then downhill for long enough for me to get fed up with it.  At noon, I’m 1.4 miles from the top of Moody Mountain and 2.7 from the road where the hostel for tonight will pick me up. In the navigation app, Moody is described as a mile of straight up stairmaster at level 100.  Perhaps an exaggeration but it does make for a tough 30 minutes rock staircase followed by 30 minutes of sprawling upward switchbacks. I call the hostel for my shuttle and set off downhill.  It’s a kind dirt descent in keeping with most of this fairly easy day.   If not for my hostel booking, I could have hiked a lot longer today. The terrain is getting easier and hopefully that trend continues. I am picked up by 92 year old Honey, who owns the The Cabin hostel.  I pass on Truck’s love and good wishes and she tells me about how he and his wife stayed with her almost a whole summer. And that she still speaks with Truck on the phone every now and then. Honey and The Cabin have been AT institutions since 1998.","East B Hill Road

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657866,"The best thing about The Cabin is the family style dinner and breakfast with 92 year old Honey at the head of the table.  
Honey drives me to the trail head and chats about how she enjoys meeting hikers and about her recent hikes. For her 91st birthday, she hiked to Zealand hut in the White Mountains.  That’s 3 miles mostly uphill!  
The only down side of family style breakfast at 7 and lots of hikers, is that the shuttle at 8 does not leave until 8.30. It’s almost 9am when I get to the trail and I have a very long day ahead of me. 
There’s 26 miles between me and the next trail town of Rangeley. And heavy rain is due tomorrow afternoon.  So I plan 17 miles today and 9 tomorrow morning. 
The only thing wrong with my plan is that the first 17 miles are really hard!  The first 7 miles of the day are up Old Blue Mountain (3600ft) and then down and up 900ft to Bemis Mountain (3564ft).  It’s a slog, with few fleeting views and two summits that go by without me noticing until I check my map. Though there is a bench near Bemis summit, where I sit and have a snickers and drink water.  
I arrive at the Bemis Lean To shelter at 1.45pm and eat lunch of salami, cheese and bread until 2.15.  I have 8 miles to go, I’m tired, it’s slow going, I and don’t want to arrive at tonight’s shelter in the dark. 
The next 4 miles will take me to route 17.  It continues to be tough going, with the usual mix of rocks, roots and mud pools.  It’s downhill for the first 3 miles, not too sketchy but the soles of my feet and my toes are sore from the afternoon’s descent. 
The last mile up to the road is a classic Maine straight up the mountain clamber. I’m in no mood to slow down so I work as hard as I can and I am up to the road about 30 minutes ahead of my estimate.  I sit on a bench with a great view of Rangeley Lake and enjoy the moment.  
After the road, it’s a steady climb for a few miles before dropping  down rapidly to a few lakes; Moxie, then Long Pond and finally  Sabbath Day Pond. As I pass Long Pond, the sun is setting behind the far side of the pond. It’s beautiful but also so bright that it’s hard to see where I am walking. 
It’s 6.45pm when I get to the Sabbath Day Pond Shelter.  I collect water from the pond, make dinner and set up my sleep pad in the shelter as it is getting dark.  I sit in the shelter eating couscous, with red pepper and salmon from my pot, adding two sachets of mayonnaise for extra calories.","South Arm Road

But I can’t see them. I’ve been told the next 9 miles or so are easy. They may be easy for the AT in Maine but they are not easy.  Moderate constant pointless ups and downs (PUDs) would be a better description.  
I push myself to keep my pace up to 2mph which is a struggle for the first few miles uphill but gets progressively easier as the trail winds down to the road. It starts to rain at 11, but not too hard.  I get to the road about 11.15 and walk up to The Hiker Hut, a hostel that I hope to stay at tonight. Maui and Timber are already there. It is full but the owner kindly shuttles us all into town, where Timber and I get a room with two huge beds and a kitchen in the Town and Lake Motel.

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657942,"I take a zero day in Rangeley as it’s raining and the wind is 45-50 mph above tree line on Saddleback Mountain. 


I’ve been considering my plan for finishing this hike and thinking through a couple of options. 


It’s now clear to me that I won’t be coming back in the spring to complete the southern half of a thru hike in 12 months.  That is because the developers have told Fiona and I that we should be able to move into our new passivehaus in Leeds in March.   And I want to be home with Fi for that new and exciting adventure together.  


I am also unsure whether I will have time to hike every mile to Katahdin before my flight home in early October.  Nor whether I want to hike lots of very big mile days to make this deadline.  This few days of bad weather also remind me that even if I do hike long days, the weather may thwart my plans. 


It’s therefore a relatively easy decision for me to decide to jump up the trail about 90 miles to Monson, just before the 100 mile wilderness and Mt Katahdin. 


I am not going to achieve a thru hike but I am going to complete more than 1000 miles of hiking on the AT from Harpers Ferry to the trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin.  


Whether I come back next summer or another year to complete the southern section and perhaps fill in the 90 miles I am about to skip is an open question. I’ll see where life takes Fi and I next. 


I arrange for a shuttle to pick me up at 6am tomorrow morning to take me to Shaw’s Hostel in Monson.  There I will buy supplies for the 100 mile wilderness and arrange a food drop at the half way mark to save me carrying to much weight in food.  


It’s good to have the peace of mind of having a plan for finishing this hike and getting home.  I enjoy a nice lunch and a few beers and watch movies in my motel room. Bliss!","Route 4, Rangeley

Ernie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658089,"Yesterday, I caught a shuttle ride to Monson, the last town before the 100 mile wilderness.  I stayed at Shaw’s Hostel, an AT institution.  I spent most of the day planning how to get through the 100 mile wilderness, buying supplies, and arranging for Shaw’s to drop me some food at the half way point. 


I got up at 6am today, had a shower and ate a big breakfast at 7.  Poet drives a bus full of hikers to the trailhead at 8.40. He takes a group picture and reads a poem and I’m finally off up the trail! 

There’s lots of roots as the trail undulates but it’s fairly easy going and I cover the first 5 miles in 2 hours.

The trail gets a bit trickier with some steeper climbs and the slate rock running perpendicular to the trail is grippy on the dry but also means the trail is uneven.
The second five miles of the day takes me 3 hours. As does the last 5 miles of the day as my legs tire.  15 miles in 8 hours including a couple of short breaks is fine, and much more like my pace before I hit the Whites and southern Maine. 


The lower elevation means more variety of plants and trees. A mixed forest of older established trees with the ubiquitous pine.  Not sure if it applied here, but some areas of Maine had trees preserved by law during the colonial period as they were a good source of masts for the British navy. 


There are also some beautiful rivers, which are bigger than I have encountered before and trickier to cross.
I rock hopped two larger rivers today, and for one I took off my shoes and socks and crossed in my crocs.  Not just camp shoes! 


I got to Long Pond Lean To (shelter) a few minutes before 5. Hung my bear line, and made dinner of ramen noodles with two packets of chicken added for protein.

I hit the trail at 7 and it’s straight uphill to Barren Mountain (2670ft) and onto the ridge, where I’ll be going over three more mountain summits before descending to tonight’s campsite by the Pleasant River.  I am not making this up: the barren mountain is called Barren Mountain and the pleasant river is called Pleasant River.  This is Maine and folks like plain speaking!


None of the mountains are that big but all together they provide over 4800ft of ascent and a bit more descent that that for me today.  It’s a roller coaster of a 15 mile day. 


I am in a good mood: the sun is shining; my socks are dry; and Fulham beat Nottingham Forest last night.  Life doesn’t get much better than this! 


To add to these joys, the forest is beautiful and is perhaps the most sensational section of the AT that I have hiked.  I feel like Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings, wandering though the forest of the Ents.  The forest floor is carpeted in thick green and sometimes silver moss and lichen, giving these ancient woods a magical air. 


It’s a long and tiring day but perhaps one of the best of my adventure. At the last wide river before camp, I ford it in my crocs. There’s a little gang of happy hikers putting their shoes and socks back on when I cross. And it’s lovely to chat for half a mile or so before I turn off my campsite.I’ve decided to end my hike on a high at the end of this fabulous wilderness.  If I return to complete the AT I have Georgia to Harpers Ferry, and the section in Maine I skipped to do.  So as I will need to come back to Maine it feels right to leave the famous ending and that photo at the summit until the very end of my adventure.","Long Pond Lean To

I make coffee inside my tent and eat my breakfast honeybun.  I manage to pack my rucksack inside my tent, though this is a slow process.   This leaves just my tent to pack. 


As I step our of my tent, Sod’s law dictates that the rain gets much heavier.  My tent gets soaked and I roll it up with puddles of water on it. It won’t fit in its sack, so I stow it wet on top of my pack.  I have two rubbish sacks in the pack to keep my clothes and bedding dry and additional dry bags for my sleeping bag and clothes. 


I start hiking in a t shirt and shorts and my waterproofs. It’s miserable  weather but the trail is forgiving and I gamble on being able to make 12.5 miles and 4000 ft elevation to get over the last mountains in the 100 mile wilderness.  


It’s 7.45 when I leave and I make good time climbing the 1000ft to the Carl Newhall Lean To, and make the 4 miles or so by 10.20.  It’s cold and I am already soaked through. I take off my wet t shirt and put on a long sleeved hoodie.  I dry the inside f my rain jacket with my towel and set off again. 


The climb up Gulf Hagas (2683 ft) Mountain and then West Peak (3181ft) warms me up.  They are kind ascents with summits in trees so there’s no view but more importantly no wind chill. 


I continue up Hay Mountain (3244ft) , where the rain stops and gives me a window to get up White Cap Mountain (3644 ft) and over it’s exposed summit in the dry. 


At the summit, I text Shaw’s hostel to confirm I am on schedule for my food drop tomorrow at noon.  And let Fiona know I am OK.  I get down the 1.4 miles to the Logan Brook Lean To at pace. I am first there and get my sleeping pad and bag set up in the corner. It’s only a 6 person shelter and within an hour or so it is full. 


Other hikers arrive in yet more rain and have to look for tent spots. Everyone has soaking tents from last night so sleeping in a tent tonight will not be pleasant.

Thankfully it is not raining this am and another hiker says forecast is for heavy rain after 3pm but dry before that. I pack away my tent which I hung to dry out. It’s much drier than it was but still wet.  I eat instant porridge and drink coffee, and set off a little after 7am.

I have a bad headache which may just be stress and tiredness, or it may be linked to my sore throat and sneezing.  I took two sets of paracetamol over night but it’s not shifting. 


I eat a honeybun but I don’t have the energy to make coffee.  I think through my options. My plan is to walk 16 miles to a shelter today and there is a another shelter about half way, where I might warm up. But the rain, wind and low temperatures forecast today and tomorrow make that feel a miserable  option, particularly as I have few dry clothes left. 
It would leave me another 20 wet miles tomorrow to get to the end of the 100 mile wilderness. 


There is phone/cell reception at the campsite and I search for escape options. I find that there is a chance I could get picked up at a logging road - the Jo Mary - that I passed yesterday about 4 miles back. 


I text Shaw’s hiker hostel in Monson and the 100 mile wilderness inn in Millinocket.  Both offer me a shuttle pick up but only the inn has a bed for me. And they offer an earlier pick up time of 11.30.  There are also better connections to Boston from Millinocket so it’s an easy choice to make. 


I pack my backpack in the tent and then emerge into heavy rain to pack my tent.  I’m soaked through before I’m ready to leave camp.  But I am happy now that I have a good plan and start to tramp the 4 miles or so back to Jo Mary Road with a grim smile on my face as I recollect the many memories of hours and days on the trail that truly sucked, trying to rank these.  


I decide the number one worst day on the AT was when I hiked 21 miles in wind, incessant heavy rain and low temperatures with Gazelle in Pennsylvania, where we both were close to hypothermia for the last 5 miles before we made the shelter.  I fell 4 times that day in the mud, with one face first fall resulting in an injury to my thigh from a tree stump that slowed me down for weeks after.  I also walked the wrong way for almost a mile before bumping into Gazelle who thankfully was hiking in the right direction behind me.  Now, this feels like a good story and a happy memory of survival. Time is a great healer. 


I get to the road and Birthday Girl is there waiting for a shuttle from Shaw’s.   She is cold and wet and balled up inside her poncho when I arrive. We chat and laugh about the atrocious weather. 


Both our shuttles arrive at the same time and there is some unfriendly conversation between the two drivers about a cracked windscreen which my driver alleges was caused by dangerously fast driving by his counterpart.  Lloyd, my driver is friendly and chatty but also clearly upset by the incident. 


I get to the hostel and I know that this chapter of my Appalachian adventure is over.  I have no intention of hiking mount Katahdin until I’ve competed the rest of the trail. And the last 30 miles or so of the 100 mile wilderness will have to wait until that final trip. After more than 1000 miles on the trail, I am much more excited about spending a few days in Boston that trudging back out in the rain.  And going home feels exciting. I’ve struggled with homesicknesses many times and spoken to Fi almost every day.  


An old hiking friend, Nighthawk, is at the hostel and we hit Millinocket for a few beers and pizza.  It’s a great way to decompress and to end this adventure.  


In the morning, I stand on the scales in the hostel. If they are right, I have lost 35lbs.  I am the skinniest I have been since my 20’s in my soccer playing days.  I feel mentally and physically healthy and happy. The trail has been hard about also very good for me.  I am tougher than I thought I was in many respects. And also not as tough as I thought I was in others! And I’ve  pushed myself as hard as I’ve been able and I’m proud of my 1000 AT miles, including the White Mountains and Southern Maine to Saddleback. 


If I return, I have a 1000 miles of Georgia to Harpers Ferry, the 90 miles I skipped in Maine around the Bigelows, and the last 35 miles of the 100 mile wilderness and Katahdin to hike to complete the AT.   


Will I be back?  I don’t know. It’s too early to say.  Let’s see where life leads Fi and I….","Antlers Campsite
