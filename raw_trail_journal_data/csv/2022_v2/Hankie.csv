I was hoping for closer to 5.  I have taken out the heavier items, 2 packs of tuna, a bag of sunflower seeds and the peanut butter and jelly for my lunch.  I will buy the powdered peanut butter, and will carry a 1/2 cup of jelly in a zip lock to use sparingly on my sandwiches.  Also took out the jar of coffee and will carry a small zip lock of it.  Now I’m down to 7.1 pounds, not great, but manageable.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Fri",0

The duct tape held for about 5 miles, close to a shelter, so we (I’m hiking with a guy I met in Harper’s Ferry - Halfway) stopped there and I had a spare clip, so I was able to fix it at the shelter.  The rain was constant all day, the trail a mere creek full of mud, leaves and slippery rocks.  The closer we got to the shelter the harder it rained and the cooler it got.   I was so glad to get out of my wet clothes and drink a warm cup of tea.  There were 5 others at the shelter, all looking at the next day’s weather we decided to head to a town in the morning and get rooms to dry out and wait out the weather.","Dahlgren Campground

The sun was out and we were on the trail about 8:30.  The trail was still pretty wet and Halfway and I had to cross a stream that was flowing very fast.  He got across pretty easily, he’s well over 6 ft tall.  I got one foot on a rock and one on a log and I could not go forward or back easily. The water was raging under me.  My leg started shaking… I asked Halfway if he could take my pack and phone, so if I went in I would not get all my gear wet and it would be easier for me to try and jump.  He got my stuff and then from a rock on his side reached out and took my hand.  On three he pulled, I pushed and I got one foot on the rock I was aiming for. The other foot went on, but one wet shoe was a happy price for me to pay.  I thanked God and we pushed on.  We took a side trail to a place called High Rocks (in Maryland), it is full of graffiti, but I thought it looked very nice.  My energy was fading fast, but we managed to cross the Mason-Dixon Line and celebrated completing our first state.","Days Inn Waynesboro

I determined that once I was in town with electricity and service I would straighten things out and try to be more organized going forward.  The main excitement of the day was to have a pack that felt great on my back, even with a full bag of food!  I also completed my first 100 miles, another exciting note.  Everything in PA is so lush and green, there were some beautiful orchids along the way, and we also saw a pea hen.","Lisa’s Hostel

I was looking forward to some time to journal and relax.  I took my first hard fall on some rocks and banged up my knee.  Technically, it’s my second fall, but the first one was more of a gentle tumble into soft dirt.  I got up and really felt ok.  We were hiking on a ridge and there was a steep down into town.  As we descended I started feeling a twinge in my right foot.  We got to the hostel and as soon as I pulled my shoes off I could not stand comfortably on my foot!  I was very concerned, to say the least.  I iced it, took meds and elevated it.  I do remember when I played soccer and got hurt I would gimp around the first day but recover quickly.  I did not want to make any plans until morning.","Darlington Springs Shelter

I was so excited!  We walked about 10 yards down the trail and there was another crossing, no log this time and  Halfway shook his head, “we have to go back”! I was trapped and had to cross the log again.  On the way over my foot slipped, and by the grace of God I was able to catch myself.","Rausch Gap Shelter

She graciously offered to help me at no charge.  My new friend, Kia, let me shower, wash clothes, fill my water bags and charge my phone at her place.

I managed to grab a tree as I went down, so it was a soft, controlled fall, but that makes 3 for the trip now.  Today my total hike mileage is over 200.  I am not going as fast as I hoped, but I am still giving my feet some recovery time.","Port Clinton Pavilon

Thru hikers call it Rocksylania, it covers about 150 miles of the trail in PA and it is considered the least favorite part of the AT.    The rocks were large and small, mostly jagged, some loose some set in place and many covered in leaves.  God willing, we will be out of PA by weeks end.","Lookout Hostel

For those that wonder about how I calculate my mileage, this is how they do it on a long trail like the AT.  The trail mileage starts at Springer Mtn in GA with mile 0 and it ends at Katahdin Peak at mile 2194.3. The app I use gives the official mileage of every stop in between. The app also shows stops not directly on the path to Katahdin, but mileage for anything off the main trail is not counted.  So, trips into town, to resupply or get dinner don’t count.  If the shelter is not right on the trail, that mileage including walking to get water or go to the privy or to overlooks off the trail don’t count. If you have to back-track or get lost, you don’t count it.  So, all of use the official miles and only count AT trail miles between out start and stop point.  It seems a bit unfair at times, but does simplify keeping track.","Secret Shelter

I think I have covered in the journal that I use the FarOut app for navigating the trail.  It is great, it has all the info a hiker needs. There are entries for all the stuff along the trail, like shelters, water, towns, views, etc.  A really helpful feature is hikers can add comments on any item as info to other hikers, like water source is dry, shelter privy is close to full, stealth camping by the brook.  At my last hostile, a SoBo (south bound) hiker was telling me about a bird that attacked him.  He said there was a warning notice on trail to raise your poles over your head if you hear or see a bird dive bombing you.  He actually got the bird screeching briefly on his video before he had to “assume the position”.  He said it was very cool.  The sound was very scary, I’m glad I got to hear it and know it.  So, I saw in the comments for Frye Notch shelter that a goshawk had attacked a few hikers.  
I stayed there, but no attack.  It turns out there are 2 more places along the trail with reported sightings, I hope I get to see one - and have enough sense to get my poles up and catch it on video!  So, call me crazy, it may be true, but I want to see one in action!","South Arm Rd
