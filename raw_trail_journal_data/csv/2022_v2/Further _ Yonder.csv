Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652872,"And 8 months later we are back (though in our minds we never left)! Off to a late start so we had to change our plans last minute and skip the the first day off hiking. Using Guthook or ""FarOut"" as it is now called we located a tent site close to a trailhead at Millbrook Rd in NJ which was less than a half mile hike. We drove two cars since we are now full on section hikers and this will allow us to go point to point, car to car. So we left both cars parked at the trailhead and used them as giant bear boxes by leaving all of our food in them for the night. We've heard that there are lots of bears in the area and remember running into them when we were hiking in NJ in 2020 so this gave us a little piece of mind, at least for tonight. As we laid down in the tent for the night we were both feeling happy to finally be back on trail.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652873,"This morning we hiked the short distance back to where our cars were parked, left one where it was and drove the second one down to Delaware Water Gap where we had finished up our PA section hike back in 2020. Being that it was Memorial Day weekend it was a bit of a zoo at DWG so we had to park a bit further away from our intended starting point and then had to weave in and out of the throngs of day hikers to start the day. The crowds quickly thinned out and we soon made it to The Mohican Outdoor Center for an excellent lunch. Within the first hour of hiking we already encountered a bear who watched us go by as he went about his business. We finished up the day right back at the same tenting area that we had stayed at last night which allowed us to once again take advantage of the giant bear box on wheels otherwise known as my car.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652874,"After another round of shuffling our cars around we were back on our way for a hot day of hiking with temps in the upper 80's. Two things became apparent today ... 1 - We were carrying too much stuff and 2 - We had completely lost our trail legs. We only did 11 miles today and yet we were both exhausted by 4pm so we cut the day short.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652876,"Another hot day but we were able to get going early enough to cover some good miles while it was still on the cooler side. We had the time and enough food to stay on trail another night but we kept deciding to go just a little further until eventually we were at High Point where we had left our car. At this point it was so hot and gross out we were ready to be done no longer the trail hardened hikers that we were a year ago. Needing a place to stay, and already having a car parked nearby, we once again stayed at the tent site near Millbrook Rd for our final night of this section hike. We have now filled in another missing piece that we had skipped and NJ can finally be checked off as completed. Another 150 plus miles to go (mostly in Maine) and then we'll need to find another trail to obsess over.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653428,"Yonder got an unexpected 3 day weekend because of the new Juneteenth holiday so naturally we decided to go for a short section hike. The original plan was to head up to Maine and continue north from Grafton Notch but the weather predictions made us give up this plan at the last minute. That and the fact that we were too busy to prepare during the week and feeling worn out by Friday night the idea of getting up early to drive 5 hours just to get to where we left off did not excite us very much. So late on Friday night we came to our senses and decided instead to finally get to the last 16 mile ""section"" that we never completed in NH. We had been saving this one because we knew we could do it in a weekend or maybe even in a day if we slackpacked. 
Yesterday we spent the day recovering from the work week and prepping for the hike. Last time out it was incredibly hot and we had carried too much, this time though we had to search around to find our winter gear based on the predictions shown on the atweather.org site. And it was a good thing we did take the time to think it through and pack properly because it was cold tonight on top of Smarts Mt where we tented actually dipping down into the 20's. 
The actual hiking today was great. Because of the cool temps and the slight breeze (not so slight at times), the bugs were non-existent. Perfect conditions really.
We finished up the day by climbing up the old fire tower on top of Smarts to enjoy the sunset. What a great day.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653429,"After a cold night today was much warmer but we still got to enjoy some cool hiking temps in the morning as we descended down Smarts to where we had a second car planted at the trailhead 3.5 miles down at the next road crossing. Once arriving at the car we dropped our packs and slackpacked the final 2 miles in opposite directions - Yonder drove the car to the far end and hiked nobo passing off the key when we met near the middle and then I drove pack to pick her up and then back to 25A where the other car was parked. Section hiking can be a real pain in the ass but it can also provide so much freedom and flexibility.
In total this outing only lasted about 24 hours but it somehow seemed pretty epic. What a contrast to a couple of weeks ago down at Delaware Water Gap where it was more about just getting the miles finished so that we could finally check off NJ. With this last little bit finished in NH we have finally filled in all the missing gaps except for one continuous section in Maine from Grafton Notch to Monson. I cannot wait to get up there but it's going to be hard since it is so far away and we do not have many open days left over the summer. 
Hopefully the next entry in this journal will be from a mountain top in Maine. Until then, happy trails y'all.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656441,"We had a rare open weekend so we decided to squeeze in a quick adventure to fill in more of the miles we have left. It is a little ridiculous but we were desperate to get back on trail so we drove 2 cars more than 4 hours to get to where we left off in Maine even though we would be driving back the following day. We left one car at a road crossing about 10 trail miles from Grafton Notch where we parked the other car and started hiking from. Because of a delayed start due to last minute packing and traffic on the way up we didn’t get on trail until after 6pm. This allowed us just enough time to hike up the lower part of Bald Pate mountain to reach the shelter just after sunset. The hike was uphill the entire way but it felt great to be back on trail especially after sitting in the car for so long today. Once we got settled into our tent for the night we were both feeling very grateful to be back out on the AT and especially in the great state of Maine.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656443,"We managed to get packed up and on trail by 6:45am which for us is really good. This was made easier by not having breakfast at our campsite but instead waiting until we reached the first summit of the day about a mile up trail before cooking up our traditional trail breakfast of coffee, oatmeal and poptarts. The oatmeal and poptarts were old and leftover from last year’s thru hike but Yonder put her foot down when I wanted to pack some crappy instant coffee packets that we also had leftover and insisted instead that we bring newly purchased packets of Starbucks Via. We choked down the stale poptarts and oatmeal but thoroughly enjoyed our delicious coffee as we soaked in the 360 degree views of northern Maine.
It was a beautiful day which we appreciated all the more after having recently suffered through several days of a heatwave back home. The views were amazing as we summited over Baldpate West and East peaks. We were then reminded how hard the hiking can be in Maine as we continued hiking the rest of the day either straight up or straight down though there were thankfully several ladders in place for some of the trickier spots. By the time we had reached East B Hill road where we had planted our second car we were both pretty wiped out and Yonder was experiencing a flare up of a recent foot injury that she had thought she was just about over with. We had hopes of staying out another night and flip flopping our cars up to the next trail head another 10 miles up trail but it was obvious to us both that this wouldn’t be wise. We were also disappointed in ourselves for taking over 8 hours to hike only 8 miles but then we remembered that these were “Maine miles” which are twice as hard as “regular” miles so really we did 16 miles today (or at least that’s what our bodies told us).

Despite the wimpy number of miles and the re-aggravating of Yonder’s injury it was great being back out there and we both really loved this part of the trail. Because of other commitments this might very well be the last AT hike we get to do in 2022 but we look forward to getting back up to Maine pickup where we left off. This trail never seems to end for us which I guess is kind of a good thing because it always leaves us something to look forward to but, on the other hand, it also seems to be getting harder every year and we somehow managed to save some of the hardest miles of the trail for last! After today we now have just 139 miles to go which we could do in about 10 days if we did it all at once but which might very well take us another 3 years if we limit ourselves to these types of short weekend adventures.
