The signs and sounds of spring are starting to show and I am anxious to get AT Section Hike 8 underway. Although I have taken many day hikes over the winter I have not spent a night in my tent since the end of Section Hike 7 last October. I plan to pick up from where I left off on Section Hike 7, VA 56, and continue southbound towards Daleville. “Priest Wilderness” here I come!More to come…

My wonderful wife and I had a nice three hour drive to the VA 56 AT trailhead this morning. We each grabbed a sandwich on the way and indulged at the trailhead parking lot just before I hit the trail southbound at 11:30. I planned a short day today because I knew that I would be entering the north end of the Priest Wilderness area and that the very first four miles of this section hike would be a 3,200’ climb to the top of the “Priest”. The climb was long but not incredibly hard but my legs were getting pretty tired until I reached the top.



The weather was really nice when I headed up the mountain but it turned much colder and windier as I gained elevation. A northbound day hiker told me that there is severe weather headed our way later today and tomorrow. I plan to just hunker down in the shelter and see what happens. What happened to spring? My hands are getting cold as I type.A big thank you to my beautiful wife for sacrificing her time, again! I love you baby!!

The Priest Shelter to Cow Camp Gap ShelterThe wind howled all night long last night and was still howling at 7:30 when I hit the trail this morning. Fortunately the rain had not started yet. That changed before noon and it came with a vengeance. Most of today’s hike was at a higher elevation and I got blasted relentlessly by driving rain that actually stung my face. I plugged along and eventually made it to Cow Camp Gap Shelter which is at a lower elevation so the wind is not nearly as bad and the rain has finally stopped. A smarter hiker probably would have sat it out at the Priest Shelter today but I was determined to get some miles in. Now that I look back at it I’m happy with my decision to hike today. It was certainly a day I will never forget. I’m just glad that it wasn’t colder! Hopefully tomorrow’s weather will be a bit kinder.Onward We Go,

Cow Camp Gap Shelter to Punchbowl Shelter 


I hit the trail at 7:20 this morning. The weather was much more favorable today with only a short shower or two. If only the wind would have stopped blowing. After a relatively small 600’ climb right from the shelter I had a long 3,000’ descent down from Bald Knob. The hike along Brown Mountain Creek was absolutely beautiful.

Punchbowl Shelter to US 501 Trailhead, Glasgow, VA



The skies cleared and the winds finally subsided during the night last night but colder temperatures came along with it. I’m not sure what the temperature was but I do know that it was below freezing because when I hit the trail at 6:30 the frozen ground was crunching under my feet. My 20 degree sleeping bag kept me pretty cozy although I did sleep with my hiking clothes on for additional warmth.
The trail is getting steadily busier as the faster/earlier starting northbound thru-hikers are already this far north of Springer. I love chatting with those folks and hearing of their experiences. Two of the five other hikers that stayed at the shelter were sleeping in hammocks and neither one of them had under quilts for colder weather. As I was leaving the shelter this morning I asked them how they made out and they admitted that they both had a pretty miserable night.
I finally had some nice views today, especially from the summit of Bluff Mountain. Today was a great day and also the day that section hike 8 came to and end. My wonderful wife picked me up at the trailhead parking lot at US 501. We stopped in Glasgow at a restaurant called Scotto’s Pizza and I chowed down on an amazing Cowboy Burger while my wife had a Cheesesteak Sub. Both were absolutely delicious. A few days on the trail causes you to really appreciate town food.

First of all let me introduce you to Brooks Alan Tolbert, my precious grandson, who was born on June 14th of this year! He is my wife and I’s first grandchild and is a bundle of joy. I cannot wait until he is old enough to join his pappy on a walk in the mountains! Oh my gosh, I’m a grandfather!


As luck would have it the ATC has recently highly encouraged AT hikers to postpone their hikes in the southern portion of the AT, including Virginia, due to hurricane Ian just as I was preparing to head out there. I have decided not to be deterred and will be starting from where I left off on Section Hike 8 (US 501 Glasgow, VA) on October 3rd, continuing southbound towards Daleville. The worst of Ian is forecast to be over by then with some lingering light winds and light rain. What’s the worst that can happen :)

US 501 Glasgow, VA to Thunder Hill Shelter 


My wife and I drove to Daleville, VA last night and spent the night there at the Super 8. I left a food resupply box there at the front desk to resupply from when I reach Daleville on day 4. This morning we drove north to the US 501 trail parking lot and I began my SOBO  Section Hike 9 at the north end of the James River footbridge. Thank you to my beautiful wife for all that you do for me!




Thank goodness hurricane Ian petered out just in time for me to get started. It was a beautiful cool autumn day today and except for the 5,000’ of elevation gain that slowed me down a bit it was a perfect day. I might have pushed it a little hard for the first day but hopefully my legs will feel revived in the morning.
Thunder Ridge Overlook was by far the best view of the day overlooking the mountains and valley to the west. I did not see any other hikers today. I felt like I was the only one out here but several folks have shown up at the shelter since I got here. It’s supposed to get down to 40 degrees tonight but I have faith that my 20 degree sleeping bag will keep me toasty.Onward We Go,

Thunder Hill Shelter to Cove Mountain ShelterAt almost 4,000’ Thunder Hill Shelter was quite chilly last night. It had to of been in the 30’s. I still slept pretty well except for the critter that was chewing on something all night. I should know better by now than to sleep in the shelters. I ignored it because it sounded like it was chewing on wood and not my stuff. 



I have been running in to quite a few other hikers. Most of them have been SOBO thru-hikers. 6 of them stayed at the Thunder Hill Shelter last night. They’re really interesting people to talk to.Kind of a funny story - One of the other hikers that stayed at the Thunder Hill Shelter last night was a section hiker like me and he felt that we just had to have a fire in the fire pit. Keep in mind that it had just recently rained for several days and everything was very damp. He spent what must have been an hour trying to scavenge small kindling that was sort of but not really dry. I have to give him some credit for his perseverance because after half and hour of trying and 4 blank pages out of the journal book he succeeded in getting it going. Sad thing is that by the time he got it going everyone was ready to crawl in their sleeping bags. I thought that it was a silly idea right from the beginning.

Cove Mountain Shelter to Wilson Creek Shelter 


Last night was a splendid night at Cove Mountain Shelter for several reasons. First and most importantly I slept like a baby. No chewing critters or snoring humans within ear shot. Sleeping in my tent really has it’s advantages. I also had good cell service to talk to my bride , just as important if not more so, and post my journal. And it was noticeably warmer than the night before. 


I spent a large chunk of the day today paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway. I’m not a big fan of having roads nearby because I prefer a more remote vibe but it did provide a boat load of fantastic views. Yeah, you could get the same views in a car but working for it adds another level of appreciation. At least for me. 


I had originally planned to continue to Fullhardt Knob Shelter today which was another 6 miles but I decided to cut it short. From Fullhardt to Daleville is only 5 miles so rather than doing a big 19  today I figured I’d tack those 6 onto tomorrow for a total of 11. My wonderful wife is going to pick me up in Daleville tomorrow and head home. I had hoped to do more than 4 days on the trail but there are several events happening at home this weekend that I just do not want to miss. 


Oh, remember the silly guy that insisted on building a fire with damp wood on night 1? Guess who has a nice fire burning this afternoon. Good dry and plentiful wood and 5 seconds to light. I feel a little guilty. And as of now, 5 o’clock in the afternoon, I have the place all to myself. And great cell service to boot. Life is good!

Wilson Creek Shelter to US Route 220, Daleville


So I ended up not having Wilson Creek Shelter to myself last night after all. Around 8 o’clock after I had already crawled into my tent two guys came walking in using their headlamps. Never did find out who they were because I left the shelter this morning before they got up. Hopefully they enjoyed the nice fire I left for them. 



There weren’t many views today but it was gorgeous in the woods with the trees starting to turn to their fall colors. Coming down out of the mountains to Daleville made for a very easy day with most of it being downhill. Most of the trail was smooth with plenty of switchbacks so I just coasted along and left gravity do most of the work.
I’m not certain as to when and where Section Hike 10 will occur but you can bet that there will be one. Yeah, hiking miles and miles over mountains over a period of several days might not be everyone’s idea of a good time but it suits me perfectly. I’m always up for a good challenge and I love being in the mountains. Need I say more!


A whopping big thank you to my beautiful wife for helping me make these outings happen and also to my lovely mother for joining her on the trip down to pick me up today. It was a pleasant surprise to see you there. 


My wife and I will be taking care of our precious little grandson Brooks for the next three days while his mom and dad are away so that might give you a hint as to why I did not stay on the trail a few more days. I do love the mountains but I love little Brooks much more!!
