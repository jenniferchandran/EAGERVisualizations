High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653370,"Okay, so the first leg of the bus trip ended a bit prematurely.  In Pittsburgh, not Harrisburg.  Apparently, the scheduled stop in Pittsburgh was the end of that driver's shift -- and there was no other driver available to take the bus further east.  Hmmm. Not an entirely successful first day.  But you don't bet the farm on these buses.  And one thing I know for certain -- sooner or later there will be another bus coming along.  Actually, I think that should be Greyhound's slogan.",,View Entry,"Jun 21, Tue",0
High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653452,"Okay, I made to Delaware Water Gap.  Successive buses did eventually arrive, and they transported me from Ohio to the trail.  I could leave it at that.  But . . . bus travelers get such an unfairly bad rap in our culture.  Frankly, I don't know how they do it -- it's pure agony to me, riding these buses and being treated so poorly by those whose services you are paying good money for.  I'm appalled by the bullying that goes on.  It stinks.  
But -- when I arrived in Delaware Water Gap, my fortunes immediately turned.  I mean, immediately!  I had taken maybe twenty-five steps from the bus stop down the road toward town -- and the very first vehicle that passed me pulled over to wait for me.  Really??  Trail magic already??  Can this be true??   
I wasn't hitching, my thumb wasn't out -- the road walk was only going to be a mile long.  Nonetheless . . . ""Wanna ride?"" the driver cheerfully asked.  Aaaahhhh.  What a startling and dramatic difference from the treatment bus travelers have to endure.  People sometimes ask me why I hike.  You wanna know why I hike -- this is why.  Because people in the long distance hiking community treat other people so incredibly well.
So, the name of this Godsend is Marty, and he's the owner of Marty's Old Yellow House, a hostel here in Delaware Water Gap.  He's my newest hero.  You really made my day, Marty.  It was great, meeting you.",,View Entry,"Jun 22, Wed",0
High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653494,"Heavy rain this morning in Delaware Water Gap so I didn't leave town until 11:00am.  Got rained on lightly until 2:00pm, then everything dried out including me.  I was chugging on the uphills, so the rain felt great.
Not many hikers out today but I saw lots of wildlife.  Best part was a big family of turkeys -- mom, pop and too many babies to count accurately as they scurried away while I fumbled for my phone.  I didn't get a pic -- they moved off trail too fast for me and I wasn't about to follow them.  They deserve an unmolested life.  They sure were an awesome bunch!
I'm camped at a beautiful stealth site on Kittatinny Ridge, overlooking a small community.  The ridge isn't too high, so occasionally I can hear town noises such as a car driving along the road or a dog barking.  And I suspect ""Kittatinny"" is probably a Native American word meaning ""directly beneath flight pattern"".  Despite the reminders of nearby civilization, it's peaceful up here.  I like it very much.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653558,"Boy, it sure gets light outside early here!  The daylight woke me up at 5:00am and I was walking by 6:00am.  It was a perfect morning for a walk -- cool with a modest breeze.
By noon I had covered 11 miles.  A tavern in Branchville, NJ is reputed to serve great cheeseburgers.  One was beckoning me like a siren.  I couldn't force the thought of it from my head.
The problem was, Branchville was another 5.8 miles away.  And I had promised myself that I would keep my daily mileage below 15 for the first week of this hike.
So, here I am at Brink Road Shelter, no cheeseburger for me.  And, naturally, when I pass by the tavern tomorrow it will be too early in the morning and the tavern will be closed.  Sigh.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653611,"The temperature first thing this morning wasn't bad, just ominous.  I like cool mornings.  First thing I noticed about this morning -- it wasn't cool.  It wasn't hot, but you could tell it sure was gonna be later on.  Uh oh.
I had covered 10.2 miles by noon -- not bad -- but my pace slowed to a crawl soon after that.  In the mid-afternoon, I baked like a glazed ham.  The uphills were brutal.  They weren't big, but no matter.  They were brutal.  I took many, many breaks.  I moved like a slug.  I couldn't wait to lie down.
On a barely-related front, I decided I'm going to petition the New Jersey legislature to change the state's nickname from ""The Garden State"" to ""The Rock Garden State"".  In the name of truth in advertising, I feel it would be the right thing for them to do.  Don't misunderstand -- rock gardens are beautiful, and so is New Jersey.  I'm a big fan.  But this place is undeniably chock full of rocks.  Not all gardens are. Just rock gardens.  So there you have it.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653683,"Ahhh, what a day.  So much to say.  
I saw a black bear!  Then I saw two sets of whitetailed does with two spotted fawns each.  But the best critter sighting, by far, was Jake the donkey -- the host at the Secret Shelter.  Jake's a gem.  What an extraordinarily friendly creature.  You can't help but fall in love with him immediately.
After I stopped by the Secret Shelter to meet Jake and get some deliciously cold well water, I came across its caretaker, MTH, out on the trail.  He thru-hiked the AT in 2002 and is helping the owner of the Secret Shelter, Jim, keep his dream alive.  Jim thru-hiked the AT in 1989 and opened the Secret Shelter for hikers on his 80 acre farm in 1996.  It's been available for passing foot travelers, free of charge, for 26 years!  Now 84 and having some health issues, Jim is leaning on MTH for a bit of help in keeping the Secret Shelter going.
These men are flat-out awesome.  Hiking the AT impacted their lives in a meaningful way, and they are demonstratively paying it forward to others -- and in such a tremendously useful and genuine way.  Talk about gems!  Jim and MTH -- yours are the shoulders the rest of us stand on.  Well done, guys -- and thank you both!
If all that weren't enough, I'm spending the night tonight in the basement of the personal home of Pastor Doug and his wife Priscilla -- ""Bansai"" and ""Hot Drinks"" -- in Unionville, NY.  Their donation-based basement hostel is called Sola Appalachian Christian Retreat, and I love it here.  Pastor Doug also thru-hiked the AT, and, like Jim and MTH, is giving back to the trail community in a most wonderful way.  I can't say enough about Pastor Doug and Priscilla -- and their equally awesome kids, daughter Maple and son Birch.  I feel incredibly welcome here.  Thank you all, so much, for sharing your home with me. 
And, I got my cheeseburger!  At the Wit's End Tavern here in Unionville.  It was huge and delicious, and every bit worth the wait.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653721,"I left Sola and Unionville feeling well fed, well rested and well cared for.  It was a wonderful stop off the trail.  Unionville is not a tourist town at all.  It's a real town, with only mom and pop shops lining the main street and no corporate chains or franchises of any kind.  A man could get used to such a place.
I hiked in the on again, off again rain until it quit for good around 3:00pm.  Today was a good bit cooler than the last few days.  Aaahhh.  Even the rain was entirely pleasant.  The terrain was modest, even the over-named ""Stairway to Heaven"" up the steep side of Wawayanda Mountain wasn't as tough as you'd think from its name.
But the best part of the day, by far, was running into Sparkles -- a NOBO thru-hiker who stayed with Nancy (yep, that Nancy) and me at the Hike Inn when he passed through Fontana Dam many, many miles ago.  It was extraordinarily cool to see him again.  He's enjoying himself and doing great.  He made me pose for a selfie with him.  To me, that's the real magic of this trail.  And it's very real.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653769,"Today was tough!  Almost immediately after crossing into New York, some very physical rock scrambling began.  There were lots of places where my trekking poles were useless -- I needed to grab the rock face with both hands and either hoist myself up or (carefully!) lower myself down.  This kind of hiking is still a blast for me, but it's getting more difficult to do with each passing year.  One false step would have been disastrous! 
At one point today I crossed the highest point on the AT in New York -- Prospect Rock.  It's only 1433' above sea level, but much of the trail around here is considerably lower than that.  From Prospect Rock I could easily see the Manhattan skyline.  That was cool.  I wish my phone had a better camera.  I took a photo but the skyline is too fuzzy to make out.  Rats.
After yesterday's rain, today was a gorgeous day -- sunny all day with a nice breeze and a high of 76°.  It will get fiery hot again, but not until after a couple more really nice days.  I feel very fortunate about the weather I've had so far.  It's been eminently reasonable.
I'm in my tent enjoying the satisfying feeling of being physically tired after a good day's work.  I'll sleep well.  Goodnight you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653831,"Today was another tough day.  In the morning, sooooo many steep ups and downs.  By noon I had covered only 8.5 miles, despite my best efforts.  And I was already beat.
But then, Fred.  Fred saved the day.  Fred is a kind and generous man who lives near Harriman State Park in New York.  For years he was a trail maintainer, volunteering his time and energy to keep the AT and other trails around here open and hikeable.
Today, as I popped out of the woods and crossed the road to enter Harriman State Park, there was Fred.  He had just arrived and was setting up some trail magic out of the trunk of his car.  First thing he offered me was a cold Gatorade.  Man, was it good.  Aaahhh.  
Then he unfolded what is surely the world's most comfortable chair and I plopped into it and everything was suddenly sooooo much better.  And then, he offered me my choice of homemade brownies, banana bread or applesauce cake -- all made by Fred.  I chose a brownie.  It was Heavenly.
I sat for twenty minutes or so and chatted with Fred.  He's a very funny and interesting guy with a wealth of knowledge about the local area and its history.  He shared his knowledge as freely as his laughs and his home baked goods.
Fred is a wonderful man.  He sure made my day.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653886,"Not quite as much of a struggle today.  I was up and hiking early, before the heat got too bad.  By noon I had covered 9.5 miles, which feels decent given the tough New York terrain.  I might have been able to cover another mile or so if the blueberries along the way hadn't been so tasty!
I got a tremendous boost of energy at the Bear Mountain Inn's cafeteria, where I ate another delicious cheeseburger -- with bacon this time! -- and some truly wonderful fries.  That helped immensely with the very steep and hot climb immediately after crossing the Hudson River.
I'm camped tonight in right field of the ballpark at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, run by Franciscan Friars.  I'm calling it my Field of Dreams.  This place is outstanding!  They've been letting hikers camp here for free since 1970.  There's running water and electric, and even an outdoor shower stall.  My body and my clothes are rinsed off, my phone's fully charged, and it all feels just about perfect.  
When I was a kid my baseball hero was Al Kaline of the Detroit Tigers.  He played right field.  So perhaps tonight I'll dream of Al, effortlessly drifting back then leaping up to make a great catch at the wall, and then somehow making an even better throw to peg the runner on third out at home.  I wouldn't be at all surprised.

Today was a miserable day.  Temps over 90° and way high humidity to boot.  Boy, I'm beginning to question whether summertime backpacking is for me.  I melted like a chocolate chip in the midst of a cookie baking in the oven.  I felt terrible.  I hike for fun, not to prove to myself what a badass I am.  Today just was not fun.  Too hot.
I got a way early start and managed to get 11 miles done by noon.  At the 14.2 mile mark I stopped off for lunch at Canopus Lake Beach, where there's a very nice snack bar.  By then I felt awful and was at least half dead, but the living half had another . . . um . . . delicious bacon cheeseburger with fries!  You would think that would help, and I had plans to hike on, but I was too far gone.  So after lunch I managed another whopping 0.2 miles then collapsed at the Canopus Lake Beach Shelter.
On the plus side, this new shelter was a fairly brilliant move!  Built in 2021, it has no water source or privy but it's a mere 0.2 miles from the sparkling clean facilities at Canopus Lake Beach.  Besides the snack bar there are restrooms, showers, electric outlets and, naturally, a beach.  It's an ingenious spot for a shelter.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654003,"The promised storm arrived in the middle of the night last night, and it was a doozie!!  Loud lightning and thunder -- much too close for comfort -- and torrential rain.  It kept me awake for several hours.
I got a late start today, but the temperature was considerably lower than yesterday so I made pretty good time.  By noon I had covered 10 miles.  I stopped off for lunch at a place called Corrado's Pizza, and man was it delicious!!  I sure wish I could eat like this all the time, and not just when I'm on a hike.
The afternoon was uneventful, except that another thunderstorm was brewing so I quickly picked a spot and set up my tent.  Sure enough, the skies opened soon thereafter.  This one was just a late afternoon pop-up, more of a nuisance than anything.  Lots of rain came down though, so I'm really hoping for cooler temperatures, less humidity and flowing water sources during the next few days.

Making it all the more enjoyable were the two meals I ate during the hike.  First up was a stop for lunch at a Malaysian food truck, parked right at a road crossing.  Yep, Malaysian food right on the AT!!  It's a Brave New World of backpacking, ain't it?  Then, courtesy of Magic Jack, I had a second lunch trail magic -- a grilled hot dog and a Pepsi -- immediately after entering Connecticut.  How delicious that dog was.  What a treat.  Thank you, Magic Jack!   
I'm camped at Ten Mile River Campsite, right at the confluence of the Ten Mile and Housatonic Rivers.  Nothing like rapids near your tent to ensure a great night's sleep.  So, I'm in New England now.  This is a fine place to be.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654158,"What a happy day of hiking!  It started off bright and early, as I had a plan to divert into Kent, CT for lunch.  Along the way I ran into Laughing Loon (no relation!) and Apollo, two NOBO thrus whom I have been seeing and talking with daily for a week or so.  They were heading into Kent also, and invited me to share an Uber with them.  
I was looking forward to my first ever Uber ride, alas, no Uber drivers were available.  But Laughing Loon is a magician of a hitchhiker!  The third car that passed -- driven by a really nice guy who just moved to Connecticut from the Punjab in India -- stopped and ferried us into town.
Kent is a drop dead gorgeous New England town.  It was all very festive being Independence Day, and many many tourists were out and about.  Most of the cars I saw had New York license plates, not Connecticut.
We ate at the Kent Pizza Garden.  I had yet another bacon cheeseburger -- this one was the biggest and best yet.  It was massive!  But, in addition to fries I also had a side salad.  That salad hit the spot!  After lunch I resupplied while Laughing Loon and Apollo went in search of ice cream.  We met back up and Laughing Loon again proceeded to immediately get us a ride, this time from a guy driving a 1970 pick-up truck modified into a beach buggy.  What fun!
All right, all right . . . I admit that the afternoon's walk -- with a very very full belly -- was anything but a stroll.  But a man's gotta eat!  And talking with Laughing Loon and Apollo over lunch has been one of the best parts of this hike.  They are so kind and genuine to everyone they encounter.  They are so disinterested in trying to impress folks with their hiking prowess and how difficult their hike has been.  They see themselves as ordinary folks attempting to do something extraordinary.  They are stellar hikers, and stellar people.  Godspeed, Laughing Loon and Apollo.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654165,"Well, no lunch diversion today!  The forecast said rain beginning at 3:00pm, so I picked a campsite that I figured I could reach by then and headed out.  This was more of a Grandma Gatewood day -- just buckle down and hike.  No cheeseburgers, no pizza, certainly no Malaysian food!  A few blueberries, of course . . .
It wasn't hot out, but it sure was humid.  Every time I took a break my sweat-soaked hiking clothes got chilly pretty quickly.  But I mostly just kept moving, and I arrived at 2:40pm.  I set up my tent, and sure enough the rain started promptly at 3:00pm.  It's just after 8:00pm now, and it's been raining on and off the whole time I've been here, with more of the same forecasted for overnight. 
I do think, quite possibly, that a quick diversion for breakfast might occur in the morning.  They're saying that the rain will stop before then.  And a man's gotta eat.  Been awhile since I had a real breakfast.  I do love a real breakfast.  I sure do.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654239,"I was at the Mountainside Cafe just outside Falls Village, CT when they opened their doors at 7:00am.  I was their first customer of the day.  I had a big glass of orange juice, lots of coffee, and a Johnny Cash Skillet.  Yep, in Connecticut, a Johnny Cash Skillet.  It was every bit as good as you could find in Tennessee.  Nothing on earth quite like a real breakfast -- especially if it's been awhile.
After that I hiked into Salisbury, CT with a NOBO thru named Lost Cause.  A nice guy, mid-40's from Southern Mississippi.  I've seen him on and off for a week or so, and I like him.  Strong hiker and good guy.  Great sense of humor.  Lost Cause headed into Salisbury to resupply, but I didn't need to so I just continued up the trail.
I climbed up and over Lion's Head and Bear Mountain (of course they have macho names -- could you imagine Housecat's Head and Hamster Mountain?), then settled into my tent at Sages Ravine just across the Massachusetts border.  Sages Ravine is a truly spectacular spot, with towering Eastern Hemlock trees and a beautiful gurgling creek called Sawmill Brook.  This will be my last night on the trail for this hike, and I can't think of a finer spot to be.

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654342,"Ahhh, what a hike I've had.  And from my perspective there's no question that the last bit really was the best.  Waking up in Sages Ravine is waking up in paradise.  Even the birds acknowledge that it's a special place -- there's just a bit more gusto in their morning serenade.  I feel the same way about it.
And I think the ledges on Mount Race just might be my favorite spot of the whole Delaware Water Gap to Great Barrington section.  These ledges extend for 0.6 miles along the upper reaches of Mount Race, and the views are flat out jaw-dropping.  For those familiar with Tinker Cliffs in Virginia, this place is a lot like that.  You can't help but grin uncontrollably as you walk along the spectacularly exposed trail.
Don't get me wrong.  I really enjoyed the trail through New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.  These places take a back seat to nowhere.  But heading NOBO into Massachusetts means getting back into some serious elevation change.  I guess I'm just all about mountains.  Big, beautiful, steep, challenging and rewarding mountains.  The Berkshires are a blast!
My last day on trail also brought more trail magic.  2021 NOBO thru Rubicon and her dad, Papa Ruby, had a wonderful spread set up near the Shay's Rebellion Memorial.  Thanks, you two.  And, as a final send-off, when I got to US 7 I couldn't get a hitch into Great Barrington so I gave up and started walking the three miles into town.  Almost immediately after that a car pulled up and a local hiker named Pokey offered me a ride.  Thanks, Pokey.  Guys like you are what makes the long distance hiking community so phenomenal.
And that's a wrap.  Thanks so much for reading and for your kind and encouraging words.  One of the best things I encountered along the way this time was a stone tablet on Bear Mountain in New York which read ""The journey shared is a life well lived.""  Aaahhh.  That's a wonderful point of view.  And I really like that nowadays there are so many ways to share our respective journeys.  To me, this whole Trail Journals business is just plain genius.  Until next time, be safe, hike strong, and peace to all.
