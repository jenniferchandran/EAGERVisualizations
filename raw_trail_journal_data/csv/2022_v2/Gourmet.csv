It rained and snowed all night last night, very chilly. Today we hiked 9 miles, most in snow. I will say there were 3 blizzards. This is the first time that I was truly thankful that i had on rain gear! Most the time I just sweat, not today! Only saw a few people today. Met a young man and his dog Juniper. Talked with him awhile. While we took a long lunch at the Vandeventer shelter a mom and her 3 daughters came in. They were thru hiking also. Hope to see them again.

I had a list of things I needed to get in Damascus (the trail goes right through town). I fell a little short. I purchased socks, new mattress pad, a hat (photo soon), and lunch at the diner. I also stopped at the Broken Fiddle hostel and took a shower and did my laundry. It was great hiking down into Damascus but what goes down on the trail must go back up.

I like to see the views on top and when I'm winding on the trail looking across the expanse to where I'm going. It is awe inspiring and makes me a little dizzy. I fell today. No big deal, I tripped on a rock. Just mud on my knee. Walked on a bike trail for awhile. When she stopped to talk to me, she found that I was going to Maine and took my photo.

Best day ever! 15 Ponies spectacular! I also reached the 500 mile point today. I met so many people today including a university group that all had the same backpack as me. I took their photo.

Good news, I have a trail name ( Gourmet). I normally don't eat typical trail dehydrated food. I usually eat ham cheese on a tortilla. I also purchase a few pieces of fresh fruit. Today reminded me of the book ""Walking with Spring "" by Earl Shaffer. I get to hike and see the foliage come to life.  I had to climb over three of these ladder things today.","Quarter way inn

We also made stops at the farm implement store, the hardware store, recycling place, dropped off some backpacks, dropped off a hiker at the grocery store, picked up eggs at a farm. At 4:00 she does a short yoga session. I did this. Busy lady! Saw a fantastic sunrise right from my tent. I knew it would happen! She has pigs, cows and goats here. She also grows the vegetables that she cooks the meals with.  Excellent place to take a 0 day. I may not have hiked today but I am still on an adventure!","Woods Hole Hostel

Lots of new wildflowers: yellow bellwort, white nodding trillium, jack in the pulpit, sweet williams and blooming May apples. I had high hopes that the zero day at the hostel, new inserts and slack packing today would turn my feet into feet I recognize and can hike with. Sad to say this wasn't the case. Hiking with achy heels did something to my right hip. By the time I got to Cross Ave I couldn't even walk. I called my daughter (driving home from Florida) and asked her to see where the closest train station was so I could come home. Her and her husband decided to come and pick me up.
