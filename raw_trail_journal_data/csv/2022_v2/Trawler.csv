Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646176,"A few years ago, (2016 I believe), My son, Luke (Bladerunner) and I walked a section hike on the AT in North Carolina from Deep Gap to Fontana Village, a distance of about 80 miles.  We did a lot of planning with the exception of looking at the weather forecast.  About 15 minutes into our hike after being dropped off by a shuttle at the trailhead, it started hailing and pouring rain.  We hiked in rain for the next 48 hours not knowing that we were in the remnants of a tropical storm.  To say the least, the conditions were miserable.  
After the rain ended we had several great hiking days with incredible views.  I was 59 at the time and will never forget the climb up Albert Mountain.  We met some really fantastic people during that hike.  Reflecting on our experience on the ride back to South Georgia, I realized that I must do a thru hike of the entire AT.  Work and family responsibilities have thus far prevented that from happening.
During late summer of this year I began preparing to begin my hike in February of 2022.  I read lots of books and started researching gear and everything else I could to try to have the best hike possible.
Unfortunately, family issues again got in the way, and there was simply no way I could leave Tawnya (my wife of 36 years) with what we were facing.  I’ll elaborate on that more as I write more journals and I become more comfortable sharing.
So, it seemed my dream was dead for now and the chances of it happening in the future appeared dim.  I am 65 now and as the saying goes, “not getting any younger”.
But then, totally out of the blue………..

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646285,"Well, Christmas 2021 turned out to be one for the record books.  We spent family time together blessing some homeless people in Augusta, Ga with food and personal items. That was Luke’s (Bladerunner’s) idea, and it was very special.  My youngest son, Adam gave Tawnya and I a card for Christmas that partially read, “I gave you the best gift that money can’t buy. Sober Christmas from me and Luke.”  It really was the best Christmas for our family in decades.
You see, our family had been battling the disease of addition for a very long time and for everyone to be together, happy and sober was a Blessing straight from God Almighty.
But….even better than that, Adam shared with me on Christmas Day that he wanted to do a thru hike of the AT and would love for us to do it together.  All of a sudden out of the blue I was back on.  My not being able to go this year was primarily due to Adam’s struggles and Tawnya not able to bear the stress that caused without my physical and emotional support.
I had always assumed that Bladerunner and I would be the ones hiking together (and that may happen in the future), but I am super excited that Adam has this dream.
We have set a date of March 29, two days after he graduates from a rehabilitation program, to begin the journey of a lifetime!
Well, we certainly have a lot to do in a short time.

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646318,"Why is my name Trawler?Well, since you asked,  I had a real fear of showing up on the trail without a trail name.   My oldest son, Luke, showed up that way with knives and a hatchet hanging from his belt and almost immediately became known as “Bladerunner”!  A friend of mine began a thru hike in the 1990s at the age of 62 (three years younger than I am now) and was extremely slow.  The trail name given to him was “Christmas”, as in “as slow as”.  Those two examples are actually mild compared to some other names I have heard.  For that reason, I decided it safer to choose my own.Some printable nicknames I have been called in a the past are “Mac”, for my Scottish last name,  “Tim-O-thy” from the SNL skit “substitute teacher, “G-man” for past employment and “Captain Tim” because Tawnya and I have been full time live aboards on a 45’ Motor Vessel for the past 4 years.I considered all of the above and some others before settling on “Trawler”.  A trawler is the type of boat we live on.  She is built for comfort, not for speed.  She will not get up on plane, and is very happy getting passed by most other motorboats. She is all about slow and steady.  We love to tell folks we come in contact with that we are seeing the world at the speed of a riding lawn mower.So, I thought Trawler would be very fitting for me at my age and projected speed.  I will not be fast, will not mind being passed by other hikers, and will really enjoy the hike at a slow speed.Please stop and say, “Hi Trawler” as you pass by!",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Wed",0
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646366,"We live in a small town where word of mouth is a close second to Facebook in the speed of spreading news. So, it was really not a surprise when a former work colleague, whom I had not spoken with in a long time, heard from a mutual friend at the local coffee shop about my upcoming adventure.
The tone of his voice coupled with laughter as he said, “Ever thought of buying a lathe and working with wood?”, indicated how crazy he thought I was for planning to thru hike the AT.
Now, I have nothing against woodworking, and if that is your calling, by all means go for it.  It is not, however, mine.  My current strong calling is this hike with Adam, to take one step at a time toward our goal while taking time to marvel at God’s majestic creation along the way.
I am also pretty sure the air will be cleaner, views better, and many more amazing folks met on the trail than in a woodworking shop.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Mon",0
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646407,"Tawnya and I went to our support group last evening.  Friends and Family for Recovery (FFR) was started by Johnny and Beth, the founders of a non-profit called the Remedy Project.  For over a decade they have provided professional counseling and crisis intervention to addicts and their families for free!  They, and the many folks we have met at FFR, have been instrumental in our recovery and our family’s reconciliation. Tawnya and I shared from the heart some of the pain and victories that have happened on our journey.  
Several of the members came to us after the meeting ended and thanked us over and over for sharing and told us of their current similar struggles and how we had helped them.  We have come to realize that during those darkest hours where there appears to be no hope, God is with us and is preparing us to share our faith and story with others.
When I mentioned my plans for the thru hike with Adam to a few in the group, the love, support and encouragement was overwhelming.  Just to be planning this trip after how broken our family was is nothing short of a miracle.
I am continuing my planning and preparation and looking forward to this trip and the amazing people I will meet.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Thu",0
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646502,"Really enjoyed our family trip to North Georgia this past weekend.  Enjoyed some quality time with Tawnya, Luke (Bladerunner) and his wife, Brooke and her son, Hayden and Adam (Tinker).  We enjoyed seeing some light snow and some cold, for us, temperatures.  Seeing the mountains first hand got us very excited about the hike.
We went to Smoky Mountain Trader in Cleveland, GA and picked up some gear for Tinker.  He decided on the Osprey Volt 60 pack, a pair of Saucony trail runners and a pair of Darn Tough socks.  I highly recommend Smoky Mountain Trader if you find yourself in the Cleveland area.  They are knowledgeable and well stocked.
I have been spending my “free” time watching YouTube videos, researching gear, making a couple of items (food cozy pouch and cooking pot cozy) and ordering gear. 
I gained a lot of respect (already had a bunch) for the folks that are on the trail now in the winter.  You guys rock!  We are patiently waiting on a little warmer weather.",,View Entry,"Jan 25, Tue",0
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646605,"Well, I am officially retired for the second time.  I have no plans to retire the third time.  I retired from my US Government service at the end of June, 2008 and retired as a Financial Advisor with Edward Jones as of yesterday January 28th.  The photo is the garbage can where my awards ended up.  As I have mentioned before, Tawnya and I live on a boat and don’t have a lot of room for extras.  It is kinda sad/ironic that I worked hard to earn the awards that were presented at fancy awards dinners and this is where they end up.  Oh well, turn the page and start a new chapter.
I have worked since I was 15 years old (even while attending college) and this retirement thing will take some getting used to.  I am thankful and blessed to have our upcoming thru hike to keep me motivated and busy.

From the time he was a toddler, he was definitely a tinkerer.  It is his calling.  I will assure you that he is now far more than a tinkerer!  He is a really skilled auto technician.  Dad’s opinion, but wouldn’t you agree that anyone who could go to a junk yard at 1:30 p.m. and remove an engine from a pickup truck, have it placed on a cart and be checking out around 4:30 has skill?  Also takes skill to take that engine, put it another truck and have it up and running a couple of days later!
I am really looking forward to hiking the AT with Tinker.  We missed out on a few things during the last decade.  We have some catching up to do!

For the past several years, Tawnya and I have financially supported and volunteered some of our time to help Hope 1312 Collective.  In 2014, Hope’s founders, Ally and Amy saw a child welfare system that was broken, and had a vision to become a liaison between the Church, the community, and the child welfare system.
I do not believe I have ever been privileged to work with people as intelligent, talented, caring and committed as the folks at Hope 1312.  That says a lot considering I worked 20 years for the world’s premier law enforcement agency, and 13 years at, in my opinion,  the best financial services firm in the country.  We have been blessed to witness, first hand, miraculous changes in the lives of these precious children through their efforts.


So, I have decided to Hike for Hope.  Hope for the kids thru Hope 1312.  Please follow along, pray and support this endeavor.  You can find some great information about their mission at https://www.hope1312co.org/

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646919,"Part of our preparation for the upcoming hike is to move KNOT QUITTERS from Chesapeake, VA to our home port of Brunswick, GA for Nurse Tawnya, my First Mate, to stay there during my absence while on the trail.  During the second day of our travels, while crossing the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina, we heard a noise coming from the engine room.  Upon inspection, I discovered a severe hydraulic leak that required us to shut down our engine to avoid further damage.  We have a “get home” engine that I started, but it will only push KNOT QUITTERS along at about 4 knots, which put our ETA into the nearest repair yard 61 miles away at around 11 p.m.
We have TowBoat US towing insurance and placed a call for assistance.  I highly recommend that any boater have their insurance or a Seatow membership prior to leaving a dock.  They were able to get us to safety about two hours earlier and we felt more comfortable with them navigating at night with local knowledge of the intracoastal waterway.
In our boating travels we make a concerted effort to plan for the worse and hope for the best.  We have learned this is good policy in other areas of our lives such as our health, our finances and just about everything else.  I got to thinking about our hike and how I could best make such plans.  What if Trawler (the hiker, not the boat) developed “a severe hydraulic leak that required him to shut down his main engine”.  What would he do?  Who would he call?  Would he call “TowHiker US” hiking insurance?  Is there such a thing?
Well, first of all I know without a shadow of a doubt that God is my deliverer (Psalm 18:2) and that He plans to prosper me and not harm me, and plans to give me hope and a future (Jeremiah 29:11).  Sounds like my first call should be to God.  That is some pretty fantastic hiker’s insurance. The rest of my plan involves trying my best to use my God given sense to do my best to make good safety decisions and call on my hiking family and friends when need be.  I am planning for the worst and hoping for the best.

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647210,"We met at a summer camp for kids in foster care a few years back.  He was a 10 year old camper waiting for a forever home, 9 placement disruptions in two years, 6 mental health diagnoses, and a trauma history that evokes a visceral reaction.  He arrived at camp in a dark hoodie he refused to remove in the 95 degree weather.   I was one of four men volunteers asked to work with him that week after he verbally threatened another camper.


At the end of a very difficult and challenging camp week our new friend was transported to placement number 10 by a transporter unknown by him.  With unstoppable tears flowing down our faces, we wondered if we had been able to make any difference in such a short time in his otherwise traumatic life.  We felt like we had done our best to show him Christlike love, but could a week at camp make any difference?
The DFCS director was invited to come speak to our team at training for the following years camp and she agreed requesting that she share a story of how camp changed the life of a child.  When she began to tell her story, our team began to lock eyes, “11 year old, 10 placement disruptions, 6 mental health diagnosis, and a week at camp that changed his whole life.” A week at THIS CAMP not only could but had made a difference in his life.


Last afternoon and evening Tawnya and I took this now 14 year old camper bowling, to an arcade and to an “all you can eat” buffet.  He never received his permanent placement and currently resides in a home for “troubled” boys.  But, it has been incredible to see how much he has matured and the progress he has made.  His grades have improved and he has become a very kind young man with a contagious smile.


One of the arcade prizes he chose was two red plastic necklaces that read “Best Friends” when they are together.  He kept one and gave the other one to me.  We talked about how our hearts would be broken while I was away on the trail but we would have the necklace to remind us of our friendship.


I fully realize that a 14 year old boy may lose his necklace but you can bet your bottom dollar (instead I would hope that you would give to Hope 1312 Collective so that many more lives may be changed…..click on the link) that I will do my best to take my broken heart necklace with me from Georgia to Maine and reflect on our friendship often.


If you come by me on the trail and I’m staring at a little red plastic broken heart you will know why.  If you wish, I’d love to share with you some other incredible things I’ve witnessed firsthand.

Tawnya and I drove across South Georgia yesterday to visit our moms before we leave.  Her mom is 89, mine 94.


Today at her mom’s apartment will be spent watching 24 hour news, court tv, Dr. Phil, local news, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and several hours of game show Network.


Tomorrow at my mom’s assisted living home will be spent finishing her taxes, filling the bird feeders outside her window, helping her with internet issues so she can keep up with kids, grandkids, and great grandkids on Facebook, and taking her and her younger sister (89) to lunch.This trip to our moms is definitely motivating me to do this thru hike while this 65 year old body still has a chance.
I started thinking about Wheel of Fortune and all those folks spinning it and hoping for a fortune.  Is that better than working 50 years saving what you can and hoping you run out of life before you run out of money?


And what about Jeopardy?  Those folks have all the answers!  All they have to do is ask the correct questions.  As I get ready to head out into the woods I have far more questions than answers!


Why is there cancer in the world and why does it attack some people and not others?  Why do some children have parents that physically, mentally and sexually abuse them?  Why is there such a thing as drug addiction that destroys lives and relationships?  What is God’s will for the rest of my life?

I’m committed to being totally honest with you with my journals and to be totally honest this start was tougher than I thought it would be. The 604 stair steps up to the top of Amicalola Falls was brutal.


We both experienced some muscle cramps and pains with Tinker’s being some what worse than mine.


We have not formally met anyone yet but have talked with several very interesting folks. We saw one lady with a small dog. When we first saw her she was walking the dog but we saw her two times after that and she was carrying the dog in a pouch that hung around her neck. I love dogs but I’m pretty sure I would not do that.


We were passed by pretty much everybody on the trail today. One fella looked like he was 10 years my senior another couple that were my age bunches of young people and one lady riding a motorized Walmart shopping cart. OK that last one is not true but it felt like we were going that slow .LOL.


Our day tomorrow will be mostly downhill but we still plan to take it very slow to try to get our bodies accustomed to the trail.


It is supposed to be around 40° tonight. Should be perfect for sleeping outdoors.

Before we started we had a hot breakfast and discovered we have some work to do on our freezer bag cooking skills unless you like your grits clumpy and not soaked with water all the way through. I’m sure it will get better as time goes along.


Very foggy morning so there was not a view from the top of the mountain but it was so exciting to officially pass our first white blaze and hit the trail.


Trail is very busy lots of folks beginning this time of year we are definitely in the bubble.


We experience our  first trail magic at Springer Mountain parking lot. Mountain Squid was there welcoming this year‘s class of through hickers and provided us with a Capri Sun. He did not say but I assume he is a former through hiker because he was giving us advice about the White Mountains.


Stopped for lunch at Stover Creek shelter and met a bunch of other interesting through hickers.


Left The shelter and after about a quarter of a mile we came upon Randy and Dave. Randy is a gentleman in his 70s and by the bruises on his arms obviously on blood thinner as I am.  He had just fallen off the trail with his pack on and rolled down a cliff and was stopped by a tree thankfully. Dave had just rescued him and had gotten him back to the trail. Dave advised us that we were going the wrong way on the trail. We made a rookie mistake and had turned the wrong way out of the shelter and were backtracking south. Thankfully we learned it early and got turned around.


We had met Freebird at the shelter where we stopped for lunch and she shared with Adam that she is a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for two years. We leapfrogged each other several times during the remainder of the day and decided to camp together at a really neat church cemetery at Hickory Flats.

We had a horrendous storm during the night that lasted for several hours. I don’t have any way to measure wind speed but the forecast was for winds of approximately 50 mph and I’m pretty sure that their forecast was fairly accurate. It rained steadily for several hours.  


I was very impressed and extremely satisfied with our tarp and hammock set up. Even in those conditions we stayed completely dry.


We said our goodbyes to Freebird. She was only off work for a few days and decided to turn around and head south back to Springer.


We came across our first First Ridge runner today.  He was very pleasant and very informative about the upcoming trail and campsites ahead.


At horse gap I asked Tinker how far it was to the next water source as I was down to less than a liter of water. We had a long climb ahead of us and I was somewhat disappointed to learn that the next water source was 3.8 miles ahead. He had some water and so we decided to go on. On the climb up God provided us with water out of a rock that was not in the trail guide. We were not even grumbling and Moses was not there to strike the rock but we were able to resupply and had enough for the rest of our hike today.


We were pleasantly surprised to come across Randy later in the day. He had been ahead of us all day and had stopped for a break. He plans to get off the trail at Gooch gap for a short break.

Tinker ran out of cigarettes yesterday and found out that he is not quite ready to quit the bad habit. We called a shuttle driver just before Gooch gap but he was not able to meet us but said that he could meet us at Woody gap in about two hours.


We checked the Farout app and saw that Woody Gap was 4 miles away and probably not doable by us in two hours. But we moved in a pace faster than we normally do and was pleasantly surprised that Murris was waiting for us at Woody gap shortly after 12 o’clock.


A short 2 mile ride down the road in the back of his pickup truck and Tinker scored smokes and we both scored a Hunt Brothers Pizza and Dr. Peppers.


When we got back to Woody gap Randy had made it to the gap and was able to get a room in a nearby hostel for the night.  I am really impressed with this man. With his heart condition his doctor told him he should go home and just sit in a recliner. So, he decided to walk the Appalachian Trail!


Chillbilly gave us some water and a lot of advice about the trail ahead. With that much good food and beverage in our bellies we made the hard climb up Big Cedar Mountain. The view was well worth the climb. It is by far the best view we have had yet.


We have hung our hammocks for the night at Lance Creek. Tomorrow we have our first real big climb up Blood Mountain. We are going from 2866 feet up to the top of Blood Mountain at 4459 feet in about 5 miles.

It was a little too hazy to be able to see Atlanta.


We saw scores of day hikers on both sides of Blood Mountain. As steep as the ascent was the descent into Neel gap was even steeper.


We stopped at Mountain Crossing Outfitters at Neel gap and saw the famous tree with all the boots hanging on it from hikers that decided to give it up at that point.


We picked up our resupply box that Tawnya and I had mailed prior to our starting the hike. We realized that we have way too much food and not wanting to carry it we shared it with other hikers. They were most appreciative. We also sent home a box full of stuff that we realize we can do without and do not want to carry any longer.


We have been leapfrogging Big A from Tucson since the beginning of the hike. We had not seen him since He left the trail to stay in a hostel last night. He showed up at Neel gap while we were there and was able to score some of the food that we were leaving behind.

Space Fox provided music for for us with her guitar and singing around the campfire. One of the younger guys in the crowd had packed in a six pack of tall PBRs.  If I was going to pack in beer, and I’m not, I’m pretty sure it would not be PBR. It did however remind me of Brunswick Landing Marina where that is the only beer on tap but at a very good price.


In attendance at the campfire was a young German man and a young German lady (not together). They were not at all impressed with the PBR even though it would be considered imported beer in their home country.


Met Les on the trail today. He is from Louisiana and is hiking in full camouflage. I have suggested the trail name The Invisible Man.  Hope it sticks.


We also met Solo who openly shared that he suffers from schizophrenia.  We plan to keep our distance.


Alicia is hiking with her small dog, Lucky.  When  he can no longer go she carries him in a shoulder pouch.


We met our first southbound hiker who is almost finished with his through hike. Congratulations Hard Goods. Job well done.


Word on trail was that there is trail magic at Hogpen gap and they would be there until 3 o’clock. We picked up our pace and got there about 30 minutes before they packed everything up. It was really a treat from a couple who just do this for the benefit of hikers.


We shared with Scritch and Jesse yesterday that we had scored the Hunt Brothers Pizza. He had that on his mind while approaching Neel  gap where they have pizza and sandwiches. Scritch  let me know in no uncertain terms just how he felt about us telling him about the pizza because when he got to Neel gap they were out of pizza.


Our legs and stamina are getting better each day.

A comment in the far out app said that there was not a view at the top of Blue Mountain  and to just keep walking. The review was accurate and we did.

We had two hard climbs today. The first was Rocky Mountain and the second and more difficult was Tray Mountain. It was very cloudy all day and we did not have any views at all. It is kinda disappointing making hard climbs and not being rewarded with a view but that is part of it.


We saw very few hikers on the trail today. We think that a lot of folks may have taken another day off the trail because we have more rain that is supposed to roll in this evening and into the night.


We stopped for the day at about 4:20 so that we would have plenty of time to set up our tarp and hammock before the rain starts.


I told Tinker that I had a really hard time today. I don’t know if it was coming off of the zero day or the two hard climbs or the combination of the two but I really struggled today. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.

Plum Orchard is the last shelter in Georgia going North.  It is a quality item.  It is a two story structure made of big timber designed to sleep 14.  According to a plaque on the wall it was brought here by a Chinook helicopter in November 1992.


We were hikers number 2 & 3 to arrive.  Rice was here.  His wife, Beans, had to get off the trail due to family illness.  We had last seen them about a week ago.


By 3 pm there were 6 of us in the shelter, all asleep.  Others continued to arrive and before nightfall there were 10 of us in the shelter and about 6 others in tents.


So far there has only been snow flurries off and on.  Tinker and I are all settled in for our first night in a shelter and most likely a very cold one.

Breaking down camp was difficult. My hands felt like they had been left in a bucket of water inside of a freezer overnight. It was hard untying knots and packing up in general but we got it done.  We did get a late start and it was after 9:30 AM when we finally hit the trail headed north.


What a difference a few hours makes. Before lunchtime we were in short sleeves and Tinker was in shorts. We met Ryan from Orlando hiking alone. We saw him again at lunch at Beach gap and he gave me a can of potted meat. 


We came up on a heavyset hiker hiking alone. Soon after we passed him I knew I had seen him somewhere. I asked him if he had a YouTube channel and he said that he did.  He said that it is called “too heavy to hike”.  I remember looking at one of his videos before I started the hike.


Early in the afternoon Tinker started having some pain in his right ankle. It looked really doubtful that we were going to get many miles in today at all. We stopped and wrapped it up with KT tape and he was able to continue on.

I was a little concerned that it might be more of a challenge now that I am 65.  Albert certainly did not disappoint as I was on all fours about three different times going up the rock face of the mountain. It is however now in the rearview mirror.
We spent about an hour at the top having lunch and taking advantage of cell service that we had not had in a couple of days. Just as we were getting ready to leave we were surprised but very happy to see our new friends Scritch and Jesse.

I’m sure as I write this that Scritch is having a meat lovers pizza and can’t wait to rub it in the next time he sees me.

Shortly after getting on the trail we saw Mongu and Sam. We had not seen them in several days. Sam was really excited because she had purchased some much better hiking shoes from the outfitter store in Franklin.


Later in the day we met Donkey & Beaver.  They are a really nice young couple from New Hampshire who quit their jobs to take six months to hike the trail before re-entering the workforce.


We came across trail angel Kelly again today. She provided us with a folding chair to sit down in and also some tasty treats.


When we were in Franklin at the outfitter one of the very knowledgeable hikers who works there told Tinker that the reason he is experiencing ankle pain is probably because we increased our mileage too fast.  We went from an 8 mile per day average to doing 12 1/2 miles one day in the sleet and snow. He advised us to cut back on the mileage until his ankle gets better.


We planned to only do 8 miles today and during the afternoon Tinker started having bad pain in both ankles now and it was a struggle just to get the 8 miles in.

While we were eating lunch there must’ve been a dozen hikers that passed by. Among them were Mangú, Sam, Blackjack, Purple Rain and Gil. They all had gotten a later start than us and blew by us while we were eating.


Tinker continues to have problems with his feet.

Pretty awesome.  Misfit from North Carolina had just finished her lunch on the observation deck when we arrived.
The long steep climb down from Wesser Bald to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) was somewhat nerve-racking.

It is a short walk across the property to a common bathroom with showers and up above is a kitchen area for us to use.



The accommodations were a little too primitive for my liking. The absence of sheets and a pillow made for a somewhat restless night. At least we were inside and dry from the rain during the night.

Rhythm had been hanging out with three young ladies the last few days and we did not know their trail names so we referred to them as Rhythm and the three girls. Kind of sounds like a band. Rhythm left before us and we did not see him the rest of the day. We did get to meet the three young ladies and their names are Alpine, Sweets & Jedi.


We met our first Ridge runner in the Smokies today, his name is David.  I have read and have been told by others that we have 8 days to make our way through the great Smoky Mountain National Park.  Fearing that we would not make that I asked David about it. He said that as long as we are not hanging out  an excessive period of time it is not a problem if we are continuing to move through or if we go into Gatlinburg to nurse an injury which we are probably going to do.


We made the climb to the top of Rocky Top today. Thankfully I had cell service and I was able to play a YouTube video of the song Rocky Top while we were up there. From the really hard climb and tough terrain, I’m pretty sure there’s not any moonshining going on up there.


Later in the day we met our second Ridge runner, Amelia.  She thru hiked the AT in 2017 with her father who had recently retired as a police officer.  I understood her to say that her trail name was Ridgeline but Tinker heard her say Treeline. He has much better hearing than I so we will go with what he heard.


I fell today.  It is actually my third fall. I did not want to tell you about the first two because the first one was on day two and I was so afraid that everyone would think that there’s no way I’m going to make it to Maine if I fall on the second day. Thankfully that time I just slipped in soft mud and just got mud all over my bottom. There was no injury or pain. The second time I went all the way to the ground on my side but I did not have any injury or pain.  Today was different. I slipped and fell right on my left butt cheek on either a small log or a rock. Either way it was harder than the padding on my butt and I lay there in pain for a few minutes. Other than being sore and probably bruised I did not break anything so I am blessed beyond measure.


When we arrived at Derrick Knob Shelter to set up our hammocks, Sky King and Jesse were already there and had their tent set up.  I told Sky King about my fall and he asked if it was bruised. I told him that I have not been able to take a look at it but if he wanted to check it out he was more than welcome. He declined.


I am finding the climbs in the Smokies to be somewhat challenging. Tinker is being extremely patient and waiting on me.


We are 10.2 miles from Clingmans Dome which at 6612 feet is the highest point on the Appalachian trail.  We plan to go 7.4 miles tomorrow to the next shelter so that we will not have to make that long climb all in one day.","Russell Field Shelter

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649534,"I checked the forecast before we went to bed or should I say hammock last night. There was a 0% chance of rain and the low was supposed to be 52°. The predicted low must’ve been in a lower elevation because it was probably closer to 40° when we got up and there was such a heavy dew that our hammocks were totally wet. We had not put up the tarps.


We continued to do many ups and downs throughout the day but we are progressively getting higher in the Smokies.  We started out this morning at 4830 feet and ended the day at 5487. We have a tough climb ahead of us tomorrow. We are going up 865 feet in 2.8 miles to the top of Clingmans Dome.


We crossed another milestone today. Each year the official distance of the Appalachian Trail changes. For 2022 it is 2194.3 miles. We stopped at mile 194.3 and celebrated that we now have 2000 miles left to go. Rhythm, Alpine, Sweets and Jedi came along as we were celebrating and joined in the celebration with us.


Sky King and Jesse had already arrived and set up at their tent when we got to the shelter.  Sky King knows that we are now both nursing injuries , Tinker’s feet and my butt, and for the second day in a row has gone to the water source to get water for us when we arrive.  I definitely owe him at least one meat lover’s pizza when we get into a town together.


We officially met Miriam and Lorax.  We camped next to them one night and have seen them several times. We have noticed that even though they are young they are traveling at about the same slow speed that we are.  They are walking the trail together on their honeymoon.  That could have something to do with their slow speed as they probably have other things to work into their day.


The forecast for tonight is a low of 49° with a 0% chance of rain. Yes, the tarp is up.","Derrick Knob 
",Double Spring Gap,"Apr 24, Sun",7.40
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649671,"I woke up during the night and saw someone walking around the campsite with a headlamp on and then heard them stumbling around a bit and then lower their food bags from the bear cables.  I looked at the clock and it was 2:28 AM.  I continued to hear quite the ruckus until about 4 AM and I fell back asleep.There were at least 15 to 20 hikers in and around the shelter last night. When I finally made myself get out of my hammock at about 7 AM there was only one tent left and that was Sky King and Jesse.  Sky King and Tinker overheard them the night before saying that they were going to leave in the middle of the night so that they could make it up to the top of Clingmans Dome to watch the sunrise.


We commented about how foggy it was and that the probability of them seeing the sunrise was very small.


I made a wrong turn when we approached Clingmans Dome and Tinker followed right behind. We did not realize it until we had gone probably about 2/10 of a mile. We were headed to the Clingmans Dome parking lot instead of up to the top. So we got a little additional uphill today.


By the time we got to the top the sky had cleared considerably and we were able to enjoy the gorgeous views from the top of the dome.  We hit two milestones today. We passed mile 200 and we climbed to the highest point on the Appalachian Trail.


We ended the day at Mount Collins Shelter and set up our hammocks. The shelter is about a half of a mile off of the trail but we were in need of water and there is a spring nearby. Also we are setting up to have about 5 miles to go tomorrow to Newfound Gap where we are going to be picked up by my friend John and he is going to take us in to Gatlinburg.


Tomorrow will be our sixth straight day on the trail without a break and we have just enough food to get us there plus we desperately need showers and to wash our clothes. Also, Tinker needs to rest his feet. They are doing better but we want to give them a break. I have also started having some back pain and could use some time off myself.


By the way, when we got to the shelter Miriam and Lorax were there. They told us that the group was successful to get to the top of Clingmans Dome before sunrise but it was cloudy.  They did actually see the sun but only for a few seconds.","Double Spring Gap
",Mount Collins Shelter ,"Apr 25, Mon",5.60
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649707,"We got up had breakfast and started packing up with the threat of rain but so far dry.  My good boating friend, John Guarino, was scheduled to meet us at Newfound Gap at 2:30 PM. We got an earlier start than usual and quickly realized that the mostly downhill 5 mile hike was going to take considerably less time than expected even though now the steady rain had set in.
We did not have cell service so I messaged John on my Garman in-reach and let him know that our ETA was now 12:30 PM. He message back saying that he would meet us then.
I was getting hungry as we were approaching Indian grave gap. I was thinking that it would really be nice if there was a picnic table under a shelter there where we could get out of the rain and eat a snack.  There was not a picnic table but when we arrived there was a dump truck and two steam rollers with a roof over the drivers seat. We each hopped up on one of the steam rollers and had our snack out of the rain. The Lord certainly does provide.  Just as we were leaving a semi truck with a flatbed trailer showed up apparently to load them up and haul them away. Our timing again was perfect.
We got to Newfound Gap about 10 minutes after 11, considerably sooner than we had told John, so we had a wait ahead of us in the light rain.  First Baptist Church of Sevierville, Tennessee was there in a van with a load of trail magic. They had a cooler full of soft drinks, fruit and sweets. They also run a free shuttle from the gap into Gatlinburg several times a day. Thanks FBC. Y’all are wonderful.
John arrived right at 12:30 and gave us a ride to our motel in Gatlinburg. He also stayed to take us to do laundry and for a visit.  He is a very experienced hiker and gave us a lot of good advice about the area. Thanks so much John you are a Godsend and a true friend.

We saw Dave in town and he and Tinker exchanged phone numbers. We hooked up later and had a really good dinner at an Italian restaurant that John had recommended to us. They had awesome garlic rolls and the pizza was very good also.","Mount Collins Shelter

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649717,"We took a total zero in Gatlinburg today. Not a lot to report.
We went to Crockett breakfast camp for breakfast. Everything there is huge. I had two pancakes that were enormous and Tinker had a sausage egg and cheese  biscuit that was huge.
We then came back to the motel and rested until we went back out to lunch to Shoney’s all you can eat buffet. We both made three trips.
We then came back to the motel and rested until dinner. After dinner we will come back and go to sleep.
There is an awesome outfitters store here and we did go and buy a canister of fuel and a pair of toe socks and a belt for Tinker.
I know it sounds kind of strange but I miss the trail. I am ready to get going in the morning and get headed north.","Gatlinburg

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649861,"After a somewhat lighter breakfast of two eggs and a biscuit (Tinker had two eggs and toast), we walked across the street to the NOC and waiting on the shuttle to take us back to Newfound Gap.  Tickle Monster and No Time and at least 10 other hikers were waiting and we were wondering if they would be able to take all of us at once.


The good folks from First Baptist Church showed up with two vans and made room for everyone.   These people are really great. They told us on the way that they will be at trail days in Damascus and will wash hikers clothes for free and also have a hot shower set up.


Today was an absolutely perfect day for a hike. It was clear and very mild temperatures and we had several awesome views along the way including Charlie’s Bunion.  Alpine arrived at Charlie’s Bunion while we were there and took our picture on top of the rock out cropping.  It was the first time we saw her without Sweets and Jedi.  We did not ask why.


We came upon Miriam and Lorax after about 3 miles into our hike. They were at a water source getting water. We leapfrogged them several times throughout the day and ended the day at the same shelter.There continues to be a lot of hikers staying in and around the shelters but we have not had any trouble finding trees to hang our hammocks yet.
We are a little over 20 miles from being to the northern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.


Tawnya continues to do an excellent job sending us re-supply boxes. The one that John brought to us in Gatlinburg that she had mailed to his residence was perfect. We did not have to add anything at all while we were there.","Newfound Gap

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649976,"With the exception of Miriam and Lorax, we were the last ones to leave the crowded shelter area this morning.  We were on the trail a few minutes after 9:30. 


We had a short and fairly easy hike today.  In the Smokies you are required to stay at a shelter or camp in the vicinity of a shelter or an approved tent site.  From where we started our day, the next shelter was 5.2 miles and the next one after that was 12.9 miles. We were not quite ready to do the 12.9 so we stopped after 5.2 miles today.


We officially met Lady Bird and Himp  (Hot Dog In My Pocket).  We have seen them several times in the last couple of days. They are a couple of nice ladies hiking together.


We arrived at the shelter at 1:45 PM and slowly set up our hammocks and tarp.  Miriam and Lorax arrived shortly after and set up their tent near our hammocks.  A few minutes later Lady Bird and Himp arrived and did the same.


A little while later Blane arrived.  We had not seen him in over a week.
He is back on trail after six days going to sister’s wedding.  That kinda gives you an idea of how slow we are moving and how fast some of the younger folks are going.  He was off the trail for six days and is at the same place as us.


There is a chance of rain tonight so we have set up our tarps and hopefully are prepared for it.  Overall the weather in the Smokies has been absolutely beautiful.  We only have about 15 miles left in the park.","Peck’s Corner
",Tri-Corner Knob Shelter,"Apr 29, Fri",5.20
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650007,"There is a saying in the boating community that boater’s midnight is 9 PM.  I am coming to realize that AT thru hiker’s midnight is 7 PM.  Well after midnight last night around 7:45 PM two hikers set up right next to our hammocks. We had been down for the night for a while.  They were ultralight high mileage hikers.


One of them had for his shelter an extremely small tarp that did not even have a door on it. It also did not have a floor.  They were talking about doing 20 and 30 mile days. They also mentioned a friend of theirs that was trying to thru  hike the entire 72 mile Great Smoky Mountain National Park in a 24 hour period of time.  We are trying to make our way through the park before I die or Jesus comes back, which ever occurs first.


We came upon the first shelter of the day, Cosby Knob Shelter, after 7.7 miles.  It was slightly before 1 PM when we arrived and we ate lunch there and rested for a few minutes. There was a water source adjacent to the shelter so we were able to camel up. We both felt that we needed to go on to the next shelter since we both felt good and it was so early in the day. So we made the 6.9 mile hike from there to Davenport Gap Shelter which is the last shelter going north in the park.  The terrain was also in our favor as we did not have the very long steep ups and downs that we have had up to this point.


Surprisingly, we were the first ones that showed up at the shelter for the night. Not really liking to sleep in the shelters, we found trees to hang our hammocks. This shelter is unique in that it has the shelter fenced in to keep bears from coming inside.


Shortly after we arrived, Guardian and Lawn Chair and a host of other hikers arrived.  Seemingly out of nowhere, a man named Tracey, a wheelchair salesman, showed up with beer, power drinks, Red Bull, Oreo cookies and potato chips. He is not a hiker but he had been reading about hiking and was on his way from a trade show in Nashville to his home in Greenville, South Carolina and decided to make a 1 mile hike into the woods to the shelter to bring trail magic. What a wonderful treat!  We were all so impressed that the consensus was that had he brought a wheelchair we would have gladly bought it.


We are planning on a short 3 1/2 mile hike in the morning to Standing Bear Farm Hostel.  They do not take reservations but Maria assured me on the phone that they do not turn anyone away. Tawnya has sent a resupply which should arrive there Monday.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter
",Davenport Gap Shelter,"Apr 30, Sat",14.60
Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650042,"Even though the shelter was packed and mostly with young folks last night it quieted down fairly early.  Shortly after midnight (the real midnight) Tinker and I both heard what sounded like a large animal near our hammocks.  A few of the hikers had seen a bear hanging around in the shelter area before dark. We have no way of knowing if it was a bear but I think I slept with one eye open the rest of the night.


I woke up around 6:30, a little earlier than normal, with the need to go to the toilet area. This particular shelter does not have a privy.  I met a lady on the way back with her little shovel in hand. It is a little awkward as to how to greet someone under those circumstances.


We (Tinker and I, not the lady with the shovel) had a cup of coffee and a Pop tart and then packed up and were on the trail by 8 AM.  On our short 3 1/2 mile hike to Standing Bear Farm we exited the Great Smokey Mountain National Park and went under I-40. We arrived at the Hostel shortly after 10 AM.


The hostel is unique to say the least. It will probably accommodate 25 to 30 hikers or more in several different outbuildings and tent sites. There are three Porta potties, two showers, a dryer to dry your clothes after you hand wash them and a kitchen area with the basics. There is also a fairly well stocked resupply.  It is extremely packed this time of year because of it being the first location outside of the park.


We rented a private bunkhouse that is on a flowing creek that is just big enough for two bunkbeds.


We met Sidequest, 3PO, Kay, Brian and Sailor.  Sailor is from Massachusetts. I ask her how she got the trail named Sailor since I am a boater and love to trade stories with other boaters.  She told me it was because she talks like a sailor.  Guardian, Lorax and Miriam are also here.


We are expecting to receive a resupply here in the mail from Tawnya tomorrow. We then plan to hit the trail as soon as it arrives.


I have been keeping track of our steps. The steps below do include the zero days and are therefore not all trail steps but I can assure you they are insignificant compared to the ones on the trail.

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650115,"We had planned to take a Nero but ending up taking a Zero.  Our resupply  package from Tawnya did not arrive until about 3:15 PM. We knew of a neat site to hang the hammocks about 1/10 of a mile away next to a stream before getting back to the AT so that is just what we did.


We had an awesome time and met a lot of neat folks at Standing Bear Farm. Wink is a veteran.  He served as a medic.  He grew up as a street kid and now has a passion for working with street kids as a social worker. He is finishing up his degree while hiking the trail.


Driftwood is a marine.  He caught a shuttle into town and went to Walmart and came back with steaks, bratwurst, buns, all sorts of sweets and beer for everyone at the Hostel.  Crowba is an executive chef and cooked the bratwurst and steak on a charcoal grill.  It was totally awesome.


It made me think of something Tawnya said to me recently. She said she had met someone at Brunswick Landing Marina and told him about our hike. He said that it was not a true thru hike if you got off of the trail and stayed in a hotel or a hostel.  I’m not sure what year he thru hiked the AT but he sure missed out on a lot.  Our plan is to hike every inch of the trail but also enjoy hanging out in town at hotels and hostels with some really neat people.  It is pretty cool having an executive chef cook bratwurst and steak and share it with a group of thru hikers.  By his definition we may not be doing a thru hike but I sure am enjoying whatever it is that we are doing.


We also met Outlaw, Little Moon & Hitch.  We also hung out with Guardian, Lorax and Miriam. We have not really become members of their tramily  as of yet but we are probably at least third cousins at this point. We are looking forward to spending more time with them on the trail. FYI a tramily is a trail family that one acquires or develops on the trail.


As I am writing this I am comfortably laying in my hammock adjacent to a running stream that is totally awesome. Looking forward to a great night sleep.
Life is good.

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650341,"About 7 miles of our 10 mile hike today was uphill. We started out at the stealth site near Standing Bear Farm at 1835’ and ended the day at Brown Gap Spring tent site at 3503’.  Maybe we should have done what one of my hiking friends suggested. He suggested that I slack pack from Max patch back to the Hostel (North to South) and avoid that crazy climb out of standing bear. Just in case you are not aware of what slack packing is, it usually entails someone dropping you off at a trail head somewhere in the morning and also picking you up in the evening and therefore you only have to carry in your pack what you need for the day, making it much lighter.


As far as I know, regardless of what the fellow at Brunswick Landing Marina says, the only requirement for your hike to being considered a thru hike is that you hike the entire trail in a consecutive one year period of time.  It does not matter what you carry, where you stay at night, what direction you hike in or in what order you hike the trail.  If you hike the entire Appalachian Trail in any manner in a one year period of time you are a thru hiker. And that is one hell of an accomplishment.


Now, that being said, I am more of a purist. I have decided that I want to hike the entire trail in a South to North direction and not slack pack at any time. Now I know a lot of my fellow hikers are saying, “Hey Trawler, HYOH (Hike Your Own Hike)”. That’s what I’m doing. You do the same.


After being with so many hikers every night since we entered the Smokies back on April 21, it is really good to be at the tent site tonight with only two other hikers and they are both section hikers.  Walkeen is from Dallas and will probably be here on the trail about 10 more days. He is retired from Honeywell.  Jeff is a Baptist Pastor and is hiking to Hot Springs. We had a great conversation with Jeff before turning in shortly after hikers midnight (7pm).


Unfortunately, I do not have any signal and will not be able to post this until tomorrow. Tomorrow is our 37th wedding anniversary and I believe this is the first time that we have been apart on our anniversary. I miss you babe.","Stealth Site

We realized while boiling water for dinner last night that we are running very low on fuel. In order to save on fuel this morning we decided to have a pop tart instead of boiling water for oatmeal.


We discussed with Jeff our plans for the day and we decided to meet up at Catpen Gap.  Max Patch was a 3 1/2 mile climb away. Max Patch is a very large bald area with gorgeous 360° views.  When we got to the top of Max Patch the wind was blowing extremely hard and the fog totally blocked any view that we would have otherwise had.


We stopped for a break shortly after Max Patch and Walkeen join us a few minutes later.  He told us that Jeff had injured his knee and was probably getting off at the parking lot. We were sorry to hear that. I really would have liked to have spent more time with Jeff. I pray that he has a speedy recovery and can get back on the trail soon. It was very obvious how much he enjoys the trail and being in nature. Godspeed Jeff.


It rained off and on all morning and cleared up very nice in the afternoon. We were the first ones at the tent site and set up our hammocks and tarps in the wind. There is a 0% chance of rain tonight but we are not taking any chance and have the tarp up and in place.


After we got set up, Crowba, Hitch and Driftwood all passed by the tent site and were going on further today.

We stopped at Laughing Heart Hostel to check out available accommodations. It is located within sight of the AT.  There were no available bunks but we were able to set up our hammocks on their property for $15 and for an additional five dollars do our laundry. That also gave us access to showers and a kitchen.


We walked into Smokey Mountain Diner and each  had a burger for a late lunch. Afterwords we walked back to the hostel. The hostel  is very busy with every bunk full and many tents and hammocks set up on the property. There are picnic tables and a fire ring  for socializing.


Little Moon, Wink, Sidequest & Guardian arrived about 5 pm.  We weren’t sure if they were ahead or behind us because last time we saw them they were talking about doing a night hike and we thought they may have passed us during the night.  Tinker and I have not hiked at night yet, but may give it a try when it gets really hot.

The forecast for today was not good to say the least. The forecast called for rain off and on all day with a chance of thunderstorms and a tornado warning in the afternoon and the evening.


We decided that it would be best to take a zero in Hot Springs and started our search for a place to stay. We tried several places and were not able to find any availability. We checked back with the hostel and was able to get a room for the night.


So, an unplanned zero. Tomorrow is calling for rain almost all day. We do plan to head out if there are no thunderstorms or tornado watches or warnings in the forecast.  There is a saying on the trail, “no rain, no Maine “, but we certainly do not want to do anything unsafe.

Lone Wolf and Syrup hit the trail before we did.  I am not sure how Lone Wolf got her name, she is very sociable to other hikers, however she is always hiking alone.  Syrup carries a small jug of maple syrup on the outside of his pack.


We stopped for a lunch break at Log Cabin Drive. We chatted with three section hikers from Alabama. They are in their late 60s and are here on a three night section hike.  Tinker and I both bought new high quality water bladders while at Hot Springs.  I was taking mine out of my backpack to fill my water bottle and the end came off spilling all of my water. I looked at my water bottle and I had about 5 ounces. We were about to begin a 5 mile uphill climb and the next water on the guide was about 3 miles away.


As we began making the climb I was thinking how I could ration my water to make it last. Thankfully it was not that hot and I was not in any danger. About a half mile in the climb I heard a little trickle of water and looked over and saw a very small stream coming out of the side of the hill. The Lord provides.


We came to a trail junction where the white blaze Trail was an exposed ridge line  trail or you could take a blue blaze trail that was a bad whether trail. We decided that we were not planning on taking any blue blaze trails and beside the weather was good so we took the exposed ridge line trail. It was a very interesting very difficult up and down rock climb. We were glad we took it because there were several good views.


We arrived at Jerry’s Cabin Shelter just before 7 PM. The shelter was full and also there were lots of tents and a few hammocks set up around it. At 15.9 miles this was our longest day so far and also we hit another milestone. We have now gone 300 miles!","Spring Mountain Shelter

After eating and packing up our soaking wet stuff we marched out in the fog until we climbed above it. Then it was absolutely gorgeous views of seeing the fog settle down in the valleys and the mountain tops peeking through with sunshine on them.


We stopped at Flint Mountain Shelter for lunch.  Syrup, Lone Wolf & Hummingbird we’re there.
We dried out our gear by setting up the hammocks and laying our quilts out on the tin roof of the shelter.  I tore a hole in my underquilt on the tin roof and feather started flying everywhere. I quickly fixed it with gorilla tape.  I also made a zipper repair on my hammock also using gorilla tape.


When we arrived at Devils Fork Gap there were four hikers relaxing in the ditch next to the road. We joined them and quickly overheard them talking about trail magic that was about to happen.   A few minutes later Scottsman, a thru hiker last year, showed up with fruit, sodas and started his charcoal grill and made  cheeseburgers for everyone.  Thank you very much Scottsman.


We finished the day with a 3 mile climb from about 2900’ to 4600’.  Tinker found us a beautiful stealth site with a view.  There were a lot of bugs bothering us when we arrived but we made a campfire and they went away.  We cooked and were in the hammocks just before sunset.


We are planning on getting up before sunrise in the morning because it should be a beautiful one over the mountains to the east.

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650792,"I was already awake but still laying in my hammock when Tinker’s alarm went off at 6:15 so that we could catch the 6:29 sunrise.  The meteorologist were right. It did not rain last night and there was not even any dew.


After watching the sunrise and then having our now usual pop tarts and coffee we were on the trail shortly after eight. We had just over 5 miles to go to get to Sam’s Gap where Amy from Natures Inn Hostel was to pick us up. Tawnya has shipped us a re-supply box to the hostel.  I did not think we would have cell service at the gap so I texted Amy  and told her we would be there at 11.  She said we should have cell service and just to text her when we got there.


We stopped at Hogback Ridge shelter for a morning break and to get much needed water.  The shelter was a 10th of a mile off the trail and it was another quarter of a mile down to the water source. So it was a half mile walk to and from the shelter to get our water.  It made me think how we take simple things like that for granted. At home I would just walk across the room to the sink and open up the tap and get all the water I needed.  I am just thankful that it has been available to us on the trail.


Tinker and I arrived at Sam’s gap at 10:57 and Amy was waiting in the van. She had just drop someone off at the gap and was waiting for us to arrive. Amy runs the Hostel for her brother and does a fabulous job. It was a really nice place to stay. Our cabin was on a creek that we were able to listen to all night long.


Little Moon, Sidequest and Mulligan arrived about 5 PM.  Wink had decided to get off the trail and go to a different hostel.   Scotsman  was also there and we arranged with him for a ride from the trail to trail days in Damascus, VA on Saturday.  After doing the laundry and socializing with the other hikers there, it was off to an early bedtime.  The first shuttle back to the trail is at 8 o’clock in the morning and we plan on being on it.","Stealth Site

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650858,"I heated up a Jimmy Dean’s sausage egg and cheese biscuit in the microwave at the hostel.  It was still not home cooking but it was an upgrade from the usual pop tarts.


Amy was right on time pulling the shuttle out of the driveway of the hostel at 8 AM and had us back to Sam’s Gap about five minutes after eight. We went from 3720’ at the gap to 5518’ on top of Big Bald over a distance of just over 6 miles.  It was an absolutely gorgeous day and we had a beautiful 360° view of the mountains.  We sat on the bald and ate lunch taking in the view.


Shortly after coming down from the top we came across Lauren & Warren.  They had driven from their home in Asheville, North Carolina to provide trail magic.  Even though we had just had lunch we enjoyed some fresh watermelon and cantaloupe. They also provided us with some Gatorade powder packets to carry with us.  Thanks Lauren and Warren that was really nice.


Even though the weather was absolutely gorgeous we did not see a lot of other hikers.  We did leap frog with one other hiker who also journals on trail journals.  I do not know his trail name but he uses his last name, Spiegal, on trail journals.


We ended the day after several ups and downs at 3865’ at a very nice stealth site.","Nature’s Inn Hostel

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650938,"We slept in a little bit this morning. We didn’t roll out of the hammocks until about 7:30.  Yesterday was a pretty hard day and I guess we needed the extra rest.  Several hikers went by our stealth site as we were eating breakfast and packing up. We were still able to hit the trail before 9 o’clock.


The first part of our hike today was much easier than it has been up to this point. We were able to get over 7 miles in by 12 noon. While we were eating lunch Mayflower and Roadrunner went by. We had seen them at the hostel but did not know their names until today.


After lunch we had a fairly easy mostly downhill 3 mile hike into Uncle Johnny’s Hostel.  We loaded up on soda and sweets before crossing the Nolichucky River and heading back into the mountains.  I had a root beer and a Coca-Cola and a Oreo ice cream sandwich. Mayflower was there going through a resupply she had received from her husband. Roadrunner was waiting on a shuttle to go into Damascus, Virginia for trail days.


After loading up on the sweets it made an interesting four mile climb to Curley Maple Gap Shelter.  We went from 1675’ to 3050’ and a few times I was doubting the wisdom of loading up on the soda and ice cream. I also forgot to mention that I had a Snickers Bar while at Uncle Johnny’s.


We arrived at the shelter at 5:15 PM and there was no one there. We were thinking that everyone must’ve already gone to trail days.  After we had finished with dinner Chilly, Smiles, Mayflower & Sunshine got to the shelter.  I overheard Chilly say to Tinker, “Is that your old man?  I remember you saying at the hostel that you were hiking with him”.  Not father, not dad, not daddy but old man. Oh well, I guess if the shoe fits.


One of things that I really wanted to accomplish on this adventure was to be able to find answers to some questions that have befuddled me for a long time.  One of those is, “ does a wild bear s&@t in the woods?”.  I have not totally found the answer to that but based on the amount of bear scat that was on the trail today there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that would lead one to believe that they do.  Hopefully I will get to see a bear soon and if I was lucky enough to catch it  in the act of depositing that scat that would be a home run.


With that question almost answered maybe I will turn my attention to one that is for more important.  Why does God love me?  There is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that He does in fact love me.  I’m just struggling to find any reason why he would. Any help from my journal readers would be greatly appreciated. You can leave your comment for me on my guestbook.

Just as we were hitting the trail a little before 9 AM Stick came through and was just ahead of us. He is from England.  His real name is Duncan but he got his trail name because he broke one of his tent poles early on and each night starts looking for an appropriate sized stick just before he gets to camp to use each night.


We had a pretty tough hike today as the first 10 miles was mostly uphill and we went from an elevation of 3064’ to  5183’.  We leapfrogged Stick and Mayflower most of the day.  Scotsman texted me and let me know that he had been in an automobile accident and would not be able to pick us up tomorrow morning to take us to Damascus for trail days. Thankfully he just sustained a broken arm and no serious injuries.  Tinker was able to find us another shuttle to take tomorrow instead.  Sasha is scheduled to pick us up at nine in the morning.


We saw our first rattlesnake today. We were coming up Unaka Mountain and I saw it out of the corner of my eye and was able to stop about 2 feet from it.  It was about 3 1/2 to 4 feet long and had nine rattlers and a button.

We then waited the 20 minutes for her to arrive right at 9 o’clock.  The 53 mile ride into Damascus took us a little over an hour.


Trail days is a huge event for the small town of Damascus, Virginia. We did not make any reservations and were confident that there would be no room in the inn so we made our way to tent city where for five dollars we could set up our hammocks among hundreds if not thousands of other tents and hammocks in a ball field or the woods adjacent to it.  As soon as we entered the woods we saw Little Moon, Guardian and SideQuest.  We set up our hammocks and tarps next to them.


We marched in the parade with thousands of other hikers and were wet down by water guns from the spectators as we went by.  We went to the huge campfire festivities in the late evening and early night.  I was in my hammock by 10 PM and could hear the festivities going on until about 4 o’clock in the morning.


Many churches and other organizations provided food, showers and laundry services to the hikers. We took advantage of the showers from first Baptist Church of Sevierville, TN but were too late to get our laundry done.


I bought smaller and lighter backpacks from one of the vendors for Tinker and myself and we left the old packs and a lot of our winter gear at the bed and breakfast where we will be staying next weekend when Tawnya & Irene comes.","Cherry Gap Shelter

After breakfast and slowly packing our stuff up Tinker and I walk approximately 2 miles to the grocery store to resupply.
By the time we walked the 2 miles back and got everything squared away in our pack it was lunchtime. We got some good Mexican food off of the food truck and headed to One Way Ministries where we were on the list for a shuttle back to the trail.


It was after 4 PM when the shuttle dropped us off at Iron Mountain Gap so we decided to just hike to the first stealth site and call it a day.  When we arrived at the stealth site they were already six tents set up and also a large pavilion type tent. Turns out that it is a group of volunteers that are doing work on the trail and they have been here for three nights doing some trail maintenance.


One of the volunteers, Rise, thru hiked the trail in 2015.  He was very friendly and informative and told us that he has just gotten a book of poetry published. The majority of the poetry is about his experience on the Appalachian Trail.


While we were getting ready to cook dinner Tinker advised me that we had failed to buy fuel while we were in Damascus. We have less than a canister so we are going to have to get off the trail soon to get some more fuel.  Pasta and instant potatoes will hydrate with cold water but I still prefer mine hot.


We have set a goal to get to Watauga  Lake  at mile 430 by Friday to meet Tawnya. I am really looking forward to seeing her and spending some time with her.","Iron Mountain Gap / Damascus

One of the prizes she won was an inflatable pillow and since she already had one she gave it 
to me. Thanks Mulligan.  I sure slept good last night.


When we finally hit the trail about 8:30 all of the volunteers had left camp to go work on the trail.  We came up on them after about a mile and a half.  The AT is maintained by I think it is 21 Trail clubs from Georgia to Maine.  They do an excellent job keeping the trail in good condition so folks such as myself can enjoy it.  Thanks guys for all you do it is really incredible.


Where are all the thru hikers today?  When we sat down for lunch we had seen two SOBO (South Bound) section hikers and absolutely no NOBOs (North Bound).  Finally after about 10 miles into our hike we were passed by our first NOBO today.  He ended up being the only thru hiker we saw all day long.

One interesting thing about hiking the balds is that you can see what is ahead of you for a very long distance.  The last bald of the day was Hump Mountain.  We could see it from a distance and it appeared to be a long hard climb and it turned out to be just that.  We took some pictures at the top of each of the balds that do not in anyway do justice to the actual views. I think that is something you’ll just have to experience for yourself.


We reached one big milestone today. For the longest time we have been going in and out of North Carolina and Tennessee because we are hiking right along the border.  Today we finally left North Carolina for good and are totally in Tennessee. Two states down 12 to go.


Tonight we are sharing a campsite with two fathers and their sons that are out section hiking. There are three boys. We invited ourselves over to their camp fire and it was neat to see how interesting our experiences as thru  hikers are to others. I hope it is to you as well.

As we were breaking camp, Tinker said that he saw a light after dark and a flash of someone taking a picture of the leaving North Carolina sign.  We were the last ones to leave camp. On the 3 mile hike down to Highway 19 we passed the two men and the three boys.


There is a hostel, The Station at 19 E, 1/2 mile away from where the trail crosses the highway. We needed to get fuel so we planned on going there.  Bob and ME were also going to the hostile.  We hiked a little faster than usual thinking that if we could catch them we could share a shuttle the half mile to the hostel.  We never caught them but just as we got to the highway the owner of the hostel pulled up in his van and gave us a run to the hostile.  He was on the way back from shuttling another hiker to another trailhead.  On the way we passed Bob and ME hiking uphill to the hostel.


When we got to the hostel we were treated to a free breakfast of pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits and gravy.  We later learned that on their website there is a link for people to donate money just for hikers. Apparently they had a lot of funds they had to use.


Walmart was already there when we arrived. He was the one that had arrived after dark and unknown to us had set up his tent after dark and left before we got up because he knew about the free breakfast.  Bob and ME were also able to get their breakfast.  Walmart got his trail name because he showed up to thru hike with gear all from Walmart.  ME’s name is Emmy and she is headed to Maine (ME). Bob probably got his name from his mom and dad.


After breakfast and the resupply we got back on the trail.  During the hike we took a short 1/10 of a mile side trail to Jones Fall.  It was a very beautiful waterfall. We went to the top and got wet to cool off.

He has had it for the last 26 years and he suggests a donation of five dollars to stay there which includes a trip to town, laundry, kitchen and a bunk to sleep in.  So we set out on our longest hike to date.


We leapfrogged Freebird & his dog  Mogel several times during the morning but did not see them after lunch.  We continue to see very few thru  hikers for some reason.


When we arrived at Kincora , Crossroads was the only hiker there.  We last saw him at Newfound Gap. He is from Ohio.


We changed into loaner clothes and gave Bob our dirty clothes to wash. At 5 o’clock we left to go into town to the grocery store. We did not need to resupply so we just bought food to prepare dinner and breakfast tomorrow morning.


Shortly after we got back from the store, Dr. Kip Riddick,  a theology professor from Christopher Newport University, known on the trail as “Hippie Kippie” arrived with a group of his students.  His daughter,  Dr. Caroline Riddick was also with them.  He brings his class out on the Appalachian Trail to examine their selves and their relationship with God and to experience nature. He also takes them on the Camino Santiago Trail and has been doing so for over 20 years.


It was a really neat experience to hear the discussion about all of the hiking experience all over the world from these folks. We are certainly glad we stopped here.

He was slack packing and his mom was carrying his pack on ahead.  His dad was hiking this section of the trail.


Our hike today is only a little over 8 miles but it’s a huge day. Tawnya is meeting us at Watauga lake and we are going to stay at Dancing Bear Inn in Damascus, Virginia for the weekend.  Irene is coming up later in the evening also.

We did pick Sky King and Golden Goddess up at Lady Di’s bed and breakfast and took them to dinner at 7 trails.  I was finally able to buy Sky King the pizza that I have owed him since Neels Gap in Georgia.

We had a lot of rain over the last two days and it was raining as we were hiking yesterday. A lot of the day we were hiking in ankle deep water or deeper.  I slipped and fell with my left ankle twisted up underneath me and broke my fibula bone.  At this point I don’t have any idea how long the recovery will be. I am scheduled to see an orthopedic surgeon Tuesday morning.


I was extremely blessed by where it happened. We were less than 1/ 10th of a mile from a highway where we were able to get a shuttle to the hospital in Marion, Virginia fairly easily. There are times on the trail that we are miles away from a road crossing and it would’ve been awful trying to get there with a broken leg.  1/10th of a mile was hard enough.  It is so comforting to know that even in tough times the Lord is there watching over us and taking care of us.

On Saturday May28th,  Tawnya and Irene came to Marion, VA and picked us up outside Walmart where we were patiently awaiting their arrival.  We had checked out of the motel around 11 and were homeless till they arrived.  I rode around the store on a motorized shopping cart and quickly learned that almost all displays are on wheels and that makes them much easier to negotiate.


We spent the next two nights in a motel not being in a hurry because my appointment with Dr. Sullivan in Brunswick, Ga was not until Tuesday morning. 


At the appointment they did additional x-rays and discovered that the break was far from being a clean break. The fibula had splintered several inches up from where the total break was.  He informed me that I had two possible recovery times ahead of me. If he only had to put in a plate I would be nonweightbearing for six weeks if he had to put in screws to connect the tibia and the fibula it would require three months nonweightbearing.  I put out a prayer request to some of my closest friends, who would know how to word this with the Lord, that my prayer was that I did not get screwed. I was hoping to have surgery the next day or the day after and was disappointed when he informed me that he could not do the surgery until the following Monday because we had to get the swelling down.


The surgery on Monday the sixth was a success although he told me later at a follow up appointment on Friday that I had broken my bone differently than the way most people do it. I told him I do most things in life differently than other folks. He said it was extremely difficult to get the plate in place because the plate is shaped in such a manner for the “usual” type of break.  I ended up with an 8 inch incision on the outside of my leg. But the really good news was that I did not get screwed.  He did say at the follow up appointment that it appeared to be progressing very well.


I will readily admit that I’ve been somewhat depressed since this accident happened and have been trying to figure out why. But I am also extremely blessed to have the wonderful friends and family lift up your prayers and support and encourage to me.  Tawnya laid it on me just this morning that she wants to go with me and hike some with me when I return my journey.  I realize now that I will not be able to finish my hike the way I had planned this year in a south to north trip and I am trying to formulate a plan of how best to continue my trip that will also give me the most miles of the trail this year.


I again want to thank all of you for your prayers and support and encouragement and especially give a shout out to the friends of mine at Brunswick Landing Marina who have made me a temporary ramp out of plywood and screwed it to the dock to make it easier for me to get on and off the boat as well as helping me to get to the top of the dock on several occasions.


Please remember Tawnya in your prayers. I can tell that this is extremely hard on her even though I am trying to make her taking care of me as easy as possible.


And yes please remember Tinker also.  He is still out there and from what I can tell from here doing well and having a good time.","Marion, VA

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658531,"After 129 days off of the trail to have surgery and recover, Tawnya and I drove from Brunswick, Georgia to Elk Garden, Virginia to hit the trail again.


We hiked from the parking lot the short 1/10th of a mile south to the exact spot where I fell on May 27th and unofficially named it “TRAWLER FALLS”.  Thanks Kent Kraft for supplying the sign.
Just as I was driving the stake into the ground, Southbound thru hikers Seeker, Back to Back, and Just Ben stopped and we shared our story with them. Just Ben was kind enough to take a couple of pictures of Tawnya and I with the newly erected sign.


After the short hike back to the parking lot Tawnya and I drove to our motel for the night in Wytheville, Virginia. We plan to hike for two or three nights starting in the morning.


It was bittersweet returning to the location where I fell. It brought back a lot of memories and I just had to return to get that last step out of my head. We’re planning for a leisurely hike the next few days check out our journal.


Godspeed!","Elk Garden Gap

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658570,"After a good nights rest at the Sleep Inn in Wytheville, Virginia we drove to the overnight backpackers parking lot at Grayson Highlands State Park. It was a little more expensive than we had anticipated. They charged us $15 per night for three nights plus  $5 dollar service fee.


We took the .7 of a mile Appalachian spur Trail from the parking lot to the Appalachian Trail and headed south at mile marker 502.8.  The terrain was different than I had experienced on the trail up to this point. There were a lot of bald areas and rock outcroppings. We also saw 16 feral horses during our hike today.  We were able to make it through fat man’s squeeze without having to take our backpacks off.


There were a lot of hikers on the trail today. Most of them were day hikers but we did meet up with a couple of south bound through hiker. Just before we arrived at Thomas knob shelter for the evening, we came across a couple of day hikers and their dog. They do a lot of Trail magic and during the conversation we realized that Tinker and I had gotten some trail magic from them earlier in the year. It was really good to see them again.


We ended up going 3.7 miles on the trail today. That combined with the Appalachian spur Trail from the parking lot, we went 4.4 miles today. Not bad for our first day back on the trail.  I did wear my ankle brace and my ankle held up well.



The weather is definitely colder up here than it is in Brunswick, Georgia. We have hunker down in our hammocks for the night and hopefully it will be a warm one.","Grayson Highlands SP LT Parking

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658603,"The wind howled all night long. Neither one of us slept as well as we do at home in our bed but we were able to get some sleep. It was 38° when we woke up this morning but we were both very comfortably warm in our hammocks.
After a breakfast of pop tarts and coffee we packed up and were on the trail before 9 AM.  3/10 of a mile into our hike we came to a blue blaze trail that leads to Mount Rogers.  Mount Rogers is the highest elevation in Virginia at 5729’.  Although it is covered in dense forest and there are no views it was well worth the hike up to say that we had climbed the highest peak in Virginia.


When we stopped for lunch at approximately 12 noon we had not seen another hiker all day.  After lunch we saw several hikers heading northbound most of them appeared to be day hikers.


On the way down to the parking lot at Elk Garden we met day hikers Deborah and Michael and their dog Bear. Bear raced a head of them to greet us and they told us that they had learned not to call him by name when they were in the woods with other people around because it caused a lot of fear.  We told them that we were planning to get a shuttle from the parking lot to another trail head to walk back to our car. They were very gracious to offer us a ride after their short hike and did so later that afternoon.  While at Elk Garden we took the short 1/10 of a mile trip south to check on the sign that we had erected two days ago. Thankfully it was still there.


After swapping some stories with Deborah and Michael and Bear and  after saying our goodbyes we took a short 1/10 of a mile hike to a stealth camping site near Fox Creek.  After we had already started setting up camp I noticed a sign that had been posted in May 2019 that recommended against camping here because of bear activity.  We discussed our options which were hiking on an additional 1.7 miles up an elevation about 1000 feet, calling a shuttle to take us to a motel, or staying here for the night.  We decided to stay for the night. Hope it was a wise decision.


We hiked 4.5 miles on the AT today with an additional 1 mile on the blue blaze up to and back down from Mount Rogers.  5.5 miles is very acceptable after recovering from an injury and being out here for only our second day.","Stealth Site near Thomas Knob Shelter

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658639,"No bears last night.  It was a lot less windy that it was night before last and we woke up with our food bag still hanging and undisturbed.


Today will be our hardest hike of the four days.  The first 3.2 miles of the day we go up almost 1500 feet in elevation.  On the way up we were passed by Jim Hayes, Delmar and his dog Charlie.  Jim has a YouTube channel and he and Delmer and Charlie do a lot of section hiking. Charlie is a Chihuahua and has hiked over 1000 miles.  


During the hike Tawnya mentioned that she hoped there would be some trail magic along the way today. I told her not to count on it.  When we arrived at The Scales in the early afternoon Zipper and his dog Squirt  had a folding table with Gatorade and chocolate chip cookies set up for hikers.  They were there for two nights in Zipper’s pick up truck and he invited us over for fully loaded fire pit cooked baked potatoes for the evening meal.  Guess I was wrong again.  Thanks Zipper and Squirt for a wonderful evening.


The scales is a bald area where local ranchers meet to weigh their cattle. Previously they weighed them after they took the long trip down the mountain and found out that they weighed less. They still carry out that practice until this day. There is a privy and a bear box to store food overnight inside the corral.


Because of it being a bald area inside of a corral we were hard-pressed to find somewhere to hang our hammocks. Finally we found a couple of suitable trees just inside the fence.  We went to sleep on a very beautiful evening listening to the cows mooing.  Life just doesn’t get any better than this.","Fox Creek VA630

Trawler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658659,"I checked the forecast with my Garman in reach yesterday afternoon when we set up camp. There was a 0% chance of rain so I decided not to put up the rain fly.  When we woke up this morning that turned out to be a good decision even though it has not worked out so well in the past. The temperature this morning was noticeably higher and we were very comfortable when we got out of the hammocks to get going.


We sat down to a breakfast of oatmeal and coffee. I made the mistake of putting too much water in the oatmeal and we had oatmeal soup instead of oatmeal. I really should leave the cooking to Tawnya.


The weather on this short hiking trip has been exceptional and today is another wonderful beautiful sunshiny day. The sky is blue and the temperature is a high in the low to mid 50s.


There was not a lot in the way of sites or views to look at today as we made our final hike toward our car back at Grayson Highland State Park.


We stopped at Wise shelter in the park for lunch. We shared a large pouch of tuna with mayonnaise and hot sauce and a couple of snacks.  While I we were there I checked the logbook in the shelter and found this entry from May 30, “Tinker stopped by for a break”.


It was May the 30th when  I stood on crutches with a splinted broken leg prior to surgery at Elk Garden parking lot and watched Tinker continue on the trail.  Seeing that entry was a fitting end to a emotional return to the trail.


We reached the Appalachian Spur Trail early in the afternoon and took the 8/10 of a mile trip back to our car in the long-term parking lot at Grayson Highlands State Park.


I want to give a shout out to Dr. Michael Sullivan whose excellent surgery skills made it possible for me to return to the trail after four months.


I am especially thankful for my wife, Tawnya, and her willingness to come to the trail with me and give it a try.  You are a real camper.


One thing I learned for sure from this return to the trail is that we have a lot of hiking in our future and that the call of the trail is loud and clear.","The Scales
