Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647399,"Getting ready to try another hike.
With so many relatives wanting to join me, it's a lot of work to figure out where I might be at a given time, & what's the best way to get them there.
We still have a foot of snow here in Northern Wisconsin, which is unlikely to be melting the next 2 weeks; but if there is any snow in Maryland, 50-60 degree temperatures should take care of it before I get there.

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647770,"About 4 more inches of snow today, but it won't last long, & I'll be leaving soon anyway.I spent some time getting my gear ready.  I think I have everything I need, & I've done this enough times that it shouldn't take much last-minute effort.I still have arrangements to make for shuttles & mail drops.  Only a week to go!",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Wed",0
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650782,"Since I have to leave so early tomorrow morning, & Susan is coming home late from a trip to the Caribbean with a daughter & granddaughter, we agreed to meet at a motel in Wausau.I ended up not being as organized as I thought, so I dumped a bunch of stuff in my truck & sorted after I got to the motel.  I wasn't done with that till she arrived around 2:00 am.Unfortunately, we didn't have much chance to visit before getting some sleep to prepare for an early departure in the morning.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Tue",0
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650783,"It's about a 3-hour drive to Milwaukee, but the bus contracted to AMTRAK takes more than 5 hours; so I had to be at the bus station in Wausau at 7:15.  After all my sorting last night, I still had too much to carry on the trail — I'll have to mail some of it ahead when I get to Harpers Ferry.  [Actually, one bag with some food got left in my truck by mistake. When I got home in June, I discovered that the cheese had some mold, but seemed edible, the jelly had fermented, but the Peanut butter seemed OK.]
Not very many people on the bus, so I got to sit with my pack & a couple of bags instead of having to put some underneath.  It still wasn't a good situation for doing any more sorting, & besides, I wanted to get some sleep on the bus.  Not much wait time in Milwaukee to get the train to Chicago, then several hours there.  One man sitting near me wanted to talk abut his military service.  Another walked by &, seeing my backpack, told me he has done a thru-hike several years ago.  It's sometimes amazing to be reminded how many people have.At a large station like this, there seems to always be some doubt as to which track a train will be going out on.  While I was trying to find out, quite a line formed.  I had learned that people with roomettes go to the head of the line, so I did. I was comfortably in my little space before very many others were even walking toward their car.  Not only did I feel safer from COVID, but I had space to do the sorting I still had to do. I like taking the train, even tho it takes longer than a plane.  The seats are more comfortable, & you can get up & walk around more freely. I slept thru a number of stops in the dark, including Cleveland [Like Spokane & Oakland, AMTRAK always goes thru Cleveland at night].",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Wed",0
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650785,"I guess I slept thru the stop in Pittsburg, where they split the train, my part going to D.C. & the other to New York by way of Philadelphia.  Anyway, I awoke in time to get a good breakfast & get my excess stuff boxed up for mailing. I soon learned, however, that we would be 2 hours late for Harpers Ferry.  I had to text my shuttle driver to let him know I'd be late. Actually, the delay got me an extra meal on the train!
It was after 1:30 when we got there, & everything seemed very rushed — the train barely stopped.  I was the only one getting off at Harper's Ferry.  I got off with everything but my wooden hiking pole.  Too bad, but I can get another one once I get into the woods. My next project was to walk up the long, steep hill to the post office, with my over-loaded pack & two boxes. I tried to stop at the ATC HQ to register, but they were closed.  The sign said to register on-line, but I couldn't figure out how to do so for my ""flip-flop-flip"" plan. The packages were going far enough that I didn't need priority mail.  One was self-sealing, but the other needed tape.  Post office tape is only for priority mail, unless I wanted to BUY a whole roll of over-priced tape & then have to figure out what to do with it [Yes, I'm too cheap to just throw it away!].  I walked back to the ATC, where my shuttle was awaiting me.  He had some duct tape & was kind enough to stop at another P.O. along the way.
It took a while to get up to Pennsylvania Route 16.  We'd been traveling mostly on the West side of the Mtns, but toward the end we crossed over & approached the trailhead from the East. That confused me, so I started hiking in the wrong direction [also distracted by looking for a suitable pole].  It didn't take long to realize that the sun was in the wrong place, & I needed to turn around.  Great start!
Pretty easy Trail down to Pen Mar, even tho my pack felt heavy. I did take pictures of a few dead-falls along the way.  I'll send them to the maintainer for this segment. A little rain started around the state line.  I had hoped to stop at the Pen Mar pavilion for a snack, & to enjoy the view; but the wind made that very uncomfortable, & dark clouds diminished the view. So I moved on.  The rain stopped soon enough, followed by off-&-on sunshine, as the daylight gradually faded.  After a piece on an old road, the Trail got down among the rocks & then started up thru more rocks. By the time I got up to the top, near High Rock, I thought I had a little bit of daylight, but it went fast. 
The last 2 miles were pretty level & in the dark.  Raven Rocks Shelter is one of the pretty, new ones [replacing the old Devil's Racecourse Shelter, I believe], 2 levels, with various colors of wood.  Wood that is very noisy when trying to unpack in the dark when other hikers are already bedded down.  There were 4: a father-daughter combo plus a flip=flopping couple who had started in Harper's Ferry a few days ago.
I got to sleep pretty fast.  It felt good to finally be out on the Trail again.","Pa. Rt. 16, near Waynesboro
",Raven Rocks Shelter,"Mar 31, Thu",7.50
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650787,"I was the first one out of the shelter in the morning, tho everyone was up. No one going my way. I did meet a few hikers in the first 5 miles, coming from Ensign Cowall Shelter.
Down past the lookout at Raven Rocks, then ups & downs thru open woods with no leaves: a great day to be hiking.  Warm while hiking, yet when I got to the shelter there was a cool wind blowing right into it; so I didn't stay long [ I remember a cold night there almost exactly 6 years ago — I think the shelter just faces the wrong direction].  As I left, an Outward Bound group arrived; it might soon have felt crowded. From there, the Trail continues along the escarpment, mostly a smooth, level, former roadway, with enough rocky spots to impress on hikers the fact that Pennsylvania doesn't have a monopoly.
Well, it's April fools Day!  I should have expected some weird weather.  4 or 5 times, I had snow!  It would come during the sunshine, blanket the ground for 5-10 minutes, then be gone in another 5. I'd rather have that than rain; nothing much got wet. This was not flaky snow but what I called ""granulated snow"" & others called ""micro-hail"": tiny white balls that were more entertaining than troublesome.
When I got to Pogo Memorial Campground, I spoke briefly with a local day-hiker, who told me about growing up with ""Pogo"" Rheinheimer, a member of the trail club who died quite young about 50 years ago.
Pretty uneventful Trail from there to Pine Knob Shelter, where I arrived in full daylight.  It's an old log shelter [older than I am!!]. I never did find out how many guys were in there, because they had a plastic tarp over the entrance — another shelter built facing the prevailing wind.  It seemed full enough, & I didn't like their music, so I camped in a space nearby.  A couple of women were camped a short ways beyond me & some other people 0.1 farther down.  It was getting cool as I fixed & ate my supper. Then around dusk a Boy Scout troop came in & filled most of the remaining space.  They were well-behaved, quieter than the guys in the shelter.  No moon.","Raven Rocks Shelter
",Pine Knob Shelter,"Apr 01, Fri",13.10
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650788,"First one out again.  A bit cool this morning, but I hiked in my shorts again anyway.  Just a short distance to the foot-bridge over I-70, then between some people's yards before getting into the woods again.  Only a few more miles to Washington Monument State Park, the first monument to the first president, built by local groups decades before the one in D.C.  Of course, I had to climb up the stone steps [stiff as my legs were], tho the view wasn't so great today. Besides, the views of farmed fields of Maryland & Pennsylvania all begin to look the same anyway. This being Saturday, there ware lots of visitors to the park today, & I got to take the picture of one large family group. One note about this park: it has electrical outlets in the picnic pavilion.
From here to the Potomac, it is generally downhill, altho I feel I'm noticing the rocks more than on previous trips.  There are a couple of state parks & monuments, plus a lot of Civil War monuments.  The passes over this Mtn were hotly contested ground, especially leading up to the Battle of Antietam.  Lots of interesting stuff, but I've read most of it before.  Gathland State Park, with the war correspondents' monument, is also interesting, at least the first time.
Dahlgren Campground is a good place to stop for lunch.  It even has showers, if you need one. There were lots of people going by, including a group training for some event.  ""Old Blue"" was sitting there talking about his thru-hike a few years ago.  He lives in this area & just keeps coming back to the Trail.  Others I met on the Trail included ""Mr. Bone"",""Chip & Dale"", ""Mr. Blue"",                           This afternoon, I saw my first wildflowers: cut-leaf toothwort.
10 more miles got me to the end of a long day, at Ed Garvey Shelter, a new structure with two stories & imaginative design.  Ed was the person who measured & blazed most of the original AT in the 1930s. It's high time to have a shelter named after him, & the location is great for thru-hikers, since accommodations in Harpers Ferry are inadequate; however, it's far too convenient for week-enders.  And this was a Saturday night. There was a Girl Scout group occupying the shelter & about 40 tents to the North & South; so I set up mine as well. Nobody bothered me, & after a long day, I slept well.","Pine Knob Shelter
",Ed Garvey Shelter,"Apr 02, Sat",17.40
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650790,"I had been concerned last night about smoke from the Girl Scouts' campfire.  The leaders had kept it going long after the girls were in the shelter, but the smoke didn't come my way, & they were up bright & early getting breakfast about the time I was ready to leave.  
Easy Trail most of the morning; yet I remembered an easier downhill after the Potomac River over-look at Weverton Cliffs, & this time those switch-backs seemed harder. I met several people coming up who were just starting their flip-flop hikes, coming North out of Harper's Ferry.  Very few SOBO backpackers [I hadn't seen any in the past 2 days].  One shirtless young man passed me twice going down the Mtn.  He must have stopped somewhere along the way. Just as I got to the tow-path, I met a NOBO named Jedi —proud of having done 3 miles already!  Hope she makes it.
Lots of day-hikers, & their dogs, on the towpath.  Also bicycles to look out for.  A lot of people going faster than I.  Several trains passed too — it's a busy line. Nevertheless, AMTRAK seemed to be on time today. I also passed by below the youth Hostel in Knoxville.  It used to have easy access to the Trail, but I guess now they don't want people going across the old canal & the busy railroad.
I had seen my first wild-flowers yesterday; now there were loads of them.  Lots of sun on the tow-path, with protection by the cliffs.  Dutchman's Breeches, May-Apples, Box Elder trees, even 1 marigold [plus some dandelions].
Altho I was up early & thought I was going fast, I got to town too late for church.  So I did my sabbath rest in a restaurant, working my way thru a big burrito while charging up all my devices.  They were really nice to me & even refilled my drink for free.  I also bought a waterproof notebook for the Trail.  Then I loafed around HF for a while, with lots of other sight-seers. ATC HQ was closed again; so I returned to the Trail thru the Storer College area.  From 1865 - 1955, this was a historically Black school, known for the meeting place of the Niagara Movement, predecessor of the NAACP. 
It had turned to a pretty cloudy afternoon as I crossed the long Shenandoah River bridge & then headed up toward Virginia. Not very difficult Trail, & I was able to listen to the National Cathedral service as I hiked. After all the people in town, it was nice to be on the Trail by myself.  After a few miles, I crossed the state line, & a couple of miles later, reached the campsite. Will, the young man who had passed me coming down from Weverton Cliffs, had already set up his hammock & started a fire. I was able to situate my tent so that I didn't get smoked out. Actually, he kept it from being very smoky.  As I ws setting up, a woman hiker came by, who I thought was going to join us. She talked a lot, sounding like she had some official position with the AT — I didn't find out more because she said she had to continue on a little ways, for a pick-up at Keys Gap.","Ed Garvey Shelter
",Campsite on Loudoun Heights,"Apr 03, Sun",11
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650791,"I tried to start early. Fairly long day ahead, including the start of the “Roller Coaster”, 14 miles of ups & downs, with a reputation for being some of the roughest Trail in VA.  
Easy Trail at first, down to Keys Gap.  “Will” passed me by then & disappeared.  About 3 miles farther, I came to the David Lesser Shelter & stopped for a snack. I spoke briefly with a hiker who was there, but I don’t remember his name.  Every time I visit this shelter, they’ve added something— pretty soon, they’ll have to change the name from “Lesser” to “Greater”.
In another 3 miles, I passed the Blackburn Center. I didn’t feel a need to stop, tho last time it had been a nice place to rest an injured leg.  In the next 3-4 miles, the “Roller Coaster” began in earnest.  The slopes were no longer smooth: the Trail was eroded with lots of rocks & some switchbacks.  The path got very wide because hikers have used all kinds of maneuvers to make it easier. Yes there are a number of ups & downs, but it’s the roughness of the Trail that makes it noteworthy.  
At Raven Rocks, I had a view across the next valley & passed a day-hiker & a NOBO thru-hiker in deep conversation. Lots of nice houses visible on the hillsides.   Since it looked mostly downhill to Snicker’s Gap, I called the hostel to say I could get there by 9:00.  A little premature!  Both going down & coming up the next smaller hill turned out to be slower than expected — I’m getting tired of dealing with the rocks.
So by the time I got to highway, it was well after 9:00, totally dark, & I couldn’t tell where the Trail actually crossed the road.  I called the hostel to get directions.  The caretaker said he’d come pick me up at the parking area at the top of the hill.  Before getting there, I saw the Trail going off to the South.  Not obvious.  It IS explained in FarOut, but there really should be a Sign indicating where to go.
I quickly was taken to Bear’s Den hostel & began to rush around trying to get my pizza, laundry, & shower all done before the curfew.  They cut me some slack time-wise; there weren’t very many other guests, & I left my ice cream till morning.  
There was a couple from Arkansas, Nana & Pops, who had started in Waynesboro, heading North on their flip-flop. One other hiker downstairs, 1 upstairs, & 1 camped outside seemed to be all there were. I opened the packages awaiting me, but barely looked at them before getting to sleep.","Campsite on Loudoun Heights
",Bears Den Hostel,"Apr 04, Mon",18.60
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650801,"It’s not that I woke up very late, but I sure got a late start.  First, the pancake breakfast.  Then sorting everything & repacking for mailing some out.  And talking to hikers who were taking a zero day.  Well, I got out on the Trail about 1:30!  Remember, the days are still pretty short this time of year.
More ups & downs — what would I expect in the “Roller Coaster”?  Actually, the Trail-bed is much easier than the part I did last night.  Or am I just getting better on rocks?  
After a few miles, I stopped to eat at Sam Moore Shelter. It was a cloudy day, but I thought I had more time to walk.  In less than an hour, it was beginning to rain, just about when I found a place to camp at Buzzard Hill.  I got my tent up just before it increased … with lots of wind.","Bears Den Hostel
",Buzzard Hill,"Apr 05, Tue",4.50
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650794,"Well, it seemed like a long night in the rain.  I awoke at 6:45 & started hiking at 8:00. That’s pretty good when everything is wet.  I quickly discovered a better, more sheltered campsite just a little bit over the hill.  It wasn’t long before I passed the 1,000-mile marker on the Trail.  Those markers sure do move!  In 2013, it was North of Bear’s Den [7-8 miles from here]!  I can see it doesn’t really mean as much to a flip-flopper as to someone who started at either end.  I met one NOBO hiker who had started in February: “Moment in Time”.
Ups & downs, yes; but this Southern part of the “Roller Coaster” certainly is easier than the part North of Bear’s Den.  I stopped a bit at Rod Hollow Shelter to try to dry some things out.  Too cloudy & humid, with no wind down in the hollow; so I carried almost the same amount of water in the afternoon.
I remember stealth-camping along this part of the Trail in 2013, but I can’t find the spot now.  On the way down to Ashby Gap, there were a lot of trees down, many with vines.  I only did a little trimming, reporting the rest to trail maintainers.
Crossing into Sky Meadows State Park, the terrain definitely became easier [no steep slopes]. As the name implies, I was sometimes walking in open areas. Nothing much of interest anywhere near the Trail, including camping; so I just kept going. I must have been slowing down too because it was after dark when I arrived at the shelter.  It had been  raining, so the blue-blaze trail to the shelter was very wet & eroded.  Everyone was already in their sleeping bags.  I tried to keep as quiet as possible as I spread my stuff to dry under the shelter porch  This is a well-built, new shelter to replace the poorly-but-imaginatively-designed Dick’s Dome, which appears to have been removed now. This is a double-decker, rated for 10-12 people, but five of us made it seem crowded — it’s all in how we arrange ourselves.","Buzzard Hill
",Whiskey Hollow Shelter,"Apr 06, Wed",13.80
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650798,"I was up first & gathered my stuff, which hadn’t dried much, to get out of everyone’s way. I got to meet some of the others over breakfast [Spokes is the only name I remember] & then took off. Only the Trail was wet when I started, but soon there was light rain, which continued off & on till mid-afternoon.  I met a thru-hiker who had started in February, plus an American who lives in Germany. Some names I met during the day were King-Kaka, September, & Double-Decker.  It wasn’t long before I was overtaken by Vagabond [whom I’d met earlier without a trail-name], a 17-year-old, who walked with me most of the day. I’ve walked alone so much, it felt unusual to be talking while hiking. This is to help me prepare for hiking with grandchildren, I guess!  I had to stop occasionally for a breather, but I felt I kept up a reasonable pace.  We stopped at Manassas Gap Shelter for lunch, during the heaviest part of the rain. Vagabond decided to stop for the night at the next shelter.
Jim & Molly Denton Shelter is one of the first of the modern-style shelters, providing luxuries like a solar-heated shower [when sun & water are both available], separate eating pavilion, even horseshoe pits. In the 1930s, the Dentons were leaders in the Roanoke ATC, especially in re-routing hundreds of miles of the AT when the Blue Ridge Parkway took over much of the footpath. They later moved North & were active in Potomac ATC, which built the shelter.
Since it was only about 4:00, I thought I could go 5 more miles before dark, pretty gradually, up & down a thousand  feet, paralleling the National Zoo wildlife area for the last mile or so.   I wasn’t off by much, but I would have had trouble seeing any exotic animals that might have been across the fence. At Highway 522, I turned left a few hundred feet to Mountain Home B&B & Hostel.  Scott & Lisa Jenkins have continued to fix up their historic home, & she has retired from commuting to D.C.  They had only one couple staying in the B&B section & I was the only hiker, so I ended up in the game room.  That gave me a private half-bath & space to spread out my stuff to dry.  I finished my lunch for supper.  I didn’t realize that that was the start of a bad habit.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter
",U. S. 522 Mtn Home Hostel,"Apr 07, Thu",15.20
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650802,"In the morning, I got to have the same breakfast as the other guests, only cheaper.  I thought we were starting pretty early, but it was a big meal, & what with my slow eating & wanting to talk too, it was 10:00 before I got back to my room to pack.
A beautiful day for hiking, I followed the trail up the South side of the valley, walking between various peoples’ yards & more of the National Zoo’s fence.  Still no exotic animals.  I met a woman running & a man with a dog.  After being without them for a couple of days [must have been the soil or the elevation], I began to see wild flowers again: some dark blue hepatica & shiny white bloodroot [the flower of the day for the next week]. Passing the last road before the National Park [It goes to the 4H swimming pool & into the city of Front Royal (curious name)], I stopped to do some clearing on a blow-down too big for me to complete.  Then up the Mtn to Tom Floyd Wayside [Shelter], where I fixed my lunch.  Being a really slow eater, I’m getting in the bad habit of eating my lunch as I walk, resulting in using it for supper as well.  That means fewer total calories, but it seemed convenient at the time.  Besides, there was a cold wind blowing into the shelter making it uncomfortable to just sit still there.  
There is a kind of palisade of rocks guarding the North entrance to Shenandoah National Park.  My camera didn’t keep the pictures I took.  Just past the top is a kiosk with forms to fill out for back-country camping.  It’s a 3-sheet carbon paper [!] form, each sheet of which says to attach it to your pack or tent.  Nothing says to leave a copy, tho that would seem logical, but I couldn’t find any slot to deposit it anyway.  [When I got to the South end of the park, that kiosk had an obvious slot & and instruction on the board]. So I fastened the whole thing to my pack.
From there to Compton Gap, the first of many crossings of Skyline Drive, is the most smooth & level Trail in SNP: an old road thru nice woods [no leaves yet, tho].  Then up Little Compton Peak & on to bigger North Marshall Mtn. The Trail thru the Park isn’t always so smooth, but the gradients are easier that farther South in Virginia.
I had thought I might get to the next shelter for the night, but it was suddenly getting dark fast, with more than 2 miles to go.  I thought of continuing in the dark, but after stumbling on something I didn’t even see, I decided maybe I needed to stop & camp, preferably before the next road crossing [where camping isn’t allowed].  I couldn’t see anything at the viewpoint because of clouds.  Someone was camped there, which confirmed that I ought to too.  No more room there, so I went on farther down to what looked like a small level spot a bit off the Trail. Not quite level, but it worked all right.  A little bit of rain came shortly after I got to bed.","U. S. 522 Mtn Home 
",North Marshall Mtn,"Apr 08, Fri",10.90
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650799,"Tent, &c., had mostly dried off by morning; so I wasn’t adding much water weight.  Generally down-hill for the first few miles to Gravel Springs Hut [That’s what they call shelters in SNP], where I stopped to fix an early lunch.  Very pleasant place with a convenient spring.  Nobody around, but lots of bear warnings.  Didn’t see any [bears or hikers!].
Lots of nice views, especially near road crossings — not surprising since Skyline Drive “stole” the original route of the AT.  Then a little light snow in the afternoon.  No hikers on the Trail, but there were bikers & other types of visitors at Elkwallow Wayside.  I’d hoped to get a hot sandwich there, but the kitchen wasn’t open till May except to make coffee.  I bought a prepared sandwich & moved on.  The Trail makes a ridiculously long circle around this area; it feels like quite a trip to get back up on the ridge again.  
I wanted to stop at the “Open Arms on the Edge of Town” hostel, but by the time I got to Byrd’s Nest #4 picnic area, I could see I wouldn’t be able to do 4.4 miles to the Luray exit before dark.  So I called Alison to see if she’d pick me up at Beahm’s Gap, only a mile from me. She would.  We got there at the same time, just before dusk.  I apparently got the last space in the hostel, with 2 guys from out West, who had been doing a bunch of day-hikes in the area.  I got shower & laundry done, opened a couple of packages [more to carry!], laid out some stuff to dry a bit more, & got to bed.","North Marshall Mtn 
",Beahm's Gap,"Apr 09, Sat",10.90
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650803,"I began the day with breakfast at a restaurant up the street.  I figured I could eat pancakes pretty fast, especially if I “melt” them down with syrup, but I still had to hurry a bit to get up the street another half mile & to be in church on time.  In 2013, I stopped here & found  that the pastor was off at a synod convention, while a layman read a sermon the bishop had prepared for all the churches. He had done a good job with the service, but this time I got to meet the pastor, who has been there many years & is hoping to retire soon.  He is younger than I & has leg problems that make it hard to get around.  I’m thankful that God has given me good legs thus far. We talked about all the little churches that can’t afford pastors & the bigger churches that can’t find organists any more. As I started to leave, I found out that the Church Council had been meeting without him: I hadn’t realized I was keeping him from that. One of the members took me back to the hostel, so that I wouldn’t delay any more in getting back on the Trail.
Alison returned me back to Beahm's Gap, & I took off on a pleasant, sunny afternoon.  I stopped to eat at Pass Mtn Hut [the one with the kissing trees], meeting one thru-hiker [‘Eagle-Like‘] & 2 sets of section hikers during that time.  Then down past the Thornton’ Gap Park entrance & up the next Mtn.  It’s called Mary’s Rock & had attracted a lot of day-hikers, all coming down when I was going up.  This slope is steeper, with a number of switch-backs & some rocks.  Good views at the top & along the way.  I had to take a selfie with the rock & send to step-daughter Mary. Then I moved on.  After a 1.7 mile climb & plenty of sun, the wind made it too cold to stay up there long.
Only a mile from there to Byrd’s Nest #3, a picnic shelter converted to camping, where I spent the night.  As usual, no one else around.","Beahm's Gap
",Birds Nest #3,"Apr 10, Sun",6.50
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650804,"A sunny day, but quite cool in the morning, with wind from the East.  Afternoon was better because the Trail moved to the West side of the ridge.  Today, I came near the tops of two of the tallest mtns in SNP, The Pinnacle & Stony Man, almost 4000 feet.  Lots of day-hikers around both mtns.  Coming down a little, I passed Skyland Resort. I don’t think the restaurant was open yet, but I stopped & fixed lunch nearby.  There was a very confusing detour because of some construction.  I ended up taking the AT anyway.  Reaching the South end of the detour, I found that the signage there explained it much better for NOBOs [as commonly happens].  They were sending the Trail right thru the resort area, which is probably where most hikers would like to go anyway!
In the course or the day, I met several thru-hikers: Bandit [Germany], S. O. S., Keystone [from PA], & a hiker from Thailand.  
I’d thought I might be staying at Rock Spring Hut, but ended up camping along the Trail near there.  I wanted to use Zoom to attend a City Council meeting back home, & I wasn’t sure what phone reception would be like down the hill. I got my tent set up & a place to sit just before the meeting; so that worked out well. I’ll be doing a lot of this in the course of my hike.  Just as the meeting started, Vagabond came by & headed for the shelter.  Also some deer started grazing their way across the grassy plot toward my tent.  I guess I had chosen their prime dining area.  I’m glad it didn’t get very cold till I was done with my meeting.","Byrds Nest #3

In 3-5 miles I came past Big Meadows Campground, Lodge, & Wayside.  The AT actually makes a big loop around the whole area, & I did a bit of obstacle-cutting along the way.    I met thru-hikers Foxtrot, Traps, & Two-step [a SOBO!].   I stopped at the Wayside to try to charge up my cell-phone.  Ended up doing that mostly in the restroom!  I had an important telephone appointment with my doctor [& my wife] so I needed adequate reception.  A few miles South, it was better than at the Wayside, but then it started to fade as I went along.  As the time approached, I reached a picnic area, set my pack down, & suddenly had no signal.  So I hurried back up the Trail to get it re-established. When I had it, I didn’t want to move.  Fortunately, someone came along who was willing to go back & bring me my pack.  Seems like a lot of people at each road crossing.
Reasonably good news from the doctor — nothing that will keep me from hiking.  
Nice, smooth Trail this afternoon.  I don’t do much trash-picking as I hike, but I picked up a garish birthday balloon & hooked it to the top of my pack. Not enough helium left to lighten the load.  I thought I’d find a trash can at the next road crossing.  While I was stopped to fix early supper, a day-hiker came by & offered to dispose of it.  Fine.
I continued on past Bearfence Mtn Hut, not thinking I needed to stop yet. I met Mama-san [SOBO] at the turn-off to the shelter.  By the time I’d gone another mile, I decided to stop at Small Axe Hostel, Elkins, IF I could get a ride.  The proprietor gave me numbers for about 6 people, & eventually one called me back & picked me up at Lewis Mtn Campground.  Not very good phone reception thru this area, but I made it work.
Small Axe is a working farm, & hikers stay in an old barn, but not with the animals. It’s rather primitive, but they don’t charge much & take pride in good food.  I was too late for supper [tho I still got some cake], but I told my shuttler to pick me up right after breakfast.  Apparently, he works closely with the owners.  Other hikers there were Crossword, Army Ant, Merger, & Mary.  They were all slack-packing & NOBO.

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650807,"Slept well & had to eat breakfast very fast for me, but the shuttler waited & still got me out pretty early.  He dropped the others off at various places South of me; so I met them all in the course of the morning.  I was passed by SOBOs Mama-San & Two-Step.  Not many other hikers till late afternoon.
This was my hottest day yet: 90º & still no shade.  Slack-packing began to look more & more attractive.  I’ve always eschewed slack-packing in the past. Now I was reminded of Jenny Joseph’s “When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple.” I began to think, “When I’m past 80, I shall try slack-packing.”  Only problem is: today was the day I should have been doing it, getting picked up somewhere South & returned to the same hostel.  Otherwise, it gets more complicated & more expensive.  I just hadn’t caught on to how easy it could be in SNP now that it isn’t considered illegal for shuttlers to pick up hikers at any road crossing in the park.  With the heat, this really was the day.  I thought about it all day as I hiked — someday, I’ll actually do it. 
At least, there was a lot of down-hill Trail.  By the time I’d crossed the highway at Swift-Run Gap & started up the next Mtn, it was beginning to get a little cooler. I met a NOBO named Crunchy.  After crossing Skyline Drive again, a young man hiked up Hightop Mtn with me.  He does it every day after work!  The name “Hightop Mtn” seems like an oxymoron.  
Just over the high top [a bit of a view], I stopped & stayed at Hightop Hut. Two-Step was camped nearby. 3 NOBOs were staying in the shelter.","Lewis Mtn Campground — Hostel near Elkton

Hightop IS the last high or steep peak in the Park; so I’ll be generally downhill, but there are still ups & downs.  I stopped for lunch at Simmons Gap picnic area & got to watch park employees cleaning out trash cans & restrooms.
Long process!  Earlier, I met 2 sawyers, out cutting blow-downs across the Trail.  I told them about all the stuff down North of Swift-Run Gap.  That would be someone else’s territory; I hope they’ll pass it on. Hikers I met today included Stretch, Sure-foot [AT’92], Samonamong, Silva, Spoon, Lifeguard Louie, Buttercup, Finch, & Tyvek.
The heat yesterday & lower elevations today have brought out more flowers: 3 colors of violets, the first azaleas, & bushes with yellow flowers.  I stopped at Pinefield hut to get started on supper & carried it along.  Five more miles brought me to Loft Mtn campground.  The campground isn’t open yet, but I had heard the the store might be.  Actually, it appeared to be getting ready to open, but no one was around.  The restroom there was open.  Since it was getting colder & darker, I decided to stay there.  I found a clear space near the showers & set up for sleeping.
I couldn’t get all the lights to go off.  Eventually, I figured out they were on motion sensors.  Even while sleeping, I move enough to keep turning them on!","Hightop Hut

More views — it’s easier to see that this was all farmland a century ago. I met Mega, Poppins, Pioneer, & a couple of other hikers, especially around Black Rock & Black Rock Hut, where I stopped for lunch.
I was trying to make enough time to get picked up sometime in the afternoon so that I could get to the hostel by 5:00.  I settled on the crossing at Skyline Drive mile 92.4 [AT 878], & got picked up by a driver from Stanimals 328, in Waynesboro. The place was fairly full, but I got checked in & showered in time to shop for some snacks in the area before heading for church at Grace Lutheran. They have a hostel at the church in May-June, but I was way too early for that.

Otherwise, hikers haven’t left much useful stuff [I did find some thread] — not that I needed more to carry!  I had time to do a little shopping in the area and to do some sewing on my equipment — especially, my shorts have gotten too big in the waist.  I was surprised to learn that the Waynesboro post office isn’t open at all on Saturday.  I certainly had stuff to send out!  The hostel had some kind of connexion with UPS, so I was able to do it that way, but it was pretty expensive.
This is the day for picking up my granddaughter to hike with me for several weeks.  Ellen’s flight was delayed more an hour; so the shuttle driver adjusted, except that he wanted to stop to visit someone in Charlottesville — I got to sit in the car [in the shade] till it was time.  Ellen was almost the last person off the plane, but it was good to see her.  They gave her a bunk at the hostel right next to mine, which was convenient for sorting our stuff.  Then we went to eat at the Italian place on the next block.  That was good.  She fits right in with the other people at the hostel; so I felt OK taking off again to go to the Easter Vigil service, also at the Lutheran Church.

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650813,"Our spell of hot weather has definitely ended!  I had chosen Waynesboro to change to my warm-weather sleeping bag.  Even after learning that we’d have a couple of nights below 40º, I persisted in sending stuff home, figuring I could just wear more clothes. I did & was still pretty cold [for a couple of nights]. 
The snow began as those little frozen balls I’d seen a couple of weeks ago.  This time they stuck & covered the ground all day.  Not difficult for walking, tho. 
We began to learn about our different hiking styles.  I like to stop for about 30 seconds periodically to clear out the lactic acid in my legs.  Ellen [trail name Chako] has trouble with that because the intermittent starting & stopping sets off her asthma or migraines. So she wanted to go on ahead. I told her there was a visitors center at Rockfish Gap & would meet her there.  So she took off, thinking of a place to sit indoors, maybe even with Wi-Fi.
As I got down to the Gap, I saw a man running in boots on Skyline Drive, apparently from the Entry Station to shut the gate.  The road had just been closed on account of weather.  Otherwise, we saw no one all day.  We met up at the gap.  Chako hadn’t been able to find where the AT drops off the edge of the road to continue South, & she had found the visitors center up the hill, but it was closed. So there was a porta-potty!  Obviously, everyone else has taken a zero day in town.
We had our snacks & then hiked together the 5 mostly-level miles to the Paul Wolfe Shelter, passing the ruins of an old house along the way.  Once again, we had the shelter to ourselves. I got to initiate Chako in the workings of the bear poles.  It seems like a good basic idea but still hard for most people to work [The lifting poles are too heavy, once they are loaded with food bags].  I’ve never had a chance to see how the bears work them.
Again, we had the shelter to ourselves.  Chako set up her tent inside, which I don’t like to do, but which was probably warmer.  With the help of my “space blanket” & my poncho, I was able to sleep, tho not warmly.","Calf Mtn Hut
",Paul C. Wolfe Shelter,"Apr 18, Mon",12.50
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650816,"Beautiful morning, sunny, with snow on the ground and ice on the trees.  When I came thru here in 2016, the creek crossing by the shelter had lots of ice on the rocks.  Apparently the ground isn’t so cold now, so that was no problem today.
I got up early & started off, leaving Chako to get up later.  We’ve learned by now that she can hike almost twice as fast as I, so she could meet me later.  The first 1.5 miles goes up 1200 feet — I wasn’t going very fast, & she caught up just before I got to the top near Humpback Rocks.  Then it went up a little more the rest of the morning.  That’s where we finally started seeing other hikers, some thru- & some day-hikers.  It’s also where we were walking thru an icy wonderland, with chunks of ice falling off the trees as the sun hit them. The only name I remember is Swede [from Sweden].  Everyone seemed in a hurry to make up for the weather delay.
I stopped to fix a meal early afternoon on Humpback Mtn.  Chako wasn’t much interested.  We should have talked more about food & water. I could have given her the cooking stuff & water filter, figuring she’d need them before I did.
We weren’t that organized yet.
I also told her I’d be stopping for a city council meeting at 6:00, hoping I’d have enough reception for ZOOM.  She went on ahead, intending to meet up & stay at Maupin Field shelter.  The Trail from Dripping Rocks to Reid’s Gap is pretty level, but rocky in places.  By then, the snow was gone.
I stopped near 3 Ridges Overlook, just before Reid’s Gap, thinking I had at least 2 bars for phone reception.  But it kept fading in & out, not enough band width for me to receive the link for the ZOOM meeting. It wasn’t going to be a long meeting; so after I struggled with it for a half hour, I quit & moved on.  By that time it was starting to get dark.  With only a couple of miles to go, I thought I was making good time on the fairly smooth Trail going up the next little Mtn.  Still some light there, but it got dark fast as I came down toward the shelter.  By the time I got there, it was 9:00, & Chako was quite worried about me, talking with her mother on the phone.
She had gotten set up in the shelter & received help, with water & hanging a bear bag, from the other hiker camped nearby, “Queen of Denmark” [from Denmark!].  I didn’t meet her till morning. The last few shelters have bear poles, with 8-foot steel rods to raise food bags up to hooks 10-12 feet up. Maneuvering heavy bags on the end on heavy rods is hard enough — trying then to get them to hook at the top is really tricky.  If there aren’t many hikers using the pole, the easy way is to throw a line over the hook & haul the bag up.  Easier than finding a suitable tree branch, & probably quite effective at deterring critters.
Not as cold as the previous 2 nights, but I still wore everything I had.","Paul C. Wolfe Shelter

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650819,"Another beautiful day & definitely warmer.  I started off first again, & Chako caught up on top of Bee Mtn.  She stopped there for a while, & we alternated hiking together & separately up & over 3 Ridges Mtn.  From there, the Trail goes down to the Tye River & up the next Mtn, The Priest.  The latter has a reputation for the longest climb on the AT, 3000 feet in 4 miles, but the 6 miles coming down 3 Ridges is harder, with fewer switchbacks & lots more rocks.  I saw my first fire pinks flowers of the trip, one of my favorites, and also my first poison ivy [not a favorite].
It took us most of the day to get down to the river.  There might be some place to camp part-way up the Priest, but it was getting late.  Also, we had both about exhausted our phone battery power.  So we stealth-camped at the beginning of the slope up the South side [being careful about the poison ivy].  There was a house across the road; so we knocked & asked if we could re-charge our devices there.  The owner was very nice about it, so we sat on his porch for a while.  He seemed lonely & hospitable & told us about his plans for the place.  It’s a nice location along the river, but he might have flood-plain & zoning issues to deal with.
When we got back to our camp, we were joined by a NOBO hiker, who camped nearby. Definitely a warmer night.","Maupin Field Shelter

Chako & I alternated hiking together & separately, & we were passed repeatedly by a group of 4 section hikers from Roanoke, also headed South. When we got to the shelter, there were lots of NOBO hikers, & as they left, more came.  Another SOBO we met there was Mama-San.  The privy was a busy place.  In the course of the afternoon, I passed 5 blow-downs plus 3 walk-unders.
The 6.5 miles from there to Seeley-Woodworth Shelter was pretty level, with a lot of little ups & downs.  I didn’t stop at Spy Rock because I’d been there before.  Some hikers we met were Funkytown, Cast-Iron, & Gazelle.  Chako went on ahead & had her tent set up & water filtered before I got there. I stayed in the shelter, she out back.  She’d also gotten acquainted with the group of 4 we’d met earlier.  Sir-Packs-a-Lot, Play-list, Bezos, & Caboose have hiked sections together over a number of years.  They shared their drinks & their fire while I prepared my supper.  Chako stayed up with them while I went to bed.","Just past Tye River

We spent some time on Tar Jacket Ridge today, & then on Cole Mtn Bald; so I was in the sun a lot today.  Not that there was much shade in the woods!
I have never stopped at Cow Camp Gap Shelter in previous hikes.  Now I know why: it’s a full half mile off the AT.  However, I wasn’t up for going much farther; I was pretty tired from yesterday.  I can see that I am definitely slowing down. I had hoped to be spending more time hiking with my granddaughter than seems possible with our different speeds.  At the same time, it’s good to see her making this her own hike, not just tagging along with me.  She’s really getting good at filtering water & throwing a bear rope. We did get complaints from one hiker who thought our bear bag was too close to her tent & to the shelter [Wait till she gets to the shelters with steel bear poles, usually pretty near to the shelter!].  It’s hard enough to find a suitable branch without imposing arbitrary limits.  She was pleasant enough in later conversations.  All the SOBO hikers I mentioned above were tenting nearby, plus a NOBO named Fancy-Pants.  I had the shelter to myself.","Seeley - Woodworth Shelter

I stopped to eat at Brown Mtn Creek Shelter. That’s the beginning of a series of interpretive signs [I thought there used to be more] about the freed slaves who farmed this valley for about 50 years after the Civil War.  Even with the leaves, the Trail seemed always to be oriented so that I had very little shade!  The trail follows the creek for a while, & then a long lake (reservoir), crossing on a nice bridge below the dam. It seems odd to me that the FarOut guide makes no mention of the lake, even tho it’s the most obvious feature of the landscape for a couple of miles.  In the course of the day, I met Bucky, Rebi-Mo, Lentil, Loose-Leaf, Tin-Man [Neth], & a few others.
I was beginning to think I would never get to that bridge over the Pedlar River. When I finally got there, about 3:00, there were 4-5 NOBO hikers gathered under it, all middle-aged, some from New England.  I was able to wash the sweat off my face & get my shirt wet.  That helped a lot with the heat.  Actually, by the time I started up the next Mtn, the day was beginning to get cooler in the course of going up the next 1500 feet.  
About 7:00, I reached a spring along the Trail. I didn’t need water, but it was the place to stop for a few minutes.  The sign said it was 2.8 miles to the shelter, so I thought I was safe texting Chako that I would be to Punch Bowl Shelter by 9:00.  Now I see FarOut says it’s 3.4 miles [plus .2 blue-blaze off the Trail].  Whatever it was, it got dark pretty quickly after that, the Trail got rockier, & I must have gotten slower, because I didn’t get there till 10:30!  I remember there were lots of water bars to climb up & that I was so tired I would have stopped & set up my tent if I’d been able to spot a suitable site.  Lots of tents around the shelter, but only one person in it.  Campers were quiet, but the frogs in the adjacent pond were certainly noisy, as were the birds [talking about eating frogs, maybe?].  Chako had filtered me some water, but I didn’t see her till next day.  Slept well.","Cow Camp Gap Shelter

Chako caught up before the ridge, & took a break there, caught up again, & we hiked together the rest of the day.  Coming down from Rocky Row, we met a woman from Maine & talked a little.  I also got enough reception to call the hostel in Glasgow to let them know we were coming.  
From there it was all downhill, tho I didn’t feel I was going very fast.  Another 90º day! Even in the woods.
We stopped for a snack at Johns Hollow Shelter, meeting a couple of pairs of day-hikers, then pushed on the last 1.7 miles to the highway.  The hostel said they’d pick us up in a little while; so we finally found some solid shade under the bridge across the James River.  It’s the longest foot bridge on the AT, but it’s name comes from Bill Foot, a thru-hiker who worked to get what was left of a railroad bridge re-built for the AT.  At the far end we could see maybe a hundred young people jumping off the bridge into the river.  Plenty of signs prohibiting that at our end of the bridge, but nobody was enforcing anyway. Many jumpers going & coming past us while we enjoyed the cool.
In a little while, the driver from Stanimal’s 328 Hostel in Glasgow came & took us & some others into town.  Turns out he was a hiker too, pressed into service by Charlie, who operates the place pretty much on his own.  A lot of people in a fairly small house, with 2 bedrooms filled with bunkbeds … & one bathroom. In spite of what we’d heard about Charlie, this hostel had a more casual atmosphere than the one in Waynesboro.  Plus a nice big porch to hang out on.
By the time we took our turns getting showers, we were ready to eat.  Only one restaurant in town, but it wasn’t bad for pizza & other Italian stuff.  I ordered a calzone to take out, since they weren’t open on Monday, & we had already decided to take a Zero day tomorrow.  Actually, we had plenty of pizza to take back to the hostel [¼ mile away].  And someone paid for our meal!

In the course of the afternoon, the Trail closely paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway [which largely displaced the original AT thru this area]; in fact, Bobblett’s Gap is sort of straight down the hill from the parkway.  I stopped for supper at Cove Mtn shelter, one of the few on the Trail with no water nearby.

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651035,"Up early again.  Got the bear-bag down & took off, following the parkway again for 5 miles before leaving it for the last time.  Mama-San passed me at 8:15.  By the time I’d stopped for lunch at Wilson Creek shelter, I’d been hearing from various hikers that there would be no water between here & Fullhardt Knob shelter.  Actually, I found water at the next creek; so I tried to let Honey-toe know that she should be sure to get some when she came by. I was certain she was still behind me, since I hadn’t seen her, & I thought hikers passing by were visible from the shelter.  Hiker met today included Agony, Session, #2-Pencil, Zee-X, Old, Goatbeard, Squirrel, Joe-Mama & Grit, Survivor & Danville, Gandalf.
This is a section of the Trail that feels very isolated, even tho it’s not far from metropolitan Roanoke.  Once you get out of the “hollers”, the last 3 miles are a gradual downhill.  I was feeling good & tried to measure my speed.  It looked like at least 2 miles per hour, faster than I’ve been doing lately.  Got there in daylight!
At the shelter, I found a tent nearby & Mama-San in the shelter.  No water, as predicted; but I was OK.  I was expecting to see Honey-Toe soon [I never know how early she starts in the morning].  Then Mama-San told me the that was Honey-Toe’s tent!  Apparently, she had passed me while I was using the privy; so my messages about water were too late.  Of course, she took care of herself on that — something I’m getting used to.","Boblett's Gap Shelter

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651037,"Five miles downhill to Daleville.  I met Self [Que] & No-Steps [Ger].  I’d had good experiences with the Howard Johnsons here previously, but was reading bad reviews this time; so I had some hesitation. Texting Honey-Toe, she figured she could put up with it for one night. The Super 8 across the way is a bit nicer [except the breakfast], but costs more.  And I was way too early for the check-in time at either one. I had 3 boxes to pick up at HJ & needed to do sorting & repacking before the Post Office closed at Noon. SO I paid $10.00 extra to get in early to a $50 room at HJ.  I got out on the road at 11:45, running part of the way; but it was raining & there wasn’t really enough time to do the mile to the Post Office.  At the first traffic light, I was able to hitch a ride [in the back of a pick-up truck] & get there just in time.  Then back to the room for a quick shower before Honey-Toe arrived, hungry.  So we went across to the Mexican restaurant for a good meal.  Actually the hotel room wasn’t bad either [for the price].  I don’t know what the complaints were about. She then spent much of the afternoon doing laundry.
I went up to the shopping center & bought a few groceries plus some fuel at the outfitter.
I plan to go to church tomorrow; so for a change she will be starting earlier than I.  We agreed we’ll meet at Lamberts Meadow shelter","Fullhardt Knob Shelter

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651038,"Starting with a pretty good & complete breakfast, I tried to get everything packed so I could take off right away after church. Last time thru here, I had gone to the Methodist church ¼ mile up the road & heard a 45-minute sermon. I was impressed that the preacher could do it so well, even tho it left little time for singing or anything else I like.  Now they have a new pastor, & the sermon wasn’t nearly as good, tho there was more singing, plus communion.  The church has a big window with a nice view of the ridge I’ll be walking on today …  but not this morning — too much fog.  
I got back to the room to get started. As always, I looked under the beds & around the room to make sure we weren’t leaving anything.  I didn’t look in the tangle of blankets & bedspread on Honey-Toe’s bed.  I also didn’t check for messages after having my phone turned off during church.
The flat land before the ridge is totally populated with honeysuckle, including some almost tree-size.  I’ve always thought of it as an invasive species, but there’s certainly no evidence here of any attempt at eradication.  
Eventually, I crossed a creek & entered a nice woods, somewhat before the Trail crosses a power line & starts up toward the ridge.  I met several hikers coming down, including Rainbow, Story, Blue-Stacks, Bruiser, Rick & Sherry.  
Then I got a message from Honey-Toe, asking if I’d seen her inhaler for her asthma.  She might have left it on the bed: a red inhaler on a red bedspread.  She’d called the motel, but they hadn’t cleaned the room yet & would look for it.  I said I’d go back to see if I could get it.  I hid my pack & started back at a good rate of speed.  When I was almost back to the honeysuckle, I got another text saying she’d figured out how to do without it; so I shouldn’t go back.  So I turned around. She hadn’t had problems with asthma so far this hike — I assumed she knew how to manage it.  I was so close, I probably shouldn’t have stopped.
Back to get my pack, then on up the hill.  It’s a nice woods, but it took longer than I expected to get to the top. There’s a big intersection of high voltage power lines going in different directions  — must be a big power plant down by the reservoir.  Visibility back down the mountain was getting better, but still not clear.  The Trail along the ridge has some rough spots thru the rocks but is mostly pretty good walking.  In the last few miles, the Trail leaves the ridge, not difficult walking, but no views either. Along the way, I met Bootstraps, Rambo, Smoky, Bagel, & a number of day-hikers.  Later, I met Yoshi [very light pack], Poopy, Buckeye, Whoopie, 39, Spooky, Squirrely, Forest-Lorist, Dandelion, Patience, Ice, Honey-Badger, Eagle, & at least 10 more
As I neared the shelter, I began encountering campers, who seemed to be spread out along the valley. Near the creek was Honey-Toes, talking on the phone to her mother [apparently most of the afternoon, because her mother had a different idea about her need for the inhaler].   I soon arrived at the shelter, which already had about 5 people in it, but she had saved room for me.  So I set up, fixed supper, & visited with the other hikers.  That’s not easy for me because I eat so slowly & tend to choke when I try to talk at the same time.
Honey-Toes informed me that the motel had found her inhaler & she had decided to go back to Daleville tomorrow to get it, then get a shuttle to Four Pines hostel to wait for me to arrive the next day.  With my vision of a thru-hike, I was inclined to stay on the Trail.  She had a different vision.  It’s all part of making it her own hike.","Daleville
",Lambert Meadow Shelter,"May 01, Sun",9.40
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651039,"I got up pretty early, but several others got out ahead of me [going the other direction] — I’m still rather slow getting going.
It’s a pretty gradual climb up to Tinker Cliffs, at a 90º turn in the ridge. There are some good-looking cliffs to walk up thru to get to the top, then the Trail is along the cliffs for several miles. I passed thru “Scorched Earth Gap” before climbing up there — wonder where that name came from.
The views from the cliffs are impressive, except for the cement plant just to the North [Yesterday, the views were impeded by fog].  Signs prohibit camping atop the cliffs [& for several miles down to McAfee’s Knob]. I can see why hikers might want to camp there: lots of nice open woods with level, grassy spots that look like good tent sites. I’ll admit to having camped there 15-20 years ago, before all the signs went up.
Hikers met today included several with no name, plus Wipe-out, Hunter, Frodo [Ger.], Wolf, Sparkles, Renaissance, Hillbilly, Mixed-Up, E.F.Hutton, Vincent, Neon, Relish, Pantless, Goodall, Sunshine, Shim, O.T., Dividit, Perseverence, Keeps, Macho-Man, Stelios.
After almost a half mile of cliffs, the Trail goes down a few hundred feet for several miles, then up again to McAfee Knob.  But first it follows a power line r.o.w. for a bit to end up at Campbell shelter.  Just before the shelter, there was a substantial blowdown, lots of branches, but nothing very thick; so I spent a half hour clearing that out with my saw.
A couple arrived from the other direction just as I reached the shelter & started to fix lunch.  I had received some very moldy bread in a delayed mail-drop.  I usually am not bothered by surface mold [some of my heavy, home-made, whole wheat bread has lasted almost a month on the trail], but this was very invasive, & it required a bit of work to find the usable parts. Several other people arrived at the shelter before I was ready to leave.
Less than a mile uphill from there to McAfee’s Knob.  Lots of people there, both day-hikers & backpackers.  In fact there are now two trails down from there, an easy one to the parking lot & a little harder one for backpackers. I rested a little at the top, took in the scenery, & got someone to take my picture.  Then I started down, past Catawba Mtn shelter, then down steeply to Johns Spring shelter.  No one there, as I got set up, but hikers began to arrive, 8-10 before they were done. Many of them were people I had met on the trail earlier or at McAfee’s Knob.  They camped or hammocked at various spots around the shelter & spent a lot of time at the picnic table.  One made a big deal of building a fire; by the time it was going no one seemed interested.  At least, not much smoke came into the shelter.  Altho I had met then separately, they mostly seemed to be a group of people who worked together at a hospital in the area.  It was interesting to learn something about their jobs & relationships.I tried to get some sleep, & eventually everyone else went to bed too. Then at about 10:30, a group of 4 men & a woman arrived, making lots of noise & flashing lights as they took over the rest of the shelter.  I just stayed in my corner & looked like I was asleep.  I got a few hours sleep, till about 4:00, & then they were up & out — just as obnoxious as before.","Lambert Meadow Shelter
",Johns Spring Shelter,"May 02, Mon",9.40
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651040,"After a couple of hours of additional sleep, I got up & going as quickly & quietly as I could.  Not really fast — most of the others were up by the time I left.  A mile down to Hwy 311.  Last time here, I got some one to give me a ride down to the Catawba store — it hadn’t seemed very far.  This time none of the people waiting were willing. So I got the dumb idea of walking down there.  It’s a treacherous winding road with defective shoulders … or none.  I worked my way down to the post office, thinking the gas station/store was just beyond there.  Actually, it’s about 2 more miles!  Nothing to do but head back up to the Trail.  I spent 20 or 30 minutes trying to hitchhike from the intersection before a woman finally stopped & took me back up the hill. Later, I was reminded that there are a couple of alternate side trails farther down that lead more easily to the Catawba store.
 After getting back on the Trail, I was passed by several of the people who had been camped with me last night.  They weren’t going much faster than I, but they eventually pulled ahead. Hikers I met included Sunken, Machine, Rocky-Road, Hey-Jude, Bourbon, Rocket, Wilson, Polaris, Prometheus, Aphrodite, PaCer, Booty-Pusher, Pilgrim, Speedo, Perseverance, & Long-Runner.
Not very difficult trail for the next 6 miles, then .4 miles up Rt. 624 to the 4 Pines Hostel. That’s where Honey-Toe ended up last night, after walking back to the motel to get her inhaler & getting a shuttle from there.  This hostel is a large garage, with automotive tools still around the walls & a single bathroom in one corner.  Lots of bunkbeds plus a variety of old sofas.  I chose a bunk off in a corner; Honey-Toe had already been using a couch right in the middle of everything.  There were only a few hikers when I first arrived, (Quinoa, Shepherd, Bonus) not more than 10 at bed-time.  The caretaker, Sprocket, took some of us to the market [really very near the hostel — my foray this morning was silly, wasn’t it?] to get pizza. Apparently the family-style restaurant in this area doesn’t exist any more.  I had called earlier to see if the store had fuel canisters & was told No.  Well, actually they do.  Like many things in the store it’s hard to find out the price.  Lots of things are pretty high priced — others are oddly cheap.  One clerk said she didn’t know anything because it was her first day on the job, but the other clerk & the manager weren’t much better.  They advertise that the second pizza is discounted.  Another customer was charged full price for all 3 of her pizzas.  When she asked about the discount she was told that if that’s how it rang up on the register, that’s what she had to pay. Obviously, I wasn’t impressed.
Since this is the last hostel for a while, we decided to slack-pack tomorrow & spend another night here. We arranged for a pick-up at Rt 621 & talked with Sprocket about a ride to Pearisburg the following morning.  It’s a long ride, but we don’t have many days left together, & I wanted to let Honey-Toe experience some of the nicer hostels South of there.  Besides, the Trail between here & Pearisburg isn’t real exciting — I’ll come back & pick it up later.","Johns Spring Shelter
",Va 624.— 4 Pines Hostel,"May 03, Tue",6.90
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651041,"One of the features of this hostel I haven’t mentioned is the chickens running around the place.  Honey-Toe had already found out that the owner dropped off a load of eggs each day for the hikers.  So this morning she prepared scrambled eggs for everybody.  

I enjoyed them along with some of my remaining pizza.  Then we set off to hike South, carrying as little as possible.  
In the first 2 miles, we passed Rawie’s Rest viewpoint & Lost Spectacles Gap, then sharply uphill on the rock climb to Dragon’s Tooth.  Many of the hikers found the rocks challenging, but Honey-Toe had no problem with them.  I’ve always said that there are places in Virginia that should give NOBO hikers a premonition of what they face in NH & Maine.
We only spent a little time enjoying the sight: some pointed rock teeth sticking up on the ridge, kind of like some fearsome monster’s jaw.  Then we had 5 miles of down-hill, meeting several hikers on the way, including Frodo, Gumby, & Alex.  A nice sunny day with some good views.  I felt I was going pretty fast, walking with Honey-Toe most of the time.  As we got close to Trout Creek, she decided to stop for a while for rest in the sun & phone calls.
Continuing across the road & up Brushy Mtn, I felt good & felt fast going up, but it was only a couple of miles before Honey-Toe caught up with me.  I was still eating my pizza as we hiked together the rest of the day. She was much more interested than I expected in the Audie Murphy monument [WW II hero who died in a plane crash nearby]; so we spent a bit of time there.  Then a few miles down-hill, meeting Bimble [Eng], ShaMan, Strong-Arm, Guam, & Capital on the way.
At Craig Creek trailhead on Rt. 621, we had only a few minutes to wait for our ride back to 4 Pines.  Earlier in the day, I had arranged with a shuttle driver from the Pearisburg area to come up & take us there tomorrow.  He was cheaper & could take us earlier than Sprocket could. On the drive back, Sprocket was talking about how busy he was tomorrow with a large bunch of shuttle requests.  I told him we’d relieve some of his pressure by cancelling our trip, which would have taken him out of the area for a couple of hours.  He seemed to take that quite well.  Honey-Toe had been concerned that he might blow up, since he often talks in a menacing manner.  
Safely back at the hostel, we still had another trip to the store & then had to figure out how much to leave in the donation box, since the hostel & shuttles operate of donations.  I’m not crazy about having to make that kind of decision, but I think we treated them fairly.
We're jumping ahead a few days, to enjoy some nice hostels & to get to Damascus in time for ""Trail Days"".","Va 624.— 4 Pines Hostel

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651042,"Up early, so that Honey-Toe could again make breakfast for everybody who was interested, & we could still be out at the road by 7:00 am for our ride.  The shuttle driver preferred to pick us up off the property, even tho he said he wasn’t afraid of Sprocket & was armed himself.  The guy sure has a reputation!  Mostly mouth, I think — he treated us all right. 
We had a pleasant drive for more than an hour, with a bit of a travelogue, & then started up the Mtn from Pearisburg.  
I’ll come back to visit the town later.  Going up to Eagles Nest was more rocky than I remembered. It's hard to imagine how, 9 years ago, I came down it in the dark, in a thunderstorm, & without a headlamp. Very carefully, I guess, especially in detecting switchbacks.  This steep couple of miles was a lot more peasant this time, even with a very full pack.  Not quite as many switch-backs as I remembered, tho perhaps more rocks.  Stopped for a snack at Angel’s Rest, with its view of the whole area.  
We walked for a while together, across the ridge for the rest of the day.  At various times, she would stop for a while & then catch up with me again. The Trail is mostly on an old road, which did have a number of blow-downs for me to cut — nothing very big because it’s mostly small trees up there, what’s called a “Rhododendron tunnel”.  As I passed Doc’s Knob shelter [saw a couple of hikers there, but they didn’t seem interested in talking] & got to Rock Cliff Overlook, I found the view a bit hazy, but it was still a good place to stop to eat again.  
I propped up my wooden pole that I had used almost 6 weeks, but then managed to bump it so that it slid down between the the rocks where I couldn’t get it. The rest of the Trail was pretty easy, tho there are a number of random rocks in the path.  I only need the pole for balance, but Honey-Toe, who caught up about then, insisted on finding me another one right away.  Not as good, but it will last till I find something better.  
Soon we reached Sugar Run Gap & walked the easy ¾ mile down to Woods Hole hostel, one of my favorites over the years.  We hadn’t met many hikers on the Trail today, but the place was pretty full.  We ended up in a canvas covered ""room"" up the hill.  Honey-Toe preferred to sleep on the floor, so I ended up with the queen-size bed.  But first, a nice hot shower, clothes-washing, & a wonderful, home-made supper.  I eat so slowly that I got to be the last done, while listening to others’ interesting conversations.  Also talked with Neville for a while. After continuing the hostel her grandmother started many years ago, she’s wondering how much longer she wants to keep doing it.  She & Michael had split up since I was here last, & he had put lot of ideas & effort into the place. She wonders if she also shouldn’t be moving on to something else.  Too bad, because she does this so well!  It is the height of the season; so she’s under more stress right now. She’s a very interesting person to talk with.","Pearisburg Cemetery Road — Cross Avenue

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651043,"Our goal for today is Weary Feet hostel, new to me this trip.  But first, another great Woods Hole breakfast.  I decided that I was carrying too much weight; so I left 6-8 pounds of food & other stuff, to be picked up after Susan arrived in a few days.  
Another nice day on the Trail, as we walked back up the Mtn, then over for several miles till we went down into the Dismal Creek valley, walking sometimes together, but mostly separately. Several hikers were going the other way, even early in the morning.  We passed Wapiti shelter, where hikers had been murdered years ago, & I stopped at the first crossing of Dismal Creek to fix some lunch & talk to Susan on the phone, while Honey-Toe went on ahead.  
Shortly after this came one of the most confusing points on the Trail, at least for SOBO hikers.  I tried not to be confused this time, & I still messed up.  I came to a trail crossing just before a pond, where it looks like the the Trail continues on across a dam, with a pond to the right.  At that point, there are white-blazed trails in three directions & no obvious blazes ahead.  I took one of the side trails last time.  Not wanting to make the same mistake, I went straight ahead, following a path around the pond & then off into the woods, toward the West, the direction I was expecting to go.  It soon became obvious that this wasn’t the AT, so I returned thru a few mucky areas to the intersection.  Now, looking across the dam, I spotted a faint white blaze down to the left below the dam.  Sure enough, the Trail slanted off there, almost out of sight.  This really needs better marking!
Continuing on a few miles, I passed the trail to Dismal Falls, a pretty place, but not in my schedule today.  Almost immediately, heavy rain hit, making the last 2 miles quite wet.  I had told Honey-Toe I’d be to the hostel about 7:30, & that’s about when I arrived at Hwy 606. I didn’t have any idea which way to turn & was getting ready to call the hostel when a vehicle stopped & said they were out looking for me.  I didn’t think I was that late, tho it was getting pretty dark. No choice but to accept the ride [in the opposite direction than I was thinking of going].
Well, I was plenty cold & wet.  Weary Feet Hostel is a big old house with a big front porch, where I could get out of my wet stuff, but that just made me colder till I got inside.  There was still some supper left, & I was able to settle in to the warm living room to eat it.  Very slow eating, even by my standards: rather dry turkey & stiff vegetables. The group in that room was watching hockey games, which didn’t interest me much but was just the thing for Honey-Toe, who had organized the first women’s hockey program at her university.  Eventually, she left for the bunkhouse.  I expected to go there later, but wanted a shower first. Also, someone was talking abut the possibility of sleeping on the couch.  Eventually, they left, & I began thinking, “Why not me?”  So eventually I asked the person who appeared to be in charge, who had to clear it with someone else, & got permission to do so [after everyone else went to bed].
The nicest part of it was: it’s right next to the bathroom!","Woods Hole Hostel

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651044,"I had to be up early, before the place got too crowded.  Breakfast was pretty good & easier for me to eat [Nothing like lots of syrup to wash pancakes down].  I found out that Honey-Toe had saved a place for me in the bunkhouse last night & had wondered what happened to me.  She wasn’t leaving as soon as I wanted to, so I waited thru the line to settle up our accounts, & then left.  In broad daylight, it was much easier to see the way back to the Trail [partly by following other hikers, even if they were going the other way].  The hostel turned out to be right at the intersection with Rt. 42, where I had tried to hitch-hike back from hunting for my wallet 6 years ago.  From there it was a short distance to the nice foot-bridge over Kimberling Creek & then the Trail up Brushy Mtn for the rest of the day.  Actually, we’ve been following Brushy Mtn for a couple of days.  It’s fairly easy  walking, with pretty minor ups & downs & decreasing views this time of year.  
I had originally hoped to stop at another hostel tonight, but I found out it had closed, so I settled on Helvey’s Mill shelter, just before Bland.  I got there slightly before dark, in light rain.  The shelter was full, & there were loads of tents around it.  I didn’t see a good spot; so I went back to the Trail & walked a short distance till I saw a faint side-trail where I could camp a little bit off the AT.  I managed to get the tent up & get in it without getting too wet.  Honey-Toe had told me earlier that she would try to go on several more miles to find a place to camp beyond Bland.","Weary Feet Hostel

There has apparently been more than one hostel in Burke’s Garden, but this is the only one currently.  Bags, from the hostel picked me up at the top.  It’s a bit of a ride to another corner of the valley to this new hostel with lots of amenities.  Honey-Toe was the only hiker there, showered & ready for supper.  They have a sizable food list, with prices for each item.  You choose what you want & they bring it to you to fix in the well-equipped kitchen.  The beds are upstairs in an open dormitory — lots of choice of where to sleep.","Just past Helveys Mill Shelter

It was nice to be able to just sit around & loaf.  I figured I could get a ride back to the Trail & hike 3 more days before being picked up for Trail Days. 
It’s a long winding road in & out of Burke’s Garden.

It felt like a conspiracy, tho they were right on some things.  I’ll admit I was weaker than when I’d started & apparently not getting enough nutrition on a regular basis.  At first, I proposed slack-packing the next 3 days the 52 miles we’d skipped North of Pearisburg.  There are only 2 access roads, & it might involve driving on some gravel [which Susan doesn’t like to do].  The first day would be 21 miles, which seemed doable after a day of rest — I’d been able to average almost 17 miles the past 3 days with a full pack.  They thought that was excessive in my condition, so we agreed I would continue South from Burke’s Garden for an overnight & get to Ceres [Rt. 42] or somewhere beyond that.
Back thru Burke’s Garden on that long & winding road.  Then I started along the ridge. A little rocky, but not bad. Views of the valley are becoming obscured by leaves now.  I met a number of NOBOs thru the course of the day.  By the time I got to Walker Gap, I could see how one could walk down to the hostel that way.  I commended the hostel to other hikers, & told them how to get there, but no one seemed interested — too early in the day, for one thing. Walker Gap has water too, but nobody ever seems to look for it there.  People I met included Picha-Ya-Dagaa, Ben & Jerry, Slowdance, Lemon-Drop.
The hill going up to Chestnut Knob shelter was steeper than I remembered, but not difficult Trail.  The clearing around the shelter gave the best view of Burke’s Garden all day; so I stopped a bit to enjoy it & to talk with 2 hikers who were resting there {Double-Check & Mutch, I think].  Inside was hot & stuffy; outside was cooler but hardly any shade. Guthook says there is a piped spring 0.1 from the shelter — I’ve never found it, but I have used the spring 1.8 South by a little pond. There I met “Allegheny”, who was camping at the end of the pond.  Coming down from the shelter is just that: 5 miles of downhill, the first half out in the open on a grassy road, then on a nice Trail thru woods.  I had some very nice views of the Mtns behind me [East]. I was enjoying going down, but I met a number of hikers going uphill pretty slowly, including Heinekin [Neth].
Mid-afternoon, I got a phone call.  The women in my life had decided that I couldn’t go on another day, even tho I’d been looking forward to fording Lick Creek in a couple of miles.  Susan was already on her way to pick me up at Va 625/ Forest Road 222 [That means the state doesn’t maintain it all the way to the Trail — either way, it’s a gravel road].
About a mile before the road I met a NOBO who was asking if there were any campsites in the next mile or so. That was the steepest part; so there weren’t many flat spots, & I told him about the place by the pond, but he thought that was too far. Yet when I walked on a little farther, I saw that he had skipped numerous likely spots in the flatter part of the Trail. 
As I approached the intersection, I recognized it as the place where I had just missed “trail magic” last time thru, seeing the vehicle leaving just as I started down the last slope. Then, I had still made it another 9 miles to a hostel at Rich Valley road [now there are 2 more hostels before that!].

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651049,"Friday the 13th, but not a bad day.
Thursday was another zero day, trying to sort things, filling my stomach as much as possible, & then moving to a place closer to Damascus to enjoy the festivities at Trail Days.  It turns out that the rental place is really farther from town than I thought, altho it is close to the AT as it comes down from Grayson Highlands. I had expected to have walked that far by now — I’m a bit too slow!  Honeytoe’s boyfriend arrived Thursday, so she’s no longer staying with us, tho we do see them around town.
I got a haircut at One Way Ministries & got to circulate amongst the vendors & try to make it to some of presentations.  That’s kind of hard in any case, because so many things happen at the same time. I enjoy sharing it with Susan this time, but also that makes it more complicated.  I didn’t win anything in the raffles, but Honeytoe did. That was exciting for her.  Last time, I won a $250 backpack [Just what every thru-hiker needs: an extra backpack!].
We thought we’d have a nice restaurant meal at the Old Mill with Honey-Toe & Andy, but it took up a huge amount of the evening because they were so understaffed & the meal was very hard for me to eat.  When we finally got back to the “cabin” [actually a renovated old mobile home], we smelled gas. We spent the rest of the evening trying to get someone to take responsibility for getting it fixed.  No luck.  We opened windows & stayed the night, but the odor was still there in the morning. So we moved out, went back to Damascus for the day’s festivities, & moved to a motel up on I-81.","

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651596,"Yesterday, we went to church in Konnarock, a church I had visited on my hike 6 years ago.  They have a partially retired pastor who serves multiple small churches.  Susan found out before the service that the pianist wasn't going to be able, so she volunteered to play for the service.  That worked well because we got to choose the hymns too!  Then we drove up thru most of Virginia to get to Pennsylvania, where I could head North. 
Susan wants to stay with me for a week or more, feeding me as much as possible, while I do some easier Trail in shorter pieces, to see if I can recover some weight & strength.  It's a difficult position to be in.  I can see that I let myself deteriorate more than I should have. I should have been more cognizant of how much nutrition I was getting, with my slow eating.  But Is it possible to regain while hiking?
The place we're staying is not as close to this part of the Trail as I would have liked — the route to get to Rt. 16 was very complicated, with all the winding roads ... thru Gettysburg, even!
Susan walked in with me for a mile or so from Rt. 16, then met me for lunch at the Old Forge picnic area. I was overtaken by a thru-hiker who was concerned about rain & said he was going to stop at the Deer Lick shelter just in case.  I didn't. He passed me again in the afternoon, reporting that he had taken a nap at the shelter & over-slept.  Still planning a much longer day than I was.  Advantages of being able to hike faster!
I don't think this is very difficult Trail, yet there were enough rocks to slow me down some, even with a fairly light pack. In mid-afternoon, there was a bit of rain. Not enough to slow me down, but it gave me chance to try out my new pack-cover semi-poncho. Seemed a little better than my full poncho for this kind of rain, & lighter besides.
I found Susan waiting for me at Snowy Mtn. Road, after some phone conversation about which road, since the map program is hard to figure on these primitive, poorly labelled roads.  I wasn't very tired, but this seemed like a good place to stop for now.  With slack-packing, I'm learning that you have to figure out not only where to get picked up, but how that will affect the likely end-point of the next segment.","Pa.

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651597,"The place we are staying is on Whiskey Spring Road [must be a story behind that name] actually just a mile or so from the Trail.  I hadn't immediately recognized it as a road the Trail crosses.   After figuring that out, I decided to jump to this nearby segment next.  Getting to Pine Grove Furnace was still a bit convoluted.  After a night of rain, it was nice to follow the AT thru the park on asphalt roadways & to see the historic ruins, including a large [cold!] swimming pool that used to be there.  Susan accompanied me all the way up to Pole Steeple lookout. I found no explanation of the name — just seemed like a typical rock out-cropping with something of a view.  I bet the views were much better a few weeks ago, before the leaves came out. The Trail up was a rutted old road with lots of water running down & across it today. Near the lookout, we met a young woman who had thru-hiked last year, lives in the area, & likes to return to near-by sites. She & Susan had some discussion about nutrition on the Trail. Then I went on alone.than 
The Trail got better the rest of the way up the hill & even better coming down the other side.  I stopped for lunch part-way down but without going off to the James Fry [Tag Run] shelter [Don't know why it needs 2 names!]. Certainly a more pleasant day than the cool, rainy one I had 1 December 2016 on this same segment. 
After crossing a couple of busy roads & the railroad [at least I didn't have to wait for a train this time!], I came to Sheet Iron Roof Road — another name that deserves explanation. Getting to the next road went quite fast —made me wish I'd planned to go farther — tho it was thru a low, wet area.  Again, the name ""Old Town Road"" didn't match up with the map program, but Susan was able to find it & connect easily with Whiskey Spring Road [explanation??].","Pine Grove Furnace State Park
","""Old Town Road""","May 17, Tue",11.50
Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651598,"Since we're staying close by, I might as well start where I left off.  I had hoped to go farther yesterday, but the time Susan was coming to pick me up arrived while I was crossing the last flat area.  She thinks she's preserving my strength by limiting me to a certain number of miles, but the tyranny of the ""appointed time"", without regard for difficulty, is beginning to get to me.  Today, I know it's mostly flat across the Cumberland Valley, so I should be able to do a bit more. After all, I've done a number of 17-18-mile days with an overloaded pack, tho I guess that may have contributed to my being so run down.
I was glad I didn't try more yesterday, however, because that would have meant racing thru the rock mazes.  I remembered these twisting paths amongst big rocks were somewhere near here, but I wasn't thinking they were so close to Whiskey Spring Road.  The Trail starts uphill immediately, getting rocky near the top. Then there are several piles of rock to get thru or around, sometimes without sufficient blazing, all within slightly more than a mile.  I enjoy the big rocks more than the little ones, & it provides some variety to the Trail besides. A couple of boys were up there enjoying the rocks too.

The next 3 miles had several ups & downs, ending with Center Point Knob, the original mid-point of the AT [1937].  It's been moving South [it's 23 miles South this year] ever since. Then it's down & across farm fields for a couple of miles before entering the village of Boiling Springs. After a pleasant walk thru town, I stopped for a break at the ATC office [not open]. Also sitting on the porch was Pegasus, awaiting pick-up to a hostel.  I guess that's a new one.  I certainly wasn't ready to quit for the day.  There's an outfitter next door, but I only glanced in — I certainly don't need any more stuff at this point.
A brief road walk then took me to the AT corridor, running 13 miles across the valley, a narrow strip with farms or residences along each side.  20 years ago, the Trail was pretty exposed to its surroundings; now it feels much more protected.  I remember in the past following a row of walnut trees along the Trail, wondering if anything would grow under them.  Now, those trees are still there but many smaller trees & shrubs have filled in under them to obscure the Trail from the neighbors.  A lot of it is honeysuckle, which isn't so desirable. It was longer but not as dense as the honeysuckle thicket going South out of Daleville.
A lot of shooting going on ahead of me, especially at the firing range just before Pa 641. I hope someone has checked it out to make sure there is no danger to people on the Trail. Sounds pretty close!
About that point, I met several runners, running ahead of me, & then met them again coming back.  Other hikers met today included Chama, June Thing, & Gent. 
This is certainly easy hiking!  It didn't seem long before I was texting back & forth with Susan, trying to  help her locate the pick-up point, & not very long after that, meeting her walking in toward me.  Appalachian Drive didn't seem to offer much place to park, so we ended up walking about 1.5 miles together, plus another half mile down the road to the car.","""Old Town Road""

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651599,"Since we couldn't stay any longer at the place we've been staying, we move today to a place nearer to where I began, & I started up again from Snowy Mtn. Road. That's the highest elevation I'll be at till late afternoon.  When I passed the blue-blaze to Rocky Mtn. Shelters, I couldn't help wondering where the name came from.  I think I figured it out:  the next 3 miles have at least 5 hilltops that are scarcely Mtns., but the each has a rocky out-cropping on its top, which does make the hiking more interesting.  At a couple of them, I also had opportunity to do some trail-work, removing easy blow-downs.
Then it was downhill to cross U.S. 30 & begin some level walking in Caledonia State Park.  After stopping for a snack & bathroom break in the picnic area, I started the long, gradual uphill to Quarry Gap Shelters  Those are the ones with hanging flower pots & other touches that the maintainers have kept up for many years. Quite a contrast with some shelters along the Trail [Deer Lick Shelters, a bit South of here also have such dedicated maintainers]! Only problem is, one of the shelters had a tree fall thru the roof, & no one has been able to fix it yet. A couple of women section hikers staying there were deep in conversation but did express their appreciation for the beauty of the place.
I continued on a gradual uphill & then a bunch of little ups & downs to meet Susan at Middle Ridge Road.  The hiker guides & map programs aren't very helpful in this area.  There are a number of good gravel forest roads intersecting or paralleling the Trail in this area, but no information on where they go or how they connect with the outside world. FarOut has only the inane comment,""Walk along a State Forest Road for about 0.2 mile.""  What help is that, without any idea how to get there?
Well, Susan managed to find an AT crossing & picked me up on Middle Ridge Road.  Hadn't seen any bugs all day, but she was complaining about bugs at that location.  Later, I remembered some years back when she & I had been hiking South thru this area, had come up the hill to this place, looking for a place to rest for a few minutes, only to be inundated with bugs.  They must just love this road crossing!","Snowy Mtn Road

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651600,"Well, it was pretty quick & easy to find Middle Ridge Road from where we are staying now.  In the first mile, I met NOBO Freckles.  We arrived at Milesburn Cabin together & found 2 men setting up for trail magic.  I don't suppose they'll have much business — I haven't seen very many long-distance hikers in this area at this time.  I took what they were offering — fried egg sandwich [more variety later, they said] — & walked on. Even tho I'd just had a big breakfast, I was trying to eat as much as possible to build up my strength.  
Freckles caught up with me when I stopped for a break at Birch Run Shelter.  She took off into the rain, leaving her sun-visor behind. I carried it along hoping to catch up, but after 5 miles, that only happened because she stopped briefly at Tom's Run shelter.  I like seeing & visiting with other hikers on the Trail, but so often on this trip, that only emphasizes how slow I am. She's from this area & was being picked up at the next road.  Besides a family camping at Tom's Run, the only other hiker I saw was Bucky [Aussie], in the last 2 miles before Pine Grove Furnace.  The rain had stopped, but the Trail had a lot of wet spots in those last few miles. There's been a re-route that isn't very pleasant, even tho it leads to a pretty creek valley.
About a half mile from the end, I met Susan walking toward me. We've done that part at least twice together.  At the camp store, I saw Bucky again.  The store was closed, so He couldn't get his half-gallon of ice cream.  And he couldn't get anything from the soft drink machine either, because it didn't take credit cards or larger than one-dollar bills.
At least the distance to where we were staying was quite short this time.","Middle Ridge Road

Rosy Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651601,"Having now completed all the sections down to Rt. 16, I'm ready to head North from the middle of the Cumberland Valley.  When she picked me up here a few days ago, Susan had trouble finding a place to park, ending up a half mile South of the Trail. This time, we discovered that the Trail jogs North a little, passing a parking area along the way. 
We hiked for about a mile along the hedgerows, as the mosquitos kept getting worse, till Susan decided it was time to turn back.  I took pictures of a couple of blow-downs, to send to the trail maintainers, and hurried on.  I don't think it was more than a half mile before I got out on a road to cross I-81 — between the sun & the wind, the mosquitos disappeared. I started getting warm as I crossed some wet fields, then cooler [without bugs] as the Trail followed Conodoguinet Creek to Scott Farm.  I stopped there at a picnic table to eat lunch.  There was lots of activity there. It's a place where people put in & take out canoes & Kayaks, & there were plenty of each.  A number of backpackers [Recyclers + at least 6 others] crossed the bridge & continued West along the stream. They didn't stop at Scott Farm — maybe they'd heard the water supply wasn't working. I figured out that some of the cars in the parking area belonged to Trail maintainers; so when they returned, I spoke briefly with them & gave them my blow-down pictures.  
After I was done there, I set off again to the West, on wet Trail — water seeping all over, but not in springs.. Soon I was crossing Rt. 944.  It's a busy road which used to be difficult to cross, but now there's a tunnel under it for hikers.  Nice!  That marks the end of the valley walk.
From there, the Trail goes thru bigger woods & up some more major hills to Darlington Shelter.  I didn't stop there, because I still had to figure out where I was meeting Susan.   
Hwy 850 looked like the best option, but the maps & guides are terribly vague about other possible roads & how they connect up with the outside world.  After texting back & forth with Susan about how to get there, I suddenly came out of the woods, then across some farm fields & a couple of roads. The best-looking one was 850, & just down the road was a small parking area for hikers. My ride arrived just as I did.
 I didn't really want to stop so early, but the next road crossing was 8 more miles, & I didn't want to go that far today.  That leaves a very awkward piece from a slack-packing viewpoint — I'll figure it out sometime.","Appalachian Drive

We got moved in, had a pleasant supper out on the patio, then went inside to make phone calls, &c. Returning to the kitchen, we found little black bugs all over the floor.  We swept them up, wondering why we hadn't noticed any before.  We were scarcely done, when more began appearing & kept on.  They weren't in any other room, so we finally went to bed.  By morning, there were a few more in the kitchen, which we swept up too.  By this time, we decided we weren't staying: packed up, called the owner, & left.  He said that no previous renters had said anything about bugs, at the same time insisting that the smoke bombs he had set off in the basement should have taken care of any bugs.  He has no idea where they come from.  He'll refer it to the billing company to resolve what refund we get.

Susan dropped me off at U.S. 22/PA 147 & headed back to retrieve groceries we'd left at a rental, while I started up the Mtn.  Rocky Trail, eased somewhat by long switchbacks. I knew that once I got up I'd stay at about the same elevation till the end of the day. Big rocks in the first part, variable later -- lots of poison ivy. 
Last time I was up here, 29 Nov. 2015, there were no leaves on the trees, & I had many good views of Duncannon across  the rivers. This time, not much to see!
Lentil & Loose-Leaf are NOBOs hiking North from Harper's Ferry. We passed each other several times, till they stopped at Peter's Mtn Shelter.

I heard there were several other NOBOs out there on the Mtn, but the only ones I saw were Bucky [Aus.] In the morning & Tin Man [Neth.] In the afternoon. I believe I'd met them in VA also.
 After scrambled eggs & pancakes for breakfast, I had a peanut butter & jelly sandwich made with pancakes for lunch. Simple & easy to eat!
Rather tedious walking today. I spiced it up a little by trying to identify where I had camped last time thru this area: a few miles in from the North end, on a rocky hillside where I couldn't set my tent up right, & where I lost some tent pegs in the thick leaves while setting up & taking down in the dark. I found a likely spot, but then I saw another later that could also have been it!

The primary reason for starting at Swatara Gap was to be positioned to get to Port Clinton [including Post Office] before going to get grandson Amanuel [It wasn't easy to find a shuttle driver who was willing to go to Newark Airport, as simple as the concept looked on paper.]
The map programs [including FarOut] are very unclear about names & numbers of roads that intersect the Trail in this area.  We got off I-81 & headed North on Rt. 72. I remembered that the AT went across the old iron truss brdge; so when I saw it off to the right, I felt it was time to stop driving & start walking. 
The sharp turn up the hill under the interstate bridge is better marked than it used to be; so no problem there. But the steepness & rockiness makes one wonder why anyone thought it was necessary to replace the old road that used to take hikers up more easily.
Early on, I met Sierra &  Free-ly [LASH] -- no other long-distance hikers all day. In the afternoon, I met a SOBO runner, then later, 6 evening walkers, plus 5 more at the lookout near Rt. 501. 
Nice & cool for hiking. Slow because I'm not used to the rocks, but there were about 4 miles of smooth Trail near the end, with little bits thru-out the day. Lots of poison ivy with the rocks, not much other places. Stopped for a break at Wm. Penn Shelter -- typical of many of the large, newer shelters in this area. 
501 Shelter is different, a fully-enclosed building with plywood bunk beds & a big, octagonal skylight that lets in a lot of light even at dusk [I heard it used to belong to a potter, who needed that light for her work]. I found 2 people who looked homeless. The man disappeared quickly without speaking. The woman didn't ask for anything  but stayed in her upper bunk the whole time I was there, wrapped in a heavy blanket. She spoke of places she had walked, on or adjacent to the AT. 
Darrel arrived just after I did. He's got about half the Trail done by sections. Camped nearby were Spoons & Letterman, NOBO thru-hikers doing SOBO slack-packing today.

Darrel overtook me pretty quickly.  
3 thru-hikers, including Carjack & Mixed-Up [He remembered me from VA] passed on their way from Wm. Penn Shelter. Later, Woodstock, plus 7 day-hikers near the highway. I stopped to fix lunch at Hertline Campsite & finished eating it over the next few miles.  
The trail was bad, then good for awhile, then a bit worse with lots of muddy spots, then more rocks again. I just kept on plugging along. There was a hint of rain all day, especially late pm.
Looking at those muddy spots from a trail-maintainer's viewpoint, & knowing from past hikes that these are often wetter than now, I think they need to build some boardwalks, if they can't re-route the water,  or at least provide some stepping stones, so that hikers won't keep widening the path. 
One of the things I try to do while hiking is look for [& remove] sticks across the Trail that might trip people.  Well, I failed in the case of the largest muddy area, one that didn't have an obvious way to get across dry. As I looked for ways to go, my feet got tangled in a broomstick-sized pole I hadn't noticed. Trip! Splat! Right in the mud. Better than falling on rocks, but pretty messy. 
Getting up with my backpack, I'm like a turtle on its back, so I couldn't help getting even more muddy before I got out of there. I proceeded on till I found a place to sit down, with my pack off, & try to clean up a bit. Very sticky mud!  
As I got going from my clean-up spot, FarOut said it was 7:30 & I had 1.2 miles to go to Eagles Nest Shelter. I should be there in less than an hour, even going pretty slow. 
I don't like to check the app too often -- I should be able to spot a sign for a Shelter!  But after it felt close to an hour, I did check. It said 9:00 & at first wouldn't tell me where I was -- I don't understand how that function sometimes turns itself off -- but I managed to get it going & it now said 3.4 miles to the shelter!  I must have got turned around when I stopped.  I was mystified. I had counted at least 6 wet spots after the one that got me, none of them nearly as big, yet somehow I must have gone thru it again the other way without noticing.

This time I slept all the way till 5 a.m. Then I woke with a pain in my chest -- I haven't had a pain like that for many years. Concerned about heart problems,  I took a couple of nitroglycerine tablets. Nothing happened.  So I took a couple more, and the pain went away. 
 It still seemed significant enough to get checked out; so I packed up everything and walked to Highway 183 to hitch a ride to Reading.  At least this distance  was shorter than if I had gone all the way to the shelter! On the way I met several thru-hikers, including Shorty & Coasty [he said that he remembered meeting me in Virginia], and also a family with a couple of young girls, coming back from their first backpacking trip. 
This was not an easy place to hitchhike --  top of a misty pass isn't good for visibility. After about 20 minutes, a man stopped & gave me a ride all the way to the Reading Hospital.  
I was impressed with the emergency room: they didn't ask for insurance information for several hours, while efficiently doing a whole bunch of tests & confering with specialists to get a diagnosis. They quickly eliminated heart issues & focused on pneumonia from aspirating food and drink [even tho I didn't have a fever or some other symptoms of infection] and decided I needed to stay for some intravenous antibiotic treatments.

When I came home late May, it was only a week earlier than I had originally intended; so I expected to be out on the Trail again without losing too much time. I missed having the time with Amanuel, & we were unable to work out any likely times for the rest of the Summer.  
Susan & I spent a lot of time looking for ways to fatten me up a bit now & to plan for better nutrition while on the trail.
Backcountry Foodie looked to be one of the best sources, & we tried out a number of their ideas, most of which seemed workable for me.  Nothing has changed from being such a slow eater tho.  The original plan had been for me to be up to Northern Massachusetts by the 4th of July, when I could meet our daughter Mary to hike a week North from there.  Then Susan would meet me in New Hampshire a few weeks later to help me thru the White Mtns.
Well, none of that worked out, even tho Mary & I went ahead & booked plane tickets.  I just wasn’t gaining any weight, & then I had an abscessed tooth flare-up.  It was a tooth whose the crown had come off during the hike, without bothering me much.  But now I suddenly had a lot of pain & a swollen face.  Antibiotics  knocked that down pretty fast, & I thought I could just carry on.  My dentists advised strongly against that, yet the easy solutions seemed unavailable.  No one wanted to do an extraction or even a root canal because of concerns for the damage my radiation treatments for cancer 2 years ago had done to the jawbone. Two out of 3 oral surgeons that I consulted urged me to have Hyperbaric Oxygen [HBO] treatments first, to improve blood flow to my gums & bone. That’s 6 weeks of daily oxygen treatments before the procedure & 2 weeks after.  By the time I worked thru all these consultations & getting the VA to pay for the extraction, then actually doing the treatment, I didn’t get the tooth removed till the day after Thanksgiving.  So far that has seemed to go well, & I think HBO has helped with my dry-mouth issues a well.
It sure made for a different kind of Summer & Fall than I had anticipated.  More time with Susan & doing things around the house.  Also, doing more supply preaching.  And I was able to participate more fully in my work on city council — helping to hire a new city administrator would certainly have been nearly impossible to do by ZOOM.
