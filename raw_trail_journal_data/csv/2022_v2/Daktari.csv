Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628001,"Well, less than 280 days to go, I am finally starting a journal here. I've been camping since I was 2, or so my parents have told me. First saw the AT on the Clingman's dome in the Smokies in 1960 on a family camping vacation. I am a AVID hammocker, as in haven't spent a night in a bed since May 16 2017. My pack weight without food / water is 27 Lbs. My first day on the AT 20 years ago was over 65 Lbs.",,View Entry,"May 15, Fri",0

Now, my total pack weight without food is 25 Lbs. My cook SET weighs less than my cook POT on he first hike. Hike & learn.",,View Entry,"May 16, Sat",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628129,"Many take a trail name, the ""proper way"" is to earn one ON the trail. For example, ""Stumbles"" is always falling, or at least tripping. Others choose one pre hike, Mine is a combination of both ways: When I worked at the Cinti Zoo, I did a lot of putting back together my co workers, I earned the nickname ""Doc"" after a few years of wearing safari type uniform, it slowly progressed to ""Daktari"", , , Several years later, on my first night of a section hike, at the Hawk Mt Shelter, I told the above story, the consensus was ""that is your trail name"" I then told them Daktari is Swahili for ""Healer!"" & my job was as a Paramedic. ""OH YES! YOU ARE Daktari!""",,View Entry,"May 20, Wed",0

Need a new engine for my beloved JEEP, & repairs to a few of my teeth. I guess I could hold off on Jeep, but my teeth HURT, & wife tired of driving me to work.",,View Entry,"Jun 11, Thu",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628546,"I DO, I am no speedster. My goal is to hike without getting hurt doing so. I do (tongue in cheek) ask that those coming behind me to have the decency to at least act like it's hard to pass me by breathing hard, even if it means faking it. In fact, the more obviously you are faking it, the bigger my smile (On one section hike: One hiker was totally not breathing hard until about 5' behind me, then was Huffing & Puffing like an old steam engine till about 10' after passing me. I had to stop I was laughing so hard! Told him ""THANKS I needed that!"")I have over 900 miles sectioning the AT, plus about that on other trails, I am still learning. Some learning is by doing & making mistakes, some by watching U-Tube videos. My favorite is Homemade Wanderlust, aka ""Dixie"" with Darwin being a close second. Have learned so much from both. And, been reminded of a lot of stuff I already know, but it's good to be reminded, cause sometimes I forget to remember. Perhaps in a few months I'll post my gear list. It is still being sorted out a little, even though I could leave today with what I have.",,View Entry,"Jun 13, Sat",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628756,"I guess I should add some ""Pre thru hike thoughts"" I have transcribed several journals here on TJ, a few of 'MY"" hikers have vanished. Not answering e-mails, or their phone. Pretty sure they are not dead, but, , , , , , So, unless I get dead, even if I get off the trail, I will update & not just stop. It may take a while, because if I'm not dead, I will be very upset I had to end my hike early. Actually may take less time for me to tell you I died than that I quit.I have hiked over 900 miles of the AT in sections, so am pretty confident I'll be making it to the northern summit. That being said, I HAVE quit a few 2 week sections on day 3 due to being homesick. I think I have worked out what to do if it hits again, But we will see.I am a hardcore hammocker, haven't slept in a bed since 3/16/2017, & can & have set up nearly anywhere with trees, or even no trees, just on the ground. I can set up very quickly but only because I have done it so many times. My recorded record to go from shelter in my pack to me in my hammock is 3 minutes. I was VERY motivated, there was a serious thunderstorm heading for me, I had 3 minutes 30 seconds to set up. I won.My very well used stove is a fancy feast can that burns alcohol. I can have boiling water in about 6 minutes, & I ""Cook"" only by adding boiling water to my dry food (Ramen, rice, etc). I usually only cook dinner / last meal. sometimes I do Oatmeal in the morning, but usually breakfast is Carnation Instant breakfast added to my water bottle & consumed while walking. Lunch lasts all day, as I eat while walking: candy, cheese, sausage, etc.So, 240 days till I launch. I can't wait!",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Tue",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628915,"I just posted my gear list. Probably haven't listed all of it, but got most of it. Criticize if you must, but I won't be changing anything, have been working on this for over 20 years, so pretty comfortable with it. Total FSO weight under 25 LBS without: food, water & fuel. Can I cut any weight? Yep, by going to just the tarp, loosing the Underquilt & adding a pad & ground cover, I might save 1 to 2 Lbs, NOT worth it, I'm a hard core hammocker (Every night since 5/16/2017!) so not changing that.",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Thu",0

Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629605,"So, if you looked at my gear list you will see that I have a Kilt listed in ""clothing worn"". I wear a kilt probably 90% of the time I'm not at work, IF work would allow, I would wear one of my kilts at work. My preferred Kilt to hike in is a Thrifty Kilt from Stillwater kilts with the Clan Gordon tartan. It is Acrylic, so dries super fast, yet it feels like wool. I admit it is a bit heavy (about 3X what my hiking shorts weighed) As a Sporran  I have a lightweight Fanny pack. Yes, I have tried going back to the much lighter shorts, the verdict is a resounding NO! In case you wonder, I own 6 kilts.",,View Entry,"Jul 29, Wed",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630097,"Well, after a LONG wait at a mechanic who did not want to fix her, and IF he did wanted well over $4,000.00 (Nearly $5,000.00) to do so, I found someone who DID want to fix her, & for under $2,000.00, including a fairly long tow, My girl has recovered from major surgery that is an engine transplant. Her first engine had over 205,000 miles on it before it blew, so I guess I can't complain. The new engine is starting with just over 100,000 miles, & seems well cared for before it's original body was wrecked. Jeep is still not talking to me*, but I am hopeful. That may be because mechanic #1 left the hazard lights on & ran the battery to DEAD, or, well, you know ""Major surgery"".Due to some other issues not related to Jeep, I still have not started to really train as I had hoped to do by now. But I WILL get miles in before I hit the trail! And, fixing what I need to fix means a LOT of walking & carrying stuff. I am still fussing with my gear, i do not need to, but am doing so anyway. Going to allow myself to put some stuff I do not need in the pack, so I can take it out again next February during pre-hike.So far, & it WILL stay in the pack, my ""Luxury item"" is a tin whistle I have had for years, has been on most hikes with me, left behind only because I forgot it. I am an OK player. I enjoy what I play so am saying that is what matters. The only new gear I need is a smart phone & a Garmin GPS tracker so my wife can keep up with me & worry less, but waiting until about January of 21 to get those.*It's a Jeep thing!",,View Entry,"Aug 21, Fri",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631004,"Well, the attraction I work at started last Friday & Saturday, I had a blast & so did my customers, or so my boss said. I also got to play with my camping set up in an odd location (hammock & tarp hung from a large fence post & a Bradford pear tree, at nearly the shortest distance I'm able to.) With a few, , , , , adjustments to keep me warm due to my early start. 
Weighed my stuff today: My FSO weight is 26 Lbs, with 3 days food, so likely under 25 Lbs (FSO is From Skin Out or the weight of hiking gear and clothing as opposed to being naked) My first section on the AT in 1998 was at least 70 Lbs FSO, so probably more than that. I have learned a LOT since 98. 
A tip for those planning a thru hike, , OK, maybe more than one: 
Practice with all of your gear, practice to the point of being sick of it, then do it 10 more times! Yes, you will get better as you hike, but it will be much better to start out being able to set up shelter when you first hit the trail then to struggle, in a rain storm, after a long day hiking in the mountains. 
Try the food you plan to carry at home FIRST, don't do, as some have, & say ""Hey, that sounds good! I'll carry that, hiker X did fine on that last year!"" Just because X thrived on pickled bat wings, doesn't mean you will. Did you hear about ""Cold Soak"" method of prepping food? It may work for you, may not! Try it at home FIRST! I did, am glad I did, I do not like most food prepared that way, I know that before hitting the trail!
Break in your foot wear!! Learn how to treat blisters! Take your foot wear off during breaks AND take the insoles (if you use them) out to let it all air out / dry off. If you can, your socks too!
Many have difficulty eating the first few days of long hikes, including Me, if you do, you MUST force yourself to eat! If you don't, you WILL pay for that in the following days or weeks! Drink more than you think you need to! Thirst is a late sign of need for water! Fill up on water at EVERY opportunity, it MAY mean you don't have to carry as much water, & at 8 + Lbs per gallon, water is your heaviest item.EDIT post hike: I so wish I had listened to me!! I did none of the previous paragraph!!
If you have heard the military saying ""One is none & two is one!"" Yea, for backpacking, NO!!! You want items that you can use for 2 or more things. Not two things that do the same one thing. My trowel does double duty as a emergency tent stake. My kilt is also my pillow at night. My ""camp shoes"" also do as: water crossing shoes, shower shoes, ""I'm tired of my hikers"" shoes, going shopping in so my hikers can dry out, etc. Bandannas do so many things I'll not touch on them here! I carry 4! Rain coat as a windbreaker / extra insulation. And so much more.",,View Entry,"Sep 29, Tue",0

I suppose I have my gear in order, I will find out in just over 55 days, LOL! I am mildly concerned about getting cold, especially at night due to my early start. My feet are a special concern due to historically poor circulation. Again, I'll find out in about 55 days.

Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632330,"Well, in 30 days I should be on the trail. Only thing to work out is getting to the trail AND getting my Jeep home. I have a few options penciled in, & don't leave for another 28 or so days. Now know (on line) a few people to meet with,,, maybe,,,,,, as we hike along. For those who will be out there this year: Be safe, keep hiking, look around from time to time don't just look down at your feet. :-) Take breaks, you will surprisingly hike faster & further over all with breaks from time to time. I stop at least until I can no longer hear my heartbeat in my head. POBOBs are a good idea, Pack Off Boots Off Breaks can save your hike. I take Near zero (NERO) mile breaks from time to time as opposed to Zero mile days, as zeros tend to make me feel like I'm starting my hike all over. YMMV!",,View Entry,"Jan 19, Tue",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632521,"Yes, in spite of Hiker Hating ATC's recommendation (they want it to be an ORDER) to the contrary, I am still doing my thru hike. I heard the announcement ""The ATC is not recognizing any thru hikes!"" and was not impressed. The volunteers are mostly good people, but management is 100% anti hiker. 2020 must have given them an orgasm as they had the government's backing to keep hikers off of THEIR trail!!I will do the mask & distancing if possible, but nothing else the ATC says I MUST do. I WILL show them both of my middle fingers. As Dixie says ""You pack your fears"" & apparently I have a big fear of the cold :-)  Justified I feel, have had hypothermia 4 times, so not a big fan. I do have a bit too much insulation, still, maybe I will not get too cold. AND, I am a big fan of hot water bottle(s) in my sleeping gear. Got most of my gear set, need a new suspension for my hammock, & some food, but other than that, I feel I could leave the day I get my hammock back from Zipper Queen.

I am so Happy! 7 days to go, my stomach is trying to back flip out of me I'm so unreasonably nervous. May have to start at Amicalola Falls, depending on the weather. Hoping Gorp Gobbler will do at least a few miles with me, he is great company, & we have similar pacing.Thanks to all who have offered words of encouragement. I'll be fine, I have experience in these mountains and in winter camping. Money may be an issue, budgeting ""Just"" $1.00 a mile, but I don't need any new gear, AND I have replacements for about 90% of my gear, including pack & shelter. Bills at home are mostly covered, so keeping fingers crossed. My biggest, , , , , , concern is: my ""Pets"" are very short lived (Rats, 1 to 4 year lifespan, the baby is 2.) and it is very likely I will never see most (All?) of them again after next Friday PM.

Hiked up to the summit with me, took pictures. Then I did a leisurely hike to Stover creek SH, where I spent the night with about 10 other hikers.
Tues AM, got on the trail around 9 AM, was gonna take my time, only had about 5 - 6 miles to go, stopped by Long Creek Falls, Well worth the trip! Ate lunch at the trail Jct, at just past Hickory Flats, I saw that my knife (3 days old) was missing, so I HAD to go back & look for it. Did not find it. Was Exhausted by the time I got to Hawk mt SH!!! AM Friday, around 3, it started to Rain. I tried to leave, WAy to tired, took a Zero my 3rd day! Got SOAKED over night.

Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633612,"I've been home since about 6PM Saturday, I""m still very tired (lots of neglected chores to catch up on) But content with my decision to get off the trail. After getting EVERYTHING soaked at Hawk Mt Shelter, I spent a night at Above the clouds & dried out, and ate. Iv'e only been eating 500 to 600 calories a day, while burning over 3,000 a day.Back on the trail with Gaddy (Gadabout), once to the top of the next mountain, we sort of parted ways, with plans to meet up at the next shelter, forgetting to exchange phone numbers. At the shelter, no Gaddy. No one had seen him for hours. Turns out, I (on line) know his cousin, we finally exchanged numbers through him, He had fallen a bit before the shelter. (Update after I got home, he is getting surgery today on his foot) I got set up away from the wind, ate & went to bed, the wind (OF course) switched, & I was buffeted Hard all night. Special thanks to Jan, a local who helped keep me going on my final miles to the shelter. After some struggles the next few days, I got to Mt Crossings after a MISERABLE hike over Blood Mt. NOT the trail I hiked over 30 years ago. Called Above the Clouds & got a ride back there. Once again, I highly recommend them!!Back to Mt Crossings. I got a few dry bags, to help pack easier, the trash bags were not working. A good hike up & down. Still not eating properly, if at all.Had a pretty good hike to Dick's creek gap, spent the night at Hostel around the bend, Yea, I recommend them too! Resupply at Ingles, EVERYTHING a hiker would need, I even got sushi for dinner there.I pushed way way to hard to the NOC, but got there in pretty good condition, my $28.00 pack is falling apart, I expected this, so when I got to NOC, I got a Osprey pack, MUCH MUCH better. On to Kathadin for me. Set up just up the hill from NOC, GREAT campsite, almost in a cave.So, once again, I got soaked at night. NOT my gear's fault, it needs set up EXACTLY right, I got lazy. No room at the NOC, called the Hike Inn, & Tom came & got me, My mental attitude is, , , getting bad. Going to push through it, a nero at the Inn, then a zero at the Fontana Hilton. Then push to ?????So, made it to Birch Campground. Pretty good camp, was very cold all night, woke up unable to feel my fingers. Got a txt from Gorp Gobbler, asked for a ride home, he agreed. I am a firm believer in ""Never quit on a bad day!!!"" however, I had made a decision to try to push past the ""Quit"" 2 days ago, that was not going to happen. So, while I did quit on a bad day, I did try very hard to not!Here I am at home, and I am happy(ish) about it. Thy warning of most of your hike being in your head is true, I knew this, Promised myself I would be different, ""I have a plan to stay out here!"" I was WRONG.

I wish I knew, I simply could not. NOTHING was appealing. Not the food I had, nothing at resupply, nothing other hikers offered!I even tried to force myself to eat, to no avail! Finally, about day 12 I got to a Wendy's ate a Baconator combo and was able to eat again. With a vengeance even. I'm often unable to eat on the longer hikes, but only for the first 3 or 4 days, I don't know what happened this time.Maybe this affected me long term, but I don't think so.

I have many many many examples of how they HATE hikers, but that is the final nail in the coffin for them. Even though the CDC AND the national park service have said it is OK to reopen the shelters, the ATC REFUSES to. The chance to do vaccines at trail days has been presented to them, the ATC REFUSES (It would help hikers after all), What affected me personally: I signed up / registered for my thru, , they DELETED it, granted, they put it back in when I protested, but still, they DELETED me.

Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639480,"Some tips, many of which I wish I had listened to for my 2021 attempt*, for newish hikers:
In NO particular order.
*Eat as much as you can, eat often as opposed to a lot at once!
Calories per ounce is a good idea, but vegetable oil is high calorie, but very poor nutrition.
Go for high calorie AND high nutrition foods!
*Hike according to your limit! Pushing past is good, but pushing too far, can be worse than not going far enough, as too far may mean you don’t get as far long term as if you had taken it easy.
*If, like me, days off are like hitting a reset button without saving the game, don’t take (many) days off. *For me, near Zero days (NEROs) are much better, again, for Me.
*Take pictures!! *Do videos if you can! *Keep notes: of who you meet, who or what is in the picture & where it was taken!
*Drink water! Drink Water! Drink WATER! Yes, you may need to stop & pee more often, but you WILL feel better overall!!! 
I often do an electrolyte supplement at least once a day, usually PM with dinner!
*Pay close attention to your camp set up! “It’s good enough!” is NOT good enough! Your setup is probably different from mine, still, set up as good as possible! Your life may depend on it!!
I always assume that the next water source will be dry, I carry water to get me to the 2nd water source, if there is water at the 1st source, BONUS! I then carry water to the next “2nd source!” Heavy? Yes! Running out of water is worse than carrying too much!
Never quit on a bad day! [technically, I did on my 21 thru attempt, but had made the decision on a good day, tried to push through, I tried too hard.]
YMMV: I carry 2 headlamps, I was glad I did on my 21 attempt, the NEW batteries in my primary got Dead my first night! 
I use my trekking poles as tent stakes. Especially in bad / windy weather.
Use trekking poles! They help with many things: Balance, Pace, brakes downhill, extra power / traction on uphills, tent pegs, etc.
Carry Duct tape (I carry Duct AND Gorilla Tape!).
Do you NEED glasses / contacts? Carry a spare pair of glasses ‘Just in case!” 
Practice with EVERYTHING you will be carrying! 
Set your shelter up until you can literally do so with your eyes closed! Then set up your shelter 20 more times!
You may have heard a lot about “Cold soaking your meals” and want to do that, , , Practice with that at home before you hit the trail! You may not like some meals and finding this out on the trail is a bad idea. I normally LOVE rice, cold, hot, etc. Cold soak, even up to 10 X the suggested time I can not eat it. I was so glad I practiced!
The same applies to “No cook” get some foods like: Pop Tarts, Sausages, Cheese, Tortillas, Nut Butters, Nuts & dried fruits, etc. Then do a few practice hikes, are you actually saving weight? Is the ease of not cooking worth it? For ME, I do no cook for breakfast and that works for me!
Going to use a stove? Don’t practice on a stable non flammable surface, get down in the dirt & practice there!! How much water do you need per meal? Can your cook set up produce that amount of hot water,,, in a timely manner?
Cheese, does keep on the trail! The harder the better it will keep! BUT, I have carried Philly cream cheese for 3 days in cool to cold weather! It may last longer than that, but I've eaten it all by then. Be sure to double Ziploc it!!! I put it in all of my meals when I have it!
*Hard candy as you walk is a GREAT moral booster! I use Jolly Rancher!Multi vitamins SEEM to help. Especially if your nutrition is poor, as is most long distance hikers food! I take a 1 a day type multi AM and PM every day, yes, that may be too much, and I do warn against over doing it, but my theory is: AM to help my hike, PM to help me heal! YMMV!*Don't leave your hiking poles at home, only to realize that when getting ready at the trail head!! (2X)*Don't leave your hiking poles in the hostel or shuttle! (1X)*Don't leave your hiking poles at the shelter / camp site / trail head / etc. (5X)

Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643387,"Since coming off of the trail, I have been working part time, at work last week I talked to a coworker, he crosses the AT just north of the Smokies once a month to visit his mother, I asked ""Do you go past the Smokies?"" He does, and is willing to give me a ride, alternatively, he sometimes goes thru Abbington VA, so just up the road from Damascus VA, I may start there. In 2021 my wife suggested I start where I ended my section hikes,,,, I wish I had listened to her, going to listen to her now, well, sort of, I actually stopped about half way through SNP, but did a few yellow blazes after Damascus, so want to fix that.I will be not making the same mistakes I did this year, , , , , I hope.",,View Entry,"Aug 31, Tue",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645695,"Well, here I go again. Wife had a spinal stroke Tuesday, is now (Hopefully temporary) paralyzed below the waist, with minimal feeling below the knees. So now no Thru for me, maybe ever.Nothing is more important than my wife, so going to play it by ear.",,View Entry,"Nov 07, Sun",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645779,"Wife had a spinal stroke 11/2/21, is paralyzed waste down, so I am now primary care giver until ??????Thanks those who have been following / rooting for me. I've not given up hope, she IS improving, at a rate of being better in 3+ years. Maybe I'll break Nimblewell Nomad's record :-) I""m still doing training, somewhat, between hospital visits. Did 22 stair steps today, & about 1/2 mile walking. Another 1/2 mile back to the car later today.Have a good hike those who get to go!",,View Entry,"Nov 14, Sun",0
Daktari,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646157,"Wife is home. My training has gone to the wayside for a bit, still figuring out the care process. Her rehab has been put on hold for a few weeks, so zero improvement for the past week, but she hasn't gotten worse, so once we get rehab going again, I'm hopeful. For now, my goal is to start in Damascus VA mid to late Feb of 2024 for a flip flop Thru hike. Or maybe even just a LASH.",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Sun",0
