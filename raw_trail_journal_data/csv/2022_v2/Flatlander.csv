Flatlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650414,"5 May had us dropped off at Neels gap and off we hiked. Needed 3 days of 12.7 miles. We went 14.4 to a tent site our new AT record. Forecast called for t-storms overnight and some in day. Made the plan if it was as dry at 5am, pack up and head out. It did rain overnight drowning out the snoring. Up at 5 with dry weather, but by 8:45 it was pouring down with light and sound effects. Got to Unicoi Gap, booked a room in Helen and a shuttle. Our original plan will still see us at Dick’s creek gap tomorrow just via a slack pack the whole distance.","Neels Gap

Flatlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650531,"adjusted today as a long (long to us as newbies) slackpack. That made up for the  only 7 miles yesterday. With a near 18. We are all tired. Like the walking dead (trail zombies).Trying to workout how to not get in trouble with the bears at multiple shelters and campsites was not going well. So new plan: jump past them! We will get a shuttle from Dick’s creek gap to winding stair. We are here for 2 months training, not bear attacks. We can always come back if we want the completion.","Unicoi gap

Flatlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650952,"Well things don’t always work out like you want. My mom (85) broke her leg near her hip last Sunday and got help 2 days later. She has had surgery, but I need to get off trail. Her sister is headed her way and will give us time to do the Smoky Mountains before heading to Oregon in about 10 days.","NOC

Flatlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651331,walked out of the park and got into Standing Bear at 1100am. Don’t recall the walk from the park to SB being so rough. We will 2 1/2 day it into Hot Springs where we will get picked up and dropped off at airport on Tuesday to fly to OR. My mom broke her leg near her hip and I must leave the AT early :(,"Fontana Dam

Flatlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653636,"Hot Springs became our new end point so we could head to Salem, OR for my mom. Chelsea would drive down from Richmond and pick us up 5 weeks early. We planned 3 days (last day a nero), but bad weather was threatening and we were close enough we made it to town in 2 days right before the Tstorm hit. Since we got in a little late all but 2 bunks were gone and no private rooms available. So we tented and Chelsea picked us up as re-planned (thanks Chelsea!). And just like that we flew to Oregon with hopes of more hiking in the future. And since I am writing this a month later, the future sees us with Amtrak tickets on 13 Jul to Granby, CO to pickup our CDT hike which is the whole reason we were getting in shape! A bit disappointing to waste our first AT town we walked into by being picked up there, but we got the previous evening to enjoy it a little. Since we don’t have enough time to finish the CDT, we will probably recycle this year’s plan. Start the AT in Hot Springs and walk a month plus to get in shape then jump to CDT where ever we left our gap and finish it.","Standing Bear Farm
