Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632389,"Around age 40 I got the first real taste of long walks. It was then when I walked my first long distance walking march, the four days of Nijmegen (Holland). The march covers 4 consecutive days of 50 km (just over 31 miles) each. Taken on as sort of a one-time challenge at first, it evolved into a tradition in the years that followed.
About ten years earlier, more or less by coincidence I had became aware of the concept of the Appalachian Trail. Intrigued as I was, I started to read online trail journals and even a couple of books. I was hooked! From that moment on, my ambition was to thru-hike the AT.
Fast forward to January 2021 when my wife told me that it is silly to keep postponing something this important to me. She was right of course. I needed nothing more, got on the internet straight away a bought myself a second hand backpack (70 liters - pretty big), started reseaching the rest of the gear needed and planned the starting date of this big adventure. The dream date of departure in the back of my head for decades had been 22 March, 2022 - 1 day after our 25th anniversary. I am happily married to Marjolein and we have two daughters, Lobke (2003) and Maartje (2005).
Generally aiming for summiting Katahdin: 28 September, 2022. - in honour of my father whose birth date is 28 September 1930.

This gives me 190 days to cover the approx. 2.195 miles between Springer Mountain and Katahdin. Starting out in March, Georgia may still give me a couple of really cold days, but one is walking towards spring which should provide a really cool experience.",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632390,"I love it when a plan comes together. I am sticking to the plan of starting my hike on March 22, 2022. It may turn out that my eldest, Lobke, will be doing volunteer work in Florida at the time my hike commences. It would be grand to look her up with the whole family and then proceed to Springer Mountain where they can send me off for the big walk. This is subject to Lobke getting through her school exams in May 2021 and of course to how the COVID pandemic affects life in the US in the second half of 2021.

 

All in all it feels like I’m getting close to actually walk the talk. I truly hope I can.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Tue",0
Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642587,I booked my flight to Atlanta. Arrival on 23 March around 2.30 PM. Eventhough the COVID-related travel ban is still in place as we speak (August 2021) I am hopeful this will be lifted before long. As I am vaccinated I do not see big issues getting into the States come March. This is so exciting! Update on volunteering in the US by my eldest as per my previous post: this has been delayed due to the travel ban... Maybe sometime later.,,View Entry,"Aug 18, Wed",0
Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644405,"Whoop whoop! Finally the US is opening up again, at least to vaccinated peeps from Europe. Great news! Also because I took a bit of a chance beforehand by booking my ticket to Atlanta on March 23rd, one day shy of six months from today. Incredibly exciting... Now all I need to do is wait and stay in reasonable shape. Preparing the team of my brewery/bar for a prolonged period without me will take some effort, no doubt. But all in all I can consider myself blessed with the support I am getting from them and most importantly from the girls at home (Marjolein is my kindergarten sweetheart and wife, Lobke and Maartje are our daughters). Blessed. Perhaps one of the most profound insights is available before having set a single step on the trail. But then again, this is one that became clear a long time ago.
Just wanted to share this happy moment with you all. I guess I'll be back before long with a few pre-hike entries. Cheers!",,View Entry,"Sep 22, Wed",0
Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645870,"Easily the most discussed on hiker Facebook groups and YouTube channels is the topic of gear and more in particular the weight of it. Being a novice, I took full advantage of all the experience and knowledge that fellow hikers are sharing so willingly. Luckily, also in this department there is room for the HYOH (Hike Your Own Hike) principle. My pack complete with all gear but without food & drink will weigh 12.5 kilograms (just over 27 Lbs). A bit on the heavy side, which is due mainly to my 2 person tent (MSR Elixir 2) and old fashioned but very comfortable big (70 liter) Tatonka backpack. Together these alone account for 5.27 kg (11.5 pounds). In the days of early thru hikers, this would have been ridiculously lightweight. In 2022 however, the tables have turned and I feel sort of an excentric... I ought to be shaving ounces but frankly can't be bothered too much. The comfort combined with affordability will weigh but all in all I suppose the balance will be okay. I'll do my best to put up a comprehensive list in the gear section. That will keep me busy during the next lockdown that we are dreading out here in the Netherlands. Let's hope for the best.",,View Entry,"Nov 24, Wed",0
Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646053,"The countdown has started in earnest now. Down to double digits, time seems to be speeding up. On the visa front no further news, keeping my fingers crossed that the end of February interview at the Consulate in Amsterdam will proceed. On the gear front all is quiet, I ordered my last big item last weekend, this is a poncho designed for hikers/backpackers called the packa. From all reviews I thought this would be a welcome addition that will hopefully keep me and my pack dry in all those rainy days that are no doubt coming my way. Wishing you all a wonderful festive season :)

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647120,"Whoop whoop! This morning my visa application was approved. That was the last thing that needed to be arranged. My start date is fixed at 23 March, flight is booked as well as Ron's shuttle that will take me from REI at Sandy Springs to Amicalola that same day. Next day begins with the apprach trail to Springer. I cannot wait, soooo happy this is all working out!
Now it's counting down to 20 March when we celebrate our 25th anniversary and then I'm ready to head out. Next post will probably be from the trail already. I'll try to make entries every couple of days. For those wishing to follow my progress on the map: www.polarsteps.com/dut

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647945,"Flew in on the 23rd as planned, all went well. Ron Brown delivered me and a few other hopefulls to Amicalola around 5:30 PM, so registering and starting Approach Trail was set for 24 March. Registering was easy but took some time. The Approach Trail was not at all easy and took aot of time 🙂. Guess that's what i signed up for. It was beautiful out there with lots of sunshine to top things off. Made an early stop at Black Gap Shelter so as to have a quiet stay (expected Springer to be busy) and an early start next day.","Amicalola

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647948,"Had an early start and made it to Springer just before nine an guess what? I had the place to myself 🙂. And with another cloudless day the view could not have been any better. Trail name should be Lucky Bastard. Rest of the day was easy hiking compared to yesterday, ended up at tha Hawk Mountain Campsite, just a mile or so short of the shelter. Good choice! Close to the trail and featuring bear vault, privvy and water source. Happy camper here!","Black Gap Shelter

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647953,"Getting used to early starts. They suit me as I don't sleep very well yet. But pulling into camp mid afternoon every day so far gives me plenty of rest to take on a new day of hiking. Again so this day. With a little apprehension for Sassafras Mountain I must confess. But that wasn't nescessary. Lovely (allthough very chilly) ascent rewarded with great views and a simple luch at the summit. I carry sausages from home still, put them on a whole weat tortilla and drown it in mayonaise. Very nice 😋. 
On to the planned stop for the night which was Gooch Gap Shelter. Came in early, around 2 PM but kept my promise to myself to take it easy and put up the tent. Plenty of room. Not so much at 5 PM; fully packed. There are a lot of folks out on the trail, certainly in the weekend. Doesn't feel that way when hiking though, which is a good thing. 
Hoping to get to a hostel Tomorow for WiFi, Meal and Bed, in that order of importance.","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647958,"The early start got me to Woody Gap at 10:30 AM. Found a gentleman in the parking lot who told me how to walk the 1.4 miles to the hostel.  No phone service so betting against hope they have a vacancy. Got there and got super friendly reception by Nimrod. They were full but I was wel ome for a nice hot cup of coffee and use of the WiFi. And it got better. As I was sitting taking care of business after talking to my wife (which was soooo good) he told me he had a spot available in the overflow, so here I am, maki g full use of the services of Nimrod and Lucky. Had a lovely shower, can of coke, snacks, laundry done. And almost ready to join dinner. This is again a lucky day. The trail is providing in abundance now, I will be ready for the days of less luck but for niw I enjoy all of it to the fullest. 
I have some issues with getting my phone connected to the US branch of T-Mobile (so much for thinking they operate asva professional global company), so my entries will come in batches every four to six days I guess.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648070,"After a wonderful stay at Above the Clouds (highly recommended!!) I got dropped off at Woody Gap by Lucky. Well fed and rested, I decided to take on a bit more than originally planned. There is no camping between Jarrard Gap and Neels Gap unless you have a bear cannister. I don't have one, decided on an Ursack. So original plan was to camp nead Jarrard but being all ready I figured I'd go past Neels Gap and hence join the 75% of prospective thru-hikers still on trail. That worked out well. The hike was not super hard and ended at Bull Gap, a camping spot with no facilities except a small spring at a nice walking distance of .2 miles down. Beautiful spot where at the fire ring I made the acquaintance of Dominic, Pirate and Dusty, all very nice people. I now go by the trail name of Heineken by the way... Dutch guy, brewery owner, wearing green puffy. Makes sense I guess and I kinda like it.","Woody Gap

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648073,"The title of this entry might suggest that there is a ranking in trail magic. I will get back on that issue. But first the new day of hiking. Again shooting for the higher end of recommended mileage in the first couple of weeks but that's just how it plays out. Not because I want to go to the limit but simply practicsl, also because of the weather forecast. Wednesday 30 is expected to be tricky wirh storms and rain and I would rather postpone that experience. The way to do that is to get off trail on Wednesday and hitch to Helen, GA. A good point in the middle to aim for today is Low Gap at 10.4 miles. So that's what I went for. Good hike, grey start but clearing up soon enough. Along the way I passed one of those spectacular views that seem to sneak up on you and than suddenly present themselves. Awesome. Got to make a picture of a friendly couple and the returned the favour. I'll try to upload the picture later, probably once I'm having the use of a computer. Anyways, the hiking was good eventhough I start noticing little pains here and there. This trail is no joke an the 55 y/o body does take some hits. Nothing to worry about though. Coming down a mountain I meet a guy on his way up, he says: 'magic down there!' And so there was. Wow! Hot chocolate, ham & cheese sandwich grilled, donuts, soda's, personal care products, you name it. It was overwhelming. The even had a box of brand new, hand knitted hats, made by the parish they were representing. I was presented one with the colors of the Dutch flag. Thank you lovely people from Bethlehem, GA. Coming back to my starting remark: this trail magic comes in all sorts, but the value just in ine: the sincerity with which it is being administered. For me so far two out of two. Lone Doc Holiday at Springer parking is just as dear to me as this fantastic display of love in the name of God we had today. After the magic a good few miles finished at Low Gap Shelter, lovely spot at the stream. Happy camper 🙂","Bull Gap
",Low Gap,"Mar 29, Tue",10.40
Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648314,"Yesterday Iat Low Gap I met Morten, a Danish guy who recognized me from Facebook. We talked for a bit and discussed how to best escape the rainstorm coming in Wednesday evening. We agree on splitting a hotel room in Helen. And so we start at 08:45 for the hike to Unicoi Gap from where we will try to hitch a ride into Helen. We make good time first half of the day. After the brake Morten takes off on his own speed and I have a hard time keeping acceptable speed. When I arrive at Unicoi, Morten had arrived there 40 minutes previous. On the parylit, an old camper is parked, and the guy in it serves icecream to all the get out of the woods. I forgot his official trailname but he's also known as the icecreamguy. That was the best tasting icecrem I've had in a long long time! We get talking a bit, he has been doing this for a number of years and sort of follows the herd north. Amazing. And to top things off, he offers the group gathered aroun the camper a ride into Helen. Now that was a ride I will not easily forget. AC/DC's Highway to Hell from the soundsystem and a merry group of six hikers crammed into the living space. Thank you so much Icecreamguy 🙂🙂🙂. Morten and I check in to the Quality Inn, get some groceries and after cleaning up go discover Heken which is kind if a Bavarian town but luckily they do serve a good burger and pour great Ipa's. Lovely day and lying down in a real bed is a blessing.","Low Gap

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648315,"After the world's most pityful breakfast at the otherwise very nice Quality Inn we try to hitch a ride into Unicoi Gap. Shuttles are hard to come by and rather expensive ($45) so we try the good old thumb. Not as easy as I would have hoped for but after about 20 minutes a guy driving a truck from the Natural Resources dept. stops and picks us up. Thanks buddy! On the way he tells about his own experience on his attempt in 2003 if I remember correctly. From his first 21 days on trail 20 were filles with rain, sleets and snow. How different things are for us. Lots to be thankful for, not least the weather. After we get dropped off, we meet a few people who had spent the night in the woods. Judging from their experience we made the right choice to get off the trail, it's been a rough night. We start the day with a gruesome ascent which normally would have been hard, but with all resupplies in the backpack is sooo hard...  After the hard climb, the trail doesn't get any easier, it is a struggle to get to the planned destination of Addis Gap. When I get there I am the first to put up a tent. Straight after that I crash in my tent. I hear others setting up camp as well but cannot get the energy together to even open my tent and say hi. I make a few tortilla's with cheese and obscene amounts of mustard, write my paper journal and go to sleep at 7 PM. Pfew.","Unicoi Gap

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648317,"Cold morning again. Makes breaking up camp a bit hard. Wearing gloves while taking down the tent is not the best, but that's what it is.. I start my hike on the cold and windy side of the mountain. After an hour and a half I came to a blue blaze trail to a water source and took that. Out of the wind, full in the sun, such a comfortable and beautiful spot, I decide on an early lunch. Tortilla's with tuna, brought from home and one spicy tuna the I got at Dollar General in Helen. Add liberal amounts of mayonaise en enjoy 😋. That really helped me get into the right groove for hiking the remainder of the day. I also decided to be a bit less careful with filtering water. When it comes straight out of the mountain I simply fill my bottle and drink. Nothing better!Underway I saw I had cell service and made video calls with my eldest daughter Lobke followed by a video call with my wife Marjolein who was snuggled up the couch with my youngest daughter Maartje. Very good to see and hear them, heartwarming.The terrain was hard again and I eglad to reach the shelter. And a beauty it was. Plumorchard Gap Shelter is pretty. For the first time since starting the trail I sat at the table in front of the shelter together with others to cook and eat. I have been keeping to myself till now just to get rest and solitude. At home I am the owner of a micro brewery with taproom. Very nice life but usually quite busy on the social end. I enjoy the peace and quiet that the trail offers but now feel I am ready to interact more with my fellow hikers. Joining the table was a good idea, it was a nice bunch of people and lovely end of a full day.","Addis Gap

And today is my turn to make that picture...! It is a difficult hike but the weather again is awesome. When I get to the sign I am elated and emotional to touch it and take the selfie. Georgia gave me a good send off. Thank you for some awesome hiking Georgia, I hope to see you again sometime.North Carolina welcomes hikers with some next level climbing too. Early in the afternoon I was beat and wanted to stop at the first available campsite. But then the trail levelled out and became a smooth rolling path, I just had to keep on goi g, this was bliss! And then, at Deep Gap where I was planning to camp, there was a huge tent, American flag, smell of BBQ and a sign indicating Trail Magic. This was just too good to be true. And so it was. They were out of most everything. Ah well, I was quite happy with my day as it was, and got to down a bottle of orange juice as a bonus. All is good. Hiked another mile to get to the next shelter, campground was pretty full so had to make do with a not so level spot but was tired enough to get a good sleep anyways.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648321,"I am getting into the habit of starting late. Today I am out of camp at 09:40. I'd taken the time to eat a proper breakfast of tortilla's (peanut butter one one, cheese mustard on the other) and sour neon worms and milky ways. Delicious and good foundation for a day of hiking. And what a day.Sunny, good terrain with doable elevation gain and loss. The trylead through tunnels of rhododendron and at point was lined with krumholz, just so amazingly beautiful and peaceful. As a bonus we also get the sun covered views. It makes me speechless at times. Dinner is fine dining. Morten, who will be way ahead now, had left me with a packet of mashed Idaho potatoes. Mixed with slices of sausage it made for a feast. Another gem of a day on the Appalachian Trail.","Standing Indian Shelter

Dut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648323,"Early start this morning, pumped to get into Franklin. Luckily had phone service so could arrange accomodation at Gooder Grove Hostel in Franklin. Talked to owner Zen who would shuttle me from Rock Gap. Lovely walk, felt easy all the way except for the climb up Albert Mountain. My first really rocky climb. Not easy but it went well all the same. I feel I gained a fair bit of power over the days on trail. On top of the mountain is a fire tower which I climbed. It offerered fantastic views 360. Beautiful! The tower also marks the first 100 miles. Check! Then on to Rock Gap where I was hanging with two ladies, one section hiking a bit with her friend who was doing a thru. And the was a guy doing magic. Not trail magic but the kind that keeps you wondering 'how on earth..' Nice guy. Then Zen came and picked me up, we got to the hostel where I saw a few friendly and familiar faces. Got a nice hot shower, dressed in a clean set of clothes and went to take advantage of the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company. Hooked up with a bunch of lovely people and had good beers and food. Back at the hostel I met Spiderman with whom I had started the Approach Trail on the 24th. Had a nice chat and decided to top off the day at Margherita's, a great Mexican restaurant in down town Franklin. Good idea, very enjoyable company and filled up with food and Margherita as I have seldom been before.  What a day.","Betty Creek Gap
