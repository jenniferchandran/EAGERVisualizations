Fighting Fitz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471964,"So, this is my first of many (I hope) entries. At the moment I am sitting onboard an aircraft carrier in Japan. I am planning on separating from the military after 14 years of active duty, and A LOT of deployments. In my 14 years of Naval service I have only spend 3 of those years stationed in the United States. Needless to say, I am burned out and I just miss the States. So, my plan is to do a thru hike of the AT as a way to decompress from all these years and all this stress. I have been thinking about it non stop lately. I have been doing a lot of research into every aspect of this hike. I am excited. I need this and want this more than anything. I am sitting here only days away from yet another deployment. No complaints here as this is my job and this is something that I know must be done. But I would much rather be home doing final preparations for my hike. A very quick synopsis on who I am and how I came to enjoy hiking. I joined the military in 2001. My first meeting with my recruiter was literally on 9/11. I left the following December, went to school to became a bomb technician and was sent to Japan onboard the USS Kitty Hawk. I did several deployments with them. I left and was stationed in Virginia for a year then went back to Japan for a couple more years and a couple more deployments. I left Japan and went to Iraq where I was part of a QRF unit. After leaving there I went to New Hampshire as a recruiter. Did that for a couple years before they made me a Navy SEAL/SWCC Scout where I prepared young men and women for Navy Special Warfare/Special Operations. It was there, while living in NH that I started to get into hiking. I always enjoyed camping as a kid but never on this level. I started with hiking in the White Mountains. But of course all good things come to an end so I once again found myself being sent overseas and doing some more deployments, which is where I am now. It sucks because there isnt much outdoors stuff I can do here in Japan. I can climb Mt Fuji which may sound cool to someone not living in Japan but that place is way too mainstream. You have to WAIT IN LINE to climb the mountain. Its just not that great. Well, I know this was long winded but again its my first. I will post here from time to time until I really start getting deep into my preparation and hike. Hope anyone reading this has a great day!",,My first entry,"Aug 28, Thu",0
Fighting Fitz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493460,"So, my plan to do the AT has been canceled for now. I was intent on doing it next year after my military service has come to an end. Well, that will be put on hold. I will finish out my 20 so I can retire then do the hike. I have 6 years left so the way I see it is I just have more time to prepare. I have done a few hikes since I last posted. Did a couple in Guam and one in Australia (NT) near Alice Springs.","My first entry

Fighting Fitz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493461,"So, I am currently in San Diego for some military schooling. Found what seems to be a great place to hike. I will be leaving in the morning (early) to spend the day there hiking. Hopefully this place is as nice as everyone is saying and the pictures are showing!","My first entry

Fighting Fitz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573544,"So, I am still waiting to start my hike. Currently I am still stationed abroad (Japan to be exact). I recently experienced a horrific accident while at sea. I am stationed onboard the USS Fitzgerald. If you don't know what happened you can google it as their are hundreds of articles. I was starting to lose motivation to do the hike. Not because I am lazy or anything but I got sick of waiting and thinking about it since I cannot start until 2021 the earliestÂ (the year I retire from the Navy). However, I was in the berthing compartment (place on the ship we sleep in) that received the most damage. I had seconds to get out or I would not have made it out alive. 7 of my shipmates including 2 Sailors that I directly led perished. I now have a reason to do this hike. I will hike the AT start to finish in honor of these 7 that made the ultimate sacrifice. I wont be doing this hike for me I will be doing it for Gary, Xavier, Shingo, Dakota, Carlos, Noe, and Truong.","None
