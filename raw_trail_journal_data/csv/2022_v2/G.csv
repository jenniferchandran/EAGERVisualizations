Up early at 4am to catch the flight from FL to Harrisburg, PA. Got an Uber to Duncannon, PA and a fuel canister at the local outfitter. At 145 I was walking the trail through town. It’s about a 2 mile road walk through town, including bridges over the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers. From there the trail headed up for 2 miles to get to the ridge. There were rocky spots on the climb but overall not bad. The next 7 miles went along the ride line. Again, there were some rocky sections but not as bad as I expected. Pennsylvania is notorious for its rocks so I expect it to get much worse. Views were limited due to low hazy clouds. 
I arrived at the shelter just before 7. I only saw 2 hikers today but there are about 15 here. This is a big shelter with a loft. The weather was nice today but overcast. The forecast for tonight is some light showers. Dinner was a freeze dried meal of chicken pasta in a white sauce. Quite good. The water for this shelter is a quarter mile down steep stone steps. When I asked another hiker, trail name Bread, how long it takes, he offered me some of his already filtered water. Many thanks. 
Tomorrow I hope to go 18 miles to a shelter. I think most hikers here tonight will do the same. That’s a long ways for my day 2 but there’s only 1 climb and it doesn’t look steep. It may depend on the rocks. 
Until tomorrow.","Duncannon, PA

It was a noisy night in the shelter last night. Plus, one hiker had a dog that growled at everyone that went to the privy during the night. It rained lightly at midnight for about an hour. In the shelter it sounds loud like it’s pouring but there were no puddles in the morning. 
Most people were stirring by 6 as its light at about 530. It was a bit chilly and I didn’t really want to get out of the sleeping bag. At 615, I got up, packed up, took out 2 breakfast bars to eat while hiking and some snacks, and was hiking at 630. 
The trail today was great throughout. It started with a relatively flat 5 miles. Unfortunately, everything was socked in again. The forecast called for showers at 8 and that’s what happened. Only 5 minutes. And, I already had my rain jacket on for warmth. 
After the 5 miles the trail dropped about 800 feet to PA 325. There was a former thru hiker and his wife giving out trail magic. I grabbed a banana and a root beer (odd combination and, no, they don’t taste good together). I chatted with them and some other hikers and moved on. Thank you. 
The trail then climbed about 1100 feet over 3.3 miles. It wasn’t a bad climb. From there, it was 8.5 miles of some of the flattest and easiest trail of the 1180 I have hiked. There were plenty of rocks but they were spaced far enough apart to keep up a decent pace. With about 2 miles to camp my energy began crashing. I had a snack but it didn’t help much. I rolled in to the shelter at 315. This shelter is small, holding maybe 6.  I had hoped it was a larger shelter and I would stay in it. I think most of the folks from last night planned to reach this shelter. It will be packed. So, I set up my tent on a nice bluff 100 yards back up the shelter trail. I went back to the shelter to get water and eat my first dinner, tuna pack on a tortilla. I needed that. Later I’ll make a freeze dried meal. It’s just me tented so far in this spot but it’s early. There was a great campsite just before the shelter turnoff next to a creek with a small waterfall. Tempting, but I’ll stay where I am. 
Tomorrow is supposed to be perfect weather. Maybe I’ll get some views. I plan to go 17.5 miles with only 2 moderate climbs.

An uneventful night last night. I slept in my tent and got good sleep. Asleep by 830 pm since I was told in the morning a couple showed up at 9, set up their tent, then took it down and moved. I never heard them. I was up at 6, packed up and headed out at 645. 
There were only 2 climbs today. An easy 400 footer then later a 1000 foot steep climb. The morning was easy with a gradual descent. At the bottom was a beaver dam. Some boards and sticks had been laid out to make it passable. I got across without getting wet. But, I could see how someone could slip in and get soaked. Luckily the creek was low.
From there it was up the smaller hill. There were a few views through the trees on this mostly sunny day. Then a long down into Swatara Gap on over Swatara Creek. Then up a dirt road and under I-81 to the big climb. It was tough and rocky and took over an hour. After the climb the rocks continued in force. Some sections were large rocks and you could step from rock to rock. Most were small and pointy. I’ve now got blisters on the back outside of each heel. I think as my foot rolls on the rocks my feet are rubbing on the shoes. One blister is taped and stopped hurting and the other is starting. I’ll have to tape them up in the morning. After the rocks, the trail became a speedway. No rocks and basically flat. Awesome. A few views at the end.
For the last 4 miles I walked with Ness and G Money who I’ve passed a few times. We talked most of the way. Good guys. When we made it to the road near the shelter, G Money was done with his hike and had to wait for his buddy so he took Ness to his hotel in Pine Grove and I got a McDonalds milk shake and a Gatorade. He then took me back to the trailhead. Trail magic #1.  
The 501 shelter for tonight is more like a cabin, enclosed and a caretaker.  There’s a few hikers here. After a bit a young couple came by and said there was trail magic at the parking area.  Random Adventure 2.0 had a whole setup and made grilled cheeses, had sodas and packets of food for hikers to take. He has a YouTube channel if you’re interested. Thank you Random, it was awesome. Trail magic #2. 
Theres 4 staying here (so far). I have a lower bunk an expect to be out early. It was a good but tough, long day. The next 2 days call for rain. Hopefully it’s not heavy when going over the rocks.

The weatherman got it right again. The rain started at 5am and continued all day. Never too hard, just a steady cold rain. I was up at 6, packed up, had a breakfast bar, stuffed a snack in my pocket and was on the trail by 645. There were only 2 small climbs today. With the low clouds and rain there was nothing to see. Didn’t take a single picture. It was a ‘Put your head down and walk’ kind of day. So that’s what I did. Also, with the rain, I wanted a spot in the shelter in 15 miles. 
The trail was about 60/40 of rocky areas versus smooth cruising areas. I was fast on all of them. The pointy rocks are getting to my feet and causing blisters. 
I arrived at the shelter at 1245. By far my fastest day averaging 2.5 mph. There was a .3 mile side trail to the shelter which sucks, but it is what it is. No one was here when I arrived so my plan worked. I got into dry clothes and hung up the wet stuff. I doubt it will dry much. I’m now in my sleeping bag trying to stay warm. 
I had hoped to get a room for Saturday night in Hamburg, PA but that does not look like it’s going to happen. Who knew Hamburg was such a happening place? Instead I will try to get a bunk at a hostel on Sunday night. I hope that works out or I’ll have to get creative. 
The current plan is to go to the next shelter tomorrow, about 15 miles, in the all day rain. There is a nearly vertical drop into Port Clinton, PA which should be interesting in the rain.

Wet. Cold. Miserable. That’s the story of the day. It rained all night, hard some of the time. The temperature dropped to the mid forties and the wind picked up. I was able to stay warm in my sleeping bag, luckily. 
I stayed in the shelter with 2 guys from the previous night. We were all up and packing at 6. Putting on my damp cold clothes was an unpleasant experience. I was moving before 7. It was raining hard and was cold. It was under 9 miles to Port Clinton, PA. Once I got there I would evaluate my situation. I really don’t have clothing appropriate for these conditions and I was so wet my clothes would not have dried at all in the next shelter. Other than one steep but short climb, the first 7+ miles were flat, with the usual Rocksylvania rock fields. However, the trail in many places was a lake or river. I tried to avoid the deep spots but after a while it just didn’t matter. Due to the weather, I never stopped for more than a minute or I would have frozen. I did get cold a few times but had a snack while walking and that helped. I then got to the big 1000 foot drop into town. It was about 30% grade and we were warned it would be a slippery muddy mess. It wasn’t bad at all and I breezed down, across the railroad yard and into the metropolis of Port Clinton. Other than a candy store, there’s not much here. 
I had decided I would find a place to stay and was able to get a motel room in Shartlesville. Hamburg, which is close, has one hotel always booked up. I’m sharing the room with Lost Man, one of the guys at the shelter last night. He couldn’t stop shivering and had to get out of the cold. 
I had the taxi driver stop at Walmart so I could get some resupply items. I moved my hostel stay from Sunday to Monday. We ate at the only restaurant in Shartlesville. Home style foods that was quite good. We now have the heat on and our wet clothes stacked on the vents to dry. 
We hope to get back to the trail before 9 and go about 16 miles to an enclosed shelter. The weather is supposed to be cool but dry and sunny in the afternoon.

What a difference a day makes. We were able to get everything dry, or close enough on the shoes. I slept great in the bed at the lovely Motel 6.  Back to the Blue Mountain Restaurant for breakfast. It was the usual breakfast fare but lots of it for a good price. Our ride showed up at 815 to get us back to Port Clinton and I was walking by 830.
As always coming out of town, the trail went up. About 950 feet in 2.2 miles. It was not a bad climb. Once at the top the trail got rocky but it didn’t last long. It was then some ups and downs for a while until reaching Windsor Furnace. This is an area that was the site of a furnace of some kind in the late 1700s. 
I thought about going to the shelter for a rest but it was .2 off trail. Nope. Lost Man caught me while I was resting and we climbed to Pulpit Rock together. Finally, on the 6th day there was a good view. We could see to the NE where we’ll be in 4 days, Delaware Water Gap. Leaving there it was across the extremely rocky ridge line to The Pinnacle. The views here were even better. We could see well into NJ. 
After the views it was 5.4 easy miles mostly on old service roads. The only issue was there was a lot of water on the road coming off the mountain or right out of the ground. I guess 2 days of heavy rain will do that. I managed to stay dry.
I rolled into Eckville Shelter just before 4. This is an enclosed bunkhouse ‘shed’ with a caretaker’s house. Water and toilets on site. It’s a nice setup. Since there’s water, I made my Chicken Pho dinner. It uses 3.3 cups of water that I don’t have to filter. 
Things feel good overall except the blisters on both heels. I’ve never had blisters except on my 2 hikes in PA. All the foot rolling on the rocks must be doing the damage. Tomorrow I’ll try my other pair of socks and moleskin. Lukotape and duct tape have not worked. 
The plan for tomorrow is to go 11+ miles to a hostel. Light resupply and laundry are needed.

Weather today was provided by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce. Perfect. 
The Eckville shelter worked out. Just Lost Man, Silva and me. I’ve now been hiking with them for 4 days. We were up early because we were going to be picked up at noon for a ride to the hostel. I taped up my blisters, packed up and left first and was on trail by 610. The blisters are becoming an issue. More on that later. 
The trail leaves the road and meanders in a low area that still has lots of water from a few days ago. I made it through dry and headed up. It was about a 900 foot climb. It was mostly on an old rocky forest road so the grade wasn’t terrible. Not quite to the high point was Dan’s Pulpit, a very nice overlook with views to the SE. After that came the @&$”@?! rocks. I knew they were due to get worse but today was rough. All shapes and sizes for about 4 miles. They really beat up my feet and enlarged the blisters. At one point it looked like the trail would turn up onto a massive rock ridge with views but that didn’t happen. 
Finally, the rocks subsided and we entered a flat forest service road. That went on for 5 miles and got us to our pickup place. Lynn, the hostel proprietor, picked us up at noon and took us to her place. 
The hostel is her home with an outbuilding and a few rooms upstairs. Very nice place in the middle of wheat fields. She took us to the Wannamakers General Store for light resupply and the New Tripoli Hotel for takeout dinner. She makes breakfast in the morning and will then take us back to the trail. 
The blisters felt better today but one got much bigger. I was able to get some Neosporin ointment, some band aides and a big moleskin pad. Maybe with better treatment I can get them under control. It’s very frustrating since my usual aches and pains feel great. If I can keep them from getting infected I think I’ll be ok. 
I need to make it to Delaware Water Gap before the Post Office closes on Thursday to get my resupply box. I have a reservation at a hotel by the trail for that night as well. So, I hope to go about 20 miles tomorrow. There’s a few gotchas in there. After about 14 miles, there will be a 20 mile dry stretch. The area after Palmerton, PA, particularly the underground water, is polluted from past zinc smelting. So we are not supposed to drink it due to heavy metal content. It shouldn’t be a big issue but needs to be considered. I expect most of those miles to be rocky. Yay!

A big day. Lynn at the hostel had breakfast ready at 7. Pancakes, eggs, bacon and OJ. Hiker staples. This was an excellent stay and I would recommend it to all hikers. We were in her car and dropped off at 745. The trail was mostly level today with one big exception. It started with 2 flat rock free miles. A nice way to begin. Then the rocks started. There was a nice overlook back towards the hostel. The I came up to Knifes Edge. This is a s about 100 yards long of huge granite slabs stacked on each other at 45 degree angles. Really not much to it (as long as you don’t fall). Good views if you are careful. It was then rocky for miles. Included in that was Bake Oven Knob, a jumble of large rocks I climbed. At the top is another nice overlook. 
I stopped in to the Bake Oven Knob Shelter for a snack. This was the poorest maintained shelter I have seen on the trail. Even the picnic table was rotted with holes in it. I didn’t stay long. 
To make it even more fun, there was only one water source available today. 
The trail continued to be rocky until the George W. Outerbridge Shelter. This one too was a dump. But it did have the lone spring. I topped off my bottles as well as filled my bag with 2 more untreated liters. From here there is no water for 16 miles due to past zinc smelting in Palmerton. After dinner I have over a liter to get me 11 miles tomorrow.
After that shelter, the trail gets interesting. About a mile down we crossed the Lehigh River then a PA highway. Then the climb out of Palmerton. It started very steep on gravel and was hot. It soon turned to rock climbing where hands were needed. In a few places if you leaned back your pack weight momentum may have sent you over the edge. There were boulder and scree fields to cross. Finally a steep climb to reach the summit and ridge. It was a 900 foot climb over 1.3 miles. Some spots were 30% grade. I usually find that comments in journals exaggerate the difficulty of most features. Not this one. It was hard and the real deal. 
After the summit we had 2 easy miles on old roads. Then the rocks showed up in force for the final mile. 
I got to the campsite first and there was a couple we’d seen at Eckville Shelter already set up. Lost Man arrived about 15 minutes later. 3 other thru hikers also arrived. Silva decided to stay at the last shelter. 
My blisters were good for a while. After all the rocks and constant foot rolling, they really hurt. However, on the bright side, they don’t infected or to have gotten bigger. In Delaware Water Gap I will get some sock liners. Maybe that, and less rocks, will help. 
Tomorrow is almost all flat but I expect plenty of rocks. There are few water sources and fewer listed camp spots. I need to get into the Gap as early as possible on Thursday to get my resupply and get to the outfitter. That will partly determine how far to go Wednesday.

Sometimes you think to yourself ‘Why do I do this?’ Today was one of those days. 
The sun starts lightening the sky before 5. I woke at 450 and tried to sleep some more. It was not going to happen. I started packing before 6 and was ready to go by 630. Lost Man wasn’t ready yet so I headed out. Lack of water would be an issue today.
First I headed down into Little Gap.  Then up a bit on the other side. The trail was all rocks. I figured like other days there would be rock free stretches. I was wrong. Many times I kept thinking the rocks would abate. I was wrong. The trail leveled off for 15 miles and it was all rock. Mostly pointy, ankle breaking loose rocks. My feet, and particularly the blisters did not like it. We were able to get plenty of water after 13 miles at a shelter. I took 4 (heavy) liters with me. 
Finally we reached Wind Gap. To our surprise the trail down was more ‘normal’ than any time today. After a short road walk under a highway we started the climb. It was hot out and the climb faced the sun. I had 3 liters of water left. It was a tough 900 feet but the trail was good. Once at the peak the rocks came back in force. They never stopped for the remaining 3.5 miles. Rocksylvania has shown herself today. 
Lost Man and I found a campsite. It took us longer than expected to find flat ground. While setting up, we realized there is a spring here. There’s one task we don’t have to do tomorrow. 
The blister situation is about the same. No better no worse. 
The rocks really wear you down: both physically and mentally. I’m tired. It’s 730 and I could fall asleep. 
Our long day today makes tomorrow that much easier. It’s 12 miles to town with no big climbs. I know the rocks will be eager to welcome us to their forest.

Up early as usual. Packed up quick, ate a couple of breakfast bars and was walking before 7. Of course the first few miles were as rocky as ever and very slow going. But then a strange thing happened. The forest nymphs or fairies created a smooth soft trail of dirt for almost 2 miles. It truly was magical. But all good things must end and the rocks returned. There were a few small rocky up and downs. The trail eventually became a forest road for about 2 miles taking me to the drop off to the Delaware River. Although not up to nymph and fairy quality trail, it was still nice. 
The decent into town reminded me of the descents in GA or NC. Steep but well maintained and easy to move on. There were a few nice views on the way down. Finally the trail entered the town of Delaware Water Gap. My hotel, The Deer Head Inn, is right on the trail. Too early to check in, though. 
I went to the post office to get my resupply box; easy peasy. I went back to the hotel porch and organized my food. I have too much. I then walked to the outfitter and got some sock liners. Maybe they’ll help with the blisters. 
At 3 I checked in, got a shower and a nap. There’s a restaurant in the hotel. It is the oldest continuously running jazz club in the US. Who knew?  I ate, had a couple of beers and listened to the music. It’s now after 8 and almost time to sleep. 
Tomorrow I’ll enter NJ. It’s supposed to be mellower on the rocks and grades aren’t quite so steep. We’ll see.

Big day today. The Deer Head Inn worked out fine. I was up early as usual and ate some breakfast bars then packed up. I just needed to leave the key in the door and walk away. It was 715 and I was walking down to the I-80 bridge over the Delaware River. Luckily, it has a pedestrian sidewalk with barricades. It was loud with mostly semis speeding by. I got the obligatory picture of the state line. It then curves down to a local road and eventually under I-80 and into the Dunnfield Creek trailhead. This creek is heavily protected as it is very clean and a key spawning area for brook trout. 
My plan was to meet Lost Man later as I am faster and would catch him. I guess he left early because I never caught him. The trail climbed gradually but continually for 6 miles. Right away I noticed less rocks and those that were there were not ankle killers. Next I went by Sunfish Pond. This is a National Natural Landmark. I didn’t know there was such a thing. The pond is one of the most southerly glacially created ponds in the east. The trail around the pond was very rocky and slow going. The trail sort of meandered along the ridge next with some views to the valley below. NW NJ is very sparsely populated. I got a text from the Appalachian Trail Conference last night about an overly aggressive bear on my path today  when I went by there was a bear trap set up and caution tape to keep people out.  I hope it didn’t wander 10 miles NE.
I next got to the Mohican Outdoor Center. This is an event and gathering place in the backwoods. I suspect folks from the city have gatherings here to get away from the hustle and bustle. They have a grill but I needed to lighten my food bag. I got a couple of sodas and ate lunch. They also had a hiker box (stuff hikers and others get rid of. Oddly, there was a 6-pack of Glide Floss in there. That’s expensive. Why would someone even bring 6 packs of floss to an outdoor center?) I was able to find a roll of some kind of tape to try on my blisters. It was a good start and I think helped. I’ll try again tomorrow.  Next it was 6 miles to my intended campsite where I was to meet Lost Man. After some rocks it was a couple of miles of smooth crushed gravel path. The area of this campsite was intended to be developed for housing but the National Park Service bought it first. I got a text that Lost Man was going on to the next shelter. That was too far for me. I did decide to go on to a campsite 4 miles later. The first mile continued on that smooth path. Then it got very rocky for about a mile. Next I had to climb about a 50 foot rock wall. Needed to use my hands to get to the top. The last mile and a half were smooth crushed gravel. I made it to the campsite before 6. There is a couple here I have seen for a few days now.  I got set up and ate my freeze dried dinner further lightening my pack. 
The rocks were far easier to navigate in NJ so far. They tend to be rounder or flatter. Maybe softer is the right word. There are some sharp ones but that seems to be the exception. It’s very odd that the ‘style’ of rocks can change so quickly and dramatically. It’s only across the river and it changed. 
Also, I saw far more wildlife today than in 10 days in PA. Tons of squirrels and chipmunks, a rabbit, a woodpecker and a very large turkey. In PA I saw 1 deer and 1 small green snake. 
Finally, regarding PA, I am near certain I will never hike on the AT there again. Rewarding views and good terrain are just too few and far between. 
I have no plan for tomorrow. There is a shelter at 16.5 and 19.1. The elevation looks easy so both are options. There may be some showers over the next few days but overall the weather is good.

Today was a very uneventful day. Low clouds most of the day as well as some rain left little to see. 
I was up early as always and headed out before 7. The first few miles were a series of short but somewhat steep up and downs. The terrain was much rockier than yesterday. 
I got to Culver Gap just after 10. There are a couple of decent lunch places there but I was too early so I pressed on. Leaving the gap was the lone long climb of the day. Again, very rocky. At the top was the Culver Fire Tower. The views were ok but not great with the low clouds. 
From there I went to the Gren Anderson shelter to eat lunch. This is where I realized this hike needs to end. The blisters are just too much to deal with and are taking the fun out of the hike. I’d post a picture of the culprits but who wants to see dirty hiker feet?
Now that I decided to end hiking, I needed a plan to get home. There was enough cell coverage at the shelter to make a plan. I packed up and left. I was going to the further of two shelters to get closer to High Point State Park HQ. Hopefully I can get an Uber to a train station. 
Next up was Sunrise Mountain. Near the top a heavy shower came in. I got my pack cover on and my rain jacket. I then went the next 100 yards only to find a nice covered pavilion at the top. I waited out the rain while checking train and plane schedules. 
From there it was 3 rocky miles to the Mashipacong Shelter. I chatted with some hikers for a bit then moved on. The next 2.6 miles to my shelter continued to be rocky. The shelter is .4 miles off trail but there is water down that way. The Rutherford Shelter is a dump. There are signs of mice both on the floor and in the log book. There are 2 birds living in there that didn’t like me eating my dinner in their home. I am tented 50 feet away. On the plus side there is a bear box and a clean privy. It is now raining lightly. Hopefully it stops soon. (It didn’t, and rained lightly most of the night.)
I saw 2 deer, a snake and hundreds of orange newt. 
It’s now 7 and I hear a couple of others roll in. I thought I’d be by myself tonight. 
Tomorrow is just 2.9 miles to the HQ after .4 to get back to the trail. I will head out early to give myself as many options on the train as possible.

I had good cell coverage and began looking for a ride to Port Jervis, NY.  It is less than 10 miles from the park.  I tried Uber and Lyft numerous times but a driver was never found.  I called some taxi companies.  They wanted nothing to do with coming out to the park (isn't that how they make money?). I suppose since it was a Sunday morning this wasn't going to work. When the HQ office opened at 8 the woman working there gave me a number for another taxi company.  Again, same line from them, and rather rude in delivering it.  OK.  I'll try hitching.  I walked the 100 yards over to the road that leads to Port Jervis.  Hustled to get across with my thumb out as I heard a car coming over the rise.  Voila!  The driver stopped and picked me up.  Zero time and no effort.  I'll need to try this hitching thing more often.  The driver, an older gentleman headed to an auto race he was participating in, dropped me at the first road in town after the train bridge.  The station must be close.  It was.  Just a mile down the main street was the platform.  I got there so early I was able to take the 857am train to the Newark airport. I would be there about 1130.  While on the train I booked a flight on United to Orlando.  My family was going to be in Orlando that afternoon.  I got home and was able to shower and soak my feet in Epsom salts.  Everything worked out as planned.  It's amazing that you can be in the woods in the morning and get yourself over 1000 miles home all with the use of your phone.This hike was a mixed bag.  The rocky terrain the whole way was frustrating.  Those 2 days of cold continuous rain started my problems that were not going to resolve without a week or 2 off trail.  As a section hiker, I'm not going to sit around that long.  That's OK.  When there was scenery it was great.  The climbs out of Palmerton and Wind Gap were memorable. The people I hiked with were great, particularly Lost Man and Silva.  Thanks to those that provided trail magic including G Money, Random Adventures 2.0 and others, who I did not get their names.  I had hoped to meet up with a buddy in CT for a few days of the hike.  Maybe in the fall or next year we can make that happen.Until the Next Hike.","Rutherford Shelter

Time for another section heading north. Was up early and got to the airport. First time flying a discount airline in the US. Well, I got where I was going on time so I suppose it was OK. It also flew closest to my start point. I was picked up by my shuttle driver/trail angel George Lightcap at the Stewart/Hudson Valley airport and driven to the park HQ in NJ. I would highly recommend George if you’re hiking in this area. His number is in the Farout app. 
I got myself organized and was walking by 1245. The trail started with a gradual rocky climb up to a viewing platform. There were clear skies today so I could see a long ways. The trail then meanders near to the actual high point of NJ monument. It was early so I decided to climb up the quarter mile off trail to see it. It’s like a miniature version of the Washington Monument in DC. I didn’t stay long. The trail then gradually dropped to the back side of the ridge and the rocks mostly faded away. There were a few rocky areas but they were short. Crossed a bunch of fields, roads and boardwalks (due to low wet ground) and got to my intended destination. The ‘Secret Shelter.’
This shelter is .2 off trail and was built by a former AT hiker to give back to the trail. It’s a small enclosed building that can sleep 4 with space for tents. It also has a resident mule named Jake. He was a bit standoffish today. However, it was only 330 so I continued on. 
It was only 2 miles to the small town of Unionville, NY. There is a small town park hikers are allowed to tent in. I registered in the general store and set myself up. I got a couple of slices of pizza across the street and went back to my home. Someone close by was gunning their motorcycle but it finally stopped. Some kids are playing basketball here as the sun sets. Hopefully things will quiet down soon once it’s dark and the temperature drops. It’s supposed to get down to about 30 tonight. I’m glad I decided to carry the 0 degree bag. 
It was a good first day out. Tomorrow I plan to go about 17 miles to a shelter. In the morning I’ll get a pastry at the general store for breakfast.

Long day for day 2 but there really was no other option. 
The day started at 630. But, at 105 last night I thought we were being invaded. The town’s warning siren went off and it was loud. I waited for people to come out of their houses but nothing happened. I went back to sleep. In the morning at the general store I asked the girl and she thought it was a call for the volunteer fire department. That makes sense. 
The hike started out with a gradual downhill to a road walk and then entered the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. It seemed like a wetland area for migratory birds. It was flat for about 2 miles, always appreciated. I then climbed Pochuck Mountain. This was a surprisingly steep rocky climb of about 900 feet. I had no idea there were mountains this tall in NJ so far east. 
The climb down was uneventful. Next up was the Pochuck board walk. This is a nice fancy board walk through a wetland and is about a mile long. Lots of folks out for a stroll I had to get around. The trail continued on a few more miles relatively flat with lots of locals. Exiting the woods into a cow field I noticed a long line of cars on the upcoming road. It was crazy. There is the Heaven Hill Creamery and they were having their Great Pumpkin Festival. The crowds were overwhelming. I got an ice cream and moved on. 
Next was the climb up Wawayanda Mountain. This one caught me by surprise. It was steep and rocky and long and covered in day hikers. There was a good view near the top down to the creamery. After that the day hikers disappeared. 
From the summit it was a short way to a nice creek to fill up on water. Then to the shelter that has no water. There is one southbound thru hiker here. I did pass a few other SOBOs today. 
I had a freeze dried meal for dinner. It’s now 630, getting dark and cold and I’m tired. My plan for tomorrow is to do a shorter day. Either go into Greenwood Lakes, NY or go to the Wildcat Shelter. 10 or 12 miles. Weather continues to be perfect for hiking.

A short(ish) day today. My shelter mate, Po (from Kung Fu Panda), was up early as he said he would. No problem. I got moving before 7 and was hiking at 730. Last night was not as cold as the previous night. It was incredibly still; no wind whatsoever. 
It was 4 miles to the NY border. The terrain was quite mellow with few rocks and very small ups and downs. It warmed up quickly so the puffy jacket got put away. 
Immediately upon entering NY the trail was rocky and rock slabs for 3.5 miles. There were quite a few places where I needed to use my hands to pull myself up the rocks. There was even a spot with a rebar ladder to climb. I think that is the first so far heading north. After a while the rocks got old and it felt too much like PA. Finally, at the side trail that could lead to Greenwood Lake, the trail left the ridge and the rocks stopped. I cruised the final 2 AT miles. 
After crossing NY17A there is a side trail that leads to Bellvale Farm. Earlier, I had arranged a room in town and a ride from the farm. The ice cream was very good. Much creamier and smoother than yesterday. I called my ride and she arrived in just a few minutes. She is the owner of the motel I’m staying at. The Lake Lodging Motel was good and the folks running it were very nice.  Very hiker friendly.
The small room is perfect for me. I got a shower and asked about food. The owner’s husband was going out so he dropped me at Murphy’s, one of 2 Irish bars in town. The food was good as was the beer. This is a nice little town that seems receptive to hikers. 
Now I’m just relaxing. The motel owners will get me back to the trail in the morning. I hope to get to the Bear Mountain area, just before the Hudson River, Wednesday afternoon. It will take a good push as there seems to be a lot of short but steep ups and downs to get there. Thursday’s forecast has now changed to heavy rain all day. If that looks to be true I may take a zero day (no hiking) on Thursday.

New York is tough! I fell asleep last night before 9pm and woke early. I walked the 50 yards to the Dunkin Donuts for breakfast. The motel owner took me back to the trail at 730. The first mile and a half were wonderful; smooth and rock free. Then NY showed what it really had to offer. The whole day was up and down steep rock walls and along rocky ridges. There were some spots that were close to vertical with small ledges to place feet. It was very tiring. I had to carry a lot of water as things are very dry. It’s heavy but has to be done. I did top off my water bottles from some gallon jugs left near a road; thanks to whoever that was. 
The up and downs continued all day. I entered Harriman State Park in the afternoon. It was a very nice forest with a lot of grasses growing. Very different from most forests. I was feeling real drained in the afternoon. Late in the day I reached the Lemon Squeezer. This is a tight gap between 2 house sized boulders. I had to take my pack off and throw my poles ahead. It wasn’t too bad. Right after that there was an 8’ rock face. I could not figure out how to get up that and took the easy way around. 
I finally arrived at the shelter about 515. Ate dinner, took a wet wipe bath (it was warm today) and hung my food bag on the bear cable. This is sort of a crappy old shelter; no water or privy. So far I am the only one here. Also, it’s not supposed to be as cold tonight. 
Tomorrow I’ll get into Bear Mountain Recreation Area where I have a room for 2 nights. The Thursday forecast continues to be heavy rain and wind all day. I don’t need to hike in that.

What a difference a day makes. The shelter was quiet all night. There were a lot of signs and notices posted about past bear activity around this shelter. Not last night. They did put bear cables here that look pretty new. It surely helps. Bear cables are a simple pulley system that allows hikers to raise their food bag up to about 12 feet. Once the bears determine there’s no food for them they’ll go somewhere else. 
I was up early as usual. Hiking by 715. The first 7 or so miles were easy and light on the rocks. Water is very scarce so I carry 3 liters. I fill up whenever there’s water available. There was only one water source today so I took advantage of it. 
There is a ‘mandatory’ detour recently incorporated into the trail just before the Palisades Parkway. Official detours count as trail miles. Supposedly the traffic is very heavy and fast. I thought about ignoring the detour and staying on the AT but finally gave in. The detour adds just under a mile on some lightly used state trails. When I finally went on the bridge over the Palisades, there wasn’t a car in sight. Oh well. The first 80% of the detour was flat and easy. The last 20% was straight up rock scramble. Finally it rejoined the AT. 
From here it was a long rocky downhill to get to Bear Mountain State Park. There was a long climb once entering the park. In the park all of the ups and downs are on cut stone steps. An incredible amount of work to fit these steps into the small gaps in the rock walls going up must have occurred. There were some great views on the way up showing the foliage colors on the distant peaks. At the top of Bear Mountain is a small tower with 360 degree views. It was very busy at the top so I started down to my destination. Again, wherever the grade dropped there were nice stone steps. It was a long but easy hike down to Hessian Lake. I am staying at the Overlook hotel so had to walk an additional mile. I then had to walk 3/4 mile each way to get dinner at the restaurant at the Bear Mountain Inn. 
Today was tough but nothing like yesterday. There were some tough climbs but not over sheer cliffs. 
Tomorrow I’m not hiking. The weather forecast is still terrible and leaving here has a big straight up climb I don’t want to do in the rain. 
The trail overall has been in excellent condition with only a few blow downs that took some effort to get around. Thanks to all the trail builders and maintainers.

Today was a zero day, no hiking. I was asleep before 9 and slept until 730. I needed it. I wandered over to the grill at the Inn for some breakfast. It was ok. I then went back to my room and lounged around most of the day. I washed some clothes in the sink. I hope they dry. 
The few showers today were light and if it got windy I never noticed. I could have hiked but the rest was needed. 
Around 4 I got an Uber to get some resupply food and dinner. The grocery store was small but I found enough stuff for the next 4+ days. I then got dinner at a local Mexican restaurant. It was good. Getting back was tough. I tried Uber and Lyft for quite a while but no drivers. When I went outside it was now raining and my groceries were in a paper bag. It would have been a horrible 4 mile walk. Yikes!  I finally called a local taxi and it all worked out. 
I don’t think I can recommend this Bear Mountain resort area. There are no stores that are walkable for resupply. The restaurants were good but way overpriced for most hikers. Midweek everything shuts down early. However, there’s not much in Fort Montgomery or Highland Falls either. And the hotels there were double the price of the Overlook. Maybe Peekskill would have been a better option. Live and learn.
Now I’m just organizing my pack so I can basically close the pack and walk out in the morning. 
I’ll walk through the zoo, over the Hudson and straight up Anthony’s Nose. I’ll leave you with that thought.

Great day of hiking. Was asleep last night early and up around 6. I was mostly packed and ready to go. I just needed the sun to come up a bit more. I left at 710 and had to walk back around the lake to the point where the AT leaves the lake. The trail goes in a tunnel under the highway then enters the zoo. After a few lefts and rights I got to the zoo entrance. However, they don’t open until 10. It didn’t dawn on me to check if hikers can always get through. Oh well. Back to the blue blaze trail that goes around the zoo. The problem with going around the zoo is that I won’t get to see a bear on this hike. Are there bears in the woods? 
After the zoo the trail crosses the Bear Mountain Bridge. This is a huge, imposing structure built in the 1920s and for many years provided the only crossing of the Hudson between NYC and Albany. The things you learn by reading those informational boards. 
Next up was Anthony’s Nose (hey, I don’t name the mountains). The elevation profile for this climb looked horrible. It wasn’t that bad, really. Very steep but only about 600 feet. After that the trail had a few small steep climbs but was gentle for the most part. The rocks did come out on the latter half today. 
I stopped in to the Appalachian Market late morning. This is a gas station/convenience store/deli all in one. Busy place. My food bag is stuffed from yesterday’s resupply so I just got a drink and some M&Ms. a sub would have been nice but not needed. 
After that it was uneventful. The hike was in the forest all day so really no views. The morning clouds cleared off after noon and the weather was perfect.  I was able to top off my water bottles a few miles from camp.
I’m now set up at the Dennytown Road camping area. This is part of Fahnestock State Park in NY. It’s a Friday and there are other people, likely locals, already setting up.  It could be a loud night. 
In a little while my fraternity brother Steve V. will be joining me to hike the weekend. The terrain looks gentle and I’ll dial down the mileage so as not to kill him and give him a chance to enjoy hiking. We’ll do about 11 then 12 miles. He doesn’t know my plan yet so I hope it goes well.

Gentle but rocky terrain today. Steve and I were up about 630. It didn’t get quite as cold last night as expected. It was another “Chamber of Commerce” weather day. It took Steve a while to get organized but we were hiking by 8. There is a pump house near the campsite so we were able to top off all our water bottles. 
There were just a few ups today and none were hard. They were rocky though. We were cruising along pretty good in the morning. I tried to let Steve lead and set the pace. He started out strong but I could see the rocky uneven terrain was getting to him. We stopped on trail for some snacks but that didn’t help much. I think the AT was a bit more challenging than he expected. Over a slow afternoon we finally were able to refill our water bottles just before our shelter destination of the RPH Shelter. There were only a couple of overlooks today, otherwise we were in the woods all day with nothing to see  
The RPH Shelter is nice. It has bunks with (thin, old, plastic) mattresses but that’s way better than usual shelters. Lots of space and we’re the only ones here. It’s clean, has books and a garbage can.  The privy was clean and had TP, a real luxury.  There must be a caretaker and that person does a great job.
Steve has decided not to continue. His wife will pick him up here in the morning. But, I’ll give him credit for coming out and giving it a go. I think he learned a lot about what and what not to pack.  His pack needs some adjustments as well. I know things weren’t right but couldn’t figure what was wrong.  I may see Steve when I get to Kent.  It was nice to have some company on the trail.
Tomorrow I’ll make a 3 day push to Kent, CT where I have a (very expensive) room reserved.

Long hiking day. Last night a hiker came in the shelter at 2am and made a lot of noise and had his headlamp on bright. Poor shelter etiquette. I stayed hidden in my bag and chose not to engage him. 
I was up early. Steve’s wife would pick him up at the road right by the shelter at 9. That’s too late for me so I said goodbye and was hiking at 750. 
The trail climbed for 600 feet right away but very gradual. I made the top quickly and easily. It dropped back down then went up a much steeper 500 feet over very rocky ground. After that it was the usual small up and downs the rest of the day. Overall the rocks weren’t too bad. Views were very limited all day. 
Late in the day I got to Nuclear Lake. It’s called that because in 1972, a chemical explosion in a nuclear research lab situated on the lake blew out some windows. It’s possible that some trace amount of radiation leaked. Since it’s supposedly ok to swim in the lake and drink the water, maybe they should return it to its original name. 
I arrived at the Telephone Pioneers Shelter at 4, got set up, ate my freeze dried lasagna and am ready to get in my sleeping bag when the sun sets. There is one guy set up in a hammock here as well.

Nice trail today entering CT. Goodby NY, although the trail will go back and forth between the states along the border for a few more miles. I think I was asleep before 8 last night. It was just me in the shelter and one guy up above in a hammock. I never spoke to him. At about 6 this morning it started to rain lightly as expected. I brought my food bag in as it holds water when wet and I forgot to put a plastic bag over it. I knew today would be a shorter day so took my time packing up. I stopped at the creek on the shelter approach trail to top off my water and was hiking at 820. 
It was another day mostly in woods with no overlooks. The rain continued most of the morning but stayed light. In the woods it sounds loud as the rain hits the leaves then drips from leaf to leaf all the way down. Rocks were minimal with only a few short sections. There were quite a few swampy areas that had planks through the wet areas to help keep your feet dry. However, the planks were very slippery and extreme caution was needed. 
There was a half mile boardwalk through a swampy area that was very nice. Chatted with a guy out for some nature photography. Then the trail went up through some cow pastures where every step had to be watched to avoid land mines. After a good climb and some easy terrain I ate lunch at Wiley Shelter. The rain had stopped finally. 
After some descent and flat ground I climbed 10 Mile Hill. On the way up I ran into a very nice trail maintainer and we chatted quite awhile. I thanked her for the work all the maintainers do and shortly reached the summit. Then it’s under a mile to the shelter. It’s an older style like most around here but this one has a gap from the frame to the sleeping platform. I think that is to keep critters from getting in. 
I arrived at the shelter before 3. I thought of going on to a campsite but it’s almost 6 miles; just too far.   The trail maintainer suggested I stay at the 10 mile campground area just past the shelter and located at the confluence of the 10 Mile River and the Housatonic River.  I considered it but knew light rain was forecast. Shelter it was. Boy, did I get that one right.  At about 730 it poured hard for about an hour.  Then, 2 SOBO flip flop hikers came running into the shelter soaked.
One item I’ve been meaning to comment on is the number and quality of the old stone walls in the forests, mostly in NY. They are everywhere. Some have fallen apart but many are still as they were hundreds of years ago. I believe they were created as boundary lines using the rocks from the fields the landowners were clearing. Some are high up on the mountains. I can’t imagine they were growing things there. Maybe grazing cattle.

CT is tougher than I expected. Was up at about 6 but didn’t get moving until 7. The 2 other hikers were still sleeping and it’s tough to pack quietly in the wooden floor shelters. I stuffed some food in my pocket and was hiking by 730. 
The ground was wet after last nights rain, but few puddles.  All the formerly dry creeks were flowing strong today. The first 1.5 miles the trail meandered near the Housatonic River. It then let out on a road for a road walk. I went right instead up to the Bull Bridge Market. It’s only .2 miles and takes you through one of only 2 covered bridges (this one being Bull Bridge) in CT. I got a danish and a huge iced tea. I also put a little juice in my phone as it was almost empty and my charger is empty also. Back to the trail that did a short road walk and there was a guy moving cattle down the road, probably to a nearby field. 
The trail finally re-entered the woods and began the almost 1000 foot climb up Schaghticoke Mountain. It was tough but the sugary danish and tea powered me through. The terrain continued to be rolling for a few miles after the summit. Then there were 2 tough rocky climbs up unnamed peaks. There were some decent views at the top. The drops from those peaks were very rocky, almost like PA. 
I finally reached the road to Kent and walked the .8 miles into town. I got a sub for lunch, showered, (much needed), laundry done (needed even more), and resupplied. Hiker Steve is going to come by and we’ll go out for dinner and some beer. 
The next stretch is about 55 miles to Great Barrington, MA. I may go into Salisbury, CT if I don’t think my food will last. There also seems to be a few restaurants near trail where I can stop for lunch if the timing is right.

CT is kicking my butt. Today was hard. The Fife & Drum Inn was ok for the night, as well as expensive. Kent is small so everything is close and easy. I was up early as usual. Going to sleep by 9 will do that. Out the door at 730 and I headed to the Villager Restaurant for breakfast. It was good, and reasonably priced, unlike most of Kent. There was a guy eating at the counter like me and he was a talker. I struggled to eat he talked so much. Left there and walked the road back to the trail. 
Things started off with a steep 600 foot climb. It was cold this morning, around 34, with frost on all the grass and soccer fields by the trail. I did get to finally use the gloves I brought. About halfway up the puffy jacket and gloves had to come off. Also, the sun came over the mountains and started warming things up. 
After reaching the top, the trail rolled up and down for 2.5 miles. Then it went straight up to Caleb’s Peak. This was a short but tough climb and descent. Some good views there and then from St. John’s Ledges. Descending from the ledges was straight down over big boulders. Very slow going for 500 feet. 
The trail then meets up with a gravel road and an old service road for 5 flat miles along the Housatonic River. I was looking forward to this easy stretch. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It’s easy hiking and fast, but rather boring and monotonous. The river is nice but always looks the same. In this stretch is a shelter so I stopped in and ate lunch. While there the trail maintainer I talked to 2 days ago came by so we chatted again. 
I finished the flat section and it was another steep 600 foot ascent and a rocky descent. I repeated this 3 more times over smaller hills to finally reach my campsite. Before the third climb I had to cross Guinea Creek  there were warnings that a detour may need to be used to get over it.  I checked it out, and sure enough I couldn’t quite make it across. Off to the 1 mile road detour. Luckily it did cut out some of a tough climb.
I didn’t realize how challenging CT’s climbs were going to be. It seems similar to me of GA and NC on a slightly smaller scale. 
It’s 6pm, I’ve eaten, cleaned up and got in the sleeping bag in the tent. It’s already getting cold out. Might get into the low 30s. I’ll read a bit and probably be out before 9. Hiking life.

I was on trail by 730. As is usually the case, the day started with a cardio workout up an unnamed peak. It wasn’t too bad. Then back down only to climb again up a steep rocky ascent. Just before this climb a work crew was heading up a short way to add/repair some stone steps. I spoke to the leader for a few minutes and thanked him for the work they do. I got a lesson on the problems caused by the Gypsy Moth. For the PC crowd they are now called Spongy Moth. I also thanked the workers as I passed them and wondered when the escalator would be installed. From that summit it was about 6 miles of small up and downs in the woods. Not much to see today. 
I finally dropped down off the mountain, through a field then onto a road walk. The trail took a left down another road but I went straight to the Mountainside Cafe. It’s a farm to table breakfast/lunch place. It was very good. 
Then back down the road to continue the AT road walk. The trail edged its way back into woods and came out a a large hydro power plant. After some more twists and turns I came to Great Falls. It wasn’t so great. I think a lot of the water is diverted for the hydro plant. 
Then the final climb of the day. A 900 foot ascent up Mt Prospect. The guide made it look treacherous but the climb wasn’t that bad. Maybe the big sandwich for lunch powered me through. 
Final stop for today is the shelter. It is .4 off trail with about a 300 foot descent. The thought of climbing out of here in the morning makes me sad. CT does not allow you to just set up camp anywhere you like. The next spot was almost 8 miles and that’s too far when it’s 330 and getting cold. It should get down near freezing again tonight and then a gradual warming trend. 
Hopefully I’ll get to Great Barrington on Saturday. I now have less than 100 miles to go.

So many mountains. The shelter area last night was nice, just too far from the trail. One guy came in late but ended up tenting. It was crystal clear all night. When I went out to pee I hoped to see a shooting star from the Orionids (I think that was the name of it). No such luck. Plus it was too cold to stand around out there. It got down to about 30. My sleeping bag is certainly paying off for its extra weight. 
I was packing by 630 and hiking by 710. The climb out of the shelter area sucked as much as I expected. The first 4.5 miles was mostly downhill and free of rocks. I was flying. The trail comes out to a road walk for about a mile just east of Salisbury, CT. When the trail took a right I went straight into the little village to the bakery. The cinnamon roll, blueberry muffin and hot chocolate were well worth the extra steps. I needed the sugar and calories to power me through. 
Leaving town I walked a different road that met up with the AT. Time to climb. First up was Lion’s Head. This was an 800+ foot ascent. There was a nice view south from the top. There was an 8th grade hiking field trip starting down when I got to the top. Their packs were almost as big as they were, especially since it was for one night out. I’m sure they enjoyed my aroma. From there it was 2 miles of small up and down rolling trail. 
Next up (no pun there) was Bear Mountain. This was a straight up 500 foot climb. I believe this is the tallest mountain in CT, but not the highest point. The descent was tough, all rocks and boulder hopping. 
At the bottom I crossed into MA. CT is done and finished tough. Once in MA the trail goes through Sages Ravine. This is a narrow canyon-like area with a nice stream at the bottom. I noticed that this and subsequent streams were incredibly clear. Certainly clearer than any water sources up to this point. 
Leaving the ravine begins the climb up Mt Race. This was the least steep of today’s climbs but was the toughest. Long! Over 2 miles and rocky. Long sloping granite slabs. However, the views to the east nearing the top were awesome. I haven’t had views that good on this trip yet. At the summit I was able to see to the Catskills to the west and Mt Greylock to the north. The climb down wasn’t bad and I got to my decision point at 315. I could stay at a campsite or go on 2 more miles, go over the very steep Mt Everett, and stay at a shelter. It was just too early so on I went. 
Mt Everett was steep for 700 feet. It wasn’t all that bad, though, as the rocks and steps were well placed. I surprised myself how quickly I got to the summit. I noticed on Mt Race and Mt Everett the summits are very alpine looking. Stunted tree growth with gnarled branches, likely from the wind. The descent off Mt Everett was steep but not horrible. 
I arrived at the empty shelter just before 5. Since then 4 other hikers have come in. This is a much nicer, 2 level shelter, than the lean-to style of CT. This is the most people in one place on this trip. 
Today was very tough but satisfying. I’m glad I did the extra distance. I would have been really bored if I stopped early. Tomorrow is now a short day to get into town, clean up, and relax.

Town day. It was a few degrees warmer last night and pleasant. However, there was a lumberjack working all night in the shelter loft. He never stopped snoring. Since it was a short hiking day, I didn’t get out of the bag until 730 and was hiking at 8. I stuffed breakfast in my pocket and ate later. 
The first few miles were rocky along the edge of the mountainside. It was slow going. Finally things went downhill over very rocky terrain and rock slabs. It was even slower going but not that difficult. Eventually things leveled out and I cruised for 4.5 miles. 
There were some fields, some board walking through swampy areas, a very dark pine forest, one fall on a slippery muddy spot, a dropped hat and I finally emerged at MA Rt 7. Earlier I had left a message for a local trail shuttle, Joe, and he called me back 100 yards before the road. Perfect timing. 
I am at the Quality Inn. I cleaned up, walked .8 miles to the Big Y supermarket for resupply, and relaxed. I found a restaurant, The Well, that was excellent. A couple of local beers and a huge portion of meatloaf hit the spot. And, of course, I had to have a big ice cream to end it all. Hey, I need the calories. To top it off, Joe will get me back to the trail in the morning. 
I’ve got about 70 miles to go. I expect it to take me 5 days, maybe 5 and a morning. Weather continues to be good with a chance of rain the next 2 days. It’s all good.

The big meal last night might have weighed me down. Up early as always. I got breakfast at the hotel. The usual fare of eggs, sausage and muffins. I walked out front as my ride, Joe, arrived. I was back on trail just after 9. Unlike most town stops, the trail was flat through harvested corn fields for about 2 miles. It paralleled the Housatonic River. It’s much smaller here than a few days ago. After a short road walk up I went. 
The climb wasn’t terribly difficult but I was struggling. I struggled all day on the ups. I suspect I ate too much last night and maybe had one too many beers. There were 2 long climbs today. There was only one view all day. Early on the view was to the west with a clear line back to Mt Everett. Seen from a distance it’s a pretty good size mountain. I could also see to the Catskills in NY. I chatted with a couple of hikers but overall there were very few people out for a weekend. 
I had 2 shelter options today. First was the South Mt Wilcox Shelters. Yes, 2 in one area. An old and a new. Unfortunately it was only 3 and that’s just too early. So I  pressed on 1.7 miles to the North Mt Wilcox shelter. It’s old with an uneven floor. The stream is right next to the shelter so that’s convenient. I am the only one here now. I doubt anyone else will show up with so few people being out. 
The forecast is for light rain tonight and some tomorrow. We’ll see. It spit earlier but doesn’t feel like rain. Tomorrow should be about 15 miles.

It took 17 days but the rain finally got me. I was alone at the shelter last night. It was quiet except for the constant tinkling of falling leaves on the shelter roof. I slept straight through from about 9 to 4. That’s great for me. Slept again until almost 7. Packed up and headed out at 750 under overcast skies. 
The trail was uneventful today. Only 1 view at Tyringham Cobble, a rocky hill overlooking the (very small) town of Tyringham. The climb up to it was the first of 2 for the day. After crossing a very warped and shaky boardwalk was the second climb of the day. It was long but not overly steep. About halfway up I stopped for some lunch. Just as I finished the rain started. It was a pretty consistent rain, hard enough to soak me all the way through. 
I got to the turn off for the cabin before 3. There was no way I was going on the 8.8 miles to the next shelter. It was then .5 miles off trail to the cabin. It’s closed for the season but there are tent pads, a privy and bear box. You are allowed to sleep on the covered porch which is what I’m doing. 2 more guys showed up 10 minutes after me. Somehow we’ll all squeeze into this small space. It should be interesting. I just hope my clothes dry out some overnight. 
It’s less likely to rain tomorrow. If that holds I plan to go 18 miles to a shelter. The shelter before that is only 10 miles and there are no large climbs. I should make it 18 without too much trouble. We’ll see.

Rain, rain go away. The porch of the cabin worked out ok. Unfortunately, it rained all night. We stayed dry but none of my clothes dried in the wet air. I didn’t get out of the bag until 7. Putting on those wet clothes was not a pleasant experience. Sunrise is noticeably later and sunset is noticeably earlier compared to when I started 18 day ago. Just before 8 I started heading back the .5 miles to the AT, in the rain. 
The trail had a small climb to start then dropped down to cross the Mass Pike (I-90). Then up to Rt 20 into the lone big climb of the day, 800 feet in 1.5 miles. 
After that the next 14 miles were pretty level with only a few small climbs. The rain continued until about 11. Everything I was wearing was totally soaked. This would be a problem later in the day. I stopped at the shelter 8.8 miles in for lunch. I was making great time with the easy grade. However, I noticed some chafing on my thighs. I addressed it right away with some Body Glide. I don’t think it helped. 
The afternoon was spent walking over boards, through muddy ground, rock hopping, and just trying to keep my feet dry. At least the rain stopped.  Maybe the ground is just so flat here water bars or diversions wouldn’t do much good. The provided planks do help some. Thanks to the maintainers that do that. 
There was one view late in the day as the clouds lifted a bit. I didn’t stay there long, I just wanted to get to the shelter and get out of the wet clothes. 
I got water, set up in the shelter and ate dinner. I’m here with one other hiker, a NOBO planning to go to Katahdin in December. 
Tomorrow I’ll go through Dalton, MA and then to the shelter most of the way up Mt Greylock, the highest point in MA.

Going out with a bang. It rained lightly all night. Some of it may have just been the leaves gathering the moisture and then the drops dripping off them. The forecast called for improving weather and they got it right. 
I was out of my bag at 7 and hiking by 8. It was a short down then a short steep up leaving the shelter. I had the pack cover on and my rain jacket. On the up the jacket had to come off. It was warm today. After an uneventful 3 miles I reached the small town of Dalton, MA. There’s a 1.4 mile road walk through town. After crossing the Housatonic River again I left the trail. There was a sub shop that was open. I got a large Italian to take with me for dinner. The thought of instant potatoes and tuna was too depressing. I then stopped in a quickie mart for a drink and a candy bar. I hadn’t realized how expensive candy bars had gotten. Wow! I then got back to the road walk and passed through a neighborhood and back into the woods. 
It was now time for a 3+ mile climb. There were some short steep sections but overall it was not bad. I passed 3 flip flop thru hikers and chatted a bit with them. The descent was easy and dropped me into the town of Cheshire, MA. Not much here along the trail. There was a convenience store about a quarter mile off trail but I didn’t need anything. I did notice that here and in Dalton, the people take their Halloween decorations very seriously. It was sort of nice to see that in such small rural towns. 
Leaving Cheshire the fun really began. It was nearly 3 and I still had 4 miles of climbing to get to the shelter. Much of it was very steep. In total I climbed over 1600 feet. It was also warm today, 72 when I was in Cheshire. About 2/3 of the way I finished my water. Luckily there was a small spring and I could refill. One final push got me to the shelter at 5. I’m the only one here. The shelter faces east so I could get a good sunrise. By the way, the sub was good and I’m glad I carried it. But, it would have been a lot better toasted and fresh. 
The final climb today was up towards Mt Greylock. It was a  grueling way to end a long day. I still have 3.3 miles and 800 feet to reach the top. Then it’s almost all downhill to MA Rt 2. The terrain today was mostly nice with just a few rocky/rooty sections. Not as many planks to walk over either.

The final day. It got cold last night, likely in the upper 30s. It also got very windy. The shelter is at 2670 feet so that likely influenced the conditions. Today would be shorter miles so I took my time packing up. I got back on trail at about 820. 
It was up 800 feet to start. Skies were overcast and the strong wind continued. The trail up here was somewhat rocky and rooty. I kept a slow and steady pace up, crossed the tourist road a few times and finally reached the top of MA tallest point, Mt Greylock. At the summit is a tall tower honoring the war dead. I could have climbed to the top but there was nothing to see. We were in the clouds. I spoke to a few day hikers then headed down the other side of the mountain. Of course, not 5 minutes from the summit the clouds started breaking up. Oh well. 
The downhill was long; over 6 miles. It started off mellow but then had some very steep areas. Eventually I came out to Mt Prospect Ledge with incredible long range views into Williamstown and north into VT. After the ledge it was all down for 1800 feet. I popped out in a residential area and finally made my destination of MA Rt 2. 
I headed west to my HoJo hotel on the east end of Williamstown. My feet are a bit sore today. There are so many leaves covering the trail it’s very hard to see the rocks and roots. My feet kept slamming into them under the leaves. 
That ends this section hike. I’ll post a conclusion entry in a few days. Thanks for following along.
