She started early and is about to start Maine. She was a wealth of infoHad two thoughts today—push extra hard to reach Katadin by July 23 to eliminate a return trip. It would require serious increase in milesThe second thought was to quit. The repetition each day—rocks, trees, uphills, downhills—had me asking why. I settled on my original three reasons and the thought that 5 years from now I would really regret quitting Had Philly Cheesesteaks delivered to a rest point. Ate with Trotter and Pocket Rocket. They stopped at a shelter and I decided to push on 6 more miles. I happened upon a large pavilion at the top of a hill. Great spot to watch a sunset. At first I was alone there and decided to sleep there. Later several groups came to see the sunset. I became buddies with one groupSleep was not good that night.

I rested more and walked slower Toward the end of the day I slipped and broke one of my poles. About the time a hiker came from the other direction and told me there was great trail magic ahead. It is amazing how that can pick one up. I hiked a tough downhill section anticipating grilled meat. When I arrived…they were gone. My fatigue and even despair returned. It was 6:00 and I was spent after only 13 miles. I found a tent site and called it a day. Everything about setting up camp was harder than normal and my appetite was gone. The mind is interesting. If there had been trail magic I would have chowed down. Instead I had to force myself to eat my instant potatoes. Another guy was tenting at the same site. He had a reservation for a motel 19 miles down the trail. $95 plus tax. Crazy. I have not spent more than $25 for lodging. I was demoralized enough to justify the expense.

If you have an AMC card from staying at a campsite you get two free baked goods and a bowl of soup for free. Today I went to two huts. The first gave me free food. The second had chicken nuggets for sale and allowed me to substitute them for a free baked good on my card. I did that twice for a great second lunch.At huts thru hikers can do work-for-stay.

Like Pikes Peak, Mt Washington has both a road and a cog railway to take non-hikers to the top. It was early and the train was not running so we climbed up into the track and made great time climbing the other side of the mountain by walking on ties.
