It's so hard to walk away from the trail but I know it's the right thing to do. As Rumble drove me to the airport I fought back the tears when we pulled away from Stanimals as 6-pack stood at the door. However, eventually, the tears came like the rain that was falling in the Shenandoah  Valley. Rumbel, without words, understood. He is an amazing man, person, that works at the hostel, and he knows the feeling, he has been there himself. So many times I wanted to tell him to turn the car around so I could continue on but everything happens for a reason.  A seed has been planted and it's up to me now to water it, to care for it, and to watch it grow and blossom. I know in my heart that I will see these guys and the trail again as the world is truly a small place. I honesty believe in never saying goodbye, it's until we meet again. There are so many takeaways from this adventure and so many more to be found. My RA didn't win but it sure put up a fight and it showed me some boundaries. But hold on because this adventure is just beginning...Peace!",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0

Cold night when camping at 4926ft. it got below freezing and I had ice/frost on my tent when I woke up. I stayed warm though in my 20 deg. rated sleeping bag all zipped up like a mummy.  Had the most amazing sunrise, visit my Instagram page for the picture, while sipping on coffee. Time to go and close this section hike out.
Clear skies today and the view from the Wesser Bald observation tower, the last big climb, had 360 deg. views. Then it was pretty much 4 miles of knee pounding downhill on tired legs, ankles, & feet into the Nantahala Outdoor Center, my tap-out point.
My wife is on her way now to pick me up and before heading home we may stop over for a side adventure. NO HIKING, lol, I'm pretty beat up.
I'm going to miss the friendships that I've made on this journey and I'm jealous that they will continue on. As they say, never leave the trail on a bad day, and today even as hard as it was, was an absolutely amazing day. 
I hope to be back very, very soon. The trial life is a part of me.

Who am I kidding... 
I'm getting off the trail. Even if it, my toe, gets a wee bit better, I'm only one step from really messing it up until it fully heals. I've already hit it a few more times yesterday and it was not good. Heartbroken but there is no need to put myself in extra danger knowing that all's not well going into it. Sad...but super excited about our future...
Reply: Wife
Geez. Yes. You have your whole life to continue where you left off. Not a big deal. 
As one person gets off the trail another one gets back on. Ironically, today after being off the trail for about a  year, ""Strings"" a hostel worker who got sucked in for work for stay/job, is getting back on trail. He's nervous, he's anxious, he's questioning himself, of course, I do my best to help him work through it, it's what I do. Light on food and money, I gave him both... Hikers caring for hikers, it's a bond that is strong even if we only know of each other in passing. 

If you give trail magic, you may receive trail magic. However, it's never expected. But I got word that a Nobo has found my lost items right where I figured that I'd lost them. Lucky that we will meet at the trailhead to retrieve them. Thankful!
VA kicked my ass again...but this dog doesn't give up the fight so easily. I'll be back, sometime soon...
Thank you again to all of the trail volunteers, trail angels, and ridge runners. Your service is appreciated.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646557,"While it's still a few months away, I've been scouting out Trailjournals. Super excited to read the stories of those who will be on the trail this year., best of luck and best wishes to you all. 
A lot has happened to our family over that last year, so many changes.  I plan to start writing soon on my blog site @ thepurposefulhiker.com, in which I'll fill you in on the adventurous back story.  The one main takeaway from last year is this, my wife and I now live in Asheville, NC! Yep, we sold it all, again, and we have finally have landed in our new home, after being homeless for about 6 months.  That adventure is a whole story in itself.  Home, we are now, closer to the mountains and of course closer to the AT. Goodbye Indiana, so long, it was nice to know you!
Asheville, I have to pinch myself sometimes, I can't believe it.  It's been a vision of ours for many years and here we are. The mountains are just amazing and of course, the hiking, mountain biking, fishing, and everything outdoors is right in our backyard, not to mention a few breweries...LOL. HOME! So, with such quick access to the AT completing the southern half of the AT is way more accessible for me than what it was from Indiana. Oh, and yea my wife is also getting back on the trail herself as she'll look to close out GA in the spring. She plans to tackle some sections herself and now that she's been on the trail twice with me she's pretty seasoned to navigating the trail and trail life. She's got this...Hopefully, she'll join me up the trail at some point, as I really did enjoy hiking with her.
So what's my plan? Well...I currently have planned for 3 section hikes in the spring to fill in some gaps before moving on. Two of the sections are short and one is a little longer section and once I complete those I'll look to come up with another plan for the mid to late fall.  Heck, if the weather was like last year, the early winter may also be an option to get in some miles.  I guess we'll have to see how Mother Nature behaves this year. I haven't quite made up my mind if I want to do any sections in the summer, the heat and lack of water sources were just brutal on me mentally. So here is my current plan in a nutshell.
Section (4) 1st for the year: April, NOC Bryson City to Fontana Dam Visitor Center (27.6 Miles)Section (5) 2nd for the year: April, Daven Port Gap to Hot Springs, NC (36.7 Miles)If you are savvy, you picked up that these sections will skip around Smokey Mountain National Park for now. Possibly my late fall hike in which I could tackle it all at once? All of these sections are within an hour of where we live so quite doable for quick 3 day adventures.Section (6) 3rd for the year, I'll bounce back up north to finish where I bonked last year and closeout Northern, VA. May, Glasgow, VA to Waynesboro, VA (77 Miles)
All in all, that will put my total AT mileage total at around 516.7, not including the trek up Springer Mountain which was a beast of a climb in itself. However, 141.3 for the year is short of the mileage that I'd like to accomplish for the year.  So, we'll get these sections in the books and I'll keep on dreaming some more about what my next steps will be. 
Until then, I guess I better start training a bit more...~ Peace!",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Thu",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647060,"And just like that, the plans change for the better...
Well my original plan has already shifted. I've learned that the AT decides your day not you...lol. My plan was to not start section 1 for the year until April, but some unplanned life events came up. Or did the AT work its magic? Honestly, since I've started reading my fellow hikers on Trail Journals this year the longingness for the AT has been eating at my heart and eating at my thoughts. So, after reviewing my personal and professional schedule, I found a window of time to get out earlier. Get out ahead of the events of April that I can't avoid. Of course, if you've read any of my past post & blogs from my other journals, I've shied away from cold weather hiking for a few reasons. None which are rational. Instead, like an idiot, I often choose to hike in the heat and super dry condition.  Yeah, I'm that guy on trail constantly trying to Yogi water or a Gatorade off the day hikers. 
Ok, so to make it quick on why I avoided the cold weather. One, I hate carrying extra gear, ultra-light NO but close. I only carry the essentials and nothing more. Over the years, I have learned to not my pack my fears. Which in the end, a lighter pack means less aches and pains on my RA body. With a lighter pack I was also able to make some big miles and do it fast...which as an ex-marathon runner is my style. Cold weather means extra layers and a much heavier pack, I guess I need to start practicing on how to slow down. Two, hyperthermia, which is all totally in my head. I've tested my cold gear many of times back home and can comfortably handle the freezing temperatures. I'm also a warm sleeper so most of the time, I have to shed clothing during the night and during the day for that matter. Three, OK, there is no three, just making some empty excuses now...LOL
So, March 22 it is, weather depending of course, LOL. At least there will be plenty of water in the streams, so I got that going for me...I'll check back in as go time nears. Until then, I better get to stepping up my training schedule. ~ Peace",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Thu",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647616,"It's been a while since I've seen my gear.  Before I packed it all up last fall, I did a good cleaning on it and made any necessary repairs but I'm really in need of a new dry bag for my sleeping bag and clothes. I guess I forgot about that so it looks like I'll have to just get out the duct tape and patch a few holes. Needless to say, when I got all of my gear out to start my pre-pack, I got butterflies in my stomach. Why am I so nervous again, you've done this countless times I tell myself. Yet, I check and recheck my gear and hike plan, and I will do it numerous times before I even tap back in. UGH! I should know better as the best times I had on the trail were when I just let it happen and I just hiked. Wait where's my knife? 
The food shopping is complete and my bear bag is filled with nutritious hiker food, lol. Since this section is only 3ish days from the NOC to Fontana Dam I'm trying to go as light as I can. Yet the temptation to pack my fears is a constant battle. This is the earliest time of the year that I've been on the AT so for the first time, I'll have to pack some additional cold gear as a precaution for some potential cold nights. I'm really not looking forward to the extra weight but I'm certainly happy about hiking in cooler weather. However, there is some rain in the forecast this week. I'm hoping that the forecast will change in the next day or two but rain won't stop me from going. Thunderstorms, Yes, but rain, no... 
So, for now, the plan is to pick the best 3-day weather window this week and go from there. I'll drive down to the NOC in Bryson City, NC to park my car, head north, and I'll just shuttle back from Fontana Dam when I get there. So my next post will be from the trail and I'm looking forward to meeting some of my fellow hiker trash that are headed to Katahdin. Why am I still nervous?",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Sun",0
Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647959,"Well to keep this post short and sweet, as a section hiker with a flexible schedule, I decided to wait out the bad weather; thunderstorms, heavy rain, strong winds, and a major temperature drop, nope... I'll pass. Since this hike is only 3 days from the NOC to the Fontana Dam Visitor center, why should I be miserable if I don't have to. I've hiked a plenty in thunderstorms, rain, and high winds. I even camped when an unexpected temperature drop happened overnight above 5,200 ft., in August that is, and everything froze. So, with that said, the weather will greatly improve tomorrow. It will still be a bit cold but up the trail I must go.
However, Saturday in the lower elevations, there was a window of some nice weather and I got to do a little hiking in Dupont State Forest with family and my grandson Little B. It was an epic day had by all. I can't wait for this little guy to be able to log some trail miles but there's no rush on time...Time is a precious commodity!
Backpack, gear, food bag, and supplies, check, check, and triple check. The final backpack weight is in at just under 23lbs. I probably could cut out about 2lbs. if I left the colder weather gear at home. I really need this hike...""SANCTUARY""!!!! Be_again. ~ Purpose",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Sun",0

Yeah it took me a while to get to camp. Did I mention that it's freezing in camp at above 4,300 ft. There is still even icicles in some streams. I know that I'm not in hiking shape but that climb out of the NOC rates in the top 3 so far. In camp with quite a few yikers, a mixed gang of 20 somethings and old folks,  but little clicks have form so getting in to a conversation has been awkward. I guess nobody wants to talk to a low life section hiker. Their loss, lol. I guess if I stayed on trail longer they might open up but whatever. I don't mind the solitude for this short section an trip. I just really needed to get back on trail and slow my life down for a minute. Two vitamin I's and off to an early bedtime.

Then bam...I emerged from my mummy bag that was covering my face at 8:45am, crap daylight...Time to get going. The day turned out to be pretty nice and a lot warmer so hopefully I won't be freezing tonight. I made it the next shelter 9.1 miles away and way to early to stop, even after a late start. Trust me today wasn't an easy hike either at one point 900ft. straight up out of Stecoah Gap. Trail magic was had but not by me, stupid apple allergy! So press on I did but I ran out of water for the last 5 miles and the report at camp wasn't good...I almost cried but I couldn't, I was so dehydrated. Just before camp, I spotted the source a tiny trickle but where there's a will there's a way. Drink and drink I did. So I'm loaded up with water for the night.

It jars me from my sleep and quite frankly is....Ok, moving on. 10 miles today to tap out, and it was a beautiful hike, minus the decent into Fontana Marina. It was a knee crusher to say the least. However, what a pleasant surprise to hang out on the floating patio while enjoying a beer before my last steps to the dam. Weather was perfect but the talk on trail is about tomorrows storms..so I would have been zeroing tonight if I was going on. Running into a lot more Thru Hikers now, and I wish you all the best.

I'm getting back on the trail tomorrow for a short section in preparation for a longer section.I've Gotten Soft!It's pretty crazy how one can fall back into city life once off the trail especially when you live in an area with plenty of distractions. It also means the return to that JOB thing that funds my AT adventures. Owning my own business now is a two-way trail. One, it provides me with an income but in the end, there are responsibilities that are critical to keeping the business running. Two, owning a business provides me with the flexibility to design my day, week, and months accordingly. However, there are also times that an unexpected event can derail my every plan, something that I need to figure out how to overcome.
A comfortable bed, nice sofa, tables, hot shower, all the household comforts and lots of breweries with gourmet food trucks are all distractions from trail life. Short prize hikes with views and waterfalls on easy terrain while only carrying a light day pack have become a way of life. However, in the back of my mind, I actually miss the simplicity of being dirty. I miss rehydrating my dinner, filtering water, and just being small in the universe and in tune with nature. I miss the one and only real task of the day while on the trail, hiking to the next oasis, then waking up to do it all over again and again. Sure, I'll have another IPA! Oh, and can I get one of those awesome pretzels with beer cheese? Please and thank you! Now, what was I saying...Oh yeah, that AT dream.
The AT has called me again, it's time to go. It's as simple as that. The plan is basic for a short hike, one to get back into the groove and two to get back into backpacking shape for a longer section later in the month. So this short section will take me from just outside of the boundaries of the Great Smokey Mountain National Park to Hot Springs, NC. A mere 33.1 miles in three days. The stage is set, the weather is looking awesome, and the logistics are all in place. The backpack is now packed and I'm ready to go. 
Basic stats: Warm weather hiking has its advantages so with 3 days of food, probably too much food, and without water, it weighs in at only 18.8 lbs. I love being light. Thankfully we've had lots of spring rain so the water sources should, gulp, should be flowing. My next post will be from the trail. Be_again and again ~ Purpose",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Thu",0

As I head Sobo I walked past my car in the forest service parking lot it was the last chance to just go home. Standing in the pouring rain, I opted to not put on my rain gear, I pause for a minute oh hell no! The climb south out of Hot Springs is 13 miles up to just under 5000ft to get over Bluff Mountain it looks like a long day with a late start. Good call on opting out of the rain gear, I was sweating all the way up and the rain felt amazing! As much as I wanted to go NoBO I have to admit it was awesome going south, I met so many north bounders and many said the same thing... you're the first person I've seen all day.

Just one more summit to the FAA tower and it was all downhill from there into Standing Bear Farm Hostel.  Easier said than done, most hikers will tell you the downhill if steep is the worst and I agree.

Let's just say I should have brought more...Visited the outfitter this afternoon in Rockfish Gap, really cool place and picked up a T-shirt since I will not be returning, lol. Big day tomorrow morning with a three peaks right at the start. The good thing is that it's going to cool way down after today's thunderstorms, wow it's getting really dark out. Feeling much better today... Peace!","

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653211,"Today was one of those hiking days you just wow over. 3 peaks, amazing view spots, cool conversation with hikers, awesome clear sky, cool, and breezy weather. Now, I'm camping for free at Devil's Backbone Brewery in there amazing glamp ground. Yep, full service bath house, I guess they don't want stinky hikers at there awesome brewery and I haven't even had a beer or food yet. It only took about 15 mins to get a hitch in, which the brewery is 5 miles off the trail. I can't even...pinch me. I'll try to post some pictures on my Instagram page later. But something else happen today something incredibly unexpected. My selfgiven trail name Purpose has been officially changed and I have to accept it, something that I struggle with before in 2020. Sitting outside the hostel having coffee out side and watching the sun come up with Walmart & Tags who were also enjoying a hit, both on their second AT thru hike, they said, good morning you must be Smiley. You're always smiling...I about dropped my coffee cup as I was about to take another sip of some delicious Foldgers. It was in this very spot in 2020 that Rumble said the same thing. I told them what my trail name was and why...To make a long story short, Tags takes another hit, sip and said I think ones purpose in life shifts, it changes, it's not meant to stay the same. F*$k, that hit me like a ton of bricks. I could go on and on as we had a great conversation before it was time to for us to all part ways. As I parted they said happy hiking Smiley...Sign, sealed, and delivered.","VA 56 The Priest Trail Head

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653301,"I sIept pretty good last night at the campground especially since it finally cooled way down, but up early as usual I was. Emerging from my tent I noticed that a few more hikers came in during the night, ok after 8:30pm Zzzz, lol.... I'm guessing that they went right to the brewery first before they closed. The great thing about hikers is most are really great at being stealth like so not to disturb others that are already sleeping. So how do I get a hitch back to the trail in these early hours as all of the glampers are still sleeping on their comfy beds? I know they are still sleeping because I don't smell any bacon cooking, lol. Only one way to find out I guess go stand on the road and start walking the 5 miles to the trail head and prepare for a 20 mile day to get to the next shelter, was the plan. My one hope is that the Three Peaks Trail Head is a popular trail for day hikers and I was hitching on one of the main roads to get there. It was also Sunday and with beautiful weather in the forecast I was hoping that I'll catch an early riser. As they say, the trail provides and within 5 minutes, bingo. I got actually got picked up by a thurhiker by means of his Grandma, how lives in the area, on his way back up the trail to slack pack for the day. didn't think of that angle. I won't go into the full story but let's just say if I'd had to walk the road further I would have crossed paths with a very large adult bear. Ok, so since it was early and since I was prepared for a long day pre hitch. It was 19.1 miles straight into Waynesboro, which now became the plan. Let's do this and end this gap in my section once and for all.  The trail was fast today, there were some technical sections but no major climbs. At 3:15pm, I emerged at Rockfish Gap, and tapped out. The feeling to finally finish this section had me smiling, it's over! Never again will I need to come back to Waynesboro... I'll write a follow up soon, shower up and head back to Asheville, via cat that is...","Reeds Gap - Devil's Backbone Brewery

Purpose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653661,"I have now completed 514.9 miles on the Appalachian Trail since I started in the fall of 2020. Each year has been interesting, to say the least. The first year everything was so new and the adventure was just that, an adventure in learning the reality of trail life...Scared, uncertain, uncomfortable, but incredibly freeing, and with each day, each mile I learned a lot about myself and what I was capable of enduring. 
The second year was simply just amazing especially in the spring when I hiked from the southern terminus, approach trail included, with my wife, to the NOC in Bryson City, NC.  I followed that hike up in the fall with the ambition to close out the Northern section of VA which ended up short and with two broken toes. Defeated I felt, I left the trail with thoughts as to if I would ever return to the trail again. I really missed hiking with someone whom I knew, who I could share in the journey with. Yes, I love being alone on the trail at times but it sure is a lot of fun to have someone around during the times when the trail sucks. Of course also when it was amazing. Yes, folks, hiking the AT is hard, and at times it just downright sucks.
This year, I vowed not to ever hike alone, or to hike in high heat, and after 3 section hikes by myself, I failed to listen to what I vowed to myself.  In all transparency, I haven't really enjoyed myself to the fullest during my hiking this year. Yes, there were good moments but in the end, even though there were plenty of hikers out on the trail, I never connected with anyone. I guess that's hard to do when my sections this year were only for a few days and one was SOBO not by choice. My three-section hikes this year were more about just counting off the miles to the final prize.  So much that I didn't even realize that I actually broke, no pun intended, 500 miles this year, I guess that was on my last day into Waynesboro, how fitting...
When I finally finished Glasgow, VA to Waynesboro, VA at Rockfish Gap, it was all I could do to get the hell out of town as fast as possible. I swore that I would never come back to this area of VA again, ever. I also left the trail with the thought of never returning to AT ever again. A feeling that still lingers in the back of my mind today. Yet, there is still a strong desire, a flicker of flame, to finish what I've started three years ago. As I drove home back to Asheville, NC I passed numerous towns that I've hiked through and the memories are still so vivid that I can just about recall every step that I took. I also drove past towns in southern, VA like, Roanoke, Damascus, and Erwin places that I've read about, which got my heart pumping again and my mind wondering what adventures could ensue. 
Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the loneliness, maybe it was just not the right time for this journey for me. The one thing that did stand out is that perseverance is also something that I should be proud of. I finished a trail gap that had been just eating at me. I need to take some time off from the AT, how long, it's undetermined right now. I had planned to get back on the trail in October for three weeks, my longest section hike ever, but I've since shelved that for now. I guess right now I just don't know when I'll return and I really don't need to have that answer either. I have so many mixed emotions to sort out over the summer. Or maybe it's just best to put those emotions on a shelf for now and just live for today. 
Have a great summer and for those out there on the trail fulfilling your dreams, Happy Hiking!",,View Entry,"Jun 26, Sun",0
