Hike up over Blood Mountain in a thunderstorm and pouring rain, came down the tough slippery decent. Lots of rock ledge ( slippery) but we were careful and got into Neels Gap outfitters where the AT literally goes right thru outfitters. Took a picture of the famous sneaker tree. These are hikers who quit the AT and throw there sneakers in tree. Got a room an shuttle into Blairsville. To dry out. We’re here with Willow, Ramblin man and Ranger Randy among others.

We had breakfast with Willow ( a girl we’ve met from Utah) then grabbed a shuttle to Neels gap. Rambling man and Ranger Randy beat us to trail and we ran into Justin an Nicole who camped past Neels gap. That group of people seem to be hiking at same pace as us we see them on the trail daily and end up in same campsites so we’re making similar decisions. Rambling Man and Ranger Randy have both done thru hiked before so they have great knowledge.We’re trying to be smart about acclimating to trail, we trained a lot but when you do it every day we have to let our bodies get use to grinding out Mountains every day. We went over our 13th mountain in four days today. We went overLevelland mountain,Cowrock mountain,Wildcat mountain ouch! And finished with Poor mountain before ending in Low Gap Shelter. But the story of the day was the trail magic after descending from Wildcat mountain. A group of 8-10 people were set up at Road crossing. The menu homemade black bean soup, hard boiled eggs, peanut butter and jelly. Or homemade pound cake, homemade gluten-free brownies gator raid coffee soda sweets! Comfortable chairs to sit in. Took about a half hour break. Great people lots of fun. Extremely windy tonight, supposed to get cold in 30’s. Cold weather gear will earn its keep tonight.Not sure how far we’ll go tomorrow.

A lot nicer camping then the winds that howled last nite. Had some coyotes running and howling thru the tent site at 3:00 in the morning just to let us know we were trespassing on their territory. My best nite sleeping. Monday we decided to hike to Deep gap shelter 9.4 miles to set up a resupply in Hiawassee on Tuesday. A little cooler we flew covering the distance in just over 5 hours.We went over Trey Mt.,young Lick Knob ( these knobs are mountains where I come from!) Sassafras and Kelly Knob. Got into camp about 1:45 which with warm temperatures made a beautiful day to kick back and get to know hikers as they slowly streamed in. Had a 2:00 AM visitor l swing at my tent! A mouse which I drove away but not deterred he came back at 3:00 and 4:30. Didn’t get much sleep protecting my equipment! But no damage to tent. We headed to Dick’s creek Gap this morning a quick 4 miles out. We hitched a ride from Ranger Randy whose brother in law pick him up and gave us a ride to our room at Holiday Inn.spent the afternoon walking around town to get our food resupply for 3-4 days. Taking our first zero day(0 milage) Wednesday Thunderstorms and 2-4 inches of rain expected. Great timing we’ve been moving well but our legs can use 11/2 days rest. We did plenty of training but not7 days straight with full packs going up and down mountains. Care of our bodies early will pay dividends down the trail, many people try to pound out milage and end up with injuries. So far we’re pretty good.

A steep rocky ascent sometimes hand over hand. We made the top by 9:45 and another milestone the 100 mile mark.

Of weight depending on how many days of food we have. The trails are rocky full of roots and uneven, then you climb over roots and trees that have come down. So the way I look at it body preservation is my number one focus. So I /we have to constantly be looking down so we don’t trip . What I try to do is always concentrate on landing my foot evenly not at angles to avoid foot and body stress , heel to toe this journey has just started and I want to concentrate on the body!

Today had a very steep rocky decent down to RT 9. Of course that meant going right back up on the other side of road. A long climb up a unnamed Mountain. Went across Porcupine Ridge and then climbed Little Pond Mountain at 3306 feet. Then climbed another 500 feet of elevation to Glastonbury Mountain lookout Tower . I climbed it . It was worth the climb . Spectacular 360 view. Finished the day hiking to Kid Gore  Shelter. Got there at 6:10.,"

Had a big mile day in front of me 20.5 including going up an over Stratton Mountain. I didn’t know what that would bring. Vermont has been mud, rocks, roots and some great views. A lot of rock scrambled early. A nice cardio burn. Went swimming unintentionally when I was about to filter some water. Feet slipped out and landed on my rear and got shorts and part on my shirt wet.it was a soft landing so no harm done! Got a surprise Stratton MT was an easy climb. Then went up the fire tower.  Spectacular 360 degrees view took so pictures and headed down. Friendly trails to shelter got there around 5:15. Good 20.5 mile day!","

RP Calculator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653603,"On June 16th I hiked the 20 mile day I was hoping for. A little tough early then had to go up Stratton Mountain, surprisingly not to tough. Climbed the Fire Tower, Ran in to Lavera who I’ve seen at the  last 2 shelters. She’s from Oregon on a leave of absence from work. She’s flip flopping . She started in Harpers Ferry and is hiking to Katahdin then she’ll finish the south. She’s hoping to end up at the same shelter tonight which would be her first 20 mile day. Got to the  summit at noon. The afternoon was relatively easy but still had to hike 9 miles. Got to shelter around 5 but made mistake of not getting water before. It was probably another mile on my day getting water!  I’m basicly out of food except for a few candy bars to get me out the 6 miles I have in the morning. So Lavera gave me 2 Ramen noodles for supper. I always am trying to plan food close, it’s less weight to carry. I could have made it on candy and cliff bars but the Ramen noodles were good. In the morning I hiked out by 9:15 and Chris Casella was picking me up by 10:00. Very happy with this section, 360 miles in 21 days and a wake up ( the term we use for a few miles in the morning) Completed fromPA/NJ border to about 50 miles into Vermont. The Vermont border was my goal, Manchester was my stretch goal. My total mileage is now 915 miles. Taking a short break for family time , I’ll be back in Manchester Vermont on July 6 heading north again. The White Mountains are looming ahead but have some hard hiking in Vermont first.","

Ran into French Toast who I met in the south and later ran into Masters from Augusta, Georgia who I met in early April  down south. Got to shelter before 3:00 lots of hikers passing thru later .

They say if you get off the trail too long you won’t come back. After 20 days off for a trip out west , home was pulling me away from the trail. After owning a business for almost 40 years with little time off in the summer I decided I wanted to be home more than I want to hike at this point. I’ve accomplished a lot hiking and backpacking for 970 miles on the Appalachian Trail and really not very experienced to start. I learned how to be self sufficient on the trail. It involves a lot of day by day planning on the fly; where am I getting to tonight,how much food do I have when do I stay in a town to shower and wash the only set of clothes I have, which I’m wearing. And of course hiking 12 to 23 miles a day carrying 25lbs to 30 lbs. in my pack. What an experience not to mention meeting people from all walks of life. Americans, people from overseas you name it. I would be remiss not to mention the great support and encouragement from family and friends and all the people who followed me on trail journal.com . The encouragement from everyone kept me going many days. Many people hike the AT in sections over a period of years with some others take a few years. I may be back on the trail to hike some sections next spring, We’ll see it’s a long ways away. For now I’m excited to start a new chapter of my life retirement! I’ll try to do some things that work always got in the way of. Thanks again to everyone for all the positive thoughts and energy. Lastly I want to thank all the people that gave me rides and picked me up from the airport going to and from the trail. I’ll never forget their kindness on helping me on my journey. And at the top of the list is Jeff an Thom who helped me learn about hiking and backpacking and all the hundreds of hours spent hiking together.RP","

My brother Sean and his two boys Seamus and Rohan dropped me off in Killington on August 4 th to meet Jeff and we hiked thru that terrible humid spell with heat indexes at 100. The weather people were saying to stay inside in air conditioning and we were hiking 12-15 miles . We hydrated often took breaks and made it happen. 7 days later we’re at Glencliff N.H.
