Betsy Barbera,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645716,"What was once a daydream has turned into an obsession over the past 4 years. Like a lot of people who hike, the seed to hike the AT was planted by reading books about people who have hiked the AT and other long distance trails. This led to my venture into the world of YouTube where I found thousands of videos by thru hikers. Over the years, I’ve learned about gear and have virtually hiked the AT and other trails with the help of those videos. To increase the chances of my success, I knew that I would need to travel as light as possible since I’m not getting any younger. I fully admit that I am a gear head. I’ve loved buying and trying out new gear. So after years of collecting gear and day dreaming, the time has come to put my YouTube education to the test.
    Along the way, I was able to get some practical experience by day hiking the 4000 footers in New Hampshire and section hiking the AT in Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts. This past summer along with some of my hiking friends, we hiked the Long Trail in Vermont in what turned out to be the rainiest July on record.
 Of course all of this would never have happened without my adventurous friends. Thank goodness I found so many who love hiking. I thank them all for inspiring me and taking me along on their hiking adventures.",,View Entry,"Nov 08, Mon",0
