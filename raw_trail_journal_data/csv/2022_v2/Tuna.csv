Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651106,"Well, it is officially the day before I begin the AT (NOBO). I originally planned to start May 12, a few days after I graduated from college, but had some unexpected delays. The extra time was nice because I got to spend some time with my family and got some last minute planning done. I packed my backpack for the first time, and it weighs around 27 pounds, minus water. I think that’s pretty good, although I expect my gear will change around after I start using everything. My dad is driving me down to Georgia, and he’s going to hike with me to Neel’s Gap, which I expect to get to in about 3-4 days. I can’t wait to get to Springer Mountain, and officially begin my 2022 AT journey. I know I have a lot to face: inexperience, self doubt, my fear of bears, rain, etc. But I’m ready to embrace the unknowns and start walking. Every day waiting in limbo is another day I’m not moving towards Mt. Katahdin, which seems so far away. It is a little unreal that I’m starting tomorrow, and even more so that I won’t be done for so many months. I’m not sure what I’m capable of— mentally, physically, emotionally, etc., but I’m excited to find out soon. A big thanks to everyone who has encouraged me so far!",,View Entry,"May 15, Sun",0
Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651427,"First stretch has been really fun so far! Started 5/16 Amiacola Falls and now past mile 50. Dad hiked with me until Neels Gap for 3 days which was so fun, sad to see him go but I’m sure he’ll be back. Been hiking with an older guy named Terrapin, he had some interesting stories. Met some others, everyone is so nice! I’ve seen 2 bears, 3 snakes, and a ton of salamanders so far.","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652043,"The last two weeks have been amazing. I feel so lucky to be out here in nature everyday, the trail is so beautiful and I can’t believe this is my life for the next few months. I’m writing from the NOC (Nantahala Outdoors Center), where I took my first zero today. Dad and Stella hiked with me for a few days from Franklin, NC to the NOC. Said goodbye to them this morning, and then went whitewater rafting with some of my new friends. River was awesome today, had a lot of rain lately. Some highlights/memorable moments of the last few weeks: First hitch hiking experience/trail magicFirst 20+ mile day in a torrential downpour (for over 10 hours… think ankle/shin deep water/mud and hands so pruny they looked non-human)A mouse ran over Stella’s head in a shelter Crossed the GA/NC borderHit 100 miles First hostel (highly recommend Around the Bend near Hiawasee, GA) Met some really amazing people!! Whitewater rafting at NOC I was attacked by a grouse… Learned the motto: no pain, no rain, no Maine Inch worms takeover at Blood Mountain, GA (like 50,000 of them, everywhere) Learned (thanks Google) that bears are resilient in rain Excited for what’s next!","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652610,"Time moves so quickly on the trail! It’s wake up, walk, eat, walk, eat, eat, sleep. Every day. It’s amazing. It’s week 3ish now, and I’m at mile 275! I took a much needed zero day in Hot Springs, NC, where Hillbilly Market supplied many milkshakes and I got to soak in a hot spring. I love this town. I’ve been sticking with my tramily, the muskrat gang, which consists of me (Tuna), Bear-Run, and Mushroom. Everyone I’ve met on trail and off trail has been so lovely and welcoming. 
Here are some week 3ish highlights: 
Great Smokey Mtn National Park (GSMNP): no bears, 8-10 wild boars (absolutely terrifying while I was hiking alone, they are enormous), 2 wild turkeys, several elk (who know they lived in NC), 2 deer, lots of red squirrels, lots of miceFontana Hilton Shelter, complete with a water view and showers Mushroom's family cooking us an AMAZING dinner and letting us stay in their air bnb Clingman’s DomeCharlie’s Bunion view: to die for Sunrise at Icewater Spring Shelter Zero day in Hot Springs, NC (staying in a studio above The Tavern) Max Patch! According to my mom, I was stung by a bee here while blueberry picking over 15 years ago, when we lived in Asheville, NC. Incredible 360 views! Chocolate chip pancakes on trail, courtesy Mushroom My trail name (Tuna), courtesy Bear-Run Trail magic— donuts and apples before Jacob’s Ladder Crawling under and over many, many logs, and climbing up and down many, many mountains Keeping my rain fly off and stargazing from my tent

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653005,"It’s officially been one month on trail! Although it feels like almost no time has passed at all. One of my favorite parts of trail life is losing track of the days, which are mostly differentiated by whether there’s a stop in town planned. The plan for an epic 6 days of consecutive 20 milers to get to Elk Park fell apart on day 4. After a 24 mile day, the muskrat gang was exhausted and Bear-Run’s leg was hurting. As we started our day, we came across a view of the Nolichucky River, and as we sat there our minds went to one thing— food. Waiting for us in the nearby town of Erwin, TN. We all agreed to abandon the plan and head into town. The spontaneous days are my favorite. We had planned a 20 mile day with sad, sore legs, and instead ended up in Erwin, TN. We rented bikes from Uncle Johnnys Hostel and rode into town. We got Mexican food, I finally found Cheerwine at a gas station, we got smoothies, and milkshakes at a diner. Yep, hiker hunger is real. We also hung out at the Nolichucky River for a few hours, which was the closest thing to a shower I’d had in a while. We also ran into some of our friends— Just Chloe, Vintage, Honey Badger, The Boxer, Lard, and The Weatherman. We decided to just stay in Erwin for the night, and ended up getting a trail magic ride (back of pickup truck, check on the AT bucket list) to a bar where we listened to some live music and then camped in the Cherokee National Forest nearby. It was a much needed break. We did make it to my grandparents house on time, by getting picked up at Carver’s Gap instead of Elk Park. The hike to Carver’s Gap was nice, I think I’m getting my trail legs slowly. The terrain in NC/TN is more rolling than GA. Roan Mountain was a 4 mile ascent that almost took me out, but we made it to the top. And then we made it to the parking lot to meet my grandparents. It’s so strange running into normal people and being asked so many questions, I didn’t expect people to find thru hikers so interesting. Every time we are in a public space, it’s kind of like we’re zoo animals. But we mostly get positive reactions, so it’s nice to tell people about our journey. It was amazing to visit with my family at Beech Mountain, and my mom and dad were able to come up too. The muskrats took a zero day at my grandparents house and enjoyed the view from the deck, and a lot of candy we got at Mast General Store. Today we’re camping at the Doll Flats, and are about to exit NC for good. Next stop: Damascus, VA! Here are some week 3-4ish highlights: Big Bald (TN) wildflowers Erwin, TN spontaneity Family visit Mast General Store 300 miles! 1 month on the trial Nap at Little Hump Mountain Seeing a mama deer with twin babies from my grandparents deckSelf gear shakedown and sending home about a pound or two of useless stuff New hiking shoes… already Rhododendron blooms at Roan MountainDriving for the first time in a month New friends! A field of my favorite flowers, Queen Anne’s Lace, in the woods of TN Cheerwine, finally!Beautiful balds in NC and the familiar view of Grandfather Mountain  Swimming in the Nolichucky River","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653233,"Week 5 was a bit of a switch up. After our zero at my grandparents house, Mushroom, Bear-Run and I took off for a 15 mile day. As we crossed the rhododendron covered balds of NC, we came across the perfect rocks on top of Little Hump Mtn. We stayed there for over an hour napping and hanging out, and realized we would not be making it 15 miles. Which is totally fine! We are still on pace. The theme of this week was taking breaks. We left NC for good, and cruised through TN. TN had the most water features we've seen yet. I went swimming in the Watauga River, swam in Laurel Fork Falls (a magical place!), and saw several other water falls along the way. We also tried aqua blazing on Watauga Lake, out of Boots Off Hostel, which was about an 8-10 mile kayak trip. We took our time and paddled around to an island with a rope swing, and it was so fun. 2 days later, and here we are at an amazing bed and breakfast in Damascus, VA. Currently at mile 470. Up next: Virginia! For 500 miles :) Highlights: BBQ in Damascus Kayaking on Watauga Lake Rope Swing Nap on Little Hump Mtn Lots of candy leftover from Mast General Store Seeing thru hiker friends in Damascus400 miles! Walking through a field of cows and being absolutely terrified Catching up with some folks in Damascus Movie night at the bed and breakfast Heat advisories… so sweaty… walking up a mountain in 97 degree heat… Swimming in Laurel Fork Falls by myself and escaping the TN heat Mornings where the light comes through the trees","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654209,"We left Damascus on a good note— bbq, wings, and live music. Damascus outfitters purchase of insoles led to much happier feet. Saw a bear cub on the hike out but didn’t wait around for the mama. A tough climb up to Whitetop Mountain was rewarded with amazing views and the perfect nap spot. Mt. Rogers didn’t have any views but was still cool since it’s the highest peak in Virginia. Made it to the Grayson Highlands, and wow! Saw the ponies on the walk in, and was so amazed. Camped at mile 499.9 with Mushroom, Bear-Run, Inspector, and Wikipedia. The next day, we all watched the sunrise together to celebrate the solstice. It was so beautiful, and what a great start to the day. We hit 500 miles! And I spent the morning hanging out with the wild ponies, which are so friendly they came up to us and licked us, and they’re so cute. Some of the babies were so little and could barely walk. It only got better when I saw my parents and grandparents in the parking lot. They brought us Bojangles chicken biscuits and sweet tea, which was so amazing. Mom and Dad even hiked about a mile or so with me back up to the highlands. What an amazing day all around, and the Grayson Highlands are my favorite place on the AT so far.","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654210,"A few days after Grayson Highlands, we hiked to the Partnership Shelter (where you can order pizza), and shuttled into Marion, VA, where I met up with boyfriend Sam who had to drive all the way from New Hampshire! We stayed at the Francis Marion Hotel and had a great zero day the next day. We got dinner at the Wooden Pickle and got some fried pickles. Sam hiked with the Muskrat Gang for a few days, which was awesome! We got really lucky this week, because there were a lot of places to stop close to the trail. We stopped the first night at Sweetwater Venue for dinner, where they make their own lemonade with honey. Mushroom made chocolate chip pancakes the next morning. Thanks Mushroom! We also hit the 1/4 way point. I can’t believe we are 1/4 of the way to Katahdin! This is going by too fast. The next day it poured rain. We had to ford Lick Creek, but thankfully made it before the rain started and the water was low. We cut the day short by 10 miles and ended up staying at Burkes Garden Hostel, which I highly recommend. Great place, super clean and very friendly hosts. 2 days later we came across Brushy Mountain Outpost, where we ate lunch, which included fried Oreos. We stayed at Helveys Mill Shelter and met Bill, a trail angel who leaves water at the shelter. He told us how to identify chestnut saplings, which grew in the area despite chestnuts being so rare after a blight killed most of them in the 1900s. Unfortunately most of them won’t live past the time the bark cracks when they mature, due to the blight, which means they are growing by spreading out underground from the same tree, and not actually sexually reproducing. We also made s’mores that night. The next day we arrived at Trent’s Grocery, after a swim in the creek nearby. This was a really sad day, because Sam left to go back to New Hampshire and Bear-Run also left to get off trail. He isn’t planning on returning, so we’re down a muskrat. Trent’s Grocery was also the place where the Lemonade Challenge was born, because I was so thirsty that I tried all the flavors of Calypso Lemonade. Mushroom is currently trying to complete the challenge, which has to be done in 24 hours. Trent’s Grocery also had the best biscuits I’ve ever eaten. Feeling sad at the end of this week, but so glad Sam and Bear-Run were there for a while.","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654211,"This week was… a lot. Things are getting real out here. Once Bear-Run left, our luck seemed to run out. After a lighter week, Mushroom and I planned to pick up some miles. The terrain in Virginia is very rolling and the hills aren’t extremely steep, so we were feeling good. We did 23 miles out of Trent’s Grocery. It was a sad hike. We camped at a spring, and it was so creepy. The first night won’t Bear-Run and we woke up at 1 am to a bear tromping around our campsite. I thought for sure our food would be gone in the morning. Mushroom had an air horn and blew it, and even that didn’t scare off the bear. We heard it getting closer for about an hour, and finally there was some silence. We were uneasy and it was a sleepless night after that. In the morning our food was miraculously still hung, but Mushroom saw the bear hanging around our camp. Spooky. The next day we did 23 more miles. I saw a bear, for the first time when I was by myself. It wasn’t too scary though, it was far away. I also saw a groundhog and a turtle, and according to a man I met there was a rattlesnake, although I didn’t see it. I also got my first blisters. The next morning I woke up to a HUGE spider above my head. My legs were exhausted, but I made it 18.5 miles to the next shelter. The next morning was beautiful, we passed through lots of pastures. I fell in some gravel but just scraped up my knee a little bit. Halfway through the day, I saw a horror— a HUGE rattlesnake was eating a squirrel in the middle of the trail. I screamed and ran back up the trail. It was rattling like crazy and hissing and opening it’s mouth around the squirrel. It scared me so badly, I was by myself. I had no choice but to go back and it was still rattling- what a horrible sound- and it eventually… detached… itself from the squirrel and slithered around for a few minutes. It was so creepy, and it slithered across the trail like it was showing off how long it was. And it was probably 3-4 feet, maybe longer. It finally got off trail far enough that I could run between it and the dead squirrel (which looked horrible by the way) and sprint to the next shelter. I was shaking and horrified, and then I heard Mushroom up the trail scream because she saw the squirrel. It was one of my worst trail experiences yet, I was so close I could see the inside of its mouth. A few miles later I got stung by a yellow jacket. We finally made it to the shelter, and the day was almost comical it was so bad. It was also the first day I didn’t see anyone else besides Mushroom. We’re in a remote area I guess. We also passed the Eastern Continental Divide. I took my first ibuprofen on trail because everything hurts. The next day (the Fourth of July) we made it to Catawba Grocery, after climbing Dragons Tooth. Ate some food, which I came to regret as I got food poisoning. I barely slept. We got up at 3:30 am to go see the sunrise on McAffe Knob. It was our first night hike experience, and it wasn’t too bad. The sunrise was beautiful! I still felt terrible, and that day hiked 19 miles on nothing but water and a cup of applesauce. Feeling woozy and dehydrated, I finally made it to Beech Hill Hostel. Right before the hostel, Mushroom and I saw a muskrat in a creek. I’m hoping it’s a good sign that our luck will improve. This week was a struggle, but I’m still making it and even enjoying myself.","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655637,"It has been a while since I’ve updated this journal and a lot has happened! After getting food poisoning, we made it to a hostel in Troutville, VA and I started to feel a little better. We passed the 1/3 mark! Mushroom and I met my dad and uncle in the Middle Creek Campground. They hiked with us for 2 days through a pretty tough section with lots of elevation gain, but hung in there! Had a lot of rain after several sweltering days and saw many bright orange Eastern Newts. Saw the James River! And crossed over the largest footbridge on the AT, and said goodbye near Glasgow. On Bluff Mountain, Mushroom and I met some wonderful women who offered to give us a ride into Buena Vista. They even waited for us to resupply and then drive us back to the trailhead. Trail angels indeed! Unfortunately I started to feel awful right after they dropped us off and I think I had norovirus. I couldn’t make it to the shelter and had to stealth camp alone for the first time, which was pretty scary. I saw 2 ticks at the campsite. I felt awful for about 24 hours and got really dehydrated and weak as I couldn’t eat. I made it to the shelter where Mushroom was waiting for me the next day, it took me an hour per mile to walk there. Thankfully the next day I felt a little better and was able to hike again. The day after we camped near Spy Rock and made it in time for sunset. It was so beautiful, and a great reminder of why I’m out here, after a mentally and physically tough few days. Soon after we hit the Priest and Three Ridges, a tough section. Mushroom and I took a blue blazes trail (Mau-Har) to see some waterfalls, and it was so difficult. Got to Reid’s Gap and met a trail angel named Ms. Janet, who has been driving her van from Georgia to Maine every year for quite some time. She gave us a ride to Devil’s Backbone Brewpub, where we got some food (I could finally eat something other than peanut butter and tortillas!) and a free campsite and shower. Ran into our friend Lard and met some new friends, including Sean. The next night we made it to Waynesboro, where we stayed at Stanimals Hostel and ate at Cookout, the first one we’ve seen on trail! Got new shoes at the outfitter in town, my third pair so far. Spent the next 6 days in Shenandoah, which was wonderful. I hiked there a lot last summer, usually with my friend Mimi, and it was great to see some familiar places. Shenandoah offered some flat sections and short climbs, and views near Skyline Drive. We saw so many deer, including many mamas and babies. We did our first marathon day, and generally hit a lot of big miles throughout the park. Another great thing about Shenandoah was the Waysides, where we could get real food, including the famous blackberry milkshakes, which were amazing. We stayed too long at a wayside one day and had to do some night hiking to make up some miles. I’m not really a fan of night hiking because it’s hard to see anything, it’s creepy, and my bedtime is 8 pm when I’m hiking. After leaving the park, we saw our first copperhead on trail in the fire pit at a shelter, which we did not stay at. Did some berry blazing (eating berries on trail) near Big Sky State Park. We hit 1000 miles! Which felt amazing, and unbelievable. Hiked “The Rollercoaster”, which seemed like VA giving us one more obstacle before letting us go. Crossed the West Virginia border. Finally, after 500 miles, we are out of Virginia. Met my parents and sister in Winchester and Harper’s Ferry. It was amazing to see them! Winchester was super cute, Harper’s Ferry was a bit of a letdown for being the spiritual halfway point. I did stop by the ATC and get my official thru hiker picture taken. Feeling really good, a lot of milestones and a huge morale boost to see my family. Mushroom and I decided a long time ago we would attempt the Maryland Challenge (hiking the whole state of MD (~40 miles) in less than 24 hours/on one sleep) and it was finally time. We cowboyed camped on the banks of the Potomac River, which was great to see the stars and awful when a huge weird bug crawling on my face woke me up. It was sandy but short, as we woke up at 4 am and left at 5 am. We crushed miles, hiking over 3 mph for the majority of the day. Adrenaline was high, and we blasted music in the pre dawn hours while getting spiderwebs to the face. MD was pretty cool, we passed some battlefields and the original Washington Monument. Saw a monarch butterfly, which recently got placed on the Endangered Species List. We had hiked 19 miles by noon, and hit 30 by 6 pm. We stopped for what might be considered dinner (meal 4/5 of the day), and continued on, cruising for the remaining daylight hours. Night fell and things got tough, we started to crash hard. Also, the smooth trail we’d had most of the day turned to huge rocks, and it was hard to discern where the trail was in the dark. We stumbled the last 3 miles, stopping at High Rock for some views of the city lights below. We finally made it to the Mason-Dixon Line around 11:15 pm to complete the challenge. I truly have no words for the exhaustion I felt while putting up my tent and it was hard not to just fall asleep in the grass. Went into Waynesboro, PA the next morning to resupply. We actually got an Uber, so we’re definitely getting out of the south. Got some great strawberry tres leches cake at Cafe du Sol, in town. Took a few slow days (<15 mi), and recovered from the MD challenge. Stayed at the best shelter on trail, Quarry Gap Shelter. It’s so cute and homey! Thank you shelter overseers. The next day we hit the numerical halfway point at mile 1097.15! Can’t wait for the next half of this journey, which has already been so life changing. We also hit 1100 miles! And had our second challenge of the week: Half Gallon Challenge. We each ate a half gallon of ice cream from Pine Grove Furnace General Store, and honestly, this challenge was easy. I was still hungry after finishing my half gallon. Thru hiking is crazy. The next few days were filled with misty rain, cornfields, and scattered rocks. Pennsylvania is beautiful so far. Mushroom’s brother joined us for a day, and we got ice cream from some Amish children and they even let us pet their cow. We passed through Boiling Springs, where there was an adorable duck pond. We stayed at a campsite where there were a lot of screech owls, which oddly sounded like neighing horses. Google helped solve that mystery (try googling: neighing horses but no horses?). We met our first SOBOs (south bounders)! We’re getting closer to Katahdin every day. Now we are staying at a hostel in Duncannon, where we stopped to resupply and fuel up. Weird town but the ice cream place has good hot fudge sundaes. Next up, Rocksylvania ;)","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656182,"From Duncannon, things got… rocky. So many rocks. Small ones which sent me sliding, awkwardly placed/sized pointy ones which stabbed my feet on every step, and large boulders that I ungracefully inched over. Rocksylvania was living up to its name, and after two 25 mile days in a row, Mushroom and I were left miserable. We decided to lower our mileage, and ended up going around 15-18 miles a day instead of 17-25. That seemed to help the feet, but our minds were starting to wander. At this point, some of our friends are a day or two ahead, and some are a day or two behind. Which leave us with only each other, which can get lonely. Furthermore, PA (I’m sorry to everyone who admires this state) is not very interesting. It’s low in elevation and the views are mostly farms in the valleys below, which have their own charm but lack the breathtaking awe of much larger mountains. It is also very exhausting to painstakingly plan out every footfall and focus intently on the ground for hours at a time, which was necessary because… rocks. I will also mention the last zero I took was in Marion, VA and the fatigue is starting to hit me hard, especially on exceedingly hot days. But I can’t complain too much, for there have also been some good moments in PA. We have gotten some excellent trail magic. We planned to camp a few days ago at the Blue Mountain Diner (we have been trying to camp in towns because the water is so dried up that even the shelters are not reliable). However, it was going to storm, and we met a lovely woman and her husband who kindly offered to take us in for the night. Wow! One of my favorite things about the AT is feeling the generosity of strangers. I felt like they were my family, as we all watched Family Feud while they did our laundry and gave us homemade sticky buns. They had a beautiful house on a large tract of land which included a pasture, where the lady kept two horses. It was such a nice relief from the heat. The next day we also met a local man (4-Legs) who offered us subs, cold sodas, chips, and candy. What a trail angel. It put some pep in our step as we finished up our time in PA. Today we reached Delaware Water Gap, which is a very cute town with a great place called the Apple Pie Bakery, which offers a “True Love Special” of a hotdog and a slice of apple pie for $4.95. It was amazing. I also got a banana split to celebrate finishing PA. Next up: New Jersey!

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658004,"Mushroom and I enjoyed breakfast in Delaware Water Gap and then continued on to hit some exciting milestones- the New Jersey border (goodbye and good riddance, PA!) and 1300 miles. We passed Sunfish Pond, a beautiful glacial lake, where we saw 9 frogs on a log. Unfortunately I got a hornet stuck in my sock (funny how often this happens on trail) and was stung at least 4 times in the same spot— who knew hornets could draw blood. Ow. Okay, up next we climbed a fire tower where we caught the caretaker leaving. He kindly climbed back up to give us the grand tour, and thankfully he did because we actually spotted a forest fire. Did I mention it’s been very dry and hot recently? The best part of the fire tower was the really cool old maps on the walls. The next day we passed another lake (Kittatinny), and hung out at Gyp’s Tavern for a bit. The next day we passed the veterans monument at High Point State Park, the highest point in NJ, and stopped at another lake to hit up the snack stand. A few miles later I met up with Sam at a random parking lot, and we hiked together to the Secret Shelter. This shelter is not an official AT shelter, but someone’s private land which has been generously offered to thru hikers as a camping spot. The shelter’s caretaker is… Jake the Donkey. The best donkey to ever exist, he has lovely fluffy ears and begs for everyone’s snacks. The next day I originally planned for me and Sam to hike about 17 miles but I decided to get off trail a little early, and we spent the rest of the day in Sussex. I zeroed the next day, and ended up missing some miles. Hopefully I can come back and do the Stairway to Heaven, but in general I’m not really an AT purist and think missing a few miles doesn’t take away from my thru hike. The next morning I had to say bye to Sam at the Bellvale Creamery, where I met back up with Mushroom and her uncle and aunt picked us up. We slackpacked from Mushroom’s uncle’s house for the next few days which was super nice. We we’re both feeling beat after not taking a zero since Marion, VA. We got really great trail magic— cheeseburgers, hot dogs, pancakes, and sodas. Thanks Tuxedo Trail Angels! We cruised through Harriman State Park, and due to the drought the leaves we’re all dead on the ground so it seemed kinda fall-like and was very pretty. We hit 1400 miles, and saw views of Manhattan from Bear Mountain. Unfortunately there was a lot of litter so we spent some time cleaning up what we could, but it was disgusting. I hate seeing people throw garbage right next to the garage can. Mushroom and I carry our trash on our backs for days at a time, and certain lazy people can’t use a trash can right in front of them… it really is sickening that some people feel okay disrespecting this planet. We ended up trail running down Bear Mountain a bit, and I twisted my ankle, but thankfully we had a zero planned the next day at her uncle’s house so I had time to rest. The zero was fun— a somewhat cloudy pool day. I always feel anxious off trail about getting behind, but I had to remind myself that we deserve to rest when we’re tired. The next day we were back with our full packs, and they felt heavy. We went through Bear Mountain Trailside Zoo, and saw many adorable animals like a porcupine, a beaver, and 2 bears. The zoo hosts animals which have been injured around Bear Mountain. We ate lunch on the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson River. Later, we saw a small bear— the first one since VA! That night we camped near a parking lot on Dennytown Road. Around midnight, 3 charter buses pulled up and one almost ran over my tent while I was inside. Thankfully the driver saw me and stopped but the exhaust was blowing right in my tent. I was confused and scared and stayed inside my tent. It got worse because the drivers dumped a ton of trash in the parking lot! Bags full… just everywhere. I noticed it started to smell like a porta potty but assumed it was just the exhaust. Finally they left, but not before I got a picture of their license plates. In the morning we realized they had dumped raw sewage right next to my tent. I felt sick, physically and emotionally. I reported them, but was essentially told by the state of NY that it was the state park issue and they couldn’t do anything. I spent the day so angry at these people. Also, after they left the parking lot they went across the street and dropped off a ton of kids in some religious camp and at 1 AM they were doing some chanting into a microphone. This is the not so glamorous side of the AT… you really see everything out here. The next day we made it to Route 22, where there’s a small train station. My friend AC and her boyfriend Kevin came to pick me up and I went to their apartment in Secaucus, NJ. My friend Camille met up with us too, and we went into NYC. Mushroom stayed on trail and her friend James who lives in NYC came out to hike with her. We went out in the city, and it was extremely fun and overwhelming to be around so much activity and people. The next day we got brunch, and watched a lot of Love Island. It was an amazing zero day, I was so glad to see my college friends!*These posts are old, I’m currently in the White Mountains in NH","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658418,"The next morning Kevin helped me navigate the subway and the trains back to the trail, and I quickly hiked 19 miles to catch up with Mushroom in Kent, CT. Passing the border of CT felt really good, and the terrain was so smooth I was able to cruise at 3 mph pace, which I haven’t been able to do in a while. Mushroom had zeroed at her house to wait for me, and she picked me up in her baby blue convertible Beetle, waiting with a cooler full of cold drinks and a bag of chips. What a great surprise! We drove back to Mushroom’s house and her mom cooked us dinner. The next day we ran into our fiend Casper, who we hadn’t seen since VA! The next day we took a zero at Nina’s house. Soon after, we reached 1,500 miles! What a great feeling. We passed the highest point in CT, Giant’s Thumb, Bear Mtn, Mt. Race, and Mt. Everett. There were a few steep climbs and rain made the rocks very slippery. Soon we passed into MA. We stopped at a swimming hole at Sage’s Ravine. MA was full of beautiful lakes. We stopped at Upper Goose Pond Cabin, which sadly was closed, so we missed out on some free pancakes and canoeing. Mushroom and I swam in the lake anyways! Mushroom met some boat people who gave us burgers and peaches. The next day was magical— we stopped at the Cookie Lady’s farm, Blueberry Hill, where the caretakers provide homemade cookies and lemonade to thru hikers. We got to pick some blueberries too. It was so cute, and I kinda wanted to stay forever. The next day we made it to Mt. Greylock, which reminded me of Clingman’s Dome with all the fur and red squirrels. There was an awesome view from the top of the tower.*Still catching up on posts, I’m currently near Carabasset Valley, ME and have about 200 miles left!","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658583,"The next day was a marathon day (26.2 mi), during which we passed the 1,600 miles mark. We also passed the Vermont border! The first 105 miles of VT intersects with the Long Trail. and later stopped at Glastonbury Fire Tower for some epic (but windy) views. Later, we saw our first porcupine, although it was dead. So we followed a trail of quills and saw the bones of a porcupine, which was still great because I could touch a quill without touching a live porcupine! It wasn’t as pointy as I expected. The culprit was likely a fisher cat. The next day we cruised 22.8 miles and saw some awesome log book art. We stopped at a stealth site on Stratton Mountain, and suffered a freezing night of 36 degrees (the first time it dropped below 40 on trail). The next morning it was very cold (neither of us had our cold gear yet), and we quickly walked to Manchester Center, where Mushroom’s childhood neighbors lived. We stayed at their house for the night, along with their 4 dogs, 2 horses, 2 chickens, and 2 cats. It was an awesome house, and they told us all about maple syrup production. A highlight of the day was getting to paint an official white blaze! Thanks to a shelter caretaker named Pterodactyl (you rock!). We also passed the “3/4 of the way done” mark. The next morning we got treated to a diner for breakfast before we hopped back on trail, for a short day up Bromley Mountain. We got picked up at Mad Tom Notch Road by my college friend Camille! We got to stay at her house in South Londonderry for the next 2 nights. Another college friend of mine, AC, came to visit as well. It was so great to see them again! They made me cupcakes because my 22nd birthday was the next day. On my birthday, Mushroom and I got to slackpack, and Bear-Run drove up from Boston to hike with us for the day! It was so cool to see him again, and he surprised me with a Bearclaw with a candle, because of an inside joke. We definitely miss having him around, and I wish he could’ve stayed longer! The next morning we left early and got back on trail. We met Mushroom’s parents for lunch! Then it started raining a lot. The next day we went 20.4 miles, which included a small river fording, Mt. Killington, and getting picked up by Melissa and Dan! They are a lovely couple we met in Georgia and they invited us to their home for several days. We got to slackpack for the next 2 days, which allowed us to cover a lot of ground. We hit 1700 miles, and passed “Maine Junction”, where the Long Trail splits from the AT. We passed Kent Pond, Thundering Falls, and saw a bear cub. While we stayed at Dan and Melissa’s house, we also got to watch frozen 1 and 2, which was a blessing and a curse because the songs have been stuck in my head ever since (I’m currently 115 miles from Mt. Katahdin). It was a tough day back to reality of a full pack the next day… (to be continued). Vermont is very special, and was so green and beautiful and muddy. And we got to sleep inside so much. One of my favorite states by far. I miss you already Ver-Mud.","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659903,"Mushroom and I woke up early to catch the AT Lodge shuttle back to Abol Bridge. After eating our hiker box oatmeal, we experienced a very bumpy ride, thanks to the ruralness of the area and the rugged dirt roads. Today, our goal was to hike the 10 miles from Abol Bridge to The Birches, the campground designated for AT thru hikers in Baxter State Park. Mushroom had a migraine, and I was so tired I couldn’t stand it. We spent the day eating a large amount of snacks and hiking painfully slow miles that should’ve felt easy. After the push through the 100 mile wilderness, we were exhausted, yet couldn’t relent so close to the end. We stopped to see Little Niagra Falls, and took our time. There was no rush today– it was a beautiful day, and this was almost the end. The day was enormously bittersweet. I spent the entire 10 miles saying my goodbyes– 
Goodbye to the roots I tripped over
To the mud that tried to swallow my shoes
To the earth below which held my every footstep
To the trees which shaded me
To the sun which warmed me
To the squirrels that mocked me
To the rocks I overcame
To the rivers I forded
To the friends who became family
To the rain which washed over me
To the strangers who showed me kindness
To my backpack and my tent 
To the shadows which scared me 
And the sunrises which comforted me 
To the mountains which broke me and made me whole
And to this version of myself 
Goodbye to it all
Goodbye to the Appalachian Trail, which had become my home
I cried a lot that day, overjoyed and heartbroken at the same time. When Mushroom and I arrived at Katahdin Streams Campground, we got some water from Katahdin Stream. It was the best water I’ve ever had. For the first time on trail, I thought about not filtering it, because it was so clear. We were the first ones to The Birches, and I took a very long nap. I woke up to old friends and new, including Mushroom, .50 cal, Morpheus, Johnny Walker, Summer School, Watercolor, Willow, Hitch, and John Deere. Some trail angels we had met earlier, AT ’08, brought us pizza and a bottle of Winter Jack. All 10 of us sat around the fire in disbelief, passing around a cup of whiskey mixed with apple cider, crying and laughing as we realized this was really the end. I had the overwhelming sense that my life would never be more beautiful than in this moment. 
The next morning I woke up at 5:30 am and took it all in, my last day waking up in an AT shelter. I could hardly believe it, and I felt like I wasn’t ready. My day started like any other day, packing up my sleeping stuff, making oatmeal and hot chocolate, and packing my backpack. Except this time I put all my stuff in a trash bag, and just kept my 2 dingy smartwater bottles and a few snacks in my pack. Mushroom and I walked the quarter mile to Katahdin Stream Campground and left our stuff in the shelter there. We filtered water for the last time, and made our way with our mostly empty packs to the base of Mt. Katahdin. We passed a sign– 5 miles to Baxter Peak. It was a surreal moment, knowing we were so close after coming so far. We had heard this climb would be tough, were warned to start early and bring headlamps in case it got dark on us. However, fueled by a strange mix of adrenaline, euphoria, and crushing sadness, Mushroom and I climbed up rather quickly. Within an hour and a half, we stopped for out typical 9:30 snack break- the last one. Mt. Katahdin was probably one of the most technical sections we’d experienced, but the Whites and the Mahoosucs had prepared us for anything. There were huge boulders, and a lot of rock scrambling. One half of me was ecstatic, and the other half was trembling. As we got closer and closer, I couldn’t help but panic. I just wasn’t ready for it all to be over, and to let go of this journey which had remade me. Mushroom and I celebrated our summit day, but also mourned the end of our journey. After breaking treeline, I could see the entire ridge ahead. I thought we were sumitting, and I saw a sign, and thought it was the end. I broke down in tears, suddenly grateful for it all. Yet I was also relieved, and let go of a fear I had been carrying all along, because I knew in that moment that I was going to make it to the end. I didn’t fail, and I was never going to. It was during this epiphany that I realized it was a “watch for fragile alpine vegetation sign.” After recovering from this, we reached a flat plain, and saw a little bit of snow. I have never seen such breathtaking views, and cried some more just for the scenery. We had one mile to go, for real this time. Then we had the final climb. It was obvious what awaited at the top. Then I caught my first glimpse of the iconic sign, the northern terminus, and heard many, many cheers, from familiar and unfamiliar faces. I felt completely undone, wanted to sob, but only managed some silent crying while trying to breathe. I was severley in shock, yet so proud of myself, of Mushroom, and of everyone who came so far in their journey. No words can describe the feeling that comes at the end of a thru hike that brought my soul back to life. I felt restored and crushed. We sat at the top for 2 hours, soaking it all in. It felt like 5 minutes. We watched our friends summit, and laugh, and cry. There is a bond... Eventually Mushroom and I were ready to head back down. We took the Abol Trail; we weren’t on the AT anymore. It was surreal, so happy and so sad. We traveled so far, endured so much, and I had the best time of my life. A piece of me will always live on the Appalachian Trail. Thanks for everything…

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658791,"Oh NH— a state from nightmares. So beautiful, yet so cold, with such bad weather. Okay, here’s what happened: Back to a full backpack, the journey into NH was heavy. We crossed the border and entered Hanover, home to Dartmouth. We observed a college student spend $1000 on sweatshirts at the bookstore… I guess that’s Ivy League. The campus is so beautiful. We had lunch (and ice cream, of course) in town and then walked a few more miles where we got kicked up by another of Mushroom’s childhood neighbors. We spent the evening watching Always be my Maybe on Netflix and eating pasta and apple pie. The next day was the real “back to reality” and we were slow moving. We trudged 17.5 miles to Smarts Fire Tower. We had to take a lot of breaks, because I kept getting really dizzy. We went over Moose Mountain, and saw no moose. But 2 miles from the fire tower, we finally saw a porcupine! What awesome animals. It wasn’t scared at all, in fact it slowly lumbered over to us and minded it’s business eating some plants. We spent a long time watching it, and hiked in the dark to the fire tower. We arrived after sunset, but got a beautiful view of a super bright moon and tons of stars. Plus we got to sleep in a fire tower, which was an AT bucket list item. The next day was uneventful, we camped by Wachupauka Lake. We did hear some loons, which sound kinda wolfy. The next day we had our first New England 4,000 footer: Mt. Mousilake. Wow- what a climb. Endless rock stairs up for miles, with a clouded view at the top. The way down was treacherous. The trail was built almost on top of a waterfall, and there weren’t nearly enough footholds. At one point, 1 mile took 2 hours. We did meet some new friends though: Super Glue, Pig Pen, and Backwards. After conquering Mousilake, we trekked on, suffering up another huge uphill. I was exhausted, and had to crawl under a log on my hands and knees through the mud. Anything for the AT. We got to camp late, when the sun was setting. Mushroom and I agreed to never go 19 miles through this terrain again. The next day was a sobering 8.8 miles, as we went over South and North Kinsman in the rain. Thankfully we had to resupply and hopped off trail to stay at Old Colony Ski Lodge, a new hostel that I would highly recommend. I picked up some of my winter gear at the post office in Lincoln, NH. The next day we got back on trail and went over Little Haystack (which is NOT little), Mt. Lincoln, Mt. Lafayette, and Franconia Ridge. The weather was so awful. It was freezing, with temperatures in the 30-40s and winds 50-70 mph, gusting up to 90 mph. There was no view, we were completely shocked in, and the air was wet because we were in the clouds. Every step was a battle against the wind, and I was suddenly thankful for the obscene amount of food in my backpack, weighing me down. This was the first time on trail I felt really scared, like oh s*** we should not be on this mountain right now. I got blown over into a bush (sorry fragile alpine plants!). After what felt like forever, we finally crossed the 3 mile traverse of exposed ridge line and made it back under the trees. We were shivering, soaked, and hungry. We stopped for a miserable but necessary lunch break and kept going. We stopped at Galehead Hut and thankfully got work for stay (simple chores in exchange for a place to sleep on the floor). Although the hut didn’t have heating, it was nice to be out of the wind. The next day we crossed Galehead Mtn and the South Twins. We finally got some sun, and some good views. It was very cold, but beautiful, especially around Zealand Hut, where we stopped for lunch. We got to camp early after an unexpected flat stretch after Zealand Hut, but that was fine with us, we were exhausted. We stayed at Ethan Pond Shelter, and had a frigid night. Temperatures dropped to 32 degrees for the first time on trail, and the winds were whipping all night. We barely slept. The next day we went over Mt. Webster and Mt. Jackson, and camped near Mizpah Hut. After another cold night, we hiked the 6 miles to the top of Mount Washington. We had beautiful weather, and the views reminded me of the Lord of the Rings movies. We stopped at Lake of the Clouds hut for a lunch break. We took the shuttle down the auto road to meet Mushroom’s parents. We got spoiled- BBQ, a box of donuts, and hotel beds. The next day we planned to take the shuttle back up Mt. Washington. However, the conditions were awful, similar to what we experienced on Franconia Ridge, except this time we would be above tree line for 12 miles. We decided to wait it out and stay in town. We found a bunkhouse in Glen, NH, and ended up taking our first double zero there. We watched Sing 2 and a reality show on Netflix called Dated and Related (yep, it’s as trashy and amazing as it sounds). On the second day at the bunkhouse, our friend Casper showed up! It was great to be reunited. The next day we all shuttled back to the shuttle pick up and went up the auto road. The weather was still bad, but not dangerous. It was hard hiking, the descent from Mt. Washington/Mt. Madison was awful. Endless slippery rocks accompanied by a constant drizzle of rain. We ran into Easy headed south (he flipped up from Harpers Ferry), which was an awesome surprise. The hiking was slow, and we had to hike the last 3 miles to camp in the dark. We were exhausted, but made it over the Presidential Traverse. The next day was really hard. We had a nice time until Pinkham Notch, but the climb up was the hardest I’ve ever done. The Wildcats were brutal- bouldering, vertical slabs of rock, aching fingers and knees. Then a STEEP descent to Carter Notch. We finally made it to Carter Notch Hut, and thankfully got work for stay, and this time the crew generously let us stay in the bunks. The next day was a TOUGH climb up to Carter Dome. It was very windy, rainy, and cold. We crossed the Carter Range: Carter Dome, Mt. Hight, South Carter, Middle Carter, North Carter. We got to Imp Shelter and were in pure misery. We unanimously decided to call it quits and stay for the rest of the day. It took hours huddled in all our dry clothes and sleeping bags to get feeling in our fingers and toes. The next day my stove caught on fire, which was a disappointment. Thankfully we were going into Gorham anyways, and I bought a new stove. After Mt. Moriah, it was a nice walk down to Gorham. We forded Rattle River, which was only shin deep. We hitched to Gorham with newly finished thru hiker French Fry. We got huge cinnamon rolls at the cafe, and then hit up the BBQ place. We ran into a lot of our friends, and met some new ones- 8 Eyes, Tree Keeper, Slipper, Crossroads, Scraps, and Grips. So awesome to catch up and meet some new folks. We resupplied at Dollar General and hitched to the White Birches hostel, where we ran into Lard. We ordered pizza and did some Mad Libs, and overall had a great night to celebrate the end of the Whites. The next day we headed out early and got a hitch from a woman who had just returned from Idaho on a road trip in her van with her dog. We saw snow on Mt. Washington, it’s very easy to recognize. We went over Mt. Success, dealt with some crazy alpine bogs, and hit 1900 miles.*Catching up on posts from off trail… I summited Mt. Katahdin on 10/12/2022 and have successfully finished my AT thru hike! More to come…","

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659799,"Shortly afterwards, we crossed into Maine. It was a bittersweet moment as we passed into the final state. We had conquered the Whites, but our next challenge was the Mahoosuc Range in Southern Maine. As the sun was setting, we experienced the first of the tough terrain of Maine and navigated a steep, boulder filled ravine. This was a sneak peak of the next day, when we crossed the Mahoosuc Notch, a 1 mile stretch known as the funnest and hardest part of the AT. Getting through the Notch was a lot of crawling and climbing under and over huge boulders. It took us about 2 hours to get through. To get out of the Notch, we climbed up the Mahoosuc Arm. We ran into Birthday Girl, the 76 year old woman we met in the Shenandoah. At the shelter, we ran into Pig Pen and Backwards. Not only did we have ravines, Southern Maine treated us to a lot of alpine bogs. The alpine bogs were no joke, unlike the rotting or nonexistent bog boards. Mushroom fell in up to her thigh and I had to pull her out, after taking a picture, of course. The next day I was dreaming about donuts, when we crossed into a parking lot to find Jolly Rancher, who had just finished her thru hike, with a dozen donuts. The trail really does provide! We met two 18 year olds, Watercolors and Dynamite. At the campsite, we ran into Dairy Queen and Burger King. That night there was a terrible thunderstorm and we experienced hail from inside our tents. My beautiful orange Big Agnes tent had, by this point, some issues with taking on water when it rained heavily, and I spent the night marooned on my camping pad, helplessly watching my gear get drenched. Mushroom and I headed out early, and watched a beautiful sunrise. We trekked down to the road after several ankle-deep stream crossings, where we got picked up by our friend Casper and his girlfriend, Grace, and headed into Andover for a resupply. We got two boxes of donuts from Hannafords and devoured them in the parking lot while waiting for our tents to dry. With September on the horizon, we didn't have time to stay in town, so we hiked a painful 3 miles up Old Blue Mountain. We pushed to barely beat the sunset, and camped in a muddy, sloped spot just big enough for Big Tomato (my tent) and Casper's hammock. The next day we picked up some mileage and made it to Swift River Pond. The highlight of the day was a gorgeous lunch spot on ME Scenic Highway. We awoke to a beautiful sunrise over the lake and headed off shortly after day break. While rushing towards Katahdin, we still wanted to experience the trail day-by-day. This particular day turned out to be unexpectedly amazing, which makes it one of my favorite days on-trail. We stopped for a long canoe break on South Pond, and couldn't help but miss Bear-Run, who is a huge canoe enthusiast. After getting back on-trail, we stumbled upon our first moose! He was a big bull moose, and we just caught a glimpse of him up the trail, but it was magical. The next day was a speedy hike down to the road, after going over Crocker Mountain. We met Sally Rose, who is my college friend Glenn's mom. She generously drove out to give us some trail magic, including shower bags, a ride to the Hostel of Maine and a small general store for resupply, and she took us out to lunch at Sugarloaf Ski Resort. It was amazing, and thanks to Sally, we were able to get back on trail for some more miles. We had a few easy miles, and then a tough climb up the hill to Horns Pond Shelter. On the way, we hit 2000 miles! This was a huge moment. We had a cold night and morning, and crossed over the Bigelows, which were so absolutely beautiful. This climb instantly got on my list of favorite spots on the AT, and I can't wait to go back and do it again. There was frost on the plants, and we saw a glimpse of a huge white snowshoe hare. We were warmed by the afternoon sun and sat by Flagstaff Lake, which would be a great swimming location in warmer weather. Mushroom and I wanted to get to Terrapin Hostel, and were relying on the kindness of strangers for a ride. As usual, the trail provides, and the first car that passed pulled over for us. The kind lady we met (I forgot her name), drove us 45 minutes to the hostel in Kingfield, ME. Mushroom and I decided to celebrate conquering the Whites, the Mahoosucs, and 2000 miles. We got surf and turf, pumpkin beer, and dessert. The next morning we started out and realized that we had made it to the nice part of Maine. It was a beautiful day, and we felt like we were in an autumn wonderland. We even wandered upon 2 moose, a lady moose and a bull moose. We ate lunch by a beautiful lake, and scurried to catch Sheryl's shuttle across the Kennebec River. We waded out where Sheryl could get the boat to in the rough current, threw in our packs, and helped paddle across the river. Sheryl drove us to the Sterling Inn, where we could shower and do laundry. We ran into Dune again, for the first time since briefly crossing paths during the Maryland Challenge. We all watched Enchanted together and went to bed happy to be inside. The next day, we slept in–– so we were back on trail by 8:30. We ran into a bear hunter, and his radio-collared hound dogs.

Tuna,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659800,"The next day, had to ford a mud hole and a river. We finally made it to Monson, the last stop before the 100 mile wilderness. We had some issued picking up my package of new shoes, and resolved ourselves to staying at Lakeshore Pub and Hostel. We ran into Double D's again, which was nice. Disappointingly, Monson had somewhat of a bad vibe and nothing went right logistically, so we got a late start getting out the next day. This would become a problem because, we had a goal to get through the 100 mile wilderness in 5 days and 4 nights, which meant about 20 miles a day. We planned it like this because there's no places to resupply between Monson and Abol Bridge, which is about 100 miles, and we didn't want to pay for a food drop or carry more than 5 days of food. The first day out of Monson, we only hiked about 10 miles. We were exhausted, but I had my new shoes! We had our first big stream crossing, through knee/thigh deep COLD water. Mushroom and I did what you're not supposed to do, and crossed barefoot. The rocks were slippery, and I relied on my trekking poles like crutches to get across. Mushroom relied on the sketchy rope overhanging the river, and fell in 3 times. She, and all her gear, got completely soaked. We hiked another half mile to the shelter and called it a night. It was a day of slow, painful miles. The next morning we got an early start, and got in 20 miles. The miles creeped by, even with my audio book. We met up with my college friend Glenn, who had planned on being in the area regardless, and the stars aligned and he took us to an AMC hut. He brought snacks galore, and got us free dinner and a room to stay out of the rain. It was extremely generous, and made the day a million times better. The next day, we got a ride from the bunkhouse back to trail with the only other person staying, who coincidentally was a former AT thru hiker. Like I said, the stars aligned. We immediately had to ford a freezing cold river. Then we went over the White Caps, the biggest mountain in the 100 mile wilderness. There was snow on the trees, as the high was 36 degrees. It was cold, and it was wearing on us mentally and physically. But we were too close to give up now... For the first time, we saw Mt. Katahdin from a distance. Our time on the AT was rapidly coming to a close, and there were so many feelings. At this point, we hadn't reached our mileage goals at all, and we had to make it up or we would run out of food. Neither of us had any extra, due to the bad resupply in Monson and our constant hunger, which was multiplied because of the cold. The next morning, we woke up at 4:30 and left by 6:30. We hiked 30 miles, and stopped 3 times. By the end of the day, my feet HURT. The fatigue was enormous, and I waddled into camp sadly because my CNOC bag, which I used to filter water, broke. However, our push was rewarded by finally meeting .50 cal and Morpheus, whom we had followed the entire trail and seen their log book entries since Virginia. The next day we woke up at 5:30 and headed out of camp. We went over Nesuntabunt Mountain, and saw a beautiful view of Katahdin. Frost was evaporating off the lake below, and a tiny red squirrel ate a pine cone while I ate my fruit snacks. Although we were in a rush, because .50 cal and Morpheus had promised us a ride with their families to town if we made it on time, we decided to take our time. It was our third to last day on-trail, and everything felt like the bittersweet end. The 23 miles to Abol Bridge came sooner than I anticipated, and we exited the 100 mile wilderness with a stunning view of Mt. Katahdin, which is a single huge mountain rising out of the mostly flat landscape. We met .50 cal and Morpheus' parents, and received some of the best trail magic to date. They brought us Subway sandwiches, AT cookies, and took us out to dinner with them. All of this, from strangers whose children we had befriended only the day before, in pitch blackness. The even drove us to the AT Lodge in Millinocket, the closest town to Mt. Katahdin. There, we ran into Super Glue, who had summited earlier that day. It was amazing to see him, as we lost him in the Whites when we got off of Mount Washington in the bad weather. Since Mushroom and I had gotten into town so late, no stores were open to resupply. We picked up some snacks from the hiker box at the lodge. We only needed food for 2 more days...",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Mon",0
