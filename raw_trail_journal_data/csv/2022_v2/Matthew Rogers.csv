Matthew Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648202,"After a homemade meal and saying goodbye to my brother and sister, my parents and I drove down to Amicolola Falls, Georgia, about 4.5 hours from Waxhaw.  We grabbed some Bojangles on the way and arrived at 2:30pm.  I started hiking at 3pm and arrived at Black Gap shelter around 630p.  It was a good stress test on the pack, shoes, and socks.  No blisters!They're calling for rain in 2 days, so I'm going to push myself tomorrow to get out of the zone.  I probably won't be updating daily but we'll see.","Amicalola Falls

Matthew Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649147,"Can't believe I've been on the trail 18 days, feels both longer and shorter.  I've been through snow, rain, wind, mud, and freezing temperatures between Neels Gap and Fontana Dam, my current location.  Taking a zero today to prepare myself for the Smokies which should prove to be the most difficult challenge yet.Haven't gotten any new blisters, but my knees have taken a beating from the steep and rocky downhills.  A part of that problem is that I switched from a thick midweight boot to a lighter zero drop shoe and haven't been pacing myself to condition to the new footwear.  Hopefully a long rest today will make up for that.I've met so many fellow hikers in such a short amount of time that I tried listing the names in my journal and come out with over 30 names just from who I remember.  Though finishing the AT has been the goal, through experience and talking to some of the older crowd on the trail, I've come to realize the most important and exciting aspect of this adventure is the people I'll meet and the stories they tell.  I plan to espouse on some of those in future posts.Speaking of, I'm thinking of vlogging the trip via youtube instead of writing it all out here.  The visuals would be more compelling and I won't have to spend near as much time typing on a smartphone, which is one of the reasons I haven't been updating as often as I'd like.  I'll post link to my YouTube if I decide to go that route.","Fontana Dam

Matthew Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649169,"Been wearing a hat from Sundog Outfitters in Damascus most days on the trail, people got to calling me ""Sundog"" and eventually the name stuck, so Sundog is my official trail name.  I dig it!  Here are some of the other names of people I've met along the way in no particular order:
Ten-Year (or Tenure?) - older gentleman whose been on the trail over 10 years doing section hikes that he's earned tenure.
Three-peat - this is his third thru hike, once every 10 years
Lil Peak - from New Zealand, when we started out and people were complaining about the constant uphill and downhill, she'd tell them they're ""just little peaks""
Prince - did a lot of hiking with him to start out, he was high maintenance and hated getting wet, people wanted to call him Princess but eventually settled on Prince.  Other considerations were Q-Tip and Doogie Howser.
Camel - she drinks a lot of water.
Flamethrower - didn't get the full story, but something about using his stove and lighting everything on fire.
Slow and Slower - two older men hiking together and just enjoying their time on the trail, regardless of pace.
Gilligan - wears a bucket hat
Tropic Thunder - very laid back aesthetic.  Sandals, hawaiian shirt, sunglasses, wavy brown hair.
Ingles (pronounced in the Spanish vernacular) - had never heard of the grocery store and thought it was a Spanish place.  Kept referring to it in the Spanish sense.
These are just a few.  All good people, all fond memories.  Some I know I'll see again, some I doubt I'll ever see again.  Picture was of a few of them one night in Helen, GA enjoying some food and beer.","

Matthew Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652534,"Ohhh boy has it been a while!  Don't worry, I'm still on trail and have a couple major updates.  I'll start at the earliest milestone and go forward.
The Fontana Dam shelter is often referred to as the ""Fontana Hilton"" due to the exceptional amenities.  It's located right off a paved road, has access to a heated bathhouse, and the shelter itself can sleep 12 along with the dozen or so tent sites in close proximity.
At this point I'm more or less hiking solo.  I know most of the hikers I'm currently with at the Fontana Hilton:  Hillary and her group that include Mirko, Christian, Mike and Tyler (none of which had adopted trail names at this point), Gilligan and his group of 2 Bars, her brother, Tropic Thunder, Tropic Thunders Dog, and Pebbles, and several solo hikers.  We talk and mingle for a bit until the sun goes down and call it an early night.  I wake up at 5am to use the hot shower before the crowd gets going and head for the southern entrance of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.
The immediate ascent strains my achilles and calves to their limits.  After the initial climb it got a little better, but the Smokys are full of ups and downs, and little ridges that meander like a river so you could never quite see what lay ahead, or how much more climb there was ahead of you.  While the moss covered, old-growth forests were among my favorite pieces of scenery I've ever encountered, the Smokys were also the first time I threw my trekking poles down in frustration.  I had passed a sign a few hours ago that stated the next shelter was 5 miles ahead, and I thought I had a good read on my pace, but every turn in the trail brought more ridges, more up and downs, and more rocks and roots.  Defeated, I sat on a nearby stump and pulled some dinner out of the backpack.
When I began the AT, the only map I had was a physical booklet: The Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers Companion. It provided distances between shelters, water sources, significant viewpoints or points of interest, and elevations at these locations. I had been hesitant to download phone apps when I started; one because I was trying to detox myself from digital stimulation and two because relying on electronics in the wilderness didn't feel like the best choice. However, after seeing 95% of my fellow hikers use the Farout app (formerly known and Guthook), I bit the bullet and bought the app. On top of providing the same information as the Thru-Hikers Companion, it also had info regarding hostels, resupply points, user comments, and most importantly a GPS-enabled topographic map that provided real-time and precise location data of where you are on trail and distances to waypoints.
I had tried my best up to this point to use the app sparingly, but I begrudgingly whipped the phone out and opened the app to figure out how far I was from the shelter. Less than 0.1 miles. Less than 5 minutes away. Having already taken dinner out, I stubbornly prepared it on that stump instead of waiting until I could use the shelter and picnic table. I ate, packed back up, and finished the day.
A little over halfway through the 71 mile section of the AT that crosses the Smokys, I climb to the tallest point of the entire trail, Clingmans Dome. At over 6600 feet, the concrete observation tower offers 360 degrees of panoramic views over the surrounding forests. A short distance from Cherokee, NC and Gatlinburg, TN and easily accessible by highway, it's a very popular tourist destination. Every time I've tried to reach Clingmans in the past its always been raining, overcast, or foggy. This time it was perfectly clear and sunny. In fact, my entire hike through the Smokys was free of any inclement weather, a rarity for the time of year. Just the week prior hikers entering the Smokys were met with nearly 8 inches of snow and freezing temperatures. I don't think it's a stretch to say I received just about the most perfect weather one could ask for that week.
Shortly after Clingmans I headed for Newfound Gap, a major access point for non-hikers to park and walk short sections of the trail. I needed to resupply in Gatlinburg and found a lovely couple providing trail magic in the parking lot. They were staying in Gatlinburg and offered me a ride. I accepted. The husband's name was Cornbread and the wife's name was Cornbreads Wife. Cornbread was a section hiker using his off year to help his dad who was hiking the trail and to provide food and water to other thru-hikers. They offered me a road beer and drove me into Gatlinburg, dropping me off at the outfitter just on the edge of town.
My shoes had still been giving me issues so I needed to talk to someone at the outfitter, plus I thought they'd have recommendations for affordable lodging for hikers. Turns out the outfitter had the perfect person. Julie was working the shoe department and helped with my foot questions, then offered a stay in her camper for a decent rate. Julie, aka Stripper, had thru-hiked several years ago and was setting up a hostel on her and her husband's property. The camper sat next to their cabin in Cosby, TN. I got her number and told her I'd look around locally before getting back to her. I resupplied at Walgreens just down the road, stuffed my face full of pizza from Cici's, and made my way to the various hotels scattered throughout the strip. Unfortunately it was the weekend and prices were all over $120 for one night, so I contacted Stripper and agreed to stay with her.
I waited outside the Outfitter while she closed shop and she eventually pulled around in a Jeep Wrangler and ushered me in. Stripper got her name after working in a call and being the fastest person to pull bark off lumber being used to build a shelter. We drove for over 40 minutes, at which point I became a little nervous that I had hitched a ride with a complete stranger to some unknown location way out in the countryside. Usually my hitches are 10-15 minutes and I know what my destination is. Fortunately I still had service so I pinged my sister my location and texted her ""just in case"".
We arrive at Strippers house, an older log cabin she and her husband recently bought and were currently renovating. Strippers husband had been laid off from an IT job with General Motors early on in COVID and they took his severance and moved from Detroit to Cosby to love a quieter life. The property sat on 2 acres of land, partially wooded but mostly open to a rolling valley that overlooked a mountain range in the distance. I cleaned myself up in the camper and met Stripper and her husband in the open valley where they had started a fire in a fire ring. I sat with them for a few hours over some drinks, played fetch with their dog, counted how many satellites we could find in the clear night sky, and even saw some shooting stars. It was a beautiful night.
The next morning Stripper shuttled me back to Newfound Gap. On the way she told me stories about locals as we passed their homes. Where her coworkers lived and their stories, where her daughter lived, little spats and drama among neighbors, etc. We eventually came across a burned down house at the corner of an intersection. There was a motorcycle parked outside but the first story walls were still intact enough to block vision of the interior. Stripper mused that someone must be checking in on the person still residing there. She explained that a son and his mother were living in the house when it caught fire one night. The son had tried to save his mother but couldn't. He was able to escape and, stricken with guilt, continued to live in the condemned structure. Unable to support himself, he relies on the community to provide food and other necessities. I tear up but do my best to hide it.
A few miles from the trailhead, on a very curvy part of the highway that no pedestrian has any business walking the shoulder of, we see another thru-hiker hiking the narrow shoulder. There's barely any room between the opposing traffic, himself, the guardrail, and the sheer drop off the side of the mountain. Stripper pulls the Jeep off the to the side best she can and I wave the hiker over. His name is Rope and he had hiked the 15 miles from Newfound Gap into Gatlinburg on this narrow highway the day before and was now hiking the 15 miles back to continue the trail. Some of us are just built different. Rope was an older gentleman, he got his name because when he needs to do his business in the woods, he ties some rope to his waist and tethers the other side to a tree trunk. This way when he squats he doesn't lose his balance and fall over.
We arrive at the trailhead parking lot, say our thanks to Stripper, and continue north on the AT. The rest of the Smokys were wholly uneventful, as was the short section directly after the Smokys leading into Hot Springs, NC. That is until I saw my first bear.","Fontana Dam

Bed and Breakfast - Older married couple and the nicest people you'll ever meet. One carries the tent and sleeping pads, one carries the food, hence the name.
Plato and Socrates - Two entirely different people who may not even know each other, but both are philosophical and love to get into deep talks about life.
Salts - If I recall correctly, she tried to do a salt bath in a hotel, failed miserably, and ended up spending hours cleaning up the bathroom.
Birdman and Chili Pepper Woman - Mother and son duo. She likes spicy foods on trail and he documents bird calls. He carries a parabolic microphone like you see in nature documentaries to record the sounds.

In this case, Yo-Yo has sectioned hike the AT for several years, going North and South bound throughout. He successfully finished his hike this year in the Grayson Highlands!
Pacemaker - She is the presumptive leader of the the group that consists of Whistles, Jaywalking Jesus, Forrest, and Yo-Yo, and she plans out the days and everyone follows.
