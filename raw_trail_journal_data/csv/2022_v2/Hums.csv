Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646328,"Hello everyone! This is the first post of what will hopefully be a full journal of my wife and I's 2022 thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. We currently are set to leave sometime in the first week of February and have accumulated most of the gear needed for such an endeavor as hiking a 2000+ footpath. My next post will detail our reasons for going job-less for several months to painfully torture our bodies. I look forward to hiking the trail with all of you who can read along!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646329,"One question most probably stands out to every potential thru-hiker: ""Why?"" . . . . ""Why hiking? Why not working a normal job? And why 2,200 miles of painful foot-shredding torture?
There is no clear cut answer for me. Perhaps it is because hiking always produces such happy memories upon reflection (pain is often exciting in past recollection). Perhaps it is because dreams long fostered have refused to die. Perhaps because being married and 22 means my wife and I may not get a better chance to do this together. Or perhaps because there is something irresistible about the Appalachian Trail. . .
My wife (Martha) and I (Abraham) recently completed our college degrees in horticulture and business (respectively). This has led to a rather brief interval of time which we could fill by joining the working class of America in order to build our material lives together . . . or choosing rather to remain jobless and drain what little savings we have to inflict excruciating torment on our hapless bodies. We have, of course, opted for the latter. 
It is rather perplexing to note that despite a general prospective loss of funds, health, and well-being we have elected to take this 2,200 mile journey. In response to those wondering whether or not they are reading an adventure story or the ramblings of a derelict nomad contributing to a labor shortage: . . . . I can't answer that now, and don't ask later either.
In any case, I suppose my wife and I are simply following the words of John Muir: ""Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt"". 
Read my next post to find out the savings-draining, back-breaking equipment we're gonna haul around for the next several months.

Since much of my wife (Checklist) and I's gear is similar I will try to spare you from a long tedious list. But note there are several items we plan on sharing. This list also won't be everything we will be carrying. We will of course carry food, water, and other disposables.BEDROOMTent: Checklist and I will share the MSR Hubba Hubba 2 person tent, which should prove sufficiently sturdy enough for some snowy February nights.Backpack: I am starting the trail with the common choice of the Osprey Atmos 65L pack. Checklist has the women's version.Sleeping Bag: Checklist and I both have the Marmot Never Summer 0F Down Sleeping Bag.Sleeping Pad: I have the Thermarest Prolite 4 Large while Checklist has the Thermarest Regular.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646738,"Today was the day earmarked for the start of our adventure, but the Groundhog Day storm that hit the Midwest coated our local roads with a thick layer of snow and ice and made our original start date impossible.

We woke up to a beautiful sunrise in southern Indiana. We then linked up with my mother and aunt, who were willing to  shuttle us and our packs to Amicalola Falls State Park, Georgia. Roughly 9 hours later Checklist and I stood underneath the stone arch  that marks the 8.8 mile approach trail to the official start of the AT . . . Springer Mountain. So many questions passed through my head in those brief moments. ""Is this real?"" ""Can we do this?"" ""Who will we meet?"" ""Will we catch any of the hundred+ hikers who have already started?"" 
At 5:30pm all these thoughts (along with the emotions of a long sought-after goal finally coming to a seeming fruition) tumbled around in my head as we made the ascent to Amicalola State Park Lodge. Highs in the 50s made the start particularly enjoyable. The trail flirts with one of the Park's many waterfalls before finally crossing over the waterfall itself twice (once right in front of the bulk of the water, and once directly atop the waterfall). We paused to look at the fabulous view of the hills of Georgia before pressing on to get some miles in before dark. After hiking for an hour or two in the dark we deemed it wise to tent up for the night.
Mileage for the day sits at about 4 miles, temperatures are dropping, and our zero degree sleeping bags feel marshmallowy warm.

I awoke after a restless night to the sounds of Checklist outside. She was taking down the food bag (hung to keep food out of reach from bears, mice, and other pests) to make breakfast. After quickly eating several servings each of oatmeal we packed up clumsily and hit the trail around 8am. We and our gear sparkled like new toys in a department store. We were untested and unproven, and the excitement and energy we felt the night before still cushioned our every step. Our target? 4.8 miles north to the bronze plaque  marking the start of the AT and our first step onto white-blazed trail (white blazes on trees or rocks mark the official AT while blue blazes mark side trails and the approach trail).
We took it slow and hit Springer Mountain at noon for a lunch with a view. Shortly after arriving other hikers appeared from both directions. All were day or section hikers who were filled with encouragements for nervous thru-hikers like ourselves. Once, after I offered the information that Checklist and I had just graduated college a middle-aged woman beamed to her friends and exclaimed ""that is so smart! I wish I had done something like that at that age!"" This was a validation of something I had struggled with prior to the trail, and I was glad to hear our life decisions weren't crazy from a mouth other than my own.
Saying our goodbyes and finishing our tuna and Fritos, we began the descent down the north side of the mountain. For a while we cruised on lunch energy, enjoying the occasional waterfall, bridge, and labyrinth of Rhododendron bushes that turn the trail in Georgia into ""a green tunnel"". Somewhere around 3pm our energy began to fizzle out, and we decided to stick with our original goal of Hawk Mountain Shelter several miles farther along. Around 5:30pm we arrived at the shelter to see several tents scattered around the clearing along with a handful of people taking up residence in the shelter itself. After cooking our rather meager meal of one Mountain House apiece we decided to finish the day's duties so we could go to sleep with the sun. Working by flashlight I went to the bear cable next to the shelter only to see all the cables used for other people's food bags. A girl walking by politely informed me that the lines had two hooks apiece, and showed me how to work the simple pulley system. After hanging our food bags I turned to find her conversing with her male friend. Asking their names I learned that they were Sarah (no trail name yet) and Artisan, thru-hikers bound for Maine. After exchanging sentiments of the surreality of the adventure at this early stage I wished them a good nights sleep. It is doubtful we will see them again because they plan to start slow, to the tune of 5 or so miles a day. This wise strategy is unfortunately incompatible with our schedule, and should we repeat this 12.9 mile day again tomorrow we will sadly leave this amicable couple behind.

‍‍‍We start the day in similar fashion to the first one and we're on the trail by 8am. Hiking in Northern GA is proving to be a real treat. Photo-worthy views seem to be around every bend in the trail and it's hard to resist justifying each and every one as cause for a lengthy break. We stop for lunch at a rushing creek and filter water to refill our empty water bottles. The water is cold and refreshing and has a slightly different flavor than the water from the day before which came from a trickling spring. The warm sunshine feels good on our faces and we hike quickly, covering a lot of ground in a short time. I separate from Checklist at a shelter with a privy, promising to catch up to her once I've experienced the great outdoors from the eyes of a makeshift wooden box. 
I find several hikers conversing at the shelter, and upon coming back from the path to the privy find them already back on the trail headed north. Catching up to them we fall into easy conversation. They're locals, on an easy out'n'back day trip. One warns me of the black bears that frequent the trail, and after admitting that few bears venture out until March (peak hiker season) cautions me to make sure and hang food bags every night, something we're already committed to doing. ""You probably won't see any around here, but you should see some once you hit the Smokies!"" he posits as I hike away from them. I almost immediately encounter two more older gentlemen obviously just out for a stroll. ""Are you Hums?"" one asks, ""your wife passed us and said you'd be trying to catch up. ""Yes, how far is she ahead of me?"" I reply. ""Half an hour"" one jokes before the other jovially corrects him with ""more like 5 minutes"". I hike quickly, and catch up to Checklist who has found a midday rhythm. We walk at a brisk pace until we reach Ramrock Mountain, where we take a long break and enjoy the stunning view. 
Afterwards we find ourselves out of steam, and limp several more miles to Woody Gap. A dozen cars are there, and several middle-aged men are feeding a strong fire at one of several fire pits. I wait for Checklist, who is using the pit toilet, and try to look like a miserable thru-hiker who would love to be invited to what is obviously the makings of hotdogs and hamburgers. One finally notices and gruffly offers, ""come warm yourself, the fire isn't mine"". I've failed my first attempt at trail-begging, and I make a show of warming my hands before rejoining Checklist and hiking on. 
We drag our now protesting bodies up Big Cedar Mountain as the sun sets and pitch camp next to an east-facing lookout. We've hiked 13.8 miles and with any luck, we'll wake up to a sunrise tomorrow. Maybe that will make up for not getting to join the bonfire party.

We wake up extra early to the makings of a beautiful sunrise. Enjoying the wonder of God's creation slows our morning routine of making breakfast and packing up camp, and we end up leaving at our usual (so far) time of 8am. Blood Mountain looms large in our sights just 7 miles away. Sitting at approximately 4,460 ft it is our first real obstacle, and the place where many people call it quits. We decide to try and eat lunch at the summit, which means covering ground at around 2 miles an hour. Halfway there we stop to talk to ""Moses"", a section hiker who lives nearby and has been giving advice to thru-hikers for longer than we've been alive. Moses regals us with stories of thru-hikers, and gives us some insight into places coming up on the trail. 
Hiking on we start to climb in elevation; we met Moses at around 3000 ft, and have a long way to go before we can lighten our food bags by eating a pound or so of food. We make the summit just past noon, and are pleased to find that the mountain isn't much of an obstacle for us. Day hikers abound in numbers everywhere, and we lunch on one ledge of a large rock with near 360 degree views. I've been quickly discovering what I've read to be true: going down is much worse than going up. With every step down the mountain my foot jams forward uncomfortably and my ill-fated knees protest threateningly. Rock steps have been built into the steep path but in many places they seem to have been constructed with giants in mind. I am forced to either use both poles to lever myself down or scoot recklessly. I opt for the former at this early stage of the hike but am frustrated with how it slows my pace.
At the bottom of the 2 mile descent Neel Gap awaits us. For the first and only time, the trail runs right through a building. Employees and hikers are sitting at picnic tables and hail us as we walk in. One employee motions to a large tree bowing with the weight of hundreds of new pairs of shoes. ""People come down from the mountain and just throw thar shoes up thar and quit!"" he growls happily. I momentarily consider trying to climb up and grab some shoes for Checklist and myself. Hiking shoes are expensive and hikers often go through multiple pairs. I dismiss the idea, as several pairs of used shoes aren't worth a broken leg. We introduce ourselves to the group and learn that ""Moment"" is also attempting to thru-hike the trail. He is middle-aged, has a good sense of humor, and has a friend who is limited to two weeks on the trail. The hostel/outfitter under which the trail passes is heating frozen pizzas and selling them for $8 each. Despite the fact that I just had lunch, I am interested, but the pizzas take 15 minutes to warm up and we want to make 5 more miles before dark so we press on.
Moment and his friend catch us going down the next mountain and we exchange pleasantries and comments about gear Moment's friend is carrying a small guitar and warns us to stay away from whatever campsite he brings it out at next. They hike on and we follow after a short break. Several miles later our feet hurt, and we agree to stop at the next campsite. We soon come to a site with an overlook but it is occupied by two men blasting music and talking on smartphones. Disgusted and exhausted we hike on for another half mile to find a pleasant campsite with Moment and his friend cooking supper. We mosey over hoping they'll suggest we join them, and Moment seems to catch on quickly. ""There's plenty of room if you guys want to stay"" he beckons with an arm. We pitch camp and cook supper quietly. We covered 13.6 miles today. Hopefully our joints can be ready for work again tomorrow.

‍‍Checklist starts the day early by boiling water for Cream of Wheat. We pack up quickly hoping to get a headstart on the faster pair of hikers we spent the night with. As we finish our morning routine and shrug on our packs Moment wanders over and says good morning. He introduces his friend as Julie Andrews (so named because he has in the past burst into song at the sight of nature's majesty) and asks us what are plans are for the day. We inform them that we are headed for Blue Mountain Shelter so that we can resupply in Hiawassee, GA on Sunday morning. They have the same plan and we head off expecting to spend the day leapfrogging with them. 
We've gotten a slightly earlier start at around 7:30am and we pass multiple campsites with groggily awaking hikers before reaching the summit of Cowrock Mountain. Two people are on the summit and as we hike into view one exclaims ""you just missed a great sunrise!"" He's a local who introduces himself as Metro on the Move, and asks if he can interview us for his YouTube channel. We accept and say hellos to his GoPro before learning the other person, an older woman with a cheery face, is another thru-hiker named ""T"". We feel we've spent enough time on the rock and don't want Moment and Julie to catch us already so we move on. To our surprise T keeps up with our youthful pace down the mile descent of Cowrock Mountain. We chat and learn that she has already section hiked the entire AT over the course of many summers and is now ""seeing if she can do it all at once"". She tells us about the 2022 thru-hikers she's met already and shocks us by telling us of a 19 year old who is carrying a 45 lb pack (25 of which is food). T had given him the trail name of ""Moose"" both because of his heavy load and because he was headed home to Maine. She tells us that Moose is a days's hike ahead of us and I wonder if we will catch him anytime soon . . . or at all. We reach the bottom of the mountain and T informs us she is slow on the ascent and won't travel far today. We bid her adieu and I secretly hope we will meet this charming lady again as we hike on. 
We heave ourselves up yet another mountain and are left gasping for breath as Moment and Julie come by. They sympathize with our woes as they feel the struggle of such an early hill just as much as we do. The rest of our pre-lunch hike is pleasant and uneventful. The terrain is even and we hike at a quickened pace. For lunch we eat what is left of our meat sticks & tuna and tuck our nearly empty food bags back into our packs.
We walk the remaining handful of miles to Blue Mountain Shelter where we find stunning views and a handful of thru-hikers loudly talking and doing camp duties. I write an entry in the shelter logbook and then introduce myself to the hikers. Tex and Catfish are hiking together and are looking forward to the comforts of town. Tex is musing on the advisability of smoking while hiking and wonders if it slows his pace. The other two hikers have yet to receive trail names but have been dubbed ""Thing 1 & Thing 2"" by Tex until they figure it out. 
A night with them nearby doesn't promise to be a quiet one so we decide to press on to the next likely campsite. As we leave I amusedly note that Moment and Julie have set up their tents on the opposite side of the clearing from the noisy bunch. We hike another half mile before finding an ideal campsite and we gladly crawl into our sleeping bags as the temperature drops. We hiked our longest day yet of 15 miles and we excitedly plan for our first resupply on the coming day. We also plan to try our luck at hitchhiking!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646971,"‍‍It's cold when I poke my head out of my sleeping bag. . . too cold for this 6am wake-up we planned the night before. We didn't expect temperatures to drop around 10 degrees below freezing and though we stayed warm through the night the cold air won't make this early 2 mile hike down to Unicoi Gap any easier. We're out of food as well so I load my backpack with my stomach growling. We warm up as we hike down and reach the gap by 8am. We feel guilty about trying to thumb a ride when many people are at home getting ready for church. Perhaps this is why we don't have any luck with the few cars that pass by at this early hour. 
Our spirits lift when we see Julie and Moment hiking down the mountain. As they cross the road and come toward us I wonder if we can pool on a shuttle so we can get out of this weather sooner. Moment has this in mind as well and calls a local shuttle service. ""Five bucks each gets us into Hiawassee"" he announces from his phone. Five hundred measly pennies for a trip to warmth, food, and comfort? We agree to the ride and commiserate about the cold turn to the weather. A Trail Ambassador arrives and seems happy to have found another batch of thru-hikers to scare and awe with trail lore . A Trail Ambassador is someone who works for the AT Conservancy (The organization that oversees the AT)  doing various tasks like cleaning up trash, directing volunteer work, and facilitating hikers in peak season. He tells us that 30% of thru-hikers quit by Franklin, NC (just a few dozen miles farther from where we are now). He also congratulates us on being out at the right time. ""In another week or two we'll be seeing around 50 thru-hikers start each day!"" he exclaimed. 
Our shuttle arrives and we say goodbye to one trail guru only to clamber into a truck with another. ""RU"" thru-hiked in 2016 as a retirement gift and liked Hiawassee so much she sold her house in Tampa to become a shuttler for the AT. She drops us off in Hiawassee at the local grocery store, where we split ways with Moment and Julie, (who has cheerfully covered the shuttle cost) to roll carts happily through the store. Every aisle holds the promise of more food, and we quickly hit our limit in cash, weight, and volume. The store has a deli and we each buy 12 inch subs for supper. In the immediate context we want a hot breakfast so we begin walking down to a nearby Huddle House (a chain that reminds us of a Denny's back home in Indiana. We've only walked several hundred feet when a car stops in traffic and a friendly man yells ""want a lift?"". We gladly hop in and break all childhood rules of riding with strangers to save our legs two blocks. 
Huddle House is a haven with free wifi, private bathrooms, and an outlet next to our table. We plunk down backpacks and begin setting up camp for the day. A friendly waitress shows and informs us that they are serving both breakfast and lunch. We decide to cover both bases so I first order us each a breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns, biscuits & gravy, and a waffle. Then I order us each a lunch of a burger with sweet potato fries. We have no trouble downing all the food, and I post my trail journal of the last several days before calling RU for a ride back to Unicoi Gap. Our waitress comes over to our table before we leave and sympathetically asks if a life on the road is difficult. I am inwardly thrilled that I already look like a homeless bum but I assure our well meaning server that we are just hiking an extra long trail that she has somehow never heard of and don't in fact need a ride to the local homeless shelter.
We resume hiking around 1pm and forge strongly up several formidable mountains with the energy of a solid hiker meal. Daylight begins to wane around 6pm and we stop for the day. I struggle with our extra heavy bear bags and settle for a less than perfect hang. At least a bear will have to work a little to get our food.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646972,"Wind speeds are strong throughout the cold night. The creaking in the trees and the shaking of the tent is unnerving, as is the thought that every sound could be a bear taking a bite out of our food bag. Conditions don't improve as we near dusk so we pack up miserably and hurriedly start walking, I wish out loud that the day would improve from its poor beginning. I have an ambitious idea of trying to reach the GA/NC border 17 miles and several formidable mountains away. We hike in the below freezing air with all our clothes on except for sleep clothes and rain clothes. We stay warm but feel bulky and uncomfortable, anytime I try to take my puffy down jacket off I get cold and have to put it right back on.
We both struggle up to Kelly Knob and agree that it is a more grueling climb than either Blood Mountain or Tray Mountain was. We hike without seeing a soul (we feel certain Moment and Julie are behind us after our late push the evening before) until the descent to Dick's Creek Gap where we meet Nevermore who is hiking down and planning to take a zero the following day. Nevermore is a cheery middle-aged woman who goes at a slow and steady pace. We are shocked to find she is packing nearly two weeks worth of food inside her 35lb pack. Nevermore (who takes her name from the poem by Edgar Allen Poe) updates us on the various hikers ahead of us. We learn that Moose took a zero day yesterday and got back on the trail this morning at the gap we will eat lunch at. We also learn that Moose is bunched with several other young people with names like Radioactive and Em.
We say goodbye to Nevermore and get down to Dick's Creek Gap in time for lunch. I eat a large quantity of the lunch food in my pack because every ounce I eat is an ounce I no longer have to carry on my back. We finish lunch and are heading up the trail when I hear Checklist squeal in delight and break into a run. ""Trail Magic!"" she repeats as I finally see the several Tupperware containers stacked beside the trail with a note attached that identifies the food as free for the taking. The containers contain snack-sized pretzels, animal crackers, and peanut butter. We each happily take several packets of animal crackers and one of PB before munching our way up the trail. 
We hike for several more hours as conditions begin to worsen. As the sun begins to set it's clear we won't make my over-ambitious goal of leaving Georgia so we agree on a campsite two miles shy. A half hour later we walk by the campsite only to find it already occupied squarely in the center by a day-hiker who doesn't seem friendly. Frustrated, we hike frantically for over a mile on windy ridges before the trail finally dips into familiar Rhododendron tunnels and Checklist spies a hidden campsite off-trail. We pitch our tent as the night comes in a hurry and we tuck ourselves to sleep promising one another that tomorrow we'll sleep in and take it slow.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646973,"We get a late sunshiny start because after a miserable day that's what we both want.We cross the GA/NC border quickly and then take it easy and go slow for 3 miles to Muskrat Creek Shelter where we meet Russ (who has yet to get a trail name). We chat for a while and learn that we have a lot in common with this older man. He recently sold his house to live full-time in a van and travel. Thru-hiking the trail is his way of cementing his new life direction. He is thrilled to find that Checklist and I live in an off-grid tiny house and we talk about the ways other people view people who live like we do. ""People either think I'm a rockstar or they tell me I need counseling"" he exclaims as I nod in agreement. Checklist comes from the privy and I take my turn in the doorless and drafty square that feels more like a well-built deer stand than a bathroom.
There is another person in a tent at the shelter and as we put on our packs Russ says he is going to try to get her to join him. We hike for another mile before stopping for a late lunch. Checklist and I discuss the merits of various flavors of tuna which we consume inside 6 inch flour tortillas. I am trying out a spicy variety mixed with beans and corn and decide it is easily my favorite so far. Checklist finishes her meager fare first and decides to get a head start on our next climb. Five minutes after she leaves Russ comes by following a young woman named ""Summit"". They are hiking quickly so I join them for several hundred yards. I learn that Summit is a slow hiker who has attempted a thru twice but never made it past halfway. She started mid-January this time to give herself lots of time. She has the earliest hiker number we've seen this far at 49 (this means she was hiker #49 to start north from Springer Mountain in 2022). Russ is #91, and Checklist and I are hikers #123 and #124. I comment wryly on how various paces mean more interaction. I explain that a slow hiker such as Summit sees a lot of people because they all pass her. A faster hiker like myself sees a lot of people because he passes them. And a hiker in the middle like Russ sees a lot of people because he both passes and is passed. This of course does not take into account zero days and resupplies, which complicate matters further. My new friends find this introspection funny and are laughing when I leave them behind in search of Checklist. 
I find her near the top of the hill and we hike down to the gap together. We meet thru-hiker ""Picnic"" and exchange hellos. We are ready for our final push of the day up Standing Indian Mountain so we say goodbye to this friendly German girl and start climbing. We pass the mountain's shelter halfway up (where all of our new friends are planning to stay) and decide to push for the summit. It is early but we are tired by the time we reach the top. Much of the mountainside was ravaged by fires several years ago and the result is a alien-like landscape with stunning views on both sides of the ridge. We pitch camp and eat supper as we watch the sunset. This is our highest elevation yet at over 5,000ft and the view is easily the best as well. Georgia was great but what a welcome to North Carolina! One state down . . . 13 to go.

We awake after a windy night to a smothering fog that blankets the mountain. Today will be a cloudy dreary day, and I realize that the views we enjoyed last night would have been blanketed in fog had we been a day later. We hike quickly through the morning as some precipitation drifts from the sky and dampens all five of my clothing layers. Checklist comments that this dreary weather evokes two reactions from thru-hikers . . . ""stay in my sleeping bag"" or ""once I'm out I might as well put in a long day"". We are evidently of the latter sort because we hike late into the afternoon before stopping to eat (wet leaves make it easy to keep moving). We lunch at a shelter with an older man who seems to have the former response, he is in his sleeping bag and sits up to ask what the weather will be like tomorrow. We learn his name is Eric and he is (unhappily at the moment) attempting a thru-hike. After learning rain is in the forecast for tomorrow he lies back down and makes no further attempts to engage us in conversation. 
As we trudge another mile or two to look for our campsite for the night I begin fantasizing about supper. I've been doing that more recently, it's a common problem that comes about because of the fact that hikers must feed their voracious appetites with just several pounds off their back. Tonight's menu is a mouse sized portion of Turkey Chili and a side of dried apple sticks. My appetite is continually appeased with these types of small portions but is left with the type of perpetual appetite that Restaurant Buffet owners dread. Even after lunch and supper I feel as though I could eat two x-large supreme pizzas and still be ready for dessert. 
As I hang the bear bags I see a bobbing headlamp and say hello to Russ as he hiked by on his way to the next road crossing several miles further. He plans to take his first zero day tomorrow and is hiking over 20 miles to make his pickup point by tonight  I wish him well and retreat to the tent for the night. Today was a miserable day with lots of screaming leg, knee, and ankle pain. Not the ""I'm injured!"" type but the ""I hate you for abusing me like this!"" type. Hopefully Checklist and I are ready by tomorrow morning for a day of rain.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646975,"Today was one of those days. . .
We awake to the sound of a steady drizzle on the rainfly of our tent. We stay in our bags for a while hoping the day gives up and goes away. It doesn't, and the rain doesn't either so we take our tent down from the inside out. This means we remove and pack away the tent body while leaving the poles and the rainfly for last. It's about as fun as it sounds.
We hike the morning away in the foggy drizzle. There isn't much to say during times like these. A word of encouragement here and there . . . once I ask Checklist how she's doing . . . ""fine"" is the reply, ""you?"" . . . ""fine"" I answer and we trudge on. We reach a shelter and find that a previous hiker has left several Cliff Bars in the shelter log box. Checklist doesn't want them so I happily scarf both down.
We pass Winding Stair Gap several miles later where Russ got picked up for his zero last night. Where the trail meets the road I see a plastic trash bag. Nudging it I see two brown bananas, several cheap beers, and a diet coke. I test a banana and find that the inside is still good. The bananas go the way of the Cliff Bars and I eye the diet coke before deciding it isn't worth drinking. I rejoin Checklist who has a look of distaste on her face. ""That's gross"" she exclaims; ""best bananas I ever ate"" I grin in reply. We hike on and cover more miles on this wet day. Things of true importance (like our down sleeping bags) are stored inside a large liner bag inside the large compartment of our backpacks. Everything else, however, is soon soaked by the steady windy rain. We stumble past a road at around 4:30pm with about 2 miles to go to our planned campsite. We contemplate bailing to the safety of Franklin, NC but decide we must stick it out. Next week will be filled with rain and if we can't handle one measly rainstorm then what are doing out here in the first place?!
We stumble into a campsite someone idiotically decided to place in the midst of an oak tree grove. The ground is covered with sharp acorns and we search for an ideal spot in vain. Finally we settle on one and pitch our tent, starting this time in reverse with the poles and rainfly going up first. We cook supper and make hot chocolate as the rain picks up and do our best to get our stuff into ideal dry places.
As I said, ""today was one of those days"". One of those days where you wish you were anywhere else. One of those days where you long for the comfort of the familiar. One of those days that perhaps finds its merits in making us grateful for everything God has given us. Grateful for pizza, warm houses, hot showers, and even sunny days not filled with rain. . .maybe we'll get one of those days tomorrow.

This morning we awake to find that temperatures dipped below freezing in the night after the heavy rain and everything is therefore coated in ice. My bag is damp and I'm only warm if I stay completely inside it. We wile several morning hours away, glumly peering through our sleeping bag peepholes at the ice-covered rainfly. Checklist is the first to take the plunge to the outside world and I follow her shivering. We gulp down instant oatmeal packets with cold water (heating water would be too much of a bother on a day like today). We then attempt to stuff icy gear where it will do the least damage, and I tie our frozen rainfly to the back of my backpack as we head out.
The late morning is cold but the sun slowly triumphs over the clouds of the night and we begin to thaw inside and out. We reach Wayah Bald where a stone observation tower stands. Like others we've seen it is a remnant from past days where men spent months at a time with nothing but a woodstove, fridge, and telephone as they watched for signs of distant fires. We enjoy views all day long now that the fog of yesterday has passed. The tops of the trees are icy and the change in temperature causes icicles to fall from high branches and shatter into fragments on lower ones. We hear a constant tinkle-tinkle-plunk as we hike, and the ground is covered with pieces of melting ice ranging from the size of toothpicks to that of tootsie rolls. Whenever we are rewarded with views we see icy treetops scattered across the landscape wherever the sun has not touched.
We push late to make up for our late start and meet several day-hikers descending as we head up Wesser Bald, our last hill of the day. One is a trail worker who greets us kindly as he saws branches from a tree that has fallen across the trail. ""You're ahead of the bubble"" he comments, ""only about 30-some hikers ahead of you"". This is good news, and it also gives me reason to think we deserve a break with hot showers, laundered clothes, and an AYCE buffet sometime soon. As we pitch camp we discuss our options for the next few days. Tonight temps will fall well below freezing so I follow standard hiker protocol and stuff everything cold-sensitive in the footbox of my sleeping bag so it will stay warm. Tomorrow morning we will reach the Nantahala Outdoor Center where we hope good things await us.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647037,"We wake up to an icy cold morning once again. Our water bottles are all in various states of frozen and my sleeping bag is frosted to the bottom of the tent where I've slipped down on my pad on the uneven ground. We pack up camp feeling abused and mistreated by the past few days. The NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) is just over 6 miles away so we start hiking at 8am hoping for the best despite the chill. Once we get moving I begin to play a game I call ""puffy indecision"". On cold mornings like these my down puffy jacket is the warmest thing I can put on, but it isn't breathable like my synthetic layers. This means I sweat and get hot when wearing it while hiking, but if I take it off I quickly get cold and want to put it back on. This morning I decide to keep it on and just take breaks to keep from overheating.
As we descend from Wesser Bald we are once again treated to unbelievable views. A picture isn't able to do the scenery justice because the views are often almost 360 degrees. At one point we reach a lookout aptly named ""The Jumpoff"" which is a steep descent atop bare cliffs that requires careful four-point maneuvering. It is difficult to believe in spots like this that 80+ year olds, children in diapers, and even blind Bill Irwin and his guide dog (The Orient Express) have hiked this entire trail. 
The views may be wonderful but the 6 mile descent is one of the worst yet, and I battle depressing thoughts all morning. We discuss the best potential way to rest for the day without spending more than seems necessary and can't settle on anything in particular. We finally arrive at the NOC around 11am and are greeted by an attractive menagerie of buildings along a playful river. A busy country highway runs abreast to the Nantahala River and my extroverted self can feel the energy steaming from the bustle of people in the area.
Our first stop is the General Store, a precursory glance is enough to tell us the several short aisles of candy bars and chips won't do for our desired three day resupply so we head to the Outfitter across the road. I survey their small stock of Mountain House Meals and am wondering how we are going to get 9 meals and still stay in budget when Checklist makes an awesome find. The store has a hiker box that is overflowing with gear and trail food! A hiker box is a makeshift chest usually made of scrap wood often found  outside grocery stores and outfitters in trail towns. The boxes typically read: ""take what you need, leave what you don't"" (we have already raided a hiker box back in Hiawassee GA where Checklist found two half full fuel canisters). 
This box contains a variety of items, and we  stock up on oatmeal packets for breakfasts; tuna packets, PB, and tortillas for lunches; and ramen for suppers. We add two of the biscuit & gravy Mountain Houses (which we've heard are fantastic) and we have a deliciously cheap resupply. We head downstairs and replace Checklist's disintegrating shoes (she started with a used pair) with a discounted pair of last year's Altra Lone Peaks. We head back over to the General Store and enquire about lodging, laundry, and showers. We find the lodging too pricey but we opt for the pay-per-use showers and laundry. As we are rung up the man behind us introduces himself as ""French Press"". He thru-hiked in 2021 and wants to buy us something from the store as trail magic. I happily select two large cookies from the overpriced shelves and he just as happily pays for them and our showers. 
We walk to the showerhouse and emerge an hour later feeling like the world is a brighter place. We dress in our cleanest remaining clothes and I update trail journals while we wait for laundry. Wearing fresh warm clothes, we head over to the River's End Restaurant where we satisfy my recent cravings with two large pizzas. We manage to stuff down a pizza each before we contentedly waddle half a mile up the side of the mountain to pitch camp for the night. 
The climbs ahead are horrendous. . .rain is in the forecast for next week. . .but we will sleep soundly tonight with our faith restored in all that is good and blessed.

Early stages of sunlight peering through the trees rouses me from a nightlong pizza coma. Checklist is boiling water for breakfast, which consists of several instant oatmeal packets each and instant coffee (for her). We break camp around 8am and continue the 6 mile climb we began the night before. It isn't terrible but it is taxing and we're both tired by the time we reach Sassafras Gap Shelter, which is located just below the second summit (Cheoah Bald). Several hikers are congregating there and we recognize one as ""Bruce"", a hiker we met at the NOC who started from Amicalola but isn't sure he wants to call himself a thru-hiker yet. The other hiker is a middle-aged man who has a free-spirited gleam in his eye. We learn his name is ""Tao"" (pronounced Dow) and he is a thru-hiker going south (SOBO). Tao started his thru-hike in July of 2021 and is taking his time in order to savor every moment. As he tells us of his snowy slog through the Smokies several weeks ago several hikers come from behind us on the trail. They know Bruce and greet him before announcing they are going to break for lunch at the shelter (which is several hundred feet off trail). After proudly displaying his well-earned scraggly thru-hiker beard and  hair Tao wishes us luck and heads south. He has just under 150 miles to go before he can hang up his hiker shoes. Bruce has already disappeared to the north, having declared his intentions to crush some miles today.
Checklist and I planned to eat lunch atop Cheoah Bald so Checklist gets a head start on the mile climb while I head over to the shelter privy to answer nature's call. On the way I stop in at the shelter to say hello and to sign the shelter log. The two older men introduce themselves as ""Radioactive"" and ""Sparky"". Both men are freshly retired and met at Amicalola, they seem to be kindred spirits and are now well-established hiking buddies. Each of the two have worked over 30 years in their industry (Radioactive-Nuclear, Sparky-Electrician) and are having no qualms about enjoying all the luxuries a thru-hike can offer. They are planning to take a double zero at the Fontana Lodge in order to avoid the rain going into the Smokies. I hike up Cheoah Bald (knowing they will follow when they finish lunch) and catch Checklist nearly at the top. We emerge victorious on a grassy bald overlook with a fire ring that reminds me of the Standing Indian summit. We enjoy lunch slowly and Radioactive and Sparky hike into view 15 minutes later. Sparky is gasping and declares the climb his hardest ever as he sinks to the ground in what would seem to be a forever resting place. Radioactive is enthused by the exertion and takes videos and pictures to post to his Facebook. We exchange comments about the NOC and the trail so far before bidding them well and pushing on.
Several miles later we decide to end our day and we stop at Stecoah Gap where we find a campsite next to a spring down a blue-blazed trail. We make big pots of ramen and set up camp as the air grows chilly. Checklist's feet have a lingering pain that is bothersome so we discuss our options as we crawl into our sleeping bags. We decide we had best go with the most cautious route so we call a shuttle for tomorrow morning. We plan to take tomorrow off and see some outfitters in Franklin who hopefully can advise us on the best way to proceed without further agitation to Checklist's feet.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647039,"Today starts slow with the cold air receding as the sun warms the hillside. We've spent the night next to a trickling spring and we awake to the sound of a stream of water flowing from a length of pipe onto the ground. The pipe is placed into the spring and funnels water out to where it can be used to fill our Katadyn BeFree water filters (a pipe is a usual sight at many of the springs we encounter).
We stare at the roof of our tent and wait for our 9am shuttle to Franklin. Checklist has been having lingering foot pain and we want to make sure we are doing all the right things before hiking any further. Our shuttle arrives in the form of a thick mountain accent named Fred Laney. Fred tells us of his affinity for the mountains he was born and raised in as we make the trip south. He drops us off at an outfitter named ""Outdoor 76"" promising to be back for us shortly.
The outfitter is abuzz with activity, and is a charming and spacious place to be after the solitary confinement of a tent. We say hi to our previous thru-hiker acquaintance T, who looks like she is riding high on the bliss of a zero day. We meet Cory, who is one of the pedorthic specialists in the outfitter with years of experience and thousands of ailing thru-hikers in his past. He devotes over an hour of his time explaining the many things new thru-hikers miss. We are offered free donuts as a courtesy and are made great listeners by the presence of so many calories in so few bites. Cory suspects that Checklist is dealing with an overuse problem from our frantic pace over the past two weeks. He also criticizes her latest shoe change as going from bad to worse and suggests a shoe with more support to help with her transition to what is essentially a pro-athlete lifestyle. ""People often have a deadline"", he then educates us, ""but they fail to realize that the  best way to make that deadline is to start extra slow. High mileage will come naturally later, you guys just need to plan to slow down. No more than 8 miles a day for a while!"" 
We take Cory's advice on both fronts and switch shoes before leaving the store. Outdoor 76 happily offers to take care of returning the first new pair of shoes for us (even though we bought the shoes from a different outfitter). Digesting a new wealth of information on foot care and hiking wisdom we hop back in our shuttle and head back to Stecoah Gap, stopping at Hardee's to add a burger and fries to the donuts already bouncing around in our bellies. Fred has hunted the black bears of these mountains for years and reassures us that the bears aren't out yet, and the only way to get attacked if they were out would be to do something stupid like leave a half-eaten candy bar in a pocket at night. ""In forty years I've only heard of two people getting hurt and it ain't never been the bears fault!""
We arrive back at Stecoah Gap at around noon and hike slowly for several hours before rain clouds begin to roll in. We settle on the first good tent site we come too and I'm hanging our (waterproof) food bags after supper when the first drops hit. We lie in our tent under the sprinkling rain and talk about the future as the darkness invades. It is often said that thru-hikers either hike the AT and stop, or they go on to thru-hike many other long trails such as the PCT and CDT. Checklist and I feel inclined at the present moment to the former kind of experience. This hike has already helped us realize that our priorities for the future need to change. Our families should be valued over our fortunes. Simple pleasures and comforts of life should be valued over our ambitions of travel and adventure. We realize that we are as happy living in the Midwest where we were raised as Fred is in his mountain paradise.
Getting these priorities settled in our heads is one of the reasons we've chosen to do this thru-hike and I am glad for our fruitful conversation about the thoughts we've individually had over the past two weeks. Every past thru-hiker we've met has told us of how the AT changes lives. It would seem as though it is working its magic in our lives already.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647040,"Rain has fallen somewhat steadily throughout the night and is spritzing our tent lightly when dawn arrives. For the first time we are in no hurry. We are under expert orders to proceed slowly at least until we're through the Smokies so there is no need to break camp early. We lie in our warm bags and enjoy being protected from the morning rain. Around 9:30am the rain stops and we take a hint and pack up. The day is cloudy but has several moments of sunshine, and though the ground is damp we hike in high spirits with the temperatures quickly rising into the 60s. Throughout our hike thus far we've hiked often through what is known as ""the green tunnel"", which is masses of Rhododendron that grow over the trail. We enjoy hiking through these tunnels and emerging at a summit or a creek. Whenever the sunlight plays among the many trunks of these Rhododendron tunnels I always think of a whimsical world of fairies dancing unseen as we walk nearby.
We stop for lunch at Cable Gap Shelter, which is one of the few original CCC-built shelters we've seen (CCC stands for Civilian Conservation Corps; an FDR creation that provided thousands of young men with outdoor work projects that still stand today as relics of the past). The shelter is the smallest we've seen but it suits our lunch needs nicely. We try cooking ramen, beef stroganoff, and ginger soy tuna together and end up with an interesting concoction that we don't plan to try and replicate anytime soon.
After lunch we hike several more easy miles. There is a stiff wind and dark clouds threaten us with rain but their show of force doesn't begin to precipitate until well after we are safely inside our tent. We have the Mountain House ""Biscuits and Gravy"" meal for supper and find it scrumptious. We look forward to trying more of the MH meals on the AT and discuss what options should be next. Chicken Teriyaki seems to be a favorite on the trail and I put in my vote for that.
It is still daylight when we finish supper and we are surprised to hear a voice hailing our tent from the trail. I unzip the rainfly to the smiling face of ""Quadzilla"". It's easy to see where Quadzilla got his name, his legs look like they jumped out of the pages of a comic book. I learn he is a thru-hiker and ask when he started. ""I was at Springer on Wednesday . . . so this is day 7"" he replies. We are both astounded and some quick numbers in my head tell me that Quadzilla is averaging around 24 miles a day and has probably put in several 30s as well. He waves goodbye amiably and is out of sight as quickly as he had appeared. Quadzilla is headed for Fontana Dam just 3 miles away where we plan to resupply tomorrow. 
The only way we'll see him again, I think as I hang our nearly empty food bags, is if he takes like ten zeroes in a row sometime soon!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647130,"(the view from the Hilton)It rains heavily throughout the night. In the morning it is still drizzling and we have only 3.5 miles planned for the day so we stay in our tent until late in the morning. Fat raindrops fall sporadically as we walk to the Fontana Hilton; a famed AT shelter with showers, picnic tables, and a charging station. We've heard from the trail grapevine that the Fontana Dam Visitor Center (about a third of a mile farther on) has nicer showers than the shelter so we hike the extra distance and are not disappointed. 
After quick refreshing showers we take a shuttle to the Fontana Lodge about a mile away. The lodge is a popular zero day location for thru-hikers and we find Radioactive and Sparky lounging on couches when we walk in. First order of business is to check the hiker box, which supplies us with a dozen or so goodies. I espy a full jar of peanut butter and though hikers are often ridiculed for such items I can't resist adding it to my food bag. It will come in handy to help stave off my hiker hunger through the Smokies. We complete our resupply with the lodge's food shop and head to the attached restaurant for lunch/supper.
It is around 2pm when we enter the Mountainview Bistro and we have the place to ourselves. We order a large chicken tender house salad to share and a 1/2 pound burger each. Prices are reasonable and the portions are great. The burgers are topped with all the fixings plus fried onion rings and thick slabs of bacon. The food is fantastic, and I remark that this is the first restaurant we've eaten at which I would return to in the future. The meal is so good we decide to finish with dessert, and we both order cheesecake. 
Afterwards we slouch in the lounge and chat with Radioactive and Sparky. I post to trail journals and we plan our next resupply in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Several more thru-hikers saunter in and book rooms for several days (with obvious intentions to take a zero day tomorrow). We meet ""Trimpi"", ""Old Goat"", and ""Deluxe"". I tease Deluxe about his neon orange pack and sympathize with Old Goat's joint pains. The lodge is pleasant and we stay until the last shuttle leaves at 5pm. 
Back at the Fontana Hilton we chat with section hiker ""Nap"" who is finishing his section hike here at Fontana Dam. He started from Amicalola and has already section hiked much of the northern part of the trail so he offers advice on New Hampshire and Maine as we wait for our electronics to charge. The view from the shelter is beautiful and we enjoy a peaceful sunset before retiring to the safety of our tent for the night.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647131,"Today we begin our foray through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP)! We start our day by walking back down to the visitor center where we took showers yesterday. This time we keep going and cross the dam itself. The dam is the largest and highest in elevation in the eastern US. The morning is reasonably clear and we enjoy Fontana Lake against the backdrop of the Smoky Mountains.
From the dam we can see a fire tower atop Shuckstack Mountain five miles away. We begin hiking that way hoping to get to the fire tower before clouds roll in to obstruct the view. We meet Nap hiking back toward us and as we meet he explains that he wanted to end his section hike by touching the GSMNP entrance sign. Several hundred yards ahead we pass said sign and I congratulate myself mentally for making it this far. This will be our second trip to the Smokies but our first attempt to follow the AT's path through them. 
As we hike on the paved road that is the entrance to the park a vehicle passes us and parks at the parking lot next to the spot where the AT veers off into the woods. Several hikers tumble out and as we come up we can see that they are day-hikers. We let them pass as we drop half of our thru-hiker passes in the entry box (the other half will go in a similar box on the northern boundary to the park). We hike for several miles before fog enshrouds us. The climate quickly changes from pleasant to gloomy and the sky begins to sprinkle rain. We catch up to several of the day-hikers who seem to be struggling and regretting their choice of activity; they aren't friendly so we let them go ahead once more. 
We eventually reach the top of our day's climb where a 0.1 mile side trail leads to the fire tower. We hear the day-hikers voices coming from that direction and we decide their demeanor coupled with the viewless fog makes the extra steps not worth our while. We hike another mile to our campsite where we find a spring overflowing from the recent rain. Terracing work has been done on the hillside to make individual tent sites and bear cables hang nearby. It is early in the afternoon but GSMNP rules state that hikers must camp in designated areas and the next shelter is over five miles away. Content with a short day we pitch our tent on a likely site and eat lunch and dinner as one meal. Afterwards Checklist soaks her feet in the cold spring while I snack on my jar of peanut butter. We managed to secure a large bag of chocolate pieces from the hiker box at Fontana and I alternate between scooping the peanut butter out with chunks of chocolate and using a spoon to shovel large dollups in more directly. I have to stop myself from unthinkingly consuming the entire jar and I sadly put it back in my food bag half empty. ""Oh well"", I rationalize to Checklist as she returns, ""at least I'm lightening my load!"" 
We take turns massaging each other's aches and pains and then spend some recreational time perusing the upcoming pages of our respective guidebooks. The day turns to night and I hang our food bags using the convenient cable system before zipping up my rainfly for the last time.

One huge benefit to these lower mileage days is the increased flexibility we have with the weather. We can stay in our tent all morning if we want, and on this rainy day that's exactly what we do. I woke up in the night with a stomach protesting the large quantity of peanut  butter consumed the day before but now it is rumbling with hunger again. I feed it two oatmeal packets and a tuna-filled tortilla before I once again open the peanut butter jar.
While waiting for the rain to pass Checklist and I get sleepy and drift into a mid-morning nap. We rouse ourselves just before noon to find that the rain has stopped and the sun is making an attempt to brighten our day. As soon as we begin hiking however, the ""Smoky"" part of the mountains we're hiking through rears its ugly head to do battle with the sun. We walk through the conflict of mist, rain, and sun for the rest of our short day. By the time we reach Russell Field Shelter the sun has given up and we are damp and cold. The shelter is large, well-built, and has an integrated fireplace, and we briefly consider sleeping inside before reminding ourselves we don't want to deal with the hordes of mice which infest all AT shelters. 
We set up camp nearby and are enjoying hot meals of chicken and rice in our tent when we hear voices at the shelter. After I hang our food bags I walk over and greet the newcomers. I meet Josh, who is sporting a red beard and using a huge knife to split kindling. The other young man has to remind me of our first meeting back on Blue Mountain when he was travelling with Tex, Catfish, and Hudson. He was ""Nick"" then but now has got a trail name of ""South Park"". He is surprised to have caught us so I tell him of our plans to go slow through the Smokies. It is ironic and educational to learn that South Park averaged under 8 miles a day up to Blue Mountain but has since found his trail legs and caught up to us. Without meaning to he settled into a much better regime than us simply by listening to his body.
We cinch our bags tight as the cold seeps into our tent. I'm unsure if Josh ever got his fire started but I wouldn't leave the warmth of my cocoon even if he had a ten-foot bonfire. Despite my nap earlier I have no doubt sleep will come quickly tonight.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647133,"(Rocky Top)I'm realizing that thru-hikers can generally be split into two broad categories: older hikers who have money and don't mind spending it, and younger hikers who may or may not have money but care about how they spend what they have. Checklist and I fall into the latter category. We have planned and budgeted for this trip but we are young (or old) enough to realize that every dollar not spent is a dollar we can save for the future. As such we feel no shame in joining our fellow frugal hikers in raiding hiker boxes, taking Neros instead of Zeros (a Nero is often cheaper because it typically means spending part of a day in town without paying for overnight lodging), and glaring down expensively priced premium hiker foods.
This morning I find that South Park and Josh are also frugal hikers. I discuss food with them as we prepare to head out and find that they are eating the same things we are. Instant oatmeal for breakfast, tuna tortillas for lunch, and ramen for supper. Peanut butter, protein bars, and other snacks round out the sum total of what we are feeding our bodies. We begin hiking at around 8am knowing South Park and Josh will catch us at some point since they both are aiming at a shelter 15 miles away.
Morning miles always seem to go by quicker than afternoon ones and we fly through several miles en route to lunch atop Rocky Top Mountain. We see half a dozen grassy balds that are a source of much speculation. Some think that Native Americans cleared the areas for ceremonial reasons, others that pioneers did the same for farming or grazing purposes. In any case I am thankful for the views they provide and can only imagine how beautiful the spots will be later this spring when the grass is green.
Josh overtakes us around noon but we leapfrog several times before we reach Derrick Knob Shelter, which is where we are stopping for the night. We have managed to beat the rain and Josh seems to envy us our relaxed pace because he lingers for a while talking about the outrageous prices dehydrated meals go for. Finally he dons his rain gear and sets out bravely into the now drizzling afternoon. We watch him go and discuss spending the night in the shelter. South Park arrives and looks miserable enough to call it a day. Checklist isn't inclined to spend the night alone in the shelter with him so she pointedly begins getting out her portion of our tent (the poles). I remind myself of the damage a shelter rat can do to a sleeping bag and help her set up camp in the trickle. South Park leaves shortly thereafter but other hikers begin to arrive so we are glad we have our own space. Radioactive and Sparky are the first to arrive, followed by several other thru-hikers we haven't met yet: ""SOS"", ""Hammer"", and ""Louse"". Louse and SOS have both come all 24 miles from Fontana today. Louse is attempting a 2022 triple crown, which is a thru-hike of the AT, PCT, and CDT, all in the same calendar year (incidentally, this is the same feat that Quadzilla is attempting, last we heard he was already done with the Smokies!).
With so many different paces we are bound to find ourselves somewhere in the middle. Whenever my competitive juices start flowing it always helps to remember that we are all out here for different reasons , and in the end we all have the same goal (regardless of how we each can accomplish that goal) . . .get to Katahdin!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647134,"Last night was rainy and restless. I awake with a crook in my neck from sleeping in a poor position. Out here some nights are great and some aren't, and that's just a fact of life. Today is Sunday, a wonderful day of rest and renewal. It rains stoutly throughout the morning but we are unperturbed. One by one the hikers in the shelter put on rain gear and head out. Radioactive and Sparky are the last to go, and once they disappear down the trail I turn on our downloaded sermon for this week. It is a week old sermon from our home church of the BRPC but to us it is comforting to hear a familiar voice on a familiar day. The sermon is on the back half of 1 Corinthians 14 and the principle to be learned is the value of worshipping together in an orderly and edifying manner. This hits home in a unique way. Our faith means just as much to us on the trail as off it but despite our best efforts to memorize scripture and read God's Word daily, Sunday (and the rest of the week) just isn't the same without being able to worship in the same building with a body of believers.
We are pleasantly surprised when the rain (mostly) stops after we finish the sermon and we pack up and begin walking in a still somewhat dry state of affairs. Several miles  in someone has arranged sticks to read: ""2000"". This stands for the 2000 miles we have left, and though that number is daunting, it is nice to be reminded that we have already knocked off over two hundred miles (counting the approach trail). Today has several climbs but for the most part we hike easily and briskly. Our slowed schedule has happily had its desired effect and Checklist has had none of her lingering foot pain recently. By 3:30pm we arrive at Double Spring Gap Shelter and begin completing camp chores in the midst of a spruce thicket. ""Get water"" is usually first, along with ""setup tent"". These are typically followed by ""blow up pad"", ""pull out sleeping bag"", and ""make dinner"". We are nearly out of food (the 18oz jar of peanut butter was cut in half and licked clean yesterday) and have only instant mashed potatoes, two tuna pouches, and a pair of instant oatmeal packets remaining. We easily consume all we have left and I hang our food bags on a frozen  bear cable hoping that Newfound Gap will be open tomorrow so we can get to Gatlinburg for a resupply and a night in a hotel. 
I stop by the shelter on the way back to the tent and make small talk with the hikers bedding down for the night. We met ""Twain"" as we cooked supper earlier, and he and I now talk about the miles ahead as the amiable thru-hiker tries his best to stay warm. There are half a dozen high-spirited college students from Michigan University shivering in sleeping bags  who seem to be bemoaning the poor weather which has coincided with their spring break trip. I note the motley assortment of rainflies, ponchos, and tarps they have hung to block the wind and sincerely wish them a warm nights sleep. I am thankful Checklist and I had the foresight to buy sleeping bags with opposite zippers so we can zip our bags together and stay warmer on nights like these. 
Tomorrow we are planning to be hiking at the break of dawn. Temperatures may be in the teens in the morning, Clingman's Dome may loom large in our sights, but all I see is a warm bed with clean sheets waiting for me in Gatlinburg.

Today is a fresh early start that smells of evergreen needles and cold air. We are stuffing gear in packs by 6:45am and are on the trail by 7am. It is a brisk morning in the high teens and we wear everything to keep warm until we can get moving and the sun can make its full appearance. At the shelter we stop to see who survived the night. Several hardier college students are packing up and Twain is buckling his straps and standing outside obviously about to make a start. ""Did you stay warm Twain?"" I ask, and he replies  ""not really"" in a tone marked with humor. The three of us walk together for a quarter mile or so, at which point Twain sees our youthful morning energy and tells us to not slow up for him. We hike for a while as the sun rises, discussing with eager anticipation the hotel and food awaiting us at Newfound Gap. Several miles into the trek we begin to slow (our bodies beginning to realize our plan to fast until dinner) and Twain catches us trudging up Mt Buckley en route to Clingman's Dome. We let him pass but reunite shortly thereafter at the top. Clingman's Dome is a manmade structure that allows for unobstructed 360 degree views at the highest point on the AT (6,643). It is spectacular and we stop to stare with mouths agape at the fantastic views. Maps on all four sides help us spot the peaks we have climbed and the peaks we have yet to climb. We can see cars on the road from Newfound Gap just over 7 miles away and are motivated to start hiking quickly again. 
By 1:30pm we have rolled into the Gap and are standing with thumbs outstretched hoping a kind soul will drive us the 15 miles to Gatlinburg. A friendly couple about our age pull over 10 minutes later in a truck with a DIY camper box built on the back and ask if we want a ride. Their situation reminds me of us two years ago when we visited the Smokies on our first anniversary and saw several thru-hikers in a shelter. I remember wondering if we would ever thru-hike the AT . . . and now here we are.
In Gatlinburg we have time before our Hotel opens so we hop on a trolley to resupply at a grocery store. We learn along the way that the trolley system is inefficient, slow, and takes about an hour to get any place in particular. We eventually stumble into Food City, where we saunter through aisles of food and fill two grocery carts - one with food for the next 4 days, and one with food for tonight at the hotel. For supper we buy:-2 sweet potatoes (to microwave)-1 onion-1 green pepper-1 bag of dry coleslaw mix-1 head of broccoli-2 heads of lettuce-1 large tomato-1 avocado-1 bag of baby carrots-1 lb of hot chicken tenders-1 bottle of ranch-1 large party tray of assorted fruit-1/2 gallon of chocolate milk-and a 6 inch cheesecake
We take the one-hour trolley to our hotel several miles away and check-in with bags of groceries in-hand. We settle in comfortably by dropping stuff all around the room. Salad items get chopped with a pocketknife while clothes go in a sink to soak with baking soda and vinegar. Water filters get a prolonged dunking in distilled water (to clean out minerals) while electronics charge. We sit down to a massive supper and down as much greens and fruits as we can before flopping on the wonderfully large king bed. The room has a whirlpool and we enjoy a nice soak to relieve aching muscles. As the evening winds down I call family, post my last batch of trail journals, and finish off the fruit tray, cheesecake, and chocolate milk. We have some salad stuff left but we only have a 3 mile day in the works for tomorrow so we will haul what we can't eat tonight out for supper tomorrow. Tomorrow's breakfast is an AYCE affair that includes a waffle iron, and I plan to balance tonight's veggies with plenty of sweet carbs.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647235,"(Icewater Spring Shelter)For the first time on this crazy journey I awake to the feeling of a real pillow under my head. The cheap hotel comforter feels luxurious and it seems nearly magical to press a button to make the room several degrees warmer. Breakfast is being served from 6-9am and we want to completely fill every corner of our stomachs so we go down at 6:30 and at 8:30. The hotel is somehow out of egg mixture (and apparently you can't just make scrambled eggs from the oblong white things anymore) so we don't have any options for a solid protein. I compensate with extra carbs and manage to tuck away 3 make-your-own waffles, 4 biscuits with gravy, a dozen mini muffins, a bowl of cereal, and about a half gallon of orange juice. Back in the room we savor the hours till checkout and enjoy the bed and whirlpool right up to the wire. Then we cram our massive resupply into our backpacks along with a large ziplock full of leftover salad and say goodbye to creature comforts once again.
Our packs feel heavy as we walk up the parkway to a good hitch-point so we stop into a large outfitter store to weigh our bags. Surprisingly, they both weigh only around 33 lbs (and several lbs will be eaten within the day) which is considered a great fully loaded trail weight. We feel good about the large amount of food we've bought at low prices and I am hopeful the coming days will  be free from any real hunger pains. We talk with a store worker named Julie who thru-hiked the trail in 2016 and has also section hiked it enough to become a guru in trail knowledge. We are finding out that in the long bubble of towns surrounding the AT nearly every local we meet has some connection or another to the trail.
We get an easy hitch back to a tourist-filled Newfound Gap from a kind soul before hitting the now familiar terrain of the trail once more. I am stopped where the trail leaves the Gap by an older gentleman who eyes my pack and asks where I'm headed. ""All the way to Katahdin Maine"" I reply nonchalantly as I watch Checklist disappear up the trail. ""How long will that take you?"" he asks incredulously and I reply ""could be until mid-June"". As I head up the trail I hear another tourist say, ""the girl said they were goin' to Maine but I thought she was joking!""
We hike the several miles to Icewater Spring Shelter without much effort and arrive with energy left to spare. We meet a thru-hiking couple about our age named Christian & Perrin (no trail names yet). Several spring break college students have taken over the shelter so we thru hikers set our tents up nextdoor. Several deer are feeding happily in the area and show no sign of fear at the sight of humans 20 feet away. This surprises us until we realize that out here people hunt bear, so these deer enjoy life without the fear of humans that our Hoosier deer live (or die) by come deer season.
We chat awhile with Christian and Perrin, who remark on the amazing weather we've been having (today is sunny and 65) and relate to our struggles with food. Christian has a Jiff jar of peanut butter and slathers large spoonfuls onto a tortilla as he winds down for the day. Everyone retires to the warmth of sleeping bags as the sun goes down, and we finish off a delectable salad with the expectation that tomorrow will be fueled by our healthy bag of greens.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647236,"(Charlie's Bunion)In the early days of our hike we were usually the first to break camp. This helped us get more miles in by extending the morning period in which miles seem to go by much quicker than in the afternoon. As a result of this earlier ritual it still feels strange to now wake up late and see everyone else is already up and gone. It does make our morning more relaxing and peaceful though, and by the time we roll out at 8am we feel rested and ready to enjoy the outdoors!
A mile in we hit Charlie's Bunion, a magnificent out-jutting of rock that provides great views and a bit of knee-shaking at the sheer height. We've been here once before but it is just as awesome the second time around. We move on to unexplored territory and find more lookout points at Eagle Rocks and Bradley's View. The latter is a rectangular rock roughly 12×5ft in diameter that sits above an azalea hedge and watches over the valleys and mountains below. The rock is sunny when we reach it around noon and we stop for a long lunch. I've forsaken the tuna tortillas in favor of heavier bagel meat & cheese sandwiches. They are a huge improvement and I decide the weight penalty is worth the payoff of a full belly. Checklist has managed to keep a whole avocado intact and enjoys it in addition to her Fritos and spicy tuna mix. 
After a post-lunch sunbathing session we feel rejuvenated and we make good time to the shelter just over a mile away. We meet Joan resting at the fork to the shelter, an older woman who has section-hiked all of the 900 miles of trails in the Smokies twice and is now attempting to hike them a third time from the opposite directions. We are amazed by how much our fellow Hoosier has been able to accomplish in the 18 years since she moved to Tennessee. It is 1:30pm and our bodies haven't given up yet so we decide to slowly work our way to the next shelter 5 miles ahead before we call it a day. We make it with none of the bad foot pain from our past and we celebrate by making a delicious meal. We've packed in mac'n'cheese, lunch meat, butter, and a 2 lb bag of tater tots. Checklist fries half the (mushed) tater tots in butter while I boil the mac'n'cheese; then we combine the two and sprinkle in lunch meat morsels to make a smorgasbord of a meal that leaves us both satiated and sleepy.  I don't want to leave the warmth of my sleeping bag to wash our dishes in the icy cold spring but Checklist reminds me giddily that she is supposed to stay off her feet as much as possible while at camp so I endure the misery for the sake of my wife's feet's future. She is going to attempt the near impossible feat of hot pancakes and sausages for me tomorrow morning so I suppose I shouldn't engage in too much self-pity.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647237,"The morning air is crisp and the rising sun wakes me to the intermingled smells of pancakes and spruce trees. Checklist is managing the arduous task of frying pancakes in my 4-inch pot lid (which doubles as a makeshift frying pan) by using copious amounts of butter. The pre-cooked sausage links are much easier and although the meal is superb we decide the sausages have a higher chance of making it into our future gourmet meals. We make a slow start to our morning and the college students who are matching our pace (and who stayed in the shelter last night) leave long before we do. 
When we do begin hiking we find the trails soft, graded, and gradual. The flora & fauna is interesting and we walk through mossy forests, up slate rock pathways, and atop grassy ridges. At one grassy spot the sun is warming us irresistibly and we stop for a half hour sun bath. By the time we resume walking our bodies feel like warmed Jello and we nearly glide the remaining miles to Cosby Knob Shelter. At the shelter the three college boys (named Ben, Brendon, and Jag) are playing cards, and they greet us by remarking on the delicious aroma of pancakes that morning. They will be able to indulge in those sorts of luxuries soon enough as they will finish their trip through the Smokies tomorrow. Ben offers me two 13 oz squeeze packets of peanut butter that they won't be able to consume and I accept without a second thought. 
I eye the cards with the relish of a board/card gamer too-long removed from his natural habitat and I offer to teach the boys how to play Euchre. They have been playing go-fish for over two hours and are ready for something new so after setting up our tent I show them the game and we play until the sun begins to go down. A ridge-runner rolls into camp and asks to see our Smokies Permits so I compliantly dig them out of my bag to display the rites of passage. This ridge-runner is particularly passionate about LNT/preservation principles and insists we eat at the shelter instead of near our tent. Checklist is not feeling hungry after our late lunch nor is she anxious to listen to a lecture while eating so I cook mac'n'cheese at the shelter without her company. While I eat I learn that I should: -Spit toothpaste in our trashbag so we can pack it out (even though our charcoal toothpaste won't attract bears it might harm plants).-Clean my dirty dishes by drinking the food-bit filled wash-water. -Drink my pasta water (heaven forbid I drain it like a normal human being).-And hang my entire backpack (why not, after all, if the bear can get my food bag he might as well have all my stuff to play with).
I retire to our tent in disgust and Checklist reminds me that the ridge-runner isn't purposefully nitpicking, she just doesn't have a Biblical perspective of the world around her. The Bible tells us to be stewards of the earth, and that means we are to seek to maintain the beauty and majesty of God's creation while recognizing our rightful place in it (conservation). The John Muirs of this world hold that nature would be better off if man didn't interfere at all (preservation). 
My perspective properly informed by my wise wife I nonetheless put up our rainfly to keep out the ""wind"" for the night. Tomorrow we will (hopefully) leave the Smokies and we are looking forward to the freedom that comes with getting out of this undeniably beautiful park. The weather is unbelievably fabulous and on days like this I feel as if I could live out here indefinitely. I guess I would eventually get too hungry for pizza and go looking for a Dominos.

Today is an exciting day because we are getting out of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park! Another huge milestone in the journey of a thru-hiker is about to be behind us. We awake filled with anticipation and our oatmeal packets are still tumbling in our bellies when we begin the 10 mile descent to Davenport Gap. We leave before Ben, Brendon, and Jag do but we know they'll probably catch us before we get to the bottom. The miles roll by quickly at first, and we stop 4 miles in at a tall pointy rock to take a break. I have several bags of dried banana chips and I experiment by trying the chips with squirts of newly acquired peanut butter. The combination is delicious and Checklist helps me finish most of one of the 13oz peanut butter tubes before we decide to continue on. 
About a mile from Davenport Gap Shelter we encounter a group of women hikers out for the day. They tell us that someone has set up a table for trail magic down at the gap and has coffee and treats. We are pumped and the mile to the shelter goes by quickly. We hastily eat lunch with our minds on a potential party 3 miles away. It is of course possible, we remind ourselves, that the people could be set up for a morning trail magic and have now left, but we can't keep from hoping for various treats nonetheless. One mile later we pass the sign marking the north border of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. We celebrate by quickening our pace but stumble into the gap an hour later to find no table and no sign of life except for Ben, Brendon, and Jag, who we congratulate on a successful completion of the Smokies. Thinking we may just be overlooking our trail angels we hike another half mile to an interstate overpass. Alas, the angels are gone and we are left with dashed dreams and spirits as low as they've been since the bad weather over a week ago. 
Ideally we would resupply at the Walmart in Newport, TN about 16 miles away. Unfortunately a hitch seems dangerous and unlikely from the interstate and without trail angels we have no inside knowledge or help. We struggle another mile to Standing Bear Farm Hostel, which is just off the trail and supposedly has a small resupply shack. We've heard somewhat shady descriptions of the place and the commune-like mass of outbuildings immediately has us feeling nervous. An unkept man greets us with a single-toothed smile from the derelict porch of a ramshackle building and directs us to a shack for resupply. What I really want is a pint (or half-gallon) of ice-cream but instead we find a dusty room full of expired food and a fridge full of cheap sodas. There aren't many options and we can barely scrape together enough food to fit our needs for the next few days. My caloric intake has been up to a glorious 6000 a day since Gatlinburg but now it looks like a drop back to around 3000 is in the cards until we can get to a real grocery store again.
We hurry away from this disaster of a resupply frustrated with how the day is going. Communicating poorly and taking our annoyances out on one another we haul ourselves two miles up the side of Snowbird mountain and find a pleasant campsite next to a babbling creek. We pitch tent and make the world right again over dinner. After supper I start a fire in the rock ring next to us and we stare into the flames as the sun goes down. Today has been a frustrating and disappointing day and we are both looking forward to Hot Springs, NC just 30 miles away.

The early morning is cloudy and feels chilly after the 70s of yesterday, so we wait stubbornly in our tent until the sun appears in its rightful place above the trees. I retrieve our food bags for breakfast and note with dismay that my Zline cord is in bad shape. A proper bear hang is done using a carabineer as a pulley but I find that method tedious and prone to tangling so I've just been straight-heaving the bags up over a stout branch. This simple method causes more friction to my (expensive) lightweight cord and it has broken in several places already. Someone has left about 50ft of Paracord at the campsite so I add it to my pack reasoning that if all goes well I can trade it out for the lighter rope. 
We hit the trail around 9:30am hoping to leave the troubles of yesterday behind us. It is a fascinating thing to watch the change of seasons so intimately. We began our hike at the tail end of winter and now we are seeing the early signs of spring at lower elevations. We see blooming Round-lobed Hepatica, Wild Geranium, Trout Lily, and Spring Beauties. Even the Trillium is spreading open its three leaves in preparation for a blossom. As we continue our hike we will be able to watch Spring catch us completely and then pass as summer begins to set in. This is an exciting feature of the timing of our thru hike.
We climb several miles to the top of Snowbird Mountain where we find a rough grassy bald and a fenced in FAA tower. The distant mountain ranges on all sides and the warning signs around the tower have the cumulative effect of an otherworldly place. I feel as if we have stepped into the scene of an alien movie in the making. We take a quick lunch (a return to tuna tortillas feels criminal after my bagel sandwiches) and enjoy the sunshine before heading down the other side of Snowbird. It is a long painful descent that leaves us briefly thankful to reach the bottom. Then we climb again for over two miles, by which time we are happy to accept a short descent to Brown Gap. We settle in a little patch of woods nestled in a branch of US Forest Service roads and eat a quick meal of mac'n'cheese with hot chocolate. A motorcyclist and several vehicles drive noisily by and we hope the disturbance isn't a foreshadowing of the coming night.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647241,"(Max Patch)We sleep fitfully through the night and awake occasionally to listen to the wind blow morosely through the gap. The sounds of creaking trees and winds howling are some of our least favorite out here and they always leave us rather bleary-eyed come morning. We pack up camp robotically and begin trudging up the ascent to Max Patch several miles away. The sun is promising another beautiful day but our minds are already in Hot Springs and it is difficult to focus on the here & now. 
Just before Max Patch the AT intersects with a side trail that leads to a parking lot for easy public access. A middle-aged couple is out for a day hike and we allow them to lead the way up the steps to the start of the grassy bald. Just down from the summit we stop and chat with them as we all enjoy the views to the southern side. Their names are Anne & Horace Jennings and they are thrilled to meet thru-hikers. We answer their questions about how resupplies, water, and mileage works for thru-hikers and I walk to the top of Max Patch pleased at the good company and conversation. At the top several day-hikers are wandering around and we meet Scott & Dax, Sesi & his family, and are rejoined by Anne and Horace. It is around 11am, a little too early to be gobbling down our paltry tuna packets, so we stretch out on the grass to enjoy a sunny break with a view before continuing. Max Patch is a staggering 392 acres and is vast and endless. I am reminded of the grassy hilltop scene in ""The Sound of Music"" where Maria is teaching the Von Trapp children the foundation of music. As we sit and soak up the sun Horace comes over and offers us a fresh deli sandwich. He claims they have extra and don't need it. We are overwhelmed both by his generosity and by the amazingly crisp piece of lettuce on the sandwich. We savor each morsel and agree this is the best trail magic yet. As we relax yet again to let the free food settle in our stomachs Anne approaches with another sandwich and a bag of potato chips. ""I decided you guys need this more than I do"" she grins, and we munch slowly on the rest of our unexpected meal while contemplating the surprising kindness from the hearts of complete strangers. We have heard so much about this type of trail magic that seems to follow thru-hikers on their journey but it still is overwhelming to experience it in person. Sesi has seen the exchange and offers the only thing he has, which is water from his water bottle. We are touched at his giving spirit but assure him we have plenty of water from the many streams we've been passing. 
20 minutes later we hoist our packs to our shoulders and begin descending down the north side of Max Patch. Two miles down we stop at Roaring Fork Shelter for a quick lunch and a nice talk with ""The Tram"" and ""Easy Loper"", a married couple who are section hiking southward to Davenport Gap. They are congenial and tell us to give them a call when we get closer to their home in Virginia.
We end our day at Walnut Mountain Shelter, a small shelter with a long walk to water. A section hiking family with their dog is there already and another solo section hiker rolls into camp as we talk with the mother. We all cook dinner together as the wind does its best to annoy us. All of us are planning to hike the 13 miles to Hot Springs tomorrow and we bounce around thoughts on lodging and food as the sun touches the treetops. 
It is dark when I make a last minute trip to the shelter privy, which seems to have been designed without privacy in mind. The doorless structure is placed in such a way that the user is exposed completely to someone coming north on the trail and I can't imagine it sees much daytime use. I return to our beloved home (our tent) for the night and gratefully pull off my shoes for the last time today.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647469,"(Happy Gnomad Hiker House)At this stage of our hike we have become rather picky about tent sites. Each night we debate the best place and orientation for the tent. Last night we quickly found a soft patch of dirt for the tent close to the shelter and bear cables. Unfortunately the strong gusts of wind during the night sweep the silt under our rainfly and through the mesh of our tent. We wake groggily to find that everything in our tent, including ourselves, is covered in a fine layer of dust. It feels exactly like a scene from Interstellar. Checklist is on the side closest to the wind and has borne the brunt of the driving wind.  It is around 5:30am and we endure the dust for several minutes before realizing we might as well be hiking in the dark. We put on headlamps and do our best to shake as much dust as possible off our gear before stuffing it in our backpacks and heading off for a long walk to Hot Springs. Just down from the ridge the wind is almost non-existent and we realize our miserable morning could have been avoided had we chosen a different location.
Our goal is to beat the rain forecasted for the afternoon, but the morning is sunny and pleasant and it is tempting to forget we need to hurry. We make great time down to Garenflo Gap where we see a sign for the hiker hostel we will spend the night at. Our anticipation is building and we scurry several miles to the top of a long descent down to the town. We can see Hot Springs long before we reach it, a tortuous experience that the trail seems to delight in. Our joints gasp in relief as we reach the bottom (just 1:30pm!) and we are elated to have beaten the rain that begins to sprinkle even as we head down the trail toward Main Street. We meet Radioactive and Sparky coming back up the trail to Laughing Heart Hostel where they are staying and they seem pleased to see us. Sparky is carrying a bag full of snacks and treats and is in a chipper mood, probably related to the fact that he doesn't have to walk in the coming thunderstorm. 
The rain picks up as we hurry to Hillbilly Market/Dollar General to get ingredients for supper and breakfast. A trip to both places yields what we need and we call our hostel for a pickup excited to get to a warm dry place for the night. Ten minutes later a white Prius pulls up and a large energy-filled man bounds out with a smile to give us a hand with our bounty. On the way to the hostel we chat with our host ""Jumanji"", who thru-hiked several years ago and has since opened up a hostel with a fellow hiker ""Sunshine"". We get to the home for the night, which is a small quaint house that could easily be an Airbnb. The inside is visually appealing and has been designed by thru-hikers for thru-hikers. We are overcome by the attractiveness and hominess of the place and no sooner have our hosts left us than we agree to spend tomorrow night here as well. 
We settle down to making burgers and salads while the rain outside begins to pour. It is so comforting to cook real food together in a clean organized space after weeks of hunching over a isobutane fuel canister. As we cook several other hikers filter in and we meet section hiker ""Pepperette"" who thru-hiked several years ago and is now attempting to redo the Smokies in better weather. We also meet two older women (""Smiley"" & Jessica) who are section hiking together out of their vehicles and have decided to spend the night indoors out of the rain. We all sit at the kitchen table for over an hour and talk about the trail, life, and anything else that comes to mind. As things wind down for the night we launder our clothes, enjoy hot showers, and make a hot batch of brownies to enjoy in bed. A day that ends with food, showers, and clean sheets can't be anything else but a fantastic day.

29 days into a thru-hike . . . and although it is still early we are already beginning to experience things that are hard to describe to those who have never walked the trails we are walking. I am beginning to crave foods I typically don't eat and I am beginning to savor food I don't typically enjoy. I pause when adding salt and pepper to the frying pan simply to smell the fragrance of an omelet blending with seasonings as it sizzles in bacon grease. I feel almost guilty being away from the trail, as if I am somehow cheating on the trail by spending two nights indoors in a row. 
This doesn't mean we feel regret over missing two days of rain. Happy Gnomad Hiker House is a dream come true for us. What Airbnb has a fridge with three packs of Eckridge sausages that were left by a past hiker for future hikers to enjoy? What hotel has ice-cream, frozen pizzas, sodas, and farm-fresh eggs just sitting around available to buy on the honor system? And what vacation home comes with two chill nextdoor hosts that want to talk for an hour about life & hiking?
The first thing we do after waking up is make breakfast. Together we consume a pound of Tater Tots, a dozen eggs cooked with minced pepper and onion, 4 Eckridge sausages, a pound of bacon, and generous portions of salsa. We are learning that it is cheaper, tastier, and more fun to cook our food instead of eat out while in town. We didn't arrive planning to stay an extra night but there is plenty of food around to fill us and tempt us. Jumanji and Sunshine have food scattered throughout the kitchen with price tags; each hiker gets a blank receipt and can add things to his/her ""tab"" throughout their stay. A package of Oreos, pasta + pasta sauce, and several cans of pop are on our tab by the end of this day.
It feels surreal to loaf around the house while the rain pours outside. There are no major chores for the day and we don't have anything planned either. No one else is here and that is fine with us, we got plenty of interaction last night. We watch movies, do a puzzle, take baths, snack on whatever is appealing, and RELAX. This time is not just the fulfillment of a desire to take things easy, we plan to up our mileage in the coming weeks and we want our bodies to have a small reprieve before we put a bit of pressure on. 
Jumanji and Sunshine stop in late in the afternoon to find us watching ""The Black Stallion"" and we pause it to converse with them awhile. We noticed the LOTR trilogy on the movie shelf earlier and now Jumanji tells us that a LOTR movie marathon is the activity of choice for many thru-hikers who stop here for a day (or two). It does make sense . . . Google tells me that Frodo's journey to Mount Doom was around 1800 miles, which is comparable to the 2200 AT miles thru-hikers are attempting.
By the end of the day we are worn out from all our hard work and we fall into bed ready for another good night's sleep. Tomorrow afternoon we are planning to resupply and get back on the trail. Tonight the last thing I'll do is switch off the lamp on my nightstand.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647471,"Our bodies are becoming trained to wake and sleep with the rising and setting of the sun. Most mornings we wake up around 6:30am, and most evenings we go to bed around 7:30pm. Even though we are still staying indoors at a hostel my body wakes me up early at 6am. I putter around the empty house feeling both out of place and at home. I am unbelievably relaxed and I don't have a care in the world. Checklist joins me and we have an early breakfast with music playing softly in the background. Afterwards we curl up in our favorite spots with a big white fuzzy blanket and read guest book entries to each other. There isn't a bad review anywhere and many of the guests have stayed multiple times.
Jumanji stops by with a busy day ahead but we spend a happy hour with him talking about our mutual passion of foraging for wild mushrooms like Lions Mane, Chicken of the Woods, Oyster, and of course Morels. After he leaves we pack our bags to ready for an early afternoon departure. Although other hostels are hopefully in our future we feel sad to leave this homey place and all of its charm. As we sit down to a farewell lunch of lentil soup, cucumbers, apples, and buttered sweet potatoes, Jumanji drops off two more thru-hikers in quick succession. We meet ""Red Dawn"", a young man who looks to be in his late 20s; and ""Smiles"", a congenial older man who is making his second try at a thru. We commiserate with our new friends about the hardships of past miles and the ridiculousness of the Standing Bear resupply shack. Red Dawn cooks a full-size frozen pizza from the freezer and brings it to the couch with a Coke and our bottle of ranch (which we will leave behind along with the ketchup and mustard we bought for burgers). He apologizes for his lack of manners and we laugh at the thought of being appalled by such a logical act. He doesn't hesitate in movie selection and when Jumanji arrives fifteen minutes later to shuttle us back to the trail we are already enjoying the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring. I wonder if Red Dawn will make it through all three movies . . .
It is sad to bid our new friend Jumanji goodbye but it also is part of being a thru-hiker. It is our goal to make friends and memories like this many times over throughout this journey and that can only happen if we are willing to embrace change and keep moving. At the outfitter we check the hiker box and find nothing, but we do meet another thru-hiker; ""Hand Blaze"", who got his name because he touches every white blaze he sees. We wish him well as we leave knowing he will most likely catch us in a day or two. We resupply at Dollar General and walk down main street (which is also the AT) with heavy backpacks loaded with food. Upon leaving the town we hike alongside the French Broad River for a while before climbing up and away from Hot Springs. Four miles later it is getting dark and we pick a campsite and set up our tent. Our bear bags are HEAVY tonight and it takes all my strength to hoist them 20 ft into the air. Good thing I left my frayed Zline in the hiker box back in Hot Springs, I don't think it would have withstood the test my new Paracord did.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647472,"It is an amazing thing to retrieve food bags in the morning that are loaded with fresh resupply food. The unfortunate reality on the trail is that the most attractive food and snacks get eaten very quickly, and this means that the day before a resupply we are down to the bare essentials. Those days are coming but today is a great day that starts with pop tarts, oatmeal packets, cosmic brownies, dried mangos, and cheese sticks and we're on the trail by 8am ready to get some miles under our belt. Some snow is in the forecast for Saturday (today is Thursday) and the more we do now, the less we have to do later. We've gotten into the habit of setting two goals in the morning: an easy goal, and a difficult goal. This gives us the flexibility of an early stop, a late day, or somewhere in the middle. 
The ups and downs of the day are brutal and we find ourselves out of breath often as we ride the roller coaster of hills. We stop for lunch at a shelter and chat with thru-hikers ""Mr. Clean"", ""Buttercup"", ""Milkman"", and Deluxe, who has left Old Goat and Trimpi behind in Hot Springs. Our Zero at Happy Gnomad has allowed a number of hikers to catch up with us and we hear mention of many thru-hikers we haven't met yet. After lunch we overcome a difficult 8 mile stretch to make it to Little Laurel Shelter (our far goal) by 5:30pm. We enter the shelter area to find a cesspool of thru-hikers milling about. Half a dozen are congregated at the shelter and at least that many more are hiked up in tents. We are reunited with Russ (who has now been dubbed ""No. 2 Pencil""), who passed us while we were in Hot Springs. Deluxe comes in just after us and now all of our friends from lunch are here with the exception of Milkman, who is amazingly on day 14 and has decided the 19 miles from Hot Springs isn't enough. We hear he is headed to the next shelter about 5 miles farther on. We briefly meet ""Jay Hawk"", ""Laura"", ""Stumbles"", ""Florida Man"", and ""Naps"" (different than the ""Nap"" we met back at the Fontana Hilton). We set up our tent a fair bit away from the shelter next to a fire pit that we can use to roast our hotdogs. Deluxe sets up camp nearby while making us laugh with his antics. He has a veritable palace of tent that looks like it could sleep 4 people with room to spare. When we tease him he laughingly admits that he is also carrying two and a half liters of Coca Cola and more food than he could ever eat. ""I am Deluxe after all"" he reasons merrily.
We start a fire and begin to roast our sausages over the flame. The smell and warmth is comforting and it draws some hikers from the surrounding area who now seem eager to hang out with us. We talk with Laura for a while about aches, pains, and gear. A middle-aged couple lope into camp and the woman's eyes light up when she sees the fire. She plops down contentedly while her husband begins doing camp chores. We learn they are ""Yard Sale"" and ""Doctor Phil"", trail runners who are finishing a hundred mile section tomorrow. No. 2 Pencil, Florida Man, and Stumbles mosey over and we all let the day wind down together. Dr. Phil and I hang food bags together on the cable that is overloaded with food bags. Checklist and I then climb into our tent and chuckle about how the evening went. I guess now we know for the future, if we want company . . . just start a campfire!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647473,"(from left to right: Florida Man, Deluxe, Stumbles, No. 2 Pencil, and Checklist)While the shelter area last night may have been a crowded hiker metropolis this morning we awake to find the camp nearly emptied. Doctor Phil and Yard Sale are ending their section today and are in no huge hurry to get going. Besides them we see no one else nearby as we head up the trail at 8am. The morning miles fly by quickly and before we know it we are making our way up Big Firescald Knob. Upon reaching the top of the rocky ridge we see a small gathering of hikers who have stopped to enjoy the views on both sides. They trickle out before we do but we catch them in the sunny clearing at the shelter several miles further on. No. 2 Pencil, Deluxe, Florida Man, and Stumbles are all laughing and having a good time. We stop for lunch and enjoy the satisfaction of having 300 miles under our belt as well as the comaraderie of like-minded people. 
Everyone is in a good mood because of the sunshine and good weather and we talk trail language and snap a group photo before people start to leave. No. 2 Pencil convinces Stumbles to push 9.5 more miles to make it to a pickup place from which they can shuttle to town. Deluxe and Florida Man are planning to make to the shelter 7 miles away where they will try to weather the incoming storm. This is our plan too and it is comforting to know we won't be alone out here. The last 7 miles isn't quite as easy as the first and we are passed by some faster hikers on the way. Hand Blaze is the first to pass us, he is putting in a 24 mile day to make it to a road where his parents (who live nearby) can pick him up for a Zero day. The next to fly by is Pickle, who has similar escape plans and strong legs with which to execute said plans. Last of all, Red Dawn and ""Joel"" pass us just before the last hill a mile from the shelter. They are both planning to spend the night at the shelter and then hike several miles in the snow to a pickup point tomorrow. 
We reach the shelter and learn that Deluxe accidentally poked a hole in his tent while setting it up and decided to just keep going. We are disappointed that we will miss his cheerful commentary on the miseries sure to arrive tonight and tomorrow. It is still warm out as we eat supper and it is unsettling to think that snow is just a few hours away. We've decided to sleep in the shelter (for the first time) tonight and as day turns to night we bounce optimistic thoughts back and forth with Florida Man, Red Dawn, and Joel, who are all staying the night here as well. As we bed down for good I feel grateful to have brought zero degree sleeping bags; tonight and tomorrow night will be perhaps the first and only time they get put to the test.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647474,"The plan was simple: stay warm through the night in the shelter (low of 26 with snow and rain), make 8.8 miles to Hogback Shelter, and live through a zero degree night to prove our thru-hiker worthiness. . .
The first sign that all may not be going as planned is a sprinkle of snow on my face at 3am in the morning. I awake with a rush to find the wind has blown snow through the shelter opening and has dusted my bag with the wet white flakes. I begin brushing off my bag vigorously (down loses its insulating property when wet) and my movements alert everyone else in the shelter to the situation. Florida Man's corner of the shelter has gotten the worst of it and his quilt is soaked. Everyone else is suffering from damp bags except for Red Dawn, who positioned himself for success in the only dry corner.
Joel slips his bag into a waterproof bivvy and I throw our rainfly over our bags to keep the snow separated from us as much as possible. I should have had the foresight to tie the rainfly over the shelter opening but I didn't think the snow would drift under the deep overhang. We all make a best attempt at sleep for several hours and finally reach daybreak at 7am. Red Dawn and Joel are the first out, which is understandable since they have a warm hostel to look forward to. 
This is typically the part of the story where people begin to pity Checklist for the crazy  husband who drags her into his wild goose chases. Understand, at times like these Hums is the one ready to bail and Checklist is the one determined to push on. Please . . . if you pity anyone . . .  pity me!
Florida Man leads us out of the shelter and we follow his footprints down the mountain to the gap several miles below. The snow on the ground provides a welcome cushion for our feet but the falling snow (while beautiful) makes it difficult to see. In addition, the Rhododendron are heavy with snow and we have to duck and sidestep constantly to avoid being plastered with the snowy boughs. At the bottom of the mountain we pass Red Dawn and Joel, who are waiting for their shuttle to arrive. It is tempting to join them and escape to safety but the idea of spending money to perform a duty our sleeping bags should be capable of seems redundant, so we push on to follow the blurry figure of Florida Man. Half a mile later we find him standing at a road intersection with a sign that says: ""Hostel, 100 yards west, $20 per person, pizza, snacks, cold drinks"". ""I'm really thinking about it"" Florida Man says with a glance up at the climb to the aptly named Frozen Knob, which towers 1700 feet above us. The prospect of finding our own way doesn't sit well with us and we agree to at least check this cheaper hostel out. The hostel turns out to be just a bunkhouse with a shower. In our current state we need only to see a small heater to clinch the deal. 
The place would be absolutely laughable if we were in circumstances other than these. The frozen pizzas are overpriced, the bunkroom is just a shed, the heater is weak, the shower pipes are unflappably frozen, and the owner lives in a nearby mobile home with his college-aged son. With nothing to look forward to but a very cold night in damp sleeping bags the place looks like a haven and we waste no time setting up camp inside. We talk the owner's son into bringing us a second heater, and Florida Man argues us $5 back each for the lack of shower. The heaters warm the inside of the uninsulated building to a toasty 45ish degrees and we happily dry our socks and shoes in front of the small heaters. 
We watch the snow blow outside and are thankful to have found shelter for the night out of the extreme cold. I believe that our bags would have kept us warm but it is also wise to not test such things without a backup plan. We spend the afternoon talking with Florida Man, whose  thoughts on life drip with sarcasm and humor and make us laugh often. He is a true character and has a kind heart hidden behind his roughened edges, which we would not have seen had we not been forced into this situation together. We commiserate about the struggles we have in common, like somehow not eating all our food on days like this. 
The sky finally darkens and we are able to snuggle in dry sleeping bags with the knowledge that we will sleep safely tonight no matter how low temperatures drop outside. Tomorrow's forecast is bright and warm and hopeful, but we are glad to be inside on this snowy night.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647475,"It is cold inside our plywood shelter when we wake up. We've stayed toasty warm through the night in our sleeping bags but our two miniscule heaters are struggling to keep up with the temperatures outside. My shoes are frozen to the floor and break free with a loud snap when I give them a good yank. Florida Man left water in his pot to aid in the removal of some burnt cheese and now finds a frozen block of ice instead of liquid. We get up and set about making hot chocolate and hot oatmeal to help jumpstart our day. Florida Man is in less of a hurry than we are to get moving because he has a quicker pace than we do and thus has more flexibility with timing. 
The outside air feels frosty when we start hiking but the sun warms us nicely, as does the climb up to Frozen Knob. Several hikers have already broken a path so we don't have to worry about getting lost or looking for blazes. Gathering from the footprints leading off the trail to each white-blazed tree, Hand Blaze is one of those ahead of us this morning. The snow is not terribly deep and is around 3-6 inches in most places but there are areas where the wind has piled the snow up and the biggest drift I measure is over 2 feet deep. The snow is enchanting with the sunlight gleaming through the trees and the beauty of each waterfall and view is magnified greatly by the dusting of white powder. 
We stop for lunch at Hogback Shelter and I build a small snowman that will most likely melt within a day or two. Florida Man arrives as we are leaving and admires my handiwork. Next we climb up to a small meadow where we can see north to Big Bald, a treeless mountaintop we will climb tomorrow. We see Buttercup and Mr. Clean coming toward us from the opposite direction and learn they are slackpacking for the day (slackpacking is when a thru-hiker is dropped off at the beginning of the day with a light day pack and is picked up at the end to be returned to a Hotel or a Hostel for the night.). We walk several miles further on to Low Gap where we find a snowy campsite and a barely flowing spring. I've learned from experience to look for a good bear hang branch while it is still light out, and I'm throwing my Paracord over a branch to ready it for later when I see Florida Man coming up trail. He is ready to end his day here so we enthusiastically welcome him to our humble campsite. I feel an urge to have a campfire to brighten our chilly day and the damp sticks and twigs  amazingly cooperate with me to produce a crackling beauty. The three of us sit around the campfire and eat dinner while doing our best to dry and warm ourselves. I hang food bags and crawl into our tent feeling as though we have battled the snowy conditions and come out victorious.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647476,"(a view from Big Bald)Even though we've been on the trail over a month I still suffer from a brief few seconds of disorientation each morning. ""Where am I?"" ""What am I doing here?"" ""Oh yeah . . . AT"". This morning I am jarred into reality by the sight of snow on the ground next to the tent door. Last night my every movement made a squeaky sound as the snow underneath the tent was compressed. When we roll up the tent to put it away we find that our body heat has melted all that snow and left a wet patch of leaves for someone else to use. Hopefully by the time they get here it will be dryer than it is now.
Florida Man leaves just before we do and we don't see him until 3 miles later at the top of Big Bald. Naps is here as well, and we all take a moment to enjoy the 360 degree views. This feels like a better version of Max Patch and we are disappointed we don't have enough time to stop and sunbathe. Naps and Florida Man speed ahead of us and we slowly follow, picking our way through the snowy slushy mud that still is over a foot deep in some places. We stop for lunch at Big Bald Shelter and are joined by ""Christmas Tree"" who thru-hiked about a decade ago and is out for about a 1000 mile jaunt from Springer to Damascus. He is carrying cold pizza and the smell makes us hungry and hopeful. Checklist drops several hints about being low on food but the AT veteran doesn't look interested in giving away his so we pack up and head out. We still have over 10 miles left, which seems daunting, especially since it is just past noon. We trudge through the snow for a while, doing our best not to fall and get ourselves wet, muddy, or bruised. 
A female trail runner flys by us and we marvel at her ability to keep her feet in these treacherous conditions. Several minutes later a male duplicate passes us and slows to ask us if we are thru-hikers. When we respond with an affirmative he shocks us by saying ""us too!"". We learn his name is Patrick, and his friend's name is Gia (neither has trail names yet). They are slackpacking today and are headed to Erwin to complete what will be a 33 mile effort. He has been doing his best to stay with his trail family (or tramily) but is finding it difficult to keep up with his female friend. From the way he talks we suspect he is engaging in a practice called ""Pink-Blazing"", where a male hiker changes his hiking schedule to match that of a female hiker he likes. We feel sorry for Patrick and hope his current schedule won't lead him into an injury. 
We follow Patrick for a time hoping to draft off of his pace and get some miles in. We pass Florida Man who has had a fall that bruised his leg. He is wisely taking it slow and talks of getting to town to rest and heal. We finally let Patrick leave us behind and look at our maps to learn we are only several miles away from our goal for the night. We roll into No Business Shelter two hours later and settle in gratefully. I start a fire so we can enjoy the comfort and warmth as we wind down for the day. Florida Man comes in just after us and we all talk about getting to a pizza buffet tomorrow in Erwin. The log book is full of hikers' signatures that we recognize and we are surprised  to learn that a good portion were here earlier today. Radioactive & Sparky, ""Jon from Montana"" (who we've been chasing for several weeks), and some people we met a day ago: ""Snake Farm"" & ""Snow"". 
As we shut down for the night two more hikers roll into camp with headlamps illuminating their way. We meet the other two members of the Gia/Patrick tramily, ""Stevo"" and ""Tadpole"". Checklist and I are sleeping in the shelter so we can dry out our sopping wet tent, so Florida Man moves over to make room for the new arrivals.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647615,"(a view to Erwin)This morning starts early at 5:30am. This isn't by choice, but when you sleep in a shelter with people doing big miles I guess an early morning wake-up is rather inevitable. So far our shelter experience has consisted of being snowed on and woken up early. I think we may go back to the comfort of our tent for a while. 
As we head down the mountain towards town I can't help but dwell on the pizza buffet waiting for us below. I've longed for AYCE pizza since the first week of this journey and now I'm just 6 short miles away from unlimited hot cheesy goodness. With about a mile left we stop to take a break and admire the sight of Erwin, TN below. The small city is nestled among mountain ranges and looks cozy and inviting. The last mile passes quickly and we end up at the Erwin gateway to NOBO thru-hikers, which is a small hostel/outfitter by the river. They are known for their forty cent Snickers Bars (max of two) and it is easy to justify adding them to my pack for later. 
I have a phone number that Patrick gave me yesterday, and I call to learn that the mysterious trail angel is indeed good for a free ride. He pulls up within minutes in a jacked-up Toyota Tundra and we climb in to meet ""Mr. Green"", who thru-hiked in 2019 with his newly wedded wife. He is unbelievably kind and informs us he is at our disposal, recent times have left him with a flexible schedule and he loves to help hikers. Our first stop is Food City, where we buy an inordinate amount of food that only fits in our packs after lots of shoving, squeezing, and using of outside tie-points. 
Next we pick up Florida Man at the nearby outfitter and head to Pizza Plus. We walk in to find a large salad bar, a friendly waitress who keeps our drinks filled, and enough hot pizza to get us all sufficiently bloated. With the pizza dancing before my eyes Checklist has trouble convincing me to start slow with a salad. I particularly love the cinnamon pizza with icing and I happily consume my age in pieces while alternating with roughly the same amount of normal pizza. 
Afterwards we waddle outside and struggle with our now overloaded packs. Mr. Green picks us up again and drops off Florida Man at his hotel before shuttling us back to the AT. He lives just off the trail up ahead and offers to take our packs and meet us a mile farther on. Our bodies are thankful for a chance to recover from our overfeeding and the mile feels light and airy without our usual burdens. Mr. Green and his wife ""Cardiana"" congratulate us on our quick mile as we rejoin them and invite us to join them at a Taco Tuesday they are hosting in their campground. Their generosity is touching but our bellies revolt at the idea of more food so we heave our packs to our backs and begin the trek up and out of Erwin. The miles pass slower than they did this morning and we are thankful when a good campsite appears atop a ridge. Checklist decides to save her portion of the salad we packed up so I eat mine nonchalantly while she writes in her paper notebook. She is using the Rite-in-the-Rain Journal and is almost finished with her current book. When we finally hit the sack it is deep into the night. Today has been a long day, but tomorrow it will rain and we are pleased that we were able to knock out several extra dry miles while we still had the chance.

I don't like looking out a window at the stuff, much less waking up in a tent with it drumming on my rainfly! Some people may enjoy the experience but I just end up trying to figure out how to best stay dry. 
Checklist is suffering from a budding sinus infection and is in agreement at the idea of a light day. We can still make up the miles over the next few days and get to Hampton TN on schedule. I say ""schedule"" not to imply that we have to move at a certain speed, rather that we only have so much food until the next good resupply. We have been trying to purposefully resist the common thought that more miles per day is better than less. Out here the physical challenge is paired with the vacationing aspect to create somewhat of a dichotomy. The physicality of the trail seems to invite the FKTs (Fastest Known Time) and the CYTCers (Calender Year Triple Crown). On the other hand, since when does one brag about completing a vacation in record time? Can you imagine your neighbor bragging about his vacation to the Caribbean over a backyard barbeque, ""Yep, got it done in 4 days this time! Had to drag the wife and kids off the beach to get it done but by golly we did it!""
Suffice to say, all things in moderation. Everyone is out here for different reasons and just wants to hike their own hike (HYOH).
We wait in our tent stubbornly until the rain finally relents early in the afternoon. We pack up silently and trudge 5 miles in the misty gloom. The enveloping fog spoils any views we would have had from Beauty Spot, and it makes us feel isolated and alone. It is nice on days like these to have the comfort of one another.
The one perk of the day is how much food we have. I do a quick calorie count at dinnertime and am pleased to find that I am at right around 8000 calories for the day. Tomorrow and the next day will be incrementally less substantial but it is nice to go to bed without the smallest vestige of hunger. 
When we finish supper the forest around us is darkened and I have trouble finding my bear hang where I prepped it earlier. My headlamp is useless in the dense fog and I am glad when the chore is done and I am safely back in the tent. Not all days are fun out here, some just aren't very enjoyable.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647619,"(Unaka Mountain)We awake to another gloomy morning with runny noses and poor spirits. I've developed a sympathy case of Checklist's sinitus that is probably from eating too close to bedtime. Usually we end up with a campsite that is slightly tilted, which encourages mid-night sliding but has the upside of helping our bodies digest food. Last night the tent site was almost perfectly flat . . . hence the sinus problems and sore throats this morning. 
We start hiking late in the morning and make poor time to Cherry Gap Shelter which is just over Unaka Mountain. The top of the mountain is densely forested with beautiful spruce trees and the fog is heavy up here. The sight does little to change our present mood and even the sun late in the day can't lift us out of our depression. It is no fun being sick anywhere, but it really isn't fun to be sick out here. We contemplate hiking a few more miles and getting a shuttle to a hostel, but decide we may as well be miserable out here as miserable somewhere that costs money. 
At the shelter we do our best to munch on some food and pretend that we don't hate life. Thru-hikers begin to come into camp and set up for the night. I make the mistake of telling the first one, an older man by the name of ""Silver Bullet"" that we are under the weather and after that we are avoided like the plague by everyone else. I manage to cordially meet ""Bach"", ""Omega"", and ""Chewy"" before I retire for the day. 
Days like these past few are the reason many thru-hikers throw in the towel. It isn't always the physicality of the trail that causes people to quit; sometimes it is an animal rustling outside the tent, or a rainy week that leaves everything soggy, or the boredom of doing the same thing every day whether they feel like it or not.
It is easy for an aspiring thru-hiker to gloss over things like this in their idealization of the AT. To the reader a bad day is just a paragraph, but to the writer it was a miserable 24 hr stretch in which he longed to be anywhere else but where he was. To be sure, there are days that make it all worth it. For us, today was not one of those days.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647620,"(From left to right: Cocoa, Marlene, and Checklist)Today starts in a glorious way with the sun making a grand appearance on the horizon. After several days of humid fog we are glad for a more cheery start to the day. We are both sniffling and sneezing but we feel much better and are ready to put in a solid day's work. The crowd at the shelter was an early-rising one and they are long gone by the time we break camp. We stop to talk to the other two hikers dawdling: Bach and ""Fiddy"" (so named because he started with a fifty lb pack) . Fiddy tells us that there could be trail magic waiting at Iron Mountain Gap three miles away so we start hiking with some pep in our step. 
An hour and a half later we roll into the gap to find ""Cocoa"", a recent thru-hiker who is supporting ""K-bar"", one of the thru-hikers who tented near us last night. Cocoa has a warm breakfast scramble, homemade brownies, and dozens of treats and snacks. We sit down on the comfy lawn chairs he has provided and chat with him about the trail while enjoying the free food. ""You guys are doing great"" he reassures us after we tell him our start date, ""big miles will come naturally; most people start off averaging ten miles a day for the first month before they get their trail legs"". Fiddy and Bach drop in as we are finishing up and take our places in the chairs as we prepare to move on. Cocoa surprises us all by offering to slackpack us to Hughes Gap (slackpacking takes many forms, but generally involves someone helping a thru-hiker so that they can hike with no pack for a short time). He explains that he is headed to the Gap 10 miles ahead to meet K-Bar with chili for lunch before slackpacking them again over Roan Mountain. Fiddy and Bach slackpacked recently and politely decline the offer, but we happily accept, remembering the easy 1 mile slackpack back in Erwin. Hughes was originally our end goal for the day but 10 miles with nothing weighing us down is too good of an offer to refuse. We grab our Katadyn BeFrees from our backpacks so we can filter water to drink and head up the trail. Our shoulders feel light and airy, our joints feels as though they can withstand any jolt, and our feet seem confused with the unexpected weight loss. We alternate walking, jogging, and running and polish off the 10 miles in a quick 3 hours. When we reach Hughes Gap we are doubly pleased to find two trail angels awaiting us. Cocoa has been joined by ""Marlene the Trail Angel"" who is something of a trail legend. She has a trunk loaded with snacks, treats, and energy bars, and she offers us our choice of hot cocoa or coffee. As we sit and sip hot cocoa with our chili we learn that Marlene is a trail warrior who picks up trash at all the trailheads nearby. She is a fifty minute drive from Hughes but she still managed to clean up 250 lbs of glass from this spot last year alone. Long after Cocoa leaves we sit and talk to this friendly lady about jail ministry, the trail, and her work as a Trail Angel. 
As we grab some candy bars from the trunk and prepare to start the climb up Roan Mountain we realize that we are missing our trekking poles. They are still in the back of Cocoa's car! Marlene needs no time at all to grasp the situation and she speeds off without a word of complaint to make the 16 mile round trip to retrieve our poles. Fiddy and Bach arrive and we explain the situation. They settle down to take a break and await the return of the Trail Angel. Soon enough our angel returns with the lost poles and accepts only a hug as thanks for her time and trouble. When we leave she is already inviting the boys to dig in and help themselves. 
The last few miles are more difficult, both because of the steep uphill and because of the packs once again riding on our shoulders. We make the shelter atop the mountain without undue trouble and find that the shelter (which is the highest on the trail at 6,186 ft) is a completely enclosed cabin with two levels (Roan Mountain is also the last 6 thousand foot mountain until New Hampshire). Entering it we find both levels occupied, with Silver Bullet and Omega on the bottom. We say hello and assure them we are feeling better before retiring to a clearing to set up our tent for the night. The day has turned miserable and we are happy to get in our sleeping bags. Checklist rubs her feet with ointment from a squeeze tube as I survey the guidebook for the miles ahead. All of a sudden, Checklist cries out in alarm and frustration. ""What is it?!"" I ask. ""This is my tube of toothpaste!"" is the reply.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647621,"(Checklist finishing the two mile climb up Big Hump)The morning is damp and unwelcoming and we stay in our tent late into the morning. After several days of being out in humid conditions we feel absolutely disgusting. Everything smells. Everything is dirty. Everything needs a break. Unfortunately our next planned stop is in Hampton, which is still about 50 miles away. The morning passes as we munch on food and sit and study our guidebooks to see if there is any chance of getting to a shower by the end of today. We hatch an ill-advised plan to get to Mountain Harbor B&B for some much needed R&R. The problem? The hostel is over 16 miles away . . . and it's already past 10am. 
Undaunted, we begin covering miles through the Roan Highlands. The area is absolutely stunning and impossible to describe with either words or pictures. The ridges and valleys we traverse are scattered with the occasional tree, are thickly coated with grass, and are high enough in elevation to provide views in all directions. Highlights of the day include Jane's Knob, Little Hump, and Big Hump. Every time I climb up one of these grassy mountainsides I imagine I am Heidi, climbing up the mountain to her grandfather.
Midway through the day we take a short detour to see the decommissioned Overmountain Shelter, which is an old red barn that overlooks a valley (and which was a popular shelter for many years). We both are disappointed it has been deemed unfit for future service, it would have been cool to stay in a barn-shelter.
Late in the day as our feet begin to protest the abuse we pass one more milestone: the NC/TN border. We've flitted back and forth from North Carolina to Tennessee for the past several hundred miles but we are finally saying goodbye for good to North Carolina. It's exciting to knock off another state but our feet are ready to stop and we still have miles to go. We arrive at US 19E absolutely exhausted at around 7:45pm. The sky is dark and we walk up the road a tenth of a mile as the bright headlights of vehicles whiz by. 
Mountain Harbor is abuzz with music, lights, and people, and we are both slightly annoyed to find our end of the day won't be as peaceful as we had hoped. We check in and our host ""Trail Mix"" shows us to our ""private room"", which is just a king bed that has been partitioned off from the main bunkroom with sliding doors and slapdash construction. We feel slightly ripped off but are happy to at least have a bed and a shower instead of a tent and a smelly sleeping bag. A wealth of thru-hikers are here and many have already bedded down for the night. Bach and Fiddy are here as well and they both offer friendly greetings before heading to bed. Cocoa is here with K-bar and Chewy, and the trio are watching a college basketball game with an empty pizza box on the table in front of them. Cocoa is friendly and we laugh about the trekking pole mishap. Chewy and K-bar seem terse and unfriendly so I go about doing chores like throwing away trash and getting the lay of the hostel. Our showers are barely warm, probably because the hot water tank has been emptied by the smorgasbord of hikers. 
I head to bed feeling slightly disgruntled with this place. Supposedly they have the best breakfast on the trail (for the past 13 years anyway), so maybe my outlook will be brightened in the morning.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647745,"(An unforgettable breakfast)Checklist is up first this morning at around 6am and by the time she returns from her shower I am ready to face the day as well. We decided to make a second attempt at a hot shower by getting out of bed before the rest of the slumbering hikers. Our plan was a good one and my day starts with steaming hot water from a shower just barely big enough for my 5 '10 frame. The showerhead has been manipulated upwards and is crammed against the low ceiling to make full use of the space. The person behind this brilliant feat of engineering evidently doesn't mind that the spewing water traces the showerhead down to where it is screwed to the wooden wall. As I scrub a week's worth of grime off my body I stare at the small trickle running across the wood trim and wonder how soon it will be before the rough-sawn plank starts to rot.
After my hot dunk the air inside the hostel feels extra chilly. There are half a dozen space heaters scattered throughout the two story building but they are struggling to keep up with the cold morning. At 8am we walk up the steps to the main house where breakfast is being served family style. I step through the front door to a warm cozy living/dining space that is fairly hopping with activity. Most of the other hikers are already here and are lounging on couches; several ladies are busy bringing out hot food; and a wood stove radiates warmth from the corner of the room. The area is full of aesthetically pleasing objects and stands in sharp contrast to the rough rustic appearance of the hostel. The mistress of the B&B announces our feast is ready and gives us a full description of the legendary bounty we are about to consume. Every pastry, muffin, crescent, and danish is handmade; each slice of bacon and link of sausage is home-raised; and the cooks have been up since 5am preparing the french toast, biscuits and gravy, quiche, and famous tomato pie. There are also chocolate covered strawberries, homemade biscotti, and chocolate dipped cookies to go with hot chocolate and coffee. I stuff my plate until it overflows and fill a cup with cold pulpy orange juice before heading to a spot at the table. 30 minutes later I've gone from thinking $13 is a little pricey to wondering how they can manage such a fantastic spread for such a small amount. The meal would easily be worth $30 in any restaurant setting and the food more than makes up for the disappointing hostel of last night. 
We linger late in the morning as we wait for our laundry to dry. Most of the other hikers have left already but we chat with Fiddy and Bach, who are in no hurry to leave after such a heavy meal. We weigh Fiddy's pack on the scale and I feel much better about my 30 lb pack after learning his is 45 before water weight. We also meet ""Takeabreak"", who was a thru-hiker last year until a strained knee ended his journey here at US 19E. He has come back to pick up where he left off and will start tomorrow morning. He is a foodie like us and we joke about it being hard to leave such wonderful food.
Eventually we pull out, going slow to let our food settle and our bodies warm up. The miles roll by quickly and we hike for a time with ""Outback"", a fellow Hoosier who is hiking the AT as part of a larger hike which began in Florida and will go up into New Finland (ECT). He is pleasant and friendly and his quick pace helps us make quick time to Mountaineer Shelter, where we bid him farewell and stop for the night.
We roast brats over a piney fire and recall the various components of our amazing morning meal. It is undoubtedly a highlight of our thru-hike so far and is a must-see (eat?) for all aspiring thru-hikers. It has left us with full bellies and a satisfying day.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647746,"(Bob Peoples)We have been getting started rather late as of recently, and this morning is no different. As I eat my breakfast of a bagel with cream cheese I hear Fiddy and Bach passing by on the trail behind the tent. By the time we hit the trail we are nearly an hour behind them and I wonder if we will see them again anytime soon. 
A couple miles in we arrive at a road crossing to find the Mountain Harbor Shuttle Van dropping Takeabreak off. This is the spot where he last left the trail and our normally jolly friend is in extra high spirits this morning at his return to the AT. We are moving at a good pace and hike well ahead of him for several hours before stopping for lunch. As we work on making our food bags as light as possible he catches up and stops to eat with us. Takeabreak has a rich and expressive personality and he repeatedly has us laughing with his hilarious stories. ""One time in Gatlinburg a bunch of us thru-hikers were headed back to the trail up at Newfound Gap"" he laughs, ""and there was this hotel serving breakfast; man we came in and just loaded up! I mean we were just stuffing our faces, and nobody said a word!  and then we came out with our pockets just crammed with fruits, peanut butters, honey packets, just everything man!!""
After lunch we say goodbye to Takeabreak (for now) and hike for several hours in the solitude of our thoughts. We are finally gifted with more good company late in the afternoon when ""Professor"" catches us. I have heard a lot about this young man. He is attempting to hike the ECT, PCT, CDT, and several other trails to get to over 11,000 miles in 2022 (which would be a record). We keep up with him for several miles until we decide to take a breather and let him leave us behind. 
Late in the day we begin flagging but manage to make Dennis Cove Road by 6:30pm with daylight left to spare. To our east is Black Bear Resort and west is Kinkora Hiker's Hostel. The latter is our destination; we've heard interesting things about the place and its famed owner: Bob Peoples. As we walk the third of a mile on the two lane highway a car passes and a familiar voice hails us with a greeting. We look up to see Radioactive and Sparky sitting in the back of the Black Bear Shuttle; it would seem we've caught them once again. Who knows, since they are taking a double zero maybe we'll get to lead for a while now? 
We wave goodbye to their familiar faces and turn into the driveway of the Kinkora Hostel to see two more. Fiddy and Bach are sitting on the porch of a log cabin engulfed in English ivy conversing with a well-aged man who can only be Bob Peoples. They're obviously the benefactors of his famed free shuttle and are enjoying Subway sandwiches, sodas, and cigarettes. We park in the dilapidated recliners on the porch and listen to Bob talk as the sun sets. Kinkora is an outpouring of Bob himself and has a wealth of character oozing from every  nook and cranny. The animal life around here consists of three cats, an abundance of songbirds, the hostel mice (who have apparently found a way to survive despite the feline presence), several raccoons who Bob feeds on a daily basis, and a resident Black Bear who Bob tells us is ""shy"". Bob asks if we want a trip to town and we reply that our only need for the night is a spot for our tent; since I am allergic to cats I would struggle inside the hostel itself. Bob instead motions us around back where he has a small cottage that is cat-proof. After we drop our packs off in our night's lodging we head inside the main hostel, where Checklist takes advantage of hiker-left pancake mix and eggs to make us a delicious supper. Bach and Fiddy start a fire in the hostel wood stove as we sit and listen to Bob talk about hiking, travel, and the AT. After an hour I feel as though I've earned a semester's worth of course credit in ancient history, philosophy, and geography. Bob's knowledge bank is exhaustive and he seems to have been everywhere there is to be and seen everything there is to see. He holds us spellbound far past our (and his) bedtime with a vocal cocktail of his hikes across the world (Israel, Spain, Africa, Scotland, Korea, Malta, and so on), the history of the AT (he personally knew Earl Schaffer!), and personal stories of thru-hikers over the years. He is an indescribable person that I feel blessed to be able to meet. His body is being consumed with four different types of cancer but he still fairly glows with energy and life. He even offers to help us slackpack the 8 miles into Hampton tomorrow because, ""he's already going that way"". 
The hostel is a vibrant place but it is obviously just too much for Bob to keep up with all by himself. Dust, mold, cobwebs, and mouse droppings are everywhere and after Bob heads to bed we discuss the best plan of action for the night with Bach and Fiddy. We put our food bags into the fridge and then head to our cottage to bed down for the night. The bed looks as though it has been abused in every possible way so we select the cleanest blanket in the place and drape it over the bed as a protective barrier. This done, we spread our sleeping bags atop the safe space and climb in for the night.  In the main hostel Bach and Fiddy are following a similar procedure downstairs by the woodstove. The raccoons have already paid a visit to the cat food on the porch . . . hopefully the friendly neighborhood bear isn't nearby.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647747,"(Laurel Falls)The bed we ended up on last night was dank, moldy, and unfit for human use . . . but it was a mattress, and we slept like rocks all through the night. By the time we awaken it is light outside, and we stuff our gear into our packs hurriedly. Bob is helping us slackpack over Pond Mountain today and is leaving at 8am to run an errand so we want to have our packs all ready for him. He rouses shortly after we do but doesn't seem to be in a hurry. Bach and Fiddy stumble out of the main hostel bleary-eyed and we all sit around on the front porch as Bob tells more stories. Eventually time presses its demands on us once more and we all go our separate ways. Bach and Fiddy are slow to get moving this morning so Checklist and I are first on the trail. All I carry in my small daypack is a water filter, a water bottle, my phone & trail wallet, my guidebook, and our digital camera. It all feels wonderfully light and we strut along like we don't have a care in the world. 
Two miles in we reach Laurel Falls, a gorgeous cascading waterfall that is just one chink of a fast-moving, bubbling creek. The energy from the attractive sight would ideally fuel us up and over Pond Mountain, but we fizzle out a mile short of the top. As our pace slows to a near crawl I remind myself I could be carrying the full weight of my pack instead of this feather-weight trifle. At last we begin the equally long trek downhill, which drags needlessly before finally rewarding us with the bustling traffic of US 321. 
We stand with our thumbs up for about 15 minutes, but even though Hampton is just three miles down the road we get no takers. Back in Hot Springs a thru-hiker alum named Pepperette told us we might have more luck if I stayed back in the shadows and let Checklist masquerade as a solo female hiker. Supposedly the ploy invokes more pity in the hearts of passing drivers who would leave a couple to find their own way. I am dubious that the strategy has merit but Checklist persuades me to walk a dozen feet backwards and recline against a telephone pole. Sure enough, several minutes later we have a hitch.
In town we check in at Brown's Grocery, a quaint country store with a bit of everything. Sutton Brown is the owner of both the grocery and the hostel where we are staying, and he welcomes us by motioning to our bags, lying against a wall where Bob dropped them this morning. Across the street we get settled into our home for the night, which is the top floor of a massive stone building with a rich history. Food is the first thing on our mind and we decide to walk the mile to the supermarket to get some fresh produce. Half a mile in we pass a local diner and decide we won't make it to the supermarket.
After several inexpensive and delicious entrees apiece we head across the street to the Dollar General (our resupply needs now being much less than they were an hour ago) and fill shopping baskets with snacks, resupply foods, and breakfast materials. This done, we cart our haul back to the hostel where we finally get to enjoy long hot showers. 
Afterwards, as we lounge on couches and enjoy our bounty (like a full cheesecake that I couldn't pass up) we are visited in turn by Sutton and his wife Beverly. They quickly put us at ease and make us feel as if we are old family friends. We learn some of the history of the building, which goes back as far as 1909, when the 50-room structure (known as the Braemer Castle) was the center of Hampton and functioned as a commissary, ice house, and post office.
We retire to our room as the wind howls outside. It gives me a giddy sort of pleasure to escape the nasty bit of weather by retreating to the safety of a hostel.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647845,"(Braemer Castle Hostel)Checklist and I have always agreed that breakfast foods are criminally underrated. I mean, who decided eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits & gravy, cinnamon rolls, and all the rest should be generally restricted to the hours between 5 and 10am? With gas prices the way they are I'm surprised eggs for dinner isn't the new norm! In any case, Checklist and I crave breakfast all the time out here, which is why a hostel with a kitchen (like this one) ranks so high on our list. 
Yesterday we picked up two dozen eggs, a gallon of milk, two packs of sausages, Kellogg waffles, and a bag of Arby's curly fries (who wants hash browns with the world's best fries on the shelf?). By 10am our bellies are full enough to require a couch break so we relax and plan our itinerary for the next few days. Early in the afternoon the sun comes out and makes us feel guilty for sitting inside when we could be hiking. We decide to do the sensible thing and say no to another night's stay here at Braemer Castle Hostel. Our throats are parched by the time we leave because after nothing but fresh mountain water it is hard to stomach what comes out of the tap. A quick trip to our host's grocery store across the street remedies that situation and we say goodbye to Sutton Brown with cold drinks in hand.
After an enjoyable hitch back to the trailhead we enjoy sunny hiking for several easy miles. The trail loops casually around Watauga Lake and we stop for the night at a campsite just before the dam. We relax in our tent and watch the breeze blow across the water. A storm is passing by a little too close for comfort and we can see the thunder and lightening in the mountains across the lake. The forecast warns that we may get a bit of the precipitation but we leave the rainfly off in defiance. This is a nice view for once and we can always hastily pull out the rainfly if disaster strikes.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647846,"A campsite next to a lake is really quite ideal. Besides the obvious perks of an unlimited water supply there's the relaxing nature of it all; the sun reflects off the shimmering water in the evening and morning, and the moon and stars glimmer on the gentle waves at night. It helps that the forecasted rain stays away and we sleep through a nice dry night. 
We are on the trail early with an ambitious idea to knock out our first 20 mile day. Our bodies feel good (less the normal aches and pains) and recently higher mileage has seemed to come relatively naturally. The first several miles fit this description and we stroll across the Watauga Dam and watch two men catch a fish from a small motorboat. After a short road walk we are caught from behind by an older gentleman who looks vaguely familiar. ""Remember me?"" he asks jovially, ""we met at the Happy Gnomad"". It's Smiles, back on the trail and making good time on his way to Damascus. We let him lead us up the long gradual climb away from the lake and eventually lose him to the curves and twists of the trail. 
At the next intersection we bump into Radioactive, who just finished a phone call and is ready to begin chasing after Sparky, who has gotten a head start. Radioactive has taken several zero days and displays some fresh energy as he pulls away from us as we trudge up a winding hill. We pass a slim man sporting a snow-white beard and stop to chat with ""Swedey"", who is from (you guessed it) Sweden. We leave him happily munching on a rice crispy treat, a popular choice among thru-hikers because of the weight. 
The miles pass slowly throughout the morning and when we stop for lunch it is past 1pm and we are still a mile shy of halfway. We rethink our goal and decide we're just going to hike until we run out of steam or daylight, whatever comes first. As we finish our lunch ""Safari"" passes by and says hello. He casually remarks that he is headed to our original goal and will finish at 24 for the day. Judging by the speed at which he takes off I muse that he'll definitely make it . . . and we most likely won't. 
Half a dozen miles later our bodies decide they don't want to carry our packs any longer, so we plan to stop at the next stream. The next ""stream"" is just a trickle that dabbles in slimy puddles of leaves and mud. To any off-trail civilian our situation would look thirsty and hopeless. By this time, however, I have seen how a Rhododendron Leaf can be used as a makeshift water spigot, and Checklist uses several liters of fresh spring water to make us a scrumptious Alfredo supper.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647847,"(Mountain Goat with trail magic!)It really is a marvel how far trail maps have come since the days of Earl Schaffer and Grandma Gatewood. Paper maps offer detailed information on elevation, milestones, businesses in nearby towns, and really important stuff like where the next spring/stream is. Even the paper (which is what we use exclusively) is considered outdated these days. Hikers can simply download a pdf version of the paper maps, or they can pay for an app that essentially digitalizes the trail. With all this data just a tap of the thumb away it is a wonder that hikers still have trouble knowing where they are.
That being said, we break camp this morning and walk several hundred yards to find a sprawling campsite next to the actual stream, which is a bubbling beauty that deserves every bit of its name. I feel rather foolish for spending so long at water last night and make a mental note to adjust yesterday's mileage. 
A short mile from camp we waltz into a clearing to find a tailgate full of goodies . . . Trail Magic! ""Mountain Goat"" is a section hiker who decided to try his hand at givin back. He has donuts, Slim Jim's, bananas, oranges, and Monsters. I struggle to keep myself from consuming every donut he has (an unspoken rule of hiker etiquette is to leave some trail magic for the hikers behind you) and limit myself to two of the round beauties. Half a mile later a laughing Checklist tells me that she (who arrived at the gap a minute ahead of me) consumed double the donuts that I did . . . oh the pain, oh the sorrow.
The food fuels us to burn through the miles quickly and we are making good time when we stop for a late lunch. Sensing our first 20 mile day we press on and reach the Tennessee/Virginia state line by 6pm. A late push into Damascus is tempting but we decide to settle for reasonable and stop shortly thereafter. We won't be hitting mileage like this every day, but it's nice to know we can do a big haul every once in a while.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648040,"Undoubtedly due to our long day, we both sleep soundly through the night. Early in the morning we are awakened by the sound of snow sliding off the side of our tent. Several inches accumulated while we were asleep and the woods outside of our tent have transformed into a winter wonderland. It will all be gone by the end of the day but we enjoy it as we make our way down into town. Damascus is one of the most well-known trail towns and for over a mile of trail the AT passes by stores, shops, and restaurants. Our first stop is the Post Office (which closes first) and we box up our heavy baselayers and some unused gear to send home. Radioactive is inside and he bids us good morning. He tells us that Sparky has made the decision to quit his thru-hike and go home. I understand Sparky's longing for home but am saddened to see that the familiar pair will no longer be on the trail together. 
Our next stop is a thrift store, where Checklist buys a luxury item she has just made room for: a lightweight town dress. Our bellies are starting to rumble so we head to the Damascus Diner to placate our stomachs with hot plates of food. Afterwards we cross the street to Dollar General where we resupply and agonize over what snacks to bring along this time. An older couple with down jackets and backpacks are deciding aloud whether they want two packets of peanuts or three . . . and I know they must be thru-hikers. Enquiring for confirmation I learn that they are ""Pony"" (her) and ""Hot Feet"" (him), thru-hikers who started 6 days after we did. This means our paces are similar and we leave the store knowing they will probably catch us in a day or two. 
Our backpacks are now comfortably full of food, but just a hundred yards down the street a local ministry has a table set up and is offering snacks to hikers. Undaunted by the extra weight we add some apples and protein bars to our stores. Farther along on the spacious sidewalk we bump into Deluxe and Stumbles, who greet us like old friends and ask how we've been doing. They slack-packed yesterday and will begin tomorrow well ahead of us. Still, it's nice to know friends are nearby.
Near the end of town we aim for an outfitter to check for a hiker box (this is a habit by now). Just outside the storefront I stop to help a woman load a large box into the back of her vehicle. As the deed is completed Checklist verbally admires the lady's choice of footwear, which is identical to her own except newer. After learning of our thru-hike the woman shocks us by asking if Checklist would like to take her shoes. They are indeed the same size, but it takes a moment for us to realize that this complete stranger is serious. ""I'm going to Florida so I don't really need them anyway!"" she laughs. A minute later the deed is done and our trail angel is getting in her car with nothing but socks on her feet. Checklist ties her new Altra Olympus shoes on the outside of her backpack, we'll send them home at our next resupply to be mailed back when we need them.
It is easy to linger in this friendly town and we relax at a table in Mojo's Coffeehouse with some light fare while we wait for our electronics to charge. Checklist buys a BLT to go and I pick up a footlong at the Subway next door. These will be packed up the trail and eaten tonight for supper. Eventually we get to our feet and begin the trek out of town. In the first wooded clearing a bag of goodies awaits full of more trail magic. It is difficult to refrain from buying too much food . . . it is even more difficult to keep from taking too much of what is free! Several mini loaves of banana bread and some trail mix find their way into our packs and we trudge up the mountain out of Damascus with heavy loads once again. Several miles later we pitch camp by a stream and settle down to consume some of our pack weight. Next up: The Grayson Highlands.

The chilly air does little to encourage an early morning and after I retrieve our food there is little to motivate us to further action. We huddle in our sleeping bags with the freezing wind swirling outside and eat a hearty breakfast which consists of a little bit of everything unhealthy and fattening. Checklist chops one of the apples she packed up yesterday and it makes a nice addition to our normal fare of instant oatmeal.
Eventually we drag ourselves out of our cozy cocoons and get on the trail for another day of following white blazes. The first climb is 2 miles long and is challenging enough to leave us both on the ground and out of breath at the top. Smiles comes by and is apparently doing much better than we are, so we muster up the energy to follow him for a mile or two at which point we decide it's time for lunch. We eat next to a spring-fed pond which looks like it would make a great swimming hole in the summer. This time of year we are thankful for every ray of sunshine that comes our way and we even move periodically to stay out of the shade while we eat. The next person to catch us is Radioactive, and he stops to chat while we finish up lunch. He is excited for the Grayson Highlands and is packing an apple up so he can feed a wild pony (we still have an apple left as well but I somehow doubt it will end up in any belly other than our own!). 
After lunch we walk several miles to where the AT merges with the Virginia Creeper Trail. The VCT is a bike and hiker trail that traces the route of an old railroad through Damascus. Damascus itself is a town born of a sawmill, so the VCT has a lot of history in its past. It is wide and graded and the half a mile of shared trail passes quickly. Safari passes us as we walk along and tells us that he skipped our arduous climb this morning and just followed the VCT from Damascus (saving several miles and a lot of mountain!). This is called Blue-Blazing and is frowned upon by Purists, who generally hold that a thru-hike is only a thru-hike if one follows all the white blazes. In my opinion Safari can hike however he wants and call himself what he pleases. It is his thru-hike after all. See below for some other helpful (and comedic) thru-hiker terms.
• Purists: Those who follow all the white blazes to the best of their ability.
• Blue-Blazers: Those who take side trails or shortcuts (typically marked with blue blazes) on occasion.
• Yellow-Blazers: Those who use roads to skip portions of the trail.
• Platinum-Blazers: Those who hike in comparative luxury (and with a seemingly limitless budget) by splurging on lodging, expensive resupply food, slackpacking, and shuttles.
• Pink-Blazers: Those well meaning gentlemen (usually younger men) who stumble upon a single lady and re-orient their schedules and lives to follow their new love interest up the trail to Maine.
• Brown-Blazers: Those who hike uncomfortably for a time in order to get to the next privy or outhouse.
• Nero: A day in which only a few miles are hiked (or ""nearly zero"").
• Zero: A day where no trail miles are hiked.
• Cameling Up: The act of chugging water at water sources so one can travel with less water weight (and thus a lighter pack).
• Yogiing: The act of looking and behaving as pathetic as possible around day-hikers or tourists in order to obtain some coveted free food.
Several more miles pass by and we end our day by a country road that overlooks a grassy green pasture. The gentle rolling hills are a nice change in scenery, and the open space feels comfortingly like the familiar terrain of Indiana.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648042,"Last night was a good one. Due to how our tent site is protected on all sides we get almost no wind, which makes for a peaceful sleep. The morning is another frozen wonderland however, and I have trouble persuading Checklist to leave the warmth of her sleeping bag. We begin the climb up Whitetop Mountain (Beech Mountain Rd marks the start of the climb) at 9am, but the day still feels as though it has yet to wake up. The sun peeks through the trees but does little to warm the frigid air. Temperatures today will rise to around 40 degrees but the stiff breeze will keep the real-feel well below freezing. Moving is the only way to stay anywhere close to warm, and breaks are virtually non-existent today. The summit of Whitetop is bare and rocky, the wind buffets our bodies with icy blasts, and views that would normally warrant a break get a quick glance before we head for the safety of the trees below. 
We take lunch in a grassy spot next to a road around noon. It is a nice surprise to find that the gap has trash bins and an outhouse. The latter is a concrete structure that is my best option for a windbreak, so I set up shop on the leeward side. Checklist has a better sense of smell than I do, and she chooses to stay out in the middle of our grassy patch. We eat lunch while hurling fake insults at one another about the worthlessness of our respective choices. Safari arrives at the gap and takes a seat next to me for a quick snack break. He eyes my lunch meat and sliced cheese and remarks ""that's a good idea"". ""You should try it on bagels!"" I reply enthusiastically, ""that's my favorite lunch out here"". 
No sooner has he moved on than Swedey takes his place, grumbling about the poor weather. It definitely doesn't get easier as we enter the Grayson Highlands. The area would be gorgeous in any other circumstances, but the exposed hillsides open us up to the full power of the gusts of wind. It is often difficult to keep my feet as I pick my way through the rocks and boulders coating the trail. Anytime I begin to enjoy the surrounding scenery the wind responds on cue with a blast that leaves me off balance and swaying from side to side.
Early in the afternoon we enter the Grayson Highlands State Park (GHSP) and begin catching far off glimpses of the wild ponies the park is famous for. Wondering if we will get to see one close up, I follow Checklist around a bend to see an off-white pony grazing just a stone's throw away. As we creep closer to get some coveted pictures the pony becomes aware of our presence and moseys over to us looking for a handout. The pony is only waist high and is cute enough to take home. Our new friend nudges our hands as if looking for a hidden apple or carrot.  When it becomes apparent we have nothing for it the disinterested pony moves off in search of a more disposed hiker. We move on and pass several more of the ponies grazing on the hillside. They seem at home up here in the Highlands against a backdrop of mountains, and the few pictures I take are almost magical.
Swedey passes us we struggle the last couple rocky miles to the shelter. He may have a quicker pace but his jerky movements say he is every bit as cold as we are. Pony and Hot Feet are at the shelter, and we wish them a good night before walking another tenth of a mile to a spacious campsite. I start a pipsqueak of a fire to roast our supper sausages, and we scarf them down with tortillas from the safety of our bags. After supper we zip our bags together and start to feel the warmth creep back into our bones. The forecast tells me the weather will start to warm up starting tomorrow . . . it can't come too soon.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648043,"(A four day resupply organized by B/L/D. Mine on the left, Checklist's on the right)I'm awakened early by Checklist, who dons her headlamp and retrieves our food bags while it is still dark outside. Our days as of late have been starting whenever we happen to feel like getting up. Apparently Checklist feels like getting up for the sunrise today. 
We are putting miles behind us by 7:30am. The cold air doesn't have the bite of the past few days and our brisk walk warms us up quickly (except for our noses, which stay a frosty blue). We pass The Scales, a fenced in vista so named because cattle ranchers would gather and sell cattle here. The cattle weighed more before walking down the mountain, and thus brought a better price. We do about 2 1/2 miles an hour for most of the morning (which is very good for us) and put ten miles behind us by noon. We leapfrog with Swedey, Pony and Hot Feet, and another thru-hiker named Badger who has been hiking in our general vicinity since Damascus. 
Our food bags are nearly empty and we troubleshoot our best options for a resupply. Rain is coming on Thursday (two days from now) and we would like to avoid it, but we don't want to spend the money on a zero with no ideal hostel situations nearby. We also need more food soon. We continue walking hoping a solution that pleases both of us will present itself by the time we reach Dickey Gap. A mile before we reach the parking area Checklist has an idea. ""Let's just stop now, resupply at the Dollar General up the road, and stay at a hostel tonight so we can do laundry and take showers"" she proposes, ""then we just deal with the rain on Thursday"".
I'm tired and worn out and I have my first blister threatening to explode on my left pinky toe, so a warm bed and hot shower sounds okay to me. Digging in my bag for my phone I pull it out and turn it on to find I have no service. ""Oh well"", I reason, ""I'm sure I'll get service at the gap"". 20 minutes later I'm proven wrong and we are scratching our heads trying to figure out what to do next. Swedey and Badger are both here taking a break but they don't have service either. The hostel is one way; Dollar General is the other. Shrugging our shoulders we each take a side of the road and thumb in opposite directions. Checklist unsurprisingly wins the coin toss and we ride to Dollar General in the back of a pickup truck.
At Dollar General we resupply quickly and I call the Sufi Lodge Hostel with the store phone for a free pickup. ""Do you want supper?"" the phone voice asks. ""Is it all you can eat? And how much is it?"" I ask back. ""20 dollars each, and it's just a plate, but you won't go away hungry"". I laugh at the notion that one plate of food could fill the ravenous pit in my stomach and politely decline the offer. Instead we load up on cheap microwave dinners and checkout with a loaded shopping cart. 
James, the hostel owner, pulls up as we leave Dollar General, and he spends the drive back informing us of the merits of the Sufi-sect of Islam. The hostel itself is clean and welcoming, and James' wife Suzanne makes us some scrambled eggs to go with our microwave dinners. Several other hikers are here but they will leave early tomorrow so we have our section of the house to ourselves. In our room we dump Little Debbies out of boxes and arrange the next four day's worth of food on our soft bed. I suppose it isn't much, but it looks a sight better than what we had this morning!

The first four are a father-son+friends hiking group)Mornings in a clean bed always feel extra special on the trail. The striking difference between crawling out of a dank bag and swinging my feet over the side of the bed is mind-blowing. Things that are complex chores are reduced to simple flips of switches. Instead of walking to a stream to filter water, I turn a handle. Instead of rising with the sun, I pull a cord to turn the ceiling light on. And (best part) instead of pouring water into my instant oatmeal packets, I walk out into the main living space and eat hot pancakes and eggs prepared by our host. Bacon or sausages are noticeably absent from the party (Sufi Muslims don't eat pork) but the breakfast is still fresh and filling. Soon after, James takes us back to Dickey Gap, where we get back on trail with lots of daylight left. 
We hike several miles to Trimpi Shelter, which is an appealing stone building with a fireplace. Deluxe and Stumbles were here yesterday for lunch, and Florida Man is about a day ahead as well. The sun has warmed temperatures well into the 60s, and we stretch out on the picnic table for some vitamin D. Thirty minutes later we unwillingly get to our feet and head up trail with a goal of getting to the next shelter ten miles away by dark. About an hour later while trudging along in silence we are hailed from behind by a familiar face. It's Bach, who has left a zeroing Fiddy behind in the pursuit of higher mileage. We draft on his speed and conversation for the rest of the day, and learn that he spent much of his childhood in southern Illinois just several hours west of where we live in southern Indiana. We all arrive at Partnership shelter together, exhausted but in good spirits. 
There is a small crowd of hikers already at the shelter and we meet a section hiker named Lightsaber. A thru-hiking father-son duo with a couple friends is here as well, along with a young lady named ""Chef Decker"". A large visitor center with an outside phone is several hundred yards further up trail, and supposedly hikers can order pizza from the nearby town of Marion. There is a minimum order size of $30 dollars and there is talk of ordering all together. Remembering that we are low on cash I volunteer to place the order with my credit card and take cash from people in exchange. We scribble orders on a piece of paper from Checklist's pack and I dictate the orders to the pizza place over the phone. We have no menu and have no idea what the prices are . . . but it's hot pizza so who cares. 
Inside an hour a pizza delivery car pulls up and a smiling man pulls hot boxes of pizza from insulated bags. Bach helps me carry our loot up to the shelter where I divvy out pizzas and take cash from virtual strangers. Checklist and I split a small meat lovers pizza and enjoy some of the delicious snacks we purchased yesterday. Some of my new friends gave me even bills so our pizza is essentially free. We are spending the night in the upper level of the large 16-person shelter tonight. Rain, wind, thunder, and lightening are in the forecast so sacrificing some privacy for dry gear seems to be a logical choice. The lower level gets a bit noisy as the daylight fades, and I can hear several late hikers coming in as we attempt to go to sleep. Bach has put in a 24 mile day and he rolls up in his sleeping bag next to us and joins us as we try to get some shut-eye despite the ruckus below.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648271,"(The root cellar at the Settler's Museum)A night in a shelter differs considerably from a night in a tent. Of course first and foremost is the change in societal environment. Oftentimes the quality of a shelter stay is determined solely by the company one is sleeping around: Do they make good conversation partners? Do they snore or smoke? Are they having beans for supper? Then there is the shift in one's nightly routine. The tent stays in its bag and instead one worries about protruding nails or un-chinked walls. Additionally, besides hanging a bear bag shelter dwellers typically hang their backpacks on sticks dangling from string tied to a convenient rafter. Halfway up the string sits a metal lid or plastic bottle bottom. The entire assembly is in place to keep mice from chewing into gear (or food, if one feels brave enough to risk a bear visit).
This shelter stay proves to be a good one, and we sleep somewhat soundly through the night as the rain dances on the shake roof above us. The party last night mercifully ended at around 9pm, and we are able to get enough sleep to feel rested when the sun finally shines through the cracks in the shuttered windows. We lie in our sleeping bags for a while to accomplish the dual purpose of letting the rain peter out and allowing our fellow hikers to leave.
By 10am both goals have been achieved and we begin walking with the sun warming our faces. The first several uphill miles temper our enthusiasm considerably, and by mid-afternoon we are ready for a prolonged break. We stop at the Settler's Museum, a pioneer's homestead just off the trail that includes a sprawling home and a multitude of outbuildings (root cellar, washhouse, woodshed, and half a dozen more). 
After lazily wandering around the place we hike another few hundred yards down the trail to the Lindamood Schoolhouse, another historic building with original school desks and an ancient woodstove. We open the old door to find a Trail Angel has adopted this place as a ministry to hikers. A box with bags of bars and goodies is to our left, a table with pop tarts and snacks is on our right, and along the wall are free clothes, dog treats, and first aid items. We each stuff a bag of bars in our backpacks along with a pop tart for breakfast tomorrow. Checklist adds a pair of Crocs to her load as camp shoes, and I can't resist a last-minute urge to add a 6oz bag of powdered eggs to mine. 
Several miles later we pass through the outskirts of Atkins, VA. The trail goes right by a gas station, a Mexican restaurant, and a cheap motel. We aren't stopping here, but we visit the gas station and pick up some BIC lighters while we avail ourselves of their restroom facilities. Hot Feet wanders in and says hello; he and Pony are staying at the Alpaca Lair Hostel just down the road and they are eating at the Mexican place, which doesn't serve beer . . . hence the gas station. For the life of me I can't understand why people want the stuff on trail, then again, I can't understand why people on trail want a lot of the things they want!
With our feet aching Checklist and I drag ourselves another mile before we find a grassy meadow next to a rushing creek. At these lower elevations we see sprouting Mayapple and Skunk Cabbage, and I pick some Wild Ramps from a hillside to add to our rice supper. We pitch our tent and rub our aching feet with the sounds of the not-so-distant highway in the background.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648272,"(A hilltop view in Virginia)The morning feels extra cold after such a warm day yesterday, and giving in to our desires would mean staying in our warm sleeping bags most (if not all) of the day. We savor the warmth for an hour or so after sunrise, listening to the morning birds and the occasional footsteps past our tent. The days of hiking with just a few other thru-hikers around are well in the past. The faster part of the bubble is already starting to catch us. This is inevitable, and even if we could do 20s every day (which we can't) we would still eventually be passed farther north by those doing 25s and up. Keeping all of this in the proper perspective we will continue to let our bodies decide when they need to stop and start. 
Today they (our bodies) want to start hiking at around 9:30am, so we get on the trail with a moderate goal of about 13 miles. Virgina has thus far offered a nice change in scenery, and we navigate often through grassy hills with mountains on every side. The terrain of the day proves to be difficult, and we alternate between steep uphills and steep downhills. I have found it interesting that the terrain and elevation of the trail seem to have little to do with how challenging any portion may be for any given person. When I ask other hikers what the hardest climb has been so far on their thru-hike I nearly always get a different answer. I think this is because every person is different. One person may have a particularly rough day because he/she has been slamming high miles for the past week. Another person may be mentally struggling with a situation back home and thus isn't ready for the climbs and descents of the day.
In any case, today is a hard one, and we are relieved when we finally see the outline of Knot Maul Branch Shelter (what a mouthful). Pony and Hot Feet are already bedded down at the shelter and have obviously already enjoyed dinner and a fire. We set up our tent nearby and cook a laborious meal of powdered eggs, wild ramps, sausages, and Spanish rice. Halfway through, our fuel canister runs empty and our faces fall at the thought of finishing over a fire. I head to the shelter to see if I can revive the coals of the fire there. Hot Feet is already nodding off but Pony is alert enough to grasp the situation and offer us a half-full canister. ""We still have another whole one"" she quips. We thankfully finish what proves to be a delicious supper and I wash our dishes with dried leaves as the day dims. I don't envy the shelter dwellers on days like these. Sometimes it's nice to shut out the world with the zip of a rainfly.

Even though I know the day will warm up quickly it is still hard to get up and stuff my frosty gear into my backpack. You would think at this point I would know the best way to load my backpack, but I still constantly change things in the hopes that I will hit on the magical combination that will make my pack feel lighter than it is. After several late mornings we are attempting to break the mold and get an early start. Pony and Hot Feet beat us out onto the trail but we are close behind and we catch them several miles ahead at a rippling creek. The bridge washed out (somewhat) recently so trail workers have secured a thick rope across the creek to aid in crossing. Hot Feet  apparently didn't want to take the barefoot plunge because Pony tells us he monkeyed across on the rope. I am impressed with his theatrics and consider trying it but Checklist convinces me a barefoot wade will do me good. Back at the shelter yesterday I read about a SOBO who made the crossing a month ago when the water was hip-deep and I am thankful it is only up to our calves today.
Today boasts several large hills and we launch into them in hopes that the pain will last but a second. We stop near the top of the second one for a sunny lunch next to a pond and let Pony and Hot Feet leave us for good. The day is warm, the grass is green, and the views are special! A couple ridge-top miles along the grassy lane bring us to Chestnut Knob Shelter, a fully enclosed stone cabin that used to house a fire warden. The shelter overlooks a circular valley nicknamed ""God's Thumbprint"" (Burkes Garden), and I am reminded of the valley in ""A Land Before Time"". 
We travel along the ridgeline around the valley for the rest of the day, and we stop early at a pretty little campsite that sits atop the ridge overlooking the valley. We are out of stove fuel so I build a fire and bank the coals to cook supper. Chef Decker passes by late in the day (she got behind us somehow) looking worn out by the hilly miles. I'm sure we look much the same.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648274,"(Our companion Mr. Monkey next to a morel mushroom)The Appalachian Trail is unique among its Triple Crown brothers in that it actually follows a range of mountains (the Appalachian Mountains) from the start of the trail (Springer) to the end of it (Katahdin). This means that a large majority of the trail is actually atop the ridgeline, which is perhaps why they call trail maintainers ""Ridge-runners"". This also means that sometimes it is necessary to pitch our tent atop said ridgeline, where we are completely at the mercy of the elements. Last night began in a calm and peaceful way and we drifted to sleep with the quiet stars winking goodnight. This morning we are awakened many times by the wind howling through our tent. We didn't put the rainfly on so every gust drives cold air into the cracks in our sleeping bags. We attempt to get as much sleep as possible, but finally abandon our sleeping bags in favor of the only other way of getting warm out here . . . walking.
After a windy mile or two we are grateful when the trail drops down off the ridge, and we enjoy the warmth of the rising sun without disturbance. Smiles passes us early on in the day; he spent the night up on Chestnut Knob and was thankful the shelter was an enclosed one. Next to come by is a teenage thru-hiker we haven't met yet: Slurpy. We catch him eating lunch at Jenkins shelter and follow suit by breaking out our standard tuna fare. Lightsaber rolls in and we have a young-person pow-wow that revolves around large quantities of food.
After lunch we walk in silence for a time. Suddenly, Checklist stops short and exclaims (in a tone I know well) ""Morel""! Inches from the trail is an (very) early morel mushroom with a sun-kissed top. We snap a picture with Mr. Monkey, our hiking companion who took the time out of his busy schedule to join us on this adventure. Checklist and I LOVE hunting and eating these fungilicious treats and it is such a joy to find one out here . . . I didn't think we would.
Hiking on we are caught by Fiddy, who informs us that Bach is now behind us again, having taken a quick break. The amount of leapfrogging out here never ceases to amaze me. Fiddy is trying to make US 52 to get to Bland VA, so he hikes away from us with vigor. 
Down at the next stream we have a conundrum on our hands. This is the last water source before Bland (7 miles away) and it is 4pm. Checklist is ready to stop but I convince her to load up on water  so we can dry camp (dry camping is camping somewhere with no water nearby). My idea turns out to be a poor one, as the the next half-dozen miles follow our friendly neighborhood ridgeline. We pass Slurpy 4 miles later setting up camp on a vista completely exposed to the wind. Checklist is not inclined to join him, and she passes the next several campsites, which all are reminiscent of the windy spot we stayed at last night. Tired and frustrated, we finally stumble onto an acceptable spot, where I apologize for my poor plan. I plug in our location on my phone to learn we are less than a mile from US 52. Long day.

Different joints and muscles often hurt in turn, as if the body is trying different things to see what will make us stop for the day. Whenever we do stop we hobble pitifully around camp and stumble into our tent as if half-crippled by the mere effort of moving about. During the night however, a small miracle takes place, and by morning our bodies seem blissfully ignorant of what they are about to be subjected to . . . again.
By the way we pack up this morning one would think we hadn't just hiked 18 long miles the day before. The mile to US 52 goes quickly and we arrive at the road before 9am. The Brushy Mountain Outpost greets us from its vantage point just off trail, and we open a door to a welcome rush of warm air and activity. A small amount of resupply items adorn the shelves, and a board tacked to the wall behind the counter lists a wealth of hot food just waiting to be made. I have a quick huddle with Checklist and we decide the convenience of this place outweighs the larger variety of food Bland would offer. I plug in my electronics and we order breakfast.
As we enjoy our hot food Smiles comes breezing in, followed by Lightsaber, Fiddy, and Chewy. The four thru-hikers all shared a room and are ready to get back on trail. Lightsaber is bemoaning last night's troubles; he wasn't able to get a hitch and had to walk the three miles into town. Shortly after they leave Slurpy comes in, fresh with the energy of an early morning. He surveys the stores that are now rather sparse (after our resupply) and decides aloud to go into town. We sit and relax after he leaves and wait for the lunch menu to open up so we can order burgers to go. At 10am we are hungry again so we order a plate of chili cheese fries to help us last until supper. 
Back on trail we machine through the miles and arrive at Jenny Knob Shelter with lots of daylight left. A huge pine tree has fallen on the fire pit next to the shelter and the brushy rubble is everywhere. Reading the shelter log we learn that the tree fell in the middle of the night just several days ago with hikers (whom we met) sleeping inside the shelter! Two other people are evidently here judging by the bags and pads in the shelter, but they don't seem to be around so we decide to get water. There is a blue-blazed trail on either side of the shelter so Checklist and I split ways to see which is the better option (everything's a competition). Ever the instruction-follower I choose the direction indicated by my guidebook. A fifth of a mile later the trail is becoming overgrown and difficult to find, so I do a 180 in the hopes that Checklist had better success than I did. Full water bottles indicate that she wins this round, and a quick glance reveals a babbling spring just a hundred yards down ""her"" trail. 20 minutes later two section hikers emerge from the underbrush and tell a wild story of wandering through rhododendron thickets in search of water. They went down ""my"" trail and I laugh as I show them the blue-blazed trail they didn't even see. We enjoy our burgers and then cook up some powdered eggs with the morel mushroom we found yesterday. The combination is delicious and we declare the powdered eggs a smashing success. Two thru-hikers wander in and the conversation takes a turn for the worse, so we head for our tent with the idea of an early start tomorrow.

Even if we don't end up making huge miles starting early often means ending early, which in turn means lots of relaxing lounge time at camp. We are the first on the trail this morning at 7am and we breeze through several miles before we stop for a pop tart break. The two day resupply we bought from the Outpost is rather sparse (due both to the scarcity of selection and the hefty markup of what they did have) so rationing what we have is necessary if we want to make it to the next town. If I wanted, I could easily consume all my food in one sitting, but then I would have to fast tomorrow. 
The morning is warm and delightful, and we soak it up knowing rain is headed our way in the afternoon. The trail is as flat as it has been this entire trip and we feel odd as we jaunt along miles of level ground. Water is plentiful and we cross over at least a dozen foot-bridges. The foot-bridges we've crossed thus far have had an interesting amount of variation and the ones today continue that theme. Some are just several planks across a seepage; others are a pair of logs with saw marks lacerating the tops to prevent slippage; several are well built board bridges with railing; and today even boasts the elusive suspension bridge.
We arrive at Wapati Shelter as the sky begins to open and some sprinkles hurry us as we rush to set up our tent. We make supper underneath our rainfly as the rain sets in for the night and revel in our success at missing the downpour.

The rain pours all night but other than the expected dampness, the only harm we suffer consists of a goodly amount of dirt splattered onto the side of the tent walls by the aggressive precipitation. By sunrise we are up and ready to face the day!
We make short work of the first set of miles and just before lunch I look at the time and realize we have a shot at getting to town a day early. We had planned on doing about 14 miles today, which would leave 4 left for tomorrow . . . but now it feels as though we could just get it all over with now. I pitch the idea to Checklist and by the time I explain there is a Chinese buffet waiting as a reward she is all in. The terrain is accommodating and we burn through the miles quickly. The day is beautiful and rewarding: at higher elevations we are blessed with view after view (the highlight being the Angel's Rest Viewpoint), and at lower elevations the spring flowers are beginning to explode. Bloodroot, Dutchman's Breeches, Squirrel Corn, Blue Cohosh, and Columbine are all up to say hello and their quiet glory begs us to stop and enjoy the delicate details of their radiance. Despite these temptations we make great time and arrive at the trailhead by 5:30pm. 
A quick phone call gets us a ride to the Angel's Rest Hiker House where we enjoy hot showers before strolling a mere tenth of a mile to the local Chinese buffet. Afterwards we haul our bloated bellies through the next door supermarket where we buy breakfast for tomorrow.  Back at the hostel we wander around to see who all is here and to get acquainted with all the buildings on the property. We are housing in a pleasant brick house with a shared kitchen, living room, and bathroom. Our companions in the house are South Park (who we have surprisingly caught!), Funkytown (who we haven't met), and Smiles. In the bunkhouse we find Slurpy, Lightsaber, Fiddy, and Chewy. And in a separate mobile home with its own living space and kitchen we reunite with Florida Man, Deluxe, and Stumbles, who are all hiking together and are at the tail end of a zero day. Pony and Hot Feet are evidently here as well but have already retired to a back room. We catch up with the former trio on the past week of happenings and amusedly endure a rather inebriated Fiddy before returning to the safety of our quiet brick house. After several days of somewhat solitary hiking it is nice to run into so many people we know . . . it's also nice to have a peaceful spot to call home for the night. The incoming thunderstorm won't bother us in the least . . . we'll be sound asleep in a clean bed with bellies full of General Tso's Chicken.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649026,"(Our stay at Angel's Rest)Even though we don't necessarily start hiking at daybreak every day, our bodies are still trained to wake up with the sun. This means that even in a room darkened with curtains my eyes open at around 6:30am. If I wanted I could probably drift back to sleep, but napping seems like a frivolous way to spend our second zero. The old wooden floor creaks noisily as I go from our bedroom to the bathroom, where I spend the better part of an hour enjoying an Epsom salt bath (something Checklist already did last night). When I emerge I feel rested and fresh, and I lounge in the living room and talk to Smiles, who is up and alert after a cup of coffee. Smiles lives in Maine, but has spent most of his life traveling for his consulting work. ""The new places are nice at first but travelling for work just gets old real quick"" he explains. 
The Chinese from last night has moved on and I'm hungry already, so I pop a can of cinnamon rolls in the oven for a first breakfast. South Park and Funkytown are up and getting ready to head out but they help me and Checklist polish off the batch of icing-ed goodness before they leave. Following a short intermission, we prepare a second breakfast of eggs and bacon, avocado and toast, and some fruit. The day is a wonderfully lazy affair with a few chores like laundry, gear maintenance, and resupply mixed in. The hiker pantry (differs from a hiker box in that it is a store of goods accompanying a kitchen) is full of goodies and I persuade Checklist into a supper of lasagna after seeing some noodles and parmesan cheese. We make an entire pan full (and we may or may not have a pound of green beans to go with garlic bread as well) and are wondering how we are going to eat it all when a door opens (literally). An older man named Willie Pyro is shown to his room and we ask him to help us eat our feast. Willie helps himself to a big piece of steaming lasagna and we have a conversation partner over supper. Willie is a section hiker and his flips back and forth on the trail may mean that we see him again in a week or two. He is currently headed SOBO. 
The living space here is welcoming and open, and we snuggle on the sectional in the living room and stay up long past our bedtimes to watch a movie. The day has been so zerolicious we don't want it to end . . . but sleep is inevitable, and so is getting back on trail tomorrow.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649027,"(Breakfast)Our hostel morning starts as our trail mornings can't: with a hot shower and elaborate breakfast. I say goodbye to Smiles who is getting an early start and then retreat to the comfort of what is now entirely our own space. We stuff our explosion of gear back into its rightful place in our bags and put our backpacks by the front door so we are ready to go. Checkout is at 11am and we spend the final minutes carb loading for our big day. Smiles left several pieces of pizza in the fridge from his supper last night so we pop those in a bag and bring them along. 
We get back on trail just as another couple gets off. ""Casper"" is a grinning chap from Ireland who is right behind ""Hummingbird"", a girl from Spain. We pick up where we left off and climb for what seems like an eternity to Rice Field Shelter. On the way up we are passed by ""Homer"", who I've been noticing in the shelter logs here and there for a while now. It is nice to finally meet him and we talk for as long as we can keep up with him . . . which isn't long. We find him at the shelter in his bag and ready for bed. The incoming weather has persuaded him to call it an early day. The views from the shelter are great and we can see into West Virginia from the grassy hilltop (or so we've been told anyway). 
We make another mile and a half before calling it a day at a nice campsite. No sooner do we have our chores done than the weather arrives in the form of rain, ice, and snow. The latter coats the ground with an inch or two and is a hilarious sight to our April eyes. Many people have sent winter gear home by now in favor of a warmer (and lighter) setup, and I imagine those people will struggle tonight. We are glad to still have our original sleeping bags and we spend the night firmly wrapped in their downy warmth.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649028,"(Checklist preparing for an incoming blizzard)The new day begins how the old one ended . . . with snow falling on our rainfly. The wet flakes do little to inspire us out of bed, so we mortgage the evening to spend the morning in our tent. The wintry mix peters out late in the morning and the April sun melts the inch of accumulated snow before we get all our belongings stowed away.
As we collapse the tent we are surprised to see Casper and Hummingbird pass by. Their presence can only mean they've already done almost 9 miles, which is impressive considering it's only 11am. As we finish packing up and walk the several dozen feet back over to the trail we find a new face coming up the footpath. We meet ""Cakes"" who got his trail name because his real name is John (If you don't get it, just think about it for a minute). I am rather taken aback to learn that he thru-hiked the entire trail last year. ""But why do it again? And so soon?"" I press. ""I don't know"" is the response that I've heard countless times from nearly everyone we ask. It seems that people generally know they want to hike the AT, but they typically don't know why they want to hike the AT. 
Cakes helps to pass the time with good conversation and the miles pass without excessive mental effort. We talk about things on trail (like how much water a person should carry at any given time) and things off trail (like the differences between our home state of Indiana and his of Delaware). We pull away from Cakes when he stops to eat lunch and catch up to Casper and Hummingbird eating theirs. They are getting picked up at the end of the day for another night at Angel's Rest and they are in good spirits at the prospect of a warm bed awaiting them. We learn that they share our love for cooking and relate to their story of a big DIY breakfast. We keep hiking but are passed by both them and Cakes when we stop to eat our lunch. After lunch we hike atop a ridge with good cell service so I call my dad and wish him a happy birthday. I am one of eight children yet somehow my own birthday is the only other one in our family in the month of April. I am like my father in many respects and I've always felt special to share a month of the year with him. 
As we continue on after lunch I can't help appreciating the warm sun that is now out in force. ""The day turned out pretty nice after all"" I think to myself as I begin to climb up a decently sized mountain. At the top Checklist is pointing to the west at an ominous gray blanket sweeping toward us,  ""That looks bad"" she says over her shoulder. Ten minutes later the the ominous clouds reach us and it is as if someone flipped a switch. The sun is gone, wind is whipping through our fleece jackets, and we are enveloped by a soft hail that coats the ground in minutes. We catch up to Cakes who looks as confounded as we are. Half a mile later the soft hail turns to a thick snow that is reminiscent of a wintry blizzard and I worry for the rest of the day. It wasn't supposed to do this, it's April 9th! The forecast said a 20% chance of rain!
Coated with snow from head to toe, we cross over the top of the mountain and descend only to have the snow abruptly stop. The sun is shining, and the ground that was covered in snow half a mile ago is now nearly completely free of the white frostings. ""What lunacy"" I laugh to myself as we head to the shelter at the bottom of the hill.
At the shelter we take only a quick break before moving on. Our late start means a late finish and we still have miles to cover. The last mountain is a tough one with the snow returning to discourage us, but we arrive at Bailey Gap Shelter with daylight to spare. The shelter is full of snoring hikers so we pick a spot a good bit away to tent for the night. The snow hangs around as the day turns to night and we eat supper to the sounds of a pitter patter on our tent.

If the cold doesn't go away soon I'm going to run out of ways to say we woke up to a cold morning. In other words . . . its cold this morning. The snow and ice mixture that accumulated shows no interest in melting and it remains on the ground as a visible sign of the freezing temperatures long after we begin walking. Cakes camped several miles back but got an earlier start than we did so our paths collide and we hike with him for a long while through the frosty wonderland. Our bodies are growing stronger, and the length of time (and miles) between breaks is growing steadily. At the beginning of our thru-hike we took breaks every 2-3 miles; now we can go for 6-10 at a time without needing to stop. 
We have a shelter in mind for lunch and around noon we convince Cakes to push a couple more miles to eat there with us, even though he started several miles before us. We make the shelter to see a broom taped to the signpost above a paper sign that reads: 
Sunday, April 10th
Leapfrog Cafe
0.8 ahead
Last hiker bring this sign down
Can it be true? The man named ""Fresh Ground"" who lives and feeds hikers out of his van (named ""Leapfrog Cafe"") is a legend to early thru-hikers on the trail. We have heard so much about him as we've walked. At this point we thought we would never get to meet him over a table full of his hot food and fresh ground coffee. We've barely missed him countless times; while some of our fellow thru-hikers have been fed a dozen meals at all times of the day. Ironically enough, Cakes has never seen him either, which may be why our companion gives a cry of excitement and races off down trail as if he were 30 years younger. We run down the hallways of Rhododendron and pass Casper and Hummingbird, who've stopped to filter water at a stream. Even though we continue at a frenetic pace of speed walking/running all the way to the bottom, Cakes still beats us by an out-of-sight margin. We finally round a curve to see him washing his hands at a table with wash buckets and soap. A van sits in the parking lot covered in an insane amount of stickers. Outside, Fresh Ground waves tongs from behind a table and gives us the rules for his trail magic. Wash your hands, don't go behind the cook table, and no divisive subjects. 
The menu today is all you can eat (and carry out) burritos. Nearby a cooler is full of iced drinks, and rubber maids filled with fruit, chips, and Little Debbies adorn yet another plastic table. My burritos slide down quick as I listen to the conversation around the hiker feed. Fresh Ground operates (and lives in) The Leapfrog Cafe 9 months out of the year as a non-profit business supported by past hikers and families of thru-hikers. He won't take any money from current thru-hikers because ""we may need that down the trail"" (You can donate to his nonprofit ministry on his Facebook page: The Leapfrog Cafe).
He makes gourmet food for hikers at all odd hours and often helps individual hikers who are dealing with an injury or illness. His generosity is unparalleled and he urges us to eat as much as we can hold. The inside of his van is covered in Sharpie signatures of thousands of hikers who he has fed across the past ten years, and I take a moment to sign ""Hums & Checklist, '22"" in bold red letters above the dashboard. By this time more people have filtered in and we share this surprise meal with about 8 other thru-hikers. Many of us have never met Fresh Ground before and he is excited to feed new people. Many of us have similar destinations for the day so Fresh Ground works out a common point and promises to be there to serve us breakfast. In effect he is giving us an entire day's worth of food, which will allow Checklist and I to skip a resupply point.
We sit in his comfortable folding chairs for the better part of two hours and enjoy the atmosphere of food, stories,and trail talk. After our food has settled to an acceptable level of serviceability, we leave the clearing to climb an inevitable mountain with bellies full of food. The four burritos I was able to down are heavy in my stomach, but I manage to work them off with several hard uphill miles. The second half of the day is as warm and pleasant as the first half was cold and miserable. We pass green fields speckled with cows, and birds chirp from perches in eastern red cedars. We arrive at the trailhead late in the day, and we make small talk with Casper and Hummingbird between mouthfuls of burritos that we packed over the mountain. All the hikers we had lunch with are camped nearby . . . the lure of blueberry pancakes and bacon for breakfast tomorrow is enough to bring us all together within a one mile radius.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649030,"(The Kefer Oak)I sleep well throughout the night, although camping near other hikers always means squeaky pads and snoring (I honestly don't know how people put up with the noise those new therm-a-rests make, I like my old heavy quiet one). Early in the morning I am roused by the sounds of Fresh Ground pulling in to the parking spot next to us and beginning his breakfast preparations. I spare my aching body parts the pain of moving until it is well light outside, then I poke my head out to see a small cluster of people awaiting the hot food Fresh Ground is cooking up. Breakfast consists of an unhealthy amount of eggs, fresh-fried french fries, deep-fried bacon, and the famous blueberry pancakes we've been hearing about for the last several hundred miles. 
We linger long after the other hikers leave and get acquainted with our host. Fresh Ground holds us spellbound with a fascinating story of how God called him out of a life of drugs and atheism to feed hungry hikers on the Appalachian Trail. With the other hikers around he was open and friendly, but now that they are gone he opens his heart to us about the struggles and blessings he experiences each day. It feels wonderful to share our morning bible reading with a fellow believer who is experiencing many of the same emotions we are each day. 
I make the mistake of drinking an entire cup of the fresh ground coffee so by the time we start hiking I am ready to explode with energy. I don't typically drink coffee because I have high enough energy levels without the additional boost; Fresh Ground makes his coffee extra strong and as a result the first few uphill miles are just a blur (Both the caffeine crash and those first few quick miles will catch up with me later in the day).
Early on we pass the Kefer Oak, which is the second largest on the AT at about 19 feet around. The weather is as nice as its been and I quickly strip down to shorts and a t-shirt. We walk on a ridge for a long while before enduring an ankle-wrenching descent down to a road. At the trailhead we find a pickup truck with a tailgate box and a charcoal grill. ""Alan"" is an older gentleman who hands us cold drinks and cooks us hot dogs as he makes conversation about birds, flowers, and the Appalachian Trail. He tells us that Fresh Ground stopped by and is waiting 8 miles ahead with supper and a movie. Looks like my food bag will go untouched again today!
The last climb is an absolute beast and both Checklist and I have dead legs by the time we reach the top. There is no question about what comes next, the only water in a ten mile stretch is waiting for us at Trout Creek with Fresh Ground. Pushing the agony to the back of our minds we laugh and make jokes all the way down the mountain (which presents me with my third blister of the hike). On the way down the trail dives cruelly over every single craggy knob it can find, as if to torment us further. At last comes the end of our bottomless descent, where we hobble into a hiker oasis. Fresh Ground and his van are surrounded by the tents of familiar people, and supper awaits us in the form of fresh salad and Cajun stir-fry. We set up our tent and get our chores done before dusk sets in. That done, we fill our plates with mounds of food and watch a comedy on the sheet draped over The Leapfrog Cafe (the van) until it is way past our bedtime. The comaraderie shared by all the thru-hikers in this bubble is indescribable. For the past several days we have all hiked the same portion of trail, eaten the same food, and pooped the same poop. Spirits are high as we discuss the upcoming Triple Crown of Virginia: Dragon's Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649031,"(Dragon's Tooth, Part 1 of the Triple Crown)It feels strange to not worry about what's in my food bag when I wake up. Of course I still hung the bags in a tree last night, but after retrieving them this morning I pack them away and then walk over to where breakfast is being prepared for me. I eat my fair share of pancakes and sausages, and Fresh Ground talks me into packing out the leftover french fries. Before we leave Checklist and I sing him Psalm 42, a selection from our RPCNA Psalter. ""Wow, I feel like ya'll are treating the Psalms like they were meant to be treated!"" is Fresh Ground's feedback as we bid him farewell. 
The terrain of the morning is rugged, beautiful, and unforgiving on our feet (who are still protesting the last two days). By the time we reach Dragon's Tooth we are thoroughly spent, and a long break helps revive us. We are pleasantly surprised by the emergence of Bach, who has caught us from behind after several days off trail. He climbs after me to the tippy top of the 35ft tall monolith and we sit there awhile enjoying the views into the valley below. 
The descent is challenging and slows our pace considerably, and by the time we reach the road below it is nearly 4pm. A donation based hostel called ""Four Pines"" is down the road so we decide to check it out. A vehicle pulls out of the driveway as we arrive and a man tells us to make ourselves at home. The hostel is a three-bay garage that houses (among other things) bunk beds, couches, a stove, a bathroom, several fridges, and a resident cat named Jack. The place is musty but looks like a good spot to crash for the night, so we cash our chips and spread our gear on the most comfortable couches. The shower is hot and feels great to our sweaty bodies. The man (who is named ""Sprocket"") from the driveway returns shortly with Bach, who went to a nearby town to get new shoes. 
The situation is shaping up to be a dandy one when all of a sudden things begin to go south. Sprocket is the caretaker of the hostel and lives here on what seems to be a permanent basis. He is rather loud and has a singular vocabulary that revolves around a word that pairs well with the ducks swimming in the pond outside. . . there goes peace and quiet . . . Strike 1.Then two more people come through the door in a rather bedraggled state. ""Are you coming off the trail?"" I query the duo. ""You could say that"" a long haired dude replies with a crooked grin. ""We kinda live in a van, but this is one of our home bases"" the other offers . . . looking a like a rough evening . . . Strike 2. Last but not least, a thru-hiking couple we haven't met show up. The girl is obviously sick with something that involves coughing and sneezing, and the boy mumbles something about getting off trail to help her get well . . . A night in the same room as a sick person . . . Strike 3. 
Checklist and I sit inconspicuously on a dilapidated sofa and text a conversation back and forth. Several minutes later we reach the same conclusion and get up to leave. Bach gives us a knowing glance and nods goodbye as we head out the door. It isn't until we are back at the trailhead that we begin to fully breathe the fresh clean air of the outdoors once more. The absurdity of the situation is now funny and we joke that we paid for our hot showers by enduring the degenerative conditions.  The day is nearing its end but we walk until we can't see the trail anymore before dropping our packs at a likely spot.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649032,"(McAfee Knob, Part 2 of the Triple Crown)I am positively certain that a night at Four Pines would have lacked many of the fine qualities of last night's tenting. The peace and quiet, the fresh air, and the good company all make for a pleasant nights stay at the DIY hostel on top of a ridge in the middle of nowhere. The stay even includes a DIY breakfast of oatmeal and pop tarts that is mercifully free of foul language and cat hair, and we start our day off in the right way . . . going downhill.
Midway through our day we pass the trailhead for McAfee's Knob and the hiker traffic ups considerably. Checklist has a dehydration migraine and doesn't enjoy the abundance of people, many of whom are just out for a quick day hike with smartphones and poodles in hand. We show up at the Knob itself to find an excessive amount of people all searching for the best photo spot. When the air clears a bit, I ask a kindly-looking passerby to snap a photo of Checklist and me on the edge of the classic overhang. That done, we move on to lose the swarms, both of people and of bugs (the latter now out in force because of the warm weather). 
Down at the next shelter Checklist needs a break . . . and the shelter has a thick dystopian fiction novel that looks like it might be worth a read . . . so we call it an early day (or a nero in trail talk). The sunshine is much more pleasant from a reclined position, and I laze the day away with my nose in a book. As the day matures Checklist begins to improve, so we cook a pot of mac'n'cheese and set up our tent in a grassy spot several hundred yards from the shelter. It really isn't such a bad thing to end our day here . . . we've managed to split the Virginia Triple Crown into three separate days. A much more admirable achievement (in my opinion) than cramming them all into one.

Checklist is feeling much better this morning and we hit the trail early, eager to make up for lost time. Several miles in we power up a tough climb to Tinker Cliffs, where we find several other thru-hikers who have beaten us there. ""Magnificent Monkey"" is an older man who looks to be in magnificent shape. He is currently hiking with ""Caffeinater"", a tall slender young man with long legs. The other two hikers, ""Muppet"" and ""Swerve"" also seem to be hiking in each other's company. We follow the latter two for the next ten miles into Daleville, and make good time drafting off of them. Caffeinater sets the pace in front with an audiobook in his ear, while Magnificent Monkey's chatter distracts us from our sore feet. He is a marathoner in the best shape of his life, and his talk is filled of running, fitness, and upcoming marathons. 
We make good time (typical when we stick with fast people) down to Daleville, where we all join Muppet and Swerve at the Mexican restaurant across the street. After a filling meal Checklist and I head down the road a half mile to resupply at a convenient Kroger. We stop first at the outfitter next door to pick up several pairs of lightweight socks. Our original pairs were heavyweight because we wanted to be warm in the colder February weather. After a quick shopping trip in Kroger we walk outside to see a familiar face and van. ""Hey Guys!"" Fresh Ground says enthusiastically, ""Let me give you a ride back to the trailhead"". We hop in his van and ride the half mile back to the trailhead, where he gives us cold drinks and fresh water. We shoot the breeze with him a while before crossing the busy highway to rejoin the AT on the other side. 
The last few miles go by slowly, as they tend to do. The climb is long, gradual, and has many false summits where we crane our necks to see a shelter that isn't there. Finally we climb to a point where we can climb no further, and the shelter appears at last. We sit in the shelter and let our worries melt away over a 30-piece box of mini-eclairs. A quick scan of the shelter log reveals that Radioactive is ahead of us by about a day; as are Deluxe, Stumbles, and Florida Man. Muppet and Swerve arrive just before dark and climb into the shelter for the night. As is our custom, we've pitched our tent nearby.

To make things even better as we begin walking a slight breeze keeps us from overheating. The elevation for the day is manageable, but we still decide to opt for an early lunch at a convenient shelter. I'm still carrying the 500+ page book I picked up at Lambert Field Shelter and I'm ready to get rid of it! I'm only 50 pages shy of finishing so I give Checklist a headstart after lunch and settle down in a sunny spot to finish. Twenty pages from the finish line three talkative section hikers walk up. Five minutes later and they are still asking questions excitedly between bites of Subway, unaware that this thru-hiker is more interested in his book at the moment. I frustratedly shove the book back in my bag and start walking. ""Great"" I think to myself, ""now Checklist is way ahead and I didn't even finish my book!""
Two miles later I find her sitting in a chair conversing with a familiar face with a half-gone hotdog in hand. It's Alan, who we met at VA 620 several days ago. He's birdwatching with a friend and trail magic-ing at the same time, and we are the happy benefactors of both. We kill an easy hour enjoying green beans and listening to two avid birders point out each stray bird that glides by. The section hikers arrive from behind and we give them our chairs and keep going. The trail magic is the start of the AT's long relationship with the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP), which the AT follows closely for about 90 miles. The road has many scenic overlooks and the AT often dips to the road and gives us a chance to enjoy what the occasional slow-moving vehicle can. 
Late in the day we hit our goal of Bearwallow Gap, where we find several poor campsites . . . and two foam coolers full of fruit and iced sodas. We cook supper to go with the trail magic and ponder our options. Afterwards we hoist our packs and trudge 3 more miles to Cove Mountain Shelter. We pull in just before dark at around 8pm and see a thin tendril of smoke rising from the fire pit in front of the shelter. We follow the sound of voices to find three of our favorite people roasting marshmallows over a fire. Deluxe, Stumbles, and Florida Man are all here. Deluxe and Stumbles share a bag of marshmallows and we catch up on the events since we last met up at Angel's Rest. I'm starting to feel sleepy and happy after a fourth marshmallow when Checklist suggests we keep going. There is a swimming hole three more miles away that provides an ideal situation for a moon-lit dip. The moon is full, my belly is happy, and my feet feel surprisingly fine. We laughingly say goodbye (for now) to our friends and don headlamps for a bit of night hiking. 
The miles in the dark feel otherworldly and strange after so many days of quitting before dusk. Our headlamps bounce from rock to rock as we try to avoid the roots and stones that leap up to trip us from the darkness. Finally, we cross a road and pitch our tent in the darkness next to the anticipated swimming hole. The water is icy cold but feels refreshing after a long day, and our day ends with the moon chasing us into bed.

Getting up in the morning is a little harder after two 20+ mile days. Our young bodies are doing a fantastic job of healing each night but even youth can't make up for such big miles. It doesn't help that the upcoming miles boast over six thousand feet of elevation gain. By the end of the day we will be over three thousand feet higher than our campsite at Jennings Creek. The first few miles go by slowly and we take an early lunch at Bryant Ridge Shelter, which is a massive two story building with a covered porch and a view. On this episode of ""What's for Lunch"" I've brought a Betty Crocker chocolate chip cookie dough dry mix, and I add some butter and water to form a sticky dough. The first few bites taste amazing, just like the bits from the mixing bowl at home. Somewhere between serving number 3 and 6 the once brilliant idea is revealed as a poor life decision, and I finish the last few bites in a miserable silence. 
Florida Man shows up to cheer our day, and is followed shortly by Deluxe and Stumbles. We finish our lunches and attack a massive climb as they open their food bags. I give Checklist a ten minute head start before chasing after her. Five hard uphill miles later I struggle into a shelter to find that Checklist has just barely beaten me there. She's getting faster, maybe I'd better reduce the handicap time to five minutes from now on.
We trudge further on up more elevation gain and finally conquer our last beast of hill to find an outdated FAA tower at the top. The breezy wind stands in nice contrast to the warm sun, bluebirds and a bunny rabbit provide the ambiance, and soft green grass invites us to linger longer than we should. We are roused from a sunny doze to see Cakes hiking by. He is putting in a long day and seems glad to see us again. We follow him down the hill and underneath a rock called ""The Guillotine"" to an overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway, where we find Fresh Ground making chicken tenders and fries. After half an hour of nutritional bliss Florida Man, Deluxe, and Stumbles all join us again, this time for supper. This is only the second time the latter two have seen Fresh Ground, and Deluxe's permanent grin gets even bigger as he downs several plates of chow. After supper Fresh Ground plays us classic music hits and we try to guess the artist as we wash dishes together.
The overlook doesn't have any tent sites, so after a projector movie that we only barely manage to stay awake for, we all pitch our tents in any odd spot. Cakes disappears into the woods, and the rest of us take up residence on the narrow (and uneven) strip of grass surrounding the parking lot. There is no way a park ranger would let us get away with this, but you got to do what you got to do when there is the promise of blueberry pancakes in the morning.

Several vehicles pass our makeshift camping site in the night but either they are not park rangers or they simply don't know about the tent party nearby. Just to be on the safe side the first thing we do in the morning is pack up our tent and make our backpacks ready for departure. Fresh Ground is up and clanging pots and pans merrily, it's Easter Sunday! The day we celebrate Christ's resurrection, and ultimately our salvation. Fresh Ground takes care of business first, and feeds us the classic breakfast we've come to love. Afterwards he reads a a chapter from John and says a few thoughtful words about what exactly we (Christians) celebrate on Easter. A random diversity of religions/faiths/understandings are represented by the people clustered around his van, but this morning we are content to love one another and respect what Fresh Ground is doing for us. Checklist and I are asked for another Psalm-sing so we add the beautiful words of Psalm 121 to the beauty of the day. I am so thankful for the people we get to share this special morning with.

After breakfast Cakes rushes off in anticipation of his upcoming hostel stay in Glasgow. Several minutes later Homer walks in (behind us after several zeros) and polishes off six eggs. The rest of us still in the parking lot talk about our day and decide we are all headed for the same place. Glasgow has a free hiker shelter in the middle of town that has electricity, cold showers, trash cans, and proximity to a grocery store.

The rest of the day we travel in a loose pack with Florida Man, Deluxe, and Stumbles. I hike with Florida Man for several hours and we talk about fishing, kayaking, Florida (obviously), and anything else that will help pass the time. Mileage goes by so much quicker when there is an interesting conversation to keep me occupied. At the last shelter before town we meet a day-hiker who offers to hike out with us and take us into Glasgow, so we now don't have to worry about hitching! It turns out we wouldn't have had to anyway because Fresh Ground is waiting at the trailhead to shuttle people into town. We all end up at the free hostel to find Homer has beaten us by an hour of so. I take advantage of the free shower but don't linger in the cold sprinkle from the outdoor showerhead. 

Fresh Ground originally was not planning to cook tonight but he has come up with an ingenious proposition. ""I'ma let ya'll cook tonight"" he beams. There are six of us at the shelter tonight but only three of us are comfortable with taking the reigns of Fresh Ground's operation. Checklist and I offer to do the cooking tonight if Deluxe will head up tomorrow's breakfast. Fresh Ground walks me and Checklist through his setup and gives us freedom to make whatever we want with his ingredients. I slice chicken and chop veggies as Fresh Ground talks Checklist through a cold pasta salad from the comfort of a chair. We saute our fajita mix and fry buttered tortillas with cheese, and we have a delicious hiker supper. I'm no Fresh Ground, but now I can say that I've cooked for him . . . with his own system! 

After supper we all work together to cleanup and then sit around a fire that Homer has lovingly tended. A movie plays in the background as we talk about life. Homer, Florida Man, and I are the late crew tonight. We stay around the fire and play ""avoid the smoke"" until we can't keep our eyes open. I genuinely like the people we are traveling around currently and it is a pleasure to get to know them better. The AT has a way of bringing people together and helping to cut through the small talk. We can (and do) discuss anything and everything around the fire. It's freeing to know that I can be myself without fear of being judged or reprimanded. We are all out here for different reasons, but we are brought together by what we are doing . . . and by the craziness of what we are doing. I go to bed bleary-eyed but overwhelmingly happy with how Easter has gone.

Where I live in southern Indiana the weatherman is wrong as often as he is right. Hoosiers get used to a wide range of weather throughout the year at unpredictable times. Despite this background, I have been nothing short of amazed at the constant variance in weather on our thru-hike. Although I tend to complain about the rainy and snowy days, we have in fact been fortunate with the weather thus far. We haven't yet walked in the pouring rain all day, we haven't had to endure a week of wet clothes, and the few snowstorms have always been followed closely by warm weather. However, the speed at which the weather (and the forecast for said weather) can change is unbelievable, especially at high elevations. Yesterday was as nice a day as we could have asked for, but today is a COLD day that starts with a mixture of heavy rain and sleet. From the comfort of our sleeping bags we plan to leave in the late morning, but on the way to Dollar General we decide to abandon hiking for the next 24 hours. The conditions in Glasgow are bad enough, to say nothing of what they could be several thousand feet up. Besides, we have a free place to stay, fun people to hang out with, and a grocery store and library within walking distance.
Deluxe and Stumbles do the lions share of the breakfast cooking, and we get back from Dollar General in time to finish off the goodly amounts of what's left. We all seem to be suffering from the ugly conditions and everyone walks around slightly on edge. Even Fresh Ground is ready for a break, and as he packs up he declares his intentions to take several days off from feeding hikers. We are all glad he is taking some time off. He needs it, and we have had more than our fair share of trail magic the past few days. 
After he leaves everyone goes their separate ways to recharge and endure the cold rain. We walk down the street to the quaint small-town library, where we browse through books and halfheartedly start a puzzle. The warmth soon begins to sink into our chilled bodies and makes us drowsy enough to put away the puzzle and return for the comfort of our sleeping bags. The early afternoon passes as we doze in the safety of our tent. Eventually the sound of voices and the crackle of a fire bring us back to the shelter where we find Homer, Deluxe, Stumbles, and Florida Man all crowded around a small smoky fire. The rain finally stops and takes with it the awkwardness and misery of the morning. The trail (and now this campfire) has brought us all together in a special way. Boundaries are down and we discuss a wide range of topics throughout the evening. Inevitably we all get hungry again and make trips back to the store to satisfy random cravings. We roast several packs of hotdogs over the fire and get ice-cream (as if it isn't cold enough) to quiet our sweet tooths. At one point I look up to see Homer contentedly munching on a raw hotdog between sips of a bottle of wine . . . priceless.
All good things must come to an end, and Checklist and I retire to our tent when the last of the dry wood is gone and nothing but a green box elder log remains. From the tent I hear a burst of laughter, and I come back to the gathering to find that everyone is passing a bottle of lighter fluid around in attempts to ignite the stubbornly wet log. I take my turn being a pyromaniac and then return to my warm bag . . . this time for good.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649412,"(Ice on branches atop of Bluff Mountain)This is the first time we have camped in the same place for two nights in a row. Yesterday was a very inexpensive zero, but it also feels weird to wake up in the tent to the same surroundings as yesterday. After over two months of constant change, familiarity of environment is what feels bizarre. 
This third zero has also made us restless, and we are up early this morning anxious to be back on trail. The morning is bitterly cold, and we seek the warmth of Dollar General with the excuse of buying lunch. With food in hand we head across the street and try our luck at hitching. We must have missed the going-to-work traffic because the vehicles passing by are sporadic and sparse. After about twenty minutes we decide to start walking down the road. No matter that the trailhead is six miles away, we have to get there eventually!
Thankfully, a pickup truck stops in the road several hundred yards later and a kind man gives us a ride back to the trailhead. Back on trail we feel sluggish and out of shape. We muster only a mile before we stop and eat a premature lunch. The food provides some much needed energy that propels us up several successive mountains; the last of which, Bluff Mountain, looks out over the hills below. This high up, yesterday's rain has turned to ice on the tree branches, and we walk by frosty boughs bending with the added weight. The sun is now out and is rapidly causing the sheaths of ice to lose their grip on woody branches. As a result, ice falls from the treetops in great showers of large chunks. I hurry through the area slightly perturbed at the size of some of the falling pieces, albeit in amazement at the spectacle.
Late in the day we catch a second wind and decide to hike until dark to get some extra miles in. At around 6:30pm we stop to prepare for a final push. While we relax a spry woman with short gray hair and a sparkle in her eye appears from behind us. She stops to talk and we find a new friend in ""Monarch"". Monarch is outgoing and easy to talk to, and we quickly feel as though we are just old friends out for a stroll. She has been hiking alone for several days and is glad for some company, so we walk together for the remaining hours of daylight. The lack of light persuades us at last to set up our tent by a frolicking stream on its way down the side of a mountain. Monarch camps across the stream from us and we all do our camp chores in the dying light of day. It is good to put in a full days work after time off . . . this trail really does behave like a job sometimes.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649413,"(Monarch &. Checklist taking a break at Cole Mountain)We're up early on this crisp April day. Monarch's tent is still so we pack up and start hiking alone with our thoughts and each other. The birds chirp a cheery song as we hike in the morning quiet. Early on, the trail climbs 2500 feet up Bald Knob (which isn't actually bald). The four mile ascent leaves us exhausted and in need of sustenance, in the form of an early lunch. As we finish eating Monarch catches us from behind with the ease of an experienced hiker. We hike with her down and up to Cole Mountain, which is bald. The three of us sprawl on the grass and enjoy the views and the sunshine for several long minutes.
We're out of water, and the next water source is 1.4 miles ahead. Unfortunately, said water source is 0.3 miles off trail, a mini-marathon for a thru-hiker (when he isn't on trail that is). I offer to speed ahead and fill all of our water bottles to save time. The women accept and I speed off with the competitive juices flowing strongly in my bloodstream. I arrive at a road crossing and see a sign indicating the spring is half a mile off trail. ""What!"" I think to myself, ""I'll never beat them back if I have to go an extra mile!"". A hurried glance at my guidebook reveals I am premature by several hundred yards, so I sling my pack to my shoulders and scurry ahead without bothering to connect the hip straps. When I get to the sign marked ""water 0.3"" I drop my pack and run down the grassy trail with water bottles in hand. Several long minutes later I walk quickly back to the intersection with bottles now full. Checklist and I show up at the same moment, and my face flushes with triumph. Sadly, there are few congratulations for the conquering hero, and the women (although thankful) seem to take more interest in the cool water than they do in my labors. 
We hike with Monarch until her endurance shows itself superior to ours, at which point she hikes on while we take a break. Half a dozen miles later we stop at the shelter to find she has hiked on. An abundance of people are here however, and we meet a young male thru-hiker named ""Gazelle"" who is impatient to reach Harper's Ferry still 200 miles away. Funkytown and South Park are the last two to get to the shelter tonight; we learn they took several zeros after Funkytown's knee started bothering her. Tired and worn out after a day of ups and downs, we muster the strength to start a fire to roast some brats before we climb into our tent for the night.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649414,"(Views from Spy Rock)Typically I don't set an alarm on trail. Perhaps because the sun does a good job of waking us up; or maybe because we're so tired at the end of most days we don't want an early morning looming over our heads. However, sometimes it is worthwhile to set an alarm, like the night before we plan to do big miles. Such is the case with today, and my vibrating alarm (all I need in the quiet of the woods) goes off at 5:30am to let us know it's time to hike. Problem is . . . we don't feel like hiking this early, so a series of snoozes delays our wake-up. Finally the sun lets us know we need to get moving, and we rouse ourselves in time to get out of camp at a decent hour. 
Several miles in we see a sign notifying us of an outlook called ""Spy Rock"" just 0.1 miles off trail (an acceptable range for a thru-hiker). I am ready to push on but Checklist insists we take the time to see the sights. A few minutes later I am thankful she pushed for the break. Spy Rock is a gem that primarily looks north, although there are views in every direction. Several indentions in the rock have filled with water creating a picturesque scene. 
After our break we power through several miles and pass some section hikers and SOBOs (people heading south, or southbounders). There are also several Flips hiking north with us (Flips typically start somewhere in the middle and then jump forward or backward to finish the part they left, typically this is done for weather or convenience purposes), and we meet Koolaid (who doesn't like Koolaid), and Camel. 
We stop at Priest Shelter for a pre-lunch break and spend some idle time perusing the shelter log, which hikers famously use as a confessional. The entries range from hilarious to relatable to explicit, and we add some confessions of our own before moving on.
By the time we stop for lunch we are nearly at the bottom of a long descent . . . which means a long ascent is coming up. Invariably the AT goes down just to come back up again. This particular 8 mile ascent looks miserable, and we start hiking with some trepidation. Halfway up Checklist gives me our tent poles so I can have the tent set up by the time she gets to the shelter for the night. The climb is worse than I ever could have imagined, and at some points I stop simply to gape at the sheer audacity of the trail builders. At Chimney Rock I climb up rock steps that are steep enough to make me lean forward to prevent falling over backward. By the time I reach Maupin Shelter it is late in the day. Monarch arrived shortly before I did, as did Gazelle. Another thru-hiker named ""Thunderbird"" is here at the end of a 30 mile day. He is hiking with Magnificent Monkey, who I passed on the way up (MM left Caffeinater behind to deal with some shin pain). Magnificent Monkey pulls into the shelter as I finish setting up the tent; he is feeling every bit of his 30 mile day and vows loudly to stop hiking with Thunderbird (who is 19) and go back to his 20 mile days. We cook supper at the communal picnic table and discuss the day's hardships. We all agree this climb was one of (if not the)  hardest on this entire hike. ""Why does no one talk about this climb up to Three Ridges Mountain!"" opines Thunderbird loudly. We all nod our heads in agreement; no one warned us of the true challenge of this beastly mountain. 
As we are lost in the throes of woe Checklist arrives. I am surprised to see she is in good spirits, and I am suddenly filled with a strong sense of pride in my wife's abilities. She has hiked over 20 miles today in some of the hardest terrain thus far, but she beams a genuine smile and joins the conversation at the picnic table over supper. Once the meal is over we all retire to our individual spots for the night to try and get some energy built back up for tomorrow . . . which ideally won't be as bad as today.

We are just now beginning to knock out large mileage days back-to-back. This means we are still figuring out what exactly our bodies can currently handle. This morning when I roll out of bed I can feel the aches from yesterday still resonating in my body. We are low on food however, and have already booked a room in Waynesboro, so doing another 20 today is already in the cards. A valuable lesson is learned before we even start hiking: ""If you don't want to be forced into rigid plans, don't make them"". 
Several easy morning miles roll by and we round a bend to see Fresh Ground waiting with breakfast. Gazelle, Magnificent Monkey (or MM, as he is often called), and Thunderbird are already here; and Monarch arrives just after we do. We all enjoy blueberry pancakes together and agree to take the miles slow and easy. Thunderbird quickly leaves us behind, but the rest of the group stays loosely together for the majority of the day. I am able to spend time hiking and talking individually with everyone, and the miles pass easily under the umbrella of chatter. 
After a short lunch break just past the halfway point the group begins to disperse a bit. Checklist and I fall behind but catch the others at the last shelter before town. Two other thru-hikers are here: ""SpacePants"" and ""Waffles"". A military event in Waynesboro has left little in the way of lodging, and our companions are scrambling to find vacancy. Monarch is first to succeed and announces she has found a room with the same hostel as us. SpacePants and Waffles find a King Suite in a hotel and hike off ready to sleep like royalty. MM and Gazelle are last, and have to settle for a smoking room in a nearby inn. Checklist and I linger at the shelter after the others have gone. When we do start for town we go slow and take our time. About a mile shy from town I am walking behind Checklist with my eyes on the ground when I hear a loud noise to my right. Turning quickly I see a large black bear about 30 ft away running over small trees and thickets in its attempts to get away. ""Finally! Over 800 miles without a bear and I actually get to see one while hiking! If only it was a bit closer"".
We get to the trailhead by 6:30 (fairly decent for a 20+ mile day) and call the hostel for a shuttle. We enter the hostel to find Cakes at the tail end of a zero. He seems happy to see us again and pays us the ultimate trail compliment by giving us his number. The place is rather hectic but at last we are able to check in to our room in the house across the street. Monarch joins us for supper at a nearby Hardee's and we tell each other our highlights of the day. Seeing the bear is at the top of my list, followed closely by hiking with people I like. Back at the hostel we flop in our bed and make plans for a (mostly) restful day tomorrow.

Our room in the house is on the small side, but at the end of the day,anything that isn't a smelly sleeping bag feels like luxury. One problem we have with hostel stays is getting enough sleep. The sleep we do get is often rich and refreshing, but we always get up early to make the most of every minute. This morning I wake up to see a note from Checklist on the pillow next to me. She has gone to Walmart (conveniently just down the street) for breakfast ingredients and will return shortly. I wander downstairs and try out the massage chair in the living room. It is a cheap model but I crank it up to full blast and it feels great on my back.
When Checklist returns I do the cooking and make croissant sandwiches with a side of fruit. Monarch takes a turn at the stove when I'm done and sits down at the table to eat breakfast with us. She wants to keep hiking around the group from yesterday but has to take two zeros to meet a family member. She has already sectioned all but the last several hundred miles of the AT and is struggling with the thought of the section coming up. ""I don't know . . . maybe I should just go home and finish up north in a couple months"" she waffles. While we enjoy her company we also emphasize with her plight. We've often discussed a scenario where we had to get off trail due to injury or an emergency back home. If we did have to leave we most certainly would not start over; rather, we would just pick up where we left off.
After breakfast we walk back over to Walmart where we resupply for the next four days. I always struggle to pick out the few treats for the next handful of days. Whatever I pick needs to have the power to motivate me over tough climbs and give me energy to endure the long days. This time around I settle on a can of Pringles, a bag of turtle Chex mix, and a 16 pack of chocolate rice crispy treats.
On our way back to the trail we stop by the outfitter for a fuel canister. Unfortunately, a shortage has left them empty-handed, and our only option is several partially filled canisters from their hiker box. More weight, more space, and more trouble. The Blue Ridge Parkway transitions seamlessly into The Skyline Drive at Rockfish Gap so today marks the start of our foray into the Shenandoah National Park (SNP).We don't start hiking until 4pm, and the sun makes us feel slow and sluggish.  We pass up several early water sources and campsites, and as a result have to push late in the day to get to a shelter. When we reach the 0.3 side trail to the shelter Checklist suggest we go to the next water source to avoid walking an extra half mile. I agree and we walk on in the dimming light. We pass underneath power lines that are dancing and crackling their way down to Waynesboro, and I snap a picture as the light disappears from the horizon. A little while later we find a campsite next to a babbling spring and call the day done.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649719,"Camping next to water is ideal in many ways. First, we need not worry about if we have enough water for the night/morning. Second, we have running water to wash our hands and our dishes. Third, we have a place to soak our sore feet and cool off from a hot day. And fourth, the running water provides the background music for a good night's sleep.
This morning I feel extra grateful for a luxury like this because my guidebook shows no water sources for the next 12 miles. As a result, we start hiking with full loads of water that make our packs feel extra burdensome. Today is my 23rd birthday, and as we start off I have in mind a 23 mile day to celebrate. My stomach has other ideas however, and we haven't made it far when I start feeling rather ill. The hot air of the 85 degree day does little to improve my plight. The miles pass by slowly and I have to unclip my hip-belt often (leaving the weight on my shoulders) to keep the nausea at bay. 3 miles in Checklist tells me I look terrible . . . I look how I feel. My wife is inevitably more gracious to me when I'm sick than I am to her when it's the other way around. She suggests we get off trail so I can spend my birthday in as much comfort as possible. At the shelter prior to Waynesboro there was a sheet with a list of trail angels in town who give free rides to hikers. I had the foresight to snap a picture so now I work my way down the list until I find a generous angel willing to make the hour round-trip drive to pick us up and take us back into Waynesboro. We get a room at Days Inn, where we can flip a switch for air conditioning, and I can collapse thankfully into a soft bed. Bach and Homer are both here as well; they seem to have become hiking buddies for the time being.
It's only just past noon, so we have a lot of time to savor the space. Monarch is now staying in a Comfort Inn down the street, and Checklist walks over for a visit while I look for something to distract me on the big screen. Since we've been on trail we have found it difficult to keep our eyes on a screen for long, especially if it's a full length movie. After the slow moving intricacies of the outdoors I suppose the quick pace of a film is just too much stimulation. 
Late in the day I begin to feel much worse, with pains in my lower stomach that are only slightly alleviated by repeated dips in a warm bath. Homer and Bach are courteous enough to walk with Checklist to a nearby gas station so she can get me some antacids and Tylenol. Around 11pm the meds kick in and the pain lessens enough for me to get comfortable. Hoping and praying for a better day tomorrow.

Thanks to trusty old Tylenol I sleep soundly through the night with no noticeable pain. In the morning I turn over gingerly expecting an onslaught of pain . . . nothing. Thank goodness, Homer was tossing the word ""Appendicitis"" around last night and I was going to pieces at the thought of leaving the trail for a surgery. The fact that there is no pain this morning is an answer to prayer. It also means we can get back on trail today!
I feel normal enough to join Checklist at breakfast, where I enjoy the luxury of orange juice (with pulp). Around checkout (11am) we call our trail angel, Tom; and he nonchalantly tells us he'll be at our hotel in ten minutes. When he arrives he has a surprise for us: two Reece's Peanut Butter Cups. The Cups hold a special significance because Tom spent his entire career aiding their production. He worked at the original Hershey chocolate factory under Milton Hershey, and when the company opened a plant in Waynesboro he moved to be the plant manager. The plant is now the company's second biggest, trailing only the production facility just outside Hershey VA. 
It is fascinating to learn about the history of something I've only read about by talking to someone who was directly involved in that history. I am thankful for the opportunity to meet such an interesting person, even if it came at the temporary cost of my health. 
Back on trail we find the terrain exceptionally easy, and we wind up at Black Rock Hut at 4:30pm. After taking a nice break we cruise down the treadway until we run out of daylight.

Many of the books I read before hiking the AT lead me to believe in the efficacy of a schedule. It sounded so wonderfully disciplined to wake at the same time every day; hike for the same amount of time every day; and make the same amount of miles every day. Reality, however, has painted a much different picture. There are many variables: how one responds to the differences in elevation and difficulties of terrain, time for the body to recover, etc. Furthermore, when you multiply these things by two it becomes rather difficult to follow set patterns. She wants to push for a few more miles when I am nursing a blister; that last steep hill destroyed her energy but did little to hinder mine; she feels great but I am sick; and so on and so forth.
This morning we paint the very picture of inconsistency when we rise at 5am,  completely contradicting our bodies' normal 6:30am wake time. Early miles pass slowly as though we are hiking in a mental haze. As the sun rises higher in the sky we become more attentive to the world around us. The wildlife is very active in the Shenandoahs this time of year. We see countless squirrels, deer, a variety of interesting  songbirds, and several terrified bunnies who freeze with petrified fright as we walk by several feet away. 
Our warm sunny day vanished around 1pm and is replaced by a steady rain that feels cold on our sunburned appendages. We hurry through an hour of the precipitation before seeking refuge at Hightop Hut (Shelters are called ""Huts"" in the SNP). We curl up in our sleeping bags and munch on snacks while the rain tinkles on the metal roof above us. An hour passes and we pack up and head into the drizzle, which has now lightened up a bit. The last few miles are a soggy mud-fest, and we arrive at South River Picnic Area to find the water source (a pump) has been pronounced contaminated.  I wonder if the proximity of the pump to the outhouse (about 10 feet!) might have something to do with the situation. It's too late to push on so we find a stealth spot in the woods nearby. We have enough water to last the night, but we will have to walk several miles for breakfast tomorrow morning. When I get home, the convenience of food from the fridge will make me feel like a king.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650089,"(A typical lunch setup)We awake early but sleep in late on this chilly morning. Our zero degree bags still feel great and we treasure the comfort they provide until we can't ignore the time any longer. We begin around 9am feeling rested and ready for another day. The recent warm weather has left us both suffering from a second round of blisters, but we hike in step to the cadence of discomfort. 
The late morning has the upside of an early lunch at the first shelter we come to, just 6 miles in. I polish off my lunch AND the last of my snacks and still am rather ravenous. Checklist feels the same way so we make a supper of mac'n'cheese and hot chocolate. Satiated, we hike on through the manageable terrain of the Shenandoahs. Our pace fluctuates throughout the day but is often around 3 miles an hour. The speed comes mostly with the aid of Homer and Bach, who catch us from behind in the early afternoon and provide a means for quick miles. They are fun hiking companions, and when they take a detour to the Big Meadows Lodge for some food we follow on their heels. 
The Lodge is just off trail and has a restaurant, taproom, and lounge. The restaurant prices are way out of our league so we follow the boys downstairs in hopes of cheaper food. It is Homer's birthday and he quickly opens a tab and begins downing beers at an astonishing rate; evidently he means to celebrate in style. Checklist and I decide to split an order of pulled pork sliders and a side of fries. When the food is brought to our table I am left in a bit of a shock. Our $15 dollar sliders are a pair of sorry half dollar sized bites that look to small to be sandwiches at all. If I wanted to I could fit the entire meal in my mouth all at once! 
Disgruntled at the outrageous prices we dip our fries in as many different (free) dipping sauces as possible while we watch our friends munch on wings. Bach and Homer plan to stay until the bar closes at 9pm, so we bid them adieu and get back on the AT for a few more late-day miles. We make it to the next shelter before dark and greet a kind man snuggled in a sleeping bag with a small dog. Setting up our tent is an automatic process by now, and we let our hands do the work while our eyes enjoy the sunset.

Despite our objecting feet we start hiking at 7:30am determined to get a bunch of miles out of the way. If we are able to average 19 miles over the next three days we can take a zero before Harper's Ferry. 
The first few miles pass in a blur and before we know it we are passing the Skyland Lodge. With the overpriced sliders from yesterday in our minds we decide to give the place a try anyway. The lobby is welcoming but we only have eyes for the the counter filled with food. We settle on four Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches and two large cookies. The employees tolerate our presence and let us heat up our sandwiches in a nearby microwave without protesting. We sit nearby in the empty (closed) taproom and eat our snack while we observe the wealthy tourists in the dining room below. Checklist actually grimaces as she watches waiters take half finished plates of food back to the kitchen to be thrown away. ""If I slipped a server a five they could just bring all that to me"" she vocalizes half seriously. 
We resume our day and walk in silence for several hours. The first interaction I have is headed up to the Pinnacle, where I meet a day hiker named Rob. Rob's wife is waiting for him on the other side of the mountain, and he still has plenty of food, so he donates two hard-boiled eggs to our dwindling food supply. When we all get down to the parking lot he fills our water bottles while his wife offers us two more of the Skyland cookies. Sad to say, the cookies are half gone before our friend-for-the-day has even pulled out of the parking lot.
The cookies make good fuel and help propel us several more miles en route to a long day. We pass a patch of late-season ramps and pick a large quantity to add to supper. We only take the tops, that way the bulbs are still intact for next year's supply. The next spring becomes our supper spot, and we wilt the ramps with butter to go with some instant couscous. The latter sits heavy on our stomachs as we trudge the last few miles of the day. The sun also inconveniently goes down and leaves us to walk in the dark with the lonely flicker of our headlamps. We call it a day at a small stream and muster up just enough energy to set up our house for the night.

It is absolutely agonizing to wake up to a cold day with lots of miles in the forecast. Once we get walking it isn't quite so bad, but that initial jumpstart is always difficult for us. After a big (and late) day yesterday we are especially prone to some dragging of feet in camp this morning. To help speed things along we postpone breakfast until after the first big hill. This strategy is effective but it leaves us talking longingly about food the entire 6 miles up and over the Hogback. By the time we stop at Gravel Springs Hut our stomachs are growling in anguish. I robotically look in the bear box (a metal container for overnight food storage) for food left by other hikers, something I've done automatically since we hit the Shenandoahs. I haven't yet found anything but the boxes remind me of treasure chests and I can't resist checking them out. This time there is a grocery bag with some oatmeal packets and a Backpackers Pantry pouch. The pouch is still sealed, and it is a Dark Chocolate Cheesecake Dessert. We add cold water and make a huge pot of oatmeal while we wait for the treat to be ready. It is positively delicious and is easily one of the tastiest things I've eaten on trail. Following lunch we pass a sign marking the northern boundary of the Shenandoah National Park. We have enjoyed the SNP but it feels great to put another milestone behind us.
The boost of calories from lunch helps the next 6 miles go quickly, and we skip lunch with our eye on the prize 7 more miles ahead. Mountain Home is a luxurious B&B mere steps off of the trail that offers pizza, ice cream, and lodging to passing hikers (or so we've heard). We make the road crossing around 6am and walk the short distance to the towering mansion of a home, which looks like a grand old building from the colonial times. We find a small group of hikers on the back patio enjoying the evening. One is sitting in front of a pizza with only a piece missing, and he invites us to help him finish it off. Checklist heads straight for the table in an end-of-the-day daze while I head inside to find the proprietors. I kind lady who introduced herself as Lisa greets me and asks if I want pizza. I glibly request two more along with a pair of Haigan Daaz pints. I then check the hiker box to find more than enough food to last us the next several days (which is all we need). Finally I step back outside and help Checklist polish off the pizza of our new friend, who is a hiking enthusiast named ""Woofy"". Also here are a pair of section hikers named ""Livin' the Dream"" and ""Shhh"", and two thru-hikers named ""Tree-hugger"" and ""Happy Feet"". The latter duo started their thru-hike after we did but somehow passed us recently without our knowledge. They are about 20 miles ahead and just shuttled backwards for a day off. 
It is wonderfully pleasant to sit and listen to random chatter while eating pizza and ice cream. Lisa comes out and joins in the mayhem with all the friendliness of a truly invested hostess. She takes breakfast orders from the B&B guests with the grace of someone honestly interested in pleasing visitors. She and her husband Scott (Possible) run this entire operation by themselves, even in the heart of the season when they are fully booked. 
It is hard to pull ourselves away from this attractive place, especially when Woofy pulls us aside and loads us up with goodies from the back of his car. But, the B&B is fully booked and there is no logical place for us to go except back on trail, where the lodging is free and the bears are friendly. We don't make it far before crashing at a decent campsite next to a stream; it has been an amazing day filled with trail magic and memorable experiences but at the end of the day all trails lead into bed (or bag).

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650092,"(The Jim & Molly Denton Shelter)Following several long days we are both lacking in the R&R category, so this morning we sleep in late and enjoy the crisp morning air from inside the tent. Cold pizza is a nice change from our usual instant oatmeal breakfast. We are headed for a rendezvous 33 miles away at Snickers Gap tomorrow (more on that later) so we have some flexibility with the miles today. We don't start walking until after 9am, and even then our pace is nonchalant and relaxed. We catch up with Livin' the Dream and Shhh at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter 5 miles up trail. The shelter is a hiker paradise with a horseshoe pit, outdoor solar shower, separate cooking pavilion area, and flowers. We spend over an hour enjoying the park-like atmosphere before sadly moving on to less-attractive things. 
The miles pass slowly without much in the way of interest. This stretch in Virginia is known for its abundance of wildflowers and we walk through open forests smiling on large patches of flowering trillium, dandelions, star chickweed, solomon's seal, and more. We pass dozens of day-hikers but our recent trend of not seeing other thru-hikers extends through the day. We do run into Smiley, a section-hiker we met several months ago at the Happy Gnomad Hiker House in Hot Springs, NC. She finished her section, went back to work for two months, and came back out to do another section, all while we were hiking.
By 6pm we are at a shelter with 15 miles in the books. With the prospect of an 18 mile day tomorrow we decide to push on for a little bit longer. Near the top of the next hill we meet some section hikers coming the opposite way obviously headed for the shelter. I ask about potential campsites ahead and learn our options are limited. Checklist tosses out the idea of the next shelter 8 miles away and receives skepticism from one of the two (male) hikers. The disbelief ruffles my wife's feathers, and she accepts the challenge with a tenacity that is a bit scary. 
Since we haven't eaten supper yet, the next spring becomes our kitchen for the evening. By the time we are finished it is 7:30pm and beginning to get dark. We hike for as long as we can in the shadowy woods before stopping to put on headlamps. The last 5 miles feel unworldly and strange. The forest around us has already gone to sleep and seems angry with us for not doing the same. Spiders scurry under leaves as we pass and once a petrified mouse bounds through our legs in terror at the nocturnal intrusion. The dim glow of my headlamp forces me into a zombie-like state in which I am only subconsciously aware of the roots and rocks my feet are avoiding. After a small eternity the shelter sign looms in the beam of my headlamp and we turn onto the side trail desperate for a tent site. The first half-decent clearing does nicely and our tent is up just in time to house our exhausted bodies for the night. I'm sure I'll be grateful tomorrow for our endeavor tonight but right now my feet are battered, my legs are sore, and my eyes are about ready to fall out.

Our late night escapade has managed to leave us tired and exhausted. We couldn't keep going like this, even if we wanted to. By getting in late and then waking up early we are burning the candle at both ends. Even stalling our wake-up past 8am doesn't really fix the burned out feeling we both share after a string of long days. In addition, I keenly feel the need for a shower. The warmer weather has accelerated how quickly we build up odors and the result is a pungent cocktail of filth and BO. As I pull on my several day old socks I tell Checklist that this is the worst I've smelled in my life. She nods in agreement, visibly quenching the urge to puke at the aromas filling the tent. Thankfully we have a plan and a reason for our madness. We met two section hikers a while back around Max Patch who told us to get in touch when we got to their part of Virginia. When I reached out several days ago they didn't hesitate to offer their house (and lives) to us for a zero day. We were hoping to make it in time to join them for church on Sunday but are now simply trying to make it on Sunday. 
Unfortunately, a daunting obstacle course stands in our way. The Roller Coaster is an infamous 13.5 mile stretch of tightly packed steep ups and downs (I counted 13 summits total!) and this morning more than 10 of those miles lie between us and our goal of Snickers Gap. We start slow and stay that way for all 10 miles. I spend the time waffling back and forth between which I dislike more: the muscle-straining ups or the joint-shattering downs (it's the downs). Rain, thunder, and lightening join the already difficult day to give us an added incentive to reach our destination. Several miles in we pass a sign telling us we've officially walked 1000 AT miles. Whoop!
With half a mile left we take a side trail to see the Bear's Den, an ATC owned hostel of sorts that offers lodging to hikers. The hiker room is small but cozy, and we meet a flip-flop thru hiker named ""EKG"" who recently started north from Rockfish Gap (Waynesboro). The stone castle-like structure is famous for its combo deal of pizza, ice-cream, and a bunk and I momentarily wish we were sticking around.
The last bit of trail goes quick and before we know it we are at the trailhead awaiting the pickup truck of a near stranger who will take us back to her house (don't do this at home kids). Ellen (trail name Easy Loper) arrives just after we do and welcomes us out of the drizzle into the protection of her Ram despite our undeniable stench. She has thoughtfully packed a small cooler full of drinks and snacks to help us last the 30 minute drive back to her house. Before long we are pulling into her driveway, which leads to a beautiful large house with brown shake siding. Inside we find spacious rooms and multiple living spaces that fulfill every need and desire we could have for a zero day. Ellen shows us to our room downstairs where she has laid out clean clothes for us to wear in lieu of our tattered rags. When she leaves us to the business of getting clean we get right to work scrubbing every last bit of grime off ourselves. That done, we return upstairs where Ellen is preparing supper for us. Upon entering the house I noticed a baby grand piano in a parlor so now I leave the women to chat for the pleasure of a long row of white ivory keys. I haven't touched a piano since we started the trail and it is a real treat to play again, even just for a little while. 
Ellen's husband Mark (The Tram) is gone on a backpacking trip  and won't return until tomorrow but our hostess makes us feel right at home over lasagna, stuffed mushrooms, and salad. We talk for a while after supper but eventually can't ignore our drooping eyelids any longer. Our space downstairs includes a sectional around a gas fireplace, so we curl up with a blanket while we write our respective journals (a major change from our norm of sleeping bags). I must confess we are both a bit stunned at the hospitality of people we've only met once. In the space of several hours we've gone from a rainy hike to a clean house to a fine meal to a couch by a fireplace. What a day in the life on the Appalachian Trail!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650503,"(A grill out with Mark and Ellen)
Breaking our tradition of early wake-ups on zero days Checklist and I sleep in late this morning. When I pad upstairs Ellen has laid out a classy breakfast of pastries and fruit on the big kitchen island. Over the meal we chat more with her about our lives and the AT. On a wall opposite the kitchen hangs a poster with a detailed map of the trail. Ellen and Mark have marked out their current section-hiking progress by pinpointing where they have and haven't been. Checklist and I have often discussed the perks of section-hiking (which typically is easier for people on the east coast) and admire the patience our hosts exhibit with their long term vision and planning.
We dwindle the morning away by relaxing on the sectional downstairs. I find an interesting book to read and Checklist gets laundry done between lounging sessions. Early in the afternoon Mark gets home from his backpacking trip and we all rendezvous in the kitchen for a light lunch. Mark is as congenial as his wife and we pass the hours in amiable conversation. Several hours later  Ellen, Mark, and I mosey over to a nearby grocery store (them for supper, me for a resupply) leaving Checklist to soak in a bathtub. When we return I take another hiatus to the piano while Mark fires up the outdoor grill. Checklist rejoins us for dinner outside and we sup on juicy burgers over the cozy ambiance of candles. The day turns to night and we escape inside for a dessert of brownie moose track ice cream. 
Even though we have to get back on trail tomorrow morning we can't resist soaking up the good company Mark and Ellen provide. The trail (and hikers on the trail) offers its own brand of friendship and companionship but it is wonderful to interact with people in such a comfortable and safe environment. Downstairs in our bedroom we load our food bags in preparation for tomorrow before climbing into bed. A soft fan blows a gentle breeze over the bed as I snuggle underneath the covers. Goodnight my beautiful world, I think as my eyelids begin to droop and dance with the sleepiness of a long day.
Following my rapt descriptions of the pleasures of a zero day a reader of this journal may question why we bother to hike in the first place. After all, if we find so much fulfillment in the activities of time away from the trail then doesn't it make sense to prioritize those things? I sometimes wonder if our typical quest for comfort back home isn't also crippling in a way. I think we often learn the most from falling down and make the best memories from some of the worst experiences. If I had stayed within the safety net of what I knew I wouldn't be here having the time of my life with my wife by my side. Of course I get as much joy from a comfy couch as anyone, don't get me wrong; but seeking discomfort in this way has broadened my understanding of the world outside my comfort zone as well as deepened my appreciation for the world within it. The Appalachian Trail most certainly isn't for everyone, but everyone understands that they need to get off the proverbial couch in some way every once in a while.

All good things must come to an end, and our time of rest is no exception. The days leading up to our break were high mileage days that pushed us hard, but now we feel rejuvenated and ready to get back on trail. Our hosts have laid out another breakfast to fuel us for the day and we soak up the food along with their company for as much time as we can spare. We've really enjoyed talking with Mark and Ellen and we feel sad we have to leave the beautiful space and stimulating conversation. Even though both of our hosts have involved careers as lawyers they both make the long drive back to the trailhead with us to see us off. Our short chapter with them ends and another begins.
I am amazed at how good I feel for the first few miles. It is almost as if I am starting anew with a fresh outlook and body. Checklist has similar thoughts and the last few miles of the Roller Coaster feel nearly effortless. While we are taking a break at the top of a hill who should walk up but Homer, Bach, and Florida Man! Through a typical series of events we have all ended up in the same place once again. We hike in a rough pack for the next ten miles, sharing experiences and laughter with one another. The miles go by in a blur as the focus shifts from distance to thoughts on the trail. This section of the trail is filled with milestones and it is natural to spend time in reflection. Our journey is nearly halfway done. What have we learned so far? What memories have we made?
Late in the afternoon we arrive at Keys Gap to find a trail angel named Vicki with a plethora of sandwiches, snacks, drinks, and goodies. She has been following my online journals and is happy to have connected with me and Checklist. She read my entry several days ago where I related the story of finding the cheesecake dessert, and she actually bought us several dehydrated meals AND that same dessert! What a great surprise! We start walking an hour later with renewed vigor. A short while later we officially cross the border from Virginia in West Virginia. We have spent such a long time in VA that it is strange to leave. 
The five of us thru-hikers decide to split a hotel room in Harper's Ferry and we trickle in off the trail several at a time. The room is small but cozy and we have a jolly evening together. Checklist and I are still full but the boys order Chinese for supper. Bach and Homer are footing the majority of the bill so they take the beds while Florida Man, Checklist, and I set up camp on the floor. The climate is warm and humid outside and it feels great to crank the thermostat all the way down and climb into bags/blankets.

In addition, the first thing I get to do after waking up is go downstairs and help myself to a great breakfast of waffles, breakfast sandwiches, and as much orange juice as I can stomach. The Quality Inn employees don't seem to mind that the crazy looking scruffy people are eating all their food, and they restock everything for as long as we stay. Upstairs in the room the atmosphere is festive and fun. Homer helps give Florida Man a buzz-style haircut and then the latter  sorts a resupply box and exchanges his winter sleeping bag for a summer one. From his perch in bed Bach announces his intention to stay in town for a burger lunch. 
We finally leave the comfort of the hotel with the intention of collecting a package from the Post Office. Unfortunately, the Postal Service doesn't have its act together and our package is apparently somewhere in the bowels of processing. Checklist's spirits take a nose dive but she rouses herself for a yearbook picture when we reach the ATC HQ just down the street (Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters). From there we take a side trail back to the AT, where I drop my pack and walk south for several hundred yards to the point where I left off yesterday. Checklist begrudgingly joins me, muttering half-joking curses on my streak of purism. We pass several people on their way to the ATC HQ: ""Towny"" is a young man who evidently enjoys being in town, ""Tumbleweed"" (him) and  ""Fruitfly"" (her) are a young couple hiking together, and ""Alias"" is a fit guy carrying a monster camera. We've heard of Alias because many of our trail friends watch his YouTube videos, which we've heard are very good. 
Half a mile later we pass Jefferson Rock, where Thomas Jefferson allegedly stood and praised the beauty of the area. Harper's Ferry is rich with history, particularly of the Civil War period where the town occupied such a critical position. My hands and eyes are too tired after a day of hiking to relay all the fascinating information but perhaps I can give an example of what we experienced in several hours by putting a snapshot of our historical bonanza in a sentence.
""Coming down from Jefferson Rock we walked down hand-hewn rock steps past a huge stone church (the only one in town to make it through the war) to a row of mini-museums facing a massive dry stone wall.""
After this highly enjoyable break we rejoin the trail and cross the border from West Virginia into Maryland. Our new state welcomes us with a long flat path that helps us get moving when it otherwise might have been difficult. The miles roll by and we stop at a shelter to eat lunch/dinner. A lot of people are here and we chat with some section hikers who have set up shop in the shelter. Homer arrives and follows his nose upwind to a nearby clearing where more people are surrounded by a group of tents. His potential success with a yogi would normally tempt me to join him but we have more than enough food at the moment so I follow Checklist away from the shelter. Bach and Florida Man are sitting at the side trail intersection when we pass and I learn we are most likely all headed for the next shelter. 
A half mile before the last shelter we stop under a large American Basswood tree at Gathland State Park and let our friends catch us. Florida Man has some hip pain and is ready to make the shelter but Homer has a full belly from a successful yogiing session and wants to do ""50"".  Mayhaps he yogied some alcoholic beverages? Unsure of where everyone will end up I hike behind my wife with Florida Man to the shelter side trail, at which point Checklist wants to press on. Florida Man promises to catch us tomorrow and says goodnight. A short time later we decide to pitch camp and forego the night hike this time around. Wonder how far Homer will get?

The morning is perfect weather for hiking but it is also perfect for chilling in the tent . . . and we don't leave until 9am. Ugh. I don't know how people get themselves up consistently early yet still manage to hike late. We almost have to pick one or the other. Inevitably though, if we wake up early one day we sleep in late the next to recover. As long as we get to Maine eventually I guess it doesn't really matter.
For breakfast we try a variety of instant oatmeal with protein in it. I assume our bodies are the better for our choice but my tongue despises the taste of the stuff.  Early miles go quickly and we make 6 without significant exertion. This jaunt takes us to the Dahlgren Backpacker's Campground, where a small building offers tantalizing free hot showers and flush toilets. We are unable to resist the temptation and stop for the better part of an hour to enjoy the diversion. 
That done, I lead the way to Washington Monument State Park for a lunch break. Checklist pulls in after me with a headache and some nausea. Faced with the sudden change in circumstances we take a long break and decide to cut the day short. As we leave the State Park I make a short detour to see the Washington National Monument. The imposing tower was originally dry-built in 1827 by patriotic citizens of Boonesboro. After years of neglect the tower was rebuilt by the CCC in 1936. A tight spiral staircase inside the tower leads to the top, where a small turret looks out over the valley below. 
Several more slow miles lead us to Pine Knob Shelter, where we roast brats over a fire and set up our tent with the rainfly on anticipation of the rain tomorrow. Towny arrived before we did and is setting up shop in the shelter. Some section hikers are here and one gives Checklist some Ibuprofen. Late in the day Tumbleweed and Fruitfly show up and join the small group spending the night here.

Not the go and play in it for an hour kind but the I'm stuck out here and I'm miserable kind. It's all well and good to say you love the rain, but when I wake up to rain that will last the next two days and I have only the prospect of a damp bed at the end of the day it is difficult to find the motivation to move. Checklist and I finally rally the courage however, and we plunge out into the downpour with as much enthusiasm as we can muster.
The puddles are deep and hard to avoid, and I often find myself hopping from one side of the trail to the other to avoid the river running down the middle. At some indistinguishable point I give in to the inevitable and allow the water free rain over my once dry clothing. Walking through the puddles is quicker and freeing, but it also contributes to the general misery of the situation. Just after midday we pull into Ensign Cowall Shelter a soggy mess. Right after we arrive the skies open and we witness a true dumping. Inside the shelter is Monson, who got here last night and is taking an on trail zero. We also reunite with EKG, who we met back at Bears Den. Several other hikers are here and none show any interest in hiking on in the rain. We cook our lunch and then decide to push on. The next shelter is only five miles further and we can't get much wetter. 
Half a mile pass the shelter I find Checklist on the other side of a violent cascade looking for the trail. Several minutes later she finds it . . . the cascade is the trail! The next hour is essentially a good old-fashioned creek stomp, minus the warm house to take refuge in at the end of the adventure. Late in the day we cross two overflowing creeks that are swirling with muddy water. The ordeals leave us wet and cold by the time we reach the shelter, which is already full of other hiker refugees. We find room in an upper corner of the spacious place and change into what few dry clothes we have from the safety of our bags. We meet ""Slice"" who is a Flip Flop NOBO traveling with her parents for the first week (Slice started in Harper's Ferry and will hike to Katahdin before ""flipping"" down to hike south to Georgia).

It took a while to get warm after our cold wet day but cold toes and fingers finally thawed somewhere between dusk and dawn. There were no snorers or disturbances and the only noise in the night was the rain (and occasional branch) drumming on the roof. This last sound only made us grateful to be under a metal roof rather than beneath our thin rainfly. The only problem is that we don't want to leave the shelter in the morning. The dismal conditions aren't welcoming in the rain, and it somehow doesn't make sense to get wet again so soon after getting dry. I shoot texts back and forth with Florida Man, who is a shelter behind us, and we agree to split a hotel room in the nearest town. With our motivation set, we pack up and head out into the drizzle. 
Conditions are similar to yesterday, with an ankle deep creek in place of the trail. Spirits undaunted, we make good time to Pen Mar State Park. Just before we reach the park I stop to snap a picture of the watery trail. Checklist disappears from sight and I hike quickly expecting to catch her shortly.

Another half mile later I reach the Maryland/Pennsylvania state line to find an empty trail . . . no Checklist. Confounded, I wait for ten minutes thinking she must have gotten sidetracked somewhere. When she still doesn't appear I worry she pushed on and is now far ahead of me. I write my name in the trail in case she is behind and then hike the next mile quickly, but I still see no sign of my wife. Unwilling to believe she could have gotten so far ahead without stopping I park and wait. Several long minutes later she hikes up with a frustrated look on her face. She waited at one of the pavilions for me and I passed when she threw away her trash in a nearby dumpster. Despite the strange series of events we are together again, and we hike the last mile of the day together. 
A shuttle takes us from the trailhead to Walmart, where we load up with food (shopping hungry) and then get Subway for a late lunch. Our shuttle had to leave so we are on our own when it comes to getting to Days Inn, which is 3.5 miles away. We stand at a Subway table and pack our food bags like tramps, then we stumble out into the misting rain hoping a kind soul will take pity and rescue us from our long walk. We haven't gone a quarter mile before a kind nurse who just got off her shift pulls over to give us a ride. 
At the hotel we find Florida Man already sprawled in bed with wet gear and clothing dangling from every hangable place in the room. A hot shower comes first, then a warm bed, finally (two hours later) a hot pizza and salad to round off the day. Monson and EKG are here, as are some other Flip-Floppers who haven't gotten trail names yet. We learn Bach and Homer are ahead . . . Smiles and No. 2 Pencil are behind . . . and we are right where we need to be.

The hotel bed is soft and comfy and makes for a good night's sleep. I wake up at 6am and decide a hot bath sounds like a great idea. When I get out Checklist is back from breakfast to give a quality report. A waffle iron is a delightful basic but the Days Inn here in Waynesboro PA otherwise seems rather skimpy. The upside is the amount of thru hikers around; nearly everyone we've met in the last few days are here. EKG and Monson are next door, some Flip Floppers named ""Hankie"" and ""Halfway"" are at breakfast, and several section hikers we know show up halfway through my first waffle. Hankie is still figuring out gear and asks me to help her with posting on trailjournals. 
Coming back from breakfast our room smells unbelievably bad . . . like air freshener won't cut it bad. To help remedy the situation we open the door for the last few hours of the morning. The brisk morning air is chilly but helps us pack up quicker. By 11am we are walking down a busy street with thumbs out. I am somewhat dubious in our ability to get a hitch with three people, but we don't make it a quarter mile before an excitable lady picks us up. 
The terrain to start is nice and even, with only the occasional puddles to slow us down. Surprisingly it stays that way for most of the day, only rebelling with the occasional steep short uphill. In addition, many different species of birds are beginning to migrate north for the summer. At one point we see four Scarlet Tanagers all clustered in the same group of trees several dozen yards off trail.
We stop at a convenient shelter for a lunch break and enjoy a comfortable picnic table under an awning. There are two small shelters here (typical for southern PA I believe), one marked ""Snorers"" and the other marked ""Non-Snorers"". Not a bad idea. Slice comes by, flying solo after a week with her parents. Checklist gets a head start on us behind her, then Florida Man leaves shortly after Checklist. I linger at the shelter to let my food settle. I ate a big meal to stretch my stomach in preparation for the Half-Gallon Challenge tomorrow. I finally get going and catch the whole bunch at a road crossing with another Flip Flopper named Josh who doesn't have a trail name yet. 
The last bunch of miles aren't strenuous, and we arrive at Quarry Gap Shelter with some daylight left. Tumbleweed and Fruitfly are here already and are eating supper in an awning between two sleeping spaces. One sleeping space is taped off because a tree fell on it recently. We squeeze onto a tent platform with Florida Man and call it a good day. Tomorrow it's ice cream time!

It is May and it is still cold in the morning. At this point Checklist and I have abandoned any desire to switch to warmer weather sleeping bags. Hearing our friends talk about a chilly miserable night doesn't exactly inspire us to follow the route they've taken. Besides, by the time we get through the transition we'll be in the higher (and colder) elevations of New England. Despite the frigid air we are up and moving early. Today has a tight schedule that revolves around the general store 17 miles away. 
The terrain today is consistently graded and easy. The most difficult part of the day is avoiding the many puddles and washed out areas of trail. Florida Man and Checklist both give in at some point and begin walking freely through the ankle deep water, leaving me to dance haphazardly  around as best I can on whatever rocks and sticks poke out of the miry swamplands. The three of us hike together throughout the day, switching leaders often to change things up. Around midday we pass the 2022 halfway point and stop for a celebratory picture.
By 2:30pm we arrive at the Pine Grove General Store where a half gallon of ice cream awaits me. Thru-hikers every year celebrate the milestone of making it halfway to Katahdin by eating a half gallon of ice cream. In contrast to the olden days, when a two by four was actually two by four, I need two containers (a typical quart & a half container plus a pint to make up the difference) to equal a half gallon. We reunite with Mountain Goat, who is a section hiker we last saw near the Roan Highlands. He decides to join me and Florida Man in the half gallon challenge and pays for our ice cream as trail magic. I opt for vanilla to keep things smooth and simple. Most peoples' goal is simply to finish the challenge . . . but I want more . . . I want the record! Last I heard the record was 5:48, set in 2018 by a thru-hiker named Turtleman. The girls manning the store inform me that record was broken last summer and now stands at an imposing 5:03 (5 minutes 3 seconds).
Two cartons of ice-cream sit in front of me. Formidable. Challenging. I nervously await Checklist's signal while contemplating strategy. Five minutes of pain or a lifetime of regret! She yells go as she taps a timer and my spoon dives into the pint. The smaller container disappears in a blur of movements involving my spoon and my mouth. I dimly hear Checklist, Florida Man, Mountain Goat, Tumbleweed, and Fruitfly offering encouragement. The first container is finished around a minute and a half, and I growl to myself in frustration. I need to go faster! The larger container is daunting but I tackle it with all the energy and enthusiasm built up over the last several hundred miles of anticipation. Halfway through it (around the 3:00 mark) I begin to struggle with the frozen center, which feels impenetrable to my titanium spoon. I jab frantically at the lump, trying to get pieces loose. At last I ditch the spoon entirely and hold the hockey puck in my bare hands, rotating it between every rushed bite. When the smoke clears the clock sits at 5:37. Disappointing . . . and yet satisfying. My original goal was to beat the 5:48, and I did that. Even if I don't have the record I'm pleased with my effort. 
After letting the food settle for several minutes I decide I want a burger and fries, so I order the sandwich and then watch Florida Man and Mountain Goat finish their challenges. The former finishes just past forty minutes; the latter drains the last melted ounces just before the timer passes an hour and a half. The store closes shortly thereafter at 4pm, and everyone else gradually filters out of the area. Monson comes and goes along with a thru-hiker we haven't met yet named ""Dozer"". Our original group of three alone remains at the picnic tables. We alternate sitting, lounging, and pacing as the food settles. Florida Man complains about his stomach and Checklist offers her pity. The park doesn't allow camping within a one mile radius and an over-achieving park ranger seems determined to wait us out, so we pack our gear resignedly and walk away from the general store. Probably not quite a mile away (sorry Pine Grove) we pass a small pine needled place by a stream and collapse for the day.

The sun is shining, the brook is babbling, and we are in no hurry to get out of bed. Why would we be with such a delightful camping spot? Pine needles are so nice and soft, and they bolster our thin Thermarest pads wonderfully. We laze in bed as the sun says good morning; even Florida Man's departure fails to spur us to action. 
When we do start walking it is at a relaxed pace. After several days of fast hiking we are of no mind to push too much and injure ourselves. We stop for lunch next to a creek and savor having the luxury of decision from our plentiful food stores. Checklist munches on a quaint chicken salad meal that comes with fruit salad and a cookie, while I opt for a bagel sandwich with cold spam and cream cheese. The creek banks are filled with tiny white flowering orbs that look like mini explosions. It is Dwarf Ginseng, a variety of ginseng that doesn't have medicinal value . . . and is as a consequence left alone for us to enjoy.
After lunch we hike slowly and separate for a time. The terrain is rather rugged and difficult compared to the last couple days. When I hear about what is coming, however, I really can't complain. I catch Checklist in the middle of the afternoon sitting by a small spring. She is in good spirits until she learns we are several miles back of where she thought we were. A snack of Oreos and Nutella help to rejuvenate us and we push on to just before Alec Kennedy Shelter, where several large campsites nestle in the crevices of a wandering stream. We settle on a more private one and I filter water while Checklist makes a pot of Annie's White Cheddar Mac'n'cheese. Another night with running water playing in the background, what a treat!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651023,"(A typical view for Checklist)I will readily admit we have not proven ourselves to be consistent early risers on the trail. But that doesn't mean we aren't capable of a sunrise start now and then. This morning is one of those times where we are on the trail as early as possible (6am). There is no strict goal; the idea is simply to get as far as we can with what daylight we have. A mile into our day we catch Florida Man just setting off from his campsite. We hike with him into Boiling Springs PA, which is a quaint trail town that offers views of a pleasant man-made town pond round which geese, ducks, swallows, and other birds are clustered. We are an hour early for either the outfitter or the post office, so we decide to push the errands to the next town stop.
The trail that leaves Boiling Springs is entirely different from the one that entered it. The ground is level and even, there are no hills within ten miles on our maps, and we can see pleasant grassy fields in all directions. In the distance are farmhouses and silos that dot the landscape and provide welcome variety to our usual fare of mountains and forests. The miles flash by as we rock and roll down the trail. Around mid afternoon Florida Man and I pull into a parking area ahead of Checklist and meet ""Stormy Weather"": an older man who looks more like Santa than a thunderstorm, and ""Licorice"": a young woman so named because of her unshared love of black licorice. The two are flip flopping from Harper's Ferry and are on day 11 of their journey. 
As we chat with them, a familiar van passes us covered from bumper to bumper in colorful stickers. ""Hey, that was Fresh Ground!"" I yell in surprise. ""We should call him and tell him we saw him"" Florida Man suggests. I do so only to have Fresh Ground turn his van around and come back to us. At first he just gets out a cooler full of iced drinks for us to share, but he can't help himself and before long he is pushing potatoes through a French Fry maker to go with hot grilled cheese sandwiches. I feel bad for calling when I learn he was headed for a motel to take a day off, but after lunch he lets me and Florida Man clean up while he sits in the shade. Lounging in a chair, he laughs and talks with our small group and seems to relax a little. 
Afterwards we hike on to the next shelter where a small group of flip flop hikers have gathered. The smell of Marijuana is strong in the air and we are glad to be moving on. The last batch of miles are tiring and we lose Florida Man to the luring call of a nice campsite with a view. We make it to the side trail to Cove Mountain Shelter and settle on a flat spot right off trail for a tent site. It has been our longest day yet, and I lie in bed feeling satisfied with the effort but thankful we don't do this every day.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651024,"(Hawk Rock)The way our bodies are changing is really quite fascinating. Last night I realized that even though my eyes were tired my legs were not fatigued in the slightest. Similarly, I was mentally exhausted, but I wasn't panting or even out of breath. Listening to our bodies is a challenge at this stage of the game because different parts of our bodies are on different levels. The one constant is our feet . . . which consistently feel abused, swollen, and mangled beyond any sense of normalcy (they also smell increasingly worse each day).
After a long day and a late night we sleep in and cherish the blessing of good sleeping weather. I cannot imagine hiking the trail later in the year and having to spend weeks on end sweating through each night. Florida Man is more disciplined than we are this morning, and he laps us before we even get out of our bags. His passing does spur us to get moving however, and we pack up camp and descend the four miles into Duncannon PA, stopping only at Hawk Rock where the views are too nice to walk by. First up is a Sunoco gas station where I get an ice cold Sprite to hydrate in the worst way. Next is an outfitter where Checklist gets some new shorts to replace a fraying pair. Finally we stop at the Post Office where a big box of protein bars and snacks offers itself to thru-hikers free of charge. 
The rest of our walk through town is rather miserable, due in part to the too-close-for-comfort traffic and in part to the intense sun beating down on our unprotected heads. Even though the wood line means a climb we are happy to reach the safety of trees and the cold shade that lies thereunder. We've heard Fresh Ground is up ahead and we encourage a section hiker named JR to push on with us to reach him. We find the man-with-a-van grilling hotdogs and deep frying potato wedges. Florida Man is there along with ""Optimus Grime"", who I met in passing several days and who now introduces himself properly. He is probably the earliest hiker we will meet this year, having started back in December. He has a wonderfully casual approach to the AT (and life in general) and has taken several lengthy breaks to work a job in a trail town in order to build up cash reserves.
JR eats and then moved on in an attempt to reach the next shelter, but the rest of us shoot the breeze with Fresh Ground far longer than we ought to, but we can't help it. This is most likely the last time we will see our friend with his Leapfrog Cafe, as he is heading south for the remaining weeks of his season. By the time he leaves the sun is low in the sky, and we all hike two quick miles to Table Rock to end our day. The view is nice but there are few sites big enough for a tent. Florida Man nestles his Nemo in the crevice of a rock, Optimus Grime strings his tarp above a small patch of grass, and Checklist and I duck tree branches to set up in a little patch of bare ground in the woods.

Last night's decision to camp at Table Rock proved itself to be a poor one. Since there weren't any obvious tent sites we had to settle for a less than ideal spot that had a large bump in the middle. The result is that we spent much of the night towards the lower half of the tent. In the morning Checklist is curled up in the fetal position at the bottom of our MSR Hubba Hubba. We endured this self-inflicted torture in the hopes of a memorable sunrise, but the sun comes up behind a screen of clouds and we are left to pack up our gear in the gloomy fog. We haven't gone a hundred feet north when we pass a nice campsite that would have been ours for the taking last night. Oh well, you can't win them all.
The clouds, sunrise spoilers though they may be, are wonderful for keeping us cool and sweat free. We hike at an easy pace for the first half of the day, taking breaks often. Checklist, Florida Man, and I all feel rather sluggish and lazy despite a good night's sleep. Optimus Grime passes the three of us early on, moving at a good clip and stating his desire to get a big day in. Our big day was two days ago, so now we have time to take it easy and notice the creatures around us. Several black snakes are curled up just off trail, Red Efts scurry around every gushing spring, and birds of all sorts flit from branch to branch.
Shortly after lunch the weather begins to sour. Rain clouds meld with the blue sky and threaten our well-being. A short cloudburst inspires me to put my rain jacket on, but the moment I do it stops, leaving me sweaty and hot. I endure it for a while, joking to Florida Man and Checklist that the moment I take it off the rain will start back up. After half an hour of my portable sauna I decide the threat has passed, so I stuff the Frogg Togg back into my pack. Minutes later the sky opens and begins drenching us with a thick downpour. ""Put the jacket back on!"" Florida Man yells from ahead of me.
The weather makes us all rather miserable, and we hurry to meet our quota for the day. Florida Man goes ahead to the shelter but we forego the 0.3 side trail in favor of a nice campsite by a stream. Once inside, we do our best to get dry and comfortable for the night. More rain is in the forecast and we look forward to escaping to a hotel tomorrow.

But after almost a hundred days on trail they are about as welcome as a princess at a barn-raising. There just isn't anywhere to go. Everything gets dank and smelly no matter where it is in my backpack. The trail is soggy and unpleasant and the water slowly creeps into my shoes as I walk. It is comforting to be walking towards a refuge however, and today we are headed for Pine Grove where we will hole up in a hotel to meet my brother Jaden, who is going to join us for a week or so of hiking. 
Early in the morning we get a nice surprise. Monarch, who we thought was lost to the bowels of the trail, catches us from behind! It is good to see a familiar face and we welcome the balance she brings to our friendship with Florida Man, who is waiting for us just up ahead. We all congregate underneath a road underpass and talk about plans for the day. Our two friends decide to join us in the hotel and we hike on with the unilateral goal of reaching Pine Grove.
As we are slipping along in the muddy path a new face appears in our rearview mirrors. We stop and I get to meet ""Dances with Wolves"" who is a genial lengthy young man who takes giant strides that dwarf my own. Florida Man and I leave the ladies behind and chase him for a time. He is easy to talk to and we are moving at quite a clip when Florida Man suddenly points out that we haven't seen a white blaze in a while. We stop and consult our sources only to learn that we have walked nearly a mile off trail. Cursing our inattentiveness we walk quickly back to where we missed a turn. While we have been taking a detour Checklist and Monarch have passed and  a trail angel has set up a table with snacks. We help ourselves to brownies and cookies, thinking maybe it was all for the best. Had we not hiked the wrong way we would have missed a nice morning calorie boost.
Dances with Wolves leaves us behind not long after an uphill climb leaves Florida Man and me gasping for breath, and it subsequently takes the two of us several hours to catch back up to the ladies. By the time we reach them we are nearly done with the day's goal of 15ish miles. We reach the road before 2pm and decide to push another two miles to a farther get-off point. Florida Man is feeling the long day in his feet but joins us in our reach for a bit extra. 
At the road the Monarch and Checklist get us a hitch within a minute, and the four of us ride to Comfort Inn squished in the back of a small sedan. At the hotel we find a friendly environment that caters to thru-hikers. A clean room, laundry room, and a courteous staff that wheel a roll-away bed into the room are all indications that we made the right choice in lodging. After taking turns underneath the showerhead we stroll over to Arby's for a solid meal of roast beef sandwiches and curly fries. As we return to the hotel we notice a storm brewing and mutually agree it is good to be inside for the night. Several hours pass in light conversation and my brother shows up just before dark. He is fresh and energized for the trail and his enthusiasm would be contagious if we weren't so extremely tired. We stay up and make some loose plans for the next few days before succumbing to the need for sleep in this one. My hotel bed feels soft and comfortable, and I will try and treasure every minute before the Pennsylvania rocks tomorrow.

I normally only take showers when I'm dirty, and why would you go to bed dirty? Now it all makes sense . . . the morning rinse is an enjoyable and pleasant way to start the day!
After a hotel breakfast we make a game plan for getting back to the trailhead 4 miles away. Five people is a bit much for a hitch so we use my brother's car to get him, Monarch, and Florida Man back to the trail. Checklist and I are subsequently on our own. A hitch is a long time coming but we get picked up by a kind man in a polo shirt on his way to church. At the trailhead he asks if we want to go several miles further up the road and attend church with him. We haven't been in church for so long and the thought is appealing. I call Florida Man and tell him we will be late getting to the shelter. 
The church building is large and spacious and we are welcomed with a chocolatey dessert that is so sweet it makes my teeth hurt. We follow our new friend to a pew and the service begins. The service isn't quite what we're used to but we wait until after the sermon ends to slip out. The whole diversion has taken more time than we originally planned for and we don't get back on trail until 12:30pm. The miles pass steadily but slowly; our friends are too far ahead to catch so there is no real reason to hurry. There is a chance of rain late in the afternoon but it proves to be no worse than a short sprinkle. We make the shelter before dark to find an unpleasant number of tents and people clustered around. Apparently the stars have aligned and everyone in a hundred mile radius has congregated at this one shelter. We find a spot away from the crowd and pitch our tent. My brother Jaden has been here for a while relaxing in his hammock but now he emerges, talking happily about the variety of birds he saw today. Jaden is an avid birder and we are looking forward to having our bird identification aided by a more serious hobbyist than ourselves. The three of us make a delicious pot of chili and eat it while sprawling on a poncho acting as a picnic blanket.

It is challenging to consistently get an early start, especially when we hike late. But it makes such a difference in how the day goes! Yesterday we didn't start hiking until past noon, so we felt exhausted by the time we ended (at 8:30pm) even though we'd hiked only 15 miles. Contrast that with today, where we wake up at 5am and are walking by 6am. The early miles roll by and we have no trouble pounding through the nine miles into town by 11am. It's a good thing too, because the road is a large busy highway not well suited for hitching. A flip flop thru-hiker named ""Forest"" has been hiking around us and now he and Florida Man take the lead in the nearly two mile walk to Walmart. The big trucks roar by and make us slightly nervous but we make it to our destination unscathed. 
Inside Walmart we hit up Subway and then tackle a resupply. Florida Man and Forest pass on the subs in favor of a steak restaurant just across the way. We're dividing the resupply among myself, Checklist, and Jaden when the storm hits. Great sheets of water dash themselves against the glass doors and we sit against a wall and watch drenched customers scurry in to safety. A kind lady sees us sitting pitifully and asks if we would like a ride to anywhere in particular. We take her up on the offer and join Monarch at a nearby Cabela's, where we meet fellow NOBO thru hikers ""Scrappy"" (because she's scrappy) and ""Butterfly"" (because he is a social butterfly). We all impatiently stare at the thunderstorm outside and count the minutes till we can hike again. 
When the rain lets up we leave Scrappy and Butterfly and head outside to try a hand at some hardcore hitching. This involves standing formidably outside the front doors of Cabela's and asking people leaving for a ride. Monarch is the best at the job; she seems to have a natural conversational way of asking people if we can all pile in their vehicle. I on the other hand have no such talent, and the one chance I get to prove my worth ends with a man holding both hands up in an imaginary defence against my non-existent wiles. Monarch eventually gets us a ride in the back of a truck, and we hop in the bed thankful to be saving ourselves the misery of another long road walk. Florida Man and Forest wave goodbye as we leave, they are in no hurry to get out of town and they can always catch us in a day or two. 
The climb out of town is brutal, but Checklist leads the way strongly up it. Monarch's company rejuvenates our spirits and the remaining miles are easy ones. At the shelter we reunite with Optimus Grime, who is trying to decide if he should press on after only 5 miles. Several other people are in the shelter area but it is getting late so we find our own spot for the night. We packed out General Tso's Chicken from the Walmart Deli, and now we enjoy it around a poncho picnic blanket. Monarch joins us and we talk about plans for tomorrow, which looks sunny and clear. I am beyond thrilled to have resupplied, eaten good food, missed a thunderstorm, and still put in decent miles. What a great day in PA!

We've been told that they aren't bad, that they are the worst part of the trail, that they only go for 30 miles, that they go for 100 miles . . . the list goes on. At some point we realized that we would just have to wait and see for ourselves. Now we are over 150 miles into Pennsylvania and still have yet to experience anything that would justify the name Rocksylvania. 
This morning we start feeling fresh and crisp, and the first several miles up to Pulpit Rock are veiled by the sleepiness of mind and body that have yet to fully wake. Monarch is waiting for us at the lookout and we take a long break to enjoy the view. This is my brother's first real overlook and he soaks it up with an appreciation that we have partially lost after several months of hiking. Pulpit Rock is followed by The Pinnacle several miles later, which can be best described as PA's version of Tinker Cliffs. We sit and watch vultures soar over the valley below with a section hiker named ""Goober"". Goober is a seasoned birder who can imitate a multitude of bird calls by using human words. We learn to listen for the ""teacher, teacher, teacher"" of the ovenbird and the ""where are you, here am I"" of the red-eyed vireo. 
After the Pinnacle the trail is wide and easy, and I pass several miles alone before stopping at a gushing spring to wait for the others. Optimus Grime and Dozer show up with the others and we all take a break in the sun together. Dozer saw a copperhead snake up at the Pinnacle and warns us to be on the lookout for sunbathing snakes. It is a good thing too, because about a mile later Checklist spots a large timber rattler coiled just off trail. The snake is poised and angry at the disturbance and its eyes follow us menacingly as we tiptoe around it.
The later miles of the day turn sufficiently rocky to satisfy any stony craving I could muster. I hike with my long-legged brother as he strides across pointy slabs of rock through a craggy minefield of boulders. By the time we reach the shelter our feet are aching, but the water source is far enough away to give us reason to hike on. Just over a mile later we stop at a nice campsite for the day. I start a fire and we share our tradition of brats-over-a-fire with Jaden (who is now beginning to experience the beginnings of hiker hunger). Monarch has an admirable habit of asking for everyone's favorite part of the day, and we go around the fire sharing what made the day special. There are lots of things to appreciate and to be thankful for! The gorgeous weather, the good company, the easy miles (most of them were anyway), and the chance to be here . . . with nothing to do but follow white blazes.

On the way we pass   Fiddy and Bach packing their bags at another campsite. Awaiting us inside the pleasant house of a hostel are free farm fresh eggs, courtesy of Yardsale's (who is the owner) chickens. Checklist scrambles a large quantity of the eggs while Monarch boils several more for lunch. Jaden rummages through his first hiker box and adds a pair of merino wool liner gloves to his pack. Optimus Grime spent the night here last night, and he convinces Florida Man to join him on a zero day. We leave the pair to the ordering of a pizza for the promise of a rocky trail ahead.
Nowhere yet in Pennsylvania have we experienced the rocks like we do over the Knife's Edge. Sharp slabs form a peak that is rugged and tough to walk on. We take our time and get through without any incidents, but am glad to be doing this on a sunny day and not a rainy one. Jaden is fresh and unscarred by the AT, and thus he is predictably thrilled by the challenge of a rock scramble. I on the other hand am excited by the trail returning to an even and wide pathway shortly thereafter.
The last half dozen miles of the day are perhaps the most visually stunning miles I've experienced in PA. For long stretches we walk on the side (and on top) of a mountain only lightly forested with trees. The ground is covered with knee-high green ferns and grass and I feel like I am in Pennsylvania's version of the Roan Highlands. On a break I am caught by Dozer and Silver Bullet (who I haven't seen since Erwin, TN), and I hike with them for a short while to catch up on trail news. 
My break with them costs me valuable time, and it takes me the last couple miles to catch Jaden, Checklist, and Monarch at the road crossing where we will end our day. We hitch into town and pitch our tents in the backyard of a hiker named ""Squeaks"". Squeaks lets us take showers and do laundry, and we follow her recommendation for supper and walk to Papa Al's for some top notch food. Following that food fest we chat with Squeaks and her husband for a while. They offer to slackpack us tomorrow and we find the suggestion tempting. I think we will see how the night in their backyard goes.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651477,"(An epic overlook!)Although it is amazing to have a free hot shower and laundry, I must confess sleeping in the middle of Palmerton doesn't compare with the middle of nowhere. I manage to get a decent night's sleep despite the noise and awake somewhat refreshed and ready for another day. It is awfully convenient to be 100 yards away from a Dunkin Donuts, and those succulent warehouses of calories are a nice first addition to my stomach. 
We have decided to take Squeaks up on her offer to slackpack us today. It does perturb me slightly that the necessary direction is southbound, but I can't resist the chance to hike without the burden of a full pack for a day. Squeak's husband Alan drives us 13 miles up trail and drops us off to hike back to Palmerton. We are a little nervous about being judged by other thru-hikers for both slackpacking and going south, so Monarch suggests we bring mini chocolate bars to pass out to whomever we meet. The strategy works great, and the first section hiker we meet tells us we made her day with just that small act of kindness. It is fun to pass many NOBO friends who we might not have seen otherwise. We see Scrappy; Strider (who is now Captain Jack), Copper, and Turn-A-Round (we haven't seen this trio since North Carolina); a handful of section hikers we know; Bach and Fiddy; and a young thru-hiker named ""Pipes"" who says he has been following us for months through our shelter log entries. 
Monarch starts slow but picks up speed and powers past us when Jaden begins to feel some pain in his thigh. Several long days of rock hopping have taken a toll on his unseasoned body, and now his long legs trudge slowly along. Even without packs the rocks are jagged and annoying to avoid. The terrain alternates between manageable and difficult with splashes of wet and treacherous. Thankfully we didn't aim for a larger day and have plenty of time to get to town. It's a good thing too, because the views in the last few miles are out of this world. Grassy meadows atop the ridge are coated with flowering Sea Thrift. Rocks jutting out of the side of the mountain provide epic lookouts and adrenaline-filled hand-over-hand descents. Every step is worthy of a picture but no camera could capture everything I'm experiencing. The smells, the satisfaction of the climb up, the feeling of the terrain underneath my feet - these are all things that I must savor and treasure in this moment. Even though he is struggling right now, I am glad my brother is able to experience the joy of seeing God's creation in such a glorious format. 
When we reach the bottom of the last mountain the trail turns left to rejoin where we left off yesterday. I can't leave even the half mile undone in my mind so I jog across the long bridge and touch the spot where we got a hitch last night. It may seem silly when we already do so much extra mileage (to reach shelters, water, town, etc.) but it is my way of staying motivated to achieve my goal of thru-hiking the AT. Today my perfectionism feels ridiculous, since we have to walk over a mile extra to return to Squeaks house in the middle of town. 
Monarch is waiting for us at the house, and once again we walk over to Papa Al's for more delicious food. The burgers are amazing but I think I enjoy the conversation more. My brother's voice brings back all the memories of home and family, Monarch is a wise sage who always has something engaging and interesting to say, and my wife is my best friend and companion. My heart is full and so is my belly, and we return to our host's house for hot showers. As the day winds down Jaden ices his leg and rubs the sore areas with pain relief balm in preparation for tomorrow. We make plans to get an early start so we can go slow and let him listen to his body. 
I am the last to take a shower and I am held up on my way out by Squeaks, who tells me about her involvement in the surrounding section of trail. She does so much for the AT around her and I am super thankful we were able to meet her. When I finally close the house door for the last time it is dark outside and the tents are quiet. In our tent I find Checklist with her headlamp on and a pen in her hand . . . fast asleep with a half-completed journal entry.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651479,"(A foggy rainy day)Last night was poor restless sleep for me. A carnival was in town and the noisy fun continued late into the evening. All well and good for bored townsfolk but very unpleasant for a tired thru hiker like me. The others are anxious to get out of town too, and we pack up early and pile into Dave's car for the ride back to Smith Gap. This time we head north, per usual, with the town of Palmerton firmly behind us.
The trail is rather bland after the thrilling climb of yesterday, with nothing to do but walk painfully over a sea of tiny sharpened rocks. Jaden is beginning to realize what it means to be a thru hiker and suggests that my journal could do with a bit more discourse on what we actually spend most of our time doing. Of course I could spend entire entries detailing what exactly the trail looks like, the painful downward spiral my body follows each day, or even the various things we think about as we walk   1-25 miles of trail. I suspect the end result would be rather bland however, and I somehow doubt anyone (including myself) would ever want to read such entries. The truth is that what we are doing is extremely repetitive . . . we walk all day every day. I do my best to take joy in the hike, but ultimately, what often stands out is what happens when I'm not hiking. Or as Florida Man would say: ""The best part of a thru-hike is when you aren't thru-hiking"".
Jaden is also experiencing something else that is far too common . . . pain. His leg has worsened and his pace has likewise suffered. We are trying to find the line between when it is time to slow down and when it is time to stop. Around noon we realize it is time to do the latter, so I turn on my phone and text Monarch to let her know we won't make it to our planned end point. It really is for the best anyway, because as we set up camp it begins to rain. Even the campsites are embedded with pad-popping stone daggers, and it takes several precious rainy minutes to yank what rocks we can and mound leaves on what we can't. Inside our tent (and hammock), we wile the afternoon away while the rain does its best to get us wet. Sometime in the evening it gives up, and we make a pot of chili and curl up in our sleeping bags to catch up on several days worth of poor sleep.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652170,"(My feet don't really like hiking)Being as tired as we are on a daily basis really improves our chances of getting good sleep each night. Most evenings we practically collapse into bed as soon as all the camp chores are done. The only difficulty comes when it is time to motivate our sleepy selves to roll out of bed and face another day of walking. This morning we allow a couple extra hours of dozing before bothering to incite any substantial movement. The day is as lazy as we are to get going, and the sun takes forever to rise to any real prominence in the sky. Once it does, however, we are off! 
Jaden's leg is feeling much better after a long period of rest but he makes the decision to get off a day early (which means tomorrow morning). This leaves us with a fair amount of miles left to cover, so we get to work and knock out half a dozen miles. The terrain is studded with rocks but it isn't at all unmanageable. We plan to eat lunch at Wolf Rocks but when we get there we are greeted by a large copperhead snake nestled warmly against a sunny ledge. Our plans changed, we press on until the terrain returns to safe soft soil. 
After lunch we plod the several miles to Kirkridge Shelter, where we escape the heat of day for the cool solitude of the concrete structure. An hour later our reverie is disturbed by several female overnighters, who announce they would like a berth in the shelter for the night. We unhappily gather our things and head back into the outdoor sauna. Halfway to our end goal Jaden and I stop to wait for Checklist on a tree that has fallen across the path. Hearing a noise to our left, we look over to see a full grown coyote less than five feet away. He is unperturbed by our presence on the trail, and saunters around us just out of reach as if to say: ""don't worry, I'll just take the detour this time"".
We stop several miles shy of Delaware Water Gap at a lookout called Council Rock. The day is still overly warm but it has cooled off enough for us to bear the heat of a small campfire. The blaze is necessary for us to cook a hearty meal of brats, and we retire with full bellies. Today is Jaden's last day, and Checklist comments that it feels wrong for him to be leaving so soon. We have enjoyed the familiarity of family, but I must confess having him around has made us both a bit homesick. Perhaps crossing into New Jersey tomorrow will help.

The sun is still below the horizon when we emerge from our homes for the night, but a dim glow of dusk  illuminates the area enough for packing up. It is a short walk into Delaware Water Gap, where we take on last look at Pennsylvania before starting across the long bridge that crosses the river marking the border between PA and NJ. Pennsylvania has been surprisingly enjoyable for Checklist and me; the endless rocks never really materialized, the views were scant enough to be special, and the general scenery was a change of pace from Virginia. I'm not sure why everyone warned us about the rocks of Pennsylvania. To be sure there were tricky patches here and there, but nothing that evoked the name Rocksylvania. Most of Pennsylvania turned out to be well-maintained and graded. The worst part was easily the danger from venomous snakes. While it was cool to see them, the fear from constantly wondering if a snake was under the next rock beat out the trepidation of any little old boulder field. 
Pennsylvania in the past, we say goodbye to my brother and watch him hop on a shuttle back to Pine Grove. The sight is sad but we are left with nothing to do but keep walking.We set our sights on an off trail camp store/deli 10 miles ahead and churn through miles with a full head of steam. We are at the camp store just in time for lunch and I order the sandwich & chips meal for 11.99 (the only option available I might add!). When the sandwich comes I am a bit disappointed. Even being generous I can only value the meal at 7.99. All food is welcome, however, and we do make use of the lounge area as a relaxing spot for a  break. 
By the time we continue hiking it is hot again, and we go slow and enjoy the grassy ridge that the trail has been following. Hickory trees are lightly scattered among the tall grass, creating a highly pleasing area that is a treat to walk through. Amazing campsites abound and we both wish we had brought a full load of water so we could dry camp at one of them. Instead we push on in search of water, which comes from above instead of below. Since we have no way to collect the rain other than in our clothes, we continue plodding along in the cloudburst for an hour or so. Finally, (and just as the rain stops) we reach a road with a spring nearby. A sign spells out the terms: ""no camping within a half mile of the road"". Sorry New Jersey, we are too tired to care. Besides, if you don't want us to camp next to the road you shouldn't tempt us with a soft bed of pine needles.

Pine needles make a really nice camping spot. They're soft and spongy and generally level. This is a recipe for a sound sleep and we follow it to the letter. The result is a morning that has us feeling fresh and rested. As we pack up camp a hiker passes and stops to chat. His name is ""Bushwhacker"" and he is a thru-hiker who started on March 24th. His wife is supporting his speedy hike from the comfort of a van, but next year he says they will switch and he will support her. This allows them each to hike at their own pace but still end up each day together. I am glad Checklist and I are doing this hike together, but it is cool to hear how other couples are figuring out how to make differences work.
New Jersey is kind to us throughout the morning, and consistently rewards light climbs with pleasant views. The one downside of this new state is the rust-tinted water that runs in every stream. Only the springs are clear, but even they are few and far between, leaving us to hike in thirst or carry extra water weight. While on a break by Brink Shelter (which has been closed due to bear activity) Checklist spots a familiar looking mushroom, and we take a moment to harvest a pound or so of Chicken-of-the-Woods for a meal later today or tomorrow.
We make good time to Culver's Gap, where we hitch a ride to a local grocery store to resupply. Shopping hungry, everything looks good, and we throw caution to the wind and grab whatever looks good. Two full sized cakes may not be the wisest thing to carry, but they sure will taste good out in the woods! We sit outside the store and stuff our bounty into our backpacks while charging electronics on an outdoor outlet. It would seem the entertainment is lacking around here because every other person entering the store looks us over like we're a  sideshow at the circus. Checklist settles on one likely looking lady and begins yogiing for a ride. ""Do you know if the diner down the street is good?"" she queries the unsuspecting victim, ""we're looking for a place to eat lunch"". ""It's a normal New Jersey Diner"" is the reply, ""there's another one down the street the opposite way"".Unfazed, Checklist gets more obvious: ""Oh okay, thanks, we're just looking for a place we can walk to that isn't too far"". Halfway into her car the lady gets the hint, ""do you need a ride somewhere?"" Pumping imaginary fists we respond with ""the diner would be great!""
The diner turns out to be an awesome little find that churns out epic Philly Cheesesteaks and Burgers for rock-bottom prices. We top the meal off with a dish of blueberry ice cream and we are ready to go. A wreck down the road means a hitch is no longer possible so we walk the mile back to the trailhead. 
The last batch of miles is harder than the first but still comparatively easier than the rest of the trail. We bump into two flip flop hikers we met at the diner named ""Maizee"" and ""Taps"". They are congenial guys who stop a shelter before we do. Taps carries a bugle and as we walk in the dimming light we can hear him playing his song from a half mile back. We stumble into Mashipacong Shelter wondering why we've done this to ourselves once again. A thru-hiker named ""Da Vinci"" is here and talks up a storm while we fill water from jigs in the bear box. His comedic profane-filled speech reminds me a bit of Homer, who is several days behind us (last we heard). Settling several hundred yards away from the main clearing, we pitch our tent and enjoy cake for supper.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652173,"(Checklist and Beer Girl surveying a grassy field)This is no longer a journey - it's a lifestyle. We walk all day and collapse in the dirt whenever we finish. We gorge on food whenever possible and think about it whenever not. We beg for rides proudly with thumbs held high. We rummage through dingy wooden chests or rubbermaids in the hopes of finding a free crushed Cliff Bar. We hate hiking but can't stop doing it. Not a day goes by where we don't think about a comfort of home, but we still press on towards Maine. Whenever day hikers ask about where we are going, we reply with a practiced ""Thru"". It isn't that we are no longer enthralled by every day, rather that we are now accustomed to our new way of life. Each morning holds something new and exciting, like a deer waiting nonchalantly by the trail or an especially pretty sunrise. It's just the everyday acts that have become a predictable part of life; like filtering water or setting up camp. Make no mistake, this temporary way of life is special, and we find unique joys all the time. New Jersey, for example, has been a treasure trove of wildlife, flowery fields, and hilltop meadows.
Today is a rather difficult struggle that begins at 8am and goes until 8pm. Monarch made it to the shelter late last night and is happy to see us in the morning. She beats us out of camp and we don't see her for half a dozen miles. In the meantime I hike with a flip flop hiker named ""Arete"". He is a fit retired doctor from Texas and he makes a great conversation partner. Checklist and I have set a goal to learn all about the different states of the US by asking various hikers to describe their state. Arete is the first Texan I've met on trail and he does a good job describing the differences between east Texas and west Texas.
Lunch is a creative affair where we try two different concoctions at once. The first is a fantastic-tasting avocado and cream cheese on bread, and the second is ramen with a bag of raw coleslaw mix cooked in. These combinations are an example of the lengths we go to in order to make the same basic hiker foods feel different.
After lunch we hike with ""Beer Girl"", who hails from Las Vegas, Nevada. She has traveled to over 52 countries and regals us with a wealth of stories as we walk. We leave her behind when her knee slows her pace, and stop in at the ""secret shelter"" for a mid-afternoon break. The secret shelter is a small unmarked collection of buildings  seemingly deserted and in the middle of nowhere (but just 0.2 off trail). A resident donkey named Jack is grazing unattended in the small yard, and he wanders over to us to say hi when we open our food bags for a snack. 
The last five miles are difficult (per usual), and our feet are sore as we climb up the last hill. Tent sites are scarce and the shelter is empty so we decide to set up shop inside. Monarch is already here and she waddles over wrapped cozily in a sleeping bag. She had a hard day today too and is looking forward to a nero tomorrow. We cook a supper of mushroom, onions, and peppers in the dark and crawl into the shelter thankful we don't have to mess with a tent.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652174,"(Chippy the Chipmunk)The night in the shelter went surprisingly well. No late-night hikers crashed our party so we had the entire place to ourselves all night long. Our squeaky friends stayed away to boot, leaving our gear safe and un-chewed. Morning pack up is easier too, and we are first out on the trail. Silver Bullet is the first to catch us, and voices his desire to get to a shelter 22 miles away before leaving us behind. After another mile of easy terrain I hike ahead of Checklist promising to meet her at an upcoming road crossing. When I get there I pull out a book I picked up at a free library back at the State Park. The book is about the 1919 Tour De France and is well researched and interesting. I'm planning to carry it until I'm done, at which point I'll leave at a shelter for others to enjoy. 
When Checklist catches up she is hiking with a flip flop from the shelter last night named ""Mercury"". Mercury is a friendly lady who got her name because her initials are HG (and because she works in science). We hike with her up to the next road, where we find Silver Bullet hitting the trail after a stop at a nearby farm market. We head there ourselves, and I pick out blueberry ice cream and a large cheese danish. Loaded with this influx of sugar we haul ourselves up an incline aptly named ""stairway to heaven"". Just over the top we hit a stream and meet ""6 Paws"", a man and his dog hiking the trail together. 6 Paws (the human half) tells us Mercury is just ahead of us, so we hurry our pace and catch her chugging up a hill.  Five minutes later we're glad we caught her, because a mama bear and 3 yearling cubs saunter across the trail ahead of us (bear count - 5). Our combined trio makes enough noise to encourage their pace, and our second encounter with bears is another positive one.
The three of us stop at a nearby visitor center for a late lunch, where we find an aspiring thru-hiker who has snacks and Gatorade. Mercury takes him up on the offer of a ride to town, but we decide to press on. The late afternoon/evening is a great time to see wildlife. Besides the bears from earlier, we also spot a small chipmunk who unabashedly watches us pass from the safety of his tree root burrow. He is so cute we sit on a rock as the day wanes just to watch him pop in and out.
The combined caloric boost from lunch gets us to the New Jersey/New York state line before we begin to fizzle out. A half mile later we pitch our tent in a little grassy dent on top of Prospect Rock, which is the highest point on the AT in New York. Far out east on the horizon we can see the New York City skyline, and north we catch a glimpse of the small jagged mountains ahead.

The sun is rising over the mountains directly in front of our tent and is putting on a show. Sometimes it only takes a moment like this to help me realize how worthwhile this journey is. The sunrise also helps us get up and moving early, and we are headed down the mountain by 6:30am. Several hours in we have an important decision to make. NY 17A is a logical breaking point for several reasons. One, a hotdog stand (opens at 11am) is right down the street. Two, a dairy farm (opens at 12am) that makes its own ice cream is across from the hot dog stand. And three, a good-looking New York deli is about two miles down the road. The fact that we arrived the road at 10am should make our decision more difficult, especially given that we have a dozen miles left to go . . . but it doesn't take us long to make up our minds.
We walk to the creamery and throw away our trash first, then we are ready to get a hitch to the deli. Fortunately, an unsuspecting middle aged couple is in the right (or wrong, depending on your perspective) place at the right time. They took a morning stroll on the trail and are now returning to their car in the creamery parking lot. Checklist yogis persistently and finally has reluctant success when she asks cheerfully for a ride. At the deli we ooh and ahh before settling on some baked hero sandwiches. I am filled with an inexplicable happiness when the sandwiches are ready. They are large sandwiches on a heavily seeded sub roll generously slathered with fresh mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. The breaded chicken on mine is sublime, and Checklist's meatball version is equally as delicious. When we finish we hitch a ride back to the creamery with another sub each stuffed in the front pocket of our packs. 
At the creamery I fill water bottles at a provided spigot and plug our electronics into a hiker outlet. The Bellvale Creamery is extremely hiker-friendly and even has a massive logbook for us to sign when we go in to get our ice cream. The interior of the creamery is bare bones and to the point, without an ounce of touristy bling. It smells strongly of sugar cones and fresh cream, and it makes me want to set up camp here for the day. The ice cream they serve is wonderfully creamy, and is probably the best I've ever had. After two scoops each we lumber back to the trail ready to roll the rest of the day away. 
After our long hiatus from the day's work we have to pay the piper, and the payment takes the form of a late day that goes right up until dark. The trail is extremely difficult and the sharp ups and downs remind me of the roller coaster back in Virginia. By the time we stumble onto an acceptable campsite it is well past my bedtime.

This morning we are groggy and slow to get going. Even when we do get on trail my feet feel like they have lead weights attached to them. We stop at a local park/beach at one o'clock in the afternoon with just four miles behind us and make several pots of ramen, hoping to jumpstart our lethargic systems. The park normally boasts a bathhouse but it won't open until Memorial Day (just three days away), so our filth ridden bodies will just have to wait a bit longer. There is a small restroom facility, and I am delighted to find an outlet way up in the corner next to a wall-mounted oscillating fan. 
The pots of ramen don't help energy much, but the respite does, and we get back on trail determined to put a better number on the day.

We press on in the downpour for as long as we can, before the inevitable darkness forces a stop (headlamps in the rain isn't in the cards for us). Drenched and footsore, we pool our food bags to create a meager dinner.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652178,"(A New York Deli)It rained all night. Everything is . . . once again . . . wet. Hiking for days in continual rain is perhaps the least enjoyable part of any AT thru-hike. For most hikers I daresay slipping into damp clothes in the morning beats out a steep hill or some sharp rocks for sheer misery. It would help considerably if there was some way out, some dry place we knew would be waiting for us at the end of the day. Unfortunately this stretch of trail is lacking when it comes to affordable lodging. What it does have however, is delis. 
A deli is the only thing on our mind this morning as we set out into the drizzle. Bear Mountain stands imposingly in our way, taunting us as if we haven't done this a thousand times already. Turns out, Bear Mountain is actually a walk in the park (Bear Mountain State Park to be precise). The trail is extravagantly maintained, as if the entire bulk of New York tax dollars has been spent to make it what it is. Dry stone walls support every downhill side and hand split granite steps make every hill a pleasure. The fog blocks any views but we find a nice surprise on the other side of the mountain. Bear Mountain Inn is a historic lodge that sits on a plateau with all the grandeur of a true masterpiece. The area is filled with people on vacation, and we walk in the inn with the unshakeable feeling that we are second-class citizens. The clerk at the front desk is undeniably snobbish, but he doesn't seem to mind when we help ourselves to a cup of coffee and a seat on a plush leather couch. 
Rejuvenated by this luxury we pound out another five rainy miles in the pouring rain to an on-trail deli. In the deli we find a thru-hiker named Michael (no trail name), a thru-hiker named ""Gorby"", and some college students out for memorial day weekend. Everyone is drenched to the bone, and we make quite a mess on the deli floor. Checklist and I order burgers for lunch, subs for supper later, and breakfast sandwiches for tomorrow. Michael asks us for help with his order; with his thick Irish brogue he is having trouble getting through to the Hispanic deli clerk. Gorby sits nearby with a dazed look on his eye - a piece of packaged cake and bottle of chocolate milk sit on the table before him. Him and Michael are part of the speedy March class of thru-hikers that has begun to overtake us. We all have various plans to avoid or handle the rain: the college students charge out first, reckless with the knowledge that their trip will soon be over. Next to go is Gorby, who has found an a place of refuge with a nearby aunt who can pick him up six miles from the deli. After him is Michael; who, thoroughly disgusted with the rain, is going to seek shelter at an off-trail hiker pavilion 2 miles away. We are the last to leave, having stalled for as long as possible. 
The last handful of miles are sloppy, wet, and altogether unenjoyable. About the only satisfaction I find in such conditions is that we are making miles when most are hiked up in a hotel room. The rain mercifully stops late in the day and we are able to set up our tent to a soft peaceful sunset. The tent site is nothing but a mud puddle, so I make a bed of ferns to provide some protection from the sludge underneath our feet. Our subs are yummy but even better is knowing the night will be rain-less and quiet.

On the other hand, we seem to have selected a spot smack dab in the middle of slug city. The slimy creatures are everywhere: climbing up the tent, oozing slime on our gear, and generally being a nuisance wherever possible. We pack up camp doing our best to rid ourselves of every last one of the pests, but inevitably we miss one or two that come along for a few hours of hiking.
The early morning terrain is pleasant, minus the several areas where the trail could use some brush trimming. Barberry bushes and field grasses have gotten out of hand and make the trail feel more like a jungle safari than a footpath. Around mid-morning we catch up to the college students breaking camp, so we hike with the trio for a while. They are foreign students currently living in Manhattan, NY. One is from Toronto, one is from Morocco, and one is from France. Together we make quite the smelting pot, and we spend the hours pleasantly chatting about the differences between countries when it comes to culture and family life. Around noon we cruise into Clarence Fahnestock State Park, where a small lake beach has attracted a large amount of people out to celebrate memorial day weekend. We've been promised hot showers from the bathhouse but are surprised with a hot water heater yet to be turned on. Cold showers get us clean and we feel refreshed as well . . . but I still would have preferred a hot one.
Our plan for the day was to get to the next deli for supper. Recently, we have been engaging in an activity I'll call Deli-blazing, where we carry little to no food and just skip from one trailside deli to the next. This plan has worked well thus far, but I call the deli for tonight to learn they are closing early and will not be open by the time we get there. Disappointed, we grab a couple overpriced burgers from the park concession and push on anyway. 
Around 5pm we make a late stop by the RPH shelter, a nice one as far as they go. Michael and a section hiker named ""Disciple"" are sitting in lawn chairs out front and hail us when we walk up. They have spread out the entirety of their gear on the lawn in the sun, and it looks comically like a messy yardsale. We eat our burgers while we catch up on the latest trail news from Disciple, who started back at Pine Grove and is going much slower than we are. Many people would be amazed at the amount of information that thru hikers know about other thru hikers that are dozens of miles away in both directions. Since there is little else to talk about our here, our conversation often drifts to those people who are mutually known by both parties. Where are they? Are they taking a day off from the weather? Who (if anyone) has gotten hurt and gotten off trail now? Since Disciple has been recently passed by many of the people ahead of us, he has a good wealth of information on people like Gazelle, Chef Decker, Radioactive, and Tree-hugger. Likewise, we fill him in on the rough whereabouts of Beer Girl, Maizee, and Alaska Man.
The last few miles are always the hardest, but we finally make it to the road, where we walk to the closed deli's back yard. They are friendly to thru hikers, and let us camp on the grass and use their electricity and water. From this location we also have access to half a dozen pizza joints that deliver - an idea that is too delicious to resist. Honestly, I was rather surprised by how easily my half of an extra large chicken-bacon-ranch pizza went down.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652461,"(Checklist standing next to the Dover Oak)Our eyes open with the sun at around 6am, but our bodies stay put and refuse to move until sufficient motivation has arrived. At seven am it does . . . in the form of the deli opening. I start slow, with a breakfast sandwich and a sugary coffee. Then I take it up a notch and down a pint of banana pudding ice cream. We've decided to waive our plan of getting to the next deli in favor of a bigger mile day, so we order two hero sandwiches each (and a box of donuts) and hit the trail at 9:30am. Our gear is finally dry, albeit smelly and disgustingly dirty, and our spirits are high. We have a hurried pace that is borne of necessity (we won't make our goal taking long breaks), and we stop only for a periodic  drink of water or bite of sandwich. 
The terrain is fairly easy today but the trail itself is poorly designed and maintained. Often we walk on dilapidated big bridges that end abruptly in the midst of a muddy puddle, as if to say: ""I've done by best but you're on your own from here"". We pass by several shelters that have epic hand pumps installed for water sources. Unfortunately the powers that be have determined the water is unfit for drinking and have subsequently removed the handles to prevent usage. This makes for a difficult water day on an already sweltering trek. A highlight of the day is making it to the Dover  Oak, which is the largest tree on the AT with a girth that is over 20 ft (readers may remember the Keffer Oak back in VA that was a close second to this one).
Late in the afternoon we make it to a landscape garden center that is on a road next to the trail. The business is friendly to hikers and offers an outdoor shower and a place to hang out, providing it isn't past business hours. It is in fact past business hours when we arrive, but the heat necessitates that we loiter for a bit to recover. The shower is inoperable at the moment so we are able only to fill up water before pressing on. 
The last half dozen miles is a quick sprint that we power through. Making it by dark becomes a priority and can lead to some pretty speedy hiking. At one point, Checklist takes off and leaves me hiking quickly but still falling behind. ""This isn't how this usually works!"" I wonder to myself in amazement. The prize awaits at Wiley Shelter, where we enjoy the last of our food in the dark privacy of our tent.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652462,"(The New York/Connecticut border)It probably isn't the wisest course of action to bookend our days by hiking late and then getting up early, but sometimes the circumstances dictate such a move. A weather check late last night revealed that today would be over 90 degrees for much of the afternoon, so we decided to knock out miles early. By 6am we are moving down trail and swatting mosquitos from every part of body not protected by clothing. Despite our efforts to miss the heat, the temperature rises faster than we can hike, and before long we are drenched with perspiration. The forest around us are infested with gypsy moth caterpillars, and the little furry devils drop from trees all around and above us on silken strands. The ones that aren't crawling on us or our packs are excreting who knows what onto us from their lofty perches. 
The entire hiking situation is poor, and it causes us to re-evaluate our original plan of a fly-by-resupply in town. Conceding temporary defeat, I call a local B&B and get a room for the night. With plenty of motivation to now get going, we chug through New York's final sally of hills and cross the border into Connecticut. Shortly thereafter we arrive at CT 341, where we hitch a ride a mile down the road into the small town of Kent. We are in town at 3pm, and so have time to resupply, do laundry, and eat at a local asian restaurant. This done, we call our lodging for the night to get a ride to safety. 
The B&B is a well-kept quaint old house run by a friendly elderly couple named Barbie and Dan. Our room is clean and pleasantly decorated, and the house offers plenty of spaces to relax. Barbie's Place (as it's called) sits on a hill that looks out over a peaceful valley below. Fencing her yard in is a gorgeous dry stone wall that plays a visual symphony with the dairy cows, barn, and farmhouse directly downhill. It is difficult to retire to our room from the screened-in porch, but eventually, tired eyes leave us no other choice.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652463,"(The view from Barbie's back porch)Before starting the trail, I read that some hikers have trouble sleeping in real beds after repeated nights on the hard ground. Some even resort to sleeping on the floor for the several weeks following their thru-hike. Even though we haven't taken as many zeros as other hikers, we haven't yet had trouble with a real bed. If anything, the deeper we get into our hike the more comfortable a real bed feels. Clean sheets are to be appreciated, a full pillow to be treasured, and the weight of real blankets to be savored. Checklist jokes that we still only get about six hours of sleep on our nights off, we just try to get ""super high quality"" sleep. 
A new morning offers much in the way of time to experience all the little details of our place of lodging. I am still carrying the book I picked up over a week ago, so I pad out to the sitting room and pick up where I last left off (about halfway through) with my feet comfortably immersed in a tub of Epsom salt and hot water. I don't get far before I am distracted by the seemingly random assortment of antiques lying on the coffee table in front of me. Checklist and our host join me, and I learn that this is a game where we guess what items from the 1800s were used for. Checklist and I do pretty well for our age, and manage to guess the Jew's Harp, Spiles, Spice Grater, Egg Weigher, and Candle Snuffer. We fail to guess the Bed Key, Lard Press, Walnut Cracker, Hand-Held Corn Shucker, and Bunion Reliever.
After a light breakfast it is time to pack up and hit the trail once again. Dan shuttles us back to the trailhead and we start hiking at 9am. We climb steeply up away from Kent and then dive into a series of steep hills that test our good spirits. Our bags are heavy with a full resupply but we feel fresher than we have in quite some time, and we are able to conquer the strenuous section without exhausting ourselves prematurely. At the bottom of this turbulence the trail levels out peacefully and follows the Housatonic River for five miles. Halfway through we stop at Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter for an early lunch. Fifteen minutes later the skies darken and rain begins to fall. We crawl deep into a back corner of the shelter and listen to the thunder grumble as we munch on leftover General Tso's Chicken and Mongolian Beef. A weather check reveals the storm will last an hour, so we lounge uncomfortably against our gear to wait it out. An hour later I awake from a deep slumber to find the rain has stopped. I rouse Checklist from where she is sleeping and we drowsily shoulder our packs and head back out. We hike for several hours and meet Captain Jack, Copper, and Turn-Around slackpacking south. They slacked a 38 mile day yesterday and are now attempting 32. Up until this point we have kept up with them by being more consistent, but I have a feeling that our time together is coming to an end. Several more miles get checked off before the storm returns to sprinkle us with fat drops of water. We walk quickly for as long as we can before finally abandoning ship and setting up our tent in a steady drizzle. Looks like rain all night. I'm glad to have a sturdy tent to keep us dry.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652464,"(Amesville Bridge)Back in Georgia the days were short and terrible. The sun rose at 8am and set at 8pm, and we hiked all day to get in 16 miles. Now, the sun rises at 5:30am and doesn't set until 8:30pm (Daylight Savings). This leaves a large chunk of time for us to make use of if we so choose. If I had my way, we would rise every morning before daybreak and be hiking by 6am. Although I may occasionally wish for a schedule like this, or bigger mile days; I'm actually thankful Checklist refuses to hike in such a fashion. Far too many thru-hikers get injured because they push too far (just last week we heard Dances with Wolves injured his Achilles Tendon on a slick rock and had to get off trail). Many more finish their hike only to wonder why they did it so fast. 
Succeeding several lighter days, however, an early start and a bigger day makes a lot more sense. In light of this, we rouse ourselves while it is still dark and get hiking by 6am. Despite this, it takes us awhile to build up steam over the jagged mountains that fill the morning. By the time we cross the Amesville Iron Bridge to take a late lunch we still have 11 miles left to go. Calling on all the energy one can gather from large spoonfuls of Nutella and marshmallow fluff we throw on our packs and get moving. 
Somewhere in that difficult part of the afternoon (the middle) we meet another thru-hiker named ""M&M"" (Mike from Maine). We hike with him for a time and learn more about his home state. There haven't been many thru-hikers around recently and we soak up his company (and his speed) before wishing him well. The last few miles are as tough as they always are, and as our friend Magnificent Monkey would say: ""There's always a hill at the end of the day"". We arrive at Riga Shelter tired and ready for our own space. We say hi to the group at the shelter, which consists of a handful of flip floppers. Gorby is here, along with ""Rockfish"", ""Rootseeker"", and ""The Tyvek Shaman"". 
Satisfied with the social interaction we retire to a far corner and set up on a wooden tent platform to prepare for a rainy night.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652465,"(A super sub for dinner!)The wooden plank tent platform we set up our tent on last night really helped with water drainage. In addition, because we were elevated above the ground there isn't any of the usual dirt splashed onto the side of the tent. The rainfly is still wet of course, but we pack it into its stuff sack and invite mold and mildew to do their worst. We set off strongly and hike a quick mile to Brasse Brook Shelter (Connecticut puts their shelters together in pairs so they won't get lonely). Just past the shelter sign we catch up to a friendly section hiker named ""Glider"", who seems to enjoy the company and the conversation. We all make light talk as we clamber up and over the triple gauntlet of Bear Mountain, Race Mountain, and Mount Everett. Following the first of the three we pass out of Connecticut into Massachusetts and get one more mental step closer to Katahdin. 
After Mount Everett the terrain gets markedly easier, so we pick up the pace hoping to make good time to Great Barrington MA. We've gotten in touch with a section hiker there named ""Steady Stream"" who we met back in Maryland. Steady Stream offered his place up as a crash pad, and now we finally get to take him up on his trail magic. The last few miles before Great Barrington are flat and graded, but the swarms of mosquitos make what should have been easy a miserable gauntlet. We cost ourselves with as much bug spray as possible and speed through the bloodsucking bogs. The mosquitos follow us in droves and attack the weak spots in our bug spray armor. At one point I walk with the bottle of bug spray in one hand and my trekking poles in the other. Any time I get bitten (which is about every 30 seconds) I spray more protection on the defenseless position. 
Thankfully the pain lasts but a moment, and we make it in one piece to US 7, where Steady Stream meets us with cold drinks and a bag of chips. He takes us to a local grocery store, where we resupply and get an enormous sub at the deli for supper. We then head to his apartment, where we chow down and learn more about our host. Steady Stream is actually a violin builder and technician. He builds and sells his own violins, along with refurbishing other older models. He has a fascinating story of how he studied in the top violin school in the world in Germany back in the 1970s, and he holds us spellbound with the details of his life. In his bedroom are several violins bearing his name that look like true examples of the mastery he exhibits in his craft. His apartment is small and there isn't much extra space, but we crowd in like family and have a jolly evening. It feels incredible to experience scalding hot showers before climbing into a pullout bed in his small living room. The kindness of strangers amazes me.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652762,"(Steady Stream in his workshop)I never would have dreamed a pullout bed could be so comfortable. I'm at the point where I feel like I can sleep anywhere, at any time. No matter how much I get, it is never enough to support the amount of activity each day. This leaves me thankful for times like these, when I sleep through the night without stirring once. Checklist and I are both up at 6am sharp, packing up and moving about. It is a real treat to brush my teeth in a real bathroom sink with my face ostensibly dancing in the mirror. 
When we are all ready to go, Steady Stream takes us back to the trailhead. First, however, he makes a stop at his workshop to show us what he does every day. When we walk into the small area we are stunned at the intricacies surrounding us. Delicate instruments and parts of instruments adorn every surface. Supplies and tools fill every nook and cranny. Several adjacent rooms are filled with dozens of refurbished or built-from-scratch instruments waiting to be sold. One area is filled with close to 50 violins that look like world class works of art. Another space holds a small flock of Cellos, waiting patiently for future owners to come and find them. This is Steady Stream's life work and passion. He demonstrates his love for these stringed instruments by playing a piece for us on a cello. As we listen to the emotional notes I can't help but wonder at the circumstances which bring us together. Life on the trail looks nearly the same for most thru-hikers, but it is easy to forget that everyone has lives back home that may differ significantly from what I see out here.
After such a friendly and hospitable encounter it is difficult to get going, but say goodbye to our new friend and launch ourselves back into the trail. We make it six miles to Tom Leonard Shelter before our newfound energy begins to wain. We sit and  chat with a couple section hikers as we eat lunch. Finally, unable to stall the rest of the day any longer, we head back up the short side trail to where the shelter's blue blaze meets the AT's white one. At the intersection we meet an energetic older man who looks like he could use a few pounds. He is a flip flopper from New Brunswick trying to knock the AT off his bucket list. His pace is similar to ours, and we hike together for another half dozen miles. I give him some advice on keeping the pounds on, and he takes it to heart as only a truly emaciated soul could.
His day began earlier than ours did, so it ends first as well, and we are left to hike the last miles in solitude. With a couple miles left to go Checklist sends me ahead with her tent poles so I can have the tent set up by the time she gets to camp. As I reach the crest of a hill just before going down to the campsite, I run up behind a porcupine. The prickly creature seems affronted by my sudden appearance, and he raises his needles in defence as he waddles away. We have been seeing a lot of wildlife recently. Yesterday we scared a black bear off the trail ahead of us (bear count - 6) and then ran into a different porcupine on top of Race Mountain. This, of course, is in addition to the many milk snakes, birds, chipmunks,  and squirrels, which we see unceasingly.
By the time I reach the Shaker Campsite it is late in the day, and I have just enough daylight to set up the tent and filter water. Checklist arrives in good spirits and we roast brats over a fire to end our day.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652763,"(The ""head of the bed"")The sun dawns on another perfect day. The morning is crisp but not cold, the afternoon sunny but not too warm, the ground is dry beneath our feet, and a nice breeze drifts across our faces and keeps us feeling fresh. In other words, it is an ideal hiking day. 
We set off casually at 8:30am, determined not to exhaust ourselves by putting in a long day. Several towns sit 30 and 40 miles away, and with enough food for two days there is no need to rush. We talk while walking, laughing at each other and in good spirits at the weather and the day. At the bottom of the first hill we arrive at a road, where a sign points to a small stand 50 yards away. The stand houses a trash can, some dry snacks, and an eclectic red refrigerator filled with drinks, candy, ice cream, and farm eggs. Delighted to see fresh eggs, we purchase 6 large ones to fry for an early lunch. I munch on an ice cream bar while Checklist slides the freshly scrambled eggs on top of our avocado toast. The stand operates using the honor system, and I snap a picture of a Venmo account pasted on the door of the fridge so I can pay for our bounty later. The stand also has a hiker log book, which we sign, following our now well-established custom. Our recent consistency has left us closer to several familiar faces. Hot Feet & Pony are two days ahead of us, as is Gazelle. Chef Decker was here yesterday, along with Bach and Fiddy. It is invigorating to be so close to thru-hikers we know, even if we only met them once or twice. We linger long enough at the provided picnic table that Pop Tart catches up to us. He is as excited as we were to see the treats, and we leave him with his head in the fridge.
Despite the nice weather, the day's terrain is filled with ups and downs, and we are constantly working hard to get miles behind us. We are thankful that we decided on a short day, a high mileage day would be rather painful with this type of trail. Chef Decker apparently thinks so too, because in a trailside log we read that she is suffering with shin splints and plans to get off for several days. 
The last climb is the most difficult of the day, but we take our time and make it to the top of Becket Mountain. It is only 5pm but we find a spot off trail and pitch our tent. Stealth camping is technically not allowed in Massachusetts and up until now we have been good, but the next shelter is five miles away and would make for a hard day. Besides, pressing on would ruin our plans for tomorrow.

I wistfully pull myself away from the coziness of my sleeping bag to retrieve our food bags. It is quiet and still outside . . . the only noise in the darkness is the hum of our iso-butane stove as it warms instant coffee combined with hot chocolate. When the mixture is hot I wake Checklist and we pass the pot back and forth, taking sips and trying our best to shake off the drowsiness that pleads for more sleep. 
By 5am the first lights of day are creeping across the landscape. As we walk up the trail in this strange time I can't help but feel a sense of belonging. Of course we both look forward to returning to our lives beyond the trail, but the AT has become something familiar and comfortable; we no longer feel like strangers here. 
6 miles in we stop at October Mountain shelter for breakfast, which consists of granola, oatmeal, Carnations, and some Fritos. The time is 8:30am. We are on schedule.
Our next leg takes longer, and we begin to stall several miles before Dalton, MA. We stop for a late lunch and munch on tuna and chips. Captain Jack, Copper, and Turn-Around pass us slackpacking south. I can only guess that several zeros have put us on equal playing field once again. As we finish lunch a friendly face appears coming up the trail. It is Mr. Clean, who we last saw in North Carolina. He took a week off and hopped back on just in time to bump into us. He seems as tickled as we are to see someone familiar, and he waits for us to pack up so we can hike into town together. He sets a quick pace but we are able to keep up and distract ourselves with conversation. By 3:15pm we have arrived in Dalton with 17 miles behind us.
As we enter town we pass a residence on our left with a flower bed full of trekking poles. The poles are the owner's way of showing he is friendly to hikers, and the hiker box and log book on his porch reinforce this display of hospitality. A cooler full of free cold drinks invites us to stay and pitch our tent in his back yard, but we make time only for a soda before moving on. The last mountain is a beast, but we slowly chug up to the top. Mr. Clean joins us just below the crest; he has decided to join us and make his day a long one. We all hike together as the afternoon turns to evening, taking turns leading and setting the pace. Mr. Clean knows much of what is happening with our friends farther up the trail, and we catch up on all the latest trail news. His company brings us solidly into Cheshire, MA by 8:00pm; where a town campsite offers a grassy lawn, bikes, water, and electricity. 
Checklist and I set up our tent before grabbing bikes and riding a blissful mile to a gas station, where we browse through shelves for something resembling supper. When this fails we ride across the street to Dollar General, where we pick out a half gallon of ice cream and some microwave food. Bounty in hand, we return to the gas station and use their microwave to make dinner. Afterwards, we bike back to the campsite and crawl into our tent. We have hiked exactly a full marathon today, our biggest day yet! Tomorrow morning my phone will stay on silent, and we will wake up when our eyes decide to open.

""Coffee! Coffee! Who wants Coffee?!"" are the words that awake me from a deep slumber. A local has brought snacks and hot coffee for everyone to enjoy and is thoughtlessly forcing everyone else to conform to a 6:30am wake up time. As I stumble groggily from the tent he greets me with: ""Hey ładny włosy you want some coffee!?"" The words are Polish for ""Pretty Hair"" and the local is evidently known up and down the trail as the Polish Hermit who frequents the Father Tom Campsite. From the other hikers' reactions to his enthusiasm I would guess he is rather polarizing in nature. He seems to have swayed Checklist favorably with the coffee and mugs to drink out of. By 8am we are the only ones left in the campsite, and we relax for an hour before moving out - the previous day's marathon wearing fresh on our bodies. 
The plan for the day is simple in word but difficult in deed: get over Mount Greylock. Mount Greylock is the highest peak in Massachusetts at nearly 3500 ft above sea level. The long staggering climb up and down it lasts 15 miles and should take us the bulk of the day. In addition, water is scarce and only available at several locations well off-trail. We decide to carry water only for the climb up; water from the lodge on top of the mountain should get us down.
The ascent has several steep inclines, but after all is said the mountain can be conquered like anything else. I arrive at the top first, where a large stone tower stands as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of World War 1. Slightly down and to the left of the tower sits the Bascom Lodge, yet another structure built by the CCC. I trudge over to the latter building only to find they are closed because it is Tuesday (obviously). Chagrined because I should have known this already, I plod wearily back over to the tower and open a jar of peanut butter to assuage my worries. We are low on water and the only thing I can come up with is a yogi from the few tourists coming up the mountain road for a quick picture. 
Before I can carry out this plan I am greeted by a SOBO hiker, who informs me that a local man is doing trail magic in the parking lot just beyond the tower. I hurriedly stash the peanut butter and rush over to find a mother load of snacks, drinks, and goodies.  ""Bacon Wrap"" is all out of hamburgers and hotdogs, but he offers me some chili over chips to go with the abundance of treats. Unsure where Checklist is, I fill my water bottles and walk back to the tower in search of her. I find her at the top of the lookout, having climbed the 89 spiral steps to get there. She follows me down to the parking lot to get her fair share of goodies. 
Water problem solved for the time being, we speed down the other side of the mountain. A rainstorm is coming and we want to get wherever it is that we are going quickly. Making plans on the fly we arrive on the outskirts of town still unsure of what we should do. A nearby house typically offers bikes to hikers, but when we knock on the door we are told the bikes were stolen recently (not by a hiker). The resident trail angel offers to drive us to where we want to go instead, so we gratefully ride to the local Y protected from the starting drizzle by the shell of a Toyota RAV4. At the Y we take quick showers and get as clean as one can when one must re-wear stinky clothes. Afterwards our trail angel takes us to the local supermarket so we can resupply. It is 9pm and dark by the time we are finished shopping. I feel akin to a homeless bum as I munch on a deli sub from the shelter of the store awning. We are bedraggled and tired as we walk the half mile back to the trailhead in the dark. The first legal campsite is two miles up the hill but we only make it a quarter of the way before settling for a flat patch of ground just off trail. Right when we get into the tent the rain opens up with a drenching downpour, making us giddily glad to be dry yet. Satisfied with the day and exhausted by the effort of it all we abandon our normal chores and lapse into Dreamland.

At the second wake, the weather has lightened but is still persistently drizzling. Noting Checklist's tired face I determine to allow for a late morning. A weather check shows the rain won't stop until 9am anyway. 
At 8:30am we are both startled awake by a pounding on the rainfly and an angry woman's voice. ""You aren't supposed to be here! This is private property! You're right under the #!$!ing sign!"" ""Sorry"" is all I  can manage as I sit up and try to shake the cobwebs from my brain. ""Get moving!"" is the unforgiving retort.

In general we have found less smiles and less waves here than anywhere else on the trail thus far. 
It takes several miles and a milestone for us to put this unpleasant feeling behind us. The milestone comes in the form of the Massachusetts/Vermont State Line, which is where the AT joins paths with the Long Trail for about 100 miles (before the two part ways). We snap a picture and continue on, stopping only for water breaks and shelter logs. Many of the entries in the log books are hikers starting the Long Trail, which traces its way through Vermont and is close to 300 miles in length. Hot Feet and Pony are now just a day ahead, as is Gazelle.   
We won't catch them anytime soon, because we are planning to hop off tonight and spend several days with Checklist's sister, who lives about an hour away. The days off have the added benefit of getting us out of the rainstorms this weekend and our pace is likewise quickened thinking of the safety that awaits us tonight. Our walking is aided by the conversation of several LASHERS (Long A## Section Hikers ): ""The Doppler"" & ""Queue"" are a married couple that can relate to our slow and steady pace and the quirks of being married on the trail, and ""Lampshade"" is a smiling Georgian with a straw hat and a slow drawl. We trade off hiking with the three of them and make it to VT 9 with Lampshade before dark, where a local trail angel is waiting to take our three friends to the safety of a hotel. He kindly offers us cold drinks while we wait for our ride. The Doppler and Queue make it down the last hill fifteen minutes later; Queue is nursing a tweaked ankle and looks exhausted at the effort of the steep descent.
Shortly thereafter Checklist's sister arrives and we all part ways, unsure if we will meet again in the near future. Checklist hasn't seen her sister in over a year, so the ride back is filled with happy chatter. We make it to our home for the next few days and munch on pizza and ice cream before calling it a night. Our recent hiking regime has left us both with depleted energy reserves so we plan to do our best to recharge the next few days for a final push through Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652767,"(tea, a book, and a chair. All great ways to spend a zero day)Even though there is nothing that would require I leave my bed, my internal clock wakes me at 6am and makes it clear I need to get up when I try to doze at 8am. It somehow just feels wrong to sleep in so long. ""What are you doing! It's time to get miles in!"" my mind yells. Little does it know what is coming. Thus far on our journey we have taken only 4 zeros, a rather low amount considering how long we've been out here compared to some others. Now that we've made it to Vermont and Checklist's sister we are planning to take 4 more straight zeros. I am interested to see the effects such a long break will have on us physically and mentally. We've heard from other thru-hikers that after several days off trail it becomes difficult to work up the steam to get back on. It only seems fitting to try it for ourselves and see how it goes.
Checklist's sister has a lovely little cottage in the rural countryside that houses (besides herself) two dogs, two rabbits, and an adorable kitten. Since we arrived early to miss the rain, she has to work most of the day today. When we hobble over to the main house from where she has us comfortably housed in a spacious yurt, we are greeted by the makings of breakfast laid out on the stove. Our bodies want nothing more than to lazy, so we lounge around on cozy armchairs and read books. Checklist's sister shares many of our stylistic preferences and tastes, and the house reflects that with eclectic themes of JRR Tolkien and Beatrice Potter. Houseplants line the walls, oriental rugs adorn the floors, and various antiques take up residence on shelves. The house is a veritable haven that plays to our need for rest. Instead of turning on the TV we watch the cat and dogs play on the living room floor. The time flys by and before we know it Checklist's sister is home. She takes us down the road to a mom&pop country restaurant, where we enjoy ourselves immensely over BLTs and Reubens. Afterwards we return to the house and catch up on life until way past hiker midnight (8pm).

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653021,"(Skene Manor)Another beautiful day with not a mile to hike. It is fascinating to watch the struggle between what I want to do (sleep in) and what I am used to doing (not sleeping in). I drift in and out of sleep from 6am until 9am. I am making every attempt possible to gain back the hours of lost sleep spread out across many late nights and early mornings. When we saunter over to the main house Checklist's sister is in the same sort of mood after a week of work, and we make a light breakfast and then sit around lazily for an hour or two. Unsurprisingly, what gets me out of my chair is a trip to the local creamery for fresh homemade ice cream. After that caloric jumpstart we head out on a day trip. First we stuff our rancid clothes in washers at a local laundromat, then we make a pleasant drive through rolling hills to a place called Skene Manor. The massive castle-like building has been placed on the National Registry of Historical Buildings because of its rich history and unique appearance. We take advantage of free tours and wander through countless parlors and sitting rooms while a guide inserts interesting tidbits of history into our perspective. 
An hour or two of time spent thus, we meander back to the truck and drive back to where our laundry is now clean. A frenzied trip to the supermarket next door secures our food for the next few days, and we return home with an abundance of bounty. We spend some time hanging clean clothes on the line to dry, it is our hope that the outside air will do what a dryer cannot in the face of a months-of-hiking stench. Our tent, pads, and sleeping bags were handled the same way this morning and have improved greatly. 
I get ready for a meal tomorrow by marinading chicken and chopping ingredients for Pico de Gallo. I've craved foods from Qdoba - where I used to work - for a long time now, so I am thrilled to finally get the chance to make it with the aid of an actual kitchen. Checklist's sister shows us how to make Eggs Benedict so we devour the tasty dish as breakfast for supper. Another day has flown by, I have the suspicion that several consecutive zero days may not be as difficult as I thought they would be.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653022,"(A plate of epic-ness!)While my journal may have suffered slightly from the amount of zero days we're taking, our bodies most definitively have not. Checklist puts it aptly when she quips ""I think I could lie in bed all day"". I have no idea what it will be like to try and acclimate back to the trail come Monday morning, but for now we will soak up what rest we can. Checklist's sister makes us a breakfast of a Finnish Pancake, which is a large airy sheet cake that feels like a cross between a custard and a souffle. Then she surprises us with a trip to a local amusement park that's main attraction is an Alpine slide. Picture a sled with wheels with a handle in the middle. Pulling back on the handle reduces speed, pushing forward accelerates it. The wheeled sled follows a sort of hard plastic slide down the side of the mountain. There are no seatbelts, and no rails to keep the sleds on the track. Wrecks happen frequently when someone gets to reckless with his/her handle. The liability litigation is obviously much different here than in Indiana. It's easy to take a tumble too: Stratton Mountain is in view nearly the entire way down the slide, and three tracks make it a little too easy to get competitive. I make it most of the day without a crash, but towards the end I take a tumble and skin up a knee and elbows. Checklist escapes unscathed but her sister is adorned with scrapes like mine. Most of the day is spent riding up the chairlift and sliding down the mountain, but the park also has a giant swing, a climbing wall, 360 degree bikes, a spider climb, and a basketball shootout where the loser gets drenched with water. 
On the way back home we stop at the first marble quarry in the US (no longer a working quarry) where jumping off the marble cliffs into deep pools of water is popular. I indulge in the pastime and take a dip off a 15 footer. Tired but happy after a day of non-hiking fun, we return to the house where I grill some chicken for a Qdoba copycat meal.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653023,"(Cliff-jumping from yesterday)Today is our last day of vacation before we return to . . . well . . . vacation. The day starts off pleasantly sunny but then turns gloomy and rainy. This is a welcome development; I would much rather the storms assail us while we aren't on the trail. After the busy fun of yesterday we rest and take naps throughout the day. Sometime in the afternoon we collect our things and follow our individual routines to pack our bags. I have experimented with a variety of packing styles and have now arrived at one that suits me well. If my food bag is full and heavy, it goes at the bottom of my backpack. If it is lighter (and smaller) I put it on top of everything else so as to make it easily accessible. My sleeping bag and sleeping pad get stuffed side by side into the main compartment of the pack, then various bags of gear and clothing fill the gaps around and on top. My part of the tent (the part without poles) gets strapped onto the bottom of the pack. This makes the tent  the first thing to come off when we pitch camp and the last to get packed when we leave camp. Everything else has an assigned place in one of the smaller outside pockets. This all done, we are ready for an early departure tomorrow morning.
Somewhere several months ago when I was going through the initial throes of starvation, I would often have random and bizarre cravings. Several times I would picture myself in my kitchen at home spending hours making something extremely particular. At one point I expressed to Checklist my desire to make a Plumped Raisin Cake. ""Have you ever heard of a Plumped Raisin Cake?"" she queried me confusedly. ""No, but I still want to make one""  was my cheery reply. Now the women humor my craving, and we make a proper plumped raisin cake. Plumped raisins - for those not experienced in the complex art - involves soaking raisins in hot or boiling water so that they regain some of their original juiciness. This in turn keeps the dried fruits from sucking moisture from the cake. The cake is a hit, and we all retire to our beds early in preparation for the trail (or work) tomorrow.

For the first time in several days I get up at my normal wake-up time of 6am. Checklist and I throw our bags in the back of her sister's pickup truck and we make the hour drive back to the trailhead, stopping only for donuts and breakfast empanadas. At the trailhead we wave farewell to our trail angel sister and return to our primal lives. Each step feels new and strange. Our bodies - and our feet in particular - seem unsure of how to respond to this sudden return to a past life. The first mountain helps them make up their mind: they don't want to take this anymore. Besides their unheeded protests we find ourselves well and able to carry on. 
The day takes us up and over Glastenbury Mountain, a long climb stunted with steep uphill sections. On the way down the other side we decide on a short day to ease our return to the trail, so we stop at the next shelter in anticipation of a secluded tent site. Alas, the few tent sites that exist at this accursed shelter are already occupied, so we get water for the night and push on. Several tenths of mile later we spot a flat plateau several hundred feet off trail. We struggle through the underbrush and arrive at a passable spot that needs only a bit of clearing to be operable. Nearby broken branches and root stumps in the ground indicate other hikers have slept here before.  
Late in the day I am awakened from a light sleep by loud noises in the distance. I lie still hoping the intrusion will recede, but it grows closer instead. When it finally is near enough as to be impossible to ignore any longer, I poke my head out of the tent flap to see what the ruckus is about. A fully grown black bear ambles into view just a stone's throw away (bear count - 7). I know without a doubt that he is here because of the food at my feet, and I am filled with a level of consternation that I haven't reached previous to this point. If I yell and he isn't bothered, what is my backup plan? I give the classic shout: ""Hey Bear!"" and he takes off in the opposite direction. The disturbance awakes Checklist from her nap, and causes some due worry from both of us.  This is the first time we have seen a bear at night and it isn't an enjoyable experience. We have hear many stories of bears that return in the middle of the night because they know food is in the area. I trek several hundred yards away from the tent and hang our food on a large tree using the reliable PCT method. When I return to the tent Checklist is asleep again, and I am left to imagine a bear pacing in every night sound. As I write these words I sincerely hope we will have no further bear incidents tonight. They may result in an interesting journal but they make for some poor sleep.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653027,"(A beaver pond, one of many)To our enormous relief, we are not visited by a bear in the middle of the night. What's more, our food bags made it through unscathed. The temperatures were perfection, all the bumps were in the right spot, and we slept soundly and deeply until the morning. With such a private spot we have no inclination to get an early spot. After weeks of clipping along we have decided a change of pace is in order. While it was fun to put in miles and catch our more zero-inclined thru hiking friends, the exchange just wasn't worth it. We hardly ever had time left at the end of the day, and we always felt like we were running to reach the end and collapse. With the insane elevation gains of New Hampshire in our sights, we are going to take it down a notch and try to enjoy these last weeks on the AT.
After a slow morning we rumble out of camp and start up trail, determined to make a decent showing. We hike with two Long Trail thru hikers for the first part of the day; they are just a few of the large amount we've seen since entering Vermont. The two trails will split in another 50 miles or so but for now the two groups share the comaraderie of the experienced and the upcoming. We play the role of coaches and counselors, offering advice on gear, food, and mileage. 
The day has several notable highlights: we pass a beaver dam - no beavers make a showing but we already checked a beaver sighting off our list a week ago - and climb over Stratton Mountain. The latter is adorned with a lookout tower on top that offers 360 degree views out over the treetops. At the bottom of this climb we reach a footbridge over a stream and reach a mutual understanding that our day has reached a close. A shelter is only two-tenths of a mile further on but it is the first of a handful of Vermont shelters to charge a fee for overnighting hikers. Since we both would rather sleep in our tent for free, we search the banks of the stream until we find where past generations of thru-hikers agree. Happy and comfortable on a bed of pine needles, we crawl into bed and let nature turn off the lights.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653345,"(Stratton Pond)Our tent site last night was one of the best yet. Soft pine needles were a great start, but the site also boasted a slight downhill grade and adjacency to water. On top of that, it was private and aesthetically appealing. This recipe for success resulted in a fantastic night's sleep, and we are able to wake up early as a result. The trail is free from any major obstacles and has a slight downhill grade for over ten miles, which means we can make great time all morning. Vermont is typically referred to as ""Vermud"" by thru hikers because of how soggy and unpleasant it can be. This year, a lack of rain has left the trail mostly free from the usual bogs, leaving a nice track with only the occasional root and rock to avoid. 
Somewhere in the mid-morning we catch up to a woman who we passed at the end of the day several days ago. She identifies herself as a flip flop thru hiker named ""All Good"". After several miles of pleasant conversation we run into another flip flopper named ""Spyder"". Spyder is contemplating what to get for a resupply in town and is delighted when Checklist offers her a sheet of paper and stack of colored pens (to make a checklist!). We still feel fresh so after a quick break we leave our new friends behind and hike up to the Spruce Peak Shelter. The shelter is a fully enclosed building with a wood stove, a porch, and glass windows. I can only imagine how awesome it would be to stumble into this place after a long snowy day!
Checklist gets a headstart out of the shelter so by the time I leave it is several minutes later. I see a familiar face at where the shelter side trail intersects the AT but it takes me a second to place. It is Bushwhacker, who I never thought we'd see again. He took a week off with shin splints and is now back on trail. I follow his speedy pace as he talks about the frustration of having his shins give out when the rest of him is doing so well. He has already done nearly 20 miles and it is only noon . . . no wonder his shins gave out. 
We catch up to Checklist first, then the three of us catch up to All Good. Normal hiking paces cause a natural division and Bushwhacker and I arrive at the trailhead first. Trail magic is waiting in the form of a pile of sodas on the ground; a bag with emptied cans is hanging from the trail sign as evidence of happy hikers before us. Checklist and All Good show up and we all swig the sugary drinks together. Bushwhacker's wife is here at the trailhead with their truck camper, and she doles out mini oranges and ice cold waters. Our plan was to hitch to Manchester for lunch, but through a typical trail twist we don't even need to put up a thumb. All Good has a friend who is picking her up here, and we are coerced (didn't take much) into joining the carpool. In town we stop at the outfitter for a fuel canister -which we find in the hiker box - and a Katadyn BeFree water filter. The flow in mine has dwindled to a trickle and a replacement has been a long time in coming. We bump into Mr. Clean at the outfitter; he recently took several days off to recover from some heel pain and is getting back on tomorrow. He seems happy to see familiar faces again and we take a minute to welcome him back to the hiking world. A stop at the Avocado Pit fills our bellies with burritos and our devices with juice, then its on to the bookstore (yes the bookstore!) where I pick out a book for the trail. 
As we sit just outside the bookstore a car swings to the curb and a friendly voice yells: ""Hey, you guys need trail magic!"".  We hop in the car for a ride back to the trail head and meet our kind trail angel who has driven 45 minutes into town just to see if any hikers wanted a ride. Her daughter hiked the trail several years ago but now lives in New Zealand, so this is her way of connecting to her daughter. We are the happy benefactors, and we get back on trail still confounded at the smoothness of the detour. Two more miles bring us to Bromley Shelter, where we set up our home on a tent platform and relax for the few remaining hours of daylight. Mice live under the platform, and their frequent and visible visits to the overworld prompt us to hang both our food bags and our backpacks. Another gorgeous day of breeze and sunshine; we are soaking it up!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653346,"(Mr. Clean at Little Rock Pond)Instant oatmeal has become the de facto choice for breakfast these days. It isn't our favorite when it comes to taste - and I stopped enjoying it about a month back - but it is hard to beat when it comes to general nutrition compared to weight and price. It definitely takes a step up whenever we have some butter to add . . . which we don't this morning. In any case we shovel the stuff down and get moving, hesitating only for a passing sprinkle that decides to mostly miss us. 
We climb steeply for a mile up to the top of Bromley Mountain. This mountain is the same one we were sledding down on Alpine sleds just a few days ago. Now we summit it and take in the windy views. In the winter months a ski resort dominates this area, but right now hikers can take advantage of their absence and overnight in the ski-warming hut. Optimus Grime is in the early stages of packing up when we stumble into the hut. He hiked past us late last night and is now getting a late start. He is his normal chill self and greets us agreeably. He tells us Florida Man is only about 20 miles behind and may catch us in a day or two. We hike on for another mile or two before getting hailed from behind by Mr. Clean, who started from the Manchester trailhead this morning. We hike with him up to Peru Peak Shelter, where we stop for a quick break. Mr. Clean is feeling down and not like hiking today, but he jokes that we are returning the favor of last time we met (where he helped us finish off our marathon day). This time around it is we who are helping him push through a slump.
Our conversation helps us churn through miles quicker, and we end up getting several miles further than originally planned. The prize is a nice shelter next to the most pristine mountain pond I've ever seen. Nestled in the mountains, the water of this oasis is crystal clear and delicious to the taste (we still filtered it of course). I swim out past where my feet touch bottom and am shocked to note that I can still clearly see my kicking feet and the rocks beneath. Mr. Clean is happy too; he soaks his feet in the cool water to soothe the soreness of a long day.

Vermont has proven itself a great tenting state. The views thus far have been few and far between, but the amazing water sources and soft pine needles make up for that and then some. Of course this morning we have Little Rock Pond to enjoy as well. The morning light dances across the water and makes me wish we were spending a weekend here. Mr. Clean loafs by the water too, as if soaking it up (no pun intended). He confesses that he is still feeling a bit down and will stay with us today for motivational purposes. We set out together and make 6 slow miles by lunchtime. Checklist and I are completely out of food save for some protein & peanut butter powder that her sister gave her. We mix it with some water and force it down, in the hopes that it will give us enough energy to make it another six miles to a road crossing. We went a little too light on food again and are now paying the price in pre-town hunger. Mr. Clean still has plenty of food but contemplates our loud his thoughts of getting off with us for a break and shoe change. 
Several miles later I stop at a shelter and meet several thru hikers who left Georgia several weeks after we did. Their names are  ""Jeb"" and ""Couscous"". These two guys are currently hiking with Couscous' dad, which means lower days but hotel stays. They typically do bigger days than what they are doing right now, which means we will probably see them again once they pick it back up.
Several more hungry miles get us to VT 103, a bustling highway that is our ticket to Rutland. Mr. Clean is right on our tails, and offers to treat us to a shuttle upon arriving. A hitch would definitely be doable here but we aren't going to look a gift horse in the mouth so we collapse in the soft trailhead grass to wait for our ride. The ride appears in the form of an amiable man named Tom, who seems to fit the description of trail angel more than shuttle driver. When we pitch out loud the idea of spending the night at a donation-based hostel in town he offers us his guest room instead. Mr. Clean opts to spend his zero day at a Days Inn, so Tom drops him off first. By this time our brains have processed the offer and we have exchanged sufficient subtle nonverbal cues. ""We'll take you up on that guest room if you're sure it isn't a bother"" I venture. ""Not at all! Where do you want to go first!"" is the hearty reply. Tom proceeds to take us to a local Five Guys burger joint, where he enjoys a shake and watches us consume a small mountain of food. Then he joins us as we shop for a resupply across the street. After today's hunger I throw caution to the wind and grab anything that tickles my fancy. Finally, he takes us to his house, which is a well kept establishment in the middle of a suburban Vermont neighborhood. 
His house is a brick and mortar outpouring of his thru hike in 2003 and is an amazing place that welcomes and intrigues its guests. Tom is a natural historian and book-lover, and his 6,000+ volume library overflows neatly across all areas in the house. He has numerous collections of everything from war memorabilia to a antique porcelain kitchen set. Despite the vast amounts of items in his house, he and his wife (who is gone on a trip) keep a pleasantly clean and charming place. While we are settling in, he offers to slack us tomorrow over Mount Killington, Vermont's largest AT mountain. It doesn't take but a second to accept. We both take long hot showers and bask in the luxury of cleanliness. Tom makes a quick phone call to a friend and then suggests we get ready to go. We are confused but we slip on our shoes and follow him back to the car. Fifteen minutes later we pull into a parking spot at the ""Inn at Long Trail"", a well known hiker spot with an attached Irish Pub. Tom comes here often to enjoy good food and live music, and he has decided to bring us for a night of fun. One of his friends named Dan is here as well, and the four of us get a table together. I order Irish soda bread with turkey, apples, and swiss. Checklist opts for a Shepherd's Pie. Dan and Tom along with another couple farther up trail together form an unofficial off-the-books AT support team. They have been supporting, hosting, and slackpacking  hikers for over two decades. Dan lives in the town north of here and is the next link in their proverbial chain. He is a fun-loving guy who has spent his life as a master craftsman. Specifically, he restores old buildings and has restored over a dozen state capitol buildings, done work on the Statue of Liberty, and dabbled in other historic buildings all over the country. Tom himself has lived all over the world during his 24 year stint in the Army. Both men are full of stories, and the air is merry with laughter and legend. The Irish musician is brilliant as well, and we hear everything from ""The Times they are A'Changin'"" to ""What a Wonderful World"" to ""all the random Irish folk songs you've never heard of"". We don't leave the pub until 9:30pm, and the music is still playing as we leave. I (surprisingly) enjoyed my time at the pub but am thankful to be back at Tom's house winding down for the night. The day has taken such an unforeseeable twist! I was planning on tenting but instead I'm in a bed next to an air conditioner with cheesecake in the fridge! What a great day!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653348,"(Part of Tom's multi-room library)Tom's guest room has the huge perk of a separate air conditioning unit . . . which means we can sleep cool while he can sleep warm. We wake up feeling extra ready for a day of hiking. It might help that for the first time we will be returning to the same place for a second night's stay! It is so easy to just put what we need for the day (lunch, phone, camera) in day packs and leave the rest of our stuff unorganized and unpacked. Tom obviously understands hiker hunger, because he makes homemade waffles until we can't eat any more. Then he takes us down to the trailhead and lets us loose, promising to pick us up when we come out the other side.
The days starts with a steep climb that is made easier by the common slackpacking feeling of being pushed from behind. We stop in at the first shelter a mile in and are pleasantly surprised to find Florida Man inside with two other thru-hikers: ""Bad Dinner"" and ""Bushwhack"" (not to be confused with Bushwhacker). Florida Man is happy to see us but is currently suffering with an upset stomach that had him puking in the privy earlier. They are planning to walk the mile south back to the road so they can get to town and take a zero day. Bad Dinner understandably knows all about us and has heard countless stories from Florida Man. We fall into easy conversation and he gives us tips on hiking the Whites in New Hampshire. 
We leave them and push on, our pace strong but relaxed. The lighter load leaves us the mental and physical room to make consistent conversation without added effort, so we spend several miles talking about our plans after the trail. One thing that has been weighing on both of us is staying in relatively good shape after the trail. We've heard horror stories of how thru-hiker appetites don't stop for the first few weeks, thereby contributing to the destruction of the lean machine it took 2,200 miles to build. Our current plan is to eat all we want, but to avoid carbs and sugars for a while.
As we begin to climb up to Mount Killington the already brisk weather takes a windy and cold turn for the worse. We have worn our fleeces since starting but now they feel thin and inadequate. As we near the top our hands and ears get chilled by the icy blasts. We duck into a mostly enclosed shelter just below the summit to get warm and eat our lunch. The respite doesn't help the shivering much so we quicken our pace down the mountain to warmer weather. The last miles are less demanding than usual since we have a ride back to a warm bed to look forward to. Tom's house is a quick drive from the trailhead and we are back to safety in the blink of an eye. I order pizza for the night's supper and Tom pulls some ice cream bars out of the freezer for dessert. We watch trivia quiz shows on the big screen and Tom tells stories about his days in the military and his days helping AT hikers. 
Tom reminds me of Bob Peoples; besides holding us spellbound for hours there is simply something about Tom that is special. He is gruff and kind at the same time. He is unbelievably generous but is practical enough to only venture a mild protest when I offer to fill his gas tank. He is meticulously clean and organized and keeps an up to date catalog of his massive library. He laughs easily and often, and is fond of the phrase ""a good ole' boy"" to describe those men he likes or gets along with. He adores his cat ""Dorian Grey"" but feeds her strictly at 8am and 5pm. He makes me think good of the military, at least as it was when he joined. Tom is just one of the many amazing people who we've met while on this journey, but like the others, he holds a unique place in our memory going forward.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653349,"(Tom likes the AT so much he had it built into the side of his house!)We wake up to a breakfast of fresh pancakes with Vermont Maple Syrup. Tom has a special pan that toasts four pancakes at once and he is churning out the crispy circles as soon as we sit down at the table. Afterwards he cleans up the kitchen while we put everything back into our Osprey backpacks. I take pictures of the various curiosities that I want to remember in Tom's house, like the magnetic chess board affixed to the wall facing the toilet. Then we hop into his vehicle for the last time and make the trip to the trailhead he picked us up from yesterday. He seems sad to see us go and tells us we have a place to stay anytime we return to the area. 
Back on trail we hike a mile to the Maine Junction, where the Long Trail leaves the AT and continues north to the Canada Border. The Appalachian Trail turns right and heads towards Hanover, New Hampshire. Rootseeker catches us here and pushes ahead as he talks. He has separated from The Tyvek Shaman and is now hiking solo for the time being. We are in the mood for a short day and make no move to keep up. We stroll down the winding pathway to the Gifford Woods State Park, a well run situation that is only aided by the beautiful weather today. We stop into the park office and check the hiker box to find someone has left a 10 dollar bill . . . Hoorray! The day is looking brighter all the time!
A mile after the state park we stop at Mountain Meadow Lodge just off trail to check their hiker box. The lady at the front desk apologizes and tells us they don't have one any longer, but she offers the use of the facilities. In addition, she walks down the hall and returns with four bottles of water, bags of granola, and muffins she made for breakfast that morning. We thank her profusely for the booty and head to the back porch to enjoy the spoils. A Cornhole board and horseshoe pit distract us from the trail, as does a comfortable hammock overlooking Kent Pond. 
The last batch of miles take us up and over Quimby Mountain, which proves to be harder than we thought it would. At the shelter on the other side we find limited camping and no nearby water, so we press on at the suggestion of a Southbound section hiker, who tells us of brook-side tent sites half a mile away. A lady named ""Hot Foot"" joins us in our search for something better; she is out for several days and is glad for our company. At the bottom of the hill we find the prophesied brook and campsites and spread out to respective flat spots. Checklist and I roast brats over a fire and Hot Foot comes over to ask for story time. We tell her about our adventures until supper is over; then I show her how to hang her food PCT style so we can all go to bed.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653350,"(A cabin with a lookout)Sleeping next to a babbling brook is one of my favorite ways to spend a night. Something about the rushing water just makes falling asleep and waking up that much more pleasant. Hot Foot added her food bag to our hang last night for sale of convenience and I leave it on the ground where she can see it when I get ours for breakfast. The start of the day is predictably a climb, the first one a series of three short bursting ups that end at viewless peaks. With full packs these hills feel tougher than they should, especially considering they are dwarfed by the New Hampshire mountains coming up. The largest mountain we climb today has almost a 1000 foot elevation gain in about a mile and a half. We will experience double that elevation gain in the same distance when we make the climb up to Mount Lafayette in NW, which is over a 6 mile climb. ""Whew"", time to get it together! 
Midway through the day we stop in at a privately owned cabin that is just off trail. The owners allow thru-hikers to overnight in the building, which also has a lookout deck built on the roof. It is sunny and breezy and we perch on top and eat lunch while looking out over the evergreen trees to the mountain ranges in the distance. 
An upside to the large amounts of food we're carrying is the full feeling in our stomachs. The downside is that in our rush to grab everything yummy we forgot to get protein or veggies. Other than the brats (which we devoured last night) we didn't get anything with a lick of protein. Meals today consist of donuts, pop tarts, honey buns, M&Ms, bagels, wafer cookies, and Oreos. That is a lot of carbs.
We arrive at VT 12 by 4pm with good spirits and tired feet. Tom introduced us to his friend Dan at the Irish pub he took us to, and now we have made it to Dan's house. He makes an appearance when we rap on his door and beckons to a sprawling lawn next to a stream. We set up our tent and relax on lawn chairs Dan provides. We walk down the road a tenth of a mile to a farm store and find that it is closed today. The owner is pulling weeds out front and kindly offers to open just for us. We pick out fresh mozzarella, a dozen eggs, a pint of ice cream (obviously), a pound of butter, and a half liter of chocolate milk. Back in Dan's yard we fry up the eggs as best we can and eat them with dollups of the fresh cheese. Dan comes out and offers to slack us tomorrow to another trail angel farther up the trail. Of course this means trusting our backpacks to an essential stranger, but we don't hesitate. Funny how far we've come. When it is the sum of your day-to-day existence I suppose you get good at sizing people up in a glance. Back in the tent I snack on M&Ms and read my book as the brook plays in the background.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653922,"(Karaoke night on the trail)The night in Dan's yard went surprisingly well, and we wake up relaxed and rested. Dan provides coffee for a bit of early energy and then exchanges a small day pack for our heavy ones. We walk back to the trail feeling light and airy, and we meet Couscous and Jeb coming up the trail from the Lookout cabin. We leapfrog for the next half dozen miles to a stream where a stash of sodas wait invitingly. We sip on the sugary drinks and then power through the last set of climbs to Hartford, VT where our packs are waiting at a trail angel's house. The tiny town (which consists basically of a central library across the gravel street) is having an open mic music night accompanied by a weekly farmer's market. 
The event is a gold mine, and we take advantage by making a beeline to a stand that is serving hot brats and sausages with grilled peppers and onions. A multitude of thru-hikers seem to appear out of nowhere and fill the front porch of our host. Dozer is the only one I recognize and he decides to push on for a quieter night. A local musician is manning the stage and inviting volunteers for karaoke. I take part by singing ""House of the Rising Sun"". This done, I retire to our tent with Checklist, who has been enjoying the pleasant library. The entire area also has free Wifi, so we watch a bit of ""Anne of Green Gables"" in our tent before bed. The rest of the thru-hikers are rather loud on the front porch and it doesn't feel like our type of place anymore. We briefly consider moving our tent farther away on the expansive lawn but decide it isn't worth the hassle. It is a trade-off really: the comforts of electricity, food, and Wifi in exchange for the serenity of the woods. 
In any case it has been a good day made much easier by Dan's kindness. Vermont has been a blast. The state is very geographically diverse and I've been amazed at the sudden transitions from thick forests populated with red pine to grassy fields sprinkled liberally with wildflowers. The people have been interested in what we're doing and eager to help us on our way. It doesn't feel real to be this far north. New Hampshire is tomorrow and I am so excited for it! I didn't honestly know for sure if we could make it this far . . . Now I do.

We are awoken prematurely by giggling girls packing up gear for an early start. For some reason they felt compelled to move their tents closer to us . . . perhaps they felt safer next to each other and the couple. In any case we are up when they are, but we don't have to get out of the tent . . . so we don't. Once everyone is gone we pack up and head to Linda's front porch where she has coffee waiting. While we are making small talk (aka trail talk) over steaming cups of caffeine another thru-hiker walks up. Neither Checklist or I recognize him until he introduces himself. It is Steve-O, an ex special forces who last we heard was traveling with several other go-getters. Like us, he has decided to slow his pace and take this last fifth of the trail easy. We leave him to enjoy the coffee and get moving. 
The miles pass quickly and are mild compared to what is coming up. Before we know it we are rounding the street corner in Norwich, VT and looking down upon the Connecticut River, which ironically marks the border between Vermont and New Hampshire. Steve-O catches us here and we walk across the bridge into the second to last state together. Steve-O is from Colorado and so we put him through our usual questionnaire to learn more about his state. We split ways at Dartmouth College - he is planning to stay at a nearby hostel - and walk down to the bus stop. The bakery across the street offers a free pastry to thru-hikers so we ride to the outfitters with several large cookies in hand. After nearly 1800 miles my Keen shoes are beginning to feel painful. They are holding a reasonable shape still, but the soles simply are giving up.
At the outfitter I settle on a pair of Salomon Trail Runners. Hopefully they won't make a bad thing worse; I want them to last me the rest of the way. Across the street we resupply at a local grocery store for the next several days, this time making sure to get more than just carbs and sugar. Upon leaving I check the bus routes to see that all the buses are more than half an hour away. Undaunted, we walk to the edge of the grocery parking lot and hold thumbs up proudly. Several ladies loading a Tesla with groceries offer us a ride and we clamber in gratefully. We fall into easy chatter on the way back to Hanover and the driver offers us a living room floor to sleep on. With the promise of a hot shower to boot we don't hesitate to take her up on the invitation. We learn that our hostess' name is Mary and her cousin Patty is visiting in preparation for a longer trip that the two will depart for tomorrow. We arrive at the house and meet Owen, Mary's son, who just graduated highschool. The trio is extremely friendly and welcoming. Mary takes one look in the fridge and then drives down the street to a local farm stand to purchase some local brats and beef. We are treated to a full-on grill out that leaves us with bursting bellies. After supper Party announces that she will sleep in a king bed with Mary so we can have her guest bed. It is a kind gesture that is completely unexpected, and it leaves us rather in shock at the suddenness. Mary opens her pantry and fridge to us quite literally and encourages us to forage for whatever we want. She also cheerfully suggests we spend the day here tomorrow and return to the trail the following day. After talking about it privately, we decide we have to accept. We snuggle in our own king bed upstairs still reeling at the unexpected hospitality of complete strangers. I am both blessed and amazed to have met such wonderful women.

As is typical for us when we get to a real bed, we sleep like rocks on a mountaintop. In the morning we say goodbye first to Mary and Patty, leaving for their trip; and then to Owen, leaving for work. House to ourselves, we take a second shower and then retreat in different directions to unwind in our own ways. I finish my book on the living room couch, and Checklist writes letters to friends. We make a breakfast of egg sandwiches and a supper of Asian stir fry. Sometimes in the afternoon it begins to rain and Checklist convinces me to take a dip in Mary's swimming pond (pond in the Northeast means something entirely different than the slimy green bogs I'm used to). We curl up on the bed afterwards and let our muscles turn to putty atop the memory foam. 
There are so many places in the house to sit down and take a load off; at times we wander through the house aimlessly as if the mere purpose of the building defies our current calling. We are used to a life of constant movement and direction, and here is a place that pleads for the sedentary. Couches, chairs, beds, and even carpeted floors; all threaten to dislodge us from our current lifestyle. Even as we idealized the Appalachian Trail while at home, so we now idealize the comfort of places to sit and lie down. Of course the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. My goal is to take the discomforts of my hike and use them to better appreciate the conveniences I take for granted.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653925,"(Chocolate cake)I stir early from the depths of memory foam. We were planning to get back on trail this morning, but I am struggling to find the motivation. Mary sent us a text last night to let us know we were welcome as long as we wanted to stay; now I am actually giving that some thought. Of course my male ego requires some rationale to forsake the pursuit of mileage today. ""We're waiting for the weather in the Whites to clear up anyway"" I reason with myself ""and another day of rest definitely won't hurt us"". Checklist requires no convincing, she is perfectly willing to rest for another day before tackling New Hampshire. Mount Moosilauke looms several days out, towering impressively over what seem like petty foothills in comparison. 
I'm surprised to find that the moment I give in and accept a second zero day, the time flies past like a train by a dairy cow. We spend much of the day in bed vegging and talking about anything and everything. This trip has brought my wife and I much closer together in many ways. Back home we spend most of our time in one another's company, but the trail has challenged us in new and unique ways. We have learned how to communicate about our pain level, our need for food or creature comforts, our trail budget, and even our daily mileage goal. These intricacies of trail life are easy to overlook, but not talking to one another about them inevitably leads to a disastrous misunderstanding. 
Sometimes in the afternoon we are relaxing on the front porch when Mary's partner Marc pulls up. We spend the evening chatting with him about his long and interesting life. Growing up he worked on the Ski Patrol for the local ski resorts, then he transitioned to construction and worked as a craftsman for many years building houses. He and I share a love for Ultimate Frisbee, a sport he played for many years past his prime. 
With two single men in the house the bachelor vibes are coming on strong. Checklist and I take on the role of housekeeper and bake a chocolate cake with a chocolate glaze and berry compote. Marc voices his love for chocolate cakes, yells upstairs to his son, and wastes no time in helping himself to a steaming piece. After supper we all go our separate ways and retire to our rooms.

You would think we would sleep in one of these zero days, but we just never can bring ourselves to spend the morning in such a fashion. There are so many conveniences to delight in, so many diversions to get lost in, and an endless array of potential items to bake or cook. Unlike the past two days, we honestly do have a good reason to get up early today . . . we have to get back around to hiking. We have taken advantage of our hosts' hospitality long enough. Checklist takes one last shower while I fry potatoes and make an omelette. Marc joins us for breakfast and then drives us back to Hanover. He is interested in our future speculations on house-building and offers his expertise as a contact. Upon arriving in town we wave goodbye and then walk down the street to the post office. My mother has mailed a large batch of cookies and I accept the extra weight happily - I doubt they'll last long. At the far end of town we stop at a grocery store for a quick brush up on our resupply from several days ago, then it is on to better and hillier things. 
Partway up the first incline we run into a middle-aged hiking couple with the pink ATC thru-hiker tags hanging off their packs. These tags (along with the Outdoor 76 buff) are the easiest way to identify a NOBO thru-hiker. We learn their names are Straps (him) and Chatterbox (her). They started at Amicalola on February 10th, just two days after we did. Somehow we have never met nor heard of them. What's more, they are traveling with a man named Boston who started the same day . . . never heard of him either! The last member in the lingering tramily we do recognize: it's T! One of our very first acquaintances on trail. We met her on day 5 on top of Cowrock Mountain, just 36 miles from Springer Mountain. Now our paths have crossed again over 1700 miles later! 
We leapfrog with this group all the way up Moose Mountain and leave them at the shelter to hike on alone. A flip flop named Crossword is at the shelter already, set up in one corner. Despite our assurances that we will see them again soon (most likely tomorrow) T insists on taking a picture of us. It is a well-known fact that post-hike, pictures of people are valued more than pictures of scenery. While we do our best to take pictures of those we meet, there are many that we simply didn't ask. In this case T should see us again, because our day ends three miles later next to a suffering stream. I attempt to soak my feet in the cold water while I still have daylight remaining but the mosquitos are heavily swarming the entire area. No matter how much bug spray I apply the little buggers drink it up along with an ungodly portion of blood (mine). Figuratively throwing my hands in the air, I retreat to the safety of the tent where Checklist is enjoying a supper of cucumbers, ham, mozzarella, and hummus. As the light fades around us I must make one final heroic attempt to brave the open air of the forest. A loud whining hum like the drone of a million miniature parasitic helicopters awaits me. There will be blood tonight!

It was probably just some smaller animal like a fox or coyote going down to the creek for a drink. In any case, the double edged sword means our sleep suffers and we get an earlier start. Crossword and Boston got an earlier start still, and despite being several miles behind us last night are the first people we see. We hike ahead of them over the first mountain but Crossword catches us on the way down. At the bottom we find him with his feet in the cooling waters of Grant Brook; he has decided to stop for a while and wait out the hottest part of the day. The temperature today has a high near 90, which makes hiking harder and dehydration more likely. 
The climb up Smarts Mountain is brutal and steep. Halfway up we stop for lunch and are passed by Boston and half a dozen other hikers. We meet a flip flop named ""Float"" who complains about his unstoppable weight loss. T and Chatterbox arrive huffing and puffing and take our spots as we get up to go. At the top of the mountain we find a small group of hikers all milling around a fire tower. Bad Dinner is here, and is on his back inside the old fire warden's cabin (now open for hikers). Florida Man speeds into view looking surprisingly vigorous. T gives him a lecture about shelter etiquette; I guess he and Bad Dinner came in loudly late last night, a big no-no in trail culture. 
After several miles of steep downhill descent my ankles and I are ready to call it a day. Checklist wants to push a bit farther, however, so we muster up our strength for one last climb over Mt Cube. The evergreen trees grow thinly in the quartzite rock on top of the mountain and the summit feels special because of it. Compared to the incoming Whites the mountains of the past few days are little more than foothills. They haven't felt that way however. When I add up the elevation for the day it adds up to nearly 10,000 feet of ups and downs (5,000 of just ups). To better grasp what that means for us, imagine a ladder against the side of your house - which we'll say is 20 feet off the ground. To equal the elevation gain of today you would climb up and down that ladder 250 times. Sound too easy? Instead of conveniently placed ladder rungs imagine an ever-varying grade of solid rock, dirt, and roots. 
At the end of it, I think you would feel much the same as we do. When we finally pitch our tent in a private place downstream from where South Park and Funkytown have set up their tents, I shed my dirty laundry and take an icy bath in my birthday clothes. Supper is a tired affair of whatever we have energy for. I am going to sleep good tonight!

Somewhere back in the annals of my daily writings I remember insisting we were the type of hikers who plunge through every rainstorm, making miles while others hide. To be sure we are still less prone to zeros than most, but we no longer can claim any real bravado when it comes to rain. This morning we wait for the drizzle to stop until it is almost noon, then we venture out, nervously hoping the stuff is done for good. Turns out it is, but that doesn't help the now muddy trail. Checklist says it well when she says: ""I feel like I've been playing 'The Floor is Lava' all day!"". 
We don't see many other hikers today, I'm guessing they either passed us in the rain or just didn't bother getting up in the first place. Late in the day we climb over Mt Mist, our last ""little"" mountain before the Whites. Just prior to the top we are taking a break to enjoy some hazelnut spread when who should come by but Snow and Snake Farm. Last we met, it was before the blizzard that had us holing up in a shed with Florida Man. They are headed to a hostel on the road before Mount Moosilauke, so we will probably see them tomorrow. 
We press on past Mt Mist, past the road with a hostel, and up the trail a mile to Jeffers Brook Shelter. The brook itself is a rushing thing that is perfect for soaking feet.

Waking up in the shadow of the Whites is both exciting and intimidating at the same time. We have heard about these mountains - and particularly Mt Moosilauke - for hundreds of miles. To give us the best chance for success we have planned our days so that today we only need to walk the 9 miles up and over the mountain. In addition, we begin the climb at 7:30am to give ourselves plenty of time. It's a good thing too, because the trail very quickly assumes a permanently steep slope that slows our pace to a mile an hour. The corridor of trail bends and turns but always continues steeply upward, as if seeking a path to the heavens themselves. Occasionally I stop and crane my neck to look up to where the sky meets the mountain. This is a pointless endeavor, as the top is unattainable. We will simply climb this mountain until we collapse in agony . . . this is how it feels anyway. 
To make matters worse, we successively meet T, Chatterbox, Straps, Boston, and Float, who all  stayed at the hostel last night and are slackpacking south. Of course they give us the classic line: ""You're almost there"" - which is a lie, because you very rarely are actually almost there. They also tell us the treeless summit is cold, windy, and covered in sleeting rain. Not exactly a motivational pep talk. Shortly after we're almost there we arrive at a small clearing where through a signpost we learn the summit is still a mile away. It feels as though we have been climbing for years already. The sun is waging a battle glorious with the gloomy storm clouds so we decide to wait for a short time to give ourselves the best chance of a view. 
In just fifteen minutes patches of blue sky display a partial victory for the golden globe, so I walk down a short side trail to the south peak (a little thing compared to the summit). Even from the south peak the views are breathtaking, I can see the summit up ahead as it clears up. One minute it is socked in with dense clouds, the next it is a sunshiny grassy ""Sound of Music"" mountaintop. I make my way back down the side trail and collect Checklist, who has been snuggling in her sleeping bag. Together we climb up the last leg of the unconquerable beast and stand victorious on the summit. The clouds hover just above us and create a ceiling to the expanse of views. The wind whips across the stony cairns that mark the Appalachian Trail's path over the top. It is a profound moment for us. We have come this far and we can go yet further. 
Down the other side we hear much of an upcoming section that is tricky and steep. When we reach said section it is all it was cracked up to be. A cascading waterfall tumbles alongside the trail, often merging with the trail itself. Steep rocks jut out at all angles creating a nightmarish staircase. The easiest sections are those where trail builders have secured wooden triangle steps to the sheer rock cliffs. In other places we have to hold our poles with one hand and scuttle down boulders with the aid of the other. 
Somewhere still a ways from the bottom, Checklist looks up to see a old friend. ""Monarch""! She exclaims. Monarch lives here in New Hampshire, and is doing this upper portion of the trail in large sections for sale of convenience. When she learned we were getting close to her home state she suggested we meet up. Now she makes this final mile an easy one, filled with trail talk and laughter. At the bottom we stuff our stinky packs into her car and head to a local Mexican restaurant for supper. Afterwards we make plans to slack a 16 mile portion of trail tomorrow (an ambitious goal considering we are now in the clutches of the Whites). Monarch drives us to a grocery store and Subway, where we secure food for tomorrow. Then it's on to a local campsite, where we set up our tent on an actual gravel tent pad. Checklist and I catch up with Monarch while sharing a half gallon of ice cream; then we call it an early night to get us much sleep as possible before tomorrow.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653930,"(Lonesome Lake)Atypical morning. It feels strange to wake up in a tent, but walk to a bathhouse with a flush toilet and running water. Several bananas do for an early breakfast, then it's on to Franconian Notch, where we park the car and get picked up by a shuttle driver. He drives us back to Kinsman Notch, which is where we stopped last night. Now we can carry light day packs and hike back to the car. 
The Kinsman Mountains are practically just one mountain with two peaks. Hence the nomenclature of ""South Kinsman"" and ""North Kinsman"". The climbs leading up to the main ascent are as tricky and steep as the climb to Mt Moosilauke, and we are both thankful to be carrying only the bare essentials. The flora and fauna has underwent a transformation in the past several days of hiking, and is now comprised of dense coniferous forests and a mossy understory. Weaving around boulders amidst the hemlocks, pines, firs, and birches feels like the set of a mystical movie. Each twist of the trail takes us deeper into the woods and higher up the mountain. 
Florida Man and Bad Dinner are slackpacking today too, and we catch them lounging at Eliza Brook Shelter. They pass us climbing up the insane ascent to South Kinsman, which is not quite 3 miles of straight up. It is impossible to describe the feeling I get, when after climbing hand over hand for over a hour, I pause to look up. Heedless of my struggle the mountaintop is nowhere in sight; just more of the same rocky cliff side. Had I the poor misfortune to lose my balance and topple backwards, I would tumble for at least several dozen feet.  Near the summit the firs and spruces take on a stunted dwarfish shape - the tops mangled and threadbare from the harsh winds that scream across the mountain at these higher elevations. Today these winds are noticeably absent, replaced by the perfect combination of temperature, breeze, and sunshine. We sit at the South Kinsman summit with Florida Man and Bad Dinner, and admire the expansive views that tease us with sights of what is to come. Monarch knows many of the distant peaks, and points out several that are in our future. 
It is difficult to drag ourselves away from our rewarding outlook, but we traverse the dip in between the twin peaks and go up and over North Kinsman. The descent down is markedly easier than it would have been with weighty packs. The lesser strain on our joints going down makes a big difference in how we feel and perform. Checklist leads the way down to the Lonesome Lake Hut, which is the first in a long chain of the structures. These huts are remote buildings that can be reached only by hiking. They are basins of civilization however, and typically house a ""Croo"" of young people who maintain the huts for tourists. The Croo cooks meals for the tourists, who can enjoy the surrounding area with all the comfort of electricity and running water. For most thru-hikers, the only cost-effective way to stay at these huts is through a work-for-stay. Typically, a hut will exchange several hours of light work for meal leftovers and a place on the floor to spread a sleeping bag. This is a step down from the comfy bunks that paying guests enjoy, but still so desirable a situation that the huts limit work-for-stays to 2 thru-hikers a night.   Since places to sleep are scarce in the Whites we will try to be the enviable thru-hikers who get these spots, but today we are just passing through. This hut is nicely positioned on Lonesome Lake, a gorgeous oasis nestled under the shadow of the Franconian Ridge. 
The last several miles fly by, although a bit of guidebook confusion leaves us with a longer side trail to the parking lot than expected. Actual mileage for the day was somewhere closer to 18 miles, no small feat for a day in the Whites. We pile tiredly in Monarch's car and she drives the two hours south to where she lives in Hampton NH. She introduced us to our home (her Airbnb) for the next couple days, which is a condo just steps away from Hampton Beach. An ocean breeze drifts through the screened in sliding door that leads to our fourth floor deck. We are exhausted to do anything except thank her for her kindness . . . and fall into bed.

Anyone who has ever arrived at a vacation destination late at night understands the lure of that first morning. Everything is new and wonderful.

Of course the couple who steps out of bed this morning crawled out of a tent the night previous . . . that may have something to do with our sense of awe at the Eden we now find ourselves in. Then again, maybe not. I think everyone can appreciate the situation we have now been blessed with. Our condo is a quaint one room living space that has been lovingly decorated and prepared by Monarch. Our deck looks out over a tranquil marsh that teems with birds exotic to my eye. Turning my head to either side of the deck, I can see  Hampton Beach disappearing into the Atlantic Ocean. Checklist and I run delightedly downstairs, half-drunk on the intoxicating sea-air. A quiet road is all that separates us from the sandy paradise, then we are walking on the sand towards where the waves lap everlastingly up towards your feet. I suppose it's rather funny that after such a long day of walking we want to walk more, but somehow the clear frigid water glistening with a million shades of color distracts us from what is actually taking place. We actually have to pull ourselves away from a longer than necessary walk, we do have trail chores to attend to. 
Monarch meets us at the condo - having refreshed herself with a night of sleep in her own bed - and takes us down to the local supermarket so we can both get food for the next few days and resupply for when we tackle the Whites again. On the way back she convinces us to go to ""her"" beach for the afternoon, so we quickly pack sandwiches and ride up the scenic New Hampshire coast to where she lives on an island. Her beach turns out to be a private strip of fine white sand directly adjoining her cottage in Newcastle, NH. From where I am lounging I can see the shores of Maine across the Piscataqua River, which empties in front of us into the Atlantic Ocean, around a Coast Guard Station and several lighthouse towers that stand at the maw. Monarch brings out her paddle board and Checklist and I take turns exploring the small bay that is the prelude to the ocean. We both have a knack for the activity, and enjoy it immensely. When I'm not on the board, I'm warming myself from a dip in the water with a borrowed book in my hand. I can tell Monarch is used to this life; she has transitioned seamlessly from a rugged thru-hiker to a sea-side beach dweller. She tirelessly explains the tides, the marine activity, and the bylaws of coastal real estate. Her endless knowledge of things we know nothing about is eye-opening, and it helps us realize just how much we don't know about the world around us.
We could easily live on the beach until the sun goes down, but eventually our bellies grumble for supper. We all head back to the condo, where Checklist and I make use of the kitchenette to make cauliflower rice with chicken marsala. Afterwards, Monarch walks us down the Hampton Beach strip to an amphitheater on the beach named ""The Seashell"". A country band is playing old hits for the hundreds of people on benches. Several dozen people went to a free class earlier in the day and are now line dancing in front of the stage. We stay for an hour and then decide to call it a day. We walk back down the emptying beach past the Cormorants diving for supper and the Piping Plovers skittering for the comfort of their nest. Our pillows and sheets await us, clean and white and soft.

Day two of being beach bums begins with eggs, sausage links, and sweet potatoes all cooked using a combination of microwave, toaster oven, and electric skillet. The eggs in particular are a welcome (if temporary) addition to our diet; we bought 3 18-egg cartons and are now committed to egg heavy breakfasts for the duration of our stay. As the sun comes up we prepare for another relaxing sunbathing session by making more lunch sandwiches. Monarch arrives around 9am and helps us move our stuff from our upstairs condo two flights down to an identical one that was left vacant just this morning. Our current room is booked through Airbnb for tonight so we are being evicted to make way for paying guests. The swap provides a perfect opportunity to watch Monarch at work. We have been learning a lot about Airbnbs - and passive incomes in general - just by asking her questions, but now she lets us help turn over the room for tonight's guests. She shows us how she tucks bedsheets in at an attractive angle, cleans quickly from the top down, and adds final touches like a small basket filled with treats. 
With work for the day done, Monarch allows us to set the agenda for the afternoon, which we declare as to be identical to yesterday's. A quick drive later we are back on Monarch's beach with our feet in the soft white sand. Today I feel even more comfortable with the paddle board, and can take it farther out from the beach without difficulty. We spend most of the next few hours chatting idly with Monarch and worrying about important things like when our next dip in the water should take place. We note collectively with Monarch that it is fascinating how one always normalizes their everyday life. It isn't that Monarch doesn't appreciate a house on the beach, she just lacks the sense of novelty we are experiencing. This is understandable. Only by hiking the trail have we been given a fuller gratitude for Indiana's extended growing season and diverse hardwood forests. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence I suppose. 
This small bay does seem awfully interesting though. The amount of people around us is pleasantly low and unobtrusive, broken only by two neighborhood boys wheeling a wagon past with 50 cent glasses of lemonade for sale (they were delicious!). The paddle boarding is a ton of fun and I return to it again and again. When I get tired of gazing at the swaying seaweed from a standing position I just lay down and enjoy the gentle lul of the waves beneath me. The entire situation is so relaxing that my red bandana slips off my head at some point, to be lost in the sea's grasp for time unknowable. Spirits dampened only slightly by my accidental trash-dump, I make my way back to the beach where Checklist and Monarch bemoan the loss of the iconic handkerchief. Checklist makes several forays down the beach in hopes the tide was kind enough to return the cloth, but alas, it is gone for good. To distract ourselves from our misfortune we walk around the bay to where a jetty juts out into the water. From the end we watch a tugboat escort a large freighter loaded with oil towards the harbor which awaits just upriver. 
The sun is low in the sky before we realize so much time has slipped by, and Monarch takes us back to our condo so we can cook ourselves supper. On the way we stop by a locals beach, where a number of surfers are making the best of the waves crashing towards the sand. After Monarch drops us off we make ourselves spaghetti for dinner, then lounge in bed until it's time to turn off the lights. For once I actually can.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654175,"(A Hampton Beach sunrise, picture from following morning)Rain was in the forecast for today, both here and back on Franconian Ridge. Thus the reasoning for the extravagant third zero. Despite the overcast drizzle we awake with a start to a 4:30am alarm, which we set last night in hope of a sunrise over the Atlantic. Unsurprisingly, the sky is just a lightening shade of grey when we stumble onto the beach fronting our condominium. Slightly dejected but unwilling to admit total defeat, we walk up the beach as the rain splashes on our heads and shoulders. It isn't so bad when we have the option of toweling off and getting back in bed. 
A second wake-up is subsequently delayed until past 9am, when the grumbling in our stomachs forces us out of bed to make breakfast. Checklist, I'll admit, does the lion's share of the work. My part is mostly to do my duty with my share of the baked 16-egg quiche. Monarch has errands to do today, so we spend the late morning resting in bed or puttering around the place. Early in the afternoon we head out on a mission to replace my red handkerchief that I lost yesterday. The first vendor offers only polyester bandanas, the second doesn't stock red, and so on. Finally we stumble on a shop with a cotton red square of beauty, and I am restored to my full hiker glory (plus it keeps my hair out of my eyes). 
The vast amounts of umbrellas out for July 4th weekend keeps us in our room for the duration of the day. Sometime in the evening we roast buttered corn on the cob in the toaster oven, followed by batches of brownies and cookies, respectively. The latter goes in bags to be packed out tomorrow. The former is stored in our gastric warehouses, to help us last through the night without suffering starvation pangs.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654177,"(Checklist hiking along the Franconian Ridge)Just like yesterday, the enticing appeal of a sunrise over the beach gets us out of bed before five. This time the effort is rewarded with glorious streaming colors all across the sky. It is a fitting farewell march in light of our brief but special time here in this corner of the US. Back at our condo we down as much of our remaining perishable food as possible before packing the rest up into our bags with the resupply items. Monarch picks us up at 7:30am and takes us back to the parking lot we left three days ago. Quick goodbye hugs are in order, then it's back to what we know best. We make great time up the long climb to the Franconian Ridge, perhaps because of what awaits us - or maybe because we're feeling fresh from our days of rest. The weather is stunningly perfect for the treat God has set up for us, a breeze weaves through the dense forests as we climb and compliments the warming rays of the morning sun. 
Before we realize it we are at the top of the first peak: Little Haystack. The trail here is above treeline, legendary words meaning nothing to block fantabulous views. Several trails converge at the top and people are streaming up from all directions to enjoy the rare good weather (Independence Day weekend may also have something to do with it). Monarch is here as well, having decided to hike up behind us and then return by an alternate route. A ridgerunner is standing at where the trails intersect, greeting hikers and offering information on the area. For us he points out the meaningful peaks on the horizon, all the way back to Stratton and as far forward as Mt Washington. 
The next several miles cannot be overstated in their majesty and awesomeness. The amount of people is unpleasant to say the least - at times I feel like I'm in some sort of line waiting for ice-cream at the circus - but it is to be expected at this time and date. The variety of alpine plants and rocks is eye-catching and pretty against the backdrop of other distant mountain ranges. For over two miles we walk with views unobstructed in any direction. Little Haystack Mountain is followed by Mt Lafayette, which is followed by Mt Lincoln, which is the highest peak on the Franconian Ridge and the start of a section called ""The Presidentials"". Small cliffs and rock scrambles keep us from focusing all our attention on our secondary environment, and the wind blowing strongly across the ridge makes it difficult to keep our balance while gawking at the sights. The entire event is one we are fortunate to see, these higher peaks are more often than not enveloped in clouds. By the time we dip back into the protection of the trees I am more thankful than disappointed, so much time on an exposed ridge has left me rather overwhelmed by splendor. 
We churn the last several miles out quickly, stopping only for a quick bathroom break. The notorious black flies of New England are out and biting, spurring us to greater speeds. At Garfield Pond we find a large stealth tenting area with several people set up. We hurriedly find our own spot and erect our tent in a hasty (if practiced) manner. We were planning on instant mashed potatoes for supper, but after snacking on some lettuce, peppers, and boiled eggs, we are so tired we stretch out for a pre-night nap. From 6-8pm we doze stupidly, stirring only when hikers pass noisily on the nearby trail. At 8:30pm I drag myself from the tent to filter water for tomorrow, then it's back into the bag and nighty-night for us exhausted mountaineers.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654179,"(A Ruffed Grouse)I awake to the smell of evergreen needles. The sun shines through the tent, illuminating the area warmly. My sleeping bag feels cozy, my pad soft and spongy. I can hear the hikers nextdoor getting ready. By the sounds and clatter they make I know they are overnighters. The time is far past when Checklist and I felt we had anything to prove. We've done big mile days, zero mile days, and everything in between. We aren't fast, and won't suddenly become that way, but we are still moving up trail as fast as most (not that it matters). By the end of the day we will have just 350(ish) miles left until Katahdin. To many of the day hikers around us it is an unconquerable number, but we feel as if we are making a last push to the end. It feels attainable, made more so by the rising number of SOBOs we meet each day who have taken around a month to reach this point.
The terrain is unyieldingly brutal from the first hundred yards of the day to the last. We summit Mt Garfield and join a small number of early hikers enjoying the morning breeze and looking back towards the Franconian Ridge. The views are just the first in a day that will be smothered in them. Several miles down we stop at the Galehead Hut, where our request for leftover food scraps is met with empty hands. A kind soul staying at the hut buys us a piece of spice cake, which brightens our spirits considerably and gets us up to South Twin Peak where we stop for lunch. As we traipse along the ridge afterwards we run into a mild Ruffed Grouse, a bird we've heard and seen in brief snippets. The grouse lets us get rather close before scurrying back into the underbrush; I think the warming rays of the sun were both drawing and calming him. 
The long descent down is steep and terrible, each step is an exercise in caution and foot placement. The result is an aggrievement of the agonizingly slow pace we've been stuck at most of the day. At the bottom we stumble into Zealand Falls Hut, which is teeming with people having far too good of a time. The difference between us and them is stark: they are out for a pleasurable (and pricey) night's stay in the mountains where they might dabble in a bit of hiking, while we are wondering how to find an option for supper other than instant mashed potatoes. Four scraggly thru-hikers sit outside the hut killing time while the Croo sets the dinner table inside. These hikers are doing a work-for-stay to earn free meal leftovers and a floor to roll their mat. Their presence means we must move on and camp somewhere else, as the huts only allow a limited number of thru-hiker work-for-stays per night. 4:30pm was just a shade to late to show up I suppose. We make it a couple more miles before settling down in a peaceful spot just off trail. Rumors of the alarming absence of stealth sites (or the allowance thereof) ran amuck in the weeks before New Hampshire, but we have been pleasantly surprised to find all of the talk was unfounded. There are just as many nice tent sites as always, if anything, enduring the smell of home cooked food everytime we approach a hut has been the rough bit.

We haven't had service for the past several days, so we camped last night expecting rain starting early in the AM. Happily, the tent stays dry through the night and we are able to pack up without the nuisance of rain. We get an early start today because we want to try and get to the next hut in time for a work-for-stay. The first six miles of the day are the easiest we've seen in a while (per a SOBO: the last we'll see before the end) and we fairly fly down the mountain to Crawford Notch. At the bottom we have illusions of an AYCE breakfast several miles down the road, but alas, despite heavy traffic no one stops in a half hours time. Discouraged, we press on in hopes the hut will treat us better. 
The ascent up gets spectacular as soon as we reach Webster Cliffs. From there we go up and over Webster Mountain and then Mt Jackson. The terrain is rather repetitive, almost as if the trail maintainers were following a broken record. Typically a nice upward grade is abruptly met by a steep cliff, which we have to climb up strategically, being careful where we place our feet. At the top of each cliff we are met with an unhindered view of the valley below, often as not we walk directly on a ledge that falls away just a foot or two from our feet. 
We make it to Mizpah Hut at around 2:30pm, with plenty of time to spare. The Croo leader informs us she can't accept a work-for-stay until 4pm, so we offer to wait until the appointed time. We fall into easy conversation with two paying guests and pass the time talking about their travels around the world. Crossword shows up around 3pm with another thru-hiker; the two reveal their platinum-blazing status by checking in as guests. This doesn't bother us because it removes them as potential competition. At 4pm I get up to ask for the work-for-stay and am joined at the front desk by two more thru-hikers who have come in with the same purpose. The Croo leader struggles for a moment with the choice (she can only accept two thru-hikers) and then selects the latecomers. We are disappointed, but she offers us some stale breakfast leftovers as a consolation prize. We stuff down a fair amount and then head back out determined to settle at the first stealth spot. 
The climb up to Mt Pierce disappears in a flash as we vent our frustrations to one another. We are annoyed with the inconsistency of the work-for-stays and the false hope they have given us. The Croos seem indifferent about the foodless fate they are condemning hikers to (though of course they are just following the rules), and the thru-hiker limitation strains the relationships between those of us who are hungry for food and a night indoors. 
The weather is actually quite nice on the ridge, and we decide to press on without any real plan. It is only 5pm and the views are spectacular from the Presidential Mountains that lie in the shadow of Mt Washington. It feels even better than the Franconian Ridge because we have the entire vast world of emptiness to ourselves.  We walk along, our spirits lifted by the magical landscape we are in. Ahead and behind us the ridge, diving over peaks. To either side the endless views to distant mountains. A blanket of clouds cover us with a white ceiling. Gusts of wind stir suddenly from seemingly nowhere and attempt to knock us off our feet. It is alien and splendid in all of its glory.
As the wind picks up and the clouds close in for the night of rain we stumble into the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, the largest hut in the Whites which sits at the base of Mt Washington. As we enter we are greeted by a Croo member who jovially informs us we are the only thru-hikers here and can therefore do a work-for-stay. We are stoked by this blessing, and wait patiently for the other guests to finish with their supper. Then we perform our chore for the night: cleaning and scraping the ice from the two big fridges/freezers that hold all of the Hut's food. Afterwards we are rewarded with endless pots of rice, chicken, corn salsa, and enchiladas. Bursting with ungodly amounts of food we retire to a corner and wait until the Hut shuts down for the night. Then we spread our pads and bags on the dining room floor, and go to bed.

Per the demand of the crew we are up and packed up by 6am. Breakfast is served early here so the guests can be on their way. For reasons unknown to me, the guests are served breakfast first. After the royalty is finished the peasantry is allowed to eat. Following our meal we sweep the dining room table and are free to go. The weather looks like it did last night but is gusting much more strongly. A bit of rain is mixed into the bargain, making many of the hut guests nervous. We meet a fellow thru-hiker named Ness, who gleefully admits to having the money to platinum blaze and stay at the huts. He is fiddling with his clothing and getting ready to head out. The dining room is transformed into the makings of a mountaineering base camp, with gear, clothing, and backpacks strewn everywhere as people prepare to embark. Most have only to hike several miles in either direction to arrive at the next hut in their expensive backcountry trip. We on the other hand are not quite sure where we will end up. The Croo advises us to try and make the next hut north by 4pm in order to maximize our chances of a work-for-stay there. First, however, we have to make it over Mt Washington, which at 6,288 ft above sea level is the highest natural point on the trail (The man-made Clingmans Dome in Tennessee is the highest overall point). We leave the hut at around 10am in the hopes that the late start will give us better weather conditions. It doesn't, and they are aren't. The wind blows in waves and drives the misty water against us from the west. We can only see clearly a hundred feet or so ahead, just enough to make it to the next cairn (a pile of rocks marking the trail). As we leave the hut we pass a sign saying: ""Warning! The area you are entering has the worst weather in America. Hikers have died from exposure. If the weather is bad then turn around!"" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We press on.
(I promise we weren't being terrible foolish here, the Croo had talked to the visitor center on top of the mountain and confirmed the weather was no worse up there than it was down here.)
The mile and a half up to the top feels long and slow, but we are remarkably happy anyway. We laugh in wonder everytime a gust knocks us off balance and threatens to send us headlong into the minefield of rocks that is on either side of the trail (and the trail itself for that matter!). At the top we duck into the visitor center, where tourists are milling around in confusion. They were brought up on a railcar from the base of the mountain and are now in obvious surprise that the weather isn't as sunny as it is below. Downstairs in a special hiker space (honestly just a table with a hiker box on it) we find Ness trying to recover from his own ascent. We pull out our sleeping bags and do our best to regain some of the warmth that was driven out of us. Someone left several Mountain House meals in the hiker box and we add them to our stores thankfully after Ness declares he neither needs nor wants them. 
After an hour of warming up the three of us tackle the last 6 miles of the day together. The first mile down batters us with the same harsh winds and rain, but every step down the mountain gets slightly warmer and dryer, until finally the wind is bearable and doesn't chill us with driving rain. The clouds even clear from time to time, giving us a view as we boulder hop along with Ness. He is a good conversation partner, but jumps back and forth between hilarious sarcasm and puzzling abstract comments. We talk about religion, the meaning of life, and whether or not Checklist and I will get the work for stay. With a mile left to go that question is answered when we are passed by Yams, who awkwardly admits he is pushing for the work-for-stay as well. When we catch up to him at the hut we find it was all in vain. Two SOBOs got there early and the hut accepted them before the set time of 4pm. As disappointed as we are, we are not nearly as dejected as All Good, who we reunite with at the hut. She left from this very spot this morning but got lost on the poorly marked trails (do better NH) and did a loop back to where she started. She is now holding back tears as the Croo tells her she must restart, as there is no free room for lost hikers. It is a sorry spread-out bunch of thru-hikers that make their way down the steep Madison mountainside. Osgood Tent Site is 3 miles down. And the down is the worst in a long time. It goes on and on and on until it doesn't make sense that it continue . . . and then it still goes on. When. I do the math at the end of the day I discover we took 9 hiking hours to traverse 10 miles; almost a mile an hour. And we weren't trying to go slow either!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654631,"(Ness)We are late to rise after what felt like a marathon day yesterday. The rugged terrain as of late has us ready for a break so we discuss potential options. We decide to try and stay in Gorham NH, which is available to us via a road in 5 miles. We pack up and get moving, motivated to get our day over with as quickly as possible. Halfway down we are hailed from behind by someone who has become a legend on the trail grapevine (and someone who's progress we've been tracking with interest). It is ""Captain Morgan"", who is attempting to break the Fastest Known Time (or FKT) for a supported AT thru-hike. The current record is held by Karl Sabbe, who completed the trail in 2018 with a time of 41 days, 7 hours, and 39 minutes. Captain Morgan has passed us on day 36 (day 150 for us!) with about 300 miles left to go. He has a tough final grind if he wants to take down Sabbe's record but we are all rooting for him. He passes us in expected fashion: a word of encouragement for us as thru-hikers - who he recognizes by the stench - and he is gone.
Down at the notch we enter the Joe Dodge Lodge, a fine establishment run by the AMC (which also runs the huts). We attempt to contact all the different options for lodging but are met with varying degrees of inadequacy. One is full of SOBO thru-hikers, the next charges $80 for a single bunk, a third has permanently closed down. Discouraged, we buy lunch from the small deli upstairs and mentally prepare for a push onward. Ness rolls in ready to end his day along with a muscular young thru-hiker named ""Reality Check"". She tells us that she has spent the last several days hiking on the road because a police officer prevented her from  getting a hitch. She is planning on hitching (what else?) into Gorham to resupply so she can resume her thru-hike north. 
We muster up as much resolve as we can and cross the road so as to continue heading up the trail. First up is the ""Wildcats"", a brutal ridge with several peaks that tests our mountaineering ability for several hours. The things they ask us to ""hike"" are truly insane, and they run the gambit from dangerous to ridiculous. At the top of peak D a ski gondola offers a place to sit and rest. Several large crash pads next to the deck suggest a bed for the night, but as we are without water we must press on. T-Bone catches us climbing down the north side of peak A and we hike together down to Carter Notch Hut. We talk about our mutual Christian faith, our lack of food, and the idiotic way thru-hikers are treated at the huts. We (unsurprisingly) come up empty at the hut and thus walk up the side of the next mountain until we find a reasonably flat spot. T-Bone takes a more exposed spot while we squeeze our protesting tent into a small depression between boulders. We only have one functioning door tonight, but so long as I have room for my pad and my bag, I will sleep like a rock.

These mountains are insane. I honestly have a hard time understanding how they call what we traverse a trail. It really is more akin to climbing than it is walking. Slabs of rock rise from the ground at 45 degree slants, but the trail goes right up (or down) them with little apparent thought as to how exactly we are to get past such an obstacle. We meet other hikers who are putting in long hard days and managing to get 20+ mile days in return for their toil. I have no interest in such strivings. Our past several days have left us broken enough. 
The Croo at Carter Notch Hut last night mentioned offhand that breakfast leftovers would be available at 7:30am, so I get out of bed at the designated time for a quick quarter mile walk down the mountain. Arriving at the hut and I am offered one scoop of overcooked oatmeal mush . . . . . . . . hurray. Back at the tent we say goodbye to T-Bone, who is motivated to reach Gorham, NH 15 miles away. Having no such inclination we stay in a prone position for as long as seems feasible before needing to get hiking. When we do start up the next mountain in a series of many it is past 9am and we still don't feel substantially better. Four miles in it is 12pm, so we stop and take a lunch break. A man in pants and boots and a small day pack hikes into the clearing from the northward trail and informs us he left from town just three hours prior. Astonished at his speed, we decide if he can do it in three, we can do it in five. With renewed spirits we charge off up trail, powering up ridiculous climbs and leaping downhill like whitetail deer. By 3pm we are still eight miles from town, and our resolve begins to waver. Of a sudden two thru-hikers pass by, slackpacking between Pinkham Notch and US 2 (the latter our ambitious goal for today). When we tell them of our hope to reach town they suggest calling the hostel to see if there has been a cancellation. I take their advice and am thrilled to find a queen bed has opened up for $60, a good price for New England. I reserve it and we charge on, our pace slowed but our spirits lifted by the idea of a shower and a bed. 
With four miles to go we are passed by Ghost and Lucky, two speedy guys who averaged 20 miles a day through the Whites. We stick with them - albeit with difficulty - and keep up until they end their day at Rattle River Shelter, just two miles before town and our original goal. The last two miles are tired ones but at least the terrain is markedly easy, in stark contrast to every other part of the day. At US 2 we are picked up by Paul, who runs the Barn Hostel in Gorham. He takes us to our home for the night and runs us through the long set of rules for the hostel. He runs a tight ship, as indicated by small signs on everything telling us what we can and can't do. First on our mind after our allotted ten minutes showers is food, and we make an emotional decision to bypass a nearby Subway and walk a mile to a Chinese buffet. On the way we pass T coming out of a pizza place with a full belly. The buffet is good but isn't worth the two mile round trip walk. By the time we get back to the hostel it is past 9pm, which is the start of quiet hours. All Good is here, having gotten off at Pinkham Notch for a well-earned zero day. T-Bone is here and is surprised to see us. Also here is Chewie, who we haven't seen since Angel's Rest in Pearisburg, VA.
We head upstairs to where over a dozen beds have been scantily separated by curtains and crawl into bed tiredly. As I drift off I see Paul come up with a flashlight, checking the beds like the warden of an orphanage.

After the main pack of hikers is gone, I walk across the street and buy breakfast materials at a convenience store. While I whip up some simple pleasures Checklist gets in a second shower. Over breakfast we meet the few remaining guests. ""Eagle"" is a SOBO who has a similar plan of taking most of the day off. ""Vinchee"" is a NOBO who we have been more or less chasing for several months. He is a quiet, older man who we find to be extremely likeable. He eats a bowl of cereal with his phone propped in front of him, as if in lieu of a TV at home. 
At 9am we check out and walk down the street to Dollar General for a resupply. Along the way we spontaneously stop in at a vendors market, where I pick up a new book on climbing Everest. Following DG I swing by McDonalds to buy a bag of burgers for supper. Then we plop ourselves on public-use plastic Adirondack chairs facing the creek that runs parallel to main street. Several highly enjoyable hours pass in this fashion before we decide to try and get back to the trail. A nice lady stops her car in traffic to offer us a ride as we cross the street, so we don't even have to pull our thumbs out of our pockets.
Back on trail we have plans to end the day early at a brook a mile and a half up Hayer Mountain. But a dry stream bed forces us to press on thirstily. Despite our problems, we have it better than Funkytown, who passes us headed back to town. She forgot her pot, stove, and puffy at the hostel and now has to walk the 7 miles back to town to retrieve them.  Still disgruntled at our our own misfortune, we moan and complain all the way to where a trickle provides the ticket to a day's end. A beautiful stealth site softens the blow a mite, and we munch on smooshed burgers happily with plans for our final state line tomorrow.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654634,"(The New Hampshire/Maine state line)The past several days have been very difficult. New Hampshire hasn't shown any signs of repentance from its mountainous ways, and we've heard Maine won't be much better. Now that we are out of the Whites it is much more enjoyable to run into SOBOs. Since we don't have to compete for huts anymore, a peaceful exchange of useful information is now the norm. Today we run into several who warn us that the water situation is bleak up ahead. The shelters we pass today are all a fifth of a mile or more off trail and plunge steeply downhill off of the main AT. As a result we decide to avoid said shelters and stealth somewhere near to the state line. It is exhilarating to think that Maine is just the day's hike away; all day long we hike with a nervous and excited energy. 
Over lunch break we meet a young lady named ""Goodall"", who is part of a large fractured tramily hiking around us. She is friendly, and hikes with us for several miles before splitting off for a lunch break of her own. On our next break we are caught by a gentleman named ""Omoo"", a stately older man who is a voracious reader. We hike in front of him until we hit our last state line, where Checklist and I pose with 14 fingers to represent the 14 states we have now walked in. Half a mile later Omoo turns in at the shelter sign, but we continue on to the top of Mt Carlo. We are low on water but too stubborn to walk an extra half mile to the shelter and back, so we pitch camp in a mossy area that isn't all that flat and call it a day. Checklist toasts our brats over the iso-butane stove instead of a fire, and we drink sparingly before going to sleep.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654635,"(Checklist in the Mahoosuc Notch)Last night was rough. Although we hang out food and bears are scarce in this area, I still go through phases where I am more restless at night. The noises in the strange forest around us can easily become exaggerated if I let them, leading to paranoia and fear. Tonight I awake from a bad dream to see what looked like a bearish shape right outside our tent. Failing to discern that the shape was actually my wife sitting up to get a drink, I yelled crazily: ""Hey Bear!"" My wife assures me in the morning that I sounded quite panicky and frantic, and did a great job of getting her into the same mood.
The mountains definitely aren't letting up either.  The first four miles are a roller coaster that leaves us gasping for breath at the Full Goose Pond Shelter. Omoo beat us here via an early start, along with Goodall and her tramily member, ""Stomps"". Following their departure Checklist and I discuss options for our next resupply. A shuttle into town costs as much as a hostel stay, so we book a couple bunks for Wednesday at a hostel thirty miles ahead. The new schedule means we can't take it easy today, so we get going in an attempt to catch up. To make what will end up being just a normal mileage day feel even longer, we are heavily slowed by the Mahoosuc Notch and Arm. The former is a one mile segment of trail that is called the most difficult and fun mile of the AT. It takes us an hour and a half to navigate the course of vehicle sized boulders, after which we crawl out of that obstacle course to tackle the Arm, a brutal uphill climb that is essentially just a heavily slanted slab of rock that lasts over a mile. At the end of it all comes a three mile descent to Grafton Notch, where we pitch our tents in the dusky light.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654636,"(Trail Magic!)We are up early and off at 6am to start a big day. The first two miles take us halfway up Baldpate Mountain to the Baldpate Lean-To (shelters in Maine are called lean-to's, and gaps are called notches just like they were in New Hampshire) where we find Goodall and Stomps making ready to shove off. We follow their tracks up and over Baldpate, which has a stunning summit that bares its cliffs in all directions. The descent is steep and is made trickier by a bit of morning rain, but we make it to the Frye Notch Lean-To in one piece. We eat breakfast and then Checklist eats lunch too, mortgaging her future for the sake of now. Finally we head back out, ready to add miles to our total of 6. Half an hour later we are hit by an intense cloudburst that drenches us, in spite of our best efforts to stay even partially dry. 
Coming down to a small paved road we are discouraged and hungry. I am slightly ahead of Checklist and am wondering how to get her to eat some of my lunch, when I top a small rise and spot a glorious sight. A feast of snacks and goodies arrayed on a long table sit just across a bubbling stream. The road is still out of view and the trail magic feels wonderfully special as a result. A friendly young man laughs as I dig into the snacks with gusto. He hiked the trail last year and is now giving back by doing some trail magic. He knows exactly what hikers need and has cold drinks, Little Debbie's, Snickers, fruit, chips, hot dogs, a power supply, fuel canisters, and more. Checklist arrives and stares aghast at the impressive array before joining me at the feasting table. After about 5000 calories my belly feels happy and full, and suddenly the rest of the day seems much more doable. The rain is gone, the sun is shining, and I am ready to keep hiking! 
Two miles later we stop to change into dry socks (something we should have done already) and put on chafing cream. This done, we press on with damp clothing unheeded. Several miles later as we near the top of Wyman Mountain we hear the first distant ripples of thunder. Outrunning the storm turns out to be futile, so our second round of socks get as hopelessly wet as the first. Miserably, we stumble into the Hall Mountain Lean-To and try to recover. The rain has stopped and I check the weather (I have the best luck with cell service on top of mountains) to find only a 20% chance for the rest of the night. Wrinkled feet be hanged, we are moving on!
The last mile and a half is a steep down that is slow going. Also, we are gifted with that 20% of rain the whole way down. Over the past week we have been seeing increasing amounts of Moose poo on the trail, often smooshed into the treadway by hundreds of other hikers. Now the pouring rain combines with the poo to make a delightful sludge that is impossible to avoid. No way to get around it all, eventually we give in and soak our feet in the chocolatey stuff. At the bottom we take full advantage of a break in the rain to set up camp hastily. Then it hits us again and we dive for cover. Deep in the bowels of our tent, we make supper, regain what sanity we have left, and nurse our wounds in defiance of a difficult day.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654637,"(Human-Nature Hostel)It rains steadily through the night, stopping only for short breaks that do little to dry out gear or tent. We wake up damp, smelly, sore, and blistered. I cannot begin to describe how unappealing my wet clothes are. They sit in a disgusting mound, piled on my outstretched raincoat in the tent vestibule. I unhappily put them back on and help Checklist pack up the tent, the whole while feeling more like a drenched rat than a human. From a lone tent nearby South Park emerges, ready as we are to climb over Mt Moody. He leaves ahead of us, but we see him at the bottom of the other side, waiting at the road for a hostel pickup. We are going to the same hostel, and have put in a tough couple days expressly for this purpose. We sit and catch up with South Park while we wait for what turns out to be a slightly late shuttle. Our shuttle driver is named ""The Patriot"", and he takes us to a unique dome shaped hostel named Human-Nature Hostel (after a quick resupply stop at the local general store). The building is finished with natural materials like wood, rope, stone, and metal;  and is a real treat for the eyes. The owner and operator is a thru-hiker alumnus from 2012 named White Owl, and he has built this place just for thru-hikers like us. 
Goodall, Stomps, and two other members of their tramily named ""Pantless"" (her) and ""Shem"" (him) are already all here. We spread out about the place and make our rounds doing typical chores. White Owl has well-built outdoor showers that we use to take shower number one; shower number two can be the nicer indoor shower per hostel rules. We sit down to a pleasant lunch of soup and biscuits, after which we are all free to chill until supper. The four members of the Amoeba tramily (for such it is) play a game downstairs while Checklist, South Park, and I hang out upstairs. Everything in the hostel is high quality and inviting, from the massive windows to the awesome cooking range to the guitars in a corner. Sometime in the afternoon a section hiker named Pat arrives, and we all enjoy a supper feast of watermelon, pasta salad, and pizza. We chat about hikers who have finished the trail recently, hikers like Swede, Monson, Buttercup, Swerve & Muppet, Gazelle, and more. Finishing friends are a boost to our confidence in our abilities; if they can do it so can we! The mood is upbeat and positive following the gorge fest, and everyone splinters again into various Nero/Zero day activities. I hang out with Stomps in the music corner and we play guitars and talk music. Afterwards Checklist talks on the phone while I shoot the breeze with Pat. He is several life stages ahead of me and offers valuable advice on investing and finance management. 
As the night wanes everyone piles into the quiet bunk room downstairs for a good night's sleep on comfort mattresses. Tomorrow it is back to it, and we all know we are only as strong as the rest we get.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654913,"(Human-Nature Hostel)Sometime early in the morning I feel Checklist tap my shoulder in a silent question. I check my phone sleepily and am astonished to find it is 6am. Disappointed at my late wake-up, I pull the sliding bunkroom door open and head upstairs for a morning shower. White Owl already has the table set in preparation for a pancake breakfast, and is lounging on an armchair peacefully. After my shower I join Checklist downstairs, where she is compiling our gear in readiness for departure. Even though it is only 26 miles to the next resupply, we have an disproportionate amount of food that fills our food bags to bursting. Among other things - we have half a dozen boiled eggs, a pan's worth of brownies, half a pan's worth of strawberry cake, two cheeseburgers each, several leftover slices of pizza, and about a pound of walnuts (which we obtained from the hiker box). 
Upstairs we improve the food situation still more by chowing down on pancakes with blueberry syrup. The group as a whole is sad to leave but excited with where we are in our hike. Roughly 12% is left of the 2200 mile jaunt we set out on over five months ago. Every remaining page of my guidebook looks increasingly flat and level, which is a very appealing idea after the ridiculous mountains of New Hampshire and southern Maine. This energy stays with the group all the way back to the trailhead, where we say goodbye to our hosts and begin climbing up another mountain. Paces quickly separate us from South Park and the Amoeba tramily, and we fall back languidly. Rain is in the early afternoon forecast and we are on a different trajectory than the rest of the group. They plan to plunge on through the rain, but we are willing to end early to keep our things clean and dry. Our only obstacle is Old Blue Mountain, which holds on for as long as possible before finally bending to our steady pace and allowing us a viewless summit. At the top we pass two section hikers named ""Caboose"" and ""Loon"", a mom/daughter pair that we met two days ago when we hiked in the rain to make it close to South Arm Rd. On the other side we stop around noon at a small tent site near a trickle of water, and go about making ready for the storm. Caboose and Loon cat hup and press on as we scramble to get ready for the storm. Once the hatches are battened we relax and enjoy some of the heavier bounty we carried over Old Blue. The rain hits about half an hour after we get settled, and pounds the tent for several hours. We drift off to sleep amid the din, and stir a while later to find the downpour has been reduced to a light drizzle. Around 6pm the rain stops completely, and our tent begins to dry. We are hailed by one of a few passing hikers, and we recognize the voice as belonging to T. She and her tramily are soaked and looking for a place to call home. They find places nearby and pitch their respective tents and hammocks. I threw a bear hang line over a leaning tree earlier, and I walk down to it now to find Boston less than ten feet away. ""Do you hang your food?"" I ask, not wanting to spend the effort to move the line. ""Nope, never have"" ""Would you mind if I hang it here then?"" I ask with a sheepish grin. ""Go right ahead"" he smiles back. Back at the tent we write our journals and then call it a night. Our sleeping bags smell like sunshine and our clothes are dry! God is good!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654914,"(The Height of Land Overlook)Somehow we managed to hit on a perfect combination of factors that made our tent spot last night an awesome one. The rain cooled everything down and our sleeping bags felt deliciously snuggly as a result. Even though we took a two hour nap yesterday afternoon we have no trouble sleeping late into the morning. T and the others slip past our tent at about 6am, but we are unhurried by their early start. Eventually we get our stuff together and get going by 9:30am. Our tent dried during the night and even the forest floor is now only slightly damp from the rain. Our clothes are wonderfully dry and we congratulate ourselves on a smart choice yesterday. 
The terrain has taken a big step down in difficulty and we make good time over Bemis Mountain to the Bemis Mountain Lean-To. As we sup on a nice variety of resupply food another NOBO joins us. His name is ""Wordsmith"", so called because he is a writer. He is one of the rare hikers who agrees with our preference of Pennsylvania rocks over New Hampshire rocks. We leave him to eat his lunch and move on to meet ""Hillbilly"" who hails from the hills of West Virginia and is currently slackpacking with the aid of his wife ""Moonshine"". His lighter pack is a catalyst for speed, and he disappears ahead of us as we descend down the mountain. 
At the bottom we arrive at a gravel road to find two SOBOs sitting around a cooler filled with drinks, PB&J sandwiches, Oreos, and bananas. We join them and trade information about the trail, learning along the way that the upcoming ascent is a steep one. Help arrives in the form of Wordsmith, who sets a steady pace that we are able to follow up the hill. Near the top we hit a road outlook that is called Height of Land. From it we can see Mooselookmeguntic Lake spreading out over the horizon. We take a quick break and then continue following Wordsmith all the way to Sabbath Day Pond Lean-To. T and the gang are here already, along with Loon and Caboose, who hail us as we walk in. They warn us to be careful if we go swimming because there are leaches in the pond. No private tent sites grab our attention so we decide to move on and take the first stealth site, ignoring a SOBO who tells us there isn't any. We've learned they (SOBOs) don't really have the eyes we do after 5 months of trail life. Sure enough, two-tenths of a mile later we move a few sticks off of a nice spot and set up camp.
We walk down to the pond and fill up water bottles, wading up past our knees to get the clearest water. The leaches (which turn out to be large ones) begin to work their way toward us, but we finish before they have a chance to latch on. The mosquitos are thick tonight, and we do a final round of the inside of the tent, smooshing any that made it through while Checklist was cooking supper. The long drawn out wail of a loon drifts across the pond and finds us safely in our sleeping bags. A second call answers the first, starting an echoing repetition of the haunting cry. It is the first time I have heard a loon in person, and I understand why it is known as the voice of the wilderness. Here in the middle of the Maine woods, it has an eerieness that is unmatched by any other night sound in beauty or in wildness.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654915,"(Lunch on Little Swift River Pond)For the second day in a row we are late to rise and late to leave. We can hear hikers from the shelter passing in the early hours of the day, but we don't pull out of camp until 9am. We make good time once we do get going, however, and we make the Little Swift River Pond Campsite before noon. Where a small path meets the water several canoes are strewn; life jackets are thrown haphazardly nearby. Confused, we take a moment to consider if the canoes are meant for hiker use. The pond is remote and  its banks are unmarred by any human presence whatsoever. The only sign of civilization is the AT itself. In addition, the canoes are in various states of disrepair, with two of the four having cracks or holes that render them unusable. We make a decision and launch one of the better looking ones out of the small bay. Our food bags come along for the ride, and we have lunch out in the middle of the glassy water. A beaver house and a family of ducks provide the entertainment for the afternoon, and we spend a happy hour drifting wherever the wind takes us. If we get thirsty we have but to dunk a BeFree alongside the boat for as much water as we want. 
All good things come to an end, and we dock the boat, knowing we do have places to be. Five miles later we make it to such a place: a trailhead at a road where Hillbilly and Moonshine are relaxing in lawn chairs. We walk a third of a mile down the road to a place called The Hiker Hut. There we find Loon and Caboose, who are staying the night and are fresh out of the shower. The owner of the establishment follows us into the resupply shack and makes conversation as we select what we need for the next couple days. Then he offers us some old bread with almond butter and jam, so we fill up somewhat before hitting the trail once more. The trail continues to be decidedly easier every day, and the weather is currently cooperating as well. Unripe wild blueberries coat both sides of the trail, creating an attractive (if temporarily inedible) ambiance for each step. I'm sure some hikers prefer harsh climbs and rewarding views to this more docile stuff, but we enjoy it a lot. We decide to call it quits at the Piazza Rock Lean-To, and we pitch our tent by a small stream that cuts through the campsite. Still tired enough to sleep for a small eternity, we doze off for an early night's sleep at around 7pm.

The second, partially hidden mountain is The Horn, 1.7 miles away)The mosquitos were thick last night - not that we cared much in our tired state - and they thickly blanket the outside of the tent when we wake up. As soon as we open the screen door they swarm in merrily, as if someone has finally rung the long-awaited dinner bell. We pack up quickly and get moving, determined to break our recent trend of late starts. First up is Saddleback Mountain, followed by a steep spike called ""The Horn"". Finally we climb over Saddleback Junior, which seems more like a fully grown adult than a young upstart kid. The three peaks hit quickly in succession with nothing resembling breathing room in between. The downs are terrible but the ups are just as bad. The only saving grace is the weather: it is perfect for summiting mountains. A stiff breeze makes all the difference when it is 85 degrees and sunny, and if the only place to get that breeze is over 4000 feet, well, to 4000 feet we go. 
We haven't seen many NOBOs as of late, but we are beginning to cross paths with more and more SOBOs. The SOBO bubble has essentially enveloped us fully, and we are passing close to two dozen of the fresh souls every day now. Here past (or before) the worst Maine has to offer they are enviably ignorant of what lies in their future. The friendlier ones always are up for a quick chat and exchange of information, which is nice . . . except it is hard to trust someone going the opposite direction. Are their hostel thoughts valid if they've only yet visited three? Can they really know what a hard mountain looks like without first going over Wildcat Peak D?
As we descend from Saddleback Junior we meet a hiker going southbound that we do recognize. It is Pat, who we met at the Human-Nature Hostel. He is hiking back to the hostel and is meeting us at about the midway point. He wishes us well and pushes on up the Saddlebacks, with hopes of making a few extra miles. Down at the bottom we are passed by two NOBOs, a young lady hiking solo comes first and introduces herself as ""Pale Moon"". Next is a solo guy who flies by without more than a brief nod. Checklist offers to meet me on the other side of a mile climb, so I use some energy reserves to push up the mountain at full speed. I pass the young go-getter about a quarter of the way up, and give him a few words of encouragement as I shift into a higher gear. At the top I flop on some pine needles and blissfully let my muscles stiffen while I wait for Checklist. She shows up a short while later, just a few minutes behind our silent friend. Together we walk the last two miles to Spaulding Mountain Lean-To, where we find the small clearing relatively full with other hikers. Undaunted, we fill our water vessels and hike several tenths of mile to a decent stealth site. As our friend Monarch would say: ""If you're in a sticky tenting situation, just remember thousands of other hikers stood where you stand and they all found a place to go"".

Another early start. It's always hard to get going early, and we have to wake up when it is still dark outside if we want to make it happen. But leaving at 6am has its perks; like being able to get in 8-10 miles before lunch. We are trying to get to Stratton today for a hostel stay, so the early start made sense. Rain is also coming in the afternoon and avoiding it with an early arrival time makes a lot of sense. Our first hurdle is Spaulding Mountain, which essentially takes that early energy out of us. Pale Moon passes us at the top, on a similar mission to get to safety. She stayed at the hostel we are headed to two nights ago and is carrying a lightened pack to give her more speed. Next we descend a bit and climb up to South Crocker, which is as hard as a mountain can be without being in New Hampshire. At the top we make a quick pot of ramen to fuel us the rest of the way. Just down from the summit we pass the 2000 mile mark, a huge milestone in our journey. ""If we get hurt now we can at least say we hiked 2000 miles!"" I quip. 
The food gets us over North Crocker but then burns out in a blaze of simple carbed glory. We resort to various little games to distract ourselves from the painful 5 mile descent. Yesterday we played a game where we remembered an alphabetical list of shopping items (I went to the store and bought an artichoke, bread, cantaloupe, etc). It says volumes about our mental clarity that today we can still recall the entire list from yesterday. That game exhausted however, we try a different one where one of us gives the other three ingredients with which a meal or dessert must be made. The game is appropriate in light of our hunger and does the job in getting us to the bottom. We arrive at 4pm just as the raindrops begin to fall. 
We are picked up by Jenn, who is one of the two Jenn's who together run a hostel called The Maine Roadhouse. The hostel is only in its second year but has such good reviews that it is already wildly popular in thru-hiker trail talk. When we get there it is easy to see why. A large cooking and eating area greets us when we first walk in, followed by a second large area with massive sectionals, a ping pong table, instruments, and a resupply section. Upstairs is a bunkroom where every bunk has its own outlet, light, fan, and privacy curtain. Hikers are everywhere, of both the SOBO and NOBO variety. Wordsmith is here, along with Omoo. Pale Moon was in the vehicle when we got picked up, and another NOBO named ""Heat"" greets us from the dining room table. Quick showers and loaner clothes are first up, followed by a shuttle to the local grocery store where we buy far too much food. Back at the hostel the kitchen has turned into a hub of energy and excitement. Heat and two SOBOs pan-fry steaks while I sear burgers. The microwave and toaster oven both have long wait lines, and the main table is stuffed with chattering people. One wall is full of pictures of hikers who have stayed this year, and it is fun to pick out those we know. From the date on their picture I can guess who has finished and who hasn't. Mr. Clean was here just six days ago so he is probably not quite there. Turn-Around, Copper, and Captain Jack are now done. So is Moment (presumedly), who we met back in Georgia at the start of our hike; he was here in late May, on pace for the early June finish he wanted.
All the hustle and bustle wears us out after a long day of hiking, and when we finish eating we stumble up to bed. We talk each other into a late night movie at the upstairs TV lounge (yes, there is two!) after which he collapse into bed tired, but thankful we aren't in the deluge that is coming down outside.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655247,"(Breakfast at the Maine Roadhouse)Waking up indoors makes me feel clean. No dirt right outside my door, no sweaty clothes rank with the stink of yesterday, and no rainy muck to hike in. A ready made breakfast is pretty nice too! We feast on an endless buffet of bacon, eggs, potatoes, blueberry pancakes, and watermelon, supplied by a tireless Jenn. After the meal most of the hikers head out to the trailhead, but we decide to stay behind and soak up this epic hostel. Besides, it makes sense to break up our trek over the Bigelows, which are the last peaks over 4000 feet before Katahdin. I relax on the large sectional in the main living room and chat with several SOBOs on a zero. The closer we get to the end, the more valued our advice is in the eyes of SOBOs, many of whom have yet to get trail legs or familiarity with how everything works out here. Midway through the day a Jenn brings home several more SOBOs for tonight, and we meet Jim and Emily, a young couple on their honeymoon. The freshness and enthusiasm for the trail in their eyes reminds me of how we felt our first few weeks on the trail. They are still figuring things out, and we give them a boost by writing a short list of hostels we recommend. 
Our few chores are much easier to do with a whole morning with which to get them done, and the whole affair is a rather lazy turn-based event that stretches across several hours. Checklist makes a pan of brownies and a pan of cookies, both to pack our this afternoon. I keep an eye on some boiling leftover eggs while I fry up zucchini, squash, and sausages for lunch. Afterwards we watch a bit of the Hobbit on the big screen while our frozen pizzas cook in the toaster oven. They will get packed out for our supper. 
At 3:30pm we can stall no longer, so we say goodbye to the place and ride with Jenn back to the trailhead. The first two miles are easy, and they pass uneventfully while we debrief our stay at the hostel. Hostels can be separated into two categories: those whose primary purpose is to make money, and those whose primary purpose is to serve hikers. The Maine Roadhouse obviously is a part of the latter group, which is why it is already beloved by a community of hikers. 
The last three miles are a long tedious uphill, and our packs are really quite heavy. But we are fresh off a refreshing morning and we power to the top by 6:30. A handful of SOBOs are at the shelter, so we say hi and wish them a great stay at the hostel tomorrow. Then we set up our tent automatically and climb in for an enjoyable evening of baked goods and pizza.

Then we dip down and back up to Bigelow West Peak, a terrific rocky summit that boasts 360 degree views of lakes, mountains, and forests. Under a mile away, Avery Peak offers an encore, then it's down down down to the bottom where we slouch tiredly on the heavily needled forest floor. 
We push hard the next several miles to the top of Little Bigelow Mountain, the last hurdle of the day. Our reward is sweet and juicy, and comes in the form of thousands of wild blueberries. Ever since we entered New England we have seen the low clumped bushes coating either side of the trail intermittently in ever larger quantities. Now we are finally getting ripe berries! The bushes grow everywhere they can get a foothold, but put out fruit most impressively where they are doused in all-day sun. We could spend the rest of the day picking buckets of the tiny jewels and still not make a dent in the number we find on the hillsides going down the mountain. Since we have plans that don't allow for stopping early, we settle for picking on our breaks or as we walk along, enjoying every bite of the antioxidant laden treats. 
We stop in at the Little Bigelow Shelter for a quick break, and note with interest ""The Tubs"", a series of pools along a stream that offer soaking possibilities. We push on however, determined to make a pre-set goal. On the way down we pass a couple that looks familiar, but we place them only when they tell us their names (they didn't remember us at first either). It is PB & J, flip-flop thru hikers who we met back in the Roan Highlands of Tennessee! They reached Georgia and flipped up to Katahdin to head south for a finish. They congratulate us on making it this far, and we wish them the best on their thru-hike as well. 
The last several miles are graded and relatively flat, and we make quick work of them to reach the prize of East Flagstaff Lake. A small campsite sits above a large rock that juts out into the clear sparkling water. If we follow a little path 20 feet to the side we reach a pebbled beach that wraps back around to the boulder. It is a small paradise, and on a day in the high 80s it has been the carrot that kept us going. I change into a pair of swim trunks and hop in. The water is cool, refreshing, and perfect. Checklist joins me and beams in appreciation at the backdrop of mountains. We swim around quite merrily until the setting sun lets up a little. Then we cook supper on the big rock and watch the sun disappear behind the mountains. A loon sounds the lights out call from across the lake and we obey without complaint. A better end to the day would be hard to imagine.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655249,"(A well-maintained Maine boardwalk)We are up early, feeling re-energized after a satisfying evening yesterday. The forest around us is beautiful, and gives us new hiking energy. Now that we are over the Bigelows, nothing big stands in our way. We climb over two unnamed peaks that would have posed a challenge once upon a time in southern Indiana. Now they feel puny and insignificant, mere hills in the shadow of our past conquests. We pass Boston (part of T's tramily) going down the second one. He agrees that they feel almost too easy, ""are we even on the AT anymore?"" he laughs. We see him again when we take a break at West Carry Pond Lean-To. Another NOBO thru-hiker named ""Wilberforce"" joins us on our break and we chat merrily about how nice Maine is. As if to prove our point the trail stays even and unchallenging all the way to East Carry Pond. A sign at the beginning of this section informs us that for the next several miles we are travelling over the exact same route that was taken in 1775 by a company of Revolutionary Soldiers led by Benedict Arnold. The company was headed for Quebec to battle the British, but by the time they got there they were too weakened by the muddy bogs (of what is today Maine) to do much fighting, and thus were unsuccessful with their foray into enemy territory  
At East Carry Pond we are delighted to find a small beach with real sand and miniature waves. We have crushed ten miles and it is only noon, so we stop for a dip. The water feels amazing after a sweaty morning and we soak in it for nearly an hour. After that we dry in the sun and make mental plans to try and beat a forecasted storm to the next shelter. Boston and Wilberforce both pass en route to said shelter, but we linger a little while longer. Another hiker walks by and we recognize her immediately. It's Chef Decker, who we haven't seen since Virginia! We catch up on trail news and learn for the first time that she started on the 7th, just a day before us. It seems somehow appropriate that we are together again just days before the end. 
The three of us hike separately to the Pierce Pond Lean-To, each at his/her own pace. On the level terrain, walking feels as easy and natural as breathing, as long as my mind is occupied I don't even think about what I'm actually doing. The miles speed by at our pace and we all are traveling well past two miles an hour. At the shelter (which is really what the Lean-To is) we dunk in the pond in front of the shelter and dry off with the wind of the incoming storm. 
Supposedly an overly protective Goshawk mother lives in the area, and has injured several hikers in the act of defending her territory and her fledging chicks. We don't see the mythical bird however, and are left to wonder if the chicks have reached maturity . . . or if the mother met an untimely end at the end of a trekking pole wielded by a hiker with good reflexes. This shelter also boasts the unique trait of being next door to a sporting camp that favors thru-hikers. I walk a quarter mile and enter a large complex of buildings that seem out of place here in the middle of nowhere. Inside a door I find a large room with tables, pianos, and an ancient cast iron cookstove. The owner Tim is sitting on the porch chatting chummily with Wilberforce, and when I ask he puts  Checklist and me down for breakfast the next morning. He also offers me a glass of lemonade and some fruit to take home. Boston wanders in, toweling off his shower-soaked beard. He is staying in one of several tiny primitive cabins that offer some solitude for those who are so inclined. The idea of spending a few extra dollars to sleep in a room with no view seems ridiculous to me, but then, to each their own. 
Back at the shelter Wilberforce, Chef Decker, Checklist and me, and another NOBO named ""Viking"" (yes, they're coming out of the woodwork now) all munch on some cheese and crackers Tim sent down. Viking is hilarious, and the chemistry of the group is quite enjoyable. The storm reaches terminal velocity just as the sun sets, and we reminisce about our hikes on the AT while the lightening and thunder crash over a golden hued pond. T reaches the protection of the shelter just in time to enjoy the show, and we congratulate her on a big 20+ mile day. I walk back over to the sporting camp in the dim light of day to tell Tim he has one more for supper, then it is into the tent, where we listen to the loons out on the lake. The storm has passed and we are left with only the odd sprinkle. The night feels peaceful, safe, and tranquil. It is filled with sounds that we know and sights that we treasure.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655250,"(The Kennebec Ferry)Golden light streams across the pond and greets us when we wake up. Packing up camp is a quick  chore since we don't have to make coffee or breakfast. Those things are waiting up at the sporting camp lodge, where a bachelor named Tim is frying pancakes with strawberries, blueberries, and apples. I putter around on his keyboard while we wait for it all to be ready, then we sit down at several large tables. Wilberforce asks me to say grace, so I do, hoping I don't offend anyone by saying it out loud. Afterwards we all dig in and make short work of our piling plates of delicious food. Boston, Straps, and Chatterbox head out directly with plans for a big day. T hangs back mutely, and tells us later that she has decided to go slower and take her time through these last days. She moves out markedly separate from her old tramily, who she has traveled with since nearly the beginning. We are glad to see her change things up; we've noticed tramilies have a way of excluding hikers not inside their tramily, and are appreciative of T's decision to go her own way. Viking and Chef Decker don't hang around either, they both want to get to a shelter 22 miles away, which means they need to get going. 
Wilberforce alone relaxes in his chair and shoots the breeze with us and the two bachelors who made us breakfast. Tim is the owner of this place and makes us feel right at home. He lets me play his guitar, and then asks to hear Checklist and me sing a song. We sing a Psalm, and the peaceful words quiet the room and reverberate around the log walls. Afterwards we thank Tim for his un-looked for hospitality and strap on our packs to go. Several hundred yards down the trail I am following behind Checklist when I feel painful stings on my legs. Several hornets have latched on and are giving me both barrels (we learn later that everyone else in the group got stung as well). Checklist sympathetically watches me bolt off down the trail as she walks along unscathed. The hiker adage holds true: ""the first one gets 'em angry, the second one gets stung!"". 
Several miles of easy hiking brings us to the Kennebec River, where T is already in the canoe that is the Kennebec Ferry situated for her ride over. Greg is the Ferryman who is paid by the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) to take hikers across this river. He paddles T across and then returns for us. Our route across this river is the only time the official AT doesn't involve walking (or some form thereof). A white blaze is painted on the inside of the canoe to hammer home this fact. Many hikers have successfully swum the river when the ferry isn't running, but it is dangerous because an unpredictable dam release can cause water levels to rise rapidly. We make it across alright and hike with T up to the road a quarter mile away, where a driver for the Sterling Inn picks us up along with Wilberforce, who beat us there. T has decided to take a Nero day, Wilberforce needs to get a shuttle to he airport for an event at home, we need to resupply, and the three activities are only available at the local Inn. We arrive and are pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the owners. They have a nice resupply store for thru-hikers, and they also let non-guests take a shower and do laundry for free. We take full advantage of all these services and then ride with Wilberforce and T to a restaurant down the street, where we have a jolly time paying too much for too little. Back at the hostel we say goodbye to our friends for the time being and hop in the shuttle for a complimentary shuttle back to the trail. 
Six more miles go by surprisingly easy, and we make it to the Pleasant Pond Lean-To well before dark. A boys backpacking camp group has taken over the shelter, so we find a spot tucked back into the woods next to a Flip Flop thru-hiker named Camel. From inside her tent she tells us to expect noise at 1:30am. Apparently she begins hiking (insanely) early in the morning to avoid walking in the heat of day. We walk down to the Pleasant Pond dock, but are disappointed by the noise on the water. Private residences are scattered around the shoreline, and several boats are thrumming loudly around the pristine pond. We have a cold dunk anyway, and then return to our tent to get dry and go to sleep.

It feels like perfect hiking weather this morning, but it also feels like perfect rest-in-the-tent weather. The latter wins until 8am, at which point we pack up and walk down to Pleasant Pond for a morning dip. The water certainly is more pleasant without the ruckus of last night. Several paddleboarders are making their morning rounds but other than them we have the pond to ourselves. I walk out until the water is well over my waist and am astonished at the clarity of the water. If it weren't for a betraying shimmer, I could almost believe the water on my legs was just a shadow cast by the morning light.
Determined to make up for our late start, we push several miles up to the top of Pleasant Mountain, where we are derailed once more, this time by an abundance of ripened blueberries. We stop decidedly and pick the sweet fruits for half an hour, forgetting all our thru-hiker worries in pursuit of free antioxidants. We manage to amass about a quart of wild blueberries, which last about a tenth of the time they took to pick. Happy and behind schedule, we plunge down the mountain and stop at a Lean-To for a lunch break. Afterwards we conquer Moxie Bald Mountain and stand victoriously on the rocky summit. 
We don't meet any Northbounders today, but we do meet a SOBO couple who are on their third of the Triple Crown trails (not in a calendar year). They comment on the difficulty of the hundred mile wilderness, which is unhelpful since they haven't met any real obstacle yet that we know of. SOBOs are generally considered untrustworthy by NOBOs, and the two groups have a bit of a rift that puts them at odds, each trying to impress or intimidate the other. 
The end of the day doesn't have any difficult ups or downs, but we do cross a flooded beaver bog that leaves me with soaked feet. I hike the last half mile with a ""sploosh"" sound accompanying every step. We crash in a clearing by a wide river and set up our tent hastily to avoid the hoards of horseflies. Supper is dehydrated lasagna and dehydrated Chili Mac from ReadyWise Meals. The former proves to be the better of the two. In any case we are still a tad hungry when we turn over to go to sleep. We are ready to get to Monson tomorrow for some real food.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655252,"(Blueberries! Picture from yesterday)Horseflies have died down for our river crossing, which is nice. We wait to put on our socks and shoes until we are across the knee dip ford, then it is smooth sailing for three miles to the Horseshoe Canyon Lean-To. We eat the last of our food hungrily - four oatmeal packets and some dehydrated strawberries T gave us - and get up wearily. Two miles later we cross the East Branch of the Piscataquis River (feels a lot like the West Branch to be honest) in the same fashion as the first. We meet a young lady named ""Spotter"", who is headed the same place as we are. That place is Shaw's Hiker Hostel in Monson, ME. The hostel has been open for more than forty years and is the traditional stopping point before the hundred mile wilderness. 
With half a dozen miles left to go we get a nice surprise in the form of Smiles, who is hiking south. We haven't seen him since Angel's Rest, and it is good to catch up one more time before the end. He has had several delays and mild injuries that have left him a little behind his schedule (Grafton Notch) and he is hiking south from Shaw's to make a family event. He lives here in Maine and will come up and finish the 100 mile wilderness and Katahdin after the family event. We shoot the breeze with him for a solid 20 minutes and catch up on trail news. Radioactive is off due to chronic knee problems, Hot Feet and Pony should summit any day now, so on and so forth. This close to the end Smiles looks as happy as we've ever seen him, he's on his home turf, and he feels confident he can complete the trail. The attitude among NOBOs is celebratory as a whole, with the two attitudes being ""slow down to enjoy it"", or ""speed up to finish strong"". 
Several more easy miles fly by at upwards of two miles an hour, and we arrive at the Monson Trailhead by 2pm. A hostel employee picks us up and takes us to the hostel, which turns out to be more of a campus than anything else. Multiple buildings and structures fill the small lot, and tents are erected haphazardly in between. Hikers of all kinds are everywhere, lounging in the small living room, chatting around a fire pit, or browsing gear in the onsite outfitter. It is a tad overwhelming . . . and a bit disappointing. Even in our private room upstairs in one of the buildings we don't feel comfortable. The hostel seems to cater more to the party crowd than it does the quiet folk. 
We head over the local restaurant (basically the only one in this tiny town) and enjoy three entrees between us. Afterwards we buy ice-cream and milk at the gas station and hang out with Chef Decker and T (who put in a long day to get here) at T's yurt. We are all making plans for the end, and it is nice to be with people who have essentially hiked on the same schedule as we have. We have all met the same people, stayed at the same places, and gone through the same weather. The last hundred (and some) miles are not to underestimated, but I can't help viewing it more as a victory lap. We are so close!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655767,"(Entering the 100 mile wilderness)It rained off and on the whole night, but we slept nice and dry (if a bit hot) in our room at Shaw's. When we get up and about we do a brief planning session and decide to leave earlier than planned. The hostel is little disappointing and doesn't really invite us to stay longer than necessary. The breakfast is filling but nothing special, and the trail is calling for us to finish what we've started. We do a hasty resupply and then board the 11am shuttle with three other NOBO thru-hikers named Boots, Flatlander, and Prime. Chef Decker took the shuttle before this one and is already hiking, and T is understandably taking a zero after her big day yesterday. 
The weather is soggy and prone to rain when we embark into what is known as the 100 mile wilderness. This stretch of trail is more remote than other sections of the trail and can only be accessed at several points by rugged gravel roads (so not really wilderness per se). The sign marking the boundary for the area warns hikers to enter only if they carry ten days worth of food. This makes the five of us laugh, as if hikers just tuck ten days worth of food in their napsacks whenever they feel like it. If I carried ten days worth of food at this point I woul be lugging a 60 pound pack around. Many thru-hikers are so fit and so filled with adrenilane by the time they get to northern Maine, that they rumble through the wilderness in just 3 days. We are opting for the slightly less ambitious 6 day trek. 
Prime leads the way to the shelter of choice, followed by Flatlander, Boots, myself, and Checklist. Halfway to the shelter we are hit by a tardy cloudburst, which dampens us thoroughly. At the shelter the boys start a piney fire that brightens the mood considerably, even if it does spark and smoke grumpily. Checklist and I eat deli sandwiches that we packed out for the occasions, and we laugh about thru-hikerisms that we all share on this last leg of our journey. We've all long since given up on our clothes ever getting clean, we all obsess about food or creature comforts on a daily basis, we all accept whatever is thrown our way without blinking, and we all laugh at the fresh energy and naivety of SOBOs. For Checklist and I, this trip has brought us closer together, and it has also made us more confident in our abilities to meet the challenges that arise on a daily basis. I remember the words of a hiker alumnus in Erwin, Tennessee: ""Whenever my wife and I get in a scrap about something silly we just think about all the crazy thunderstorms and gigantic mountains we went through together, and then it doesn't seem like such a big deal"".

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655768,"(Carnivorous Pitcher Plants)In contrast to what has been the prevailing habit, our goal is to get early starts for the rest of our hike. This means leaving no later than 6am sharp, and preferably even before then. Today we get it done and are making miles early. It's a good thing too, because the first half of the hundred mile wilderness is proving to be tougher than we thought it would be. Of course these mountains are still much easier than the 5000 footers in New Hampshire or the 4000 footers of Maine, but the rocky tread slows our pace quite frustratingly. We also have another thing to worry about . . . food! While we grabbed a large quantity from the resupply room at Shaw's, we did shop directly following breakfast. As a result, our food program is a little light on calories. To help stretch food across the day, we delay our oatmeal until several miles in at the Long Pond Steam Lean-To.
With this under our belts we tackle the climbs of the Chairbacks, which come in a relentless barrage of rocky ups and downs. Glad to have 8 miles down and 7 to go, we pause for lunch at the side trail to Cloud Pond Lean-To. Prime comes by, followed distantly by Flatlander. Boots doesn't pass us until near the end of our day as we climb up Columbus Mountain. We find all three of them at Chairback Gap Lean-To, resting before a final push. Their goal is the shelter yet another ten miles ahead, which will result in a 25 mile day. The behavior seems a bit odd given it is already 6pm, but Prime explains he bought too little food and now needs to go faster to make it through the wilderness. We watch them go without a trace of envy, and then proceed to set up camp for the night. The shelter is empty but we find a small spot at the tail end of a rooty clearing behind the shelter instead. This far into the backpacking season there will almost always be some late arrivals.
It is nice to end with daylight left, even if we just spend the time in our tent on our backs. Supper is an experiment wherein we combine instant mashed potatoes with boxed stuffing and a tuna packet. The mixture is filling but not really worth repeating. We make plans for a big day tomorrow over White Cap and then turn in early. Tomorrow if all goes well, we will get our first glimpse of Mt Katahdin!

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655769,"(Our first glimpse of Mt Katahdin!)We fell asleep quite early last night, but alas, a good night's sleep was not to be. We were awakened at 11pm by a hoard of hikers invading our space. A jumble of voices invaded our dreams and the bright white glare of headlamps flashed across our tent for the better part of an hour. We do our best to ignore the clicking of poles and whoosh of fuel burning, but don't get back to sleep until well past midnight. In the morning I look around to see we are surrounded by over a dozen tents and hammocks. One of the former is less than tent feet away from us, hardly respectful in the backpacking world. We pack up quietly and leave camp with a disgruntled feeling, noting with interest the oversized pots and chairs. These aren't thru-hikers, just mere mortals out for a quaint backpacking trip. Several miles down the north side of Chairback mountain we meet a SOBO thru-hiker named ""Obi-Wan"" who reveals that the ensemble is a group of scouts out to do the hundred mile. We are grateful they are headed south, at least we won't run into them again. Maybe they will find someone who can educate them on proper backpacking etiquette and outfit them with headlamps that have a red-light option (a red beam is less obtrusive than a white one and is preferred for night activities when other hikers are around). 
Our spirits lift when we spy a loaded patch of blueberries, and we stop to pick a cupful. They make a nice addition to our oatmeal, and we make good time throughout the morning as a result. The terrain is mild leading up to the Carl A. Newhall Lean-To, where we take lunch and peruse the logbook. Chef Decker passed through this morning, en route to who knows where. Omoo was here earlier today as well. He seems to be rather down, and writes hopefully of finishing so he can return to the comforts of home. We seem to have passed beyond the larger part of the SOBO bubble at this point, and are now running into Flip Floppers coming south from Katahdin after jumping up from somewhere in Pennsylvania or Virginia. We chat with one such fellow who has a multitude of questions about the Whites. The trail is a constant exchange of information, and one can learn almost anything simply by asking everyone he/she meets. For the past week we have been trying to figure out the best route down from Katahdin. The Hunt Trail is the official path of the AT up the mountain, but after completion hikers can choose either to retrace their steps or take a different path down. A popular alternative is the Abol Trail, which we gather is shorter but steeper. The jury is still out on which trail we will take. 
Four peaks await us at the end of our day, all leading to a tired climax atop White Cap Mountain, where for the first time we get a view to Mt Katahdin. The tallest peak in Maine stands unchallenged amid the lakes and hills, and it presents itself now still 70+ miles away, as if to remind us the next several days are just the appetizer to its main course. We've climbed all the mountains today we care to, and we pick our way carefully down the mountain to where a smoky fire is being tended at Logan Brook Lean-To. We filter water and then set up our tent in a private spot nearby.  Hopefully we can avoid any more late night parties.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655770,"(Omoo)On days we really want to crush some miles we've learned to start hiking early and stall breakfast for an hour or so. This helps us feel like the day is normal, even though we are actually traveling a greater distance than usual. Today is one of these days, and we take time only to heat a pot of hot cocoa/coffee before getting on trail. It is just before 5am as we weave our way down the mountain. The sun rises slowly above the trees and enrobes us in youthful light. Blueberry bushes are sprinkled on both sides of the trail and we pause to grab a handful here and there. We reach a shelter (lean-to) but it is still full of sleeping people so we don't stop for breakfast until we reach the next water source. As we cook our fresh blueberries with oatmeal, a young short-haired woman passes. Her name is Pi and we met her at Shaw's Hiker Hostel. Before we left I was telling an incoming group of hikers about the challenges of navigating Baxter State Park (the park that houses Katahdin), having just researched the topic the night prior I was something of an expert. Apparently the spiel was so thorough that Pi thought I was a SOBO who had already summited Katahdin. When she voices this thought now I feel slightly insulted that I don't look the part of a NOBO. To prove my status I push hard the next several miles and pass Pi at the bottom of a hill. Next to fall is Chef Decker, who is camped next to a lake and getting a later start. Finally, I find Omoo climbing the last few steps to the summit. We sit and chat as the rest of the group catches up. Omoo has a fabulous memory and has no trouble remembering who we are. He also can remember specific hikers he met several years ago at certain shelters along the trail. 
When Checklist joins us on top we lead the way down the mountain to Copper Falls Lean-To, where large cascade tumbles down mossy boulders into a deep swimming hole. I change into swim trunks and take a dunk in the cold refreshing water, pleased to find it is well over my head. We've made fantastic time on the flat trail from the top of the mountain and have managed to knock out 12 miles before 11am. On the other hand we still are quite low on food, and we commiserate with Chef Decker, who has similar woes. She brings up the small possibility of trail magic at a logging road 3 miles away, and we are hooked! No matter that few people would even know about the road. Even in the hundred mile wilderness you never know what might happen!
3 miles later it turns out Chef Decker's hopes weren't unfounded. A lady is handing out bags of snacks and is delighted to present us with individual goody bags. We munch on healthy bars while watching our trail angel nurse Pi's nose. Pi got here before we did and blacked out when she stopped to talk. She is unsure why, but lists dehydration or heat exhaustion as potential contributors. She skinned her nose quite handily and has a sore jaw where it smashed into the gravel road, but otherwise she seems to be in good spirits. 
Another man is here as well, and we learn he is Warren Doyle. The name sounds familiar, and he jogs it by explaining he held the first fkt time of 66 days and has hiked the trail the most of any hiker (18 times at last count). He now takes more of a back seat role and helps others complete their hikes. He knows the trail like the back of his hand and has played a part in many of the FKTers of the past. He aided Karl Sabbe in his 41 day record setting stint, and he gave advice to Captain Morgan for what turned out to be a second place finish of 44 days. It is cool to meet such a legend, especially this close to the finish line. 
A red nosed Pi still leads the way to the target for the day, which is a popular spot called the Antlers Campsite. The campsite (which we have mostly to ourselves) is situated on a peninsula that protrudes out into Jo-Mary Lake. We manage to secure an unwanted spot right on the rocky top, where our tent will be unprotected from tonight's rain. Omoo retires to his tent for good but Chef Decker joins us for a swim while Pi relaxes on the rocky shore. We all tell stories about our craziest moments and the different people we've met. When the conversation turns to food we know it is time to break up the party, so we go our separate ways and eat our suppers to the sound of loons calling across the water and waves lapping against the rocks.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655771,"(A sunrise at the Antlers Campsite)Somewhere in the vicinity of 10pm last night a thunderstorm hit with all the ferocity it could gather. For several hours we tossed and turned as our rainfly was tested for miniscule pinhole leaks (it failed that test rather miserably). Finally the downpour moved on and we drifted back to into a deep slumber. This morning we awake to find that the rain raised the water levels in the lake quite significantly. Where the water was several feet from our tent last night, now it is mere inches away. No damage done, we enjoy the novelty of a sunrise over the water from our sleeping bags. Due to the rain and subsequent splashback dirtiness, everyone is slow getting out of camp. Pi and Omoo are the first to leave, followed by Checklist and me. On the way out I lend Chef Decker my battery pack so she can charge her dying phone. Sharing is easy when it means I don't have to carry 8oz of weight all day.
The heavy rain left the trail in a rather puddled state of affairs, and the morning is filled with rock hopping and root jumping. We catch Omoo just before the first shelter and stop with him for a quick morning snack break. He tells us more about his life back home and we begin to grow fond of him. He has a rather melancholy air about him only occasionally broken by the odd joke or spot of humor. He seems all too aware that the world around him is leaving him behind, that few people know or care about the literary masterpiece from which he has taken his name (start with a book about a big fish if you're interested in figuring this riddle out). His hiking pace is decidedly slow and steady, as is his contemplative manner. Our presence raises his spirits considerably, and he makes mention of how having friendly faces around improves one's outlook on the trail. 
We hike with him to the Nahmakanta Stream Lean-To, where we eat our lunch of spam and tortillas. He leaves first, and we hike alone for several quiet miles. Just before the next shelter I take a short side trail to a beach we've been told about. Several hundred yards down the beach sits a picnic table and tent site surrounded by the arms of an encroaching forest. A hummingbird feeder hangs from a tree and a sign reads: ""Another Day In Paradise"". The whole scene is idyllic and makes us want to end our day early. One last hurdle stands in our way however, and it doesn't sit well with either of us to leave it for tomorrow. At the shelter Omoo is rallied for the cause and he follows us up and over Nesuntabunt Mountain to where several tent sites overlook Crescent Pond. 
Several paddleless canoes lean against trees so I break some bark paddles off a log and Checklist and I have a merry paddle round the pond. Chef Decker passed at about 7pm en route to a long day and sets my battery pack down as she waves from the bank. Not long after we call it a day and crawl into our tent. Since this will likely be our last night on water, I can't resist waiting out by the pond for the last minutes of the day, hoping a moose will show itself. I don't have any luck there, but I do get to watch a beaver paddle lazily around the pond on his way home for the night. Several more moments pass by in the darkening stillness, then I say goodnight to the loons and turn in.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655772,"(Chef Decker's family, Chef Decker on the far left)The closer we get to the end, the more ""lasts"" we experience. The last 20 mile day, the last hostel, the last tent site next to a pond . . . It is both devastating and exhilarating. For nearly six months we have lived life on the trail . . . and now that life is coming to a close. There are so many things we can't wait to have back, like time with family and our own real bed to sleep in. There are also so many things we will miss, like the trail community and the chipmunks chattering angrily as we walk by their trees. 
Today is the last day we will need to hike more than 12 miles, so we are up at 4am ready to get it done. By the first light of day we are moving down the trail away from where Omoo's tent still sits quietly on a bed of green moss. These first four miles are customarily silent, with both Checklist and I taking the time to wake up and collect our thoughts. We start our day with breakfast at 7am while sitting on the stick floor of Rainbow Stream Lean-To. This is the second to last shelter on the northbound AT but many thru-hikers are already writing their farewell sign-in. Many express thanks for those who helped them on their journey, others offer encouragement to everyone behind them. It is difficult not to get emotional, and I quench a rising tide of thoughts in order to focus on my footing. The miles of the late morning are not hard, but they are filled with a lot of rocky ground and rooty trip-wires. The side of the trail is also abundant with ripened blueberries and huckleberries that are as tasty as they are delaying.
At Rainbow Spring we bump into a hiker we've seen before, and he introduces himself as Trash (because he picks it up). Trash used to work for the government training auditors, but now he lives in the Virgin Islands (to escape the tax code he knows so much about). We hike a talkative 5 miles with him and then leave him staring at Katahdin from the Rainbow Ledges viewpoint. We've put in 13 miles before noon, but we still have 6 to go before we can call the hundred mile wilderness done. We put in three in just over an hour and are resting at the Hurd Brook Lean-To when Chef Decker catches up. We pass the shelter break baton to her and push on for town. 
An hour later (felt like much longer) we arrive at the Abol Campground, which boasts a restaurant and campstore. We find the restaurant empty except for a family enjoying a late lunch, and gratefully take a seat to ease our aching feet. Our hiker hobble attracts some attention, and as the family gets up to leave the father congratulates us for our proximity to the end. As a reward for completing the hundred mile wilderness we've told ourselves we will eat however much of whatever food we want. First we order an appetizer of Poutine, which is a northern comfort food of fries served with cheese curds and gravy. Next comes a large BLT apiece, followed directly by two very tasty burgers. For dessert we dine on blueberry pie, which moves us from the ""comfortably full"" category to the ""I shouldn't have eaten that"" one. As I prepare myself for the massive hit on the budget the waitress informs me that the friendly dad picked up our bill. We are both shocked and could not have been more surprised at the un-looked for generosity. 
Trash arrives, followed closely by Chef Decker. The two ask us our plans for tenting tonight and when we respond with uncertainty they both offer solutions. Trash offers to pay for a campsite here at Abol Campground, and Chef Decker suggests we pile in a campsite just down the road where her dad, mom, and sister are staying. Her father - Mr. Maps - thru-hiked the trail in 2018 and the whole family has driven up from North Carolina on her big day. We take the option that seems more thru-hiker appropriate and ride to the campground in the back of Mr. Maps' SUV. We set up our tent and then join them at that campground's restaurant, where Mr. Maps tells us to get whatever we want. Checklist is too stuffed for anything but sips of water, but I am happy to please by chowing down on some fish tacos. The family is friendly and welcoming, and between their stays at Shaw's and Millinocket they are caught up enough on trail talk to shoot the breeze for an hour or two. We walk back to our tent exhausted, worn out, and ready to rest up for our second to last day tomorrow.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655773,"(Little Niagara Falls)I'm not quite sure where it first hit us. Maybe it was in that first 80 miles, before we even left Georgia. Perhaps it wasn't until we got deep into Virginia. Somewhere along the lines we realized we may have bitten off more than we could chew. Hiking the Appalachian Trail sounded so simple, after all, it's only four words. But the journey we've been on these past six months has been so much more than what we imagined. Thru-hiking is a lifestyle, and at no point is that fact more obvious than at the end. Today is perhaps the beginning of that end. 
We move quickly in the morning, only stopping for some fruit and bagels provided by Chef Decker's family. We want to get back to the trail so we can register early for The Birches Campsite. The Birches is a campsite specifically reserved for thru-hikers (or for hikers who have done a minimum of the hundred mile wilderness prior to entering the park). Only 12 hikers can fit, so there is some apprehension about getting a spot. The worry turns out to be unwarranted, as we are the 3rd, 4th, and 5th hikers to sign up. Chef Decker pauses just past the Baxter State Park entrance to wait for her family, but we head up the trail towards Katahdin. The ten mile stretch of trail we traverse today is as easy as they come, and it all feels more like a victory walk than a full day's work. We stop to pick blueberries, we stop again at Big Niagara Falls, and we stop again at Little Niagara Falls. Big Niagara Falls is a thundering beast that tumbles into a deep pool of water. I climb down some short cliffs to dunk in the cold swimming hole, but then feel silly when Little Niagara turns out much better. The latter has a massive oasis that is the ultimate outdoor playground. Knee deep sand bars extend deep into the pool of water, surrounded by deeper areas that range from waist high to over my head. A natural water chute has been worn in the rock down one side of the slanted stone face, and we take turns sliding down into a small pool of water. I also have fun launching myself into the foaming current directly at the base of the falls and letting that currently carry me out to the knee deep sand bar. We could easily spend the entire day at either one of the falls, but we want to get to our campsite and be done with hiking until tomorrow. 
We are the first to The Birches, which is a small campsite that sits right at the base of Katahdin. Tomorrow we will climb up to Baxter Peak (the highest peak on Katahdin, and the highest point in Maine) and end our hike at the spot where thousands of thru-hikers have wept on a large wooden sign. Every day for the past week the anticipation has built as we hear of more and more friends finishing. Mr. Clean is done. Florida Man is done. T-Bone is done. Boston, Straps, and Chatterbox are done. South Park is done. More are finishing every day, and tomorrow it will be our turn.
We share the Birches with Trash and his friend Wet Willy, Chef Decker, and Omoo (who we are glad to see make it by mid-afternoon). I gather wood for a nice campfire and we sit around and shoot the breeze as the day winds down. It hasn't quite sunken in that we are essentially done, because we all talk like we have done this entire trip. Who is where? What are the latest stories? So on and so forth.
Eventually we all have to go to bed, but it feels weird to spend our last night in such a fashion. ""This doesn't feel like how it is supposed to end"" I mention to Chef Decker, ""I wish everyone we met on the trail could be here around this fire right now to share the moment together"". And yet . . . perhaps this disjointed and lonely end is more appropriate. I have filled this journal with things we've seen and done, and people we've met . . . 
But that isn't really how thru-hiking goes. Most of the time, it's just you and the trail. You're walking all day, every day . . . and your feet hurt.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655774,"(Checklist and me on Baxter Peak, Mt Katahdin)175 days ago I stood underneath the stone arch at Amicalola State Park with half of the AWOL guidebook tucked in a shiny new ziplock. As we slowly churned through day after day I ripped out the pages of miles that we completed. Each page held 40 miles of trail (20 on either side), so adding in the pages with town information brought the total page count to 230. In northern Pennsylvania I finished my first half of the guidebook and started on my second. Today I have only one page remaining. It contains a sharp spike in elevation with the words nearby saying: ""Mt Katahdin, Northern Terminus of the AT"". It is page 230, and by the end of the day I will have no further need of it. 
We are up early, our batteries fully charged by adrenaline and excitement. At 6:30am we begin the 5.2 mile climb up to our finish line. The first two miles are simple and unobtrusive, and they are gone and over with in a blur of time and movement. From there the trail takes a serious step up in difficulty. Large boulders require thought and dexterity, sparsely placed rebar demands upper body strength, and steep cliffs temper our speed with caution. It would be an exaggeration to say we are the fastest hikers out here this morning, but we are far from slow. Checklist and I pass day-hikers one after the other as if they are standing still. We scuttle up large cliff faces like the handicap ramps at a library. This is a physically exhausting trail, but it feels easy. The massive amounts of adrenaline flowing through our veins may have something to do with that.
Somewhere in the vicinity of 9am we reach a small wooden sign, placed strategically at the top of a steep climb (and I mean ""climb"" quite literally). The sign marks the entrance to the Tableland, an almost sacred approach to Baxter Peak. At 9:20am we reach the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, a large wooden sign with the massive words ""Katahdin"" emblazoned on the front. We touch the sign . . . and our thru-hike is over.
We sit nearby and try hopelessly to process what just happened. Life as we know it has changed. Our journey is complete. Our goal has been attained. Day hikers come and go in the background but we just sit and stare blankly at the clouds swirling around us (we are socked in, to use northern terminology). We are awakened from our stupor when Omoo reaches the top. He is emotional and ecstatic, and he gives us both big hugs. Next is Trash, who has 500 miles down south still to complete. He is thrilled to be here, and his usually composed face beams with a huge smile. Last is Chef Decker, whose story is perhaps the most comparable to ours. She started her hike on February 7th, just a day before we began ours. Her face is wreathed in emotions long before she even reaches the sign. This is it. The end of the road. 
The descent down is quick, with only the occasional word between us. At the bottom Checklist and I hike to the narrow gravel road that is the only public way out of the park. We have one more hitch before we can hang up our thumbs for good. 20 minutes go by and not a soul passes, then we hear a solitary car coming around the bend. The driver sees our outstretched arms and immediately slows to offer us a ride. The leather seats feel nice in the air-conditioned interior of the car as we make the hour long drive to Millinocket, where many thru-hikers go to overnight before heading home. We are dropped off at the 100 mile wilderness inn at 4pm and are checked into our room by the friendly owner. We prepare for our flight home tomorrow and wait for everyone else to arrive. When Omoo and Trash show up we walk over to a local pizza place and split 3 large pizzas and two 2-liters of root beer between the four of us. Afterwards we hang out in the main room of the Inn and wait for the rest of our friends to arrive. Chef Decker's mom and sister went up and down the mountain as well, so they take longer to get back. Also delayed is Wet Willy, who determinedly plugged his way up Katahdin with two blown out knees. He spends nearly 12 hours on the mountain, and doesn't make it to the Inn until 9:30pm. Several other hikers are here at the Inn, and they are the bystanders as our motley group of summiters spreads out around the room to talk about our big day. At 10:30pm we begin to scatter to the safety of our rooms, finally ready to accept the welcoming arms of rest.
Tomorrow we will ride the Inn's shuttle to the bus station, where we will catch the bus to the airport, where we will board a flight to our Hoosier home. 
Thanks for following what has been 175 days of AT journals. I've successfully hummed my way from Georgia to Maine. Checklist and I have had the adventure of a lifetime! We are so thankful to everyone who has encouraged us, aided us, and prayed for us all along the way. In the days to follow this one I plan to make two post-trail entries: 1. Gear & Advice for future thru-hikers, and 2. A thank-you to the people of our thru hike.

Hums,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655962,"‍Final Thoughts  Our abrupt departure from the trail has left us rather dazed. Traveling from Georgia to Maine took us 6 months, but traveling home to Indiana took less than a day. All of a sudden, it no longer matters how much food weighs. Socks are just socks, and I don't have to examine each one to decipher which is the left and which is the right (on the trail a mistake here would mean a blister). We are faced with a complete inability to communicate aptly about what our hike has meant to us. Everything moves so fast. Billboards, signs, and screens all vie for our attention. It will take some time to get used to it all again. If I have any final thought that is first and foremost in my mind, it is that hiking the Appalachian Trail is a big deal. At some point I remember thinking that it was as simple as a four or five month backpacking trip, then back home for supper. I was wrong. The trail required time for planning before we left, and it will require time for recovery now that we are back. Be this as it may, we have no regrets. 
Gear Review  I could say something about every piece of gear, but I'm going to focus on things where I have something worthwhile to say.
-Our Osprey backpacks were fantastic for what they were called to do. They were durable, breathable, and had a great warranty in place. They were heavy however, and if we were to hike again I would probably opt for a Hyperlite pack or a LiteAF pack. 
-I loved the simplicity of our Katadyn BeFree Water Filters, but they clogged easily and stayed that way (I questioned the reliability of the filters after we subjected them to a bleach/water soak). On a second thru, I would follow the masses and pair a Sawyer Squeeze with a CNOC bag. 
-Paracord is better than Zline.
-Toaks titanium kitchenware is the best, so far as I could tell.
-Our Marmot sleeping bags performed well.
-Our Thermarest sleeping pads were great, but we both are interested in trying the foam collapsible pads in the future. They are lighter, easier, and at the end of a long day just as comfortable for young bodies like ours.
-Our MSR Hubba Hubba was quite simply the best two person tent we saw on the trail. Big Agnes provided a lighter option but sacrificed too much in comfort and durability. 
Advice to Future Thru-Hikers
-New hostels are the best, they haven't been commercialized or ruined by the masses. 
-You will never regret saving up more money & time, on the trail you appreciate having extra of both.
-Georgia is a warm-up for NOBOs, and should be treated as such. A fit person should start with 8-12 miles a day, an athlete can aim for 14-16. Either way, stay slow at least until you cross your first state line.
-Be careful of joining a tramily, they tend to close off other friendship opportunities.
