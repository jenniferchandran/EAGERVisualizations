Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519341,"Getting ready for an attempt at a thru-hike this year. My initial entry has to be a picture of my new best friend of the last few months - my dehydrator. I kind of lolly-gagged through this past Fall and then realized that I may need some food for this hike. My wife has been very gracious about the fact that I have commandeered the kitchen during the holidays.As much as I love packaging food, I have to get this wrapped up and start sorting through what gear I am going to take. As many people seem to comment on, I know I will have to ""pack-unpack-whittle down-pack-unpack-whittle down-pack........"" and lord knows all that ""gear fondling"" takes time. This hike seemed like a long ways away, but the days are flying by.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Thu",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519365,"This is a picture of Maine Junction on the AT in Vermont that was taken this past September when my wife and I did a section hike on the Long Trail from Middlebury Gap south to US 4 (to the Inn at the Long Trail). This is where the Long Trail and AT split, with the Long Trail continuing North towards Canada and the AT heading east towards New Hampshire. If I have done my hiking homework properly, play my cards right and have some luck, I hope to see this trail marker again in 2016.In the meantime, I am getting the regularly scheduled medical appointments out of the way. Yesterday was my 6 month dental checkup and the dental hygienist said she thinks the seasons in the Northeast are reversing based on the mild winter we have had so far. I hope she is wrong because when I see the Maine Junction trail marker, I don't want to be in micro-spikes!",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Fri",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519413,"While I am in the final stages of my “dehydration extravaganza” I can get the obligatory third entry for this journal ready. I have been using my computer so far, but will have to take the plunge somewhere soon and start using my phone, as that is what I intend to take with me. It will take some practice for sure, as my thumbs (which look like small Gianelli breakfast sausages) are not the most useful typing tools.
I started mentally mulling over my gear choices. The main ones (pack, sleeping stuff and shelter) are easy. I backpack enough and conducted some backyard testing, that I have settled into just a few choices for each of them and have picked one of each to start this hike with. I need to start thinking about which stove, cook kit and hydration setup I want to start out with next. Luckily it is as simple as going to the basement or the loft in the garage to peruse the options. I have accumulated quite a collection of stuff over the years updating my gear and experimenting with different ways of doing things. I also have the tendency not to get rid of anything, hence I still have my pack from when I was a Boy Scout (it probably is a candidate for the Smithsonian). My wife actually thinks I have “too much camping stuff” - but that is not possible, right?
One piece of equipment I have just recently acquired (or should I say received) is a Spot satellite tracker. I need to play with this some in the next couple of months to make sure it is providing the information we are expecting and how to look at that information. This will give my wife some piece of mind as to where I am, that things are OK and on occasion what brew pub I may be in when in a town.
My challenge is going to be clothes. I have been avoiding thinking about this simply because I know that this will be a “hem and haw” fest trying to decide what to take. In the end I will have to settle on some setup and know that I can swap stuff out via mail drops if needed. I am very fortunate to have my wife willing to be the “hike administrator” for food and gear drops.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sat",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519485,"I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge my wife before leaving on this hike. She will be fulfilling the important role of “Hike Administrator” while I am off on this adventure. She mentioned the other day when reviewing my other entries (she is my editor when possible) and I introduced her as “the Administrator”, that she did not know she really had a choice. Well actually she did, but I just did not let on that it was an option! (that was part of my management training in my last job). In reality she is too nice/helpful and I think she may actually want me to come back from this hike, so she will try and foster my success. When we were section hiking this past September on the Long Trail there were some vague references to bodily harm directed at me, but I think the feelings passed and I made sure I was not in reach of her hiking poles when this occurred. Anyway, she is “on board” with her role and now we just have to get some “turn-over” training done (not talking about the pastry), so she feels like everything is in place.",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Mon",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521611,"OK time to get the sausage links warmed up (see Jan 9 entry) and try to update this journal with my phone. Well --- that only took 10 minutes to type that first sentence (just kidding - really I pounded it out in about 9:30). When I retired the group of guys I worked with presented me with this nice wall mount map of the AT. I have no idea how many times I have referred to it as I get ready to leave on this hike, but it has been great to have it right there for reference. The days are trickling by and while I feel like things are in good order, is seems like it is still too far out to start actually cleaning off the tables where my gear is laid out and start packing. A few good dry runs of loading the pack should be in order though, as I know every trip it takes me a couple of shots at getting the load reasonable. You won't get any pictures of the tables though as it looks like a toddler has emptied the contents of someone's camping gear in a pile. Those pictures people put of all their stuff that will go in their pack - all neat and in order is just not my style. My table looks like the plate of a Old Country Buffet patron, loaded with a little of everything. It looks like I will be heading out from Amicola Falls and taking the Approach Trail, which will slightly alter my first few days. It will be nice to see a little more of Georgia and find out ""right out of the gate"" how much work I have ahead of me to get into hiking shape. From the reading I have done the stairs along the Falls let you know right away!My editor (aka Hike Admin/my better half) let me know there were some additional grammar improvements I could make, so I better make them now because once I get on the trail and start updating at night in state of delirium - all bets on any indication that I actually had an education are off!",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523677,"To back up a few days, we (my wife and I) left Syracuse on Saturday the 12th. We drove to Washington DC to visit my two sons that live there. On Monday morning we headed to Charlotte NC, to stay over on the way to Georgia - with the company of my oldest son and daughter-in-law. Today we drove the remainder of the distance to Amicalola Falls in Georgia.We checked in to the Lodge here and headed down to sign in for my thru-hike. It was sunny and warm and the park was pretty busy for a weekday. I was able to sign in as hiker #699 and get my pack weighed - which was 35 lbs. A little heavier than I would like but does include cold weather gear, which may go home sooner than expected if this weather keeps up.We took some pictures at the arch that marks the start of the Approach Trail. Then my wife and I drove back up to the top of the falls, as my son and daughter-in-law hiked up the falls. We deemed this a ""team effort"" as they were hiking the first mile for me. I will start tomorrow on the Approach Trail just below the Lodge.I think I have the easy part tomorrow because I just need to hike - my escort squadron has to drive back to DC, which I am sure is not going to be fun! I am very lucky and really appreciate having their company right up to ""shoving off"".",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Tue",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523743,"Started this morning from the Amicalola Falls Lodge. It was hard saying goodbye to my escort squadron. It was overcast and cool, looked like it may rain but that never happened and the sun came out. It was a beautiful day but made the inaugural day of hiking more effort, than if it had been cooler. In the first mile I met Odin. He is from NC and hiking for two months. We passed each other all day and saw many other hikers- mostly college students out hiking for spring break. Finally made it to Springer Mountain about 3PM. Due to the unusual heat several people who had also hiked in on the Approach Trail, decided to go just over Springer and stay at the shelter there. There are a bunch of younger guys in the shelter and most of the older ones (including yours truly) are in tents and hammocks in the surrounding woods. I sat at a picnic table with Odin and a young guy from Michigan (did not catch his name) as we cooked dinner and shot the breeze.So based on my progress today- I have completed a whopping .2 miles of the actual AT today. But I promised myself I would start slow and I hate breaking promises I make to myself. Only 2,180 or so more miles to go. Fasten your seat belts.Tom","Amicalola Falls Lodge

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523850,"Well I was the last senior citizen out of camp this morning. I am a notorious dawdler in the morning when camping and will have to change this habit if I expect to have a chance to make it to Maine before the next Ice Age.The morning was cool and the trail was easier than yesterday. In the early afternoon it started to get hot again and I slowed down. I expect that once I get my ""hiking legs"" (no you can't order them from REI), I won't be slowed down by the heat as much. My minimum destination was Hawk Mountain Shelter and although I would have liked to go a little further, the trail guide showed no water sources for the next six miles.   I was not going that far and decided not to carry enough water to stop overnight somewhere.I decided to call it a day at Hawk and just relaxed before making dinner. Good water source here so I will grab extra in the morning when I am fresh and won't mind the extra weight so much. I hiked alone the entire day only seeing a few section hikers going south and passing or being passed by a few north bound hikers. Lots of people at this shelter tonight though.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523958,"I had a little personal excitement today but more later.I got out of camp a little earlier probably due to the fact that I did not try to cook any breakfast. Had to carry extra water because it was around 6 miles until the next source and that included climbs over two mountains. Leaving Hawk Mtn Shelter you descend into Hightower Gap where a nice gentleman from Mississippi was handing out donuts, bananas and soda. I was not smart enough to ask him his name, but I partook in a donut and it tasted great and was much appreciated.The weather all day was clear and sunny. The temperatures did not seem to slow me down as much as the two previous days. I was on target to hit Gooch Mountain Shelter by early afternoon when my personal excitement interrupted things. I stopped to talk with a girl from Germany for a minute then moved on. For some reason I touched my ear and realized that one of my hearing aides was missing. I remembered taking it out to put on sun screen during my lunch break, but apparently did not put it back. So I dropped my pack and hiked the 1.5 miles back up the mountain and was lucky enough to find it on the rock where I was sitting. So back down I went and grabbed my pack. I had not lost too much time, so I decided to finish up the day as planned.Once again lots of people at this shelter tonight.I need to start taking some pictures to include with this verbiage but in all honesty the trail views have not been real good so far. I was given some good advice by a previous thru-hiking couple, to take pictures of the people and that sounds like a good idea. I will do that once we settle into a somewhat regular cast of characters.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524173,"Last night I was just dozing off and I saw all these headlamps in a row walking. I just thought it was a group coming in late to the shelter area. But I found out this morning that an older gentleman actually had a heart attack and was being air lifted out from Gooch Gap (about a mile away). They apparently were able to stabilize him before moving him (I guess about 10 medical volunteers showed up) and it sounded like he is going to be all right. Scary!Today started great for hiking, it was cloudy and cool. Got packed up and on the trail by 8AM, which is good for me at this point. One of the problems is that it does not get light until after 7AM. Since I don't have my pack organized so that everything has its own place - I don't trust packing by headlamp yet.Basically it stayed overcast and misty (on the peaks) until 1PM, then the sun came out. We reached Lance Creek (I was hiking with ""Bighorn"" a guy from Wyoming) at 1:30, so decided to push on to Jarrad Gap for the night. This is the start of a 5 mile section where a bear canister is required to stay overnight o several of us stopped and will hike through the section tomorrow.Setting up at Jarrad Gap was exciting as a storm blew through and my tarp wanted to sail away. But eventually the wind died down and the rain stopped. Temperatures are supposed to drop into the 30's tonight, so that fits my sleeping gear better since it can handle down in the single digits.Today we had a ""double dip"" on the trail magic front. An hour after starting this morning in Gooch Gap a church group from Nashville TN was camped and serving coffee and egg-sausage and cheese sandwiches!! Then at Noon in Woody Gap a church group from western Georgia was giving out hot dogs, chips, brownies and soda. Needless to say I did not have to stop to eat today.Neel Gap tomorrow where I will pick up my first food drop.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524246,"Woke up to temperature in the low 30's. I was warm in the hammock but stepping out it was ""Hello Kitty"" welcome to Jarrad Gap! Got dressed fast, cooked some oatmeal and got hiking (actually that sounds a lot faster than it really happened). I finally had to use the gloves I had in my pack and donned the great grey wool hat my daughter knit me (it is awesome Jess!).I had a short 5 miles to get to Neel Gap, with knowing it included going over Blood Mtn, the highest point in Georgia. Most of us rookies were under the impression it was going to be a long slog up to the peak.After hiking a short time, I came across Mike, a guy from Williamson, NY that I have seen each day. We hiked together off/on in the crisp morning air as the sun would peek through once in a while.We finally reached the summit of Blood which was socked in by cloud cover, so no view this morning. There also were quite a number of weekend hikers, Boy Scouts and other thru-hikers. So we took a break and headed down.Mike took off like a rocket on the 2 mile descent to Neel Gap. Only because he needed a shoe adjustment did I catch him a mile later. We discussed getting a bunk at the hostel located in Mountain Crossings (an outfitter the trail goes right through) or a cabin at Blood Mountain cabins just down the road from Mountain Crossings. Once we found out the cabins came with a shower and included washing of clothes, the deal was sealed - the cabins it was.We split the cost of the cabin, got showered and dropped the laundry. Mike and I headed back up to Mountain Crossings so I could pick up my food that I mailed (and they held for me). Mike had to pick up some more food in the outfitter store there. While we were doing that and checking in at home by phone, Odin another hiker we have met asked where we were headed. We told him we have a cabin and if he wanted the couch for the night, it was his. He joined us and we all went down and started tearing apart/repacking our packs with the new food we now had.In the office at Blood Cabins they make pizza and have soda and other stuff. Mike and I both got a pizza and we settled in for the night, but as we walked back to the cabin it was starting to snow. So a good night to be indoors. We will get up in the morning and head out. Probably won't get real far, but at least put on a few miles.","Jarrad Gap

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524367,"Mike and I left Blood Creek Cabins and stopped at Mountain   Crossings to do a couple of quick errands. Then we were on the trail by about 9:20AM or so. The wind was whipping and there was a dusting of snow throughout the woods. We had to stop a couple of times to add various pieces of clothing to keep warm despite hiking uphill. The sun came out and it did warm up enough to melt most of the snow. We were in/out of the wind all morning (which continued right into the afternoon).Around Noon we found a sunny spot out of the wind and had lunch. In the early afternoon we dropped into Tesnatee Gap with an immediate climb over Wildcat Mtn, which was harder than expected. Other than that the hiking was not too bad the entire day.Our goal was to get water at the next gap, then hike until we either ran out of time or hit the next shelter. We were packing a good amount of water in case we did not make it to the shelter. By 4:15PM we decided to camp along side the trail.Odin, who did not leave with us this morning came in shortly after 5PM, along with a young guy, Chris from Indiana.We all sat and made/ate dinner and then headed off to bed early. It is supposed to get down to freezing tonight, so getting in bed is relaxing and warm. Today was kind of notable in that there were several places where you had a view of the surrounding mountains.Not sure what our goal will be for tomorrow, but we will discuss in the morning before we head out.","Neel Gap

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524499,"I woke up this morning early and tried to fall back to sleep but it was not in the cards. So I put on my headlamp and quietly started packing up. The moon had been out all night and as it started to get light when you looked to the east the skyline was red - looking to the west it was dark and the moon was bright. Kind of cool!!I got packed up and saw Mike was stirring so I told him I was going to hike to the next shelter (about 4 miles) and cook something there for breakfast (that something has been oatmeal every time).The day was starting out nice, sunny and cool. The hiking was pretty easy so I made it to Low Gap shelter about 9:15AM. Mike pulled in along with Chris who stayed with us last night. We all ate, gathered water and took off heading to Blue Mountain shelter, which would give us an 11 mile day. It was longer than we wanted but the trail was just rolling, so we thought it was a possibility.   At 4 miles out from the shelter we looked at the profile map and felt confident that we could make it without too much problem.Everything was good until the last two miles, which took forever. The ups and downs were not bad, but the trail became real rocky, making footing our primary concern. This is always mentally challenging anyway, but topping it off by it being our longest day yet - made the last 2 miles a real ""slog fest"".I pulled into the shelter shortly after Chris, followed by Mike 20 minutes later.   Odin showed up about an hour after Mike. It was sunny and warm, so setting up camp was easy and we just sat and talked while cooking dinner with a couple of the other hikers (Two Socks, Bob).At the shelter we also ran into The Doodah Man, who I emailed back/forth with prior to starting the hike. It was great to meet him finally.We are back to 8 mile days tomorrow, with the goal being to reach Trey Mountain shelter. There are two good climbs on the profile map, so it will be interesting to see how tough it actually is.Once again, lots of people camping at the shelter. These places get good use this time of year.","White Oak Stamp

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524654,"Once again woke up to clear skies and a nice sunrise. I was up early again and started packing up in the dark.Once Mike was up we went over to the shelter and used the table to cook some breakfast. Once finished, Mike headed out and I did shortly after. The Doodah Man and his friend Merle were right around us too.We had to climb over Blue Mtn and then descend into Unicoi Gap. As we crossed the road to pick up the trail, we ran into another church group that was handing out food to hikers. There was soup, breakfast burritos, hot chocolate and all sorts of snacks. On top of that they had boxes with toiletries. It was unbelievable. I was chatting with a lady who was helping out and found that she was originally from Rochester.After eating a little of many things, we headed up out of the gap. Merle was returning home (Ashville) as he was hiking with Doodah for just a few days. So Doodah, Mike and I continued on.As happens everyday, we all got separated but keep crossing paths as each one of us stops for a break.We had two goods climbs today with the last one taking us over Tray Mtn. The weather was sunny and warm all day.   As we started up Tray Mtn, we went by two older gentlemen that had been camping at the base of the mountain at the end of a fire road and had been cooking hot dogs for passing out to hikers over the past two days. They were out of most everything but had bananas and soda left, so we all grabbed one of each. We stood and talked with them for a few minutes and found out that they did this same thing a couple of times each year. They said they enjoy talking to everyone and finding out where they come from.We arrived at Tray Mountain shelter shortly after 3PM. We got setup and ate. We will try to get up early and get going tomorrow, as there is a chance of rain late morning and it will be good to get some miles in before that starts.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524828,"The shelter we stayed at was on a ridge and the wind blew off and on fairly strong all night.We were up at 6:30AM and started hiking right at daylight. The reason is, there was a 50% chance of rain starting late morning and we wanted to get as close as we could to Deep Gap shelter as possible, before it started.We just put a bunch of food in our pockets and ate while we were hiking.Dick's Creek Gap is only 3 miles or so beyond the shelter, so it seemed like a lot of the hikers were heading to the gap to either get to Top of Georgia Hostel or Hiawassee for the night, to get out of the rain. So Mike and I thought there would be few people at the shelter.We arrived at Deep Gap shelter about 12:30PM and there was one girl there (Food Bag is her trail name). We grabbed a spot in the shelter, to avoid the possibility of packing up a wet tent/hammock tomorrow morning should it be raining all night.It did start to sprinkle about 4:00PM or so. By this time the shelter was totally full and there are many people setup outside.Everyone just laid down after eating even though it was still light out.We ended up getting some good down time this afternoon without hurting our planned mileage, so that was good.Mike and I have a bunk reserved tomorrow night at the Top of Georgia Hostel. I have a food mail drop to pick up and we can get a shower and laundry done.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524859,"Last night the storm that was predicted never materialized, but the clouds did fall down on the mountains so there was pretty heavy fog. With the soggy weather, everyone was in the ""sack"" pretty early.Our initial stay in a shelter was not bad - it was quiet and the horror stories of mice running all around did not happen , but I did have a couple of nibbles out of a small piece of camping towel I use to dry my pots and spoon.Just as it was starting to get light a couple of the younger guys got up and went on the porch of the shelter to start packing up. Everyone else was still sleeping with the fact that most of us were headed less than four miles to the Top of Georgia hostel, no one was in a hurry to get up.Well the two on the porch started talking basically out loud. So one by one people starting getting up. One of the other young guys got up and told one of the guys who was talking that he now had the trail name of ""Alarm Clock""! Alarm Clock did not like his new name, but the guy who donated the moniker, said he needed to start being more aware of how loud he was and he was just trying to help him out. Kind of cool the younger guys policing their own.Well we got to Dicks Creek Gap at 10:30AM and two minutes later the shuttle from the hostel pulled in! Although it is just a half mile down the road, we gladly jumped in.When we checked in, for $5 they do your laundry and supply you with hospital scrubs while you wait. We took showers and I grabbed the packages I had mailed here, sorted my food then we were off to Hiawassee for Mike to pick up some supplies at the drugstore and then we met Doodah at an ""all you can eat (they call them AYCEs on the trail). Doodah had stayed at the Holiday Inn Express last night.The hostel runs shuttles to Hiawassee every hour all afternoon at this time of year, so we just waited for the next one to come and returned.By 6:00PM we were hungry again and they sell hot dogs and pizza to cook in the community kitchen in the bunkhouse. I grabbed two hot dogs and split a pizza with Mike. They have a scale in the bathroom, but I did not weigh myself because it is hard to imagine that I lost any weight after today! This hostel is full tonight, all the bunks are taken and there is overflow of people camping in the yard.It was a beautiful day again here in North Georgia, so it was tough to not be hiking, but showers and clean clothes are ""king"", so we accomplished that.If everything goes well tomorrow, we finish Georgia and start in North Carolina. So a little milestone completed.","Deep Gap Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524975,"I got a text from Doodah this morning as we were packing up at the hostel and he said he was leaving the trail. I am sure he will update his journal in time, but we were looking forward to hiking with him, so we hate to see him leave.Everyone at the hostel had re-supplied either with a food drop that was mailed or from shopping in Hiawassee yesterday. At any rate everyone's pack is once again heavy with multiple days of food. The hostel had a scale so the popular thing to do before getting in the shuttle, to head back to the trail head, was to weigh your pack and lament how much it weighed.Mike and I missed the first shuttle back but caught the second one and were hiking with Chris (young guy from Indiana) by 8:40AM.As usual when you leave a gap, you are climbing first thing. The weather was overcast and cool - and stayed that way all day.We took a lunch break at a place called Blue Ridge Gap. The task at hand was to reduce the size of your food bag. Overall the day was uneventful other than we did leave Georgia and now are in North Carolina. We had a bunch of people collected at the state line, as everyone was taking pictures.Late in the day it actually started to sprinkle as we set up camp. We are staying at Bly Gap tonight, just over the border and there are a handful of other hikers here as well. It is supposed to rain tonight, but hopefully the wind won't be too crazy.","Dicks Creek Gap

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525080,"Bly Gap is at 3800 feet and as we went to bed last night the clouds descended over the mountains. The wind was almost nonexistent, and although it did not rain, that may have been better. This is the first time I have experienced this heavy fog in a hammock and although the tarp covers you, gear still gets damp with all the moisture in the air. It was bad enough that people in tents had the same problem.Our plan for the day was to get to Standing Indian shelter, see what the weather was like at that point and if it looked like it would clear and we felt ""saucy"" - we would try to get over Standing Indian Mountain which is 5400'+ in elevation.Basically the mist that came in overnight hung around all day. We were hiking in rain gear and using pack covers. After a couple of hours of hiking (which included some good climbs), we stopped at Muskrat Creek Shelter and had something to eat and then moved on, as it we got cold fast.Bob from Portland ME was hiking with us. I met Bob the first day of hiking. He was headed up Springer Mtn to start and I was on my way down (having camped on Springer the night before. Our hiking paces are similar, so we have been camping at the same spots many nights. The three of us (Mike, Bob and yours truly) were spread out pretty good late in the morning, and as I arrived at Deep Gap (yes there must be one in every state), I saw a sign saying there was Easter trail magic just down in a parking lot. When I got there, there was a group of people called The Omelet Angels, who for 25 years have been here on Easter Sunday making omelets to order for passing hikers.As I set my pack down, a lady come over and gave me a menu to fill out for my order. It not only included an omelet with whatever you wanted in it, but bacon, hash brown casserole, cut up fruit, coffee or chia tea latte. They had baked goods and Easter candy. Then as part of your menu - you got to order a sandwich, chips, pickles and fruit to take with you. It was unbelievable!! Now this happened right before we got to Standing Indian shelter, but with a full stomach and the weather still bad, our ""sauciness"" disappeared and we decided to tackle Standing Indian Mtn tomorrow. It is raining as I type this and is supposed to go all night. Hopefully it will clear tomorrow for our hike over Standing Indian.","Bly Gap

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525273,"No cell service tonight so I will post this sometime tomorrow hopefully.I left Standing Indian shelter just before 8AM. Mike and Bob had both left already. Our plan was to stop at Carter Gap shelter, eat lunch and see if we felt like hiking a little farther.The first climb was 700' change in elevation up Standing Indian Mtn. The day was starting overcast and cool but it was not raining. Halfway up the mountain, the sun started to peek through and in a short time it was clear, with a nice blue sky.The climb up SI was not bad at all as they used switchbacks to get to the top. Bob and I were together at the top but as we started down, we ran into Mike. We all sat down and rested because we were out of the wind and the sun was on us.On getting up to leave, we confirmed Carter Gap shelter would be the next stop.I was the first one to the shelter and decided that I was going to cook a dinner, because I did not have to cook last night due to the fact I had the lunch the Omelet Angels made us. That made my food bag one meal lighter! Bob rolled in then Mike.While we were there two friends from Indiana who are hiking together arrived, as well as a man from Spain (he hardly spoke any English) and a girl from Holland. It was only a little after Noon, so we decided to push onto Betty Creek Gap.Bob and I arrived shortly after 3PM and Mike was along about 30 minutes later. The old campsites are closed at Betty Creek Gap so the areas can recover. So along with a handful of others, we are scattered in the woods off the trail.The hiking today was fairly tame compared to early days of this hike.

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525341,"It was clear as a bell last night and there were tons of stars out. But that meant the temperature got down there too - I think it may have been in the 30's.At the end of yesterday Mike was having some serious knee issues. This morning he told Bob and I that his hike is over. I am sure he is quite bummed out but the problem needs to be looked at. Nothing is for sure when you are walking up/down mountains all day with a pack on.The day started once again sunny and cool. I made sure I ate breakfast, as that seems to make a difference in how my hiking goes. Lots of people just grab granola bars, candy, etc. and start the day. Does not seem to work for me.The trail was again tame until we came to the actual climb up Albert Mtn. Then it reminded me of what the trails back home in the Adirondacks are like. Only this went on for only a short distance not the long climbs in the ""Daks"".We got to the fire tower and took a break. Took some pictures of the view and the 100 mile painted on the fire tower. The fire tower is supposedly at 100.1, but I am not going to quibble over .1 of a mile.After that we descended a long ways only to have a short climb before heading down to Rock Gap shelter. This shelter is the one where earlier a couple of trees fell on it while some people were sleeping. I don't think anyone was hurt and they have repaired the shelter already.We are going to stay here tonight to make sure Mike can catch the mass transit bus that runs to Franklin, NC where he can make arrangements to get back home to NY. A couple of random observations. One is I am becoming a huge fan of the switchbacks they use here. Although it adds to the distance I am able to get to the top without stopping in most cases now. That definitely was not the case at the beginning of this escapade. Another thing I notice is the number of young people who are hiking this trail with us that smoke. I don't mind - to each his/her own, but it can't make it any easier hiking up and down all day.Bob and I will also go into Franklin tomorrow to see if Mike needs any help getting his stuff that was mailed there and making his arrangements to leave.","Betty Gap

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525508,"I got up just as it was getting light. It is now starting to get light before 7:00AM so that is great since most of the geriatric set is up earlier and could get started for the day.Bob headed out and I followed shortly after. We only had a little under 4 miles to cover to get to Winding Stair Gap where we would catch a shuttle into Franklin, NC. Mike was staying at the shelter to catch a ride into Franklin from about .1 of a mile down in Rock Gap.Once again the day started cool and sunny. Overall we have had good weather to start this hike.Just as I arrived at Winding Stair Gap (Bob was there already), the shuttle came to the parking lot. We hopped on the mini-bus that was half full from hikers back at Rock Gap and headed into Franklin. It is kind of amazing that they run this service free of charge for the hikers, but it does bring some business to this town for sure for the 3 months in the Spring, (North bound hikers) and again in the fall with the Southbounders.We were all dropped just off the edge of the center of town at the Budget Inn and everyone fanned out from there. Bob and I are splitting a room which was only $45. But this is not a place you would take your wife. However one guy pointed out that we all have been sleeping in the woods most nights, so this is definitely welcomed.The guy who runs the Budget Inn - Ron Haven, is quite a character and promoter of Franklin. On the bus (that he was driving) was a friend of his, ""Baltimore Jack"" who I believe had thru-hiked this thing several times. He provided some insight on the hike from experience as we descended into Franklin. We got checked in and cleaned up. I walked up to check with Mike, who was waiting for his daughter from Tennessee to pick him up. So he will be on his way back home to NY.We ate, did our laundry and relaxed. They also run a shuttle around the town so you can get any supplies you may need. We hopped off at Walmart and picked up a few things.Upon returning to the room we walked to the Lazy Hiker Brewery and grabbed something to eat. This place is unique in that they only serve beer. For food there is a food truck in the parking lot where you order, then take it in the brewery. Just relaxing now and we have planned to stay here tomorrow. The weather looks bad the next couple of days and we will be well above 4,000' and even 5,000' most of the time. I hate taking a day off so soon but if we can avoid 1 of the two bad days, it looks like it clears up nice in the forecast.","Rock Gap Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525785,"Not much to report today. This was our first true zero day. We got up and the First Baptist Church sends down a van every morning to pick up hikers and they serve a free breakfast each morning for a few weeks in the Spring. Pancakes, bacon, muffins, OJ and coffee. I am getting repetitive here, but it was great!They shuttled us back and Bob and I spent a couple of hours pulling our packs apart to look for things we could possibly send home. We also repacked our food bags. Exciting stuff!!Then we went down to the post office to each mail home the few things we felt we could do without. I would like to say that we each reduced our pack weights, but in reality for both of us it was just small things that we won't have to handle while getting the gear that we need. This may go on for a time or more as we get down to the true essentials.On the way back we walked over to look at the Nikwasi mound, which was built by the Cherokee Indians who lived in the area in the 16th century. It is a huge mound of dirt that I think served as a focal point for the tribe spiritually and socially. Bob is a history buff so he was the driver for walking over there to check it out. I have never heard of anything like that, so it was neat to see it.The afternoon was non eventful at least on my part. Bob being our cultural ambassador, went to a museum up on Main Street. I on the other hand, walked to the drugstore. In my defense, I did pick him up some Advil.I did get to FaceTime some with my son Jared, and got to see the basement renovation they just had completed. It looks awesome.We headed up to a 50's themed restaurant in town called Motor Company Grill. Had a great milk shake along with dinner.Then back to the motel to pack up so we are ready to head back to the trail tomorrow morning.I also got to talk with my daughter Jess tonight for the first time. I wanted to make sure to call as tomorrow is their anniversary and I had good cell service here. So Happy Anniversary to Jess and Matt!It rained here most of the afternoon, so we are hoping that tomorrow is not too bad. But no matter what, we need to get back at it.","Winding Stair Gap

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525953,"Bob and I got up again to catch the van up to the First Baptist Church. They told us yesterday to come back, so we did as we were told. Yesterday was pancakes and bacon, so the joke was they said today we have bacon and pancakes. Need I say, it was great!We then returned to the motel and grabbed the shuttle back to the trail. As we rode up into the mountains it was cool to see the valleys in fog, the lower sections of the mountains clear and the peaks in the clouds. The trees in Franklin are starting to bud, but not so at the higher elevations. We got dropped off where we exited it on Wednesday and we were hiking by 9:30AM. The rain had stopped but it was cloudy and basically remained that way all day with a few times of sun peaking out. Right from the start we headed up having to go from 3600' to 5000', but it was over 4 miles so not really too bad. I have to say it was great to be hiking again. The day off probably was good for us, but once you get your stuff in town done, have some non-dehydrated food and are all clean the time drags a little. But I have to say Franklin was a great place to stop.I took a break at the base of Siler Bald. The balds are just tops of the mountains where the trees have not crowded out the grasses. They look like pastures and probably were at one time. I will post a picture.Bob and Odin came along just as I was putting my boots back on. They stayed for a few minutes and then took off. Our minimum destination was a campsite that was 8 miles or so from where we started. I arrived there about 2:40PM and Bob came along just about 20 minutes later.He said no matter what that that was as far as Odin was going. Bob and I decided to push a few more miles which took us over Wayah Bald which had a stone tower on it with a great view even with the overcast skies. I have a video from the tower but will have to wait for a good WI-FI connection to upload it.As we headed down off the tower it started to sprinkle. We were looking for a campsite that was listed in the guide. But in reality it was right at the junction where you had to turn to get to Wayah Bald shelter. Luckily the rain was brief and I got setup without any problem.Bob and I both just cooked and retired for the evening. It is kind of crazy how once you are done with everything, a good many people just crawl in their tents for the night even though it is still light. It will be interesting to see if that changes once the weather is warmer.So we are camped here along with a bunch of other hikers as usual.","Winding Stair Gap

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526121,"It rained a little over night so the tarp to the hammock was put away wet. But the sky was clear as we broke camp. The agreement Bob and I made was to get to the Wesser Bald shelter. He left about 50 minutes before me, so I was not sure if I would see him until the end of the day.The trail was pretty tame for the first 4 miles until Burningtown Gap. As I approached the gap I could hear voices and see many vehicles. Then remembering it was Saturday, I realized that there may be a group doing Trail Magic! It was, and all the hikers passing through received sausage, biscuits and gravy, along with coffee, yogurt and juice. It was the Burningtown Baptist Church putting it on and once again it was awesome.So leaving the gap was a long climb, but was made easier by a full stomach. A mile into the climb I stopped to filter some water at Cold Spring shelter, which was easy because the spring coming out of the side of the mountain had a pipe and was right on the trail.Just before Tellico Gap I came up on Bob (about 9 miles into our day). We sat in the gap on a wood retaining wall and ate some lunch. Back at it, found us climbing again to Wesser Bald and the observation tower at the top. Since the day was sunny and clear the view was spectacular almost 360*. After checking out the view, we had less than a mile   to the shelter area we had planned on staying.Overall the day was perfect hiking weather - cool and sunny.   It is supposed to get cold tonight, perhaps low 20's. I should be fine with the sleeping gear I have, but I know there are a few of the people we have met that are not prepared for it to be that cold. Will be sleeping with the water filter tonight, so it doesn't freeze.Tomorrow will be a short day I think because after a few miles of rolling descent, the trail dives down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) where they whitewater kayak and raft. We will stay just short of the NOC to take it easy on our knees, (doing most of the descent tomorrow, but leaving 1 mile for Monday morning). We need to stop at the NOC On Monday to pick up our mail drops when it will not be as busy.I was talking with my daughter Jess the other night and she asked how I was doing? She said rightly so that I have the technical info in this journal, but not how I feel I am doing or what I think thus far. That would be a good idea to add an entry that speaks just to what my thoughts are about this trip after the first few weeks. As time goes on, it would be interesting to see how it changes. However adding that to a normal journal entry would make it longer than War and Peace. I will try to add something separate.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526296,"A short day for a couple of reasons. First we did a couple of longer days out of Franklin and are feeling good. It probably makes sense to take it easy today as we have a big climb out of the NOC tomorrow after we pick up our mail drops and some fuel for stoves. Also since today is Sunday and the weather is beautiful, the NOC is most likely real busy. We will get up and hike the remaining mile in the morning, get our stuff and head out.I also made a reservation at Fontana Lodge for Thursday night, where I will stay overnight, pick up a six day supply and head into the Smokies Friday morning. Bob is planning the same. Cell coverage for Verizon has been pretty good so far - not always for calls but you almost can always text and get email.Today was beautiful weather and hiking (short days almost always are :-) ).   The trees at this elevation (2200') are starting to bud as well as the bushes.We got to Rufus Morgan shelter about 1:00PM, setup and relaxed. I actually laid in my hammock about an hour! Plan is to get out in the morning by 8:00AM, so we are at the NOC when they open.The picture I will post today is my vote for the most important plant on the hike so far. It is the rhododendron.It furnishes some degree of shade while hiking, when the hardwoods have no leaves, it gives you some cover when you have to make those quick ""calls of nature"" and the most important use is to create a spillway to fill your bags or bottles to filter water. So that is my vote so far.I was talking with my wife the other day and she told me that her brother Kevin mentioned a couple that hiked the AT a few years ago and that he worked with the husband. The couple I think was Flossie and Grey Squirrel who thru-hiked in 2014. The funny part was that I was introduced to them through my cousin Pat. Last October they were kind enough to meet me for lunch and talk about their experience. It was very helpful. Anyway small world.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526450,"I forgot to report something neat from the day before. As I was starting to hike I took a quick look at the trail map on my phone to make sure I was headed north. I know it sounds goofy, but I don't need any extra miles on this hike by heading in the wrong direction. Anyway I had my hiking poles tucked under my arm with the handles sticking out in front of me. All of a sudden a bird landed on the pole and looked up at me, well I just about through them in the woods as it startled the day lights out of me. Can't wait until I see my first snake!!Now back to our regularly scheduled program.Bob and I got up as planned and we're headed down to the NOC by 8:00AM. Since it was only a mile we were there in short order. Since we had to wait for the outfitter to open at 9:00AM to pick up our mail drops, we headed into the Rivers End restaurant for some breakfast. And breakfast we had - I don't know about Bob, but I was stuffed.We picked up our packages, repacked our food bags (that seems to be a regular task lately), then we headed out. The day was once again sunny and not quite as cool as the day before.The hiking started at 1732' and we would eventually top out at 4710' on Swim Bald. So for you numbers people (including me), that was 2978' in elevation gain. Mostly it was not too bad, but after a long steady climb of about 3.5 hours, they threw in the one little ""ditty"" that went basically straight up. We both finally made it to Swim Bald around 3:00PM.Now that is another thing. They talk about these ""balds"" and the assumption is that at least they are treeless. Well so far in North Carolina, they seem to be taking some ""poetic license"" with the word bald. Swim Bald was neither bald, nor was there any place to take a dip. So I am not sure where a name like that came from.We then had a little less than a mile down to Sassafras Gap shelter where we are spending the night.","Rufus Morgan Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526592,"Last night it got pretty cold and the wind was fairly constant all night. It gets kind of crazy (the wind that is) up high. During the day not really that noticeable, but at night it gets your attention. Getting up was exciting to see how fast you could get dressed.Our plan for the day was to get to Brown Fork Gap shelter, which was 9.1 miles away. The first order of business was to get up Cheoah Bald, which tops out at just over 5000'. One note here, this actually had a small bald spot which made for a good view to the south. The sun was out and it was fairly clear. I arrived on it just before Bob. We decided to sit for a few minutes and soak in the view. Soon other hikers arrived on the top, including a 68 year old Japanese man from Long Island, NY - his name is ""Chicken Feet"". A 71 year old lady from Virginia was also there. She said that she has been section hiking the AT for years as day hikes and is expecting to complete the trail this summer. While we were there the one younger person in the group took a picture of us all since we were all older.We left Cheoah and started the rest of the day. The trail went up and down but ultimately fell from the 5000' we had gained in the morning all the way down to 3100' in Stecoah Gap. The final descent seemed to go on forever. When I got to the gap, there was a parking lot with a couple of picnic tables. Someone had left bananas and apples on the tables for hikers. I took a break and had an apple and some food from my bag. It was then I looked at the guide book and noticed that the big climb of the day that Bob had referred to in the morning was the infamous ""Jacob's Ladder"". If you do any journal reading, this climb gets mentioned often. For the elevation geeks, it means 600' in elevation in .6 of a mile - in other words ""steep"". Well it took a while to put that bad boy to bed, but then the shelter was just .6 miles away, so the day was almost over.Today the weather was sunny again but cooler than yesterday. Overall this was one of the tougher days I think we have had, but we got done what we planned.

I had heard others call him this but finally got an explanation on Cheoah Bald yesterday. His trail name is Finnegan, in short to recognize his Irish heritage. He also has a journal on this site in case you want to check it out. So going forward Bob is Finnegan! (Although I probably will forget and call him Bob)As I said yesterday our plan was to go short today in anticipation of arriving at Fontana Dam tomorrow late morning. Finnegan took off from Brown Fork Gap shelter about 8:30AM and I left about 20 minutes later. Not much to say about the hiking in the morning other than it was not bad at all. We met at a road crossing and discussed maybe pushing beyond the shelter, but we would meet there and decide.Shortly after Noon we were both at Cable Gap shelter and had something to eat. We must have been feeling ""chipper"" because we decided to go on and get one sizable climb out of the way rather than leave it to tomorrow.So we plundered on and ended the day in Walker Gap. Just as I reached the top of the last climb of the day you could see Fontana Dam and the lake from the ridge. I don't know how big it is but it is huge! The only bummer about stopping here was that we had to go down .2 of a mile to get water. It does not sound like a big deal, but at the end of the day it is great if the water is close by - this is the advantage of the shelters.It is supposed to rain tonight, so if that happens we may be packing up some wet stuff in the morning. But we are headed to the Fontana Lodge for the night where we have our mail drops for our entry into the Smokies waiting for us.We should be able to do some laundry and of course get a shower, so for one day again will ""smell like roses""!!The weather today was kind of overcast and cool, with the sun peeking out once in a while.When we were eating tonight we both agreed that doing the few extra miles was worth it.   We have less than 3 miles to get down to Fontana tomorrow morning.","Brown Fork Gap

While we waited for the shuttle a woman who was dropping off her son to continue his thru-hike, asked if we wanted a ride to the lodge. We arrived at 9:00AM and to our surprise they had our rooms ready so we checked in and got cleaned up. Lots of exciting stuff followed, like doing laundry, picking up our mail drops and reorganizing our food bags (do you notice a pattern here?).The rest of the day was spent relaxing and getting ready to enter the Smokies tomorrow.That was about it.

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527266,"I was able to talk a while yesterday with my lovely Hike Administrator (aka Kathy my wife) and she told me that she was going in and cleaning up my journal posts when she had time. Just want to say ""thank you"" honey!! I do re-read them before posting but after hiking all day I am sure that it is about an effective editing process as a screen door is, in ""keeping the wind out"". I was up early because I needed to put my pack back together after drying a few things out. The first shuttle from the Lodge to get back to the trail was at 8:30AM.
I also needed to check with Finnegan to see how he was feeling. Yesterday afternoon he was feeling a bit ""under the weather"" and was not sure if he would be leaving this morning. Once I spoke with him, he told me that he was going to stay at the Lodge at least one more night. So I said goodbye and hopped on the shuttle. I am hoping that he can get back hiking in the next couple of days so there is a chance we will be able to hike together.
The shuttle dropped me off about 8:40AM and I was on my way. I had to cover a few miles to get to Fontana Dam, where once you walk over the dam, you enter The Great Smokey Mountains National Park. There is a short walk up a service road then you take off back to the woods. This junction is where you record your entry date on your permit, and deposit it in a box. I am not sure why they collect these because the box was so jammed with permits, it was hard to even stuff it in.
The entry into the Smokies is a long gradual climb of about 4 miles. It took a while to get that completed but after the initial climb, the trail gets easier with short ups/downs.
It was intermittently overcast and sunny all day but it was colder than it has been in awhile. I was told by another hiker that rain was in the forecast, but instead around 2:00PM, it started to snow lightly. That was followed by some sleet, then it stopped and the sun came back out. With the temperatures probably in the 40's, I am glad it was snow and not rain.
Just before 4:00PM I got to Mollies Ridge shelter, which was my destination for the day. I expected the shelter to have few people there, but was surprised to find that I was the only person here. Shortly though a young guy ""Jingle"", came in and from then others arrived, so the shelter which holds twelve people is almost full.
In the Smokies, thru-hikers have to stay in the shelters unless they are full - then you can tent or hammock. This is not a popular rule with most people because of the problem they have with norovirus which seems to spread at the shelters. Most people would prefer to stay in their own tents. But it is the rule. So we are all in here tonight. One thing kind of neat about this shelter is that it is made of stone and has a fireplace which one of the young people has going.
It is supposed to get pretty cold tonight, probably under 20*, so it may snow some more.","Fontana Crossing

The shelters in the Smokies all have had tarps across the fronts so far, so it was not too bad inside.I got up as soon as it got light and made breakfast. After getting packed up, I was hiking by 8:10AM. There does not seem to be much water in this section of the trail, so you have to pay attention to how much you have a little more closely. The temperatures are cool now, so that helps but I would hate to be thru-hiking in warm weather as you would have to carry a decent quantity of water in some stretches.The goal today was another 12 miles to the Derrick Knob shelter. There were no long climbs today, but it just went up and down constantly. About a couple hours into the morning, I crossed paths with Eddie from Knoxville, TN - who was hiking for the day and handing out small oranges and apples. It was great to get some fresh fruit. The highlight of the day was coming up a mountain called Rocky Top. As you get to the top the trees become smaller and give way to grasses facing the southwest. From here you get a great view of the mountains in that direction. At the top of Rocky Top there were two couples. One couple was day hiking and the other younger couple were from Michigan and had a three day permit to backpack and camp. They all had questions on the AT and about thru-hiking, so it was nice to chat with them.These past couple of days it has been nice to run into some people because there have been fewer thru-hikers passing by. I am sure this is temporary and the numbers will pick up as the early April starters come through.The cell reception on this part of the trail is not very good, but I did get a text from Finnegan that he was staying one more night at Fontana Lodge. But he did say that he was feeling better, so I was happy to hear that. Hopefully he will be able to start again tomorrow.I got to the shelter about 4:00PM and this time there were a few of the people there, that stayed at Mollies Ridge last night. There was also the ridge runner (they are employed by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to monitor sections of the trail) and her name was Chloe. She checked our permits and is staying in the shelter with us tonight.It was sunny but cold all day, I don't think the temperature got out of the low 40's.It is kind of hard writing a journal entry in a shelter because of all the distractions. It is 7:30PM as I write this and the guy next to me is sound asleep and snoring, while there are a couple of guys who just came in about an hour ago and they are cooking and trying to set up their sleeping arrangements in the spaces left in the shelter.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

I will save that for the morning.Before I tell about the day I have to review the goings on in the shelter last night. To ""cut to the chase"" there was one guy who was a ""snoring machine"". If that is not his trail name, it should be! He was cranked up for at least 4 hours before something changed and it was quiet. Maybe the machine ran out of fuel. Well that lasted for about an hour then all of a sudden he began thrashing around in his sleeping bag like he was wrestling an alligator. I thought to myself - this can't go on long. Well shows you what I know - it lasted probably 45 minutes. He finally got the best of whatever he was fighting with and it got quiet for a couple of hours. Then he must of refueled and the ""snoring machine"" started again for about 30 minutes so he must be low on fuel.This is a classic case why people hate staying in the shelters along with other reasons. The good news is that he is headed into town tonight, so we will get a night off unless he has a compadre he has planted for us to enjoy.Now back to the day. It was clear and sunny but cold as I started out, but the trail was fairly tame and combined with the short mileage day, it was kind of a relaxing day - if that makes sense.There was a portion of the trail called the Narrows where the actual path was about 2' wide with a steep drop off on one side and steep uphill on the other. On this section there was a small space where there was a nice view, so I snapped a picture. Also as I approached the Double Spring shelter (where I will call home tonight) I passed a snowman someone had built in the past few days. Unfortunately it's head was missing probably due to the winds. But I did get a picture that I will try to post.Tomorrow will be a long day as the next shelter is not that far away and is .5 miles off the trail.

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527532,"Well first an update on the shelter last night. There was no one snoring, so everyone got a good nights sleep.My goal today was to get to Icewater Spring shelter which was 13+ miles from where I was starting. I got up before it was light, got some oatmeal and coffee ready and packed up once people in the shelter started stirring.I was hiking by 7:40AM and it started ""up"" right away. One thing I forgot to mention yesterday was that there were many sections that were muddy because the snow that fell the other day had melted. But starting out today it was ice instead of mud since the elevation was that much higher. It made for some dicey hiking in the morning. The first stop was Clingman's Dome, which is the highest point on the entire Appalachian Trail. There is an observation tower on the top and people can drive within a half mile of the top and walk up a paved path. The hardwood trees that dominate lower elevations gave way to Spruce and Fir stands. As you approach the top you can see the tower from a ways back. I think I was a little excited as I hiked right past a junction and sign indicating a slight fork in the trail and soon found I was losing altitude. I used the Guthook AT app on my phone to get my GPS position and saw something was wrong. Luckily I had not gone too far and turned around without losing too much time.Anyway I got back on the trail and found my way to the spur that went to the tower. It was fairly clear and the wind was whipping up on the observation deck. I took a quick video of what it looked like and will try to get that posted on the journal site when I get a good WiFi connection next time I am in town.The day was warmer than yesterday, and once over Clingman's - the trail just meandered for several miles of rolling and short downhill sections. Going down on the icy sections was a slow process. There was a section on the trail where there is a native Beech tree stand. Apparently the wild hogs that are found here in the Smokies, damage the trees so they have a section fenced off and it includes a metal grate that allows hikers to get over the fence. I posted a picture of what one looked like.The next notable point was Newfound Gap which is where you cross a highway and there is a large parking lot where people come to day-hike and just take pictures of the mountains. The lot was pretty full and there were people all over.I took a quick break, then headed out for the last three miles so I could get to Icewater shelter for the night. There were quite a few day-hikers coming down, that included a number that were my age or older. I finally pulled into the shelter about 5:00PM, which is the latest I have finished so far on the hike. The shelter was full so I setup my hammock, cooked some dinner and hopped in by 7:30PM. As I type this, the wind is blowing pretty good and it is one of the things I don't really care for, camping up as high as the shelters are located here in the Smokies. It was also true in general early in the hike, so you think I would get used to it, but not so far.One more note, I passed 200 miles hiking so far. While that seems like a lot, it really is nothing compared to the entire length of the AT. But one day at a time.","Double Spring Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527768,"It rained during the night but the wind died down, so that was good. When I got up it was still drizzling off and on but I just left my tarp up , ate and packed up underneath that.My goal was to get to Tri-Corner Knob shelter which was about 12 miles up the trail. The shelter last night was full since it was only 3 miles in from Newfound Gap, where a lot of hikers jump off the trail and go into Gatlinburg, TN to stay or resupply. So this is the first place they can get to once they get back on the trail.Since the clouds were down over the tops of the mountains, any chance of seeing something was nil. Actually the trail goes by a rock outcropping called Charlie's Bunion which there is supposed to be a good view from, but not today.It continued to drizzle off/on all morning, but the trail was not as messy as I expected. Just like in the Adirondacks, in places the trail was like a stream, and you just plod through the water.Shortly after Noon I stopped for lunch, but that did not last very long because once you stopped, you immediately started to get cold since you get pretty clammy under your rain gear hiking.I only saw 4 people all day and they were staying at the shelter I did last night. One young guy I met - ""No Worries"" from Bangor, ME last night, while getting water, - came flying by me about 2:30PM on his way to the Tri-Corner shelter. We talked for a minute and he told me that he left at 11:00AM. I had started at 8:30AM, from the same place - so that shows the capability of some of these younger guys.Just after No Worries passed me, the sun started to peek through and the sky cleared. It was nice that it stopped raining, but it was too late to get much of anything dried out. Maybe tomorrow!When I got to Tri-Corner Knob shelter, it was like a small city. The shelter was full and many tents were already up. So I got to use my hammock again tonight, which is good so maybe the fly will dry out a little. The shelters are once again being real crowded like at the beginning in Georgia. Hopefully that will change again once this bubble of hikers pass on.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527783,"Well the sun came up this morning as everyone got up, packed and left. Quite a difference from yesterday.I was one of the later departures at a few minutes after 9:00AM. I was waffling between going to the next shelter or shooting for Davenport Gap shelter which is the last one in the Smokies and actually only .9 miles from our exit from the park.A few minutes into hiking I stopped to see if I could get a cell signal to send out an email. As I was doing this a young guy named Ben (Two Packs) came by and did the same to let his Mom know he was ok. We both left together and ended up hiking together for a little over six miles. It was nice chatting and made the miles fly by. We were fairly close to the first shelter and an uphill came, so he moved ahead. But as it ended up, I got to the first shelter at 1:00PM, which I felt was too early to stop. Davenport Gap was only 7 miles further, so I decided to push on. The decision was also helped by looking at the elevation profile and seeing it dropped almost 2000'.The weather today was gorgeous for hiking - sunny and just warm enough without being too hot.I am at the Davenport shelter and there was space when I got here so I am in it for the night. Others have straggled in and are camping outside. As I write this they continue in. Tomorrow morning I will officially leave the Smokies. While the trail has been in good shape, the views have been beautiful and the weather has not been bad, I have to say I am glad to get this section over. The requirement for thru-hikers to stay in the shelters (if there is room), the spacing of the shelters and the small number of water sources takes away some of the enjoyment of hiking in this National Park.I am hopefully going to be able to stay at a hostel that is nearby tomorrow night and then head out on Saturday for Hot Springs where I intend to take a full day off.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527937,"This morning was one of my favorite so far. I got up just as it was getting light and while I made breakfast in front on the shelter (which faced east) the sky turned red and the sun come up over the far mountain. On top of that it was going to be a short day because I was only going 3.6 miles to Standing Bear Farm hostel for the night.As I arrived down at the place where the AT goes under Interstate 40, there was a group of 4 people about my age setting up to cook hamburgers and hot dogs. I was the first person to get there and they asked if it was too early for burgers and dogs? I said no way, and I would love one - so they did one of each for me. I told them that any thru-hiker who said it was too early needed their head checked). Soon after Chicken Feet came in ( we have been around one-another the past couple of days). 
We had a nice talk with them and went on our way when the next group came down off the hill.
I got to the hostel a little after 10:00AM and got a bunk for the night. I took a shower which felt awesome after not being able to for almost a week.
I was going to do laundry but it is by hand scrub board (and they do have a dryer) but I don't want to work that hard. I carry a spare set of basic clothes so I will just swap out for clean ones and do all of the laundry in Hot Springs. 
So I have just done the usual pack reshuffle and discovered what few food items I can pick up here and just relaxed talking with a few of the hikers who are staying here.
They have a small pizza oven and frozen pizzas, so that sounds good for dinner. 
Up early tomorrow and back at it, to start working my way to Hot Springs.","Davenport Gap Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527939,"AT - 30 days inNow that I have been at this for 30 days, it may be interesting later for me to look back and see what I thought of the hike up to this point.Physically this has been what I basically expected. It has taken me these few weeks to get adjusted to the constant up/down nature of the trail, which is well maintained for a hiking trail. My legs are getting in better shape, I have adjusted well I think to my pack even when it has been re-supplied. Although I have to take a few breaks on the steeper climbs still, I am able to consistently move up the switchbacks without stopping now (which was not the case at the start). Just like anyone out here my knees are sore sometimes, but not a big deal. Overall physically this hike is starting well.They say that the majority of this hike is mental . I am finding that to be the case for sure. When I spent the last three years reading journals like this of other older hikers, many mentioned how much they miss their family. I would say to myself ""no kidding I would miss mine too if I was hiking"". Well now I understand they were writing down what I am experiencing at this point. At this time, that is by far my biggest challenge. I cannot imagine having done this many years ago when the cell phone did not exist and you went days upon days without communication with loved ones. Also there is the fact that at the pace you are moving, the scenery does not change all that much. This must be my version of the ""Virginia Blues"" only before Virginia. I am coming to what is probably my first major bald in the next few days, so I am looking forward to that.Overall I enjoy the hiking during the day. It is a good mix of hiking alone and then crossing paths with other hikers throughout the day. The camping on the other hand is fairly congested. It will be good to see things thin out eventually (hoping anyway). I committed to this hike simply because I love to hike, enjoy the simplicity of moving from point to point under my own power and have always liked physical challenges. I did the homework and necessary preparation. However would not say I came out here with a thru-hiker fever some seem to possess right from the start (although my wife would probably beg to differ). I am sure I am still adjusting to the pace and tempo, while trying to get my mind around the fact as to how long this actually is. It is still too early in the hike to make any kind of serious assessment. What makes me satisfied at this point is that I am moving north - slowly but surely.I will try to do this again in 3 weeks or so to see how my thoughts are at that point.Jess - did I do ok?? :-)","Standing Bear Farm hostel

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528069,"Standing Bear Farm hostel is an interesting place. It has the normal bunkhouse most hostels have, but it has a cabin for 6 built over a creek, a tree house and a community kitchen in another building. It has a small resupply store that includes food that you can make in the community kitchen. There are not only hikers running around but also dogs, cats and a rooster. Last night all of a sudden the rooster decided to start crowing. Now I never lived on a farm, but was under the assumption that they did that as day was breaking. I was in shock that we had slept so long, so I looked at my watch - it was 12:40AM! Luckily it only went on a few minutes, then he must have checked his watch and headed back to bed. As expected he started in again, but this time after 6:00AM, which was more respectable.Once I got packed up and settled my bill at Standing Bear, I was hiking by 9:00AM. The goal was modest today (Groundhog Creek shelter) because I need to time my arrival at Hot Springs to coincide with a couple of mail drops that are being sent. Also there was a steady climb (seems like I say that a lot) up out of the Davenport Gap area. Switchbacks made it easier. After a few hours of climbing the trail topped out at a small bald called Snowbird Mountain. On top is an FAA tower of some sort, which looks out of place in the mountains.I took a short break after that once I was back in the woods and out of the wind, and then headed to the shelter. When I arrived there was no one here, but the water source is good, so I setup the hammock and am relaxing.In the meantime a couple about my age from Utah and a guy from Boston arrived and are camping here for the night.Several others have also filed in but it is not crowded.Plan right now is up early tomorrow, get hiking in order to cover around 13 miles or so, which will include a hike over Max Patch - a notable bald on the trail. It is said to have a 360* view of the surroundings, so hopefully it will be clear.","

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528260,"I wanted to get to the Walnut Mountain shelter by the end of the day and also wanted to be able to spend some time on Max Patch Bald if the weather was going to be nice. So I got up before it was light out and packed up by headlamp. As it started to get light I made some breakfast and was hiking by 7:50AM. Not a stellar departure time, but good enough. It was sunny once again and the six miles to Max Patch went by pretty fast.   I arrived on the top of the bald right about 11:00AM. There were a few thru-hikers up there but there were a good number of day hikers. It was Saturday, the weather was beautiful and you can drive fairly close to the base of the mountain.I mentioned the people who were at the shelter last night and we all were sitting together enjoying the view, eating lunch and just relaxing. I learned everyone's name. The couple from Utah was Julie and Lou. Steven was the guy from Boston and a fourth guy Ron is from Williamsburg VA. As we sat there, a couple came up and asked if we were thru-hiking and we said yes. Their son did so in 2014, and so whenever they think they will run into someone attempting to hike the entire AT, they carry some kind of goodies. Today it was donuts and we all happily accepted one.I actually sat on Max Patch until 12:30PM. This is by far the longest break I have taken so far but it was so nice, without too much of a breeze, I did not want to move.I did take a short video of the view and will post if I ever get a decent WiFi connection. Also Julie took a picture of me, but my hat kind of messed it up so I will just use a picture I took facing North from the Bald.Eventually we all left and immediately due to everyone's different paces we were all separated. It was 6+ miles to the Walnut shelter, with a steep 1.3 mile climb right at the end.When I got to the shelter, Steven was sitting there and had just returned from getting water from the spring below. Julie and Lou came in right after me, then Ron finally showed up. We could not figure out how he got behind us, but he said that he made a wrong turn leaving Max Patch (it was kind of confusing with all the trails they have in there, really).Steven, Julie and Lou moved on to a camp site about 2 miles further up the trail. Ron and I are camped at Walnut Mountain shelter for the night.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528446,"Well last night the wind was crazy and we were on a ridge. Bottom line not much sleep. I checked with Ron and he said the same thing. We got packed up and went down to the shelter picnic table and made some breakfast. Last night after we had hung our food on the bear cables and retired a young girl came into the shelter. So when Ron and I went to make breakfast, she got up and joined us. Her trail name is ""Sway"" and she started just north of Damascus VA, and was hiking south to Springer Mountain. Once there she will return to VA where she started and then head north. She is doing this to avoid the crowds.Ron and I headed out a little before 9:00AM, and immediately got separated due to his faster hiking pace. It was sunny and the temperatures were a little on the hot side for the second day in a row. Consequently hiking in the morning is great but it becomes more challenging as the day wears on. Hopefully we will get acclimated to this as time goes on.Ron takes a break about every two hours, so each time he did, I caught up and did the same. After the second break we were just a bit over 3 miles from Hot Springs. So we headed out with the Laughing Heart Lodge as our destination. I had called early in the morning to make sure they had rooms available.Right around 3:00PM we came off the trail and by luck it dumps right into the Laughing Heart property. We checked in and grabbed a quick shower, then walked into town - about 10 minutes away. Ron had to replace his sleeping pad at the outfitters, then we headed to a restaurant for an early dinner.So this evening we are settled in at the Lodge. They provide breakfast, then Ron has a couple of errands to run and he will head out tomorrow.   I will stay a couple of more days to wait for two mail drops. This is not what I planned, but it is my fault due to poor estimation on my arrival in Hot Springs. I need to improve on estimating my progress, so I am only taking an entire day off once in a while.But this place is really nice and offers hikers a good discount, so I am not complaining.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Woke up and went down to have some coffee, before breakfast which was at 8:30AM on the dot!Ron ate breakfast with me, then packed up and hiked out. He said he may take a few days off in Erwin, TN which is approximately 5 days north. So I may overlap him then, but you never know out here.I was waiting to see where the two mail drops that I was expecting were. Expecting them most likely tomorrow, I found out that both had arrived at the Hot Springs PO just before Noon. The USPS comes through!!! But like a lot of these smaller towns the post office was closed 11:30AM-1:00PM.So I grabbed lunch at the Smoky Mountain Diner and then walked into town to grab the packages. There was some local excitement this morning as the day started crystal clear, then all of a sudden there was a smog having over the town. It turns out there is a forest fire at the state lines of NC and TN, which caused the haze. At this time (late afternoon) I believe it is still burning, but the haze is gone. The picture I will post one of the views from the lodge porch and you probably would not have seen the hills I the distance very well this morning.After grabbing my stuff from the PO, I headed back to the hostel to pack the food sent from home and to replace my two hammock quilts. I am swapping out 0* stuff for 20* which should suffice going forward for a while. The top quilt I got was made by my son Jared, so I am looking forward even more to using it. If you are interested in seeing his quilts, check out Mid Atlantic Mountain Works. There is a shameless plug from a proud Dad. I think his stuff is pretty darn good.Well that took longer than I expected, so I would have missed the PO, getting the quilts I am replacing mailed back home. So it is good I have tomorrow to get back down there and mail out the box to the Hike Administrator (my wife).It is funny how you look forward to a break from hiking, but then you get kind of ""antsy"" about getting back out there, as you realize you are not moving forward. Hopefully as I said, I will get more precise in my estimating my progress. Hot Springs is a nice place though if you have to be stuck!A non hiking note of a technical nature. I started this hike with Smartwool tee-shirts. They seem to not get smelling bad quite as fast as synthetic materials. However with the hot weather, I have developed a rash on my back where my pack sits. I am wondering if it has something to do with the wool shirts as this is the longest I have ever worn them exclusively. Never had it happen with synthetic ones. Ok, kind of a weird topic, but I now have a synthetic shirt I will try out the next week or so. I will report back - and I know you all are going to be on the edge of you chairs waiting.","Hot Springs NC

Which was cool, but I knew it would not last long because when you drop down into town - you climb out!Today was kind of warm but overcast in the morning. The sun came out around Noon. The goal today was to get to Spring Mountain shelter.Just about the time I was thinking of stopping for lunch, I ran into a couple from Charlotte NC, that were day hiking. They asked me if I was thru-hiking and I said that I was attempting to. They asked a bunch of questions and were so sincere in their interest, I stood there about 15 minutes answering them. Ultimately they were trying to get to a lookout tower but were not sure where it was. So I looked at my trail guide and told them how to get there and how far it was.They went on, and I stopped for lunch. There is some kind of little black bug out, and they fly around your face - so lunch was a short affair. No sooner had I started up and here comes the couple back down the trail. It was awfully quick, so I told them they set some kind of record getting there and back. Well it turned out they felt they did not have enough time, so turned around.However they had a bunch more questions about things like food and how we get drinking water. Again they seemed so sincerely interested, I would have felt bad not talking with them.The rest of the day was not too bad - just a lot of uphill after leaving Hot Springs. I got to the shelter about 4:00PM and there were a few people there but they were hiking on for another hour or so after grabbing some water. But then the normal crowd started to show up, so we have a good number here for the nightThere is a guy named ""Right Lane"" from Massachusetts here tonight and we were talking for a while after dinner. He is around my age and a school teacher that is hiking while taking a leave of absence.Water up here is kind of scarce, so you almost have to stop at the shelters at least to get water. Which kind of sets up a dilemma for tomorrow - you can go 9 miles to the next shelter, or if you want to reach the second one - that will be a 16 mile day.

It would be a 15.4 mile day which was the furthest I have done on this hike so far. As I was leaving, I was totally amazed that after I went to bed last night there must have been at least 10 more hikers that arrived late and almost every piece of flat ground had a tent on it. Tents were less than 3 feet apart and it was like an obstacle course trying to get to my food bag on the bear cables.The morning was cloudy and cool. In fact that was just about how the whole day was with the exception of the sun being out full bore around Noon for about an hour.There were more hikers on the trail today than there have been for a while. Seems like a bunch of people all left Hot Springs the same day. And they seem to be in a hurry to get to Erwin - the next town the trail goes near.I was hiking when all of a sudden I hear a booming voice behind me asking ""what is your name brother?"". It was a middle aged guy named Jeff. He thru-hiked this thing in 2012, and was at it again. I asked if he had a trail name since he hiked before and he said no - that his mother gave him a name and he did not want a trail name!! He said the best thing for him was meeting people, so we hiked together for about a mile. He told me how he does it and how little stuff he carries. Quite an interesting character. I took a break eventually and Jeff hiked on. Once I started back up again I crossed a road at Allen Gap. After I crossed the road and started up the hill, there was a cooler full of small bottles of Poweraid. It was left their by a church group. That hit the spot!Just about a mile before I stopped for lunch I ran into these two brothers who were hiking south. The one guy was actually hiking north, but his younger brother came to meet him so they were headed south at that time. The older guy introduced himself as ""Lil' cup"" which was his trail name the younger brother was Denny. Now since there is an epidemic of sorts with this norovirus, it is recommended that you don't shake hands. A fist bump was suggested. But that has kind of been replaced for the older guys with an elbow bump. ""Lil cup"" was a huge fan of the elbow bump, to the point that he would say something and just bump the air automatically to emphasize what he said. I had all I could do to keep from laughing. But they were nice guys. I said goodbye and moved on.Lunch was uneventful, and then I started to the final destination which was 6+ miles away. The first thing was a long hill, then it kind of rolled for awhile. But the grand finale was about two miles on this exposed ridge that was almost all rocks. It is so exposed that there is a side trail they suggest you take if the weather is bad... it was not, so everyone was up on the ridge. That was a tough two miles and coming at the end of a long day did not help.Eventually I got to the shelter I was shooting for and just before I got there, I crossed the 300 mile mark.

Not sure what time it started raining but it went on/off all night. It continued in the morning which meant breaking camp in the rain, which necessitates changing my order of doing things to keep the tarp up until the last possible minute. No complaints though, the weather has been good almost this entire hike so far and these woods definitely need the rain.Overall the day was cloudy and the rain let up right after I broke camp. That lasted until about 11:15AM, as I was getting to the next shelter which was about 6 miles further up the trail from Jerry Cabin shelter.I needed water so I stopped and there were a few young guys waiting to see if the rain was going to stop. I just got my water and plugged on, as the next place I wanted to get to was still almost 9 miles ahead. It sprinkled on and off all afternoon, so I left my rain jacket on even though it was just as wet inside from perspiration as it was outside from the rain. It did keep any wind off me and I was warm as long as I was moving.With the rain the streams are now carrying noticeably more water, which is a good thing. The trail crosses NC 212 at a place called Devils Fork Gap, which in AT terms means you are climbing back up to get on the mountains after the gap. Anyway going up from the gap there was a sizable stream that had several waterfalls as you continue to climb.Once on top, it was a good deal of rolling trail the rest of the way to Hogback Ridge shelter. Once I got there I did not spend my usual time looking for a good set of trees to hang my hammock. It looked like it was going to rain again, so I quick hung my tarp and got everything under it. I did get all set up and was about to go get water to make dinner (it was .2 miles from the shelter) when it let loose. I was not in the mood to walk that far in the rain after being in it all day, so I just checked my bottles and had almost 1 liter left - so that was enough to get by for dinner. I hope it isn't raining in the morning so I can grab some for breakfast. Otherwise it looks like it is about 3 miles to the next stream, so I may wait to get there, then sit and make some oatmeal and coffee.

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529468,"A short day (at least mileage wise that seems like it) for a couple of reasons. I am experiencing my first minor physical issues of the hike. First of all my right knee seems to not be recovering from the hiking each day right now. My normal routine at the end of the day is to hop in the hammock, and type in my journal. Next I answer ""nature's call"" before going to sleep. Last night I went to get out of the hammock and my knee was like it was frozen stiff in a straight position. It took some coaxing to get it to bend so I could get out of the hammock. Also the ball of my right foot is really sore. I am hoping it is just kind of bruised and nothing else. My thinking is that maybe the back-to-back 15 mile days may have been too much in the terrain we are in. I got up slowly this morning and took a couple of aspirin with breakfast. I started hiking without any major problems but stepping up/pushing off with my right leg is tenuous. I will take the next couple of days easier and then hope to get a half day off in Erwin at a hostel. Will see how the knee and foot respond to less mileage. The second reason I wanted to stop early was to try and dry out my stuff. It was supposed to clear off and hopefully there would be enough sun to dry things.The weather today was cloudy and kind of cold with a wind whipping up on the ridges. My first stop after starting was Sam's Gap where there were supposed to be some trash cans. One thing for sure, you are always looking to get rid of trash when you can. Well the trash cans at the parking lot were gone, but a lady dropping off 3 hikers offered to take mine. Now there is a true Samaritan.The hiking today included 1200' in elevation change to top out at 5500'+. So that was one of the larger elevation gains we have had lately I believe.When I was eating lunch a day hiker came by with his dog. We chatted and it turns out he used to live in Oneonta NY. He was telling me about a friend of his who was hiking the AT and around 300 miles started having knee problems (he got my attention) - anyway she just kept plowing on for 1,100 more miles and finally had to quit. Apparently she has done long term damage to her knees. Well this ""Pony Boy"" (a name given to me by my good friend Tom C.) will not make a mistake like that for sure! Nothing is worth hobbling yourself permanently.The highlight of the day was towards the end when we crossed a section called Big Stamp - a treeless grassland that was totally enveloped in the clouds.As I arrived at Bald Mountain shelter - Right Lane was already there. He and I have camped at the same spots the past two nights. But he decided to push on and will try to get to Erwin by the end of tomorrow.

Not sure if it was the short day yesterday or combination of short day and being able to get off my feet by mid-afternoon - but overall I felt better.I was not in any hurry to get up today knowing that I would only be covering another 10 miles or so. The sun came up and I just sat and made breakfast and enjoyed it as it rose above the mountains in the east.I have to say I was quite excited about something as I got dressed this morning. I have a line tied along the ridge of my hammock tarp where I hang my socks and a few other things. They are usually damp and need airing out. Needless to say they almost are never dry - but somehow last night whatever mild breeze was kicking around - all my stuff was totally dry!! Only if you are backpacking is something so mundane exciting.The hiking today was pretty tame and the only factor was the sun and temperature by mid-day. Since the leaves are still not out, it can get kind of intense where there is no breeze. However it is not raining, so it is fine by me.The base goal for today was No Business Knob shelter (who names these things?). Since there is very limited water here they suggest you stop before the shelter at one of the streams and carry it with you - which I did. I had the notion that I may try and go a little further, but decided against it to stick with two medium distance days and let my body recuperate some more.Tomorrow it is a little less than 7 miles to the Nolichucky River outside of Erwin TN. I am going to try and get a shuttle into town where I can get some chores done and pick up a package at the Post Office. Hopefully I will stay the night and get out the next morning.Not much else to report other than the crowds at the shelters have been smaller - but I am sure there will be some other waves of hikers coming, that started some time in April.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529860,"I got up before it got light and packed up. As I was finishing up it was light enough to start hiking. I wanted to get into Erwin TN today to pick up a new rain coat that was at the post office. I also was going to need to get to a grocery store to pick up some food.The sun came up over the mountains as I was hiking. It was a fairly quick 6 miles down to Nolichucky River where the trail comes to the south side of Erwin near Uncle Johnnies hostel. The post office was in the north side of town, so I called a shuttle service to get over there which was a few miles away. Since I had to run to the post office and grocery store I decided to stay the night and get everything done without trying to get back to the trail and hike a few miles late in the day.I am staying at a Super 8 and almost the entire first floor is all hikers. They have a laundry room here so I was able to get my clothes cleaned. That room was pretty popular all day.As usual my pack was exploded all over the room and I spent some time putting it back together, repacking my food bag and fretting about how much it will weigh with all the new food.Hopefully I will be able to get the shuttle back over to the trail in the morning and be on my way. I have not spent any time looking ahead much, so I am not sure what the next stop will be. That will be my homework tomorrow night.","No Business Knob Shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529959,"This hike has hit a little snag. Back a few days ago I had mentioned a couple of issues with my right foot and knee. Hiking down into Erwin yesterday morning it seemed my right foot was a little worse, but I was not too concerned thinking I would have an opportunity to rest it in the afternoon (which I did).This morning I got up to finish packing to get ready and head back out. When I planted the right foot on the floor, it took several minutes to be able to put weight on it to walk around. Thinking that maybe it would just need to warm up I moved around getting stuff together. It was readily apparent that there was something more serious going on. So I decided that I would stay one more night and try to get to the local medical facility to have it looked at. The short story is that they did x-rays and nothing is broken but there was a bone anomaly in my right foot exactly where the issue started. The rest of the issue (including my knee) is a result of my altering my hiking gait based on that initial problem. I was told that I need to take some time off and see if the inflammation goes down. If not the doctor said that would indicate that it may be a stress fracture. However only a MRI would be able to see a small one. I am not going to have that done right away. Since I have two son's in Washington DC and it is half way between here and Erwin, I am going to go to my oldest son's house in DC to rest my foot for several days and see if it does start to get better. He offered to drive down and pick me up (because driving myself, would require use of my right foot). I am very fortunate he is able to do this and really appreciate his offer.So this hike is on hold for a time. The last thing I want, is to do some kind of damage that does not heal correctly.","Erwin TN

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530612,"My oldest son Jared arrived in Erwin on Tuesday evening (4/26) around 8:00PM and it was great to see his smiling, but tired face, at my hotel room door. I had done nothing but sit around the hotel room all day, staying off my foot as advised by the doctor. We left Erwin on Wednesday morning (4/27) bound for his house in Washington DC. It took about 6+ hours to get back and we arrived about 2:30PM Wednesday afternoon.I let the Administrator know we had reached DC and it was decided that she would travel from Syracuse to the following day (Thursday 4/28) to meet me. The plan was for us to stay with Jared and Paula (my daughter-in-law) until Sunday and see how things had progressed in regards to my foot.So until my wife arrived in DC, I was to just sit and rest, which I did. She arrived on Thursday right around Noon, after leaving Syracuse around 5:30AM. Needless to say I was overjoyed to see her smiling face as she got out of the car!Based on what the doctor said in the ER in Erwin, all I had done since Tuesday morning was to stay off my foot, take some anti-inflammatory relief and ice it when possible. He felt that if the foot was just inflamed that in 3-4 days it should start showing improvement. I got up Friday morning (4/29) which was day 3 of this resting period and if nothing else the foot was not any better and may actually have gotten a little worse. After a quick discussion with my wife and contacting our family physician, it was decided that I should probably get back to Syracuse and try to get this looked at further. I am not able to move on flat surfaces very well or negotiate stairs very well, so thinking that this is going to be in hiking shape in the next few days is a “pipe dream”.So here it is Saturday morning (4/30)and I am back home, which was probably the correct decision. Most of our house is on one floor, so going up and down stairs is minimized. I also have an appointment on Monday with our family physician to let him take a look at my foot and discuss what he recommends should be the next step.",,"Syracuse, NY","Apr 30, Sat",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531309,"Well I was able to get in to see our family doctor on Monday (5/2). He had already taken a look at the information sent from the ER in Erwin and we discussed what had transpired while I was hiking in regards to my foot. There is even a name for what is wrong with my foot - ""Freiberg's infraction"". The bottom-line is that there was agreement in what I was told in Erwin and that since the swelling was starting to go down finally, the advice was to take it easy at least 2-3 weeks and make sure the foot is healing. No hiking, excessive walking or running in that time frame. He did say that I could ride my bike, which since the weather is starting to get better, I will do. Once I am sure my foot is healing, I will start with some walking, then some long walks and if nothing seems to be wrong, some day hikes. It does not make sense to me, to try and test this by simply going back to the trail, putting on a 30+ pack and seeing if the problem is going to recur.What this means is that completing a thru-hike in 2016 is not in the cards for me. I will have lost at least a month's time by the time I am ready to actually try and backpack again. Going to Erwin and picking up where I left off, I feel, would put me in the position of having to most likely hike more miles than I am capable of on a daily basis, just to make sure I would get North in time to finish. There is always the possibility of doing some kind of flip-flop or other permutation of that, however even though that probably would have been the better approach from the beginning, due to the amount of people that ended up starting this year, it really never appealed to me. Call me a hiking Northeast bigot or whatever, but to me the best part of the trail is in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. It only made sense to me that if you hike the entire trail, the best part should be at the end. Again this is only my opinion, I am sure there are many other points of view.In addition, when you are hiking by yourself “day-in and day-out”, you have a vast amount of time to mull things over in your mind. My oldest son said to me - “even at 63 years old, you probably find out stuff about yourself you never knew” and although there were no earth shattering revelations for me, it still was true.The first thing I realized shortly after starting was how “stifling” the thought of a thru-hike actually was. This should not have been any surprise to me, as I had good advice from a number of people to take the effort as if it were a series of short hikes. This is how I approached it and that seemed to work. However, listening to people talk of the Whites, and Maine while we were still in Georgia, kind of mystified me.Being asked by almost everyone you encountered - “are you thru-hiking?' - and answering “attempting”, started an internal conversation in my head. After asking and answering myself, repeatedly, over the course of several days, I came to a conclusion. I started this hike simply because I enjoy the act of backpacking, the fact that I picked the Appalachian Trail was because it gave me the opportunity to almost hike endlessly. I had never before, attempted to hike more than a few weeks and although there is a termination point, it was so far out, that it would allow me to just move forward with what seemed like forever. I naively just answered people that I was thru-hiking, because that is what you do if you have nothing else to base your answer on – right? So after much mulling this over-and over, I came to the conclusion that I was just hiking North and I would “get as far as I would get”. The determining factors would be, either I would get injured somehow (which happened to many people), I would get tired of hiking and realize that it was enough, or the trail would end.I also realized how much having someone to share a “hiking experience” with meant to me. You do have people around you at night and for fleeting moments during the day, but it is not the same as having someone with you as you hike, stop and eat and setup/breakdown each day. I have been fortunate that my entire family enjoys the outdoors and one or more of them have been with me most of the times. I also have good friends that come along on occasion. In the end it is much more enjoyable to me to have the company.Before I actually had to stop, I had come to the conclusion that it did not matter to me if I actually completed a thru-hike or not. It was going to conclude as I described above. I just wanted to hike until one of the three options stopped me.At this point, I most likely will try to get some section hiking in, which will allow me to pick portions of the trail that are not as crowded and the weather will be more conducive to hiking. I do not regret starting this hike, as it has provided clarity for me personally, as to what is important.I would like to thank everyone for their kind words sent via the journal or email. I can honestly say these made a difference to me as I was hiking.Good luck to those who continue to move forward in 2016.",,"Syracuse, NY","May 04, Wed",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556683,"After having to leave the trail in April of 2016 with a foot injury, I am going to go back to where I left off in Erwin TN and do a section hike to see how my foot handles the stress. It took over 2 month’s once I had stopped hiking last year, to be able to walk normally again. I did a good deal of biking and canoeing during the summer, but have only done a handful of day hikes since leaving the AT. Several of those hikes were all day affairs in the Adirondacks and my foot seemed to handle all of them without any problems afterward. I realize that it was not done with a full backpack, but then again I am not known for ultra-light packing when on a day hike.I started a journal during my thru-hike attempt so that my family and friends could follow my progress and so I would have some record of my hike. I found that over the last year, I have read many of the entries and it was great having them available to remember the places and people. So I plan to continue the journal primarily for that reason, but also so my wife can plan on when I will be back home again.Doing this section hike will not only give me a chance to test my foot again, but also to see how it is to just hike a section of the trail. The preparation for leaving, for a defined time, with a limited goal has been much easier than the prep for a thru-hike. At least that is how I feel right now.Overall I was very happy with most of the gear I hiked with last year, so that has streamlined a good deal of the planning and decisions. The one aspect of a thru-hike that I did not enjoy was planning and coordinating food re-supplies. Hiking just a section will allow me to just get all this together at one time, and just worry about picking up packages that will already be mailed.I will go to Damascus, get a shuttle to Erwin and hike back to Damascus. At least that is the plan.",,"Syracuse, NY","Mar 17, Fri",0

It was short, but we had a good time and got to catch the two basketball games on television Saturday night.Today (Sunday) I drove from DC to Damascus VA, and am staying the night at the Hikers Inn. The weather all the way down was gorgeous and I hope to have a few days like this over the next couple weeks.

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558652,"I had a good sleep at the Hiker Inn. It was dead quiet all night even though all the rooms were taken. I got up, showered and took my duffle bag over to the truck to leave it, for when I get back to Damascus.Then I headed over to Mojo's Cafe for breakfast. I ordered an Everything Bagel sandwich since I figured no one would be offended by garlic breath while I was hiking. However the bagel did not have garlic on it, so the name Everything is not quite true. It was good none the less.Then I headed back to the hostel to pack up and was surprised to hear that my shuttle ride was ahead of schedule. The ride to Erwin was about 1:15 and I was hiking at 10:50AM. It had been cloudy all morning and started to sprinkle as I started, so on went the rain gear.It was great to be back on the trail again for about 45 minutes, then the climbing started! It reminded me that the trail is in control and I am going to have to get in hiking shape again before I expect to move uphill without stopping once in a while. As I was about half way to Curley Maple shelter - two young guys came strolling by. It was raining on/off so rain gear was staying on. When I arrived at the shelter to take a break and grab water, the two guys that passed me were there along with two other young men who said they were from Ohio and hiking for a week. They were staying at the shelter to avoid the predicted rain, the other two packed up and headed out, for the next shelter which was going to make a 22 mile day for them.I got some more water talked some with the Ohio guys, then headed out as it was only early afternoon. It continued to rain off/on and included a couple of heavy down pours. After getting a few more miles in, I decided to stop along the trail since the rain had let up and I could quick get the tarp up to operate under. Actually the sun came out and there is a light breeze so I am trying to dry out some stuff while doing this journal entry. I am about 8 tenths of a mile from Indian Grave Gap and hoping the weather is correct and tomorrow is nice.","Erwin TN

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559198,"After all the rain yesterday, last night was pretty quiet. There were a few sprinkles but the moon and stars were visible most of the time. I slept good and got up just as it was getting light. Because I was short of water, I just downed a power bar and headed out. I was less than a mile from a road crossing and there was a stream there.It was cloudy, but the sun was peeking through. As the morning wore on, the sun popped out to stay.
Overall the hiking was easier today, with only a few tough climbs. I got to hike over a bald today called Beauty Spot which is kind of a weird name but it was nice. I am not sure what the temperature was, but it felt warm especially in areas where there was no breeze. 
I was taking a lunch break right after Noon in the middle of ascending Unaka Mountain (5180) and the young guys from Ohio came along and took a break too. I found out one of them is a pharmacist and has a girl friend from Lowville, NY - which is about an hour north of Syracuse. What a coincidence! 
I ended the day at Cherry Gap Shelter, but there is no cell service here, so I will upload this later. There are about 5 people camping and another 4 or 5 in the shelter.","Stealth campsite

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559477,"So far the numbers of hikers at the shelters have been dramatically less than last year when I started. I guess this would be expected due to the fact that I started in Erwin. It seems like there is a balance of section and thru hikers right now.I met a thru-hiker last night who was camping as well at the shelter. His trail name is ""Many Names"" because people kept giving him new names all the time. Nice guy, originally from Boston but now lives in Florida. I slept well again last night and with plenty of water available, I fired up a bowl of my ""world famous"" oatmeal which was not so ""world famous"". I add a tablespoon of dehydrated milk (along with other stuff) and vacuum sealing them made the milk powder a rock. Not good! Live and learn.
Anyway I was hiking at a little before 8:00AM, so I was happy with that. The weather the next couple of days is supposed to be sketchy, with depending on who you talk to it can be anywhere from thunderstorms to tornadoes. Problem is the cell service is not good in this area, so checking the weather is not possible. So everyone is going on couple day old forecasts, which are not too useful up in the mountains - at least that is what I feel.
Well as I was hiking I came across an elderly gentleman that was sitting on a log. He lives half the year nearby the trail and some days comes up to a fire service road next to the trail and hands out different things and takes your trash. Today he had coffee and Mountain Dew. I had a half cup of coffee and we chatted. I found out he was a surveyor for his working career, which was my first real job out of college too (many moons ago). We talked about using transits and chaining distances and he told me how modernized surveying got towards the end of his career. I wanted to get his picture, but when he hesitated to tell me his name when I asked, I declined, deciding not to push. BTW his name was Lee. Meeting people like this when hiking never gets old and is one of my favorite aspects of doing this.
Well as you can tell from the length of this, I had a lot of time today. With the weather unknown and since it started to rain about 1:00PM, a bunch of people decided to call it an early day and see what happens. I had already hiked 9 miles which is probably ok since I still am testing my foot out. So my hammock was all setup at Clyde Smith shelter and I had my water - nothing to do but relax and type. The rain has let up but there were some good gusts of wind, but by dinner time the sun was poking through.","Cherry Gap shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559708,"Well the predicted storms did not materialize last night. It was pretty windy and there were a couple rumbles of thunder and a small sprinkle just before 11:00PM -then it was quiet. I did not get much sleep before 11 due to the flapping of my tarp but once it settled down, I was out like a light.As I have a few times, I got up, packed up and just ate some of those energy bars so I could get hiking. That never seems to work for me and the day always seems to start out slow. You think I would learn. That maybe ok for me if I am just going a few miles and stopping, but not for a full day hiking. My reason for attempting this once again was to get over Roan Mountain, due to predicted bad weather coming (high winds and snow).
As I was hiking I came across a tent setup next to the trail and it was close to Noon. I wondered if I should yell out and see if there was somebody in there, and if they were all right. But I thought maybe they might be catching up on sleep and would not appreciate it; so I moved on.
As I got higher the wind was getting stronger and the snow was flying. Not much accumulation, but it was sticking. When I finally got to the cutoff trail for the shelter I went up the .1 of a mile to see the shelter and have lunch before moving on. The shelter is an old cabin with a door, but really drafty. Up in the loft the two Ohio guys from the past few days were in their sleeping bags waiting out the storm. Also thru-hiker named Bill came along. I ate quick and took off. I was not sure where I was headed, but off the mountain was a start. Shortly after starting down, Bill came by and said he was headed to a shelter. At that point I felt even the closest one was too far. That would be about a 13+ mile day. I knew there was water at Carver Gap so I shot for that and hoped a camping spot might be there.
Once I got there, the water was present but no good obvious hammock spots. At that point it was about 2:00PM and I decided to try and make it to the next shelter (about 4 more miles).
After crossing the road at Carver Gap, you climb this nice stone pathway that goes to the top of a bald. The wind here was pretty crazy and there was no protection. As I finally crested the top, I hear someone yell to me, it was Many Names who I met on Tuesday. He was headed to Overmountain Shelter which was about 2 miles past the one I was trying to get to. It was then I found out that it was he in the tent I saw along the trail. His heel was bothering him and he was trying to give it a rest.
Once off the bald the wind was not as bad but the melting snow was making a mud pit of the trail.
Eventually I reached the next shelter which had two guys my age in it and some random guy all curled up in a ball in his sleeping bag. It did not look like a good situation with the wind blowing and the front of the shelter wide open. Since Overmountain is an old barn with a loft for sleeping, I figured I would rather hike two more miles and be enclosed.
When I finally arrived it was almost 7:00PM, which meant I had left almost 12 hours ago. The weather was deteriorating fast and the barn was pretty cold and drafty, but it was better than an open shelter. There were three tents setup in the loft and I setup my hammock. Then Many Names and Bill came in, even though they were ahead of me (they took a wrong turn). It was so late and cold, I did not cook but just grabbed something cold from my food and went to bed. The others staying with us were Scarecrow, Lucky Penny, Already Stinky and Stitch. We all went to bed with the wind howling and snow flying through the cracks in the barn siding.","Clyde Smith shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559811,"The wind just blew all last night, but that was ok because we were in the enclosed loft at Overmountain shelter. I got up and immediately went down to look at the damage (how much snow had fallen). To my surprise, there was not much more accumulation than when we went to bed, but it was frozen. I went back up and grabbed my water bottles and headed over the path to where the water source was, about 100 yards away. Since I had not made dinner last night, eating breakfast was a high priority (something warm). Everyone was getting up, eating and packing up around the same time. One by one they left until it was just Bill and I left and he was not in any hurry to get moving.
Any boots or socks left out were frozen and mine were no exception. I had to dig into my sock stash and get my extra pairs out (I wear liners and socks), as I could not get the ones I had been wearing on. I have never had frozen boots, but I did get the experience this morning of trying to get a pair on that the owner was not smart enough to loosen the laces.
As expected the trail was covered with a mix of snow and ice, but it was thin enough to crack under your weight, so footing was not bad. I started about 8:40AM and the trail winds up a hill through small trees and shrubs, so it was protected from the wind. Once out of that, the climb up Little Hump was interesting with the wind still blowing fairly strong. You go over that and of course back down (remember this is the AT). It was then I got the “full monty” of wind in climbing Hump Mountain. Like Little Hump, it is totally exposed, and the path is just a narrow tread cut into the dirt. The guide book talks about several false summits for NoBo hikers, but that was not the issue this morning, it was trying to get your foot planted on the ground before the wind blew it about a foot to the right (wind was coming left side). Having a pack on to make your body even larger just made the whole thing almost comical. Later I heard estimates of wind gusts anywhere from 35 to 70 MPH, but since I have no sense for that all I knew is that walking in it was not easy. It seemed like it took me forever to get to the top and taking any pictures was a “pipe dream”. There is a camp site right at the top and I cannot imagine anyone staying there at any point, as the entire mountain is totally exposed to the elements. The views are spectacular though, one of the best I have seen on my short AT exposure.
When I finally got back into the woods, it was down-down-down. Hump Mountain for some reason has these fence posts in a couple of places (not sure why they are there). One set was on the ascent and the other on the descent. You had to straddle the lowest post and on the descent I noticed that they did not consider people with 28” inseams in getting over that final post. I thought I may be able to take up a second career singing with the Vienna Boys choir!
One notable area towards the bottom called Doll Flats, is where you leave NC for good. It was an open pasture area with a nice view down to what probably is the area of Elk Park NC. Eventually ending up at US 19E, I headed west for a few tenths of a mile to arrive at Mountain Harbour hostel, arriving about 2:00PM.
I had a mail drop of food there, and planned on staying, getting a shower (yes believe it or not after 5 days you do need one) and laundry. The hostel was full so I paid for a campsite and proceeded to get myself and my clothes clean. About 5:30PM, someone came and told me a bunk opened up in the hostel – so I moved in there. It was still cool and windy out, so I was thankful to be inside for one night.
As I was getting straightened out at the desk in the hostel (converting camping to hostel stay) – the two guys from Ohio arrived and were sitting outside. I went out to say hello and finally learned their name – Matt and Chris. They were headed back to Erwin TN to get their car and drive back to Ohio.
The hostel has a wood stove and it seemed like all young people who were staying believed the next Ice Age was upon us, therefore were chucking wood in the stove constantly. Scarecrow, Stitch, some other guy from Massachusetts and I were in the loft and for a few hours until everyone went to bed, it was about 1,000 degrees in the loft. I appreciated the warmth, but we were all laying on top of the covers sweating!
Tomorrow will be kind of a late start, as the hostel also has a Bed and Breakfast. You can pay an extra $12 for breakfast, which I did.","Overmountain shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559827,"Last night in the hostel was good, I was showered, had clean clothes and was out of the wind. Once everyone was in bed, the “sauna” created by the zealous feeding of the wood stove ebbed away and it cooled off by 11:00PM - then off to ""lala"" land until 6:40AM or so. People started to get up and pack, and we had to be up to the main house by 7:50AM for breakfast. Everyone raves about the breakfast (you have to pay a little extra for it) and it did not disappoint!I sat with a guy named Bruce from Washington Crossings PA, who had just finished a section hike yesterday. We had a nice conversation while eating about section hiking and then I headed down to pack up and head out.  I started hiking about 9:40AM - sort of late.
As I was starting up, a shuttle dropped off a group at the trail head on US 19E and they were following me as I hiked.
The weather was overcast and cool, perfect hiking weather. The trail as always started with a climb, but soon gave way to more gentle up and down through grass fields and old growth pine forests. I crossed path with the group, which had 5 people in it. A couple with their daughter and a dad with his daughter. They were section hiking for a few days, headed to Hampton TN. At one point there was a great view of Roan and Hump mountains (still snow covered) where we had come from the day before. I snapped a picture to post but I am sure it will not do it justice.
I took a sit down break at Noon and then started back in when all of a sudden I hear someone yell my name. It was Many Names and he had stayed at another hostel last night. Right behind him the couple, Lucky Penny and Already Stinky came along.  Of course after we talked a few minutes, them they left me in the dust.
By this time the sun was coming out and it was getting warm. Not hot, but since it has been cold the past couple of days you notice the higher temperature. I remember from last year adjusting to the higher temperatures. I am not sure if it is being from the north or what, but I hate admitting that it seems to impact my hiking.
Along the way I detoured a bit to see Jones Falls, which was nice.  Many Names and the crew were there and he took my picture with the falls in the background. I took off and eventually the trail was right next to the Elk River for a while and it was beautiful. It was here I crossed 400 miles.
I was not sure where I was going to stop and Mountaineer shelter was only 8.8 miles from where I started. But with the late start and a beautiful afternoon winding down, I decided to stop there for the night and enjoy what was left of it. I am camped on a hill above the shelter right next to the trail. This shelter looks pretty new and has three sleeping tiers.  It was empty when I got here, but two young guys came rambling by to go there as I was eating.
As I was setting up, Many Names came by (he had stopped at Mountaineer Falls which is about .2 miles below the shelter). This may be the last time I see him, as he should get to and leave Damascus before I get there.
Also met a guy about my age from Gaffney, SC - trail name Big O. Big O was looking for a couple of guys he had been hiking with the past few days. He was kind of pensive about what to do, but since I have trouble enough making my own decisions, it probably was not a good idea for me to make one for him. Since I had not seen them, he decided to push ahead and find a place to camp.
Going to try and get an early start tomorrow to get in 10 or more miles.","Mountain Harbor hostel

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559954,"It was real calm last night and it was probably in the mid 40's for temperature.  Much better than any night so far when sleeping outside.  I started packing up just before light and ate breakfast as the sun came up over the mountains in the east.It was cool and the sun was low in the sky, so the hiking was comfortable, aided by the fact that it was all relatively short ups and downs compared to the last 3 days.  I stopped at bench (an actual bench someone had carried in there) about 4 miles into the day’s hike to take a break. It was my version of Forrest Gump only instead of a lady sitting next to me, I had to talk to my pack. It had a really nice view of the mountains in the distance. After a few minutes Big O came hiking by and stopped to talk. He is very thoughtful in speaking which is probably why he seemed pensive to me yesterday afternoon. He seems like a really good guy and is thru-hiking, so I hope he makes it.
Crossing USFS 293, I  came across Dwight and Stanley (Dwight’s dog) and Big O once again, who was eating a couple of hotdogs that Dwight was cooking.  So I sat down and had a soda and hotdog and the three of us chatted. Dwight was a retired pilot that had settled down in Roan Mountain TN and did this trail magic when he had the time. It was appreciated.
By 11:30AM I was “back at it” and the cool morning was disappearing. As it was last year when I was hiking, the afternoon progress slows not only because I am getting tired, but not being used to the warmer temperatures seems to drag me back some. But that is true for most everyone.
The afternoon was uneventful and I stopped about 2 miles from the shelter to get enough water to drink and cook dinner and breakfast tomorrow. The guide book said that the water source at Moreland Gap shelter (where I was planning on staying) was not real reliable. Lugging 3 liters of water uphill was not helping my cause. When I got there, Bill (from Overmountain shelter fame) was there just relaxing, as he said he does not like hiking in the heat. Eventually he took off saying he will probably hike by head lamp some tonight. Having to do it one time while exiting on a long day hike in the Adirondacks, it does not appeal to me.
So I am at the shelter with Scarecrow and Energizer. Energizer is a lady about my age who is thru-hiking and regularly knocks out 15-18 mile days!  Also there is a couple (Jim and Ester) with their daughter who I met yesterday morning. They were part of the group of 5 I saw start leaving the gap at US 19E. The other dad/daughter combo that was with them originally had to drop Ester said because the dad’s knee was hurting him. So he got a shuttle out at one of the FS roads. They staying here tonight and then are hiking down to their car in the morning. It was parked at Black Bear Resort, where I have to stop for my next food mail drop. All of us sat at the picnic table in front of the shelter and talked as we ate.
It is about 6 miles to get to Black Bear Resort in the morning. I am not sure if I will stay overnight or just grab the drop and hike on. I have to look closer at the mileage and when I am going to hit Watauga Lake as there is a 4 mile section there that you have to hike straight through on. They have had bear problems for a couple of years so no AT camping is allowed. The 4 mile section is not the concern, it is just better if you are closer to the start of the restricted section when you start to get through it earlier in the day. The day includes a fairly big climb also just before the 4 mile stretch.
I did not take any pictures today so I lamed out and included one from yesterday.","Mountaineer shelter
",Moreland Gap shelter,"Apr 09, Sun",9.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559957,"I woke up about 3:00AM and was not falling back to sleep. So I put on my head lamp and took a look at the guide to check the mileage that would be needed to pass through the Watauga Lake area. I wanted to see the difference between staying at Black Bear Resort (where my last mail drop was) or if I picked it up and continued to hike for a few more miles. There is a 4 mile stretch of the trail through Watagua Lake that you have to just hike through due to past bear activity. After looking at it, I decided that picking up the drop and then continuing to hike would put me in a better position for getting through the restricted area with the least amount of miles. I was looking at 11+ miles, even in the shortest day. Not a big deal for the people who have been out for a while, but still a good day’s hike for me at this point, especially with a decent climb in the middle.I managed to fall back asleep for a few hours and got up in the dark and packed up. As usual, I made some breakfast as it was getting light. As I was finishing up, first Energizer then Scarecrow took off. Ester and Jim were up and making breakfast also.
So about 7:20AM, I headed out.
About literally 5 minutes into my hiking, I noticed my right foot was sore, right in the spot that it happened last year, just before arriving in Erwin. I thought it was probably just a fluke, so I sort of ignored it and continued on thinking it may be the immediate uphill, out of camp, that caused it. However as I traversed all different types of terrain (up/down, flat, rolling), it continued to not only be sore, but was getting increasingly noticeable. At this point I realized that I had probably crossed the threshold of tolerance for my foot and it was the same exact problem that resulted in the termination of my hike last year. After coming home last year, I was aware that the problem is caused some damage to my forefoot that happened earlier in life and though I did have some prescription inserts for my shoes to help, it was not guaranteed to resolve the issue. I was not willing to chance continuing to hike and risk the same foot issue, that took almost three months to heal (and the loss of any summer hiking in 2016). I decided right then if I could get back to my truck in Damascus, I would cut the hike short at Hampton TN. Luckily I had cell service and I called Black Bear Resort to find out if they shuttled as far as Damascus. The answer was yes and they could take me there as soon as I got down off the mountain.
I called my wife quick to let her know what I had decided and about trying to get a shuttle.
As I was headed down I crossed paths with an older gentlemen from Connecticut with a trail name of Slow Motion. Slow Motion was southbound on his way to completing his second section hike of the entire AT. In 2000-2005 he had completed a NoBo section hike of the AT, and now at 74 years of age, he was hiking from Pearisburg VA to Springer Mountain to complete a SoBO section hike of the trail. Quite impressive! Also of note, he had an original ULA Catalyst that was made by ULA founder Brian Frankel. The tag said “made in a garage”, which is how I believe ULA started.
I said goodbye to Slow Motion and continued on down to Dennis Cove Road, and then walked the .4 of a mile on the road to Black Bear Resort. I got my mail drop and was in a shuttle by 12:30PM, on my way back to Damascus.
I was back to my truck by 2:15PM and immediately threw in my gear and got on the road. I was not sure how long I would be able to drive, but I wanted to at least get partially home and not waste the rest of the day. Last time this happened, I could not use my right foot to drive for a number of days, so since it was still functional at this point, I wanted to see if I could get back without that occurring again.
As it happens, a couple of cups of coffee, playing music from my phone, two gas stops and 11 hours later - I pulled into the driveway in Syracuse. It was a long drive, but worth it.","Moreland Gap shelter
",Black Bear Resort,"Apr 10, Mon",6.70
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559958,"I have been home a couple of days and feel like I made the correct decision. My foot is no worse, but it was actually somewhat more sore by yesterday (Wednesday). However, I am able to stay on it and get stuff cleaned up and put away, which was not the case last year when my ankle was about the size of a small grapefruit. Back then all I could do was take Advil, sit and ice it for many days, just to get the ankle to bend somewhat normally. So I feel like I caught it in time.When I planned this hike, I realized that based on what the doctor’s told me last year – I may end up having to section hike the AT, if I was to continue. So after a long time to think about it, I decided that if section hiking was going to be the way to go, then perhaps 100-150 mile segments would be a good balance between getting some mileage done and minimizing interference with activities at home. So that became “experiment #1” for me. That was how I picked the Erwin to Damascus section, which was 126 miles.As I said in another entry, the doctor gave me a prescription for full length inserts for my hiking boots. I have worn these anytime I have hiked since last August, without incident – but those were only long day hikes. I am fairly sure they are the reason that I got as far as I did without the issue cropping up, but as I also knew – they probably are not a fix for the issue. I was told that surgery may be needed, but am not at a point yet where I am willing to do that, as the recovery would be a decent amount of time.While I love to hike, I also really like multi-day canoe and bike trips. So at this point I want to balance all three activities, not concentrate on one at the expense of another.At this point my conclusion at the end of this initial section hike is that I was able to hike 7 straight days (medium distance) until my foot “had enough”. To finish Erwin to Damascus was going to be a 12-14 day trip at the pace I was going – so that looks to be too long at this point. I want to go back and try another section sometime that will take 4-5 days and see how it goes.The obvious disadvantage of doing sections is first of all I am never in good “distance hiking shape” and secondly there is an expense and time factor to pay for the travel back and forth.The advantage is that preparation and planning is much easier, plus I get more chance to fine tune what items I actually need, for a set number of days. Although I had done a decent job scaling back this time compared to my first trip – there are still things that I can leave behind. This will help me get my pack weight dialed-in, which I am sure will help my foot problem to some degree, but also help with the fact that I am constantly getting back in hiking shape each time I go.Notes to self:1) I took a bear canister this time to compare to my use of the Ursack last year. While I accept the weight issue for the canister (we have to use them in sections of the Adirondacks), the space it takes in the pack makes it hard to pack around (not an unknown issue, just kind of annoying).2) I also did a better job on the amount of food, but I still can narrow that down some. I did not have the time or desire to cook as much as I tend to plan for. That will cut back on the amount of food, and fuel I will need to take.3) Forget measuring alcohol. I took a can with the stove and just snuffed out the flame when I was done heating/boiling. Then pour what is left back in the fuel bottle. This is not anything new to a lot of alcohol stove users, but I was stuck on measuring for some reason – no more, I am a snuffer.",,"Syracuse, NY","Apr 11, Tue",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582737,"I had planned on getting back south on the AT in 2017 one additional time in the Fall to get another section in the book, but we were too busy.  So I am planning on getting back down to Hampton TN this spring to get a short section in.
Last year I was attempting to get from Erwin TN to Damascus VA in one hike. But 7 days into the hike, my right foot (same one that ended a thru-hike attempt in 2016) began to act up again. As I said in a previous entry, I think I caught it in time and in less than a week was no worse for wear, but then again I did not ""hop out the door"" and starting hiking right away either.
At the conclusion of last year, I felt my attempt to go 12-14 days straight was probably too ambitious. Therefore I felt that I would try 5-6 days and see if I get by with that. So, that is the plan - to go back to Hampton TN and hike north to Damascus. The distance is only a little over 50 miles, but I know from both other hikes on the AT, I am not going to be knocking out big miles right away. I feel like I will be better prepared this time to some extent due to the hiking I have done this winter in the Adirondacks.
Looking out the window, I find it hard to imagine that all the snow will be gone and things will be starting to get green again, especially heading south.
Also this will be a special section because my daughter has agreed to tag along. She is super busy with her own family, but is going to spend a week hiking with me, which really means a lot to me.
Planning has started, so once again if everything works out, I will be adding some more entries to this journal.

I am super lucky to have my daughter, Jessica, with me this time and am really looking forward to her company.
We were all packed up at Jess’s house in Albany and on the road to Damascus by 7:20 AM or so. It was a nice day for traveling but still all highway driving until we exited Rt 81 about 6:50 PM onto VA 91.  About twenty minutes later we were in Damascus at the Hikers Inn. A long day of driving!
Lee, the owner was sitting right on the front porch and checked us in right away. Jess and I threw our bags in the room and headed over to Mojo’s for some dinner. Knowing we would need the extra boost tomorrow, we ordered chicken wings and a beer. Dinner was fish tacos and we were happy with the meal and looking forward to getting some sleep. We were in bed shortly after 10:00 PM, planning on getting up early for breakfast and dropping the car off at the Damascus Library lot before the shuttle will come at 9:00 AM to take us to Dennis Cove Road down in Hampton.",,"Damascus, VA","Apr 13, Fri",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587594,"We got up early and went back to Mojo’s for breakfast. This place does a good business without the hiker rush - it must be a mob scene when the northbound bubbles hit Damascus.
We ate and then dropped the car at the library, where it is to stay until we get back.
Eric our shuttle driver was right on time and we were headed to Hampton TN by 9:00 AM. There was a young guy already in the van, headed to Watauga Lake to continue his thru hike. Eric dropped us at Dennis Cove Road trailhead at 10:10 AM and we were on our way.
The trail starts out pretty tame all the way to the base of a mountain that makes up Pond Flats Wilderness area. We stopped to look at Laurel Falls. A little while later we stopped to filter water from a spring where a small snake was sunning himself. We joked that he was making sure people were not taking too much water.
Finally we reached the base of the mountain we had to hike over. It was getting really warm but we were feeling pretty saucy just cruising along. That lasted about 20 minutes or so as the trail continued to climb via a ""never ending number"" of switchbacks. Reality set in.
Being the first day out and with the temperatures approaching 80F, this became a “trudge fest” as you would expect. We stopped for lunch about 2:00PM. For lunch we had packaged humus and pretzels. As it turned out the pretzels were not the ideal vehicle for loading hummus on and Jess opened her package wide and dipped in the pretzels. I, on the other hand just snipped the corner of the package and squeezed it out on the pretzel. Jess looked at what I was doing and declared that I looked like a ""cake decorator"" which was true, but still made us laugh.  We finally reached the top about 3:30 PM.
After taking a short break we decided to continue on to Boots Off hostel were we had a food drop waiting. Our plan was to start with only 1 days food, limiting our weight the first day. We had made good time down the mountain and arrived at the hostel at 5:15 PM. We could have tented, but they had a cabin available, so we took that to save time not having to set up.
I retrieved the box of food I had mailed a week earlier and we went about getting cleaned up, eating and doing some relaxing. The hostel was busy but not too bad, as not that many thru hikers have made it this far yet. From talking to a few of them it seems like the weather has been bad a number of times forcing them to stop until it cleared. A lot of comments on snow in the Smokies.
Our last task of the evening was to divide up the food for our backpacks and it was kind of depressing to actually feel how much more weight we will leave here with tomorrow. Also Jess was looking at the weather for the next two days which said rain and some snow. Not unexpected for spring in the Appalachians.","Dennis Cove Road
",Boots Off Hostel,"Apr 14, Sat",8.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587700,"We had a good night
at Boots Off hostel. It is a good place to not only grab a mail drop,
but to spend the night. It was cloudy but fairly warm when we woke up
and we cooked some breakfast on the porch of the cabin we stayed in, while it sprinkled some. Not surprising as the weather forecast
called for rain off/on all day.
Packed up, and
heading out at 9:00AM, it immediately started to rain as we went down
the hostel driveway. So we got to the bottom where it joins the road
and put on our pack covers. It was too warm to actually put on any
rain gear.
The first few miles
are along Watauga Lake and we stopped so Jess could take care of a
few “hot spots” on her feet. This section is closed to everything
except hiking, and they ask you not to stop until you get to the dam
due to past bear activity.
It sprinkled some
all the way to the dam crossing, but still was warm. From looking at
the AWOL Guide we knew the first couple days of this section hike
were the most elevation gain, so leaving the dam was the start of the
climbing, though not as severe as yesterday.
The rest of the day
was kind of uneventful, with no chance to see any scenery with the
cloud cover in the mountains. We did stop about 2 miles from the
shelter to gather water from a spring. The guide showed the water
source at the shelter to be .3 miles down a steep hill. Not really
something you want to have to do at the end of the day, if there are
alternatives along the way.
When we arrived at
Vandeventer shelter about 4:00 PM, there was one guy who was cooking
on the platform and had set his tent up out back of the shelter.
Turns out he was from London and attempting a thru-hike. 
Right after a guy
came flying down the hill in a short sleeve plaid shirt, shorts and
an umbrella. He stopped at the shelter and was going to see if he
wanted to continue for a while longer or not, but the constant wind
and rain that was now in progress, made him decide to stay. This
guy’s name was Screaming Eagle and he hailed from the Northwest
Territory in Canada.
This place does not
have very much real estate for tenting, but we found Jess a spot and
I just needed two trees for my hammock. Also the guys found
out the roof of the shelter had several leaks, which makes your
sleeping bag placement challenging.
Once setup we went
to the shelter to cook dinner and one more guy arrived and was going
to stay at the shelter due to the weather. He was from Arizona. 
The wind continued
to deteriorate, so after we ate, everyone was headed to bed early.
The temperature was dropping and it was forecast for the rain to turn
to snow overnight.","Boots Off Hostel
",Vandeventer shelter,"Apr 15, Sun",9.10
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587838,"We woke up to
decreased winds, but the predicted dusting of snow on the ground. The
temperature was in the mid 30's so not everything was frozen. I got
up and snapped a picture of Jess's tent so she could see what it
looked like before emerging and knocking some of the snow off. 
On this hike, I
tried to save weight and space in my pack by bringing hammock quilts
that were rated for mid 30's. My thinking was that I had enough
clothes to make up the difference. However that is going to be tested
for sure, if it gets any colder, as last night I was not real warm.
This type of weather swing happened last year (warm then snow) but I
was hoping that starting 15 days later I may get away with lighter gear.
Since it was cold
already and it was supposed to snow on/off all day, we decided to
just have some coffee and start off, grabbing something to eat as we
hiked and warmed up. We were headed out about 9:10 AM, after Jess did
her “blister administration”.
It did snow
periodically all day with some fairly substantial wind gusts on the
ridges exposed to the west. As we hiked on, we really did not see
anyone heading north or south.
Eventually we
stopped for lunch at a campsite with water along the trail. We thought
we may need water, but that was not the case. However it had stopped
snowing and we thought it would be a good opportunity to pull out
lunch and eat quickly. As luck would have it, as soon as I opened my
pack to pull out the peanut butter, jelly and tortilla's to make our
""gourmet"" lunch, it started to snow again. We just laughed
because that was the second time in two days we tried to stop without
some precipitation, and as soon as we stopped it started back in.
Quickly we ate and
packed up as standing there we were just getting cold and wet.
As the afternoon
wore on, the temperature now was at best in the low 30's, but more
likely in the high 20's. Our goal was just to get to the next shelter
and get setup before the temperatures dropped lower.
Just before the
shelter, there was a water source, so we stopped and got all the
water we would need for the night and next morning. While we were
filtering water, a gentleman from Texas came hiking by and told us he
was day hiking. I mentioned that he picked a ""nice day"" for
a day hike and he said if I wanted to ""maintain that delusion""
he was OK with it. We laughed and he hiked on.
When we got to the
shelter about 3:45 PM, there was one young guy there in his sleeping
bag. He told us he never got up since staying there last night and
was waiting the weather out. Based on how it was, that was
reasonable. Shortly after that, others starting coming in as I think
everyone was intending to stop early for the day and get ready for a
cold night.
I had told Jess
about some of the ""colorful characters"" you cross paths
with on the AT, and some of the individuals that arrived did not
disappoint. We did not intend to stay in the shelter, so headed
across the trail to find a place to setup. Once we were setup, it was
still early so we decided to climb into our respective tent/hammock
and try to get a little warmer before making dinner.
As I laid in my
hammock, we heard voices of two guys talking of where to setup. This
shelter had a good deal of space in which to pitch a tent and there
were tents spread out over the space, as people arrived. The voices
sounded close, but that did not phase me, as sound seems to travel
well in open woods. They set up and one guy seemed to be in/out of
his tent and the other was on what sounded like a Neo-Air mattress
tossing/turning and grunting mildly with each turn. Probably trying
to get warm like we were. It was snowing again and I decided to look
over the edge of my hammock to make sure my boots were not filling
with snow and it was then I realized how close these guys were setup
to us. There was actually a pack lying on the ground partially under
my tarp. So I looked up under the tarp and saw that the ""grunt-er""
was about 3 feet from me. Not that I minded, but it was kind
of weird with all the space, that he picked that spot. Although that
air mattress had potential to be annoying overnight if he was to
continue to toss and turn. To top it off, his buddy had setup
literally with his tent touching the other tent. Then I thought maybe
the other person was not a guy, but that this was perhaps a couple and they felt better
being close.
Shortly after
discovering how the neighborhood had changed, it was confirmed that
the other guy, ""was a guy"". Our fellow camper that remained
in his tent kept trying to talk to his friend, yelling ""Tim...Tim???""
with no answer. It appears that “Tim” was more of a social
butterfly and running between his tent and the shelter where all the
characters had gathered around the fire pit, with one of them trying
to start a fire.
Eventually Jess and
I got out and went up to the shelter to use the picnic table to cook
dinner and get something warm to eat. There were a number of people
all doing the same thing. The temperatures were continuing to drop
and although it was only 6:30 PM, we were looking to get turned in
for the night to try and get warm.
As I was putting
stuff away for overnight, I noticed that our water bottles were
starting to freeze. That meant that overnight the bags of water we
had brought up from the stream were probably not going to make it, so
I dumped out the water to keep the bags from becoming liquid bricks.
We went to bed with
the snow falling, a squeaking air mattress and the sound of
""Tim....Tim....Tim???"".","Vandeventer shelter
",Iron Mountain shelter,"Apr 16, Mon",6.80
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587877,"I
got up around my normal 6:15 AM or so and got changed for the day. It
was colder than when we went to bed being in the low 20’s. My socks
that I
had on the previous few days were frozen solid, so I
had to go to my backup
pairs (I wear liners under my socks). Grabbing my boots I realized
they were frozen stiff, but luckily I remembered last years
experience at Overmountain shelter and had loosened up the lacing
good before going to bed.

Knowing
that my feet would not feel great standing around in frozen boots and
remembering that I had dumped all my water the night before, I
decided before waking Jess, I would go get water for breakfast and
for the morning hiking. It would let me thaw out the boots and get
the circulation moving in my feet.

The
forecast for the day was overcast in early morning and then sun, with the temperature going to low 50’s - aahhh summer!!

I
woke Jess up and made a “wing it” batch of coffee while she
started packing up. As
we packed up, we met our neighbors finally as they started packing
up. They were two friends (nice guys) one from San Diego and the
other from Dallas (I think), who were section hiking the AT, but
trying to cover 250 miles this section.

We
ate some granola Jess had made for the trip (awesome granola I may
add) and were ready to hike after 9:00 AM. Our starting times were
not great but more than adequate for the daily mileage we were
covering. From my experience not only do you gain in hiking shape the
longer you are out, but also you tend to get up and leave earlier
which in combination lead to higher daily miles by default. 

The
trail was snow covered, but the wind was minimal and it was not
snowing! A step in the right direction. About 1 mile into our morning
the sun started to peek through and we made a stop for Jessica to
tend to her feet. She seemed to be getting new “hot spots” and
blisters each day, but to her credit she took care of them right away
and seemed to be stabilizing each one. A discipline I lack. I was a
little concerned and trying to look at the coming road crossings in
case they got too much and we had to stop.

The
sun was out almost full time by late morning and with no leaves on
the trees, the snow started melting.

Around
Noon we were approaching the road crossing at TN 91, when a trail
runner came up behind us. He asked what we were doing and we told him
of the section hike we were on. I asked if there may be a picnic
table in the parking lot below at the road and he said no. We bid him
goodbye and he ran off. Just as we approached the parking lot he came
running back to us and told us if we crossed the road, the trail
traversed a Nature Conservancy land trust and there was a bench on
the top of the hill with a good view. That was really nice of him and
an example of the people you meet along this hiking trail.

We
hiked inside the fence on the land trust, which is a working pasture,
making our way to a barn on the property. Just past this barn was our
bench. The wind had kicked up some, but we just put on an extra layer
and made lunch. The view was nice and shortly the two guys who had
slept next to us the night before came hiking by.

We
started hiking discussing perhaps getting water at the next shelter
and continuing on a little further to minimize the distance the last
day into Damascus, our destination. It had turned out to be a really
good hiking day.

We
reached Double Springs shelter about 3:40 PM. There was one guy there
who said he was staying and we looked around and observed there were
really no good places to setup a tent. So I went up the trail a
little to get a cell signal to check the weather and then we would
decide if we would continue on. Also looking at the guide, it was
apparent that we would be stealth camping the next two nights if we
continued, so we could divide the remaining distance somewhat evenly.
We also noticed that although the distance from the next shelter to
Damascus was 9+ miles, it was mostly down!

Upon
returning from the hill to check the weather, I told Jess that it
made sense to stay here. The top of the hill had a lot of good places
to camp, the breeze was blowing but not crazy, and water was just
past the shelter just below us. She thought it sounded good, so we
joined Recon - a gentleman from Bennington VT on the hill, camping
for the night.

Jessica
strung up a line and we got all our wet stuff out and blowing in the
breeze. We marveled that the wet clothes we had been wearing until
today were still completely frozen solid.

We
got setup, went down and grabbed enough water for dinner, breakfast
and tomorrow’s morning hiking. Everything pretty much dried out and
with the temperatures only going into the mid 40’s overnight (no
rain predicted), it was going to be perfect for sleeping. 

Dinner
was done, chores were completed and we were headed to bed by 8:30 PM.

did the breakfast drill while packing up. The weather forecast was
for temperatures rising to the low 70’s and although it was a
little cool now, it seemed like that was going to be a good
possibility.
Just before leaving,
Jessica sat down and tended to her feet. Although she had several
toes and spots on her feet covered, I was starting to feel like she
was going to be ok for the next two days, as we hiked toward Damascus.
With the blister
admin completed, we got on the trail at 9:30 AM, but that was better than
having to stop in a mile or two. As we started to hike, you could
feel that the temps were going to get noticeably warmer than the past
couple of days.
About 4 miles into
the morning, we hit Low Gap, where there was a picnic table and a
piped spring right next to the road. We stopped to get water,
something to eat and have Jess do a “foot check”. There were a
couple of young guys there that were slack packing to Damascus and a
young girl from Ohio. One of the young guys mentioned that he had
been fighting blisters since leaving Springer. They got so bad he
stopped (I think in Erwin) to see a doctor and the doctor said to put
band-aids on them! Kind of lame response, so I hope that visit did
not cost too much.
Our goal was to get
to Abingdon Gap shelter and about 2:00 PM we stopped to take a break and
eat lunch at what we think was Double Springs Gap campsite along the
trail. It was pretty warm and we stayed about 45 minutes to cool
down. It was only a couple of miles to the shelter, so we would get
there no problem with plenty of time to get water and setup.
As we approached the
shelter around 4:00 PM, there was a young guy from Oregon sitting
trying to decide if he was staying or hiking. His comment was that he
was concerned how hot it was, which was kind of ironic after the past
couple of days, but he was right. No one seemed acclimated to the
higher temperatures. We knew we were staying and went off to find a
place to setup, which there were many choices. Once setup we headed over
past the shelter to get water where we met Maverick, who was at Boots
Off the Saturday night we stopped there. He had hiked 16 miles a few
days (after staying at Boots Off a few days due to an injury) and was
going to stay before pushing on to Damascus tomorrow. He said he kind
of recognized our accent (we don’t think we have one :-) as he was
originally from Buffalo, NY - a fellow up-stater. After chatting for
a few minutes, we headed down the hill .2 mile to get the water we
needed for the night and through the next morning.
Back on top where we
were camping, we started to get dinner started. Two guys
came in and setup tents near us, but not as close as the other night.
One guy was from Ireland and we did not catch where the other guy was
from but his trail name was Easy Peasy. By this time there were a
number of people at the shelter, some staying, others resting and moving
on. There were a number of other tents and hammocks as well.
Having eaten and
cleaned up, we got ready to “hit the hay” by 8:20 PM. The
forecast said it was to go into the low 40’s, so both Jess and I
layered up a little before turning in. The wind was kicking up but it
was still kind of warm, so I ended up shedding a layer to fall
asleep. Tomorrow would be our last day and while we both knew we
needed to get back home, we also were kind of disappointed it was
almost over.","Double Springs shelter
",Abingdon Gap shelter,"Apr 18, Wed",8.30
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588053,"It did rain a little
overnight, so everything was a little damp when I got up. The
temperature never seemed to go below the high 40’s, so both Jess
and I were warm all night. In fact we both commented that we were too
hot, but we were happy because we were not cold.
Packing up, it was
overcast and the forecast was for cloudy and cool, but no rain. As we
ate breakfast everyone slowly made their way down the trail, headed
to Damascus. We started hiking at 8:52 AM, a PR for us!
We were the last to
leave again, and even though this would probably be the most miles we
covered all week, the AWOL guide showed it generally downhill all the
way. Even in our minimal hiking shape we traveled downhill fairly
fast. Especially Jessica when she decided to snack while hiking. I
would see her eat something and then 5 minutes later she was putting
distance between us.
The trail was indeed
down most of the way and we took our time. We were only passed by a
few other hikers who I assume started somewhere south of Abingdon Gap
shelter. You could kind of tell everyone was excited to get to town.
The forecast seemed
correct, it was only in the high 40’s and cloudy with a good breeze
blowing when we were exposed to the west.
About mid-day we
finally reached the TN/VA state line. This was supposed to happen for
me last year but I had to cut that section hike short. However as
fate would have it, I was able to share this milestone with my
daughter, which was special. We stopped and ate some lunch (any food
we could get rid of made the pack lighter!).
After about 30
minutes we were back at it, on the final descent. With the weather
cool and cloudy, we did not need to stop for water. The trail
switchbacks quite a bit before it dumps down into Damascus, so with
the leafless trees we could see houses and cars way before we were
down.
The trail kind of
dumps into a lawn between two houses and at this point was not real
worn, so we wondered if it was the actual trail? However the street
was right there and I could see the library where the car was parked,
so we just walked to the street across the lawn. Turning back you
could see an Appalachian Trail sign, so it must be correct.
It was 2:20 PM when
we got to the car and took the packs off for the final time. Another
great hiking day.
Jessica had been
talking about this pie she saw at Mojo’s the day before we started.
So we made the decision to stop there and each have a piece of pie
and coffee to celebrate. When we got there, they did not have the pie
she had been talking about, so we got a piece of each of the two pies
that were available and split them. They were both good. Also at the
next table were three guys – Easy Peasy, the Irishman and some
friend. 
When we were done,
we said goodbye and good luck to them and headed north in the car. We
thought that driving a few hours and booking a hotel, would make the
trip back to Albany shorter the next day.
Needless to say it
was awesome having Jess along for this hike. We had a good time and
were exposed to quite a diverse range in temperatures. She was able
to get a flavor for some of the characters that make up the AT and we
met a lot of nice people.
Hoping I can talk
her into it again sometime!!!","Abingdon Gap shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588359,"Well section hike #2
is in the books and overall went well. This was a short one, but that
was my intention to try and find a number of days that I could go
consecutively without my foot reacting negatively. We hiked 6 days in
a row and the foot was starting to get sore. So right now I am
thinking that maybe 5 days straight, with a day off, then try to hike
some additional miles may be the next step. But I need to look at the
next section to see how that would be planned out.
The one major
disappointment was the failure of being able to get the SPOT' rental
program to work, to use my device for the hike, so my family could
see our progress. Luckily the cell coverage in this section is pretty
good, so we could let them know things were OK each day. I got a SPOT
device when I started my 2016 thru-hike attempt, at the request of my
wife. I paid for a yearly subscription then and basically it worked
fine for the hike other than reporting an errant SOS message just
outside of Erwin TN. That caused a little angst for my wife, but I
was able to text her to let her know I was fine. When I had to get
off the trail in Erwin, I contacted SPOT and they had no idea what
happened, but they replaced the device. I renewed the service
subscription for 2017, and used the device on the section hike last
spring, without incident. However for 2018, I decided to try the new
“rental” program they now offer. I did a test of service using
the rental program at home (2 day hikes) with my device and it worked
as expected. However, when I went to try and register for a service
subscription for this hike about a week before leaving, I found that
their web page did not work correctly, in that you could only book a
subscription on the current day (would not let you choose day in the
future). Since I was trying to schedule service for a week out, that
was not going to work for me. I called them and they confirmed that
it did not work for individuals wanting to use their own device,
although the web page was formatted for that as an option. They told
me to log into the web page the morning I wanted to start hiking and
set it up. Needless to say that is kind of an absurd answer, as most
hikers (including me) are not going to have access the morning they
are starting to hike in the remote areas where the trailheads are
located. They offered to set it up for me on the day I started and I
left it at that. However, checking that morning, it was not done and
I quick called them before the shuttle came to take me down to
Hampton. The customer service person told me to call back in a couple
of hours when someone who may know what to do, was in the office. I
told them to forget it. Bottom-line, SPOT appears to have put out a
service for a rental program that only works if you actually rent the
device from them, it does not work effectively for people who already
own a device.
The other thing that
stood out for me this time was having Jessica with me. In 2016, it
became apparent to me that although I love the act of traveling by
foot, taking everything you need with you, it is much better if that
is shared with someone close to you. To be fair, I don't think I
spent enough time on the trail to ever fall into the friendships that
some people seem to find as they thru-hike. That may have eventually
happened in 2016, but I will never know. However, I now have
confirmed, at least in my mind, that having someone along the way, is
the best way to enjoy hiking.
We took bear
canisters again this trip, a Wild Ideas Weekender and BV 450. They
held everything we needed for the six days of hiking and due to the
fact that I had cut down further on my pack load, it was easier to
fit and pack around the canister (at least in my pack).
Notes to self:
1) If I hike again
in April, I need to bring a full length under-quilt for the hammock.
The torso length ones are good when the nicer weather rolls around,
but we had temperatures at night ranging from the 20's to the 50's.
Damp feet in cold weather with a torso length UQ are not ideal.
2) I took a new CNOC
Vecto water bag with me this time to use as a dirty water bag. It was
really easy to fill (as advertised) and I had no problems with
leaking when carrying water in it. However, I found that the threaded
end (where the bottle cap is – and you attach your filter) is
flexible enough that you have to be careful threading anything on it.
It will not seal if you bend the threading at all, which may be why I
have seen some people talk about them leaking. It is easy to
recognize once you experience it, so not a big deal – just
something you have to pay attention to.
3) I did a better
job of cutting back on food, but still can cut some more out. We did
use all the main meals we took, but that was because we cooked each
night.",,"Elizabethtown, NY","Apr 29, Sun",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604188,"I am on my way down
to southern Virginia to do another short section hike. This one will
take me from Damascus to the Troutdale area. My plan is to travel
down to Washington, DC with my wife to my oldest son’s house. My
wife will stay there and I will continue on to Troutdale. I will
leave my vehicle at Sufi Lodge, get a shuttle to Damascus and start
hiking back to Troutdale.
As I was getting
ready for this section, I saw that part of the trail was closed
for camping around the Mount Rogers/Grayson Highlands area (about 17
miles of trail), so there was a chance I was going to have to get
down to Grayson Highlands State Park, off the AT, if I needed to camp in
this area. It looks like that section is now back open, so I
should be able to just use my hammock the entire section and not have
to worry about tenting in the state park.
This fall is kind of
packed with places we have to be, from early October, all the way
through Thanksgiving, so I am lucky to even sneak this hike in.
However at some point I am going to have to be able to dedicate some
longer time frames to these hikes if I ever expect to get a
significant portion of the AT done.",,"Elizabethtown, NY","Oct 08, Mon",0

yesterday and drove to our son Jared’s home in Washington, DC. My
wife is staying with them to visit, while I am in Virginia. 
I left today around
11:00 am and headed towards Troutdale VA, where I was staying the
night and leaving my truck, at Sufi Lodge. About 6 hours later I was
pulling in.
I met James when I
arrived, he showed me around and where my room was.  Hiking
season is winding down,and I am the only one here tonight. Suzanne
offered to make dinner, but I had eaten a late lunch and just wanted
to get my stuff out of the truck and go over my pack one last time.
In conversation, James told me that while they are busy for the Spring bubble of
Northbounders, the Fall is slower since most Southbounders have been
hiking 1500 miles by now and seem to be focused more on getting to
Damascus and finishing.
I will get a shower
in the morning, have some breakfast after which James will drive me
down to Damascus where I will start hiking back to Troutdale.","Washington, DC

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604553,"I got up early,
showered and packed up my stuff. Suzanne had breakfast ready at
8:00 am sharp which was scrambled eggs and berry scones along with
coffee. It was all really good.
James took me right
after breakfast to Damascus and I was hiking by 9:30. As we were
driving down the winding roads we passed a ton of vans all towing
trailers loaded with bicycles. They were dropping off people who were
going to ride the Creeper Bike trail back to Damascus. 
It had rained
overnight and it was overcast and cool. Of course starting from the
road meant there was nowhere to go but “up”. It did not last too
long, and then the trail was more tame and I recovered from the
initial climb.
I passed my first
Southbounder by 10:30 or so and he was flying. Probably excited about
getting to Damascus.
I passed a couple of
day hikers and as the day went on the clouds broke and the sun poked
through, but it was still cool. 
As I worked my way
along the trail you could see many people flying down the Creeper
trail on bikes as the two paths parallel one another for a while.
During this time I
crossed paths with Red Line a nice young kid from NC who is thru
hiking southbound. We talked about 10 minutes and I learned he lived
in Rochester NY for a while after college working what sounded like
some kind of mechanical engineering job.
Climbing up a long
switch back, I saw a young guy who was also going North. He said he
was from Richmond, and was hiking a section towards Lynchburg where
he had family. He seemed to be struggling some, then mentioned he had
2 weeks of food in his pack. Better him than me!
At the end of the
switchbacks, approaching the cutoff for Saunders shelter, I
crossed paths with two large groups of section hikers headed south.
The first group was middle aged guys, but the second group was a few
adults and about 10 teenage boys. Everyone was real friendly. At the
cutoff for Saunders shelter I took a break and decided to keep hiking
as it was only 2:30 pm. AWOL had a campsite another 2+ miles north
with a water source. 
I got here about
4:00 pm and got, water, set the hammock up and ate dinner. One of the descriptions of the campsite was stagnant pond, which was an apt description. During this
time a few southbound groups went by and finally about 6:30, four
young people stopped and are camped nearby on the only flat spot I saw.
It got dark about
7:00 pm, so I just hopped in the hammock and pounded out this entry.","Damascus, VA
",Pond campsite,"Oct 13, Sat",11
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604599,"I got up at 6:00 am
and started to break camp and eat breakfast. I was in no hurry as it
was still dark out and when I just start a trip I don’t like
leaving the campsite until I can see and make sure I have everything.
I really don’t trust checking by headlamp.
As I headed out it
started sprinkling so on went the packa to cover the pack, but I left
the rain coat dangling. That worked until I hit the section where the
trail and Creeper bike paths are “one in the same” for a short
distance. Being in the open I found it was raining harder than I
thought and realized the woods on the trail were providing good
cover. So on went the jacket.
Just before 10:00 am I
reached Lost Mountain shelter and stopped for a break. While I was
there a Southbounder came through and signed the register. We chatted
for a few minutes then he was gone. I left a few minutes later. It is
a nice shelter with a good amount of space and trees for tents and
hammocks.
As the trail crossed
a cow pasture, I could not help noticing all the cow pies on the
trail. These cows have great aim control and get a majority of their
output “right on target”. It is too bad they weren’t Moon Pies
as I could have gotten my fill.
After the cow
pasture the trail started a steady climb made a little more difficult
due to the rocks. This happens at times, but it usually gets over
quickly. However this was a good two miles or so, which made the time
drag.
It continued to
rain.
Once the rocks
ended, the trail climbs over a grassy section where if it were clear
probably would have been a great view. But not today.
One good thing was
the rain quit, even though it remained overcast.
It was a little
after 2:00 pm and I passed a good campsite. But I thought I would
continue down to where the trail crosses VA 600. Hoping there would
be somewhere to camp there, I found out from a Southbounder I crossed
paths with, that there was a good spot right behind the parking lot
off the road. As it turns out there is a latrine also, which is a
definite plus.
I was in the hammock
by 6:30 pm, listening to the rain hit the tarp. As I laid there, I
heard some voices and assumed it was day hikers returning to their
cars. I fell asleep for a few hours, only to awaken to answer
“natures call” and it was at that time I realized that the voices
I heard before were not people in the parking lot, but hikers
that were tenting.","Pond campsite
",VA 600,"Oct 14, Sun",12.40
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604603,"Well during the
night there was a steady gentle wind blowing and when I arose for
another “natures call” shortly after midnight, I was greeted by
clear skies and a good amount of stars. As I settled back down, I
thought it would be awesome if the coming day was sunny and rain
free, as I would be traversing at least some of the Grayson Highlands.
I was up just before
6:00 am and trying to be extra quiet since the other hikers camping
were not stirring yet. It was only about 15 minutes and I saw
headlamps coming on in the two tents, so I was not worried about
making too much noise at that point.
As I was headed out
just shortly after 7:30 am, all three people were finishing up getting
packed too. I stopped and found out they were Southbounders and of
course excited about getting to Damascus.
I crossed VA 600 and
headed through the pasture, I guess it's called Elk Garden (since that
is the trail head name). Once I left the pasture through the back
gate, the trail was really nice and rolling right through an area
called Deep Gap.
As the trail started
to climb, it became somewhat rocky, but still pretty tame. At about
mile 497+, you come to a sharp turn in the trail and the intersection
with some blue-blaze side trail. The view here was spectacular, so I
stopped and snapped a picture since it was one of the better views in
quite a while.
The day was starting
as I hoped. Cool, clear and no rain in sight.
I reached Thomas
Knob shelter about 10:10 am and took a good break. The shelter is just
past the short cut-off to Mount Rogers, the highest peak in VA, so I
was over 5000’ up. There was a section hiking couple there in the
shelter packing up and heading towards Damascus. Shortly after that a
dad, daughter and friend of theirs arrived. They were from Manchester
Center VT, and the dad and daughter were thru-hiking southbound and
their friend had joined them for this section, stopping at Damascus.
As we sat talking
for a few minutes, there were some of the horses that inhabit the
area hanging out in the woods, right across from the shelter. The
area is known for the wild horses, so I was sure I would see many
more.
I left about 10:30 am
and started the Grayson Highlands traverse. The views everywhere were
great when you came out of the sparse woods. I came across a pony and
adult walking right on the trail ahead of me. I stopped to take a
picture. As I looked at my phone to make sure the picture came out
ok, a voice behind me said “hello” and I nearly dropped my phone
and stumbled over. I was so engrossed in the moment, it completely
took me by surprise that anyone was around. It was a young girl from
Massachusetts out day hiking. We hiked along together for a few
minutes then she went on ahead.
As I proceeded
through the highlands, I started seeing more and more day hikers
probably coming in from Massie Gap along with a number of horses just
hanging out.
It was a beautiful
day, but with no cover of woods, it actually felt hot. But the views
you have from this area make you forget everything. I crossed the 500
mile mark and then hit what they call the Fat Man squeeze. It is a
constriction in the rocks, that take no more than shifting slightly to get through, but I am sure in the old days when packs
were not as small and people carried much more food and equipment, it
may have been somewhat of a challenge to some.
The whole day I had
been debating on how far I was going to hike. The area had been
opened back up for camping earlier in the month and the next shelter
was Wise, which I was going to hit in the early afternoon. I got
there at 1:30 pm and took a good 20 minute break, deciding to get to
Old Orchard shelter, which was 6+ miles away and would take me most
of the afternoon. I slow down in the afternoon noticeably, so at this
point that would be as far as I would go.
Wise shelter was
below 5000’, but you climb back up to 5000+ as you pass through
more pasture and eventually an area called the Scales. There is a
corral there you pass through just before the final climb to an
intersection with the Pine Mountain trail.
After that it is
basically downhill all the way to Old Orchard shelter, which I
reached at around 5:15 pm. There were a few clothes strung up and a
sleeping bag laid out, but no hiker. I assumed they were getting
water. As I turned to leave, I hear a voice say “sorry – I will
be right up to gather up my mess”. I looked around and saw a guy
standing down at the “bear box” that was installed recently. 
As I had reached Old
Orchard, I made the decision, that I was going to keep going the 1.5
more miles down to VA 603 and hope there was a camp spot with trees.
But before I left, I went over to say hello to the guy who yelled to
me, to let him know I was passing through. As I approached he was
starting to brush his teeth and he sheepishly apologized for standing
there in his underwear. We both laughed as I told him I was so tired
I did not notice (which was true). He was from Fort Collins, CO, and
was southbound, like many others. He told me the trail going down was
nice and I wished him luck and headed down.
Shortly after
6:00 pm, I did get to the campsite right behind the parking lot on VA
603. Very similar to last night, but no one was here. I quick threw up my hammock and tarp and started dinner. As I did this it started
to sprinkle, so I moved everything under the tarp.
As soon as I was
done eating, I cleaned up and got in the hammock. All I wanted to do
was to get off my feet.
As I laid there, it
really started to rain and I thought how lucky I was to have the
entire day as nice as it was in one of the nicest areas, I have hiked
through so far.","VA 600
",VA 603,"Oct 15, Mon",17.70
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604623,"I must have been
overtired last night, because for some reason I could not fall asleep
for at least a few hours. That is strange because normally I am prone
for about 5 minutes before my eyes are closed for the night. I know I
slept though as I had a couple of crazy dreams before morning came
and I was up at my usual time just before 6 am.
Everything was wet,
but that did not matter because I knew I had a moderate day ahead, as
this hike was going to end at Dickey Gap and I would be hopping back
in my truck and heading home via DC later that afternoon.
I ate breakfast and
packed up. No one else ended up camping at the site, so there was no
need to damper my headlamp use or worry about making too much noise. I
was not moving real fast and actually got hiking shortly after
8:00 am.
After immediately
crossing VA 603, the creek that flows parallel to the highway was
running fairly strong, a good indication that it rained more than a
little last night.
The trail was in
really good shape maintenance-wise and although it was the normal up-up-up
from the road, it was not overly taxing.
I crossed paths with
a few Southbounders, a couple solitary hikers and also a pair of guys
that I shot the breeze with for a few minutes. Despite all the rain
they had faced this Southbound season, they were still in really good
moods and were looking forward to getting not only to Damascus, but
were the first ones that spoke specifically about Springer, the end.
Eventually I topped
out and started heading downhill towards Hurricane Shelter. I was
stopping there because supposedly you can get a cell signal. I
was going to call Sufi Lodge and see if James could meet at Dickey Gap
and shuttle me back to my truck parked at their facility. It would
save me a 3 mile road walk.
The shelter is a
little off the trail, and I dropped my pack along the trail and
followed the blue blaze to the shelter. I was able to get a cell
signal, talked to one of the owners and arranged for them to pick me
up at a designated time.
As I was hanging up
the call, a guy came up with a camera. He had hiked in to take
pictures of the shelter to help out a friend of his who was
attempting to photograph all the AT shelters. Since I had just
committed to being down at Dickey Gap by 12:45 pm, I said goodbye and
took off to grab my pack and continue the hike down. Actually down is
not really accurate as with any hiking on the AT there is always some
significant “up” involved and this was no exception. But overall
it was down.
I really just hiked
down without stopping other than to stop to take a quick picture of
Comers Creek Falls. When I got to Dickey Gap, James was waiting. I hopped in and we were back in 5 minutes to the Lodge
where my truck was parked.
They offered to let
me use the shower, which I took them up on. I had remembered one
other time I did a section hike and just hopped in my car with
“multiple days of hiking” logged, in the same clothes, and I was
reluctant to get out of the car other than to get gas. So this time,
I would feel better about getting out and grabbing something to eat
without having to find a drive-thru.
I said my goodbyes
and was on the road by 1:30 pm. A quick stop for a bite to eat and cup
of coffee in Wytheville along Rt 81 and I was on my way back to
Washington DC to spend a few days with my son’s family before we
head back to Syracuse.","VA 603
",Dickey Gap,"Oct 16, Tue",7.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604644,"This hike went faster
than I had planned. The day going over Grayson Highlands was so nice,
I wanted to take advantage of it. There was also the fact that the
area had been closed for camping due to human-bear encounters for a
while during the summer, so getting through that stretch also seemed
like a good idea. They have installed bear boxes at all the shelters
and I carried a bear canister also, but when I got to Old Orchard
shelter, I just thought another 1.5 miles to VA 603 was not a huge
deal, so I went for it.
For this hike, I
changed out my Merrell Moabs for a pair of trail runners. The Moabs
still have a little “hiking life” left, but I had been
experimenting with some different trail runners on day hikes in the
Adirondacks with mixed results. I had tried a pair of Hi-Tec trail
runners and they were ok, but kind of narrow. Then I tried a pair of
New Balance trail runners, but on a long day hike slog over the
summer, the result was two lost toenails, despite being a larger
size, so they are not the answer.
I wanted to give
this idea one more shot, so I found a pair of Altra Lone Peak runners
on sale and bought a half size larger. After a fiasco trying to order
them through Altra directly, I ended up cancelling the order (they
never shipped them) and found a pair at REI, who shipped them the
next day. This was kind of crazy (at least in my opinion) to try out
a new shoe, without any wear time, immediately on a multi-day hike.
But not always being totally logical, I did. The bottom-line is that
I had no problems with blisters or toenails, I was able to cover the
mileage I wanted with nothing more than tired feet at the end of the
day. They are super dirty right now, but as soon as I get home I will
do my normal post-hike shoe cleanup routine and see how they held up.
Right now these feel like a good shoe for me to hike in, but time and
more hiking will tell.
Notes to self:
1) I took a bear
canister again and had no problem fitting 5 days of food in it along
with my cook kit and other items. This made packing much easier since
the cook kit is round and a pain to find a home for in my pack.
2) I used a BeFree
water filter this time and it worked great. We bought one of these to
use canoeing, where we just reach over the side of the boat, filled the
bag and had drinking water while paddling. It allowed us to dump all
water on portage and refill once back in the boat. My Sawyer is
starting to slow down despite all the cleaning techniques used, so it
stayed home this time. The BeFree bag is kind of small, so I took a
2L Hydrapak bag for bulk filtering. This all worked well.
3) I forgot some
kind of bag (usually use a contractor trash bag) to put my pack in at
night. With all the rain they have had down south, the woods were
really damp and then it actually rained a few times during the hike. I
need to remember to put that in next time, as I think it helps keep
the residual dampness down while your pack lays on the ground
overnight.",,Washington DC,"Oct 20, Sat",0

and I had left Albany after she got out of work on Friday afternoon.
We drove to Chambersburg PA, where I had made a hotel reservation. It
poured rain once we got in PA and made the driving slow, but better
now than when we are hiking. 

Saturday
morning we got on the road with our destination being Bear Garden
Hiker Hostel in Ceres, VA. We made a couple of stops along the way,
once at a Northface outlet, where Jess replaced her fleece with a
light insulated jacket (she said about half the size of the fleece
packed). Since we wanted to just get organized for the Sunday start
once we got to the hostel, we also stopped for pizza in Wytheville,
VA (Moon Dog Pizza which was good).

Arriving
at the hostel about 6:20PM, we found one young man staying there for
the night. He was waiting a few days for new shoes. Also later three
thru-hikers who slack packed that day arrived. Bob, the owner, showed
us around and we sat down on the porch to divide up the food and do a
final pack review.

Bob
was shuttling us to Dickey Gap (where I left off last Fall) in the
morning and we decided that he would take us at 6:30AM. Jess’s
car would remain at the hostel. Our plan was to try and get back to
the hostel by mid-afternoon Wednesday, resupply and shuttle up the
trail to VA 623 and then hike south back to the hostel over a couple
of days. That would put us right at the end of the time Jess could
allocate to this segment of fun.

The
next morning (Sunday) we
were up at 5:30AM, got dressed and waited for Bob to come down from
his house for the shuttle. He arrived right at 6:30AM and an hour
later, he was dropping us at Dickey Gap to start hiking. We got on
the trail about 7:50AM in cool overcast weather – perfect for
hiking.

Our
first goal was Trimpi Shelter where we could take a break and make
some coffee, which we bypassed this morning to get going. It would be
just a hair over 4 miles and seemed reasonable. It was probably about
11:00AM when we arrived. We filtered some water, made coffee and
talked with several groups of people who were thru-hiking and stopped
here to take lunch break. We were the first to leave deciding that an
early afternoon lunch would be our next stop. It was still overcast
and cool, with the sun peeking in/out.

About
1:30PM we stopped for lunch and water. By now the temperature had
climbed probably into the high 60’s and the sun was out most of
the time. With the leaves just starting to pop out, we were starting
to feel the heat, seeing as it is still cold up north and we were not
acclimated. Of course I am sure the thru-hikers had their share of
cold weather earlier and they probably were not real used to much
heat either.

As
the day wore on, we decided to just try and look for a flat spot to
camp for the first night along the trail. We had enough water to
drink,
make
dinner and have breakfast, so about
.4 of a mile from VA 601, we stopped and it was about 4:30PM.

The
day had been beautiful, but covering a little over 9 miles seem to be a
good distance for day one. The trail was dry and in good
shape.

We
got setup, cooked dinner and were in bed before the sun set for the
evening.","Dickey Gap
",No name campsite,"Apr 28, Sun",9.40
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612742,"Unlike
most of the hikers we are crossing paths with, we are not trying to
cover 20-30 miles each day. That
would be impossible just starting out and would be taxing if I ever
stayed out a long time. So breaking camp at 8:30AM was fine, and we
said “good morning” to several that started earlier and were
passing our unofficial camp spot.

We
were camped on a ridge and about midnight a gentle steady breeze blew
in from the southeast, which pressed my hammock tarp right against
the side of my hammock but never made any sound. That is not usually
the case in my experience when you are up higher. The wind can make a
tarp create quite a racket, which can prevent you from getting solid
sleep. Luckily, not the case last night.

The
day started cool and breezy – perfect for hiking once again. We had
checked the multi-day weather forecast while at the hostel yesterday
and it showed warm days in the 80’s and sunny. So our perfect
morning was not probably going to last.

Just
before 11:00AM we reached Partnership Shelter and took a packs-off
break. This
is the shelter that has a shower and is just a few hundred feet from
a Visitors Center. The shelter looks fairly new and was maintained
well. Among all the notices posted on the wall in the back, Jess
noticed one that said there was a “controlled burn” being done
ahead on Glade Mountain and a section of the trail would be closed
for the day. That was a topic of conversation at the visitors center
where everyone was stopping to get water from an outside spigot. Lots
of bravado from one young man in particular, who declared “no one”
was going to stop him from maintaining his “white blaze only hike”.
Jess and I smiled at one-another and said good luck with his fight
versus the Forest Service.

The
trail to this point had been rolling and dry, but fairly rocky in
certain sections. I noticed this both days so far. It seemed like
the stretches of rock and questionable footing were longer than
anywhere I remembered so far, but I am sure nothing like what I
assume PA is like.

We
left the visitors center at
11:45, carrying extra water since we were not sure where we would
camp and there were no documented water sources in AWOL until the
next shelter. The next shelter was after the “closed section”, so
even if we were feeling “saucy” and thought we could hike to the
shelter, it did not look like it was going to be possible.

Our
plan was to hike until around 1:00PM and then take a lunch break. As
we hiked the random cloud cover mostly disappeared and the sun was
out in full force. The temperature climbed and it felt a little
hotter already then at mid-day yesterday.

We
just stopped along the trail at 1:15PM and took a good 40 minute
break to eat, relax and cool off. I was trying this section hike to
lay back and get my feet up every break and this was no exception. As
I relaxed there was
a
guy, who probably had
been in the military and was thru-hiking, passing by. We said hello to
him back at Partnership shelter, where I was in the same “feet-up”
position. Well as he passed us this time, he said he recognized us
since I was laying down again along the trail. I told him I was
“really good” at relaxing and practiced often. We both laughed
and he hiked by.

Just
before 2:00PM we started hiking again, and now the temperature seemed
to be slowing us down along with some short climbs. Several groups of
young people came up from behind, all commenting on the fact that
they wanted to see about the trail closure ahead.

Jess
and I stopped again at 3:00PM in a col where
there was an informal campsite. It was early, but ahead was a longer
climb and then a descent to USFS 86, which is where the trail closure
began. We thought that if all the others that had passed us, were
stymied from proceeding up the trail towards Glade Mountain (where
the burn was taking place), then any place to camp at the road there
would be spoken for.

So
true to form, I took off my pack, put my feet up and discussed with
Jess what we should do. As
we talked, a
guy
about my age, came hiking by, but south-bound. We chatted probably
about 20 minutes and found out he was from somewhere around
Pearisburg VA and sectioned hiked from around home to as far south as
Damascus. He told us he had done this many times, as he enjoyed this
part of the AT. He told us that there was a good camp spot and water
at the road intersection. He also said that the Forest Service was
letting hikers continue through the “closed section” of the
trail, so no one should be camping at this time at the road. It was
at this point, we decided to hike on and camp at the base of the
trail before it started up Glade Mountain.

We
arrived at the road and got setup. The campsite was fairly big, but
the best spot for a small tent and hammock were off to the side. We
setup there and left the campsite for any others that came later. As
it turns out there was a young couple and two 50-something guys that
ended up camping too.

As
we started to cook dinner, the Forest Service guy came by to pick up
his truck. I went over and asked him about the trail closure. He said
that today they hoped to get the burn done, but that the humidity
prevented the fire from catching good. So they were coming back
tomorrow, but if we got hiking early (before 9:00AM) we would be able
to cross the section that would be closed.

Same
drill as every night, eat, clean up and to bed before it gets dark.
The night was calm and still fairly warm, so it looked like another
night of good sleep was at hand.","No name campsite
",Glade Mountain Road,"Apr 29, Mon",8.80
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612979,"After talking with the Forest Service guy yesterday afternoon, we
decided to get up earlier than normal, break camp a little early and
get hiking. It also made sense as last night the temperature did not
drop all that much, meaning it was going to be warmer starting in the
morning. The earlier, the better.

I am kind of methodical in packing up each morning, especially when
just starting on a hike. I don’t have a routine down yet. So I was
up in the dark, packing up and boiling some water for coffee. Jess
was up shortly after and packing up also. With the others still
sleeping we moved slow and quiet.

Not a stellar performance, but we were on the trail at 7:50AM, which
was before 8, my goal for the morning. We left and all the others
that camped in the same area were just getting up, but they were all
thru-hiking so I assume pack up more efficiently and definitely hike
faster too.

Since we did not get our morning chit-chat in, we did so on the trail
as we hiked. I was laughing as Jess described the banter between the
two older guys that were camped just about 20 feet from her tent. I
did not hear anything, as I wear hearing aids and they come out at
night. But she was telling me that as they got ready to retire for
the night, they were talking and one guy started playing music on his
phone. His buddy in the tent started telling him he loved the music
he was playing and they discussed all the bands and artists they
liked. In short, Jess said it was quite a display of “bromance”
and at first she wondered if they were going to continue on into the
night. She said that in the end it was cute since they said “good
night” to one-another about 5 times, but eventually went to sleep.

The climb up the side of Glade Mountain was not bad and after that it
was basically downhill to Atkins, where the trail crosses under RT
81.

About 9:50AM we reached Chatfield Shelter and took a break. It was
packs off and feet up. It was not even 10:00 yet and getting hot
already.. The humidity was starting to climb and the trail following
a creek for a while, adding to the moisture in the air I assume. As we relaxed
three young girls came hiking in and took a break also. We talked
with them and soon after one of the guys we camped with came by and
soon after the other one came by. They commented that one of them was
good on up-hills and the other good on down-hills, which proved true
in this case. 

We continued on and stopped at an old school house, where our two
friends from the night before had gotten back together and were
heading out. The stop was to put on some sun screen, as we were now
heading into pastures that dot the trail and the sun was in full
bloom. Also a group of 4 young guys came in a took a break also. It
was nice to talk with them as they seemed happy hiking and were very
polite.

At 11:50AM we reached the Holston River and Jess stopped to check a
“hot spot” on her foot to make sure it was not the start to a
blister. That turned out negative and we plodded on through the
fields and small patches of woods until shortly after Noon we came
out on the road in Atkins. The heat was getting to us, so we had
decided to stop and have lunch at The Barn Restaurant. The three
girls that we run into at Chatfield Shelter were at the table next to
us and had quite a bit of food between them. We talked a little with
them and got menu recommendations, although the quantities had to be
tempered. I remember in 2016 on my first section, being out long
enough to be able to polish off more food than normal, but that is
not the case now. They not only finished off all their food, but then
all ordered a big piece of chocolate cake. Definitely “hiker
hunger” in display. The place was jumping now with hikers and then a
huge family gathering descended with hit the place. One of the
waitresses said they were overwhelmed and I could see why.

We left The Barn about 1:45PM and hit the Sunoco station across the
street for some water and a few other necessities and were on our way
out of Atkins. Passing under RT 81, we entered a cow pasture and then
back into the woods, along with the traffic noise from 81 for most of
the afternoon.

The hiking was slow due to temperature and we are not in good hiking
shape. As we discussed our camping options ahead, it was apparent
that they were limited along with water sources. As we hiked, several
groups passed us and made us start thinking that any campsites ahead
could be full. Just before we got to Davis Hollow, we were crossing
a pasture and looked back. You could see the “controlled burn”
going on back where we had hiked from in the morning.

Several people commented to us about the heat as they passed us and
how the rocky trail in the last few days kind of beat them up. So we
did not feel too sorry for ourselves as even the thru-hikers were
having some problems. We reached Davis Hollow and looked at the camp
sites there. They would have been ok for a hammock but not great for
a tent. It was also kind of early, so we decided to pack a bunch of
water and look for a place to camp along the trail. We knew that AWOL
had a spot marked for camping with water ahead at a place called
Davis Path, but thought if we found something before that, we would
stop. As we topped out on the last climb, we found a spot just to
left of the trail, and decided to stop short of Davis Path campsite.

We were pretty tired and had covered a good amount of distance (for
us) already. We set up and relaxed some before making dinner. Once
that was done, the sun was still beating down and it was too hot to
turn in, so we just yakked for about 45 minutes before heading to
bed. Jess made a comment that there was ash on the fly of her tent,
which seemed kind of impossible. Then as I laid down, I could smell
the smoke for about an hour or so. Although I thought we were too far
away, I guess I was wrong.

The night started, clear, calm and warm.","Glade Mountain Road
",Unamed campsite,"Apr 30, Tue",9.90
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613142,"Last
spring when Jess hiked with me, we covered about 50 miles. The
weather was significantly different in that the temperatures other
than day one last spring were much cooler and overcast. So my idea
this time was to try and cover about 55 miles which would have us
start at Dickey Gap and end at VA 623 where we could get a shuttle
back to the car at the hostel. This was going to entail averaging
about 1 more mile per day, which on paper seemed feasible.

However,
since starting, we were finding that getting close to 10-11 miles a
day was not as easy as I anticipated. I am not sure if was just the
heat or a combination of the poor footing at the start and the heat.
Bottomline, is we were going to get 9-10 miles per day and be rolling
into camp pretty beat. Looking at the distance we were covering and
the fact that Jess only had about 5 solid days we could be hiking
(traveling back/forth from NY had to be factored in), we had discussed several times possibly
cutting the section short, stopping at the car and scrapping the last
17 miles north of Bear Garden hostel. I think Jess felt like we were
“shorting” my goal, but in reality the goal is to enjoy the
hiking, camping and each other’s company. We were struggling and
trying to cram in the last two days was not going to be enjoyable,
with the only result that we did what I had proposed.
So
I had made up my mind that we were going to stop at the car and if it
took is two days to get there, so be it. However I did not tell Jess my
decision right away.
We
actually got started hiking at 7:40AM, knowing it was going to be hot
again today and would be earlier than the previous days. The night
temps just were not dropping as I mentioned before.
As
we started hiking, the trail was starting out a lot less rocky than
previous days, and I was hoping that would continue. The first
section was just a long series of short ups/downs interspersed with
ridge walking. It was nice and of course since it was morning, we
felt awesome. We knew there was a climb over Walker Mountain, but we
would enjoy the trail in front of us for the time being.
The
trail bottoms out at the intersection with the Crawfish Trail and
then starts to climb. We hit here just before 11AM. As we started up,
a guy about my age came flying down the trail, southbound with a day
pack on. He said “hi” and flew by.
We
took our time going up and stopped to look to see where we were in
the climb and where the next water stop was as, we were both getting
low. Looking it over, it turns out we had water about .1 mile ahead.
While we sat for a minute, a young girl hiking solo northbound came
up. She had just resupplied and had a full bear canister strapped on
top of her pack. She said that she was struggling with the new
weight, which is always the case when you have to load up again for
3-4 days. We found out she was from Alaska and thru-hiking. Her plan
was to get to Harpers Ferry. Go home for some commitment for a month
and a half, then get to Katahdin and finish southbound. It sounded
like a great plan. We were crossing paths with her on 5/1 and she had
started 3/30. Quite a distance in that short time, so she was
covering a lot of ground. Also while we were here, the gentleman we
saw down at Crawfish Trail intersection came back up. It turns out
he, day-section hikes the AT and does out-back from various places he
can park. He said he was from Duluth MN.
We
got up and finished the short jaunt to the water, where our Alaska
friend was also getting reloaded for the next section. Jess and I
looked at the water sources coming up and they were not plentiful, so
we loaded up, not knowing if we would be camping later in the day.
Although it was intermittently cloudy, it was in the high 80’s. 
About
half way down to crossing VA 610, the trail takes a 90 degree turn.
Right here was a really sweet clearing looking out over the valley
and pastures below. It was short of our 1:15PM stop time, but there
was no way to pass this up. So, packs off, food out, feet up. We
talked rested and the I checked Guthook to see what the distance was
to Bear Garden hostel where our car was parked. It turned out we only
had 3 miles left and plenty of time, so decided to “go for the
gusto” and finish today. It was about 2:20PM when we left.
Once
down and across VA610 there were some pastures to cross, and then
back into the woods. There were no shortage of fence stiles all the
way back to the car. Since we were back down low, there was no breeze
and we really felt the heat. This made the decision to end today much
easier, as every afternoon we felt like we were getting slower with
the temperature rises.
About
a mile from finishing, we crossed VA 742 on a bridge going over the
Holston River and there farm to the left where the setting for the
house and barns was really beautiful.
After
another break of two, we finally reached VA 42, where the hostel and
car were just a short ways up the road. It was now little 4:00PM and
as we approached the hostel, Bob (the owner) appeared. We talked a
little with him, then asked if we could take a shower, which felt
absolutely awesome. He asked if we were staying, but we had decided
to get in the car and start heading back. Since we were ending early,
we decided to stop in Washington DC and stay overnight on Thursday
with my son and Jess would get to see her two nieces for a few hours
before heading back to Albany on Friday.
We
left Bear Garden shortly after 5PM and headed over to RT 81. Since it
was late, we only drove to Roanoke and got a hotel room. We headed
over to the Wasena City Tap Room and Grill for something to eat and
have one celebratory beer. It is a good place to grab something to
eat and gave us a chance to see a little of Roanoke, which looks like
a nice place.","Unamed campsite

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624390,"This will be my Fall
2019 section hike. The plan was to hike from VA 42 in Ceres to
Pearisburg. In the back of my mind being a hopeless optimist, I
thought if I could get to Pearisburg earlier than expected and
feeling saucy, I may try to slack pack starting north of Pearisburg
and heading back there. This would give me a starting point next time
further north.
I left Syracuse on
Thursday 10/10 and drove to Washington DC to stay with my oldest son
Jared and his family. On Friday morning, I left DC and traveled to
Pearisburg to Angel’s Rest hostel, where I am leaving my truck for
the week.
I arrived about
5:00PM and checked into the room I had reserved for the night. There
were a few people at the hostel and I sat and talked with a lady
named Jane, who was section hiking the trail. In this case she was
staying at the hostel and day hiking a section each day. She would
take her car to the place she wanted to stop each day and then have
the hostel shuttle her up or down the trail depending on the where
she wanted to start. She told me she had been doing this for 4 days
and on Sunday a friend of hers was coming to Pearisburg and they were
driving to Pennsylvania to section hike up there together. I had
never heard of anyone doing this, but it seemed like an interesting
approach.","

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624391,"I was having a shuttle
(Bubba) pick me up in Pearisburg and take me to Ceres. The original
time to be picked up was 8:30AM, but he texted that it would be more
towards 9:30. I was up at my normal time of about 6:00, so I decided
to walk down to a Sylvia’s Cafe in town and grab breakfast. 
When I walked in,
there were two gentlemen around my age having breakfast. I said hello
and sat down. Once I had my coffee, one of them (I found out later
his name was John) asked me if I was from around there. I told them
that I was from New York and had come down to hike some of the AT.
They both told me they had heard of the trail, but were not sure
where it was. The AT does not run right through Pearisburg (but on
the outskirts) so I guess that is possible. Anyway we talked about
various things and they got up paid and left. I was done, so I went
to the counter and wanted to pay my bill. I was told that I did not
owe anything, since John paid my bill. I was touched by his
generosity and the fact that he did not say anything as he left other
than “have a nice trip”. This is one of the things I like about
hiking, the interaction with local people in addition to the ones you
meet while hiking.
I went back to
Angel’s Rest to get ready for the shuttle. Bubba showed up about
9:15AM and we were on our way to Ceres. It was cloudy and actually
sprinkled some as we passed through Bland on the way.
He dropped me off at
10:15 and after a few adjustments, I was ready to start. As normal
when leaving a road there is only way to go - “up”. Just as I
started an young guy from New Hampshire came down and we talked for a
few minutes. He confirmed that water was an issue in this section (as
Guthook notes were mentioning) and to grab it where you can. He said
some of the hostels were leaving water caches at the road crossing
due to the lack of rain. The young guy was headed south and was doing
the Daleville to Damascus section. He told me he would probably
complete the trail in the next few years.
So at 10:30 I was
rolling and heading up. By Noon I was at Knot Maul Branch shelter and
I took a break. The sky was still overcast but there had been no
threat of rain. Everything is super dry, so they could use a little
precipitation. While taking the break I looked ahead at possible
water sources and camp spots. According to Guthook, there was a
stream just before VA 625, which the trail crosses and notes said it
was flowing. Then I looked ahead for a campsite which one showed
about 3 miles past VA 625, so my plan was to grab water and head to
the campsite. It was going to be a 11+ mile day to get to the next
shelter and a fairly tough climb, so being my first day out, I
decided to keep the first day around 8 miles.
I passed a few
sobo’s along the way, grabbed 4 liters of water at the stream and
arrived at the campsite about 3:30PM. Really too early to stop, but I
stuck to my plan and found a place to hang the hammock. As I setup a
young guy name Roadside came by and sat down. He was from New Jersey,
a sobo and was going to hold up for a friend that was behind. We
talked for about 45 minutes then he headed down, needing water and I
had told him about the stream where I pulled my from. Finally, about
5:00PM, Sunshine (the girl Roadside was waiting for) came by. She was
beat and I told her that Roadside had left about 45 minutes prior,
heading for the water source. There was also a camp site right next
to the stream, so she hoped he would stop there.

Right after she
left, I sat down and made dinner and cleaned up. It was getting dark
right after 7:00PM, so I was in the hammock, making some notes and
exiting for one last “natures call” at 7:40PM, it was totally
dark.","VA 42 - Ceres 
",Unamed campsite,"Oct 12, Sat",7.70
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624398,"Since I was
in bed early last night, I woke up about 4:15AM. After laying there
for another half hour, I got up and started methodically packing up
slowly by head lamp. This is kind of against my rules since I am
never organized enough on a section hike to actually have a packing
routine for whatever my load is for the hike. I took my time and was
finishing up shortly after 6:30, so the headlamp stayed on and I started
up the trail. Looking at the profile I had about 3 miles of climbing
ahead before reaching a ridge that would take me to the Chestnut Knob
shelter. Shortly after 7:00 it was light enough to hike so the
headlamp went away.
When I got water
yesterday, I tried to get enough to get me through dinner, breakfast
and have enough to hike to the next source or roadside cache today. I
was leaving with about 1.5 liters, which I felt was ok since the
temperatures were cool and the sky was overcast.
The first three
miles went by slow, but then you break out of the trees onto a ridge
where they actually created a mowed path. Perhaps in earlier times
this was pasture for grazing? The walking was nice up here and
occasionally you would get a view through the trees of the mountains
in the distance. Along the way there is a pond that is fed by a
spring which I checked out, but it was dry. People had noted in
Guthook that they had taken water from the pond, but I was not that
desperate at this point and the spring was dry. Eventually the mowed
path turned into a rocky old road bed that led to the grass path up
to Chestnut Knob shelter.
The shelter is
unique in that it is stone and enclosed. It was about 10:30AM when I
got there. About 100 feet from it, there is a grassy overlook that
offers what looks like a great view into the valley below. However,
the top of the mountain was under cloud cover, so the visibility was
pretty restricted. I took a break here and noted that the trail went
down to Walker Gap, where the sobo’s I passed said there was a
bottle water cache provided by a local hostel. Also there are notes
in AWOL and Guthook about a piped spring, which I did not hold much
hope out for. But I had enough water, so I headed down to check it
out.
When I got down to
Walker Gap, there was indeed a case of bottled water. But before
taking any, I walked down to the spring to check it out. As expected
the pipe was not flowing, however the spring itself was covered by
corrugated metal and had what looked like good clear water, so I
filled up two Sawyer bags to filter later. Then I went back to my
pack and took two of the bottles of water, filling my drinking
bottles and polishing off the remainder of the second bottle that
would not fit in mine. This was only my second day hiking, but it was
really nice of people to put out water because this section seems
bone-dry.
From Walker Gap the trail switchbacks up to a
rocky ridge that meanders short ups/downs for the next three miles.
Along here about 12:45PM, I stopped for lunch and a break along side
the trail. By now the sun had come out and it was getting warm. The
sun felt good, but it meant drinking more water. I started back up
at 1:20 and eventually headed down to where the trail crosses VA 623.
The AWOL guide says it is a paved road, but it looks like a wider
forest service road, and probably not used much. 
As I came to the
road crossing about 3:40PM, there was another bottled water cache and
a young guy taking a break there. We each drank a bottle of water and
chatted. He was doing a southbound 900 mile section, that would
hopefully allow him to finish the trail. He told me that he started
twice now and was taken off both times by a foot problem – I could
relate. As we talked he told me his friend had just hiked the
Northville Placid trail in the Adirondacks. Since he was from North
Carolina, that was unusual, but it caught my ear since that was the
first trail I hiked that was more than 30 miles. He also told me he
wanted to go to NY and climb Mount Marcy, which was kind of cool to
hear.
We parted ways and I hiked about 7/10’s of a mile
more and just found a spot in the woods about 100’ or so off the
trail to camp for the night. It was 4:50PM by then and since I hold
no speed records setting up, it would be getting dark in a couple of
hours so needed to get to work.
The spot was
actually really nice, it sat on top of rock outcropping with a view
of the valley below through the trees. If it was going to be real
windy, it may turn out not to be a good spot, but the weather
forecast had just mild winds for the night.
By 7:15PM, I
was all setup and cleaned up ready to “hit the hay”. I did my
normal notes of the day on my phone and fell asleep. The sky was
clear so it probably was going to get a little cool, but I prefer
that since I had sleeping gear that was good to 20F.","Unamed campsite
",Along the trail,"Oct 13, Sun",10.90
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624438,"As I saw when I
climbed in the hammock last night, it looked like it was going to be
clear. I woke up a few times - it was really clear and there was a
full moon. The moon was so bright it drowned out the stars and “lit
up” my tarp so much that I did not need a headlamp to get up during
the night.
I started stirring
about 5:00AM and repeated the process of starting to pack up by
headlamp as I did the day before. You could see the lights of the
houses through the trees in the valley below and there was a light
breeze. Diddling around packing, eating and cleaning up, I finally
left camp at about 7:15, which it was definitely light enough to
hike. The morning was cool and standing still left you a little cold,
so getting moving felt good.
I shortly passed the
cut-off for what is labeled Davis Farm campsite. It says it is a ½
mile blue blaze trail to the site and it looked down! But I am not
sure you would have a choice in this section if you wanted to tent as
the land is fairly rocky. I always think to myself that setting up a
tent at days end would probably be faster, but in this case a
hammock allows me to stay right off the trail without much regard for
the ground below.
Eventually, I
started down to Jenkins shelter which was about 4 miles from where I
camped last night. Arriving there at 9:20AM, I took the short side
trail over to the shelter and took my first break for the day. The
space around the shelter is nice for tenting and hanging a hammock.
There was supposed to be a creek where the trail bottoms out about
1/10 of mile further up, so I thought I would check that out as I
left. The shelter is close to the AT, but the side trail being all
covered by leaves was not visible. It was not a big deal, since the
main trail was just short distance from the shelter, but I thought as
I kind of bushwhacked back to the trail, if it was a longer that
could be a problem. As it was I hit the AT about a couple of hundred
feet back from where I cut-off at a small sign to get to the shelter
(does that count as extra miles?).
I did stop at the
creek and grabbed one liter of water just in case. I was going to be
crossing VA 615 and the sobo’s I was crossing paths with, said the
stream at the road was flowing. It was still cool out.
The trail climbs for
a while leaving the stream then follows a ridge for a few miles with
just short ups/downs. At about 12:30, I was dropping down to reach VA
615 and I crossed paths with a sobo from Oneonta, NY that I had met
at Angel’s Rest on Friday. He had stopped there to resupply and
camp before heading on. I had realized that I was going to cross
paths with him again once I started hiking north, but was kind of
surprised how soon that was. To put this in perspective, I had
traveled about 26 miles to that point, while he had traveled 52,
twice a far! And to top it off, I think he had to have started with a
pack that weighed between 45-50 pounds because he had loaded up with
so much food in Pearisburg. Plus he is carrying the same amount of
water we all are due to the dry water sources this Fall. You know as
a section hiker that the thru-hikers can pound out the miles but
there is some math to back it up. Anyway he mentioned a picnic table
he stopped somewhere by the road, so that sounded like a good place
for lunch.
When I got to VA 615, I stopped for lunch,
grabbed 2L of water and ate lunch. There was a nice set of campsites
on the north of the road, but no picnic table. I looked at the
profile and saw that I may have to continue on for another 7 or 8
miles to find a camp spot for the night. I had all the water I
needed. As I left the campsites, there was the picnic table! Did not
look far enough.
By now the sun had
come out and it was getting warm. The trail leaving VA 615 is up but
just gentle switchbacks. I crossed paths with a group of sobo’s as
I was headed up. Just said hello though, as I knew it was going to be
a long afternoon. Although I did catch that both the Oneonta guy and
this group mentioned a Brushy Mountain Outpost that all of them ate
at, which is right next to the trail and all said it was good.
However it closes at 4:00PM, and I was not only stopping short of
that, but it would be past 4:00. 
Just as it started
to top out to start the ridge walk that would last at least a couple
of miles, I crossed paths with two ladies from Bland who were out
walking their dogs on the Boss Trail loop. They said they did it
regularly and they must because they knew all the AT “lingo”
mentioning sobo, nobo, thru-hiker, section hiker, etc. We had a nice
short chat then I pushed on.
My destination was
going to be gravel road that would lead down to crossing Rt 52 and
Interstate 77. It was going to be a higher mileage day for me, but I
did not think camping before that would be possible.
The ridge
walking was great, then followed by some down, then up to get the
gravel road. AWOL does not name the road, but the AT Companion notes
it’s local name as Wyrick Road.
Once I hit the road,
I immediately starting looking for a spot to hang for the night. It
was not a good I was hoping, but I did find a couple of suitable
trees about 30 feet or so above the road on the south side. It was
not ideal, but I was bushed and wanted to get setup for the night and
eat. As I setup I noticed I had awesome cell connectivity, so I check
AT weather website and it said clear for the evening. So I did not
setup my tarp. Dark came fast and I was getting ready for hammock
time by headlamp. I did not think that I was on private property, as
there were no posted signs, but I was not sure, so I kept a low
profile getting to bed. I called home with my awesome cell signal,
and fell asleep the sound of the traffic below in the valley from
Interstate 77.","Along the trail
",Wyrick Road,"Oct 14, Mon",14.50
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624476,"As has been the
pattern this section, I was up about 5:00AM and packing up and
getting breakfast by headlamp. While I was doing this, I noticed a
red light above in the trees a short ways away up the hill from where
I was setup. It was on steady and I again wondered if I was on
private property. I went about my business and waited until it
started to get light before leaving to make sure I was not leaving
anything behind. It was then I noticed through the trees what the red
light was and laughed to myself – it was a cell tower which
explained my awesome connection last night!
Looking at the AWOL
guide last night I saw that the Brushy Mountain Outpost that all the
sobo’s yesterday were talking about getting something to eat at,
opened at 8:00AM. It was down at the bottom of the dirt road I was
camped on. So I dawdled a few extra minutes thinking I may hit it
lucky and be there when it opened. It was 7:25 when I left.
Walking down the
road, other than the power lines that come up the hill the view was
pretty nice looking to the north. Well I reached Rt 52 where Brushy
Mountain Outpost was located and it was only 7:40 – so not really
needing anything I hiked on. The next mile or so was on the road (VA
612 crossing over I-77) finally breaking away at a creek where I got
some water and headed back into the woods. I did notice a van in the
parking area with Georgia plates, and thought maybe someone was out
day hiking.
It was up fairly
steep climb up from VA 612 and topping out about 9:00AM, I stopped to
shed the my wind breaker that I had put on, since it started out
pretty cool this morning. Also I had to change a battery on one of my
hearing aids. As I sat and did this, all of a sudden a gentleman and
his dog appeared before my eyes. I was head down and without my “ear
boosters” so I did not even hear them come down the trail. I told
him he was “ninja” material and we talked for a few minutes as I
got ready to start again. He was from Atlanta (but originally Falls
Church VA) and told me he had hiked some of the AT in every state
that summer with his dog. He had stayed in the Helveys Mill shelter
last night and it turned out the van with GA plates in the parking
lot was his. But he really like to bike also, and had completed the
GAP/C&O Canal trail from Pittsburgh to Washington DC. That caught
my ear, because I have been talking about doing that with my wife for
a few years, but the timing never works out. But he did nothing to
dampen my desire to do the ride, as he said it was a great time.
The trail from this
point was truly a pleasure to hike. I passed the junction with the
Helveys Mill shelter cut-off at 9:49 and just enjoyed the wide,
mildly up/down path at the time. As I was hiking in this section, I
thought about the fact that other than the trail tread, when you are
in a section, much of the terrain all starts to blend together. This
was not a new revelation as I felt that when I started in 2016 and
have every subsequent trip down to do a section. But the epiphany I
had was that what enabled me being able to visualize parts of the
trail I have hiked so far, are the conversations I have with people I
cross paths with (such as the gentleman from Atlanta earlier in the
morning). I have always enjoyed talking with other hikers but it kind
of embarrassing to admit that it took almost 600 miles of hiking for
me to think about it in this way.
The day had started
cool and cloudy as it has each day on this section, then true to form
the sky cleared and the sun was out.
At 12:30PM, I stopped
a un-named campsite and had lunch. I also was getting a hot spot on
my right foot so I took a look at that. It was readily apparent what
the problem was. Thinking I was smart trying to get some extra life
out of one of the orthotics I use in my shoes, I used some duct tape
to keep it together at least for this section hike before having to
replace it when I got home. But the hiking on the tape made it
wrinkle up and that was the source of the issue. No problem, just
remove the duct tape! Well after walking on it all those miles on it,
“easier said than done”. I had to cut out what I could and leave
other pieces. Ultimately I was able to get it usable, but this duct
tape band-aid turned out not be a very good idea. Live and learn.
Before I started
back up, I looked at Guthook and saw that I would get to VA 608 by
late afternoon. The access to Lickskillet Hostel is at the road. I
had mailed my remaining food there, so I texted the owner Mongo, to
let him know I was going to be there later and would stay if it was
ok. He texted back no problem and to let him know when I was a mile
out and he would pick me up – saving me a 8/10 mile road walk.
Back hiking at 1:20,
I finally crossed the 600 mile mark on my way down to the spot where
the trail crosses VA 611. I noticed someone had put a marker in stone
along the trail, so I took a picture.
After crossing VA
611 the trail returned to it more normal state of up/down. The nice
ride was over. Eventually I hit the cut-off to Jenny Knob shelter,
but I just hiked past only having a little over a mile to VA 608
where Mongo would be waiting.
I hit VA 608 at
about 4:15PM and as I approached to road I did not see a car. But
then looking up the road I saw a pair of headlights flash and it was
Mongo who on his way down to pick me up.
We got to his
Lickskillet hostel, which is in a old church and he showed me around,
how to work the shower, etc. The church has electricity, but no
running water, which is not a big deal. It was clean and neat which
is not always the case with some of the others I have stayed.
I was the only
person staying and it was another kind of long day, so as it got dark
I called home (another great cell signal as a tower is right up the
hill from the hostel), repacked my bear container with the mailed
food and went to bed.","Wyrick Road (along the trail)
",Lickskillet Hostel,"Oct 15, Tue",13.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624484,"I checked the
weather last night before going to bed and the forecast was for rain
starting about 3:00AM and possibly lasting until mid afternoon.
However the thing that caught my eye was the predicted wind which at
times could be 30-45 mph. I don’t mind the rain, but when in my
hammock, I am not a big fan of the high winds. Not only is there the
thought of a tree or big limb falling, but even without that, the
flapping of the tarp constantly in winds like that can keep me from a
good nights sleep.
But I looked at the
guide and saw that Wapiti shelter was about a little over 13 mile
hike from where I would start, so I decided that would be my
destination for the day if the expected winds did come. I carry a
torso length inflatable pad just in case something like this happens.
Last night Mongo
told me that he had to go somewhere for the day, but he would bring
down a pot of coffee and then give me a ride back up VA 608 to the
trail.
About 4:00AM I woke
up to the sound of rain pounding the metal roof on the hostel, so
that prediction was correct, but the winds did not seem to crazy as
you could see the rain illuminated by the street light on the road
below the hostel. I went back to sleep until about 6:30, then got up
and made breakfast using the stove in the hostel. While I was eating,
a young guy named Magic came in. He said he was a friend of Mongo’s
and was going to watch the hostel today while Mongo was gone.
About 8:00AM, Mongo
came down with the coffee and the three of us sat and talked. I also
checked in with my wife, who expressed concern about the predicted
winds. I told her of my plan to stay in the shelter, but she did not
sound real convinced and suggested I stay at the hostel for the day
and start tomorrow. That thought did not really appeal to me, so I
told I would text before I left.
In the meantime,
Mongo was looking at the weather radar and showed me that the rain
band was pretty wide and it probably would be raining pretty steady
for at least the entire morning. On top of that the temperatures were
in the 40’s, so being wet in that would require one to keep moving
to stay warm. He mentioned that he could drive me up the trail and I
could slack-pack back to the hostel. I have not done that yet and am
not against the idea, but when he said it would be 14 miles or so
back, I thought that without a full pack, I should be able to cover
more than that. So I asked him if there was a longer option, and he
said the next one would be almost 20 miles. So after thinking for a
few minutes, I told him that if he could get me to the road crossing
for the longer hike and back there tomorrow to start north again, I
would do it. In the back of my mind I thought doing the slack-pack
would put me close enough to Pearisburg, that I would be able to get
back to my truck at Angels Rest tomorrow mid afternoon and possibly
do another slack-pack, the next day,to give me more mileage for this
section. All within the time frame I had allotted. 
So I called my wife
and told her what I was going to do, and we were off to where I was
going to start, hiking south back to the hostel for the day. It
rained off/on the entire trip up to Big Horse Gap where a forest
service road intersects the trail.
I hopped out of the
car at 10:00AM and was off. It was still raining so I had rain gear
on and a small day pack I borrowed from the hostel.
As I started, I
completely understood why people are willing to slack-pack. You know
that it should be easier than carrying a full pack, but it was not
until I had this comparison that I really appreciated the ability to
move so much faster without stopping. Immediately I was happy I asked
to go to the further point.
I stopped once to
get some water, but otherwise kept moving as the trail was just
rolling for about the first three miles, then it started down towards
Wapiti shelter. As I was descending, I crossed paths with a guy
probably about my age, from Quantico VA, who is section hiking the AT
in Virginia. He told me he was out for a few days and had about 140
miles to complete the state. That is a good chunk of the entire AT,
being roughly 25% of the total distance, just in Virginia.
At 12:30PM, I passed
the cut-off for Wapiti shelter and just after this sat down for a few
minutes to grab something to eat and estimate when I thought I would
be back at VA 608. At that point it looked like I would be getting a
back between 6:30-7:00PM which meant it would be getting dark. Also
that would require me to get something to eat and get to bed right
away, so I would be ready tomorrow morning for the shuttle back to
Big Horse Gap.
By now the rain had
stopped, so I took off my rain jacket but left the pants on. It still
was cool.
The rest of the day,
I was just hiking, taking very short breaks and eventually the sun
started to peek out, so off came the rain pants. I think that I took
less than a total 10 minutes for breaks the entire way back. Mongo
had told me to text him when I got to the power lines just north of
VA 608 and if he was around he would shoot up and pick me up.
The trail all the
way south the VA 606 is pretty easy hiking especially with just a day
pack. I crossed the road, and took a break at a suspension bridge
that goes over the big creek that you definitely should not count as
a water source. While I sat there a couple came down and said hello,
they had been walking on the trail a little and told me a group of
hikers had just started up, heading south. I looked at the profile
and my remaining 5-6 miles were not going to be as easy as the first
part, but I was wrapping up a long day, so that was ok. As I started
up the first climb I cross paths with a lady about my age (seems like
I say this a lot), who was section hiking north. She said had to stay
in a shelter last night alone and was not a “fan” of that, so she
was headed to Trent’s Grocery, where I guess they let you camp.
Even if she was alone she said she felt better being closer to the
road.
The day had turned
out nice – cool, sunny – perfect for hiking. I was thinking that
I could have just hiked north as I planned as the winds never picked
up as predicted.
I went on my way and
never saw the group of hikers that supposedly started up this part
just before I did, but chances are they are sobo’s and making miles
as you would expect. One thing that changed as I hiked this last part
was that the winds now started blowing. There must have been some
delay, but as I hiked up higher, they were pretty strong. 
When I reached the
power lines, I texted Mongo and he said he would be there when I got
to the road, which he was (along with Magic). It was about 6:15PM
when I got back to the hostel. They told me the winds had been
blowing all afternoon at the hostel. Maybe my decision to slack-pack
today was a good one after all.
When I went in,
there was also a guy who told me he was 76 and was section hiking the
AT with only about 500+ miles left to finish. His name was Mike and
he was from New Jersey. Watching him sort his food, I thought he may
have enough to finish the remaining 500 miles. He had mailed himself
food to the hostel as I did, but had sent too much and also had a
good amount remaining from his hike the previous days. He was kind of
concerned how much food he was packing.
I got cleaned up and
we talked as I ate dinner. Lights went out at
about 9:30PM and I think I was asleep in less than 10 minutes.","Big Horse Gap
",Lickskillet Hostel,"Oct 16, Wed",18.90
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624547,"The wind blew all
night, but I slept great because I was in the hostel. Mike and I were
up while it was still dark packing up and getting breakfast by
headlamp. Magic had stayed with us in the hostel last night too, but
was still sleeping.
Mongo came down
about 7:00AM with some coffee and then took Mike up VA 608 so he
could continue his hike southbound. When Mongo came back he ran me up
to Big Horse Gap where I started yesterday on my slack-pack headed
south. Since it was not raining he took a shorter route and I was
getting out of the car at 8:45AM.
The wind was blowing
pretty hard here with the trees swaying and it was in the high 30’s
out. It was overcast and I thought if it starts to precipitate, it
probably will be snow, which would be way better than rain. I had not
really checked the weather last night, just the mileage left to get
to Pearisburg.
I had a fleece on
under my “blaze orange” shirt and within less than 5 minutes of
hiking, I was actually shivering, so I stopped and put on my rain
jacket to block the wind. That made a difference. But I noted
normally when you leave a road you go up on the AT, which would
generate heat as you hiked. However the trail here was on a descent
and I checked Guthook quick when I put on the jacket and it was going
basically down for almost two miles to where the trail crosses Sugar
Run Road. Bummer!
The trail in this
part was starting out rocky which did not help my cause to move fast.
Also as I continued, I passed about 8 sobo’s in various states of
dress (many of them in shorts) and most of them looked miserable
since it was so cold and windy. One mentioned that all of them had
stayed at Woods Hole Hostel which is just down Sugar Run road,
accounting for the large number all so close together.
After Sugar Run
Road, the trail starts to climb and I was happy about that. But after
a couple of short sections, I soon came to notice that my legs were
dead. So although I slept well and felt ok starting out this morning,
it dawned on me that my slack-pack adventure may have taken more out
that I realized. Thus the oxymoron of going up keeping me warm, but
any incline at all being kind of a struggle. There was not much I was
going to do about it at this point.
At about 4 miles
into the day, I came to Docs Knob shelter and took a short break
here. It is an interesting shelter in that it has a deck built on the
front with a picnic table and some benches.
The trail had been
descending for a while, but now the wind had slowed down quite a bit.
Leaving Docs Knob, the trail leveled out with a nice short up/down
rhythm. As I hiked, I passed a few sobo’s that had all left
Pearisburg that morning.
At 12:30PM, I
decided to stop for lunch. Just before I stopped, I crossed paths
with two young guys who stopped to talk and told me that the hike
down to Pearisburg was pretty tame. Good to hear. The one guy was
from Slovenia (long ways from home!) and the other guy was from
Virginia Beach. The guy from VA Beach told me I must be from upstate
NY! Bingo! I asked him how he knew and he said “your accent”. I
was under the impression all my life, that we talked totally normal
and it was everyone else who had accents.
I took my time
eating lunch, hoping that my pack would feel amazingly light with all
the food I was consuming. Putting it back on, that was not the case.
As I left the small
campsite I had stopped at, the sun started coming out. Knowing I had
some elevation gain coming up, I was hoping that the 2L of water I
took from the hostel were going to be enough. I still had about 6
miles left to get to Cross Ave in Pearisburg.
The rest of the
afternoon was slow, as I noticed any incline at all. Once I was on
top, one would normally be cruising, but not me at this point. I
stopped briefly at Angels Rest (the overlook) and neglected to take a
picture, but the view was nice with the sun showing across the valley
below and some of Pearisburg. There was a young lady without any pack
leaving the rock. She told me she was from Ithaca, NY on school break
visiting a friend. 
The hike down took a
while, but eventually I got the road at 4:20PM and called Angel’s
Rest hostel to see if anyone could shuttle me back to my truck. They
told me to call when I got there, and I was not looking forward to
the prospect of walking the road back. Luckily, they were free and
came right away. The day had turned out beautiful. As I waited for
the shuttle, I thought how nice the weather this section hike had
been. They do need rain down here though.
Once back to the
hostel, I settled up my parking fee and was on my way. The thought of
doing a slack-pack the next day without some rest did not make sense.
So I was calling it a section here and hopped in my truck. I let my
son know I was headed towards his place in DC and unless I faltered,
I would drive all the way. As it turned out, I was fine until I got
about 30 minutes out of DC, then it was just a matter of negotiating
a little more traffic. I pulled into his driveway at 10:04PM. One
celebratory beer and I was headed upstairs for a shower and bed.","Big Horse Gap
",Pearisburg VA,"Oct 17, Thu",12.20
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630807,"The plan for 2020 AT section hiking back in January was to pick a
section much closer to home and shorten the spring hike, so my
daughter Jessica could still go. Then plan a longer solo hike that
would be done in the fall, probably going back to start north again
from Pearisburg. That all got scrapped when the covid-19 virus took
hold, and I spent most of the spring and summer day hiking in the
Adirondacks.
So here we are in
fall, and since I really don’t think it would be wise to travel all
the way to Virginia to hike a section, I will stay closer to home and
try to get in some miles for this year. I really did not keep up on
the status of AT hiking in the summer and I would assume that the
hostel, shuttle, etc. situation down south has been altered in some
way by the virus. Staying closer to home makes it possible for my
wife to drop me off and pick me up. Also, I was able to get 9 days of
food in my bear container, so that resolves any resupply issues. This
feat was accomplished only due to the fact that first of all I am
constantly trying to dial-in my food needs (not taking too much) and
secondly I put together all the meals from dehydrated/freeze dried
products. This makes packaging them up much more efficient.
So after some
investigation over the past month, I decided that I will attempt to
hike the first part of the Long Trail/AT starting at the south end of
the LT. The hope is to get to Rt 4 (Sherburne Pass) some days later.
This will not only count as some AT miles, but stitch together some
other sections I have already done on the LT (a Twofer!!). 
Tomorrow morning I
have arranged a ride with the household shuttle to Williamstown, MA
and will catch the Pine Cobble trail up to the start of the LT.
Looking forward to getting some backpacking in finally and
“fingers-crossed” everything goes as planned.",,View Entry,"Sep 21, Mon",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630967,"We were up by 4:30AM and had some coffee and breakfast. The plan was
to leave for Williamstown MA at 6:00 where my wife would drop me off.
But as our plans sometimes do, it went “not as planned” and we
were on the road by 6:45. The ride down was uneventful and once we
left Rt 87, it was all back roads down to Williamstown.
The weather forecast
looked really good, so that was a plus. Not much of chance for rain
for the entire week, but we all know that can change.
We arrived in
Williamstown shortly before 10:00AM at the Pine Cobble Hill trail
head. I grabbed my pack, kissed my shuttle driver and took off up the
trail. As advertised it was uphill for almost the first
mile until it flattened out just before the junction with the AT,
which comes north from North Adams MA.
There were a few
people on the Pine Cobble trail, but it was
Tuesday morning , so not too busy.
About 11:30, I
reached the AT junction and took a short break. Then it was on to the
south terminus of the Long Trail, which was a little over a mile
away. At 12:30, I was at the beginning of the Long Trail which runs
the length of Vermont, but the first 100+ miles is also the AT until
they split at Maine Junction just north of Vermont Rt 4.
Things were really
dry, an indication of the little rain the Northeast has had lately.
The first shelter on
this section was going to be Seth Warner, which I was hoping to
bypass. There was supposed to be water on the trail shortly before
the cutoff to Seth Warner, but that was dry. Not only was I trying to
get past shelter just to get in a longer day, but I had read in
Guthook comments about there being ATV activity at night around the
shelter along with some gun fire. Although no one ever mentioned any
problems, I am kind of wary of any shelters or camping spots that are
too close to a populated area.
As I came closer to
where the shelter junction was, I suddenly heard gunfire. It was the
middle of the day and it caught me by surprise. But it was
repetitive, so I assume someone was doing target practice or
something. However it cemented in my mind that I was going past Seth
Warner for sure.
Seth Warner is about
2/10’s of a mile off the trail and normally it is against my nature
to go that far off the trail for any reason other than water, which
was the case now. I hiked down and there was one young guy there who
was an AT thru hiker. He told me he had completed the AT to Boiling
Springs PA in the late spring and flopped to Katahdin. So he was
heading south to complete his hike. He told me where the water was
and headed out.
Once I loaded up on
water, I headed out myself in search of a place to camp for the
night. Along the way you cross a power line and dirt road. On the
dirt road there was a small parking area with a Jeep parked there. As
I hiked, I tried to spot a place I could hang my hammock for the
night but it just kept climbing. Just before topping out, I crossed
paths with the young guy who was in the Jeep I passed earlier. He
told me just up ahead there was small clear area with fire pit. I
got there about 4:15PM and had enough for the first day. I was able
to find two trees that would suffice and setup. After eating and
getting stuff put away, I was in the hammock at 7:15. I was beat and
it felt good to get off my feet.
Today was 5.6 AT
miles, 7.7 total with the Pine Cobble trail.","Williamstown MA
",Along the trail,"Sep 22, Tue",5.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630999,"Last night a light breeze blew most of the night and the two trees I
was strapped to swayed gently. Normally that would keep me awake, but
it was so subtle and I was tired enough that I slept the entire
night.
I had slept enough
apparently and was up at 4:50AM, starting to pack up by headlamp, not
really sure what time it would actually get light. I knew that it
would be sometime after 6, so plenty of time to pack up slow and eat.
Everything was done,
so I sent my wife a Starting/Stopping message from my gps and was
hiking by 7:10. Congdon shelter was about 5 miles away and the trail
was just rolling with some small climbs. I passed an impressive
beaver dam with quite a large pond built up behind it. Luckily the
trail goes below the dam and not over it like sometimes is the case.
While hiking along I
crossed paths with a young couple from the Catskills, who were
thru-hiking the LT SOBO. They told me about a stream ahead where I
could get water since the stream next to the shelter was dry. They
also mentioned that they had hiked the Trans Adirondack Route
(established 2013). I knew enough about the route to understand it is
was no small feat to actually hike the entire thing. It goes “blue
line in the North to blue line in the South. The term “blue line”
referring to the boundary of the Adirondack Park. Although it follows
established trails most of the way, I believe there are some parts
where some bushwhacking is needed, adding to the challenge.
I reached Congdon at
11:00, after I stopped at the stream to get water. I took a short
break and looked at the trail guide seeing that there was a place
called Harmon Hill that overlooked Bennington VT was about 2.5 miles
ahead. It looked like a good place for lunch. After a short climb the
trail just meandered up and down and I arrived at Harmon Hill about
1:30PM. As I got out my lunch a young guy came up and we talked for a
few minutes. He was on his second day of a LT NOBO thru-hike. He
mentioned that he was headed to Melville Nauheim shelter, the next
one on the trail. After he left, I looked at the Guthook notes on
that shelter and found that someone said there was a great informal
campsite just 1/10th of mile shy of the shelter. That was my goal for
the day.
As I left Harmon
Hill to descend to VT Rt 9, a couple about my age were headed south
and they told me they were doing 5 days to finish section hiking the
LT. Most of the sections north they did as day hikes and they wanted
to get it completed in one pass. The wife told me last section of the
trail down to Rt 9 was bad and she would not do it in the rain. Well
chances of rain were really small, so I was not worried about that.
Well it turns out
the descent to Rt 9 started real tame, but the last mile or so was a
monster. Almost all rock and steep. I was pretty shot when I got down
at 3:10PM or so. I gathered water, because I did not trust the
shelter to have any and headed back up the north side of Rt 9. It was
not as bad as coming down the south side, but it was none the less
more than I wanted that late in the day.
I found the campsite
mentioned in Guthook at 4:45 and it was a great one. Two beautiful
hardwood trees the perfect distance apart for my hammock and clear
ground below. This was home for the night. As I was setting up a guy
came by and asked about the shelter. I told him it was supposed to be
just ahead and as he left, he told me he dumped all his water at Rt 9
depending on the shelter to have it. That was a gamble I was not
willing to take, so I lugged 2.5L up the hill.
Did my routine and
was in the hammock by 7:15. Since I had a cell signal, I checked in
with my wife and then was asleep before 7:45.","Along the trail
",Along the trail,"Sep 23, Wed",12.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631030,"I slept in this
morning until 5:00AM! Getting up so far on this section has been a
joy. The temperatures are not dropping down at night that cold and
getting dressed in the morning has not been a “shiver fest”
trying to put on my hiking clothes. Each night has been clear so the
moon and stars are in full bloom each night, which you would think
would cool it down more, but it does not. The nights are probably
warmer because it seems each day the high is getting a little warmer
each day. 
Anyway normal drill
for the morning and was hiking by 7:10AM. My first destination was
about 1.5 miles away to a stream to get water for the day. About
half way there, the trail crosses power lines. I stopped briefly to see if I could hear them buzzing (which I noticed down south several times) in the past and suddenly the young guy I saw at Harmon Hill yesterday, appeared behind me. He was also out of water, as the shelter water source was dry. He had shared his water with the guy who dumped his back at Rt 9.The young guy (I
found out his name was Brody) was gathering water when I arrived at
the stream. As I started filtering, the older gentleman came down the
trail. He was going to eat breakfast after getting some water. We all
talked as we went about the business of gathering water and then
Brody took off. He wanted to get in a big day before having to
resupply in the next few days. I found out the other guy was a
retired pastor, who was section hiking the AT from North Adams to
Hanover (all of Vermont) and his trail name was Wolf Bear.
I saw there was
piped spring a the Goddard shelter (about 3/4 up Glastenbury
Mountain) coming up in about 6 miles, so I just got 1.5 liters of
water and was on my way. I took a break at Little Pond Mountain
summit, which was just a wooded small clear spot. Eventually Wolf
Bear caught up with me. He is taller and has longer legs, so that was
inevitable. We also were crossing paths with many LT SOBO
thru-hikers. 
I arrived at Goddard
about 1PM, just after Wolf Bear. We got water then another SOBO
(Bryce) came down from the summit of Glastenbury. We all chatted and
ate, then Wolf Bear took off. Bryce wanted to take a nap, but as I
left, I was not sure it was going to happen. A second LT SOBO came in
the shelter and was quite a “bubbly” conversationalist. I told
Bryce good luck on the nap attempt and headed up the mountain at
about 2:00PM.
It was about 10
minutes to the top where there was a fire tower and then basically
down to the Kid Gore shelter, which was my destination. Several
people has mentioned the great sunrise from Kid Gore, so that could
be something to look forward to.
I did encounter
several other hikers as I proceeded, just saying hello in passing, but did stop to have a nice chat
with a gentleman that appeared to be a few years north of my 67
years. He was section hiking the AT and explained to me how long it
took for him to figure out what a good pack load and section distance
was to keep the hiking enjoyable. This was after he asked my what I
was doing, and when I told him that I felt trying to carry 9 days of
food was a flawed decision. My pack weight was going down as I ate
food, but having to multiple liters of water all the time was not
allowing the pack to be lighter.
Right around 5:00PM
I finally got to Kid Gore. I was hoping to score a nice camp spot
like the night before, but there were none. So I talked with Wolf
Bear, who was staying in the shelter, for a few minutes and then
found two trees behind the shelter to hang on. I sat at the shelter
picnic table and cooked dinner, as other hikers came in. A
young couple, James (LT SOBO from Oregon) and Scott (AT Section hiker
from New Hampshire).
I was beat and not
moving fast, so it ended up I was getting cleaned up in the dark
(which was about 7:15PM). Again the moon and stars were out.","Along the trail
",Kid Gore shelter,"Sep 24, Thu",12.90
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631051,"I was up normal time
and trying to be a little extra quiet since I was only about 10 feet
behind the shelter, where I am sure everyone was still asleep.
When I was packed up
and ready to go, I went to the shelter to tell everyone “good
luck”.
I knew I would see
Wolf Bear and Scott again at least today sometime. James on the other
hand was headed south. I left about 7:05AM and grabbed some water
before I started, as there was a small stream just as I started
north, by some campsites. This is where the couple who came in late
yesterday to the shelter had stayed. They were leaving as I departed
the water stop and we talked a few minutes. I wished I had looked
around some yesterday when I got to Kid Gore, as there were a couple
of nice campsites. But I was too tired to venture any further than
the shelter I guess.
About 45 minutes
into hiking, Scott came up behind me and we hiked for about 2 hours
together. He wanted to get over Stratton Mountain to Stratton Pond
shelter by the end of the day, which was about a 15 mile day. But he
slowed down his pace and we had a great conversation about biking,
his job as a Fire Chief in NH, our backpacking experiences and a
bunch of other stuff. Short of the next shelter (Story Stream), he
said goodbye and took off. About 45 minutes later, I arrived at Story
Stream for a break and to get water. Scott was packing up. We talked
a couple of more minutes and he told me of a book he just read that I
may like. It was about a family the moves into the woods in the early
1900’s and how their life was there (title was We Went to the
Woods). He told me I made a comment earlier about sometimes wondering
if something you are doing is “worthwhile” and that in the book
the author spends a few paragraphs at the end of the book discussing
the concept of “worthwhile”. I am going to look this book up.
As I was getting
ready to leave the shelter, Wolf Bear came humping up the hill. We
talked a little and I left, knowing he would catch me later. Wolf
Bear was also trying to get to Stratton Pond shelter. I told him I
was not committing to getting there, since we had to climb Stratton
Mountain before descending to the pond. 
Well W-B caught me
about a couple of miles from Kelly Stand Rd, where there is a creek
just before crossing the road. We decided we would eat lunch there
and then I would decide if I was going to try and get all the way to
Stratton Pond. As we ate and got water at the creek, I decided I was
going to carry enough water to camp along the way, since getting 15
in while climbing Stratton did not seem “in the cards”. W-B and I
left right around 2PM. But shortly into the hiking he had to “make
hay” if he was going to get over Stratton. So we said goodbye and
he took off.
The climb was not
super steep, but as each day has been so far, the afternoons are
tough especially when lugging water for miles. I crossed paths a
couple of LT SOBO’s on the way, but otherwise it was pretty quiet.
I finally got to the
top of Stratton about 5:15. I quickly found two trees to hang on
(there were not really many options). It was below the fire tower. It
looked clear again according to AT weather, so I did not put up a
tarp. I got dinner, cleaned up and took a quick look at the
surroundings from the fire tower. Although you could see 360d, it was
hazy so taking pictures of the colorful trees would not make sense.
I was in bed by dark
and just about to call home (awesome cell signal up this high!). I
noticed some light coming through the trees and it was a guy who had
finished the climb up Stratton by headlamp. He was looking around and
then started making a strange whistling sound. So as he came closer
to where I was, I turned on my headlamp and asked him if he was
looking for someone. He said no and that is buddy was coming behind
him. Well they got up there and were trying to find a place to camp
and have a fire. There were no fire rings I saw, and I cannot imagine
they want you having a fire up on top of Stratton. After about an
hour of talking and walking around, they setup their tents. 
In the meantime I
made the call to my wife. I had informed her that I may be
terminating this section hike early. If that was the case, I needed
to be able to get to a main road where she could pick me up and know
that I could get to that road before the end of the day. There was
13.7 miles left to VT 11/30 and a portion of it downhill. I talked
with her and she was willing to come tomorrow afternoon, so I
committed to cutting it short. I told her I would contact her mid
morning to let her know an ETA for me to reach Rt 11/30. We were
familiar with the trail head there, since the original plan was for
me to meet her there half-way through the hike, and I would
resupply. This was all scrapped when I crammed 9 days of food in my
pack, which turned out to be a bad idea. There was nothing wrong
physically, but I was admitting that I was not looking forward to
banging out 12-13 miles the next 6 days to finish in time up at VT Rt
4 (Sherburne Pass), as was the plan. I was not enjoying the hike as I
have in the past. Each day there is tough time normally and that is
part of the deal, but I believe because my pack weight was not
decreasing with all the water you needed to carry, each day was not
as enjoyable as I wanted it to be. Gets back to the term
“worthwhile”.
I sacked out after
the decision and call to home, with the sound of the two guys talking
with one another from their tents.","Kid Gore shelter
",Stratton Mountain,"Sep 25, Fri",12
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631067,"While the decision
to cut this hike short was made, I still had almost 14 miles to cover
to get to the VT 11/30 by late afternoon to meet my wife. I was up
once again shortly before 5:00AM, but got packed up and ate with the
intention of getting a little earlier start than the previous days.
As it got lighter, I
noticed where the two guys who came in the dark last night ended up
camping. After the hour or so looking for a spot, they setup right
where the trail comes out on the summit, in a small clearing right
next to the caretakers cabin. They must have wanted that fire pretty
bad to spend all that time looking around.
I left the summit
about 6:25AM and headed down, hoping the spring that was identified
in Guthook about 2/10’s of a mile down, was flowing. It was and I
looked ahead to see that water was much more plentiful in this next
section than had been all the previous days. So I just got enough
water to get me about 5 miles and headed down. The descent was nice
and I felt like I was making good time, with it almost all downhill
for the first three miles. 
Once again I crossed
paths with some LT thru-hikers and finally reached the shore of
Stratton Pond about 8:40AM. I took a break, texted my wife that I was
on a good schedule to meet her in the afternoon and chatted with a
young guy from Rockland County that was doing a LT SOBO thru-hike. He
was familiar with the Adirondacks and spoke highly of the Pharoah
Lakes wilderness in the eastern side of the park. I will have to
check that out.
Back on the trail, I
planned to stop at the Winhall River to get water. Each day it seemed
like it was getting warmer earlier and by 10:00AM it was fairly warm.
I am going to guess it was in the low 70’s, which is nice for
sitting around, but a little too warm for me, when hiking. The one
thing I was certain is that over the past few days, I was not
drinking enough water for the temperatures mostly because it was scarce and I was not willing to carry anymore that I had been.
Once I got water, I
took a peek ahead to see where a good lunch spot was and noticed that
about 4 miles ahead was a spot called Prospect Rock, that supposedly
overlooked Manchester Center. I was thinking that I would get there
about 1PM, which is a good lunch time and left me plenty of time to
get to Rt 11/30 by late afternoon. However the trail dumps out on a
dirt road for what I am guessing was about a mile. So the pace was
much quicker than in the woods and I arrived at Prospect Rock about
12:30PM. I sat and ate lunch in the trees about 50 feet from the
overlook. The rock had many day- hikers all coming up and snapping
pictures. As I ate a family of mom, dad and three girls came up,
looked over the view and then sat about 30 feet from me to also eat
lunch.
As is normal when
there are lots of day hikers along a part of the trail, you will get
questions that range from people that seem to know something about
backpacking and the AT and others that have no clue what you are up
to. They are always fun to talk to and interested in what you are
doing.
I finished up, took
a quick look at the view and headed out. Although the trail today has
been the easiest section so far, I think I am residually tired from
the past 4 days and it is still harder that I want it to be. I
stopped to check my progress because I told my wife I would be at the
trail head at 5:00PM and not only did not want to be late, but also
not super early. As I was checking my mileage left, the family that
ate near me at lunch came by. They were in search of Spruce Peak to
hopefully get another shot at the leaves. I was ahead of schedule and
took a break at the cutoff to Spruce Peak shelter. As I sat there a
first the family looking for Spruce Peak came back. The two older
girls were first and I asked them how the view was. Apparently they
did not find it and they just had that “I can’t believe Mom and
Dad are having us do this” look on their faces and rolling their
eyes. Shortly after the youngest girl along with Mom and Dad came by,
saying they did not find the peak. I had to laugh. We have seen the
same faces and eye rolls at times (years ago) on our four kids, as we
failed to get somewhere when hiking with them. Then a husband and
wife came out of the cut-off and told me they had been to the shelter
for lunch. I followed them up the trail for awhile until they stopped
at Spruce Peak and I continued on.
I finally reached to
trail head at 4:20PM and let my wife know that I was there. She was
driving and would be there in the next hour. It felt good to sit down
and know that I only had to put the pack in the car.
She arrived at 5:15
with some cold pizza and few oranges. I was glad I made the decision
I did. The ride home was all on back roads, save for a short section
on Rt 87. We arrived back at the house somewhere between 7:30 and
8:00. The first order of business was a shower. It felt great!","Stratton Mountain

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631068,"Well one thing is for sure, with all the backpacking I have done,
there are still things to learn!
 This last section hike proved my
enthusiasm overrides my common sense. As my wife tells me, “you are
not 20 years old anymore”, the choice to try and hoof 9 days of
food was not a good one. While I was trying to minimize the travel
needed to support this section hike and not have to stop for any
re-supply, it was not a good decision. I really believe that I could
have continued on and finished the section as planned, but I was not
enjoying it. There are times you need to admit you were wrong and act
accordingly, and this was one of those times.
As I continue this
section hiking of the AT, I will have to keep this experience in mind
when planning the next one. I guess the term “live and learn”
applies here.",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Fri",0
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644741,"After Labor day, I wanted to try and get a short section hike in
before all the leaves were gone, so decided to complete the section I
started last year and did not finish. I still am not wild about the
idea of traveling south to continue on from Pearisburg, with the
covid virus still around, and hiking in Vermont allows my wife to
drop me off and pick me up. No resupply or shuttles needed.
We left the house
about 7:00AM and were at the VT Rt 11/30 trail head (Bromley) at 9:40
and I was hiking by 9:50.
I only took one
liter of water and only 2 miles into the hike, had to stop at Bromley
shelter to get water. This was a mistake. I should have looked closer
at the trail map, as the shelter is a little off the main trail and
the water was even further down the hill. It was probably around
11:00 and there were two people still in the shelter in their
sleeping bags and it was not raining. They pointed me in the
direction of the water. 
Right after leaving
the shelter, I came across a guy from Long Island, with a day pack
on. He and his wife (who was ahead of him) were staying at a local
B&B and were out to hike Bromley for the day. He told me that he
would like to try backpacking, but did not know anyone to go with and
did not have the confidence to try by himself. I suggested he look up
a local outdoor organization (like the Adirondack or Green Mountain
Club) and see if they may have backpack trips for those just starting
out.
He took off as it
was a rule of his wife’s that he not get more than 15 minutes
behind. He was a runner so he took off way faster than I was hiking. 
As I got out of the
woods and close to the top of Bromley, the man and his wife were on
the way down. I asked her if he made it back in time and she smiled
and said he did (then told me the 15 minute rule). 
The top of Bromley
was socked in and there was nothing to see, so I just crossed the top
and started back down headed to Peru Peak shelter hopefully. As I
hiked, I crossed paths with several SOBO LT thru hikers. One guy I
stopped to talk with actually was from Syracuse, and worked there in
one of the local hospitals. Shortly after I crossed paths with a
young girl and her dog named Kristen. I learned her name because she
told me she dropped her rain jacket and could I let her know if I
found it (she gave me her cell number). 
Shortly after
leaving Kristen, I passed a young couple who told me that they had
found the rain jacket and left it hanging at the Mad Tom Notch Road
crossing. When I got there, I took a break and had a cell signal, so
texted Kristen as to the location of her jacket.
Later I crossed
paths with a group of women (I estimate at least 15) that were hiking
together. I think they ranged in age from around Jess (my daughters
age) to at least my age if not older. Quite and impressive “conga
line”!
I finally got to
Peru Peak shelter about 4:50PM and immediately found a place to hang
my hammock and then ate dinner. At this point I was the only one
there.
As I was cleaning up
it started to sprinkle and a young guy came down. We chatted for a
few minutes but I wanted to finish putting stuff away and he told me
he was starving and wanted to eat.
The wind kicked up
and it continued to drizzle as I fell asleep.","Bromley trail head (Rt. 11/30)
",Peru Peak shelter,"Sep 23, Thu",10.10
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644743,"Well it ended up raining all night and continued right through
breakfast. My tarp held up well, but everything was super damp. I
took my time packing up, knowing that I started a little later
yesterday and was able to cover 10 miles. My goal for today was the
Little Rock Pond shelter area, which was also about 10 miles, hence
my slow pace. I was also hoping it would stop raining.
I got everything
packed up and went over to the shelter. There was another guy who
stayed there with the first guy I chatted with the previous evening.
We discussed the weather and the newest guy was all packed and
heading out. He told us he had chucked his rain coat a few days
before. With being wet and the temperatures in the 50-60’s, I was
not sure that was a great idea, but I kept my opinion to myself. In
the meantime I introduced myself to the young man who came in first
and it turns out his name was Dylan and he was a photographer.
I took off with my
pack cover on about 9:25 and soon had the rain coat portion of it on
too (it is an all in one thing called a Packa). I crossed paths with
a LT SOBO chatted a minute, and Dylan came cruising by.
Shortly after that
the trail started to climb and all at once turned into a rock face
that was fairly steep. As I got to the top (which was labeled Baker
Peak), I once again found Dylan, with his camera in hand taking
pictures. I took a break and we both left about the same time, but he
continued to stop and take pictures while hiking, so I went ahead. By
this time it was clearing up and I had planned to try and get to Lost
Pond shelter for lunch. If it was still nice, the pack cover was
coming off.
The trail due to the
rain last night was muddy, but it seemed to be drying out some.
I got to Lost Pond
shelter just before 12:30 and sat to eat lunch. About 15 minutes
later, Dylan filed in and did the same. While we sat there talking, a
few other LT section hikers came in to sit for a few minutes then
they took off. In talking with Dylan, he said he wanted to get to the
RT 4 trail head by Sunday, which meant he had to cover more than the
10 miles I was doing. So as he packed up, I told him good luck,
knowing it would be the last time I probably would see him.
The weather had
broken and it was beautiful out for the afternoon. Sometime after
leaving the shelter, I dropped down to Big Branch, a beautiful creek
along the trail. I passed the Big Branch shelter and although it is
older and smaller, the setting is great, with the creek roaring
through the rock below.
Mid afternoon I
crossed USFS 10 (actually you road walk a short ways on it) and at a
parking lot it takes off back into the woods. The first part of this
looks like an old road bed and it was here I crossed paths with a
couple from Louisiana that were hiking the AT. They were really
friendly and I was totally impressed because they seemed well north
of my 68 years. They had done a flop-flop to Katahdin and were headed
SOBO, but to the actual destination, I was not clear. However they
had finished up all the southern portion of the AT before the
flip-flop.
I arrived at Little
Rock Pond shelter about 4:40, found a place to hang my hammock and
then got water for dinner. There were some LT SOBO’s also here for
the night. One guy who was from NH told me his trail name was Atlas.
The others were from Denver and two of them had done the Arizona
trail in the Spring.
Little Rock Pond
shelter is really big and has a nice porch with benches. The pond
provided drinking water and is right there, so no big walk to get
water.
In bed as the light
faded, I was happy it was not raining, and later in the evening the
moon came out and lit up the woods.","Peru Peak shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644770,"Once again the moon was out overnight and it was clear. Is is getting
cooler at night compared with the Thursday night, which is nice for
sleeping. My destination was once again only about 10 miles or so
away, so I was in no hurry to get out of camp. Atlas and the others
in his crew all left before me, but dribbled out of camp at different
times. I was packed up and hiking by 8:45. Last year at this time, I
was trying to cover 12+ miles each day and although it is only a
little over 2 more miles than I am doing now, this shorter distance
is so much more enjoyable. Also as expected, each day gets a little
easier as I adapt to hiking all day again.
My initial goal was
to get to Bully Brook (about 5 miles) to resupply on water and have
lunch. There was some climbing involved after leaving Little Rock
Pond and along the way I passed another of these rock gardens along
the trail in Vermont (people setup little cairns with the multitude
of flat rocks lying around). Shortly after that I passed the spur
trail to White Rocks which is a lookout on the spur. There was a guy
with his pack dropped and making a call, so must have been service up
here.
Anyway, right after
that it started dropping and I just kept passing day hikers who were
on their way up to White Rocks. It was Saturday and beautiful out, so
that made sense. I needed to make a sharp right off towards the
bottom to stay on the AT/LT. I caught up with an older couple that
were on their way down and we talked for a minute, then I wanted to
get by them, so they could continue at their own pace. I finally
thought to myself, man this taking a long time to get to the cut-off
and consulted Guthook. Well sure as heck, I had passed the cut-off
right when I went past the older couple and had to back track uphill.
I was not happy with myself, but it was just a little over a tenth of
mile back to where I should have turned. Shortly after getting myself
back on track, I arrived at Bully Brook, got water and sat to eat
lunch at about 12:30. As I ate, a middle aged couple came by and
were on their way to White Rocks. Then coming north, a guy about my
age came flying by. He said he was section hiking the AT and
continued on after cursing about getting a wet foot crossing the
brook.
I had about 5 miles
to finish the day, and shortly after starting back up, I crossed to
roads (one was VT Rt 140), then the climb started. Although there
have been the normal number of ups/downs you would expect on the
AT/LT, none of them have been overly hard, just long.
Once over the top,
it was just a descent to the shelter, a little less than 2 miles
away.
I got to the shelter
about 4:15 and found four older guys all in there, including the guy
who passed me at Bully Brook. Plus there were two other guys in
hammocks near the shelter. I asked about the water and found it was
right across the dirt road in front of the shelter. I looked around,
found a place to setup my hammock. As I was setting up, two young
girls with two kids came down a side trial looking for a camping
spot. The kids seemed really happy they were done for the day and as
they setup in the one tenting area near the shelter, you could hear
them talking excitedly. I am sure they were having a good time.
I went down and got
water, made dinner, got cleaned up and was in the hammock as it got
dark (around 7:30PM). It was beautiful day and I was hoping for one
more, just to keep things dry until I was headed down to Rt 4 on
Monday to finish this section.","Little Rock Pond shelter
",Minerva Hinchey shelter,"Sep 25, Sat",9.90
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644775,"Again another clear night. Other than last Thursday night at Peru
Peak shelter the weather for this section has been great. I was up
at my usual 6:00-6:15 timeframe. I went down right away and got
water. Was amazed the shelter was cleared out. Those guys never made
a sound, but then again I do not sleep with my hearing aids in.
I ate packed up and
was hiking by 8:15. This is the usual way things go, as I get more
organized as the hike progresses. But it never lasts and at the start
of the next hike I am back to square one.
The trail was just
rolling – short ups/downs. After about 30 minutes of hiking I
crossed paths with Brian – a LT SOBO thru-hiker from Boston. We
talked about 5 minutes and he seemed like a good guy. He was little
concerned with the lack of hikers he encountered and said he did not
like staying at the shelters by himself. To be fair though, this was
his first long hike and I am sure if he continues to do it, that
feeling will go away.
About 2 miles from
where I started this morning, the trail dives down into Clarendon
Gorge followed shortly after that by the crossing of VT Rt 103. The
gorge is crossed by a beefy cable bridge and the river below was low
but with the drop in elevation, still made quite a roar with the
water it was carrying.
Once I crossed 103,
it was obvious it was going to go up. Right after crossing a power
line that ran across the hill, the trail went right up a rock jumble
in a crevice between to rock outcroppings. It was steep and took
about 25 minutes to get up, but after that the normal trail returned
and was just more up. Once on top, I had a cell signal, so I called
my wife to confirm that I was going to finish tomorrow afternoon
sometime. The agreement was that I would call her (or text through my
Garmin) from the top of Killington as to when I would be down at Rt
4. After talking with her, the trail went down then right back up a
spot called Beacon Hill, which has some kind of communications tower
on it. It was right around Noon and there was nice grass patch just
past the tower, so I sat an ate lunch. The bear canister weighs
almost nothing and it feel great. I had covered between 4-5 miles so
far, so had almost 6 left to get to Governor Clement shelter, the
goal for the day. That would set me up to get over Killington and
down to Rt 4 by mid-late afternoon tomorrow.
As I was eating (off
the side of the trail) an older gentleman came from the north. I
thought he would see me, but I think was lost in thought (I
empathize because I do it all the time), beacause I said “hello”
and I startled him. He was LT SOBO and I think wanting to get his
afternoon over, so just passed by without really stopping.
The trail to the
shelter looked like just up/down, with nothing drastic in the way.
About 2 miles from the shelter, I crossed two roads near one another
and right after crossing the second one – Cold River Road – I
stopped to see where I could get water since I was out. A guy came up
behind me and he was headed to the same shelter. We hiked and talked
some, before he pulled over to check out a spur that had a view. I
continued on and got to the water source. As I filled my bottle, he
came along and said “see you at the shelter”, which is what
happened. When I arrived, I introduced myself and his name was Sean
and he lived in Western MA. He had setup his tent and I found two
trees to the side of the shelter to hang the hammock. There was a
brook about 100 feet from where I was camped which was super. Also
this shelter has a ton of space around it to tent or hang. Shortly
after a young guy came in and his name was Travis. He is section
hiking the LT and in the process of relocating from Washington DC to
Burlington VT. Since my oldest son still lives in DC, we chatted some
about the city, which he had enjoyed living in for 10+ years. Travis
ended up bunking out in the shelter.
Today was cool and
cloudy for most of the day, with the sun poking through one in a
while. Great hiking weather. As I was getting dinner ready, it
started to sprinkle, so I quick dragged everything under the tarp and
sat down and ate. It did not last long, but as is always the case,
once I finished and cleaned up, I was in the hammock relaxing.","Minerva Hinchey shelter
",Governor Clement shelter,"Sep 26, Sun",9.80
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644776,"Got up just before
6:00AM and started to pack up. For about 1/2 hour it was by headlamp,
but then light enough to see. I wanted to make sure I was on my way
by 8:00AM since about the first 4 miles were going up Killington from
the south and I told my wife I would call her for a meeting time at
the Rt 4 trail head by Noon. Sean who camped near the shelter where I
was, said he had been told it would be about 4 hours. So leaving at
8AM made it right about Noon for the top of the trail (not the peak
of Killington which is a side trail).
I was on my way just
before 8AM and it was overcast. As I hiked, it was up, but not
anything crazy. It just went steadily up. About an hour into my day,
Travis came up from behind and we talked briefly and I told him to go
ahead, as I knew I was slower. He told me Sean was just behind him at
the beginning, but Sean did not come by as I continued on. As I went
up there were a couple of spurts of rain, but nothing substantial.
While I was on my
way up I came across a trail marker that was labeled Catamount X-C
ski trail. My son in-law, Matt, told me about this last winter, as
we all X-C ski the trails in the Adirondacks. The Catamount is kind
of like a ski version of the Long Trail, which I think is pretty
cool. I snapped a picture to send to Matt later.
After a couple hours
of gaining altitude, the trail leveled off. It was just before this
section started that a young guy came by hiking SOBO and he was all
decked out in a knit hat and rain jacket, although it really was not
raining. I think I kind of worried him, as all I had was my short
sleeve t-shirt on. He said it was really windy up top and there was a
mist blowing up the west slope right over the top. He said that I
should get more clothes on soon.
It was cool, but I
like hiking when it is colder. Right at 11AM, I finally reached the
spur trail that goes to the summit of Killington. This is where I
wanted to call home and let my wife know my approximate arrival at Rt
4. This would give her enough time to get from home in Elizabethtown
to the trail head. At the spur there are several large tent platforms
and just below that is an old shelter that looks in pretty rough
shape from the outside. It was starting to sprinkle, so I went down
by the shelter to try and call. A young guy was coming up the trail
towards me, which turns out was Travis and I did not recognize him
right away since he on his rain coat with the hood up. He had been up
to the summit of Killington and was just starting to descend, so he
came back to say hello. He said it was crazy windy on top and you
could not see anything. I really had not planned on taking the spur
up anyway, but that sealed the decision. I have been on many summits
where it was wet, windy and no view so I was not adding Killington to
that list today.
Travis took off
saying he may take the Sherburne Pass trail and stop by Inn at the
Long Trail. If I was not headed home today, that sounded like a great
idea. It was now just raining steady.
I normally try and
take a break mid-day when hiking like this, but with the rain and the
fact that I told my wife I would be down at the road by 3:30PM, I did
not stop. 
The hike down was
uneventful other than I was soaking wet and getting more tired than
usual since I did not stop. I was happy this rain was on my last day.
It would have been tough to have to camp at the end of the day since
everything was so wet.
I was down at the
parking lot on Rt 4 at 3:15PM and my wife had just pulled in about 5
minutes before that. I quick through my pack in the back of the car,
got off my soaked wind shirt and teeshirt and hopped in the car where
she had a dry shirt and a couple of sandwiches waiting. It was so
nice to be off my feet and I was happy to she her.
We headed over to
Troy to my son's house to pick up a couple of things, have dinner
with them before heading up 87 back to Elizabethtown. Another few
miles in the book.","Governor Clement shelter
",US Rt 4,"Sep 27, Mon",10.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650172,"My
wife drove me from Elizabethtown to Lee this morning and dropped me
at the Jacobs Ladder AT parking lot shortly after 10:00 AM. I was on
my way by 10:20 and as always the trail goes up. It was a clear day,
with the sun out, but cooler and with a steady breeze, which was
great for starting out.
After about an hour, I was
at the top of Becket Mountain and took a short break. For the time of
the year, the trail was pretty dry, which is great for hiking now,
but you wonder what the water situation will be later this summer.
As I was hiking, I was
wondering if I would run into anyone since it was a weekday and still
early in the hiking season. Well that question was answered as soon
as I started around Finerty Pond. I came across a guy who was working
on the MA section of the AT and was day hiking from somewhere north,
where he parked, down to Rt 20, where I started.
I realized I had a late
start and since it was my first day out, I planned on making it to
the October Mountain shelter and based on the time, water
availability and how I felt, would decide to stay or hike on some
more. I had my hammock with me, so as long as I could find two trees,
anywhere could be camp.
About 3:15 PM, I arrived at
the October Mountain shelter. It was kind of early to stop and there
was water right there, but the wind was gusting pretty good. I
thought maybe staying in the shelter was a better idea and since
there was no one there, it would be quiet. This was only possible
because I had packed a sleeping pad, which I normally do not, as most
of the times shelters are pretty busy.
I relaxed, looked ahead for
tomorrow, then got setup for the night and started dinner. 
About 6:00 PM, I heard some
voices and shortly after that 4 RPI students came trudging in from
the north. They were about to start finals, they told me, and wanted
to get out overnight before having to start studying for them. They
did not have really enough clothes on, it was sunny but cool if you
were standing around. Shortly after looking around, the decided to
start a fire, which took a while, but did eventually get going.
The wind continued to gust
and I thought that it was a good idea to stay in the shelter, but was
not sure how the night was going to go. I turned in early (there was
still an hour of day light left), but I was tired and I dozed off,
with them sitting around the fire talking.","Rt 20 - Jacob's Ladder (MA)
",October Mountain shelter,"Apr 28, Thu",7.20
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650220,"Well
the fire went on until just after midnight, but I would have not
known that but for the brief rustling that went on as they came into
the lean-to. I got up as it got light out, and tried to be as quiet as
possible while I ate and packed. My thermometer said it went down to
28F overnight and being on a pad and quilt in the shelter, I was not
super warm. As I packed up, I decided that I would use the hammock
the remaining nights.
I
got hiking about 7:10 AM. It was clear and sunny, but cool. At the
base of Warmer Hill, I crossed paths with gentleman probably around
my age, who was out walking. We talked for a few minutes and he told
me that coming back down the hill, he say a bear and it immediately
climbed a tree and stared at him. I moved on, hoping to see the bear,
but it was long gone.
At
the top of Warmer Hill, the view is nice, so I took my first break
about 10:30 AM. I had a cell signal, so I checked in at home and sat
for about 20 minutes.
The
day continued to be sunny and clear and the winds had died down quite
a bit, except when I was up on top of a mountain or ridge. Overall
the trail was dry and the footing was good. The next couple hours
were uneventful and I passed the cut-off for the Kay Wood Shelter at
12:30 PM.

The trail was going to cross
Barton Brook right after crossing a road shortly, so I decided to
stop there for lunch, look at what was ahead and gather what water I
thought I would need. Dalton MA was coming up and since I was not
going to stay in town, I had to get to the other side before stopping
for the day. Looking at the water sources in the Farout app, it
looked like it was going
to make it too long of a day to get to the next documented water
source. So I decided to pack up a few liters, which would allow me to
stop anywhere on the other side of Dalton and have dinner/breakfast
water.
I
hoofed it over Day Mountain, where I crossed paths with a girl who
was walking her dog. We spoke for a minute and as I left, I realized
she had an accent very similar to a friend of ours, Maryann. This
dropped me down into Dalton at 2:30 PM, where I started through the
town, but spied a Cumberland Farms store in the middle of town. I
stopped, took a break and bought a soda. I don’t drink soda any
other time, but it does taste really good when hiking.
It
took a while to get through Dalton, but the trail enters the woods at
small parking area, where there were about 10 cars of local people
out on the various trails, of which the AT was one.
I
wanted to get up the AT far enough out of town, so that I did not
have a bunch of local walkers streaming by. Right around 4:00 PM, I
starting looking for two trees that could accommodate my hammock,
which after some
wandering off the trail, I did.
Both
days so far were sunny and cool, so while hiking I am warm, but
shortly after stopping I am putting on an insulated jacket. As I set
up an guy walked by with a day pack and his dog, but was too far away
to say anything, and I thought maybe I stopped too soon out of town.
However he was the only person I saw the rest of day/evening.
I
ate, cleaned up and was in the hammock by 7:30 PM.","October Mountain shelter
",Along the trail,"Apr 29, Fri",13.60
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650326,"Last night was calm, cold and
clear. It was 29F when I got up as the sun starting coming up.
I
was a little slower getting packed up this morning and noticed that I
was not as hydrated as I would have like to be when starting out. I
did not have a lot of water left since I had to carry what I did have
from Barton Creek yesterday afternoon. I
looked ahead and saw there was water supposedly a couple of miles
ahead, so I would stop there. I was
on my way by 7:45 AM. 
As
I started, all of a sudden a guy came flying up behind me. He had
just started that morning in Dalton and was headed to just into
Vermont tomorrow to
finish. His name was
George and he was also section hiking the MA part of the AT. His
goal was to
get to Mark Noepel
shelter for the night and get up early and catch
the sunrise on Greylock the following morning. With the weather
forecast, it sounded like a good plan. I
was hoping to get that far also today, but did not say anything.
It
was only in the 30’s as I started and sweating was not a issue.
Seeing that there was a water source at the Crystal Mountain
campsite, which was 3 miles ahead of where I camped – I bypassed
the first source and continued on, which was a little bit of a gamble
since I was kind of dehydrated starting out this morning.
Luckily
when I arrived at the campsite about
9:30 AM, the stream was
flowing and I gathered enough water to get me to where
I would camp for the night, knowing I would only camp where there was
a good water source. Skimping on water for me does not work. Also the
trail goes through
Cheshire and
I was hoping that there
may be a store to stop at again, like in Dalton yesterday.
After
Crystal Mountain, the trail drops to Gore Pond, then back up until
you get to Cheshire Cobbles where you have a view of a reservoir. I
met several people doing day hikes up
to the Cobbles,
including a couple a little older than me. They were from the area
did a good job talking it
up, almost like a public
service announcement. Before getting all the
way down into Cheshire, I took a break and ate lunch about
12:30 PM.
The
walk through Cheshire was uneventful, although
the pavement is kind of hard on your feel, I do appreciate the stable
footing for a short while. I
was getting close to leaving did not see any stores, which was kind
of bummer. But you cross North Street as you leave town (after
passing the school), just a short walk down North
Street was a brand new
Dollar General and a Sunoco. I bee-lined for
the Sunoco.
I put my pack down right next to another pack sitting there outside,
thinking George was inside. I grabbed a soda and noticed the pack
belonged to another hiker who was sitting taking a break.
I
drank the soda and was on my way. It was going to be a push, but I
decided to try and make it to Mark Noepel shelter, which was about 5
more miles. The rest of
the day was trudge fest, with the last half mile being up-up-up. I
finally got to the shelter about 5:00PM and immediately went about
looking for a hammock spot, which was not easy since the shelter is
on a hillside. There were a couple of middle aged guys from
Springfield MA, setting up tents on platforms.
Once
setup, I went over to the shelter to make dinner. There were the
Springfield guys and three-some of young guys and a dad with his
young daughter all around the picnic table talking and eating. As
people were drifting away, the dad and his daughter who were staying
in the shelter, were cleaning up and I remembered he said he was from
Albany. So I took a whack at it and asked him where in Albany he
lived, because my daughter lived there for several years until they
recently located to the suburbs. It turned out, not only did he live
right in the same neighborhood as my daughter, but he actually knew
her, as this kids all attended the same elementary school. We both
got a kick out of this and talked awhile longer until it started to
get cold and time for bed.","Along the trail
",Mark Noepel shelter,"Apr 30, Sat",11.90
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650381,"Not as cold overnight, temperature was about 34F when I got up. I
packed up, ate, gathered some more water and was on my way at 7:45
AM. Depending on how today went, this would be my last day for this
section or I would decide to hike one more day. 
My hope for this section was to get to
spot on the AT where the Pine Cobble trail intersects from the
southwest (starts down in Williamstown). I took the Pine Cobble trail
a few sections ago to access the first part of the AT in Vermont.
Getting to there would stitch together the Lee MA to Killington VT
part of the AT for me. However, I was not sure what effort was going
to be needed for Greylock (which was coming up) and also the fact
that to get to the Pine Cobble intersection it was going to be a
little over 12 miles. Once there it would be 2+ mile descent to
Williamstown, so that my wife could pick me up. That would make this
my longest day with a significant climb from MA Rt 2 in Williamstown
to get to the trail intersection, late in the day. I have to admit, I
do not shine late in the day on long climbs (does anyone?). However
my first task was to get back “UP” to the trail and then get over
Saddle Ball Mountain, it was a struggle! As I made my way up, the guy
I saw the day before in the Sunoco came up behind me. He told me that
he noticed me getting a soda there and we talked for a few minutes.
It turns out this is his second thru-hike (first one in 2019) and he
was flip-flopping this time, but I am not sure the starting point
this time was Harpers Ferry. His trail name was Jaws (as jaw of life
tool) and he is a retired paramedic from Florida. He was moving
faster than me, so I told him to proceed.
Once over the first mountain, it was
much better and as I hiked the ridge that gets you to the base of
Greylock. I came upon Jaws again, he was cameling up at a stream
next to the trail. We both commented on how we hate to carry much
water, but it seems like this is becoming more necessary every year.
Jaws took off and I finally reached a small parking that is for
people who drive up the road to the base to day hike Greylock. I took
as short break and headed up. Actually going up Greylock was not bad
at all (compared to starting this morning). When I got to the top at
10:45 AM, there was Jaws once again, and he was talking on the phone
as there was a cell signal. I took another short break and knew that
it was basically downhill all the way to Williamstown, a little over
6 miles away, then almost 3 miles to the Pine Cobble intersection.
I called my wife and told her that I
wanted to see how I did getting down to Williamstown and if I felt
good, I would try and get up to the Pine Cobble trail and down.
Shortly after 11:00 AM, Jaws and I
started down off of Greylock. He was headed to the next shelter for
the night. The drop off of Greylock going north is fairly steep but
footing was good. Jaws was “off to the races” as soon as it
flatten out and I never saw him again.
As advertised the trail just keeps
basically dropping, with a couple of small climbs in between. The
second one is call Mt. Williams and I took a break there to eat
lunch. As I sat down, I noticed by right big toe as not real happy.
This started yesterday, but with all this downhill, it was getting
real sore. I looked at the map again and decided right then, with all
the remaining downhill, it would be stupid to try and go down the
Pine Cobble trail later today (which is a 2+ mile drop basically). So
I called my wife and told he I was stopping in Williamstown on MA 2,
where there was a small AT parking lot.
She agreed to come and that was it.
Settled. As I ate, a couple day hiking from Newburyport MA came up
and sat for a while. We talked and it turned out the husband went to
Syracuse University about 20 years after I had graduated. They left
and a young guy from Pittsfield who is grad student at SUNY Albany
came up. He seemed super happy to be out hiking and we talked about
getting outdoors, hiking alone and backpacking, for about 20 minutes.
I told him I needed to get on my way and down I went.
It started down and right away I felt
stopping today was the right decision. Even if I stayed overnight, it
was not going to recover enough after today to make descending the
Pine Cobble trail any easier. Once I passed the cut-off to the Money
Brook trail, there was a short climb the Mt Prospect ledge. Once over
that I passed several groups of people day hiking up to that spot. It
was sunny, probably over 70F and they were all in shorts and
tee-shirts.
It was fairly steep for a while, then
the grade for the last 2 miles or so eases off and would have been a
pleasant walk, other than for my right toe. I arrived in
Williamstown for the short road walk to MA 2, then down the street to
the parking lot to the east. I arrived right about 4:20 PM and about
5 minutes later the Etown shuttle arrived and I was on my way back
home.","Mark Noepel shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658571,"I wanted to get in a section this Fall
and dithered about whether I would go back and finish Massachusetts
or do the remaining section of Vermont. Vermont won. 

We got a late start out from home in
Elizabethtown and arrived at the trail head on US 4 – about 8 miles
east of Rutland about 12:15 PM, where I needed to start. I quickly
ate a sandwich I made that morning and was off. The weather was cool,
but mostly sunny.
I knew I was not going to get that far
since I was starting late, but had no real goal other than to be able
to get water for dinner and tomorrows breakfast.
The trail meandered up and the first
place I was looking for was Maine Junction, where the AT and Long
Trail split. This short part of the Long Trail was going to mean that
I had section hiked from the southern terminus to Middlebury Gap. My
wife and I did the Middlebury Gap to Maine Junction hike back in
September 2015.
At that time I took a picture of the
Maine Junction sign and made a comment in my 2016 journal that I
hoped to see this point again later in 2016, when I attempted a
thru-hike that year. It was not to be, so this was going to be my
second time seeing the sign – only 6 years later.
Before the Sherburne Pass trail
intersection, I crossed paths with a SOBO – trailname Pilgrim
(Greg). He had been on the trail from Katahdin for 50+ days and was
trying to get to Rutland for the night.
I passed the Sherburne Pass trail intersection and
shortly after that saw a couple of guys day hiking from the Sherburne
Pass trail head. They mentioned that they were going to turn around
because it was supposed to storm later in the day between 4-5 PM. As
I hiked down approaching Gifford Woods State Park, I started thinking
that maybe it would be wise to see if they had any of the AT hiker
sites they offer available. Once I got to the park office, I was told
no one was there (I did not expect anyone to be really) and decided
after hiking a “whopping” 3.3 miles, I was going to stay and
hopefully not have to setup in the rain. I did get setup and was
getting my dinner stuff ready, and on queue, it started to sprinkle.
So under the tarp I went with all my stuff and ended up making dinner
sitting next to my hammock.
It rained about a hour, but was not
really windy, so not too bad. It is getting dark early, so I got
cleaned up and went down the trail to toss my bear container in the
woods. As I went down the trail, I noticed that another hiker had
come in and was on the last AT hiker site. I did not think he would
appreciate me tossing my food in the woods near him, so I went back
the other direction and left it.
I was in the hammock at 7 PM and it was
dark. You could hear the traffic out on the road Rt 100, but it did
not matter, I was asleep quickly.","AT / Long Trail - US 4 - East of Rutland

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658588,"Since I was asleep early (and hiked short yesterday), I woke up
wide awake at 5:30 AM. I walked down and grabbed my bear canister and
made some coffee. I was starting to pack up as it got light enough to
see without a headlamp, and the guy who was in the other hiker site
came by. We chatted for a few minutes, he was SOBO heading for
Manchester VT, where he not only lived, but was completing a
thru-hike. His NOBO section was from Springer to Manchester, then he
flopped to Maine and started south. As we spoke, he would smile and
give me a “thumbs-up”. I did not ask him his trail name, but
based on the number of times he gave me a thumbs-up, that probably
may have been it.
I got packed up and was hiking by 7:50
AM. The first place of note this morning would be Thundering Falls,
which I could hear, but did not take the time to go see. As you pass
the falls, you hike over an elaborate boardwalk that spans a low area
and leads to a small parking lot on a gravel road. There were people
already walking in to see the falls and one of them was a 76 year old
gentleman, that told me he does overnight hikes on the AT. He said he
finds a shelter or camping spot that is less than 10 miles from where
he can park his car, and then goes in overnight and hikes out the
next day. He was really interested in what type of equipment I had,
how I packed it, what I ate – everything. We talked about 20
minutes and he took several notes on his phone. He also made a
comment about my orange shirt and hat (which many people seem to do)
and I told him that I did not hunt or know when certain seasons
start/end, but that starting Labor Day I am usually in orange. Many
people who ask me say it is a great idea, but I rarely see anyone in
bright colors.
After crossing the gravel road at
Thundering Falls, there is a decent climb, which took me a while.
Once I got to the top, it rolled for a few miles, then I hit Stony
Brook shelter and had lunch. As I sat there, a super extroverted
chipmunk ran all around my feet, looking for a handout I think –
but I was not sharing. A young girl came by who was SOBO thru-hiking
(flip-flop from Harpers), she was not real talkative and looking for
the privy, of which I was no help in pointing the direction.
I grabbed water which was on the trail
about 1/10th mile past the shelter, since I was not sure where I was
going to camp and the water sources are fairly spread out. I wanted
to get 10 miles in for the day, but as I hiked along I could hear
thunder and where there was a view to the west, I could see rain
headed my way. So I stopped right about 4:00 PM, found two trees
suitable to hang the hammock near the trail, and called it a day. I
got setup and immediately sat down to make dinner, but did not get
through it before it started to rain, so back under the tarp to
finish up. It rained about 45 minutes, again without any significant
wind (which is great). I was in the hammock by 7:05 PM, beat after what is now a full day of hiking for me.","Gifford Woods State Park

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658621,"It is in the high 30’s in the morning
and I was up at 6:00 AM. Luckily just moving around eating and
packing up keeps you warm in this case. I enjoy the morning routine
of coffee and breakfast as the day starts, so it was 8:00 AM by the
time I was on the trail. The day was starting cloudy, which is ok by
me.

The trail started out pretty tame and
as I was climbing, I crossed paths with a young German guy who was
out section hiking for 3 weeks. He had spent his first few days in
NYC, so the contrast with the AT was dramatic to him.
Right after crossing Chateauguay Road
(there is a campsite right next to the road), I stopped and got
water. I only needed enough until I got to the next shelter, where I
would grab enough for overnight.
I looked ahead and decided that I would
try and hit lunch at The Lookout – a private cabin that the owners
allow hikers to stay in. I thought it would be interesting to see
what it looked like. As I was hiking it started to sprinkle and I
usually just keep hiking, but with the temperatures in the low 50’s,
I decided to put my packa on in case it kept raining, as getting wet
when in those temperatures is probably not smart.
I got to The Lookout about Noon and
after looking at the cabin, which is rather big and has a loft – I
climbed the ladder to the lookout perch, ate and watched the clouds
roll across the mountain tops. The trees were starting to change, but
are not even near peak. As I finished lunch, it started to sprinkle
again. So I packed up and started hiking again.
About 1:30 PM, I ran into a lady who
was my age. She was dressed for hiking, had a backpack on and told me
“you are the first person I have seen today”! I told her I had
not seen many people either. Then she said “can you tell me where I
am”? After gulping for a second, thinking I had a elderly person
who had wandered from home on my hands, I meekly said “on the
Appalachian Trail, heading south”. She pause and said “well I
knew that “! What see meant was where was she in regards to some
landmarks. I showed her on my phone where she was in the Far Out app
and told her The Lookout was coming up. She told me she was 76 years
old and this was her 11th thru-hike, the first coming in
1979, if I remember correctly. This hike started early August and she
was doing a normal SOBO hike this time. She wanted to get to the “C”
road and then she was going to see if she going to continue after
that. We looked at the app again and Chateauguay Rd was 4.4 miles
ahead of her. She seemed very pleased with that info and said
goodbye.
About a mile later I was at the cutoff
for Winturri shelter, where I was getting water. Just as I turned on
to the side trail, it started pouring. I got to the shelter which was
a ways off the trail, but luckily the water was right behind the
shelter. I took a good break, the rain stopped and I headed out.
It was too early to stop but I was
staring to try and see where a good place to stop for the night would
be. As I hiked, I ran into a guy who was probably around my age and
he asked if I had seen a lady earlier. I said yes and was amazed at
what she told me. He said that he tried hiking with her, but could
not keep up. He was from Florida and said he was worried about his
wife as hurricane Ian was headed their way, but she was fairly north
of where it made landfall. Still not fun for either of them, I am
sure.
I crossed the top of Ascutney Moutain
about 4:30 PM and hiked about 10 more minutes with the intention of
stopping about 1 mile from where the trail crossed VT 12. I found a
nice area, but within eye site there were some out buildings from what
looked like a farm. I was hesitant to go any further, afraid I would
end up close to other houses. So I went setup for the night there,
just over the crest of the hill, just out of site from the buildings.
Same drill and every night, and was in
the hammock by 7:00 PM. As I started to fall asleep, I hear a loud
bird call. It was totally dark, so I thought it was probably some
type of owl, but actually sounded more like a crow.","Along the trail
",Along the trail,"Sep 28, Wed",10.10
Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658662,"Well last night was interesting. I got
up around midnight to answer a nature call. As normal I had my
headlamp on and proceeded to complete my mission. As I started to sit
back down in the hammock, I usually flick the headlamp off by habit, so
bugs don’t follow me in, as I crawl back in. Well this time I caught
my headlamp on the netting of my hammock and it proceeded to launch
off my head and onto the ground somewhere, I quick tried to locate it
in the pitch dark to no avail. So I climbed back in and hoped I would
not have to get up again before it got light. Luckily, it was getting
light before I had to crawl out again and I found it in the leaf
litter.

I was 40 F, when I got up. With the headlamp fiasco it was a little later
getting on the trail, about 8:20 AM. The day was starting overcast and
cool. 
After crossing VT 12 shortly after
starting, you go up/down, crossing a couple of gravel roads and then
come to Pomfret Road. Right after crossing the road Pomfret Brook
runs, which I stopped at to get water. As got ready to filter water,
a guy came down to the creek heading SOBO and he also stopped, but to
grab something to eat and just talk. He said he was section hiking
the trail and had started this section at Mt Moosilauke and was
headed to Gifford Woods State Park. Apparently he had been hiking
with another guy (they were from Kentucky) and his buddy bailed on
him at Hanover. We sat for about 20 minutes talking as I filtered
water and then he told me he carries two cups of water at a time!
Here I was filtering two liters for the day. 
I headed up the trail and decided to
take a lunch break at the end of the climb up from Ponfret Brook.
Once back hiking for the afternoon, the trail just rolled along,
eventually descending to Cloudland Rd. The very end of this part, you
actually zig-zag down across and area that looks like a park, but I think
it was just a farm field. Anyway, I hit the road and the trail meets the road to the side of a newly installed bridge. For a few
minutes I had trouble finding the other side of the trail. Eventually
after fumbling around, and actually asking a lady who lives right
next to the tree row the trail runs along (her response was it is
over there somewhere), I found where it went, which was along the
edge of a maintained farm field. The only thing I could think of was
what maybe some marker got removed when the bridge was re done, since
the side I cam down was labeled as the AT.
The sun had come out about 2:00 PM, but
it was in the low 50’s. Perfect hiking weather. I reached Thistle
Hill shelter about 4:40 and there was no one there, and plenty of
good places for a hammock. So I went down and got water and setup for
the night.
Normal dinner and cleanup and in the
hammock right away as it was getting cool and I had limited clothes
to put on. No one here tonight, but that did not surprise me.","Along the trail

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658684,"I woke up about 5:15 AM and was a
little cold for some reason. The quilts I brought for this section
were 20°F
and had been fine so far. In fact I use them many times a year in the
spring and fall without any issues. This is not the first time this
has randomly happened on a trip, so I am starting to wonder if the
lack of calories may play a part in this occurring.
I got up because I knew moving around
would warm me up. I immediately made some coffee and that helped. It
was 39°F
on my thermometer and
since I was up early, I was a little after 7:00AM.
The sun came out and the trail was
going to be trending downhill. As I came on the first small
clearing, I looked out at what I thought was a huge lake. After I
paused for a couple of seconds, I realized it was actually fog in the
valley below. Each time I came to a similar spot, it was a different
view of the same valley with fog hovering above it. Probably running
along the White River, which I would cross later in the morning. As I
descended I was eventually in the fog and was blown away at all the
spider webs you could see through the woods because they were
highlighted by the fog. I have never seen anything like this and
realized they are probably there all the time, but basically
invisible. Also you could see all the cobwebs that cross the trail,
which I normally just plow through unseen.
I eventually got down to VT 14 for the
road walk over the White River and under Interstate 89. As I
approached the bridge over the White, there was a guy probably my age
standing next to his car waiting for someone. He asked what I was
doing, and I stopped to talk with him a few minutes. It turned out he
was a local guy who, under the trail name “Sooner or Later” had
completed a thru-hike in 2016, the same year I tried to do the same. However his result was positive and he told me he and a guy he met in 2016 were now section hiking the trail again. We had a good talk about a lot of things,
including the advantages of carrying a bear canister.
After crossing under I 89, you enter the
woods and of course head up. I needed to get water and there was a
brook coming up right after a road crossing, but I stopped just
before the top and ate lunch. Once I crossed Podunk Rd, I stopped at
the creek and got water for the rest of the day and to be able to
camp over night.
The trail climbs gradually is this
section, as you cross a few new logging roads. At the descent starts
towards Norwich, I crossed the side trail to the Happy Hills shelter.
It was only 2:00PM, so too early to stop, so I pushed on. I also
wanted to get closer to Norwich, so I could get to Hanover by mid
morning to meet my wife who was picking me up.
As I hiked I heard some loud rustling
behind me and turned around. A dog was running down the trail about
1,000 mph towards me, and applied the brakes hard about 2 feet from
me. His tail was wagging and he was really friendly. I immediately
assumed I would see an hiker or runner coming over the top of the
last hill, but instead his two wing-men (actually two more dogs) came
flying in formation down the hill. It was then I realized that I had
read a comment in the Far Out app about 3 friendly dogs ramming
around the woods earlier that day. Some other guy had run into them
and commented on how friendly and well kept they were, but no owner
in site. This had to be them. They all let me pet them once and the
“armada” was off down the trail ahead of me in perfect formation.
As I came around a bend, I heard so
barking, only to find my long-lost canine buddies all circling a tree
and yipping. As I approached, I saw a poor chipmunk they had treed
and desperately wanted to play with him. I had to stop for a few
minutes to watch the “dance”. Them circling the tree, the
chipmunk almost getting to the ground and then having to retreat.
Eventually the chipmunk found his opening and high-tailed it to an
old rock fence near the tree. Of course the canine brigade took up
residence there waiting the the next move. I left them all staring
intensely at the pile of rocks.
After leaving my four legged pals, the
trail just rolls through the woods. I had to start looking for a
place to camp short of where the trail dumps out onto the road in
Norwich. I crossed paths with a guy who was doing a SOBO thru-hike.
It seems little late to be here in Vermont and planning on getting
through the mountains down south without some serious snow storms,
but maybe he hikes big miles? He was the only person I saw since
Sooner or Later this morning.
It was a little challenging finding a
place and suddenly I started seeing out buildings again, like I did
on Wednesday. Not wanting to be too close to civilization, I finally
found an acceptable spot about 4:45 PM and stopped for the night.
Setup, ate, cleaned up and climbed in the hammock by 7:30 PM.","Thistle Hill shelter

Tom B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658685,"I was warm all night and no hurry to
get up, so I waited until it was possible to see most things without
a headlamp. It was 41°F
and overcast. I took my time eating and packing up since I
only had about 4 miles to hike and it was down most of the way. I was
meeting my wife at 11:00 AM at the Post Office in Hanover.
About half way to Elm St (Norwich)
where the trail starts the road walk to Hanover – I met
“Moonshine”, a section hike from NYC. I think he said he has done
about 900 miles of the AT so far, so a little more that I have at
this point.
I hit Elm St. at 9:00 AM and stopped to
put my hiking poles away, as I would not need them on pavement. I was
using my ULA Catalyst and it was the first time since I have owned
the pack (7 years old) that I wished that I carried the hand loops
that the pack came with. It would have been interesting to try using
them rather than my hands just swinging by my sides.
Elm St. drops quite a ways into one of
the busy streets in Norwich. You cross under Interstate 91 and then
cross the Connecticut River. This is the end of Vermont for me, which
was nice to complete. The road going into Hanover is pretty busy, but
once I got to the town, it was a mob scene. I knew it was Saturday,
but this seemed kind of over the top. I was early to Hanover, my wife
said she was running about ½ hour behind. So I was thinking maybe
find a bakery and coffee and sit and enjoy myself. Well not only was
every place mobbed, but I am not sure it was a good idea to try and
stop in somewhere with a backpack and 5+ days out from my last
shower.
So I sat across from the Post Office
and let my wife know I was there. While I waited, a young guy came up
and asked if I was thru-hiking. I told him just a section and today
was the end of that. He is a SOBO and his trail name was “Speedbump”.
He was waiting for a package at the PO, that was not there on Friday
(yesterday) and hoping it would make it to Hanover today. His hike
actually started at the Maine/Canadian border so it included a
portion of the IAT. He actually did a big chunk of the AT earlier in
the year, so his goal was to get back to Boiling Springs PA, where
his earlier hike ended before flopping North. Speedbump also
explained it was Parents Weekend at Dartmouth, hence the crowds.
My wife finally made it to Hanover
about 11:45 AM and I was happy to get out of all the commotion. We
headed down to Massachusetts, to my son’s house to celebrate my
grand-daughters birthday.
Good hike and now I have to plan on
getting back to finish Massachusetts next spring hopefully.","Along the trail
