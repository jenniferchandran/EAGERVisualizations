Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647239,I've been doing hills at our local park and have started also using my pack - half the weight of what it will be but I'm getting there.  Things are coming along.  One more week and we'll be on our way to Georgia and then I'll start hiking on the following Wednesday.,,View Entry,"Mar 07, Mon",0
Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647456,"We made it to Georgia and Amicalola State Park.  I checked in for my hike, got my hiker tag (#1391) and drove up to the lodge where we're staying tonight.   We couldn't check in yet so we climbed over 1200 steps down and back up the falls.  Good cardio workout.  Tomorrow I hit the trail and hope to make it from the Approach trail to Springer Mountain.  Time will tell.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Tue",0
Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647499,"Today was not the day I had planned.  My goal was to get to Springer Mountain but a wrong turn on the Approach Trail changed my plans.  As I was hiking I noticed I wasn't running into any other hikers.  I hiked for about 2 hours before I met some people coming the opposite direction.  Several asked if i was going to Hike Inn - ""Nope I'm going to Springer Mountain"".  A while later I noticed I wasn't seeing any of the things on my map and before I knew it, Hike Inn was in front of me.  I couldn't believe it  - I went the long way around.  I got directions from the front desk person, sat on their front patio for a quick lunch and headed out.  It had been rainy/foggy all day but I felt pretty good.....until I stopped.  I went a short way down the trail, was cold and realized my clothes were wet.  The thought of spending.the night like that in my tent was not what I wanted so back to the Inn I went and thankfully they had a room.  I was.able to finally warm up after a few hours and get my clothes dry.  Tomorrow I will hike the 4.5 miles to Springer and go to a shelter.  The weather is supposed to be much nicer.  Just glad to be warm and dry tonight.","Top of Amacalola Falls

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647633,"I was glad to be warm and dry last night.  I left the Inn around 8:30 and had a mile to get back to the Approach trail and then another 3.5 to Springer Mountain.  I got there around noon, hung around for a bit and headed for the shelter.  One mile down the trail I got to the parking lot.  There was a man there who gave me my first trail magic - a gold dollar coin.  He said to take it to Katahdin and I said I would try.  I got to the shelter and soon Tadpole (who I met at Springer) and Bill came in along with many other hikers.  It started getting dark and chilly so every headed to their tents.  I stayed in the shelter by myself.  During the night I heard coyotes and was glad they didn't come into camp.  I had a restless night and was already questioning this hike.  Tomorrow is a new day.","Len Foote Hike Inn

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647635,"This morning while getting packed up I asked Bill if he would like to hike with me - misery loves company you know.  We took off and planned on going to Hawk Mountain shelter but knew there were thunderstorms predicted for today.  We hiked for awhile and soon Beau caught up and hiked with us.  We stopped for a short break at Long Falls and headed on.  We started hearing thunder in the distance around 11:00.  The storms weren't supposed to hit until afternoon but they were early.  The temps were only in the high 40s so we didn't want to get caught in the rain.  Bill remembered a cemetery/pavilion just off trail so we decided to go there to wait out the storm and boy was that a good idea.  The storms came in and they were nasty.  It lasted quite awhile.  We decided to stay there for the night as many people had already headed to Hawk and we figured it would be packed (we found out later we were right).  It was so windy and cold and they had fairly nice restrooms there - block walls and carpeting!!!!  I decided to stay in the restroom and another hiker came in and she stayed in there also (any pot in a storm, right?).  I was so warm and dry and there was very little smell.  I thought this is great and I'm having a good time......until around 3.  It had been raining all night but had stopped.  I heard some noises and couldn't decide if it was rain drops falling on the roof or what.  I finally got up and checked my smell-proof bag and found that a mouse had chewed a small hole in the top - darned mice.  Who would have thought there would be mice in a bathroom .  I put my bag in my bear-proof bag and went back to my sleeping bag but the thought of mice around bothered me.  Another hiker, Donn stayed the the men's restroom.  He got up to smoke around 5 so I got up and visited with him for a bit.  I was trying to kill some time before the other hikers that stayed in the pavilion woke up so I could get away from the mice.  They finally got up around 7 and we packed up and left.  It certainly was an interesting day but the rain is gone and today will be better.","Stover Creek Shelter

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647638,"The rain was gone and it was going to be a beautiful day.  The terrain was fairly good for awhile but that changed after several miles.  Sassafras Mountain was calling us.  We could see it right in front of us and it didn't take long before we started up (and up and up and up).  It was really hard but we kept going.  Near the top a lady coming the opposite direction told us there was trail magic at Cooper Gap.  We couldn't miss that so on our way down the mountain I told Bill we had to hurry so we didn't miss it.  We finally got there and a man/lady had planned a vacation but decided to do Trail magic instead.  How awesome.   They had hot dogs, chips, desserts, chairs to sit on and drinks.  I had a bag of chips and a Dr. Pepper- yum.  We stayed for several minutes then headed out as we still had 2 miles to go.  Theresa joined us and the time went pretty fast as it was a great path.  We got to Justice Creek, set up our tents and hung out til time to go to bed.  It was a full group of us there.  It was windy and chilly but I was warm.  Theresa told us she was going to stay at Above the Clouds Hostel the next night and we decided we were ready for showers and clean clothesThe night was great and I had the moon as my nightlight.  Certainly nothing to complain about and I'm having a great time.","Hickory Flats cemetery

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647698,"We got up early, packed up and headed down the trail.  We only had a few miles to do to get to Gooch Gap and get a ride to the hostel.  Bill, Theresa and I headed out and had a good few hours of hiking.  The weather was cool but was to warm up in the 60s today.  When we came down the hill, what did we see but trail magic again!  The group had breakfast for us - bacon, scrambled eggs, snack cakes, drinks and chairs.  A lot of hikers were coming in and we saw several we knew.  I called the hostel for our pickup and waited and talked with other hikers.  Heather and Michael were also going to the hostel so we all loaded up.  We all showered, got our stinky clothes in to wash and waited for an amazing meal by Nimrod which didn't disappoint.  Brunswick stew and cornbread.  It was fabulous.  More visiting and meeting new hikers.  Bill, Theresa, Heather, Michael and myself decided we would hike over Blood Mountain together and get a cabin at Neel Gap as Tuesday night thunderstorms and heavy rain are in the forecast.  After we made our plans it was off to bed.  Another great day on the trail.","

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647699,"We got up and Nimrod fed us a wonderful breakfast of scrambled eggs and some sort of hash - delicious as always.  Lucky took Bill, Heather, Michael and me back to Gooch Gap and we headed down the trail.  Theresa would be coming along later.  We had a pretty nice start to the hike then we were treated to 2 mountains today - Ramrock and Big Cedar.  Both were very challenging but we got some awesome views from Preaching Rock.  We took a few pictures and moved on.  We took a small break at Woody Gap where they have picnic tables, garbage cans (we love to be able to throw away trash any chance we get) and bathrooms!  There are alot of hikers out here and most are going to the same place we are with only a limited number of tent sites.  Lance Creek is the last place you can stay on trail before going up Blood Mountain without a bear canister.  None of us have one so we must stay at Lance.  We got here about 4 and we got 5 of the last few tent sites (we saved one for Theresa). We got our things set up and before you know it she also made it.  She also told us that she now has a trail name as long as we all approved and we all said yes to her now being called Jolly Rancher.  We ate some dinner, hung our food bags, visited for awhile then off to bed.  It's only supposed to get in the 40s tonight so it should be a good night.  Tomorrow Blood Mountain will be conquered.","Above the clouds hostel

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647763,We had a great night at the campsite.  It was quiet with no wind and temps in the 40s.  My tent was set up on a small incline so I fought with sliding down to the front of my tent several times but other than that not bad.  I woke up early before everyone else so I could use a tree and it was so beautiful with the moon and stars shining so bright.  Soon everyone was stirring and then getting ready to break camp.  We got ready and started our day that began with hiking 4 miles and climbing Gaddis mountain before we started our climb up Blood.  It was slow and pretty rough but we got to the summit around 1:00.  We hung out for a bit and enjoyed the views before our decent.  We had lots of rock climbs and flat rock areas.  We knew we had the cabin reserved for the night but as always we needed to get to Neel Gap before Mountain Crossing closed so we could get our reward - pizza!!!!!  And we made it and enjoyed pizza and cold drinks.  We ate our delicious food and headed to the cabin.  The heavy rain/thunderstorms that were predicted arrived later and we were glad to be warm and dry and safe from the lightning.   Heather really struggled today with leg issues and decided she needed a break from the trail so we all decided to take a day off on Wednesday.  We will see if the cabin is available another day or we'll need to go to Blairsville to a hotel.  For now we'll get a good night's sleep.,"Lance Creek Campsite

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647767,"Evidently there was alot of thunder during the night but I didn't hear it.  I actually slept til 5:30 which is late for me, even out here.  We found out that the cabin was not available another night so we started scrambling to find a hotel room and a shuttle to town.  Right now we are in ""the bubble"" which means there are alot of hikers out here and resources are extremely hard to get sometimes so you have to plan early.  Heather found us a room and after several calls found someone to give us a ride into town.  When we opened the door when he got to the cabin how happy we were to see a LIMO!!!!  Lots of room for us and all our gear.  He drove us to the hotel and we got settled.  The other 4 went to Walmart and resupplied food for all of us for the next 4-5 days.  Then we went to Zaxbys for dinner and brought it back to the room.  Theresa's friend stopped by and visited for a bit then a couple other hikers we haven't met and they stayed quite a bit and visited.  Tomorrow is Heather and Bill's birthdays so we had cupcakes and pecan pie to celebrate.  Tomorrow we head back to the trail.","Blood Mountain cabins/Neel Gap

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647902,"Our our shuttle driver picked us up at 8:30 and we were back at Neel Gap by 9.  Heather went into Mountain Crossing to get fitted for new shoes and we were back on trail around 10.  I was ready to try and get some miles in but the others were kinda lagging behind so i just kept hiking.  I wanted to try to do about 10.5 miles to get to Low Gap Shelter.  In our first 5 miles we had Levelland and Cowrock Mountains to climb so that slowed me down.  I stopped for a quick lunch between the two and the others soon showed up.  I took off and somewhere down the trail another hiker was coming the other direction.  When we passed I saw that it was Donn - he stayed the night at the cemetery with me.  I was surprised.  He said he had stayed on top of the mountain the night before and the wind shredded his tent.  He was going back to Mountain Crossing to see if they could help him.  I continued on and at the bottom of Cowrock was Tesnatee Gap and trail magic.  King Tut and his wife had about anything you could want - grilled cheese, chips, drinks, snack cakes, foot care items, knitted caps from their church ladies, towels.  It was great.  It was already 3:00 and with Wildcat Mountain right in front of me to climb I knew I had to get going to get to a campsite for the night.  I hiked another mile or so over the mountain and it went to Hogpen Gap.  I was walking along and passed a camper in the parking lot and some guy standing there said ""do you know Subman?""  I said yes and low and behold there he was in the camper.  He thru hiked with my brother several years ago and lives in the area.  What a wonderful surprise.   We talked for a bit and I headed up the trail a short way to the campsite and set up for the night.  The others in my group came in a short time later.  I had a great day hiking and was ready for some dinner and bed.","Blairsville

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647903,"It was a windy and cold night but I stayed warm.  I got up early, got packed up.  I talked to Heather and she said the group would probably break up today as she might only hike about 4 miles.  I said my goodbyes to her and thought I would wait for the other 2.  At 9 they still weren't ready to go so I went ahead and took off.  The trail today was to be very kind and ""flattish "" compared to what we've had.  I wasn't sure where I would end up as the next shelter was over 12 miles away.  At one point I stopped for a minute and just stood there and listened to the silence - no wind, no leaves rustling,  no vehicle noise, nothing.  It was amazing.  I kept running into Bob and Clay and we talked about where we could all stay that night.  It was going to be cold and very windy so we were trying to find a place somewhat out of the wind.  A couple of miles from camp the outside of my knee started hurting.  It quit for a bit but came back.  It was very painful.  I told the guys about it and Bob said it sounds like an IT band issue.  I hobbled into camp finally and was able to set up but the pain persisted.  I knew I couldn't (or shouldn't) keep hiking like this so I called David and asked him to pick me up.  The wind that night was awful and it was cold again.  I stayed fairly warm but the noise of the wind gusts kept me awake a lot.  I was glad when that night was over.","Hogpen Gap

Janet Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647905,"The night was awful but I knew I was heading to town and David would be here today.  I had 3.5 miles to get to Unicoi Gap.  I took some Advil hoping to mask the pain in my knee but it didn't work.  The trail today was very rough  - lots of rocks, roots and boulders to climb over did not help my knee at all.  All I wanted was to get off this mountain.  I left camp at 8 and was surprised when i got to the gap around 10:30.  When I was getting close I thought I smelled a grill and I was right.  My last trail magic.  These guys were grilling hamburgers and hot dogs - yummy.  I called for a shuttle and he got me into town and to the hotel.  This isn't the way I expected my hike to end but my health is more important.   My knee still hurts but hopefully will get better over time.   Thanks for following along.","Campsite
