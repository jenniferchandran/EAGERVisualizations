Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655929,"On August 1, 2022 I headed to Kings Mountain national military Park for a short hike and equipment check. The reason I’m doing this is to prepare for a through hike of the Appalachian trail, next March.


On one hand, March seems so far away. On the other, it’ll be here in no time at all. Seven months seems like a long time to prepare for a hike; however, I’m not sure a year of preparation would really get me ready for the AT. The Appalachian Trail is 2200 miles of some of the most rugged terrain in the United States. The elevation change (up and down) over the length of the trail, is equivalent to hiking Mount Everest numerous times.


It’s an extremely difficult and grueling hike, from Springer Mountain Georgia to Mount katana in Maine. The trail covers 14 states and 2172 miles. That doesn’t include the side hikes for scenic views, hiking into town for supplies, or any other side trips one might decide to take.


So, today starts my physical preparation for the trek. Why am I undertaking such a daunting hike? To raise awareness for childhood sexual abuse. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, not even I realized the extent the problem reaches. Most people don’t know The true number of abuse victims. 


Statistics vary, but no matter which you believe, the numbers are way too high. Some studies put the number at one and five children are the victims of sexual abuse. Other studies say the number is one and 15. Both numbers are far too high.


My goal is to have people follow my expedition and for those people (you) to help make others aware of the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse. You can help by sharing this post. You can help by telling others what I’m doing and why. 


Now it’s time for me to leave the parking lot and start walking. I have no idea how far I’ll make it; five miles, two miles, ten miles. It doesn’t matter. All that matters is that I start. Once I start, I have to finish, no matter the distance. I’ll finish when I finish. I’ll go as far as I go.",,View Entry,"Aug 01, Mon",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655801,"I’m going to through-hike the Appalachian Trail. My bucket list is short. I’ve lived a full life to this point and enjoyed the ability to do most things I wanted, from hiking Kings Canyon NP west-east to summiting Mt Rainier. I’ve visited forty-nine states and more than fifteen countries on four continents. Now it’s time to tackle the beast in my back yard. I currently live in Gastonia, NC but own a house in Elk Park, less than five miles from where the AT crosses Hwy 19E near Roan Mountain, TN. At fifty-two, I’ve spend more than a few weekends on the AT, but none in more than three decades. It’s time for that to change and I want to share my journey with you. I have a very personal reason for wanting to tackle this monumental undertaking. Besides my person desire to be one of the few people to complete a through-hike, I want to use this as an opportunity to raise awareness for the survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse. I’m a survivor of Childhood Sexual Abuse and have only recently shared that with anyone besides my wife of thirty years. I’m relatively well adjusted and consider myself successful. I own a real estate investing and home renovation business and help my wife run a wildly successful sign company. But the trauma I suffered for three years has followed me and affected my life for almost four decades. This trauma affects many more people than you might believe. In sharing my story with friends and family, I have found myself surrounded by other survivors. The Young Women’s Christian Association published a study that found 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are molested or abused by age 18. Someone you know is a survivor. Someone you work with has been abused. Someone in your family has suffered through abuse. There is no one this does not affect, but few people get passed the stigma and embarrassment of being a victim of sexual abuse. It’s not something we want to talk about. The shame can follow us throughout our lives. I want to work to change that. I want to reach an audience that will share my story, in the hopes that others can understand they’re not alone and have nothing to be embarrassed about and nothing to be ashamed of. I invite you to follow my journey of self discovery and preparation for my through-hike of the AT, next March.",,View Entry,"Aug 03, Wed",0

I have trouble sleeping and sometimes have unremembered nightmare. I suffer from PTSD, as do many sexual abuse survivors. I travel with a four-legged companion that goes by the name Dogé. She is a Belgian Malinois named for the cryptocurrency Dogecoin and can always be found by my side, in my bed, or the back seat of my truck. She is more than a travel companion. She is trained to “lead” in front, “follow” behind or “walk” beside me. Service dogs are amazing animals that become far more than a companion. True service dogs are with their handlers nearly twenty-four hours a day. They are with us at home, at work and on vacation. Dogé will be with me on the Appalachian Trail. She’s is in far better shape than me and has more energy than any dog I’ve ever had. If you see us on the trail, or encounter service dogs in your day-to-day life, please remember these guys are working and petting them can lead to distraction from their job and handler. Dogé was with me this weekend while hiking at Kings Mountain National Military and State Parks.

Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655921,"I’ve listened to several books and watched numerous YouTube videos by hikers of the AT. They all talk about the physical stress, weather, equipment, stamina. A few have talked about the mental and that’s where I’m most concerned.
I’m not an Olympian or even in good shape, but I’ve got five months to get into physical condition. I’ve already dropped 20 pounds and begun walking and hiking short trails near my home in Gastonia NC. Now it’s time to think about the mental conditioning. 

As a solo hiker, my only social contacts will be online and with those I pass or that pass me on the trail. I’ll be away from family and friends for about five months, in self-imposed isolation. 

Between now and March, I’ll work toward preparing my mind for being alone. I hope you will follow me and my preparations.",,View Entry,"Aug 05, Fri",0

Belgian Malinois dogs are super high energy and not only thrive on activity, then require it. At home, she has to run, play, or fetch for at least an hour each day. She enjoys much longer periods of play. However, Malinois can over exert themselves and even have heart attacks or heat stroke. That’s because they are so focused on activity. 
I don’t have flash backs. I don’t freak out at loud noises, however I do appreciate when my dog clears a room before I enter or jumps in my lap, when she knows I’m having trouble. Service dogs are amazing animals and provide a special kind of love to their handlers. 


I hope to meet some of my followers and some people I follow, while on the AT, next year. If you see us or any working dog, please remember, the dogs are working and petting them can cause them to loose focus on their job. Dogé is very friendly and would love your attention, but that teachers her to focus on others, rather than me.",,View Entry,"Aug 06, Sat",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656024,"“Getting in shape” for the Appalachian Trail is as monumental an undertaking as hiking the trail itself. There’s not much you can do to prepare your body to hike twenty miles a day for five months. The best you can hope for is to mentally prepare for one of the hardest things you’ve ever done. At least that’s they way I look at this, for myself. 


Last week, I hike about six miles with a friend and a full pack. This week, I carried the pack for a few miles, in the woods behind my house. And today, I hiked 8-1/2 miles carrying a pack with clothes and provisions for a seven day hike; clothes, food, cook kit, etc. The pack weighs out around thirty-five pounds and includes a self-inflating sleep pad, tent and sleeping bag. They could all stand to lose some weight. 


When purchasing gear over the years, I haven’t been concerned about weight because I’ve been driving to camp sites. The sleeping bag weighs 4-5 pounds. The pad is another few pounds and the tent adds several more. 


My goal for this hike is to raise awareness for Childhood Sexual Abuse, which I survived for three years in middle school. If my pack is too heavy and I have to get off the trail after a few weeks, I won’t succeed in my goal. So I’ve got to shave some weight off my equipment. 


Today wasn’t bad and the pack weight is around 35 pounds. We hiked over eight miles and I could have gone further. If I can shave 10 pounds off my equipment, my hike will be even more enjoyable.   


My plan is to hike another day this week and again next weekend. For now, I will keep the heavy equipment in place. That will build more leg strength for when the load is less. 


Hiking the trail today, we saw several variety of mushrooms and I’ve been told they’re edible. Needless to say, I didn’t take that information at face value. I didn’t eat the mushrooms. I need a little more than the say-so of someone on Facebook. 


Has anyone out there found a good book or app for identifying edible mushrooms? If so, please let me know.",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Sun",0

Today was my longest hike so far, 8-1/2 miles. That’s half of what I need to average on the AT, in order to make my goal of five months. 


We started at the Kings Mountain National Military Park visitor center. From there we headed toward Garner Campground and Brown’s Mountain. Campground was listed as 4.1 miles and Brown’s Mountain is up a short side trail, less than a mile. 


Luckily, the day was relatively overcast and moderately cool. Of course, that’s a relative term. If you live in the mountains of North Carolina hot may be considered anything over 80°. Living in Hiking in the Gastonia area it doesn’t get hot until we’re in the 90s. I’m not sure the exact temperature while we hiked, but it was 82° when we got back to the car.
Both myself and my hiking companion have spent a lot of time in the woods. For me, it’s been decades since I spent a great deal of time hiking or camping, except when a tow-behind camper was involved. But my friend hikes regularly and much of his time is spent in this area. 
Bears are certainly not common in the foothills and piedmont region of North Carolina, but neither are they unheard of. There have been many bear encounters in this area, including over in Charlotte. Usually, these instances are so infrequent they make the news. Both of us believe it was a bear. Not much else would be capable of making such a thunderous noise as it ran away. Thankfully, that’s what it did.


Obviously, bears are some thing Alan counter on the AT. I’ve encountered them in Yellowstone and Yosemite. I’ve encountered them in a few other places but I’ve usually been in a car or safe place. Believing that’s what we saw yesterday got me thinking about likely encounters on the trail.


Of course, I’ll have the bear spray. The problem seems to be the overwhelming adrenaline rush that comes with close bear encounters. I’ve read in other trail journals and watched online videos where someone attempted to spray a bear and got the chemical on their hands and on themselves. That’s probably about what would happen to me.


I’ll keep the bear spray handy and I plan to carry a small knife. In reality, I don’t think these things will offer much true protection. I’m much better off being cautious and staying aware of my surroundings. I will only look to the spray or knife as an absolute last resort.

I own a successful home renovation business with three full time employees. Those three people depend on my company for their livelihood. If I pack up for six months and hit the trail, their income could disappear.


As I prepare for the physical strains of five months on the AT, I have to make sure my business continues to operate. Whether you own a business or work for someone else, this reality is faced by every thru-hiker. 


I haven’t solved this issue and it’s adding to the mental load of planning my hike. Before placing a date in the calendar, my biggest concerns were my knees, physical condition and my age. That has only been the tip of the iceberg. 


I started a GoFundMe page, but that money is earmarked for food an essentials on the trail. Any excess funds will be donated to a child advocacy group. 


If you read my previous posts, you know I’m a survivor of long-term childhood sexual abuse. My hike is to raise awareness for the epidemic that touches the lives of 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 7 boys by age eighteen. 


Mentally preparing to hike the Appalachian Trail is as important as the physical. In fact, it may take more work to be mentally prepared. 


I’ll be starting at Springer Mountain in Georgia and there are two ways to get there. There’s an 8-mile “approach trail” from south of the AT starting point. That’s NOT the way I plan to start. I’m going to use the other route. 


From Georgia Hwy 42, hikers can backtrack one mile south along the Appalachian Trail. There, they reach the summit of Springer Mointain and the start of the AT. This is the path I plan on using. 


Either route will reach the beginning of the trail. 
I’ve read and been told to “hike my own hike” and have always been my own person. That’s what I plan to do. I’m not an AT purist. I may Blue Blaze some trails, but I will still considered myself to have hiked the whole trail.",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Tue",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656180,"Hiking my own hike, blue blazing, and shortcuts. 


If there’s a blue blaze trail to an overlook and that blue blaze continues back to the AT, I plan to follow it. If there’s a blue blaze that’s soul purpose is to cut miles off the AT, I’ll skip it. Here’s my thoughts on the subject. 


Having hikes a few sections of the AT in (many) years past, I’m familiar with blue blazing and the purist arguments against them as short cuts. I agree, they are short cuts but only a hiker can know the truth of whether or not he or she completed the AT.


I will not back track several miles on a blue blaze trail, just to pickup an extra couple miles of the AT. That’s a personal choice. At the same time, I won’t take a blue blaze trail just to shortcut a section of the trail. I consider that cheating. 


If a side trail takes me to a scenic overlook, a shelter, a privy or something else and then continues to rejoin the trail, I may choose to continue on the blue blaze. In other words, I will blue blaze for a purpose, unless that purpose is to shortcut miles from the AT. 


I realize this practice may not be popular with some hikers and we are all free to make our own path and hike our own hike. This is a personal decision for me. 


I hope not to be judged too harshly by those that disagree. Instead, it’s my hope that readers and fellow hikers will allow me the pleasure of my own choice, without judgement.",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Tue",0

Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656379,"Why choose the Appalachian Trail instead of something shorter or a little more manageable for the first hike in nearly four decades? Why choose a hike to raise awareness for childhood sexual abuse? 


Because my abuser chose to assault me on multiple camping trips, as a pre and early teen. It started during a camping trip to Mount Mitchell State Park and continued for several years. This teacher organized many school-sponsored trips during my years at Gaston Day School. 


Hiking and camping have not held great appeal, since I was fifteen. This is what I want to take back. I used to enjoy hiking. I enjoyed camping. I loved the outdoors. Being abused in those places robbed me of my love for them. I want it back. 


I’m starting with the AT because it was a teenage dream to hike Georgia to Maine. It‘s a dream that was stolen. I’m starting with the AT because I should have done it forty years ago. 


I was in shape; football in the fall, basketball, soccer and baseball overlapped the remaining school year. I could run ten miles and hardly break a sweat. The AT wouldn’t have been easy but it would have been easier than it will be next March. I’ve added forty years and at least a pound for each one. Running ten miles now, might cause a heart attack.

I started with short walks and graduated to short hikes. Four miles became eight. Now I hope that eight can become ten, twelve and sixteen. That’s my daily goal average. By March, I want to be hiking 16-20 miles with a full pack.

Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656408,"Today, I hiked Crowders Mountain in Gastonia, NC. The last time I walked up this hill was 1986, even though its practically in my back yard, less than three miles from my house. It's a hike I used to love taking. It's less than 900 feet of elevations gain and only takes a few hours to walk up from the parking lot and back down. My love of this mountain and my love for hiking and camping was stolen from me by a teacher I loved and respected. 
This teacher molested me on trips to Crowders Mountain. He molested me on many other trips and stole my love of hiking and camping. Today was a huge step toward taking that back. It was the first time I've revisited one of the places I was molested. It's the first place I've reclaimed as ""mine"" and I refuse to allow my past to control my future. I refuse to allow my molestation to maintain its hold on my love of hiking and camping. I'm taking it all back.
The hike today was an emotional one. It was difficult to walk past places where I was molested, but it felt so good to reach the top and take in the view from the rocks. It brought back recollections that were extremely painful and joys that were long forgotten; hiking there with my mother, my friends and a teenage crush. At the same time, I feel so much hatred for the teacher and what he did. He silenced me and took my innocence and childhood.
I'm trying to take back what I lost and what I loved. That's the reason for my journey, to heal and speak out for the child he silenced. 
In the last three decades, I've suffered with bouts of depression, rage, anger and even suicide. Standing on the rocks today, above a 100 foot drop, I thought how easy it would be to step off the edge and fall. In a few seconds, it would all be over; the pain, anger, hatred, rage, sadness, depression and guilt. Guilt has weighed heavy on me since this teacher was arrested for molesting other children after me. I could have put an end to it, if I just come forward. Instead, I live with the fact that he went on to molest others, including a sweet little kid that I remember from my days at that school. That's on me.
I know it's not my fault. I know I'm not to blame. I also know it wouldn't have happened if I had spoken up and spoken out.
I'm not suicidal and don't have any desire to end my life. I have too much to live for, including my thru-hike, next March. But most of all, I have a seven year old grandson that I love with all my heart and soul. He is going to join me atop Springer Mountain and hike the first mile by my side.

Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656470,"Dogs have been domesticated longer than cattle and horses, by more than 10,000 years. While some dogs may survive in the wild, most of their natural instincts have been bred away. The modern dog is not built to survive for months on end, outdoors, much less on a strenuous hike like the AT. 


Having said that, let me qualify it by adding this; some breeds are considered “working dogs”; breeds like the German Shepherd, Alaskan Malamute, serval Retriever breeds and Belgian Malinois. There are exceptions to every rule, but it’s probably not a good idea to put a malamute or Shepherd through the stress and heat of any long distance hike. Not to mention, designer dogs, they probably had an easy life and don’t want to leave home. 


Only you can judge your dog’s ability to not only survive, but thrive and enjoy time on an extended hike. I’m sure there are poodles, jack Russell terriers, and other nonworking dogs capable of hiking and camping for long distances. I’m talking about the average here. Please don’t take offense of what I’m saying.


I have a Belgian Malinois and she’s a working dog. She is a PTSD service dog and went through very specialized training. She also “works out” every day. We either throw the ball, go hiking, or in someway wear her out. These are high maintenance, high energy dogs they require an extreme amount of exercise to remain healthy. I believe she is more than capable of handling the Appalachian Trail. But she will take some special consideration.


She has a harness for lifting. That’s the backpack she wears. She will also need boots in case it snows. She’s played in the snow plenty of times. It doesn’t bother her. However if she’s going to be in snow for 8 to 10 hours a day, she’ll need boots. It will also help when we encounter long distances of rocky terrain.
The bottom line is this, if you take your dog on the Appalachian trail or any other long distance hike, you need to be in tune to their needs and you need to hike your dogs hike. It becomes less about your abilities and more about their abilities. Dogs are great companions in the outdoors.

This was not something I expected. Six months ago, my wife was the only person that knew. Six weeks ago I shared it with a marriage counselor. Six days ago I shared my story on Facebook.


Since sharing my story publicly, I have gone on to share on my hiking blog, an Appalachian Trail Facebook group, and with total strangers who ask why I am hiking. This was never something that was planned. I thought sharing it on Facebook would be the end of it. I thought once posted I would feel cathartic and move on. that couldn’t be further from what happened.


People have been so supportive and many others have shared with me their story of abuse. I realized I need to continue sharing. I realized it would not only benefit me, but it would benefit others. I am caring with me when I hike the Appalachian Trail, a list of other survivors. I’m carrying a list of other people that have been through what I have. The list is growing every day.


I didn’t expect the outpouring of support from total strangers. I didn’t expect for others to share their stories of surviving with me. And I didn’t expect to receive such an overwhelming response. I have literally received thousands of comments, shares, and likes. It’s taking me at least an hour a day to respond to comments. And that’s using Siri to type. I have received hundreds of comments and can’t take the time to respond to each and everyone, individually. However, I do respond in someway. Even if it’s just a generic “Thank you very much for your comments”.


I feel like that’s the very least I can do to repay them for the support they’ve shown.
Sharing my story is still very much about my own healing, but has quickly become about the healing of others, also. It has become about sharing my journey of healing. No longer is it just about “going public“ about what happened to me. I realize now, just how many people have been through what I have. In helping myself, I want to help them too.


I hope that by talking about it, we can normalize the conversation and destigmatize sexual abuse. I hope that we can take some of the shame away from something where there should be none.

When I was 12 years old, on a school sponsored camping trip to Mount Mitchell State Park, I was sexually molested by my favorite teacher. He groomed me and made sure we became close, before that trip. He also made sure we shared a tent. It all started at Mount Mitchell. It continued for more than three years until finally I was expelled from school for fighting.


Are used to love hiking and camping and spending time in the woods. I was a Boy Scout and an avid camper with family and friends. After being expelled it was years before I ever thought about camping or hiking and it’s something I rarely did, until recently.


In the past few weeks I’ve hiked in Kings Mountain National Mlitary Park, Kings Mountain State Park, and Crowders Mountain State Park. The love of hiking has been reborn in me. This is the start of my healing journey to recover something that was stolen four decades ago.
Going back to Mount Mitchell stars mixed feelings and me. It’s not someplace I particularly want to go, but it is somewhere I have to go. I have to go there and conquer the demon is lived in me for so long. I have to go there and take back what I love. I have to take the power back from that teacher.


It’s going to be an emotional hike. I openly invited anyone on Facebook to join me. At the same time, I almost feel like solitude would be better. I’m just so unsure of whether I want to do this alone or with someone else. I guess that decision is out of my hands at this point. If someone from Facebook offers to join me, I will gladly bring them along. If the stars don’t align and it’s not the good Lord‘s intention for me to hike with someone else, then I’ll be hiking alone.

It’s getting close to completion and she’s getting excited about moving in. We bought the house about a year ago and haven’t had time to do much work. Over the last few months I’ve spent several weekends and a few weeks up here.
I was very close to my science teacher, Dave Cone. I don’t remember, specifically, how we ended up in the same tent. We all had small two person tents and we paired up with someone. I ended up in the tent with my teacher. It was a night I’ll never forget and can remember it, as if it happened last weekend.


I woke up in the middle of the night and thought I must be dreaming. I knew what was happening couldn’t be real. I wanted to believe it was just a dream. The next morning that’s still what I believed. I believed, (hoped with all of my heart) it was a dram. It couldn’t be true. He was a teacher and teachers didn’t do that. I remember thinking it had to be a dream.
Since then I’ve only been to Mount Mitchell a few times. Once with my little brother and my wife. Another time with my wife and our kids. Neither time did we spend the night. We just went up for the day. 


In the last 40 years, I haven’t camped at that campground or anywhere near it. In fact, I lost my desire to hike and camp, at all. I didn’t realize until recently, as my therapy has begun to make me think about my past, that I had put off camping and hiking even though it’s something I used to love doing.


In two days, I’ll be alone and camping on Mount Mitchell. I’m sure it’s going to be an emotional hike. I thought about inviting people or friends. In fact, I created a post on Facebook seeing if anyone wanted to go with me. Thankfully, no one is able. That means I can be alone with my thoughts and recollections.


Last weekends hike up Crowders Mountain was a symbolic way for me to reclaim a place where I was molested and haven’t returned to as an adult. I’m hoping for the same thing at Mount Mitchell. I’m hoping that the demons living there run and hide.


As I sit here and write, I feel sheer panic and terror that I’m going to be back there in 48 hours. At the same time, I’m excited to conquer this fear and trepidation. 


It’s not a strenuous or lengthy hike. Obviously, any hiking or camping will help prepare me for the Appalachian Trail. But this is more emotional preparation than physical. I just want to get out there and spend some time in my own head and possibly write in my journal.",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Thu",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656730,"I’m in my tent on top of Mt Mitchell. It’s the first time I’ve been back here to camp in 40 years. It’s where I was sexual abused for the first time, at age 12. 


At the Mt Mitchell parking area, there were signs posted with “No Camping” because of increased bear activity. Thankfully, the trail leading to Mt Craig had no such sign. I met a young man named Brett who was taking several weeks to drive home to Kentucky, from Bangor Maine. He just graduated college and is taking time off to enjoy life before starting a new job. 


We paired up and talked about the bear signs, finally deciding to proceed. We believe there was a bear sign pointing to Mount Craig, and think it might’ve been removed or fallen down. But we didn’t see it.


By this time it was 8:30 and we still had to take food out of our packs and get dressed for the hike. It was only about a mile to Mt Craig. But, there were several hundred feet of elevation gain and loss. It was dark, muddy, wet, but not too cool. 


It took about an hour to get over there and find a place to set up for the night. There isn’t much flat space available there.


We setup tents in the dark and smoked a cigar. I offered Brent one and he accepted. It was nice to sit there without any phone service and just enjoy the peace and quiet. Soon it was time for sleep and I took my sleeping and PTSD meds, to ensure I fell asleep and stayed that way. 


My tent is a small one-person model but Dogé found it necessary to climb over me and sleep with me. 


I knew she could hear and smell a bear long before it got close and would alert us if one came around. I also know should would attack a bear and be eaten as a light snack. So she remained safely in the tent with me. 


Sunrise came early but was on the opposite side and blocked by trees. But the view across the valley was spectacular and well worth the hike. 


Not once did I think about what happened to me forty years ago. I was far too busy enjoying the hike and scenery. It helped having company. Someone to talk to helped keep me out of my own head. It felt good
I thought about staying another night but wanted to spend time on the parkway enjoying the beautiful day and scenery.

It’s made more difficult by people that abuse the system by purchasing “Service Dog” vests for a pet. This damages the integrity of an already fragile system. Many people assume most service dogs are fake and that’s probably accurate. 


I’ve seen many people carrying their pooch or placing it in a grocery cart with a service vest. I’ve never heard of a legitimate service animal that needs to be carried. It’s unfortunate this happens because it hurts the perception of dogs that actually provide a service to their handlers. 


It also amazes me how many people ignore the multiple decals on my dog’s pack that clearly say “DO NOT PET”. Sometimes they aren’t looking but too often people say, “I know it says don’t pet but she’s too cute to pass up.” And they proceed to pet her anyway. 
Most people understand, but not everyone. Too often people ignore my verbal warning and pet her anyway. I am a member of several service dog groups and this is a problem experienced by many service dog handlers. 


Please help spread the word that service dogs have a job to do and don’t have the intelligence to split their focus like human beings. They get distracted when people pet them and they lose focus on their jobs. 


Hiking is a little better than being in Walmart, but people still fail to read her vest decals. Fortunately, I’ve not run into anyone on the trail that continued to pet her after I said something or they read her vest. 


Help service animals do their jobs better. Don’t let them. Ignore them, if they look at you. They aren’t seeking attention. They are just monitoring their surroundings. 


Most service dogs get more attention than their canine counterparts. They spend far more time with their handlers than almost any pet. Most are with their handlers 24/7/365.Thanks for your help.",,View Entry,"Aug 20, Sat",0

If you follow me regularly, you know I was molested as a young teen and that a lot of it happened on Crowders Mountain. My first hike back up there, last weekend, was very emotional. This weekend the old ghosts held no power over me and I enjoyed the hike every step. Although the actual steps (350 of them) were very difficult.


I’ve hiked three days in a row and that’s new for me. I’ve been doing weekend hikes, Saturday or Sunday, hiking with a friend. This weekend consisted of Mount Mitchell on Friday night, the parkway and several nice hikes on Saturday. I concluded the weekend with Crowders Mountain. It feels good to be enjoying something I used to love so much.


I find it amazing how quickly something I put away decades ago has come back into my life. Hiking and camping are something I’ve stayed away from for too long.


I enjoy being out there, whether I’m alone or with someone. My dog is always by my side, but I also enjoy the company of others along the trail.


I don’t remember a conscious decision to stop hiking or camping. I think it was more subconscious than anything else. Something dark and in the back of my mind compared hiking to the sexual abuse I experienced. In a matter of weeks and after sharing my abuse story publicly, I feel free to love hiking and camping again.


I’m only a couple weeks away from section hiking Grayson Highlands State Park to Roan Mountain Tennessee. This will take me through Damascus Virginia on the Appalachian trail. It’s a section of the trail that I’ve never hiked and I look forward to the new experience. It will be the most I’ve hiked since I was 15 and crossed Kings Canyon National Park from west to east. It will also be a good representation of what I’ll have to look forward to next March when I hike Georgia to Maine.


I’m so excited, so fearful, about setting foot on Mount Springer in March. I hope that a few friends and family can join me for that 1st mile or two of the trail. Thinking about the hike scares me, intimidates me, and exhilarates me. I’m looking forward to finding out if I have what it takes to hike 2200 miles.

Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656768,"Three years ago I boarded a cruise to Alaska and indoor skydiving was available on the ship. This Royal Caribbean boat was huge and there were things to do from stem to stern. But what I wanted to experience most was skydiving. I signed up and waited for my appointment.
After roaming the ship for hours, my appointed tim finally arrived. I was so excited and ready to give this a try. I put on the suit, strapped a helmet to my head and added safety glasses. I was ready. 


Before my turn, I was told to “step on the scale”. Apparently, there was a 250 pound weight limit. I wasn’t worried. I hopped on the scale and tipped it at 255 pounds. Oops. 


I pulled out my phone and wallet but still didn’t drop five pounds. I quickly changed from jeans to shorts and was only one pound over the limit. I kicked off my shoes and they recorded my weight as 248. I made it. 


A week later, after unlimited cruise food, I figured my weight had jumped five pounds, maybe a little more. I wasn’t sure if I could make the cut to do it again. Undeterred, I signed up again. It was the last night on the boat and the first thing I did was jump on the scale. I was shocked. 


In seven days, my weight was up more than fifteen pounds. Unlimited shrimp, multiple steaks at each dinner, too much pizza and no exercise took my weight to 270. It was the most I’ve ever weighed and needless to say, there was no way they would let me skydive. 


It was time for a change and I vowed to lose weight. I didn’t set a goal and just decided to eat less food. But I didn’t decide to wait until I got home. After all, it was the last night of our cruise and i had a bet to win. There was an open challenge to see who could eat the most shrimp. Finally, we lost count and only knew that me and my son had destroyed 250 shrimp. 
There was no way I was getting back on that scale. Back at home, a few days later, my weight settled just over 260. I had my work cut out for me and started to watch what I was eating. Instead of eating everything I wanted, I simply stopped at the edge of my plate. I stopped eating my wife’s leftovers and eating seconds or thirds at home. The first ten pounds were easy. The next ten took a little more time, but I dropped 20 pounds in a few weeks. 


It felt like if I added it quickly, I dropped it easy. 


I felt good at 240 pounds and shared my success on social media. The positive comments motivated me to keep going. There wasn’t a formal diet. The idea was to simply burn more calories than consumed. It was working but working slowly. 


A year ago, I reached 225 pounds and felt good. I was happy with that and simply tried to maintain that level. My weight fluctuates 3-5 pounds either direction on a weekly basis. I would gain five pounds and then drop back to my base. Then I might lose a few before settling back at 225. 


Several months ago, I decided to drop a few more pounds. Again, there was no specific goal. The idea was somewhere around ten pounds. 


I’ve read and been told the best weight lose is that which is slow and steady, instead of trying to drop weight quickly. This gives my body time to adjust to the new weight. That way, the weight feels normal instead of new. 


215 pounds felt good. It took me a couple months and it seemed to be easy to maintain. I still enjoy the occasional pizza and McDonalds is still a primary food group. However, Papa John’s isn’t coming to the house twice a week and McDonalds is an occasional treat or necessity when on the road. 


More recently, I made the decision to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. This would require a change in my physical conditioning. I would need to build stamina. The AT is not an easy hike. It’s 2200 miles of rocks, mud, rain and rough terrain. The mental conditioning would be as difficult as the physical.


I started hiking, but not just hiking. I’ve been carrying a fully stocked backpack. The pack weight changes based on which pack I use, what gear is included and what food is included. Depending on which pack and what gear I used, the weight could swing between 30 and 45 pounds. 


Maybe it’s good luck or good genetics, I don’t know. But the last few weeks have seen the lose of another 5 pounds. Now, I’m fluctuating between 207-212. Today, I hit 205 for the first time in 25 years. This morning, I hiked Crowders Mountain for the second Sunday in a row. Yesterday, I drove the Blue Ridge Parkway south of Mount Mitchell and took several hikes and spending the night on Mt Craig.
I just celebrated my weight lose with an extra large pepperoni and meatball pizza. Along with the pizza, I ordered pizza rolls and “PaPa Bowl”. The bowl and rolls were gone in minutes. Then a tackled a couple pieces of pizza. 


Tomorrow, the scale will probably read 210. I will add the water-weight list on today’s hike. The pizza, rolls and bowl will add a few pounds. I’m okay with that. I’ve got another weekend before I leave for my section hike of the AT. 


At this point, I’m questioning whether I want to lose anymore weight. I’m sure I could hit 200 without much more work, but not sure it’s what I want. My section hike will cover more than 100 miles from Grayson Highlands State Park, through Damascus Virginia and down to Roan Mountain Tennessee. I’ve not hiked that far since I was fifteen years old and hiked east to west, through Kings Canton National Park. 


I expect to burn at least 4000 calories a day, on the AT. It’s not easy to eat that many calories in a day.

For those that have read my previous posts, you know I’m a survivor of long-term childhood sexual abuse and much of it took place on school-sponsored hiking and camping trips. The AT is one of the places where that ghost of a memory has continued to hold power over me. It’s the reason for my plan to thru-hike next March. 
Over the last weeks and months, I have hiked, camped and reclaimed places where I was abused. Theses apprehensive steps on the AT were full of emotion. I cried much of the couple miles I walked. And would wipe my face and put on a smile whenever anyone passed. That is until a young man asked if everything was okay. He introduced himself as Brian and said he didn’t have a trail name and hadn’t been hiking in several years. 
He was a total stranger and the last thing I wanted to do was tell him my story. It was easy telling this group, because I don’t have to look any of you in the face. I said I was fine and thanked him, then continued walking. 
A couple minutes later I heard a voice and turned around to see Brian coming up the trail behind me. He said it was none of his business and he would walk away if I wanted, “but you really don’t seem okay.” I broke down and cried. I told him I was molested not far from where we were standing and trying to cope with some demons. 
To my astonishment, he threw his arms around me and said, “The Appalachian Trail still loves you.”  
It turns out he is a survivor of extreme physical abuse, as a child. We tarted talking and sharing our survivor stories. With both agreed that we were destined to meet and the trail had brought us together. 
We walked toward our cars and continued talking. He’s a college student and also trying to overcome his past. It was amazing how we connected in the middle of nowhere.

Because of foot issues, for which I’m having surgery in October, hiking wasn’t an option this weekend. A large bunion and bone spur were removed about four months ago. Now I’m having an old steel plate removed, along with large calcium deposits and another small but painful bone-spur. The bone spur was particularly painful the last few days or a week. I still wanted to get out on the trail and formulated another plan.


On Saturday, I scooped up my grandson and daughter. We headed to the trail crossing, after stopping by Dollar General. I has two small coolers and we bought drinks, snacks and ice. With full coolers we drove to the crossing and carried the coolers about 100 yards into the woods. 
Zeb wanted to climb a hill beside the creek and Sara wanted to see if ginseng was growing nearby. is he season hasn’t started yet, but she’s always on the lookout. He’s had fun climbing up and down the hill. She found places to come back and hunt the roots. There is lots of private land close to the trail in this area and it’s popular with hunters of all kinds. 


We walked about a half-mile south along the AT and took some photos.


Only a few hikers passed by and we let them all know to lookout for the coolers and help themselves to the drinks, snacks and candy. Everyone that passed was a section hiker but it’s not long before thru-hikers will start to pass regularly. 


Zeb had fun but got bored quickly. He enjoyed climbing on the rocks, until he slipped and hit his hip. After a couple minutes of tears, he was raring to go again. Sara’s would’ve been content to walk for several hours. She always loves getting out in the woods and looking for ginseng. She found several spots along the trail where it was growing, but that Hass to be left alone because it’s on the AT.  


She and I also enjoy taking pictures of plants, vines, mushrooms, and wild scenery. There’s so much on the trail that I look forward to capturing as best I can on my upcoming hikes.


I’m looking forward to my section hike and hope that my foot Injury/surgery doesn’t impair that ability. I’m trying to put off the surgery until October so I can get the section hike in. I just hope my foot cooperates.


Either way, next spring will see my through hike attempt starting in March. Spring will be following close behind and I expect there will be plenty of photos to be had. I’m debating on whether to buy a small digital camera or just use my phone. Of course the lens will be better on a cheap digital camera, but it’s one more thing to carry. On the other hand taking photos will use the battery on my phone. It’s tough choice.


I would be open to suggestions, if anyone has any.


All in all, this past weekend was a lot of fun. Zeb enjoyed “giving magic“. I’m looking forward to going back out there as the southbound through hikers start to come through. They will really enjoy meeting the people and giving out drinks and candy. I hope that this spurs in him a dream to follow his PopPop one day.

If you follow me regularly, this may not be difficult. In recent weeks and months I’ve shared a great deal of personal information about myself, as I’ve been dealing with the difficulties life can place in front of us. Can you tell the difference between the lie and the truth?


1 - A few years ago, I was flying from Portland Maine to San Francisco. Originally, I booked a flight from Portland to Charlotte, NC. Then I was given some work in California. Instead of changing my flight, I added a flight from CLT to SFO. 


Early that morning, I flew from Maine to Atlanta and then to Charlotte, where I got off the plane and went to baggage claim. Then, I proceeded back to the terminal and flew to Detroit, on my way to SFO. Here is where the story gets interesting. The Detroit flight was delayed and I missed the connected flight to California. Delta rebooked me on the next flight and upgraded me to first class. 


By this time, it’s around 9PM and I’m exhausted from being on the go since 5AM. I board the plane and ask for a red wine, actually two. I close my eyes and start to drift away. The old guy next to me says something to the flight attendant and he sounds familiar. 


I open my eyes to see a face I recognize. Although I’ve never met this man, I know him very well. Danny Glover was seated next to me on the plane. I said something about liking his movies and then closed my eyes. I wasn’t going to be “that guy” and bother him for the whole flight. 


Being seated together? We ended up at baggage claim together and he was recognized by others. A few people started asking for photos, while others didn’t ask and simply took pictures. One lady threw her arm around him for a selfie, without asking if it was okay. All of a sudden I realized how difficult it must be as a celebrity. 


Taking pity on the man, I stepped toward him and said, “Folks, Mr Glover has been flying all day and would still stand here for pictures, but I’ve got to get him somewhere. We’ve got to leave. Sorry.” He took my lead and said “thanks” as we approached the exit doors. 


Truth or lie?


2 - My first PC computer was an IBM-PCjr with a whopping 128K expanded memory and a 300 baud modem. If you didn’t know what that means, then you’re not a real computer nerd. It was a Christmas gift from my mother and came from Computer Land and a friend named Charlie. That’s how I joined the computer age and where the trouble started.


Although I was told it wouldn’t be possible to operate a computer “bulletin board” with this machine (it didn’t have a hard drive and no one would want to login at 300 baud - equivalent to driving interstate on a tricycle, with flat tires - I found a Basic copy of RBBS-PC on floppy disk and did exactly what I was told was impossible. I operated a computer bulletin board “BBS” (like and early version of a website). 


However, most people didn’t want to visit my BBS because it was slow. It would be a few years before I upgraded to a Compaq Portable, which had a hard drive and 2400 baud modem. Now I was riding a bicycle and my BBS became popular. Avery I was born. 


Here is where things get interesting. I began to realize other computers we connected to the system via telephone modems and some were easy to access. 


I’m 1985, I hacked into a Hardee’s location and wreaked havoc on the store by constantly changing the temperature, turning on and off lights during the day and generally being obnoxious. But it didn’t stop there. Instead, my computer crime career was just being born. It went on to claim many more victims until one day when the Secret Service knocked on my door, along with local police, postal investigators and the state bureau of investigations.


After hacking into local businesses, banks and the credit bureau, I had escalated to NASA and other government computers. 



All of a sudden, the government generosity became apparent. No, it became blatantly obvious. Thirty months was a gift and I should have been grateful to receive the offer. I informed my attorney the answer was a resounding yes. I would gladly sign up for thirty months. 
Truth or lie?


3 - I’ve always lived trains and Tweetsie Railroad, in Blowing Rock, is somewhere I’ve been visiting since I was a child. There are photos of me on the Tweetsie train before I can remember. From age three or four, it was a regular summer destination. The family
Would head to the mountains for a weekend and this was always a place I begged to go. 
Although I never saw Gene Autry and probably wouldn’t have recognized him if I did, Fred Kirby was often seen be me and others at the park. He was a regular figure and always in his bright red cowboy costume. He was happy to pose for a photo or to talk with a fan. And I was a huge fan. 


Maybe around age five or six, Fred Kirby crossed my path at the park one day. I probably pulled out my cap gun and said something like “stick ‘em up.” And I’m sure he did. Fred probably raised his arms and replied something like, “Oh please don’t shoot. I give up.” He was wonderful and great with us kids. He was always in character. 



Hey guys, look. I brought Fred Kirby with me to school. All the kids would have been fans of his afternoon TV show and movies. 


Finally, or it could have been the first thing we did, some details are blurry… we ended up on the train. We weren’t in the coaches. I was riding in the “engine” of Tweetsie Railroad and Fred Kirby was driving. I was sitting on his lap and helping drive the train. It was one of the most memorable days of my life. 


I remember him walking to the parking lot and the back door of our station wagon. The car was turd green and the back door window was rolled down. He lifted me up and put me through the window. I still have a picture of Fred Kirby standing beside that wagon, holding me, and making a gun with his thumb and finger. 


It was an amazing day and is burned into my memory
 It’s probably one of the biggest reasons why I love trains still to this day.

I did in fact enjoy a flight from Detroit Michigan to San Francisco California, while seated next to Danny Glover. We chatted for a few minutes then both drifted off. I truly didn’t want to be “that guy“. I wanted to let the poor man get some rest.


Well I did grow up 75 miles from Tweetsie railroad and, did see Fred Kirby several times, I never was carried around by him or rode in the locomotive, while he was driving. He certainly never carried me to mom’s car in the parking lot. This story was the lie.
Counselors typically advise patients not to make life altering decisions after a crisis like separation or divorce. I imagine my Appalachian Trail hike will be life altering. The books have read and what I’ve discovered seem to lead towards everyone having a life altering experience well through hiking. However, my counselor agrees with my decision and thinks it’s going to be a good experience for me.


Finally, the last few months have seen my sharing a story of childhood abuse survival. Sharing that story has been the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. At the same time, it’s been a great experience. I’ve received so much support from so many people. Everyone has been amazing.


As I prepare for my hike next March, I’m hiking more than I have since I was an early teenager. Unfortunately, I’m due for one more foot surgery in September and the condition of my foot is quickly deteriorating to the point it’s keeping me off the trails. While the bunion has been corrected, I have pins in my foot from a car accident in 1987. They have to be removed, along with a significant bone spur on one of my toes.
Listening to audiobooks and reading the experience of other hikers, I’ve realized the Appalachian Trail is going to be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. No life experience could prepare me for more than 2000 miles While carrying 45 pounds on my back and keeping track of my PTSD service dog.


I find myself contemplating whether or not I can finish. I find myself praying that God chooses me to be one of the 20% that is able to finish. 


I find myself praying.


Many people that have life altering experiences tends to “find Jesus“. I never lost him. I’ve always enjoyed a very strong faith. I was born and raised Catholic. After marrying Amy Gardner at age 21, I started attending the church she grew up in, which was Baptist. I no longer consider myself Catholic or Baptist, or Lutheran, or Episcopalian. While I have attended many different denomination churches throughout my life, I simply consider myself to be Christian.


I don’t believe my faith is intertwined with any particular religion or church. My faith is intertwined with God. If I die tomorrow, I know where I’m going. I believe what’s next. I have faith. At the same time, I long for a more personal relationship with God.


I believe that relationship has always been available to me. My anger at myself and God for things that happened to me have clouded my vision. They’ve prevented me from being able to see God talking back. I believe that God has spoken to me throughout life it has a purpose for me. It’s my hope to rediscover that relationship and know that purpose, and I hope to find that while hiking over 2000 miles.",,View Entry,"Sep 03, Sat",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657483,"Almost every hiker picks or is given a nickname or trail name. Mine used to be “Bear”. For years, my Facebook profile read “Greg Bear Gardner”. It’s a nickname I was given while working as a tour guide many years ago. I had a mohawk and thick beard. I weighed in around 250 and the name fit. I was a tour guide for a company that took young adults on cross-country trips. Some people thought taking that job was a little crazy. 


But I’ve always lived a little on the wild side and a little outside the box. Friends and family have said I must be a little crazy to hike the AT at 53. They’re all proud of my goal but still think it’s a little crazy. 


Others don’t understand why I publicly shared my status as a surveyor of long-term childhood sexual abuse. A few think it was crazy to share my story on Facebook and in the local newspaper. They can admire my courage but still think it’s a little crazy. 


I suffer from PTSD, although my symptoms have lessened since starting counseling six months ago. My sleeping issues have subsided. The anger problems are gone and I feel more mentally heathy than I have in decades. So why hike the AT? To raise awareness for childhood sexual abuse. My shirt will display the statistics; “1:4 Girls / 1:7 Boys” are affected by sexual abuse before age 18. I’m putting it out there for total strangers to ask me about. Anyone that does that must be a little crazy. 
Growing up, one of my favorite shows was M.A.S.H. And one of the most memorable characters was Corporal Max Klinger. The character was constantly trying to get a psychiatric discharge from the Army, also known as a “Section Eight” discharge. Through eight seasons, he wore women’s clothes in an attempt to convince people he was crazy. However, it never worked. 


One of his superior officers once commented that Klinger must be the only person who was not crazy. Everyone else simply accepted their place and wasn’t trying to get out of the Army and the war. And that, “Bucking for a section eight was the only sane thing to do.”


I’ve decided to leave my given trail name (“Bear”) at home and take one of my own choosing. Because some people think I’m a little crazy, but I feel like I’m the only one with any sanity, I’ve chosen the trail name “Section Eight”.  Of course, I realize the trail has a mind of its own and another name may be bestowed upon my.

It could snow. It will be hot and it will be cold. All the time, I’ll be hiking or camping. 


It’s just staring to sink in. While I’m hiking, I won’t have the comforts of home; air conditioning, heat, a ready hot shower, or ready to eat food in the fridge. I’m choosing to forego these things and travel by foot from Springer Mtn George to Mt Katahdin Maine, 2200 miles apart. 


What kind of sane person does this? What kind of person chooses to walk through the woods in torrential rain, or try and follow a rocky path when it’s 25 degrees and there’s snow on the ground? Who gives up air conditioning to walk in the woods all summer? 


Someone with something to prove. Someone like me. 


As a Boy Scout, I loved to hike and camp. As an early teen I loved the outdoors and signed up for every school-sponsored camping trip. I was always excited to hop in the car with my mom and head to Franklin NC for a weekend of gem stone mining and living in a tent. I loved hiking and camping. By age sixteen that was stolen from me, but I didn’t find out about the theft for almost forty years. It took that long for me to figure out why I lost this love. 


It was stolen by a teacher that molested me for three years, every time I signed up for a school-sponsored hiking or camping trip. No longer did a tent hold any appeal. I didn’t want to spend time in the woods. Only recently have I begun to discover why I stopped hiking and camping. I associates hiking and camping with being molested and never even knew. 


So I have something to prove? You’re damn right I do. I have to prove to myself, that teacher holds no power over me. I have to prove the wood no longer hold power over me. I have to take back my love of the outdoors. I have to slap fear in the face and walk straight through. 


I have to realize I can’t do this alone. I need a support team at home. From the practical side, I need someone to mail resupply boxes to designates spots along the trail. From an emotional standpoint I need people that will encourage me when I get depressed from walking in the rain five days straight. Most important, I need a spiritual guide to take me by the hand and walk beside me. I need God to pick me up and carry me through the difficulties. 


I will never complete this hike without God’s help. 


Besides publicly sharing the story of my childhood sexual abuse, this hike will be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I can’t do it without the practical, emotional and spiritual support of God, family and friends. 


I hope you will follow my journey and share it with your friends and family.",,View Entry,"Sep 09, Fri",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657953,"So far, my training has consisted of short day hikes through Kings Mountain national military park in Crowders Mountain State Park. The steps in Crowders Mountain (350 of them) are relatively challenging. But the overall elevation gain is only a few hundred feet. Well I won’t call it easy, it’s not challenging in the respect of the Appalachian Trail.


Yesterday, I started something a little more aggressive. The profile trail at grandfather mountain, North Carolina, is about 3 1/2 miles long with a 1700 foot elevation gain. From the parking lot to Collaway Gap is about 3 1/2 hours. We were on site with sleeping bags rolled out by 4 PM yesterday. The amazing thing was I wasn’t exhausted.


Trying that hike two months ago would’ve nearly killed me. I probably could’ve made it, but I would’ve been miserable. Yesterday, I was enjoying the hike. I was a little winded a few times and needed to stop to take a break. But after 3 1/2 miles and 1700 feet, I was ready for more. I could’ve gone further. As amazing as that sounds it’s true. I felt great.
It’s almost impossible to describe how bright the stores are on a clear night at nearly 6000 feet. It’s also difficult to explain how cold it can be for your face to stick out in the breeze. I turned over put my face in a towel and pull the sleeping bag over my head. I was snug as a bug in a rug. I was also nice and warm.
Overall, it was about an 8 mile hike up and back. My foot started giving me problems on the way down. The bone spur on my left fourth toe is really starting to hurt. But I didn’t give in and I kept pushing. Now that I’m laying in bed and relaxing, I feel some of the woes. The soles of my feet are hurting and my hips are sore. Thankfully, my knees are OK. Overall, I’m happy with where I am.


I’ve got a lot more training to do And I want to complete some section hikes by the end of the year. I’m still looking at Grayson Highlands State Park to Roan Mountain Tennessee. That’s about a week and a half at my current level. With some more aggressive training, I think I can get that down to a week.


It’s a slow process, just like hiking the Appalachian Trail. You put 1 foot in front of the other about five million times. Conditioning is the same. 1 foot in front of the other until it hurts. Stop. Repeat.


After hiking the profile trail I feel much better about my chances of completing the AT, next year.",,View Entry,"Sep 15, Thu",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657954,"If you followed my story from the beginning, you know that I am a survivor of long-term childhood sexual abuse and that I was molested by a teacher from age 12 to 15. You also know that I’m separated from my wife, but we remain friends. One trauma was four decades ago. The other was a little more than four months ago. Both were life-changing.
I went to a pretty dark place for a while. I won’t say the thoughts are gone. But I will say they’ve lessened greatly. They don’t have as much control over me as they did a few months ago. Amy and I have remained friends. We see each other regularly and whatever happens, we’ll always be friends.


I’ve rekindled friendships. And found new hiking partners. Of course, my best friend Carl is also a hiking partner. He helped me in the very beginning and I’m sure we’re going to do a lot more walking together.


I look forward to walking the trails with all of my current friends and the friends I haven’t met yet. If you’re reading this and live anywhere near the Appalachian trail, I invite you to come out and walk with me. Whether it’s a day, a mile, or a week, I invite you to join me. Help me celebrate my reclamation and joy of hiking. Help me raise awareness for childhood sexual abuse.


Did you know that one in four girls and one in seven boys will be molested or assaulted before age 18? That means you have friends, neighbors, coworkers, and family members that have been assaulted. This isn’t something that affects other people. It affects me. It affects you. It affects everyone we know. It’s an epidemic that many don’t want to talk about.


I want to change that.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Fri",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658899,"We use nice words like “victimization” and “molestation” to talk about what you did. People don’t want to say “rape” or “sodomy”, when talking about a child victim. It’s easier to say, “That child was abused by a teacher”, that give voice to the truth; “That child was raped and sodomized.” 
You were a horrific man and did awful things to countless children that you were supposed to protect. You were a serial pedophile and took advantage of my trust. 
You taught me so much but took so much more. You instilled in me a love of science and the outdoors; hiking, backpacking, geology and ecology. Then you molested me for three years and stole it all. You destroyed my childhood. You made me a statistic. 
I made myself a survivor. 
For decades, the shame of what you did haunted me. The humiliation of being molested shamed me. Being a victim of long-term childhood abuse humiliated me. The fear, humiliation and shame followed me more than forty years, until I opened up and shared what you did. You were an evil man, and destroyed the lives of many children. I’m learning to take back what you stole. 
I’m hiking the Appalachian Trail next year. I’m walking from Georgia to Maine.
First and foremost, I’m doing this for myself. I’m taking back my love of hiking, something you stole by raping me of school-sponsored camping trips. This is going to be the most difficult thing I’ve ever done and I hope to raise awareness that more people like you are out there. Pedophiles are everywhere but the victims don’t have to be ashamed. We can speak out with a unified voice because we did nothing wrong. 
Victims can share their stories without being ashamed. Survivors can tell what happened without wondering what others may think of them. We can speak with one voice and say, “We did nothing wrong.” 
You have no power over me. You can’t hurt me anymore. You can’t take anything from me. I have the power to heal and will take back everything you stole; trust, love, freedom, hiking and camping.",,View Entry,"Oct 20, Thu",0
Section Eight ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659876,"I’ve got just a little over 45 days until my Appalachian Trail hike starts on March 4th. I’ve tested my gear and setup my tent. I’ve slept and pooped in the woods. I’ve dehydrated a few special things my trail boss is going to ship up, when I’m ready. I’ve read books and watched videos. I’ve made online friends and look forward to meeting along the trail. I’m starting with a one-mile back hike to the top of Springer and planning on the first day being fairly short. Some family and friends want to join me for that first mile. I want to thank everyone who’s given advice or shared ideas. I’m prepared as I can be.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Tue",0
