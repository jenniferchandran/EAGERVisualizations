Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646266,"Birdman and I met this morning in Pensacola with several members of our support team as we discussed preparations for our upcoming hike. The main topic of our discussion was a handout that we could share to allow others to follow us. Birdman will be producing videos and posting them on his YouTube channel, Birdman and Friends Outdoor Adventures. And, as I usually do, I will keep a journal of my experiences and impressions which will be uploaded to www.trailjournals.com. To minimize the weight we carry, we elected to use something about the size of a business card. Because of the extremes we will experience in weather (cold, heat, rain, snow, humidity) our plan is to utilize a thin plastic card rather than paper, making it both lightweight and durable. The back of the card will have QR codes which can be scanned to take a person directly to our websites. I'm excited to see the finished card which will introduce folks to Birdman and me and allow them to follow us on our ""Journey to Katahdin."" We also discussed some of the gear we will be carrying and how long it will take us. It is also hoped that some members of our team will be able to meet us at certain points along the AT to join us and hike sections of the trail with us.  We closed our conference with a prayer for safety and guidance as we prepare and soon set off on this 2,200 mile journey, a journey that we first dreamed of 6 years ago.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646294,"Two months from today, the journey begins. Sitting in the airport in Panama City, I’m waiting on my flight to Denver. Jameson, my oldest son, called last week and asked me to fly out so that we could watch the CFB National Championship game together. Growing up in Alabama, I was raised on Alabama football. I recall as an eight year old boy sitting in a dove field on the third Saturday in October listening to the Tide play the Tennessee Volunteers. Watching with Daddy on our black and white TV such greats as Joe Namath, Kenny Stabler and Johnny Musso etched on my soul a lifelong devotion to Alabama, a devotion that was passed down to both my sons.
The weather in Colorado will be much colder than here on the Gulf Coast. Hopefully, it will help me begin to acclimate to weather on the AT at the start of our hike. I’m not a huge fan of the cold and dread some of the freezing temperatures we will face. However, as a thru hiker, I have tackled extreme conditions before. Each occasion has allowed me to gain confidence in my ability to persevere and prepared me for the rigors this hike will present. 
I decided to use my Warbonnet Blackbird XL hammock instead of my tent on the AT. To counter temperatures that will frequently get below freezing, I invested in a 0° underquilt. By adjusting my tarp, I am able to vary the amount of airflow and block out the coldest winds. Daily weather checks will allow me to anticipate winter storms and take necessary precautions as they approach. 
It is impossible to follow the trail beneath a fresh snowfall and white blazes vanish when the entire landscape turns white. Zero days and hostels are essential to surviving on a thru hike that begins while winter is still in force. Though risk-taking is a part of any thru hike, success is contingent on being smart and cautious. God bless!
Faith, Family and Football - Several years ago, my sons and I met in Tuscaloosa to watch Alabama play the University of Louisiana where Jameson played college baseball. He wore the Ragin Cajuns gear, as the school and fan base had so strongly supported him as a student athlete. But down inside, he cheered for the Crimson Tide. His upbringing had deeply seeded in him a love for Alabama football.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0
Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646519,"March 9th is close but not yet here. How do I utilize the time leading up to our start date? Well, this past weekend I opted to hike the Florida Trail from U.S. Highway 331 to the Alaqua campsite, about a 10 mile trek each way. The overnight stay would allow me to test my sleep system in sub-freezing weather. Temperatures dropped into the mid-20’s Saturday night, but my 0° underquilt and 10° quilt kept me warm and comfortable throughout the night. In fact, my hands were so warm that I even removed my gloves.
Morning, however, brought the challenge of climbing out of my hammock to fix my coffee and pack up. Cold, arthritic hands do not function well. A task as simple as flicking a Bic lighter becomes a chore. Before I got my stove lit, ice crystals had already formed in the water I had poured in my cup. Without the feeling in my fingers, I found it hard to perform simple acts such as putting my hammock and tarp in their stuff sacks or tying my shoe laces.
There is no describing the agonizing pain I felt as my fingers began to warm up. It was so excruciating that I began to feel nauseous and had to sit down. As I sat there, I recalled having that same sensation many times growing up. 
Our south Alabama farm was a small family operation, and during the winter we grew greens: turnips, mustard, collards and some rutabagas. We gathered greens in all kinds of weather. As long as the ground wasn’t frozen, we were in the field at daylight. We used baling twine made from jute to tie the bunches of greens. Gloves were of little use as they made it difficult to tie a knot in the baling twine. Besides, once they were wet from the dew or rain, wearing them was pointless. Our fingers became numb from the cold and stayed that way for several hours until we finished. 
The work concluded when we hauled the greens to our pond, backed the truck down to the water and tossed the bundles in, washing each one before pitching it back into the truck bed. There were days we had to break the ice in the pond to do this. While rubber boots or waders kept the water off our feet, our hands suffered from the extreme conditions. 
But the greatest agony came as my hands would begin to warm up. As the blood flow to my hands increased, it brought a level of pain that, for me, was nearly unbearable. Never in my life have they ached so severely. . . until this weekend. 
Those experiences growing up toughened me and helped me to understand that if we can endure the pain, there is an end to it at some point. The pain will be temporary, but quitting will haunt me forever. Many things we must do in life are painful or at least uncomfortable. But if we recognize that the discomfort is for a limited duration and we persevere, our endurance rewards us with a sense of triumph and accomplishment.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646659,"There are certain names that are icons in the hiking community. Names like Earl Shaffer, Benton MacKaye, Grandma Gatewood, John Muir.  And Billy Goat. Billy Goat is a legend; his name well-known by any serious hiker. After retiring from the railroad at the age of 50, Billy Goat spent most of his time on trails. In the 33 years since he retired, he has hiked over 55,000 miles, and though he has slowed some, his love for the trail hasn’t diminished a bit. 
On the last Saturday in January at Lake Mills Park in Chuluota, Florida, hikers, trail angels and friends gather to celebrate Billy Goat’s birthday each year. Last year the festivities were canceled due to the COVID pandemic. This past weekend, however, the gathering again took place. More than 140 members of the hiking community assembled to wish Billy Goat a happy birthday. It is an event similar to Trail Days on the Appalachian Trail where hikers come together and enjoy a time of fellowship. Current Florida Trail thru hikers made their way to the park, many arriving Friday afternoon. Lots of former FT thru hikers, like me, also arrived.
I drove down Friday with Gail Walsh whose trail name is Feral. My nephew, John Hartzell, met us there. I had reserved a campsite, though I intended to sleep in the bed of my truck instead of my tent. That decision proved sagacious as the temperatures dropped into the mid-20’s. Our campsite seemed to draw a large crowd Saturday morning and evening all because of the food and the fire. Amy Jensen, who completed a thru hike of the Florida Trail last year, showed up with doughnuts and coffee around daylight Saturday morning. (Amy had stayed with me and Miss Nancy on her FT thru hike.) We built a fire in the fire pit and folks soon began to appear. As the food and coffee started to run low, Dave Magness, arrived with more of the same.
Near lunchtime, everyone relocated to a large pavilion in the park where we honored Billy Goat on his 83rd birthday, showering him with well-wishes and singing Happy Birthday to him. Following the large potluck dinner, folks spent hours getting reacquainted, reminiscing and meeting those who were new to the event. There were so many familiar names and faces! Sandra Friend and John Keatley, who authored the Florida Trail Guide. Lauralee Bliss, a writer whose works include the book, “Gators, Guts and Glory” about her experience hiking the Florida Trail. Nathan and Kimm Wright who run the Pinhoti Outdoor Center in Alabama. Jessica Mills and her boyfriend, MarDe Brooks, who stayed with me and Miss Nancy last year. Jessica is better known by her trail name, “Dixie.” They completed the Florida Trail in 2021 and documented their hike through a series of YouTube videos. Sean “Runbum” Blanton, who holds the fastest known time after completing the Florida Trail two years ago in just 22 days. Melton “Grits” Cockrell, who is thru hiking the Florida Trail for the 11th time.
Nathan and Kimm brought with them another hiking icon, Sunny Eberhart, Better known by his trail name, “Nimblewill Nomad,” Sunny completed a Bama to Baxter hike in November and in the process became the oldest person to thru hike the Appalachian Trail. Like Billy Goat, he is 83 years old. Sunny is a great friend and bestowed on me my trail name, “Steps.” He and Billy Goat inspire all of us “kids” to keep hiking. Never use age as an excuse not to attempt a dream.
As the sunlight faded, we built a large campfire back at our campsite. Amy and I had found a local firewood business and bought 80 pieces, knowing it would be a chilly evening. As always, I retired early but the singing and storytelling continued on. It was past midnight that I roused up and still could hear voices. Sometime in the next hour things finally drew to a close. 
It was 26° Sunday morning. Fortunately, Ari Hirschman made coffee as we packed up to leave. Feral and I dropped Grits off in Lake Butler on our way home so that he could continue on the trail. I’m looking forward to seeing many of the thru hikers, including Grits, when they reach Walton County. Hopefully, I can offer some of them a hot shower, warm bed and home cooked meal. God bless!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653846,"Laughing Loon and Apollo caught up with us this morning. I have seen them several times over the past week. Their story is worth sharing. They are from Maine and started hiking the AT at the same time. What makes their story so unique is that Laughing Loon has a son the same age as Apollo. Both young men played high school basketball in Maine. During their senior year the boys’ teams played one another. In that game Laughing Loon’s son broke Apollo’s nose. Now Apollo and Laughing Loon are hiking partners. They met one another their second day on the trail and have been hiking together ever since. 
Today was spent climbing up and down over countless rocks and boulders. Hand over hand on several occasions where a slip would mean critical injury. One of the most challenging of these is known as the Lemon Squeezer. It is a large crevasse in some broken boulders that required removing my pack and handing it up before I could pass through the narrow passageway. Just beyond it was a sheer rock face that I scaled by finding a few handholds and inching my way up the side of the massive rock. I had already handed my backpack up to Lost Cause, who had scaled it ahead of me. As he and I proceeded on we passed a sign at the blue blaze around that short section; it read, “Easy Way” with an arrow pointing towards the blue blaze trail.
I hiked with my good friend, Lost Cause, most of the day. We had been together through the Shenandoahs until he had to get off the trail for a while because of cellulitis in one of his legs. But he’s a fast hiker and caught up with us yesterday. Our goal was to reach Black Mountain so we could see the New York City skyline at night. Lost Cause and I got to Black Mountain around 6:00 p.m. and located four spots to tent or hammock on the ledge at the summit. Monarch and Stan the Man arrived about an hour later. They are hiking slower since they are both still dealing with injuries. From our vantage point atop Black Mountain, we were able to see a colorful sunset, the Hudson River, and the lights of NYC.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646812,"One month. Four weeks. Twenty eight days. Any way I look at it, our start date is quickly approaching. I spent today finalizing my gear, laying it out, re-weighing each piece. From a physical perspective, I am ready at this moment to begin this hike. I have all my gear. I’m in excellent physical shape, running 30 miles a week in addition to doing trail maintenance and some hiking. Mentally, I’m ready for the challenge. My previous thru hikes have provided me with the knowledge and confidence I need to be successful. I know what to expect and how to cope with many of the obstacles thru hikers face. I’m also prepared for the emotional toll this hike will exact on me. Leaving Miss Nancy for up to six months is hard enough, but a week ago my daughter gave birth to another grandson. I feel blessed though to be able to spend over a month with little Henry James Hobbs before our hike begins. In addition, modern technology will afford me opportunities to see and talk to those I love while on the trail.
So for the next month, I plan to focus on the spiritual challenge this hike presents. Although hiking the Appalachian Trail will be a rewarding experience in many respects, I am not doing it for the attention. Instead, I sincerely hope to touch the lives of the people we meet, to give them faith, joy, hope and encouragement. I want to be a blessing to others and, likewise, allow them to be a blessing to me. 
Over the past year, I’ve read a couple of articles and viewed a number of social media posts where hikers claimed to have done impressive things. However, as a runner and a hiker, I know when such feats are a fabrication. More and more, I’ve come to the realization that some hikers are seeking the acclaim of others and will resort to making untruthful claims to gain it. It saddens me to know that just because a hiker says they thru hiked a trail, they may have skipped sections or caught a ride to avoid road walks. It disappoints me when a hiker tells me he hiked X number of miles that day, but I know he didn’t. When I say that my goal is to hike the Appalachian Trail, that means to take every step on the AT between Springer Mountain and Mount Katahdin. Birdman has that same mindset. 
My friend, Sunny Eberhart, recently finished hiking from Flagg Mountain in Alabama to Mount Katahdin in Maine, every step. And while his exploits have drawn plenty of attention from the public, Sunny remains very humble. He continues to love others and will sit and talk for hours with any visitor who happens upon the Civil Conservation Corps cabins on Flagg Mountain. Of his many admirable traits, his humility stands out the most. This is a man who has hiked over fifty thousand miles, but you wouldn’t know it because he never brags about what he has done.
My purpose of this journal is to chronicle our hike, not to draw attention to us. So for the next month, I hope that those who read this will join me in praying that the Lord is glorified in this pursuit. That Christ is lifted up. For the next 28 days, my quiet time each morning will be spent preparing my heart for this trek. May God keep me sensitive to the needs of others. And above all, may He keep me humble! God bless!",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Wed",0
Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646930,"After years of training for and competing in marathons and ultras, I know full well the importance of being at peak performance for an event. The same is true for a thru hike. It is best to begin such a physical challenge in top physical shape. The trail will exact a toll on your body. From the pounding of each step to the inadequacies of your nutritional intake, your body is subjected to physical abuse. While some folks advocate hiking your way into shape, this to me is less likely to result in a successful hike. Beyond that, the misery you will experience as your body is forced to morph itself into hiking shape while on the trail is needless. All that’s required is the time and commitment to prepare your body ahead of time. If that commitment is too great, then perhaps you should rethink whether a thru hike is a worthy aspiration.
In the months leading up to this hike, I have seen a variety of medical professionals, attending to my eyes, teeth, heart, colon and overall health. Last week I was given the go ahead by my cardiologist, and yesterday I had a colonoscopy done. Everything was fine. That concludes all my medical prep. I also spent several weeks in physical therapy to work on strengthening my core muscles and improving my balance.
Saturday was a 27 mile hike across Eglin AFB on the Florida Trail. I carried my hand saw and cleared about a half dozen blowdowns. It gave me an opportunity to break in my new pair of Altra Olympus trail runners that I will use for the AT. Despite being the first time I had worn them, they caused no blisters. The next time I wear them will be when I leave Amicalola Falls Visitor Center on the Approach Trail. 
Today’s run was 6.2 miles on the Timpoochee Trail, a paved bike/running path along 30-A in South Walton. My 9:10 per mile pace was faster than I have been on any training run in the past year. That tells me I’m peaking at the right time. 
Now comes the hard part. Easing off on the accelerator goes against my nature. However, from years of competition, I know its importance. I’ve always had a tendency to overtrain. So during the next couple of weeks, I will begin to taper. I will start to run less, and while I will hike, I will not push the envelope in pace and distance hiked. The goal is to reach the start of the AT rested and in peak condition. God bless!
 Carrying a hand saw on day hikes lets me clear small blowdowns that block the trail. For larger trees, I take a photo and note the mile marker so that I can return later with a chainsaw and clear it.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Thu",0

Such assistance, which is often unexpected, is commonly called “trail magic.” By offering trail magic I am able to pay it forward, knowing that there will be many along the Appalachian Trail who will provide Birdman and me with trail magic. Beyond the joy that comes from helping others, giving trail magic allows me the opportunity to get to know people from all over the world.
I met Goose and Lucky Hat at Billy Goat Day back in January. These two young men were headed northbound on the Florida Trail. Goose is from Southern California and Lucky Hat is from Canada. Goose is extremely intelligent and articulate, an English literature major who dropped out of college to hike. When he finally pens his experiences, they will make for some very interesting reading. Among his exploits, he has road walked across the United States from Ventura, California to Washington D.C. Lucky Hat is a robotics engineer, but is currently doing IT work to pay the bills while he hikes the trails. They spent an afternoon and evening with me and Miss Nancy as a line of thunderstorms passed through the area. I picked their brains about their gear as they evaluated my AT gear selections, which were laid out upstairs. These two young bucks are fast hikers who regularly hike 35 to 40 miles a day. Amazing young men and a pleasure to host!
I’ve known Grits since we met on the Florida Trail in 2020. By all accounts, Grits holds the record for the most thru hikes of the Florida Trail, which I believe is currently eleven. Grits, however, disavows knowledge of the exact number or simply won’t confess out of modesty. I picked Grits up at the Owls Head trailhead this week and also got to meet Turkish, who is hiking for veterans. He was being picked up by folks from the VFW post in DeFuniak Springs.
As soon as I picked him up, Grits and I went to Publix and bought three large subs. From there, we drove back to the trail in time to meet Bopit and Punisher and offer them some trail magic. Bopit and Punisher were at Billy Goat Day. They hiked the Florida Trail last year and continued on to Mount Katahdin. Bopit is from Jacksonville, Florida while Punisher is from Napa, California. They finished their FT thru hike today. After feeding them, Grits and I headed home where he showered and did some laundry. Grits is a redneck from Quitman, Georgia, and according to him, he’s on America’s Most Unwanted. The man is a real character and so much fun to be around. He claims he hikes so that he can hide from relatives and bill collectors! I dropped Grits off at the trailhead Tuesday on my way to do trail maintenance. It was such a blessing to reconnect with this dear friend!
Yesterday I did a short hike and met Walkabout and Skipper, a wonderful couple from Germany. They are experienced hikers and are thru hiking the Florida Trail. I said that when they reached the trailhead, they would see my truck with an ice chest in the back. I told them to grab a cold Coca Cola out, drop the tailgate down and relax with a cold drink. They followed my instructions. When I later returned to my truck, I found two crushed, empty Coke cans and their card with the sweetest thank you note written on the back. On my way to church this morning, I again met Walkabout and Skipper as they reached U.S. 331. I invited them to stay with us, but unfortunately, they had already prepaid for a hotel room. So instead, Miss Nancy and I are taking them to lunch on Tuesday. 
Each of these individuals is special to me. And while they may feel they were the recipients of trail magic, what they received cannot compare to the magic they did in this old hiker’s heart. We are friends forever, and I look forward to meeting them again one day somewhere down the trail!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647203,"Last October I hiked from Amicalola Falls, Georgia to Flagg Mountain, Alabama, Flagg Mountain is a special place to me. Not only is it located in the state where I grew up, it’s home to the cabins and tower that were built by the Civil Conservation Corps in the 1930’s. And it’s where I began my first thru hike on April 11, 2019 when I hiked the Pinhoti Trail. Flagg Mountain is also home to my good friend, Sunny Eberhart, who is known in the hiking community as Nimblewill Nomad. 
This past Wednesday, I drove to Flagg Mountain. It was a beautiful day that started out chilly but warmed up into the mid-60’s. I was last there on November 21st to watch as Sunny finished his Bama to Baxter thru hike after becoming the oldest person to thru hike the Appalachian Trail. I saw him climb the tower and wave down to the crowd below in conclusion to his remarkable achievement. Three weeks earlier, I had stood atop Flagg Mountain at sunrise as I finished hiking from Amicalola Falls as part of my own Bama to Baxter thru hike, one that will resume on March 9th. 
I sat down with Sunny on Wednesday, and we talked. For hours. We discussed the mountain, the trails, our writings and life. It was refreshing to be able to relax and soak up his wisdom. And as he does with every hiker he meets, Sunny gave me lots of encouragement. In him I see many of my own attributes: wanderlust, fondness for the outdoors, relentless drive and, most significantly, a sincere love for people. I found it interesting as he talked about how often he lost his balance and fell on his thru hike. He said the most he went without falling was three days. As I’ve aged, I’ve seen my own ability to maintain balance diminish. I stumble and trip rather frequently. I even spent a month in physical therapy earlier this year to help improve my balance prior to this hike. Nonetheless, I expect to take my share of spills on the AT, just as Sunny did.
As I prepared to leave, he and I took a moment to pray together. I left Flagg Mountain energized. Sparked by the legend himself and fueled by that feeling of once again standing on the peak where for me it all began. I had gone there intending to climb the Civil Conservation Corps tower but left without doing so. No, I will wait to ascend those steps on my return from Maine, after I’ve summitted Katahdin. I will finish my Bama to Baxter thru hike just the way Nimblewill Nomad did. By climbing to the top of the tower on Flagg Mountain, the southern-most Appalachian peak of 1,000 feet and gazing out across the state of Alabama. After all, that’s where for me it began.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647260,"After weeks with very little rain, all of that changed today. We drove to Amicalola Falls State Park through intermittent rain showers that ranged from a mist to heavy rain. We pulled into the state park around 4:30 p.m. I threw my pack on and hurried into the visitor center. To my dismay, the clerk informed me that she thought they were through registering hikers for the day, but, she said, it looked like there was still a car at the pavilion. I hurriedly hiked to the second pavilion and stepped inside. Bob, the ATC volunteer was still there although he was close to leaving. Birdman and I signed in and received our AT hang tags. I am thru hiker #1053, and Birdman is #1054. Over a thousand thru hikers already, and we are barely into March!
After sitting through a brief orientation, Birdman and I walked back down to the visitor center and around back to the iconic arch that marks the start of the AT Approach Trail, a nine mile climb to the top of Springer Mountain where the Appalachian Trail officially starts. The first mile of the Approach Trail climbs to the top of Amicalola Falls, a 729’ waterfall. Signs alert visitors that the climb is strenuous, and it includes 604 steps before reaching the top of the falls. But the view is worth the effort!
Birdman and I set out from beneath the arch in a steady rain, making our way to the base of the falls. The stairs did little to slow our ascent as we steadily climbed to the top. By the time we reached the top of the falls, I was soaking wet. Between the rain and the sweat, every inch of my body was drenched. When we stopped, I felt a chill. Fortunately, I had anticipated getting wet and wore a different set of clothes than what I will wear tomorrow. It was a spectacular view from the top of the falls. Even with the rain, the smoky mist below had an ominous appearance. It was as if fires were filling the woods with a bluish smoke.  I’ve been here in different seasons, and the view always takes my breath away. There is no better way to begin an Appalachian Trail thru hike than by climbing to the top of Amicalola Falls on the Approach Trail. 
Tomorrow morning we continue the Approach Trail from the lodge on our way to Springer Mountain, but tonight at least, I’m in a warm bed with dry clothes. And does it ever feel good! Sometimes we need to experience hard times to make us appreciate the wonderful things we have! I must say, I am indeed blessed!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647320,"The Approach Trail is a difficult 9 mile hike from Amicalola Falls to Springer Mountain. There are plenty of hikers who opt to get a ride to Springer and begin their thru hike at the first white blaze. If so, they miss an incredible prelude to this amazing adventure. Birdman and I did the climb up the steps to the top of the falls yesterday so this morning, we set out from the lodge and immediately had a climb. I felt energized as my lungs filled with air and my heart began to pound. My legs had plenty of spring in them as we hit a steady pace. Throughout the morning, we passed multiple hikers. It was not until this afternoon that we came upon anyone who matched our pace. A young woman named Nicole matched us step for step. The only reason we stayed close was that she would stop occasionally. 
The day started out foggy but as time passed some of the fog burned off and there were occasional moments of sunlight. Birdman and I soaked in the beauty of God’s Creation, enjoying the wildlife (mostly squirrels) and the plants, of which there was such a wide variety. 
The crescendo came as we reached Springer Mountain and the first white blaze, signaling the start of the Appalachian Trail. We paused for some pictures and signed the trail register which is tucked into a drawer in a boulder. Embedded in that boulder is the marker that declares it as the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.
But Springer was not always the southern terminus. When the trail was first created, the southern terminus was about 14 miles away at Mount Oglethorpe. Over the years, as development occurred, the terminus was moved to Springer Mountain. There is currently an effort to change that and make the Appalachian Trail start at Mount Cheaha, the highest point in Alabama. Proponents claim that it was what Benton MacKay originally wanted. That is simply not true. Furthermore, to move the southern terminus would adversely impact both the Pinhot Trail and the Benton MacKaye Trail. I’ve hiked both of those trails, and they are beautiful and unique. That doesn’t need to change. Most hikers oppose moving the southern terminus from Springer, and I would hate to see the AT start anywhere else.
 From Springer Mountain, we made it to Hawk Mountain campground, where we are set up for the night. What an incredible start to our journey! However, there was one downside. Miss Nancy and I have been married for over forty years, during which we have seldom been apart from one another. Until I retired, we were never separated for more than a week. Retirement changed that as I began to do thru hikes. Even then, however, the most I had been gone at one time was two months. Until now. This morning was difficult for both of us. But she knows and understands me so well. She thankfully tolerates her obsessively driven husband when most wives would not.  But I know it hurt her to tell me good bye for the next 5-6 months.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647321,"Our second day on the AT was not short on beauty or challenges. What started as a cool overcast morning evolved into a partly sunny, gorgeous afternoon. Sassafras Mountain provided a nice test early. 
As we prepared to climb Sassafras, we heard a loud BOOM! I thought at first that some hikers had set off a cherry bomb, though it was much louder than that. Then we saw that it was a platoon of soldiers out on a maneuver. The trail crossed where they were marching, but we stopped and stood at attention as they filed by til the last soldier passed. We thanked them for their service and the freedoms we enjoy because of their sacrifice. Their packs must have weighed 75 lbs.! Sassafras Mountain wasn’t easy, but it couldn’t compare to what those service men endure to assure us freedom!
Around noon we reached Blackwell Creek and stopped for water. We have met several ridge runners on the trail. These are individuals who hike the AT assisting and educating hikers. In fact, one ridge runner met us at Woody Gap and let us know that Lance Creek, which is the campground we were planning to go tonight, was crowded and directed us to another spot near Preacher Rock. 
What a blessing that turned out to be! We enjoyed a stunning view as we had supper and relaxed. There was water nearby, and we are less than 10 miles from Neels Gap, where we have reservations tomorrow night at Blood Mountain Cabins. 
We met some wonderful people today. It was so enjoyable talking with them. In fact, it was quite difficult to break away and continue our hike. It’s the people that make a hike special. And while I may tend to stop and talk too much, I never regret meeting new friends! God bless!","Hawk Mountain Campground

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647326,"Attitude is so important. A positive attitude will overcome many obstacles. Now that we are forty miles into our hike, we are seeing a broad spectrum of attitudes exhibited by hikers. For example, this morning there was a mist so thick that water droplets continuously fell on us; it felt as if we were in a cloud. I pictured it as what the Garden of Eden was like before the fall. For me and Birdman, we were already on a cloud, loving every minute. 
As we passed hikers we commented on what a glorious day this is. Their response was varied. One gentleman’s cynical retort was that if we thought it was so wonderful, he had a bridge to sell us. But the very next hiker we passed expressed it perfectly. She said, “This is living!” Amen!
Today’s big climb was up Blood Mountain. As I understand it, the mountain is so named because of a bloody battle that took place between the Creek and Cherokee Indians before white settlers came to this area. For me and Birdman, the challenge did not turn out to be as huge as we anticipated. Our legs felt strong, and we powered up even the steepest inclines with few breaks. And no falls! 
By a little after noon, we emerged at Neels Gap. There we came to the first resupply point on the AT. Mountain Crossings is an outfitter that has just about anything a hiker could need. After some small resupply at Mountain Crossings, Birdman and I headed to Blood Mountain Cabins where we will hunker down for the next day and a half to let this winter storm pass.
By the way, as you arrive at Mountain Crossings, the first thing you notice are all the shoes hanging from the tree. The shoes supposedly belong to hikers who started the Appalachian Trail, but called it quits at Neels Gap. Based on attitude, I’m fairly certain of at least one hiker from today whose shoes will find a branch and another whose shoes will stand atop Mount Katahdin.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647366,"Completing a thru hike requires physical stamina and mental toughness, but it is also imperative to utilize common sense. Before we left Amicalola Falls on Wednesday, I had checked the weather forecast and saw the prediction for this weekend. A winter storm with record low temperatures was expected to hit Friday night. Based on that prediction, I booked a two night stay at Blood Mountain Cabins. We arrived ahead of the storm, thankful to have reservations as other hikers scrambled to find accommodations.
Things were fairly calm until after midnight. Then the wind began to howl, and I heard rain hitting the rooftop. By daylight, the rain had turned to snow. We woke to a winter wonderland. The entire landscape was covered in a soft white blanket. Trees swayed as wind in excess of 25 mph rocked them back and forth. An icy blast smacked me in the face as soon as I stepped outside this morning. Fortunately, my hiking gear is designed to keep me from feeling the chill so I was comfortable as I walked from our cabin to Mountain Crossings.
Birdman had compiled a series of videos documenting our hike from the start at Amicalola Falls so we went to Mountain Crossings since the outfitter had Wi-Fi available. As Birdman uploaded some of the videos, I resupplied for the next six days. 
I encourage you to go to Birdman’s YouTube channel, Birdman and Friends Outdoor Adventures, and follow our hike through his beautiful photos and incredible videos. I am blessed to have my own media specialist accompany me on this hike! 
Tonight’s low is predicted to be 11°, but it should warm up considerably during the day tomorrow, and it’s supposed to only reach 28° tomorrow night. Our plan is to hike out in the morning. With the time change, it gives us an extra hour of daylight before we stop hiking today. Should things change, we can always sit tight for one more day.
Again, you must use common sense. I watched this morning as seven or eight hikers headed out into blizzard conditions. And the weather didn’t improve this afternoon as the snow fell even harder. While they may have the gear to survive in this storm, my common sense tells me to err on the side of caution. Birdman and I will certainly be more comfortable tonight and much safer! Many thanks to those of you who have prayed and continue praying for our safety on this journey. God bless!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647412,"It was inevitable. After three days of hiking that involved steep slopes, muddy trail, wet rocks and technical descents, it was soon to happen.
The temperature was 16° as we left Mountain Crossings this morning around 9:00. Despite the cold, it was a gorgeous day for hiking. As it crested the mountain tops the sun shone brightly on the new fallen snow, causing it to glisten. Its backdrop was a deep blue sky that was cloudless for the first time in days. We ascended Levelland Mountain with minimal effort on fresh legs, rested and revived after yesterday’s zero. 
And it was the Lord’s Day! A spectacular Sunday morning in the Appalachian mountains. Birdman and I were singing praises as we scaled Levelland. Just past the summit, I broke into “I Stand Amazed in the Presence.” Birdman grabbed his phone to video my singing. However, just as I reached the chorus, I stepped on a patch of black ice in the trail. Suddenly, my feet shot out from under me, and I went down as if shot. I used my right hand to catch as I landed on the rocks. Fortunately, nothing was broken, but my wrist was sprained. 
I popped a couple of Advil, and we kept hiking. Even my spill couldn’t ruin an incredible day in the snowy Appalachians. We met lots of other hikers, including quite a few that we already knew. There was also trail magic, our first on the hike, delivered by Bobby at Tesnatee Gap and John at Hogpen Gap. We also met Kats, who lives now in Georgia but is from Japan. Having seen the movie, A Walk in the Woods, I enjoyed the fact that we met Kats on the AT. Nick Nolte played the role of Stephen Katz in the movie.
Just before Hogpen Gap, we met a former AT thru hiker. John had completed the Appalachian Trail in 1979, before ultralight gear and satellite navigation. It was such a pleasure to get to talk with him!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647432,"During the night I experienced some severe pain in the wrist I injured yesterday. Not only had it swelled significantly, but I had lost feeling in my fingers and was having a sensation in my palm as if it was seared by a hot iron. That settled it. I knew it needed to be x-rayed to make certain I didn’t break anything. Don’t worry; no break. Just a sprain!
Last night got down to 27° which may have contributed to my discomfort. I felt warm in my hammock, but Birdman learned that he needs to layer up on these coldest nights. Thankfully, the sun this morning melted the cold quickly. Nonetheless, Birdman and I took our time packing up. We had camped within a few feet off the trail. As hikers began to file past us, it gave us the opportunity to greet them and get acquainted better. 
One of those hikers was a young woman named Roadrunner who invited us to share her shuttle into Hiawassee, Georgia. And so I went to Chatuge Regional Hospital for x-rays, but not before receiving some amazing trail magic compliments of the First Baptist Church from Leesburg, Florida. These folks had hamburgers cooked for us with all the trimmings, cold drinks and a variety of snacks. But the best part was hearing the kids from the church cheering for us as we made our way down the trail to Unicoi Gap where they were waiting. Their warmth and generosity brought tears to this old hikers eyes. Such an unexpected blessing!
My spirit was so lifted up by the people we encountered today. Like Gracie Rogers who shuttled us to Hiawassee. A former Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff’s deputy, she hiked the AT in 2016 and now runs a shuttle for hikers. I loved her humor. She says hikers smell better, and she doesn’t have to handcuff them before she puts them in her car! 
The magic began early this morning. Because of my wrist, I was discouraged when unexpectedly, I received an email just after sunrise from Meredith Eberhart. It read: 
Steps,
Thinking of you this glorious morning!
How's it going!

Sunny brightened my day, a day that started out bad but turned out to be incredible, allowing us to make some wonderful new friends on and off the Appalachian Trail! Brighten someone’s day. You may not know how much they need it! God bless!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647495,"Birdman and I were up before 6:00 a.m. and walked over to the Main Street Grill, which was next to our hotel. I had done some checking and discovered that the locals all had breakfast there. That’s always a good sign. As Birdman and I entered the restaurant, two Town County deputy sheriffs came in behind us. One of them was Joe Yorkey who was with Ft. Walton Beach Police Department while I was an assistant state attorney there. We reminisced about old times and the great people we worked with. 
Following a breakfast of grits and eggs with a homemade biscuit and hot coffee, Birdman and I loaded our backpacks. At 8:00 a.m., Gracie Rogers pulled up and drove Roadrunner, Birdman and me back to Unicoi Gap. I had no trouble hiking despite the brace on my wrist; in fact, it gave me confidence knowing that if I were to fall, my wrist was protected. 
Today’s hike involved three big climbs, and the first one was right out of the gate. We ascended to an elevation of 3,992’ on Rocky Mountain before dropping back down to 3,117’ at Indian Grave Gap. Thereafter, we scaled two mountains over 4,000’ high. Roadrunner hiked with us all morning and was such a joy to be with! If you get a chance, check out her YouTube channel: HikingDancer. She is an incredible woman who is originally from Germany and is a ballroom dance instructor, now solo hiking the Appalachian Trail.
During the day, we encountered quite a few other hikers. Most of them stopped to camp at Dicks Creek Shelter. Birdman and I pushed on though before setting up camp at Dick’s Creek Gap. There we received some delicious trail magic from Brad and Karen Merriman who ran into us on the trail. We had a wonderful visit before they departed. Then, as we finished setting up camp, the Kentucky Krew appeared and invited us to have some supper. These folks come down each year to dish out trail magic to AT thru hikers.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647512,"After a rainy night in Georgia, Birdman and I were singing a different tune as we crossed the state line into North Carolina. Birdman serenaded me with a little Neil Diamond as we approached the sign into what was truly Sweet Caroline! 
Georgia had been a short but tough state. We endured a blizzard, a trip to the hospital and for the last two days a succession of climbs, each one higher than the last. Add to that the rain that fell half the night last night and was still coming down as we woke this morning, and we were thrilled to step into North Carolina.
Since it was raining as we packed this morning, Birdman and I took our time hitting the trail. We sat in our camp chairs under my tarp, had our coffee and quiet time and watched the raindrops fall. It slacked up a little just after 9:30 so we hiked out of Dick’s Creek Gap. . . straight up! We had slept at an elevation of 2,654’ but two quick ascents put us close to 3,700’.
Throughout the morning we hiked in a constant rain, which left us drenched despite wearing rain gear. The steep climbs caused us to sweat, soaking our clothes from the inside out. Then the wind picked up and sent a chill through our bodies, especially when we hiked along ridges or were descending and not having to exert as much energy. In an effort to keep warm, we seldom stopped but were continuously moving.
Finally, this afternoon the rain stopped, and we even got a little sun. But we had three tough climbs. The first was a 1,200’ ascent to the summit of Sharp Top, a tree covered summit just into North Carolina. The last peak was over 4,600’ near our campsite this evening. It was a shorter day than we normally hike, but after yesterday’s sixteen miles and the rain and steep climbs today, it was a relief to hike fewer miles. I’m hoping the predicted rain for tonight holds off. Regardless, we are thrilled to be in Carolina! “The good times never seemed so good!” God bless!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647565,"When we woke this morning at Muscrat Creek Gap, everything was wet. Wetter than the morning before when it rained on us half the night. You see, fog and condensation saturate both the inside and the outside, whereas rain only soaks the outside. There was a thick mist this morning as we packed our wet gear and began hiking. The cold and dampness took a toll on this old hiker’s joints. My left ankle ached and my right wrist hurt more than it had since the day after my fall. 
By mid morning though, the mist began to burn off, and sunlight illuminated the mountain peaks across from us. It’s warm rays felt good on my freezing hands and helped to counter the chill of the occasional breeze. It was also the best medicine for my achy joints as the pain soon subsided. 
A large portion of our morning was spent scaling Standing Indian Mountain. Birdman and I found the climb to our liking because, despite the 1,100’ ascent, it was not too steep. It also offered some gorgeous views. At 5,478’ high, Standing Indian Mountain is our highest point yet on the Appalachian Trail.
Around 2:00 p.m. we came to Beech Gap. There is a large campground with lots of open areas that were filled with sunshine when we arrived. Birdman and I stopped and spread all of our wet gear out in the sun to dry. As the moisture evaporated from his tent, my tarp and a multitude of other items, we set up our camp chairs and ate lunch. Birdman hung his shirt on a limb to dry. As he reclined shirtless in the Beech Gap sun, we joked that no one would ever believe how we had spent this afternoon on the AT. So I snapped a photograph to document our day at the Beech! God bless!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647572,"Condensation again soaked our gear during the night but didn’t slow us this morning as we packed and hit the trail by 7:30. We had plenty of motivation: a tough climb, a pending storm front and a ride into Franklin with new friends who are letting us stay with them.
The summit. Two and a half miles from camp was our most intense climb so far on the AT. And I mean climb! I had to use both my hands and legs to reach the summit of Albert Mountain. As Birdman and I reached a road .2 miles from the summit, I checked the elevation profile in my FarOut app. It went straight up! Some of the rocks were wet which made it difficult to get good footing. The slow, tedious ascent would have been worth the effort had it not been for the fog. At the peak was a fire tower and a geological survey marker. Based on the information board, on a clear day you can see several landmarks, including Rabun Bald, the second highest peak in Georgia.
Birdman and I pushed our pace slightly since we knew rain was forecast this afternoon. However, we still took the time to speak with some of the wonderful people we met today. There was Brett, a young man from Savannah, Georgia with substantial hiking experience and lots of ability. He caught and passed us with ease but not before we got to visit while we refilled our water bottles. We next exchanged a “Roll Tide” with Appalachian Trail ambassadors, Litho and Just Ann, once we found out they are Bama fans. Based on her wealth of knowledge about the trail, I believe Ask Ann is a more fitting moniker. Then, just before Rock Gap we came up on Lancelot, an AT thru hiker from Michigan.
The storm: There was a tent set up with trail magic at Rock Gap when we arrived at noon. Birdman and I stopped only to put on our rain gear. Severe thunderstorms were expected in 30 minutes to an hour. With 3.5 miles to Winding Stair Gap, we pushed on. The last three of those miles were quite difficult as rain and some sleet battered us. Thunder repeatedly rumbled above us. The wind was in excess of 30 mph and driving the precipitation sideways into us. My face and hands got numb from the cold, yet Birdman and I enjoyed the entire ordeal. For me, it brought back memories of pulling turnips on our farm with Daddy as I grew up. It was occasionally under similar conditions. We slogged down the trail for the last mile to meet Katie and Kenny, who were waiting for us, and threw our packs in their truck.
The selfless couple: Katie and Kenny live just outside Franklin, North Carolina, a trail town which I hiked through on the Bartram Trail in 2020. This amazing couple picked us up in the rain. They even brought towels so we could dry off. Their generosity then went far beyond what I could have imagined. These sweet people opened the cabin next to their home to a pair of soggy, smelly hikers. Katie did our filthy laundry, and Kenny grilled us a delicious steak for dinner..

They not only did our laundry and fed us supper, but this morning a full breakfast was waiting on us. This feast included grits and eggs, sausage, juice, coffee, milk, cantaloupe, grapes and toasted Cuban bread that they brought back from Tampa. I may have put back the weight I had lost since we started! And they warned us that a spaghetti supper awaits us tonight. I’m not sure I’ll have to cook on the trail for the next 2 days! The love they have shown us simply blows me away. Taking in two complete strangers who now count Katie and Kenny as our close friends.
As I usually do, I found a connection with both of them. Kenny grew up in Tampa, went to Chamberlain High School and his mother worked for GTE. She was with GTE at the same time as my wife, Nancy, who was living in the Tampa Westshore area when we met and started dating. Katie went to college at Ole Miss and coached baseball at Bill Bond in Pensacola. My good friend, Judge John Simon, grew up in Pensacola and played baseball at Ole Miss while Katie was there. John’s son played at Bill Bond; Katie’s son played baseball at Pensacola Catholic where John Simon played high school ball. It’s as if I’ve been tied to Katie and Kenny for years and just didn’t get a chance to meet til now.
While Birdman worked on his videos today, Katie and Kenny let me take their Jeep and drive into Franklin. I stopped by Outdoor 76 to grab a couple of items at the outfitter’s. Then I located the library and brought Birdman here to upload his videos. He delighted in the fact that we drove down Siler Road to get to the library which is on Siler Farm Road. As we sit in the library, Birdman (Jack Siler) joked that he should ask the librarian if he is entitled to some perk because of his name. I assured him he was: “They will let you check out any book for free.”
If you haven’t seen Birdman’s videos documenting our Appalachian Trail thru hike, I encourage you to go to YouTube and find Birdman and Friends Outdoor Adventures. He spends a great amount of time, not only filming and photographing the journey, but compiling, editing and uploading them as well. Aside from walking the AT alongside us, I can think of no better way to experience what we are seeing and living. I know you will be blessed.

Our brief stay recharged us and let us recover from Friday’s drenching as we were able to dry everything out. Katie and Kenny dropped us off at Winding Stair Gap about 8:15, and we began an immediate climb. Today’s hike had two high points, literally!
The first was Siler Bald with an elevation of 5,207’. It held special significance with Birdman since Siler is his last name. His family had visited Siler Bald years ago and today’s climb stirred old memories. You must take a blue blaze to get to the top of Siler Bald, meaning you turn off on a side trail off the AT to get to it. The extra mileage was worth it though. We had gorgeous views since there were no clouds. The only negative was the freezing wind which was blowing at least 30 mph. After a brief photo session, we headed back down to the Appalachian Trail. 
The next high point we Wayah Bald which stands 5,337’ high. On top is a stone observation tower and picnic area. From the tower you can see four states, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The clear view allowed us to see Clingman’s Dome, the highest point of the AT. We sat in our camp chairs and had lunch protected from the wind by the massive stone tower. Two years ago, I had hiked part of this trail and stood atop the observation tower as I thru hiked the Bartram Trail. 
Before leaving Wayah Bald, we were informed that a controlled burn is scheduled to take place tomorrow from there to Burningtown Gap, a distance of a little over four miles. I thought it humorous that the burn was to Burningtown Gap. Birdman and I pushed past Burningtown and stopped tonight at Cold Creek Shelter. It’s expected to get down in the low 20’s tonight so I hope to stay warm. We should reach the Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow. God bless!The stone tower on Wayah Bald","Franklin, North Carolina 
",Cold Creek Shelter,"Mar 20, Sun",15.81
Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647695,"Without question, this was my toughest day since we started. Even though it was only 11 1/2 miles, I am more exhausted this evening than I’ve been. 
Last night’s low was near 20°. Cold Creek Shelter had several campsites along a ridge. The wind was strong, probably 15 mph out of the northwest, so I set up my tarp to give me maximum protection from it. What I failed to anticipate was a shift in the direction during the night so that it began blowing from the east. Fortunately, my gear kept me warm, so warm that I didn’t want to get out of my quilt at 6:00 a.m. 
It was worth getting up though.  Birdman and I had coffee and took in an incredible sunrise during our quiet time. In the distance we could see lights of a town below and yellow and orange hues above on the horizon. I was thankful that the weather warmed up quickly. In fact, by 11:00 a.m. I was hiking in short sleeves. Temperatures got into the 70’s today.
We climbed to the top of Wesser Bald by lunch time. A short side trail led to a metal observation tower with a large open deck. The views from the tower were breathtaking. We were able to see the smoke from the controlled burn between Wayah Bald and Burningtown Gap rising in the distance. The tower gave us the opportunity to gaze down on rocky ridges and tree covered mountains, lots of them in every direction! From that perspective you sense the vastness and beauty of God’s Creation.
While on Wesser Bald, we met three other thru hikers, Renaissance Man, Pace and Terrapin, veterans making their way to Mount Katahdin. As Americans, we owe so much to these men and others like them who have helped guarantee our freedom. Renaissance Man shared with us some of his brushes with death while serving in Iraq. I couldn’t help but think about the dangers that a thru hike involves and how minuscule those dangers are to what these men have faced. 
Leaving Wesser Bald the trail got extremely difficult for me. It was very technical with lots of rocks and roots and a steep decline that was nearly straight down in places. I know that at my age I can’t go fast on such trail, even though it’s my tendency to push the pace. This part of the trail also had a lot of exposure. In other words, you were alongside a sheer drop on either or both sides. One misstep could be fatal. And so I took my time. On one occasion, I had to sit down on a boulder to be able to step down to the next one. My calculated arrival at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) was pushed to the limit as we arrived at 3:00 p.m., my latest projected time.
There we had a delicious meal at the River’s End Restaurant before heading to our hostel for the night. During supper we visited with Moon and Stelios, a couple of other thru hikers we had met earlier. Great young guys and strong hikers.  And as Birdman and I emerged from the restaurant, we ran into Renaissance Man, Pace and Terrapin who had just made it down from Wesser Bald safely. They immediately got a place for the night and headed to the restaurant for a well-deserved supper. God bless!

Unfortunately, I’ve not had a chance to see but a couple because we hike all day, and I spend the evening writing until I fall asleep. I can say that the ones I’ve watched are terrific. You can find them at Birdman and Friends Outdoor Adventures.
At breakfast I met a 58 year old hiker named Legend who said that he started the AT with a 60 lb. pack. At Neels Gap he sent some of the gear home, and he got rid of some more after reaching the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Legend felt that ultralight gear was for young people but is finding out that everyone benefits from a lighter pack. It is remarkable that he has come this far with such weight, but he is very determined and is learning as he goes.
This morning we left the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) a little after 7:30. From there it was a steady climb for eight miles until we reached Cheoah Bald. The views from the top are exquisite, looking down on surrounding mountains with the smoky blue haze embracing them. When my nephew, Jody, and I hiked the Bartram Trail, we got up before daylight and hiked to Cheoah Bald to watch the sunrise as we had breakfast. The palette of colors in that morning sky is something I’ll never forget. Today, Birdman and I sat on Cheoah Bald and ate lunch watching the clouds move across a Carolina blue sky. One of these days I’ll return for a sunset at supper time.
Not long before we camped, Birdman and I met a southbound day hiker named Crockett. What is remarkable about Crockett is that he is legally blind. He is the second blind hiker I’ve met. Trevor Thomas (aka Zero/Zero) hiked the entire Appalachian Trail after losing his eyesight and continues to rack up miles on the trail.  I met him and his guide dog, Tennille, at a trailhead on the Collegiate Peaks Loop. The courage of these men is phenomenal.
At the shelter tonight were several other hikers, including Phantom and Wrong Way, a couple of great guys who have been leap frogging us. They are much faster than this old man, though I’m pleased with our pace. I have to admit my legs are exhausted this evening. We not only hiked to Cheoah Bald at more than 5,000’ of elevation, but had several other climbs and descents that gave my legs what I deemed a “controlled burn” today. The ascent from Stecoah Gap left me ready to collapse in my hammock. Rain is on its way and should arrive during the night. Meanwhile, I’ll sleep well!

I haven’t been that tired after any day of hiking since we started. The rain continued to fall as Birdman and I had our coffee and quiet time under my tarp. There was still a drizzle as we packed up and left the campsite. Though it had been predicted to rain til mid afternoon, the rain ceased soon after we hit the trail. Unfortunately, the wind only got stronger.
I can usually estimate our arrival times by figuring the distance we intend to go along with my projection of our pace. I rarely miss; however, today we arrived fifteen minutes later than I had estimated. This was due to several factors: (1) the trail was extremely muddy and slippery from all the rain, (2) there were lots of rocks which required me to be more cautious (3) high winds battered us all day with gusts over 50 mph on the ridges and (4) I didn’t have as much energy due to yesterday’s hard effort. The mighty winds were particularly disconcerting, blowing me off balance at times and often making it feel as though I were standing still as I pressed headlong  into the gusts.
Despite these impediments, Birdman and I arrived safely at Fontana Marina where we caught a shuttle to the Fontana Village Resort. We even scored some trail magic as we got to the marina. A cooler had been left by a trail angel and inside were two ice cold Mountain Dews! That made my day. Thank you so much to the trail angel for your timely generosity!
We were able to dry out our gear, clean ourselves and our clothes and have a delicious supper. The plan is to enter Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) in the morning. I’ve been watching the weather closely, especially since some snow was forecast for the weekend. Once you enter the Smokies, there is no bail out point if a snowstorm hits and the road to Newfound Gap is closed. Right now it appears to be just rain with maybe a few flurries so Birdman and I will continue with hopes to hike across the GSMNP in six days. Please pray for fair weather.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647795,"Birdman and I caught the shuttle from the Fontana Village Resort back to the trail this morning at 9:00. The resort was a much needed respite. We were able to dry out our gear, do some light laundry, charge our electronics, resupply, take a hot shower,  eat a good meal and sleep in a warm bed. In addition, Birdman was able to upload his latest YouTube videos.
The trail this morning took us by one of the largest shelters on the AT. Known as the Fontana Hilton, this shelter has indoor plumbing, trash bins and showers nearby. It was nearly a full house last night according to Marina and Olivia, two hikers who stayed there.
As we made our way toward Fontana Dam, I thought back three years ago when I finished my Benton MacKaye thru hike and came back here with my wife. We walked along the rock wall and looked out over the lake before driving across Fontana Dam, the largest dam east of the Rockies. It was a special time together and just happened to be on my 63rd birthday. Fond memories!
Birdman and I walked across the dam just as Robert Redford and Nick Nolte had done in the movie, A Walk in the Woods. The Fontana Dam offers spectacular views of the lake and the power plant below the dam. It is 480 feet high and has a road on top that allows cars to drive across it. However, Birdman and I hiked across. 
Once across the dam, we followed a winding road up to the trailhead leading into Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). At the trailhead was a metal box where we both inserted the bottom half of our permits to hike the AT through GSMNP. You must purchase the permit within 30 days of entering the park on your thru hike. On the date you enter, you write that date on the permit and drop it in the box. You have eight days from that date to hike through the Park. When you exit, you place the top half in a box on the other side of the Park.
Around noon, we got to a peak known as Shuckstack with an old fire tower that allows views of the Smokies for miles and miles. There was a chilling wind, but Birdman and I scaled the metal fire tower to behold the Smokies from a unique perspective that few people see. However, I would not recommend that anyone with a fear of heights climb the tower, particularly on a windy day. It could be a little unnerving. A chimney stands next to the tower, the remains of a fire warden’s cabin. 
What a welcome we had to this great National Park where we will spend the next six days hiking across it. Praying the weather doesn’t get too bad. The forecast calls for possible snow flurries over the next two days. God bless!","Fontana Village Resort

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648015,"Any thru hike is filled with ups and downs. From the physical side there will be some occasions when you are at peak fitness, able to push your limits, but on other days aches and injuries hold you back. On those days you must recognize your limitations and stay within yourself. Emotionally there are times you feel on top of the world, ready to tackle any challenge whereas some days you will want to quit and go home. 
Today was full of ups and downs . . . of all kinds. First, the trail itself presented a continuous series of peaks and valleys. At least for today, gone were the hikes along ridge lines or the gradual elevation changes from one mountain top to another. Instead, Birdman and I hiked repetitious climbs and descents, each extremely steep and filled with rocks and roots. We were forced to go slow and steady.
At least it was made easier this morning when we found ourselves hiking along with another thru hiker. Tim is from Maine and is northbound to his home state. It was a delight to share our thoughts and beliefs as we made our way up the trail. I’m always amazed at how God brings certain individuals into our lives, some very briefly. Yet the imprint they leave can be impactful.
The day we climbed Cheoah Bald, I pushed myself. I felt energized that day and powered up one incline after another. But I paid a price. My right Achilles’ tendon has been a little sore since then, forcing me to slow my pace and shorten our daily distance to avoid an injury. Birdman and I both are driven, but to complete this hike, we must recognize our limitations and stay healthy. At this point, I see nothing that will preclude us from reaching Mount Katahdin except for injury.
We reached the summit of Rocky Top today. It lived up to its name, but the views were amazing! I stood and looked back at where we came from: Fontana Dam, Shuckstack. We shared this view with a young lady named Emily from East Tennessee who is also thru hiking.
As I lie here in my hammock, I can see my breath. The temperature never got out of the 30’s today. There were even a few small flurries of snow mixed with sleet. More snow is predicted for tomorrow morning with a low in the teens at elevation. As much as I dislike the cold, it will not deter me. I see it as just part of the ups and downs that come with any thru hike. Beyond this cold front will be warmer weather that is ideal for hiking. Just as in life, there will be ups and downs, so keep hiking! God bless!","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648016,"Around 2:00 a.m. I heard the sound of it hitting my tarp, not snow as predicted, but sleet. When we woke this morning, Birdman and I found a dusting of sleet all across the ground. It was very cold last night; my guess would be the upper teens. The wind chill, however, was near zero. Gusts up to 50 mph made me afraid the stakes of my tarp might be snatched from the ground. And the fierce winds raged all day long. At times we stopped hiking until the icy blasts subsided enough for us to continue. Beneath our feet we heard the crunch of the sleet that had collected in the trail, mindful that it could also be slippery. The sun did break through and give some relief; in fact, without the wind it would have been ideal hiking weather. 
Today’s highlight was hiking up Clingman’s Dome. Birdman and I had both driven the road up to Clingman’s with our families, but this time it was different. The thrill of scaling Tennessee’s highest peak and the highest point on the Appalachian Trail was moving for us both. For me it summoned memories of my children running up the path to the tower when they were small. Yes, Clingman’s Dome is a special place for me and Birdman, and we had it all to ourselves! There were no tourists, just complete solitude. The sky was clear which afforded incredible views. Evergreens were flocked in a canopy of white, a mix of sleet and snow. The landscape was reminiscent of a Currier and Ives Christmas card, except that we could smell the scent of spruce and fir.
Birdman and I climbed the tower on Clingman’s but couldn’t stay long. He lasted longer than I did. The cold wind chilled me to the bone. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our time there. It also marked several milestones as we have now hiked over 200 miles on the AT and stepped into our third state (Tennessee) as we continue northbound on the Appalachian Trail. 
All day I thought of my son, Brad, who started early this morning running the Georgia Death Race, an ultramarathon that starts at Vogel State Park in north Georgia and ends 74 miles later at Amicalola Falls where our hike began. I know the terrain and how difficult this race is. I regret not being able to crew him for this race as I’ve done on his two previous 100 mile ultras. Unfortunately, with no cell service I can’t even track his progress. By now he should be half way through and will run through the night. You are in my prayers, Brad. Run strong, son! God bless!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648018,"Last night was the coldest we’ve had on the trail. Definitely in the teens. And the wind! Still gusting over 50 mph. But none of that could keep us from having an incredible day. 
It was only about 5 miles from the shelter where we stayed last night to Newfound Gap on the Tennessee/North Carolina line. As soon as we crossed the highway, Packrat, a trail angel, approached and offered us some snacks and a Mountain Dew. I couldn’t pass up the Mountain Dew. We sat down behind the stone wall to get out of the wind. Minutes later more trail angels, known as the Kentucky Krewe, brought us more trail magic. They had previously fed us at Dicks Creek. Finally, Aaron and Sarah filled our water bottles and gave us fresh fruit and snacks to carry with us. They had also driven from Kentucky to assist thru hikers. These people are awesome! Their generous acts rejuvenated me and Birdman and touched our hearts with their kindness. Thank you so much!
As soon as we reached Newfound Gap, I checked for a cell signal and was able to call my son, Brad. Knowing how the weather had been, I was concerned about him running the Georgia Death Race, especially without a crew. I was so relieved to learn he finished the 74 mile ultra in 21 hours 42 minutes, starting at Vogel State Park yesterday and finishing at Amicalola Falls early this morning. Congratulations, Brad; I’m so proud of you!
Through the day, Birdman and I met lots of day hikers and a few section hikers, but by mid afternoon we had the trail all to ourselves. The solitude was wonderful as we hiked along ridges with sheer drops on both sides offering magnificent views. Of course, I was cautious not to take a wrong step, which is easy to do when trying to gaze to your left or right while hiking. Instead, Birdman and I made frequent stops to behold the beauty of the Creation. 
I searched for a single word to describe our day. The one most apt is the word “majestic.” In so many things today we witnessed God’s majesty. From ice crystals bursting forth from the ground and icicles, some twelve inches and longer, dangling from rocky mountain ledges. To forested peaks and ridges cloaked in the smoky blue mist far below us. And finally a peregrine falcon perched high on a limb scanning the abyss below for prey and seeing him take flight and soar across a cloudless sky. In all these things we saw the majesty of the One who made them. What an amazing day! God bless!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648019,"Despite putting my water bottles in the shelf of my hammock last night, the water in them was frozen this morning. There was just enough liquid in one to make my coffee. The rest was as hard as a rock. Our temperature last night seemed to be the coldest yet. However, I am thankful for the weather we’ve had through the Smokies. The cold, crisp air has given us clear views of breathtaking vistas. In Georgia, where we enjoyed more temperate conditions, days were often filled with a mist or dense fog. Consequently, we missed some of the gorgeous views the Peach State has to offer. 
For us, much of today was again spent hiking along ridges that afforded spectacular views. The Smoky Mountains truly lived up to their name today. Since entering the Park on Thursday, I don’t believe I’ve seen such a deep blue haze as enveloped the peaks and ridges of the Appalachians today. It’s sad to think that Birdman and I will leave the Great Smoky Mountain National Park tomorrow, but we will carry with us a volume of unforgettable memories. 
One of the sweetest of those memories occurred this afternoon as Birdman and I arrived at Cosby Knob Shelter. Four years ago during my first thru hike, thunderstorms with possible tornadoes passed through Alabama. Nathan Wright from the Pinhoti Outdoor Center picked me and three other hikers up from the Pinhoti Trail and took us to a hotel in Sylacauga. I shared a room with one of the hikers, Bill Bush, who is better known by his trail name, Bushwhacker. Bushwhacker and I have been friends since.
In 2020 as I was thru hiking the Florida Trail, I looked up one evening, and there was Bushwhacker headed southbound coming down the trail towards me. We didn’t get to visit long because mosquitoes attacked us with a vengeance, but it was wonderful to see Bushwhacker again.
As Birdman and I walked into the Cosby Knob Shelter this afternoon, there stood my dear friend again. It was an emotional moment for us both. Neither of us knew the other was planning to hike the Appalachian Trail yet here we stood . . . . again face to face. It’s as if the Lord puts us on the same paths at the same time and then arranges for us to meet. Birdman and I are staying here at the shelter tonight while Bushwhacker pushed on. But I know we will see each other again. Somewhere down the trail. Safe hiking my friend and God bless!","Peck’s Corner Shelter

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648031,"After four days of bitter cold and biting wind, Birdman and I received a reprieve from the weather. It was cool but pleasant as we started our last day in Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GSMNP), very similar to the weather we enjoyed last Thursday as we entered the Park. Most of the day was spent hiking downhill as we went from around 5,000’ elevation to less and 1,500’.
The highlight of the morning was not on the Appalachian Trail but on a side trail just over a half mile off the AT. Birdman and I dropped our packs and hiked 6/10’s of a mile to Mount Cammerer where there is an old fire tower that was built by the Civil Conservation Corps back in the 1930’s. The bonus miles were worth it. From the tower we had an unobstructed 360° view of the Smoky Mountains and the bluish haze that embraces them. I would love to return in the fall to witness the Autumn colors in this panoramic display. We were greeted with a fire tower (Shuckstack) as we entered Great Smoky Mountains National Park and were bid farewell by another (Mt. Cammerer) as we exited. Both had exceptional views of the surrounding areas.
Soon after we hiked out of the Park and just before reaching I-40, I met a man on the AT wearing a UPS uniform. I thought it a strange coincidence because of what happened two and a half years ago when I hiked the Benton MacKaye Trail. My nephew had hiked the 100 miles through GSMNP with me. As he and I were on the paved road along the river, we saw a man in a UPS uniform walking along the road as well. So today, when I stopped to photograph a waterfall, this man caught up to me, and I told him about my encounter in 2019. He said, “You had a young guy with you and y’all went and sat up on the bank (by the Interstate) to wait for your ride.” He was absolutely right! His name is Mike Wenke, and he parks his UPS truck at lunch and walks either down the road by the Pigeon River or up the Appalachian Trail. On October 15, 2019 and again today, I happened to arrive at that location between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m. Furthermore, two years ago Wenke, as he’s called, happened to walk by the river, the same path I came in on. And today he chose the other direction and went up the Appalachian Trail, which is where I was this time. Perhaps it was mere coincidence, but he and I both agreed that God had a purpose for our meeting. As I handed him one of our cards, Wenke assured me he will be following our hike to Maine. Thanks to our chance encounter, I got to meet and talk with this fine man and gained a new friend.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648081,"Just as I was falling asleep last night, I received a hiker alert on my phone from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. It said that Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) officials planned to close several roads across the park in preparation for expected high winds today (March 30). The National Weather Service had issued a High Wind Warning for the mountains and several roads through the park, including Newfound Gap Road would begin closing after 10:00 a.m. today. While the Appalachian Trail remained open, visitors were asked to avoid hiking during this time, particularly in areas with standing dead trees. 
Wow! Birdman and I finished the Smokies just in time. We thought 50 mph winds were bad. They were calling for 75 mph today! That’s hurricane strength. How blessed we are to be safe with friends in their home in Laurel Park, N.C.
Since yesterday afternoon, Birdman and I have been enjoying the hospitality of two wonderful friends, Tom and Dee, who have both hiked a major portion of the AT. During the winter they reside in the Destin area and volunteer to help maintain the Florida Trail. When they learned of our intent to hike the AT, Tom and Dee invited us to stay with them when we got to I-40.
Tom picked us up and drove us to their home where we spent last night after a delicious supper Tom prepared. After feeding us breakfast, they spent the morning and early afternoon working in their church’s community garden, which last year produced 3,100 lbs of food to feed those in need. What a labor of love! So they gave us the keys to their car which enabled us to resupply, refill my prescriptions and make a few necessary stops to address some electronics issues.
Birdman and I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute with them. They even sat down this afternoon and took the time to help me plan ahead for places to stay and eat. Their familiarity with the AT from here to Harper’s Ferry was invaluable. Though we had intended to return to the trail early in the morning, it doesn’t appear that the storm front will move through until late morning. Because of that, we will delay hiking until the afternoon. That will also allow us to spend a few more hours with this sweet couple. God bless!Jumping Off Rock at Sunset","Laurel Park, NC

Strong gusts beat against the side of the house and whipped through the trees. I simply pulled the covers around me and said, “Thank you, Lord,” for my friends, Tom and Dee, who gave us not only shelter but food, transportation, laundry and much more the past day and a half.  If not for them, Birdman and I would have likely been battling the elements in a hammock and a tent.
It was a bittersweet departure as Tom and Dee returned me and Birdman to the AT trailhead on I-40 around noon. Part of us wanted to stay and visit longer while the wanderlust inside us yearned for the trail.
The weather this afternoon made hiking such a pleasure. The sun was out. Temperatures were in the high 60’s with a light, cool breeze. The only negative was a soreness that has developed in the tendon above my ankle on the outside of my right leg. I had hoped being off the trail for a day would eliminate the pain. Instead, it had increased. The solution is simple: Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (RICE). All are hard to do on a thru hike though I have my leg elevated in my hammock right now.
During the afternoon Birdman and I hiked with a young lady whose trail name is Polaris. She is from New Hampshire and just graduated from Liberty University with a degree in journalism. I love her trail name and it fits her so well. Not only does she have an interest in the stars and is currently headed in a northerly direction, but she is truly a light in the darkness, pointing towards the Bright Morning Star. It was refreshing to talk with this young believer. I admire her courage: hiking the 2,000 mile Appalachian Trail by herself and being unafraid to take a stand for Jesus Christ. She continued on when Birdman and I stopped for the evening, but hopefully we will meet again on the AT. If not, we shall see one another again some day. Till then, Birdman and I will be praying for her safe travels. Hike on, Polaris! God bless!","I-40 / Laurel Park, NC

My ankle was better this morning. I took a Vitamin I (Ibuprofen) before going to bed and again this morning. Today I slowed my pace and was careful how I stepped to keep from straining the ligaments. What I did seemed to work. There was less pain, and we still managed to put in a seventeen mile day. 
Late morning I came to Max Patch Road and found trail magic. French Press had hiked the AT last year, and he decided to drive down from Kentucky and do some trail magic. It was awesome! The back of his truck was filled with an assortment of fruit (apples, tangerines), snacks (chips, donuts) and drinks (sodas, beer, coffee). Polaris was there when I arrived and Emaleigh, who now has a trail name: E.T., showed up shortly thereafter. 
Polaris & E.T.
Max Patch is a grassy bald, a mountain summit devoid of trees and covered in native grasses where you would expect to find trees growing. It is a popular landmark on the Appalachian Trail because of its 360° views of the surrounding mountains, including the Great Smoky Mountains. Sadly, visitors to Max Patch had trampled and trashed this beautiful mountaintop, forcing the U.S. Forest Service to close the bald to camping, fires and other uses for two years. It appears to be working as the area looks to be recovering. We were fortunate today to have a clear view from Max Patch. I caught up with Polaris and E.T. at the summit and took several photographs before the strong winds forced us to head down. E.T. and Polaris reach the summit of Max Patch
I hiked a good part of the afternoon with E.T. and Polaris. These are two tough, fascinating young ladies, both in their 20’s. I was grateful that they would honor this old man by allowing me to hike along with them. Each is hiking solo, but they seem to have formed a bond between them, which is wonderful. Having someone to hike with, just as I have Birdman, is a real comfort and provides another person to share in the experience. And two are always stronger than one! When Birdman and I stopped for the evening to camp, these two ladies continued on, planning to hike about six more miles before they stop for the evening. Like I said, these are two tough ladies.

Never realize that someone has to maintain the trail or it would soon become wilderness once again and become impassable. As a maintainer of the Florida Trail, I pay close attention to the condition of the trails I hike. Silently critiquing the quality of the trail and its maintainers. (I can’t help it.)
So far I have been very impressed with the condition of the Appalachian Trail. Of course, it receives an enormous amount of foot traffic. To a certain extent, the more a trail is hiked, the easier it is to maintain. Trails with little to no foot traffic often become overgrown with plant life, particularly in Florida. In the other hand, the large volume of hikers such as trek the AT, presents a completely different set of issues.  The trail becomes worn, all those hikers must have somewhere to sleep and go to the bathroom and the trash they generate must be disposed of. I’ve been impressed with how the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the groups who tend to the trail have dealt with these and other issues.
Leave No Trace (LNT) - Before anyone heads out to hike a trail, they should familiarize themselves with Leave No Trace principles. Whatever I carry into the woods, I carry out and that includes soiled toilet paper. During this hike, I’ve noticed very little trash along the trail. Either most people are following LNT or someone is dutifully picking up whatever is left behind. On just one occasion (in the Smokies) did I find where hikers were not burying their human waste. C’mon, it’s not that hard to dig a cathole!
Yesterday Birdman and I came upon two groups of trail maintainers. On the Florida Trail, our work typically involves the use of mowers and loppers. Here in the mountains, mowers are not practical and maintainers face different problems such as enormous blowdowns and poor drainage. Volunteers cleared this huge blowdown.

I noticed the volunteers carrying hoes and Pulaskis (a tool that combines an axe and an adz on one head). These were being used to create drainage routes for water to run off the trail instead of down it. I also noticed where some of the sloped portions of trail were made more level to prevent hikers from slipping off into a ravine.
Trail maintainers, Meaghan and Drew
This morning Birdman and I ran into Meaghan and Drew, two of the volunteers we met yesterday. Today they were simply enjoying the fruit of their labor by hiking the trail they love and care for. I’m so grateful to these folks and the work they do, without compensation, because without them we would not be able to hike the Appalachian Trail. Thank you and God bless!

Sunday morning in Hot Springs, North Carolina and a perfect day to be in the Lord’s House. Birdman and I had breakfast from the Hillbilly Market before attending Sunday School and worship at Hot Springs First Baptist Church. We felt right at home with these wonderful believers. Pastor Bill Higgins’ expository message focused on the Savior’s role as our Shepherd and His coming to bring us abundant life. I was certainly blessed by the singing, the preaching and the fellowship. We were also each given a loaf of delicious home baked banana bread. My thanks to the folks at Hot Springs FBC for making us feel so welcome!
Birdman and I did not leave Hot Springs today because my peritoneal tendon is still inflamed. Rather than head back to the trail, I plan to rest for the next two days. In addition, I continue to apply ice, take Ibuprofen and have purchased an ankle brace to help provide stability. On the advice of my daughter, who is a physician’s assistant, I also added insoles to my shoes for some additional support.
As a runner I have probably suffered most of the maladies that accompany the pounding inherent in that sport. So this is nothing new to me. I’ve even had peritoneal tendinitis before.

She completed the 2,200 mile journey in 46 days, 11 hours and 20 minutes. To give some perspective, Birdman and I have been on the AT for 27 days and have travelled a total of 286 miles. Though her FKT has been broken, Jennifer remains a tremendous supporter of trails and hiking. She is an accomplished author and speaker, the National Geographic Adventurer of the Year and an Ambassador for the American Hiking Society. I’ve read two of her books, Becoming Odyssa, about her 2005 AT thru hike, and The Pursuit of Endurance, which gives insight into what it takes to achieve long distance greatness.

As an attorney, I am fascinated by the contrasting courtroom styles of different lawyers. As a sports fan, I’m intrigued when watching teams face each other with contrasting styles of play. Yet, I’m lying in my hammock still blown away, literally, by the contrast of our morning and our afternoon. 
Morning: Following a good night’s sleep, I woke this morning feeling eager to return to the trail. My ankle was pain free for the first time in nearly a week; however, I continue to wear the brace on it. Birdman and I walked in the darkness to the Smoky Mountain Diner. The light breeze gave the morning air a slight chill, but it certainly wasn’t cold. The overcast sky would make for excellent hiking weather. First, however, I downed an order of pancakes, two scrambled eggs, three strips of crispy bacon and a cup of coffee that our waitress topped off every time it ran low. Birdman ate his fill as well. We enjoyed the company of Tim, who had hiked with us previously.
So Birdman and I crossed the bridge over the French Broad River out of Hot Springs on fresh legs and full stomachs. Life couldn’t get much better. Even the steep climb along the river was rewarding with glimpses of the town and river bathed in the sun’s soft morning light. My pace was measured to keep from aggravating the tendons in my ankle. Birdman would at times drop back to capture a video or photograph but would soon catch back up.
Just before noon, we reached the Rich Mountain Fire Tower. A short side trail took us to the tower, which I would describe as a modern one-room structure with a surrounding deck situated on metal girders that resemble an Erector set. Scaling the metal stairs led to a 360° view of the distant mountains, all covered in a bluish haze.
 Rich Mountain Fire Tower
Afternoon: Just after getting back on the AT after the fire tower, we met Tim and Bushwhacker. They had taken a shuttle and were dropped off at Allen Gap. They were slack packing (carrying lighter packs) back to Hot Springs where they will spend the night. 
Soon after meeting them, the wind picked up, and we put on our rain gear. We knew rain was forecast to start around 1:00. It was 1:15 when I felt the first drops. With nearly two miles to the shelter, Birdman and I hiked on in the rain. It was falling steady when we reached Spring Mountain Shelter. By then the temperature had begun to drop, making me cold. Birdman threw up his tent and dove in. I hung my tarp and hammock, stripped out of my wet clothes and climbed into my hammock warm and dry.
Since then I have lain here listening to the wind whip and the rain pound against my tarp. Thankfully, I staked it down well or it would have been dislodged by some of these strong gusts. The roar of the wind has been deafening at times. There was even one loud crash of thunder. Plus, the temperature is still dropping.
All this angry, chaotic weather stands in stark contrast to what we enjoyed this morning. To the stillness we experienced as we climbed high above the French Broad River. From that lofty pinnacle, it was the silence that I noticed. Peace and quiet, no revved engines, no raised voices and no rushing winds. Just silence.

There were no more rude awakenings. And in the morning light, I even found the one I had lost.
After breakfast and my quiet time, I packed up all my wet gear; it was all wet. That’s a common occurrence when thru hiking. On the Florida Trail nearly every morning greeted me with wet gear because of the humidity. The solution is to find some time during the day when the sun is out to lay everything out and let it dry. Today, though, the sun made only brief appearances. So I determined our best option was to get to camp as early as possible and hope for a little sunshine. Things worked out perfectly. Birdman and I arrived at Jerry’s Cabin Shelter about 4:20 p.m. and set up our tent and hammock. We then laid out whatever was wet or damp, and by the time we filtered water and fixed supper it was dry.
I’m sitting in my camp chair relaxing as I write my journal this evening. To watch the sunlight gradually creep up the trees as the sun sets behind me, relaxes me as I write. More showers are predicted tonight but haven’t started yet. The last I saw, Friday and Saturday will bring a mixture of rain and snow. Birdman and I will hike through it in hopes of reaching Erwin, Tennessee by Saturday evening.
Early this morning I met Stumpknocker. When I began to post on Trail Journals, Stumpknocker was the first to comment as I started my thru hike of the Florida Trail. He is an experienced hiker and is again hiking from Georgia to Maine. I also met Tonka and his four-legged hiking companion, Gracie. Tonka served on the USS Maine, a Navy ballistic-missile submarine and is on his way to the state for which it is named. Thank you for your service, Tonka. Safe travels, my friends!

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648450,"There was a distant rumble as I lay in my hammock about 9:00 p.m. last night. I waited and listened for a second which followed less than a minute later. Lying there in the dark, I witnessed the sky light up as a severe thunderstorm struck. One bolt of lightning was far too close for comfort, less than a mile away by my estimation. The first gusts of wind nearly snatched my tarp out of the ground. Every time I woke in the night it was raining, and the wind whipped and swirled all night long. Hail fell and accumulated around tents.
Fortunately, no one was injured, though one limb did fall from a tree next to a tent. Michael, a pleasant young man from Scotland, got the worst of it. His tent failed, and he ended up with over an inch of water inside. The disaster obviously didn’t get him down because Michael caught and passed me and Birdman early this morning, and as he approached we could hear him singing. That’s right; despite a major setback in the night, this Scotsman was singing a tune as he hiked in the morning mist. Why can’t we be more like Michael when life deals us a blow? 
Once the sun burned off the fog, the day turned out beautiful.  We met a lovely lady named Hilary who was day hiking with Huckleberry, her little Chihuahua/dachshund mix. They were having a wonderful time. I don’t know whether other hikers stop, but Birdman and I can’t help pausing to speak to folks we meet on the trail. And maybe, by chance, we can brighten someone’s day.
The afternoon met us with a 1,600’ climb that took the steam out of me. At least there was a gorgeous waterfall at the start of our climb. My ankle is still tender so I stopped rather frequently to keep from straining it too much. I finally took a GU packet to give me enough boost to make the summit. From there we cruised to Hogback Ridge Shelter where we are staying tonight. Hopefully, there will be no fireworks this evening. To the contrary, rain and snow are on the way.

From a possible 1” of snow, there was now a winter weather advisory predicting 1-4” and up to 6” on the peaks. Knowing we would be over 5,000’ today, I debated hiking on or getting a shuttle to meet us when we reached I-26. 
Birdman wanted to push on so we decided to take our chances. We even passed up scrambled eggs and hash browns that a trail angel was dishing out at the I-26 exit. We didn’t want to lose the time. As it turned out, we were blessed today, perhaps more than any day since we began this hike.
The skies were clear with few clouds. The sun rose slowly, gracing us through the trees with a brilliant sunrise of yellow and orange as it crested the mountains. The warmth from its rays countered the cool breeze. It was a splendid day to be in the woods.
 Freedom, Juno, Ryann and 5 month old Isabel
On our ascent of Big Bald, our longest climb of the day, we met Freedom, her daughter, Ryann and her granddaughter, Isabel, who were day hiking with their dog, Juno. It touched my heart to see these three generations hiking together. Seeing Isabel on her first hike at five months made me long for two month old Henry, my newest grandson, who was born a month before I left. Hopefully, some of my grandchildren will have the same passion for the woods and trails that I have. My interest came from the hours I spent squirrel hunting with Daddy. Those are special memories. And while Isabel won’t recall her first hike, continuing to take her on such excursions will create a familial bond and many fond memories for her in the years to come. Keep hiking, Isabel! Snow clouds over Big BaldJust before we reached the summit of Big Bald, Birdman got his wish. It began to snow. He had been anxiously hoping for  snow on this enormous bald. Birdman lingered to take in the moment as the gusts of wind whipped around us. I hurriedly climbed up and over Big Bald, and as I reached the neighboring summit of Little Bald, I met a section hiker, Kyle, and his dog, Scout. I loved how the white snowflakes collected on Scout’s thick black fur, creating a vivid contrast in colors.
Walking through the woods as the falling snow flocked the trees and blanketed the ground in white, was indeed a priceless experience. However, I was praying it would stop. . . and it did. The clouds opened and the sun that had not been seen since mid morning quickly melted away the snowfall. This was truly a blessing, saving us from the possibility of hiking through a snowstorm. And the timing was certainly divine.
Just as we reached our campsite for the evening, the snow returned, falling hard, covering everything with over an inch already. For now, Birdman is safe in his nest (tent), and I’m lying snug and warm in my hammock. But the frosty precipitation is forecast to fall all night and through the day tomorrow. We only have thirteen and a half miles to Erwin, Tennessee, but it could be difficult to hike out in the morning. We shall see what the morrow brings. God bless!","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648569,"For me, this was the most challenging day so far on the trail. Many hikers got off the AT and caught shuttles into town to avoid this winter storm. We hiked into it. This morning the temperature in nearby Burnsville, North Carolina was 27°, but felt like 19°, and we were over a thousand feet higher in elevation. 
I didn’t sleep well due to the frigid wind whipping under my tarp. I got up in the night and placed my foam sit pad under my back and shoulders for added insulation and was finally able to sleep for a few hours. But this morning I woke to a winter wonderland; everything was frozen, and a layer of snow covered all in sight, including my tarp. Not what I wanted to see! The cold settles in these old joints. Beyond that, attempting to pack my tarp with fingers that ached unmercifully and refused do as I wanted them to made the task near impossible. Meanwhile, the falling snow was being blown sideways into me by the gusting wind.
Once on the trail, the rocky, brown treadway had disappeared under a thick white coating. For the first two miles I simply walked in what appeared to be the AT. Since there were no trees growing in the middle of it, I figured it must be the trail.. An occasional white blaze gave sporadic guidance
Snow and ice are two of my greatest enemies on any trail. As beautiful as they are, I try my best to avoid them because of the danger they present to me. I will hike when it’s snowing, but only when it can’t be avoided. Today, I had no other choice. What was odd was the fact that at least a half dozen times during the day, it quit snowing, and the sun appeared. Minutes later the sky was dark and snow was falling heavily. Off and on throughout the day. Fortunately, by taking my time, I had only a few slips and no falls. But it was still snowing hard as we arrived at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel in Erwin. A hot meal and warm bed have now made this old hiker feel much better. The joints ache a little less tonight! God bless!","Whistling Gap

We hiked into Uncle Johnny’s Hostel yesterday afternoon in a driving snowstorm, and I’ve spent this afternoon in shorts sunning myself in my hammock and reading. It’s been a well-needed rest. The trail (along with the weather) has really beaten me up.
If you do thru hikes, you learn quickly that it’s not necessarily the days you hike that are the most valuable but those you don’t. Zeros, as they are called, allow your body to heal and your mind to recover from the grueling ordeal. On shorter hikes I’ve been able to push through and finish, often without needing a zero. But the AT has taken a toll on this old man’s body. It needs the rest, and today it got what it needed.
In addition to the usual laundry, resupply, shower and shave, Birdman and I consumed  massive quantities of food. We burn so many calories hiking that it’s essential we put back as many as we can once we hit a town. Then this afternoon the sun came out and the weather was warm, so we set out our gear to dry. After two days in the snow, most of our belongings were wet. 
I found a nice spot in the sun to hang my hammock, so as it dried I lay back and reread Jennifer Pharr Davis’ Pursuit of Endurance, which I have stored on my phone. Birdman and I also spent time meeting and visiting with other hikers, many of which we had already met on the trail. Uncle Johnny’s open area looked like tent city as everybody had theirs set out to dry.
This evening Birdman and I caught the shuttle into Erwin for supper. We’ve found the best food in Erwin at a grocery store, of all places. Food City has a deli/cafe with lots of delicious food and friendly employees. We were joined by a sweet young lady for supper. Her trail name is Goodall, and she is from Massachusetts. I was excited to hear that she ran a BQ (Boston Qualifier) right before starting her thru hike. What a thrill it will be to run Boston on Patriots Day in April 2023! No other marathon matches the history and excitement of Boston. And in her home state! I can’t wait to track her from Hopkinton, through Ashland, Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Newton and Brookline til she makes the right turn onto Hereford and the left onto Boylston. Dreams can come true! Godspeed Goodall!

I use the Garmin inReach Mini GPS device to track my hikes. It allows others, especially family members to follow me and know my whereabouts. The unit, which clips to my pack by a carabiner, allows me to send and receive text messages when there is no cellular service on my phone. Through its satellites, I can initiate an SOS signal whenever I’m in need of help. The inReach Mini operates off an internal rechargeable lithium battery.
Since beginning our hike, my inReach Mini was losing 10% of its battery life at night while turned off. I would fully charge it every evening and in the morning would find that the battery had gone from 100% down to about 90%.  As a result, I had to use my power bank more to charge my inReach Mini.
A few weeks ago, I called Garmin Support and spent a couple of hours on the phone trying to resolve the issue. When the device couldn’t be fixed, Garmin shipped me a new inReach Mini in exchange for the old one. Of course, I had to figure out where to have it shipped ahead so that I could pick it up. It has been a logistical nightmare. The new inReach Mini arrived in Erwin, Tennessee sooner than I anticipated. To keep it from being return to Garmin by the U.S. Postal Service, I reached out to a shuttle driver in Erwin who picked the package up and dropped it off at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel. The new Garmin inReach was there when I arrived on Saturday. 
The next problem was that I had to return the old device via UPS, and the nearest UPS Store was in Johnson City, 20 miles away. Fortunately, when I was checking in at Uncle Johnny’s, a woman named Aya overheard my dilemma and said she had to go to the UPS Store and could give me a ride. Except, that was on Saturday, and the UPS Store was closed til Monday morning (today). That meant that Birdman and I had to stay in Erwin til today. 
Meanwhile, I was able to switch my service to the new device, but discovered that it would not allow me to send or receive any text messages. And Garmin Support was unavailable until this morning, also. So first thing this morning, I was on the phone with Garmin for over an hour. And they could not resolve the problem with my new inReach Mini. I was told the only thing that might fix the technical difficulty was to log onto a computer and, using the Garmin App, update the firmware. I’m hiking the Appalachian Trail! Do you think I’m carrying a computer in my pack?!!
At 9:30 Aya drove me to Johnson City, and I sent the old GPS unit back to Garmin via UPS. She then took me to the library in Erwin where I was able to use a computer to download the Garmin app and perform an update to my firmware. Success!!!
Birdman and I returned to the trail around 1:30 this afternoon. All technical difficulties are behind us for now. Hopefully, there are no more on the horizon. Despite the delay we were able to hike over eight miles today. In the future, I will try not to bore you with such technical difficulties.

There was a light rain falling when I woke, and it continued as I had my breakfast and quiet time. The rain kept falling this morning, making the trail into a quagmire. This wasn’t a torrential downpour or even a steady rain. What fell today is best described as April showers. A light almost misty rain that soaked everything thoroughly. There were a few occasions when it stopped briefly but would resume a short time later. The rain didn’t bother me. I have excellent rain gear, and the overcast sky kept us from overheating.
Five miles into our hike we passed two tents. As I walked by, I thought, “I recognize that tent.” I stopped, turned around and called out, “Bushwhacker, is that you?” Seconds later Bushwhacker’s head popped out. He and Tim had made camp on Unaka Mountain last night, where they built a terrific campfire. This morning they were slow getting up due to the inclement weather.
Birdman and I hiked on but a short distance later, Bushwhacker caught up to us. This was a special time as we hiked together most of the day. Though Bushwhacker and I have had numerous encounters on trails, we had never had the opportunity to hike together. And so with me in the lead, Bushwhacker right behind and Birdman playing the role of sweeper, we covered lots of ground today. For me and Birdman, today’s eighteen miles are the most for any day since we started. 
You can learn so much from veteran hikers. Unfortunately, some of the younger hikers fail to take advantage of the opportunity. Birdman absorbed every word of wisdom Bushwhacker had to offer, and we both were entertained by some of his remarkable stories, such as his bear encounters or how he caught the mouse in his tent a few weeks ago. For the record, he did not kill the mouse but released it outside his tent. The hiker grapevine had grossly distorted the truth.
We slipped and slid along on the muddy AT til late in the afternoon. Finally, Bushwhacker told me and Birdman to go on. He needed a break and didn’t want to hold us back. What a thoughtful guy! Hopefully we meet again on the AT or possibly at his place in New Jersey when we get up north. Regardless, we created memories today that will last a lifetime.

There we found two former AT hikers, Daybreak and Gray Ghost, dishing out trail magic, and it was delicious. They had hot dogs with mustard, ketchup and onions. I know that’s not normal breakfast fare, but to a thru hiker it’s as good as bacon and eggs! They had all kinds of fruit and chips and cookies. I also downed a Dr. Pepper with my hot dog. These two gentlemen had set up where the climb up Roan Mountain begins. Over the next four miles, Birdman and I had 2,200’ of elevation gain. Their trail magic definitely helped get us to the summit. Thanks Daybreak and Gray Ghost!
Trail angel, Daybreak
Roan Mountain was absolutely spectacular with a dense spruce forest that opened to a bald. The sights and smells of the forest were akin to something I would expect to find in the Pacific Northwest. There were even patches of unmelted snow that added to the beauty of these woods. Though I would have loved to linger, I knew we needed to push on through the Roan Highlands. The balds offered panoramic views despite wind gusts strong enough that I was frequently knocked off balance. We made it over the bald on Little Hump Mountain before stopping for the night just seven miles from Mountain Harbor Bed and Breakfast, tomorrow’s destination.
The most unique part of the day occurred this morning when Birdman and I heard a strange noise. He stopped to filter water, and I hiked ahead to locate what was making this foreign sound. I felt certain it was a type of bird and hoped to get a glimpse of it. As I rounded a bend in the trail that exposed a clump of barren oaks, a large black bird gave a loud croak and flew off. A bird I had only read about and seen pictures of but never seen. I realized I had just seen my first raven. Being raised on a farm, I was quite familiar with crows and their obnoxious caw-cawing, but until now I couldn’t say I had ever seen or heard their cunning larger kin.

With a prediction of morning showers, we hoped to avoid as much rain as possible. Today is a Nero, only seven miles. (A Nero is when you don’t put in a full day of hiking but don’t take a Zero.) Less than half a mile into our hike, we began to climb Hump Mountain. The sunrise along the ridge beyond the mountain was a spectacle to witness. God’s artwork lit up the eastern sky. There was a brilliant burst of orange between the ridge line and the clouds. Over to the left I could see the Appalachian Trail winding it’s way up the bald into the clouds covering Hump Mountain. The climb to the summit was challenging as strong gale force winds hammered against my body, knocking me sideways. I staggered like a drunk as a gust would slam against me, forcing me to sidestep to maintain my balance. As I leaned hard into the wind, it would suddenly easy up, and I would lunge in the opposite direction. All the while, I was expending twice the energy necessary to scale Hump Mountain on a calm day. Clouds blew past me in the gale, rapidly moving over the treeless summit of the bald.
Once we descended below tree line, it was immediately calm. The tempest became a gentle breeze all the way down to US 19E. On our descent, we crossed again from North Carolina back into Tennessee, something we’ve done countless times over the past few weeks. This time, however, it was different. We left Carolina for the last time, never to return to it on the Trail. We will hike solely in Tennessee until we reach the Virginia line in about a week. 
From US19E, we hiked a short distance along the highway to Mountain Barbour Bed & Breakfast. Birdman and I have a room in the bunkhouse to ourselves. While it’s not the Bed & Breakfast in the main house, the accommodations in the bunkhouse are quite comfortable. I’m anxious to have breakfast here since numerous hikers have commented about it being the best breakfast on the entire AT. Several hikers have displayed photos of the enormous spread that is offered guests each morning. I can’t imagine it surpassing supper, but we’ll see.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648931,"Right after I woke this morning, I realized, “Today is Good Friday.” I’ve always understood its significance as the day Christ died for our sins. It has always been a special day to me because of that. But the events of this day reached me in a far deeper way than I’ve experienced before.
I slept well, but my shoulders and back ached last night. Carrying thirty pounds for a month will do that. During my quiet time, I had my usual cup of coffee and daily devotional. This morning it was about Simon of Cyrene. We don’t know a lot about him, but we know he was pulled from the crowd to carry the cross of Jesus. As I sat there, I thought about the weight of that cross and the weight of our sin. I can imagine the physical pain Simon felt carrying that cross. Since March 9th I’ve had a thirty pound backpack strapped to my shoulders. I’ve trudged up steep mountains with it on my back. The suffering I have felt helped me to identify with Simon, to better understand what he was called to endure. I could begin to feel his pain.
Shortly after starting our hike, we came upon a young lady sitting on a rock, taking a short break as she watched other hikers wade through mud. Her trail name is Rabbit, though she told us that on bad days it’s Speedbump. Rabbit served in the Navy and pulled three combat tours before becoming a Reservist. She is one of 10 combat veterans who have been selected to hike the Appalachian Trail as part of the Warrior Expedition. Such hikes have been found to be extremely therapeutic and effective in treatment of PTSD. As we talked, I thought about the cross Rabbit carries as a result of the things she endured in battle. I felt empathy for all those veterans carrying crosses we don’t see, and I silently lifted them up in prayer.
You never know what cross someone is carrying. Their cross may be an illness, the loss of a loved one or scars from years of physical or sexual abuse. Regardless of what that cross is, Jesus carried a far heavier cross, the weight of our sin. And because of His suffering, His death, burial and resurrection, we can have new life. 
Birdman and I have been hiking for thirty-eight days and this morning was the first time we have hiked past a cemetery. I couldn’t help but marvel at the timing. We have hiked by graves, but this morning the trail led us right next to a fence surrounding a large cemetery with numerous graves and headstones. Today’s events were a vivid reminder that we have crosses to bear, but because Christ suffered and died on that cross which Simon carried. And because He rose again, our cross can be made lighter. That cemetery can’t hold us if we put our faith in Christ. This was indeed a Good Friday. Hallelujah and God bless!As I gazed at the sky tonight it made me think of how it might have looked during those daytime hours between 9:00 and 3:00 as Christ hung on the cross.","Mountain Harbour Bed & Breakfast

I bolted from my hammock to grab our food bags ahead of the rain. Fifteen minutes later and we would have been soaked retrieving them. 
I managed to fall back asleep to the peaceful pitter-patter against my tarp, rocking ever so slightly in my hammock. It was still raining at 6:00, and I refused to separate from the warmth of my quilt. That put us around 8:00 getting on the trail. I detest packing up in the rain. 
Fortunately, the showers ceased by 9:00 a.m. (They were predicted to last all day and into the evening.) It remained overcast but didn’t rain again. The morning hike was rather uneventful except for getting to see some thru hikers that have become our friends along the trail: Wrong Way and Popeye. There was some sad news as we learned that NASA, who we met the day before yesterday at Mountain Harbour B&B, had taken a fall and broken his arm in several places.
With that news in mind, we descended into Laurel Fork Gorge, climbing down rocks positioned to form a stairway. For several hundred feet I meticulously took one step at a time, using my trekking poles to aid my balance. The trail kept going down, down, down! A fall would have been disastrous and likely have ended my hike. Eventually, we reached the bottom of the gorge where Laurel Fork Falls provided us with a captivating display and made our efforts seem worthwhile.
Laurel Fork Falls
After gazing at the falls a few minutes, we continued on the AT, which wound next to the river.  At one point the trail took us along a ledge barely more than a couple of feet wide and bordered by the river on one side and a towering rock edifice on the other. I was not unnerved but methodically made my way across the expanse. I’ve watched folks hike this section of the trail in videos, but it’s a totally different feeling to hike it yourself carrying a full backpack!
After following the river a ways, the trail made an abrupt turn and began an ascent that would take us up over 1,500’ over the next four miles. What made the climb particularly exhausting, besides the fact that we had just endured the nerve wracking climb down into the gorge, was the fact that it was late in the day and our legs were tiring. Thankfully, our last couple of miles were an easy downhill toward the town of Hampton, Tennessee. Birdman was setting up camp when Popeye arrived and joined us for the night.

For most of my life, Daddy pastored a number of small Baptist churches and Mother was the church pianist. We were always in Sunday School and worship service on Sunday morning and Training Union and Sunday evening worship. When doing a thru hike it can be difficult to attend church. Many times I find myself miles from the nearest road, much less the closest church. However, when I am able, I make every effort to be in the Lord’s House on Sunday. 
Today is Easter Sunday. Since Easter recognizes Christ’s death, burial and resurrection, I especially like being in church today to worship and reflect on the sacrifice He made for my sin. All day yesterday it was in my mind. How do we get to church for Easter? 
Most of the day there was no cell service so I had no means of finding a church. But once I had reception, I began my search, looking for Baptist churches in the Hampton, Tennessee area. It was almost dark when I located several. One, Union Baptist Church, was no more than a mile away from our campsite. Moreover, I discovered that they were having an Easter sunrise service at 6:30 this morning. 
At 5:30 Birdman and I shouldered our packs and hiked out to U.S. 321. From there we got off the AT and climbed the hill to Union Baptist Church in time for the sunrise service. As we walked to church I opened a file on my iPhone and played a piano recording of In the Garden. My mother had made the recording a month before she died at the age of 94. She always loved Easter. 
We enjoyed a beautiful sunrise service. And the blessings continued afterwards because the church served breakfast, and what a feast it was! Hot biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs with bacon, sausage and salt pork, hash browns, milk, orange juice and coffee and more. These two hikers were so blessed as we stayed for Sunday School and the worship service that ended with a baptism. The day was idyllic as we headed back to the trail for a short hike before being picked up by our host this evening. The sunny weather with a light breeze had the feel of springtime.

I can’t say enough good things about Far Not Fast. When we reached the trailhead yesterday, I sent Ryan Owen (Daddy O) a text and within minutes he was there to pick us up. He and his family have turned the lower level of their home into an awesome home for hikers. It is immaculately clean and extremely quiet. As soon as we arrived, I showered and shaved. Before I had finished, Daddy O had brought down a pot of hot coffee with ice cream and brownies to go with it. We threw our dirty clothes in the washer, and Daddy O took me and Birdman into Elizabethton where we ate a delicious Mexican dinner and resupplied at WalMart. Daddy O was waiting on us in the parking lot when we finished.
We shared the room with two AT section hikers last night. Flash and Mountain Dog are great guys. Thanks to their recommendations, I was able to reserve me and Birdman a room in Damascus, Virginia for Wednesday night.

Daddy O fixed a huge breakfast this morning before shuttling me and Birdman back to the trail.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649209,"I woke around 4:00 a.m. to good news and bad news. The good news was that the rain which had fallen on us most of the day had stopped. The bad news was that the precipitation was now white. That’s right; it was snowing! So I did the only thing I could do. I rolled over and went back to sleep.
I woke again around 5:15 but knew there was no rush. Everything was frozen: my gaiters, my socks, my shoes, my hands. As for the gaiters, socks and shoes, they were as hard as the stones we’ve been stepping on. Solid as a brick. Even the laces of my shoes were frozen stiff. You see, the rain had left them all soaked and when the temperature dropped to 27°, they did what water does below 32°. To defrost them, I heated an extra pot of water this morning and held each item to the outside of the pot. With my shoes, I set the pot down on the laces to thaw them and then put the pot in the shoe to warm it enough to insert my foot. You have to be creative on the trail to survive. 
My hands hurt so bad from the cold that I felt nauseous.  Birdman helped me tie the guy lines of my tarp and by 9:00 a.m. we were hiking. Four miles into today’s hike we came out to a highway and found a fella offering trail magic. Hydrator is a section hiker who had lots of chips, fruit, snacks and Powerade. It gave us such a boost! We were going to take a break soon anyway, and he happened to be right where we needed him. Thanks in part to Hydrator, Birdman and I had our longest mileage day yet, almost 21 miles. And that was after a late start because of the snow.
We hiked quite a bit this afternoon with a hiker who I found extremely fascinating. His trail name is Fever Pitch, and I must say that his trail name could not suit him better. I saw his Red Sox cap, and I inquired if he was from Boston. He said no, that he was from Idaho. This young man then proceeded to spend the next two hours reciting an in-depth history of the Boston Red Sox. He was familiar with Sox players before he was born, Rico Petrocelli, Tony Conigliaro. He gave play by play and pitch by pitch recounts of some of Boston’s most memorable games. I’m an avid baseball fan and since 1967 have been a huge fan of the Boston Red Sox. (I have an autographed jersey of Carl Yastrzemski hanging on my wall.) But I cannot hold a candle to the knowledge Fever Pitch displayed. It blew me away!
I’m rooting for him to successfully complete his AT thru hike because his plan when he finishes is to come back down to Boston and attend his first game at Fenway Park. As special as it will be to conclude his thru hike by summiting Katahdin, for this young man, setting foot in the greatest cathedral in baseball and watching his beloved Boston Red Sox play will be an emotional journey he will never forget.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649264,"There are many places that call themselves trail towns and rightly so. On my hikes I look for and have enjoyed a number of those locales which are accommodating to hikers. Not only are their residents friendly and helpful, but their businesses reach out to hikers. Many offer hiker discounts, which can be extremely important to a hiker on a tight budget. Trail towns typically have hostels, inns or motels that are both affordable and comfortable. Equally important, they have restaurants that serve delicious food and lots of it. Hiker hunger is a real thing. I can name lots of trail towns; however, there is only one Trail Town USA: Damascus, Virginia. 
Birdman and I got an early start this morning; we were hiking soon after sunrise. Though it was a short day (5.3 miles) we were eager to get to Damascus. We were also excited to be nearing the Virginia border. We slept in Tennessee last night but were only about a mile and a half from the Tennessee/Virginia line. It didn’t take us long to cross into Virginia and make our way into Trail Town. USA. 
Entering Virginia 
The Appalachian Trail goes straight through Damascus. As you enter, you hike beneath a sign in the city park that declares: “Appalachian Trail - Welcome - Damascus, VA.” Signs, kiosks and murals all proclaim the city as Trail Town USA. Banners reference Trail Days which is held annually in Damascus. Trail Days is a festival which is attended by past and present AT hikers, vendors, trail angels and maintainers and others who enjoy hiking. During Trail Days the city hosts a parade, music, workshops, lectures and gear expos. It is a huge celebration, and I understand that at times the party atmosphere has gotten a little out of hand. Birdman and I don’t intend to return in May for Trail Days; however, I would like to return some day just to attend some of the lectures and visit with many of the vendors who have booths and displays set up.
We are staying at the Dancing Bear Inn tonight. A quaint old home right on the trail as it goes through town. It is extremely clean and quiet, and Elizabeth is a wonderful hostess. She even did a load of laundry for us.
I’ve had breakfast and supper at the Damascus Diner and the food is superb! Birdman ate all three meals there today. It will be tough to leave such an inviting place, but we must do so in the morning. From all I’ve experienced today, it’s easy to see why Damascus has come to be known as Trail Town USA. God bless!","Campsite near ruins of stone cabin

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649460,"Injuries continue to force hikers from the trail. While in Damascus I got an update on NASA. He and I met at Mountain Harbour B&B the day before his injury. He was looking for a new pack and had questions about my ULA Circuit. When he asked to try it on, I obliged, and he seemed to really like it. The following day, NASA fell and broke his arm. The latest update came from a hiker who was with him when he fell. She confirmed his arm was broken in multiple places, and he was having surgery on it. Unfortunately, he won’t be returning to the AT this year.
Birdman and I met Bounty just before Hampton. A wonderful young lady with a sweet smile. Since she was hiking alone, I gave her my contact information in case she needed help. Birdman saw Bounty limping into Damascus. She says the pain was so bad that she couldn’t walk on her right foot. The doctor has put her in a boot for three weeks. It breaks my heart because I know how much she wanted to do this. 
Birdman and I met Neo on March 9th, our very first day on the trail. She, too, has had some issues that forced her to take several zeros. I understand that she is back on the AT, and I’m praying that Neo can finish her hike. She is from Maine and would love to conclude her hike in her home state.
All of this emphasizes the fact that an AT thru hike takes a toll on your body. Even if you are in peak physical condition, the trail will beat you up. And there is always the risk of injury from a fall.
We left Damascus early this morning. It seemed like much of the day was spent climbing; although, I know there will be more tomorrow as we reach Mt. Rogers, Virginia’s highest point.
Around noon, another hiker came up on me from behind. He was much faster, and I let him pass me. As he did, I asked his name and where he was from. His trail name is Turbo and he’s from Niceville, Florida! How about that?!! He grew up right down the road from us. Further, he went to Okaloosa Walton College in Niceville where my sons attended. I don’t expect to see much of Turbo on the AT since his goal is to finish in 100 days. If he does, he will certainly live up to his trail name. Godspeed, Turbo!","Damascus, Virginia/Dancing Bear Inn

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649492,"Today was a tough day. Birdman and I spent the morning climbing. The acme of that climb was Mount Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia with an elevation of 5,729’. Since we spent the night around 3,600’, we climbed over 2,000’ by noon. 
I was inspired as I made my way up the ascent to Mount Rogers. I passed an older gentleman who was making his way up the grade. I took note that he was climbing at an excellent pace. I couldn’t resist asking him his age. Bill is seventy-nine years old. He’s from Oxnard, California and is hiking the highest peak in each state, which is why he was climbing Mount Rogers. Well, he can check off Virginia now. What an inspiration he is! Regardless of your age, set goals and pursue them, just like Bill is doing. It keeps you young.
To get to the summit of Mount Rogers, we had to take a half mile blue blaze off the Appalachian Trail, so our actual mileage on the AT today was fifteen miles. And it was a rough fifteen, especially the afternoon. We entered Grayson Highlands State Park, which is known for its wild ponies. Hikers are cautioned not to feed or pet the animals. Since I grew up on a farm, I’ve been around horses and ponies most of my life. Still, it was unique to see these animals in a wild setting. Most of the ponies continued grazing as we passed by, totally ignoring the hikers.
The terrain in Grayson Highlands was extremely rocky and had some huge steps to navigate. My feet took a pounding. I felt exhausted from having to concentrate so intently to keep from rolling an ankle or tripping and taking a fall. By going slow, I came through it unscathed. A good night’s rest will hopefully restore my energy. God bless!","Stealth campsite among ruins of an old homestead

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649493,"April 23rd is my brother George’s birthday. And his twin daughters. The girls turned twenty today. Since cell phone service has been nearly nonexistent, I was thrilled to be able to call this morning and catch George just as he was leaving for work. I found out later in the day that Fever Pitch, who is at the shelter with us tonight, also turned twenty years old today. 
George and the twins have three miniature horses so I snapped a couple of photos of the wild ponies and sent them as a birthday greeting. We left Grayson Highlands this morning but not before getting close to some more of the wild ponies, but not too close. After all, they may look cute, but they are still wild animals and can hurt you if you aren’t careful.
I had been concerned about resupplying because my food bag was nearly empty. Mid morning I called and booked a hotel in Marion, VA. They offer hiker rates and are located close to Walmart. Since the shuttle from the trail to Marion doesn’t run on Sunday, I found someone who will come get us and take us into town. It was a huge relief to make those arrangements. After that, I was able to concentrate on hiking. 
Concentration was definitely needed as we spent a lot of the morning negotiating our way over rocks. A false step can mean a turned ankle. I felt a twinge on one ankle, but after taking an Advil during lunch, I felt no more pain. That was good because we ended up putting in twenty miles today. Tomorrow will be just ten. You can’t stack too many high mileage days together or you risk injury. Aside from being tired, I feel great. Time to let my body recover from today’s hike.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649550,"It was a beautiful Sunday morning as I hiked just after sunrise. Birdman was finishing his coffee and, since I’m much slower, I set out alone for the first few miles. It felt good to hear the silence, broken only my own footsteps and an occasional bird’s serenade. The sun lit up the surrounding mountains in brilliant color as it began to rise. What a peaceful time of solitude! My own moments of worship since I wasn’t able to get to Marion, Virginia in time for church.
Mid morning we had stopped for a break when Moss passed us. She had stayed in the hostel with us in Hot Springs. She and I watched the NCAA basketball championship game together. (She’s from North Carolina.) As she went by, Moss turned and said, “You’re with a church aren’t you?” She explained that she wanted a Bible because she had lost the one she had. She believes she may have left it at a hostel. Birdman pulled out a Gideon New Testament a gave it to her. As he did so, I explained to her that if she scanned the third QR code on our card, which she still had with her, it would go directly to the YouVersion app. That would give her access to the entire Bible, both the Old and New Testaments. You don’t necessarily have to be sitting in the church pew on Sunday for the Lord to use you. We had a wonderful dialogue with Moss and will see her again on Tuesday as we will be hiking together and staying at the same hostel. Please keep Moss in your prayers as she seeks God’s direction and for safe travels on her thru hike.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649656,"Over the years I’ve found there to be moments on the trail that stir my memory, bringing back vivid recollections of my past. It is on those occasions that I can relive a few of the magical moments from my childhood.
Before I relate today’s occurrence, you should know that when I was small we lived on a farm in the Oak Grove community of Okaloosa County, Florida. We had no telephone, and Daddy traded a patch of watermelons for our first TV, a black and white that got two channels. A few hundred yards down the dirt road from our house was Yellow River Baptist Church, which we attended. About the same distance up the road, down a lane, was the house and various other buildings the Parker family had built when they moved there in the early 1900’s. There was a smokehouse, chicken house, corn crib, car house, outhouse and several barns and stalls for housing their mules and livestock.
The Uncles, as my three great uncles were known, lived in that house. They were like three grandfathers to me. And since none of them ever married, I was the grandson they never had. There are many stories concerning the Uncles, enough to fill a book. Most are true.
 The corn crib
One of my favorite places at the Uncles’ house was their corn crib. In that crib they had a corn sheller. With a handle attached to a large flywheel, it would quickly strip the kernels of corn from the cob. One of my greatest joys as a young ‘un was to turn that flywheel, drop ear after ear of corn in the feeder and watch it spit the bare cobs out as the shelled corn poured into a croker sack.
This morning’s hike took us past a museum that was an old homestead. Besides the house, there was a smokehouse, root cellar, outhouse, chicken house, tool shed, barn and corn crib. As I walked towards the corn crib, I saw an old corn sheller off to the side. This old hiker was suddenly overwhelmed with emotion as for a moment I was back in the Uncle’s corn crib turning that flywheel. Sixty years has passed, but it was as real as if it was yesterday. I admit I had to wipe my eyes a couple of times as I returned to the present. 
Just a little farther down the trail we came to an old one room schoolhouse. Again the old hiker choked up as it reminded me of the one room schoolhouse Daddy attended as a boy in Falco, Alabama. I recalled him telling how some years they would only go to school for three months because they had to plant and gather the crops. He somehow got enough learning because he could calculate the pounds of fertilizer he needed to cover a given acreage and do all the math in his head.One room schoolhouse 
It was a blessing to relive those moments of my childhood today. And it came so unexpectedly. The trail will surprise and amaze you when you least anticipate it. God bless!","Mount Rogers Visitor Center/Marion, Virginia

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649672,"Yesterday afternoon was special thanks to a text message I received just before starting my hike. On January 29th I had met a young man from the Netherlands, Tin Man, at Billy Goat Day as he was hiking the Florida Trail. Unfortunately, I missed him as he passed through Walton County on his way north. But yesterday morning I received a text from Tin Man that he was going to be at the Barn Restaurant where the AT crosses I-81. The problem was that he would arrive around 10:30, and it would be at least 1:00 before Birdman and I could hike there. Nonetheless, we picked up our pace and got there right at 1:00. And there sat Tin Man waiting patiently for us. 
We had dinner together and enjoyed the companionship, discussing our hikes and his future plans. Tin Man is quite a hiker. This twenty-six year old started from Key West on December 19th. He is hiking the Eastern Continental Trail (ECT) from Key West to Belle Isle, Newfoundland. The ECT consists of a series of trails: the Overseas Heritage Trail, the ECT Florida Connector, the Florida National Scenic Trail, the Alabama Road Walk, the Pinhoti Trail, the Benton MacKaye Trail, the Appalachian Trail and the International Appalachian Trail in Canada. My friend Outback is also thru hiking the ECT and is currently in Pennsylvania. Tin Man is doing extra mileage though. He hiked to Ft. Pickens on the Florida Trail and then hiked the Blackwater section to the Alabama line. When he reached the Pinhoti’s northern terminus, he skipped to the top of the Benton MacKaye and hiked all three hundred miles down to Springer Mountain instead of just hiking the seventy miles south on the BMT to the Appalachian Trail. 
Tin Man is hiking thirty to thirty-five miles a day on the AT. He also did a twenty-four hour challenge while on the Florida Trail and hiked eighty miles in one day! This young man is remarkable, and I watched in awe as he pulled away from us on an incline, scaling it as easily as I hike level ground. His future plans? He will return to the U.S. in December to attempt an FKT (fastest known time) on the Florida Trail. Tin Man believes he can do the 1,100 mile trail self-supported in 20 days! And I’m not one to doubt him. Hike on and hike strong, my friend. I will see you in December. God bless!","Crawfish Trail campsite

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649781,"The best part of the day was the ride to the trailhead. After staying at Bear Garden Hiker Hostel, Birdman and I were driven back to the trail by Craig, who runs a shuttle service. He was at the hostel promptly at 6:30 a.m. to pick us up. During the drive along the winding Virginia backroads, a doe made her way across the road in front of us. Just a little farther and a turkey hen ran alongside us for a short distance.
As he drove us down a narrow gravel road, Craig shared his testimony, relating how he came to know Christ as his Savior following colon surgery. Craig is a wonderful young man who has helped so many hikers and was such an encouragement to me as we set out this morning.
The hike, however, was difficult and began with a 2,200’ ascent up to Chestnut Knob. I must say, though, that the view was as grand as the climb. Near the top, the trees opened to a bald that offered incredible displays of the mountains and valleys below. On the summit sat the stone shelter where Birdman and I found an ideal spot for a morning break safe from the wind, which had picked up.

For the rest of the day we battled gusting winds that were at first rather cold but warmed as the sun rose higher. The trail was extremely rocky and slowed my progress. I take my time traversing the rocks and boulders. Can’t afford a false step. But it was a gorgeous day otherwise. A bright blue sky over a landscape that is now starting to come alive with new growth. Trees are going from barren to green. Spring is finally arriving.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649807,"Never get discouraged when you have a bad day on a thru hike. Tomorrow will be a better day. There are things you can do to make a bad day better. Get off the trail and stay in town or at a hostel for the night. Find a place that sells hot food or ice cream. Or you can do what I did yesterday. Quit hiking early, set up camp and go to bed.
I just didn’t have it yesterday. The climbs and rocks beat me down. Still, we managed to hike over fifteen miles by mid afternoon. Certainly not a bad day, but less than I hoped to do. When we got to Jenkins Shelter I knew I needed to stop so we set up camp and by 6:00 p.m. I was asleep. I woke briefly around 9:00 and was able to write a journal entry before I dozed off again. 
A good night’s rest can make such a difference! I woke at 5:00 a.m., and we were hiking by sunrise. My legs had more spring in them today. It also helped that the climbs were less steep and the trail much smoother. By 11:00 Birdman and I had logged over eleven miles and arrived at Brushy Mountain Outpost ready for some hot food. I’ve learned that when you can get a hot meal at lunch it can often save having to cook when you get to camp. I managed to put away a bacon cheeseburger, four large chicken strips, an order of cheese curds, and a Mountain Dew. Plus I drank an ice cold bottle of chocolate milk while waiting on my order. 
The huge meal didn’t slow me down. To the contrary, I felt strong this afternoon, hitting a comfortable stride and holding it. Though I slowed some on the uphills, I seldom had to stop to catch my breath. We left Brushy Mountain Outpost at 12:30 and covered 12 miles by 6:00 p.m. when we made it to Jenny Knob Shelter. 
I could have continued on for several more miles. My legs weren’t tired, but I was almost out of water and the shelter had a water source nearby. The more than twenty-three miles we hiked today are the most we’ve covered in a day on this hike. And it came after a bad day. The lesson to take from that is to never get discouraged no matter what happens because tomorrow may be your best day yet. Looking forward to another good night’s sleep. Good bless!","Jenkins Shelter

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650005,"Hike Your Own Hike (HYOH) That mantra has been around now for decades. It simply means that every hiker is different. They each have their own abilities, preferences, methods, and reasons for hiking the trail. When Birdman and I began our hike, we shared the same purpose: to enjoy God’s beautiful Creation as we walked from Georgia to Maine while at the same time being willing to share the Gospel as we were led. 
Soon after our start, however, it became apparent to me that while our purpose may have been in concert, other differences existed that were an impediment to a joint hike. Birdman is much younger and a much stronger hiker than I am. He was eager to push our miles and desired to finish in July. At first I made every attempt to go fast but realized after a series of falls and resulting injuries that I had to slow down. When I proposed that he go ahead and hike at his pace, he didn’t want to do that. 
Since we first met, I’ve logged numerous miles and completed nearly a dozen thru hikes. This was Birdman’s first. There was a significant disparity in our experience. My age and experience has taught me that an important aspect of any thru hike is to make it easier on yourself rather than making it harder. For example, slack packing (hiking without carrying all of your gear) will ease the burden of shouldering a heavy backpack day after day. It’s extremely helpful to aging hikers. I’m not adverse to the practice. Birdman, however, did not favor slack packing.
When winter storms threatened, Birdman was eager to see snow while I dreaded the thought of hiking in a snowstorm. I even failed to use my best judgment on one occasion, opting not to call for a shuttle ahead of one storm which could have potentially put us at risk.
Our hiking philosophies differed. I plan out my hikes, studying what lies ahead: terrain, elevation change, resupply points, available water sources, hostels, places offering hot food, etc. I handled all those chores on our hike. Birdman, on the other hand, would rather follow the blazes without the detailed logistics. 
These conflicts in preference, style, age, ability and experience led me to again suggest to Birdman that we each Hike His Own Hike. When he rejected that proposal and insisted we stay together, I had no choice but to leave the trail. I hike for the joy and thrill of the experience, but our differences were interfering with that. And so I elected to suspend my hike.
I will finish the Appalachian Trail at some point. I have an inexorable drive that will not quit. But I will finish it alone, at my pace, using my good judgment to reach Mount Katahdin without serious injury. I will Hike My Own Hike. Birdman must do the same. 
Just as Paul and Barnabas parted because of their differences, Birdman and I must do likewise. Just as there arose two missionary endeavors out of their parting, so will this expand the opportunities to expose others to the Gospel. Hiking the Appalachian Trail is an extremely difficult undertaking, particularly for this aging nomad. And success in this pursuit will only happen if you Hike Your Own Hike. The Birdman can continue to soar on the AT while Steps will slowly and methodically continue to take one after another as long as there is breath in me. God bless!","Jenny Knob Shelter

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650346,"In November 2020 when my son, Brad, ran the Pinhoti 100, his pacer for the last 50K (31 miles) was Alyssa Clark. Alyssa had recently set a world record recognized by Guinness by running 95 marathons in 95 days. That’s right, a marathon a day for 95 straight days. Alyssa helped Brad to a strong finish on the grueling one hundred mile course and has continued to coach my son.
Last year I again helped to crew Brad as he ran the Umstead 100 in Raleigh. This time I paced him the last twelve miles. Several of Brad’s friends were running, including Jacky Hunt-Broersma. Thunderstorms during the day and evening soaked runners. When they reached mile sixty-two, I looked over at the tent next to ours and saw Jacky sitting down and in tears. She had to drop out of the race. You see, Jacky lost one leg to cancer in 2001. The rain had caused her prosthetic to rub against her stump until it was raw. She was in extreme pain. Add to that the agony of having to DNF.
This past week Jacky Hunt-Broersma made national news. The cancer survivor, who took up running in 2016 to encourage others to run, surpassed Alyssa Clark’s record by running 104 marathons in 104 days. Brad told me that early in her pursuit of the record she had run a half marathon, then went home and ran another 13.1 miles. When she posted her miles, she was criticized by some who claimed she hadn’t run a marathon (26.2 miles) that day because she didn’t run it continuously. So Jacky went out that evening and ran another 26.2 miles. When she woke the next morning, she ran her marathon for that day. 
As I reflected on the grit and determination of these two incredible women the past few days, I knew my hike had not ended. When he gave me my trail name, Nimblewill told me, “You have a real passion and purpose for this.” That passion and purpose is the driving force inside me. As long as I can continue to take steps, I will not quit. I set out on March 9th to reach Mount Katahdin and won’t stop until I stand on the summit. 
In case you wondered, the men’s record for consecutive daily marathons? It’s 59 days. Thank you Alyssa and Jacky for inspiring me, and God bless!

Just after leaving the trail last week, I got acute bronchitis. Whenever I push too hard and am under significant stress, my body’s immune system weakens. I was fortunate to be able to spend the week recovering but still have another week or two before I will be back to normal. The coughing has sapped much of my strength, and I could tell today that I had greater difficulty breathing. Because of this, I slowed my pace and shortened my day, doing only 11 1/2 miles total.
What a great stay I had at Woods Hole Hostel. Woods Hole has more charm and history than any other hostel on the Appalachian Trail. Roy and Tillie Wood opened the bunkhouse to hikers in 1986. After Roy passed away in 1987, Tillie continued to host Appalachian Trail hikers, feeding and housing them in the 1880’s log cabin that became a bunkhouse. According to Neville, the year before Tillie’s death her grandmother took her to Woods Hole and told Neville she wanted her granddaughter to continue running it after Tillie’s death. 
Neville fulfilled her grandmother’s wishes and took over running Woods Hole in 2009. She is a sweet, energetic lady who makes the stay special for each hiker. One wonderful tradition at Woods Hole is that before every meal, Neville gathers all the hikers in a circle and has each hiker tell their name, where they are from and something they are thankful for. I found it very refreshing in this day of widespread negativity to hear fifteen to twenty hikers giving thanks.
Rain moved in during the night. I had the loft in the main cabin at Woods Hole so I heard the sound of the raindrops on the tin roof above my head. It was difficult to rise but the thought of fresh coffee prompted me. I sat in a rocker on the front porch cradling a cup of hot coffee and watching the rain fall. Pure bliss!
It was also good to be reunited with friends from the trail with whom I had previously hiked: Bushwhacker, E.T., Strider and Moon. After breakfast, Bushwhacker and I headed to the trail. I was thankful the rain had stopped. We hiked together for a while, but I’m a little faster. Nonetheless, we both found ourselves at Holy Family Hostel tonight in Pearisburg, where the two of us, Jim, the caretaker, and five other hikers enjoyed a supper of fresh salad, baked potatoes and steak. I’m now lying in my hammock under the pavilion where we grilled the steaks. A thunderstorm just passed through, and I hope that’s the last excitement for the night. God bless.","Woods Hole Hostel

We enjoyed our morning, but the afternoon proved to be a bit of a challenge. Around 1:00 p.m. the rain came again and did not stop. We arrived at Rice Field Shelter, which was about half full. By the time we left twenty minutes later, the shelter was packed. The rain was steady until we finished around 4:00, and is expected to continue til late tonight. It wasn’t the rain as much as the cold which took some of the pleasure out of the afternoon. Temperatures are dropping with tomorrow night’s low predicted to be 38°.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650592,"Yesterday’s rain meant crossing swollen creeks and streams today. Fortunately, they all had rocks or logs that could be utilized to avoid getting my shoes and socks soaked. The first crossing may have been the most dangerous. The rushing water was probably 20’ across and looked to be at least knee deep. Several dead saplings lay across the creek, but negotiating my way over them was a real balancing act. They bowed and rolled occasionally as I inched my way across. Somehow I set foot on the opposite bank completely dry. And the rest of the day’s stream crossings were also successful.
A large portion of the morning was spent stepping on and over rocks. Rocks of all shapes and sizes. Add in a couple of good climbs, and I was exhausted by lunchtime. At least the afternoon brought some smoother trail and a long downhill. This is, until the last two and a half miles. It was again rocky and steep. The campsite this evening has a great view, thanks to that climb. As I finished supper, Bushwhacker made his way into camp. Temperatures are predicted to be in the mid-30’s tonight.

I had switched out my 0° underquilt and 10° quilt for my 20° pair. They were sufficient to keep me comfortable. Many hikers had sent their cold gear home. I merely modified mine since I suspected we would still get some cold weather. We could still have freezing temperatures but not likely.
Bushwhacker was still asleep in his tent this morning when I packed and started hiking. He was pretty exhausted from the past two days. I didn’t see him today, but maybe we will get to hike together again before we are done.
As I hiked this morning I noticed the birds filling the air with their songs. With the rain gone, they took the opportunity to serenade all who would listen. I enjoyed hearing music that I had never heard before. I didn’t realize how many different birds are here in Virginia than the ones I’m acquainted with in Florida and Alabama. Their repertoires may be different, but they still create a beautiful symphony!
Today’s hike took me through several pastures sprawled out over the mountainsides. Their green carpet was dotted with tiny wild flowers. I was also blessed with countless Dogwood trees in full bloom that seemed to punctuate the landscape. I wanted to stop and let it all soak in, but knew I needed to keep moving. There was so much more to see.
Just before lunch I passed Keffer Oak. This massive oak is the largest on the Appalachian Trail in the South and is over three hundred years old. It made me think about what it took to live that long. There have certainly been droughts and storms so the old oak had to be both strong and resilient. It would never have stood so long had it not been deeply rooted. It also had to be in a place where it was nurtured and allowed to mature; otherwise, a woodsman’s saw or axe would have felled it for lumber or firewood. I thought, too, about how things have changed since that tiny acorn sprouted and produced this giant hardwood. But Keffer Oak is the same now as it was then. It’s still an oak tree, just older, larger and stronger. May we all age that way!
This afternoon I hiked the Ledges. They offered amazing views of the valley and other ridgelines. The slope of these rocky trails made for a precarious hike at times. I was thankful that I had on new trail runners with excellent tread and that it was not raining since one slip could have had disastrous results. I have to admit, I did enjoy the excitement and was careful to take my time, making sure of my footing with each step.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650718,"I won’t need to go to the gym tonight. It feels like this was leg day. Two long climbs and one challenging descent took all I had. The early morning ascent was a three and a half mile climb to a ridge on Brushy Mountain. Located on that ridge is the Audie Murphy monument. I remember him more as a movie star, but recall Mother and Daddy talking about his courageous acts in World War II. If I recall correctly, Audie Murphy received every medal of valor that could be offered. He epitomized what it meant to be an American. As I stood before the monument, I found myself moved by this man’s selfless acts of heroism. I wondered how many Appalachian Trail hikers take the time to hike up the short blue blaze trail to pay their respects to this American hero. I particularly wondered if the younger hikers have any idea who Audie Murphy is. If not, they need to visit his monument and learn his story.
The afternoon climb took me to Dragon’s Tooth, a giant monolith from which there are spectacular views. The trail up required me to abandon my trekking poles on several occasions and use my upper body to scramble over boulders. I was exhausted when I reached the top of the climb, but didn’t hesitate to hike the tenth of a mile on the blue blaze trail to see this spectacle. Once there, I couldn’t resist the urge to climb Dragon’s Tooth. There’s still a lot of kid inside me. While I didn’t venture out to the tip, I managed to climb within twenty feet or so of its peak and hollered to a hiker down below to take my photo. 
The view from on top of Dragon’s Tooth was incredible. The trail leading down from the monolith was nerve wracking. Sheer drops along rock ledges, metal handles afffixed to the side of the rock face, trail no wider than my foot. It took time, but I got in no hurry and had no problems. I have to say, I enjoyed it so much that I can’t wait to go back. I’m hoping my son will join me sometime for a pre-dawn hike to catch a sunrise from Dragon’s Tooth.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650851,"Dragon’s Tooth, Tinker Cliffs and McAfee Knob comprise the Virginia Triple Crown, three difficult hikes to iconic landmarks with amazing views. Over the last day and a half, I’ve met lots of day hikers attempting to hike one of these. Since yesterday, I have climbed all three. It began yesterday afternoon with the difficult climb up and the treacherous descent from Dragon’s Tooth. 
My legs had not fully recovered as I began hiking at first light this morning. I knew I had a long day and some tough climbs ahead so I added an extra half mile to my day. I hiked down to a country store that had hot food where I picked up a breakfast biscuit. I also downed a cup of coffee and two bottles of chocolate milk. The fuel and a clean shave provided me with an energy boost as I hiked through pastures where cows stopped grazing and calves ceased their frolicking to watch me stroll across their meadow. After that, I ridge walked until reaching Virginia Highway 311 and a large trailhead parking lot filled with cars. Most were day hikers headed up the four mile ascent to McAfee Knob. 
I stopped at the shelter to filter water on my way up because I knew there would be limited water sources and the weather was getting hotter. I reached McAfee Knob at lunchtime and was glad to see it wasn’t too crowded. McAfee Knob is the most photographed point on the Appalachian Trail and is the one image most people have of the AT. I was able to get another hiker to take a few photographs before sitting down and enjoying the view over lunch. And what a spectacular view it was! The clear, sunny day offered an amazing panoramic setting of the valley below and other mountains in the distance. It was such a magnificent display of God’s creation that I hated to leave.
But I had miles to go, so after lunch I shouldered my pack and headed towards Tinker Cliffs. This part of the hike was not bad until just over a mile from the cliffs when the real climb began. Right before beginning the climb, on a large outcropping I saw some graffiti. Normally I hate when people deface nature; however, this graffiti was put there by the Girl Scouts from Roanoke who maintained the trail before the present AT maintainers took over. It read: “The Nomads. Hike for Health. Roanoke Virginia, April 10, 1932.” After ninety years, it seems more history than vandalism.Graffiti from the 1930’s on a rock outcropping.
As I labored on the climb up to Tinker Cliffs, I kept wondering if it would be worth it. After what I had already witnessed with Dragon’s Tooth and McAfee Knob, how would this third jewel measure up to them? I no sooner stepped out on the first ledge and was awe struck. From one rocky crag to another along the cliffs, I was continuously pausing to take it all in. From this vantage point, I could see McAfee Knob, where I was earlier. I could even see Mount Rogers, which I passed more than two hundred miles back.
Tinker Cliffs
The views yesterday and today were breathtaking. Their grandeur will be forever etched in my mind. Hopefully, I will get to hike Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs again. I would love to bag all three in a day, perhaps sharing the venture with my ultrarunning son, Brad. But if not, I will cherish til I die the sweet memories I’ve made completing the Virginia Triple Crown. God bless!

There’s something magical about lying on your back looking up at the sky, seeing the leaves flutter with the breeze, catching that random shooting star among a host of others. The peacefulness of it quickly sends me to the land of Wynken, Blynken and Nod. I slept soundly with only an occasional cough to disturb my slumber. For the past few days I’ve had laryngitis. That’s right, a lawyer with laryngitis. And everyone said, “Hallelujah!” Thankfully I’m no longer in the courtroom, and where I now reside there aren’t a lot of people to have to talk to.
I was hiking by first light, trying to get to Daleville, Virginia before noon. Daleville is where I planned to take a Nero and resupply. I also had to pick up a couple of packages at the post office. I arrived just before 11:00 a.m. and had lunch first. After getting my packages, I stopped at a barber shop and got my first haircut since starting my hike March 9th. It made such a difference in how I felt! The shave and haircut greatly improved my whole attitude. It’s incredible what a simple thing such as that can do for a person. The little things do matter.
After resupplying, I was headed to do my laundry when I met Two Hats. Two Hats is a seventy-one year old AT section hiker who has already completed a significant portion of the trail. We were both going to do laundry so we combined our small piles into one load. As the clothes washed, Two Hats and I got to know one another. He’s from Concord, Massachusetts, which is just outside Boston. That was the springboard I needed as we discussed all things Boston for the next hour, Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins, Marathon, Patriots Day. 
I have for years wanted to attend the re-enactment on Patriots Day at Lexington and Concord but have never made it, usually because I was running the marathon that day. After visiting with Two Hats, my mind is settled on going to Concord. Once again I was blown away by the hospitality of folks from Massachusetts. Two Hats offered me a place to stay if I come through Boston on my way back from Katahdin. This stranger I only met an hour earlier reached out to offer me a place in his home. 
I’m still humbled by the generosity of the crowd in 2012 when temperatures during the Boston Marathon reached nearly 90°. It is still the hottest race I ever ran and one of the hottest Boston Marathons on record. But people along the race route went and bought bags of ice for runners, they hooked up their garden hoses and sprayed runners to cool them off, they helped those in distress get medical attention. I’ve said since that day that Southern hospitality can’t beat the generosity I’ve seen from folks in Massachusetts.
I’ve seen that same care and concern on the trail. Hikers helping other hikers. Trail angels giving up their time and money to provide for complete strangers. Maintainers volunteering countless hours to keep the trail passable. In these times of narcissism and selfish ideals, it’s refreshing to see people helping their fellow man because they truly care. Thank you, Two Hats, you are so gracious and kind. God bless!","Scorched Earth Gap Shelter

I saw four deer before I barely got out of Daleville. One doe ran within 10 feet of me and scrambled up the hillside. I also saw two rabbits, and each casually hopped off into the bushes just ahead of me. Then three squirrels scampered up trees when they saw me approaching, and finally, two box turtles were right in the middle of the trail. The second one didn’t shy away; he just continued eating his breakfast as I stepped over him. Those weren’t the only critters. The trees were filled with blue jays, wrens, thrush, catbirds, cardinals, sparrows, towhees and others. All were singing at the top of their lungs. What a way to be serenaded as I hike the trail!

A doe watches me walk by. A box turtle continues eating as I step over him.
I was even more blessed not to be hiking in the Green Tunnel, as the AT is sometimes called. I was disappointed to miss seeing the azaleas in bloom at home this past March. It’s one of my favorite times of the year. Today made up for that loss, though. The rhododendron have suddenly burst into bloom allowing me to hike for miles in a tunnel of pink and lavender. I was bathed in color and had trouble hiking because I kept wanting to stop and record their beauty!. 

There were smooth travels on the trail today as I wound along a ridgeline on what had once been an old mountain road. For the most part the trail was much less rocky than I’ve had for the past few days. It was good to get my legs and feet a rest. We still pulled plenty of ups and downs, though. People pass me often, but I don’t get in a hurry. Somehow, at the end of the day, I’ve logged a few more miles than them. I often hear Daddy’s voice saying, “Just stay at it, Son.” That’s the way he worked and the way he wanted his children to. You didn’t rush but you stayed with it til the job was done.
It rained off and on from late morning until this evening. As much as I dislike setting up my hammock and tarp in the rain, I had no choice since there was a steady rain at the end of the day.

I had slept less than half a mile from the Peaks of Otter Overlook, but there was nothing to be seen through the dense fog. The AT runs along the Blue Ridge Parkway for several miles and crosses back and forth over the road about a half dozen times. 
Around 11:30 I came out at a trailhead at Jennings Creek. Two other hikers were there waiting on a shuttle to the Middle Creek campground. I had been debating whether to go to Middle Creek. I didn’t want to lose much hiking time since I hoped to get eighteen miles today. On the other hand, I understood that the campground had great food. The shuttle pulled up just as I arrived so I threw my pack in the bed of the truck and climbed in. 
I have been aggressively trying to take in calories to keep my weight up. Despite gaining five pounds before the start of my hike to help offset the expected loss, I checked a couple of weeks ago, and I had lost eighteen pounds! So today I ordered the bacon double cheeseburger with onion rings. I drank two cans of Mountain Dew and had a large bowl of ice cream for dessert. I’m carrying more food in my food bag, too. I don’t like having the extra weight in my pack but I have to maintain my strength. Rather than trying to count calories, I’m eating as much as I can as often as possible.
I had a big surprise at Middle Creek. After ordering my food, I went into their recreation room to wait for it to be cooked. As I stepped into the room, there was a hiker lying on one of the couches. I suddenly realized it was Spooky, who I hadn’t seen since Siler Bald. I had not expected to catch up with Spooky but learned that she had knee trouble and has been at the campground for five days “rehabbing.” The REST approach (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) seems to be working and she should be back on the trail tomorrow. Hopefully, we will get the opportunity to hike together again. I’m praying that her knee has healed and that she is pain-free as she renews her thru hike to Katahdin. Godspeed, Spooky!
My lunchtime detour took two hours so I knew I was in for a tough afternoon. Speaking of detour, yesterday I met a lovely woman whose trail name is Detour. She was slack packing, but we stopped and talked for a bit before hiking on. Such a sweet lady! Detour lives in Blairsville, Georgia, not too far from Springer Mountain. I learned that she started her hike on March 9th, the same day I did. What I found remarkable is that Detour is hiking the entire Appalachian Trail to Maine by herself at the age of sixty-two. Over the last five hundred miles, I don’t recall seeing a single woman who looked as though she might be around sixty or above. That puts Detour in a class by herself and she has my utmost respect. Hike on, Detour! My prayers are with you.
It was a grueling afternoon with two climbs that totaled more than three thousand feet of elevation gain. I stayed with it and made it to the shelter around 6:00 p.m. It was again a day for wildlife. I spotted two deer, two rabbits, and this little fella. He stood in the trail long enough for me to snap his picture and take a video of him before scampering quickly away. He kept looking up at me like he was hoping I had some food, but as I reached in my backpack to get him something, he took off and went under a log. Little did he know that I carry cheese with me on my hike. I wonder if he would have liked pepper jack? God bless!","Random campsite along the Blue Ridge Parkway

Got over nine hours of rest and woke up refreshed. But once I started hiking, I knew this wasn’t my day. Nonetheless, I was determined to make it to Matts Creek Shelter so that I will be able to get a shuttle in to Glasgow early in the morning.
I had decided my fatigue was brought on by the two steep climbs yesterday afternoon. I had done the 2,000’ ascent right before reaching camp and knew it had taken a lot out of me. However, in speaking with other hikers today, many were experiencing the same malaise. After two straight days of rain, the sun was beating down on us most of the day; therefore, it was possibly the heat and humidity. 
Regardless of the cause, I took it slow with frequent breaks. On each stop I removed my pack. The straps were cutting into my shoulders more today, and I needed the relief. My slow and steady approach worked, and I walked into Matt’s Creek Shelter at 5:22 p.m.

Weather radar station 
The first climb of the day took me to the top of Apple Orchard Mountain. As I neared the top, the trees opened up to a huge meadow and a weather radar station that sits on the summit. The views were a bit unusual as everything below was enveloped in a sea of fog. Meanwhile, the sun was brightly shining on me.
On my way down from Apple orchard Mountain, I passed under The Guillotine, a curious rock formation where a large boulder is suspended above the trail between two huge slabs of rock. It always looks as if it could drop at any moment. I hiked under it. . . quickly! For most of the day, I felt like that huge rock had fallen on me.
 Do I really want to hike under that?
Finally, I passed the Thunder Ridge Overlook, which has a stone observation platform and some incredible views. In the afternoon, I stopped to filter water and ate my lunch. When I felt like I couldn’t go further, I hung my tarp up so it would dry out from the rain. Then I pulled out my camp chair, sat down and took a thirty minute break. Once my tarp was dry, I packed up and hiked some more. The key is to just keep walking. I know there will be days like this, but hopefully, not too many of them! God bless!","Cornelius Creek Shelter

To get to the trailhead I had to cross the longest foot bridge on the Appalachian Trail. The bridge is nearly 1000’ long and spans the James River. The river was calm as I walked across causing the sunlit clouds to be reflected on its placid waters. The simple beauty of this tranquil scene reminded me why I love being up at daybreak. So much of God’s marvelous Creation appears in the early morning hours, and those who do not rise early lose the chance to behold it’s wonders. 
When I got to the trailhead, I pulled my camp chair out of my pack and waited for Charlie to come from Stanimal’s 328 Hostel to shuttle me to Glasgow. Within ten minutes a car pulled into the parking lot and the driver asked if I was waiting on a shuttle. I replied, “Yes” and got in. As we headed to drop off two other hikers, I found out that Charlie was in Florida on vacation and Stanimal was filling in. He was my driver! I had wanted to meet the operator of this hostel but wasn’t sure I would get to. It’s been great getting to know Stanimal (his trail name) and gaining insight into how he built not one but two hostels on the AT that have great reputations among hikers. Stanimal is a fabulous guy who has a love for helping hikers; in fact, it’s difficult for him to turn any hiker away even when his hostel is full.
This evening all hikers were fed a free supper at St. John’s Episcopal Church. The church does this evening Monday evening since the local restaurant is closed on Mondays. They’ve done it now for seven years, feeding any hikers who show up with only one condition: you have to let them take a group picture of all the hikers after dinner. A small price for such a delicious meal. While there I got the opportunity to meet Dave Vanosten and his wife. They are not only church members but also retired FBI agents. Dave was one of the officers who responded to the mass shooting on the campus of Virginia Tech in 2007. He said the recent shooting in Buffalo brought back memories of that horrible day in Blacksburg. We discussed the stress law enforcement officers are under and how our lives have changed for the better since retirement. Once again, it’s the people that make a thru hike special, and Dave and his wife are just two of many. Thank you for your service and for putting your lives in harm’s way to protect others.

I hiked all day with Scott Beckwith, a section hiker from Orlando, and Out and About, who is thru hiking. There was one notable point on the hike today. I had read about it but wasn’t sure where the exact place was on the AT. 
There is much history to be found on the Appalachian Trail, and one of the saddest occurrences took place on Bluff Mountain. In a clearing among the trees near the crest of the mountain is a memorial to the youngest person to hike Bluff Mountain alone. Little Ottie Cline Powell was four years old when he climbed to the summit of the mountain. 
Ottie Cline Powell’s parents, Edwin and Emma Belle Powell, had a nearby farm that Edwin worked with his brother, James. When not farming, Edwin was a circuit riding preacher. On November 9, 1891, Ottie was at Miss Gilbert’s one room schoolhouse. The weather was overcast and chilly with a threat of rain. Miss Gilbert sent the children out to gather firewood because most of the kindling had been used up when it snowed the week before. Little Ottie was one of the youngest and smallest of Miss Gilbert’s students. He wouldn’t turn five until later in November. 
When the other students returned from the recess, Ottie wasn’t with them. When he couldn’t be found, Miss Gilbert sent the students home to get their parents and their neighbors to come help search for the missing boy. By evening the rain began to fall and an ice storm was approaching. Weeks passed and there was no sign of Ottie Cline Powell. No one thought to climb Bluff Mountain to search for him. 
It wasn’t until April 3, 1892 that hunters going up an old trail chased their dog up a side trail on Bluff Mountain and found the remains of the lost little boy. Medical experts concluded that Ottie had died of exposure in the below-freezing temperatures his first night on the mountain. He had fallen asleep before the rain and never awakened.
In 1917 the U.S. Forest Service built a fire tower on Bluff Mountain. Remains of that tower are visible today and lie just a short distance from where Ottie Cline Powell’s body was found. I stood there today and looked down at the concrete block with the bronze plaque placed in memory of the little boy who died on Bluff Mountain over a hundred years ago. I felt the heartache as a parent thinking of his tragic ending. 
The dates on the plaque disagree with records from the time of the events, but there is no dispute that Ottie Cline Powell’s death shattered the lives of his family and the community. And years later the tragedy is still revisited by Appalachian Trail hikers who cross Bluff Mountain and are introduced to a four year old boy named Ottie Cline Powell.","Stanimal’s 328 Hostel/Glasgow, Virginia

Then they moved it onto the trail and placed it in a small hole they had dug. They were about to fill around it and tamp it down. The rock will become a step on the trail to make it easier for hikers to descend without falling. As always, I thanked these men multiple times for the work they perform.

There was a short climb early, but the big one came right after I ate lunch. Once I crossed the Tye River, the trail began to rise. It continued its ascent for the next three and a half miles, a total elevation gain of 3,064’ to a crest on Three Ridges. It really wore me down. I made frequent stops to hydrate and catch my breath. There were lots and lots of rocks. Rocks of all shapes and sizes. On several occasions, where the trail was all rock and went nearly straight up. I had to pull myself up with my arms.

Perhaps it was the way in which it was presented, but things of the past never caught my interest.
As I’ve aged my view of the past and relics of it has morphed into a fascination with history. Maybe that’s because I’m now a relic myself. In other words, the past and relics of it carry a sentimental value which didn’t exist before. Old cars, old tools, old weapons have an attraction to me now.
As I’ve hiked the Appalachian Trail, I’ve passed small cemeteries from a past era, old homesteads that have turned to ruins and stone walls now covered in vines and leaves. Such was the case today. Though it was less than five miles before Waynesboro, I hiked past an old family cemetery with fading headstones. Then the trail went by a homesite where a house had once stood.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651617,"There is a special joy that comes from meeting and interacting with the other hikers on the trail. Different backgrounds, different ages, different countries all united with a single purpose: to reach Mount Katahdin in Maine. All sharing in the same struggles and pain. All experiencing the elation of reaching a summit after a difficult climb or standing in awe as the sun sets on a ridge. A common bond. 
I entered the Shenandoah National Park today and found the trail and the climbs much more to my liking. There were fewer rocks and less steep ascents, though the sun beat down on us and there was a thirteen mile stretch without a water source. Nonetheless, we covered over twenty-one miles before getting picked up and shuttled back to Stanimal’s 328 Hostel for the night. I will hate to leave Stanimal’s tomorrow as I’ve grown to love the people who have been here. Many have the feel of family, and I occasionally find there to be connections between us. 
For example, today I hiked with five other hikers. Two of those were a couple I had met a few weeks back and seen at several campsites since, Rasputin and Coldilocks (Tim and Nancy). We got the chance to talk today, and I was shocked at the parallels in our lives. They had lived in Cincinnati, Ohio and Denver, Colorado. My wife, who is also named Nancy, is from Cincinnati and my oldest son lives in the Denver area. They knew the same places I have frequented in both cities. We each like goetta, a meat and grain sausage served in the Cincinnati area. Like me, they are both runners,and we have all done the Flying Pig Marathon in Cincinnati. 
Rasputin and I have both run ultra marathons. We even have a similar medical scare. Mine was when I felt something was wrong with my heart, called a friend who is a doctor and ended up with a stent in my left anterior descending artery (the widow maker). 
Rasputin was about to go for a run and felt extreme fatigue. He called some friends in the medical field and was told to go immediately to the hospital and tell them he thought he was having a heart attack. Doctors found he had a blood clot and fortunately his heart was so strong he suffered no damage. However, he was told that two more hours and he would have had irreparable damage.
I love how our lives have intertwined. And I will forever share an affection for these friends who I have met on a narrow trail that meanders through the Appalachian mountains. Hopefully, we continue to create new memories together on the trail as we hike north. God bless!","Rockfish Gap/Stanimal’s 328 Hostel

For most of the day, I hiked with Lost Cause (Chris Buckalew). Lost Cause has reserved a room for us tomorrow night at Big Meadow Lodge.
The deer were out this morning. We saw lots of them feeding as we hiked by them. It’s unusual to walk so close to any wild animal as we did to these deer. I even stopped in my tracks as I saw a doe walking up the trail towards me. She continued on as I pulled out my phone and captured her on video. I can never get enough of the wildlife we see on the AT.
Right after Lost Cause and I stopped for lunch, it began to rain. And continued to rain even when I got to camp. I spent the afternoon soaking wet and cold. Even with a raincoat and rain pants I felt a chill. It wasn’t until I got my tarp and hammock up and could strip off my wet clothes that I began to feel better.

Though the rain stopped late this afternoon, the dense fog caused a mist that felt like rain and soaked you thoroughly.Deer feeding in the rain.
Lost Cause and I hiked together all day. He had reserved us a room at Big Meadows Lodge. I was glad we made arrangements to stay because it let us dry out some of our gear. We also did laundry and ate at the lodge restaurant. I had their 10 oz. steak for supper, and it was delicious! Big Meadows Lodge is named for a large grassy meadow nearby where deer often graze. The main lodge was built with stones cut from the Massanutten Mountain in 1939 by the Civil Conservation Corps and mountain laborers. The inner parts of the lodge were made from native chestnut trees, which are now virtually extinct. It is a gorgeous, quaint place to stay.
Despite all the rain, I enjoyed hiking today. I had on my rain jacket, so I didn’t get cold as long as I was moving.  There were a few climbs but nothing as steep or as rocky as a week ago.

During breakfast I mentioned that my son had run the Georgia Death Race. Blood Beard replied, “I ran the last twenty miles of GDR this year with my brother-in-law, Matt Walker.” I showed him a picture of Brad at the finish line with the time clock in the background and Blood Beard said, “I think Matt finished close to your son.” It turns out that Blood Beard’s brother-in-law was 61st and Brad was 64th overall. They finished the seventy-four mile course just twenty minutes apart. He said, “I probably saw your son cross the finish line.” 
The four of us left Big Meadow Lodge right after breakfast and began hiking in an effort to do seventeen miles and get to U.S. 221 where we would get a shuttle to Open Arms Hostel in Luray. The weather was the nicest we have had all week with the sun finally shining. It made for some great hiking. 
By late morning we had gotten to Skyland Resort. We decided to eat lunch; so for the second time today we sat down and consumed a large meal. In the Shenandoahs I’ve finally been able to eat enough to keep my weight up.
As Lost Cause and I left Skyland Resort we noticed the fog rolling in just like yesterday. We spent the afternoon socked in again. Water droplets fell on us and the thick mist got us damp from head to toe. At times it was difficult to see the next white blaze ahead of me. The wind had also picked up and gave me a chill at times.
I expected Blood Beard and Beats to catch up to us, but they never did. I later learned that after we left Skyland, Beats realized she had left her credit card at Big Meadows this morning after breakfast. Thankfully, the card was located, and they will retrieve it tomorrow. Meanwhile, Beats and Blood Beard had hitchhiked to Luray ahead of us. We all made it to Open Arms Hostel and then had a large dinner at a local Italian restaurant. That’s three big meals today. I felt so much better with all the food in me today.

The mist gave the woods an eerie feeling, almost mystical. It would move as the wind pushed it through the trees. Droplets of water would fall on me. The dense cloud obscured my vision and occasionally prevented me from being able to see the white blazes which mark the trail. 
The trail was easy to hike today. I arrived at the Elkwallow Wayside by 10:30, hoping to get a blackberry shake. I had heard so much about them. People had insisted that I stop at the waysides and get one. Big Meadows Lodge didn’t have the milkshake; although, I did get the blackberry pie, which contained blackberry ice cream. Today was my last chance to get a shake before leaving Shenandoah National Park. I asked for one but was told that the grill wasn’t open and wouldn’t be until tomorrow. I could return tomorrow and get a blackberry milkshake. I told the clerk I couldn’t walk back for one, and no matter how much I pleaded never got to experience this treat.
The miles came easy all afternoon and by 6:30 p.m. I got to Tom Floyd Wayside Shelter, which is outside the National Park. Just as I exited the park, the sun pierced through the clouds, the fog lifted and suddenly everything was clear again.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652022,"Last night was interesting. When I couldn’t find a decent spot to hang my hammock, I went to the shelter. Since I had no air mattress, I slept on my underquilt and quilt. Though not my preferred sleep system, it still was enough for me to get a decent night’s sleep. That was in spite of seeing the mouse run across the rafter right before I dozed off. None of my gear showed signs of being gnawed on this morning, so I guess I survived unscathed.
There was some light rain in the night, but it quit just after I woke up. I left the shelter by 6:45 to make sure I got to US 522 before 8:45 to meet the shuttle to Stumble Inn. My pace was noticeably slower after racking up the miles a day ago. David picked me up and after retrieving another hiker, Timothy, took us to the hostel. Within an hour of arriving at Stumble Inn, the bottom fell out. It stormed for over an hour. Other hikers arrived completely drenched. I made the right call to push on to Tom Floyd Shelter last night. When I walked in and David introduced me this morning, another hiker said I think I know you. She did. It was Fancy Pants who I met last fall. I was finishing the Pinhoti Trail and she had just started it.
What a great place the Stumble Inn has been! David and Danielle are former AT thru hikers. I’ve felt right at home here. After a shave and shower, I did laundry and charged my electronics. Then David took all the hikers to town where we ate and resupplied.Hiker trash outside the grocery store.

After a breakfast so delicious I hated to leave the table, David at Stumble Inn shuttled us back to the trailhead. Finally we had perfect hiking weather. No rain, no foggy mist. No thunder and lightning. It was refreshing to walk the green tunnel in cool temperatures with a light breeze. 
No longer in the Shenandoahs, I wasn’t sure how the trail would be. Surprisingly, I made excellent time but found that the trail could use a lot of maintenance. The flora had grown over the trail for large sections. Bushes brushed against my arms and shoulders. Briars scratched against my legs, and limbs slapped me in the face. Because the trail was still muddy from the rain, I had to watch my step so that I wouldn’t slip and fall. While looking down, I was more susceptible to catching a briar or branch to the face.
At lunchtime I got to the trailhead at Tucker’s Lane where there was a picnic table with hikers sitting at it. Stan the Man and Monarch were two of those hikers. We enjoyed lunch and then hiked together this afternoon. My plan had been to stay at Whiskey Hollow Shelter, which is .3 miles off the trail. I left Stan the Man and Monarch and hiked to the shelter. When I got there, however, I found there was not a good place to hang my hammock. This is becoming a redundant theme at shelters. 
After failing to find a spot to hang, I decided to continue on the AT, so I hiked the blue blaze back to the trail. I was surprised to see that Monarch and Stan the Man were still sitting there. I explained my situation. They were hiking to US 50 where Niki, a trail angel was picking them up. Monarch called Niki who invited me to come with Stan the Man and Monarch and spend the night. She even had a cold Mountain Dew waiting on me when I got there!
I went from having no place to stay to a hot shower, wonderful meal and comfortable bed. Niki is fantastic! It is common for hikers to use the phrase, “The trail provides.” I know, however, where these blessings come from. My Lord takes care of me. In unexpected ways, He provides comfort, protection and peace.
Then I received a message later this evening warning hikers that there was a woman dressed in black at Whiskey Hollow Shelter, where I had planned to stay. She was acting paranoid and delusional.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652155,"I hope I never underestimate the danger involved in what I do. Thru hiking is not only very strenuous, it’s also extremely dangerous. That fact hit home this afternoon as I learned that a hiker in his 20’s had fallen from McAfee’s Knob and was seriously injured. He fell about 50’ from the popular hiking destination at about 6:00 a.m. Social media comments have now reported that he has expired. 
Two and a half weeks ago I stood on the ledge where this young man was today. I gazed out at the expanse far below. While there I was cautious not to put my life in danger by getting too near the edge. I had descended from Dragon’s Tooth the day before and stood on ledges no more than a foot wide. One misstep could have had a similar result as this young hiker today.
Thru hikers can never let our guard down. We are one step away from serious injury or death. During our hike today, Stan the Man was tearing it up, climbing the uphills like a mountain goat. I couldn’t keep up. Didn’t try. Suddenly he tripped and did a face plant on some rocks. I heard him yell ahead of me and knew instantly that something bad had happened. Fortunately, his injuries were minor: a bloody nose, lip and chin and a scraped arm. The truth, though, is that his injuries could have been very serious: fractured facial bones, broken teeth or a concussion. 
What we do is dangerous. We must always be conscious of that and never get complacent. At the end of the day when my legs get tired, it’s easy to stump my toe and take a fall. I’ve learned not to do two things at once, e.g., don’t talk on the phone or eat or look at my watch while continuing to hike. Stop and do the task before walking again. Since slowing down, I’ve had few falls and no injuries. 
It’s comforting to know someone watches over me. I pray nothing terrible happens to me on the Appalachian Trail but realize that what I’m doing is quite dangerous. Today’s events made that very clear. God bless!Today we rode the roller coaster.","Ashby Gap/US 50

Niki Dunn has let Monarch, Stan the Man and me stay with her and even shuttled us back and forth to the trail each day, allowing us to slack pack. That was a huge relief as we hiked The Roller Coaster in very hot weather. She also made us supper, took us to the local outfitter and had cold drinks waiting for us when she picked us up each day. Niki has been amazing!
We finished the Roller Coaster today, but not before leaving the state of Virginia. A fourth of the AT lies within that one state, and because of that, hikers are sometimes said to get the “Virginia blues.” I’ve had no such malady. Virginia has been a terrific experience with the Grayson Highlands, Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs and Shenandoah National Park among the highlights. 
As we crossed into West Virginia, I had downloaded John Denver’s “Country Roads” on my iPhone and turned up the volume so we could sing along. It felt so good to enter another state, though it will be for a brief time. West Virginia also offered some nice views at Raven Rocks. 
The afternoon, however, was tough since temperatures were in the high 80’s and we had a long stretch with no water sources. Monarch didn’t realize that and ran low on water. Late in the afternoon she showed signs of heat exhaustion so I hiked ahead to a shelter where a side trail led down to a spring. I filled up all our water containers and met them back at the trail where Monarch had fallen asleep. The cold water revived her, and we hiked the final three miles to the trailhead. There was our trail angel, Niki, waiting with cold Gatorade and strawberries!

Harpers Ferry is the home of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters. It is a historic town that has been here for centuries. It is also considered to be the psychological halfway point on the AT. Hikers who flip flop will typically begin their thru hike here and go north or south before coming back and heading the other direction.
Niki, our incredible trail angel, dropped Stan the Man, Monarch and me off at the Key Gap trailhead this morning, and we made our way the six miles into Harpers Ferry. The area was first settled in the early 1700’s by Peter Stephens, and soon after that, Robert Harper bought 126 acres of land and received permission from the Virginia General Assembly to operate a ferry here. The town is still small but has a storied history, particularly John Brown’s raid on the U.S. Armory and Arsenal.
First on our to do list was to visit the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. We had been told by two hikers that it was closed today but were thrilled when we arrived and found it open. A staff member took our photos and logged us in. My original number at the start of my hike was #1053. Today I was ascribed #488, meaning there have been just 487 hikers to check in at the ATC prior to me.
From the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, we hiked past Jefferson’s Rock, which is so named because Thomas Jefferson stood on that site and marveled at its view. Then on to the Town’s Inn, our home for the night. It is a quaint old building in the old part of town, a very relaxing place to stay. In fact, it’s so relaxing that I fell asleep for several hours this afternoon. I definitely needed the rest. Harpers Ferry has been just what I needed. God bless!

This afternoon we left Harpers Ferry but not before receiving some terrific trail magic from 2001 AT thru hiker, David Beares, his daughter, Olivia, and son, Max. They met us in Harpers Ferry and slack packed us. It was a hot day, around 90°, and there were no water sources on this ten mile stretch, so we needed to carry extra water. David, Olivia and Max hiked in and met us at Weverton Cliffs. What an incredible view! We looked down on the Potomac and back towards Harpers Ferry. I even saw a bald eagle fly past the cliffs while we were there. It was definitely worth taking the blue blaze to get to see.
From there Monarch, Stan the Man and I hiked on to Gathland State Park while David and his kids drove there and hiked in to meet us. They also brought supper! At the park, we sat under the pavilion and enjoyed Five Guys hamburgers and fries, ice cold Coca Cola, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, along with an assortment of other snacks. It’s great to see former thru hikers giving back. I know Miss Nancy and I have provided trail magic to a lot of hikers along the Florida Trail, bringing many of them into our home.

No sooner did I lie down than I began seeing tiny lights flashing throughout the park. A host of lightning bugs were randomly illuminating the recently mowed field and woods that surrounded me. I don’t remember when I last saw a firefly. But I was able to lie back and enjoy the light show until I fell asleep.
Last year Stan the Man provided trail magic to a couple of young thru hikers on the Appalachian Trail. Wizard and Killer had begun an AT thru hike in 2020 and had to get off the trail at Franklin, NC because of COVID. They started all over again last year and completed the entire trail. At 7:00 a.m. Wizard arrived at the state park to slack pack us. He carried our gear ahead to Wolfsville Road. Meanwhile, he picked up lunch at Subway and brought it to us at Washington Monument State Park. 
During lunch Wizard entertained us with some of his magic tricks, using a few simple coins. I have no idea how he was able to make the coins suddenly disappear and reappear! But I do know that his remarkable ability earned him a very fitting trail name. After eating, we hiked the blue blaze to the first Washington Monument, a giant obelisk that until last week had been closed for repairs. I was able to climb the spiral stairs and take in the extraordinary view. Most folks don’t know that before the towering monument on the Mall in Washington D.C., there was a tribute to our first President erected on South Mountain in 1827.

Wizard left us after the monument, and drove to Wolfsville Road where he parked and hiked in to meet us. I enjoyed his company this afternoon despite the rain that dampened things a bit.

All I had to do was get a dentist to reset the crown for me. To my disappointment, the phone calls to local dentists were futile. The best I came away with was that one dentist could see me on July 5th. Really?!!! I should be over four hundred miles from here by then. I’ll have to figure out a way to get it reset somewhere ahead.
Meanwhile, Tonya was having stomach trouble yesterday, and after we set up camp, she began throwing up. The vomiting continued all night and into the mid morning today. Since Monarch couldn’t hike, Stan the Man and I decided to hike out. We covered almost ten miles before stopping and Pen Mar State Park, only .3 miles before reaching the Pennsylvania line where Stan’s sister picked us up.

Since we are staying with Stan the Man’s sister, Sue, and her husband, Mark, we got to go with them to King Street Church in Chambersburg, PA this morning. I felt revived as the music and message really lifted me up and renewed my sense of purpose on the trail. The scripture today came from Ecclesiastes and centered around being careful of what we say and the promises we make to God. But I was drawn to the first three words of the chapter: “Guard your steps. . . .” No only does that contain my trail name, but it also touches my life in many respects. I’m constantly on guard as I hike, being guarded with every step I take. One moment without focus can result in injury. We must also be guarded in our daily walk, lest we fall. Our lives have many ups and downs. We may be sailing along with no worries until we suddenly stumble; therefore, we must always guard our steps.
Mark taught the Sunday School class and further delved into Ecclesiastes chapter five. His presentation of the lesson was excellent, making us think about what we believe to be important and whether we truly put God above the other things we love. 
The afternoon provided me with time to reach out to my family. Calling and FaceTiming them was special; I miss them so much! Still, I can’t wait to get back on the trail.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652612,"Today’s hike had several significant points. The first came quickly after leaving Pen Mar Park. Less than half a mile from the park we crossed the Mason Dixon Line. Not only does it mark the boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania, but it was once the demarcation between slave states and free states. During the Civil War, it divided the South from the North. Even today, the Mason Dixon Line represents the border between two cultures. Since I am Alabama born and raised, crossing the Mason Dixon Line symbolized a departure from the way of life I grew up in: sweet tea, grits, hoecakes, collards, “Yes ma’am”, “y’all”, Saturdays in the fall and Sunday dinner after church. I had reservations about how I would be received. Though I’ve been “up north” before, I’ve never stayed for more than a week. Now I’ll be here for about three months. Are folks up here gonna be able to understand me when I talk? Just in case, I’ve arranged for a translator. Stan the Man is a New Yorker and is willing to assist me in communicating. I just have to finish the hike before September 3rd. Alabama’s first football game of the season is that day! Saturday in the fall. Roll Tide!
The second point of significance today came as we met Stan’s sister, Sue, at Pennsylvania Highway 233. That is where I passed mile 3,000 on the Eastern Continental Trail. I’ve done every step from Key West, Florida to Caledonia State Park in Pennsylvania. I have now surpassed three thousand miles, and I’m not done yet. The ECT stretches up into Canada. I won’t go past Katahdin this year but hope to finish next summer.Three thousand miles on the Eastern Continental Trail

So this morning Stan the Man, Monarch and I went to Caledonia State Park and set up under one of the pavilions. We had coffee, pastries and fruit, and we cooked bacon and eggs. Later, at lunchtime, we grilled hamburgers and hot dogs. 
We had no idea how many hikers to expect. Yesterday we hiked the nearly twenty mile stretch from Pen Mar to Caledonia and met one thru hiker. But today! We were greeted early by my dear friend Polaris. It has been probably two months since I saw her last and so much has changed. Then E.T. walked up, and I recalled the day she and Polaris spent hiking with me. What fond memories! Other friends I’ve grown close to on the trail continued to appear: Slooper, Dreamer, Kris Kringle, Sherbert, Fever Pitch, Dogfish and others. There were also some hikers that I met for the first time. Our amazing trail angel, Niki Dunn, even drove an hour and a half each way to be here. It was very much like a reunion on the trail with around forty hikers joining us along with many of Stan’s family.
I was reunited with hikers I’ve met along the trail.
By 1:30 p.m. we were out of food, and rain was approaching. The last of the hikers had packed up to head on. And as soon as we had loaded everything into the car, the rain began to fall. The timing was perfect. To cap off Monarch’s birthday, Stan the Man and I took her to see Top Gun: Maverick. A great finish on a rainy afternoon before hitting the trail again in the morning. These moments will be imbedded in my mind far beyond Katahdin, and the friends I’ve gained along the way will be remain a part of me forever. God bless!","Caledonia State Park

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652695,"I was at Miller Family Dentistry before 7:00 a.m. They were the only dental clinic nearby who would agree to get me in and fix my crown without making me wait over a month. They were so nice! Dr. Miller reset my crown and had me headed back to the trail by 7:30. I have to give them a shout out for the fantastic job they did. Today at 1:20 p.m. I reached the halfway point on the Appalachian Trail. From here on, the distance is less than I’ve already hiked. For Monarch it was an emotional moment, but for me, it simply meant that I need to repeat what I just did, hike another 1,097.15 miles. A few miles later we passed 1,100 miles. Tomorrow will be three months since I began this hike. In that time I’ve learned a lot about myself, some of which I already knew. I learned that the grit and determination in me won’t let me quit, no matter what anyone else does. I’ve found real joy in the different people I’ve met and hiked with, to the point that there is now a bond that has developed between us. I care about each of them and want those who are hiking to all reach Maine with me. And finally, I have learned to accept whatever God gives me, whether blessings or trials. To be thankful for the gifts and to grow through the testing. There has been both.Halfway
Stan the Man and I ended the day by participating in the Half Gallon Ice Cream Challenge at Pine Grove State Park General Store. I hadn’t intended to attempt the challenge, but it is a fun part of the AT tradition, so I decided to have a good time with it. My strategy was to eat a flavor that was light and for that reason decided to go with orange sherbert. I also intended to eat until I was full but stop as soon as I felt uncomfortable. Because the Hershey ice cream half gallon containers only contain 1.5 quarts, I had to consume another pint to complete the half gallon challenge. For that I elected to eat vanilla, essentially turning my ice cream into a cream sickle.
Stan the Man finished before me, but we both completed the challenge. Neither of us got sick, and I felt really good afterwards, although my tongue was frozen! I even ate a good supper this evening at Mark and Sue Brenneman’s home. Thankfully, we had fresh strawberries for dessert and not ice cream! God bless!","Caledonia State Park

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652747,"There are times when we reach our breaking point. How we respond will be what defines us. Today Monarch reached that critical juncture where her body had done all that it could do, stepping over and on top of rocks, climbing repeated ascents and even scrambling over a couple of boulder fields. She had reached the edge and could not take another step. In tears she let us know that she wasn’t able to hike the remaining four and a half miles.
A few hours earlier, as Monarch, Stan the Man and I were finishing lunch, Polaris walked up. She joined us as we resumed hiking, though she could have easily hiked on and left us since she’s a very strong hiker. We enjoyed her company as we made our way through The Maze and other parts of the trail which had lots of rocks.
With four and a half miles to go, Monarch was in crisis mode. Her body could not keep hiking. She felt as though she was holding the rest of us back. She doubted her ability to make her way to Katahdin. The negative thoughts were overwhelming her. And that’s when I realized why Polaris was with us. She stepped forward and asked Monarch if she could give her a hug and Monarch said, “Yes.” It was just what Monarch needed at that moment. I asked permission to pray with her, and I asked the Lord to give her strength that she didn’t know she had.
Suddenly, Monarch had renewed energy as we hiked on. She covered the four and a half miles without needing to stop. I can’t explain it except that God renewed her strength. I’m thankful Polaris was there to provide the impetus for Monarch to relax so that she and I could pray together. 
Monarch will have other moments of self doubt and fatigue. But when she does, she would be well-served to recall how she responded today and realize that today helped define her as a hiker. A strong, independent woman who refused to quit despite her body telling her it was done. I see her climbing Katahdin in my mind and in three months my vision will be reality.

",Boiling Springs/Home of Mark and Sue Brenneman,"Jun 09, Thu",19.20
Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652799,"On our hike this morning out of Boiling Springs, we passed through quite a few farms. I felt right at home walking by rows of corn and soybeans. I wanted to just stop and stare at the wheat fields as they swayed back and forth to the morning breeze, their color enhanced by the bright sunlight. 
Right before noon we came out at a roadway that would take us over I-81. But before crossing the traffic-filled interstate, I saw a little farmer’s market on the side of the road. A winding dirt lane led to a farmhouse where I could hear a goat bleating. As soon as we walked up, a young fella with a straw hat hopped in a bicycle and peddled quickly up the lane from the house. No adult was there at the tiny market, but it was full of good things. Fresh fruit, cold drinks such as Gatorade and milk, and homemade strawberry ice cream.
I had to have the strawberry ice cream. I also bought a pint of the chocolate milk. This was raw milk, not pasteurized, such as you buy in stores. It was also nice and cold, which I prefer. And it was in a glass bottle, not something you get every day. I don’t know when I’ve ever had a better glass of chocolate milk. It was so delicious! Stan the Man had to try it after I bragged on it, and he, too, praised it as some of the best he’s ever had. We returned the glass bottles so they could be washed and reused.
What impressed me the most was the boy who waited on us. He told us he was twelve, which is about what I would have guessed; although, he was not very big for his age. He handled himself well as I watched him conduct over a half dozen business transactions. He wrote in a log book each item as he sold it. Although he did the math in his head, he still used a calculator to total all the items purchased. He was extremely polite and knowledgeable.
Standing there watching him, I saw another boy about his age. He, too, was standing in a farmer’s market. This one in Florala, Alabama over fifty years ago. Mother and Daddy ran the curb market there for several years, supplying it largely with the produce we grew on our farm.  Not only did my brother, George, and I help Daddy gather it, we also sold it. If a customer wanted five pounds of peas, I weighed them out, bagged them and rang up the sale. I also helped carry items such as watermelons to their cars. As I gazed at the boy today, I admired his maturity and saw in him a reflection of myself. It gave me a greater appreciation for who I was back then. At the time, I was just doing what I was raised to do. In hindsight, I had mastered valuable skills and learned to transact business with adults before I had even reached my teens. That is very rare these days. God bless!","Boiling Springs/Home of Mark and Sue Brenneman

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652855,"What an enjoyable hike it was today! Despite all the rocks (After all this is Rocksylvania!), the people and surroundings made for an incredible experience. It started early as Stan the Man, Monarch and I came out of the woods and began climbing through a field. I looked across at the adjoining hay field and saw a doe and her two fawns come out of the treeline. Mom kept a watchful eye out as the two little ones jumped and darted behind her. Their white tails were all pointed skyward as they dashed up the hill away from my direction. The twins were having a grand time frolicking in the freshly cut hay.
The hayfield that served as a playground for two fawns.
A little further on the trail, I came upon Dogfish. She and I then hiked together for the next few hours. I’m thankful I had the opportunity to spend more time with this lovely lady. We had met first at Woods Hole Hostel. I learned that she and I both started our hike on March 9th from Amicalola Falls. Dogfish lives in Las Vegas where she works at the casinos as a dealer. She got on an 11:00 p.m. flight to Atlanta on March 8th and began her hike around 9:30 a.m on the 9th. I have no idea how she was able to do that without a good night’s sleep.
She has a very unique voice, sorta high pitched and squeaky. I love to hear her talk! And as we walked, I let her speak. She grew up in China and is forty-three years old. She came to the United States to live when she was twenty-four. She had previously visited when she was in high school and had come to stay for a few weeks with a host family. Her parents are divorced and her mother lives in America, but her father and grandmother are still in China. She hasn’t seen them since before the pandemic but will visit in the fall after she concludes this hike. I hope we get a chance to be together again. Dogfish is a very happy, positive and friendly person; she is so much fun to be around.
We reached Duncannon today and were met by three beautiful trail angels. Chrissie and her husband, Doug, drove over an hour with their daughter, Katie, to meet us and bring some trail magic. They then treated us to lunch and ice cream before we had to leave them and get back in the trail. The visit was short, but hopefully we can see them again before we leave Pennsylvania. I’m so touched by the love we’ve been shown by strangers such as Chrissie, Doug and Katie. It’s wonderful to see such kindness without the expectation of something in return.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652889,"The most difficult part of this hike has been leaving those I love behind. I’ve never been away from my wife, Nancy, for more than two months. That was when I hiked the Florida Trail in 2020. Until I began thru hiking, we had never been apart more than one week in all our forty years of marriage.
I also miss my three children and six grandchildren. It was especially difficult leaving little Henry who was born just a month before I began my hike. Despite being able to FaceTime them occasionally, I still miss them all greatly. 
I’ve always been close with my brother and sister who live on farms in Alabama. We’ve been able to talk at least once each week. However, I miss going to the farm and seeing them.
There’s one more that tugs on my heart strings. Who’s always the happiest to see me when I walk in the door. Our dog, Olive, is a black and brown long haired chihuahua. We rescued her from animal services three years ago. She will be four in July. Though she would have nothing to do with me when we first got her, we’ve now become inseparable. She insists on going wherever I go and has done lots of day hikes with me. I left her at home though this time.
As we hiked up the trail just after crossing Clark’s Valley Road this afternoon, I looked ahead and saw a family with their two dogs coming towards us. One of the dogs came on by, but the other one, which was smaller,  turned and ran back up the trail. I immediately felt a sense of loss. The lady she belongs to chased her down and caught her, but I had this sudden, intense longing to see Olive. The little dog was a black and brown chihuahua with white on her underside. Her name is Mabel, and she is a four year old rescue dog. She and Olive could have been twins except for the white.Olive
Mabel was just adopted four weeks ago and is extremely skittish. She finally calmed down enough that she let me pet her. But doing so made me miss Olive even more. At least seeing Mabel was like getting to pet Olive while I’m on the trail. That will have to last me until I return home, and she goes berserk as soon as I walk in the door.

",Campsite at Mile 1171,"Jun 12, Sun",16.75
Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652940,"Yesterday we got to the campsite just in time to set up camp before a thunderstorm hit and poured down for over thirty minutes. It’s been a while since I’ve seen the rain come down that hard. The water poured off my tarp so fast that I could have filled my water bottle in a matter of seconds. (I have used that technique before when low on water.) After half an hour, I was worried that Monarch’s and Stan the Man’s tents might flood because the water kept getting deeper and deeper. Thankfully, it quit when it did. As for me, I was high and dry in my hammock with my tarp providing plenty of coverage.  Heavenly sunlight on a flooded trail.
That all leads me to today’s hike. The trail this morning was a quagmire in most places. Rather than trying to avoid stepping on the rocks, I was rock hopping to stay out of ankle deep mud. But it was to no avail. Eventually there was nowhere to step but into the mud. I felt bad for Monarch’s little Maltese, Zoby, whose mud caked legs left him with four black legs instead of four white ones. They got washed off, however, when the trail turned into a river with water flowing down it for long stretches. I joked and said, “I think there’s a movie about this. It’s called A River Runs Through It.” So perhaps it wasn’t about the Appalachian Trail, but the title sure fit the AT today!
Around noon we came to Stony Creek where beavers have built a dam causing flooding across the trail. Last night’s rain exacerbated the problem. For me, it was similar to many places I hiked on the Florida Trail so I proceeded on across once I determined it would not be more than waist deep. My depth gauge was my trekking pole, which was almost completely submerged. I carefully picked my route, so that the water only got up to my knees. Stan and Monarch followed me, wading through the cool, dark waters safely.
The afternoon was highlighted by a double dose of trail magic. Jinx had contacted Stan and wanted to offer us some trail magic near Green Point School Road. As we were sitting in the shade enjoying her drinks, snacks and other goodies, Camo and Coins showed up with more food, drinks and treats. Camo had thru hiked the AT last year. These trail angels make such a difference in the life of a thru hiker. A welcome respite from a hard grind. Lifting the spirits of tired, sometimes struggling, hikers.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653004,"Our morning was spent hiking nine miles to PA 501 where we were picked up by Stan’s friend, John McBride. John also brought along sandwiches and drinks for three hungry hikers. The rocks were challenging today, but thankfully there were no steep ups and downs. The state is living up to its nickname, Rocksylvania. And they come in all sizes and shapes. Even with the rocks, though, I have enjoyed hiking Pennsylvania thus far.John and Christine McBride welcomed us into their home, allowing us to shower, do laundry and charge our electronics. John then drove us all the way to a Walmart so that we could resupply. My water filter had begun to fail so I bought a new Sawyer Squeeze which I’ll attach to a Smart Water bottle. While John waited for us in the car, Monarch, Stan the Man and I bought our resupply and went back to where John was parked.
I grabbed the door by the frame as I went to get in the car, my right thumb inside the open window. Just as I did so, John raised the car windows, including the one my thumb was in. My thumb was suddenly smashed between the glass and the side of the door frame. My cries of “Let it down! Let it down!” filled the Walmart parking lot as John, Stan and Monarch turned to see what was wrong. By the time John realized and lowered the window, my thumb was already black and blue and throbbing in pain. 
The pain in my thumb had eased up even before we stopped and got ice to apply; however, the shock of what happened had made me nauseous. I began to feel faint and thought I was going to vomit so John pulled over to the curb. We sat there a bit while I had dry heaves. Eventually, my nausea began to let up, and we drove back to John and Christine’s home. 
As I type this, my right thumb is swollen and black, but the pain is manageable. The prayers of saints have certainly been heard, and God has answered. I’m thankful the injury was not serious and that I’ll be fine to hike in the morning. Thank you to those who lifted me up in prayer. God bless!","Campsite on the ridge at mile 1187.4

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653063,"We often focus on the minor flaws and fail to see the beauty of the picture as a whole. Small blemishes draw our attention as we neglect to appreciate the near perfect landscape about us. I’m often guilty of worrying and fretting over some insignificant detail while failing to recognize that it is just that: insignificant.
This morning my thumbnail was mostly black, but thankfully the pain was considerably less than I had anticipated. It would have been simple to focus on my injury, the bruising and the swelling. To become sensitive to the pain as I gripped my trekking pole in my hand. To worry about reinjuring it with a fall. But instead I shifted my thoughts to the glory surrounding me.
John and Christine McBride had breakfast waiting on us when we awoke this morning. After a hot cup of coffee, I sat down to a delicious breakfast casserole and plenty of fresh fruit. Afterwards, John drove us back to the trail where I expected to encounter lots and lots of Pennsylvania rocks. Instead, the trail was relatively flat and not completely rocky. There were stretches of smooth terrain in between some that had various size boulders.
In all, it was such a pleasant morning that I failed to focus on the minor discomfort coming from my thumb. At lunchtime, John and Christine met us at PA 183 with sandwiches, cold drinks and snacks. Again, it was hard to worry about my sore thumb with so much to be thankful for surrounding me. I hated to say goodbye to this sweet couple. I know how bad John must have felt about the injury to my hand, but that’s life. He has no reason to feel bad about what occurred. Things like that just happen.
One thing that has been repeatedly emphasized to me on the trail is the fact that things will go wrong. And when they do, you keep hiking. You don’t let the small stuff interfere with your overall plan and goal. You focus on what needs to be done to take another step forward, even if it means taking a step back first. 
The six miles this afternoon passed quickly as the trail again was unlike the horrid image that had been painted in my mind by others who decried the rock-strewn trail in Pennsylvania. As with my thumb, I’ve chosen to focus on the miles of level or rolling trail and the parts with few rocks instead of condemning the state based on a few difficult parts. Does my thumb hurt? Yes, of course. But the beauty of the people and environment around me make the pain insignificant! God bless!","PA 501/The home of John and Christine McBride

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653124,"As a long distance runner, I’ve experienced nearly every malady you can have that affects the feet and legs. From Achilles tendinitis to IT band syndrome to black toenails, I’ve had it all. That includes a bout with plantar fasciitis that took a long time before I recovered. The healing process took me several months during which I rode a stationary bike and did not run a step.
Since before I met her on the trail, Monarch has been battling plantar fasciitis in both her feet. Some days the pain is worse than others. Today was perhaps the worst yet. The rocks in Pennsylvania have been hard on her feet. She struggled to make it the 8.7 miles to Port Clinton. We stopped there for lunch, and she didn’t think she could go any further. However, after we ate, she pushed on to the shelter which was another 6.4 miles.
From my personal experience with PF and from talking with others who have dealt with it, the only way to recover is to get off your feet, which she doesn’t want to do. I’m concerned that if she keeps hiking, her feet will not heal. I also know that the rocks don’t end when you leave Pennsylvania. Her struggles here may be minor compared to what she will face in New York, New Hampshire or Maine. The odds are not in her favor.
Monarch said today that she didn’t understand why her feet haven’t healed since there have been many who have prayed and asked God to heal her. Of course, God also expects us to do what we can to help in the process. Unless she is willing to take time for her feet to recover, God may not heal them. 
For now, it appears she is determined to take one painful step after another until she can’t take another. God bless!Port Clinton","Eagle’s Nest Shelter

We have the picture to prove it. The photograph was taken while we were standing on Pulpit Rock this morning. Stan the Man comes from a Mennonite background. Last night he stayed in the Windsor Furnace Shelter with Slowjourner, who is a retired Lutheran minister. And I retired in 2015 after serving for twenty years as pastor of Yellow River Baptist Church.
I’ve enjoyed hiking with these men of God. Before we set out this morning, the three of us prayed together, seeking God’s blessing upon us as we continue our journeys and also praying for comfort for Monarch who is suffering from plantar fasciitis.
This morning Monarch’s feet were better and she was able to cover the sixteen miles today without any huge problems. Some of that could be attributable to the fact that she got a good night’s sleep. 
Pulpit rock had too many clouds to get a view. However, by the time we reached the Pinnacle, the sun had burned off the fog and gave us gorgeous views. We had to be careful where we stepped, though. I counted a total of three copperheads lying among the rocks on Pinnacle.

The plan had been to stop there for water. After filling up, we waited for Monarch, and waited, and waited. After thirty minutes we began to get concerned. Stan hiked ahead a short distance where a couple of hikers told him they passed her earlier. Fearing she might be in distress, I left my pack and ran back down the trail for just over a mile. When I didn’t find her, I called her phone and she answered. She was already a mile and a half past Thunderhead Lodge. She said she didn’t need water and had looked for us but didn’t see us so she kept going.
I ran back up the trail to where I left Stan the Man with my pack. As I neared him, I looked up to see where he was, and in that instant I tripped on a rock and went face first down on the trail. My phone flew forward and both hands hit the rocks while my face hit the ground. Fortunately, nothing was broken. Though stunned and hurting, my hands were neither bleeding nor broken. My phone had no damage, and my face was merely covered with dirt. The only blood was a small puncture on my arm that was bleeding. Thank the Lord!
An hour or so later, Stan and I caught back up with Monarch just before reaching the Knife’s Edge. This was one of the most treacherous stretches of trail I have hiked. Huge boulders formed a narrow ridge on which the trail ran. A missed step could mean serious injury. A fall could result in death. I took my time, inching my way along. As I’ve aged, I’ve lost quite a bit of my balance. With a thirty pound pack on my back, it’s even worse.  I was relieved when I finally finished the Knife’s Edge, only to find that the descent from Bake Oven Knob was every bit as unnerving. This stretch of trail is supposedly one of the five most difficult sections on the Appalachian Trail. And I believe it!
 Stan the Man led the way across the Knife’s Edge.
There was a long stretch with no water after we ate lunch. We opted not to go down the blue blaze to retrieve water at the shelter. The report we got was that it was about a mile round trip to get it. That was the best decision we made all day.

One evening in north Georgia, I was on a road walk with nowhere to pitch my tent. Billy Nicholson was working in his field next to the road, and we spoke to each other. As we talked, he asked where I was going to spend the night and I said, “I hope they’ll let me pitch my tent behind Evans (gas station).” Billy told me to come back after I ate supper at Evans, and I could stay in his barn. That sounded great to me, except the place in his barn was nicer than some folks’ houses. I slept soundly in a nice warm bed in his fully furnished man cave.
During my visit, I mentioned my plans to hike the AT this year, and Billy said, “Let me know when you get to Lehigh Gap. I’ve got a place there you can stay.” Well, this morning we hiked into Lehigh Gap. As we did, I remembered what Billy had said and sent him a text message. A short time later, I got a call. Once again, Billy Nicholson has given me a home for the night and this time, Monarch and Stan the Man as well. Thank you, my friend, you are truly a trail angel. You have blessed this old hiker once more, and I’m forever grateful.
While we hiked this morning I thought of all those who have no father in their lives. There can be an absence for so many reasons, but there is always a void when dad is not in your life. In my case, Daddy went to be with the Lord in 2000, and I’ve missed him every day since. So many times I’ve wanted to ask his advice on something I was struggling with. He has been present during this hike. Daddy was a tireless worker who would work from sunup to sundown. He was persistent and never called it quits until a job was done and done right. And he was a man of deep faith. I’ve seen that throughout this hike . . . in myself. Thank you, Daddy. I love you!","Campsite at Mile 1257.5

It was a slow ascent and a taste of what awaits us in New England. But it was so much fun. My heart was racing the entire time. I felt like I was hiking in Colorado. The rocks and scrambling were just what I’ve experienced there. 
 We reached the ridge after probably thirty minutes. From there the AT follows a new route that offers more views but also more rocks. In all, the whole day was filled with rocks. Stan’s daughter, Carissa, met us around 2:00 p.m. with Subway sandwiches and cold drinks. We sat down in the shade and enjoyed the meal before saying goodbye.
My feet felt the jagged rocks more today. I’m glad I‘ll have new shoes waiting on me when I reach Delaware Water Gap. The consensus was that today had some of the worst rocks yet.

We also grabbed some sandwiches and snacks for lunch as well as a pint of ice cream for each of us. We were then blessed by a trail angel who picked us up as we were hitching back to the trail. What a relief not to have to hike the extra mile! Once back at the trailhead, which Monarch had reached while we were gone, we filled our water bottles and consumed our sweet cold treats.
Then it was a steep climb up and lots more of the sharp stones, aptly described by one hiker as sharks’ teeth. They were literally biting into the soles of my worn Altras.

As usual, I was awake at 5:00 a.m but lay there in the hotel room for another thirty minutes so that I wouldn’t disturb Monarch or Stan the Man. Finally, I got up, shaved and brushed my teeth. Then it was next door for a cup of hot coffee at Dunkin where I sat quietly and had my morning devotional.
I knew Monarch would want coffee so I carried a cup back to the room. We had breakfast at the Village Farmer and Bakery, and then I headed to the post office to pick up my new pair of Altra Olympus 4’s. The comparison of the new with the old told the whole story. The rocks of Pennsylvania had destroyed my old pair. The tread was gone. The outer sole had mushroomed out. The fabric was torn. The toe cap was pealing back. Even the color of the shoe had changed. But these shoes got me 675 miles on some rough terrain without injury. I can’t ask for more. Hopefully, the new pair takes me all the way to Maine.
During the afternoon I lay down and dozed off for a few hours. Much needed rest! Our bodies are miraculously designed to heal while we sleep. By tomorrow I will be recharged and ready to tackle New Jersey. God bless!","Delaware Water Gap

Stan and Tonya are outside their tents looking at the colorful sky from Kittatanny Ridge where we are camped. Suddenly they yell, “There’s a bear!” Sure enough, a black bear was standing about fifty yards from us as he ate the blueberries, which are all around our campsite. He slowly wandered up the ridge near the trail before disappearing. Hopefully, he doesn’t return tonight.
We delayed leaving Delaware Water Gap this morning because rain was in the forecast. There were showers in the night, but they had stopped by the time I got up at 5:00 a.m. and went next door to Dunkin. I sat alone and enjoyed a cup of coffee as I had my quiet time. The rain began again as I walked back to our hotel room and fell steady all morning. 
The Apple Pie Bakery provided an early lunch which got us hiking at 11:00 a.m. We crossed the Delaware River on the I-80 bridge as cars and trucks sped past us in the rain. A concrete barrier separating us did little to protect us from the spray that was sent up by semis and buses. I was glad I was wearing my rain gear.
We got to the Mohican Outdoor Center hoping to pick up Monarch’s hiking boots. As I was waiting for her and Stan at the road, an Amazon delivery truck passed by headed towards Mohican Outdoor Center. A few minutes later it came back by. Sure enough, Monarch’s boots arrived just ahead of us. I’m sure her feet will feel much better with new shoes.

Folks are sometimes curious whether I carry a gun or bear spray for protection. On the AT I don’t have either. If you don’t cook or eat where you sleep and you hang your food properly, you don’t need to fear a bear attack. Most black bears have run from me as soon as they saw me. The bear last night didn’t run, but that was only because he was busy eating blueberries. He paid no attention to us. He was too focused on gathering berries.
We were up early to watch the sunrise and on the trail before 7:00 a.m. It wasn’t far to Catfish Fire Tower which offered some fine views from atop the ridge. There were some nice views today, particularly the Fairview Lake view from the ridge. 
New Jersey has rocks and climbs but nothing too extreme. There was one climb that involved the use of my upper body to pull myself up. That was the only difficult one today. 
We hiked to Culvers Gap where we were met by Dawn Seely, a trail angel. After supper at the Mountain House Tavern and Grill, Dawn drove us to her home for the evening and will have us back on the trail early in the morning. God bless!","Campsite on Kittatinny Ridge (mile 1308.9)

Ned and Dawn Seely have been incredible trail angels, welcoming Monarch, Stan the Man and me into their home. Dawn prepared a delicious New Jersey breakfast for us before dropping us off at the trailhead. She was kind enough to slackpack us today and even brought us sandwiches and cold drinks at a road crossing for lunch. It doesn’t get any better than that if you are a thru hiker!
We have been checking the status of Kristian Morgan’s FKT (Fastest Known Time) attempt for the past few days. Monarch and Stan had met Kristian in the Shenandoahs on his way to Georgia. The current FKT for the Appalachian Trail belongs to Karl Sabbe who completed the entire trail in 41 days, 7 hours and 39 minutes in 2018. Kristian’s goal is to finish in 40 days or less. To set an FKT, he must average 54 miles a day, which is mind boggling. He’s currently on pace to do that. 
We knew Kristan’s pace would put him passing us sometime today so we were looking over our shoulder all day long in anticipation. Dawn had brought us lunch at Deckertown Turnpike, but we left there at 12:45 p.m. without seeing any sign of Kristian. He arrived there around 3:30, and Dawn was there for his arrival. She then drove to pick us up at County Road 519. Unfortunately, we were done before Kristian reached 519 so we didn’t see him, and tomorrow he will be past there. 
Dawn was able to get some photos and videos of Kristian on his way to setting a new FKT on the Appalachian Trail. I will share some of those images with you. Best wishes, Kristian, and Godspeed!

I’m also thankful that Ned and Dawn were willing to provide us with transportation to church and then back to the trail. 
Despite the afternoon start, we were able to hike nearly 14 miles. This was possible because Dawn invited us to stay another night in the Seely home and slack packed us again. The heat today made for a difficult hike even without having a full pack. But there was trail magic that helped us stay hydrated and beat the heat. Then Dawn picked us up when we finished.

I was thankful that Ned and Dawn Seely had invited us to stay another night with them.
Dawn had us back on the trail before 1:00 as the rain subsided. Just a few miles in we reached the Pochuck boardwalk. This long expanse of raised trail passes through some beautiful wetlands. There were scores of birds and flowers among the reeds and grasses.

Our easy path on the boardwalk ended, however, and a mile later we began the climb up Stairway to Heaven, a rocky ascent of nearly a thousand feet. It was a slow gradual climb that took me more than forty-five minutes to reach the top, drenched in sweat and totally exhausted. I paused a few minutes hoping Stan the Man and Monarch would catch up, not knowing they had stopped at the road below for a break.
I pushed on and reached the Warwick Turnpike where I again stopped to wait. Within minutes, Monarch sent a text informing me that our shuttle driver would pick us up there instead of Longhouse Drive.  Our shuttle dropped the three of us off at the Warwick Drive-In. There I set up my hammock for the night. It’s been nearly fifty years since I last went to a drive-in, but this was my first time doing so without a car. From my hammock, I could see the largest of the three screens as Jurassic World: Dominion played before me. Unfortunately, the show began after 9:00 p.m., well past my bedtime.

After packing up, I walked down to the bagel and coffee shop nearby and had breakfast while waiting on Stan the Man and Monarch. Stan’s friend Try Try had offered to drive us back to the trail and slack pack us.
Some of today’s climbs made me extra thankful I was not carrying my full pack. On multiple occasions I found myself abandoning my trekking poles in favor of letting my hands pull me up. Mid morning we came up on two other hikers. One was my friend, Lost Cause, who I hadn’t seen since we left the Shenandoahs. He had to get off the trail for a few days because of an injury, but since healing, his pace had picked up, and he caught up with me,
We didn’t stop for lunch til reaching NY Route 17A where we downed several hot dogs at Top’s Dogs and then hiked up the road to Bellvale Creamery where Try Try treated us to ice cream. I had an orange/vanilla shake that was very refreshing!
We then loaded our packs back up with all our gear for the last seven miles of the day. Those seven miles had several tough climbs, requiring both strength and balance.

They are from Maine and started hiking the AT at the same time. What makes their story so unique is that Laughing Loon has a son the same age as Apollo. Both young men played high school basketball in Maine. During their senior year the boys’ teams played one another. In that game Laughing Loon’s son broke Apollo’s nose. Now Apollo and Laughing Loon are hiking partners. They met one another their second day on the trail and have been hiking together ever since. 
Today was spent climbing up and down over countless rocks and boulders. Hand over hand on several occasions where a slip would mean critical injury. One of the most challenging of these is known as the Lemon Squeezer. It is a large crevasse in some broken boulders that required removing my pack and handing it up before I could pass through the narrow passageway. Just beyond it was a sheer rock face that I scaled by finding a few handholds and inching my way up the side of the massive rock. I had already handed my backpack up to Lost Cause, who had scaled it ahead of me. As he and I proceeded on we passed a sign at the blue blaze around that short section; it read, “Easy Way” with an arrow pointing towards the blue blaze trail.
I hiked with my good friend, Lost Cause, most of the day. We had been together through the Shenandoahs until he had to get off the trail for a while because of cellulitis in one of his legs. But he’s a fast hiker and caught up with us yesterday. Our goal was to reach Black Mountain so we could see the New York City skyline at night. Lost Cause and I got to Black Mountain around 6:00 p.m. and located four spots to tent or hammock on the ledge at the summit. Monarch and Stan the Man arrived about an hour later.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653896,"Thru hikes are full of ups and downs, tests and trials, aches and pains. As I have hiked the Appalachian Trail, the most difficult aspect, for me, has been the need to hike my own hike. The Hike Your Own Hike (HYOH) mantra is not new and any seasoned hiker understands what it is and why it is essential for a successful thru hike. For the second time in the last four months, I have had to separate from hikers I love dearly so that I can hike my own hike. The details of that first critical juncture can be found in my journal post of April 29. In that instance, I found that my friend, Birdman, and I differed greatly in our hiking abilities, philosophies, preferences and experience. Despite my urging, he would not go on and allow me to hike my own hike. Consequently, I had to leave the trail and suspend my hike for a week. 
Upon my returning to the trail, so did the joy. This hike has provided many thrills, not just through the physicality it has required and natural beauty I’ve observed. The greatest thrill has been the people I’ve met and come to love. There are so many. Some I may never see again but will remain in my heart. Others I will continue to communicate with and be dear friends forever. And some are family and their families are now family to me. 
Tonya (Monarch) and Stan (Stan the Man) are family. We’ve hiked together for over a month. Been together every night during that time. Laughed together. Cried together. Felt each other’s pain. And picked one another up when one of us was hurting. That’s why it’s so difficult for me to hike my own hike. 
Joined by much more than a common bond of hiking.
Before I began, I promised my son, Jameson, I would finish in time to go elk hunting with him in Colorado in September. It’s something that has become an annual father/son event for us. I anticipated finishing the AT by mid to late August. I also left a newborn grandson behind whom I haven’t seen for four months. That has tugged at my heart strings, not to mention how much I miss my wife, Nancy, and my children and remaining five grandchildren. 
Though Stan and Tonya are incredible hikers who would normally stay right with me, they both are suffering from ailments that limit them from pushing the miles. Tonya has battled plantar fasciitis for months and recently has discovered that she has poison ivy. Stan’s hiking has been hindered by groin pain while I have felt strong and capable of greater daily miles. 
I love them both and initially rejected their urging to go on, to hike my own hike. Alas, they are both right. When my friend and former hiking partner, Chris Buckalew, caught up with us and discussed us hiking together again, I knew what I had to do. It does not mean I won’t hike again with Stan and Tonya, in fact, we will be together in a few days in New York City for the 4th of July. 
I pray that my dear friends’ health is restored and that we can all finish together on Mount Katahdin. But I also understand the necessity to hike your own hike. And for the second time, I’ve been forced to make that difficult decision. Please lift up Tonya and Zoby and Stan as they continue on, as I will also do. We know not what the future holds.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653973,"High temperatures were expected today so Chris and I were hiking by 6:00 a.m. We loaded up on water at our first water source and drank plenty throughout the day. At the ten mile point, a blue blazed side trail led to Canopus Lake Beach where a concession stand had hamburgers and cold drinks. We hiked the extra mile there and back to the AT to get the food and plenty of cold fluids, knowing that the afternoon would be a real test. 
Because the temperature was going into the 90’s, we devised a bailout plan. We would hike five miles to where there was a road crossing. Then we would evaluate how we felt, our water supply and the time before deciding whether to stop and get a shuttle or continue as originally planned to NY Route 52. Since we both felt good at the bailout point, we kept hiking but stopped periodically to sit and rest and to hydrate. Chris and I arrived at Highway 52 by 6:00 p.m. and hiked another half mile down to Corrado’s Pizzaria  where we rewarded ourselves with a large pie. They even offered to have one of their delivery drivers to take us to Le Chambord at Curry Estates where we have reservations tonight. What a hiker friendly business! And delicious pizza, too!
I did receive some sad news this evening when Tonya let me know that she and Stan had to leave the trail. Her poison ivy has spread, and she is going to an Urgent Care facility in the morning. I had planned to ride into New York City with them on Sunday. Plans change. Since I have hiked thirty-nine miles the last two days, I can reach the Appalachian Trail Train station tomorrow and ride it into New York.

Soon after I began, a hiker approached me from behind. 

Double Great was slack packing. He was off trail for a couple of days because of intestinal issues but is back hiking again. Double Great is the second member of the Warrior Expeditions I have met on the AT. Rabbit is now up ahead in Vermont. Double Great was in Afghanistan three times while serving. He and his wife now live near Ft. Bragg. I learned that he trained on helicopters at Ft. Rucker near my hometown of Florala, Alabama. Double Great graduated from Florida State University and was there at the same time as my daughter. He and I had a wonderful visit as we logged miles along the wet and rocky footpath. I let him know how much I appreciate his service and the sacrifice he made for our freedom.
My destination on today’s hike was the Appalachian Trail train station, which is actually located on the AT. It brings hikers to the trail all the way from New York City, and, likewise, carries hikers into the Big Apple. Since Stan’s daughter, Courtney, wasn’t picking us up, I needed another way into NYC, and the train was the perfect transport. It currently runs only on weekends and holidays and only picks up hikers to go to New York at 2:35, 4:35 and 6:35 in the afternoon.
The trail was not as difficult today, and I had a quicker step since I knew I would reunite soon with Nancy. The combination had me at the train station by 1:45. Abby, a section hiker from Chapel Hill, was already there waiting, and we caught the locomotive as it rolled through and headed to Gotham. I love trains. Maybe it’s because my Grandaddy Justice was an engineer, but the ride to me is so pleasant. I love being able to see the countryside as you roll along the tracks.
I arrived at Grand Central Station and with full pack on and trekking poles in hand strolled through that sea of humanity. The subway took me to Times Square where I got on the A train uptown to 181st Street. My niece met me as I arrived and, following a shower and NY deli sub, I’m ready to get some much needed rest.

For a hitter in baseball, if your timing is off a fraction of a second, it produces a strikeout instead of a line drive. For someone in sales, being able to close a deal at the right moment is critical to success. When I started the AT on March 9th and said good bye to Nancy, I wasn’t sure we would see each other again until I finished, which could be as late as September or even October. Along the way, I made futile efforts to arrange a way for us to connect without success. Among the impediments to our rendezvous were 1) I didn’t want to be off trail for an extended period of time, 2) Nancy would need to be able to fly to a location fairly close to the trail and 3) I would need to be near that destination around the time she arrived, which could vary greatly depending on my hiking pace, weather, terrain, injuries and a number of other factors. 
It wasn’t until I reached Pennsylvania that I realized with some certainty that I would be near New York on the 4th of July. Nancy has a niece in NYC and has always wanted to see the Macy’s fireworks display on the 4th. So I reached out to her niece, Lindsay, and she invited us to come and stay with her and her husband, Beau. I called Nancy and suggested a meet up. She was looking at flights before I got off the phone! 
I still needed to get into the city from the AT. When I had to hike ahead of Monarch and Stan the Man, I no longer had a ride with them into New York; however, the timing was perfect as I reached the train station located right on the Appalachian Trail on the very day I needed to head into NYC. With perfect timing, I walked across the tracks to the station less than an hour before the train pulled in.
A few weeks ago, I talked to one of my best friends, Bob Wilson. Bob and I coached our sons as they were growing up. Bobby and Jameson were best friends, and Bobby, formerly a major league catcher, is now the catching instructor for the Texas Rangers. Bob said to let him know if I happened to be in New York when the Rangers were in town. 
Texas Rangers catching instructor, Bobby Wilson.
Again, I was astounded by the timing. The Rangers were playing a three game series against the New York Mets with the last game taking place on the afternoon of July 3rd before they headed to Baltimore.
Bobby got me a ticket to today’s game. So I took the subway to Citi Field to see Bobby. Unfortunately, Bobby couldn’t get a field pass for me for this game, but I at least got to see him and talk briefly before he went to work. Although he’s now married and the father of three beautiful girls, he’s still the same little boy I coached many years ago. And he still loves this grand game of baseball.
The Mets defeated the Rangers 4-1 at Citi Field.
I didn’t stay to the end of the game but left in the 6th inning because Nancy’s flight had arrived at LaGuardia. She got to Lindsay and Beau’s shortly ahead of me, but it was a sweet reunion. The four of us immediately caught the subway down to the 9/11 Memorial. We walked down Wall Street and took the ferry to Staten Island. As the sun began to set we boarded a ferry to midtown Manhattan. It took us past the Statue of Liberty as the sky behind her was bathed in orange, her silhouette displaying the torch in her raised right hand. Again, the timing was impeccable.
Nancy enjoyed sightseeing in New York, including the Oculus at the World Trade Center.
Just as my timing was right forty-one years ago to meet a cute little blonde at church my first month in law school, this weekend everything has happened like clockwork.

This morning I took her to a local deli for breakfast. You can’t pass up a bagel in New York. 
Then we took a stroll through Central Park. There’s always a lot of activity in the park, but with today being a holiday it seemed much more so. Among the sights we took in were Belvedere Castle, Strawberry Fields and Bethesda Fountain, although we were disappointed to find the fountain was not running. A fountain without water is far less captivating.
I’m often remiss for pushing the pace and distance, forgetting that Nancy isn’t a runner/hiker as I am. She tired after a couple of hours. After all, she had flown from Florida yesterday morning and then toured lower Manhattan and Staten Island later in the day.
We returned to Lindsay and Beau’s apartment to rest up for tonight’s fireworks display. Nancy loves fireworks, and the Macy’s pyrotechnic display on the East River is as good as it gets. Five barges set off more than 48,000 shells in this forty-sixth edition of the spectacle. We were able to meet Tonya and Stan along with his daughter, Courtney and her fiancé, Dave, in Queens to view the fireworks together. It was great to get to see my sweet friends again. I’ve missed them and Zoby so much!
For this old country boy, the crowds were overwhelming. I’d much rather watch from my seat in front of the television or, better yet, be in bed asleep by the time the first explosion occurs. But I knew this was an event Nancy would love so I toted along a folding chair for her to rest in until the show began and had the greatest thrill, not from the bombs that burst above us, but from the joy on her face as she gazed into the night sky. From our vantage point in Queens, the brilliant bursts of colorful light reflectiing in the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan were indeed breathtaking.
The Empire State Building’s patriotic colors were visible across the East River.
Nancy had an experience that isn’t likely to be replicated, but I still have one more offering for this year’s anniversary. Tomorrow night she and Lindsay are going to see The Music Man on Broadway. One of Lindsay’s dance students is in the performance, which stars Hugh Jackman. As Nancy and her niece take it in, I’ll already be asleep, preparing my body for a return to the trail, anxiously awaiting what gives me a much greater thrill than even the largest of fireworks displays can produce.

For her it’s tonight’s Broadway performance of The Music Man. Nancy has been elated since learning that she and her niece, Lindsay, were going. So it’s girls’ night out to enjoy Hugh Jackman and an all-star cast as they revive Meredith Willson’s 1957 musical gem. It was worth the price of their admission to watch Nancy light up upon finding out they would be attending. I can’t wait to hear how they rate the performance.

They got to meet with Lindsay’s former student who is in the show, and she confirmed that Jackman is always very upbeat, often being the instigator of some of the shenanigans that take place on the set. Nancy went so far as to place Music Man at the top of the Broadway performances she has attended. Needless to say, I am currently in good standing as I leave to complete my AT thru hike.

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654349,"Right now, I’m lying on a gurney in a hospital gown in a hallway of Hartford Hospital. How did I get here? By an ambulance from the ER in Sharon, CT.
If you read yesterday’s journal, you know what a bad day I had yesterday. I got a great night’s sleep and woke this morning feeling energized with a spring in my legs. My heart, however, still felt different. Like it was in a vise and was being squeezed. I also had pain in my back between my shoulder blades. Symptoms similar to those I had in 2018 when I had my heart attack. As I started my hike, I noticed that I had shortness of breath and was lightheaded. At the top of my climb, a hiker named Lavender came up behind. She’s an ICU nurse from Salt Lake City. Lavender stayed with me all the way down to the road and from there I road walked into Cornwall Bridge, CT and called my cardiologist. 
Dr. Mayes told me to go to an ER. I found a couple at the Cornwall Country Market and asked if they would take me to an ER. It turned out that Dan is a firefighter and his wife is a nurse. They took me to the ER in nearby Sharon where I was poked and prodded by some wonderful medical professionals who were so kind and caring!
After an EKG and blood tests, the doctor diagnosed me with unstable angina and had me transported to the cardiac unit at Hartford Hospital. I will likely have a heart catheterization tomorrow. If all goes well, I intend to finish this hike, but that’s not in my hands at the moment. Fortunately, I know who holds the future, and He is able! God bless!","Silver Hill campsite

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654376,"To me, one of the great joys of life is not knowing what lies ahead. No matter how much you plan, the unexpected will occur. Through it all we grow. As life unfolds, we frequently look back and see God’s hand at work. I can’t imagine how boring our lives would be if we knew ahead of time what was going to take place. I certainly didn’t expect all that took place yesterday or this morning.
Last night I lay on a gurney in the hallway of Hartford Hospital for four hours waiting to go to a room. It was after 9:30 when they finally wheeled the gurney in a room and left me on it. No hospital bed. No bathroom. For the next five hours nurses came in more than half a dozen times to stick me with needles and draw blood or to run an EKG or check my vitals. Then at 3:00 a.m. a nurse woke me to tell me I was discharged. “Discharged,” to me, meant they were kicking me out with nowhere to go.
I had a number of trail angels who were willing to help me, but I would never call them at that hour. When I gave objection, the nurse went out of the room and came back to tell me that I had to leave the room, but they would let me sleep on the gurney in the hallway til 7:00 a.m. With that, I was pushed back out into the hallway. No doctor ever discussed their diagnosis or the results of their tests. I saw no doctor or physician assistant before being released, though I heard a nurse tell another patient it was their protocol that you had to first see a doctor and a PA prior to being discharged.
I was released without a heart cath or stress test and told to have my cardiologist follow up. Consequently, I’m on an Amtrack train headed to Alabama. Nancy will pick me up in the morning in Anniston. I’m extremely disappointed in the way I was treated at Hartford Hospital because the ER in Sharon, CT was nothing like that. The care provided in Sharon was excellent. But life gives us the unexpected. I didn’t expect to have this sudden feeling in my chest. I never expected to end up in Hartford, Connecticut. And I definitely didn’t plan to be on my way home from the trail. 
I’ll get evaluated further by my own cardiologist and let him guide me in making a decision. I don’t intend for this to end my hike of the AT. The journey has been amazing regardless of whether I reach Katahdin, be it this year or in the future. The people I’ve met have had a profound impact on my life, and I hope I’ve touched theirs as well. Even those of you who’ve read this journal have given me strength and encouragement. And through it all, God has guided me along the way, even through the unexpected. Until the journey continues. . . God bless!","CT Route 4/Cardiac Unit of Hartford Hospital

Steps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654532,"When I posted my last journal entry I was fairly certain that it would be my last for quite a while. But I find myself compelled to follow up on this saga.
I returned home last night and was at my cardiologist’s office when they opened at 8:00 a.m. this morning. As soon as I told the receptionist my symptoms, she asked was I experiencing them at this time and I said, “Yes.” Almost immediately, a nurse came out with a wheelchair and took me next door to the ER at Sacred Heart Hospital - Emerald Coast. There I went through another battery of tests, just the same as in the two Connecticut hospitals. Once again I was told that my EKG and my troponin levels were all normal. There was nothing to indicate a heart attack or blockage of my arteries. The ER doctor presented me with the results and asked what I wanted to do. In other words, if I wanted to go home, he would discharge me. I insisted there was something wrong and wanted to find out what it was. He told me he would confer with Dr. Mayes, my cardiologist. 
A short time later someone from the cath lab walked into my room and told me I was being taken for a heart catheterization. Dr. Mayes had told the ER doctor, “He never complains, so if he complains, there’s something wrong.” I woke up from surgery with a second stent in my left anterior descending artery (the Widowmaker). There was a blockage of 75-80% right next to my other stent. Thankfully, I know my body well and listen to what it tells me, even when medical professionals disagree. I’m also blessed to have a cardiologist who knows me so well and realized I needed the heart cath.
And so I’m grounded temporarily. There will be no running or hiking or lifting for a period of time. I did get approval to go for short walks. By September I should be cleared to elk hunt with my son, Jameson, in Colorado. And perhaps get in a 14’er while I’m there. As for the AT, I will “never give up on a dream just because of the time it takes to accomplish it.” Thanks for all the prayers! God bless!","Amtrack train headed to Anniston, Alabama
