Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648160,"I woke up in Dawsonville GA at a hotel with my parents. I chose to sleep in until about 8am. We had breakfast at Papa’s Place. It was a little hole in the wall that was clearly family owned. I had a big breakfast to fuel me on my way. We then went to a goodwill in search of a Bible to cut up for me to have the psalms and proverbs with me on my trek.
After checking in yesterday and speaking with Bob and Richard, who are volunteers with the GA AT club, we decided that I would leave some of my gear and a lot of my food in the car. I would then hike with only a minimal weighted bag. This process is known as slack packing.
I got my picture taken at the arch to the AT Approach trail. I then kissed my parents and started a little before 11am. I made good time going up the 604 stairs that climb next to the Amicalola Falls. I met several people who were encouraging when they learned I was attempting to hike to Maine. Notable people were: Alicia, because she was carrying her little 9lbs dog. That’s right she had the dog in a little sling/bag thing. She said the dog had some issues and didn’t walk very well. I also met Robert “Moss” and Roslyn “Compass”. They are from Australia. They did the PCT back in 2019 and were planing on doing the AT back in 2020 but because of Covid that got cancelled.
I met up with my parents at the top of Springer Mountain. They had driven around and walked the one mile up. Dad said he was tracking my InReach just find to know where I was. We then walked down to the parking lot together. They had a sub, chips, and other sweets for me to gorge myself on. I then packed up the rest of my gear and headed out. It was only a little under 2 miles down to Stover Creek Shelter. There are probably 20 people here tonight. I set my tent up before I checked the shelter, thinking it would already be full. Turns out only two people are sleeping in the shelter. So lessons learned on that one.","Amicalola Falls

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648161,"I started at Stover Creek shelter this morning and I am sleeping at Gooch Mountain shelter. Last night I woke up to the sound of military helicopters flying right over us. They had to be only a few thousand feet up. And then a few minutes later they came back over us. It took me until this morning to remember that I had been told that the Army Rangers do training in the area.
It’s been an incredible day. I realized that I have developed bruises on my hips where my bag rides. They are red and swollen right now. So I put some ointment on them. It was so challenging today. Some big ups and downs. My check in number is 2109 and I passed my first 1900 hikers today. I didn’t realize I was holding such a pace. Several of the people at Gooch I started with this morning. I passed Hawk Mountain shelter on my way here and all of those people are here at Gooch. We have maybe 60 people here. There is no room to be had. I’m sharing a tent pad with two other tents.
Most of the way here I was playing leapfrog with this guy named Michael a thru hiker. He is from NJ. Seems pretty cool. Has his stuff together. I also was around a couple from Johnson City, TN. They are Justin and Lindsey. With getting in around 4:30pm I had time to meet so many people around the shelter today. Most of the hikers that are here began on 3/28 or before. It’s satisfying to conquer so much at a faster pace. “Skip” and “Stork” (I didn’t catch their real names) said something about everyone being bored so I started a word game. It drew several people in. I think it will catch on. And I have so many other games to bring out from my time at VJ.
Most of the hikers here don’t have a BearVault for their food. Which means their bags are lighter but they can’t stay in the bear warning section tomorrow. They will have to stop just outside of it at Lance Creek. Since I do have a BearVault I will be one of the few to press on to Woods Hole Shelter.
It is supposed to storm tonight and tomorrow. So I will be getting to rest out how waterproof this tent really is.
Forgot to mention that there was a family that rolled in late and couldn’t find a place to pitch their tent. So they ended up crawling under the shelter to sleep. They said they stayed dry. So it worked for the best for them.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648162,"Today has had a lot of things happen. I woke up to the storm around midnight. It was no big deal because I was snug in my sleeping bag and tent. But then I started realizing I was getting rain on my face. So I got my headlamp out and saw the issue. Rain was coming down so hard that it was going under my rain fly and then bouncing on the packed earth of my tent pad up into my tent. It took me a few minutes but I was able to use my rain suit to block it from hitting me. But this left the water to fall down inside my tent, forming a puddle. So I sacrificed my used socks to soak it up. And that is a lesson in why you always carry more than one pair of socks.
I slept well other than that. I was hot my first night so i changed things up by fully unzipping my sleeping bag and using it as a blanket. With my sleeping pad being really warm this worked out well. I will being doing that again.
It was still raining when I woke up but only drizzling. So there was nothing left to do but to do it. So I got up and packed up in the rain. I left Gooch Shelter around 8:30am. I hung some wet clothes off my pack to dry out as I hiked which only worked once the sun came out. There were some great views today. Preacher Rock was just amazing. I stayed to have lunch there.
With having my bearvault I was able to push on into the bear canister required section. I am here with one other hiker. His name is Kurt. He is from Cincinnati. He also has a bearvault. When I was about to take the side Trail off to the shelter I ran into a Ridgerunner. His name is Tom and has done this for 6 years. It’s a seasonal job, from February to May. He is in charge of educating hikers and making sure the trail and shelters stay clean. Tom is 74. He loves this job. It gets him out of the house. It’s a 40 work week (4 days, 3 nights). He loves the outdoors and teaching people. Which is good because Kurt and I had tons of questions.
An hour or so into hiking this morning I think I just came down to hard on my left knee and made it hyper extend. So it has really hurt all day today. I dug out the Arnicare around 3pm and then did it again after dinner tonight. Hopefully it feels up for the challenge of getting out Blood Mountain tomorrow.
I will go up and over Blood Mnt. Into Neel Gap tomorrow morning. I should be at the outfitter there by noon. I had hoped to book a bed at the hostel and get a shower and rest in a bed but I learned from Tom that they are still closed from Covid. So I will just resupply food and push on. Oh speaking of food. I weighed in at Amicalola at 35 lbs. most of that being food. Well now that I’m out here I realize that I am carrying way to much. I still have enough food to last me two days. So I will only do a minor resupply tomorrow.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648334,"So fun story about last night. The wind was just whipping through the shelter. It was just crazy how cold it made it. I was thankful for how warm my sleeping bag was. At around 2am I woke up to coyotes in the distance. I rolled over and thought about how cool that was to hear them. Right as I was about to fall back asleep a coyote howled maybe 30 feet from the shelter. It freaked me out! I was thankful to have the ATC Ridgerunner, Tom, with me in the shelter. I proceeded to listen to the coyotes talking back and forth for the next 30 minutes I guess. I was really awake for a time after that.
When I next woke up at 8:30am I found Tom mostly packed and Kurt already gone. I was slow moving and my left knee and ankles were killing me. I think I hyperextended my knee yesterday and then have been compensating with my ankles. It was so cold I was tempted to just crawl back into my sleeping bag and not move but the saying is “no pain, no rain, no Maine.” Which means I’d you don’t walk through the rain and pain you won’t make it to Maine. So I got up and actually beat Tom out from the shelter. 
Once I did get going I made a wrong turn, or rather failed to turn, at Slaughter Creek. So I went the wrong way for at least half a mile. And then had to back track. As I came up I was praying just not to see Tom. But as I got back to Slaughter Creek Tom was walking up to it. So I put on a bold face and said “Tom! I don’t know if you know this or not but don’t go that way! (As I pointed down the trail I had to back track from)” ohh how he full belly laughed. He thought it was such good fun that I had walked by the turn off at the creek. So there, I’ve made my first trail mistake and I can laugh about it. I’m sure there are many more to come. This one will teach me to only follow the White Blaze.
I slowly made it up Blood Mountain. Each step was killing me knee. The view from the top. I’m glad I took pictures because words will never describe the majesty of these mountains. Even the pictures won’t do it justice. I will have to come back to see it again. The shelter on top is made of stone and it was constructed in 1937. It’s the oldest one on the AT.
I met some people at the top that I had stayed with back at Gooch Shelter. So it was nice to share the experience with some new friends. I ended up coming down from Blood Mnt. With Paul from TN, I’ve met several Paul’s so far. If I thought my knee hurt going up I was not prepared for coming down. It was a rocky trail. It makes the trail to the top of Hanging Rock look like a walk through a manicured lawn.  We eventually made it down to Neel Gap and oh the reward. What a place! I got a Tony’s pizza, which they cooked for me, and a cherry coke. It was the best thing I have ever had. I sat and talked to so many people. I caught up with people I had left behind and met people I hadn’t seen before. I resupplied food for four days and charged my phone. I bought an ankle brace and a knee brace. I am hoping they help. After a good 3 hour break and a plan with Emily and Jebry, I met them at Gooch mountain, and they were at the top of Blood with me. We moved on just one mile to a camp site in Bull Gap for the evening and night. We were the first ones here and not there are around 20 people. We made a fire. I rested my legs. I put Arnicare on them to help them heal. It was a fun evening to talk with people. I met a lady around my age who is doing the AT to finish her triple crown. (For people reading this a triple crown, or triple crowner, is competing the AT, the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail) It was cool to chat with her since I will probably not see her again. She started yesterday at Springer Mountain. She covered nearly 30 miles yesterday and then caught me today. There are actually two people here tonight who did that. I’m impressed! They talked about how it’s all about learning what you actually need in your bag and getting into shape. They said in the next month I will be in the same place. And yes, I started with what I thought was the bare minimal, but already I know somethings I can leave behind. I would have left things today at Neel Gap but I’d kinda like to keep my bear canister and I didn’t want to pay the shipping to send it home.
Well it’s supposed to be below freezing tonight. So here is to sleeping with my water and electronics.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648335,"What a good day. It was hard but good. I started off with my knee and both achilles tendons just killing me. It was freezing cold and that just made them stiffen up. Which made me glad to have slept with all of my water and electronics. I got under way about 8am after a quick breakfast of oatmeal and honey. I took it nice and slow all day to take care of my knee. So I got passed a lot but it’s a long game not a short race to get to the end. I wish I could say getting passed was not big deal but it does still mess with me when people I passed over the previous day, are now passing me. I’m working on that.

>span class=""s1"">In both gaps I went through today I got Trail Magic!! Trail Magic is the special gifts that people give you while you are a thru hiker. The first was just some fruit and coffee. But the coffee was so good. The lady in charge told us about how her husband was diagnosed with cancer years ago and he was out hiking the section we just did afterward. God told him that He would get him through it and give him the compassion to do Trail Magic. It was really sweet. On the way up the next mountain their was a cute little family and the little boy (age 9ish) was out front. He came flying up toward me and was saying things about trail Magic at the next gap. I couldn’t understand him because he was so out of breath and mumbling. His mom got him to slow down and tell me. I asked him a few questions which got him talking more. It was cute.

>span class=""s1"">So over these first couple of days I have been praying “God, just like Jesus went into the wilderness or Moses did, would you show up and make yourself known to me.” I have stood on top of several amazing mountain peaks and looked out on beautiful landscapes, I have slept under a storm when the wind threatened to break the trees, I crossed by a waterfall that is truly incredible. Yet while God’s glory is there in them, He is not in them. The verses in 1 Kings 19 when Elijah went into the mountains to speak with God came to my mind today after pushing on from the Trail Magic. The chapter talks about how a great wind hit the mountain, and yet God was not in the wind. Then an earthquake, and then a fire, but still God was not in them. After these there was a still small voice and that’s when Elijah knew to go out from the cave to speak with God. After thinking of this story while hiking I felt the Holy Spirit move in me and God whisper in a small voice “my son, I will speak when you are ready.” I burst into tears. God said “when YOU are ready.” Me. He is ready and willing. There is nowhere I can go that He cannot find me. Even now, as I write this, tears are running down my face. God is waiting on ME. After all of the things in my life that have been breaking down over the past year there must still be more God has to work in me before I am ready. I know God will speak in His timing when I am where I need to be. I am still struck that God is further down the trail, sitting on a rock, just waiting for me to walk by.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648336,"I’ve come a long way today. It was really cold this morning. I almost didn’t get up. Thinking I would wait until it got warmer. But I did and my knees were so stiff. The left one was hurt really bad. I took ibuprofen with breakfast and got moving slowly at 8:45. It took maybe 20 mins for me to get passed by Zack “glueber” and Anna “Almost”. I let them leave me behind. I was trying to take it slow with me knee. But after about an hour my joints had warmed up and I was moving good. I actually caught up to Almost as she was shedding layers of clothes. After that I forced myself to stick with her. It was a good pace. One I would have done naturally if my knee wasn’t hurt. We talked about life, what got us to be out on the AT, family, jobs, thoughts on society as a whole, etc. She was an Outdoor Education major and has worked in the outdoor industry. We have a lot in common with our passions and what we like to do for work. It was a great talk. It made the morning fly by. I stopped to shed a layer, get water and a snack, around 11:30am and that’s when she pushed on. I made it to Blue Mountain shelter at 12:30ish and found friends. (Emily, Jebry “Moon”, Zack (the guy I checked in with the first day), and Erin. So I stopped for lunch as they slowly moved on. I was going to take a nap in the sun since it was up in the 60’s but Moon said I had to keep my knee moving or I wouldn’t get going again. I knew she was right so I did. Glueber and Almost were at the shelter when we left and they were going to stay the night there. I am glad I pushed on but staying would have been cool. I later learned that the sunrise from Blue Mountain shelter is breath taking. Another time I guess.
From there it was up and over two mountains and then down an incredibly rocky, that was very technical, into Unicoi Gap. I actually loved it because I could step from rock to rock and not really have to bend my knees.

>span class=""s1"">Oh coming over the first mountain that morning I noticed a mountain in front of us that has a tower on top of it. I then noticed it again from Blue Mountain Shelter to the west. And then as I climbed out of Unicoi Gap it was behind me. I don’t know what it was or what it’s used for but I want to find out.
I caught up with Erin about one mile from our campsite for the night and got to connect with her. Finally made it to Cheese Factory for the night around 4:30ish. I felt good all afternoon my knees were giving me hardly any trouble at all. I took my shoes off to discover blisters on my feet. I will put some tape over them before I head out in the morning. I was so tired that I didn’t put my tent up. I just started eating. The hiker hunger is beginning to catch up with me.
While I sat around the fire with people I got my Trail Name. Skip said she had been thinking about it. Would I like “gamer” because I started the game on the second night, or “Tag” or “Mash” because both of those are camp games. I laughed and said I wasn’t a fan of gamer. So she asked what my favorite camp games were. Since I used to work at one I had to have one. I really didn’t want to share at that point but that just made the whole group push me to share. My favorite game that we did at VJ is “Ride My Pony, My Fat Little Pony”. The group erupted with laughter and had to know how it went. So I shared. They all agreed that it sounded fun for a camp game. So the name then was given “Fat Pony”. I had a chance to say no. As everyone gets a choice and chance to get out of something if they don’t like it. Which I love about the culture of the hikers. But I knew there was no way I was going to live it down and what a great Trail Name. So my name is now Fat Pony.
I was just going to sleep under the stars since it wont be raining tonight and there hasn’t been hardly any dew in the mornings. But I eventually did put my fast fly up over the poles of my tent. They aren’t designed to work that way but I made it work. That’s right it only took my 6 days to decide that a tent might not be worth it. At this rate I will just have a tarp over me in my sleeping bag in a matter of a few weeks.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648337,"It’s been a hard but good day today. I slept. Really well with just my fast fly over my tent poles. I’m doing it again tonight. I was concerned about a mouse crawling over me and I think one did at one point but it’s just a mouse.
My knees and ankles were killing me this morning. And I discovered that I had blisters on my feet last night so I planned to take it slow. When I was about to push out I discovered that my InReach tracker was dead. I thought it had 25% last night so I guess I forgot it on or something. When I reached the top of one mountain I had enough signal to call my mom and tell here that they would be able to track me throughout today and tomorrow. After talking to my mom, I started thinking about how the wrong shoes can mess up your ankles and knees because it’s forcing you to walk differently. So I called my mom back and we talked about it. The plan is for me to get new shoes while I am in town tomorrow or the next day. There is an outfitter in Hiawassee.
I have booked my first Hostel stay and I am going to take my first zero day. I am going to be staying at the Hostel Around the Bend. They are right by the trail head in Dick’s Creek. I’m glad I booked this a few days ago. Because they are completely full now and other hikers I’ve been hanging with are having to book hotel rooms in Hiawassee. I got a twin bed in a room with four beds and a shared bathroom. So I don’t know who I will be sharing a room with yet but they will likely be other thru hikers who planned ahead. I can’t check in until 3:00pm and it’s going to start storming around noon tomorrow. So I need to get into town. I missed out on people going in on getting a shuttle into town. So I guess I will also have my first experience at hitch hiking into town. There are several older hikers here around the shelter tonight who will be going into town as well. So I feel like I won’t get kidnapped if I’m with them.
I’m staying the night at Deep Gap shelter. I am about 4 miles from Dicks Creek Gap where I can get a ride into town.
After sleeping on it and considering it today. I don’t think I am settled with the trail name Fat Pony. I had to explain it a few times today. It’s fun to tell people of camp but it’s a long way to explaining a name. There is a guy here named Cowboy. He has a cowboy hat, cowboy boots (which I haven’t seen him wear yet), he wears either American flag running shorts or a blue plaid kilt. He also has his Great Pyrenees dog named trooper with him. His friend who is doing the trail as well is named Angel. They are pretty cool.

>span class=""s1"">With going into town tomorrow there has been a lot of talk about food and what we are looking forward to eat. There is an all you can eat buffet that I think a lot of people are going to. I am so hungry. I have food to eat but it just felt odd to keep boiling water to eat. This is only the beginning of hiker hungry and it’s not going to be fun.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648578,"Today was a short day of hiking. I woke up and got moving with everyone down to the road trying to beat the weather. It was going to start raining at 10am. As I was coming out of the woods and crossing the road with everyone Gordon, on of the owners of the Hostel Around The Bend, was pulling up in his Jeep Gladiator. As I walked up, he called out asking if anyone was going to the hostel. So I raised my hand along with two others and he said jump in. He took us the 0.6 miles to the hostel. We had only been inside for about 10 mins when it started raining hard.

>span class=""s1"">After a shower, which unfortunately was cold but I will live, and getting my laundry going, I unpacked my bag and rested. Then at 2:30 I rode into town to get an amazing burger at a brewery. Then walked down to Ingles (a whole 0.8 miles with no bag. I was in heaven.) to get some Starbucks and a few groceries. Then it was a shuttle back to the hostel from Gordon at 5:15ish. I sprung for a twin bed in a room with four beds. They have a bunk room with bunk beds. As well as private rooms. After being on the trail this is enough privacy for me.
Tomorrow I plan on going into town to get new shoes and resupply food for my bag. It will be nice to take a day and not have to walk anywhere. I’ll also have WiFi to call people and catch up. 
At the brewery, just before we ordered, Mamaw called me so I answered. She was so shocked that I did. She asked if I had quit yet, I said no. She then asked if I would tomorrow, I said no. Then she asked if I’d come home, I said I couldn’t do that yet. She got mad at me. I know it’s just the way she is showing she cares about me. I love her so much.
Now that burger I had. It was the most life giving food I have ever eaten. It had the crispiest bacon on it. It was cool to medium rare. It was just incredible.
Well I’m going to watch a little tv and pass out.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648579,Today was my first zero day. I stayed at the hostel and rested pretty much all day. I slept in until 9:30. I made coffee and cinnamon rolls. Just chilled and listened to music. I took the shuttle into town and bought new shoes. I went with Altra Lone Peaks 5. They feel so nice on my feet. I think these will really help. I also picked up some Injinji toe socks. They are supposed to help with not getting blisters. I will try them out tomorrow. I then calculated the shipping for sending my other shoes home along with a few things I don’t need. I’m looking forward to getting back on the trail. I spent the day talking to my parents and a few others. It was really good for my morale. I also got a nice hot shower today. I loved it. I got to meet a lot of people today.,"

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648580,"Today has been good. I slept really well at the hostel. There was a thunder crack that shook the house and woke me up. I was so thankful to not be out in it.
I met some people last night who came in just for the night. They were heading out this morning and I happened to catch a ride with them up to the trail head. I stayed with them all day. They all stayed together in single file on the trail. They called it the Pain Train. So I got to take part in that today. Their names are: Shelby (the conductor. She is very type A), Matt (he is from the UK), Austen, Tyler, and Tim. Around lunch we caught up with someone they called “Mountain Doctor”. I haven’t learned his real name.
We crossed into NC today! It is so exciting to be back in my home state. I told the group I was with that NC has some hard and Rocky Mountains. As soon as we crossed the state line we had a mile long climb up the rockiest slope that we have seen in a while. We got to the top of the mountain and took a breather. Matt turned to me and said “man, your (explicative) state doesn’t mess around.” Hahaha I told him no we don’t. 

>span class=""s1"">I can’t fully explain it but since crossing into NC I have felt more at peace. Some of it is likely that I have come so far and I have done a few resupplies. Some of it is having people around me I know a little bit now. And some of it has to be that I’m in my home state. I may not have ever been here, this area, but i know this state, I have explored the NC mountains my whole life. Whatever leads to it all. It’s nice to be breathing a little easier.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648581,I have come a long way today. It was freezing cold when I woke up to people already up and ready. I debated staying in my bag for an hour or so more but I knew rain was coming. Most evenings while we are sitting around a fire someone has enough service to pull up the weather forecast so that we at least have a general idea for the next day. So I dragged myself out of my warm sleeping bag and started packing up. I was out of camp by 8am. I passed a few people I knew throughout the morning. other than that I was by myself. I had my rain pants on for the weather later and it was nice to have that extra layer as it was so cold and windy. Going up Standing Indian Mountain I caught up with the guys of the group I had hiked with yesterday. So we summited it together and the rain clouds were bearing down on us. So we put our rain gear on and pressed on along the ridge. So sooner had we taken off it started to snow. Snowing! In April! It was better than having cold rain and it soaking into us. So we kept moving. It was really cool to be on top of a mountain as it snowed. Except we could really see anything as for views. I fell behind the group because I was taking pictures. I finally rolled into Carter Gap where we planned to stay for the night around 2ish. I had come 12.5 miles in 6 hours. I am impressed. I had enough signal to call my parents and get a little weather forecast from them. We are getting more snow now. I will take some more pictures.,"
",View Entry,"Apr 08, Fri",12.50
Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648893,"What a day it has been. It snowed on us all night long. I woke up to my tent weighed down under two inches of snow. It was still below freezing. Like well below. So I had no trouble packing my stuff up without getting wet.
We had been warned by a Ridgerunner that a momma bear and her cub had been seen in the area the night before. I woke up around midnight and I thought I heard something big outside near the area some people had hung their food bags. I have the bear vault and since it was so cold I had to just sleep with it in my tent. It wasn’t long and the heavy thing was moving beside my tent. I couldn’t catch a clear distinct sound to confirm it was a bear and with the snow continuing to come down there were no prints to see in the morning. I’m talking with some people in my group there were a few of us who were awake around that time hearing something move around.
I had some beautiful views in the mid morning while I was walking along the ridge of a mountain. For the most of the day it continued to snow. It was so cold. Except for extra socks I had every bit of clothing I had with me on.
I kept a really good pace throughout the day. The crew I’m with made a plan to get a shuttle from Rock Gap into Franklin, NC to get a motel room for the night. It’s supposed to dip into the low 20’s tonight. With being cold and slightly damp we needed to get out of the woods. Looking around the Sapphire Inn there are a lot of other hikers who had the same idea.
Around noon I caught up with Prosecco and Moon. We did the rock scramble up Albert Mountain together. And I mean a rock scramble. I’ve rock climbed sections less as steep as this. And that time I had a rope and harness on. This time there was no safety system. If it had been good weather it would have been difficult but manageable. With the snow and the freezing temps and the wet rocks. It was difficult to say the list. At the top of Albert there is a watch tower and that is where I crossed the 100 mile mark on the trail. Wohooo!!! It’s hard to believe I am 1/22 of the way done. It’s going by so fast. I’m still so excited!
I spent the two hours after that coming down the mountain and over a few more with Prosecco. She is really cool. This was the first time we had time to really talk about life. Her name is Stephanie. She is 38. From FL but has lived a little of everywhere. She played soccer in college so we spent time talking about the games we have played. In the things we talked about I kept thinking that we had a strange connection on things. Like we thought similar on something that came up. Turns out she is a Christian. So there is the connection I was sensing but couldn’t put my finger on. Without over sharing her story she had life fall apart last year and is seeking a new adventure to change things up. So that makes a few of us in this group I have found myself in that are seeking a change to shake up somethings in their life. Oh and I’m actually the middle of the group as for age.
Our shuttle showed up to pick up 6 of us in a 5 seat CRV. You can see the issue. But then we had two guys who were trying to get a ride as well. I still can’t believe it but we put 8 people plus the driver into that CRV along with all of our packs. It was a tight fit. I had Prosecco on one knee and my bag on my other knee. It was just crazy how many you can fit in a car when it’s freezing cold and snowing outside.
We are staying at the Sapphire Inn in Franklin tonight. It will be nice to dry out and be warm tonight. We are going to get some Mexican for first dinner here at 4pm and then maybe burgers at a brewery later tonight for second dinner. It’s been fun to pretend that we are all hobbits because we like to eat all the time now.
There has been a big discussion to give me a trail name. So far Fat Pony (which I nixed), precious (because of the lotr and I’m just so precious.), and woody (because I like to wood carve). Oh and Canary (because I whistle all the time.). None of them are really sticking to me well. So we will just have to wait and see.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648894,"We took a short day today. We slept in which felt so nice in the warm bed rather than out in the 20 degree snow and ice. It’s supposed to get to 70 today so that’s exciting. We did a resupply at Dollar General. Packed our bags and then checked out around 10:30am. We walked a half mile up the road to a diner for breakfast. It was so amazing! I had a fully spread of biscuits and gravy, grits, eggs, and bacon. And endless cups of coffee. It was just what I needed. I have been in a great mood all day. A gentleman named Dave picked up the tab for all 6 of us. He was really nice. We then walked about a mile into downtown to Outdoor 76, they are an outfitter here. They had so much gear and knowledge to share. They had a hiker lounge with a ping pong table. I picked up a trowel since the privy’s will be getting scarcer from here on out. Another gentleman named Bill talked to us at the diner and offered to drive us out to the trail in his truck when we were ready. So we called him from the outfitter around 12:30. While we waited for him I called Poppop to wish him a happy birthday. He is 79. I also got to talk to nana and Emma. I told them about waking up in the snow and making the decision to get off trail for the night. It’s still crazy to think that we woke up to 2 inches of snow on Saturday, we walked 12.5 miles with it still snowing, and then waking up to sun and it hitting 70 today.
We put all 6 of us in the back of Bill’s truck and 2 others in the front with him. He is really cool. We talked to him for a little while at the trail head. He is a Vietnam Veteran. He worked on film crews in Miami for 40 years. He claims he worked on the original Miami Vice, Burn Notice, the first couple of Fast and Furious, and worked for Carnival on their ships tv networks. I hate we didn’t have time to stick around and talk to him.
We only walked 4.5 miles up and over to a campsite for the night. So it’s been a chill day. The whole way over the last mountain I have been pushing things and moving faster. My knees and Achilles’ tendons are feeling so much better with these new shoes. I was whistling and singing and talking up a storm with the others. They are all a little tired today. We came across Moore Creek waterfall and I climbed down to stick my head in it. I slipped a little and my shoe got soaked. So I just stuck my whole upper body in. I finished out today with wet shoes and no shirt. It was great!
Sitting around the fire Emily (Spicy Onion) was coming up with the plan for how many miles and when we would get to places to resupply ahead. It was originally her idea to book the motel and get out of the snow last night. So there were jokes about her being the “fearless leader” of the group. It’s nice to have someone who is looking ahead and planning things. Or to make little decisions like when we were going to dinner in town. But I can’t help but think that sticking with this group for the whole trail would slow me down. I like the group we all get along and inside jokes are developing. It would be a blast to stick right with them but I don’t want to get so sucked in in that I can’t make the personal decision to push on when they don’t want to. Like today when I was in a good mood and feeling strong I could have push on and made it several more miles before sundown. But we had a plan to stop and we were all so close together it would have been hard to push past them. At the same time I don’t see them really picking up the mileage per day in the future. I think they would ride the 12 miles a day for the whole trail. I started a conversation about being excited to push it and got the group to agree to push for 15 miles tomorrow. So I’m pumped to push myself that far and to see how that goes over with the others. It may be that I push past them further up the trail. Right now there is a system to getting to the next resupply points and the getting through the Smokies. I am reminding myself that we are all individuals out here. Who independently decided to hike the AT. We owe no allegiance to each other. I think if I decided that I was going to push myself further than others it would be accepted. There would be jokes about me leaving the group but I think it would be okay.
Well it’s 8pm and everyone has turned in for the night. I’m far too awake to go to sleep. Some hiker just went by us. Still moving in the last rays of day light. Well I’m settled in for the night. So I’ll relax and listen to some music.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648895,"Wow what a day! I came 15 miles today. I started out at 7:40am. That’s the earliest I have pushed out of camp so far. It felt good to grab some nut and fruit bars and pack up. I didn’t bother messing with a hot breakfast today. It was a climb today. I think I gained and lost over 4000 feet in elevation throughout the day. On the climb up Wayah Knob there was a really cool section of trail that I would love to come hike again. Without a 30 lbs pack it would still be a challenging climb but so worth the views at the top. It hailed on me on my way Wayah Knob. At first it was just so crazy. But then it picked up. I ended up hiding behind a tree because it was coming down to hard. It was just the size of BB’s but it hurt. It didn’t last long and then I could move on. There is an old fire watch tower built out of stone on top of it. Just incredible views all the way around. There is also a road that drives to the top so the easy way up might be worth it too. I took lunch next to the tower with Moon, Skip and Stork. It was a good time. I then made a quick phone call to my dad to say hi and catch him up on my plans. I am about 10 miles out from being at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). The group in with is planning to stay at the shelter that’s just outside of the NOC. I might push on in. The NOC has a bunk house and is charging $25 for a bed and a shower. Sounds like a great deal from what I have seen. So maybe I can get a bed. They fill up quickly so I might not.
I am at Cold Spring Shelter. Prosecco was the first here from our group and claimed the shelter for who would fit. You could get 7 people in the shelter if we all squeezed. Money Stash and Nugs were here already and took two spots. So Onions and Candyman are tenting just up the hill.
Well after all the talk about giving me a trail name I think the group has decided. After coming up with Precious yesterday. Yes, Precious. From like the Lord of the Rings. I’m listening to the audio books on my phone occasionally. So I end up bring it up. Which is cool. I really love the books and films. Well yesterday I also had a ton of energy. I was just moving really fast and I had songs to sing. If I wasn’t singing I was whistling. I had a great day yesterday. Well that got the group thinking about the energizer bunny. So I have been named Precious Bunny. Or Precious for short. It’s a lot better from Fat Pony or anything else people have tried so far. So I will try it out tomorrow and see what I think.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648896,"It’s been a good day. Some incredible views. I slept well enough in the shelter last night. Money Stash snores pretty bad. And like I thought every time one person rolls over we all hear it and roll over.
I climbed to the top of Wesser Bald and then up the tower on top of it! Wow what views! There was a full 360 degrees view of the surrounding mountains. I was thankful the fog that had been hovering around all morning finally cleared by that time and I was able to see.

>span class=""s1"">We are camped just one mile from the NOC. I thought about pushing on in but it started to rain so I put my tent up. If the decent continues as it has been going. In the rain that would be asking for a mistake and injury.
After feeling the name out and calling my parents I have decided I don’t really care for the trail name of Precious Bunny. As funny as it is. I’m just not feeling it. I told the few from this group who are in camp already and they seemed to accept it. I need to not be in a rush to get a name. Something will come or happen and I will earn a name in time.
I covered the nearly 11 miles in 6 hours today. I’m feeling good even after the 15 miles yesterday. If there wasn’t a just insane climb to get out from the NOC I might have pushed on regardless of the rain. It was plenty warm and I was sweaty. I’m looking forward to upping the miles.

>span class=""s1"">Tomorrow the plan is to sleep in and wander the one mile into the NOC for the restaurant to open at 11am. I wonder how late I will actually sleep.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648897,"It’s been a great day. I slept in until 8am. The group took our time getting packed up and ready to go. We then wondered the one mile into the Nantahala Outdoor Center. I got some food and purchased my Smoky Mountains thru hiker permit, which the NOC prints free of charge for thru hikers. We were waiting for the restaurant to open at 11am. While waiting so many people that I have met over the first two weeks of this adventure came into the NOC. Almost and Gluebert, who I thought were a day or so ahead of me came in. It was cool to see them. I told them I was a hugger and they accepted hugs. I haven’t seen them in a week, I think. The interaction has had me thinking about how quickly people can get attached to others. It makes me think of my time at camp. Counselors would build such incredible connections in the matter of days. In camp we kinda forced them to by designing training to push people toward each other. But it was always a small groups that you would never have guessed that connected. Out here though it’s all organic. People are just looking to make connections. I spend a decent portion of my day alone. I can find people if I want and I generally know who is behind me and in front of me. How far they are is a different story. Everyone has a different speed they want to move at and what views they want to stop and spend time looking at. So we all walk the same trail but we each have a different experience. That makes me think of a book I have read titled Deep Nature Play. It’s about how we can deeper connect to others and nature through taking the time to walk in the woods. It expands on a lot and goes into Flow Theory. It’s really cool to be able to continue to think through and build on my knowledge of people and how we connect as people.
While at the NOC I got to FaceTime with my mom and see Will and Marissa’s kids doing an egg hunt. It was nice to catch up with her and say hello to the kiddos. I also talked to my dad for a few minutes right before I started hiking again. There is a train that comes right by the NOC and stops to let the riders get off and see and buy things at the NOC. So when we left we had to walk all the way down and around the train rather than just getting to cross the tracks. Which was annoying but only a minor inconvenience.
Anyways, I had a local caught trout patty on a bun to eat. It was so good! We then headed out and up. The climb out of the NOC was extreme. The incline stayed between a 45 to 60 degree most of the time for 7 miles or so. Other times it either flattened out at a false summit or it went to a rock scramble to get up and over. It was a really challenge and while it exhausted me it was so amazing at the same time.
On the way up I came across a level space just under a ridge. In the side of the ridge these huge rock face was jutting out. There was a guy sitting next to the trail sipping water. He told me there was a water source just down from the trail. I had plenty so I was just going to pass by but then he said “doesn’t it look like there is a troll hole up there in those rocks?” I had to admit that I was just thinking the same thing. Like something out of the Lord of the Rings. He agreed and we ended up standing there talking about the LOTR for 10 minutes. Turns out he is a huge fan as well. He then introduced himself as “Chief”. He got his name because he was the assistant chief at his fire department and he rides an Indian Motor cycle. He asked for my name and I didn’t know what to tell him. So I told him the whole story of Fat Pony and Precious Bunny, to the newest thing of Canary which started because I whistle. He just laughed and said none of those fit me. He said that because of my knowledge of LOTR I should get a character out of the books. He thought about it a second and said that I looked like Faramir. He is the younger brother to Boromir. Faramir is the one who was able to resist the draw of the ring. I told him that and he said that it was a very key difference. I like the name a lot. I think it’s really cool. I thanked him for it. We spoke for a little while longer before I said I would see him up at the shelter.
The shelter is packed tonight and there are tents set up everywhere. I got here in time to claim a spot in the shelter if I wanted it but with it sleeping 14 I didn’t want to take the chance with people who snore. So I found a somewhat flat spot and set my tent up. It’s been a chill evening. I got to make a short phone call out to Will and catch up with him. I tried a mushroom risotto dinner tonight. It tasted fine but it’s not sitting well. I’m hoping I make it through the night without having to get up and go to the privy. The wind is really blowing hard tonight. So going to the privy would not be fun.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648898,"It’s been a great day. A lot of ups and downs. Some of the climbs were just brutal. And then the downs were a killer on the knees. And it has been so worth it to do another 15 miler day. 
It rained in the early hours of today. I stayed dry but I still didn’t sleep well. There were no level spots for tents last night so I was constantly sliding down and sideways off my air mat. I was successful at peeing from my tent because I refused to get up in the rain at 4am. Which was a challenge but I made it work. After that I realized I could use my pack to stuff under the lower half of my air mat and then it created a little cocoon that held me in place. I will keep that in the back of my mind for later.

>span class=""s1"">Around noon I topped out on a mountain that was covered in small trees and rocks that jutted straight up out of the ground. The top of the mountain was maybe 10 feet wide and nearly 30 feet long. I had to climb over the rocks and wind my way through the trees. It was just so cool to finally find a rock tall enough to scramble on top and see above the short trees and get a view. The peak was maybe 4000 feet. It was just such a great view. The down after that I thought I was going to fall so many times. The rocks continued to jut out in the way. There was a section of the trail that you balanced in between these big rocks and prayed you didn’t slip because there was no where to go if you did except forward down the mountain. Some how the danger makes the climbs and descents so much more worth it. Over the past couple of days I have literally gone up and over mountain edges that I could have died from if I had fallen. I have balanced on rocks that shook when I stepped on them and threatened to send me head first down a rock field. I have no doubt that the people praying for me are protecting me. The danger also pushes me into my state of Flow. Flow theory is when the skill you have and the risk an activity poses meet along the 45 on an X Y graph. If the skill you have is so much more than the risk then you can be bored. If the opposite is true then you run the risk of seriously hurting yourself. But when they meet you have the skill to do exactly what is required to succeed. When this happens you can enter a state of “Flow” where time seems to pass both slow and fast. It’s an incredible feeling. There is nothing like it. You can hit Flow doing almost anything. So finding it while hiking has been so amazing.
I made it to Cable Gap Shelter just before 3pm. So I covered the the 15.4 miles in 7 hours. I was moving good today. I considered going the next 5 miles on to Fontana Dam. But after I went to the bathroom and ate a snack I knew I wasn’t going further. I could have made it though. So I am feeling really good. I am considering attempting the Smokies challenge. Which is to cover the 75 miles of the Smokies in 4 days. So that will be 20ish miles day. I may not. But I could. It’s just a thought but would be cool to say I did it. I’m not going to stress about it. I will do what my body feels like doing at the time.
It’s only my crew staying in the shelter tonight. There are apparently an infestation of mice in this shelter. They don’t bother me. So bring it on. Here is to hoping I don’t wake up to a mouse on my face.
While I am laying down writing this journal entry a man known as the Mailman showed up with a cooler pack full of beer, some fruit, and some salami and cheese. It was a real treat for Trail Magic.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649515,"I slept alright in the cable gap shelter. The floor was bowed upward in the middle. I was on the far left (inside looking out) so I spent the whole night sliding into the log wall. The logs were so cold and I could feel it through my sleeping bag. Thankfully it did get very cold. The guides said that there was a huge mice infestation at the shelter but I didn’t hear one all night. The crew slept in and took out time getting up and out because we only had 5 miles to go to come down into Fontana Dam and we couldn’t check in until 3pm.
When I was about to leave I noticed that a small trash bag had been left at the shelter. The guy who brought the Trail Magic the night before was supposed to carry it out but he had left already. So I tied it up and attached it to the back of my pack. I was next to last to leave the shelter but I passed everyone in the crew fairly quickly. It was a beautiful decent down into Fontana Dam. I could see parts of the lake and the dam throughout the morning.
When I made it down to the Fontana Marina I dropped my pack and headed off to to the floating marina. I was able to buy a hot pocket and a soda. It was so good! Just what I needed.
We hopped into a shuttle up to the Fontana Village Resort where we had rooms for the next two nights. We couldn’t check in yet but we dried out by the giant fireplace and rested on the couches. Others in the crew were going to eat at the grill on the resort at 12:30pm. But I had a visit from Daniel. He was at a work conference in TN and was diverting to come by and see me. I didn’t have cell service so I couldn’t call him. But through my parents I was able to communicate where I was to him. It was so good to see him. We caught up on things. I told him about the trail and we went to the grill for burgers. Mine tasted so amazing!! Dan treated me to the burger. Thanks Dan! I was able to send some unneeded items home with Daniel. So that saved me the shipping to get rid of them.
I am looking forward to taking a zero mileage day tomorrow. It will be good to rest before going through the Smokies. While waiting for Daniel I found several hikers around whom I had met previously. Uncle Paul is here. I met him at Hostel Around the Bend.  He is really nice. It was cool to catch up with him. He has hurt his ankle pretty bad. So his wife is coming tomorrow to pick him up and take him to have it looked at.
After Daniel left I got into our room and took a long hot shower. It felt so nice. Candy man and I got laundry done and then the crew had pizza at the grill. I ran into Tim sitting outside. He was apart of the Pain Train group that I rolled out of the Hostel Around The Bend from. The group broke up is what he tells me. Shelby (the conductor) pushed on without really stopping here at Fontana. Tim’s legs have been giving him some issues so he stayed for a couple of zero’s. The other guys pushed on today. Later in the evening several hikers ended up in the game lounge playing ping pong, pool, air hokey, etc. it was a lot of fun to hang out in a “normal” way with these new found friends.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649516,"I slept in until almost 8am. Went to breakfast. It isn’t included in the room rental but it was buffet. So I had 3 biscuits with gravy, 1/2 pound of bacon, an orange, orange juice, coffee, and some frosted mini wheats. I knew I could have eaten more but I told myself I had all day.
Other hikers that I knew started showing up around 10am. Gluepert and Almost arrived. Chief showed up a little later. It was cool to see them.
I have been considering the Smokies. Most people take around 6 or 7 days to go through them. The crew I’m hanging with are planning to do it in 5 or 6. I have been intrigued by the idea since I first learned about it. It’s called the Smokies Challenge. You cross the 75 miles of the Smokies in 4 days. It’s a hard challenge considering the elevation gained and lost. As well as going over Clingman’s Dome, the highest peak on the AT. I’m considering attempting it. I don’t want to hurt myself by and I don’t really want to do it on my own. I mentioned it around to see if anyone else wanted to attempt it with me but I didn’t get any takers. I met a guy named Dubz who was interested but he really wants to take pictures from the peaks. He had a nice DSLR. So I told him that he should take his time and enjoy the views.
I was talking to Uncle Paul this morning about how we have each had a couple of zero days and we don’t know if we like it. To rest is nice but we have gotten our bodies used to moving everyday and to just sit around all day gets boring. I called my parents and discussed the idea of the Smokies challenge. I played disc golf with Stork, Gluepert and Almost. It was a lot of fun. The course here on the resort was good! 

>span class=""s1"">The plan for tomorrow is to get a shuttle at 7:30 back to the Marina and hit the trail. This will be the first time I break my rule of not setting alarms on this adventure. I don’t want to but if I am going to push for the big miles then I want an early start.","

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649517,"It’s been a long hard climb up out of Fontana Dam today. But it’s been so worth it. The crew had a shuttle for 7:30am. I set an alarm for 6:45am to make sure I was up in time to get a quick breakfast which opened at 7am. I didn’t like setting the alarm as I have the idea of not setting one for the whole adventure. I woke up before the alarm at 6:30am. So I got up and turned the alarm off. So I’m still going with no alarms.It’s Easter Sunday. So I am missing the sunrise service at church with my family. I did find some service on the climb up to call and talk to my parents. My mom handed the phone over to Kurt. It was nice to talk and catch up with him. He and Alex are having the trees cleared on their land this upcoming week. So he was excited for it. He thinks they will have the basement set by the time I get back.With pushing into the Smokies today I decided I would push as far as I thought I could safely do. If I could make it through the Smokies in 4 days cool if it took longer than it takes longer. I don’t want to be in a rush but I do want to start putting in more miles.The start of where we were took us just a mile to the Fontana Hilton Shelter. It’s called the Hilton because it has power, clean water and showers all right there. It looked really cool with it being set right next to the lake. We then Road walked down and across the top of the dam. With no traffic allowed on the dam and no one else around it was just the crew walking across the dam. I made it to an old fire watch tower. I climbed to the top. There were only hand rails along the steep stairs. Other than that it was just open on the tower until I got into the little room at the top. The views from the top were amazing! I could see all the way back to the dam which was really cool! I finally got to talk to the family that is they-hiking. There are 5 of them. Parents and 3 kids. Names are Leah, Josh, with children Japheth, Lola, and I’m sorry to say I don’t remember the youngest boys name. They homeschool their kids and thought this would a grand adventure. I told them I was homeschooled and loved it. It was cool to meet them.I made it to Mollies Ridge Shelter around 2ish. Which was great for timing considering the amount of elevation I gained today. There was only a couple who had just hiked in from a side trail for the weekend. So I sat and talked to them as people rolled in. I knew I wanted to push on so I didn’t unpack. As Phoenix and Prosecco arrived I asked if they wanted to push on to the next shelter which was only 3.1 miles further. They didn’t want to but I put my pack on and made it up to Russell Field Shelter. Before I left I met Tacocat. I’ve seen him before but I hadn’t ever met him. He seems cool. It’s a really nice shelter. There are two levels for sleeping and huge area that is covered. I’m here with 9 other people. So it’s a smaller group. I met a guy going by Gandalf. He is really cool. He did a thru-hike back in 2014. So he is telling us all these stories and what’s to come. He says he pushed himself last time this time he is just enjoying the ride and not making a fuss over things. He is still putting in some good miles. He is maybe in his mid 60’s.I talked about plans with a few others and it seems that we have a similar game plan for getting through the Smokies. So I will be seeing them. I have seen them around in the hiker bubble but never introduced myself. The people here at the shelter are Matt, Rocket, Tacocat, Mountain Doc., Aga (I met her at the Hostel Around the Bend. She is from Poland), Gandalf, and three other guys whom I didn’t catch their names. Two of them are thru-hikers. The other guy is just sectioning through the Smokies sobo. Rocket asked if I wanted to wake up early in two days and summit Clingmans Dome for sunrise. I think that sounds incredible. So I might do it even though I don’t want to set an alarm. It’s been nice to be away from the crew I have been hiking with. I loved my time with them. I’m sure I will see them further up the trail.","Fontana Dam Resort

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649518,"What a day. It poured down rain by the bucketful last night. I was so glad to be in the shelter and that it wasn’t leaking on me. When I did wake up in the morning it was so foggy I couldn’t see more than 30 feet out of the shelter. I really didn’t want to get up but new I needed to. It was cold and still rainy. But I made it up and on the trail. The trail was just soup the whole day. I mean 6 inches of the squishiest cold mud. My shoes and feet were soaked in no time. I gave it my best shot to stay out of the mud but eventually I hit a point that it just didn’t matter. The worst part about it was I never knew if I was going to slide forwards, backwards or just sink into the mud. Just crazy to be on the trail. I warmed up well enough in my Frogg Toggs. But I still got soaked. The Frogg Toggs are not waterproof as they advertise. If I needed more of a reason to know I should never buy something cheap and from Walmart. The pants had started to rip when I last wore them but then today I slipped and tore them from front to back and then out along my right side. The pants did their job though and kept the mud off of my legs. I only fell one time. I slipped and took a tumble off into the wet grass. I rolled into it and was perfectly fine. Just a little wetter if possible.I made it to Derrick Knob Shelter around noonish and found some people I knew. They were headed to Double Spring Gap Shelter. Which was further than I had planned but I was feeling good. So I pushed along with them. But when we made it to Silers Bald Shelter I knew I was done. It is only 1.7 miles further. But I had sat down and taken my pack off. I just couldn’t push myself. I was so cold and wet to move on. A change of clothes and drying off made a real difference in my mood. Then food and a fire helped it even more.The only true downer for the day is that while drying my shoes out by the fire they got a little to close and melted a little bit of my left shoe. It’s not too bad. I think I’ll be okay in them. But it still frustrating to have only caught these a little over a week ago. Crazy to think I’ve come over 100 miles in them so far.With thinking about how far I have come with including the Approach Trail to Springer Mountain I crossed my 200th mile today. The official 200th will be tomorrow at Clingmans Dome. Which is also the highest peak on the AT. It will be great to get up and over that. The joke is that after Clingmans it’s all down hill from there. It’s a bad joke considering we have hardly began to scratch the total amount of elevation gain we will see on the AT. There are a few people here at this shelter who say they want to get up at 4am and get to the top of Clingmans for the sunrise tomorrow. It will be beautiful if this rain will move out. Which it should. But it’s also going to drop to 27 degrees tonight. So I’m sleeping with my water filter and electronics to make sure they don’t freeze.Well I do have an alarm set for 4am tomorrow. The hope will be to make the climb up the mountain in the dark and the cold to see the sunrise. I may hear the alarm and decide to just roll over but it would be really cool to make it there. I know this goes against my rule of not setting alarms but it’s such a chance to see something incredible.","Russell Field Shelter

So I was going to lay back down but I saw Tacocat begin to move. I think he had a similar thought. Was it really worth getting up at 4am to hike in 27 degrees? We both were the push the other needed to do it. So I got up and hiked 5 miles in the dark. When I got to Clingmans Dome it was so cold I made oatmeal and coffee on my stove. The coffee froze solid before I could drink it all. I pulled my sleeping at out and wrapped up in it waiting for the sunrise. It never came. The clouds were so thick and it was snowing lightly. I know I have been colder but I really can’t remember when. There were 12 hikers up there for the sunrise we were all so disappointed. I then was ready to leave I was going to a trail when some others said it was the wrong way. So I listened and them and walked the half mile down to the Visitor Center. I was pissed when I got to the map and saw I was right about where the trail was. Which was back at the top of the mountain. Rocket had walked down with me and she wasn’t happy either. We did get to dump our trash though. There was ice from water that had been running across the road and I took a fall on one of them. I mean full on both legs straight out on my back style fall. I had the prescience of mind to not stick my arms back to catch myself. Instead I landed on my pack and mostly on my sleeping bag so I didn’t get hurt at all. Rocket laughed so hard and was sad she had missed it. So we made it back up the mountain and found the right trail.The crew that had made it to the top of Clingmans made it down safely and then tried to find a shuttle to take us into Gatlinburg. We couldn’t get one but when we got to Newfound Gap we found Trail Magic from a church group. It was so nice to have a soda and a honey bun. They were closing up about an hour after we got there, about 12:30pm. So they gave us a free ride into town. Rocket and I wanted to get back to the trail while the rest wanted to stay the night. So it was a risk but after the day walking in the rain and getting soaked and then a day of freezing temps I needed a hot meal. We ate at Mellow Mushroom and then I got a coffee at a Starbucks. I even had some pizza that I packed out for dinner. With hitchhiking it is true that people will pick up girls before they will pick up guys. So Rocket told me to go hide by the Great Smoky Mnts. sign. So I did and talked to a couple of families trying to get a ride. The strategy worked and it wasn’t 20 mins and she had us a ride. It was from a guy who lives in the area and hiked half the trail back in 2018. I was planning to attempt the Smokies challenge but with the double whammy of pouring rain for a night and a day and then freezing temps for most of today. I just couldn’t push the miles required to do it. I do want to come back and do it some day.Arriving at the shelter there were tents everywhere so I planned on trading my pizza for a place in the shelter. But there was actually space for me, Rocket and Nate (who had slept in and just got to Newfound Gap when we got there). It was an easy hike up to just talk and hike. The view from my spot is really good. It’s nice to have some views today since I didn’t get them at Clingmans.I text in to the trail family I was with and they are just one shelter back. So I haven’t pushed that far front them. Part of me feels bad for having left them and part of me is glad to have found some freedom that I had felt taken when you do join a group. They are good people and I hope to see them further up the trail.Kara is here at the shelter. I met her back when I came up out of the NOC. She works for the federal government doing humanitarian aid. So if the gov. sends aid she is one of the ones who goes. She is really cool. She has a very unique laugh. Something was said and I had a joke in response. She started laughing so hard and then I started laughing because of her laugh. And we just went back and forth so much. It was really cool. I met Homemade and Fox tonight. They spent the night in Gatlinburg last night. They seem really cool.It’s going to be below freezing again tonight so I’m sleeping with my water filter and electronics again. Thankfully I don’t have a specific time I have to get up. I can sleep in.","Silers Bald Shelter

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649520,It’s been a long day. I slept in and didn’t get up until 8:30. Which was great but it just made me feel like I was behind so many people. In reality I wasn’t that far behind the few who had pushed on ahead of me. I think everyone was moving slow since it got below freezing again last night. It was so cold. I should know because the pizza I had yesterday decided to come back up. I felt it coming and was able to get out of my sleeping bag and away from the shelter toward the privy before it started dining up. After throwing up though I felt great and slept really well.I spent some of the morning and lunch walking with Kara. She is really fun to talk to. She has had an interesting life with traveling all over the world to provide aid. She just got a new job where she can pick and choose her assignments so she is using her savings to be able to do her thru-hike of the AT. Other than that we swapped the typical stories of how and why we each got to hiking the AT. I ended up pushing on ahead and got to the Tricorner shelter before her. I stopped long enough to eat a little something and refill my water bottle. She was just arriving when I was pushing out to keep going. It was only 3pm and I wanted to make the 7.7 miles down the trail to the next shelter. It was mostly downhill with a few climbs. It was a really cool section and I’m glad I did push on. I have now completed my first 20 mile day. 20.3 miles to be exact. I’m so happy to make it. Other than my ankles hurting I feel really good after making the trek. There was one other guy who pushed on with me. He took it slower than I did. It was nice to know that someone else was not far behind me.On the last push to the shelter I had some signal so I called my dad to let him know. While I was talking to him four military jets came screaming right over me. They started low in the valley on the Tennessee side and I had a clear view of them pulling up just right on top of the mountain. It’s was so cool to watch them and talk to my dad at the same time. It was a small way of sharing the trail.There is a ridgerunner here named Ricky “Capt. Caveman”. He is a little younger than I am I would guess. He means well but he doesn’t know how to be personable with the leadership and guidance his position has. So he comes across a little arrogant and unsure of himself. He told me that I had to hang my bear canister. I couldn’t stop myself from looking at him like he was the biggest idiot. He continued with some line about bears just taking canisters or damaging them. That’s the chance you take with having the bear canister though. It wasn’t worth the argument with him. I had a big enough dry bag in my pack to slide the bear canister in so I hung it up.I am only 8 miles away from the end of the Smokies and this is the end of my 4th day. I didn’t make it the Smokies challenge but I am so close. If I hadn’t gone into Gatlinburg or didn’t sleep in this morning I might have been able to make it. I’m okay with not having made it. I gave it a good try while still having fun. I walked through the rain and the frozen early morning hours. The weather today was just amazing it was warm but not to hot. I have seen all the weather the Smokies have to offer. I have loved my time in them.,"Icewater Shelter

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649521,"Today has been a good day. I descended around 4000 feet in elevation out of the Smokies. I crossed under I-40. And then I ascended another 4000 feet in elevation up to a campsite for the night. And I did it all in about 15 miles. It was 10 miles going down and then 5 miles back up. I’m still deciding which was worse/better.I slept in and had a late start to the day. Ronin was already leaving the shelter when I was just crawling out of my sleeping bag. It was a peaceful morning as only a few people were around the shelter and no one was really talking. I liked it a lot.The trail coming out of the Smokies was rough. Well rocky is the better description. It was covered constantly in rocks ranging from golf ball size to basketball size. Bigger rocks than these aren’t a problem. They are usually buried in the ground and don’t move. I’ve learned to read the trail and know where I’d like to step around these rocks. It’s not always right but it works. With the trail being so covered in loose rocks that were odd shapes and would just roll or turn over I was constantly twisting my ankles and feet into odd positions. It hurt so bad. I think one of the worse pains I have ever felt in my feet was stepping on a rock and it bending my foot in the wrong way. The pain shot from the base of my foot up my leg. I nearly fell over. I had to take a few minutes to just sit down. Thankfully the pain went away and it hasn’t happened again today.Other than the rocks it was a nice downhill roll out of the Smokies. I love the Smokies but I am happy to be out of them. I encountered the downpour of rain for a day, the freezing temperatures for a day covered in ice, and a day full of the most beautiful hiking weather. You just never know what the Smokies are going to hold. I dropped the second half of my hiking permit in the permit box as I exited and I signed it that I had completed the Smokies in 4.5 days. If I looked at the hours I actually only missed the Smokies challenge of 4 days by a couple of hours. Even with all I faced in the Smokies and with a trip into Gatlinburg I still almost made it. I will have to come back and do it later.Right out of the Smokies I crossed under I-40. It was like encountering a little bit of home. I then wandered up the trail and a short gravel road to Standing Bear Hostel. I got there along with Ronin. We weren’t sure what to do. So we found another hiker we knew and he said just go up to the main house and talk to someone. So we did. We went in the front door and started looking for someone in charge. It’s a really cool house it’s a mixture of old farm house with really old wooden floors and a more modern cabin with nice clean wood beams and a massive tv on the wall. We eventually did find a lady and asked about checking in and she just stared at us and said we were in her house. We apologized several times and back tracked to the front porch with her. She was upset and pointed out a doorbell. But there was no signs telling people what to do. I got a shower and resupplied some food. The whole place was very interesting. Like buildings were just like thrown together with whatever was laying around. Scrap pieces of wood, windows, doors that didn’t fit well, etc. The place seems to be run by a family who live around the land. It’s a neat place but the family all acted like it was an inconvenience when I had to ask them for something. Like when I asked about taking a shower but not staying the night the lady just rolled her eyes and said it would be $5. When I asked about where the showers were she rolled her eyes again and told me where. She then remembered to say that the towels weren’t up there though so we would have to go find some in the laundry hut. And I do mean a hut. There is no washer. You have to scrub your clothes in the sink on a washboard. Which is really cool but I’m not paying for laundry and then doing it myself. I was tempted to stay and see some friends roll into the area. But Ronin had a good point of getting the big climb out of the way today rather than in the morning.After eating a whole pizza, which I knew was a mistake but I loved it anyways, I pushed out with Ronin. We made it the nearly 4000 feet in elevation in 5 miles up to a campsite. It was so hard and I thought I was going to throw up almost every step of he way. I sweated so badly that the shower earlier was pointless but it was so nice when I took it. I dunked my head in the stream on the way up. But we made it and had time to talk more. Ronin is from CO. So we connected over my time there and all the places we had been. He has traveled a lot in Asia so I got to hear some crazy and cool stories. I told a few from going to Haiti. It was a good evening with just the two of us. We talked about how much we have been around others on the AT and getting a night away from them all is peaceful. I like him a lot. I’m looking forward to getting to know him more.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649522,"What a day to push for big miles and time to take a nap in the middle of the day. I found a good pace right out of the gate leaving the campsite this morning and the miles just rolled by. There were some good climbs and descents but there were also some nice rolling sections where I only gained and lost less than 200 feet. Those miles just slipped by.I made it to the top of Mack’s Patch around noon. It was warm and sunny with big puffy clouds. I could see all the way back to the Smokies I had left behind as well as see all the way around. I will most certainly be coming back to enjoy sitting up there again. While I was up there I called my mom, I ate lunch, saw a couple get engaged, and took a short nap. The nap was the only mistake. By the time Ronin caught up to me I could feel my skin burning. I am a little pink but it will fade in the coming days.Just before we left Mack’s Patch we met Clarenda and Brian. Clarenda is from Canada. Brian is from Alabama. They were an odd but nice couple. They obviously met online and were figuring things out. They were exploring the local area and curious about us being Thru hikers. Clarenda has been to the top of mount Katahdin a couple of times. She says it’s a beautiful view. We told them to explore the section between the end of the Smokies and I-40. There are a ton of wile flowers and a gorgeous waterfall. I had taken my time and soaked my feet in the cold water there.Ronin and I still had the goal of reaching a 20 mile day in order to Nero into Hot Springs. So we pushed it hard. We made the climb up and over Mount Bluff. To our disappointment, we discovered that there isn’t an actual bluff on the mountain. We agreed that the “bluff” is all the false summits that the mountain has. It was a brutal and hot climb up. I would not want to make that climb at that hour again. The way down was drastically different. It was so smooth. We coasted along dirt paths in a field of wild flowers and small green plants with old oaks scattered around. It was the eastern side of the mountain, so the evening sun was in the west, and we were in the mountains shadow. The temperature was cooling off. We talked and just let the evening bring us down the mountain. We pushed it a little late in finding a campsite on the side of the mountain. Ronin knew of one from the FarOut app. It was 7:30pm when we got there. There was already someone set up and there really wasn’t enough room on the tiny ledge for more than two tents total. I insisted Ronin take it and I found a flattish spot with my head slightly raised in between two roots. It was a nice spot except for being right on the edge of a steep slope that ran into the small stream maybe 10 feet from me. I figured if I rolled off at least the bushes would stop me before I fell off the ledge the stream was running off of. With not enough room I didn’t bother with a tent. I put my plastic footprint down, air pad, and sleeping bag right on the ground. I am cowboy camping out under the stars. With the ledge being so small there wasn’t really a place to put my bear canister so I closed it and left it sitting next to me. The other persons bear bag and robins are within eyesight and not very well hung. So if a bear comes we all had bigger issues than our food. I think we will be fine. I’m so ready for a bed and shower in Hot Springs tomorrow.","Campsite
",Campsite,"Apr 22, Fri",20.10
Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649524,"What a good day. I slept well enough under the stars. It was really cool at first to listen to the water running close by and see the stars and a satellite or two slip through the night sky. But then the night things started to be active. I had a couple of mice run over or around me. That made me move just to scare them away. But then at some point in the night I woke up to a big branch breaking in the trees just above us which caused a huge crash as it fell. Something heavy was up in the tree. I turned my headlamp on but I couldn’t see anything. I just knew the bear was coming into our tiny campsite for sure. But it never did. So I eventually got back to sleep.The sunrise was really nice. I couldn’t actually see the sun but the sky still turned red along the ridge of the mountains and the sky grew lighter and lighter. It was nice to just lay there and not be in a hurry to leave. Eventually I knew I had to get up and move. If Ronin and I moved fast enough we could be in Hot Springs my mid morning and could get second breakfast. I mean “Brunch”. Brunch seems to be the more civilized way of saying things. The hiker hunger is real. I can eat almost anytime and it doesn’t matter what it is. A tortilla with peanut butter and cheese with Dorito crumbs poured on top of it. That sounds so good for anytime in the day. I’ve eaten similar things for second breakfast. Also tuna can go with anything.We made it into Hot Springs around 10am. We got checked in at Laughing Heart Hostel. I got a bed in their bunkhouse. It’s a single bed that I can feel the springs through but it will be nice compared to the ground. After getting checked in we went down to the diner and got “brunch”. I went for the Double Skillet Breakfast. It’s tatter tots topped with sausage, onions, green peppers, and a ton of cheese. Then there are two eggs and two home made biscuits on the side. It felt so amazing to know I could eat as much as I could and it was all mine. It weighed around 5 pounds or so. I ate half of it. I was still hungry but I knew my stomach wouldn’t hold more. So I saved the rest of it for tomorrow morning.After that I got a shower and did laundry for the first time in a week. It felt so nice to wash the grim off. The loaner clothes were gym shorts and a floral cotton shirt. I knew it was a thing but since you can’t carry cotton on the trail when you get into town you can wear it and it feels so soft. I loved it so much!I looked ahead and I think it will take me about 5 days to get to outside Erwin TN. So I resupplied food at the outfitter here in town. I came into town with very little food left. Which is good. I started carrying so much more food than I actually needed. Which they say you pack your fears and going hungry is something I never want to do. But I’m getting closer to hitting the mark of just the right amount of food. The outfitter here in town knows hikers are coming. The trail actually goes right through town. There are AT markers on the sidewalk. So the outfitter has a wide spread of food and gear for the thru hikers. The price was high but they have to in order to make the money in this leak hiker season to make it through the down season. It’s nice to support a small local company and I paid for good food.The crew that I had been at the top of Clingman’s dome and went into Gatlinburg with showed up this afternoon. So it was cool to see them and hang out. We all went out to the Brewery for dinner tonight. I’m really liking the group. Igor and I connected on being homeschooled and growing up playing soccer. Oh and the rest of the Pain Train are here. So I got to catch up with them. They are all taking a zero tomorrow. I’m considering it. I kinda want to go ahead and push on but a lot of this experience is about the people. Looking back I think I will remember the people and memories more than that I pushed big miles. Plus with it being 5 days to Erwin I would rather do it with people I know than to do it one day ahead of them and be forced to meet new people. I want to meet knew people but Im not in a hurry to do it. Tomorrow is also Sunday and getting to go to church and then FaceTime in to see my family will be a nice day.","Campsite

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649930,"I started today with not knowing if I would head out or zero today. I was torn between getting more miles in and spending time with the people I have become friends with. I called and talked to my parents before they went to church and processed what I should do. I decided that it’s the people I will remember more than the miles so I am staying. I talked to the guy who runs the Hostel and got my bunk for another night.I ate the leftovers from “brunch” yesterday and it was the envy of everyone. I couldn’t eat it all so I gave some to a few people. I then walked down to the coffee shop for a good mocha and then went to the Baptist church in town. There was only 12 people there and I was at least 30 years younger than anyone else there. They all welcomed and greeted me. We sang a few hymns and then a short sermon about how Christ became flesh and how we have assurance in our belief of going to heaven. It was nice to worship with fellow believers in a church building.Later I FaceTimed my mom and got to see and talk to my family who were at Nana and Poppop’s for lunch. I updated my journal entries and then just layer around in the grass in the shade. I played corn hole and frisbee with some friends.I had a really nice conversation with Kara about my time at Victory Junction and what my job entailed. It was good for me to be able to talk about it. It helped me process all the things that working at camp over the years has taught me.The group I was first hiking with started coming in this afternoon. Prosecco, Phoenix, and Moon came through and I talked to them for a little while and they were so excited to see me. It was cool. I didn’t see Spicy Onion and Candyman come through. They are staying somewhere else. I text the group chat saying they should come hang and got a maybe. Then I said I was headed to the brewery for dinner and invited them. I got nothing in response. I guess they took my departure a little harder than I thought. I have become the black sheep to them. I hate they feel that way but I don’t regret pushing ahead. We are all out here to hike our own hike. Getting sucked into a group think this early in the trail is going to cause issues at some point.Later I got a group to go down to the brewery for dinner. Kara had had one too many drinks and I took the responsibility of getting her back up to the hostel. I was doing my best to keep her to the side of the road but I just couldn’t do it. A cop ended up pulling behind us and turning on his blue lights. He asked if I was aware we almost got ran over. Which wasn’t true I had turned and waved the car around us. He asked what I can only assume are the typical questions of have you been drinking tonight. I told him that I was just trying to get her back to the hostel and that we were thru-hikers. With me clearly speaking to him not intoxicated he told us off for walking in the street and asked me to get her back safe. Which we were only 100 yards from the hostel. Hot Springs is such a small town. I know he was just doing his job and making sure we were alright. I appreciate that he did. There are so many hikers in town I’m sure he deals with a lot of situations of people having too much to drink. We did make it back to the hostel and I sat down with some friends and they said I was a gentleman and a scholar for doing what I did. I thanked them and then said that I was at that moment not responsible for anything else.Ronin decided to stick around for the day as well. His air mattresses was cut by glass when we camped out and he has been trying to patch it. He got some epoxy from the hardware store and tried that today. Hopefully it works for him. There are several of us who are pushing on tomorrow. Which will be nice. The hostel is packed out with so many people. I have had my fill of people and I need the woods again.","Laughing Heart Hostel

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649931,"Today was another easy day of laying around and then a really challenging climb up and out of Bot Springs. I went to breakfast with pretty much every hiker I have met so far at the diner in Hot Springs. They are apparently the only place that has breakfast. I ordered something different this time and it was really good. While waiting for our food I got to have a conversation with Grandmaster’s father. He is really nice. He is a teacher for adults with disabilities in Holland. So when I talked about camp and my experiences we both got excited. We ended up sharing stories of the things we have seen and the people we have worked with. Grandmaster and his dad were going to hike with us but it is too much for his dad. So they are going to drive around and camp for the next week or two. They will have a blast I’m sure.I had originally thought about heading out as soon as we finished breakfast but it was so hot when we finished that I decided to just wait and Nero out with the group. When we did leave we went to get smoothies and then went to the other side of the French Broad River. There was an area that rafts out in and out and we all waded out into the river. It was so cold but it felt so nice in the heat.I had my first bear sighting today. I had stopped to filter some water at a small spring. Strider and Messenger had caught up and passed me while I was there. Messenger had only just left when I was finishing up. Since there was more water in my bag I left it hanging and the water coming out of the filter to wash my hands, head and neck. While I was doing this I heard a grunt. So I looked up thinking Someone might be on the trail behind me but then I realized it came from above me on the ridge. I then saw a black bear through the trees. Him looking at me and me looking at him. He was maybe 40 feet up on the ridge from me. So I made a loud noise and then said “Hey Bear!” But he was already running down the ridge line and then down the other side away from me. He clearly saw and smelled me before I had made a noise. I think his grunt was his was of exclaiming his surprise before turning to run. It was cool to see one finally.We pushed out with just enough time to go 8 miles in to the Fire watch tower for the sunset. The sunset was ruined by some clouds but it still was nice. Gumby, Igor, Strider, Messenger and I decided to sleep in the tower. It has a roof even though it’s open air. We can see city lights in the distance.

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649932,"What a hard day. I really didn’t have much fun. Waking up for the sunrise in the watch tower was just beautiful! The sun coming up over a mountain in the distance words fail to describe. And that was the highlight of my day. It started raining an hour or so after that it was a cold rain. The rain pants I did have ripped so I had thrown them out and the rain jacket isn’t worth it. I got soaked the first time I wore it. So I didn’t even bother wearing it. I wrapped it over my pack to see if it helped keep my pack dry.It was just a miserable day trudging along in the rain. Lunch was a hurried event at a shelter because of how cold it was. My puffy coat isn’t waterproof so I kept it tucked away in my bag. I really wanted a hot lunch but there were so many people crammed into a tiny shelter just trying to stay dry it just wouldn’t have worked.The rain did clear out for about an hour. I came across a sign in that time that gave two options with arrows. Left was the “Bad weather alternate route” and right was “Exposed Ridgeline”. So of course I chose the exposed Ridgeline. It was actually the most magical climb I’ve seen so far. The stones were stacked like stairs from a bygone era. With massive rocks forming a pathway you had to follow. There were old trees whose roots crawled over the rocks. I just was amazed. And then to get up on the Ridgeline was so cool. I was up above the tree line and above the surrounding bushes. However, due to the rain and clouds I was in a complete white out. I couldn’t see more than maybe 30 feet. It felt like I was just out on my little island. Adrift on the mountain air. I loved being up there. The climb down from there was really technical and I almost fell a few times. At the bottom of it I hit mile marker 300. It felt so good to cross it. It was the next dream I was pushing for.The rain started to pick up again when I made it to the shelter I was staying at so I quickly put my tent up and climbed inside. I got my shoes and socks in by the fire in the shelter and then got water. After that I got changed into dry clothes and took a nap. I got up late to make dinner and see other roll into camp. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.","Rich Mountain Lookout Tower

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649933,"It’s been a good day. It started really cold due to the humidity that the rain had left but it warmed up throughout the day. There was some big climbs today and it was tough to get up some of them. It helped that I spent some good time hiking with others who helped the time go by.The first mountain I summited was Big Butt Mountain. Named for a massive rock on it that has a crack all the way down the middle of it. I have a picture of it. Other parts of the trail was a lot of scrambling over big rocks. I came to one that I didn’t think I would fit through the space between the rocks. So I took my pack off and passed it through ahead of me and then put it back on. From the top of the mountain there was some good views of the surrounding area. Looking west the ground just fell off to flat land stretching into the distance. It was so strange to look out and not see more mountains. Coming down from this mountain the trail was just so smooth. There were few rocks and roots. It was an easy decline for miles. The trail was winding down the side of the mountain. Trees were spread out and large so I could see a good distance. I came to a gap that the trail passed near to but didn’t cross into. I was looking at what a cool campsite it would be when I saw a buck standing in it eating grass. So I stopped in my tracks and watched him. I then slowly took steps toward him. He watched me but seemed unbothered that I was there. Cracker came up behind me a few minutes later. Just moving along in his own thoughts so I signaled him to look and then he stopped. We stood there for a few minutes and then a doe came from off to one side and joined him. We watched them just graze for a while before we quietly moved passed them. It was really cool to encounter and watch them in their natural habitats. I’m sure they must see people all the time for them to be so calm around us.I rolled into camp with no water left only to learn that water was 0.22 downs side trail. So I took my gallon water bag and filter. I filled my bottom down there and then carried my water bag back up full. I knew others would be coming who needed it. I was right and they thanked me. It wasn’t enough for everyone but it was enough to give them the immediate relief they needed. A couple of people took my bag at different times to fill it for the group over the evening. My bag full of water fell at one point when I was getting water from it and it burst. It was right at the top by the fill spout. So I think I can tape it up and it be fine. I’m not worried about it. Everyone on the trail talks about how there original Sawyer bags got a hole or ripped so I have been expecting it to happen. The price you pay for something being light, thin, plastic.I’m sleeping in the shelter for the first time with this group so we will see who snores. Tomorrow we are pushing for 20 miles and others are talking about pushing the 26 miles into Erwin. I don’t think I’ll be doing that.I found some signal to get a text that Emily went into labor, there were complications with the umbilical cord and they were headed to the hospital for a c-section. Later I got a text saying the baby boy was born and was in the NICU with low blood sugar. So I’m praying for them. ","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649935,"It was a good day. I spent almost the whole day with others in the group. I was slow to get out of the shelter but I caught up to people quickly.Right out of camp there was a short climb of about 400 feet in elevation and then it was all downhill to cross under a highway. Just after going under the bridge there was a little trail Magic waiting on us. They guy there was Zen’s wife’s cousin. Which is a bit of a stretch for me since I have only ever met Zen a couple of times. But the guy giving the trail Magic and I got to talking and turns out he grew up in Coleridge, NC. He knows Randleman well. It was cool to find someone who actually knows my home town.Immediately out from the trail Magic there was a climb of 2500 feet over 5 miles or something. It was a grueling climb up. It ended with several of us all together. So we cruised down and over the next rolling section together. We “scuttled” most of the way down the next couple of miles.The next climb we did was to get up to the top of Big Bald. It is a beautiful bald mountain that gives you 360 degrees of just amazing views. The climb to get there is challenging one at times. It also has what I’m starting to call “whoop-de-doos”. It’s small section of the trail that has you standing just up from a tree. The trail then makes a slope first down and then back up to just up from another tree. These can be as short as a few feet up to going 100 feet. The bigger they get the bigger the swoop gets. These can be going up or coming down the mountain. It’s used when the angle of the mountain is too steep to create a trail with steady incline. Anyways, the whoop-de-doos helped break up the climb. About mid way up we found some trail Magic right on the trail. It was a couple of coolers with fruit and hard boiled eggs. The eggs were so good. I doubt I’ve ever had a better cold boiled egg in my life. HahaFrom the top of Big Bald we could see so much. The whole group sat down and stayed to have a little break and some lunch. I called my mom to try and get more info about Emily and the baby. She told me what she could about the circumstances and that she was trying to get in to see them. The whole group I’m hiking with is invested at this point and wanted to know the updates. They were excited for me when I told them last night but then this morning they kept asking how they were and if there was a photo yet. I did get a photo and was able to show them on top of the bald. It’s been challenging for me to have limited service and only getting pieces of what’s going on when I do. I can only imagine what my brother and Emily are going through with it all. I have been praying constantly for them. So having the group be excited for the baby and care to ask if I have heard anything helps me a lot.I had a first for me on the trail today. I used my trowel to dig a cat hole and took a poop in the woods. I’ve done it before so it’s nothing new to me but I haven’t done it while hiking the AT. I’ve been able to use the Privy’s (primitive bathroom). I fell behind when I took my time. Which leads to the next thing that happened. I came up to a road and Robyn was just sprawled out next to it. I asked if she had been hit. She hadn’t. This was just as far as she had gotten and couldn’t go further. So I talked to her about life, family and things off the trail. She did 23 miles the day before so pushing for a 20 mile today was hard work. After 30 minutes I told her we couldn’t stay next to the road. We had to push the 4.7 miles up to the shelter or go back and find a tenting place. It took us a while but I slowly pushed her up the mountain and over to the shelter. She said later that if it wasn’t for me she never would have made it. So I’m glad I could do that for her. It‘s a saying on the trail to “hike your own hike”. It means that you can do what you want. If you want to take all the side trails and only move at 8 miles a day go for it. If you want to sleep until noon and then hike into the night with a headlamp. Go for it! But we are also forming friendships and tramilys (trail families) where we depend on others and look for them at places. We share so many things. Even our most coveted food gets shared. I have shared more food with people I’ve only know for a couple of weeks than I have to friends from a life time. It’s the shared experience that we have all walked the same trail in the same pouring rain or slept on the same uneven ground. So leaving Robyn on the side of the road no matter how tired I was or she was just wasn’t an option. If she wanted to go back a half mile and find a place to set up her tent I would have done it with her. When we did make it close to the shelter we had to get water before arriving and hike the 0.2 up with our water. I told her to go on and I would bring my big bag. When I got there she was just laying on the ground outside the shelter talking to Pam and Kevin. She was so tired. So I sat down and started filtering the water and insisting she had to eat. She couldn’t just go to sleep. She perked up after getting some food in her system. It’s just the two of us sleeping in the shelter tonight with several people in their tents near by. Several of our group kept pushing a few miles into town past the shelter. I know that as tired as I am I could have pushed on as well. But when I found her on the side of the road my plans changed. I saw how tired, how hungry, and just done she was. She needed help. It made me think of the parable in the Bible of the man who was beaten and robbed and left on the side of the road. It was the Samaritan who stopped to help him. A stranger. How much more is expected of me? She is part of this tramily I have joined. With the trail being a subculture, and hiking the AT a life time, she is my sister. I feel good knowing I did what I think was the right thing. I am writing this a couple of days later after thinking about the events. It strikes me as a real life moment of the parable. Other hikers in our trail family left her there. I’m not casting blame on them. They likely thought she would pull herself together and make it up the hill in time. Just a quick rest and she would be alright. How many other hikers had walked right by her before I got there, though? When I found her she was not alright. She has said that she likely would have just set her tent up right there in the grass beside the road if I hadn’t stopped. We don’t often get to live out a parable in the flesh like this. In “real life” we as Christian’s talk about the spiritual and the physical ways we should help people. I like to think that on the whole we do okay to serve a hurting world. But it’s easy to see it as “we are serving others”. To walk out the same steps of a parable is a humbling and thought provoking process. It has moved me to tears to have the chance to show this kind of love. To not reach into the dirt to help someone less fortunate than me. But rather to be on the same path, just as dirty, still tired, and thirsty. To help her up on her feet. To walk at her pace to slowly make it up. To give her of my water and food. To make sure she didn’t go to bed hungry. To make sure she got room to set up her bed roll and to sleep as comfortable as possible. I had my own issues and struggles. I went to bed thirsty to know she had enough to last her. I keep thinking about how Christ walked this earth the same as we do. He was covered in dirt, he was thirsty and needed food. There was nothing about the human experience that he didn’t encounter. He is the example and I should aim to imitate him as best I can. It is a powerful experience to walk out a parable that he talked about.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649936,"It was an easy walk down into Erwin, TN today. There were some great views on the way down of the river and the town in the distance. I spent some of the morning with Zen and Dubz. Zen is retired from psychology and Dubz has spent the past 6 years in the Army as a Ranger. I really enjoyed hearing more about each of them and why they are on the AT. While we were walking I got a text from Evan with the name of my new nephew. It’s a good one! I love it.I made it to the Hostel by 10:30am and got a tenting spot. I got a text shortly after being set up that Summer and Brian were on the way to me. I was so excited. They arrived and I gave them both big hugs. It was so great to see them! We went to lunch and they had so many questions for me. They brought my resupply food and items from my parents. So it was good to be able to get food without having to pay for it. Summer and Brian were shocked to see how much I could eat. For every item that I put into my bear canister I would tell them about it and then eat one or more. And I did it with every thing I packed. Even after eating lunch I just continued to eat. They had brought me fresh pineapple. It was so good! I ate almost the whole container.After they left I caught a shuttle into town and hung out at the outfitter with a few people. I got my picture taken with Billy the Bigfoot. Whom they had sitting in a camp chair in their window. I loved it. I volunteered to ride a towny bike back to the hostel and let Igor ride back in the shuttle. It was so nice to be on a bike again. Even a crappy old towny was a joy.","No Business Knob Shelter

Paula asked me if I had heard that people are either running away from or running to something. I said that I had. She asked if I thought it was true. I told her I thought both were true. We are all both running from and running toward something else. It’s a duality. She agreed with me but couldn’t put it into words. She wanted to know what I was running from/to. I told her about how God put a reset on my life last year and I am out here trying to figure everything out. I asked her in return if she would share. I won’t share it here in respect for her privacy, but she is struggling with figuring out who she is and wants to be. She is young and others will make decisions for her if she doesn’t begin to. It’s a tough position. Met up with Cracker, Gumby and Sing Along at the campsite under big power lines to set up for the night. We could hear the power popping all night.

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650986,"Great day. We went up and over Roan Mountain today. It was a long, hard climb. We stopped and had lunch at the shelter on top of the mountain. It’s the highest one on the AT. It’s actually a cabin. It has 4 walls, a door, and a second level you have to climb a ladder to. How cool?! First one we have found like this. Camped at an old barn that was a shelter that had been closed. The barn seemed to be still in good shape but with its age I guess it had to be taken out of service before it did begin to fall. The privy was great! It had a bejeweled seat cover and a great view of the mountains. I woke up in the night to pee and I happened to look up. I was shocked to see the Milky Way in the sky. Just faintly I could tell where it was. I had my fast fly open on the side so I could see out. I was awake for a long while just watching the stars and Milky Way slowly turning. It was an awesome night.","Clyde Smith Shelter

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650988,"Crazy day. Went over the Roan Highlands. Big bald mountains that we could see a long way. I could see Grandfather Mountain in the distance and showed everyone in the crew. Ate a great Ruben Sandwich at Station 19E. Crossed the 400 mile marker. Wahoo! Played in Jones Falls and loved it.Sing Along, Gumby, Messenger, Strider and I had played in the falls and then were leaving when Fruit Ninja (Paula) came up. She was so excited for the falls she went running off the side trail toward it. The rest of us started down the trail. After a short time Strider and I being in the back heard a scream. A scream from a distance through the woods can only be described as unnerving. Strider said “Hey guys….” And my brain said “Paula!” I turned and ran. I made it about 50 feet with my pack on before I realized I needed to get it off. I unclipped it in stride and pulled my phone out. I let it fall to the ground and kept running. As I was starting to run it also began to rain. The whole time running I kept having worse and worse thoughts of what happened to her in the falls. There is an upped section that you can climb to and the rocks are very slippery. I had gone up there and knew better than to get close to the edge. If she had slipped from there, Lord in Heaven, only knew what could have happened. Broken leg, head injury, spinal injury, etc. I kept hearing screaming over and over. I thought I could make out “Someone Help!” I realized my mistake I’m not grabbing my emergency beacon and yelled back down the trail for someone to grab one. I yelled “Paula we’re coming!” As loud as I could while running. I slowed from being out of breath at one point but then had renewed energy at the next scream. As I got close to the falls I slowed as not to slip and realized that I hadn’t heard a scream in a little while. I prepared myself for the worst. I rounded a bend and saw Paula sitting just up from the lower pool. At the sight of me she raised her arms into the air in what I perceived as an “I’m saved.” manner. I asked if she was hurt and she responded with two thumbs up. With her being conscious I slowed even further but started climbing into the falls and over the rocks. Paula then started moving toward me. Perfectly fine. I asked her as she was standing in front of me if she was injured. She said “No. Why?” I was so relieved and out of breath I just crumpled to the ground. Strider, Messenger and Gumby came up right behind me and I waved to them and said she was fine. Paula was screaming from excitement at playing in a waterfall. I made the 0.5 mile run, back up the mountain, in the matter of a few minutes. The adrenaline pumping through my system. My heart rate was through the roof. But Paula was alright. She wasn’t hurt. I have run for emergencies when I worked at camp. But even in those situations I knew there was medical staff coming as well. This time there was no one else coming other than those in my group. Sing Along (Robyn) is a doctor, so she would have been a wealth of knowledge but she was a long way behind me. In this situation I truly ran with everything I had. I gave everything I could to just getting to her. Paul realized that we had all thought she was hurt and came running. She said we were the most caring people in the world. We left her getting her things together at the falls and began to go find our bags and move along to the shelter we were aiming for. It was another 3 or 4 miles. It poured down rain the whole time. I was soaked by the time I got there. I got changed into dry clothes and started eating everything in my Bear vault. It had already been a long day, and then to have the adrenaline dump of running, I was beat. When Paula arrived she was almost in tears that she had caused such a panic. I immediately hugged her when she arrived. Soaking wet and in the rain. She apologized. I told her it was okay. I would have run that distance a thousand times just to make sure no one was hurt. I was so relieved she was fine. I wasn’t mad at all. Of course on my walk to the shelter in the pouring rain I had felt with the little frustration I had about the situation but that wasn’t her fault. She was just excited.","Yellow Mountain Gap

It was a long day with not many views. I think one of the things that really kept me going was getting to the resort to get a shower. The shower was really nice. The loaner clothes were even better. They were all nursing scrubs. So I have a crazy shirt with barn animals having a picnic and baby blue pants. It’s a look for sure. We took over the bunk house. It has 5 bunk beds so the 8 of us in the group took most of the beds. I’m thankful that we got the beds. The other options for us were to rent a whole cabin and all of us split the price. Which would have been fine but more expensive. I really like the resort area. They are right on the river and have plenty of space. I think this would be a really cool place to rent the whole place out for a weekend for like a wedding or family retreat.

Robert Cheek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650991,"Slack-packed up and over Pond Mountain. It was a 2000 feet elevation gain and loss over 6 miles. It was a good climb. Our packs were taken to Boots Off Hostel. It only cost each of us $5. It was a great deal for us. We went by Laurel Falls. And we climbed in and swam around in the pool. It was freezing cold. I wasn’t going to but then decided I would regret it. So I climbed in. The trail then followed the river for a while. We actually had a path that went out and around a big rock that jutted into the river. It was really cool. I stayed at Boots Off for a little while hanging out with the group. We all set out together to go around Watauga lake. It was nice going around it. I have plans I’m trying to make happen so I planned to go further than the rest of them. I stayed to eat supper where some were going to set up. But then Rocket, Messenger, Sing Along, and Gumby decided to move on to find a better place to camp. So we walked out and over the dam. It was really cool. Then when we got the trail again I pushed on ahead.We met Thing 1 and Thing 2 a few days ago and they have been around us. They pushed on to a spring about a mile from the shelter. So I made it here to them as they had pushed on while I ate. They saw 3 bears on their way up here. I didn’t see anything. The climb up to this ridge was pretty challenging. I’ve done harder ones it taking it on in the evening sun and racing the sunset made me push hard. I was going to cowboy camp with the guys but then the forecast says we could get rain in the night.

So this will all play out before this gets posted so I will share that I have pushed miles up in order to get picked up and surprise my mom for Mother’s Day. The plan was going to plan for my dad to pick me up in Damascus, VA. tomorrow afternoon. And then things went a little sideways with a Tornado Watch and thunderstorms for the area. I hiked most of the day in the rain with some thunder. I’ve done that before and it was fine. Looking at the weather after the fact I would have been fine to stay out in the weather for one more night but there was the chance. It could have been bad if I was in a shelter in the mountains when a tornado came through.Anyways, I started the day early to get a good start. I was shooting for around 24 miles today. I made good time coming across the ridge I was on. It was small ups and downs. I think I must have pulled something on my left knee as it started to hurt and refuse to hold my whole weight. I was still making good time though.I made it to TN 91 by 1pm, which was 13 miles. I stopped for a break and a snack. Then a USFS volunteer showed up and asked if she could have me fill out a survey about my time in the Big Laurel Branch Wilderness. I got a free Orange out of it so I did. Her name is Karen and she is likely in her 60’s. She was really sweet.Then I hiked through a cow pasture. Which was interesting to be dodging cow poop on the trail. I then had to work my way through the herd. They didn’t seem to mind me much.When I got to US 421 I stopped for another break and to get water. When I checked my phone the group text was talking about a Tornado Watch for the area. I knew the storms were still coming but that took it to another level. So I hitched a ride into Bristol. The guy who gave me a ride was Tim. He lives in the area. At his recommendation, he dropped me off at The Cave. It’s a family owned Italian place. As I walked in the whole staff were at the door and windows watching the storm roll in. I explained who I was and why I was there and they said I was welcome to stay. I ordered a calzone and it was great. After talking to my dad and looking at all the weather still coming we decided that he and my mom would come get me.While I was waiting for them to come I met the Schrenker family. They were a lot of fun to talk to and get to know while waiting for my parents. They wanted to know what gear I use on the trail. I ended up doing a show and tell of my gear for them. It was a lot of fun to break down everything I use and how I use it. It was a lot of fun to meet them.The place closed before my parents arrived but the owner let me sit under their outdoor covered area while I waited. My parents were so excited to see me. We loaded my stuff and headed home. We hadn’t made it far and I started getting car sick. I haven’t been that fast in several weeks. And to do it in the dark with lights flying by. It wasn’t good. I ended up crawling into the back seat and laying down with my eyes covered. I slept most of the way home.It was so nice and odd to sleep in my own bed. But I loved it so much.","Campsite by Spring
