Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/261033,"Well here it is another year and all I seem to do is think about the AT. What’s around the next curve of the trail, what adventure will reveal its self, so much to take in it’s most overwhelming? The allure of the AT will forever be a motivational force in my life.I am not the most literate individual as my cellmates can attest to, however I will try to convey my true feelings as best I can. This is a disclaimer for all my missed spelled words and grammatical errors. I am planning my section hike for two weeks in May with my nephew starting from Hog Pen Gap to hopefully Fontana Dam. It seems kind of ambitious for a slow poke like me and considering all my ailments but my hiking companion (22 year old Gator collage student) will most likely motivate me to make miles. I have not made many arrangements yet but I am thinking the Hike Inn at Fontana should fill all my requirements. I have heard there some real nice people and put up with a lot of hiker requests. I have all my gear and enough food to last for at least a week or so and will pick up more along the way as needed. It’s only the logistics of section hiking left to untangle. I have been busy hiking and trying to stay in shape since last years AT hike with 2 weeks in the Smoky Mountains, Grayson Highlands and 1 week at Cumberland Island. I did have a colorful spill in Grayson Highlands; at least my wife (Velva) thought so. It was a very bitter cold day at Massy Gap and we decided to do a Day hike at some lower elevation by a trail that parallel the creek. Well I wanted to go to the other side of the creek and look around and ended flat on my back in the middle with a cook pot permanently implanted in my back side not to mention the now slightly dampened clothing. I paid dearly by a verbal tongue lashing from my bride for rock hopping and a cook pot size multi colored bruise on my back side. She has reservations about me walking down the street unsupervised. She has however consented to let me go for an AT walk. I no doubt would be adrift with out her. I have been undecided on retiring May 2010 but I know I want to finish the AT before I get to old and broken so I have decided on testing the waters for Leave With Out Pay (LWOP) statics while I hike and then return to work. All I have to do is convince my Boss that it would be a worth wile adventure and I would be a better employee upon returning. LWOP is a trail name of a guy that had some success in getting the time off. Hope I am so lucky.",,Home,"Feb 02, Mon",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/261063,"In preparation for this year AT walk I have been hiking most every weekend with a day pack. I will kick up my pack weight shortly. It looks a little strange to be hiking around with a 30 lb pack on some of trails in north east FL when no camp sites are available in the facility. O well, my wife Velva said I always look strange so it’s nothing new for me. She loves me just the same. This weekend we went to Etoniah State Forest and hiked part of the Florida Trail to Iron Bridge shelter. What a wonderful hike, we took some pictures of an Owl that poised for 15 min, what a ham. Had lunch and read the journal at the shelter. Hope your knee gets better Hammock Hanger. Our dog (Smoky) accompanied us, he’s quite a trooper as he is only 19 lbs and made it most of the way before wanting to be carried. On the way home stopped and talked to three guys that were heading south, road walking just before the trailhead for the State Forest, they look worn out but happy. One of the guys was going to get his car to end that part of there section hike. I think they said something about watch the super bowl, imagine that.A few more miles and sanity supported by nature.",,Etoniah State Forest,"Feb 03, Tue",0

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/263000,"Well here it is March already and I can’t wait for May to come. Who ever thought a 58 year old would be wishing his life away only to go hiking, sounds like something I would have done 40 years ago. Things are set for my section hike except for the little things like food and such. My nephew and I will leave my house early on 10 May and get a cabin at Goose Creek Cabins Neels Gap Ga. The proprietor will shuttle us to Hog Pen Gap on 11 May and we will hike to Winding Stair Gap in NC for a grand total of 70 miles. I am leaving us a little fudge room so I arranged for a pick up on the 18th with a Cabin at the same place for some R&R then home on the 19th. If things change on the trail and I think this old body will carry me a little farther I hope we can change the pick up time one day or so. I will know more as the time gets closer. I have discovered it is always prudent to be flexible on the trail. My nephew no doubt is carrying around 45 lbs as we have to carry a weeks worth of food and the gear. He will be using my old stuff that is not exactly light so a little suffering will be in order. Hope the weight is enough to slow this 22 year old down so I can keep pace. I on the other hand being old and constantly plagued with old joint syndrome have reduced my pack weight down to 32 lbs which still leaves room for improvement. Maybe I should add some rocks to his pack just in case. The mention of rocks just reminded me to place the 1 oz rock I got from Springer in my pack before I forget. It’s going to make the trip to Katahdin one way or other. I can only hope the lord gives me the strength and resolve to stay the course, ascend Katahdin, place my rock with the many others that have placed them before me and return a better person than I started.""You cannot stay on the summit forever, you have to come down again.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/265096,"Well I tested the water for Leave With Out Pay status for a through hike next year and the establishment decided they just could not afford to loose the manpower. So I guess I have no choice but to take a hike and start my retirement a little earlier than expected if my health stays on the positive side. I would dearly love to continue on to Katahdin this year on my section hike but I don’t have enough leave to afford me the opportunity, but the time is coming quickly when I will have no more obstacles, so in the mean time I will cherish the time God has given me to spend in the woods and squeeze all the goodness out of each minuet I have. I have never been out more than two weeks at a time but each time I feel so rejuvenated I don’t want it to end. Some people think I am nuts but they have never tried it.I have been testing my old bones by taking my pack with me on my weekly outings to area trails. The body has been responding with standard various aches and pains but it is well worth the prices as it reminds you that you’re still on the sunny side. I was awarded with another opportunity to take a good picture of my friend WOODSY OWL, what a ham as he would give me a shot only to depart the perch 1 second before I snapped the shot. I finely prevailed on getting a pose worthy enough to post. I hope you like his good side as he was persistent on sowing it. I just received in the mail from REI a new tent (REI Quarter Dome UL) and Sleeping Bag ( Marmot Sawtooth 15) this will complete the big three that my nephew will use on his maiden voyage with me on the AT section hike this May. Items are a little heavy but the price was pretty good and Trail Journals get a percentage of the cost in return for using REI. Thanks trail Journals for supplying a medium for keeping hikers emotions.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/271014,"The time is drawing near and I glow with anticipation of feeling natures hand even though I know I will incur some discomfort. My big toe on my right foot is acting up as it has been broken twice and not bending the way it should, O well it will make the rest periods all that more enjoyable. I have been working on the food preparation, if you can call putting food into pint size zip locks preparation. My nephew (Josh) and I are going to carry 7 days worth, hope I can keep the weight reasonable. I started of with 27 lbs last year but that was with only 5 days worth. I have a feeling Josh’s pack is going to be a little heaver than mine, he he he. I looked at the weather forecast for next week and it promises to be mostly good with only the normal thunder storms in the afternoon. We will take what comes and deal with it. I have never had a totally bad day hiking. I often think of the shape the world is in right now and how fortunate I am to enjoy what nature has to offer, not to mention my lovely bride and how incredible she is to let me wonder off on mother’s day to play in the dirt. Next week at this time I should be three days into my hike and at Tray Mtn Shelter. The wind will be light, sun will shine, mountain views will be every where and the smell of spring flowers will be in the air. I guess this is day dreaming and I find that I do it often when I need a fix of wondering in the woods.",,Day Dreaming,"May 05, Tue",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/273627,"Josh and I started out at 0730 on Sunday for Goose Creek Cabins after a minor shakedown of clothing and food. After last nights episode of he’s coming and now he’s not I was beginning to wonder if he really wanted to go but he’s young and care free so I will chock it up to that. Its now 1830 and he’s fast asleep I guess hiker midnight came a little early. I am sitting here listening to the creek and the rain make its gentle music (things to come tomorrow) and sipping on my Mickey D’s coffee. When we arrived, there was a bottle of crown on the dresser with a note from the Three Amigos wishing me a good hike. I only wish I had thought of it first. Thanks Amigos, you truly make lasting friends on the trail. I checked with Keith for a shuttle to Hog Pen Gap and we were all set. I remarked that the lodge he has looks like it has some history behind it and to find out it was an old CCC Camp which supported the areas State Parks. I am always impressed with the stone work of that time and how well versed the artisans were in their trade. Well its time for me to get a good nights sleep and of to the woods to play in the dirt tomorrow.","Home

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/273683,"Hog Pen Gap – Blue Mt Campsite Not a bad start, 10.7 miles not including the ½ mile water trip. We started with a shuttle by Keith the Goose Creek proprietor and were entertained with area history. The story he tolled about a load of children on a run away school bus on road Ga 348 was quite a start to our up hill climb to Hog Pen. He assured us his brakes were in good shape. He dropped us off and we took the ceremonial start photo at the Hog Pen Gap rock. The weather to start was rain and mist but gave way to a partly sunny day, overall a very pleasant day in the woods with varied terrain and assorted flowers and fauna. The overall body parts responded well with only the usual aches and pains but ready I was ready to do more miles if needed. I have learned not to push it to much on the first couple of days because that’s when I seem to break things. Met several hikers on the trail but James stands out in particular, he’s is from Ontario Canada. He explained how his body is not performing up to his expectations and will most likely get of the trail if things don’t improve. He was a nice young man but did not seem to poses the enthusiasm required to complete his goal. I only hope I will have the grit when the time comes to start my through hike but as I have heard so many times it’s the journey not the destination. So with that said it was the last time we would see James during our hike. Josh did well today and I was surprised that he hiked in his crocks all day. I would of thought he would of got foot bruised but he told me that he hardly ever where shoes, only at work and class. Guess the professors require shoes. I think his trail name might be “noshoe”. We ended our first days hike at 5 and set up camp at a most grand spot. Josh started a camp fire and we both settled in for pleasant evening of conversation and a sip of crown (thanks Three Amigos). It was close to a perfect day and a grate evening. Hiker midnight has arrived and my eyes are trying to close as I write this in my journal. I will dream of waterfalls and vistas to all a good night.","Goose Creek Cabins

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/273805,"Blue Mtn camp site – Steeltrap Gap 10.3The day started with a good up to Blue Mtn., followed by multiple up/downs Rocky Mt and Tray Mtn and I’m sad to report my so called good knee took a beating. If I was in sports I would be on injured reserve with a very iffy chance of return. If I am able to hike on it will be a whole lot less daily miles, more like 5 or 6. Only time will tell and as always I hope the mountains will work its magical healing power on my knee. It all happened when we decided to go a little farther to a campsite with no water so we had to tank up at Tray Mt Shelter to have enough water for supper and morning meal. So I loaded on 4 liters of water on top of my pack and that seemed to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s knee. By the time I hiked another 2 miles down hill if I was a horse I would have been shot. Thank God for leki hiking poles. There was one funny side to this and the story go’s. Josh had gone on ahead to scout out a suitable camp site fitting the presents of such macho hikers as us and as I was just about on my last leg when I heard him say do you want the good news or the bad. I replied, hit me with the good stuff, the reply was good news is; I found a wonderful camp site and the bad is; it has a good water source so we did not need to carry all that water. I am really kind of bummed about my knee but it is what it is and I will enjoy nature for as long as I can. The most interesting character for the day was machete man that was most likely a permanent resident of Tray Mtn shelter at least for several days by his confession. The name Machete man was quickly attached to him by his ownership of a very large machete (large heavy knife with a broad blade used as a weapon or as a tool for cutting through vegetation, especially in Central and South America and the Caribbean) which he indicated was a multi tool serving among other things as a hunting tool for assorted rodents. He confesses to be subsisting on snails, squirrels and a mouse or two. He also had a unique view on the political climate in the country which made me keenly aware of his self-proclaimed hunting abilities. We also met a nice young couple from Gainesville Florida that just arrived at the shelter (whish I would of got there name) they as well as us were concerned about Machete mans hunting and gathering abilities so we decide collectively to continue on to the next camp site. The camp site was just big enough for three tents but was a nice one with plenty of birds to serenade us in the evening. Josh once again made a small fire and we toasted to a good hike. O we also met Jake and Tailor just north of the Cheese Factory. Well the sun is going down behind the Gap and hiker midnight has arrived.","Blue Mtn campsite

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/273848,"Steel Trap Gap – Deep Gap Shelter- 5.6 milesThis was a relatively easy day not a 0 but easy. I wish I would have started at this pace and my knee most likely would have been fine, O well spilt milk. The weather started of sunny but clouded up during the day and is now misting rain, not to wory though cause we are in a shelter “who ray”. The shelter is quite an engineering marvel with its double Decker sleeping accommodations, nice porch, tables on three sides and an outside table that appears could support an engine block. It’s a really nice location with a close water source. The hike today was enjoyable with only one major up “Kelly Knob”. The sides of the trail in places were lined with deep green ferns that gave the appearance of a carpet lined runway and as an added bonus pink lady slippers graced our view. I must admit Josh was not as impressed with the lady slippers as I, but being a little older I am closer to pushing up flowers than Josh so I feel his judgment is a little jaded.   I called for a shuttle back to Goose Creek cabins as my knee is still on injured reserve but not as bad as yesterday so I should be able to come out for the third quarter this fall. I probably could hike 5 mile days but I don’t want to injure it where it won’t heal. So it is what it is. Upon arrival at the shelter we were greeted with a visible warning to all mice to curb there attacks. There was an example of what happens to them if they wander into unwanted areas. A 2 liter platypus water tank was a final resting place for our formidable friends. Seems he wander in and could not return to freedom. This I hope this serves as a warning to all mice’s to vacate the premises or they to might end up the same way. It was a gruesome way to end it all. I would have hated to be the hiker that left the top of his platypus open. Can you imagine waking up to a mouse drowning first thing in the AM? Tonight will tell if they heeded the warning. Travis from Ohio is joining us to night. He is a very courteous young man on spring brake from NC. He is rather tall which came in handy when placing my pack on a hanger out side. I guess you could say I was vertically challenged so he assisted. The person of interest is, you guest it machete man. He strolled in about 5:30 looked around and made a journal entry to the likes of, ate one squirrel and a hand full of snails. We were pleasant enough but I was relieved when he said he was heading into Hiawassee to find a job. Guess he was tired of snails. No fire tonight but we had a grand conversation till dark, then the mice were entertainment. I have a feeling the little critters will still run with reckless abandon tonight.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/274570,"Deep Gap Shelter – Dicks Creek 3.1 milesNot a bad night sleep as I was serenaded during the night with rain hitting the roof not to mention the acorns that tumbled down the ladder from the loft and knocked me out during the night. Seems as though the mice did not heed the warning and enjoyed hassling hikers during the night. Man there fast. There was only three at the shelter last night Josh, Travis and I. We all woke to fog and heavy mist but was spared the wet gear as we had a dry abode but we will soon be playing in the dirt as we hike down the trail. My knee is still sore but not as bad as yesterday and will most likely be fine if I do short miles but I made the call yesterday to get shuttled at Dicks Creek Gap. So I have my decision to call this my spring AT hike and will look forward with anticipation till I will once again ramble along in the woods. As I reflect on the hike so far, I have enjoyed Josh’s company as it is most always more enjoyable to share ones passion. I hope Josh’s experience on the AT was favorable to the extent that he will continue to amble occasionally on the long green trail and I hope he knows he is always welcome to accompany his old Unc. I won’t add so many rocks to his pack next time, hee hee. We departed the shelter rather late as I was not in a much of a hurry. The clouds were low in the mountains and every thing was so spooky quiet as the rain and mist seemed to absorb nature’s music. I think it was Powell Mtn that a little side trail veered to the right indicating a view from the top but not much could be seen, still inspirational none the less. We stopped at a couple streams to crack a few quarts rocks in hopes of striking it rich and financing our next great adventure but all we managed to do was to make gravel. We arrived at Dicks Creek around 1230 and took the ceremonial pictures around the rock signifying the section hikes end. It was a fitting setting for such an enjoyable hike. The ups, downs, good/bad food, friends made (machete man) flowers and fauna weather of all kinds, are all good and part of the experience. Keith Bailey was there to pick us up. We also shuttled a couple into the Hiawassee Inn. I inquired about a libations store so I could give the correct homage to the Three Amigos but it seems we are in a dry county. I will have to address my short comings with the amigos ring leader. Now its time for the person of interest, its fate I suppose that we see the infamous Machete man stacking tires at a gas station, I guess he got the job he needed to buy a few more supplies. This is another example of how the AT can transform a lost sole into a productive member of the community.

I guess I will have to see the doctor to see what can be done to get it back in hiking shape. I have been riding my bike every day up and down a ravine to toughen it up so it can’t be that bad. My nephew sent me an E-mail requesting my presents in the Smokies but I am a little reluctant to go considering my knee plus my boss indicated I am never at work. I guess the two week leave chit I submitted for September when I got back to work set him over the edge. I will be planning another trip to finish up the section to Winding Stair Gap in the near future most likely in September. I could most likely make it now if I did low miles. I keep on second guessing myself if I should of continued on from Dicks Creek Gap last week. O well, to late now. This will be my last journal entry till I start planning logistics for the next section. I hope this current journal was entertaining and depicted a true feeling for the trail and all of its ups and downs. I know I learn something about my self and my surrounding every time I go into the woods to ramble. I learned a couple of days ago a good friend of mine (53) had a hart attack and almost met his demise this just reinforced my conviction to retire as soon as possible and enjoy what God has given me. I hope to make more friends on the trail and set in place memories that will take me into the years that I can no longer hike.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/287553,"Well here we go again. I am starting to make preparations to hike from Fontana Dam to NOC with help from The Hike Inn on accommodations and shuttles. I am thankful I will be able to slack pack two days and only have to carry a full pack two more. It’s a toss up whether I am woosing out because my lovely bride is joining me or because of my un-cooperative knees. My lovely bride has consented to one overnight hike so we will day hike two days from Yellow Creek Gap to Fontana, Yellow Creek Gap to Stecoah Gap with an overnight at Sassafras Gap Shelter on our way to NOC from Stecoah Gap. I am so thankful for her ability to put up with all my aspirations. God has blessed me with a real soul mate for 38 years. I hope we never change our abilities to meet life’s challenges with a love of life and each other. This hike is only one of several we hope to make on our two week vacation. Most of the other hikes will be within the Smoky Mountains and Pisgah National Forest. Velva and I have completed almost a third of all the trails in the GSMNP but for me nothing compares to the AT. The stories of life’s yearnings and achievements abound around each curve in the trail. When you’re on the trail in the morning with the cool mist all around, you can almost feel the breath of early settlers following the same foot path across the Appalachians. Sorry I was drifting off to the land of bliss, I usually only do that when hiking. I have been nursing a woefully messed up knee and will get more cortizone shots before my hike. This I hope will allow me to keep up with my wife. With Gods good grace and a lot of medication I will once again be able to take in natures grandeur. I don’t need to add anything to our gear list as I have enough to outfit several hikers staged in a spare bed room of our house. Once again Velva has put up with my gear ego which manifest it self in over indulging in the REI catalog. So to all that read my journal, know this, the hiking bug that seeks its way into your being is not curable and needs to be fed at regular intervals to maintain a level of sanity that enables you to function in life.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/292026,"Well, it was the start of another great adventure but as always I had to be flexible on the itinerary I had planned on my excel spread sheet. I think I over planned the trip. Velva and I managed to log 56.4 miles of hiking in eleven days. I guess you could say we had ample time to smell the roses. The hikes were in various places, Pisgah NF, Nantahala AT, Joyce Kilmer, and the Smoky Mountains NP. I had planned a 30 mi section hike on the AT but as fate would have it we only did about 9 ½ miles. The story goes like this: Velva and I got to The Hike INN in Fontana about 11 AM and met Jeff and Nancy Hoch (most wonder full people and very helpful), got settled in and arranged for a shuttle to Yellow Creek Gap. We drove our Jeep to the visitor center at Fontana Dam and Nancy drove us to the Gap. Man was I excited to be back on the trail again and share the experiences with my wife. Little did I know this would not be a very good introduction to her inaugural AT hike. This was the same time all the flooding was going on and the weather was not the best, rain, rain, rain and greasy slick trail. Me being part goat (my wife refers to me as Old Goat) I did not see any problem however my wife was struggling for secure footing and occasionally would slip. I guess she slipped one to many times because she asked if I had a knee brace just after I noticed her limping. She was a trooper and I was proud of her tenacity but I knew she would not make it up to Cheoah Bald with out a lot of pain. We gimped into Fontana visitor center loaded up Sun Shine (Yellow Jeep) and went back to The Hike Inn to reevaluate our next hike. I decided to not do the next AT section but to hike Twentymile up to Shuckstack fire tower ( ½ mi on AT) which is a nice logging road with a gradual grade. Velva cringed a little on the length (11.4 mi) but I reassured her that the trail would be nice. Velva was always making fun of my trekking poles but after the episode with her the knee and a slick trail I made a believer out of her and we immediately got her a pair. She had to eat crow for the next week, guess I will lighten up on her now. We did get to hike a little more on the AT around Max Patch and what a grand view, from there you could see Mt Cammerer, Mt Sterling and Snowbird Mountain gosh I wish I was there now instead of journaling. We pretty much stayed in the GSMNP and did a few trails we had not done before. I am going to total up the Smoky miles someday but I’m sure is around a third. Velva’s knee is slowly getting better and were not sure if a Dr visit will be needed, now she’s found trekking poles. We had a fabulous two week vacation and are looking forward to the winter months in Florida so we can explore more on the Florida Trail and surrounding area around home. It will not be long before it will be time to start the logistics of the next AT spring hike and hopefully see the infamous Three Amigos and make a toast to good health, friends and the AT. Thanks for visiting my journal and sharing my hike. Photos to come.“Often your tasks will be many, and more than you think you can do...Often the road will be rugged and the hills insurmountable, too...But always remember, the hills ahead are never as steep as they seem, and with faith in your heart start upward and climb 'til you reach your dream.”","Yellow Creek Gap

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/295315,"Well its time again to start planning this year’s hike. I have been debating on starting a 2010 folder on trail journals but finally settled on just continuing the 2009 journal. I looked at other section hiker’s journals and see it’s been done both ways. I will take the easier way, which seems to be a no brainer since the days are posted. Well enough of that debate. I’ve been trying to stay in shape since Velva and I hiked in October, with biking most every day and the occasional day hike around the area state forests. I have logged about 450 bike miles since I got back in Oct, it seams to be keeping my knees in shape but I still have to wear a brace during the ride. I guess it will be that way till I get it fixed but for now I can still hike and that’s all that counts. As I once heard some say, it’s the smiles not the miles. Velva and I made January reservations in the Smoky Mountains for a week of day hiking. Can’t seem to convince her that it would be great to broaden her horizons and do some winter camping. This will be the third time hiking in January around the Smoky Mountains it always proves to be an adventure. Of course we will make the trek to Max Patch in Pisgah NF. We usually try to combine Cataloochee Elk viewing the same time as Max Patch but since I 40 is toast it will make it a lot harder to get around by vehicle. The Old Settlers Trail from Greenbrier to Maddron Bald will be a good choice for a bad weather hike as it low elevation provides some protection and its history makes it one of my favorite hikes. 
I sent off an E-Mail to The Hike Inn (Jeff and Nancy) for assistance in shuttling me on my next section hike. I most likely will try Winding Stair Gap to Fontana or Dicks Creek to Winding Stair Gap Haven’t decided yet but I will have to make up my mind soon as its getting closer all the time and logistics is always a challenging for a section hiker. The Three Amigos will be out on the trail this spring around Winding Stair Gap; hopefully their smiling faces will grace my camp site at the end of the day. Camp fire libations are always a treat with the Amigos.
I have been checking my gear and it hasn’t changed much since last fall, but I can always hope to acquire the latest gadget to reduce the weight a little. I really could save some weight by changing out my old Osprey Aether 60 to something around 3 lbs. I could save about a pound but it feels so secure and can handle extra weight if needed, like extra rocks and such. It’s always exciting to get started with the next step on the AT even if its small steps. Hopefully I can devote bigger chunks of time soon before the old age syndrome hits with its assorted aliments. I have to stop pondering on that old stuff and concentrate at the task at hand, enjoying the fellowship with fellow hikers and all of natures grander. 
Thanks for following along with the life & times according to a section hikers dream.","Home

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/296549,"Well it was a wonderful hike in the winter wonderland of the Smokies. There was plenty of snow, ice and cold mornings. We managed 5 good day hikes and two days stomping around the fields in Cades cove. My favorite hike was probably the section from Newfound Gap to Road Prong Trail. State road 441 was just opened and proved to be an adventure getting up to Newfound Gap. The park service did a commendable job on keeping it open. I would of like to have made it to Charlies Bunion but I knew my short legged bride would have never made it in one day, as it was; we were post holing in the snow to Road Prong trail. She was quite a trooper and we even managed to have a few snow ball fights when we were not building a two faced snow man. I must admit I had forgotten how hard it is hiking in knee deep snow even though I grew up in New Hampshire. Injune Creek, Rich Mountain Trail, Gabes Mountain Trail, Little Brier Gap and Cades Cove walking took up the rest of our vacation. We did make it to one waterfall (Hen Wallow Falls) and it was a grand view of ice and water although the trail was very icy. That reminds me that my wife made fun of me when I was putting hex head screws in my hiking boots. Lucky for her I had many extra for her boots. I was her hero after that little episode and never again will she question my woods wise abilities, Ya Right. While at the Falls some ice broke loose from the top of the falls and thundered to the bottom were it shattered into a hundred pieces. Good thing I moved from taking pictures, thanks Sweetheart for your incredible forethought. I think she likes me after 39 years. She also thinks I need to be constantly supervised but that is another story. I managed to try out some 4 season’s propane mix that works a whole lot better than alcohol. I make a mean hot chocolate with boil water (more whisky please). Last year I almost froze waiting for the water to boil with alcohol. We slept well and ate even better during the vacation as my home scale can attest too but O how good it was. That was the highlights and I can’t wait till I can make more memories to store away to be brought back from my gray matter to the front of my mind in the golden years of my life. I wish the small pleasures I get from watching a leaf fall from a tree or admiring a streams gentle song could always be with me but the stark reality of civilization brings me back to the asphalt with trains planes and automobiles. So till I can once again wonder in nature’s grander I’ll put on hold making more memories of mountain top vistas and long green trails.","Smoky Mountains

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/297072,"As I sit here in my little cubical with my Smoky Mountain trail maps under glass on my desk and the AT trail maps from Springer to Fontana placed so conveniently on my shelf I wonder if I will be so lucky to complete this section this year. O ya I forgot I have maps 15 through 18 of the Florida trail up there also, but I always seem to pull the AT maps down first when I try to express my enthusiasm when some one passes to close to my cubical. My wife always questions my sanity when I talk about “THE TRAIL”. I have persuaded her to read some of the posted journal form time to time and that just seems to reinforce her conviction that I am nuts. Its a wonder she hikes as much as she does with me, you know I think down deep in places she does not even know exist she wants to be a AT hiker also. I have tried to convincer to my way of thinking for 38 years of marriage and I bet in the next 38 I will succeed. Hummmm that will make me 97, you think by 97 if I succeed in convincing her she’s a super hiker it will mater? I hope so but I am a realist I think I need to do it in 37 years. Every once in a wile I catch someone looking at the assorted trail pictures on my desk, Springer, Smoky Mountains, Max Patch, Shenandoah, MT Washington or maybe Grayson Highlands ponies. That’s all it takes and I block there escape to further enlighten them on the trail highlights. It just seems so strange that everyone is not as enthused as I, don’t they know its fun to play in the dirt. One of my cubical inmates asked me for one of my magnets to hold some important paperwork he was working on. Of course it was “I’d rather be hiking the AT” magnet so that presented another opportunity to send him into an enlightened state of trailness. My day pack adorns a hook above my desk. The Sigg Bottle sits precariously close to the edge of my desk in the hopes that it my fall at the touch of a passer by’s hand which intern will allow me to further educate them on how to filter water from a slow running seep in the earth. Just because I wear a Grayson Highland State Park T shirt over my long sleeve smartwool base layer with an AT hat does not mean I am not conforming to our office dress code. Honest I will wear a collared shirt tomorrow. Did I mention that I have a wonderful screen saver? I’ll post it with the entry. The AT surrounds me in memorabilia and snap shots of my life in pictures. A picture will send me of to that place for a few minutes of sanity in an otherwise stressful day. Of course background music of Appalachian Rain always helps to. I guess what I am saying I miss being on the trail and I am not sure why. There is misery for sure in the hot bug infested nights if that is what you care to call it, but rest assured its better than charts and spread sheets, but it’s a means to an end and it allows me to finance several trips to play in the dirt. So, till I start another section hike in May my desk will have to tame the insensitive world of corporate America.","My Desk

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/297473,"Where to start, it seems most everything revolves around the AT as I count down to my next section hike in May. What ever I am doing at the time (planting trees in the yard, day hiking in Bayard, biking in the tour-d-Middleburg (my home town) or filling the bird feeders) I call it AT training. My lovely bride thinks I have totally lost it. I purchase a Surly Long-Haul-Trucker bike last fall and I have been riding it pretty regular. The odometer just clicked over 1000 miles ye-harrrrrrrrrrrrr. This got me to thinking. I bet I could do 50 miles a day pulling a small trailer with my AT pack and stuff. This took me further into the abyss of maybe shipping my bike somewhere up the trail doing my section then riding back home, kind of a modified flip flop or as my wife informed me maybe I just flipped. Another option would be to bike up to wherever I stopped my last section, store my bike, hike my hike, and hitch a ride back to my bike then ride home. No muss no fuss all wrapped up into a nice little package but alas I have one hurdle to over come before my master plan will work. Have enough time off from work to do all this. I guess this is when the Retirement word comes into play. This for me is the biggest obstacle to over come. I just don’t seem to have enough vision to JUST-DO-IT (thanks NIKE). I read journals where hikers have enough fortitude to break the apron strings of mother 9-to-5, I envy there adventurist intestinal fortitude, I wish I shared there vision. I know its coming soon but when is the key. I read the journal of Hammock Hanger’s and one of her famous sayings fit so nicely at this point “Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but to skid in sideways, totally worn out, shouting Holy Cow-What A Ride!” I just hope I don’t peek too soon with the worn out part before I finish playing in the dirt. I made another wind screen for my alcohol stove and practice making rice. My Bride even let me make some for supper one night. It didn’t get rave reviews but Chef Ramsey didn’t kick me out of the house yet. I blamed the alcohol stoves and the inability to simmer she seemed to think it had something to do with me not being able to boil water.Last weekend my bride and I hike in Bayard with our son and his girl friend. They seemed to enjoy themselves (it could have been the wine) and we loved the company. If they both show enough interest maybe I can get them to make the next step, a trip to Cumberland Island maybe. I don’t want to show them too much too soon or it might back fire on me. O well that might be another story in the making.","Home

We left our vehicle at Yellow Creek Gap and Nancy shuttled us to Stecoah Gap, this would be the only north bound section of the trip. I am not sure what the AT community feels abut going south because I have heard not so flattering things on occasion, but I pay that no mind as its about smiles not miles or direction. This slack pack was to be the first test for my newly cortisone knees and they passed the test with only minor aches and pain although I was only carrying 10 lbs. Croc indicates I look like Robo knee man because of the hardware on the knees. I must admit it looks a little much but I will do what it takes to play in the dirt. Tomorrow will be the true test as I will be carrying my full pack. The pack starts out about 27 pounds with 2, 1/2 liters of water. When I get down to the ½ liter its time to find a water source although I think I need to reevaluate the amount of water I carry. Weight is the single most thing that kills my knees. As of this hike every thing is fine and I am so thankful to be able to play in the dirt one more time. During the hike we took in some good vistas, bugs and squirrels. We finally arrived at Yellow Creek Gap about 3PM and went to Fontana Lodge to get some good food then back to The Hike Inn to sit on the porch and swap tall tails with other like minded hikers. The Front porch crew included Pace & Chase a farther and daughter, Wild flower 62 year young lady recently laid of from work passing time hiking till employment improves and a teacher husband (68 years young) and wife team all from Maine. What a coincident as I am from NH and spent a good part of my life in Maine also. As I talked to Pace and Chase about the Maine woods we have covered some of the same ground and Croc tells me my accent is coming back to the extent it’s hard for him to understand me. I tell him its code for real hikers and he should aspire to obtain the same level of hikerness. O.K., I am stretching it a little but that’s what I was thinking, honest. As we all talk about past hiker history the time passes quickly and hiker midnight approaches all to fast, so we all shake hands, bid each other good night and retire to our rooms to dream about future vistas on the long green trail.

The hands on my watch are moving backwards though. I wonder what that means. Isn’t life grand, I am sitting on Cheoah Bald looking out on some the most beautiful views. The camera is worn out from all the photos but I know pictures won’t do it justice but what it will do is spark a memory when I look at it many years from now when my body will no longer carry me to vistas like this. Made a call to my lovely bride of 38 years to let her know the knees have not given up the ghost yet. This is where I gave Josh the name of Croc as he has hiked in his Crocs the entire time. I can remember him as a child and he never did like shoes. Every time I see him running down a rock infested trail I just cringe but I am also quite envious on the endurance of his feet. I guess the age of 22 has something to do with it, so the “Croc” trail name begins and works quite well as he will graduate this year from UF in Gainesville Fl. “Gator” kin to a Croc. We made it to Sassafras Shelter just before the evening rain started and we were fortunate as we claimed our corner spot for the night before 7 others arrived. The shelter is a double decker and can accommodate 12, more in a pinch depending on the weather. There was some interesting conversations going on and it proved to be a very entertaining night. Of course I supplied some of the entertainment when I got my Nalgene Bottle hung in a tree trying to sling a rope over a tree branch to hang the food. We got it back thanks to the two young guys from Wisconsin. I won’t call them “dumb asses” any more, “70 Show” slang. There is many conversations going at one time and it’s interesting to sit back and reflect. I made an observation that there is a line being drawn in the sand with the over 60 and under 25 as there is no in-between. The conversation had to do with outsmarting the Police department and I will leave it at that. Well the noise is slowly waning and hiker midnight is fast approaching. I know the noise will start up again so ear plug are a must but nothing will keep the walls of the shelter from resonating. Maybe the mice will take deep shelter and not bother us tonight, only time will tell.The food bag is hung in a tree with care as I sleep in the shelter with mice with no hair.Pockets","Stecoah Gap

I started with the birds singing their cheerful wake up call at Sassafras Shelter, I am surprised I can hear them over the walls resonating from all the tired hikers. I was not the first to rise as Smiley was ready to travel before my feet hit the shelter floor. Smiley was an elderly gentleman from Denmark with a very pleasant personality. He came over and shook my hand and we bid each other happy trails as we were heading in opposite directions. Croc started stirring as the aroma of coffee brought him back to the living. We did our morning duties and were on the trail by 0745. The trail started down hill and remained that way for 6 miles to NOC, the knees were stressed but not broken. We passed several vistas one in particular stood out, Nantahala overlook was just inspiring, made me want to sing the sound of music but of course I didn’t, I was considerate of my fellow hikers. The visions of hamburgers started looming in my head the closer we got to NOC, you would of thought I had been starved for days but this was only three days on the trail, go figure. I did however suppress my cravings till we resupplied from my vehicle that I left at NOC base camp parking. It was hard to place more freeze dried food in the food bag knowing the hamburger was just down the road. Croc and I nearly flew down to the Rivers End Restaurant where the smells placed me into a state similar to a drunken stupor. Hamburgers, pizzas and beer were on the agenda and finally my demeanor returned to the mild mannered hiker that I am. We did encounter an entertaining hiker that was hiking the Eastern Continental Trail sorry I can't remember his trail name but I do remember he was quite intense and had the gift of gab.   I had promised Jeff and Nancy from The Hike Inn that I would call them when we reached NOC and set up a shuttle for Winding Stair Gap. This completed, our bellies full, resupply and a ½ a pizza to take to the next shelter the trek continued. Rufus Morgan Shelter was only about a mile up the trail and that was a good thing as I think I was waddling from all the food I had ate. The food must have hit a high level sleep switch in my belly because I was really sleepy and the floor of the shelter did not feel as hard as usual. We did our usual camp duties and of course ate some more. We were the only ones at the shelter that night which made for a snore free zone. Checked in with my lovely bride to tell her we made it to NOC and were continuing on to Winding Stair Gap. Hiker Midnight came earlier than usual as my belly was full and the quiet of the night seemed so inviting to enter a blissful night’s sleep.

Croc and I performed our usual shelter duties and were on the trail by 0800. The hike out of Nantahala Gorge was a test for my knees as the day's hike was about 8 miles up and 1mile down. The labor of going up is kind of refreshing and definitely gives you a sense of accomplishment even though I could not keep up with Croc try as I may. Croc would take off up the mountain, get a good distance ahead and wait for me to catch up. I told him that this is what I did to my beautiful bride when we hike together. He can sure fly up the trail, it must be the no shoe thing or maybe 22 years young is the primary factor, what ever it is I cant match his speed but what I can do is see things that he might over look. Over the course of the day combined we pumped over 8 liters of water and my T shirt can attest to the fact that I am sweating it out. I have rinsed it out at every opportunity and the white salt stains still reappear along with the smell that I am becoming accustomed to. The weather today and for that fact the whole trip thus far has been just perfect, cool in the morning and warm in the afternoon. I could stand it to be a little cooler but overall not bad. Heck, what comes is what we get and I am in the woods playing in the dirt and happiness is with me hiking no mater what the weather or terrain. We planned on a dry camp tonight at Rocky Bald so we filled up with water and an extra 2 liters for incidentals. We made it to Rock Bald around 1700 and found a wonderful camp site hidden in a rhododendron thicket only 25 feet from the Rock Bald this is no doubt one of my top 5 camp sites ever. I am so glad all the moons aligned that we chose this site to call home for the night. This was our first night tenting and it’s a most grand veranda. We could see for ever, the blues in the mountain ranges seem to blend into infinity coupled with the rainbow of colors painting the eastern sky, if only I could acquire the ability to capture the view on camera and do it justice. The sun rise tomorrow promises to be just a spectacular. We are now having our evening meal (4 serving of mountain house) on the veranda, a small camp fire cast an orange glow in the darkness of the rhododendron covered camp and a faint rumble is heard off in the far distance as the days heat dissipates. Can simple life get any better than this? I know in the single moment in time here Croc and I could solve all the worlds’ problems or just maybe at this time and place they just don’t mater. I some time feel slightly embarrassed that I should have this much enjoyment and sense of peace when there is so much hate and misery in the world. Man this is getting deep but I guess it happens when your mind is not cluttered with worldly stuff constantly. Croc is now enjoying the paintings on the inside of his eye lids and I am trying to stay on the veranda for as long as possible to bathe in natures grandeur. I can see rain falling on my left and the sun slowly fading on my right as a multi colored butter fly tries to maintain head way on the gentle breeze crossing the bald. In camp, nature has blessed us with one of life’s small rewards that occasionally comes our way. I was fortunate to share this site with my nephew today and show him its fun to play in the dirt. Life is good tonight and I hope tomorrow brings more blessings. Night VelPockets","Rufus Morgan Shelter

I guess there is magic in them thar hills. This was not going to be our last day hiking but the forces came to bare with rain, hail, and some how missing our evening camp site at Wine Spring / Bartram Trail, I guess in our haste to beat the incoming weather we missed it, so what was going to be a easy 10 miles turned out to be a very fast 19. The old knees held up well and I even felt as though I could have continued on for a few more miles, go figure, must be mountain magic. The vistas we passed throughout the day were impressive to say the least, row after row of blue gray mountain ranges with mountain laurel, flaming azaleas and rhododendron framing the picture. We did however have some excitement during our day’s adventure, as we started down the south side of Wayah Bald past Wine Spring the sky let loose with rain and hail, the temperature dropped significantly. Now along with my soaked hiking attire I knew I had to keep up a good head of steam to stay in my comfort zone. On the way down from Wine Spring I did however have to stop for a few minutes to admire about 20 or so yellow lady slippers. This was the first time I had ever seen them and in the poring down rain they were a true marvel of nature’s glory just sparkling and dancing around from the wind, rain and hail. My only regret is I did not get a picture of them because of the rain, I should have taken the chance with the camera and got the shot but I know where they are and I will be back some time in the future. I continued on with a fast pace to warm up, I knew I would not see Croc again until he either found a good camp site or Siler Bald shelter. The shelter it was and I rolled in about 1630, cold, wet and hungry, to my immense pleasure Croc had chicken and rice with hot tea all set up and ready to engulf. What a guy, I wish I could take some credit for his culinary skills but I will reap the benefits, thanks Croc. After a good meal and warming up a bit I felt almost super human so after corroborating with Croc I called Jeff and Nancy to see if a shuttle and a room would be possible tonight. All was a go for a shuttle from Winding Stair Gap, the only thing was we had to be there between 1830 and 1900. Its now 1700 and I would have to keep a pace better than 2 miles and hr, this for an old man is quite fast, luckily it was most down hill. Off we go and Croc is edging ahead, try as I may he keeps increasing distance, I final settle in to a good pace and feeling good with the thoughts of another hamburger at River Edge Restaurant. It was just about 1830 when I arrived at the creek just before Winding Stair Gap parking lot where Croc had a photo op set up and we took the ending trip photo. We continued on to the parking lot were we met up with Sunset and shared our celebration drink of crown (supplied by The Three Amigos). This was a fantastic end to the section hike and I am already thinking on the logistics for the next, but for now I will bask in the accomplishments of this trip. So till I once again can play in the dirt, I bid all my fellow hikers clear springs and soft level trails on their Katahdin quest.","Rocky Bald

It’s so good to be back in the action instead of taking a siesta after an exhilarating climb to a mountain top with views that go on forever and fresh air that almost screams life. As things progress in the evolution of Corporate America the trail seams to be a mental retreat that has a soothing effect and can be reflected up on in times of need. I guess playing in the dirt maybe a way to revert back to simpler times in ones life that required far less brain cells thus reaching that state of utopia that we all strive to obtain. I have often wondered what demeanor the standard hiker might possess and I think if I had to categorize one, my self included it would go something like this, mild mannered, willing to help any one, strong sense of self, not engrossed in appearance, goal orientated and a charm that includes playing in the dirt. I hope I have not offended anyone, this is just one hikers opinion and if I might say so it’s quite flattering, I did just write it. HEEEEHEEEE. As I reflect on my most recent section hike I am just so thankful for all the support that volunteers give to the trail that allows us to live out a dream that could not otherwise be possible, even the businesses that are there to accommodate smelly hikers continually go the extra step to ensure the most smallest hiker need is met. I am sure there are exceptions to the general kindness of the hiker community but I have not witnessed it yet. I was telling Sunset I have never met anyone on the trail that I did not like although I have met a couple that might have made me a little uneasy but I still did not dislike them. We all have our own uniqueness that’s what makes the trail so inviting, whether it’s planning a re-route or hiking your own hike, diversity is the key.The wife and I are in the planning stages for a two week vacation in October that will include hopefully many miles of hiking adventures. One week is already scheduled for the Smoky Mountains and the other week is in planning, possibly Little Lyford Pond Camps in Maine to explore the Gulf Hagas. What ever we do I will have the company of my lovely bride and its always exciting to share our experiences together.

I am now scheduled for a super duper dye injected stress test. I was told my dilemma could be caused by a blockage among other things. I can’t understand it I have been riding my bike up to 35 miles every other day in preparation for our two week vacation starting October. How can one have a heart problem cycling 35 miles in 95 degree heat? One good thing is my knees seem to be holding up to the bike riding. Both Velva and I seem to be getting stronger in endurance and leg strength. Velva hurt her knee coming down into Fontana from Yellow Creek Gap last October and has been working on strengthening that area ever since. She is truly amazing. I have just completed our two week itinerary for our upcoming vacation and I am really excited about the adventure. It took me 2 months of trying to get a reservation at Mt Leconte lodge. I finally got them (someone canceled) Woo Who. I love hiking the Boulevard trail off the A.T.; we go almost to Ice water Spring Shelter then hang a left to Leconte. The crew at Mt Leconte always makes you feel at home and they keep the wine glass full at supper. This can be a problem after supper trying to make it up to Cliff Top to watch the sun set. We also have reservations at Len Foote Hike Inn in Amicalola Falls. As you can see this is a lazy way of hiking but it’s O’so nice to the belly and bed is always softer than a Therm-a-rest. Then it’s off to Pisgah Inn, Grayson Highlands and a week, day hiking in the Smokies. We are running out of trails to hike in the Smokies that we haven’t done 2 or 3 time without staying out overnight. I am hoping, maybe, I will be able to talk her into Hazel Creek or Lakeshore trail but whatever we do we will be together and enjoying each other’s company. I still plan on doing my section hike this spring and God willing pick up where I left off the following year for a long awaited reunion with Katahdin. I don’t need all the planets to align, just a few, to realize one of those life goals completed and a chapter closed in the big scheme of things. Life keeps on placing obstacles in the way to test my resolve but when I do spend time playing in the dirt it’s that much sweeter. The mystical powers of nature reveal themselves and a calming sense of self is realized when on the trail. It’s this allure that keeps the yearning alive to see what’s around the next curve in long green tunnel or mountain vista. Imagine life’s decompression when you finally reach Cheoah Bald and take in the sights, smells and sounds of all that surrounds you. I guess this is what you call day dreaming of hikes past. I only hope life allows me to keep making memories and enjoy the journey to that place of calmness that the trail seems to preside over. It’s strange how the trail seems to change ones bearing if you let it; it’s a free gift to all that enter into, one foot after another, head down with pack on the back holding all ones basic possessions. No truer feelings expose themselves than long distance hikers playing the emotional rollercoaster ride. Just feel the passion oozing out on some of the journal entries. I say to myself what keeps these wanderlust soles trudging along in searing heat, freezing cold, fording rivers and bug infested woods. It has to be many things, different to all individuals, no one thing or component can be the cement that binds them all in the passion of making that next mile or taking that short brake on that hard rock except THE TRAIL. The Trail is the one thing that serves as the common bond no matter if prince or pauper. I guess I got a little carried away as I was only going to make an entry about our upcoming trip to the woods. Thanks for reading the ranting of a hiker that’s getting a little long in the tooth and a little short on gray matter but still possesses the passion for the trail. This form of gibbering might also been caused by withdrawal symptoms. It’s been since May that I have been able to play in the dirt and that’s a long time.

The hikes in the Smokies, Pisgah, Chattahoochee, and Grayson Highlands renewed my spirit but now the ebb tide has begun and I feel the pain. I will try to maintain my health and well being with area hikes and bike rides till once again I can enjoy the heat, cold, lumpy ground and freeze dried food enjoying the long green tunnel. It was sure a joy to share time with my lovely bride enjoying what we both have a passion for. We hiked every day except the ride up and back and logged around 80 miles. I know that’s not much for two weeks but the views and noon day naps hindered the miles. Hiking for two or three miles then putting up hammocks to enjoy the vistas, read a book and partake of a few libations is living the hi-life. I guess you could call that “smelling the roses”. Although we did not make it to Max Patch the ponies in Mt Rogers/Grayson made up for it. One of the ponies just south of Thomas Knob shelter helped himself to an apple in the side pocket of my pack as I was trying to get my camera gear out for pictures. We also met a south bounder with a dog that followed him from Troutdale, very friendly dog and caring hiker. Made a stop at Mountain Crossings on our way south and could not pass up a sale on the ULA circuit Pack which will reduce my base weight by over a pound and I got to show my wife where I pigged out on several hotdogs when I passed through as a smelly hiker. My wife got introduced to Pirate made famous by Winton Porter’s book “Just Passing Thru”. Pirate is no doubt a man with many trail stories to tell and underneath the exterior, a hiker with astute character. The stay at Mt Leconte is always a success and proved to be one of the highlights of the trip (must have been the never empty glass of wine) it snowed two days after our hike down (so sad we missed it). Cat Ziller at The Hike Inn (Fontana) proved to provide entertainment for our stay there. It seems my wife needs to pet dogs or cats every so often or she has animal withdrawals. We also had a nice stay at Len foot Hike Inn (Amicalola), the trail was easy and the food was good. We spent a day at Mt Pisgah, the highlight of that episode is a storm came through and the wind howled all night with a temp drop that made me bring out the woolies. Then of course 7 days in the Smokies doing as many trail as our legs would take us. It’s so strange that the town and roads are jam-packed and the trails are almost empty. I am not complaining but it’s a shame most people don’t know the beauty of nature vice Dolly Wood. Well it’s time to start thinking of the trail and prepare to complete a little more of the life’s goals this spring. I have been given the go-ahead by my lovely bride to pursue it. She has been my rock for almost 40 years and it never ceases to amaze me that she has put up with me that long. Thanks Vel","Home

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/334087,"2011 AT hiking plan has begun and I’m up for the challenge. First things first though, Januarys trip to the Smokies will have to come first and promises to be chilly but rewarding. My lovely bride always complains about taking a Florida girl into snow and ice conditions but you should see her go when she gets good traction. I am not sure but I think Santa heard somewhere Velva wanted some micro spikes for Christmas. I remember once going to Charlies Bunion in January and we should have brought ice skates, the trail was that bad. We made it, but could have been a recipe for disaster. Winter hiking views are the best and bushwhacking is the best way to get there. Stone walls appear where you never seen them before and old artifacts reveal themselves to tell a story of years past. Old Mike Maples would be proud of us; this is another story involving a local hiker that shared his history lesson in the field. You meet the best people on the trail. We will only be there for a week this time so I hope the weather cooperates. Cades cove and Cataloochee is a must this trip, the Deer and Elk picture opportunities abound and the area is rich in history Fun, Fun, Fun. I am fast approaching 60, so the pressure is on to capture as much of what nature has to offer in the remaining 40 or so years. Pictures seem to be the media that sparks the memory and will have to be relied on in the years ahead when the legs will no longer carry Vel and me to sunny bald and moist green creek bottoms.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/335919,"The Smokies proved to be a wonderful winter hike. We hike every day that we were not driving. I dislike driving very much but the solitude of winter hiking was the carrot hanging in front of me. I must say, the bushwhack up to courthouse rock was the most adventuress. My lovely bride being vertically challenged had to be helped over some blow downs but the effort was well worth the prize. The hike would have never been possible without the help from Randy and Carol Bradley. Their lineage goes far back into the Smoky mountain heritage which proved to be a help in their guiding ability to the infamous rock. You know you’re having fun when the only tracks you see is bear tracks. They just had wilderness week but I don’t think anyone made it up there. Thanks Randy and Carol hope we can do it again. The friends you make while hiking is indeed one of the reasons I love playing in the dirt. The scariest was Alum Cave Trail, the trail was super and the crampons proved to be indispensable but the ton of ice that fell from the roof of the cave was a little much. I guess it’s just the hazards of winter hiking. I will use a little more gray matter next time when the temp gets above freezing. Abrams, Grotto, and Rainbow falls also captured our attention when they flaunted their winter enchantment. The road to the Grotto Falls trail head was closed so we were blessed with yet another hike of solitude and seeing only animal tracks in the snow. The hike up Trillium Gap trail from Rainbow was a special treat as we had never walked that part. It parallels the Roaring Fork Motor trail and gave us a different perspective on what we had driven in the fall. We seem to always visit the Walker Sisters Cabin and have tea and coffee on the front porch. I drift off to day time dreaming for a short while just thinking about the hardship of everyday living on that small farm. I guess for the seven sisters it was not hardship just living life simple and basic. Use it up wear it out or do without I believe was their saying. On our hike to Abrams Falls we had to go around Cades Cove and I was able to get a good photo of a coyote in mid air trying to capture a mouse. Nature sure is full of surprises. That was about all the trails we accomplished but not all we wanted to. So many trail so little time. We tried to make it to Mount Collins Shelter but it was too cold (12), windy (20), deep snow (1000ft???)I think and I did not want to enjoy the misery that much. I will hopefully see the shelter this spring if the permit situation goes well. I have been making arrangements with Curtis Owen from the Standing Bear Farm he has been most helpful. I hope it all comes together and it usually does. O the wows of a section hikers logistics. Don’t pay any attention to the whining it’s all good. Our next trip will be in April to see spring come alive then in May my section hike of the AT. Life is good.Pockets","Smoky Mountains

I work in an office with 10 other Quality Assurance Specialist that are a good group of guys and fun to work with. We are always cutting up which makes a stressful job a little less at the end of the day. We had a mouse running around terrorizing our snack supply in the office and for a month afterwards there were rubber mice and rats appearing all over the place at the most inopportune times (reminded me of mice in Deep Gap Shelter). Their always attentive when I tell stories of hiking but they think I am a little of my rocker for hiking the AT and playing in the dirt at my age which I don’t think I am old just seasoned. Whenever anyone goes on a work trip or vacation a trinket is acquired to commemorate journey and to show that they were really at the assigned place. I always seem to come up with 10 small rocks and adorn them with the date, place, and a painted landscape of the area. I have been doing this for several years so some of the more gray headed and long in the tooth guys have 10 or so painted rocks. This January I went to the Smokies to hike and told a story of going to Alums Cave and having a ton of ice fall from the top of the cave. The ice missed the wife and me by about 20 feet and made a noise that I will not forget anytime soon as it slid down the rock face and hit the ground, well I think some in the group jazzed up the story and posted a not so flattering fake news paper clipping that went something like this; “***BREAKING NEWS, SMOKY MOUNTAINS NC*** Big Foot has finally been caught. Dennis C. of Jacksonville Fl, and avid hiker and rock artist was hiking deep in the Smoky Mountains when he came upon a previously undiscovered cave. Mr. C. entered the cave and discovered Mrs. Big Foot. Mr. Big Foot was out gathering food for the week. Knowing this Mr. C. became amorous with Mrs. Big Foot. Mr. Big Foot stubbed his big toe and returned home early to find Mr. C and Mrs. Big Foot in a compromising embrace. Mr. C. has not been seen since. Mr. C’s rock art has reportedly skyrocketed in value. One owner, Butch C. stated “I miss Dennis but he became my lottery. Thanks to Dennis I sold my rocks and was finally able to retire. I just wish he had found Mrs. Big Foot sooner””This of course is false; everyone knows Big Foot’s wife resides in Springer Mt Shelter not Alum Cave. I will have to find the News Journalist and set the record straight. I hope all you hikers find this as entertaining as I did and it’s not to offensive.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345214,"Well, it was another thrilling week in the woods day hiking with my lovely bride. It was a trade off for my section hike the end of May without her. I would much rather share all the experiences (degrees of misery and joys of triumph) section hiking with her but she is content doing what she likes and I cherish those times of sleeping the afternoon away in a hammock at Andrews Bald or seeing how many animals we can see in the clouds at Max Patch. We managed to find a short trail in the middle of all the hubbub at Easter. Baskins Creek trail is such a jewel; we were the only ones at the falls for hours when all the surrounding trails were packed. The hike to Leconte Lodge was a sweet success and as always the food, wine, company and crew were instrumental in making memories that will last a lifetime. That was our 14th time visiting the centerpiece of the GSMNP; gosh the smells of spruce and fir bring memories of my childhood in Maine and New Hampshire. Memories, memories I could sit here and dream of times past when thing were so simple and life’s trials and tribulations were so small, old dogs (Tippy and Rags) sunning themselves, my brothers and I laying under an apple tree eating green apples with the smells of blueberry pie cooling next to the window sill knowing if I took a bite Mom would take a switch to my derriere. Back to reality, met one thru hiker at Max Patch trail name Dreamer said he needed to average 20 miles a day to finish before school started. Katahdin, treat this young man gentle as he will be slightly worn out when he arrives at your forested feet. Also met a 2001 thru hiker at Mount Leconte Shelter that go’s by Following (Dave) his wife is named Leading. What a nice guy and the stories he had to tell. He was of my error, 60 ish so we not only had the trail to talk about but things like Roy Rogers and such. We had to make our pilgrimage to Max Patch, Cataloochee, Andrews Bald and a side trip to Standing Bear farm to make arrangements for my next section hike ( thanks Curtis). What a grand time we had seeing the Elk and admiring the views on the Balds not to mention the wine and the hammocks. Tromped around Cades Cove for a day and why yes I did find a yellow lady slipper that had not been viewed to death. Well that about sums up the trip. I did manage to secure permits from Mount Collins Shelter to Davenport Gap so that will be the next adventure providing the knees hold up. I got to suck it up and get them worked on soon, before next spring. Hope to make more memories on the trail soon.","Home

There are a zillion other things but what the hay it’s a minor inconvenience when compared to the rewards. I wish I had more than a week to hike the trail but it is what it is. I just hope old father time allows me a few more years of health so I can enjoy playing in the dirt and making memories. May 22 through the 29th is the time I have allotted to drive up, back and go from Mt Collins shelter to Standing Bear Farm. I know it’s a little slow but did not know how the knees would hold up so I decided to hit every shelter. I bet I will be tired of mice buy the end of my trip. I am going to bring my tent just in case I can’t squeeze into the shelter; I never was real keen on asking someone to move. My Pack is at 27 lbs with food and 64 oz of water. The last few days I have been hiking the flat ground of Florida with a full pack and boy, am I tired and sore. I just didn’t remember the difference between a day pack and a 5 day pack. I hope the mountains still have their mystical healing power because I am out of shape when it comes to elevation gain. My nephew (“Crock” that hike with me 2009 and 2010) could not make it this year I guess the responsibilities of life are catching up with him. I will sorely miss his conversation and companionship but I hope I will grow new friendships on the trail. I still e-mail “The Three Amigos” from 2008 a good bunch of guys. You sure meet some fine people on the trail. 4 years section hiking seems as though I should be farther along than this but I need to stay focused. The reason I started hike in the first place was because I really enjoyed the hiker camaraderie and nature and I have not been disappointed yet, so I guess its smiles not miles really fits for me or so I am telling myself. Every once in a while the completive side shouts out, when are you going to stop messing around and finish this trail so we can try other trails? I think the we in that sentence is my ego. So I will try to keep my ego under control and enjoy what I have in the time I am given. Don’t want to wish my life away but retirement needs to come soon.

The plan was to get the shuttle around 1400 but I arrived early and Curtis’s son was ready and raring to go, I could hardily wait. I just hope the enthusiasm never leaves me. The conversation was interesting on the shuttle up to Clingmans parking lot, Curtis son is a good ambassador for his father’s business. He dropped me off at about 1200 which left me more than ample time to make it to Mt Collins Shelter. 5 miles in 8 hr, I should be able to keep up that pace. The hike up the paved trail to the dome proved to be interesting to say the least, I felt like a tourist attraction. I bet I got stopped 20 times in that ½ mile to discuss if I was hiking or just bring a big lunch to the dome. If I wasn’t just starting I could have filled my food bag at least twice from the well doers. I will have to remember this for future use. The views from the dome were fantastic but I did not stay long as the trail was calling. The trail was a rocky downhill right of the bat and my knees were talking to me. My Knees and I will surely have many more conversations before this section hike is over. A couple well placed breaks and a few stretches put me well in control over the uncooperative ratty old joints. I arrived at the shelter around 1700 and found Caleb (Ridge Runner) sleeping, he woke when I arrived and we had a good conversation. Nice young man, hope he follows his instincts for his future employment. I have a sneaking suspicion whatever his calling the outdoors will always be a part of it. I did my assorted chores and before you know it, darkness was coming on strong. I was hoping for a bear encounter as there was a bear trap beside the shelter and signs, warning of aggressive activity. The table out front had a chunk missing out of it with claw and teeth marks surrounding the missing piece. By dark we had two more hikers arrive so we were 4 strong for the night, more than enough to make quite a commotion if need be. It feels good to be playing in the dirt. Hiker midnight has arrived, ear plugs in, head light next to my sleeping bag, food bag/pack hung on the bear cables and ample rocks for fire power piled within easy reach to be used if our furry friend arrives during the night and wants to eat my headlight.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/349630,"I really expected a visit from Mr. Bear last night but no luck. According to the past journals he had made frequent trips to Mt Collins Shelter. I didn’t think I had the funk already, enough to keep bears away. The morning started out with the usual bird serenade. I remember my lovely bride asking me when you will get up, my response is always when the birds tell me to, which is normally about 30 min before sunrise. The water situation was good enough to make it to the next source about 3 miles away at Indian Gap, so I packed up my gear and headed toward New Found Gap (NFG). Caleb accompanied me to NFG and I was pleasantly surprise since I knew he could walk a lot faster than I, I think he just wanted to keep an eye on me to make sure I was up to the task. The conversation once again was always upbeat and interesting. When we neared NFG we saw what appeared to be a search and rescue team repelling down a steep embankment. When asked what was up we were informed that they are searching for an individual that had been missing for a while. His car was at NFG and they think he took his life with a gun and was trying to recover his body. So sad that we as humans can get in such a state that we want to end it, when there is so much goodness to be had in the world if you only look for it. It was only a short distance to NFG from there and the tourist thing started again. I tried to look as pitiful as I could which is not hard when your 60 and only 135 lbs. Well it worked and the food started coming. I only ate some donuts and departed for Icewater springs Shelter. I wanted to know if you really could Yogi Food at good locations. The answer is yes. This lesson will be filed into the memory banks for further reference. It wasn’t long before I was at the junction with the Boulevard trail. This is a trail Velva and I had hiked several times before to Mt Leconte. I had contemplated going to the Jump Off just a short distance up the trail but I thought better of it and headed to the shelter. I arrived at 1300 which means I only have 7 and ½ hours to hiker midnight. Note to self I need to pace myself to arrive at the shelter without so much time to kill. I was told by Caleb that this is by far the best shelter as view go on this side of the Smokies. I did some chores like sweeping the shelter (found 50 cents), getting water, eating lunch, reading past journals, talking to day hikers going and coming from Charlies Bunion and taking a nap in the sun. O my, this is grand. I wish every day could be like this. I guess this is what the phrase,” smelling the roses” is all about. I tried to call Velva but I could only text. I took a lovely picture and sent it along with the text. Time passed quickly and hikers started to roll in. There were a total of 7 of us there tonight and this was the first of many times I would see Mike, Joel, Steve and John. They were a good group of young men and one not so young (like me) sorry Mike. A camp fire was started; it was comforting but would have been a bigger hit if I had hotdogs and marshmallows. O well I will remember next time. The sun has set and the camp fire is just a glow of embers as I lay here in my sleeping bag finishing up the journal. The snozzzzzzzzing has started, my ear plugs will be a welcome addition to my sleeping attire tonight. Good night to all. I will dream of playing in the dirt tonight.","Mt Collins Shelter

I just laid in my sleeping bag for a few more minutes taking in the all that surrounds me, birds, view, light breeze through the trees and yes the occasional snoring of the other hikers. I hated to get up and start rumbling around because I know I will disturb someone no matter how quite I try to be. O, I just remembered I found 50 cents on the trail and placed them in a different spot. The change would be a topic of discussion for the next couple of days because it would keep showing up on the trail. I started to do my usual chores at 0615 being as quiet as possible. I was on the trail at 0715 and headed toward Charlies Bunion. I took several pictures at the Bunion and debated on whether to stay and wait for the other so I could get a good photo of myself hanging over the cliff but I heard this little voice (Velva my wife) saying “you old fool you need to be watched all the time just like a little kid” so with that still ringing in my ears I took a photo of my shadow and quickly scurried along like a old dog with his tail between his legs. The ridge walking was close to an out of body experience; views seem to go on forever ,mountain on top of mountains blues, purples, orange ,pinks and several shades in-between were painting the landscape. If only the pictures I took would capture the essences I was feeling and how honored I was to be blessed to view such splendor. Its days like this that I put in my pocket and save for 6 miles up hill on a rainy day in 6 inches of mud experience. It makes them days a lot easier. I got to Porters Gap and witnessed the sheer magnitude of effort it took to build the trail. The ravines between the ups were filled in with earthen bridges lined on the sides with some amazing stone work. I think it was some of the CCC work but I am not sure. Bradley’s view was for sure a highlight; it reminded me of a rock fortress. I spread out my Z rest and had lunch and tried to take a snooze but I could not keep my eyes close for the grandeur that was surrounding me. Why I did not stay longer than I did is beyond me but move I did and 1.5 mile further found me at Pecks Corner Shelter at 1230. This shelter was nestled in a some trees on a slope that continued down to a spring. Since I arrived so early I had plenty of time to sweep the shelter (found a dime and a penny), read the journal, get water, rinse out some bandanas, eat some more lunch, pan for gold, and hook up the microwave for popcorn. You get the picture, I had a lot of extra time but truly it did pass pretty fast. It was about 1 ½ hours before the “fantastic four” (TV Show) showed up and I had someone to talk to then shortly after that another 4 showed up father, daughter, son, and son-in-law. One more showed up later which made for close to a full house. All were good people and conversation was not a problem. Tried to call Velva but no phone service. As it started to get dark the temp dropped but not as much as last night which was comfortable sleeping. The knees were acting up by not too bad, I take one vitamin I in the morning and it keeps it under control till about 1400 then if the boards seem to hard on the hips (side sleeper) I will take a Tylenol but not always.

I only have 5.6 miles to go for the whole day. When I made reservation through the backcountry office I did not know how the knees would act so consequently I hit every shelter except Davenport Gap. I knew the pull of restaurant food would be good for a few extra miles so I bypassed Davenport. I performed my morning duties and was on my way .4 miles uphill to the trail around 0830. The morning was cool and damp which made my demeanor kind of mellow. I walked kind of slow (slower than usual) and let my mind kind of drift. A good day for reflecting on one’s life. The Trillium has mostly gone by, but its place has been taken up by a plethora of shades of green. The evergreen bow tips are almost florescent green with shades of purple. How wonderful this makes the vistas framed with the shades of greens. Alone with my thoughts I think of my parents and think of how wonderful it would have been to have them see with my eyes on this trip. My dad legally blind all his life never was able to experience the magnificence of what I have seen, then I thought just maybe he is seeing through my eyes now, and that made me feel happy. My mother would have loved this as she told me stories of keep the beans hot at camp during family logging operations in northern Maine and all the beauty that she experienced seeing nature’s granger during that time as a child. All this day dreaming was taking place as I closed in on my mountain (Mt Chapman) not smashing good views but formidable in height 6,417 feet. I was brought out of my melancholy as I summit my mountain and heard a distant roll of thunder. I was only a mile away from the shelter so I felt confident I could muster a little speed out of my squeaky old knees. Really my knee braces squeak some times. Well I made it by 1545 with plenty of time to spare before the weather turned a little unpleasant. The sun was still out upon arrival and Mike Joel, Steve and John we there already making a fire in the fire ring. John and I made jokes about how firefighters were required to put them out not start them. They had a corker of a fire going just in time for the rain, hail, lightning and wind to put the fire out. I give them all the perks as the fire lasted longer than I anticipated, but it did give up the ghost. The afternoon passed with a card game called Uca (I know it’s not spelled correctly) Steve and Joel made the cards from blank pages of a note book Steve was carrying. Supper followed shortly after the card game finished. The temperature dropped just after the storm passed and I think I had on just about everything, even my rain pants. Sometimes the sleeping bag is your only refuge if you need to get warm. I watched the firefighters teach John about rope handling. It was interesting and I even learned a few new techniques.

It was probably the best night sleep I have had on the trail thus far. Sleeping is always better when there is a good chill in the air. I was in no particular hurry to get started this morning as it was raining slightly and I did not have to do any big miles but for some reason I am always the first to roll out and start my morning chores. The mornings are always a little cooler and I would much more prefer to hike when it’s cool than in the heat of the day if I have a choice. I know there are times when you have to make miles and you can’t avoid the heat but this is not one of those times. This will be the last time I will see the fantastic four (Mike, Joel, Steve and John), I have enjoyed the camaraderie that only the trail can foster. With all my morning stuff completed I say my good buys and head out on the trail. I remember I have a penny and a dime that I found when I was sweeping the shelter this I will place on the trail in an eye-catching spot for the guys behind me to acquire. Maybe they will start a hiker trash box like I have. To Velva’s displeasure I have acquired a quite a collection to the extent of filling two wide mouth Nalgene bottles. There are all kinds of assorted junk that will have to be dealt with some day when ever that day comes. I have to find a place where I can call Velva as I haven’t been able to contact her for a few days and I know how she worries about me. I finally find a spot that has reception and the rain has stopped enough to keep the contraption dry. She is relieved I haven’t done anything stupid and I have all my extremities still intact. She didn’t worry this much when I was gone on deployments for 9 months in a theater of war. I guess she thinks I had better supervision then, God love her. Write before Snake Den Ridge Trail there was two pilots that met their demise in an F4 phantom in 1984. Aircraft remains are scattered up the hillside where I am taking a break. This time allows me to reflect on what must have taken place. If any hikers pass this way please treat this area as hallowed ground because of the loss of life. This is what was posted in 1984.                   A United States Air ForceMcDonnell Douglas RF-4CPhantom of the 363rd TRWcrashed in the Great SmokeyMountains on January 4. TheRF-4C was returning to ShawAFB, South Carolina, from anight training sortie. Bothcrewmembers were killed.On a brighter note as I was hiking a small bird flew up from almost under my feet. I wondered where this bird ad been. On further investigation I discovered 4 small white eggs in a hole dug into the side of the trail. That is why this bird is squawking so at me and I don’t blame her. I took a quick picture and begged her pardon for the intrusion. I quickly took off up the trail and watched from afar her return to the nest. I wonder how the eggs survive with so many predators? The trail to Cosby Knob Shelter had signs posted for aggressive Bears in the area so me being the only one there I cooked my supper, got my supply of rocks, hung my pack and food, then took a quick nap till the other hikes started to arrive. No bear and there hadn’t been one around for awhile according to the shelter journal. At the shelter are two brothers that meet ever year to hike a section of the trail. What is interesting about this, one lives in California and the other is from New York. What a logistical night mare. I wish my brothers would catch the hiking bug. The rain is coming down and it will make for good sleeping tonight except the shelter is full now and the snoring will most likely be intense. I have ear plug but I have a feeling from the reputation of one hiker it might not be enough.

Did not sleep to bad last night considering the volume of Snorrrrrrrring . I was once again awakened with the sounds of music; birds singing their morning wake-up and the soothing tumble of a water source 30 ft from the shelter. The day was crystal clear and with anticipation I was ready to get on the trail. I knew the views would be fantastic as I have done this area before with Velva. I did my morning chores and was the first one to leave the shelter. I knew I would be passed before too long as the speedsters were going my way. When I left the shelter and for 2 ½ miles I was debating on if I should hike the .6 miles out and back from Mt Cammerer fire tower. I knew the hike down to Standing Bear Farm (5150 ft to 1400 ft) would play havoc on the grumbling knees. Well I decided not to pass it up, how could I, it’s one of my favorite spots and it’s been several years since our last interlude. I was rewarded with a fantastic views and the only one there but it was not long before the speedsters would arrive. I stayed a little longer and talked to the speedsters, nice young men that haven’t got a trail name yet. I took some pictures of the mountains, fire tower, and the two Tenn. football players. I knew the next leg of my day’s journey I was going to test my knees so I took some aspirin and headed out. Thinking to myself on the way down I should have told the two young men about a trail name I was thinking about, “TEAM TWO STEP” to steps for every step of mine. If you guys read this consider it. The hike down reviled a few more views; the rhododendron and mountain laurel were in full swing at the lower elevations. Made it to Davenport Shelter and acquired some water and remarked to myself about the shelter still having the chain link fence around the open side of the three sided shelter. It was kind of dismal inside and I was glad not to stay there. Continued on my way down, to the northern terminus of the Smokies and stopped to talk to Jeff from The Hike Inn at Fontana. I stayed with them last fall. Nancy’s salsa was superb. The next big landmark was I 40; man did it feel funny to road walk under the Interstate Hwy. The steps going up from Green road were steep, but there was some trail magic at the bottom, nothing like some sugar donuts to fire up the engine. The trail went close to the hostel and was only a mile or so away and the end of my section hike for this spring. Well the farm came into view and the end of the trail for me. I found the young man that was helping out at the hostel and inquired if I could pay for a shower before hitting the road. A shower had never felt so good and hot water too. After a shower food was next on the list and I had a truck to take me there. Cracker-barrel was not too far away and a soft bed was next to the restaurant, that’s the end of my section Hike. To all that read this thanks for sharing in an old man’s dreams. To all a good night.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/360984,"Velva and I are off to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary soon and what a better way, than to spend time in the woods with someone you love. She is quite a lady as I have no doubt given her reason for chastisement over the years ,over 5 years separated on deployments and now playing in the dirt seeking natures grandeur just to name a few. What is that old saying, absence makes the heart grow fonder. Oh how my hart aches when I leave for a little bit but the joy in my heart on return is nothing short of true happiness! It’s going to be a whirlwind tour of several areas on and off the AT. Pisgah Inn on the Blue Ridge which will give us time to hike Frying Pan Lane up to the fire tower, Little Switzerland Inn just of the Blue Ridge will include hiking to Old Tom at Mt Mitchell and possibly a hike to the Graveyard Fields. We will then head to Grayson Highlands for 2 days to enjoy the grand vistas and ponies. From Grayson back south to The Hike Inn at Fontana Dam to hike 2 days on the quieter side of the Smokies. Then for our last hurrah off to the Len Foote Hike Inn with a trip to Springer will complete our fall vacation unless we can get a reservation at Mt Leconte lodge. We also have a trip planed in Jan 2012 for some more Smoky Mountains adventures. The winters are so fine on top of the Smokies. I hope the quite times we have together somehow compensates for the separation incurred by me pursuing the AT dream. She will be my transcriber and as always support me in the way only a true soul mate can do. It’s amazing how an office cubical can suck the life out of a sound mind and body even though the walls are adorned with hiking artifacts. The walls seem to close in smaller and smaller till I scream, “uncle, it’s time to play in the dirt”. Next week can’t come soon enough to calm the restless soul. It utterly mind boggling to think I have reverted back to my childhood. The older I get the less I am impressed with things and outward appearances. It’s the inner self that speaks the loudest. To impress me tell me the truth; tell me the hart felt truth that shouts out mountain tops, vistas on a cold crisp morning. Witness a fast moving stream over rock laden bed with a focus of a single leaf riding the turbulent story of life is what we long to see. Yes it’s time to refresh ones soul on the trail, some call coming home. I guess it’s enough rambling and back to work till I can once again play in the dirt.","Home

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363240,"The September 40th anniversary trip was a complete success filled with lions, tigers and bears at vistas that would rival the best in the east. Grayson Highlands in Virginia was quite a place. I have been there several times but the new never seems to wear off. The wide open landscape with the wild ponies and one bear just at sunset highlighted the trip to VA. It is truly one of my favorite spots on the AT. Another spot that had some interesting twists was the Twenty Mile Loop Trail in the Smokies. Velva and I started out with threatening rain clouds looming which I don’t mind but lightening is another story. The second foot log we came to was a 20 footer with a busted hand rail; my lovely bride was a little hesitant so I suggested we ford the stream but she cowboy up and made it across. I think I heard something about my ability to navigate a trail or something as she was crossing. All was well till the thunder started growling, we picked up the pace with me taking the lead and that’s when Velva started hollering snake, snake, guess I stepped on it and she got to do some ball room dancing to avoid the now ticked of snake. I got a good picture of it trying to take revenge for being crushed. With the snake incident behind us we proceeded on, only to have the sky’s open the flood gates. I said to Velva in my most convincing voice, not to worry honey we have good rain gear just pull your hood up to keep it from running down your neck. So here we are huffing and puffing up a ridge, raining like crazy, looking at the stream running down the trail as our feet make mud design on our rain rear. I let Velva take the lead after she accused me of trying to murder her on our 40th anniversary. All of a sudden she stops and backs into me, I thought to myself not another snake it’s raining out, she starts to stutter “b b bear”. The side of the bank sloped steeply down and about 15 ft away was a 120lb bear hugging a 2 ft thick tree looking at us at eye level. As soon as we recovered from the stare it quickly scooted down and retreated out of sight. As we were admiring our close encounter , I look up the tree trying to keep the rain from hitting me in the face and what did I see but two 20 lb cubs cling precariously from the trunk about 20 ft above our heads. Knowing mama bear was not far away and we were impeding the cubs from coming down we needed to depart the area post haste. We quickly departed 150 yards across the ridge before we stopped to survey the cubs from a safe distance but they were already gone. We hung out in the area for a while basking in the adrenalin rush trying to etch the moment in our memories knowing we have just witnessed a special time in our life’s. We both knew at that point our experience was more precious than diamonds or gold. What a way to celebrate 40 years of marriage.","Grayson

It seems as though it was just yesterday that I was standing at Clingmans Dome heading for Standing Bear Farm, Springer Mountain in the rain or Wise Shelter in Grayson with my 40 year bride. Yes life has truly been good to me this year and I count my blessing every day. It's a change for me to step out and do unfamiliar sections of the trail when I know certain areas just move me and make my heart jump around. But, but, but, there is adventure of not knowing what's around the next bend in the trail and what people will bless you with their presence. Yes I love the comfort of familiar places and I say to myself, self, all will be familiar if you hike it all. All right then, that's settled. Velva and I are headed to the Smokies again in January to see what winter adventure will be etched in our memories. As time seasons my mind and body, priorities changes and my outlook on life changes, the peaks and valleys are more rounded kind of like the Appalachian mountains, worn down with time. I sometimes gaze on vistas that I have seen several times before but as time passes the picture changes and gives way to a new appreciation for what my eyes are seeing. Is it the vista that is changing or the mind transposing the picture? Whatever it is, nature can still take my breath away. As one year fades and the New Year takes shape I hope all that read this are blessed with new visions of adventure that spark that special place in your memory that will be forever etched.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/366283,"Our winter trip to the Smokies was a success even though it rained all the days we were there except the day it snowed. There are silver linings to every situation though. It made us hike in some situations we would not normally hike in with temps in the 30’s and rain , however we were rewarded with views that were softer and complemented our over 40 years of closeness . My lovely bride was a trooper throughout our hikes and hardly ever sniffled about the terrain, maybe just once on an icy foot log with a 4’ft tree across it. I had hoped to do a few more miles on trails that I had not done before but the draw of familiar places was too great with the promise of waterfalls and vistas. The saying so little time so many trails is my plight. My heartfelt longing for dirt trails leading to anything, it really doesn’t matter. It’s the woods that suck me into a vortex of splendor. I guess it’s an omen that Vel and I have never had a bad day on the trail. Granted we have had a few up’s and downs but it never lasted more than the immediate situation and did not distract from the trail day. I like to think I try to expand her over all hiking experience she indicates we’re not in our twenties anymore and the rock hopping around flooded stream might present some hazards. I guess that’s why we need both our brains to make a good hike. Have you ever wondered why simple thing bring such joy? The view of a large tree silhouetted against the pail sky, the drawing of a smiley face in the snow beside the trail or a short rest break to skip a few rocks in the water. Life is truly grand and I get to share it with my best friend. I know this sounds a little sappy but isn’t this, what was meant to be? Thanks for reading the ramblings of a man that is truly happy. You know I always feel is kind of utopia when I just get back from hiking and try to put keyboard stroke to Microsoft word in my inapt attempt to covey my feelings. Wow this is getting deep. Guess I will stop before I implode. A 5 day hike at Cumberland Island is planned for March, can’t wait to visit the Island life. Between then and now the Florida trail will fill our hiking needs.

The weather was so, so, nice, 50’s at night to 81 for a high. You wake up in the morning, make your cup of coffee and wander out to the beach where you can look north and south and not see another soul except for birds and an occasional band of horses wondering the dunes in search of grasses. The sunrises were as expected, beautiful to the extent words don’t do them justice at least the layman’s terms I can muster. It seemed so strange not to think about making miles to get to the next shelter as Velva and I stayed at Sea Camp the entire 5 days. I think we were the only couple staying at Sea Camp with back packs (we both had about 35lbs) most everyone else loaded up a wagon and carried the kitchen sink to their camp site, there is however something positive to say about that. We met a nice couple from Georgia, (Dave and Rita) that were celebrating their wedding anniversary and I guess Velva and I looked a little puny because they kept trying to feed us, which I am not complaining mind you. I think they felt pity on us for just having what was in our backpacks. The spring breakers’ provided a plethora of entertainment. The best example was 3 young men trying to drag a 150 QT cooler full of liquid refreshments including all their gear 7.5 miles to Yankee Paradise camp site. The next day we checked the nearest camp site north (Stafford Beach 3.5miles) to see if they had progressed that far. We heard from a little birdie that they received a little help from a passing ranger. When talking to the young men they had a change there itinerary and decided to stay at Stafford at least till the cooler was emptied. Ahhh, this is what it was like to be young and foolish, I remember now. What memories the young men will make. We spent a day hunting for sharks teeth on a spoil bank that was dredged up from the inter- coastal waterway to accommodate the submarines at Kings Bay. We really got grungy that day. All in all a good trip and more memories made to file away for that time in our lives we will need to relive that trip. As it gets nearer to the last of May I wonder how my AT trip will go for two weeks. Over Snowbird, Max Patch and Bluff Mountain then into Hot Springs, not staying there as I will progress on into Hemlock Hollow Farms for the night and hopefully if the body feels refreshed onto Erwin. I so look forward to my interlude with the AT, I truly don’t know what it is about the winding forest trail that has allured me to it all these years but I know I am better for it. So, as I can once again can wonder through the long green tunnel I will have to quite my longing sole, relying on memories past looking always forward to the future.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378217,"It’s strange how life unfolds. Just the other day I was thinking about the upcoming AT section hike and how I would be going solo with many opportunities to ponder one’s life. I don’t mind starting out solo because you’re rarely alone for long. With that said my #1 son called and asked if I thought he could hike in the mountains as opposed to the flat lands of Florida. My #1 son is a little on the large side but has been working diligently on losing weight for the last few months. So I thought to myself what a better way to bond with my 40 year old son and have him press his physical limits on the trail. I know we will not make the miles as I once set as my goals but the rewards of family male bonding will far outweigh that. Twenty years from now I will look back on this time and think how fortunate was to have this opportunity. The only way it could be better is for my #2 son to join us on our quest to play in the dirt, but he is busy raising the grand children. I can hardly wait to show the little ones what the Appalachian Trail is all about and hopefully interest them in a little play in the dirt time. Next week at this time I should be some were around Max Patch and having fun. The weather forecast looks to be a little on the warm side but I should be use to it coming from Florida. I wonder how The Three Amigos are doing. I will have a toast to them on the trail for long life and soft trails. The adventure awaits, new friends to meet, physical challenges to conquer, new skill sets to test and best of all to see what God has in plan for us on the trail, #1 and I.

This proved out to be a pleasant drive with good conversation between a Dad and his Son. We arrive at Log Cabin Drive and checked in with Hattie about 8PM. The bunk room only had one other hiker staying there (Achilles) so there was plenty of room. Achilles is a through hiker that had a medical issue and was slowly mending. He was heading out tomorrow heading north and we were getting a shuttle north and hiking south so our paths would meet again. Scott and I had a good conversation with Achilles about the rigors of trail life; I think Scott was surprised on what he would face as far as physical requirements. Achilles was an out of work mechanical engineer that may have found his calling. Seems as though he was really enjoying his hike. The accommodations were first rate for a bunk room along with a spotless wash room. The grounds were well taken care of and the stream and majestic trees just added to the overall serenity.

Fred shuttled us to Devil Fork Gap in the little car that could. The roads were steep and winding and Scott was getting a good look at the terrain. Fred dropped us of and we stood beside the road watching him drive off. I asked Scott how he felt knowing his transportation was only by his feet. I could tell he was a little intimidated as he said he did not want to let me down. I was happy that he’s just trying. Off we went with gentle ups and downs for 2 ½ miles till we got to Flint Mountain Shelter. We made a quick stop at the shelter to post a flyer for a missing dog called AT from Hemlock Hollow Farm and also tank up with water as my son was almost empty. I told him to drink as much as possible at every stop to keep hydrated. I looked at the profile of the upcoming few miles and tried to prepare Scott for the climb. As we started the climb it sounded as I had a locomotive behind me, huff puff, huff puff churrrrr, he was slow but steady. We finally cleared the top of the climb and I congratulated Scott on his accomplishment, 1 mile 1000 ft elevation gain and still going strong. His reply was this isn’t the flat lands of Florida. I think I heard a little sarcasm in his voice as he recovered his breath. I told him we have clear sailing to our next stop the Shelton gravesite. We arrived at the gravesite and took a pack of break and reveled in the serenity of the area. I guess it was time to reflect on the magnitude of the carnage that was so prevalent in the Civil War. History that I hope will never be repeated any ware in the world. It was almost like a walk in the Park as we traversed Big Butt Mountain I was thinking to myself to bad it was so far uphill from Jerry’s Cabin as the star gazing from the bald would be so grand. The Bald was so green, almost florescent as it was silhouetted against the blue sky. I am not sure if Scott was in awe of nature’s granger as much as I but if not he should have been. From the bald you could see the towers on Bald Mountain that we would be hiking to the next day. It always put's things in perspective when you can see where you’re going and where you’ve been. Wouldn’t life be simple and predicable if you could do the same in life’s busy road? We arrive at Jerry’s cabin around 4, kind of a short day but I could tell Scott had enough and it was our first day so I was a little tired also. It was kind of fun teaching my son the hiker ways around a shelter, claim a spot, water, dinner and sleep in that order. We were not the first ones there; two section hikers were just passing through on their way a little further south trying to make miles in the allotted time. As the evening progressed hikers started to file in, more than I had figured being so late in the season. You could tell the through hikers by the fragrance, which by the way are well earned. Some of the through hikers were returning to the trail from Trail Days in Damascus to continue their quest of Katahdin. I was remarking to Scott we had not seen much wildlife when a rabbit appeared right on Q as if to say here I am, I am photogenic and wildlife. So I took his picture and thanked him for his efforts and asked him to find his cousin the black Bear. No such luck. Night came fast and the ear plugs were adorned post haste.

I can always count on the birds to wake me a little before sunrise and what a pleasant start to the day to hear a gentle melody from one of natures musicians. I know if I had 6 months to do this I could name all the melodies authors on my way to Katahdin, alas that is the life of a section hiker. I was quick to get working on my morning duties as I am always a little over exuberant when I first get on the trail. I tried not to make much noise as I gathered my stuff and gave Scott a shake. I started the morning coffee and asked Scott if he wanted any as a tease to get him up. We both completed all our duties and were on the trail by 0730 without wakening any one up in the shelter. I was surprised the rest of the shelter crew were still not moving as we donned our packs and gave the shelter one more look through. I always get that feeling I have left something behind but seldom do. Scott and I headed out to our first notable area Big Firescald knob. The hikers that came in last night painted a ruff picture of the upcoming terrain so Scott decided to go around the 1.5 miles of rock climbing, I on the other hand volunteered to go and take pictures and told Scott I would hook back up with him on the other end of the bad weather bypass trail. I told him it would take about 1 ½ hrs as I like to dilly dattle on areas that have good views. I watched him take off down the bypass trail as I said to myself I hope he does not get turned around. I was not disappointed on the vistas and I wished I had talked Scott on going up the Knob; it wasn’t as bad as the north bounders made it out to be. I did run into a fellow called Parson, a 72 year old retired preacher on his way to Katahdin. We had a good chat about us both being a little long in the tooth. He gave me inspiration and I hope I am in as good of shape when I reach his age. By the time I made it to the south end of the bypass trail Scott was sitting there on a pack off break he said the trail was a little overgrown but not too bad. We set out for Camp creek Bald look out tower only to be disappointed because it was closed. There was an uphill grade to the tower that I think did Scott in, I think it was at this point that he informed me this type of hiking was not for a Florida boy. I tried to encourage him but the trail claimed another causality. The terrain ahead was 4 miles of downhill so I knew it would be a little easier on him going down I thought. I told him I would catch up to him at Little Laurel shelter and we would have lunch, I wanted to hang around the tower to see what I could see. I could not find any place with a good view so I started down to meet Scott. On the way down I ran into Achilles heading north he was not too far from the top, nice talking to him again. Hooked back up with Scott at the shelter, we had lunch and discussed what to do about his ailments and decided the best course of action was to call it a hike and head home to Florida. The downhill was taking its toll on Scott’s knees, by the time we got to Log Cabin Rd he was really hobbling. He said he was so glad to see Hemlock Hollow Farm again. We were both welcomed by Hattie and Fred as we approached their farm and they were sorry our hiking plans were cut short but I told them as I also told Scott I was very thankful for the quality time I got to spend with my son as an adult. Its times like this I will cherish and remember all the days of my life. So, it’s the end of my spring section hike, it’s barely enough to bring back the sanity from corporate America but it will have to do till September when I will hike with my wife in the Smokies.

I have been working 60 to 70 hrs a week which is cementing my retirement date to March 31 2013 although it’s kind of scary to turn the page in a new chapter of life. I’m not going to extend it, it, it, it, no, no, no, !!!!! …. I have scheduled several one week vacations to keep the sanity in check until then. Smokies, Hot Springs section hike, Cumberland Island, then back to the Smokies in January. Not sure if February and March will required to be filled in with vacation. Guess that will be determined by the amount of hours required to work. Seems I require more trail time as the work load increases here in corporate America. It’s kind of funny to see the looks I get as artisans come to see me and start to ask about all the pictures and trail trash that adorn my cubical. I always take the opportunity to enlighten them with my AT wisdom. Some roll their eyes and other are interested in my AT shrine. Velva and I are looking forward to the Smokies with reservations made at Leconte it will surely be a successful trip. We are still deciding on which trail to hike up and return. I love the section up the AT to the Boulevard (just short of Icewater Springs) and down Bullhead. This will be our 11th time up Leconte and this time we will celebrate our 41 anniversary. Where have all the years gone. It seems just yesterday I was driving my young bride to Westport Island Maine to show her our new home. She reminds me of the culture shock that took place as a teenager when she left Florida to go with me to the North Country to start what would become a bond that would last a life time. I hope everyone that wants a mate can feel the same time tested happiness as I. My dance card is rather full when I return from the Smokies as I only have three weeks before I go on a fall section hike. The life of a section hiker, logistics logistics logistics. My spell-check is going into convulsions with the fragmented sentence. O, did I mention I will have another grandson on Oct 11th? Little Eli is his name. The back pack carrier is all cleaned up and ready to go. Ollie (another grandchild) has out grown my capacity to carry him comfortably so it will be passed down to Eli.

Vel and I spent 4 days hiking in the Smokies, covered 32 miles, 1 days of rain, 3 days of sunshine, one bump on the head for me and 2 bruises for Velva. Yes it was one of our best hikes yet. One of the days was devoted to Cades Cove which I did not count as a hiking day although we did tromp around in the rain quite a bit. I think we made 4 trips around the 11 mile loop that day and were rewarded with a lot of wildlife viewing. There was not much traffic as the skies were leaking quite profusely. Our injures are quite entertaining now that the deed is done and you have time to reflect on the situation. For me, I was talking to Vel and not paying attention to the trail as I should, I approached two blow downs which looked like one which is why I hit the second one with my bandana covered head, which did not afforded me much protection to my now sparsely haired dome. As I was counting the now swirling dots and stars dancing in front of me I was brought back to reality by this piercing scream of laughter from somewhere behind me. Yes it was my lovely bride of 41 years. Do you feel the sympathy? She knew I was OK because of the hollow sound it made when I contacted the tree at least it’s her story. Did I mention we were hiking of trail on an old manway? We finally joined up with Grapeyard ridge trail out of Greenbrier and were motoring down the trail. Velva was taking the lead as she was carrying the camera gear to take pictures of the old steam engine which overturned in Injun Creek and I always like to keep her in front of me so I have quick access to the camera gear if needed. We had to cross a few creeks and I guess it was one too many for my lovely bride because as I was about to say be careful crossing it happened. She took a slowwwwwww motion fall onto her left side into a muddy wet crevice between two rocks in the creek. I helped her up knowing that it was her pride that was mostly hurt as I looked at her muddy wet cream colored scort. I said in my most aloof manner “is the camera gear ok”? If looks could tell a story. My next reply was “I meant are YOU OK I am all confused it must have been that bump on the head”. She said something to the effect that she has been hiking with me for 15 years and never taking a fall. My reply was things come in threes. As it turns out she did have two pretty colored bruises and I ended up with less hair and a red spot on top. My best time this trip was at Icewater Spring Shelter when we were sitting having lunch and a Doe with two yearlings that still had spots started to feed with in view of the shelter, but a close second was at Andrews Bald with a bottle of wine (in a gateraid bottle), summer sausage , two hammocks and my lovely bride. I got my permits to hike from Clingmans to Fontana 15 through the 18 of October that will complete the Smokies woo who. It was so convenient just to walk into the backcountry office and get them.

As I lay there listening to the wind and rain I wonder about my 0600 departure to Clingmans Dome. I turn on the weather station and it looks to be clearing out in the late morning. I go back to sleep and dream of soft trails and grand mountain vistas. Morning came and I was on my way to Clingmans with Jeff from the Hike Inn. When we arrived we were the only car in the parking lot and if you could see the weather up there you would understand why. The wind was whipping about 35 and raining sideways. It felt as though it should be freezing rain but was just above freezing. I pulled my gear out and staged it in front of the rest rooms to get out of the wing and said good bye to Jeff. I knew I had to get moving to generate some heat so of to Double springs Shelter, my first break. So strange how the weather can change so fast as it was sunny by the time I made it to Double Spring Gap. Off came all the foul weather clothing and shorts and T shirt was in order even though it was in the forties. Silers Bald shelter was next and only a short distance away. I met a group of college students on their way north, nice young people, very considerate. The terrain so far was as expected as I have traveled the path before with my lovely bride but I had never been to Derrick Knob and that is where I will end up for the night . As I passed below 5000 ft I noticed a change in the canopy overhead, no longer was it sparse but full of color and most of the leafs still struggling to stay with the mother ship. Made it to Derrick Knob at 1400, about 5 ½ hrs almost 2 miles hr not to bad for an old guy. There were two young men just leaving the shelter. They informed me there were still hot coals in the fire pit so it should be easy to keep it going. A small fire in the evening is always a welcome addition to the camp site. I said thank you and have a super day. Since I had 5 hrs of daylight left I commenced to eat lunch, sweep out the shelter, read the journal, gather fire wood and filter 4 liters of water enough for an evening meal and the next day’s trail requirements. I was wondering if I would have any company for the night when Bob showed up about 7. I told him I knew he was coming and I started a fire in his honor. We had a good chat and found out we had a lot in common. He also was contemplating retirement in the near future. As the sun went below the horizon stars filled the night sky twinkling and shimmering as only they do when a front clears out all the clutter. Soon you could see the lights of Townsend and Wears valley. I wonder if they know how pretty it is up here looking down into the Valley. I tried to call Velva and tell her what my eyes are seeing now but no service. I will have to share this picture in my head at a later date. I returned to the shelter and enjoyed the heat of the fire. It felt o as good as it was turning quit cold. I turned off my headlight and wrote some in my journal by fire light, Bob was already snoring away the night. It was almost 9 and I was wondering how the wooden deck would feel after 10 hrs of peaceful rest, ya right. It was about this time that I wished I had carried the Thermarest instead of a closed foam pad but the weight thing won out when I was packing and my knees thanked me however my back might grumble a little tonight. It was about 10 when Mat and Katie from Minnesota came in to make 4 for the night. They had started at Camp site 113 (Birch springs) and did about 3 miles night hiking, that made for a long 17 miles. Katie complained about her feet a little and I can see why. Wooden platform here I come, good night to all.","Clingmans Dome

Many hikers have crossed this small bald that overlooks Cades Cove just west of Thunder head mountain but I haven’t and it overwhelmed me to stop. It’s a perfect day, sunny and cool with plenty of time to make the next shelter but it most likely wouldn’t have mattered if I didn’t have the time I would have stopped anyways. It’s just that special of place to me. You know you reach a time in one’s life occasionally that will imprint a memory like no other. I don’t know why God does what he does but I am glad he allowed me to experience this day. Hiking is not for everyone, yes there is a measure of misery on occasion but its times like this that cumulates all the good things that hiking has to offer, just my opinion. Well I think I will just take a nap on this bald if my eyes will let me. Life is surely grand.Here I am at Spence Field Shelter with 7 other fellow hikers, all good people with different life styles and professions, deeply engrained to a common goal, enjoy the outdoors. Got another good fire started but the wind is such that the draft is not working correctly and the smoke is starting to drift into the shelter. Nothing like a little smoke smells to cover up the funk. One young man was hiking form Damascus to Springer and his mother met him at Davenport Gap to hike the Smokies with him. His Mom seems to be having problems keeping up with the young man as he wants to do big miles and his mother is not really capable yet but she is trying. There were plenty of views with a grand painted canvas but limited wild life sightings. I did see quite a few hikers today at Rocky Top and several of the grassy fields as I descend to Spence field. I made many memories today and hopefully this journal will help me recall with some sort of clarity the day’s events. I thank all that follow along with me and share the ups and down as I make my way north and sometimes a short southward trend. I only hope that I depict the special happenings throughout the day that make the hike so special to me . Darkness is up on us and hiker midnight is closing in quickly.

I was going to stop for the day at Mollies Ridge shelter but the granger of the mountains kept wooing me on. The miles melted away like ice cream on a hot summer’s day, before I knew it I was climbing Shuckstack Fire Tower and it was all downhill from there. The view from the tower reveled mountains that were ablaze with color, reds, greens, yellows, ice blue sky a virtual kaleidoscope was in front of me. I took a picture with my cell phone and sent it to my lovely bride so she could share in a small part of my euphoria. After my photo session with the fall colors I headed down from the tower towards Fontana and was thinking a good bear sighting would top off this hike like a cherry on an ice-cream sundae, why am I thing about ice cream so much?. Low and behold what did I see on a small grade to my left but a verrrry large bear. He was feeding on the ground alone and lifted his head to check me out. We both did a stare down just long enough for me to capture the memory in a photo. He meandered up and over the ridge and I thanked him for the opportunity to share his forest this day. Yes my fellow hikers I was hiker utopia, this three days was on top of my short hikes. As I look back I must of presented quite a joyful demeanor as I would greet each and every hiker I met this day with a “Hi my fellow hiker what a glorious day for a hike” I had been reading about a family of four hiking at a slow pace in the shelter journals heading in the same direction as I and I finally got to meet them Doe Knob. They were taking a lunch break Mom, Dad and two young girls. The Dad just got back from Afghanistan and was spending some quality time with his family. You could see in their faces that they were indeed a family and were having tons of fun. It’s nice to see the next generation indoctrinated in the outdoors. I finally made it down to the Fontana Visitor Center and called for a shuttle back to the Hike Inn. As I write this I am still basking in the afterglow of the days hike or maybe it’s the wine at Fontana Lodge with the large steak on my plate. It has indeed been a wonderful hike filled with new memories. I will be planning my next adventure with my lovely bride to Cumberland Island on November 11 through 15 this year then back to the Smokies in January for some winter hiking.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/396746,"Cumberland Island Georgia was once again a successful adventure as Velva and I spent 5 days (11 through 15 November) there enjoying all the goodness that the Island had to offer. We were entertained by raccoons, squirrels, armadillos, horses, hogs and deer. There was one squirrel that must have had teeth of steel as my food container was bear proof but no match for the wiley squirrel with a big appetite. Vel and I came back from a hike to the north end and witnessed the critter smiling at us from the tree above our camp site with one of our pieces of flat bread hanging from his chubby cheeks which were most likely expanding now from the instance mash potatoes hydrating inside them. This guy was good; he chewed a hole in our food container large enough to drive a Mack truck through. We always pack to much food so we had enough to share, lucky for him, or squirrel stew would have showed up on the menu. The Willow trail stands out in my memory as something to be remembered. We had done the 16 mile hike a couple of years ago but I was in for a surprise this time as I think it had not been maintained for at least that long. The trail is only 1 ½ mile long and goes from the Parallel trail to the beach 2 ½ miles north of Stafford. It’s a raised trail surrounded by swamp in places with not to many places to get off if something bigger than you want the right away. Just so happened that a single horse wanted the trail so we had to depart the area, we went under and over trees, stomped through mud and boomeranged of cobwebs. It was quite grand to come to the end of the willow trail onto the beach and look north and south and not see another sole. What a memory we made that day.The Cumberland trip would not be complete without a hike to Raccoon Keys and play in the dirt looking for shark’s teeth. We found several but I took the prize with one of substantial size, almost 2 ¼ inch long. There is spoil dredging from the intracoastal on the Keys that make the hunt for fossils interesting. Well that about ends this year’s adventures playing in the dirt and I wait with anticipation to see what 2013 will bring. I only have planned at this time a one week trip to the Smokies in January and retirement this March. So as we all can plainly see my dance card is a little empty. I hope the AT is in my future. I have not made any arrangements as far as logistics for hiking as I normally do as I will be able to just pick up and go. What a concept. Velva has given me the green light on pursuing my goal but I know she would rather me stay closer to home but just as my descendent Johnny Appleseed did I will wonder through the woods also, just not planting apple seeds. So to the class of 2013 I wish you all a safe trip and I will see you making memories in the dirt.","Willow Trail

The mind still thinks it’s relatively young until it receives battle damage status from all its extremities struggling to keep pace. Well enough of that, nothing that a little cortisone won’t fix. Velva and I are heading to the Smoky Mountains soon to see what winter wonders we can see. The Smokies have a special draw in the winter that I can’t quite put my finger on. Have you ever sat in a snow drift, surrounded by fir trees and felt the muted silence? To me it’s almost deafening. The blinding diamond lit snow, resting ever so gently on the fir bows. If you’re sitting low enough on the ground and you’re lucky enough to have everything silhouetted on a cobalt blue sky, well it’s just one of those moments. Yep I am ready now; I have my mind in the right frame. I have no doubt we will see some white blazes but snow level will dictate how many. I remember one year trying to get to Mt Collins shelter from newfound Gap that never materialized, but we still had a blast trying. Our son and his wife will join us this year in the mountains. It’s always adds a lot to the adventure if you can share it with family and friends. Hope they like the cold weather as I think we will encounter some. I have several things planed between now and May which will keep me from starting the trail. So it looks like the end of May I will start my extended walk north. Not sure how long, only time will tell but one thing is for sure I don’t have any time restraints as of yet, keep my fingers crossed.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399419,"Velva and I had wonderful time in the Smokies even though it rained for 4 days and snowed for 2. It was said by the locals that it was record rainfalls which made the waterfalls so grand. The flow at Abrams falls was the most volume that I have ever seen in the 16 years I have been hiking to it. The trails were a little muddy in the beginning but firmed up in the last part of our vacation due partly to the freezing temps which we all know turn to ice. We were hiking over in Smokemont area and just made it back to Cosby before the road gave way on route 441. If you haven’t seen the cut through the road that the rain made you should check it out at the GSMNP website. Sure glad I did not get caught up in that, it wood of been a long walk home. The rain also made for some interesting stream crossings. My lovely bride has now been christened in the below 40 degree fording of a creek. I am still hearing the waling and gashing of teeth. It’s funny how you can laugh about things later down the road. The crossing was not her favorite part of the hike but she cowboyed up and pressed on. My son, Velva and I visited Max Patch Bald, what a view. No matter how many times I go there it always impresses us with its majestic mountain ranges of pastel blue hues, silhouetted with the AT fence posts, and if we’re lucky a bluebird perch on top. This really did happen, however the blue bird did not grace us with his presents this time. The snow was a good ending to our vacation as we got to see the mountains dressed up in all their glory. The Greenbrier part of the Smokies really seem to sparkle in the snow category however I bet there are a lot that would disagree with me and say the Leconte area is the best. I have been trying to get things in order to hike this coming May. Logistics is a term I have grown to not enjoy as much as I use to. As a section Hiker I have planed and deplaned and looked forward till the time when I can just go and not have any restrictions on my comings and goings. I am planning as I am going to Pearisburg VA from Standing Bear Farm on Green Corner rd about 380 miles. That should be a good tail of the tape if I can muster up the fortitude to continue. If for some reason I falter I will return home, recover and press on again. That’s the plan as it sits right now. I ask myself on occasion what is the drawer of the AT and I can never seem to put my finger on the exact thing. Maybe the people, maybe the solitude, I do like a challenge or maybe just a mid life crises, O ya I forgot I am a little past mid life. Whatever the allure it brings me on a rollercoaster of emotions, highs, lows but always more highs than lows. I can remember sitting on a sunny bald solving all life’s challenges or freezing my but off cause I was too lazy to put on a rain jacket. So I guess the morel to this story is I just like it and as many hikers that hike is how many stories you will get. See ya on the trail","Home

As I start to check out, people just have to ask what are you going to do with your life. They ask it like I am going to sit in a lazy boy recliner and wait for the grim reaper to come visit. I have to shatter their vision of me growing moldy when I tell them I will take a walk for awhile on the AT. It’s so amusing after I open the flood gates of questions. The one I like best is (Your too OLD) then I go into a rant about a hiker named Cimarron at the age of 90 hiking the trail. Hope you make it back to the trail Cimarron your tenacity is what you are all about. I hope I have just ½ of what you’re made of at my young age. My Mom was 92 shoveling snow from the front porch. My aunt is in her 90s and taking cruise line trips to the Carrabin. That generation has shown us that anything is possible with enough resolve. As the last of March draws near I find myself second guessing if I am doing the right thing by retiring while I am still able to contribute in support of the Navy, but I guess 44 years is fine and I will volunteer my services in areas of my choice after my walk. I have made a spread sheet for 400 miles from I 40 to Pearisburg, shuttles set, food drops almost ready, and gear looking good.

This will be my longest hike on the AT at one time. Get back bad thoughts; I haven’t even gone through 5 days of consecutive rain yet. My spare bedroom (Hiking Room) looks like a bad joke of a very sloppy storeroom but it will come together. I sometimes think it would be a lot easier just to go and resupply on the trail.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440759,"Well here it is another year gone. Where does all the time go? I retired last year and I have never been so busy in my life. I don’t know how I ever had time to work. I will take a trip to the Smokies in a few weeks and try my hand at hiking around the mountains. Hope it’s not as cold as it is now. The polar ice cap has moved to the Smokies. I have a new hiking partner this year not sure how much hiking on the AT he will do but he is a joy to be around on the trails (Florida Trail) around the house. Grayson (for the Grayson Highlands) is his name and he is a handsome Australian labradoodle that will mature to about 55 lbs. I am planning to take him to Grayson state park this year maybe even start at Damascus and see how he does on a couple nights out with the boys. He got a Mountain Smith pack for Christmas and his training is going well both on the trail and in the classroom. A well mannered dog on the trail is a must. My AT section hike goal for 2014 will start out at Damascus and go north till I have had enough. I have learned I am a section hiker and not to make too many hard and fast plans as they always seem to change. I plan to start in late May as I do every year. The body is in fairly good shape except for the old aches and pains of being on social security age. I hope I can work myself into an average of 16 miles a day on the trail but we will see. To the hiker class of 2014 starting out at Springer this year I wish you all a safe and pain free hike. To the south bounders keep your eye on the prize as the north bound hikers start out, your turn is coming. Fair winds and following seasPockets","Home

I will get a shuttle to Damascus and hike the 150 mile back to my truck. If my old body is still in good shape I will try another 100 miles to Daleville, only time will tell. The training I have been doing at home is good but does not really prepare you for the trail. I spend 1 ½ hrs with my pack and 1 hr on my bike at a minimum most every day which makes me a little tired. Hope Mother Nature will put the spring back in my step. I have a schedule which indicates an average of 15 miles a day. The rough one will be the first day of 15.6 to Lost Mtn shelter. I will have a late start because it will include the shuttle from Woods Hole after morning meal. A friend (RYLU) sent me a picture of Katahdin last year. It reminded me of how many times I had seen the view when I was growing up and it never donned on me that the AT was even in existence. I fished the small lakes of Roach ponds and hunted the Golden road area. I believe I saw Katahdin when I was fishing Nesowadnehunk Lake back in the early 70’s when I was stationed in Brunswick NAS. Wow that was a stroll down memory lane. I have been reading journals that cover the area I will be hiking this year and it makes me excited to know soon I to will be on the trail again. The emotional rollercoaster that you go through is unexplainable. Looks like I will be just behind the bubble this year.

So I got Neville to do a slack pack this was of course after the morning meal at 0800. The meal was one to be remembered just like Mountain Harbor in Elk Park NC, just a little healthier. I was a little apprehensive about my abilities as I always seem to have issues, most likely a head thing at least that’s what my lovely bride indicates. The hike started with a small up and down to Doc’s Knob, stopped in for a little water and a stretch. The next 6 miles was a walk in the park what a beautiful part of the trail. There were several views but the best was Angels View just before the 2 ½ mile down hill to Pearisburg. I hiked most of the way with Ship Wreck a nice young man that just got out of the Navy, hence the name Ship Wreck. The Rhododendron, Flaming Azaleas and the allusive lady Slipper were everywhere. You literally walked through a tunnel of flowers what a wonderful start to my hike and the ending spot was pretty good also. The pickup spot for my shuttle back was Dairy Queen and I had over an hour to wait so I made good use of the time eating ice-cream with Tumbles Camel and Lady Bug. The fun continued with the ride back to Woods Hole via multiple stops to pick up food good at the local Amish farm and store. I just had to sample the 6 flats of strawberries we picked up. I also purchased a handmade wicker trash container for our kitchen back home. O we also picked up 30 gallons of butter pecan handmade ice-cream, Woo Who.

I shared the shuttle with Mike Griffith nice guy from down in my neck of the woods. The trail as I headed north crossed the Virginia Creeper trail twice. I made a mental note to come back and ride the trail with Velva. As I passed over a bridge on the Creeper just before heading into the woods I saw a huge square tail behind a rock that two boys were trying to catch. I did not stick around for long but I am quite sure the trout did not get to be that size by being easy to catch. As the first night on the trail this year I still smelled pretty good and had good energy. There was a good group of hikers at the shelter and several camped around the surrounding area. I would see several of them for the next few days. I am so looking forward to tomorrow as I go through Grayson Highlands State Park. I named our new puppy after the area, hence the name (Grayson). Not much for animal sightings but the trail was good with a few reroutes.

Was up and out of camp by 0730 as I had almost a 5 mile up at the beginning of the day. Hiked most of the day leap frogging MacGyver and Cat. Nice young people that worked for REI. Hope they get their jobs back if they want them. I bet they will know what they’re talking about when they finish the trail. The first big view was Buzzard Rock, it was a little misty and visibility was limited. The weather would break every so often so I spent some time at the rock. Knew I was going to have a pretty hard day so I had a few snacks and put a couple within reach for energy when I needed it. The grade was not too bad but the rocks were sometimes hard to navigate which is why I rolled my right ankle before Thomas Knob. Did not feel too bad so I pressed on to the next shelter. In retrospect I wish I had slowed down in this area and spent an extra day. But as usual the mileage monster got me. The views were continuous for the rest of the afternoon and the bonus was the ponies everywhere. The terrain did not get any easier for my ankle. The Fatman Squeeze was quite a rock tunnel and not to be missed. Stopped several times to take pony pictures and had to back track ¼ mile as I lost the trail during my photo episode. Met a family of 5 through hiking along the way, nice family. Wish I had that kind of adventure when I was a kid. Finally made it to wise shelter and took a break, after consulting the guide book I pushed on a little for a stream side camp site. It was a good decision as it was one of the best sites I have had. After setting up camp MacGyver and Cat came over and used the camp fire to cook rice. We all had a nice evening but ended abruptly as it started to rain, so sleep arrived a little early that night. Called Velva to let her know everything was going all right and learned our pup Grayson was misbehaving. He will get a stern talking to when I get home. Har Te har har.

I broke camp early and everything was wet from the rain last night plus the mist was so thick this morning it was like rain. On the trail at 0700 with the anticipation of a 20 mile day to the third shelter north. Ankle doesn’t feel too bad considering yesterdays rocks. A rabbit posed for me in the middle of the trail so I had to capture the moment. The day was a series of little ups and down which stayed up at elevation. The cool mountain air seemed to invigorate my pace. There was a couple camped at the Scales live stock corral that offered me some coffee when it was done cooking but I thanked them and pressed on had they offered bacon and eggs I would have been all over it. From that point on all I could think about was bacon and eggs. Made it to Old Orchard in good time stopped in for a sugar snack. The shelter is a little dreary but adequate for a night sleep. I still had two more to go. Hurricane Shelter was only 5 miles down the trail and it was a new shelter with a covered table. I was going to take a break there but a man was sleeping on the floor of the shelter so I did not want to disturb him. One more Shelter to go and 10 miles away. Passed a pretty water fall and two deer. The grade was relatively easy except for Iron Mountain 2 mile up at the end of the day. Trimpi shelter is on the back side of Iron Mountain and my home for the night. Took a break at the top and was introduced to Mr. Snake. I tried to share my snack but he wanted nothing to do with a granola bar. I have a feeling had I offered a frog he would have been all over it. Where have I heard that before? The day ended up at a fine shelter with a nice fire place that Little Man kept stoked at a nice level. I opted to pitch my tent down the hill but could still see the fire.

I need to listen to my body a little better and not push the mileage but I always feel pretty good and my cardio is fine . I got on the trail about 0800 and the first thing I come to is trail magic. One of the local churches leaves this unmanned tent with all kinds of goodies in boxes. I got some butterscotch candy which I have been craving. Is amazing how God supplies things. Saw one of my first toads on the trail. Years back I use to see a lot of them. Stayed above 3000 ft all the way to Partnership Shelter. Hiked with Motown and Archangel most of the way and split the cost of 2 large pizzas ordered from the visitor center, what a treat. While we stopped at the shelter Motown borrowed a Martin guitar and played “In the Summertime” by Mungo Jerry he was really really good. I will hum and whistle that tune for the next several weeks no doubt. We departed the visitor center full of pizza and moving a little slow. I think the pizza went to my feet and it’s hard to pick them up. I soon burnt the food off and was cruising well. Saw two deer, snake and a dinosaur in a tree limb. Hope I am not O.D. on pizza!! The terrain was easy and I soon came upon Chatfield Shelter and had a snack. Its just too soon to stop and Atkins is only 5 more miles., so off I went. This will mean a big day for me and my knees and sore ankle. I soon forgot about the ailments when I came upon more trail Magic supplied by a local church group at the 1894 Lindamood School and Museum. Fresh fruit was on a table just calling me. Motown, Archangel and I sat on the front steps of the old school as many have done since 1894 eating apples, oranges and bananas. I got a good picture of my two trail buddies on the front porch then headed down the trail in search of my resupply at the Relax Inn in Atkins. As I neared Atkins there was a beautiful red barn on a hill side with cattle in the foreground, what a sight. The trail crossed VA 683 and Interstate 81, the Relax Inn was conveniently just on the left. I checked in, got my mail drop and did nightly chores. Motown and Archangel were soon there as well and we had dinner at the local convince store. As I started to wind down I became pretty tired and a little sore at my right ankle. I guess I sprained it a little as it was swollen some. I guess a little pain is what gets you closer to Maine some folks say.

The hotel was a little Spartan but clean. I then made it to The Barn Restaurant for breakfast where I met Jay (camel). Come to find out Camel and I are the same age and hike about the same pace so I will see him several more times no doubt. The morning meal was real good and the company enjoyable. It seemed strange when I left the restaurant to start walking down the road towards Interstate 81 so unnatural as opposed to the trail but it soon entered the woods just after passing under the I 81 bridges. There were several good views of pasture land and cattle as I departed Atkins. I soon met up with Camel and we hiked the rest of the day together. Camel got his name due to the fact that he carries no water instead tanks up at water sources and it’s enough to make it to the next watering hole, I was amazed. He tells me water is too heavy to carry. Wish I had the ability to do that but I guess I have a phobia about running out of water, go figure. I was walking down the trail and came upon someone’s trail art. In the middle of the trail was 546 spelled out in pink flowers petals with ¼ depicted with little sticks. This is a small milestone as ¼ of the trail is completed. It’s most likely bigger for me being a section hiker as opposed to a through hiker. Who would of thought in 2008 it would of taken me this long to attain this goal but alas it the curse of a slow section hiker. Views were abundant for the next area of farm land but it was indeed gorgeous, rolling hills framed by blue hue mountains and quaint homesteads. Pictures and words do not give justice to the imprint it made on my memory. I saw 2 more deer and one snake as I entered the woods once again but it was short lived as I came out next to an old farm that appeared to have an old mill structure. The stream went right next to the wooden building and a broken down something paddle wheel maybe lay crumbling in the creek. As I followed the creek it was lined with yellow irises and a board walk to keep my feet dry. What a grand trail and how considerate of the trail maintainers to think of this, thank you. It was not too much farther down the trail that Camel and I decided to camp for the night as we had already hiked over 18 miles and was looking at a 5 mile up hill. We decided that a good early morning start would be in order instead of tackling it at the end of the day.

Camel is a little quicker on the uphill than I so he was a few minutes ahead of me when I made it to the next water source which was a beautiful spring. I could see him 400 yards ahead as he climbed the north end of Chestnut Ridge but he was soon out of site. There was a Boy Scout troop tenting right in front of the rock with the sign indicating water 100 ft. I thought Camel had got water but by the time I reached the shelter I found out he missed it. Chestnut Ridge afforded views galore and there was a white flower blooming so it also gave the appearance of a white blanket on top of the ridge. Chestnut Knob shelter was a fine block structure with a door and windows. It was cozy and clean inside with ample room for 6 or more. At an elevation of over 4400ft it was the highest point around which provided nice views in between the mist rolling in. The temps were quite cool especially since I was wet with sweat. I took some pictures to commemorate the summit and pressed on down the steep incline. My right ankle was hurting on the downhill and felt a little tight in my boot. When I got to Walker Gap I took a break at checked out my foot. The next few miles were rocky and I rolled my ankle again so with that I knew I was going to have to rest it for a few days. The more fatigued I got the more apt I was to injure it further. I called Don Rains the shuttle driver and informed him that I would like to be picked up at VA 623 if possible and shuttled back to Woods Hole. It was not an emergency as I could still hike but it was painful. I hiked the rest of the way to VA623 and said my farewell to Camel. I was a little disappointed in myself for not being a little more careful with the rocks but happy in the fact I will hike again when my ankle stops swelling. I considered staying at woods hole for a few days but opted for my own homestead which was only 8 hrs away. So this is the end of my hike for now and back to the everyday ritual. I have immensely enjoyed my short time on the trail and look forward to returning. I will be more careful next time. If I was through hiking this would not stopped me, I would of just rested my ankle for a few days and did smaller days till it recovered but since I am a section hiker it was a easy call for me. I wish all that I have met on my hike smooth hiking to Maine but I know better as it is not for the weak at hart and it take mental and physical prowess to continue north would day after day.

There just happened to be a fire pit, a camp site with chair included, all under a large oak tree. How I ask you, can I pass this up, NOT? I put up my tent, sat down in the chair and contemplated life’s meaning.

I made it to War Spur Shelter in about 4 hours (9 Miles) but the 6 miles remaining would prove to be a formable challenge. I had a 2 ½ mile up that kicked my butt. I was not sure if it was because of my age, heat, or the grade being so steep, but it was harder than I remember. How soon we forget the pain and only remember the good times.

This was the hottest day yet and it sucked the energy from me like never before. The terrain was not bad but a ½ mile ridge walk on rock made me feel like an egg in a frying pan. There was no shade except for the occasional trunk of an oak tree, which I took full advantage of. I stopped under the Eastern Continental Divide sign and took a heat break, although hot the views were just grand. I guess it was a good trade of and as time passes the pain seems to fade and all that is left is all the good things. Funny how that works.

I elected to do the short day and take my time on the trail for once. I still started early today as the birds never fail to wake me at day break. At the first road crossing I saw Mammoth and Friction just breaking camp. I knew they would pass me soon as they were heading to Four Pines Hostel. Brush Mountain was challenging but enjoyable in the cool morning air and at the summit was several benches to rest the mind and body. Less than a mile further was Audie Murphy’s Monument, what a solemn place. There were several ID bracelets, unit badges and other soldiers medals placed at the base of the monument in tribute to a true American hero. I only wish I had remembered to bring some of mine to leave with Audie. I sat there for a while and thought of the pain and sacrifice he had gone through and it made my worst day on the trail seem like it was nothing at all. Thanks to men like him I am free to play in the dirt at will. I left the monument in a somber mood but was soon thanking God for the blessings he bestowed on me, as I was walking down the back side of Brush Mountain. I went through a burnt area of the forest that was coming back all green and lush with vegetation and a 20 lb. Cub Bear came bounding down the trail towards me. I have no doubt he would have walked right past me if I hadn’t clicked my hiking poles together and said hi little guy. In the back of my mind the threat of mama bear overwhelmed the cuteness of the cub so I hastily took three photos and proceeded down the trail. I felt so happy and blissful I was at the Shelter in no time at all at least that’s what it felt like. I got there and Angel was chilling, we chatted for a while and he decided to stay the night, it was good conversation. Soon Salty and Shanty showed up and placed there gear in the shelter for the night at least that’s is what I thought. As soon as there gear was all nicely placed for a night sleep I heard a commotion like the shelter was being invaded by a herd of elephants. Evidently a spider had wanted to sleep with them and Salty did not want to share so they immediately decided to pitch a tent. We all got a good laugh, I was a little sorry later for getting so much entertainment from there phobia. There was about ten hikes traveling together that called themselves the Santa de Mingo which came into camp in the late evening and set up camp down by the water source. It soon quieted down and night over took us so sleep came at about the same time.My rose, was two things, Audie Murphy’s Monument, and the Bear Cub.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/495462,"Pickle Branch Shelter to Catawba Shelter 7 May 18, 2015, 14.6 miles. I can’t believe I have had such good weather. I can’t remember when I have done a section hike and did not have rain at some time. The only thing that comes with no rain is hot weather and dwindling water supplies. Today is another beautiful day and the hike up to Dragons tooth was not bad at all. The bark was worse than its bite as one would say. The morning was cool and I made good time till I got to the tooth and I just had to enjoy the views from as many angles as I could. I arrived about the same time as Salty and Shante so we took the mandatory pictures. I was a little timid to climb to the top of the tooth because I kept on hearing my bride say don’t do it you old fool, so I stopped short by 5 ft. and turned around but I got some good pictures anyhow. We started down the trail and it was fun going around, down and under rocks. There was even some hand hold ladders in the rock face to help you navigate the trail. I can see where some would not like this, kind of reminds me of the White Mountains in places. My next stop and highlight would be a stop at the convenient store on VA624 to eat as many hot dogs and drinks as I can and not get sick. I talked to Craig on and off on the way to the store and I told him I would meet him on the trail and that’s just what happened. Almost like we planned it that way, so after my 4 hotdogs, 2 Gatorades and some bananas I ambled back to the trail and Craig and company were there waiting on me. The trail was a gradual grade to Catawba Mountain Shelter so we all made it with a few hrs. to hiker midnight. Craig, Mike and Wyatt seemed right at home in the woods and soon had all the camp chores done. I wish I would have got some hot dogs to cook over the wood coals for us all, it would have hit the spot. We all stayed up past hiker midnight and enjoyed the fire so at around 9 we all hit the hay and I must say that was the best night sleep I have had on the trail yet.

I was however slightly concerned with the stamina of one of the participants witch was without merit because everyone did just fine. The climb up to McAfee Knob was enjoyable in the morning coolness and the summit was just gorgeous with views that went on forever and the photo opportunities were everywhere. The views grand and country side interesting as we went through mountain meadows and ridge walks the entire day. You know I am not sure that Tinker Cliffs were not more interesting and better views that MacAfee’s Knob. The views being grand at Tinker Cliffs we all decided to eat lunch and continue on to Daleville instead of camping at Lamberts Meadow Shelter, it would have made for a short day and everyone felt good to go for the home stretch. I am quite sure the food had nothing to do with it. The rest of the terrain was just small ups and downs with a few bolder scrambling thrown in for good measure. We all made it to Daleville about 6. We were going to put up at the Howard Johnsons Express but there was a Graduation going on or something and all the rooms in town were taken, so we loaded up in my truck and went to retrieve Craig’s truck back at the Dragon Tooth’s parking lot. The gang took a photo beside the Black Creek Vet logo that they placed on a dumpster, to bad there weren’t a better spots but it let everyone know they were here. It was a good trip and good company for my final 2 days this year and I hope we can all do it again. Not sure if I will be able to get out on the AT this fall as I have 2 trips planed in the Smoky Mountains with my lovely bride of 43 years witch we will celebrate our 44 anniversary at Mt Leconte this year. So to all my brothers and sisters on the trail north and south this year I wish all the best in attaining your goals.

I will have some people following me this year as I have gained a cast of friends at a local nursing home where I give a monthly presentations on walking in the woods. Each presentation we make about 3 to 4 shelters on the AT as they progress north. As of this journal entry we are just entering the Smoky Mountains with all its grander. Most are wheelchair bound so they enter into the woods through my words and picture presentation.  I have not been absent from hiking this year as I have visited the Smoky Mountains twice, Roan Mt, and several areas in-between with my bride of 44 years. January in the Smokies was a hoot. I was blessed with my 5 year old grandson accompanying me on several hikes this year.I will celebrate my 65th birthday this year and will hopefully still keep up a decent pace on the trail. When your younger you never think slowing down could happen to you but it has and my pace has slowed a bit, but the desire to play in the dirt has not.

I decided I would do a few slack packs at the hostel this year to start off with as I am not sure how the old body will react to the rigors of hiking. I am carrying a pack just not the full load. I am at about 10 lbs. instead of 27. It saves the pounding on the 65 year old joints. I also get to pick the direction north or south depending on the difficulty of the terrain. My lovely Bride of 44 years said I was cheating myself of the full enjoyment by slack packing, Ha Ha. The day started at 1000 after shuttling my truck to Reservoir Rd. As I headed south I walked through maintained meadows at the crest of several ridges. Summiting Cole Mountain the views were plenty and the weather was cooperating by allowing me to take in natures grander. There was a long downhill (4.6 Miles) from Bald Knob to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter but the trail was not to rocky so it was what I would consider an easy downhill. The rest of hike was easy little ups and downs at low elevation crossing several streams with good opportunity for water replenishment. On my decent from Cole Mt I crossed paths with a hiker named “Bad Hang” I inquire as the origin of his trail name. Seems as he had a run in with a hungry bear at Thunder Hill Shelter. He had hung is food bag and several others in the trees 12 ft. up and 6 ft. to the nearest branch but the bear seemed to be able to acquire the full food bag anyway. The bear made such a commotion that the whole shelter got to watch the bears dastardly deed. The hiker was named “Bad Hang” at that point. I learned several days later from a ridge runner that he thought that the bear was put down as he started to relate food with hikers and had started to stalk them. Very sad situation. Well the days hike ended at Reservoir Rd were I had parked my truck. It was a pleasant day’s hike and I returned to the Three Springs Hostel run by Oma and Marsha. The accommodations were first rate.

Morning came early 0530 and breakfast was delicious. It’s cool in the morning but it don’t take long for it to warm up. I look at the profile for today’s hike and it quite formidable a 6 mile up and then down to the James River. It’s not as hard as some of them 6000 ft. mountains but that was in cooler weather. Heat is the hard part for me, heaven forbid I pray for rain. Ha Ha. Started out at 0900 and in no time I was in the grove, head down, hiking pole clicking away and thinking what a wonderful day it is. I was brought out of my trance by an audible snort of a startled deer drinking from the same spring I had planned to get water from. Wish I could have got a picture of him. I got my water and treated it with chlorine although it would have been fine coming from a spring. I did not stop at Punchbowl shelter and headed for the top of Bluff Mountain. There I found a little monument of Ottie Powel that had lost his life in 1891 after he strayed from school so sad. I pressed on and was rewarded with several more views. Heading down the mountain for several miles I stopped at Johns Hollow Shelter. On the way in on the side trail I came across a black snake looking for some shelter mice no doubt. I watched as he slithered away as only a snake can do. I got some more water at the shelter and said hi to the evenings residents. I bid them a good night and was quickly on my way in anticipation of a dip in the James River along with a stop at subway for a meatball sandwich. When I made it to the James it was pouring rain so I figured I was wet enough and headed back to 3 springs via Subway. Good day all in all feeling pretty good.Making memoriesPockets","Reservior Rd

It’s a good way for an old guy to make some miles and ease into the trail. By the time I feel comfortable it’s time to go home and plan the next year’s section hike. If my schedule stays on track I will be 9 years older on my summit of Katahdin (74 years young).I started this days hike a little late (around 1000) and I had planned a pretty big day 19.1 miles so I was just a little concerned I might be stretching my capabilities just a little. Then I thought it really don’t matter I have a head lamp with me so all its well. Worrying is not a good thing and it can distract from the overall enjoyment of the trail. I will just accept what the trail has to offer and don’t worry be happy. Where have I heard that before? Now I can’t get that toon out of my head. Ha HA. The trail was relatively easy with just small ups and downs for 15 miles then a big down into the Tye River. The weather was cool in the morning but heated up in the afternoon as indicated by the rivers of sweat running of my elbows as I planted my hiking poles. I passed Seeley Woodworth Shelter without stopping and pressed on to Spy Rock where I took a brake at one of the better vistas of this trip. It was a rock scramble to the top, Canook went with me, and I think he was genuinely concerned for my safety. I could hear my wife saying in my ear (you old fool you need to be watched all the time) but I was soon at the top and all is well. The views were 360 at the top and so grand. I would of loved to say and camp out tonight but I guess I better get going so Canook and I took the usual photos and down we went. I was thinking Foot Locker would catch up with me however I found out he passed me while I was getting water at the Priest Shelter as I found out from Hill Walker., nice young man that had quite a bear encounter several shelters back. He was slack packing from US 60 and picking up his pack at the Tye River. On the way down the Priest I ran into a nice family heading to the shelter for the night. It so nice to see a family teaching their children the ways of the woods. Can’t learn that in school. I made it to the Tye River at about 1830 just behind footlocker but he was already on his way further north. It was a long hike for me but I felt fine.

There was a lot of hikers on the trail today, mostly day hikers out for the day doing loop trails that are scattered all along the BRP. It was nice to stop and chat with people on the trail as I had time today, only 10 miles. Going south bound I would run into hikers I have seen the last few days. I would have to stop and explain why I was going in the wrong direction. There was one big climb today at 4000ft called Three Ridges Mountain. The views from several spots were awesome. The valley below was a patch quilt of little farms. If you stopped long enough your mind would wander and I would wonder what the people on the farms were doing. Every once in a while the sounds would drift up of a farm tractor laboring in a field. It’s nice to slow down occasionally. I ran across footlocker and slim rim at Hanging Rock overlook. Footlocker was drying out his tent from the morning dew. I sat for a while then the itch came and I knew I had to get going. The trail down the back side of Three Ridges was quite rocky and a prime location for Mr. Rattle snack and sure enough one of the hikers heading in the opposite direction said look out for the snake a mile or so down the trail. When I got there a ridge runner was guarding the trail to ensure the hikers passing by gave distance and respect to the snake as he was large enough to strike quite a distance. I took a picture and scooted along down the trail. I then stopped to talk to a couple of guys that I could tell had quite an accent from up north, come to find out we covered some of the same ground in Maine and N.H. The trail went down for about 6 miles and ended at a beautiful foot bridge that crossed the Tye River. As I crossed there were several families camped alongside the river and the kids were enjoying the cool waters that the river provided. What a wonderful way to spend a weekend.

The wife and I have done the Shenandoah’s in years past doing day hikes and staying at Big Meadows and Skyland it was an expensive proposition but tons of fun with my bride. This will be a section I will likely do more than once. Easy grade, good food, and a soft bed, can’t hardly beat that. Today’s hike is only one up then it’s relatively level but rocky. The rocks slow you down a lot or you pay the price of twisting an ankle or worse yet a face plant into a rock, not something I relish doing. I took it slow today know I had short miles and all day to do it in although I promised myself a meatball sub at Subway to night. A guy called Hammer stayed at the hostel last night, he got dehydrated during his hike yesterday and had to be picked up from the trail for a 0 day to recover. He said he got kind of disorientated and sick to his stomach. Good thing he had the fortitude to call for help.As I hike down the trail I ran across, Peanut, Jutsey, Canook, Ho Bo, and several others that I have met over the last several days. The rain started just as I reached the rocky area, not enough to put on a rain suit but a drizzle and slick rocks none the less. I have a rain jacket but I seldom use it for rain unless it’s cold and windy. The rain feels good on the hot days and I just hike wet and dry out when the rain stops. At a rock outcropping there was a couple just chilling under a tarp with two hammocks. This reminded me of Velva and I at Andrews Bald were we go for the day with hammocks, wine and cheese. Its nice to chill once in a while. Further on down the trail I came across a hiker out for a day hike with his Airedale Terrier named Lucy, a sweet dog that reminded me of Grayson, my dog at home most likely looking down the driveway wondering when I am coming home. Yep, I miss my dog. I also miss my wife and grand kids, guess this is why I failed as a through hiker but I am satisfied doing my sections and splicing together the trail.

Man what else could you ask for? I did not stay as it was too early in the day. I had my eyes set on Dicks Dome Shelter. A little later I walked under I-66 what a noise with all the traffic overhead. I was glad to get back into the woods. The trail was ups and downs the rest of the way to Dicks Dome. I arrived with plenty of time to spare for the usual rituals of setting up camp. The shelter look kind of strange hence the name Dome. The local trail crew was erecting a new shelter not far from the old one. There was a sign on the table they were looking for help. Wish I was in the area I would have loved to help. I set up my tent and I noticed a little late it was not exactly level but it would do. A nice couple from Oregon was there by the name Brace and Curly. By the end of the supper meal I think her trail name should have been CURRY as she spilt a quart of curry all over herself and surrounding items.

We made it to Hightop Hut in good time. Being one of the first hikers there we had chose of accommodations in the hut. Crock got the upper deck and not wanting to climb I chose the lower. The hut filled as the evening wore on and the night serenade commenced. I slept well with ear plugs and the morning came with e birds.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567387,"The day started out early as usual at the birds command. We departed the shelter without our morning meal or coffee as we sought a better view atop Hightop Mt. It proved to be a grand morning meal vista with all the grandeur nature wanted to bless us with. We ate our fill and progressed down the mountain with an added incentive. We would pass Lewis Mt campground store that had all kinds of stuff to eat. At mile marker 923.2 the store was in sight and cold sandwiches, Gatorade, and Advil was on the agenda. With renewed energy we went in search of a campsite for the night that would be fitting the end of a grand day. We found the best spot atop Hazeltop Mountain. My journal goes like this: “As I write this I am sitting on a rock outcropping overlooking 8 ranges of mountains going west, the valley below is dimpled patchwork quilt of shades of green pastels. Looking down on distant towns I ponder on the view Daniel Boone or Davy Crocket might have had. As the sun starts to retreat for the day a star burst of colors overwhelm my senses. Words do not do the visual justice.” This is why I love backpacking, all the misery is null and void on evenings like this, and the ability to share it with my nephew makes it all that more special. The emotional roller-coaster of long distance hiking strengthens the sole and reveals the true you. I know now that Croc will be a fine addition to humanity and I am proud to call him kin, my nephew.

The terrain was not very difficult to day as there was only small up and downs through the day. We stopped at Big Meadows for breakfast on or way to Skyland. This would prove to be a very food fulfilling day. Two meals right on the trail, this is the way to hike. I will be surprised if I lose any weight on this hike. We saw a Bear and a bunny that we got to within a few feet from however the bear kept his distance. As we progressed through the day we came upon this rock wall that just called our names so up Croc went for a photo opportunity and to burn of a little extra energy. Skyland came into view about 330 and I was pretty sure that would have a room, and they did except we had to weight about an hour for it to be ready. Meanwhile we sat out front looking like a pair of homeless smelly vagabonds. The room was finally ready at 430 and we got to the cabin just as it started to rain. Dry again. About 530 we headed to the dining room for a feast that would leave us with swelled bellies. We asked if we could get some biscuit and apple butter to take with us on or hike tomorrow and the waitress fixed us a second helping. We waddled back to the cabin and fell fast asleep till morning. What a fine ending to another day on the trail.

The days hike was a lot of ups and downs at a quick pace as we knew we would have a long day. We were trying to cut of a day of our time and get to Mountain Home one day ahead of schedule. 7 day hike across the Shenandoah N.P. is quite ambitious for a old guy but with the good grace of God we will have the energy. I did feel a twinge in my knee around the Pinnacle but it did not last long. We made it to Elkwallow Wayside about 4 and pigged out on the local cuisine. Man it was good BLT, Cob salad, fry’s and a Gatorade. Food seams to taste so much better on the trail. We waddled out of the Wayside up the mountain to a campsite about .7 miles north. It was a fine campsite and we were tired. This would be the last time making camp on this trip and I could have not asked for a better hiking partner even if he does hike in Crocs all day. Hiker midnight is here and the food bag is hung in the trees with care. To all a good night.

The highest peak was 3368 ft. and it looks like that will be the highest we will be for quite some time. If I was to continue past Harper ferry without looking at the profile I bet its a few states before you would see anything higher. We both could feel the pull of the end of our section hike and the miles were just flying by. We made it to Mountain home cabin in 9 hr. and covered 18.5 miles, not too bad for a couple of flat landers. The picture shown is the northern terminus of the Shenandoah’s. As we came to the trail head on US522 in Front Royal there was a bunch of bananas, fresh strawberries and bottled water by the kiosk. Thank you very much to the trail angle that left it there, it really hit the spot. Croc and I ate a couple of strawberries and left the rest for the hikers continuing northward. As Croc and I entered the gate at Mountain Home Cabin we both did the Hi 5 although I was not that graceful and almost missed Croc’s hand twice. We were both excited for our accomplishment. Scott the owner saw us coming up the drive and came out to congratulate us in addition to wishing Croc happy 30th birthday. We took a shower and headed off to find a motel a little further south in hopes of cutting into the 11 hour drive back to Florida. When we reached our night destination we celebrated with 50ml of Zwack a very horrible drink but a toast none the less. It’s now past 9 and hiker midnight is long past. To all that continue northward I wish you soft pine needles under your feet, spring water at every stop, and a grade that is easy and fits your hiking style. Good luck and God’s speed.

Steve and I started our hike from Harpers Ferry. So glad to share the AT experience with him. We got to see a train as we were leaving Harpers Ferry and walk down the C&O canal path. We talked with three hikers Rudy, Twizzle and Big Chief; little did we know we would be seeing each other for the next few days. We got to the shelter with plenty of time to spare. A through hiker with the trail name Baby Fire Devil came in and entertained us for hours trying to start a fire. It was quite hilarious, but she finally conquered it and we had a nice fire for the evening. A good start to the hike. As I look back at the past 4 years and all that has happened with covid, medical issues and the overall state of the world I take in a deep breath and exhale all the stresses. It is a relief to be reunited with the long green tunnel one again. With my seventy first birthday in the rearview mirror, I ponder what life has instore for my future hiking endeavors. It is my hopes and aspirations to press northward to experience the people, places and things that make up the Appalachian trail, but you never know what life has instore. I have learned in my short life span to embrace life’s next adventure whatever that may be. Enough rambling

This day began at 0730. We headed out with positive thoughts. There were several interesting sites like the Gathland State Park and White Rock Cliff with a fantastic view of the area we had hiked earlier in the day. As we hiked it became apparent that it was going to be very challenging for Steve and his level of comfort was going to be tested throughout this hike. My focus became more on helping him navigate the terrain and keeping him safe than making miles. As with any long distant hiking there is a level of misery and discomfort that accompany your trek. It was obvious that his adventure was going to be a level suffering that I did not think was stainable. I give him all the credit as his drive to endure pain and press on was as commendable as I have seen on the trail so far. Time will tell how much the alure of the AT out ways the physical demands placed on him. He will know when he’s had enough. 
We arrived at Rocky Run Shelter about 1700 hrs. to the celebration of Ruddy, Big Chief, and Twizzle. A big hurrah was heard throughout the forest. You meet the nicest people on the trail. Our conversation during the evening touched on the Pioneer Trail back in Florida and all three promised to visit the piney woods of Jennings State Forest. Its now 2030 hrs. and hiker midnight has arrived.

What an interesting day hiking, so many places of interest like assume hike in campsite (Dahlgren) with a shower and flush toilet. I felt so special Ha Ha, Washington Monument, and the foot bridge over I-70. Who could forget that? As I was walking across the truckers were sounding their horns as they passed underneath.  Not sure what all the ruckus was but there was a group of young ladies gather on the bridge. As Steve and I were eating lunch at Pine knob shelter who came bouncing up the trail but Rudy. The conversation went like this” (Pockets) I thought you were ahead of us? (Rudy) I took a short cut that turned out a little longer than anticipated.    Boy I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard that story. Well, it turned out the days total milage for Rudy was a little longer than anticipated. The three of us decided to continue to Annapolis Rocks another 1 ½ mile north to see what the views this evening might be. Amazing what a hot meal will do for the ability to climb a few more mountains. The weather forecast was for rain but not till dark so off we went. We met the rest of the group coming back down the mountain looking for Rudy, what a reunion!! We were now 5 strong heading north to Annapolis Rocks. Made it to the campsite about 1800 hrs., set up tents, filtered water and headed to the vista to soak up natures granger. Took some pictures to help my gray matter in later years remember the people places and things. Friendships, vistas, hardships shared, I welcome it all the same. The difficulties will soon fade and all your left with is pleasant memories. I think that’s the way were wired, at least I like to think so. 
Well, the rain started as soon as it got dark witch made for a wonderful night of sleeping but that came with a price, heavy tent in the morning. It was nice sharing some time with Big Chief, Twizzle, Steve, and Rudy. Seems as though you always meet likeminded hikers on the trail. Funny how that works.

As I awakened this morning, I was greeted by the pitter pater of rain drops. I also head a puddle at the end of my tent. In my haste to set up my tent last evening I forgot to look at the grade on the new tent pad. Drainage was nonexistent and a lot of water cumulated in one spot. Just a small hurtle to overcome. The rain stopped and the fog settled in for a while. It made for a heavy tent until we could dry it off. We were planning to make it to Raven Rock shelter at 11.5 miles, but it was not to be as Steve had reached his threshold of pain he wanted to endure.  The rocks of Maryland/ Pennsylvania had taken its toll on my friend. We called a shuttle to meet us at Wolfsvill Road and take us to Amberson House B&B that we had secluded for the 20th. Everything went well and we were eating hamburgers that evening. Steve agreed to stay at the B&B for an extra night so I could make it to the Mason – Dixon line and into PA, that was my goal to cross into PA. Steve’s goal was to experience the AT for as much as he could. A slack pack is on the agenda tomorrow.

The day started out with a breakfast to behold; Amanda from Amberson House B&B was the architect of the feast. Steve and I finished about 0830 and were on the road for a slack pack soon thereafter. I was dropped of at wolfsville road with a planned hike to Pen Mar at the Mason-Dixon line 10 miles north on the trail. Not a long day but it will accomplish my goal of making it through Maryland and into Pennsylvania. Steve will hold the fort down at the B&B and recover. The forecast was for severe weather in the afternoon, so my plan was to beat the heat and weather by a fast hike today. I felt strong all day and was able to complete the 10 miles in 4 hrs. The sounds of thunder were on my heels but I made it to the pick up without a drop hitting me. As I crossed High Rock, I was surprised at all the graffiti painted on the rocks. It distracted from the View. It’s a shame we must try to put our mark on nature as she is beautiful if left alone. This will complete my spring hike and I was so happy to share the trail with Steve.  I hope to resume my north bound trek next spring or possibly this fall. Time will tell my next interlude with nature.
