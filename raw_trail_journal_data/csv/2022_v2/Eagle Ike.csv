Eagle Ike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646122,"Appalachian Trail FAQ’s
Now when are you going on your hike? 
   Masters week (first week of April) through mid September 2022
Are you hiking by yourself?
   Yes. I am hiking solo. No one else is crazy enough to do the whole thing with me! Friends and family will be joining me in different sections of the trail. There are a number of other thru-hikers on the trail so that one can hike with others or be by yourself when you want, which is what I often prefer.  
Are you going North to South or South to North?
   Yes. Both. I am doing a flip flop hike starting at the southern end of the Shenandoah National Park and hiking north to Katahdin, Maine then driving back with family to my start point and hiking south to Springer Mountain, Georgia to complete the thru-hike. 
Aren’t you worried about bears, snakes, weirdos, weather, etc?
   No. Having done over 200 miles of section hikes on the AT and various other backcountry hikes both solo and with others, it is much safer than one might imagine, and the people you meet are wonderful. Yes, rarely, bad things do happen, but it is probably more rare than living here in a neighborhood in the CSRA, Georgia. Black bears are generally very shy and very rare to see. I have encountered only one bear so far, and it is actually something you want to experience (occasionally!) I’ve seen more venomous snakes in my back yard than on trails. And face it, there are weirdos everywhere. I am trusting and relying on the favor of the Lord, prayers of family and friends, intuition, situational awareness, and the generosity and company of others to get me through. 
Are you taking a gun?
   No. None of the thru-hikers carry guns due to the extra weight. “On a long journey even a straw weighs heavy.” I may take pepper spray. 
Are you coming back?
   Yes. I plan to return to my supportive family and to full-time medical practice. 

A.T. stats
Completed August 14, 1937
>350 peaks
Over 250 shelters 
1,500 types of wildflowers 
The A.T. is among the longest continuously marked trails in the world. An estimated 165,000 white blazes guide hikers along the 2,193 miles of trail.
The elevation gain/loss of hiking the entire Appalachian Trail is 465,000 feet. 
It takes over 5,000,000 steps.  
The A.T. goes from Springer Mountain, GA to Mt. Katahdin, Maine and travels through 14 states.
Northbound: Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Southbound: Virgina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia
Mt. Katahdin came from the Penobscot Indians and means “The Greatest Mountain.”
The number of days it takes the average person to complete a thru-hike is 165. 
""Thru-hikes can range from a full-year to a blistering 41 days, 7 hours and 39 minutes, but most will complete their 2,193 mile trek in five to seven months, with the average being “a week or two shy of six months.”
I am hoping to complete the hike in 145 - 155 days.",,View Entry,"Dec 21, Tue",0

The place where God calls you is the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet. Frederick Buechner
Your deep gladness is the call of one's true, enduring and authentic self, the pursuits that engender, not necessarily always happiness, but profound joy.
Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.  Gil Bailie

“Embrace the challenge. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. This too shall pass. Challenges cause growth. Have a mentality that favors joy. Find joy in simple pleasures.”  Thanks to Zach Davis Appalachian Trials

Hopeful to finish in early to mid September I imagine relief, accomplishment, and gladness to reconnect with my family.

Eagle Ike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648419,"Let’s go!
Today begins my thru- hike of the Appalachian trail! The most beautiful part of this is that I get to do it with my family. We started at Rockfish Gap with the opportunity to slack pack, which means carrying only what you need for the day. This is one of the more enjoyable ways to hike.


Trail proverb we wrote today:


Be friendly with your family and family with your friends. 
Thought of the day:Sojourn. Journey. This journey of life is really a sojourn, a temporary stay, before the amazing, exciting journey of eternity ahead with Jesus.
Do you know Him?


“Heavenly Father, I worship you today with reverence and awe. Thank you that you carry me on eagles’ wings and bring me to yourself. Thank you that you say that I am your treasured possession. Help me to make it my first priority to worship and to love you with all of my heart and with all my soul and with all my mind.

Cold, wet day mostly by myself. Learned I need another warmth layer while hiking! In a shelter during a downpour I met “Keystone” who is about my age and started his northbound flip-flop 11 days prior.Blackrock Mountain was a highlight, but the view was socked in with clouds.


Believe it or not one of the best parts of the day was getting out of the cold rainy, windy conditions and hanging out in the heated Loft Mountain Campground bathroom for a half hour!


Wonderful to join my family at the end of the day!


Saw maybe forty five deer.


Trail proverb:


“Don’t make important decisions when going uphill or in the rain.”


“As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God? Why, my soul, are you downcast?

Heard of a hiker nearby named “TP” who was just renamed “Chernobyl” after his Anker lithium battery exploded and destroyed his backpack! Thankfully he was not wearing it at the time.
Several men were on the trail with a group of scouts, and one of them said to me, “Keep smiling.”

Jesus, my King, ‘in your majesty ride forth victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds’ (Psalm 45:4a).


I slept really well from 9:30 PM till 11:30 PM and then was up until 3:30 AM and conked out again until 7:30 AM when the pancakes were served! Having a good day today had a really good conversation with two young men - they are brothers actually and I hiked with them for 4 miles and brought up lightly some spiritual topics, and lots of other topics. It was a real pleasure. Isaac and Samuel if I remember right. And I finally posted the first YouTube since I had Wi-Fi and couldn’t sleep, so I think it should be available. Really appreciate all of you. You can find me on YouTube at Hike with Eagle Ike.

When you read books like Wild at Heart it makes you do crazy things like hike the Appalachian trail


Went up and over Piney Ridge and Buzzards Hill, which are part of the Virginia Roller Coaster - about a 10 mile stretch of up-and-down hills.


Met Adam again. He he’s from the UK, and it is his first time in America. He stayed back at Whiskey Hollow shelter where I was last night. And he is camping out here on the ridge near Bears Den. He is taking three months and hiking northbound. I have a feeling we may keep seeing each other.

Had a good stay at the Bear’s Den hostel last night.

1. O sacred Head, now wounded, 
with grief and shame weighed down, 
now scornfully surrounded 
with thorns, thine only crown: 
how pale thou art with anguish, 
with sore abuse and scorn! 
How does that visage languish 
which once was bright as morn! 


2. What thou, my Lord, has suffered 
twas all for sinners' gain; 
mine, mine was the transgression, 
but thine the deadly pain. 
Lo, here I fall, my Savior! 
'Tis I deserve thy place; 
look on me with thy favor, 
vouchsafe to me thy grace. 


3. What language shall I borrow 
to thank thee, dearest friend, 
for this thy dying sorrow, make me thine forever; 
and should I fainting be,

outlive my love for thee.","Bears Den Hostel

I’ve had an epiphany today, realizing I’m wearing myself out trying to do too many miles. So I will be adjusting the hiking plan. I just haven’t been enjoying myself as much as I think I could if I did a few less miles each day, and my 55-year-old body is wearing down. 


Had a wonderful day today touring Harpers Ferry, and learning more about the history of our country.


While standing at the confluence of rivers overlook in Harpers Ferry among a crowd of people, a dad asked me if I'm a thru-hiker, and I said, “Yes” and he said, “Come meet my daughter,” and when I walk over it's “Traps!” I had met her briefly on the trail the day before. I sat with she and her parents and her hiking buddy “Foxtrot” for about an hour on this beautiful afternoon in Harpers Ferry. Really great people.


Enjoyed homemade kombucha with a family who is staying here at the Hostel.

Trail proverb:
No pain. No rain. No Maine.


An old man, going a lone highway,
Came at the evening, cold and gray,
To a chasm, vast and deep and wide,

But he turned, when he reached the other side,
And built a bridge to span the tide.
“Old man,” said a fellow pilgrim near,
“You are wasting strength in building here.
Your journey will end with the ending day;
You never again must pass this way.
You have crossed the chasm, deep and wide,
Why build the bridge at the eventide?”

“Good friend, in the path I have come,” he said,
“There followeth after me today
A youth whose feet must pass this way.To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be.
He, too, must cross in the twilight dim;
Good friend, I am building the bridge for him.”

24.5 miles to Leroy A. Smith shelter. Beautiful weather in the morning as I walked along the ridge overlooking the valley. This stretch was a low water zone. In the middle of the day there's a 15 mile stretch with no water. It got quite hot. I saw an interesting Sun halo that was quite colorful. Then there was a climb out of the valley, which was more of a rock scramble using all fours to climb the mountain. The payoff at the top was an incredible view. Later in the day began to rain, so I wanted to make it to the shelter. On the way I met a new flip-flop thru-hiker named ""All Good.""

Every Moment Holy 
by Douglas Kaine McKelvy 

""May we find grace in the wilderness.
May we find grace in the heart of the wood.
in the space of the fields,
in the rising of rocks,
in the rushing of streams,
in the painterly dabs of wildflowers,
in the windswept bending of wild grasses.
Here stir our hearts
to remember that grace is ever a wild thing 
May we chase your manifold mercies over ragged hills, pursue your song through the sparse and layered lyric of sculpted deserts,
marvel at your mystery fixed in the wheeling designs of stars overhead. 

May we hear it in  that fidget in the night, 
trace it in the leaping dance of campfire flames, and sense it in the sweet incense of pine and leafmeal.
Restore us to our truer,
wilder stories, O God.
In this place may we breathe your quickening breath, sleeping in tents tonight,
awash in this glorious ache, 
sojourners stirred afresh by distant rumors of the return of their king.
May we wake at the soft pulse of dawn to find in the wild and whispering winds of your Spirit,our pilgrim hearts ringing like chimes.""

After I hiked 5 miles, I reached the Connecticut River which marks the border between Vermont and New Hampshire. Hard to believe I have finished taking another entire state! Vermont was a wonderful state in which to hike, and I think my favorite so far. Going into the town of Hanover I saw St. Thomas Episcopal Church which bears the same name of the church in which I was raised. I wanted to take a picture to send it to my mom and as I was doing so the Reverend came up and asked if I wanted to come in and get some water or use the restroom. I appreciate their hospitality.  


I went in to town and ordered a healthy, large salad at Lou's and got a Starbucks coffee. It is a college town, and there are a lot of students around the cafés. Since it was early in the day and I had plenty of time I decided to explore the Dartmouth college campus and found a wonderful art museum on campus. They have a small collection of ancient art as well as European art and modern art. They have lockers for guests, so I was able to keep my backpack there and enjoy the museum. I had a really nice talk with the volunteer who is at the desk who lives here locally. One of the paintings was entitled ""New Hampshire"" and was done by a French artist who was living in the United States and was inspired by the White Mountains. On the way out of town was a food co-op and I had a smoothie and bought some cookies to eat and to pack out with me. It was nice to enjoy some thing a little different than all the trees, they'll am happy to be back amongst the trees and hear the church bells ringing in the distance.

Last evening Mike, Rick and I were planning to go up to watch the sunset and I realized that I left my rain gear hanging out to dry at the last shelter which is 6.5 miles back! This is rugged terrain. I planned low miles today so had considered hiking back, but thankfully, each morning the caretakers at each of the shelters and campsites communicate by radio. Andrew, who is the caretaker at our site, was able to contact Peter after their group call. And Peter found my rain gear and was coming halfway toward me anyway to meet someone at noon for a trail run for compost and so will bring it to me at the last hut 3 miles back. Whew.

Having pancake power, we took off down the trail and made great time for the first 5 miles. At that point we came to the Kennebec river where the official crossing is by canoe, and we were ferried across the river two at a time alternating with some other hikers both northbound and southbound. Everything went really smoothly there, and we continued our journey. We had one climb today that put us on top of Pleasant Pond mountain with excellent views, but most of the day was through the woods on relatively flat terrain. Yesterday I forgot to mention as I was coming into the camp there was a Northern Goshawk that has been swooping down and attacking hikers. My friends were ahead of me and did not experience it, but I heard it screeching and coming toward me and got my poles above my head and started waving them and yelling, and it turned away. That has been the talk of the trail for the last day or two as everybody keeps hearing about this hawk. Apparently there's another one in the hundred mile wilderness doing the same thing to hikers. At lunch today we stopped at a lake, and I got to jump in for a quick swim which was really refreshing. It has been good hiking with Mike and Rick and enjoying the fellowship.

We had a nice relaxing break at the next water source. It is starting to heat up for the day. Since there was another water source on the map 0.8 miles further up the mountain we decided to get just enough water to make it to there and then have lunch there. That was a key strategic mistake as it was a seasonal water source and dry when we got there. Because camp was 2 1/2 miles away with no water and it would be an additional 1.6 miles downhill and back up to get water and come back to camp in the southern direction, I decided to go back 1 mile and fetch water where we were before, enough to last enough for the rest of the day and this evening. Later I checked comments on our hiking app and two recent commenters said it was dry so I wish I had checked the app ahead of time.


Counting on an unreliable water source it is kind of like counting on an unreliable person.

I'm trying a new strategy to keep the bugs away. Today I walked through dozens of spiderwebs. Now I am leaving them on my hair, face and beard, and when the flies come for me they will get trapped!


Between sweat and rain I've been wet all day long. The rains yesterday thankfully recharged the water sources. That is a blessing.


Coming down off Bluff Mountain I was stung by a yellow and black striped insect. Right afterwards a yellow and black butterfly came flying up the trail toward me and flew over my left shoulder! How differently creatures act.


“For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; listen to my plea for grace. In the day of my trouble I call upon you, for you answer me. For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God.” Psalm‬ ‭86:5-7, 10‬ 



The Lord wants us to listen to Him as we pray and read His Word, yet it is wonderful to know He also listens to us.“Teach me your way, O Lord, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name.” ‭‭Psalm‬ ‭86:11‬

I was able to take care of my gear and clean things up and do a little bit of laundry and take a nap and finish a YouTube video.


Late afternoon the host took me to the area of town with a gear shop, grocery store, and barbecue restaurant. It is very helpful to get the rest and get off my feet.

It started with Tinker Cliffs in the early morning and then close to noon I got to McAfee knob. I was thankful to spend about 45 minutes there. Prior to getting up there I had only seen one trail runner and one hiker,. At the knob there were about 15 or 20 day hikers enjoying the view and eating picnics up there.

Contrast the evil man with David 


Said of the wicked who do not love:


“For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death.” Psalm‬ ‭109:16‬


Of David, a man after God's  own heart:


“With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord; I will praise him in the midst of the throng. For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from those who condemn his soul to death.” Psalm‬ ‭109:30-31‬


How well do I love?
Put your name everywhere you see the word ""love"" or ""it"" and let's see how we are doing loving others.


“Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.

“From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. “You do not want to leave too, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve. Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go?

Eagle Ike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657803,"This morning I received a blessing from John and Maria who were staying at the same shelter. I generally keep my food supply on the light side due to weight. They were finishing a section hike and gave me some snacks and an entire 2 person dehydrated meal packet. Wonderful.
It rained all morning.


When I stopped at the shelter for lunch today I met a young man named Travis ""Rain Song"" from Ohio. He had been waiting out the rain there for a couple of days. He is hiking with a guitar and has been on trail for about six weeks. As we talked I discovered he has recently come back to following Jesus. By the end of lunch the weather started to clear, and we both decided to hike onto the next shelter.


Two small black bear ran off as I was going down the trail this afternoon. These are the first bear I've seen in a couple of weeks.


At the end of the day in our shelter he brought out the guitar, and we sang worship songs and had church service together with two other ladies from a Christian hiking ministry. We had a prayer time. He then entertained us with a number of Bob Dylan style songs - guitar and harmonica.


“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” Psalm‬ ‭119:105‬


When hiking at night if I turn off my headlamp I can no longer keep going. It is to dangerous to try. So with the path of life. God's Word daily leads me. One day in my heavenly home He will be the light and there will be no darkness. Glorious day.","Deep Gap shelter

When the two ladies tenting nearby could not find a suitable branch for hanging their bags we offered to guard them in the shelter. Well we had intruders. No bear, but it was man v. mouse most of the night. At 2:30 am I could not sleep so put my ear buds in to listen to music. During that time a mouse ate a hole in and was getting food out of one of the ladies food bags. Somehow I awoke and heard it over the music and caught him red-pawed. I smacked the bag, and Mighty Mouse fell to the floor and scurried off. For the next hour it was a cat and mouse game as it kept coming back out, and I waited with headlamp and a hand broom. I got him once, but I finally was able to figure out a different, more secure way to hang the food. Sleep is optional when backpacking.Today was our first sunny day in Georgia. I enjoyed hiking part of the day with Travis. For the first time at one overlook I saw there were no further mountains in the distance. We are nearing the end of the Appalachians!

The hostel tonight served a full supper that was excellent. The company and conversation was enjoyable. There are also apple trees on the property with ripe fruit. Starting to celebrate a near finish.
“My eyes long for your salvation and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise.” Psalm‬ ‭119:123‬ 


God clearly spoke His love for me today. I was moved to healing tears listening to this song:


We pray for blessings
We pray for peace
Comfort for family, protection while we sleep
We pray for healing, for prosperity
We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering
And all the while, You hear each spoken need
Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things
'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?
What if Your healing comes through tears?
What if a thousand sleepless nights
Are what it takes to know You're near?
And what if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise?
We pray for wisdom
Your voice to hear
And we cry in anger when we cannot feel You near
We doubt Your goodness, we doubt Your love
As if every promise from Your Word is not enough
And all the while, You hear each desperate plea
And long that we'd have faith to believe
'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?
What if Your healing comes through tears?
And what if the thousand sleepless nights
Are what it takes to know You're near?
And what if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise?
When friends betray us
And when darkness seems to win
We know that pain reminds this heartThat this is not, this is not our homeIt's not our home
'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?
What if Your healing comes through tears?
And what if the thousand sleepless nights
Are what it takes to know You're near?
What if my greatest disappointments
Or the aching of this life
Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy
And what if trials of this life

The rain, the storms, the hardest nightsAre Your mercies in disguise?

Eagle Ike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657920,"What a day!


I had a wonderful stay at Above the Clouds hostel. Nimrod, who is a host, hiked the trail in 1980, and is a bit of a legend. I met Lee and his hiking buddy from Knoxville and two ladies from Charlotte, North Carolina as well as other people out hiking. It was good to share meals around the supper and breakfast table.


Quite hard to believe it is my last day on the trail as I am looking out over the foothills and plains of Georgia.


I saw one last black bear slowly climbing down a tree. It is always a treat to see such a magnificent animal. Then later another, and then later two more. Each time they were way up in trees, I think shaking off acorns. Then they would climb down the tree and scavenge. I enjoyed being able to observe them for awhile from a distance. If they saw me they ignored my presence.


From one of the overlooks today I could see Stone Mountain and the skyline of Atlanta.The weather was perfect for hiking, and the last mile was really special. My wife, Christy, drove 3 1/2 hours from Evans, registered and parked and climbed the 8 mile approach trail and arrived on the summit of Mt Springer to welcome me about 10 minutes before I arrived at 6:20 pm. I asked her to walk down towards me so we could walk the final steps together. The Lord so worked out that timing. It was just the two of us, and we greatly enjoyed our reunion and celebration on the summit. We did it! It is finished!After a good amount of time there, we went over and collected water, set up camp, and ate supper and dessert. 
Thank You Lord for working out all of this for our good and for keeping me safe and healthy. You have been faithful.“The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple. I open my mouth and pant, longing for your commands. Turn to me and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name. Direct my footsteps according to your word; let no sin rule over me.”‭‭Psalms‬ ‭119:130-133‬ ‭


God is ordering our steps if we will take time to listen to Him and follow His directions.


I love the message of this song - ""When it's all been said and done"" by Robin Mark.


When it's all been said and done

There is just one thing that mattersDid I do my best to live for truth
Did I live my life for you
When it's all been said and done
All my treasures will mean nothing
Only what I've done for love's reward
Will stand the test of time
Lord your mercy is so great

That you look beyond our weaknessAnd find purest gold in miry clay
Making sinners into saints
I will always sing your praise
Here on earth and ever after
For you've shown me Heaven's my true home
When it's all been said and done
You're my life when life is gone
When it's all been said and done

There is just one thing that mattersDid I do my best to live for truth
Did I live my life for you
Lord I'll live my life for you

Amicalola falls is quite impressive and a good way to end. After the picture at the famous stone arch we walked to our vehicle and made the journey home with a stop for supper in the public square of historic Dahlonega. 



Thanks everyone for your incredible support and prayers. I felt the Lord's hand on my daily steps, and met many wonderful people.

Eagle Ike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657994,"Lessons learned on the Appalachian Trail:



The heavenly Father loves me. Realizing I already have the treasure:
My salvation in Christ and His presence with me 




The hopeful message of an abundant life with Jesus

The beauty and wonder of my wife Christy and our family
The gift of Christian community and corporate worship
All that I already have is all that I need


To have a better relationship with my Father:
’How did Jesus do what he did? The answer is found in his relationship with the Father. How will we do the ‘greater things than these’ which Jesus promised (John 14:12)? By discovering the same relationship of intimacy, simplicity and obedience.'


To listen to my wife. Really listen.


To try to go out of my way to make someone else's day special. Ask, ""What can I do to make your day better?""


To seek collaboration and communication instead of forcing my way


To be content


To appreciate the little things. Any small act of kindness is a gift of love.


Not to be as competitive but to enjoy the ride


Work isn't so bad. A mix of work and play is very healthy. Any one of these days hiking would be a real treat on any given Saturday after a work week.


Fellowship is very sweet and corporate worship is a blessing


Not to worry so much


To love well
“Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭13:4-7‬


To be free:
You are free to know, love and serve God. You are free to use your life and energy to love others. You are free to be yourself. You can approach God with boldness (2 Corinthians 3:12). 


Having experienced personal restoration to pray for others and our nation:
""Lord, I cry out to you for restoration and revival. Would you restore your church in this country. Revive us again. May our nation turn back to you, begin to worship you again, enjoy your presence and, on our knees before you, see things from the right perspective.""


“Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away your indignation toward us! Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? Show us your steadfast love, O Lord, and grant us your salvation.”‭‭Psalm‬ ‭85:4, 6-7‬


Lord, thank you that you give me so many chances. Restore and revive me again, that I may rejoice in you.


To desire to live in holiness:

""The media is filled with stories of the rich, the beautiful and the strong. Our culture places these things on a pedestal and many of us aspire to achieve them. There is nothing wrong with these things – but they certainly don’t always lead to happiness. The French philosopher, Blaise Pascal, spoke of three orders of greatness. Riches, beauty and strength fall into his first category of superficial ‘physical greatness’. Above this is a higher, second level of greatness. It is the greatness of genius, science and art. The greatness of the art of Michelangelo or the music of Bach or the brilliance of Albert Einstein – these stand way above superficial physical greatness. However, according to Pascal there is a third kind of greatness – the order of holiness. (And there is an almost infinite qualitative difference between the second and the third categories.) The fact that a holy person is strong or weak, rich or poor, highly intelligent or illiterate, does not add or subtract anything because that person’s greatness is on a different and almost infinitely superior plane. It is open to every one of us to achieve true greatness in the order of holiness. The word ‘holy’ (hallowed, holiest, holiness) appears over 500 times in the Bible. God is holy. He gives you his Holy Spirit to sanctify you, and you are called to share in his holiness. The word ‘saints’ means ‘holy ones’. In the New Testament it is applied to all Christians. You are ‘called to be holy’ (1 Corinthians 1:2). Holiness is a gift you receive when you put your trust in Jesus, receive his righteousness and the gift of the Holy Spirit. Seek to live out a holy life in grateful response to God’s gift, through the imitation of Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit. Ultimately, only holiness leads to happiness.""  Nicky Grumbel
