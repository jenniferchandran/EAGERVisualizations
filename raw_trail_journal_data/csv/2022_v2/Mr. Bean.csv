Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649176,"Going through my gear, picking out what I'm taking this time.  Every trail requires different stuff.  I'm anticipating a fair amount of rain this time so I'm taking a tarp in addition to my tent.  I think the extra 8 oz for the tarp is worth it.  I'm not an ultra lite hiker and my base weight is somewhere just under 15 pounds.  The only DCF gear I have are my tent and tarp.  I've seen several DCF packs get really beat up after hiking only 700 miles. My ULA packs are 14-15 yrs old and are still looking great. I've had to replace some buckles from time to time, but that's a cheap fix.  I'm getting older, losing muscle mass, and stamina definitely not as good as last year.  Hoping I can do the 16-20 miles/day on this section hike.  We shall see. My gear is basically the same as my AZT thruhike gear so I won't repeat listing that.  It's definitely different from my section Hike of the AT in 2016.  I did not keep an online journal for that hike (but did keep a paper journal), but am thinking about posting it. You may simply look at my AZT thru hike to get details on my gear.  I don't think I'll carry any paper maps this time, but will carry a compass anyway.",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Tue",0
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649224,"Did various things today.  Sanded rust off an old, large pipe clamp.  That took about a hour or so.  Then tried to clean and lubricate my sander but ran into problems reassembling it: the motor brushes were spring loaded and I wasn't able to reinstall the motor because I wasn't able to push the brushes back in.  Then Mark picked me up to play golf.  After I came home I was able to reinstall the motor. Then put everything back together. The sander started right up and I had no extra parts laying around. Then proceeded to go through my gear again, trying to familiarize myself with the tent set up, quilt set up. Then looked at the mileage data that KJ had put together. Looks like he's going to take it easy on us: No 20 mile days!!!   :) :) :)  Still have to work out the shuttling of cars with Shoelace but we'll figure it out.  I booked a room for Shoelace and myself in Damascus.  We'll reach there in about 2 1/2 days.  It's past  midnite and I fly out in about 20 hours.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Wed",0
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649271,"Did some last minute checks of gear.  Still have to soak/wet my water filter. Maybe tomorrow or at the Boots off Hostel.  This acts to prime the filter so when I actually use it it will flow better.
Rechecked the resupply strategy, but that is still not written in stone.  I think we are pretty set from the beginning on 4/22 to when we reach Marion, VA on 4/29.  Looks like there will be 7 of us in our merry group.  I guess some will sleep in shelters and some will use their tents.  Sometimes shelters have a lot of mice so I might elect to sleep in my tent, unless the weather is really bad.  Thankfully KJ is being relatively easy on us. He'll have more than 428 miles under his belt by the time he gets to the Boots Off Hostel (where we start).  Boots off is at mile 428 or so, but he did the Benton Mackaye trail from Amicalola Falls State Park to the I-40 crossing near Davenport Gap, and that was already 290 miles (where the AT and Benton Mackaye Trail rejoin).  So in total, maybe 460 miles or so under his belt when we meet up with him.  He's mapped out our 8 days with him and there are no 20+ mile days! Yay!.  Perhaps 14-16 or so with a bunch of 7 and 10 mile days.  Thank you KJ.Shoelace drove to Florida to pick up a trailer for a client. He dropped it off at a friend's home in Richmond, VA and tomorrow he's picking me up in Roanoke. When he drives home he'll deliver the trailer to his client in Maine. 
Flying out in a few hours from now.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Wed",0
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649351,"6 hr flight to Dallas then 3 hr flight to Charlotte NC.  My layover in Charlotte was 30 minutes but I ran like Foest Gump to my gate. Miraculously my checked bag came through. Shoelace picked me up.  Happy Warrior and hs grandson Bubba were waiting in their jeep.  We drove to the Quarter Way Inn hostel on VA 610 and left Happy Warriors jeep there. The  owner Tina asked us to transport a jar of honey to the owner of Boots Off Hostel.  Pretty cool. We will use Happy Warrior's vehicle to get back to Shoelace's car (which will be parked at the start of the hike at Boots Off Hostel.  We are now settled in at Boots Off in Tennessee.  Cupcake and Rambo grilled hamburgers for us.lThe drive through the Virginia countryside is just beautiful. Blossoms are coming out. Spring is here.  I like this hostel.  Nice bunkers, latrine, and they have supplies. It's good to see Cupcake, Rambo, and KJ again.  The weather is supposed to be nice.  I'm really tired after this flight.  Looking forward to hiking.",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Thu",0
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649360,"Started hiking a 8 am. We slowly rose above the western shore of Lake Watauga, then crossed over Watauga Dam. From there it was a lot of ups and downs: over 5000 feet of elevation gain.  I took it slowly and endeavored to rest each hour.  It was a little hot.  I filtered 3 liters of water , then walked into camp. Several hikers were already there, and later the rest of our group trickled in.  We are all quite tired. It's 8:14 pm and I'm gong to sleep!","Boots Off Hostel at mile 428 near Watauga Lake
",Iron Mountain Shelter,"Apr 22, Fri",16
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649536,"Well, today was relatively easier but it was still 16 mile and ""only"" about 3600 ft in elevation gain. Trail tread was much gentler. We started hiking by 8 am. Most of us filtered water at a very good spring near the hiway 91 but I had lots of water.  We crossed a beautiful meadow/bald and that was the first highlight of the day.  We ate lunch and filtered water at the Double Springs Shelter. 7 years ago Shoelace and Happy Warrior met at this very shelter, so they reminisced fondly about this,  I am getting to know Rambo and Cupcake (aka Yard Sale) much better.  They both grew up together and have known each other since about the third grade.  They are both 32 and are really good hikers. Being pretty big guys they are intimidating at first  but turn out to be very thoughtful, kind human beings. They could easily outhike us but they make sure everyone was safe and will stay in back of the pack if things go wrong.  Looks like Happy  Warrior and his grandson Bubba will end early tomorrow at Damascus. Happy Warrior thru hiked the AT in 2015 but today he had some serious cramping in his legs and thighs.  Their car is parked at the end (quarter way hostel) but his wife Tricia will drive down and pick them up. Another unexpected  highlight  of the day was trail magic at Low Gap.  Lunch ( AT 2014) and a bunch of other people that thru-hiked the AT in years past drove from New York and set up a barbecue with drinks.  I got into camp at the Abingdon Shelter at about 5:30. I decided not to set up my tent but chickened out and set up my tarp instead.  Tomorrow we hike 10 miles into Damascus and cross over from Tennessee into Virginia. I've reserved a room there for me and Shoelace.","Iron Mtn shelter 
",Abingdon Shelter ,"Apr 23, Sat",16
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649555,"For some reason I didn't sleep that well last nite.  It didn't rain so I really didn't need to set up the tarp.   We set out at 8:06 and maintained a 2.5 mph pace.  It was only 10 miles into Damascus.  Yardsale and Rambo got there in about 3.5 hrs and were waiting with Yardsale's truck.  They had drinks and snacks. We went to the motel and left our stuff there. Yardsale and Shoelace drove to the Boots Off hostel to get Shoelace's truck.  From there Yardsale drove back to Damascus and picked up Rambo and went back to Alexandria.  Shoelace stopped at a gas station in Tennessee  for fuel and a drink.  He was having a pleasant conversation with the attendant until the attendant asked him for his driver's license. .  Being from Maine he told him , ""promise not to laugh"".  When he saw Shoelace's license he told him , ""you're a damn yankee"". Then said  nothing more to him.  By the time Shoelace came back we were all checked into the Damascus Inn.  Then, Happy Warrior, his wife Tricia (who had driven down to pick him and Bubba up), Bubba,  Shoelace and I ate dinner at the Wicked Chicken restaurant.  Plan is to drive to Abingdon tomorrow to zero,  resupply,  do laundry tomorrow and hike out of Damascus on 4/26.  (We would have preferred to stay in Damascus but there was no room availability and no laundry facilities. )  At that point it will just be 3 of us: Shoelace,  me, and KJ.
I am tired but not injured. My right boot failed on the trail into Damascus.   I have about 900 miles on these boots.  I did pack an extra pair of shoes in Shoelace's truck. I have no blisters  and I am very thankful for all of that.  Moreover I am very thankful to be hiking with some great friends.","Abingdon Shelter 
",Motel in Damascus ,"Apr 24, Sun",10
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649613,"Nice breakfast at the Damascus Old Mill Inn. Then drove about 30 minutes to Abingdon and checked in to the motel. Nice day, walked in downtown Abingdon.  Ate lunch at a barbecue place Shoelace had previously eaten,  then went to Walmart to do grocery shopping.   Came back to the motel and wanted our gear, then dinner at an Italian place, then ice cream. Now back in motel making last minute adjustments,  including motel reservations for our stay 5 days from now. It's going to rain tomorrow and it's going to be 17 miles but we should be under tree cover.  Had we hiked out yesterday we would be hiking in rain in exposed country.  It's just the 3 of us now: KJ, Shoelace and me.  Tomorrow we drive back to Damascus,  leave Shoelace's truck there and begin hiking.","Motel in Damascus

Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649795,"Rain was in the forecast for today. We had breakfast at the motel, then Shoelace drove us to Damascus and parked his car at the library parking lot. We started hiking at 8:06.  KJ took the AT. Shoelace and I took the Virginia Creeper trail.  The Creeper trail was beautiful.  There were multiple beautiful bridge crossings.  After about 12 miles the Creeper trail and AT rejoined and we then took the AT to the Lost Mtn shelter.  It rained quite hard for a few hours. I was using my umbrella and ULA rain skirts and was pretty dry except for my feet. 
It's cold. I can see my breath. Today we  met people from the  Boston area

",Lost mountain shelter ,"Apr 26, Tue",17
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649799,"It was cold, but not enough to freeze last nite. Nonetheless I began hiking with gloves and a jacket. At the White mtn road a marine ""Mcsquatch"" and his friend Shortcash had trail magic set up.  I had a beautiful breakfast burrito and a cup of hot chocolate. We went over 2 mountains: first White Top, then Mt Rogers.  We were in the Grayson Highlands and had magnificent vistas. We saw the ponies. They were very tame.  I went through the fat man's squeeze.  It was pretty tight.  Met 2 medical students that were moving on to their residencies: one in Anesthesia and one in  Neurology.  They were doing a loop hike in that area and would return to their car tomorrow.  It's cold. I'm tired and the trail was quite rocky at times.  In addition there was a fair amount of elevation losses and gains.  The trail was  very rocky coming down from Mt. Rogers.
Braveheart rolled in. A relative died suddenly from a heart attack.  She's hiking 20 miles tomorrow in order to get to Marion in 2 days and go to a funeral in Tennessee.
I'm REALLY tired. My muscles all ache. I haven't had any cramping.   Oh yeah. I really messed up at the end of the day.   When I was filtering water I didn't hook up my filter and the water ran straight from my dirty water bag to my clean water bag. I caught my mistake when I noticed the water was draining really fast. That contaminated my lines and clean water bag.  So, I  waited for Shoelace to show up and used his aqua Mira to sterilize the system. That cost me 2 hours. Oh well at least it wasn't unsolvable.","Lost mountain shelter 
",Wise shelter,"Apr 27, Wed",17
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649802,"Today was supposed to be a relatively easy day.  However my muscles were very tired from yesterday and it was a cold day.  Thank goodness we had clear weather. Just a lot of ups and downs today.  We did have spectacular views.   We did arrive at the shelter at 3:30 so we had more time to set stuff up,  filter water, etc.  I have a cell signal so I can catch up on my Journaling. It's going to be cold again tonight. Glad I'm in a shelter.
KJ and Shoelace are doing well. I'm stiff and tired. A bath would be nice.","Weise shelter
",Hurricane shelter,"Apr 28, Thu",11
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649957,"The Hurricane Shelter is a very nice shelter. The corners are dovetailed! There are hurricane clips. As with the shelters I've seen in Virginia so far, there are privys and bear boxes.
Double Great (former army special forces) the brother and sister and another hiker left the shelter at about 7:30.  I think they were trying to hike to the Partnership shelter 19 miles away. This shelter has a shower and is close to hiway 16 where hikers can actually order pizza. I took off at 9 am and Shoelace and KJ left shortly after. After hiking 3 miles of very easy trail I almost took a wrong turn where the AT takes a sharp right and the Dickey Gap trail goes straight. Really easy hiking after that and I met a couple with a dog hiking in the opposite direction. I shortly came to a road and parking lot.  A hiker (Brazil) had lost her hiking friend Potato Chip. They had camped near the Hurricane shelter last nite and started hiking about 7:30. Brazil hiked on ahead and came to this road and had been waiting there for over 45 minutes. The woman, husband and dog returned and offered to help but it wasn't clear what they could do.  There was no cell signal. Potato Chip had no map  compass or hiking phone app to navigate by.  Another couple in a car also stopped to help so we hiked on. As it turned out another hiker had missed the same Dickey Gap jct, hiked down the Dickey gap trail and found Potato Chip. He had the Far Out App and eventually realized his mistake.  So they eventually got to the Dickey Gap/VA 650 trailhead where I found Brazil.
We passed thru the usual forests then passed thru a beautiful meadow. 0.5 miles before our campsite we filtered water. Tomorrow we'll hike about 7 miles to the road where hikers order pizza and take a shuttle into Marion where we have reservations at the Red Roof Inn. The next day Shoelace and I will shuttle back to Damascus and pick up his truck. From there we'll drive back to Marion to say goodbye to KJ and Shoelace will drop me off in Roanoke. It's been a hard hike because I wasn't in shape. However my trail legs are returning and my hiker hunger is also returning.....at the end of my hike.  I've enjoyed hiking with these guys. They are good human beings.
It's supposed to rain tonite.  I've set up my tarp above my tent.
oh yeah. Another oops tonite. I hung a bear line for all of us. However one one of my attempts the line wrapped itself several times around the branch.  I tried using a long branch to untangle it. On one of those attempts at untangling it the branch got caught in the cordage and I fell to the ground still hanging on to my branch.  Fortunately that action tugged on the line and pulled it down closer to me. So I repeatedly used the branch to pull the rest of it down,  then was able to successfully hang a good line to secure our food bags using the PCT hang method.","Hurricane shelter
",Campsite 7 miles south of Mt Roger's Recreation Visitor Center ,"Apr 29, Fri",13
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649959,"It did rain last nite but not enough to get the ground wet.  Last nite I heard some very heavy footsteps walking thru our campsite but was too scared to look and see what it was. Of course I thought it was a bear but I'll never know.   I woke up at 5:45 am and was hiking by 7 am.  KJ had gotten up earlier and retrieved our food bags for us.  Shoelace and KJ left shortly thereafter.  We had to be at the Visitor center near the Partnership shelter by 11 am to meet a pre-arranged shuttle. The hike was quite easy with gentle trailtread. I was there at about 9:30 and waited for my friends.  Babyshark and her brother were still there and were hiking on to the Alpaca farm hostel which was about 11 miles away in Atkins. Oh did I mention this shelter had a shower?  Well, the shower was there but it wasn't working. Not water. Something was wrong with the fixture so the water was turned off.
There's a landline phone at the Visitor center and hikers at the Partnership shelter use this free landline to call for Pizza.
Our shuttle showed up promptly at 11 and took us to our motel in Marion.  A hot shower and a huge Mexican (really good) meal in Marion and we are now quite content.   KJ was able to get his resupply box at the post office by 12 noon so now all is well. I fly home in 2 days.  My trail legs and hiker hunger are definitely back but it's time to go home.","Campsite 7 miles south of Mt Roger's Recreation Visitor Center 
",Mt Rogers Recreation Visitor center ,"Apr 30, Sat",7
Mr. Bean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650034,"KJ, Shoelace and I bought breakfast at a nearby gas station/convenience store.  They actually had a decent assortment of foods. I bought oj, yogurt, and a blueberry muffin. We took our food and ate in the lobby of our motel. (The Red Roof Inn in Marion didn't serve breakfast.)  The Mt Roger's shuttle picked us up at 8:30, dropped KJ off at the laundromat, and took me and Shoelace back to Shoelace's truck in Damascus. From there we drove back to Marion to get KJ. We ate lunch at Macado's in Marion. The memorabilia consisting of actors and musicians was very interesting.  It was formerly the town post office and our waitress Bonnie was quite knowledgeable about local history.  She informed us that Marion was where Mountain Dew came from.  After lunch we dropped off KJ at the General Francis Hotel in Marion. His plan is to stay there today, then shuttle back to the trailhead at the Mt. Rogers Rec visitor center.  Shoelace then drove me to the Quality Inn near the Roanoke airport and headed on to Happy Warrior's house further north to eat dinner and retrieve the trailer that he picked up in Key West, Florida. He's headed back to his snow covered home in Maine.  Tomorrow I fly home.
Thoughts on  some of my gear this trek:  
10 deg Enlightened eqt quilt:  not really tested in freezing temperatures but even on warm nights it was very easy to adjust so that I was neither too hot nor too cold.  It was very easy to turn from side to side.  I did not need to use the straps as it didn't get too cold. I think the coldest it got was perhaps 40 degrees.  I am definitely using this in my future hikes.
Nemo tensor mattress: very warm and comfortable. Very easy to deflate quickly and pack. I didn't like the inflation method as it took me a while to use the bag to inflate the mattress. I don't like to blow into it and prefer to use ambient air.  I don't like the moisture in my breath to get into my mattress. It's a few oz heavier than my thermarest neoair but it's much more comfortable when lying on my side and it's much more quiet.
Tarptent Aeon Li:  very satisfied with ease of set up,  weight (19 oz) and headroom and footroom.
ZPACKS 8x10 dcf tarp.  Getting easier to set up. Definitely worth the 8 oz if you expect rain.
ULA rainskirt:  boy this rocks. It's very light and kept my lower body dry (except my feet and ankles). Any rain runoff from my umbrella or pack ran down my skirt.
Old pocket rocket stove:  I went with this as opposed to an alcohol stove because the stove, fuel canister, lighter all fit into my Evernew pot.  Not as efficient as a jetboil or MSR wind burner or reactor stoves but I didn't care since one 4 oz canister was more than adequate for my entire trip. 
6MD Umbrella: totally worth the 7 or so oz.
Shoes: I started with my Keen boots (they had about 900 miles on them) but the right shoe gave out after hiking about 40 miles into this trip. I had a pair of New Balance trail runners waiting for me in Damascus (in my resupply package in Shoelace's truck). This pair had only about 50 miles on them and worked very well. They were much lighter than my boots. They were purchased for $60 in Maine in 2016 when another old pair of hiking boots failed after 50 miles in the Hundred Mile Wilderness. 
Hilltop dcf food bag:  it's waterproof   light, and packs nicely. Never used this b4 but love this bag with the printed honeybees. 
Dynaglide cordage to hang foodbag: I bought this from Dutchware gear.
This is the first time I hung my food. I wasn't willing  to carry the 2 lb bear canister. The cord is strong and slippery. Love this. I learned the PCT method using a carabiner.  Will use this method again in future unless bear canisters are required.",,View Entry,"May 01, Sun",0
