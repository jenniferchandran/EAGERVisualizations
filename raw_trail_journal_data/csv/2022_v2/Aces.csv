Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647383,"My first backpacking trip nearly ended in disaster. This was a few years after college, when I was living in Columbus, Oh (okay, technically it was like five miles outside Columbus) with some old college friends. Up until that time, most of my mountain hiking was relegated to long strenuous day hikes. I had the system down pat: I would search out a mountain range, any mountain range really, within no more than a day’s drive away from central Ohio (note: it turns out mountains are quite far away from central Ohio). I’d head out alone. Down to the Smokies. Or Catskills. The Adirondacks. The Shenandoah’s. Anywhere really. This was just after college, when life was confusing and uncertain, and looking back, I think these trips provided a level of solitude and isolation that I clearly craved----solitude and isolation not to discover a future direction for myself (things rarely worked out that easy, I knew) but more so to at least not have to think about that confusion and uncertainty I was feeling.

Somewhere in the course of these experiences, I was overtaken by a thought of powerful logic that would make even old Socrates proud.

Me: You say you like hiking for the sense of isolation and solitude it provides... Do you know what would provide even more isolation and even more solitude than hiking a mountain during the day? Hiking several mountains during a period of several days.  Even my post-graduate self knew a great thought when I heard it. “Eureka,” I said (I didn’t actually say “Eureka”), and thus began my headlong dive into the world of backpacking.

Unfortunately, my run of great critical thinking didn’t last for a particularly long time. As I chose for my first backpacking trip one of the toughest hikes you could do (the Presidential Traverse), in one of the most challenging environments in the continental USA (the White Mountains). The hike itself is only 23 miles, but it involves summiting ten different mountains, at a total clip of nearly 9K in elevation gain (Werner, Section Hiker). All this in an environment that can best be described as some sadist’s attempt at creating the perfect storm of conditions for causing hypothermia and exposure. A beautiful New England summer day at the base of the mountains very quickly turns into an experience akin to stepping fully-clothed into a cold shower, while enmeshed in a bitter wind (On a side note, the mts. are also quite breath-taking, and may be the closest thing I will ever get to being on Mars or the moon. I highly recommend). 
 Decision-making is a funny thing----I’ve found throughout the course of my life that the biggest decisions I’ve had to make (such as choosing a college), I thought about quite little when making the decision. Alternatively, it has been the smallest, most- lowest stakes of choices that have caused the most painful reflection and anxiety on my part. Should I go out to dinner? What movie do I want to see on Netflix? Even the process of buying a six pack of craft beer causes a tremendous amount of paralysis, as I stare at the fridgeful of options, inspecting one beer after another as an owner might inspect a prized racehorse before the day of the race. All this to say I’m not quite sure why I chose the Whites for hiking, but the rigorous analytical skills I applied to purchasing craft beer did not take effect here. 

A few compatriots from college decided to join me for this hike (hey, maybe they are even reading this now!). Looking back, my preparation was actually quite impressive in the sheer scope of consecutive bad decisions I made. Buy an excessively large backpack that was too heavy? Check! Buy a sleeping bag (also heavy) that wasn’t warm enough? Check! Never actually use any of these items in the field? Yes, that’s a check too! Hey, should I bring a rain jacket? Of course not!! Luckily, heading into the hike, my friends were much better prepared, and more experienced, than I was.

The results in the Whites went about as well you would expect, as I didn’t even last a day. First the tiredness started: wearing a pack too heavy, climbing terrain I wasn’t prepared for, I made Sisyphean levels of progress on the trail (no disrespect to Sisyphus). Then the cramping started, kicked off no doubt by all that exhaustion and dehydration. Later we got caught in a deluge of cold rain; and the chills & cold hit next so bad that I felt as though my body was seizing up. I had no way to stop the cold, so after a while, a certain sort of fogginess and mental despair set in. In all my arrogance of youth, I never felt so human. 
We somehow reached the summit of Mount Washington at the tail-end of the day. Mt. Washington is a weird place. It has the distinction of being the tallest and deadliest mountain in the Whites (sources vary, but approximately 160 people have died up there, RIP, “Mt. Washington’s fatalities”), while also having a visitor center & throngs of tourists at the summit (where said tourists can buy car decals that say, “My Car Made It Up Mount Washington!”). There is a gift store, where you can buy over-priced hoodies and shirts (which also reference said Mount Washington). There is a cafeteria, where you can buy warm food. There is also a little train, that will take you from the base of the mountain to the summit, then back to the base, with tickets starting at the low, low price of $49. 
I shouldn’t kid on the latter part, as that train got me out what can best be described as a fairly massive Costco-sized container of jam (that’s the correct use of the idiom, right?).  True to dramatic fashion, we arrived at the summit shortly before the last train was set to depart for the day. Missing this train meant going back outside, in the growing cold and darkness, stumbling through the fog in search of a campsite a few miles away, to setup a tent I’d only setup once before, to sleep in a not-warm enough sleeping bag that may already have been damp (of course, I also didn’t bring dry bags with me on the trip). I didn’t know what would occur should this option be pursued, just bad things. I had already lost a large amount of body heat, and I had no immediate way of getting warm or dry. Getting on the train would mean ending the trip after less than a day. It would mean defeat. It would mean shame. Of course, even with my questionable decision-making skills, it wasn’t much of a decision to make. We took the train. 
Today, as I set out shortly on my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail, I think back frequently to this hike, which I consider my education in backpacking. It reminds me of Hope----at the kindness I received from friends & strangers during that low, low time up on the mountains. It brings me Respect and Awe---for the mighty forces of Nature that must be properly prepared and accounted for. It brings me Thankfulness---at the opportunity to receive second chances. But mostly, it reminds of Love, because even after this worst of experiences, the mountains have continued to call for me, and I have always tried my best to respond to the call.

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647813,"It is a regular trope of thru hikers to share out a gear list they will be hiking with before their trip. Partially, I suppose this is for very “Last Supper-ish” reasons----ie., one last chance to assemble and admire the new, shiny gear before it gets the very hell beaten out of it on the trail (can’t wait!). 
Part of this share out process also has a very practical reason, as well. Picking out hiking gear is a very tough and stressful process, especially if you are (ahem) an individual inclined to over-analyze decisions. Think of it like this: you are making literally dozens of purchasing decisions, spending thousands of dollars, on items that very well could determine the success of your hike (and potentially life or death), while making said decisions based on the reviews and opinions of complete strangers on the Internet. What could go wrong!!!

In this way, hiking gear lists serve as a useful shorthand to help simplify the process. After all, who else better to listen to than someone who has actually thru hiked before? However, blindly following someone else’s gear list is no fun (and potentially very uncool). Below is the “Austin Poyar Magical Formula for Picking Out Hiking Gear in Just 4 Simple Steps!” trademarked process:


Step 1: Pick a side
I was a history major in college, and my absolute least favorite aspect of the major was having to engage in the historiography of the subject----wading through the endless obscure and fickle academic arguments that scholars would have on the narrowest of topics. 
Alas, picking out hiking gear is very much like being a history major in college. One must make a bevy of either-or-decisions in areas where there are outspoken proponents and opponents on each side. Should I go with a sleeping bag or quilt? Inflatable sleeping pad or foam pad? Single-wall or double-wall tent? The list goes on and on. One must dive head-first into these debates and pick the options that seem the most sensible to them. To quote my brother’s high school commencement speech, “here’s to choosing wisely.” 
Step 2: Choose a Budget
Rats, this should probably be step #1… Identify a budget you can work with, which can then inform the “sides” you choose in the Great Hiking Debate. Estimates for what a cheap budget gear list cost varies, but $750-$1K seems reasonable. A budget with more expensive gear may cost around $2K, as a ballpark figure. If you are just starting out backpacking, I’d recommend beginning with the budget choices. As you use this gear, you can (1) gauge whether you like backpacking before spending further, and (2) after use, have a greater understanding of gear preferences. 
Step 3: Hone your gear pack
Even after all your frenzied research on gear, you will make many, many bad purchasing decisions. What are the odds! Many of these decisions will seem quite logical at the time, before revealing their true nature in the field. One example here (although I could cite four or five):

Like most humans, I like coffee (and preferably hot, too!). One of my first backpacking trips was to the High Peaks of the Adirondacks. In order to save money and weight, I decided I did not need to bring a stove. No hot water. My coffee plan consisted of pouring a few Folger’s Insta packets into a fairly ratty-looking Smart water bottle, shaking the bottle like a demon, and then voila, coffee! The coffee was fizzing. And I was drinking this thing at like 6am in the cold morning. For three mornings straight. Oh no, never again. 
 Step 4: All good gear must come to an end 
If you were to ask me what I am most anxious about on the trip, it is not about being out in the woods for 6 months. It is not about achieving a state of almost incomprehensible funk and grime. The particular form of anxiety I have centers on my gear breaking down and failing me. It is quite ridiculous. I obsess over even the tiniest of scuffs or imperfections on any item. I damn near had a heart attack when there was a single loose thread on my pack cover---and then instantly ran to get my Mom’s help (I am not proud).  
 

Despite these anxieties, I know instinctively that failure and setbacks are normal. More than that, it is a part of being human. Most things tend to work out, even when it seems hopeless in the moment. This from experience I know to be true. Hiking gear is only helpful to the extent that the hiker wearing the gear is strong in purpose; all else takes a backseat. God, I hope to remember that on the trail.

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648151,"Breathing is an underrated thing. Something pivotal for survival yet taken absolutely for granted during the 20,000 or so breaths we inhale, exhale on any given day. On the eve of my Appalachian Trail hike, as I reflect on why I am undertaking this damn crazy hike before me, I find myself reflecting more and more on the importance of breathing. 
You see, I first contemplated thru hiking the Appalachian Trail many years ago. Maybe it was the quixotic nature of the challenge that first attracted me, the sheer impossibility of it. Maybe it was the romantic nature of being lost in the woods for months at a time. Hell, maybe I am just using this as cover to grow the World’s Largest Blond-Colored Beard (a very underrated color of beard). 
However it happened, the thought of hiking the AT stuck and never went away. Of course, like many tasks of such a scope and intensity, my immediate reaction was to wilt when confronted at the true size and cost of the journey. And so, years went by, and a certain type of rhythm formed; this was to be the year I hiked the AT, until it wasn’t. Because I wasn’t ready. Or it wasn’t the right time in my life. You get the picture. But still, the thought never went away. 
And now, dear reader (note how reader is in the singular), we reach the present year. And this really was going to be the magical year.  I knew my thoughts about hiking the AT would never go away unless I, you know, actually went and did it. Over the past few years I had prepared by taking a variety of backpacking trips, purchasing and honing my gear, saving up money. Perhaps most importantly, I even made motivational lists! These lists included reasons why I was hiking the AT, how I would feel when I accomplished the hike, what I would feel were I not to succeed. I taped these to my apartment wall (actually one of the nicer things on my wall) and looked over them every single day. And funnily enough, after doing all these things, the vast chasm separating me from the Appalachian Trail didn’t seem quite so wide. I had it in me to do this damn crazy thing. I knew I could.  

And then I got COVID. 
I got all the classic symptoms, a true smorgasbord of 21st century COVID delight: grinding headache, fever, lack of energy, lack of taste or smell. What scared me the most was the breathing, though. I’d try inhaling oxygen, but no matter how deep I tried breathing, I could never get enough; it was akin to trying to clear a parched throat with a few dribbles of water. And so, something as underrated and unconscious as breathing quickly took its rightful place at the forefront of my mind. 
To be clear, I had only a moderate case of COVID. Others have suffered in ways I can't begin to comprehend. And luckily for me, the bad largely went away fairly quickly. Except for the breathing; and for months at a time, spells of breathing difficulty and chest pain would continue to occur at even the most routine of physical exercise: playing tennis, running a few miles, walking up a particularly steep hill. With my hike now  being anything but a given, I clung desperately to it. 
My breathing is back to normal now. 
But it was in those small moments that I knew such taken-for-granted things in life---the notion of time, of good health, of the future----truly shouldn’t be taken for granted, because all was imperceptibly in flux, all really could imperceptibly change. To quote Yeats' famous poem The Second Coming, ""things fall apart."" And the only way to truly respond to this fact is to do your best---if you are lucky enough to have the opportunity--- to pursue now what you find most meaningful in life (and yes, I realize my great epiphany is also a fairly large cliché). 
The next time you hear from me I will be on the Trail. And when I think of my time, I will think of the following: that some people measure their progress on the Appalachian Trail in the number of footsteps, or miles. Others in time spent away from loved ones. I will be measuring in number of breaths.",,View Entry,"Apr 01, Fri",0
Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648366,"Forgive me Reader, let me start off by saying I am one of those obnoxious people who always feel the need to loudly proclaim to all the world when he gets a good deal. And so, I must insist in telling you before I begin, I only spent $86 on my one-way flight to Atlanta to begin my thru hike.  Sufficiently impressed?
Let’s begin. My long-awaited travel day has come and gone, and it has not gone quite as I had planned. As a celebration of this, I thought I would share three strange things that occurred today:Strange Thing #1: Holy S****. A positive flight experience! Let me clue you in on a wonderful little secret: Delta is a great airline. Supporting Arguments: there is WiFi on board, I could charge my phone, it was a smooth flight despite turbulent weather (more on that later), friendly stewards (not always to be assumed), and most importantly, LARGE overhead storage bins onboard. This latter point is particularly key, as all hikers flying with gear go through the age-old dilemma of deciding whether to check their backpack on the back of the plane, or taking it onboard. Technically, most hiking backpacks are too big to take on planes, and I’ve had experience with previous flights where my backpack wouldn’t fit in the overhead bin, leaving one with the unpleasant duty/responsibility of taking the walk of shame up to the front of the plane to gate check the damn thing (maneuvering all the while past angry passengers lined through the aisle). Of course, bag checking your gear leaves you with the dreaded potential of the airline either (a) losing your gear, or (b) beating the hell out of your gear so much you wish it was lost. Dear Reader, I took a chance—I was bold, nay I was audacious—and damn if it didn’t pay off in the ample bosom of the Delta overhead storage bin.
Strange Thing #2. For once, when leaving Cleveland, Ohio, the weather of the place I was going to was worse than the place I was leaving. Atlanta, and the entire South, was in the midst of being hit by a fairly large wallop of a storm, and hard cold rain pored over the area, leaving one to believe that Atlanta had never ever been so Cleveland, Ohio-esque. Once I arrived in Atlanta, the plan was to take the MARTA (a fancy name for Atlanta’s public transportation) to the northernmost station, whereby my shuttle driver AT Survivor Dave would pick me up and drive me 1.5 hours north to the Appalachian Trail starting point. However, upon getting on the MARTA train, then calling my shuttle driver saying “I’m getting on the MARTA train”, he strongly advised I postpone for tomorrow due to weather, and hole up near the station at a cute little boutique hotel called the Comfort Inn. And what could a poor potential thru hiker due, when in the midst of such blazing cold hard rain, but all to happily oblige?  Strange Thing #3, Oasis in the Suburbs. The boutique Comfort Inn I stayed at was in the town of Roswell, GA. For those who like suburbs, Roswell GA is a smorgasbord of delight. Strip mall after strip mall lined the main street of Holcomb Bridge Rd, with business names such as Smoothie King, Wings 101, and JP Sushi. I saw two (2!) massage parlors in the same strip mall (or at least the same business was advertised twice in the signage). But lo and behold, in the midst of such suburban sprawl, a micro-brewery existed. I made the tenuous walk alongside the endless highway, treading on little-used sidewalks. The whole town sounded angry, or at the least just anxious as shit to get home from work: after every block you could hear the honking of car horns, the roar of ignitions. But then finally, my microbrewery…called From The Earth Brewing Co, where I sat for a delightful few hours drinking craft beer in blissful peace, eavesdropping on the conversations of others. Oh, I also ate a chicken sandwich. And I contemplated whether I should ask the bartender how much he would give me if I carried their custom brewery beer coaster all the way with me to Maine (I chickened out). And there I also sat, thinking about the hike that never was today, and hoping for the hike that would be tomorrow. Then I got the check, and before making my way back to the good old Comfort Inn, I saw I had spent $50 on a sandwich and a few drinks. Damn.",,View Entry,"Apr 05, Tue",0
Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648743,"The first week on the AT is officially in the books! (Okay, technically the first six days, but who is counting). With that being said, I thought I might pass onto you, dear reader, a few hard-won lessons learned from the trail during my first week. 
 ◦ Lesson #1: Learn how to use a zip tie before the trail, or that will be your trail name. Umm so yeah, that is my trail name. Technically I got this before I was even on the damn trail. You see, the AT is a little like freshman year in college (except with bears!) with one point of similarity being an orientation for beginners (where you learn how not to get eaten…by bears!). As part of this orientation, they give out AT tags to put on your backpack. They also give you a zip tie to attach said tag to your backpack. Dear reader, I confess…the use of zip ties is not in my proverbial wheelhouse. And so, after several minutes of trying to attach the damn zip tie to my backpack, in a moment of blind panic and desperation, I ran for help to the orientation leader, who then very politely put on the tag for me. And so the story ended, or so I thought. Until about a day later some people who were also part of the orientation, started calling me Zip Tie. Damn it. Now I confess, part of me is a bit disappointed my trail name isn’t a little more, I don’t know, badass. Something like, I don’t know, (names from just off the top of my head):  Strong Man, Very Cool and Ruggedly Good Looking Guy, Zeus, the Lone Hiker (I actually do quite like the Lone Hiker). But alas, not to be: I am just a simple Zip Tie. I suppose there is a bright side. At least my trail name is very “on brand” for who I am (I believe several co- workers would agree to that). And hey, however basic a zip tie is, it does have a utility or function. I will take that.
 ◦ Lesson #2: Heed the rain. My first day on the AT consisted of tackling much of the approach trail to the summit of Springer Mt (the official starting point). Forecasts for the afternoon showed ominous warnings of rain and storms, but luckily, the weather held out. And I confess, dear reader, I got cocky. If it wasn’t raining in the afternoon, it sure as hell wasn’t gonna rain in the night, says I. And so, when I set up my tent for the night, I didn’t prep for the rain, with the core issue being that my clothes and backpack were outside my tent door with no protection. But alas. That night, we were hit by what I can honestly call the most terrifying storm I have ever been out in. Hard, cold rain, thunder and lightning, lashed out throughout the night. And  this lightning was hitting close too (remember, we were near the mountain summit). At times, when I looked out my tent, I could see the area bathed in quick pulses of white light. When I awoke, I found my clothes sopping wet and cold from the rain, and after a few choice swear words, I had the wonderful task of changing into them in the darkness of a 40 degree morning. Now, there is a happy ending to this story. As I hiked up Mt. Springer to begin my thru hike, the most beautiful weather proceeded to unfold, with sunshine and blue skies. I found very quickly my clothes began to dry out.  I am convinced of this fact: Nature takes. But it also gives.  ◦ Lesson #3: Make Sure You Hitchike in the Right Direction. After 69 miles on the trail, my plan was to hitchhike to a nearby town (hello Hiawassee, GA) in order to see for myself the wonders of the local Budget Inn. A shuttle to the town was $20. Dear reader, now just out of sheer principle, I refuse to pay that amount for a shuttle. So after trying and failing to cabbage onto to the shuttles of others, I was reduced to trying my hands at the wondrous art of hitchhiking. Now let me preface this by saying that I was ultimately successful in my hitch, in that I did eventually manage to land a ride after 30min. But my initial forays weren’t so hot. For starters, before beginning, I too hastily looked at my Google Maps for directions to the town, with the effect being me trying to thumb a ride for cars going in the opposite direction from my hoped-for for destination. You would be shocked, dear reader, but I did not manage to land a ride. After this initial botched attempt, I managed to “right” myself, so to speak, only to discover my form was all wrong. You see, when hitching, it is best to walk along the side of the road in the direction of your chosen destination, all the while indifferently lifting your thumb at passerby. Side note: why do people respond so favorably when you act indifferently to something, but they get repulsed at any sign of overeagerness?  I have also found this to be the case with girls (definitely not from my own experience, of course. I learned this from a…friend). Now, my second mistake here was to stay squarely planted in the parking lot of the trail head, and to quite erectly throw out my thumb to passerby, like I was giving them the middle finger (but it was my thumb). After many agonizing minutes for both me and for passerby in the cars, I finally managed to correct my form and I was soon hitching like a pro.  ◦ Lesson #4: Create a laundry plan. Upon entering into town and checking into a hostel or hotel, your first overriding impulse will be to take a shower. A very natural impulse, right? However, dear reader, I cannot stress this enough: figure out a laundry plan before you do this. Now, in my case, I have some clothes I can change into that are moderately “clean”; these are my Enlightened Equipment Torrid jacket (essentially a synthetic puffy that is super light but also super warm) and my EE Copperfield wind pants (which kinda looks like it is made out of a garbage can liner, but it also, yes, super light and super warm). On a side note, for aspiring thru hikers/backpackers, I cannot recommend the company Enlightened Equipment enough. Anyway, back to the story. Wearing this gear is a short-term play; you would look quite ridiculous (and overheated) walking around town with just a puffy, garbage liner pants (aka wind pants) and lime green sandals. After taking a shower, I had changed into these clothes, and my plan was to use the laundry room at the hotel to wash everything else. After some earnest searching for the hotel’s laundry room (located behind an unmarked door), voila, I found it. Only to discover that it only took quarters, and there was no machine to be found where one could get these indispensable quarters needed (I later learned the hotel owner had some). I was now left with two choices: change back into my dirty clothes after my shower, or wander around this small southern town, going from business to business begging for some quarters in order to wash my trail clothes. I chose the latter option. In case you are not aware, we are still in the middle of a damn coin shortage. So I struck out at my first two businesses, both gas stations. But then, a moment of inspiration! A thrift store, which surely must deal in cash and coin. And sure enough, the thrift store came to the rescue. A kindly woman working there said I could have all the quarters I wanted. I was in Heaven, crisis averted. And now here I sit in the Hiawassee Budget Inn while my clothes are drying. 
I tell these lessons not to frighten, amuse, or seek pity (although the latter two I do quite well). Mainly, I wanted to write this post as a way to express the following thought: for anything new and unknown you may expose yourself to, you are bound to look a little like a fool, a lotta the time. I submit that these are key ingredients that are part of any adventure, or challenge, or journey in life; and as such, it is something best to be embraced.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649179,"Dear Reader,
Here I am, at mile 136 of the Appalachian Trail, taking my first “Zero Day” on the trail, and so what better time to annoy every one with yet another blog post! 
Now, before we begin, it is necessary to first note that thru hikers have their own unique patois of speaking. True, it is a variation of the English language, but it uses words and phrases like“taking a zero”, “slackpacking’” “privy,”and “Insta mashed potatoes,” a distressingly frequent amount of time. For the uninitiated, taking a “zero day” is when a thru hiker does not hike at all on a given day, AKA they hiked zero miles that day. Sometimes this zero day will entail hanging out awkwardly at a shelter on the trail; other times, one will find themselves holed up in a tiny house in NC, eating an excessively large amount of apples while typing a blog post on one’s cell phone (guilty as charged). 
On one hand, taking a zero is a wonderful thing that provides many advantages; it gives the body time to recuperate from the relentless pounding thru hiking entails. It gives one the chance to steal/hoard toilet paper from a tiny home for future use. It gives one the chance to consume an ungodly amount of calories to hold off the dreaded “hiker hunger” (example: last night in town I hoofed down a 12” pizza and large milk shake in about 20min. Although to be fair I might have done this before hiking as well.) it gives one the chance to catch up on their communications and write up another blog post to his/her adoring readership (namely, one’s mom and dad). The list goes on and on…
But there is also a cost of taking a zero… and that is the dreaded FOMO (“Fear of Missing Out”) syndrome. Now, you would think that hiking the AT would make you FOMO-proof. Hell, you would think other folks invented the very concept of FOMO to describe their mixture of jealousy and envy over my thru hike. But alas, apparently that is not the case, and Fear of Missing Out among thru hikers themselves is greatly magnified. The particular FOMO syndrome on the AT takes the form of a burning desire to hike as many miles as humanly possible every single day. Any sign of slowing down or stopping gives one the following symptoms: stress, anxiety, and being prone to eating 12” pizzas.
That is because of the following fact: you don’t measure your distance on the AT based on the number of miles you’ve done (that often is too depressing, because, for example, I’ve only hiked about 3% of the trail). Rather, you sit and gloat about how you are X number of days ahead of this hiker, or stress about how you are Y number of days behind that hiker. Additionally, many of these hikers  in front or behind are people you may know and like, and previously have shared great moments with. And so, even on the AT, the comparisons you make, and the value and sense of worth you get from those comparisons, never truly stops. 
There is a common saying among the thru hiker community (one which you no doubt heard) to “Hike Your Own Hike.” Now, you can literally use this phrase any way you wish to justify anything at all (pee about 3 ft off the trail, right as someone passes by? Hike your own hike, bruh!). Despite this, the phrase still has value, in that it serves a gentle reminder to do what is best for you, regardless of what those around you are doing. Like most things though, the true difficulty is in actually living up to the phrase, not just spewing it out occasionally. And so, one finds himself holed up in a tiny house, anxiously eating apples, and patiently reminding himself to “hike his own hike.” After all, Maine is a long way away, and the journey has only begun, and rest and recuperation (and blogging) are important. But still, it is impossible not to feel the itch, and to dream about doing all the miles tomorrow that you did not do today. 
And that’s a wrap, thanks for reading. The next few posts will talk about all the interesting characters I’ve met on the trail, the concept of trail magic, and trail names. Stay tuned or you will surely miss out!","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649827,"Dear reader, did you know Marvin Gaye’s birthday was in April? Isn’t that fact mind blowing? With this momentous occasion in mind, I thought it only appropriate to discuss the role of music in thru hiking. 
Now surely, the hiker purist will scoff at such a suggestion. After all, shouldn’t the sound of nature—the rustling of trees, chirping of birds, or the quiet contemplation of one’s own thoughts be enough? After about 3 weeks on the trail, I discovered the answer to that question, for me anyways, is a resounding “hell no.” This could be a sign that I am a boring person, but hey, let’s not dwell on that ! 
Because now that I have trekked through the bald mountains of North Carolina, blazed through the Great Smoky Mts. (More on that in another post), a certain routine has set up:
6:30am-8am: wake up while freezing my ass off (no matter how hot the day will later become), groggily pack up my gear in a comically slow fashion, drink a cup of what can most politely be described as “weak as shit” coffee, inspect the local privy, and put on my thru hiker superhero cape and blast off down the trail. 
8am-1pm: hike in silence on the Trail, and what a time this is! Everything feels new and fresh, my body feels young and limber, my thoughts/impressions strike me as new and interesting (for example, last week I believe I came up with what would be a fairly awesome political platform to run on. Hint: it rhymes with schmandatory schnational shervice). And while I’m whipping down the trail in the cool dark, the whole trail seems mine, mine and mine alone.
1-5pm: the hot sun starts baking, everything starts hurting a bit more, Nature seems boring, I myself seem boring and hiking becomes less a process to be enjoyed, but more a destination to strive for. 
It is during these slow afternoons where music seems almost a necessity, every bit as essential as a set of trekking poles, or hell, even my tent. And it is truly a magical experience, no matter how tired you may be, or lethargic, or bored, how your body will instantly respond to the beat of a song, with arms and legs quickening to the tempo, and suddenly you feel lighter, able to almost glide effortlessly over the trail, passing day hikers left and right like traffic on the freeway. 
People have different musical tastes. I met one thru hiker who liked to microdose while she listened to classical music. Another hiker liked folk music, because it made him feel closer to nature. Me, I like listening to Bruce Springsteen the most. Born to Run feels particularly apt at times, because…well, yeah. 
My greatest musical experience might have occurred Easter Sunday. I stumbled on some trail magic (where people give thru hikers free food, drinks, etc) near the summit of Wayah Bald in North Carolina. This particular trail angel (which is someone who gives trail magic) happened to be the owner of a brewery in Franklin, North Carolina. He came damn near close to establishing a small slice of hiker heaven in that small section of North Carolina, grilling hot dogs for hikers, offering fruit, trash bags (a very underrated form of trail magic for hikers by the way). Oh yeah, he also brought out a large chest of craft beer made by his brewery, and soon a small little impromptu hiker party was taking place near the Summit.
Now, while this is all going on, I’mthinking (as any earnest thru hiker does), “I shouldn’t drink while hiking.” So naturally, I down a few beers, get quite buzzed, and then…what better activity to do than hike! And what better activity to do while hiking buzzed than to listen to music? And dear reader, what better music to hike buzzed to than Astral Weeks by Van Morrison?
And so I climbed through the woods, propelled by words like: 
If I venture in the slipstreamBetween the viaducts of your dreamsWhere immobile steel rims crackAnd the ditch and the back roads stop             Could you find me?                                             Would you kiss-a my eyes?
And I’m off, gliding through the woods, and I kid you not dear reader, for just a moment, for the briefest of seconds, I felt just like a Gaelic ferry or sprite must feel, bounding through the woods,  and I proceed to trounce 6 or 7 miles without a second thought. 
Of course, it must be noted that not all music listening necessarily revolves around listening to recorded music. Many of day hikers have had the pleasure of walking down the trail, only to stumble upon me belting a tune out loud, almost like a Gaelic ferry or sprite does (okay, I’m not sure how great this metaphor applies anymore). What lucky, lucky people. 
Of course, while listening to music, you must also be respectful of fellow hikers behind you. With both ear buds in, it is easy to not hear hikers come up behind you on the narrow trail trying to pass. For just this reason, I know of some hikers who only listen with one ear bud in. Me, I take chances, so I go two buds in all the way! (While literally looking behind me every 5 minutes in case anyones coming up behind). 
Anyway, one of the things the trail has taught me is this: sometimes a hiker needs to listen to music. Other times sing out loud. But sometimes stay in silence. Or else hike with the companionship of a partner. But the end result is always the same: keep on walking, all the way to Maine. 
See you all next week.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650221,"Breaking news! Stop the presses! Do I have a new trail name? Why yes, yes I do. About a week ago, in a moment now shrouded in myth and legend, a thru hiker buddy named Crazy Eyes christened me “Aces” (short for “Pocket Aces”). So now, when introducing myself to people, I say, “you can call me Aces. Short for Pocket Aces. But my previous name was Zip Tie, although people also called me Zipline. But my actual name is Austin.” Rinse and repeat, about 5 times a day; I love meeting new people. 
I find trail names one of the more interesting aspects of the thru hiking life. Many theories abound about why they exist. For some, it serves a very utilitarian function. Because one meets so many people in the course of a hike, the theory goes that trail names help hikers remember the names of the different people they come across. 
Then, there is the theory that trail names are a bonding exercise, used to quickly build community among thru hikers from disparate backgrounds and walks of life. After all, when meeting new people, what more natural conversation starter is there than how one got their trail name? And once you know someone’s trail name, isn’t it more likely you would feel more comfortable asking for help, or giving help, to someone named Cheez-It than a random generic name like Tom? (my apologies to Tom). 
Short backstory on how I got my trail name of Aces. You see, I’ve been running with a pretty wild group of thru hikers, called Manny & The Boys. We are kinda like a badass street gang, except we are bunch of hiking goofs (and 3 of us are single, ladies!). Manny, leader of the pack, is known far and wide for his sweet sweet whistling abilities (you have not truly lived until being woken up in a tent at dawn with Manny whistling “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” He also does a mean “Hips Don’t Lie” by Shakira). A man of such whistling talent as Manny needs an entourage as badass as he is, and us Boys heeded the call. On a side note: we are recruiting other Boys to the group. Although very strangely we have also gotten many a-backward glance when telling people this. 
Of course, like any truly great group, we also have our own theme song, where we soulfully sing in harmony, “it’s M-m-m-anny and the boooys”! A 70s style sitcom (complete with what will be a **very aggressive** use of a laugh track) is already in the works. I also heard talk of starting a new crypto coin. So many possibilities exist during this exciting time in the group’s formation. 
Now, in the course of our group hiking together, we have developed some friendly competition with another group (their trail group name is too obscene to name, but it starts with “Finger.” You get the picture. I’ll just call them the Finger Collective for shorthand). Most of their hikers are more experienced than ours. For example: One member of their group has already done the Triple Crown, which entails thru hiking the 3 main US long distance trails of the PCT, the AT, and the CDT. With our group, by comparison, three of us have never thru hiked before. 
Over the past few hundred miles, our two groups have overlapped quite frequently with each other, staying at the same shelters, crossing each other on the trail, and staying in the same towns. 
During one of the previous days a few weeks back, rumor has it some members of our group happened to overtake and pass by members of the Finger Collective out on the trail. Apparently, when this happened, a member of the rival group said to his buddy, “Are we going to let this group of high school freshmen virgins go past us?” Those are fighting words boys, let’s assemble! 
And thus was born a classic rivalry.  We instantly dreamed up creating a hiking relay race competition between both our groups of four. We schemed about which member of our group would match up against members of the Finger Collective. Should we try to obtain a competitive advantage by putting our strongest hiker against their weakest one? Which hiker should we use for elevation gains, who should be chosen on flat terrain? They labeled me “Pocket Aces,” because as one of the fastest hikers, I would serve as the secret weapon, the ace in the hole (note that I am pretty convinced that their Triple Crowner would destroy me in a speed trial, although a Boy can always dream). And that is how I have got my new name, which has been used ever since (although I also respond to Zip Tie).
Not all trail names stick. Some are just bad or unoriginal. I met a hiker named Tim, who was given the trail name Bees because he  had a small apiary. Needless to say, he politely declined to go by that name due to lack of originality. 
Some hikers go through multiple trail names. My friend Crazy Eyes (so named b/c he is essentially blind in one eye), has the following full trail name: Crazy Eyes Assassin’s Creed Propel. Another thru hiker friend also named him Brother Mahomes, on the CDT (he is a big KC Chiefs fan).
In such cases, it is not as though any of those trail names are bad or wrong. It is just that people keep evolving on the trail, meeting new groups, forming new friendships, and creating new experiences. While change is difficult for many reasons (it involves a form of loss), it also yields the opportunity to try on different identities. And trail names are just a reflection of those identities. 
Previously I was Zip Tie. Currently I am Aces (or Pocket Aces, if you wanted to get technical). Who will I will be tomorrow? 
My next post will be from Virginia. See ya then.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650931,"Dear reader, for immature man-children of a certain age, the AT is nothing so much like a frolicking summer camp, filled with jokes of a juvenile nature, some fun in the sun, and the occasional stab at a summer romance. And so, with that in mind, I bring you the story of Manny & the Boys’ Moonlight Hike. 
Once upon a time, there were three boys: Manny, Aces (that’s me!) and Crazy Eyes. If you recall, Manny was known far and wide for his sweet, sweet whistling talent that recalled to mind nothing so much as a beautiful humming bird (Manny is also famous on the trail for his very in-depth but fair minded reviews of AT shelters and water sources on the navigation app Guthooks). A man of such God-given talent must surely have his own entourage of Boys. Serving as Lead Boy was me, Aces (I can still be Lead Boy, right Manny?). The Second Boy role was filled by Crazy Eyes, who was consumed by a treacherous desire to undermine Aces’ status as Lead Boy (damn you Crazy Eyes!).  The third Boy was Ryan, who by the time of this story, lay ensnared in a trap organized by evil hippies offering free food, alcohol and a rollicking multi-day party. 
Despite a key member of their group missing, the Boys decided to embark on the following quest: hike the Appalachian Trail from sunset to sunrise one night. When hearing of their plans, fellow AT thru hikers showed their admiration through quizzical looks and polite nods. 
Manny and the Boys started out their hike at 5pm, arming their sacred bodies with copious amounts of beer and hotdogs in the baking sunlight beforehand (clearly a winning combination). During the beginning of the night, they passed hiker after hiker setting up their tents for the night. Manny and the Boys are nothing if not an affable trail group, and as an sign of this affability, every time they passed their fellow hiker, said lucky hikers would be greeted with a “Whistle us out, Manny,” to be then serenaded with the most beautiful and romantic whistling ever known to humankind. And then, just as quickly, our group would disappear down the trail, signing out with a “That’s all folks, thanks for listening. We’re Manny & the Boys!” Many a befuddled and frankly weirded-out hiker was left in their wake.
And time passed thusly. First 7pm, then 8pm, 9pm, and so on. The woods turned black and spooky, and what was like a fairytale in the light became a house of hidden horrors. Every creak of a branch was a bear! The rustling of the wind, a bear! The hoot of an owl, a bear! An evil Spirit kept placing roots and rocks on the pathway in front of the Boys, tripping up our heroes in the darkness as they hiked towards the Virginia border. 
Games were played in the night, then re-played over and over in fits of laugher and inspiration. A story was invented about their being two ghost sisters on the trail, looking to seduce some strong hiker men on the AT (“Boys of Double Spring Shelter/Hear my call/Who is the strongest hiker of them all”). And so, after the Boys passed by hikers sleeping in the night, they’d call out to them in their best female voices (which sounded dangerously close to the Gingerbread Man in Shrek, which serves as a perfect representation for all female voices), offering words of seduction. Admittedly, these words of seduction included many sex terms a 6th grade boy might use in the course of daily life. But no matter. What would be stupid in the daylight hours turned into a subject of the utmost hilarity within our heroes’ sleep-adled minds. 
More time passed. Midnight, 1am, 2am. The Boys weaved stories from their lives, some intimate, some hilarious, and for a moment the hours and miles disappeared. When they got sleepy, they made a magic brew consisting of three instant coffee packets and sugar, which they passed around in the cold of the dark. Voila, more energy!
And still, more time and distance evaporated. The boys hiked through a cow pasture in the dead of night, scaring the shit out of some formerly blissfully sleeping cows (note: it turns out cows have the same annoyed reaction as humans when getting suddenly woken up. Who knew). They hiked along mountain ridges, within sight lines of the twinkling lights of small southern towns, and the lights followed our heroes as they traipsed along the trail.
As 5am slowly progressed, the blankness of the night sky slowly turned into a very dark purple. The approaching daylight only energized our Boys further, and with a giddy-up to their step, they hurried along to the clatter of their trekking poles, in search of a camp spot when the sun broke. 
Our heroes eventually prevailed, finding a nice camping spot right at the cusp of dawn. They stumbled into site around 6am, quickly setting up their sleeping pads and quilts on the ground    to sleep under the fading stars. A PBR was quickly passed between the Boys, in celebration of hiking 27 miles in the night. 
The Boys got only a few hours of shut-eye before waking up in the late morning, groggily, only to hike anew. For Virginia, and all the spoils of town life, were on their mind.

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651169,"“Where the hell am I?”This I think, as I stand awkwardly in the background, staring up at a giant bonfire in the night, as folks tripping on acid sweatily dance around the fire to the giant pound, pound, pounding of hikers beating the shit out of some drums with sticks.
 “I am nowhere near drunk enough for this.” So I say to know one in particular, as I awkwardly try to sway my hips to the rhythm of the beat, red solo cup of whiskey in my hand, nodding my head slowly, raising my hands to the heavens in ecstasy (hallelujah!!)“Not only am I nowhere near drunk enough for this…but I kinda look like a douche.” This I only think, but don’t say, to anyone in particular. And then someone proceeds to hand me a drum stick, before I proceed to battily play whack a mole with a giant drum in front of me, looking seemingly like more of a douche the longer the game goes on. 
So, dear reader, where in fact am I? Why, where else but Trail Days, the annual party thrown by AT thru hikers for thru hikers in Damascus, Virginia. 
And how, dear reader, should I describe this scene before me? Should I compare and contrast the quiet solitude of the woods versus the 24-hour bat-shittery currently taking place in Tent City, USA? (also: did I just invent a new word? Boy, I’m a genius). Should I note the incongruity that this giant testament to drugs and alcohol also may happen to be the biggest backpacking vendor sales event of the year, with sales reps hawking their gear through such sexy buzzwords as Dyneema (yes!), ultralight (yesss!), and Hyperlite Mountain Gear (ohh yess!!!)
But rather, dear reader, let’s have a conversation about resources. Resources? Yes, resources. Because, you see, here is the dirty little secret about hiking the Appalachian Trail: much of the trail involves trying to beat out other hikers for supposed zero sum items of value. A spot in the shelter during a rainy day? Aargh, resources. That perfect tent spot near the peaceful chirping of a brook? Aargh, resources. Taking a photo near the perfect viewpoint? Oh baby, resources. And so, my friend Ryan can look me dead in the eye, in that intimidating ex-military stare of his, and say, “We need to obtain our resources, bud,” and all I can do is earnestly say, “Yes, resources!”
Going to town is often where resource acquisition becomes the most stressful because of (a) the sheer number of hikers congregating in a given trail town, (b) the time pressure one feels to get in and out of town and (c) the large number of resources that need to be obtained in town, in competition with other hikers. This competition is fierce, and waged on multiple fronts: getting a shuttle or hitch into town, reserving a spot at a hostel/hotel, taking a shower, cleaning dish ware, doing laundry, charging your electronics, buying food and supplies, eating at a restaurant, returning to trail. Damn you, resources! It is hard not to feel the stress of this sometimes. I was at a hostel a few weeks back, with only two washing machines. And oh, how I felt like a lord, because MY clothes were already in the machine, and other hikers with THEIR clothes were still waiting in line. Ha-ha. But I was a benevolent lord, and when I politely pointed out to another hiker that someone else potentially, possibly, very well could theoretically have been in line before him, he looked me dead in the eyes and said briskly, “I was here first.” Alrighty then, have a swell day!! 
And so, now back to Trail Days, where attendance was estimated to be at 20,000. Tent City, USA, which I called home for two beatific days, looked almost like a medieval battlefield encampment, lined with hundreds of tents dotted across an open field. The war in question all us hikers were assembled for? You guessed it: resources!
First, the hordes made a rush on the Dollar General in town, buying up resupply food, alcohol, and lawn chairs in hilariously quick fashion (on a side note, hikers may be the only group of people alive excited to shop at a Dollar General). Soon, the only alcohol left was Natural Light—-Lord have mercy, what is even the point. 
And then, every evening, starting at 6pm, a church group was offering a free dinner (!) for hikers. With such a valuable resource to be obtained, hikers from far and wide assembled before this temple of charity, and soon this assembly of hikers turned into a line that grew to such an extent it would make man of a more delicate sensibility (ahem, me) positively pulsate with anxiety. And then, that man realizes, damn it, he used to work for a living, and damn it, he doesn’t have to wait in this line, and so then this man walked to the downtown and went to the Damascus Diner, where he paid for food for the privilege of waiting in a shorter line. Aha, resources! 
Even the smallest items can cause a competition for resources. Example: the humble red solo cup. You see, the natural impulse when at Trail Days is to drink one’s beer directly from the can or bottle. But soon, a very trustworthy man named Nutzzzzz (I took an author’s liberties of adding a few z’s) shows up, and because he is so trustworthy , he tells you the police will be coming soon, and will be ticketing anyone with an open bottle. And thus begins the Battle of the Red Solo Cup. And before leaving, Nutz is also trustworthy enough to tell you he runs a hostel, and also sells some let’s say “product” on the side, where presumably one can engage in both in a safe but very trustworthy manner. That Nutz! 
Porta-potties are perhaps the grossest resource needed. But they are also highly desired, especially when one spends a large portion of an evening drinking beer, before heading to the woods banging on the proverbial drum. The desire is only enhanced when one is 30, with their bladder being not necessarily at the downslope of their career, but certainly not at the peak either, to the point where one must drunkenly get up from their tent about four times in the middle of the night, weaving through a maze of tent lines and stakes, to walk the 100 yards distance to visit those sweet waste receptacles in question, squinting throughout to see whether the door handle was red for occupied, or green for vacant, and sometimes guessing right, sometimes wrong. 
But then, no matter how fierce the resource war is, you can always find peace and solitude if you look hard enough. And in those moments, the peace and solitude is more appreciated, because it is more dearly earned. And so, on my last day of the festival, before heading back to the trail, I awoke at dawn, silently walking the festival grounds alone. Past the empty vendor tents, past the cool of the quiet streets, the silence in the air, and stillness in the mind. The peace was so complete that, for the briefest of moments, I almost wished there were more people around.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652429,"The sun was shining, blue sky cloudless. The terrain smooth and forgiving. The long green hills of Virginia slowly undulated across the landscape. And yet, the last six miles of my hike on the AT happened to be the most Herculean physical challenge I ever encountered (batshit is another word I’d use) as I walked backwards to the town of Daleville, Virginia, a town I had seemingly left for good only hours before.
The culprit of this mysterious about-face: a fairly ravenous attack of the norovirus, which hit me drop dead in the middle of my hike that day. That was four days ago, and flash forward to the present time, I am hitting the very existential ceiling of the amount of time one can seemingly stay trapped in a Super 8 motel, recuperating from noro and watching the French Open on television. Will Nadal win the Open again? Can Gauff get to the finals (which, as an aside, would be a very big step forward in her young career). Stay tuned to find out! I surely will.
Now, thru hikers are a fairly badass lot. Very few things rile or scare them, from chance encounters with poisonous snakes or bears, to many nights sleeping alone, not in a Super 8 motel, while sleeping outside, and not in a Super 8 motel, confined without the luxuries one may find if they stayed at a fine establishment such as, I don’t know, a Super 8 motel (pardon me, I have brain fog from sleeping too long in a…Super 8 motel). However, one of the few things that leave said hikers shaking in their trail running shoes, curled up inside their Z packs trekking pole tent, clutching their Hyperlite Mountain Gear pack, is the thought of getting noro. And oh dear reader, did I get a Harvard-level education (or at the very least a Brown education) on why noro is so feared. 
In many ways, I secretly believe I cast this norovirus curse on myself. On my initial hike out of town on Saturday, I innocently mused about the potential benefits of getting norovirus and being able to take 3-4 days resting up, while watching such a prestigious sporting event as the French Open (it’s springtime in Paris, what’s not to like!). Now, in my defense, I did preface the above outlandish statement with the qualifier, “this may be a stupid thought…”, although there is some debate whether prefacing said stupid thought really makes that stupid thought any less stupid. But alas, the Gods of Hiking don’t give a shit about qualifiers, they only care about the main intent of declarative sentences. 
And so, literally a hour after speaking those words of prophecy, I found myself deep in the belly of the norovirus beast, except in this particular metaphor, I was curled up in the middle of the woods, far off trail, desperately pooping. And then the real fun began. 
A fever took hold as soon as I went to the bathroom. My brain became confused, more confused than usual. Immortal hiking God that I am, I felt…weak, vulnerable, feverish, shaky. Okay, now I’m just listing symptoms and states of mind.. I sat apathetically on a nearby log, listlessly staring at the green of the foliage around me, the woods a cathedral of silence. 
Choices, choices…I could continue on the trail, hoping I got better, or, choices, choices, turn back around, the six miles I had come, and return to Daleville. The nearest town to the north was 60 miles away, with limited public road crossings nearby. I knew that staying at the Super 8 in Daleville, that beautiful sanctuary of clean toilets and soft beds, was my only hope. I called the motel in utter agony, pale and feverish, about 5 ft from where I had my digestive meltdown. Oh Christ, please let this conversation be brief. 
Is there a room available for tonight, says I, in a semi-coherent mumble.
Yes, they say. Hooray, it’s my lucky day. 
But before booking could actually take place, what followed was a relatively long and one could say not particularly necessary sidebar about whether or not I was a Wyndham rewards member, with me unfortunately in too feverish and weak a state to know the answer to this question, to which the helpful Super 8 rep tried really hard find out (note: it turns out I am a Wyndham rewards member!). And here all the while I’m on the verge of literally puking out of my mouth (yes, I find it important to note “mouth” in this context) during the whole conversation. 
Once we resolved the Great Wyndham Rewards Mystery, a second problem unfolded. This one rather critical, I’m afraid. Apparently I needed a credit card to book over the phone. And my credit card was in my backpack. Which was on the trail. And I was about 50 yards off trail, somewhere at the bottom of a steep incline. Remember that I had to literally run off trail to  perform my digestive exorcist. 
I actually had no idea where the hell I was in relation to my backpack. When my initial digestive emergency occurred, I was in such a brain fogged state that I paranoidly moved way farther off trail to poop than was perhaps necessary, because I kept thinking people from the trail would be able to see me, although in retrospect they clearly couldn’t, so down, down, down this damn incline I went. And now, up, up, up the incline I back went to retrieve my credit card, with this Super 8 rep on the line the whole time, and me trying to stall for time as I worked my way back to my backpack. Just another minute, I swear, nearly there….But several minutes later, I realized I wasn’t at all nearly there. So click. I hung up on the phone call, the whole previous delightful conversation for naught. 
My whole attention was now on getting back to the damn trail. Thanks to the glories of my Far Out app and its GPS system (praise be), I was able to directionally right myself, and I came bounding back onto the trail like a bat out of hell from the woods. And then I called Super 8 again and started the booking process all over again.
What then transpired was the aforementioned Hike of Doom back to town. Slowly I retraced my steps backward. In my weakened state, it felt like the weight of my backpack was wrestling my body to the ground. And steadily I suffered beneath that weight. Never did I feel so alone, never also did I also feel so apathetic. About getting back to that damn town. Or finishing the damn hike. Or damn anything, damn damn damn. I realize this all sounds melodramatic. But screw it, you weren’t there, and to loosely quote Shakespeare, “it’s my party, and I’ll cry if I want to. You would cry too if it happened to you.”
Still I continued on feverishly, stumbling here, stumbling there. Losing track of time. I’d take a break every mile or two, and sprawl to the ground near the side of the trail, wishing I could only sleep, but knowing I had to hike on, and cursing that fact (Side note: the photo I included in this blog post was a small hill I had to climb on my way back town. Honestly, for a normal person, it wouldn’t be a particularly tough climb. But for me, it took on the proportions of Mt Everest). On and on I went, with the sounds of industry getting closer and closer, until it felt like the town was at just a whisper, just around the corner, and then finally, the door opened…and there was Daleville. Thank you, God. Thank you God. I kept mumbling as I approached the sanctuary that is Super 8. 
And now, three or four days later, here I sit at the Super 8. I am not sure what to make of all this. Except I’m thankful I’m feeling better. And thankful I’m healthy. And I guess that’s it. 
Oh, yeah, one more thing…I also learned not to joke about kinda wishing you got noro so you could watch the French Open. Because that shit will happen for real, the Hiking Gods don’t play, homey.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653051,"Dear reader, here I sit at my brother and sister- in-law’s house in suburban Washington, DC/Baltimore. I sleep on a Queen mattress, in a room to myself, with velvety soft linens, made all the more sweet because they kicked my baby niece and nephew out of their room to host me (sorry, not sorry Jack and Hannah, have fun sleeping in mom and dad’s room!) 
My brother Ryan  picked me up from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia on Monday evening, as I exhaustively  lay sprawled on the lawn near the stately office of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, in the fading daylight of a warm summer evening.  Among AT thru hikers, reaching Harpers Ferry is something of a milestone; it comes frighteningly close to marking the halfway point on the trail.
As celebration, as we speak this Wednesday morning, I have currently downed not one, but two (2!) large bowls of Honey Nut Cheerios (or, to be more precise, Honey Nut Crispy Oats). I sit in silence in the house, with my brother sleeping upstairs—-my brother informed me, as a general rule, he tries really hard not to do anything before noon. And so, it being before noon, what better time to churn out another blog post than in the immediate victorious aftermath of eating a bowl of off-brand cereal? 
To catch you up on my blog, for those of you lost souls not religiously following my postings in a sequential order, last time we spoke I lay recovering from norovirus in the healing bosom that is the Daleville, Virginia Super 8 motel. Since that time, I have been laying down some track, covering 300 miles in approximately two weeks. How does one do this? By hiking a lot. Days take on an uniform consistency. Wake up at 5:30am (or 5:45, if I’m feeling naughty). Hike through the day, with a few snack breaks in between. Set up camp in the evening, around 6 or 7pm (or 8pm, if I’m feeling naughty). Rinse, repeat, day by day by day. 
And so, the subject of this blog post is…how to entertain yourself while hiking throughout the day. And in truth, there are many ways to do this. Here are some common strategies:
#1 Meet the locals: Stop and chat with your fellow hikers on the trail, many of whom are locals just out for a day hike. In some instances though, it can be just as important to know when not to stop and chat, and I don’t know, when to flee for your life. Take hiking the Shenandoah’s, for instance. As I found myself hiking on the trail one day, alone in the woods, a figure came steadily towards me from the opposite side of the trail, with a semi-automatic rifle in his hand, dressed head to toe in military garb. Most likely a hunter, but still, something seemed off…in the immortal words of Carol King, “you can’t talk to a man, with a shotgun in his hand,” and so, heeding this wise advice, I said hello to the hiker/hunter (or hiker hunter) in my most winning and earnest midwestern voice I could muster (usually I’m none of those things), something like “good day sir,” so on so forth, and then I proceeded to get the hell out of dodge before I “accidentally” got mistaken for a very fair piece of game. 
#2 Enjoy the wildlife: While we are on the subject of the Shenandoah’s, let’s talk about the deer in the park. Because they are essentially dogs at this point, in how utterly unafraid they are of humans. Someone should teach those damn beasts a lesson! Case in point: As I was walking down the trail (note: if you haven’t figured this out, most of my stories are gonna start with “as I was walking down the trail”), I came across a mother deer and a baby deer immediately in front of me. They saw me, and began to half-heartedly saunter away, still staying on the trail. Now, this is a minor annoyance of mine, when animals attempt to flee, but don’t think to leave the actual trail you are walking on, as opposed to the more intelligent strategy of fleeing to the side of the trail. I am not here to mansplain to animals on how to flee properly, but c’mon! Anyway, the same pattern played out over and over with these deer: I’d walk on the trail, they jog a bit up the trail and stop, I keep walking and catch up to them, shouting the whole time “go left you idiot, go left. Jesus”, they run a little bit more on trail, stop, I catch up, etc. And then finally, after this went on for like 5 minutes, the mother deer just lazily stopped on the trail, and stared blankly at me as I came up within a a few feet of her. “Go,” I gestured impatiently. No reaction. At which point I started barking at the deer, and waving my trekking poles madly, anything to get her to move. This finally she did, albeit very reluctantly, and before leaving, she fixed me with a look that bespoke the following thought, “Dude. Maybe therapy?”
#3 Create games to pass the time:  In moments of true tiredness, when every step feels like agony, it is best to find a game to take your mind off the discomfort. I know of one hiker who would try to see how long she could keep a particular leaf on the end of her trekking pole, before it would fall off. I am told the leaves could hold on for a few days, although this fact has yet to be confirmed by me. My favorite game is to play a form of “I Spy” with myself. I seek out an object adjacent to the trail—-whether it be an interesting bush or tree branch—and then I hike towards that object. As soon as I pass by said object, the process starts all over again. This can go on for 20 or 30 minutes at a time. If this gets boring, I pick a particular sound to focus on, such as the sound of the birds, the squeak of my backpack, or the rustling of trees, and try to concentrate only on that particular item at the exclusion of all else.
#4 Make lists of random shit. As a rule of thumb, many people expect when you are alone in nature, you will spend vast quantities of time thinking about weighty topics related to The Future, such as your future life priorities, a future career, whether you (or more specifically I, in this case) want children. But I’ve found it much easier to talk these things with the sounding board of a hiking partner. When you are alone, there is too much pressure to think on your own about these topics, and often, your mind turns blank when faced with these weighty subject matters. But when it comes to the most innocuous and stupid shit, oh, I’ve found my mind has opinions galore! . For instance, I’ve had long and deep comversations with myself on the state of Ohio State’s football team in 2022, particularly with how their defense will perform (As an aside, I do think their defense will be better, particularly their defensive line). A particular speciality of my brain is the fine art of making top 5 lists. For example, best song lyrics of all time. After much strenuous debate winner goes to The Modern Lovers for this beauty: “sometimes people try to pick up girls/And get called an asshole/This never happened to Pablo Picasso/he could walk down your street and girls could not resist his stare/Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole.” Other topics, at the discretion of the committee chair that is my brain: best British Invasion bands of all time, worst presidents of all time, favorite piece of hiking gear, etc. 
Anyway, these items are just a sample of how I keep busy. Hiking the AT is just a reflection of life in general. At times, at its hardest moments, life goes unbearably slow, and in those times, you need strategies for coping. But mostly it goes blindingly fast, and in a blink of an eye, you find you are almost halfway done, and you don’t know where the time went.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653421,"Dear reader, I feel absolutely compelled to tell you about a moment of pure bliss I had at the Middlesex Diner in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Oh, this diner had everything for me. Great breakfast food for ridiculously cheap prices ($4 for their breakfast special!), industrial level quickness and efficiency that would even put old Henry Ford to shame, middle-aged waitresses who call me “darling” (Will I ever outgrow getting called darling? Good God, I hope not), and a most excellent setting for sitting alone and eavesdropping on the conversations of others. They sat me down right next to a couple engaged awkwardly in a conversation with their pastor, confronting him about not feeling welcome in the church. Cue the pastor talking about the importance of listening and letting the couple know, y’know, he was always accessible to feedback and tough conversations. My sense is that part of the issue stemmed from the pastor just being plain shitty at making eye contact. Now, I am like a mosquito of social awkwardness, both an expert performer and observer of it, and here I was presented with a five course meal of embarrassment galore. And so mid-sip of coffee, or slowly munching on eggs- over-easy on rye bread, I excitedly remained glued to the conversation, ears tilted over to get closer, closer to the words being spoken. Yes,  go on, go on… yes… you tell that pastor…Me, should I risk quickly glancing over, or continue casting my eyes straight ahead? Don’t be too obvious, you dunce. Be cool, be cool…Soon, the raw tension of the conversation broke, emotions subsided, and with relief, the group settled into the anodyne topics of kids and sleepovers (which seemed to consist of the following sentiment, “kids say and do the darndest things, don’t they?”) I finished my food, and left the diner shortly thereafter, leaving to the goodbye chimes of an old man burping loudly and then saying “‘scuse me.” I don’t think I will ever go back to the Middlesex Diner,  although I sure wish I did. I’m not sure why I am sharing this moment, except to show the other side of the trail, the one not connected to the remoteness of the woods, but firmly gripped in community, people and tied to narrow everyday problems. I think you need a little bit of both to get by.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653759,"Warning Label Before Reading: this post contains descriptions of male nudity. If you are prone to nausea, anxiety, or depression, please consider consulting a doctor before reading further. 
Dear reader, as I walked naked on the trail, shorn of all clothing and wearing only a backpack, I could hear the sounds of civilization getting closer and closer. Buildings peeked out from the brush. An endless surf of cars rushed by on the busy rural Pennsylvania state highway. And I was at a loss of what to do. For the trail crossed right over this state highway, and right past these buildings, and I naked, must cross along right with it. I reached the edge of the road, crouched crazily in the bushes, with head poked out, on the lookout for cars. One car would appear, then another, a black truck here, green Jeep there, and I would jump back in the brush. Then, when the coast was clear, I’d duck back along the highway edge, scouting out the landscape before me. And soon, and finally, silence. Emptiness. I sensed my opportunity, and grasping at it with all my might, I sprinted my skinny ass naked across the street, backpack jiggling behind me, until I crossed over and reached the safety of the woods and the trail on the other side. Only to discover a yellow “Watch for Children” sign posted nearby, with a home just beyond. Oh Sweet Jesus. I tripped over a rock in my haste to continue on up the trail.  And as I rushed up the trail, I pictured the cops being called, sirens blaring, guns drawn, and me being hauled out from the forest in my majestic birthday suit, all the while trying to explain the following fact: it was Hike Naked Day!
Now, Hike Naked Day is a staple of an Appalachian Trail thru hike, annually occurring on the first day of summer. Most hikers don’t participate in it, only a small few do actually. But dear reader, being the enterprising and diligent blogger I am, I felt just absolutely compelled to take part in this experience and document it for my adoring readership. Never mind, that this was only to be the second time me being nude outside on the trail, the first time being in a hot springs in Hot Springs, NC, which was really just a jacuzzi filled with hot spring water (no wonder the cost was so cheap) and I was with three male friends, none of whom were naked, all of whom had bathing suits or underwear on, leaving me to wonder why I was naked (long story), with the perfect end to that picture postcard day being the end of the night, with the water draining slowly from the jacuzzi, slowly uncovering more and more of my body, and a female hiker just happening by right at the moment the water was at a, let’s say, critically low level (suffice to say, I haven’t seen her since). With the point being, it takes one hell of a diligent and enterprising blogger to get back on the proverbial horse, to experience firsthand the wonders of Hike Naked Day. 
Now, Hike Naked Day is just one of the many hiker crafted challenges and tribulations that exist along the trail. There is, just off the top of my head… the 4-State Challenge, the 24-Hour Hiking Challenge, the Deli Dash, the Demascus Dash, so on and so forth. This blog will do a two-parter on two specific challenges: Hike Naked Day, and the 1/2 Gallon Ice Cream Challenge (which, yes, involves eating a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting, to honor reaching the half way mark on the AT. Only in America). 
First challenge up was Hike Naked Day, which took place Tuesday June 21. My initial goals were modest. You know, strip off my clothes, parade around nude for a few moments, just enough time where I could brag to complete strangers on the internet I had my clothes off on the trail. But, dear reader, something to know about me: I am a very goal-oriented person, which normally is a very healthy trait, but in this context, leads one to hiking around nude for longer and longer periods of time. 
The beginning of my hike did not get off to the most auspicious of starts. After checking the coast was clear, I kicked off my shoes and clothes in the middle of the trail with the confidence and speed of the most seasoned nudist. Okay, that was a success. But then, failure, as I fumbled the equally critical task of putting back on my shoes before hiking, with me hunched over naked in the trail spending an embarrassingly long amount of time trying to loosen a knot on one of the laces. Would someone spot me? Cold sweat raced down my brow, as I surgically raced to tie up my shoes. Finally, this was accomplished, and shortly, I was off to the races. The cool morning air soon greeted me, and I personally discovered how such artful phrases as “cold as balls,” and “freezing my balls off” came to be invented. Oh yes, shrinkage indeed.
And so, I hiked naked for a few hundred feet, at which point I approached a set of railroad tracks and thought, “wouldn’t it be cool to hike naked over railroad tracks?” And then, having done this, I thought, “wouldn’t it be even cooler to hike naked to the road?” And after doing this, I next thought, “wouldn’t it be the most cool to hike naked across the road?” (It being more cool to cross roads naked than to be naked on roadsides, for reasons I need hardly explain). At which point we reached the delightful scene so charmingly conveyed at the beginning of this blog post, involving this author’s daring exploits crossing said road. 
When we last saw our dashing hero, he was fleeing from a yellow “Watch for Children” sign. Once he regained his manly composure, he checked the distance he hiked: 0.7 miles. Which leads us to our last goal: hike naked 1/3 of a mile more to reach the one mile mark.
It was in the process of doing this that I ran into my first and only victim on the trail: a 30-something male section hiker walking southbound. Well, dear reader, sometimes Fate is not on your side. Or, as they say in the Big Lebowski, “sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar eats you.” For this section hiker, I can say with a 100% degree of confidence the bar was very much eating him that day. 
For, I was now faced with two choices: flee into the bushes and hide (usually my preferred modus operandi) or continue walking naked on the trail. And unluckily for our section hiker, I chose the latter option, covering up my junk (in a very loose sense) with my baseball hat as we approached each other. “Don’t look, don’t look,” I said in a voice I hope sounded wry and sophisticated, but probably sounded weird and off-putting. “Sorry dude, it is Hike Naked Day,” I then added for helpful context as we passed. This man, God bless his sweet soul, gave what I can only imagine was the most professional and polite response someone could give in this context. He choked back a quick laugh, before saying more seriously, “Got it, noted.” And then he continued his walk without missing a beat. Corporate tycoons of America, hire this man! 
Very shortly after, I crossed my one mile threshold. In celebration, I put back on my clothes, but not before sending a choice pic or two to my friends (you are welcome guys!). And so ended my Hike Naked Day. But funnily enough, shortly after I put on my clothes, another hiker merrily started coming down the trail, right past me, with that lucky s.o.b. having no idea about the SUV-sized bullet he had only too narrowly dodged.
How fitting of a metaphor for the Appalachian Trail, I thought. Sometimes you eat the bar, sometimes the bar eats you. Sometimes you run into a malnourished naked guy in the woods, other times thankfully only a malnourished clothed guy. And how slim the difference is between those two outcomes, and how slim success and failure on the trail. One person slips on a rock and breaks their foot, another slips but regains their footing. Why one happens and not the other is the mystery of life, and the reason I am still on trail.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654443,"Dear reader, I recently entered the great state of Connecticut, which a sign helpfully informed me was the Gateway of New England, as I passed the state line. This was just the first sign. Because shortly after you enter Connecticut on the AT, you quickly find yourself back in New York, and New York doesn’t have any signs welcoming you back. Typical New York. Then you re-cross the state line, and find yourself back in Connecticut again, and they have another sign. Then back in New York again, and goddamn it, still no sign. Then finally in Connecticut. But this blog post does not take place in Connecticut (you’d be so lucky, Connecticut). Or New York for that matter (as if, New York). Rather, we find ourselves transported back to Pennsylvania, back a few weeks ago, to a magical time in my life, when I ate a half-gallon of ice cream.
Please note, I didn’t just randomly eat a half gallon of ice cream out of the blue (although I could. Seriously. Try me). Rather, this is a common hiking challenge on the trail, meant to celebrate making it to the halfway point (although, similar to the skullf*** that is the border crossing between NY/CT, there are multiple “halfway” markers on the trail. Jesus Christ, can I have one moment of catharsis). The location of the challenge typically takes place at a general store, in some rural Pennsylvania town I forgot the name of and am too lazy to look up. Thrillingly, they award you a small spoon when you complete the challenge. 
But my ice cream challenge did not take place in aforementioned rural unnamed PA town. It took place in Carlisle, PA in an Airbnb rented by my friend House, whose trail name is so given due to his damn near God-like powers of finding classy as hell house rentals along the trail. Truly, this man is operating on a higher plane than us. 
Why did I do the challenge in Carlisle, PA and not that other town? Because I’m special. Or a coward. Although it is more likely the second option. I strode into the general store in What-the-hell-is-your-name, PA like a man on a mission, determined to do the challenge. I was confident, nay, arrogant in my gastrointestinal fortitude. My dad once called me “old hollow leg”  due to my powers at putting down large quantities of food in short amounts of time. So  umm, yeah, I’m good. 
It was during the physical process of selecting the ice cream that I froze. Panicked. Acted like a chicken, you know, went bock-bock. Whatever you want to call it. You see, in my minds eye, I associated eating a half gallon of ice cream as eating a tub of ice cream. But apparently, as a sign in the store helpfully pointed out, a tub is only 48 ounces. A half gallon is 64. So, to take part in the challenge, you need to eat a 48 oz tub of ice cream, plus a pint. When I mentally processed this, I was at the checkout with my lone tub of ice cream. When I realized I had to eat an additional pint, I let out an “oh shit no” before sadly putting the tub back in the freezer. Instead, I made do with a measly order of a cheeseburger, large fries, 3-scoop ice cream cone, and Gatorade. 
One thing to know about me, reader. And this is truthful. I do not handle myself well when immediately confronted with new challenges, or surprises. But given enough time, my brain settles down, and attacks the new situation with the utmost vigor! Which, is a round about way of saying, after chickening out initially, I wanted to try to attempt the challenge after all. 
And what better town to do this in than Carlisle, PA? Carlisle is my favorite trail town, and it is not particularly close. I mean, they have a Revolutionary War-themed brewery. Enough said. Finally, someone astute enough to combine my two great passions in life, craft beer and the Revolutionary War! Molly Pitcher Brewery, I will come back to you…but first, I had a challenge to partake in. 
This ice cream challenge story, like all great stories, started at the local Walmart, where I stalked the frozen food aisles with a determination and concentration probably rarely seen at that store. Because not just any flavor or brand would do. It had to be a flavor I relatively liked, duh. And of course come from a good brand, ideally one on the cheaper side. I see you Turkey Hill! But more robust data also needed to be taken into account. What was the calorie count per serving? There being a big difference between, say, the calories in Neopolitan flavor and Chunky Monkey. Also, how smooth was the texture of the product? Would it be easy to quickly and mechanically shovel large spoonfuls of the ice cream in my mouth? Ultimately, the flavors that passed the above tests were: Strawberry (for the pint), and Neopolitan (for the tub). Properly steeled for battle, I raced back to the Airbnb to meet my date with destiny. 
As it happened, House wasn’t just a master renter of Airbnb’s. He was also an exquisite connoisseur of the Spotify playlist, knowing exactly what songs to play for each particular occasion. And so, as I began slowly engorging large dollops of ice cream, I was egged on to these feats of glory by songs such as “Stuck in the Middle with You,” which, by the way, is a song that totally works as background music for those occasions when you eat a shit-ton of ice cream. Another good song, “Crazy in Love” by Beyoncé. Although truthfully that song probably works in any occasion, Beyoncé is so talented. 
But alas, dear reader, I fear we reach the point in the story where the deficiencies in my writerly talents are exposed to the world; and that is attempting to create an exciting narrative around eating a half gallon of ice cream. I just can’t do it. Believe me, I tried. I even tried creating a fictional allegory that involved a knight rescuing a princess by eating ice cream. It was pure shit. 
Ultimately, the best, most truthful narrative I came up with was this: time passed slowly. I ate ice cream. 5, 10 minutes. Ice cream. Friends stood awkwardly around, looking at their phones, but not actually looking at their phones, more like using the device as a crutch, all so they didn’t have to look at me eating ice cream. But still…15, 20 minutes. More ice cream. Music played. 25, 30, ice cream, ice cream, ice cream. Until ice cream was everywhere, in the blood, in the brain, ice cream pumped to the arteries. An entire body slowly being turned to ice cream. Until, finally, it was done, complete, finis, I was a winner, I guess? But God, at what cost. 
Which leads us to our closing point: why do this challenge at all? Why do any hiking challenge? Hike Naked Day. The 4-State Challenge. 24-Hour Hike. All our admittedly puerile. And, yet, why hike the Appalachian Trail, which is essentially walking between two random points on the map? Could just as well be Canada. The real answer is I don’t know. But if I had to guess, it would be because it feels like Halloween or carnival. A chance to do something far outside the norm of your usual existence, try out new identities and experiences. Meet new people. If for nothing else than for the process of doing something new. Because life is short. And who knows, you may like the costume you try on (or the ice cream you eat!).","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655214,"Dear reader, a few days back, I found myself in a shelter, in Vermont,  outside a town best known for a cult that operates both a hiker hostel AND a deli (because of course). And here I sat in said shelter, eating my dinner of tuna packet and bag of crackers, quietly debating best strategies for eating said crackers and tuna packet. There is the classic strategy, of course, of spooning bits of tuna on each individual cracker. But this gets messy and is time consuming. Strategy #2: dip each cracker directly into the tuna packet. I initially thought this strategy was a winner, only to discover a core defect of inefficiency (it being really hard to scrape enough tuna from the packet onto the cracker). And then, finally, lo and behold, a winner: spooning some tuna directly into the mouth, not chewing or swallowing, then dropping in a cracker, and voila, chewing both together in a perfect symphony of tuna and cracker goodness. 
Is the above description at all relevant to the subject of this blog post? Not at all! Is the title of this blog post, based on a Bo Diddley hit song from the 50s, at all relevant to my blog post subject? Not really!
Here is something relevant, sorta: way up in the Berkshire Mts of Massachusetts, there exists a woman who goes by name of The Cookie Lady (she is technically Cookie Lady 2, with the first Cookie Lady having retired, bringing up an important question of whether a Cookie Lady can ever really retire. But I digress). How does one get the name of The Cookie Lady? They must operate a blueberry farm in Massachusetts and offer free cookies for thru hikers, and sometimes lemonade too. Our Cookie Lady in question (Cookie Lady #2, not #1) also generously allowed tenting on her farm, which is how this particular hiker came to be on her property in the late afternoon, setting up his tent. At which point, our Cookie Lady offered this hiker a sorta deal, which was the following: pick a bucket’s worth of blueberries, and get a home cooked dinner (chili!) in return. Now, if this hiker knows one thing in this world, it is this: if someone named The Cookie Lady (1 or 2)  offers you a deal, any deal whatsoever, you take it. And so I did take the deal. Only to discover the bucket was much bigger than I thought (56 ounces), and apparently, picking blueberries was much tougher than I thought, or at least I much worse. And so, damnit, after pulling a 27-miler day, I found myself in the growing twilight of a Massachusetts evening desperately trying to fill a jumbo bucket up with blueberries before it got too dark to see. I, still in my hiking gear, comically rushed from bush to bush, grasping at branches, clutching blueberries by the scores, panicked look in my face, depositing each blueberry into the bucket like so many coins in a slot machine. 7:30pm, 8pm. Bucket only halfway full, the sky a deepening purple, purple like a, oh no, dare I say, the ripeness of a blueberry. More time passes, sky turns slowly to black, black like an, oh no, overripe blueberry. Bucket now 3/4 full. 
It was at this moment, the following thought struck me: how would I know when I reached a “full” bucket? Did a bucket three-fourths filled count as “full”? Or four-fifths? Did “full” mean a bucket literally filled to the brim with berries? Moreover, should the approximate value and quality of the chili I received somehow help determine how full I filled the bucket? Poor, substandard chili deserving a less full bucket, good chili a more full bucket? Shockingly, the Cookie Lady never specified any of these details, and so poor me (still balls to the wall picking blueberries) was left to philosophically ponder these finer print details, all in the midst of a blueberry-inspired panic attack.
I bring up this story because, in a way, filling a bucket full of blueberries is a perfect metaphor for hiking the Appalachian Trail. Every one wants to complete a “full” thru hike, from Georgia to Maine. But everyone also has a different definition of what the hell this actually means. Some people (known as purists) believe this to mean hike every damn inch of the trail. Others hold on to less rigid definitions.  Hike a few miles on a parallel path if it exists? Sure. Take an occasional shortcut? Okay. Still more, even the very definition of hiking is called into question, with some believing it is important to hike with your full pack on only, and not, say, using only a daypack occasionally. 
Admittedly, I am a hiking purist, although I am a self-loathing one. I’ve spent endless amounts of time, deep in my own head, agonizing whether x miles back, I accidentally went one way on a divergent trail, when instead I should have went another. And then, instead of a blueberry inspired panic attack, I get a dose of thru hiker inspired existential crisis that I, purist hiker I am, may have somehow missed a step on trail, and thus taken a shortcut to Maine, thereby cheapening whatever accomplishment I hope to obtain. My ultimate fear is not so much not making it to the end point of Katahdin. Rather, it entails finishing the trail, but then having some lingering doubt afterwards about accidentally missing a section, even if it is only a quarter mile. And now, dear reader, here I sit, late at night, in another shelter in Vermont, typing out this blog post. And as I write, I reflect, thinking back to a conversation I had with a friend early on in the trail. I said something to the effect of: I would rather not complete the trail, but positively grow as a person from the experience, as opposed to complete the trail and not grow. And here, in this shelter, I think of my hiker purist fears, and how entirely predictable they are to the core of my being. Can a person truly change from this trail? Can they change their perceptions about how “full” the bucket is? Can they change their base nature, their most elemental personality? 
I am only a few miles from New Hampshire, under 450 miles left on the trail. I have my own guess at the answer to the question above, although there is still time to change it.

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655822,"Dear reader, has anyone seen my baby Swiss Army knife? I lost it somewhere in the Whites (along with the rest of my first aid kit). And now here I sit in a motel in Bethel, Maine, about 270 miles from the end point, and instead of thinking about the end point, I pine over my missing knife. I imagine, as these things go, my knife has found a new owner. Or, at the very least, it’s sitting on a rock in the Presidentials, waiting for that special someone to come by.
This loss cuts deep (good pun, Austin!). Because this wasn’t just any Swiss Army knife, it was a baby one! Black color, three inches long, half an ounce. I felt strangely paternal about this knife, hell, even maternal at times. My favorite moments with the Swiss Army knife came when I had to use the scissors to cut open Propel or Starbucks Via packets, which I had to do a distressingly frequent amount of times when I couldn’t tear open the packets with my fingers. I would claw and pull at the packets, all to no avail, damn it, and then to the rescue comes the “scissor” function on the knife, like the world’s greatest special ops team (on a side note: you would think companies could put out more consistent “tear here” packaging, instead of packets that you can only sometimes tear open. But I guess that is a different post.)
Me and my baby Swiss Army knife have had a tumultuous, hell, some may even say stormy, relationship. There was the time I foolishly put the knife in my carry-on bag at the Bangor, Maine airport and tried to go through security. That didn’t end well… Let’s not forget the time I thought I lost the knife, but really it was just buried in the inner recesses of my backpack. I bought another knife, and then, surprise, the missing knife showed up at my doorstep. So then I had two. And now I have none. 
Am I really going to write an entire blog post on my missing Swiss Army knife? Yes, I am! You see, I was going to write a post on my experiences in the Whites, and southern Maine. And using those experiences as a framework, I was then going to discuss the nature of thru hiker perceptions and fears, and how accurately they may or may not sum up reality. 
But that all sounded like too much work on a town day. Instead, I just wanted to write a post to update everyone that I’m doing well, staying safe, and I’m through the Whites and in Maine. And I wanted to ask: if you see my baby Swiss Army knife in the Whites, can you hit me up? It has sentimental value.","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656299,"""I Like It When You Call Me Big Poppa."" And so these words are etched again and again in Maine privies along the Appalachian Trail. And me, innocently pursuing his morning business, in Maine privy after Maine privy, trapped, forced to read these words again and again, as if some in some poop-themed version of Groundhog Day. Another thoughtful soul has kindly written, also in said privy, to tell hikers to be sure and eat more fiber, and creatively, he pretends the advice comes from the privy itself; and feeling so strongly about this advice, he (let's be honest. It's most likely a ""he""), has also taken to repeating this message in privy after privy. Speaking of advice, let us not forget the Epicurean who, in privy after privy (I'm sensing a theme here!), tells us the key to a happy life is to smoke weed and to eat...well, I'll stop there. 
It is to Big Poppa though, whoever he is, wherever he may be (not including, of course, the Maine privies), that I dedicate this blog post. This blog post, which will be one of my last, as I enter the 100 Mile Wilderness and ascend holy Katahdin in 5 short days (depending on the weather). 
Over the last few weeks, I have thought often over how I want to end my very, very prestigious blog. After all, what subject matter is truly fitting enough to end a prestigious blog, to allay the wants and desires of my blood-thirsty readership? I feel like a regular JK Rowling, feeling the pressure as she sought just the perfect ending to the Harry Potter series.
After long and deep thought, I decided on the subject of ""hiker trash"" for this blog post. Hiker trash, noun/adjective, definition: a form of identity taken on by thru hikers, where said thru hikers take pride and ownership in their filthy/disheveled appearance and vagabond ways. 
Hiker trash is spotted most clearly in its contrast, the civilized hiker towns and cities that dot the trail. Example: Hanover, New Hampshire, a few weeks back:
I sit gazing at the Connecticut River on a patio chair, outside the local hostel. I wear a women’s cat shirt as my main loungewear. By “cat shirt,” in case the term is not at all clear to you, I mean a shirt with cat faces layered throughout as the main decorative motif. I do think I pull off the shirt quite well, all things considering (you can only look so sexy with a cat shirt). One problematic feature: the shirt was several sizes too small, to the point where my skinny receding belly was showing as I sat sunbathing (hello, ladies) in the late July heat. But don’t worry, reader, I still looked quite fetching, and this was my outfit of choice when me and several other fellow hiker trash load up in the hostel cargo van for a trip to town. 
Heavy metal music blasts on the radio, as the van glides through the streets of this upscale New England town. The van stops, and us hikers single file out, dispersing through the small local general store. Me in my cat shirt, my friend Crazy Eyes in his women’s cheetah print top, two belles of this here ball, walk through the aisles of the store under the very approving and admiring gaze of the townies. Product in hand, we sit eating pints of ice cream outside the store, just another pair of hiker trash with cat shirts and cheetah print tops on. 
For the longest time on trail, I cringed at my hiker trash status. It was an identity that brought ready-made community and bonding, yes.... The all-knowing nod to fellow trash at the local bougie grocery store. The holy assemblage of hiker trash outside small town New England package stores in search of beer.   
But I also felt something inherently restrictive about my status as hiker trash. Because my new identity submerged my old personality, and I felt as though I was just one more thru hiker in a sea of other thru hikers, who day after day, year after year, visited the same towns and proliferated at the same establishments, in some endless loop that repeated itself again and again and again. We were all the same, or at least that is what it felt like...the same looks, smell, desires (Soda! Ice cream! Beer!), the same chores to do (Laundry!), the same food to buy (Cliff Bars!). And somewhere along the trail, my old identity, that of Austin, disappeared and became submerged to that of Aces. 
In less than a week, Aces will disappear and go back to being just plain Austin. In many ways, that will be a relief. But I also know there will be aspects and features of my time as Aces that I will miss, and may never get back.Less than a week to go, Aces, until you finish. Live it to the fullest.
***After I summit Katahdin, I plan on writing one last post as a ""wrap-up."" I also plan on posting a small interview with one of my thru hiker friends on trail, Crazy Eyes. Stay tuned!","

Aces,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656626,"""This is the end, beautiful friend."" And so these song lyrics repeated in my head again and again, from The Doors, during the last week of my hike on the AT. 
The Doors. I don't even particularly like them, or Jim Morrison (I mean, what asshole goes around calling himself the Lizard King? But hey, its cool, I guess, because he's a ""poet."")
And this song, from the Doors. I don't even  know the particular words, so I just sing that one line over and over again, mile after mile, through the 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine and on up to Katahdin. 
To my credit, the song does have a particular relevance, because hey! it really was the end. I summited Katahdin yesterday, finishing my thru hike after beginning the journey early in April. 
I finished. 
How bizarre. How strange. It is tough for the mind to process a journey of that length, tough to know how to feel over its conclusion. And for me, someone with the emotional range of , I don't know, a panda bear, my mind all too easily defaults into its tried and true strategy of repress, repress, repress. And so I stupidly sing ""this is the end,"" as a mantra, as a reminder, that the journey was indeed coming to an end, with transition and change coming up nigh. 
If a thru hike has taught me anything, it has shown that life is nothing if not change and movement, of people and places coming and going, memories made and lost, destinations arrived at and left. And perhaps, the real way to honor a thru hike isn't to mourn or celebrate what happened in the past, but to excitedly embrace future goals and adventures. Because it is in the striving for where I feel most alive. What form my striving will next take is where it gets interesting.
On Wednesday August 17, me and two friends were the first people who summited Katahdin that day. We woke up at 4am, and reached the top at 8am. On the going up, i didn't feel anything, anything except perhaps a deep instinctual urge to get to the apex of whatever it was I was climbing. We reached the top together, took a few photos. And then hurried down, in pursuit of the next small mission and objective, which was to reach the base by the time our shuttle was supposed to pick us up. Even after the ending, it seemed, there was always something else to push towards, always something else to distract.
But the funniest thing happened on the way down, as I ran balls-to-the-wall down the mountain (let's just say I gave quite an aggressive shuttle pick up time). Once you get below tree line, after the mile or so of rock scrambling to the top, the mountain flattens out a bit, and you can sorta float down from the top brainlessly.
And as I floated down brainlessly, a single thought appeared, and then repeated itself: ""I did it! I did it! Thank you. Thank you."" I said these words earnestly and excitedly, to myself, over and over. And that is how I ended my thru hike, by repeating those lines softly to myself, in the gray morning light, as I came down off the mountain. 
Before ending this blog, (and God help everyone, this will be the last post), I thought it only fitting that my last words be a few words of thanks for everyone who has helped me on this journey:
Thank you to mom and dad. Without your support, I couldn't complete this hike. I love both of you. 
Thank you to the rest of my family, my brothers, sister, and their partners. Ditto to you what I said above. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you to all my aunts, uncles, and cousins for their support. (Truly, about 95% of this prestigious blog's dedicated readership comes from family. Hello, again, mom and dad, and aunts and uncles). 
Thank you to everyone who read this blog, or sent me any well wishes. It meant more to me than you will ever know. Many a day, when feeling low on the trail, I'd read a text from a friend or a comment on this blog, and it would instantly brighten up my day.
Thank you to everyone I hiked with and became acquainted with on the trail; your companionship made something really hard a little more bearable. 
Thank you to all my old co-workers, who were so supportive of this journey. You are all very missed by me. 
And finally, thank you to all the countless trail angels and volunteer trail maintainers who help make the Appalachian Trail one of the greatest trails on Earth. The more I hiked the trail, the more I realized that the AT is truly one of the special gems of this country, and must be protected and preserved as such.
I wanted to end on one last note: Hiking the Appalachian Trail gives one a first-class lesson on generosity and love. It's up to those who hike the trail, such as myself, to now apply those lessons now that I am home. The hard work begins anew. 
So long, for now.","
