little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650195,"Oh man is it good to be back on trail! Giggles and I had a great day. Weather was perfect. Met some hikers along the way and all but two were women. Mostly thru-hikers and four others out for the day. Lots of rocky ups and downs, few switchbacks or flat trail. Good attitudes and laughter and breaks are a must. The BEST mac and cheese for dinner. Now off to bed with the smell of a campfire thanks to our new friend Area 51. Expecting rain tonight.","Neels Gap

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650328,"for all that you hear about Georgia, yesterday was a pretty enjoyable hike. A lot of flats or small incline climbs. The weather wasn’t too bad since it was overcast some of the day. Much cooler than the day before. Saw many snails in the morning. At least 10 but we stopped counting. Saw a couple of non-poisonous snakes later in the day. We stopped 1 mile south of blue Mountain shelter because someone posted in the app that the last mile was a strenuous rock scramble which was nonexistent we found out. That’s OK because we believe things are as they are meant to be. Maybe we were meant to stay at the tent site so I could find a set of trekking poles that I’m carrying hopefully to their owner who is north of us. It was a quiet night with just us. The stars were absolutely amazing!","Hogpen Gap

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650362,"Slept good last night. Windy but quiet. The stars were out and were SO pretty. Heard an owl hooting in the wee hours and a pack of coyotes around 5:30am. Rocky climbs today. Giggles interviewed Area 51 and later in the day we had trail magic at Unicoi Gap! Apples and oranges!!!! Oh and water, too. Very sweet guy. He’s been doing this for 6-8 years. All in all a good day. Storms predicted for tomorrow so we made it to Hiawassee. Mmmm pizza, chocolate milk, and Gatorade!","Blue Mountain Shelter

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650440,"Lovely zero day in Hiawassee while we wait out this storm. They never get tornado warnings here but today they did. I cannot thank my college friend and BL sister enough for picking us up today. She took us to resupply, treated us to lunch, and then dropped us off at the hotel. We love you Tracy! Our bellies are full and now we are being lazy. A mid-day start for us tomorrow.","

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650511,"Storm rolled through yesterday and we are back on trail thanks to John. Met some new hikers today, a guy solo and a super nice couple from Texas. The flaming azalea really showed off since it was overcast and chilly today. Fixing some soy ramen which sounded so good for the 50 degree temps. Will finish this up and call it a night. All in all a fabulous day!","Unicoi Gap
",Tray Mtn Shelter,"May 07, Sat",5.80
little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650647,Woke up in the fog to a soggy tent. Thankfully everything on the inside was dry. About nine or ten hikers up here last night. Great company and lots of laughs. Lots of ups and downs once we go started. But it was cool and overcast so we are not complaining! Easy breezy into the shelter and camped with about the same number of hikers but some new faces. Calling it a night. Hoping for no rain!,"Tray Mtn Shelter
",Deep Gap Shelter ,"May 08, Sun",7.90
little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650830,"Not a bad day. Lots of PUDS or pointless ups and downs but we made it. Must’ve been the trail magic left by an anonymous trail angel at Dicks Gap - mandarin oranges, water, and cheezits. And our friend Area 5- and her dog Bug rolled in just as we finished dinner. Curly and Cody were fun, too.","Deep Gap Shelter

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650831,"For anyone thinking 7.5 wasn’t much, man are you wrong! The first part of the day was a nice gradual climb but that last three miles, man!!!!! Three climbs and the first two were absolutely straight up. We worked for those miles. This was right after crossing the GA-NC border, a high Lou of the day. We did at least get a view at the top. One of the best so far. About 8-10 at the shelter tonight. Franklin tomorrow and then off to Trail Days!","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650832,A lovely short four miles to deep gap and a ride to Franklin. Off to Trail Days tomorrow! This view was the first one after climbing up that first hill yesterday. So worth it in the end. Bellies full of food and ready to settle in for the night for an early start tomorrow.,"Muskrat Creek Shelter

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650954,"Made it to Damascus! Not much of a crowd this morning. A few vendors are setting up. But the crowd will start coming in later this afternoon. Hoping to see some old friends. We did meet up with Tee from the PCT which was great! Hope to see HeartFire later but know I have the weekend for that. But as always, good to be back!","Franklin via Deep Gap

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650955,"Yep tent city is filling up and overflowing to the field now. Saw HeartFire last night and again today. Weather has been pretty good. Little rainy here and there but nothing too bad. Yet. I cannot say enough good things about the Trail ministry. There’s a group of five or more churches who come together and who are here for a conversation, laundry, showers, vet care, medical care, they are washing feet, and they are feeding us beyond measure. I had a wonderful opportunity to interview one of the leaders of this ministry. They have been doing this since 2001 and it has continued to grow. I was happy to be able to give back today and cut cheese slices for crackers. Giggles has been able to do a few interviews as well. All in all this is been an amazing day! Right now we are just cozied up in our tents letting a little shower pass and will probably get out here in a bit.","Damascus, VA

little one,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651889,"Well, my AT journey is temporarily suspended, at least until Fall. So the evening of Friday, May 13, I began feeling feverish and achy. I took a Tylenol PM around 9pm and crawled in my tent on the quieter side of Tent City. I planned to stop by the medical tent and see the doctors Saturday morning. Fast forward to Saturday. I waited on Giggles to do an interview, drank some coffee, and watched hikers with their ""all you can eat pancake breakfast"" at One Way Ministries. Walked down to the town square and browsed  the gear selections and eventually made my way to the medical tent by First Baptist Church. Still feeling feverish and achy and now have a really sharp pain on my right side. After speaking with three doctors, they all agreed that I should head to the nearest ER, when it's convenient - late that night or early the next morning - and request a CT scan to rule out appendicitis before heading back to the trail. I make a few phone calls - family doc and friend, mom, and the nearest ER - and decide to go ahead now rather than wait. Just to rule it out and get the worry over with. Within three hours I am being prepped for surgery. Appendix had nearly doubled in size and had started to rupture. I cannot thank my good friend, Tee, for bugging me to come to Trail Days. Had I not been there, I likely would've been in the woods and might not have gotten the care I needed. I also need to give big props out to the Trail Ministry team. Linda, who I consider their fearless leader, the wonderful medical team, just the entire group of volunteers. I was definitely cared for and loved on away from home. 
The good news is that my recovery time is 2-4 weeks, mostly no heavy lifting. Walking is good. So, I will be able to head to Oregon the end of June to finish the PCT. Once that is complete, I hope to head back to the AT and finish up New Hampshire and Maine with the 2022 class of hikers. All in a perfect world without any medical emergencies. Keep hiking on and I'll see ya out there!","Damascus, VA
