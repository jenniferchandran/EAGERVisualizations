Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648672,"Today we were up and hiking by 8 with a climb up to Gooch Shelter at 2778ft. The morning was perfect for hiking weather. We made it down to Gooch Gap where there was cold sodas and water. We stood and talked with 5 other hikers who had stayed at the shelter the night before. One lady is out here for 6 months after suffering the loss of her mom to cancer, so please just remember her in your prayers. We then set off for woody gap for lunch and yes real toilets. We made it around 12 after stopping at the first two views that were not obstructed. After eating and taking advantage of the toilet we headed out for our finally 3.5 to camp. We had a 1 mile steep up with a great view of the mountains we had just climbed at Preacher Rock standing at 3700ft. We then climbed up to top of Big Cedar Mountain before making our way down to Lance Creek at 2800ft. When we arrived there must have been 15 tents set up. So after camping with 5 last night we are camping with around 20. GOD BLESS and again thanks for following.","Justus Creek

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648747,"We were up and hiking by 7 because we had 7 miles to Neels Gap and Pepperoni Pizza. We started out climbing 600ft on 1.7 miles. We had great views of the beautiful sunrise while climbing up to Burnett Field Mountain. Then we descended to Jarrett Gap before climbing up to Gaddis Mountain then on up to Turkey Stamp Mountain at 3740ft. We could see Blood Mountain covered in a layer of fog and knew we would have no view today. We stopped for a quick pack off break before starting our climb up Blood Mountain at 4700ft. When we finally made it to the summit it was still foggy and a slight drizzle. Blood Mountain was named after the Cherokee and Croix Indians had a battle, people say the mountain was covered in blood thus the name. We then hiked on a steep downhill for 2.4 before reaching Neels Gap around 11:15. We had to wait about 50 minutes for our pizza because we were about 10th in line. We finished our lunch and headed back out around 12:30. We had a 500ft climb in 1 mile out of Neels Gap after eating. Then we climbed on up to Levelland Mountain at 3942. My knee had started hurting yesterday a little and started getting worse as the day went on. I think it’s my ITB from too much stress from not long distance hiking since 2019. Then in the next 5 miles we made it to Hogpen Gap with the last couple miles very painful on my right knee. We were blessed with a gentlemen at the parking lot. Mr. Owens who has been a part of the AT for 53 yrs and also helped found the Benton McKay trail. He offered to run us into Helen where we are icing my knee. We will Zero tomorrow and continue to ice the knee. We plan to get back out on Thursday which so happens to be my birthday. GOD BLESS and thank you for following and all your prayers.

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648901,"After a day of fellowship with Darrelland his wife we were back on the trail by 8am. It was my birthday so Darrell slackpacked us the first 14 miles before bringing our packs to us. It was very foggy starting out with small up and downs. We hiked by White Oak Stamp then Poor Mountain at 3650ft. We passed a young man heading south, he told us he lost all his gear and was hungry. We gave him some food and then we made our way to Low Gap Shelter for a break. We then hiked about 4 miles on relatively flat ground passing about 10 hikers who had stayed at Low Gap. We then began our climb up to Blue Mountain at 4025ft. The fog had lifted to blue skies and we headed down the mountain on rocky terrain until we reached Unicoi Gap where we met Darrell with our packs and a Strawberry Milkshake. We took a 45 minute break before we started our climb from 2949ft up to 4017ft in 1.4 miles with our packs. We had a great view of the mountains once we reached the top. We then hiked down to Indian Grave Gap before making our way to the Chesse Factory Site where we made camp with 5 other hikers. We camped here in 2010 and 2012 on our other thru hikes. We love this area because at night the owls always talk back and forth all night. GOD BLESS and thanks for following.","Hog pen Gap

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648917,"Last night the wind whipped the entire night, but we had a goodnight of rest. We listened to a couple owls before falling asleep. We were up and hiking by 6:30 this morning with a climb up Tray Mountain at 4430ft. We could see a beautiful sunrise to our right while we were climbing up Tray. After 1.5 miles we reached the top and then in .5 reached the shelter. We then made our way down to Wolfpen Gap and then Steeltrap Gap. We then hike 5 more miles, along the way passing and leapfrogging about 10 to 12 thru hikers. We stopped at Deep Gap Shelter for water and a 15 minute break. The weather was great again with sunshine and blue skies. We had 3.6 more miles to go to reach Dicks Creek Gap which is the last road crossing before reaching the Georgia/North Carolina border. We had a climb up to Powell Mountain before a steep down for 1200ft to reach the road. Many hikers were making the downhill grind complaining of knee pain and their feet screaming at them lol. When we reached the road we hitched the 11 miles down to Hiawassee with a great family, which we are friends on Facebook. If you read this thanks so much for the ride and sodas. We were dropped off at Zaxbys so we could get something to eat. Spirit picked us up so we could celebrate Easter this weekend. We will be back on trail Monday.

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649259,"We finally were able to get back on trail. This morning Spirit and Haley drive us the 2.5 hr drive back to Dicks Creek Gap. We were back on trail at 10 am with 8.9 miles to enter NC. We started at 2675ft on cool chilly day. After about 2.9 miles of mostly climbing we reached Buzzard Knob passing and being passed by about 8 thru hikers. We then made our way just past the shelter turnoff for a break on As Knob at 3460ft. After a break we began the 3.7 climb with a few downs up to the NC/GA line. We arrived around 3 with a girl from NY, another girl can’t remember where she was from and a nice guy from Switzerland. We took photos and celebrated before heading up to bly gap for water. We stopped at the old knarly tree for pictures before starting the huge climb up to Courthouse bald at 4690ft. We then dropped down to the gap before climbing up to Muskrat Creek Shelter. We filled up with water and made our way .8 down to Whiteoak Gap where we made camp. We were the only ones camping there were as probably 20 to 25 hikers were camping at the shelter. GOD BLESS","Dicks creek gap

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649263,"This morning we were up and hiking at 6:45, we knew we had about 23 miles to do and two huge climbs. We woke to a bright moon giving way to clear skies. It was still cool early on so we had to wear our hiking jackets and thermals under our shorts. When we left camp we came to a side trail called chunky gal trail. We then hiked 3.2 miles down to Deep Gap, on the way we seen a bear and we’re lucky enough to gets pics of two owls. It pays to hike early in the morning, we feel this is best chance to see wildlife. We then began the climb up Standing Indian at 5410ft. When we made the summitt we were rewarded with some great views of the mountains and valleys. We stopped at the top for a break seeing 3 other hikers at the top. We then made our way back down 600ft to Beech Gap in 2.9 miles. From here the next 3.2 miles was fairly easy with just flat and gentle up and downs. There were many spots that had water running down the trail but all and all the trail was in good shape. When we reached Carter Gap Shelter we stopped for lunch, consisting of tuna and nabs. We then headed out about 12:45 to climb up to Ridgepole Mountain. From here we hiked 2.3 miles of easy trail to reach Betty Creek Gap where we camped in 2015 on our southbound hike. We then had the task of climbing up to the top of Albert Mountain and the fire tower which has been there since 1951. The last mile was tough and rocky but we finally made the top at 4 and we were rewarded with some stunning views. There were 4 other hikers there and one girl said so this is your 5th time here and we were surprised. She said she had messaged us about some gear before starting our thru hikes. She wanted a photo with us and she also got a few of us under the tower. Then this hiker we had leapfrogged a couple times made it to the top. He is from Australia and he is 62 yrs old. He said he is loving the trail very much. He was a great guy to talk to before we all headed down the mountain. The shelter was 2.5 miles down but the last 2 miles was really flat and easy. We filled up with water and then hiked another 1 mile before finding camp at Glassmine Gap. Thanks for following and GOD BLESS also we found some ramps which we ate today to ward of all the vampires, if you have had ramps you know what I’m talking about.","WhiteOak stamp

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649337,"This morning we were up and hiking by 6:30 in the fog and by headlamp the first 15 minutes. We had a little climb up before leveling out and then heading down to rock gap after 2.7 miles. We seen 2 deer this morning but that was it for wildlife. We then hiked 3.6 more miles until we reached Winding Stairs Gap. About 1.8 miles before the gap we were pelted by freezing fog ice pellets. We were met at the Gap by a friend who we met watching the sunset at Waterrock knob. If you ever want to see an amazing sunset go to Waterrock on the Parkway. There were about 12 other hikers waiting for the city bus to get into Franklin. CP drove us to wal mart then to Hardee’s for breakfast. He then surprised us with a slackpack from Wayah Gap back to Winding Stairs which is 6 more miles. We gladly excepted, then he offered us a place to stay with him and his wife then slackpack us tomorrow 22 miles to the NOC. We gladly excepted, we decided this is our 5th thru hike and we are going to make it a fun unconventional thru hike. We will not skip a white blaze but we will hike with a pack or not and will hike south some and north some. We call this thru hike, never again because this is our last thru of the AT. We plan to reach Fontana on Sunday and then enter the smokies on Monday. Thank you for following and GOD BLESS ","Glassmine Gap

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649398,"This morning we had a 1hr and 15 minute ride back to the trail with CP. We arrived at 6:30 and had a long climb of 4.2 miles and 1200ft of elevation. It was a great morning with temps already 50 degrees. It was a big change from yesterday morning when we were pelted with ice pellets coming into winding stairs gap. When we reached the intersection with the Bartram Trail about 1.9 from the top we seen about 8 tents set up. We then made our way to the top, but just before the top we seen something for the first time hiking. We seen a bobcat just stroll across the trail about 15 ft in front of us with not a worry in the world. When we reached Wayah Bald Tower we were rewarded with magnificent views with fog in the valleys and a beautiful sunrise. We then started a descent down to Wayah Shelter where maybe 10 more tents were set up. We seen a deer on the way down. We made our way to Burningtown Gap, this is where in 2013 we met up with hiker friends from 2012 and set up to provide trail magic for the thru hikers, we ended up camping 3 nights and feeding 3 meals a day. We then climbed up to Cold Springs Shelter where we camped in 2010 on our 1st thru hike. We met Blackbeard from SC, and a nice elderly couple out for a section hike. We then went from 5080ft down to 3850 at Tellico Gap where we had lunch after 14.5 miles. Forgot to mention we were slackpacking one more day with CP. We had lunch and then climbed 1.4 miles up to Wesser Bald Observation Tower where we had some 360 degree views. We met a guy thru hiking and 3 ladies out for a day hike. We then had a tough rocky ridge line part of trail, being exposed to the hot sun. It felt like we were back in California hiking in the desert. After passing Jump-up which was an exposed rock outcropping we had a 3.9 mile downhill. We had to maneuver over and around blow downs along with trail that was falling off the side of the mountain. We finally reached Rufus Morgan Shelter where 10 more tents were set up. We had a easy .8 to the NOC and an end to our day. On the way down we seen our first two snakes which were the yellow ring neck blacksnakes. CP and Lois were waiting on us at the NOC. We loaded up and headed back to Clyde for one more evening before heading out tomorrow with packs from the NOC. Thank you for following along and GOD BLESS","Waugh Gap S.R. 1310

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649529,"This morning CP dropped us off at the NOC around 7:45. We had to say goodbye and head towards Fontana, while CP and Lois headed to Myrtle Beach. We had one of the longest climbs on the AT, at 6 miles and 3000ft of elevation. It was a very hot day and at times felt like we were having a heat stroke. From the NOC we made our way up up and up until at mile 3 we reached the plaque where the man died fighting a forest fire in the area. We stopped for a break before continuing up and up and up. We didn’t see but one other hiker the first 6 miles. After the break after starting at 1723 fr we made our way up to Swim Bald at 4720ft. Our legs were shaky by the time we made it to the top and then we had 1 mile down to Sassassafras shelter for lunch and water. We met about 6 other hikers there with most slackpacking back to the NOC from Stecoah Gap. After lunch we climbed the last 1.2 up to Cheoah Bald at 5062ft where we had views and met a guy from mass and a lady from mass as well but lives in Pa. They were very nice and after a chat we started making the 5.5 miles down to Stecoah Gap. We passed the start of the Bartram trail and then started descending steeply on a rocky path. We made it down to Locust Cove Gap were we filled our water supplies. Every water source you see you have to stop because it’s so hot out and you drink a lot of water. We left the two we met at the top here and made our way on down to Stecoah. When we were about to the bottom we passed three men going down with two wearing blue jeans. When we reached the bottom we took a break, this is where we always do trail magic. The men said they were from New Orleans and had hiked two days for 12 miles total and were not moving until they were picked up in the morning. When we told them it was our 5th thru hike and we had done 15 miles already they thought we were nuts. We then had the terrible climb up Jacobs Ladder then down to our campsite. After 17.4 miles on a very hot day we were ready for bed. We made camp and ate, then we both passed out. Thank you for following and GOD BLESS .","NOC

We chatted for awhile before heading out. The trail this morning was not bad just rolling along the ridge line before descending down to Yellow Creek Gap,N.C. We then in .8 made our way to Cable Gap Shelter where Blackbeard was eating and we needed a break. We had a nice conversation with him and filled our water up to make the 5.5 mile hike to Fontana. We had a 600ft climb before ridge line hiking. We then had a couple steep downs before finally reaching the Fontana Marina. We bought two sodas and two honeybuns to fuel us the 1.5 over to the Fontana dam. We had a 1.2 mile woods hike over to the Fontana Hilton Shelter. Back in 2010 and 2012 the trail was on the road mostly to the dam but the built trail thru the woods  to the shelter. We then made the .4 to the dam which is famous for the fugitive scene where Harrison Ford jumped off the dam. Spirit was there to get us with juicy burgers and fries. We are currently in Cherokee making our plans for the smokies section. It has been a tough, hot 3 days but we are plugging along. Thank you for following and GOD BLESS.","Browns Fork Gap Shelter

Honeymoon hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649634,"This is the hardest journal ever to right. I’ll first tell about our hike then what’s going on. We started at 7 this morning and crossed over the Fontana Dam to enter the smokies. This dam is the one Harrison Ford jumped off in the fugitive. We had a 1 mile walk up the ride before turning left and entering the woods. We had a 4.7 mile hike with 3.6 of climbing from 1821ft to 3800ft. We made our way to the top and reached Shuckstack Firetower overlooking Fontana Lake. We stopped for a break and then headed on into the smokies passing about 30 youth with leaders hiking a section. We made our way to Sassafras Gap,Locust Grove Trail and Twentymile trail Jct. This is where in 2012 on our second thru we had to hurry and jump in our tent right before two storms collided and dumped 4 inches of hail on us in our tent. We then hiked 3 miles to Mollies Ridge where we resupplied our water and took a break after 11 miles of hiking in perfect weather. We then set out for Russell Field Shelter 3 more miles down the trail. We seen probably 10 other thru hikers along the way. When we reached the shelter we stopped and reminisce for about 20 minutes about our 4 thru hikes and 1000 miles of sections of the trail before finally making a left turn to head down the mountain. We took a 5.1 mile side trail to Cades cove to meet Spirit and call our hiking on the AT over. What has happened the last two days is that we got a message that moms kidneys have quit working and has been catheter. Also our grandchildren have started their first season of softball and we hate missing it. So with that being said we are going home and will plan a shorter long trail in August and it will be probably the Tahoe Rim because we have always wanted to to that. We decided 9800 miles on the AT is enough. Again thank you for following and please pray for my mom at this time. But please keep following bc we still have many trails to hike and adventures ahead.
