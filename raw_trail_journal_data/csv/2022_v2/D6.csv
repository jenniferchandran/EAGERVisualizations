D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/353227,"The plan for this year is to hike the AT in Maine SOBO. I'll do Katahdin Stream Campground to the summit of Katahdin as a day hike. Then, I'll do Katahdin Stream Campground to Abol Bridge as a day hike. After that, I plan to backpack to Gorham, NH.This hike will be a good change from the Colorado trail, which I did about half of last year. I'm looking forward to the varied vegitation of Maine. Last year I saw way too many Lodgepole Pines (many dead from pine beatles. It would be great to see a moose - time will tell.","

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/353231,"2011 Day Hike Today was a day hike to knock off Baxter Peak via the Hunt Trail/AT. I've been up Katahdin about seven times over the years, but never on this trail.I left the Katahdin Stream Campground at about 7:20 AM. It was a clear and sunny day with comfortable temperatures.    The first mile or so was easy with moderate grades and a smooth trail. After passing Katahdin Falls, the trail got progressively harder. After about two miles, the rock scrambling began. Moreover, started to get some great view.   In a few places I had to haul myself up using steel rung anchored to the rock. Made steady progress all the way to the table lands. Then it was time for a sit-down rest. As I was sitting there enjoying the view, I heard a flapping sound overhead. The group that was ahead of me had a kite and they were having a grand time flying it. Fine view to the south over the land I’ll be traversing on this year’s hike. Looking down, there was just a little snow left on the flanks of Katahdin.Easy walk across the tablelands to the summit. Arrived at 11:20 AM. Four hours up – not a bad time for me. Must have been 30 or so people there. Outstanding views in all directions – across the knife edge and down to Chimney Pond.Started back down at about noon. Easy jaunt across the tablelands. Then, slow and careful going down over the boulders. It was harder going down than up, especially at the places with the steel rungs. Not being a proud hiker, I got down the best way I could, including sliding down on my backside.   The sky had developed some high clouds but still great views. Had to remember to look where I was going, not just the views. Back at the car at 4:40 PM – 4 hr 20 min. down.The total mileage for this round trip was 10.4 mi.","Baxter Peak

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/353260,"2011 Day Hike  Today was a day hike loop that covered the AT from Katahdin Stream Campground to Abol Bridge. For the northbound leg of the loop I went up the Blueberry Ledge Trail, then picked up the AT at Katahdin Stream Campground and hiked back to Abol Bridge. Starting weather was overcast and threatening rain. I was carrying my full pack today (ULA Catalyst) so it was a good workout.I parked at the junction of the Golden Road and AT southbound and got hiking at about 7:45 am. Just after starting, two retired gents passed me SOBO. One was “Eats-a-lot” and can remember the other guy’s trail name. They were doing from Katahdin to Dalton, MA to complete their hike of the whole AT. No views from Abol Bridge due to low clouds. I followed the AT to junction with Abol Pond Trail. Then I went up this trail to Blueberry Ridge Trail. The first half of Blueberry Ledge Trail followed an old logging road so it was easy walking. From the ledges there would have been good view, but not today. There was a great stream roaring away where the trail crossed the ledges. At the ledges, the logging road ended and the trail worked its way through the woods. At some point it started to rain including a 15 min. downpour. The trail was wet in a few places and required wading through a stream at one point. I gave up trying to keep my shoes dry.   Reached Katahdin Stream Campground at 10:45 and took a break under a shelter. I rung some of the water out of my socks.Back on the trail at 11 AM, now on the AT SOBO.   They have rerouted the AT starting at the campground to avoid a road walk on the Park Tote Road. The rain stopped – yay! Pleasant walk by Grassy and Daicey Ponds. Stopped by Big Niagara Fall for lunch. Two NOBO thru hikers passed me. They were going to summit tomorrow – congratulations to them. They were both college grads. Easy walking. Forded the steam twice – no point in taking my shoes off – already soaking wet. Reached the West Branch of the Penobscot River where the trail became an old road grade. The only problem was mosquitoes – I had my own personal swam of about 200 of them. In midafternoon the sun came out. Back at my car at about 4 PM.About 9.9 miles on AT with an additional 5 miles or so to make the loop.I start backpacking on July 2. I'll update the journal when I can.","Katahdin Stream Campground

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/383728,"2011 Day 1 – 7/2/2011 Abol Bridge to unnamed side trail (9.7 mi.)Mostly sunny – wonderful day.Pat and Doug dropped me off at Abol Bridge. We arrived at about 1 PM. Katahdin was clearly in view so took some starting pictures from the bridge. I started to hike at 1:15 PM. Easy hiking through Maine woods – spruce with a few birches. I arrived at Hurd Brook Lean-to at 2:45 PM – 3.5 miles in 1.5 hrs. This is a fast pace for me, even for an easy trail. Two college age women were trying to decide if they were going to continue south or stay there for the night. Hurd Brook was a hop-across. Steady climb up to Rainbow Ledges. The views are from the southern end of this long ridge. Katahdin looks magnificent.I continued south and got to SE end of Rainbow Lake at 5 PM. Refilled 1 L water bottle from the stream that drains Little Beaver Pond.   The plan was to stay somewhere around here for the night, but I had plenty of energy and daylight left, so I pushed on. I passed “Three Hats” who was camping 0.2 mi. from Little Beaver Stream. She had done the southern half of the AT and had now flipped to do the northern half.I planned to hike till 6 PM, but no good campsites. At about 6:30 PM, I turned down an unmarked side trail toward the lake. This was 9.7 mi. from Abol Bridge. The trail led to a sand beach with a picnic table. I have my tent in the woods about 100 ft from the beach.I took a dip in the lake. The water was very cold, but it felt great. I watched the sunset while I had my dinner. I took some great pictures. Sunset was at 8:17 PM. As I fell asleep, I could hear a generator humming away in the next cove. What a great first day!","Abol Bridge

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/383729,"2011 Day 2 – Unnamed side trail to Wadleigh Stream Lean-to (13.4 mi.)Overcast with a few showers.Loons were out on the lake last night. At times they were making quite a racquet and were clearly having a grand time. Up at 5:05 AM. I had breakfast at the picnic table overlooking the lake. The lake was perfectly calm. I was on the trail at 7 AM.It was easy walking along the lake. I took the side trail to Rainbow Lake Dam. There was a fine view of Katahdin. Three guys had camped there overnight and were still breaking camp. Mostly, they appeared to be fishing. They told me that the generator that I heard was from a camp owned by Webber Oil. There are five or six cabins at the camp.Once I was back on the AT, a guy from Maine passed me NOBO. He was out for a couple of days. Rainbow Stream Lean-to was in a fantastic gorge with moss and fern covered rock walls. For the next mile or so, the trail followed the gorge of Rainbow Stream.   It had many impressive rapids and falls.I crossed a road bridge over Pollywog Creek and then began the climb up to the overlook for Pollywog Gorge. The gorge was quite deep but hard to see from the overlook. The trail circled past Crescent Pond.   There were many gnawed stumps indicating recent beaver activity.I continued to climb up Nesuntabunt Mountain. There was an overlook about 1/2 mile from the summit and from the summit itself. There were great views of Katahdin and Nanmakanta Lake below. It was overcast so Katahdin was dark and brooding today. I encountered a mom and her son doing the 100 Mile Wilderness and a couple from Columbus, OH doing the same thing. The trail followed an impressive rock gorge on the way down. The trail was a little frustrating at times because first it would go down and then back up again.I am at Wadleigh Stream Lean-to with Three-Hats and a couple from Bowdoin, ME. Light rain in late afternoon, but I was already at the shelter. I learned that three hats went to college at Bowdoin and is a graphic designer in New York City.","Unnamed side trail 9.7 mi.

The rain woke me up a couple of times. I was up for good at 5:05 AM and on the trail at 6:45 AM. When I left, Three Hats was still sleeping and the couple from Bowdoin was about ready to leave.The trail went down to Nahmakanta Lake, then back up to a bluff overlooking the lake, then back down again. Fine views of the lake with low clouds on the surrounding hills. The sun had not quite burned through yet.From Nahmakanta Lake to Maher Tote Road, the trail followed Nahmakanta Stream. Along the way, I saw a cow moose grazing the river bottom. I could not get a good picture because of the riverside vegetation. As I maneuvered for a better shot, I scared the moose and she waded over to the other side of the river. Back on the trail, there were areas of roots, rocks, and mud but not too bad. Arrived at Maher Tote Road at 10:45 AM.There was a 25 min. walk to the boat landing. I sounded the air horn and Bill came right over and picked me up.I’m in a cabin with The Red Team, who are thru hiking and will summit Katahdin on Friday. Hazel a SOBO thru hiker is also here. He is from Virginia and lives about 15 min. drive from the trail. The Red Team is from all around (D.C. at the moment). The husband is originally from Michigan and his family owns and runs a campground. Today is their 5th wedding anniversary.I had the 1-lb. deluxe burger for lunch. It was just right. Did laundry in the wash tub. Now that the cloths are hanging up to dry but it is threatening rain. I can hear thunder in the distance. In the end, just a few drops.Three hats came in during mid-afternoon, making the hiker crew five.After dark, Bill (one of the owners) launched a “fire boat” with bottle rockets in it. After about 5 min. the bottle rockets cooked off. Three hats had sparklers for the crew to help celebrate the 4th.","Wadleigh Stream Lean-to

We had scrambled eggs, English muffins, and blueberry pancakes. Bill and Linda are great hosts. They are trying to sell the place. If they are successful, this may be the last year for this hiker haven in the wilderness.Bill took the hikers back to a spot only 0.2 mi. from the AT. At the junction at 9:45 AM. The trail went through low-lying forest. It was boggy in places with some puncheons. I took a short side trail to Pemadumcook Lake for today’s view of Katahdin. The trail went up and over Potaywadjo Ridge then on to Lower Jo Mary Lake. I checked out the sand beach right where the trail first reaches the lake. A couple from Bar Harbor had kayaked to this beach.I had lunch at the Antlers Campsite.   I arrived at 12:15 PM. A group of tents from a boy’s summer camp group was there. I took the first swim of the day. I got back on the trail at 1 PM. I then went on to Copper Brook Falls Lean-to. I was at the Jo Mary road at 2:45 PM and had the only sit-down break of the afternoon. From this point on the trail followed an old logging road, so it was easy walking. The area around Copper Brook Falls Lean-to was crowded with two summer camp groups. Hazel and Three Hats are staying there for the night. I pushed on to Crawford Pond, arriving at 6:10 PM. I am camped by a sand beach. I took my second swim of the day. As I sit in my tend reading the back of the AT map, I see that this is a no-camping area – oops! It is too late now.This was a 17 mile day. Not bad considering the late start. My feet and hips felt somewhat better today. I was a little tired at the end of the day, but not bad.I leapfrogged with Hazel all day. The bugs and his foot were bothering him. He had injured the foot about 8 mo. ago. I offered him some ibrupropin for the latter, but he was going to tough it out.Real breakfast, three lakes, two swims, sunny, 17 miles – what a great day.I hope to make it to Sidney Tappan Campsite tomorrow – 14.1 miles.","Maher Tote Road (White House Landing)

Soon after getting up I heard something splashing in the lake. I went down to the lake in time to see the hind end of a moose heading into the woods. Ate my breakfast on the beach – very tranquil.On the trail at 6:45 am. Steady climb up to Little Boardman. Some views of Whitecap Mountain just after the summit.   After taking this picture, I forgot and left the camera on when I put it away. When I took it out about 15 min. later to take another picture the message on the screen said “deleting” – arghhh! I couldn’t figure out on short notice how to stop it so I just shut the camera off.    From the number of pictures in memory, I can’t tell if it deleted some pictures - hopefully not. [p.s., when I got home I could tell no pictures were deleted].I made steady progress to the East Branch Lean-to, arriving at 9:15 AM. One SOBO was still there, “T-something”. Next it was on to the Logan Brook Lean-to. It was easy going at first, then the trail steepened up. I met two trail maintainers from Nova Scotia who were trimming back the growth on the side of the trail. I arrived at Logan Brook Lean-to at 11:30 and had Part I of lunch (PB and crackers). Here I met two more trail maintainers (also from Nova Scotia) who were carrying up a new sign for the summit. One is an industrial engineer and had his “iron ring” on, signifying his membership in the “Order of the Engineer” (I’m also a member). I filled up on the cool water from the nearby stream.Left for the summit at about 12:15 PM. It was steep going in places. Some stretches had hand placed rock steeps. It must have been a ton of work to place. I arrived at the summit at 1:45 PM and took a picture of the old sign. The two trail maintainers arrived and put up the new sign. I helped to pile rocks around the base of the new post then took a picture of the new sign. Thus, I was the last person to take a picture of the old sign and the first to take a picture of the new one. I had part two of lunch – a shelf stable Bickford pepperoni sandwich. It was OK. The pepperoni was just a stick. The views from Whitecap were not the best – very hazy. I could just make out Katahdin.I left the summit at about 2:15 PM. First it was down off Whitecap, then up Haystack, down off Haystack, up West Peak, and finally down to Sydney Tappan Campsite. I took several sit down rests along the way.   I arrived at the campsite at 5:10 PM. I set up my tent. The campsite was adequate, but nothing to write home about except for the ice-cold spring. This was the best water so far. As I made my dinner, I could hear a thunderstorm rolling in from the south. I had just started to eat the main course (chicken and rice) when it started to rain. I got everything buttoned up and then finished eating in my tent. It was pouring, but the tent kept everything out except for a little splashing in through the mosquito netting on the sides. It is 8:30 PM and it has stopped raining. The storm has cooled things off.Today was 14.1 miles. The climb from the East Branch of the Pleasant River to Whitecap was 2, 400 ft. More than enough work for today.   Tomorrow could be 11.7 miles to Chairback Gap Lean-to with just one down and one up or 18.6 miles to Cloud Pond Lean-to with many more ups and downs. We will see how I feel.","Crawford Pond

The clouds were hanging around at the start of the day, but they burned off producing the best backpacking weather I have ever had. There were just a few puffy clouds in a blue sky, low humidity, and a light breeze.The first part of the day’s hike was mostly downhill to the West Branch of the Pleasant River. This was 7.3 miles and I arrived at 10:50 PM. I switched to my Crocks and waded across. I refilled on water then was on my way at 11:10 PM. Now the real work of the day began. It was a steady climb to the junction with the East Chairback Pond Trail. This is where I stopped for lunch. I had Bickford shelf-stable bread with P.B. and J.   This was the best trail lunch. The bread is like two end pieces from a loaf, however can’t be picky on the trail and it was very tasty.There were beautiful woods of spruce and the forest floor was covered with bright green moss. The trail skirted some ledges for the first of many outstanding views. Whitecap Mt. was very clear across the valley. Then it was climbing and rock scrambling to the top of Chairback where more views awaited. Then it was down to Chairback Gap Lean-to. One SOBO was there (Mr. Z). The time was 2:50 and the weather was outstanding so I had to move on. Up and over Columbus Mt. (more views), then down again. I refilled on water at the outlet to West Chairback Pond. Decision – stay at this lake? It was still too early and the weather was great, so on I went. It was an easy climb up Third Mountain, then down again. It was a long push to get to the base of Fourth Mt., then climbing again. I was on the top at 6:30 PM. Finally, I could see what I had been looking for all day – Katahdin off in the distance. This made the push worth it.Now it was down again and halfway up Barren Mt to Cloud Pond Lean-to. I’m the only one in the shelter but a group of boys and girls from a camp in Wiscasset are here. I had a nice chat with three of them.This was a 18.6 mile day (plus a 0.3 mi. side trail to the lean-to) – a record for me.   I was hiking from 7:05 AM to 8:10 PM – not bad. The terrain after 11 AM was challenging so I earned those miles. Moreover, the last mile was uphill. My left knee was a little sore near the end of the day.   My stamina was good as I was only tired for the last half-mile or so. Tomorrow I hope I can make it 16.1 miles to Leeman Brook Lean-to.","Sidney Tappan Campsite

On the way out, I passed the camp group and saw that it was co-ed, not just boys like I had thought last night. One of the councilors was a Long Trail end-to-ender (’03). Looks like the group’s routine is to break camp and pack up, then they get breakfast. That prevents dilly dallying!At junction with AT at 7:30. On summit of Barren Mt. at 8 AM. Clear with great views to west and south. The tower from an old lookout was still there. Steep downhill to Long Pond Stream Lean-to, then the first ford of the day at about 11 am.   On to Wilson Valley Lean-to, arriving at about 2:30 PM. It was too early to stop for the day and the weather was good, so I moved on. There were another two fords (Wilson and Little Wilson). Each of these fords eats up ½ hr., with talking off shoes and socks, putting on crocks, wading across, taking off crocks, drying off feet, putting socks and shoes back on. The 60-ft falls on Little Wilson were stupendous, with water cascading over the schist bedrock. I left the falls at 3:30 and arrived at Leeman Brook Lean-to at 7:40 PM.A lot of ups and downs today, but I just kept chugging along. My left knee was sore again near the end of the day. I am the only person in the shelter. I talked to a woman from Las Vegas who is doing Katahdin to Monson. She is new to backpacking and asked lots of questions about gear. I think she said that the base weight of her pack was 42 lb. – a heavy load.Monson tomorrow – time for sleep.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

She is a middle school counselor in Las Vegas school system and has four grown daughters. On the trail at 6:45 am. Easy walking to Rt. 15. Walked past three lakes and over some ledges (low by Maine standards). I reached Rt. 15 at 8:30 am. It was a great feeling to have completed the 100-mile wilderness.

The trail was easy for most of the day. I walked through mixed forest of spruce and hardwoods. The first river crossing was the East Branch of the Piscataquis River. The water was high but it was flowing at a placid pace. It was an easy crossing. The water went up to my thighs.I had lunch at Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to just after noon. The river at this location is running through a narrow canyon with an impressive cascade. I met Chris and Becky at the crossing of the West Branch of the Piscataquis River. They are SOBO thru hikers from the Bay Area of California. This river was running very high. I made it across using my hiking poles for balance.   The water came up to my waist. Chris and Becky used the crossing rope that was installed a few days ago. Bald Mountain Stream was also a ford. That made for three fords today. For animals today, I saw five small snakes and lots of chipmunks. I arrived at Moxie Bald Lean-to at about 5:50 PM. Chris and Becky are here plus 10 boys from a French speaking summer camp group. Many are French Canadians but there were a handful of Americans too. If one of them spoke English, they needed to do something like ten pushups on the spot. They are out for 17 days and are doing from Baker Stream to the Big K. I took a swim in the lake. The sunset was beautiful. The setting sun was reflecting off the clouds to the east.

Steady climb up Moxie Bald. Peanut-Eater passed me going north. He is a thru hiker and averaging 20 miles a day. He looked to be 65+. From is accent I place him as a Brit. There were great views from the top of Moxie Bald. White Cap and the Barren-Chairback Range could be seen to the north. Maybe there was a glimpse of Katahdin?   To the south were the Bigelows and Sugarloaf. On the way down the trail passed under some massive overhanging rocks. I forded Baker Stream – no problem. The water was a little more than knee deep. Walked down the road and rested where the trail headed south. I left at 11 AM for the 4.8 mile climb up Pleasant Mountain.The climb was steep in places. I passed through some pure stands of spruce and fir. About halfway up I started to encounter some ledges with some views to the north. A few sprinkles of rain. There were several minor summits before the true top. What this means is that you gain some elevation then loose most of it and then gain it back again.Chris and Becky caught up with me at the summit of Pleasant Mountain. It was a short (1.4 mi.) descent to Pleasant Pond Lean-to. It started to rain again, so I called it a day. I had visions of making it a little further and camping by Holly Brook, but this was not to be. I set up my tent on a wide section of trail leading to the pond.At the shelter are Grand Dad, Chris, Becky, and Uncle Tex. The latter is a counselor for a summer camp in Maine. He is leading a group of six or so boys on a 20 miles hike from Monson to Caratunk. They are basically going from shelter to shelter (although the boys are staying in their tents). Uncle Tex is the tennis instructor at the camp and was not the right person to be leading a backpacking trip. I’m sure the parents of these boys are paying good money to send them to camp – if they only knew. Grand Dad is a NOBO thru hiker. I estimate that he was 65+. It looks like he was getting quite thin.I took a swim in the lake. I plan an early start tomorrow so I can be at the Kennebec River before 9 AM. If I can, I’d like to hike the 6.0 miles to the river plus another 13.7 miles to West Carry Pond. This will be a 19.7 mile day, but it is “flat”. We will see!","Moxie Bald Shelter

Holly Brook was very nice. The only steep part of the trail was coming out of the valley of Holly Brook. There was trail magic in Cartunk. I had a banana. I was at the river at 8:10 AM.

The trail alternated between the river’s edge and the hillside well above. Thus, there were plenty of ups and downs on a rocky and “rooty” trail.Pierce Pond was the first of three spectacular lakes. I arrived at about 11:30 AM. There were fine views from the wood plank and rockfill outlet dam. The longest segment of the day was to East Carry Pond. The trail alternated between rocks, mud, and well-graded trail. A long and very elaborate bridge crossed the North Branch of Carry Place Stream. Maybe 200 ft long made from 3x6 timbers. This avoided the need to ford this swamp.Next was East Carry Pond. Other than a few camps on one corner, this lake is undeveloped. I would call this lake pristine. Most of the trail followed a narrow, low rocky ridge that bordered the lake. On the side away from the lake was swamp, so no place to camp. I’m wondering what formed this rocky ridge – could it have been shifting ice over the centuries that has dozed up this ridge? My original plan had been to camp at this lake – glad I was early enough to be able to move on.I talked to Dave from CT at this lake. When he reaches Grafton Notch, he will have done all of the AT in New England. He was hiking from Monson to Grafton with no resupply and no town stops.Next was the last push to West Carry Pond. I arrived at 5:15 PM. This pond is just as spectacular as the others. I took a swim in the lake – swimming three days in a row!I’m here with seven SOBO thru hikers (including Chris and Becky) plus section hiker Dave. The SOBO’s are bunched up because they were all held up in Monson by the rain storm that dumped six inches of rain in the Brownville area one night the prior week and made the rivers to dangerous to cross.As I write this, I can hear the loons down at the lake. I’m tenting tonight near the shelter. Hopefully I’ll cover 14.6 miles tomorrow.","Pleasant Pond Lean-to

There were two showers in the evening – one with lightning.I slept quite well last night. The only thing that woke me up in the middle of the night was the loons in the lake making a racket.I was up at 5 AM and on the trail at 6:30 AM. I put the tent away as soon as I got up, which was a good thing as I got it down just before the rain started.It was an easy walk for the morning. Just a 500 ft climb up the flank of Round Top Mountain, then down to Long Falls Dam Road.   NOBO thru hiker “Metro North” passed me. At the road crossing I met a group of young NOBO thru hikers. I took their pictures at this “2000 mile” mark.Next was a climb of 300 ft then down to Flagstaff Lake. As I was taking a break at the lake a loon swam within 40 ft of me. Unfortunately my camera was out of reach. There are several good campsites near the lake with a privy. The signage was not the same as used by the MATC, so maybe this one is maintained by a canoeing group?Next it was up Little Bigelow. I had an early lunch (10:30 AM) at Little Bigelow Lean-to, so I’d be dry. Chris, Becky, and Dave were there too. I was on the trail again a little after 11 AM. It had stopped raining so I took off my rain gear. I was on the top at 12:30 PM. There were some views down to the lake.Next it was ups and downs to get to Safford Notch. In the process, I lost 800 ft of elevation. Now for the big climb of the day – 2000 ft in 1.9 mi. to get to the top of Avery Peak. At the bottom, the trail treaded its way through boulders as big as a bus. I left the notch at 3 PM and was on top at 5 PM. There were some nice views but there was a cold breeze so I did not stay long. I was at campsite just after 5:30 PM. I set up on a tent platform.   With some ingenuity, I was able to get my tent, which needs to be staked in seven places, set up on the platform. Chris, Becky, Dave, and three SOBO thru hikers are here. Two rain storms. I ate my dinner in the vestibule of the tent to keep dry.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

I was on the trail at 6:40 AM.First I went over West Peak and then South Horn. They were both in the clouds. Then I dropped down to Horns Pond. Chris and Becky were there taking a break. After this it was a big drop to Cranberry Stream Campsite. The trail was rocky with several ledges to maneuver down.A group of boys from a Maine Summer Camp (same one that Uncle Tex was from) passed me on the way up. It was late in the morning and they were still near the bottom. The leader looked to be 16 and barely old enough to shave. They were doing the whole loop in a day. This was a big task for small boys with a late start. Again, little do the parents know what kind of supervision their boys are getting.I was at ME 27 at 12:15 PM.

I had lunch (tuna melt) at the Stratton Dinner with Chris and Becky. Then dinner with them at the bar across the road (pizza).I’m glad I’m in a motel room tonight as this gives me the chance to dry everything out.

It was hot at times.Great breakfast at the Stratton Dinner. I had the “Hollow Leg” – two eggs, bacon, hash browns, one slice of toast, and two blueberry pancakes. The latter were outstanding – loads of blueberries.Sue took us back to the trail head. We were hiking at 8:30 AM. First it was a long climb up to North Crocker. 2,700 ft of elevation gain in 5.2 miles. There were a few views to the north near the top. Not too bad as Maine trails go. Next it was on to South Crocker. There were impressive views of Sugarloaf, Spaulding, and Abraham. I had lunch on this peak from 1:00 to 1:30 PM. Next it was down to the South Branch of the Carrabassett River. The trail crossed some old rockslides with some impressive views of the Bigelows. I refilled on water at the river – it was a hot day and I needed to drink a lot.At 3:10PM I left the river for the climb out of the valley. It was a 1,500-ft climb and very steep near the bottom – climbing over rocks and exposed ledges. Two peak baggers from Massachusetts based me on their way down (Usta – as in used to work; and Uda). There were other peak baggers out today. Views of the vast Maine woods to the southwest. I was at the Sugarloaf Side Trail at 5:10 PM. I managed just over 2 miles in 2 hours, i.e., 1 mph.The final push was 3 miles to the Spaulding Mountain Lean-to.   I arrived at 6:50 PM. I’m tenting behind the shelter.

There were great views from where the trail crossed Route 17. At this crossing, I caught up with a couple from Brewer who are hiking with their three Labradors (two black and one chocolate). They both work at Brewer High School.I crossed Bemis Stream on a tree that was down over the river using my hiking poles for balance. I started the climb up Bemis at 5 PM – felt good. Incredible views to the north with the late day sun. I could see all the way to North and South Horn in the Bigelows. I saw a beautiful brown rabbit up on the ridge.The area around the Bemis Mountain Lean-to was very crowded with both NOBO’s and SOBO’s. There was no place to set up my tent. Fortunately they made room for me in the shelter. Dave from CT was there along with the couple with the three dogs.

The soles of my feet and my knees hurt plus others in the shelter were tossing and turning.I was up at 5 AM and on the trail at 6:15 AM. The early start was possible because of a cold breakfast and no tent to roll up. Dave from CT started at the same time as I did but that was the last I saw of him.It was a nice hike up Bemis #3 and the main summit of Bemis. Just a few views to the north. Then it was on to Old Blue. The trail was rocky and rooty with plenty of small ups and downs. It was hard to make good time and it was hard on my knees.I was on top of Old Blue at 10 AM. Great views to the southwest, including the White Moutains. I could see Rumford White Cap to the southeast. I called Pine Ellis. Dave said he was making a noon pickup. I left the summit at 10:20 AM, so it was going to be tight to make the noon pickup. I had to book it down a hard trail – rocks, roots, and steep. In places there were steel rungs drilled into the rock for foot holds. The lower part of the trail had great views into the narrow valley of South Arm Road. I was at the road at 11:40 AM. Dave and the hikers ahead of me were waiting. Dave had cold lemon-aid for the group. I was at Pine Ellis just after noon.I did town chores – shower, laundry, eating, and phone calls. Chris and Becky arrived at about 3 PM.I saw the couple from Brewer with the three dogs. They had to get off the trail.

I was up at 5 AM then breakfast with Chris and Becky at the general store at 6 AM. Dave gave us a ride back to the trail. We were hiking at 7:20 AM.Today was a day of many climbs – three major ones totaling more than 5,000 ft of elevation gain. The first was Moody Mountain. It was a very steep up followed by a very steep down. Steel rungs were drilled into the rock face in the steepest places. There were fine views of the valley below and the mountains beyond. I could clearly make out Rumford White Cap. Once down in Sawyer Notch it was up and over Hall Mountain. Again it was a very steep up. Great views from the overlook above Hall Mountain Lean-to. I could see back to Saddleback and maybe Sugarloaf. There was also supposed to be the “gun sight”, but I didn’t see it. Later I learned that you need to look down into the valley through a gap in the rocks just before the overlook itself. I met six 60-ish ladies who were out for an extended backpack. They had a lot of determination.After Hall Mountain it was an easy hike over to Wyman Mountain. “Awakening” sat down to talk with me as I was having lunch near the south shoulder of Wyman Mountain. He is NOBO and doing the A.T. in New England. He is making a documentary film of his hike so he was weighted down with lots of gear. He said he was a little discouraged and was at a mental low point.Now it was down off Wyman Mountain. I passed Surplus Pond where there was evidence of recent beaver activity. Next it was the final climb up Surplus Mountain. At 4 PM I passed an Outward Bound group near the cascades. They were headed to Frye Notch Lean-to. I also met Ed from Denver, Colorado. He is 57 and doing a SOBO thru hike.It was a long climb up Surplus Mountain. It seemed to go on forever. I arrived at Frye Notch Lean-to at 6:45 PM. Chris and Becky were already there and had a spot picked out for my tent. This was very thoughtful of them. There is a nice stream for water. Ed is also here and hopes to make it through Mahousuc Notch tomorrow – this is well beyond my capabilities.At 8:50 PM the Outward Bound group pulled in. They must have been beat.Three valleys today below 1,500 ft and three peaks in the range of 2,500 to just under 3,000 ft. Quite the day!","South Arm Road

Frye Notch felt damp and my tent site sloped a little so I kept sliding down to the low side of my tent. As a result I felt tired all day.I was up at 5 AM and on the trail at 6:40 AM.First it was a nice 1,500 ft climb up to East Baldpate. There were views back to Abraham, Sugarloaf, Old Blue, and Rumford White Cap. The crew was on top with I got there (Chris, Becky, Turtlebox, and Smokie). We all took pictures of each other. Old Speck dominated the view across Grafton Notch.   We could see all the way to the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Mount Washington was clearly visible. I left the top at about 9 AM.It was a moderate climb down to Grafton Notch. I arrived at the notch at 11:30 AM. I joined Chris and Becky for lunch at a picnic table. There was even a trash can in the notch, so I was able to unload all my trash. It doesn’t take much to get a backpacker excited!Next was the 2,500 ft climb up Old Speck. The lower part of the trail followed a pretty waterfall. Overall it was a long climb up. I arrived at Old Speck at 3:40 PM via a short side trail from the A.T. There was a 360-degree view from the fire tower. A solo backpacker from PA was there. He had just about completed a circuit of the Grafton Loop Trail. He did the loop in 3.5 days. He was very tired and discouraged – sore feet and challenging terrain.When I got back to the junction with the A.T. I encountered a group of four going to the summit. One guy was definitely high on dope.I was at the junction with the A.T. at 4 PM and at Speck Pond at 5 PM. It was too late and I was too tired to continue to the next campsite just before Mahoosuc Notch. Chris and Becky had gone ahead to that campsite.I’m at Speck Pond with Smokie, Turtlebox, a girls camp group from Vermont, an Outward Bound Group, and a NOBO thru.

There were great views with the early morning light on Old Speck. Next it was a 1,500 ft drop down to Mahoosuc Notch. It was the usual steeply slanted ledges with some tricky vertical drops thrown in for good measure.Then the convoluted journey through Mahoosuc Notch began. I was climbing over boulders – some as big as a truck. In a few places I had to crawl under boulders. At one spot I misjudged my footing and my leg dropped further than intended into a hole between the rocks. I had to use my arm strength to wrestle me and my pack back out. At another spot I had to take my pack off and crawl through a hole while pulling my pack in after me. Overall it was great fun. It took me about 1:20 to get through.Next it was a 900 ft climb up Fulling Mill Mt. I had lunch at Full Goose Lean-to at 11 AM and topped off my water. I was back on the trail at 11:45 AM. Now it was on to the three peaks of Goose Eye Mountain – North Peak, East Peak, and West Peak (the main summit). This was such a clear day – stupendous 360 degree views from all peaks. Along the way I misjudged a step while walking across a bog bridge. One end of a board was missing or had sunk down into the bog. My plan (as you will see, a poorly considered one) was to push off from the end of one board, leading with my right leg and using my right pole pushing from the surface of the bog to give me enough reach to get to the beginning of the next board. Well … the bog provided the same support to the bottom of my right pole as water, so I didn’t get the extra push and my right foot did not make it to the next board. Instead, my right leg went into the bog up to the bottom of my shorts. My left leg was still on a solid board, so I was able to extract myself. However, my right leg was now fully covered with disgusting decaying peat crud. The story continues … now I’m on the West Peak of Goose Eye along with ten girls from a summer camp in New Hampshire. I’m just sitting there enjoying the stunning mountain views and one of the girls says, “Something really smells.” Argh! It was me.Now it was on to Mount Carlo and more stupendous views. After dropping down into Carlo Col there were more truck size boulders to navigate – kind of a mini-Mahoosuc Notch. One half-mile later I was at the Maine – New Hampshire boarder. I’ve now completed all of the A.T. in Maine!One final mountain for the day – Mount Success. This one in New Hampshire. I arrived at Gentain Pond at 8 PM. This was a long but satisfying day. The trails were challenging almost the whole day, but Mahoosuc Notch was a blast and there were great views from the peaks.I’m here with Chris, Becky, and Smokie. I filtered my water from the lake – a bad idea. This clogged up my filter. Good thing this is the last night out.","Speck Pond Shelter

My pack was very light – pleasure to carry.As soon as I left camp, I encountered a section of trail that had been flooded by beaver activity. The way across was to carefully traverse the top of one of the beaver dams. Soon I was back on solid ground for the trek up Wocket Ledge. I stopped at the top to take in the great views of Mount Washington in the early morning light. Next it was on to Trident Col Campsite and then Cascade Mountain. I stopped again at some ledges before the summit so I could take in more views of the White Mountains. This was my last day on the trail, so I need to take in the views at every opportunity. Now it was one final climb to Mount Hayes. All that was left was the 3 mile downhill trail to Route 2 outside of Gorham. I arrived at 2:15 PM.I hitched into Gorham and got a ride from a local in only 5 min. The first stop was Burger King for lunch and then on to “A Top Notch Inn” – my home for the night. After showering, I made a trek out to Walmart for new pants and a clean T-shirt. The inn’s bookkeeper gave me a ride out so I only needed to walk back (about 35 min. walk – piece of cake!).I had dinner with Chris and Becky at the Dynasty A.Y.C.E. Chinese Buffet. I have truly enjoyed spending most of my nights at the same campsite with them as well as crossing paths with them several times each day on the trail. I wish them well on their SOBO thru hike.Some reflections now that my hike for this year is over -----Of the five years in a row that I’ve done a long backpacking trip, this has been the best. It is a combination of things. One was the stunning views from so many peaks. Another was the great weather – I wore my rain jacket for only four hours on the whole trip. Another was the challenging trail and the fact that my knees and the rest of my body held up well to the stress. Crossing paths with Chris and Becky every day was certainly a highlight. I very much enjoyed their company, conversation, and the many meal-times that we shared.As far as animal sightings go, the largest mammal that I saw (other than people) was a rabbit. The amazing thing was how many toads I saw. They ranged in size from as small as a finger nail to a hand-full. On some days I saw more than a dozen of them and every day I saw at least 3 or 4. I’ve hiked in Maine for the last 26 years and have never seen so many. Maybe this was due to the mild winter, the early spring, or the wet spring. I also saw lots of small snakes.When I got home I found that I weight the same as when I started. Thus, the amount of food I was eating was about right. I think having Bridgford Shelf Stable Flat Bread with P.B. and J. for lunch each day helped. The bread alone has 330 calories.Next year I hope to do another segment of the A.T., this time from Gorham, NH to near Killington in Vermont. This would be about 190 miles. When completed and when combined with my hike of the Long Trail in Vermont, I would have done all the A.T. in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. I’m already looking forward to next year’s backpacking trip!","Gentain Pond & Campsite

Rain during the night through about mid-morning; overcast; every once in a while the sun tried to break through but only momentary sunshine. Slept well last night at the White Mountain Lodge and Hostel. I got up at 5 am. One of the owners, Jerry, got up at about the same time and started breakfast. She served oatmeal, burritos, hash browns, and a warm blueberry muffin - yum.   I was on the trail at 6:15 am. I remarked to Jerry that I was leaving a perfectly dry house to go out in the rain - not too bright. At the Rattle River Shelter before 7 am. There was one couple still sleeping inside. Soon after was the first crossing of the Rattle River.   The water was very high more like a raging torrent. I put on my Crocks and waded across.   When I hiked this section of trail some 37 years ago in August, this was an easy hop across. 200 yards after the first crossing was a second one, this time a tributary.   Again, changed into Crocks and waded across. If I'd only known I wouldn't have put my shoes back on.   I loose 15 to 20 minutes with each change. I made steady progress all day but no views because of clouds. Went over the summits of Moriah, North Carter, Middle Carter (just a bump in the trail), South Carter, Height, and Carter Dome. Saw three NOBOS, husband and wife on an overnight, one guy with day pack, summer camp group out for 5 days, and two guys out for several days.   The latter had taken three days to do what I was doing in a day. They were amazed at how fast I was covering the trail. One had thruhiked 26 years ago.The trail was very wet. Some of the bog bridges were more like plontoon bridges, floating on the water's surface. The only problem was, once I added my weight, they sank to the bottom. I had somewhat dry shoes for the first three hours. After that, each was carrying a couple of pounds of water.    When I think back to when I backpacked this stretch with my friends Mike and Jack some 37 years ago, now there were at least more bog bridges. I had lunch on North Carter at about 1 pm. I was on Carter Dome at about 4 pm. The last part of the descent down into the notch was very steep made all the harder by being at the end of a long day.   I arrived at hut at 5:20. Just over 11 hours for 15 miles - 1.4 mph including breaks.   Not bad for an old guy in difficult terrain. I'm the only paying guest at the hut tonight. Also here are thru hikers Stretch and Brave Heart, both from Lancaster, PA. They are doing work for stay. The former just graduated with degree in technology education. For his student teaching he had students build rubber band powered cars. The latter just graduated with degree in bible studies.    The couple who was at Rattle River Shelter came in after dinner. The Croo are Ben and Justin.   Liz from Lonesome Lake Hut is visiting.   Dinner was tortilla soup and lasagna. Tomorrow is just 5.9 miles down into Pinkham Notch.

Good views from viewing platform on top of Wildcat D. The tops of the Presidentials were in the clouds. Stretch and Brave Heart caught up to me there. The drop down from Wildcat E was hard work. Seemingly endless tricky rock drop-offs and boulders. I took my time - about 2 hours. I carefully picked every step. Several spots where I had to slide down on my butt - I'm not proud.   The downpour hit about 3/4 of way down - that made things extra tricky. Once at the bottom there was a mile walk to the Joe Dodge Lodge. I arrived at the lodge at 2:15 pm.   Thus, about 1 mph which is an indication how hard the trail was.Today one nobo thru-hiker passed me as well as four sobos who were doing this section hiking north so they could climb rather than descend the trail up from Pinkham notch.

I had visions of them fording the swollen Rattle River in the pitch dark. A retired schoolteacher also passed me going north. He is section hiking the AT and after reaching Route 2 he only has from Monson to Katahdin left. He was in perfectly clean clothes without mud. I am amazed by people who can hike down a mud infested trail and stay clean - I can't. My room wasn't ready so had lunch at visitors center and checked in at 3:30.

At breakfast I sat with an AMC volunteer. She works the information desk for three day stretches. On the trail at 7:30. I put my pack on a spring scale. It checked in at 30 pounds. This is with 2.5 l of water and six days of lunches and snacks. The lower part of the trail was easy. I did the first two miles in an hour.   I stopped at Lowe's Bald for a look around. Could see the shoulder of Washington and the northern Presidentials. Impressive suspension bridge over the West Branch of the Peabody River. The bridge surface was on top of the cables not suspended from the cables like a normal suspension bridge. The real work was the climb up to Mount Madison. It was 3000 ft in about 2 miles. It took me about three hours. The trail was rocky, but mostly every step was a full stride. From the top I could see the whole length of the Carter-Moriah Range. Looking at it from across the valley, it sure looks like a lot of distance that I covered in my first day. The summit of Mount Washington was visible at times, but mostly there were clouds blowing over the top. There were lots of blackflies so I didn't stay long. It was a short descent to Madison Springs Hut.   I arrived a little before 3 pm, so it was 7.5 hours on the trail. I only took two sit-down breaks, once at Peabody River and once at treeline.It was too early to just sit around the hut, so I took the two mile loop from the hut to Mount Adams.   I went up the Star Lake Trail. I didn't have a pack, so even though it was steep, it was easy going. The top was just about at cloud level and there were a few big drops of rain. There were thousands of blackflies on top and I did not bring DEET. When this was combined with the threat of rain, I took just a couple of pictures and moved on.   I came down on the trail that intersects with the AT. Today I saw maybe 10 nobo thru-hikers. Good dinner of pasta and beef.   As I look out the window, there is another rain shower.   Glad I'm in a hut. Tomorrow will be nearly 12 miles to Mizpah Spring Hut.

Other hikers appeared as red and blue clad apparitions coming out of the mist. The official AT passes to the side of both Jefferson and Clay, so I passed these by. I was on the summit of Washington at 12:30. The summit was a madhouse with hundreds of tourists jostling for position so they could get their picture at the summit sign. I got a quick picture of just the sign.   The summit was socked in, so no views. I had my lunch and left the summit a little after 1 pm. I was surprised to see that the cog railway had switched to diesel-electric engines. Last I remember they were coal fired steam engines. On Crawford Path to Lake of the Clouds Hut I was thinking about hiking this stretch with my dad, Uncle John, and cousin Bette when I was maybe 12. It was a wonderfully clear day. This was the third mountain I had climbed. I'm sure glad that my dad got me hooked on hiking. Some 45 years later I'm still hiking.One of the people I passed while hiking to the top with a prosthetic leg. Quite a determined young lady. After traveling south of the summit the weather changed to mostly sunny. Great views but Washington still in the clouds. After Lakes the trail was easy and dry - could this still be New Hampshire? The AT follows Crawford Path. It does not go over Monroe or Eisenhower, so I didn't either.

About 1/2 mile from the hut I was overtaken by three young guys. They were rushing to Highlands Center to catch the AMC shuttle. The only problem was that they missed a turn. I got them pointed the right way.No views from Jackson as the peak was in the clouds. Two ladies out for a day hike were there when I arrived. I chatted for a few minutes and moved on. Things had cleared up considerably by the time I got to Webster Peak and Webster Cliffs. Great views across the valley and down into Crawford Notch. The wind was very strong and gusty blowing up over the edge of the notch. At least it was trying to blow me into the mountain rather than over the edge.   The trail going down was steep with several tricky ledges, but not as bad as coming down into Pinkham Notch. I was at US 302 at noon. I had lunch by the rail crossing and saw the Conway Scenic Train go by with all the tourists.   It was an easy trail back up out of the notch with about 1,500 ft of elevation gain. Once out of the notch it was 6 miles of flat, mostly well maintained trail to Zealand. Several sections of the trail were on a old railroad grade dating back to the late 1800's when the area was clear cut. I could see Zealand Falls Hut from 1.5 miles away perched up on the side of the mountain. The falls are a series of cascades totaling several hundred feet in height. The view from the hut is spectacular. I arrived at 4:45 pm, thus 7 hours and 15 minutes of hiking.

In addition to the miles, there was at least 5,000 ft of elevation gain.   The views were good, but lots of haze. Vast expanses of New Hampshire woods.   The only evidence of civilization was Galehead and Greenleaf Huts. I had a quick lunch at Galehead. Mount Garfield has a striking pointed peak when seen from the north. South of Garfield I passed the pond that my friend Jack and I camped at some 37 years ago. I saw at least a dozen nobo thru hikers, the most I've seen in a day. There were also many backpackers out for a day or so. Some were struggling with the trail. I arrived at Greenleaf Hut at 7:05. Even though I was well after the dinner time of 6 pm, the croo kindly still served me dinner of turkey soup, stuffed shells, corn, and cranberry cake.   Hit the spot after a long day on the trail.

The first order of business was the climb back up to Mount Lafayette. This took about an hour. The weather for the climb and the first half of the traverse of Franconia Ridge was in the rain. There were a few views down into the valley which were partially shrouded in mist. I traded places several times with a father and son who also stayed at Greenleaf last night.   Today I went over Lafayette, Lincoln, and Little Haystack. The trail down to Franconia Notch was steep and rocky, but no exposed ledges. About halfway down the trees shifted from spruce to mixed hardwood and spruce. I knew I was making progress when I saw the first beech tree. As I made my way down, I had visions of having lunch at a picnic table in a parking lot where the trail crosses I-93, but this was not to be. The AT intersected a bike path, crossed the Pemigewasset River, then crossed under both lanes of I-93, and back into the woods. Thus, I had my PB&J on ""shelf stable bread"" while sitting on a rock under a big tree. It started to rain again just as I finished lunch and it continued to rain hard for the rest of the hike up to Lonesome Lake Hut. At least the trail had an easy grade. The bridge over Cascade Brook had washed out, but a hop across was just possible. Although I was wearing a rain jacket and rain skirt (fashioned from a drawstring type kitchen trashbag), I was soaked by the time I got to the hut. There are only a few people here. I have a room to myself. There is one couple in the dorm building that I'm in. The other dorm building has a group of very noisy girls from a camp in NH and a couple and their grown daughter. I stayed in this hut some 37 years ago with my friend Jack when we were out on a three day trip. When I left the door to my room open for a few minutes while I went to the restroom, I returned to find a chipmunk in my room. I had to chase him out. I took a swim in the lake. I'm cleaner than I've been in the last five days. About 10 nobo thru-hikers passed me today. The oldest I'd guess was over 70. There were two summer camp groups, one father + two son team out for a couple of days, one section hiker going from Maine Junction near Killington, VT to Kahtahdin, and the father + son noted previously.Overall, this was an easy day.   Tomorrow it is 13.4 miles to NH Rt 112, then into town. It would be nice if I can make it in before the post office closes, however I'd need to average 1.7 mph, faster than I've done so far this trip.

Next it was down and back up again for South Kingsman, again in the clouds so no view. Near the top I chatted with a nobo section hiker from San Antonio. He has made it from Georgia to here two weeks at a time. The descent off of South Kingsman was very steep and rocky. Eliza Brook was wonderful with lots of waterfalls. I was at Eliza Brook Shelter at 11:30 am, a pace of 1.5 mph. This was a good pace for me on a tough trail, but not fast enough to make it to post office before it closed.

I saw about 10 nobo thru-hikers, 3 section hikers, and a few people out for a couple of days. No day hikers. Reached NH Route 112 at 4:40 pm.

The blueberry pancakes were outstanding. I had some time before the post office opened so posted my entries on trail journals and did email. I was at the post office when they opened at 9:30.

So my plan was to get new shoes at Lahout's in the neighboring town of Lincoln then get back on the trail by 11 am. As I'm walking over with my pack on my back, it started to rain yet again.   Given that this was morning and the forecast was for more rain in the afternoon, combined with the thought of another tough climb of a high mountain with no view, I did the wise thing and checked into the Comfort Inn in Lincoln. After checking in I walked up to Lahout's for new shoes. My old ones were Merrill's. They lasted only about 350 miles. Their design flaw was that there was too much fabric covering on the sides and not enough leather. The fabric was easily torn on rocks and such. Lahout's carried Merrill's and I see they now have more leather covering the sides. With some hesitation, I bought another pair of Merrill's, with minimal exposed fabric. We'll see if these do any better.As I write this at about 6 pm, it has been pouring rain for the last two hours.

The brook was an endless series of cascades and waterfalls that went on for more than a mile and at least 1,500 feet of elevation change. These are the most outstanding falls I've ever seen. At one point the trail came up over a ledge, and I was at eyeball level with the cascade no more than two feet away. If you want an idea how steep the trail was, picture trying to climb up a waterfall. However, the Dartmouth Outing Club, which maintains this section of trail, has done a wonderful job putting in steps and handholds. It took me 1.5 hours to cover the 1.5 miles and 2,000 ft of elevation change to get to Beaver Brook Shelter. About 30 minutes before I got to the shelter it started to rain hard. I decided to wait out the storm at the shelter. In total, the downpour lasted for 1.5 hours. I estimate more than 1 inch of rain. There were a few rumbles of thunder in the distance. As the storm began to clear, I could see the clouds rising off of Kingsman Ridge - an impressive sight.I left the shelter at 10:30 and reached the 4,802 ft north summit of Moosilauke at about noon. The summit was in the clouds so no view. I had lunch in hopes that the clouds would lift during the delay. Unfortunately, there was no change. There was a 20 mph, cool wind on the exposed summit. On the way down, I took a short side trail to the south summit. There were a few glimpses of the surrounding valleys and mountains when the clouds momentarily parted.   The rest of the trip down was uneventful.   The trail started as rocky and steep. Both the grade and rocks decreased as I went down.   The bottom ended in pastures and local roads. I was at Jeffers Brook Shelter at 3:30. There were three young section hikers doing all of NH and one sobo thru at the shelter (RJ). It was too early for me to stop, so I continued on. Oliverian Brook was a ford.

The father thru-hiked the AT several years back and now the son is following in his footsteps. The son has already told his daughter that she needs to thru-hike also and that she must bear at least one child who will thru-hike.I was at Thundering Falls before I knew it. These are another impressive series of falls. This has been a great trip for waterfalls.   After this it was one more climb up the shoulder of Deer Leap Mountain and another mile or so to Maine Junction.

I celebrated with a peanut butter granola bar. While I was there a section hiker came through and snapped my picture. I then had to back track to the Sherburne Pass trail for the descent down to the pass and the Inn at Long Trail. I enjoyed a salad, ruben sandwich and Long Trail Ale for lunch.

The weather in the Whites was a little disappointing, but it could have been worst, maybe half the days I had views. I had great weather from a mile or two past Moosilauke through to the end of my hike – not a drop of rain. It was hot most of the days, but it was bearable.   More blackflies and mosquitoes than I’ve had on any of my backpacking trips in New England. Maybe this was due to the wet weather.There were no other sobos traveling the same schedule as I was, so no traveling companions like I had last year. The AMC Huts were nice and it sure was a treat not to have to carry a tent and food. The amount of food that I ate at the huts was “huge” compared to what I was eating when on my own. The other guests at the huts were not part of the long-distance hiker crowd so no lasting friendships there.My knees did great this year. Also, my feet were in better shape than they’ve ever been on a hike. At the end I had no tape or bandaids covering up sore spots.Next year I am looking at two options for a long distance hike.

This required 3,000 lb of wood, so this should give some sense of the scope. Tomorrow I drive to North Adams, MA to start the hike.,","Home

Today I needed to complete the section of the trail between the junction of the Pine Cobble Trail and the AT to MA Rt 2. Five years ago when I hiked the southern 2/3 of the Long Trail I came up the Pine Cobble Trail, so I missed this 2.8 mile section of the AT. I did this with a day pack.   I was hiking at 3:50. The trail was mostly an easy walk through mixed hardwood forest. The lower part of the trail followed a small rushing stream.   There was one steep rocky section not long before the junction.   There were some very limited views of North Adams from the top of the rocky stretch. In a few areas there were shrubs with white blossoms. I took a picture of one cluster with the late afternoon sun shining on it.   I was back at the car at 6:30.   I did the 5.6 mile round trip in 2:40 or about 2 mph, just about my top speed.

Today was a nobo slack~pack over Mt. Greylock. I left the inn at 5:20 and and did a 15 min. road walk to the trailhead. The initial portion of the trail went through open fields. There would have been some good views of the sunrise, but the thick haze obscured nearly everything. The trail then climbed steadily through a mixed hardwood forest. There were a couple of overlooks partway up but by this time the haze could more properly be called a cloud. This means that the humidity was 100%   Combined with the heat, my shirt and shorts were soaked with sweat. I reached summit at about 9:05. I didn't see a single hiker on the way up.   The tower on the summit was closed for repairs. Very limited views because of the haze. Even the tower was indistinct because of the flat light.   I hung around the summit for about 45 min. The hike down was easy. There were two more overlooks however these were in the direct sun and the heat was oppresive.   Two single hikers and one father/daughter pair passed me on their way up. For a while I hiked and talked with a nobo thru-hiker.   He wants to get to Kahtadin by August 7.   I said that this sounded a little fast to me.I was at Rt 2 at 12:45 then 15 min. up the street to Friendly Ice Cream for lunch.   In total this was 15.8 miles in 7:40.

I was in Dalton in time for an early lunch which I purchased at the Cumberland Farms shown in awol's guide. I sat on a bench at the center of town. There was a slight breeze and was very pleasant. After a 45 minute break, it was back on the trail for more easy hiking. The only place with a view was Warner Hill, which had views to the NW, N, and NE. I could just make out Greylock through the haze.   The top of Warner Hill had many high bush blueberries but alas, they were not yet ripe. The hill itself sat in a large field of ferns.

Up at 4:30 and on the trail at 6:10. The highlight of today was crossing the bridge over the Massachusetts Turnpike. This has special significance for me because when I was a kid and the family was driving to visit friends in western Mass, my dad pointed out that bridge and told me about the AT.   This was the first I'd heard of it and this planted the seed to hike the AT. It took a while for the seed to germinate, but my dad planted that seed. At that point we were already doing day hikes together and later he took me on my first backpacking trip. I paused for a moment before stepping on the bridge. Crossing the bridge reminded me of all that my dad taught me and of how much I miss him. It was an emotional experience. It was a wet slog today. Some on the bog bridges were under water. The good news was that the rain kept the mosquitoes at bay. Reached Mt Wilcox North Shelter at 7 pm. About 14 nobos passed me today.

I had one and a half sandwiches plus several slices of watermelon. Breakfast was done just after 7 AM. Since the post office would not open for another hour, I just lounged around. Hudson took me to Salisbury Post Office at 8:30. I got my resupply package, and purchased a few minor supplies at the pharmacy and grocery store. I sorted my supplies on a bench on the main drag. This was a very fast process. I was ready to road walk to trailhead at 9 am. The highlight of the day was the Great Falls of the Housatonic River. With all the rain, the water was rushing over the falls. Mostly I was walking in CT hardwood forest. Many ups and downs so I got a good workout. By mid-day it was very hot in areas with no breeze. There were a few views from some of the ridges, with the best being from the high corner of a freshly cut hayfield. Nearby were some raspberries – yum! Time wise it would have been best to stay at Pine Swamp Shelter, but I'd heard so many horror stories of the poor water quality (the source was the swamp), and the mosquitoes that I pressed on for another 3 miles to Caesar Brook Campsite. The bottom line is don't stay anywhere with ""swamp"" in the name. Along the way to Caesar Brook, I scared up two white tailed deer. As I was getting near the campsite, it appeared that a major thunderstorm was eminent. I was on a ridge, so I booked it down the trail as fast as I could. I arrived at the campsite a 8 pm. I rushed to set up my tent and cook dinner. In the end, the storm was a near miss and I got just a few drops of rain. I’m in my tent tonight. I’m the only one here.There is a major foundation hole near the campsite indicating that this was once the center of operations for a farm. Although I haven’t been highlighting this in my journal, the forests nearly everywhere are laced with rock walls, a lasting reminder of the area’s farming history.Meet 10 or so thru hikers and many more backpackers just out for a few days. Some of the latter group was way out of shape. One of the thru hikers worked for PC Construction, a Vermont-based firm that does lots of work in Maine. “Very Mary” who stayed at Bearded Woods last night passed me nobo near the falls. She was doing a slack pack for the day, supported by Hudson. A few minutes later, on a short road section, Hudson passed me on his way to pick up Very Mary. By the way, Very Mary is an environmental engineer.With five days of food, my pack felt heavy. However, it will get lighter, with each passing day.Blisters on the bottom of my feet are giving me some problems. These started because of all the rain on July 4 resulting in hiking in soaking wet shoes and feet all day.

A thunderstorm came through during the night but it woke me only enough to close the tent fly. I got up at 5:40 but was slow getting out of camp. I needed to do some maintenance on the blisters on the bottom of my feet, especially the right one. I also needed to filter water. I was on the trail at 7:50. The early part of the day was an easy descent followed by a long walk along the Housatonic. The river is still flowing very fast. After this, there was lots of climbing. At two locations the trail dropped back down to the elevation of the Housatonic River. Each time I needed to climb back up to the elevation of the ridges. The first climb, up to St Johns Ledges, was very steep and rocky - the most challenging so far. This was about 750 ft of elevation gain. Then the trail dropped back down to Schaghiticoke Mt Road at the elevation of the Housatonic. This was followed by a 1,000 ft climb up Mt Algo and an unnamed higher peak. Along the way I passed a “gathering” of small snakes. There must have been 10 or so of them. Some were contentedly coiled, while others were slithering about. Maybe the gathering was for the purpose of mating?Today was my slowest pace so far. In part it was because of the heat, but my sore feet and the two climbs were contributing factors.I talked with several nobos including “Politician” who is from Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Then there was “Acorn” who was traveling without a map or guidebook. “Grinder” is an elementary school teacher who is out for a long section hike. Late in the day I talked to two nobos who were determined to get to Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter. This would require descending St. Johns Ledges in the dark. I suggested that this was a bad idea, however, they said they got a late start and were determined to get in their mileage for the day. They clearly had some combination of too much bravado, too little sense, and/or too much testosterone. A wilderness adventure group from East Hartford is at the campsite with me. There is an excellent water source. This gave me an opportunity to soak my feet and wash up a little.The forecast is for severe thunderstorms during the night. We will see.","Caesar Brook Campsite

It just barely woke me up. I was up at 5 am and on the trail at 7 am. When I was leaving, the West Hartford Wilderness group was just beginning to stir.Today started with some nice views down into the Housatonic River Valley. The trail then dropped down into the valley for the last time. On the way down I saw the greatest number of salamanders so far. In some places I saw one every ten paces.Next was a climb of Ten Mile Hill. On the way up I met “Shortstop”, a retired gentleman doing his second thru hike. Last year he fell and broke his shoulder just north of Whitecap in the 100-mile wilderness in Maine. He pushed the rescue button on this Spot emergency locator and it worked!There was no view from the top, but the woods were nice. There were orange salamanders everywhere. In the distance I could hear a periodic banging. It sounded like thunder, but it was morning and there were no threatening clouds. Nonetheless, I was nervously looking toward the sky for an approaching storm. However, at little further on I could tell that this was a quarry operation and the banging were boulders being dumped into truck dump bodies. I stopped for a late lunch at Wiley Shelter. An older man came in and proceeded gather firewood and started a fire to cook “dinner”. Garlic appeared to be an important seasoning, but I didn't wait around long enough to see what the main ingredient was. He had an old, beat-up, old-style pack on a frame and ratty foam mattress. He struck me as a homeless man, even though I gathered that he had a family, since family issues caused him to leave the trail in Vermont last year. It was an easy five miles to NY 22. I stopped at the garden center for a couple of lemonades. They have a lounge area for hikers. I relaxed there for a while. From the center it was just three miles to my destination for the night. The unreliable water source was running. I'm tenting behind the shelter. There are two nobos and one sobo (Gravity) in the shelter. Gravity did from Katahdin to North Adams, MA in 2005. This year he is picking up where he left off and hopes to make it as far as Virginia. He started in North Adams several days before I did. He is having foot problems, just like I am, and the remains of Hurricane Arthur was the cause.The nobo woman described an encounter with a bear in NJ. A day hiker was out with his dog. The dog started to chase the bear- picture the bear being chased down the trail by the dog. The bear decided that this was stupid as she was a lot bigger than the dog, so the bear did a 180 degree turn, and started to chase the dog. Now the owner is frantically calling his dog, so the dog starts running toward the man with the bear close behind. The woman nobo was able to create enough of a stir to break this potentially tragic sequence of events. After this was over, the nobo woman saw the bear’s two cubs.The nobo woman also related part of the trail lore, of a hiker who camped at the garden center. The hiker said that he had had a fine night, except for the 10 minute shower at 5 AM. He did not realize that this was the sprinkler system that came on to water the plants.

No rain during the night.I decided that I needed to get off the trail at Bear Mountain Bridge, rather than continuing another 110 miles to Delaware Watergap. The blisters on the bottom of my left foot have healed nicely, but the bottom of the right foot is in tough shape. The blister is very deep and is beneath the 1/16-in. thick callous just behind the second toe. The thick callous has come off. The underlying skin is red and painful. Eventhough I’m protecting it with padding and tape at the beginning of each day, it will not get better if I keep walking on it. Thus, I’ll make arrangements to get off the trail from Fort Montgomery, NY.I was up at 4:30 AM and on the trail at 6:15 AM. As I was eating breakfast, the sun was rising. It was very peaceful. It was also great to be out on the trail in the early morning with comfortable temperatures. This is my favorite time of day. Not long after getting on the trail there was a viewpoint looking east back into the valley.The trail was easy. It went by Nuclear Lake which was beautiful in the morning light. Not long after crossing Rt. 55 in West Pauling, NY I began to hear booming off in the distance. I encountered a nobo hiker who has heard the same booming since crossing the Bear Mountain Bridge. What could this be? Could this be live fire exercises at West Point? Great blackberries just south of Morgan Stewart Shelter. There was an abandoned tent at the shelter???? Later I passed two hikers who said they were sobos but were hiking back north to retrieve their tent. The logic lead to this hiking plan escapes me.I crossed I-84. The trail paralleled this interstate and then the Taconic State Parkway for many miles, so traffic noise was annoyingly in the background. I stopped for lunch at the Mountaintop Deli 0.3 miles from where the trail crosses Rt. 52 near Storm Mountain. I had a turkey sub. It was outstanding. I highly recommend the short detour to this deli. On the way I passed a batch plant where Quikrete and related products are blended. In total the lunch break and detour took an hour, but it was well worth it. Gravity was also at the deli. He is also getting off the trail for a few days because of his feet.Several miles of the afternoon walk was on a steep sidehill that required a lot of rock scrambling. By late afternoon I cross the Taconic State Parkway and shortly thereafter, passed the RPH Shelter. Gravity was going to stay here for the night and the shelter looked excellent, however, I decided to press on. In total it was a 1,000 ft climb from the shelter to the top of Shenandoah Mountain where I was treated to some fine views. After this it was relatively easy hiking to Clarence Fahenstock State Park. At 7:30 PM, I arrived at the turnoff for the green blazed trail that would take me to the park. The early part of this sidetrail was not all that well marked, but soon joined a section that is being completely rebuilt. When done, this will be a superhighway (or at least a super-trail) into the park. The trail took me to the beach. This end of the lake had a lot of aquatic plant growth - kind of yucky. No selfrespecting Mainer would swim in such a lake, but I guess that New Yorkers have to take what they can get.If I had been one minute earlier I could have flagged down a maintenance truck for directions to the campsite, but the truck speed off just before I emerged from the woods. I wandered around a little and I couldn’t even figure out how to get off the deserted beach. So I hoped for a cell signal – yes, a strong cell signal! I called the park office. The ranger gave me directions off the beach. This brought me to a four-corner intersection. It appeared to be straight ahead for the campground, but to be sure I called the office again. Straight ahead was the right track and this brought me to the free AT campsites. Two were open. All three abutted the Taconic State Parkway, so there was no getting away from traffic noises. In total, the campsite must have been 0.5 mile or more from the trail. At this point I was truly beat. The bottom of both my feet hurt from being pounded on for nearly 23 miles. The payoff was a hot shower. This sure felt great.After a quick dinner, I went to sleep in my tent. Oh yes, one more step – I put in earplugs to deaden the traffic noise.

Even with earplugs, the traffic noise woke me up several times.This is the last day on the trail for this year. I was up at 4:05 AM and on the trail at 5:50 AM. This was going to be another high mileage day, so I wanted an early start. I made my way back out of the state park to the junction with the AT. The first mile of the AT followed the slope above Canopus Lake. This was another steep sideslope with lots of rocky travel and small ups and downs. This was kind of like being stuck in purgatory, neither a flat trail at the lake’s edge nor the ridgeline above with the possibilities of views – oh well, you go where the trail goes. The trail passed by the south end of Canopus Lake. This end was much nicer than the end with the beach.After reaching Route 301, the trail became a lot easier. In fact, for a mile or so the trail followed the grade of a very narrow gage railroad – hiking doesn’t get any easier than that! For the rest of the morning the trail had just normal ups and downs. If my right foot hadn’t been so sore, this would have been quite relaxing. I refilled on water at an excellent, cool brook just south of Canopus Hill Road. I then had lunch on top of Canopus Hill. There were a few limited views of the surrounding countryside.   I found a spot in the shade, as it was getting hot. This was not the prime spot, as that was already taken by a guy and gal. The whole half-hour while I was having lunch, the guy was on his phone. He was a lawyer or at least a recent law school graduate. He was reciting all the work he had done on legalizing marijuana in Colorado and other states. He was going 99% of the talking – a typical lawyer. After a while I got the impression that this was a telephone interview for a job. When I left, the guy was still talking away – again, typical of a lawyer. Overall, this was quite annoying.   The afternoon was more easy hiking. I could clearly hear the booming noises again. This must have been live fire exercises at West Point. By mid-afternoon I had reached the road crossing at US Rt. 9. As I emerged from the woods, I saw what I thought must have been a mirage. Could it be real? Yes, it was real – a convenience store no more than 100 ft off the trail. This was just what a parched hiker needed on a hot afternoon. I got an ice cream sandwich and lemonade – ahhhh, so good. I also got on last refill on Gatorade for the trail.This left just two climbs in Hudson Highlands State Park. The first was up White Rock/Canada Hill and the second was up the flanks of Anthonys Nose. As I’ve hiked south, I’ve noticed that the character of the woods has changed. There are no more birches. The high areas mostly have scattered oaks with grass in between. The final stretch was a steep drop to Rt. 9D and Bear Mountain Bridge. The bridge was a very impressive suspension bridge completed in 1924. It was solidly built with a riveted steel truss supporting the road deck. I took several pictures as I walked across including a couple of selfies. The views were stunning. I felt quite a sense of accomplishment to walk across this bridge.My AT journey for 2014 was done once I reach the western side, but I still had a 1.6 mile roadwalk to the Holiday Inn Express. The motel turned out to be just two doors way from the Barnstormer BBQ and Steakhouse. So after a quick shower, it was off to the Barnstormer for a celebratory steak dinner topped off by pecan pie a la mode. I sat at the bar and a young man sat down next to me. It turns out he was a recent graduate from West Point, who was back for a short summer assignment. His name was Shawn and he was from Kentucky. His next stop was Texas for artillery training. He confirmed that there were live fire excercises going on at West Point. He was quite an accomplished young man. I thanked him for serving our country and paid for his dinner.Tomorrow I pick up a Hertz car to get back to my car in Pittsfield, MA. I should be back in Maine tomorrow in time for dinner at home.","Clarence Fahenstock State Park

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466017,"2014 – Wrap UpOn July 12 I had an uneventful trip back to Maine. A taxi picked me up at the Holiday Inn Express and brought me to the Hertz office in Mohegan Lake. Then it was a pleasant drive on the Taconic State Parkway most of the way to Pittsfield, MA. The parkway is quite nice, with no trucks. I passed right over the AT crossing where I had been just two days before. My car was in my trail angel’s driveway and they provided a shuttle to drop off the Hertz car. We then had lunch at Subway. I greatly thank these trail angels. Other than needing to take a half-hour nap in a rest area on the Mass Pike and an ice cream break in Kittery, it was a non-stop drive back to my home Maine.It is now my second full day home. The blister on my right foot is healing a little, but I’m going to my doctor later today to see if anything can be done to help it along.As I think back on this year’s 192 mile trip, overall it was outstanding. I climbed two state high points (Mt. Greylock – MA and Bear Mt. – CT). Except for the remains of Hurricane Arthur on July 4, I didn’t really get rained on while hiking. However, there was rain several nights so I often put away a wet tent. There were several locations with great views, but the best were surely those from the ridge just south of Race Mountain. Overall, the woods were impressive. I clearly saw the change from the dense northern forest of mixed hardwoods to the sparser oaks of the New York highlands. For animals I saw six deer, 100+ salamanders, more squirrels than I could count, two turtles, and many snakes. I also saw a red cardinal.I did five, 20+ mile days. My legs can certainly carry me this far each day, but these make for long days, with one more than 14 hours on the trail. Near the end, my speed was slowed by my sore right foot. On the last two 20 mile days, both my feet just pain hurt from pounding them on rocky trails. Unless there is a good reason, in the future I should try to avoid 20+ mile days on rocky trails.The disappointing part of this trip was the blisters on my feet. At the end of last year’s trip, with the same shoes, my feet were in perfect shape. Hiking with soaking wet feet on July 4 and 5 was a prime cause. Also the shoe inserts would not stay put. They kept sliding toward the back. Before next year I need to experiment with different shoe inserts. The blisters were the prime reason to cut this trip short at Bear Mountain Bridge rather than continuing to Delaware Watergap, however, I’d had my fill for this year of hiking in such hot temperatures.The true highlight of the trip was hiking across the bridge that carries the AT over the Massachusetts Turnpike. This bridge brought back so many memories of my dad.Including my end-to-end of the Long Trail, I've now completed 786 miles from Mt. Kahtahdin to Bear Mountain Bridge.Next year I may continue on the AT or I may complete the second half of the Colorado Trail. I’m somewhat favoring the latter for a change of scenery, but the final decision will depend on available time and logistics.That’s all for this year.","Home

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542847,"Yesterday was a travel day to get home. Now some reflections on this year's trip ...It was very hot and humid on most days. It was even hot at night making sleeping difficult. This added to the challenge of the trail. For this reason, the first two days were low mileage and I took a break for a night in an air conditioned hotel in Harriman, NY. On the plus side, I only got rained on once while actually on the trail - not bad when compared to the prior two years. I did five days that were 20 milers. That is about my limit for the trail conditions encountered.The trail varied from easy walking on woods roads to steep climbs to boulder hopping to walking on a a bed of pointy small rocks sticking up a few inches from the trail surface. The latter was very hard on my feet. I did get blisters on the bottom of both feet, but not as bad as the last two years.Other than Bear Mountain and NJ Highpoint, trail did not go over any real peaks, so there were limited 360 degree views, not counting two fire towers. Every night I was at a forest enclosed campsite so no sunsets or sunrises to see this year. Water was scarce. At times, I was leaving camp with 3.5 liters. Also no opportunities for swimming in a lake, except a few that were posted ""No Swimming"".Deer were abundant. I saw at least one deer on most days. Every day I was able to sample wild blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries that grew by the side of the trail. This was a great treat.I was happy to share a few nights with SOBOs White Buffalo, Brick, Wall, and Red Jack. However, most of the time I was on my own.Overall I would say that this year was mostly about covering more miles to Springer Mountain, with fewer great views and less enjoyable temperatures than in years past.Next year hopefully I can go from Port Clinton, PA to Harpers Ferry, WV - about 194 miles. This would bring me past the 1/2-way point.A few comments on gear ....This year I was hiking in low Solomon trail shoes. One feature that I definitely did not like was the plastic sliders used to tighten the laces. They did not stay tight. As a result the shoes were always a little loose resulting in excessive motion and rubbing on the backs of my heals. For socks, I was using Darn Tough with no liner sock. Next year, I'm going to use liner socks again. These retain foot powder better allowing for less friction between foot and sock. Although these shoes/socks produced fewer blisters than the last two years, I'm still not happy with my shoe/sock system. I've already purchased medium height Solomon trail boots with conventional laces. I think this will produce less heal friction.GlacierGel blister and burn dressings worked miracles on my blisters. I was even able to get one blister to completely reattach. I used Johnson and Johnson sports tape to hold things on. This actually caused other blisters by adhering to the inside of the Darn Tough socks. Going back to using liner socks may solve this problem or maybe I need to find something that has a lower coefficient of friction to hold things on.For a sleeping bag I used a 40 deg. Big Agnes. This has no insulation on the bottom. A Big Agnes air mattress slips into the bottom. I had a new mattress this year (old one developed a slow leak I could not find). The new one was just plastic with no fabric covering. An unexpected plus is that this gripped the tent floor better than the older cloth covered one which prevented the mattress from sliding around on the tent floor. Next year I'll bring the ground cloth for my tent for use in shelters as protection from puncturing the air mattress.","Home

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543026,"This year I wore a Garmin Epix GPS watch. I had the Northeast US topo map loaded on the watch. I was very happy with how it functioned. I started recording my hike when I started out each morning and then stopped recording soon after I reached camp. Thus, the watch provided the total miles walked, elevation gain, and elevation loss. The size of screen was not adequate to determine where I was relative to major land features, however, when combined with a paper map, it was possible to match the shape of contour lines shown on the watch to the paper map, allowing an accurate determination of where I was on the trail. Especially near the end of a day, when I was trying to make it to a shelter, the watch allowed me to keep track of how many miles I had left. This was confirmation that I was going to be able to make it with the available daylight and energy.The total miles walked according to the watch was 222.6 compared to 186 official trail miles. Some of the difference is due to the need to hike to campsites/shelters off the trail, side trips to viewpoints, going off on an incorrect side trail, and the like. However, even on days with few deviations from the trail, the actual miles walked could be 10% more than the official mileage. I'm not sure if the watch's GPS has a systematic error that overestimates the mileage or if the actual distance a hiker needs to walk is greater than the official mileage.The watch would function for 12+ hours with the GPS engaged. Each night I recharged the watch with a 7800mAh battery that weighed about 7 oz. It had enough battery power to recharge the watch every night for a week.","Home

Great night's sleep at the Microtel in Hamburg PA.  My alarm woke me up at 4 am.  I was packed and out of the room a little after 5 am. Then it was on to McDonald's for a Big Breakfast.  It was still getting light as I road walked to Port Clinton.  I wore my head lamp to provide a little visibility to oncoming traffic.  I was at the bridge over the Schuylkill River near downtown Port Clinton at 6:20 am.  Also, felt the first drop of rain.  There would be a lot more of that as the day went on.  
After climbing up from the railyard I turned right onto the Schuylkill Trail.  After walking 100 yards I decided that was wrong so I backtracked. Now turning left I found where the AT climbs steeply up the hill.  I made steady progress but the rain slowly started to build.  After an hour I broke down and put on rain jacket. 
The hiking was mostly flat through hardwood forests.  Every once in a while there was an evergreen.  There were a few viewpoints but no view because of rain.  Since it was raining I made a 0.6 mile round trip to Eagle's Nest shelter so I could have a dry lunch.  The trail surface today was mostly good. Just a few short rocky sections.  
I arrived at Hertline Campsite at 4:50.  Since it was only raining lightly I went to work immediately setting up camp and cooking dinner.  
Well over 30 NOBO thruhikers or very long section hikers passed me.  That is a lot of hikers.   There are three camped near me.  
My total miles today were nearly 24.  This counts road walk to trailhead and side trip to shelter for lunch.  My Garmin Epix GPS watch overestimates mileage but even taking that into account it was a long day.  
Still raining lightly as I complete this entry.","Port Clinton, PA

It started to rain heavily at about 3 am.  Water was splashing into the tent from under the rain fly so my sleeping bag and some of my other gear got wet.  
  It appeared to be letting up a little at 6 am so I got up.  Big mistake.  Once I was out of the tent the heavens opened up.  Thus, I broke camp in a downpour.  Once I got the tent rolled up there was literally water running out of it.  I squeezed out as much as I could, but it was hopeless.  Anytime the top of my pack was open it was scooping in water.  I even had to empty 2 inches of water that had accumulated  in the pockets of my rain jacket.  The stream near the campsite rose considerably overnight. 
I was getting rained on for the early part of the morning but slowly it stopped.  By 10 am I had enough confidence to stop and put on dry socks.
Overall the trail was good with just a few rocky sections.  By noon the sun was out and there were some views of the farmland to the east.  The forests are very impressive with several stands of mature hardwood. Much of the undercover is ferns .... magical.  
I had a late lunch at the William Penn Shelter.  This is 1000 miles from Katahdin so I've crossed a major milestone!  While at the shelter l hung up my tent and sleeping bag to dry a little.  
The afternoon hiking was uneventful until just after I-81 crossing.  The skies darked, the wind started whipping, and the heavens cut loose again.  Fortunately it only lasted 30 minutes.   
I'm camped just south of PA 72.  There is a stream that is flowing fast from all the rain.  I'm the only one camped here.   This is very near the road ... hopefully the traffic noise will be tolerable.","Hertline Campsite

I slept well last night.  The traffic noises did not bother me.  I got up at about 5:30 and was on the trail just after 7 a.m.  
Overall today was easy walking through mature hardwood forest.  The rocks in the trail and the surrounding woods reminded me of New England. In a few places the undercover was rhododendrons in bloom - certainly not like New England.   There were just two climbs, one at the beginning of the day to the top of Second ""Mountain"" and the other at the end of the day up from PA 325. The flat places in between with no views got a little monotonous  at times.  
The rapids on Rausch Creek was the best mountain stream I've seen since New England.  This was the highlight of my day.  The trail next passed through a former coal mining area.  There is a problem with acid mine drainage.  To raise the pH in Rausch Creek, they have constructed a forcing well that forces a flow of water up through a bed of crushed limestone, breaking off small particles which the flow carries into the stream.  This raises the pH from 4 to 6.
It is a small world ...  This morning I met NOBO Black Bear.  Her two sons are UMaine students and she has a camp on Cold Stream Pond.  Her next door neighbors are my friends Pat and Doug!I had lunch at the site of the former coal mining town of Yellow Springs.  Just after PA 325 was major trail magic.  They were going to have lobster and shrimp stew for dinner but it seemed to be attracting the hikers who were partying their way north.  Thus, I stopped for just a quick salad.
I refilled on water just south of PA 325.  I was carrying 3.5 liters of water up the hill so it was a slow climb.  
I'm camped at mile 1026.4.  There is one thru hiker and two long distance section hikers here.  In total I passed some 40 NOBO thru hikers today.","Campsite just south of PA 72

I slept well last night.  There was a light breeze which prevented condensation in the tent.  The only problem is that there is a slow leak in my air mattress.  I had to blow it up twice during the night.  
I got up at 5:30 and could see the sunrise through the trees.   I was on the trail at 7:10.  It takes me an extra 20 min to get out of camp because I'm taking great care to tape my feet to prevent blisters.  
The trail was relatively easy.  There was just one really rocky stretch about 1/4 mile long on the initial descent coming down into Duncannon.  There were several places with views.  Some of the best were looking down to the Susquehanna River.  I was on the bridge over the river at 3:30.  For a SOBO it is unclear how to get on the correct lane of the bridge so I just walked across in the break down lane.  Once I got across the bridge I could see there was a pedestrian walkway on the opposite side of the bridge.  This would be very clear to all NOBOs. 
I walked down High Street to the Doyle arriving a little before 4:30.  I had a beer and talked to a staffer for a Democratic congressman from Rhode Island.  The manager from the Red Carpet Inn came into town and picked me up - great service.  There are several other hikers here.  I'm going to a Burger King just down the highway for dinner.","Campsite at mile 1026.4

I was up at 5 am, repacked my gear, then was at Burger King for breakfast when they opened at 6 am.  I had the jumbo breakfast burrito and hash browns.  Neither were very good but they filled the void.  The manager of the Red Carpet Inn gave myself and two NOBOs a ride back to the trail promptly at 7:30 am.  He dropped me at the post office.  I highly recommend the Red Carpet Inn for AT hikers.  
I got my resupply package at 8 am and was repacked and on the trail at 8:35.  
Today was a day of great variety in trail conditions and surroundings.  The day started with a climb up to Hawk Rock.  There were great views of the countryside to the west of Duncannon.  The next section of trail alternated between OK and rocky.  Taken as a whole, it was not as bad as AWOL's guide made it out to be.  As advertised there were great views from the pipeline clearing which I reached a little before noon.  Here I met Walking Home who is from Gorham ME.   I had lunch at the stream crossing at mile 1049.9.  So far the trail was surrounded by mixed hardwood forest.  Next came recently mowed pastures.  Next was a climb and descent through hardwood forests.  Part way down on the descent there were great views of the Cumberland Valley.  I sat on the rock bench and admired the view.  After that I entered the valley and walked through wooded bottom land, hay fields, and corn fields.  I took many pictures.  
Along the way I got stung just above my left ankle by an enormous wasp or hornet. This one was at least 5 times bigger round than the ones was have in Maine.  
I reached Rt 11 at about 5:30 and did a road walk to the Super 8 Motel.  This is a very busy road so caution is needed.  I had a good dinner at the Middlesex Dinner - great hikers food including pecan pie with vanilla ice cream.","Duncannon PA

I slept well at the Super 8 but the person in the room before me left the alarm on and set to midnight.  I was up at 4 am but was slow getting organized and out of the room.  I was across the street at the Middlesex Diner at 5:45.  I had the egg and pancake platter.  Just what I needed.  I was out and walking toward the trail at 6:30.  
If I was to do it again, I would stay at the Days Inn.  That way I would not need to cross 4 lanes of busy traffic to get to diner.  
The early morning walk was through more PA farmland. Corn and soybeans were the predominant crop.  I was in Boiling Springs at 10 am.  This is a lovely town centered around Childrens Lake.  I bought a few replacement items from the outfitter and had something cold to drink.  There was also a work related call I needed to make.  I was on the trail again at 11 am.  First it was more farmland and then back into the woods.  There were lots of ups and downs. There were two sections of ""rock mazes"".  These were fun.  There is now a lot more pine in the forest.  For the first time this year the trail was a bed of pine needles.  
I arrived at the James Fry Shelter at about 6 pm. Also here is SOBO Nomad, and NOBOs Pappa and one more. There is also a group of 16 year old girls.  I think they are trying to camp out but only have a small blue tarp.   It is raining lightly as I complete this entry.  It is going to be a hot night.","Carlisle PA

The light rain tapered off early in the night.  After that there was just tree rain. I slept well but my air mattress was completely flat in the morning. I got up at 5:20 and was on the trail at 6:55. 
The terrain today seemed moderate but still had over 5000 ft of cumulative elevation gain.  The forest was similar to the prior day with the addition of some areas of scrub oak.  
I was at Pine Grove Furnace State Park at 10:30.  I very much enjoyed the Appalachian Trail Museum.  There were a few pictures of Lester Kenway, President of the Maine Appalachian Trail Club, making and installing the new sign on Mount Kahtahdin.  
At the Pine Grove General Store I had an excellent wrap - grilled chicken, bacon, and ranch dressing.  I did a scaled down version of the half gallon challenge - I had an ice cream sandwich.   While I was there Nomad completed the challenge.  
The afternoon hiking was punctuated by reaching the halfway point of the AT.  Actually there were two: the halfway point from a couple of years ago (this is the one with the fancy sign) and then the actual halfway point.  In both cases a NOBO was there at the same time, so I had them snap my picture.  
I heard a little thunder in late afternoon but no rain for me.   No views today.  
I reached the Birch Run Shelter a little before 5 pm.  I'm not sure how it got its name as there are no birches in sight.  
I talked with the ridge runner,  Ranger.   She thru-hiked last year.  There is a camp group here.  Hopefully they will quiet down by 9 pm. Temperature wise, this is going to be a hot night.","James Fry Shelter

I slept well last night except for the need to reinflate my air mattress several times.  No rain   during the night. My tent was perfectly dry in the morning.  I got up at 5:30 and was on the trail at 7:00. 
Easy walking all day.  I was completely in the green tunnel so no views.  There were a few stands of pine with no hardwood mixed in.  I've not seen that since New England.  The Ridge Runner, Ranger, crossed my path several times today.  
The Quarry Gap Shelter was the nicest I've ever seen.  It is a log shelter with the logs freshly painted brown and the gaps between the logs filled with mortar.  There were two covered picnic tables and a few tent platforms.  There was even a rocking swing.    
I arrived at US 30 before noon and then walked to Timbers for a burger.  I sat with Journeyman  who is a journeyman electrician who hales from Oklahoma.  He is a NOBO through hiker.  
I'm at the Trail of Hope Hostel.   I'm going to be very comfortable here for the night.  Tomorrow is supposed to be stormy.  We will see how it goes.  The forecast for Saturday and Sunday look great.","Birch Run Shelter

After completing yesterday's entry two hikers came in. One was Carol.  She is older and is on her third try at a thru hike.  On one prior try she made it to Bemis Shelter in Maine where she slipped and broke her wrist.  On another try she made it as far as Flagstaff Lake near Rangely ME.  The other was NOBO thru hiker Tex.  
I slept well in the air conditioned comfort of my bunk room at the hostel.  I was up at about 5:15 and out the door about an hour later.  The first rain shower hit while I was doing the 0.9 mile roadwalk back to the trail.  I was hiking on the trail at 6:45.  
Uneventful easy hiking today.  There was one view to the east from Chimney Rock.  From this purch I could see solid PA woods.  This was the first mountain view since before crossing the Cumberland Valley.   I made it to Old Forge Picnic Area by 12:10.  I ate lunch and took a short nap.  I was on the trail at 1 pm.
I reached Falls Creek Campsite at 4:15 pm.  Every once in a while I could hear a rumble of thunder in the distance but the sun was out and I was not concerned.   I no sooner got my tent unrolled when a heavy shower came through.  On this trip I've now both taken down  and put up my tent in a downpour.  Given a choice I'd much prefer the latter.  
Also here are NOBO thrus Auntie and Raggety as well as SOBO section hiker Ground Hog.  He is about my age. 
I'm just 0.6 miles from the PA-MD border.  Counting last year and this it has taken me 13 days to cover the 229 miles of PA.  I averaged 18 miles per day.","Fayetteville PA

I slept reasonably well.  There was another downpour at 3 am.  I was up at 5:20 and on the trail at 7:05.  The tent and some of my other gear were quite wet.  Nothing could be done about that. 
In a flash I was at the Mason Dixon Line. I'm now completely done with PA.  In some ways this was a hard state: lots of miles, lots of rocks, many miles through the green tunnel, and not that many views. 
Maryland has already had some great views.  The first was High Rock.  There were expansive views of Maryland farmland.  The middle of the day was lots of woods with a few rocky sections.  There was one view to the east.  
When I was refilling water late in the afternoon I spoke with Donkey. He recently retired from the army and is hiking the AT with his wife, Qtips.  After that they will figure out where to live.  
I sat out on Annapolis Rock watching the sun set.  The view was great.  It has been a few years on the AT since I've been at the right place to watch a sunset.  
There is no threat of rain tonight so I'm sleeping with the tent flies open to take advantage of the light breeze.","Falls Creek Campsite

I slept OK last night except for having to reinflate my air mattress several times.  I got up at 5:20 and had my pack on at 7 am.  First I went back down to the overlook to see the Maryland countryside in the morning sun.  
I made good time on a relatively easy trail.  I crossed over the I-70 bridge.  Another big interstate is behind me.  At 10:30 I arrived at the Dahlgren Backpack Campground and took advantage of the free hot shower.  I was back on the trail at 11 am.  
The longest climb of the day was to the overlook at White Rock Cliff.  I arrived at 1:10 and had a late lunch.  There were great views of farmland to the east and mountains to the south.  
It was more easy trail to the War Correspondents Monument.   I picked up 3.5 l of water since it is a long way down to the official water source at the Ed Garvey Shelter, my intended stopping point for the night.   I did not stay long because the nats were very thick.  Less than 2 hours later I was at the Ed Garvey Shelter.  I arrived at 5:35.  
Two recent college grads (Big Bad Wolf and Salty) who are hiking Maryland in three days and NOBO Barefoot are here.  Also a couple out for an overnight with their dog arrived.  
Tomorrow I'll complete Maryland.  I have enjoyed this state.  Several great views and easier trails than PA.

I slept reasonably well although there was a lot of background noise from trucks and trains in the transportation corridors in the adjoining valleys.  I got up at 5 am and was on the trail at 6:30.
I walked down hill to the C&O Cannal Towpath. It was a pleasant walk.  There were no views on the way down but I did check out the Patomac River via a few side trails from the towpath.  The river had some moderate rapids.  I passed an old lock on the cannal.    
I was in Harpers Ferry a little after 9.  I went to the ATC Headquarters and got my picture taken and signed the logbook.    I rejoined the AT and hiked to the north end of the Shenandoah River Bridge.  This ended my hike for this year but I still needed to walk another 1.1 miles to my car in the Harpers Ferry National Historic Park parking lot.  I arrived a little after 11.  
My car was just as I'd left it two weeks before.  I pushed the remote and the doors unlocked and the hatch went up.  Now I was truly done.  I cleaned up a little and then went to a Subway for lunch.  I was craving fresh vegetables.  At about 1 pm I hit the road back to Maine, arriving at 1 a.m. Tuesday moring.  
In total I hiked 195.0 miles on the trail.  It was a very relaxing hike.  I felt great the whole time.  I had no knee trouble.  More importantly, I had no blisters except for one small one on the bottom of the middle toe of my right foot.  This was a vast improvement over the prior three years.  This year, every morning  I pre-taped the bottom of both feet just behind my toes, both heals, and the outside of my big toe on my left foot.  I used KT Tape Pro kinesiology tape.  A 16 ft roll would last one week.   If conditions were relatively dry it stuck very well.  The one small blister was caused by the edge of the tape being too far toward the front of my foot and being stuck to the underside of the middle toe. 
  In some cases I could leave the tape on for a couple of days.   However, when wet it sometimes came loose during the day.  Next year I'm going to try Tincture of Benzoin as an adhering agent.  A great book on foot care is ""Fixing Your Feet"", by John Vanhof.  This is where I learned of the kinesiology tape and benzoin .  
Other things that made for a great trip this year: the town stops were perfetly spaced and I was never carrying more than 3 days of food; temperatures were cooler than the prior two years on the AT; and the terrain was a little easier. 
 I can't wait for next year's hike.  Thentatively I'll do 161 miles to Waynesboro VA or 191 miles to VA 56, Tye River Suspension Bridge.","Ed Garvey Shelter

For the past several weekends I was part of a Maine Appalacian Trail Club crew at Horns Pond campsite/shelter in the Bigelow Range in Maine.  This is the most visited campsite in Maine. Yesterday, we wrapped up building two 8'x8' mouldering privies.  This was day seven of this build.  It was a 5 mile hike in with 2000 ft of elevation gain, so this was part of training for this year's section hike.  
On the first weekend we dug 8x8 flat spots into the hillside.  Lots of work with picks, shovels, rock bars, and come-a-long.   Then, we had Maine Helicopter Service fly in 10,000 lb of materials and tools.   After that it was the actual build.  In total, 31 volunteers put 840 hours into this project.  This is a truly amazing crew.  It is a privilege to work with them.  Only two more privies to build this year!
Now that the Horns Pond Privies are built, I can continue my southbound section hike.   This year I plan on hiking from Harpers Ferry WV 191 miles south to the Tye River Suspention Bridge near Waynesboro VA.  Today I drove part way to Harpers Ferry and will complete the drive tomorrow","Home

Today was driving the rest of the way to Harpers Ferry, WV.  The drive was uneventful.  The highest outside temperature that I saw was 99 degree F - yikes!  I arrived a little before 2 pm.  Then, I had lunch at Panera Bread.   I'm staying at the Quality Inn at the North end of the Shenandoah River Bridge.  From my motel room window I can see the point in the AT where I ended my hike last year.  Things can't any more convenient than that.  
In late afternoon I explored the historic sites in downtown Harpers Ferry.  The major events in the town's history were arms manufacturing, civil war battleground, and floods which ultimately destroyed the town's industrial base.  I saw several long distance hikers in town.  I did work up quite a sweat in the 90+ degree temperatures walking around town.  
I had dinner at Mena's Italian Restaurant.  I had a good feed.   Now I'm in the air conditioned comfort of the motel.  I plan on getting a very early start tomorrow so I can get in as many miles as possible before it really gets hot.","Wallingford, CT

I was up just after 4 a.m.  I had cold breakfast in hotel room, packed everything up, and I was out the door at 5:10 a.m.   There was just a little light in the sky as I crossed the Shenandoahn River Bridge.  As I was hiking up the ridge on the other side I saw a doe with her fawn.  The fawn was very cute, hiding behind her mom, with just her head poking  around. 
In addition to the doe and her fawn, I saw lots of other wildlife:  two more does, a possum, an Eastern Box Turtle, a large frog right in the trail, a couple of chipmunks, and more gray squirrels than I could count.
The morning's hiking was easy and since it was before the heat of the day, the temperatures were manigible.  I was hiking through hardwood forests.  On a few ridges the trees were all dying, thus I was hiking in the sun.  I stopped at Buzzard Rock, but it was so hazy that the view was unimpressive.  
I was at the Blackburn AT Center  at 11:30 so stopped for lunch.  It was a steep climb down but worth it.  As soon as I arrived they offered me a cold soda.  I chatted with the PATC volunteers including Trail Boss who is in charge of maintaining the Rollercoaster.  I showed them pictures of our two most recent MATC privies.
This afternoon was hot hiking.  Drank lots of water.  Once in a while there was a little breeze.  Without it, the heat was just barely bearable.   I started the Rollercoaster.   As advertised it had plenty of steep ups and downs.   I could hear thunder in the distance but it passed me by.  
I arrived at the Bears Den Hostel at 5:20 p.m., so this was a long day.  This is a stone ""castle"".  I took the hikers special: a bunk, pizza, soda, and pint of ice cream.  About a dozen other hikers here.","North end Shenandoah River Bridge

I was up at 5 am.  I cooked pancakes and was on the trail at 6:15.  The roller coaster continued.  I just chewed away on all the ups.  In most bottoms there was a stream.  The bottoms are rock filled and the stream expands over a wide tortuous path.  No views.  I reached the end of the roller coaster just before Rod Hollow Shelter.
I had lunch at Rod Hollow Shelter, arriving at 12:30.  I stayed until about 1:30.  
The afternoon hiking was much easier but the temperatures were wicked hot. There were two highlights this afternoon.   The first were the forests of mature hardwoods.  Many were giants.  The other were the ""sky meadows"".  These were open areas filled with brambles at the high elevations.  I'm not sure if these are man-made or naturally occurring.  There were no long distance views but there was a breeze!
I saw another doe, turtle, and rabbit, also many gray squirrels. 
I was surprised by the number of NOBO thru hikers who passed me.   There must have been 16.  I thought they were all north of here.
The are three others at shelter with me.  They are brother, sister, and daughter from Illinois and Alaska.","Bears Den Hostel

I slept fitfully last night.  I was up at 5 am and on the trail at 6:20 am. 
The miles just flew by today.  I was at Manassas Gap Shelter at 8:30 for my morning break.  I was at the Denton  Shelter for lunch at 11:30.  I reached the Mountain Home Cabbin at 3 pm.  
The hiking was uneventful.  I was in the green tunnel except for the edge of a few old fields.  I saw two more deer and lots of squirrels.  A dozen NOBO thrus past me.  I was worried it was going to rain but just a few sprinkles. 
Mountain Home Cabbin is great.   Scott and Lisa are great hosts.  Went to dinner with three other hikers at the Blue Winged Frog.  Great time.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

I got up at 5:30.  I was packed and ready for breakfast at 6:30. Scott cooked scrambled eggs with toast.  He also served a variety of fruit.  I had my pack up at 7:05.
The first part of the day was a long climb up to the border of Shenandoah National Park.   This included skirting the edge of a Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute which is used to breed exotic animals for their zoo.  
I reached the border of the Shenandoah National Park at about 9:30 and filled out my back country permit.   Walking in the park was mostly easy on well maintained trails.  The were many viewpoints looking east and west.   Finally some views!   One area of the forest had mature hardwoods with an undercover of ferns - beautiful.
I saw a doe with her two fawns.   I also saw two bears.  By their size I judge they were juveniles.   One stood up from the bushes on the side of the trail and all of a sudden it dawned on me that I was looking directly at a bear and he was looking at me.  I made a few loud noises and the bear ran off.   The other was grubbing for something off in the woods. 
In the morning I encountered a family with two small children.  The youngest was 18 months old and he was already tottering up the trail.  In mid-afternoon I saw the same family at Gravel Springs Hut where I'd stopped to refill water.  At first I thought they'd made amazing time down the trail but they admitted that they'd driven with an ice cream stop inbetween.  Their young daughter  (maybe 3 yrs old) peppered me with 100 questions about what I was doing.  I happily answered all. 
At the same shelter I met a 65 year old gentleman who was section hiking north.  Between the two of us we have completed the AT.
I met a local section hiker, ""Skyline"".  He recommended a campsite near the turnoff for the PATC Range View Cabin.  There really weren't any level spots but I did the best I could.   I saw well over a dozen thru hikers.  
 The weather was spectacular.  I hardly broke a sweat.","Mountain Home Cabbin

I was up at 5:20 and on the trail at 6:45 am.  I had the trail to myself for the first couple of hours.  The trail climbed to a ridge and then followed the ridge for at least a mile.  There was evidence that a bear had followed the trail  as it had turned over many rotted logs in search of ants. How many ants does it take to make a meal for a bear?  No real views.  Also no views from Pass Mountain but at least the trail was easy.
I had lunch at the picnic area in Thornton Gap.   A NOBO section hiker reported that a juvenile bear had chased her off from the same picnic table I was sitting at just 30 min before. The table was right at the edge of the very crowded parking lot.   Needless to say I ate a quick lunch. 
The NOBO section hiker was a school teacher out for the summer and doing a short stretch on the AT.  I gave her advice on upcoming campsites.
After lunch was the big climb of the day.  It was 1200 ft up to Mary's Rock.  The trail was very crowded with day hikers.  The view from the top was outstanding.   Expansive views to the west and some to the north including much of the terrain I'd covered in the last 24 hrs.  A helpful day hiker used my camera to take several pictures of me.  He was very particular taking them from several angles. 
More great views from The Pinnacle also to the west and north.  I could see back to Mary's Rock.  Another helpful day hiker insisted on taking my picture.    There were other views along the ridge, all good. 
On my way over to Stony Man Mountain I helped a family with two small children plot a course back to their car.  I put on the afterburners for the climb up the mountain and did better than 2 mph up hill.
At the turnoff for side trail for Stony Man Mountain I reached the high point for my hike within the park,  Elev 3837.  You have to go all the way north on the AT to Stratton Mt in Vermont to get a peak higher than this.  I think the elevation was giving me altitude sickness (just joking).  
I did not take the side trail to the summit as it was getting late.  The trail down to Skyland Resort was marked with both white and blue blazes.   This was disconcerting since blue is the universal AT blaze for side trails. 
I arrived at the check-in desk for Skyland at 6:30.  I upgraded my room from a cabin way down the hill to a room 100 steps from the check-in desk.  I'd done enough walking for today!
I watched sunset from the deck.  Then I had a great dinner: bison meatloaf.  Now it is time for sleep. 
I saw at least another dozen thru hikers today.  I'll bet several will need to flip flop up to Katahdin and then hike south.  Otherwise they will miss the Oct 15 closing date for Baxter State Park.","Campsite at mile 1238.5

I've done 106.4 miles so far this year.  Not bad for day 6.  This is an average of 17.7 trail miles per day.  This leaves 84.4 miles left for this year and 5 hiking days.  This is 16.9 miles per day.
I slept great in my room last night.  The laundry  I'd done in the sink the evening before was dry except for the socks.  However, I slipped these over the end of the hair dryer that came with the room and pesto the socks were dry.  I had the AYCE buffet breakfast including a great omelet.   I talked with Sanimals Hostel in Waynesboro to make arrangements to stay there on Thursday and for shuttle back to Harpers Ferry on Sunday.
I was finally able to get on the trail at 8:45.  It was easy hiking all morning.  The trail builders did some impressive masonry work on dry laid stone walls to create a ledge for the trail.  I saw a bear cub not far from the resort.  It scampered down a tree and was gone in a flash into the bushes.
I had lunch at a picnic table in a vacant campsite in Big Meadows Campground.  I heard a gunshot.  Not long after I saw an armed ranger.  I assume the shot was the ranger trying to scare off a bear or they had come to investigate a report of a gunshot.
The afternoon hiking was also easy.  I came across a gushing spring.  It was a 10 inch pipe flowing half full.  I tanked up on water since the water source at my intended camping spot for the night was uncertain.  The high point of the day was Hazeltop Mountain (elve. 3812).  There was a great vista just north of the summit. It offered the first views to the SW.  I think I could Waynesboro in the distance. 
The local trail crew has been out doing maintenance.   They'd done extensive of trimming on sides of the trail.   I wondered how they'd been doing it.  Then I found a piece of broken off plastic string from a weedwacker.   Mystery solved!  They had also made many new water bars and cleaned out the existing bars. 
I'm at the Bearfence Mt Shelter in my tent.  There are four thru hikers and one section hiker here.  I gave them advice on what to expect up north.  It was great to have people to talk to.  I saw another dozen thru hikers.  Two  said they were going to flip flop at Harpers Ferry.  One was Woody who I may see while out working on the trail in Maine.","Skyland Resort

Last night I'd put some large rocks on the downhill side of my tent.  This turned out to be a brilliant idea.  It kept me from siding downhill during the night.  I slept reasonably well but the temperature was too high for me to be in my sleeping bag but low enough that I needed something on me.  I need to look into getting a sleeping bag liner.
I was up at 5:20 and on the trail at 6:50.  I stopped at Lewis Mt Campground for water.  There were clearly open spaces so I could have stayed there last night despite what they told me on the toll free number.  However,  if I'd  stayed there I would have missed the conversation with the other hikers.
The morning hiking was normal ups and downs through the forest.  At noon I reached Swift Run Gap, the start of a 1000 ft climb to Hightop (Elev 3531).  I decided to delay lunch so I could eat on top.  On the way up I chatted with a thru hiker who was complaining about the rocks.  Wait until she gets to PA!  I also met a thru hiker from Salem, Mass., which is next to the town I grew up in.  She will flip up to Maine and start south. 
The view from Hightop was outstanding.   I could see 50 or maybe even 100 miles south.   There were mountains as far as I could see.  Just below the summit was a great spring.   Given that is near the top, what could the source of water be?
The rest of the day consisted of two more climbs on trails through the woods.  There was just one view to the east of Powell Gap Hollow.  
I arrived at Pinefield Hut at 6:30.  There is one couple tenting  (Scott and Beth) and one in the shelter  (Pacer).  Pacer is an M.D. from PA.  Scott is a mechanical engineer who has worked for 20 years as a biomedical engineer.  Beth is an organic soap maker.  They hail from Florida.  All are nobo section hikers.

I got up a little after 5 am and was on the trail at 6:50.  Pacer was out before me.  Scott and Beth came down to shelter as I was leaving.  Larry, the PATC maintainer for the site also came by just as I started up the trail.  He was 70 and has been a volunteer since 1968.
 Easy hiking in the morning.  There was a good view from the unnamed peak at mile 1298.6 and a few others as the trail skirted Loft Mt Campground. I stopped at the Loft Mt Store for some Gatorade and a packaged muffin - better than nothing.  Just after the store I crossed the 1300 mile mark of my journey!  Soon after this met thru hiker ""Flossy"" from Bangor Maine.
I came across another black bear.  I was within 50 ft of it before it realized I was coming.  It was in the bushes, so I couldn't see it at first but it dislodged a rock as it bounded up slope and out of the way.  At this point I had a few glimpses of it.  I made noise and I couldn't hear it moving anymore so I cautiously made my way down the trail.  As moved forward I could see the bear sitting at the top of the slope watching me and waiting for me to pass so it could go back to eating raspberries from his favorite bush.  I did take a few quick pictures. 
More climbing, this time to the top of Blackrock  Mt.  I was treated to more great views but today is a little hazy. 
I took a long break and cooked an early dinner at the Blackrock Hut.  This was from about 2 to 4 pm.  I did a little trash organizing and foot maintenance as well as took a short nap.  The mother of Fiji came as I was getting ready to leave.  She is hiking with her son for a few days but needed to yellow blaze (i.e., driven in a car) to keep up.
I hiked another 5.5 miles after dinner and am camped just south of the intersection of Wildcat Ridge Trail and the AT. My site is on an abandoned roadbed between the AT and Skyline Drive.  It is very flat but very hard to drive the tent pegs into the old roadbed.
The gnats were very bad and drove me into my tent to escape the hoards.  Before the sun went down there were so many bombarding my tent that it sounded like it was raining. 
Only about 6 thru hikers passed me tokay.

Slept well last night.  I was up at 5:10 and on the trail at 6:40.
The early morning hiking was delightful.  The sun was just coming up.  There was a breeze and the temperatures were cool.  I was walking along a ridge with little elevation change.  Things don't get any better than this. 
I did notice that there were additional suitable campsites after crossing Skyline Drive about 1/2 miles south of my site.
About 4 miles south of my starting point there was clear evidence on the trail that there was a gully washer last night.  This must have been the storm I heard at 7 pm. Glad it missed me!
The trail passed through a valley with a real mountain stream - lovely  This was the beginning of a 1000 ft climb to the top of Calf Mountain.  Along the way the trail passed a large, hand painted ""For Sale"" sign stuck in the woods.  Clearly the trail was very near the corridor boundary.   There were no views from the top of Calf Mountain.  There were some views from Little Calf, however, it was so hazy that I didn't take any pictures.
It was easy walking until McCormick Gap.  There was a very steep but short climb.  It was the steepest I've seen in 100's of miles.  After that the map showed a gradual descent to Rockfish Gap.  Well it turned out to be a tough section with lots of climbs and drops over rocks and ledges.  I was so glad I wasn't doing this at the end of a 20 mile day which was the original plan.
I reached Rockfish Gap at 1:40.  I called Stanimals for a ride and ""Frog"", a hiker who is recovering from Lyme disease and is working for Stanimals in the mean time, picked me up.  Met NOBO Big Kahona.  As soon as he spoke I knew he was from Boston.   He just retired as head of maintenance for Boston VA Hospital. 
I had a late lunch in town, reorganized my stuff for the one additional night out (for just one night there was a bunch of stuff I could leave behind at Stanimals), did laundry,  had dinner, did work email, etc.  I'm back on the trail first thing in the morning.","Campsite at mile 1313.5

I was up at 5 am and packed and ready to go at 6:30.  Adam drove me to Rockfish Gap.  He was a semipro ice hockey goalie as well as an AT thru hiker and has done a substantial portion of the PCT.  The great AT photos in my room were his.  He is an accomplished photographer.   I was hiking at 7:10.
The morning hiking was easy on well graded trails.  I know I've been saying that for most mornings but it has just worked out that the hiking really was easier.  There were more giant mature hardwoods.   A beautiful mountain stream at the Paul C. Wolf Shelter.  About half way through my journey this year the streams changed from wide wet areas with the water flowing between or even under the boulders to real moutrain streams with small cascades.
I had lunch at the Humpback Rocks.   There was a view between a crack in the rocks that was like looking through a gunsite into the valley below.
In the afternoon there was hiking over rocks with lots of small ups and downs.   This slowed my progress.   I passed several long rock walls that at one time bordered farmer's fields.  These must have been hardscrabble farms.  I met thru hiker Grateful from Yarmouth, Maine.  She was born in Dexter, Maine.   She said she is going to flip from Harpers Ferry.
I made it to Maupin Field Shelter at 7:10 pm.   This was a long day.  There was no one here when I arrived but now about 4 plus me.  One was a thru hiker Baby Ruth.  The others were just out for the weekend.  Another long distance hiker came in very late.

I was up at 4:40 and on the trail at 6:10.  I'd slept well.  Now that I've been on the trail for 11 days, I'm completely used to sleeping in my tent. 
The first order of business was a 1000 ft climb to the top of Three Ridges Mountian (Elev. 3970).   I was hiking as the sun was coming up and there was a pleasant breeze - delightful.   The trail switchbacked through mature forests.  For the first time on this trip I noticed rhododendrons but they had already bloomed.   There was one viewpoint on the way up.  It looked across the valley to The Priest (Elev. 4063).  There was a thru hiker cowboy camping near this spot.
The summit of Three Ridges was wooded so no clear views.  This was the highest elevation I reached on this year's hike.  The downward journey involved many switchbacks.   I needed to loose nearly 3000 ft of elevation to get to the Tye River.  Partway down I met thru hiker Eagle Eye.  He is from Limerick, Maine.  When I was young my family spent a week every summer on Sokokis Lake in that town.  Eagle Eye is the third Mainer I've met on this trip.
There were expansive views of The Priest and the Tye River Valley from Flat Rock.  I stopped here for a break since this would be the last viewpoint on this trip.
The trail flattened a little as I got closer to the bottom.  I reached the Tye River Suspension Bridge a little after 11.  Other than the two thru hikers, I saw only two day hikers and four guys out for a trail run.
 My journey for this year was over, 191 miles in 11 days.  I had literally one drop of rain.  Although the first two days were very hot, the rest of the time was tolerable.   This was due in part to the higher elevations.
Red from Stanimals arrived early to shuttle me back to my car in Hapers Ferry.  He had me there by 2:30.  I made it halfway back to Maine and will complete the drive tomorrow.
My feet were in good shape.  Pre-taping the the trouble spots with KT tape every morning is the key.  I started with a new roll of KT tape and still had a little left over.  For dry conditions like I had this year, the tape would last for two days.  To allow for wet conditions it would be best to plan on one roll per week.  I had some minor problems between some toes.  I think this will be solved by getting boots 1/2 size bigger (this will be size 11-1/2).Every day I saw NOBO thru hikers.  However, with each successive day, the numbers decreased.  The last few that I saw will either need to be making big mile days with few days off (zeros) or will need to flip up to Maine at some point.
I start my journey next year with a 3000 ft climb to The Priest, then I'll continue my journey south.  I can't wait.","Maupin Field Shelter

I got up a 4 am and was out of hotel room at 5 am. I had breakfast at a Waffle House. They had a very simple menu - just a couple of options for eggs plus waffles. I was on the road before 6 am and arrived in Pearisburg to drop off my car at 10 am. At 11 am got shuttle up to Tye River Bridge arriving at 1:45. I'd gotten a sandwich from a Subway. I had this along the bank of the Tye River.
I started up the trail at 2:20. Initially there was no breeze so it was very hot. It was a steady climb up through a hardwood forest. At about 3:10 I heard a clap of thunder followed by a few drops of rain. The good news is that the brewing storm came with a breeze!
About 2/3 of the way up there was a view to the east out over the plains - mostly farmland. There was a storm cell clearly visible. I think this was the storm that grazed me.
I encountered a young buck who was very tame. He let me get within 15 ft. He had little stubs for horns and a moist, glistening nose. He was very curious about me.
There were no views from The Priest. This was the first mountain over 4,000 ft since New Hampshire. There was a view to the west after the summit.
I'm in my tent at The Priest Shelter. The shelter is in a grove of oaks. NOBO's CJ and Old School are in the shelter. CJ is talking up a blue streak. Four other NOBO's passed me.

The early morning hiking was wonderful. The sun was out, the temperature was comfortable, and there was a light breeze. I was hiking down the trail singing ""With My Knapsack on My Back"", as joyous song from my boy scout days.
The trail today was mostly well graded with multiple climbs and descents. I took the side trail to Spy Rock. There was a great 360 degree view and not overly hazy. 
There were an impressive array of trees. They were 99 percent hardwoods with just a few pines and spruces. For hardwoods there were oaks, maples, beaches, white ash, mountain ash, cherry, and even a few birches. There was a tree species I'd not seen before with bark with long vertical strips and leaves much bigger than birches. In many places the groves were mature with an understory of ferns.
On Cole Mountain I hiked through my first bald. It went on for 1/2 mile or so with multiple views. These are grass meadows. There were a few rock walls suggesting that the bald was once used for grazing.
I had a quick glimpse of a bear that ran across the trail. It knew I was there and wanted no part of me. He ran down slope. I was a little concerned I'd see him again as the trail switched back in the direction he ran. However, no more sightings. I also got within 10 ft of a rabbit. 
About 18 long distance hikers passed me today including Gallant from South Korea, and a threesome of Story Teller, Montana, and Rocket Legs. Banana Claus from Manchester NH is camped next to me.  He got his name by buying a pack-full of bananas and giving them away.

I slept reasonably well last night. I woke at 5:50 and was on the trail at 7:15.
The first order of business was a 3,000 ft descent. The day was already hot and I was working up a sweat going downhill. After reaching US 60 the hiking was easy as the trail followed Brown Mt Creek for a couple of miles. This was old growth forest with massive hardwoods and pines. Before the 1920's the area was farmed by share croppers and there was evidence of stone walls and the like.
After Brown Mt Creek the trail skirted Lynchburg Reservoir. Then there was a climb up Rice Mt and a crossing of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Then it was a 1/2 mile climb to the Punchbowl Shelter. The plan was to hike 3 or 4 miles more, but a severe thunderstorm hit. The thought of hiking over peaks in thunder seemed like a bad idea. Thus, I'm at the shelter for the night. So far just one other person is here, Christian from Norway.  He is out of a week or so section hike.
I'm starting to see pines unlike those of the northeast. Maybe they are yellow pine? There is also a hardwood I don't recognize, maybe hickory? 
About 10 nobos passed me today including Oats from Naples, ME.
The big storm passed but as I write this, it has started to rain again.","Bald Knob

Slept well but the bullfrogs in the nearby pond kept up a steady chorus. I got up at 5:30 and was on the trail at 7 am. 
It was a steady climb up to Bluff Mountain. I was in the sun with fog filling the valleys below. The tops of many of the surrounding peaks were poking through. It was spectacular. There was the monument to Ottie Cline Powell who wandered away from school when he was 5 years old. His body was found on the mountain.
The rest of the hike was easy. Mostly well graded and down hill. There were no views because of fog. I was at US 501 (James River) at 12:20. I'm now at Stanimals Hostel for the night.  Christian is here along with an assortment of 8 or so section and long-distance hikers.","Punchbowl Shelter

I slept great at the hostel last night. I got up at 6 am and had left over chicken parmesan for breakfast. That was good fuel for the day. They had me back at the trailhead at 7:50.
Lots of miles today. The first mile was along the James River. There were knawed trees indicating the presence of beavers. There is a dam just downstream of the AT foot bridge so the water was calm. 
The next mile was up Matt's Creek. This was a pleasant babbling brook. I had lunch on Highcock Knob.
The most interesting thing today were areas that were full of butterflies feasting on the nectar of the flowers. The most spectacular ones were black with irredesant blue near the tail. I scared up two flocks of grouse. 
I crossed the high elevation of this year's trip, Apple Orchard Mt at 4225. There is a large weather radar that dominates the summit.
There were the fewest long distance hikers so far. I counted just 10.
It was a big push on miles today. I arrived at the shelter at 7:30 PM. There is a retired couple from CT here. They have been on the trail since April. 
I'm in my tent. There is a thunder storm to the south and a few drops of rain for here.","James River Bridge

I slept like a log last night. My alarm got me up at 5:30. I was sound asleep. Without the alarm who knows how long I would have slept. I was out of camp at 7 am.
The couple at the shelter last night were Bownie and Dizzy from CT. They had done the PCT and are now doing the AT to Harper's Ferry. Dizzy definitely liked to talk.
This morning was more down than up. There are now areas with more pines. Overall it was easy walking. The first 8 long distance hikers who passed me were women ranging from college aged to retired. This is the highest concentration of women I've seen on the trail. In total, I saw 14 long distance hikers today. I am amazed that there are so many NOBOs who think they are going to make it to Kahtahdin before it closes without flipping.
For wildlife today I saw a young doe, a small turtle, a flock of grouse, small lizards (couldn't get close to one for a good look) and a red eft (like a salamander - at this stage of development they are actually orange).
There was hiker magic at the crossing with VA 614 given by Sunshine. I had a cold Coke to wash down my PB & J.
There was a major climb after lunch but then easy ridge walking for the rest of the day. There was a thunderstorm in midafternoon but the worst of it was north of me. 
At a crossing of the Blue Ridge Parkway I met Jim the ridge runner. He was looking for a long distance hiker and showed me a picture but I'd not seen him. He gave me a cold orange soda. I saved it to have with dinner.
I was at the turnoff for the shelter at 6 PM. Jim was at the shelter when I arrived looking for the hiker. We chatted for a while. Last year he did the AT in Maine from Rangely to Kahtahdin. He showed me a picture of a woman on Avery peak who had hiked up with a goat!
I had Good To Go Thia Curry for dinner. It was very tasty and a good change from Mountain House. Also it was a larger serving.
Jim stopped by again at dusk to use the privy. He'll be sleeping in his truck. I may hike with him in the morning.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

I slept reasonably well last night.  I was up at 5:00 AM and at the junction with the AT at 6:30.   Slim Jim, the ridge runner, was waiting for me.  We hiked together for the entire day.  We carried on an enjoyable conversation the entire time.  He spent 20 years as a practicing attorney but was looking for a different lifestyle.
Jim was still looking for the hiker so he stopped and asked at the NOBO's that we encountered if they'd seen him.  Several said yes, but most thought he was off the trail.  
There were a few overlooks at crossings with the Blue Ridge Parkway, but other than that it was walking in the VA forest.  I was in Daleville at 4:30.  This was a fast pace for me to cover 18.5 miles (1.8 mph).  A local ATC volunteer, Homer, gave me a ride to the Holiday Inn Express.  He took Jim back to his car at Bobblets Gap.
I had to hustle in town since I had all the normal town chores to do and I wanted to be back on the trail early the next morning.  As soon as I got to the hotel, I started my laundry.  While it was washing I took a shower.  While the laundry was drying I sorted my resupply package.  Then when it was done I went to dinner at the Cracker Barrel across the street.  After dinner I had some work email I needed to attend to and then make reservations for a hotel the night I got off the trail.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

I slept well. I was up at 5 am and out of the hotel at 6:10. I hiked down the road for a Big Breakfast at McDonald's. I was back at the trailhead at 7:15 am.
The first order of business was a 1000 ft climb to the ridge above town. After that I was on a ridge for the rest of the day. The trail headed almost due north, following a ridge around Carvins Cove Reservoir. There were multiple great views. After Campbell Shelter the trail headed back south. The were more great views from Tinkers Cliff. The views from McAfee Knob were outstanding. The best in years. 180 degree views to the west and north. Maybe I could see Apple Orchard Knob.  I had some day hikers take a picture of me on the Knob.
I saw 8 does today and one fawn. Two of the does were mature and big.
I saw about 10 long distance NOBOs today. There are two big groups at Pig Farm Campsite, just north of McAfee Knob, one is a teen adventure group and the other were boy scouts from Illinois. 
I'm tenting at Catawba for the night. Paperback Writer and Gromet are in the shelter. They are out for a long section hike. It is going to be a hot night.","US 220, Dalevile, VA

It was hot all night so didn't sleep that well. I was up at 5:30 and out of camp at 6:50.
Most of today's hiking was on ridges. The plus side is occasional views. The down side is that there are areas with exposed ledge that requires rock scrambling and even if the overall trend of the ridge is down, if there is a bump you are climbing it.
At the road crossing with VA 311 I met four members of the Roanoke Appalachian Trail Club. They were trying to keep most of the parking lot free of cars as a contractor was going to be maintaining the gravel lot. We chatted for a while.
The highlight of the day was Dragon's Tooth. It was a very rocky climb. I haven't seen this many rocks since the White Mountains in New Hampshire. There were to places with iron rungs embedded in the rock to aid in climbing.  The tooth was impressive. I could see McAfee Knob which I climbed yesterday afternoon. 
I left the Tooth at about 2:45 and still had about 8 miles to cover so I had to make tracks. I did the 5.6 miles to Trout River without a sit-down break. I arrived at about 5:30. On the way down I startled a young skunk. Fortunately, I did not get sprayed. The lower elevations used to be fields. The farmers moved an impressive amount of rocks.
At the Trout River I met Jason who lives about 200 yards from the crossing. He gave me a beer, which I saved for dinner, and some freshly roasted walnuts.
I did the last 2.2 miles and 1100 ft of elevation gain in about 1.5 hrs. Not bad for the end of a long day.
I'm at the campsite at mile 1498.0 indicated in Guthook (1497.5 by AWOL mileage). It is an excellent site with flat spots for two or three tents. It started to rain as I was setting up camp. It continued through dinner. Now there is just tree rain. However, I can hear thunder in the distance.","Catawba Mt Shelter

It was hot again last night so didn't sleep great. I was up at 5:30 and out of camp at 7:00.
I felt like I was hiking strong all day. The first order of business was to climb the rest of the way up Brush Mt. At the top there is a memorial for Audie Murphy, the most decorated veteran of WW II.  He was killed in an airplane crash near this spot in 1971.  I thanked him for his service.
The hiking was relatively easy today. I had lunch at the north end of Sinking Creek Mt. There was a good breeze so I dried out some of my gear. After lunch there were a few easy ledges to cross and then flat walking on well graded trail. I was making 2.1 mph for a couple of hours. There were a few limited views. I saw a young deer. There were rock piles left by farmers who tried to make a living on this mountain top. They had grit!
I passed the Keffer Oak, the second largest oak tree on the AT (the largest is in CT).  It had a massive crown.  I'm sad to say that it looked like it was not in the best of health.
I got confused at the road crossing with VA 42. This added about 1/2 mile to my day. The correct direction was to cross directly across the road toward the big Keep Out sign.  From this point if you look carefully you can see the trial.  On the other hand, for NOBO's once they get to the road, it is obvious that they should go directly across.
About 10 hikers passed me today. They ranged from thru hikers to section hikers out for a couple of days.

The morning hiking was on good trail. I had lunch south of Lone Pine Peak after a 2,000 ft climb. Then it was more easy walking to Wind Rock. There was a great view across the valley. The next three miles had no net elevation change but it was mostly boulder hopping. The was very tiring but still made 1.8 mph.
I passed through several areas where the rotadendeons were in blume as well as tiger lillies. 
After Bailey Gap Shelter the trail was downhill with minimal rocks - thank goodness! I crossed VA 635 and Stony Creek. Then there were several hard ups and downs as the trail followed the steep hillside next to the creek. I arrived at Pine Swamp Branch Shelter at 7 PM. I'm staying in the shelter. I'm the only one here.

I didn't sleep all that well as it took some time for the normal aches and pains from a long day's hiking to settle down. This included the soles of my feet being sore from being pounded on. I was up at 5:30 and on the trail at 6:40. 
I had a 1,200 ft climb. After that it was over 10 miles of walking on a broad ridge. It was easy walking. This ridge forms the boundary between Virginia and West Virginia. The tiger lilies were in bloom. The trail passed through an old apple orchard with impressive views to the north and west. At the south end of the ridge is Rice Field. There were more great views of WV farmland with mountains beyond.
Only one thru hiker (Jose) passed me today. Plus I met two more in town. All are planning on flipping up north. There was a 20 year old out for 45 days and two women out for a couple of days. Two day hikers rounded out the people I saw on the trail.
Mostly today I made miles, the highest daily total for this year. I was at Cross Road in Pearisburg at about 6:00 and in town at Dairy Queen having a Peanut Buster Parfait at 6:30. I reunited with my car at 7 PM. Tomorrow I visit some relatives and start the drive home.

This morning I took care of the last bit of logistics. I was at the trailhead at Cross Ave at 11:30 and hiking at 11:45. The trail climbed steadily up to Angles Rest. I was there a little after 1 pm. The trail passed through a mature hardwood forest. Good views from Angles Rest of Pearisburg and the ridge I hiked across last year. I had lunch at Angles Rest - a Subway spicey Italian sandwich - yum! This was much better than the PB&J I'll be having for lunch for the rest of the trip.
There was one more view point a little further south. This one was to the east. The rest of the hike was on an easy trail mostly though a mature hardwood forest with a few hemlocks and white pines as well as a areas of rhododendrons. I took a picture of a beautiful bloom.
I arrived at Docs Knob Shelter at 5 pm which was about 2 mph pace from Angles Rest. I'm tenting on the AT about 50 yds north of the turnoff for the shelter. Old School from southern Indiana was there when I arrived. He is doing from Damascus to Pine Swamp Shelter. Hideaway from Bangor PA arrived while I was eating dinner.

I slept well last night.  I was up a 4:30 am and on the trial at 6 am. 
Long day today so only a short entry. Mostly I was walking through the woods. There were both hardwood and evergreen stands. The trail passed through several rhododendron groves. Some were so thick that the trail went through a dark tunnel.
There were two viewpoints in the morning. There were no views after that. I saw about a dozen backpackers all out for a few days. This afternoon I did a 0.5 mile road walk to Trent's convenience store for water and cold drinks.
At one point I was sure I saw cow hoofprints on the trail.  Sure enough I saw a pile of cow plop.  There must be a farmer looking for a cow.

I slept reasonably well last night. My alarm went off at 4:30. I was out of camp at 6:05.
The morning was mostly walking on a ridge with an elevation of about 3000 ft. There were many small ups and downs. The ridge is called Brushy Mt but no brush, rather it was mostly mature hardwoods. There were no views. I did have a few fleating glimpses of a bear running away. I also saw a snail trying to run away, but it was very slow so I was able to get a picture. 
I was at the Brushy Mt Outpost at about 1:30 in the hope that I could have a real sandwich for lunch, but no luck. It was not open today. Thus, I had PB&J. 
It was another 6.9 miles to my campsite. The trail continued south on Brushy Mt. It was easy walking. There was an excellent view of Hunting Camp Creek Valley which lies to the west of the trail.
I reached the campsite at 5:35. I'm camped along Laurel Creek where it crosses VA 615. There is even a picnic table here! I have the site to myself. I washed up in Laural Creek. It feels good to be somewhat clean again. I had Good to Go chicken curry for dinner. It was excellent. 
Six NOBO long distance hikers passed me. Some are trying to make it to Maine without flipping. It will be very hard for them to make it to Baxter before they close for the winter. Two day hikers also passed me.

Slept like a log last night. I was up at 5:00 and on the trail at 6:35. The first order of business was a 600 ft climb to the continuation of Brushy Mt. Once at the top the trail followed an old forest road, so it was very easy walking. One maple growing in the middle of the road was 18 to 24 in diameter, so it's been a long time since the road was used. I wonder if it was a logging road or maybe a fire road constructed in the 1930's.
The trail dropped down to Hunting Camp Creek, then it was the big climb of the day, 1500 ft to the ridge called Garden Mountain. The rest of the day was walking along this ridge with many small ups and downs. Some of the rocky walking reminded me of Pennsylvania. I saw a deer. It wasn't overly afraid of me but I couldn't get a picture. 
A major storm hit with lots of rain and wind. At one point the wind and rain was whipping up over the edge of the ridge. I was wearing my rain gear but still got wet.
I needed to get water at a spring at Walker Gap. It was still raining and surface runoff was washing silt into the spring. As a result, my water filter kept getting clogged. 
After that it was a 1.4 mile climb to Chestnut Knob Shelter. It is in a field with views to the northeast looking out over Burkes Garden. This is bowl formed by a massive limestone sink hole that's now used for farming. I arrived at shelter at about 5 pm.
I'm staying in the shelter to try to dry things out. So far one other person is here. A section hiker with trailname ""Singer"". She's going to be a geography major at Virginia Tech.
About 6 NOBO thru hikers passed me. Most are trying to make it to Maine without flipping. 
As I write this entry, there is a rabbit at the door of the shelter munching on the floor sweeping that Singer swept out of the shelter. There is also a small black snake in the vicinity.","Laurel Creek

I didn't sleep all that well last night due to the mice gnawing on the trash in the shelter. I got up at 5:30 which is a little later than normal in deference to the other person in the shelter. Sunrise over Burkes Garden was very impressive. I was on the trail at 6:50.
The trail went through several fields with great views to the south. I think I could make out Mt Rogers, the highest peak in VA. The only downside of the fields was that the grass was tall and very wet, so my shoes and socks became soaked. 
I saw the strangest creature I've seen on the trail. It was a land based crawfish or mini lobster about 2 in long. It was complete with two tiny claws and tail fins just like a real lobster. The the elevation of this sighting was over 4,000 ft.
The bridge over Lick Creek was washed out in a flood, so I had to take off my shoes and socks. I waded across in my crocks. The water only came midway up my calf. Once on the other side I took advantage of the opportunity to wring out my socks.
I saw my first rattle snake on the trail. It sensed me coming and slithered off to the side. It was about 2 ft long.
There were several climbs today including Brushy Mt (a different one than a few days ago) and Walker Mt. On the way down off Brushy Mt I met an older gentleman who had done a thru hike in 2004. He was wearing a Trump 2020 hat.
The trail went through several cow fields. One even had cows. The cows had beaten paths everywhere so it was hard to follow the trail. I had to navigate using the Guthook app.
About a mile from my campsite I met Daniel and John, two college age friends who are out for 6 days. They are both Eagle Scouts like I am. They are camped about 0.1 mile away. I chatted with them while I ate my dinner.
I saw about 6 thru hikers, 5 section hikers and one day hiker.

I slept OK last night. It did cool off a little but it was very humid so it was hard to find the right combination of coverings to be comfortable. I was up at 5:00 and on the trail at 6:25. I passed by Daniel and John's campsite. They were still in their tent.
The hiking was very pleasant. The temperature was perfect and there was a breeze on the ridges. I took a short break at Davis Path Campsite. There used to be a shelter here but they tore it down. All that is left is the concrete footings and the front steps.
Just after the campsite I met a NOBO section hiker and his dog. His dog was very friendly and she liked to be scratched behind the ears. They are trying to make it as far as Maryland. He had just gotten hiking poles and said he hated them. I gave him some pointers on how to use them. 
At little further down I met a family from western New York who is out for 14 days. They put in at Burkes Garden and are trying to make it to Damascus. There was father, mother, son and daughter.
After a road crossing in the valley, I met a trail maintainer and his helper. They were mowing the trail with a D&R Field and Brush mower. I thanked them for their service.
I got to the Relax Inn at 10 am. This place is a throwback to 1960 and is a little tired. However, the owners are very friendly and the inn is just a stone's throw from the trail. I went up the street to a Mexican restaurant for lunch. I had a chicken taco salad and a chimichanga. It was excellent especially after 6 days on the trail. The NY family was just packing up after their lunch. I'll see them further down the trail.
So far I've done 90.3 miles in four full days and two half days. Thus, this is five ""days"" on the trail. This works out to about 18 miles per day. Today I passed a sign that said I was 3/4 of the way to Springer Mt in GA.
All of my town chores are done. I'm going to take it easy for the rest of the day.","Crawfish Trail and Campsite

I slept OK at the Relax Inn. I was up at 5 am and on the trail at 6:05.
I took my first break at Chatfield Shelter. The family from NY was there. Daniel and John were there too, still in their tent. Three NOBO thru hikers rounded out the group.
Today was easy walking. Once I made the climb to Glade Mt I was on ridges for the rest of the day with many short to moderate ups and downs. Just two viewpoints, one to the west and the other to the east. I saw one black snake about 3 ft long.
I had lunch at Partnership Shelter. There was one hiker taking a zero there or maybe he was in essence living there. He said being on the trail was better than paying rent.
I decided to push on to the Trimpi Shelter. My rationale was I was feeling good, the weather was good, and there was plenty of daylight left, so I should just keep hiking.
I passed the campsites where I had intended to stay. The campsite that was furthest south was serviceable near the convergence of two streams that were flowing strong. Just south of there the trail followed an old railroad grade. Hiking doesn't get any easier than that. I pondered what the rail line had been used for, maybe to haul out timber?
The only person at the Trimpi Shelter was Jesse, a long section hiker. She started at Springer and is trying to make it to Duncannon PA. We had a good conversation over dinner.
Tomorrow I hope to make it 20.4 miles to the Wise Shelter.

I slept well last night. I was up at 4:50 and on the trail at 6:15.
There were three big climbs today: Dicky Ridge (el. 4040), Hurricane Mt (el. 4320), and Pine Mt (just under el. 5000). This was the most climbing on this trip. Combined with 20 miles, I'm beat.
There was a detour on the trail due to a damaged bridge. This required a long road walk on VA 650. The detour was correctly shown on Guthook but it did not track the elevation change thus no Guthook elevation gain and loss today. Soon after I met thru hiker Bear Bait from Farmington, ME. We exchanged info on the trail ahead.
I was very surprised on Pine Mt to find rocks and trees similar to middle elevations in New England. There were gray birches, beech, and hemlock. The woods were densely filled in rather than the open forest of mature hardwoods that are typical of my hike so far this year. There were even lots of rocks and tree roots in the trail, just like home!
Other areas of the highlands are actively grazed. Thus they are mostly scrub brush. 
I'm camped near the Wise Shelter in the Grayson Highlands. I've already seen the wild ponies and took some pictures including of a young one. One other family is camped nearby.

I slept well last night. I was up at 4:50 and out of camp at 6:50. It took longer to get out of camp because I washed up in Little Wilson Creek and I did a thorough job of foot maintenance. 
I saw several more ponies including another mare with foal. I had to take another detour this time because the trail was blocked by a long horn cow! This was one of two long horns.
The vegetation is partially eaten down by the ponies and other livestock, leaving scrub that resembles that found near the treeline in New England. The rock type and shape of the boulders was also similar. In one area the trail went through a cave formed between two massive bouders.
The clouds during the early morning were low preventing good long distance views. I took a side trail to the summit of Mt Rogers, the highest peak in VA. The summit was all spruce and hemlock, much like the peaks in New England. 
In Elk Garden I saw another sight that reminded me of New England. A line of maple trees were tapped with a tubing system to gather the sap needed to make maple syrup.
I made quick work of the climb up to Whitetop Mt Road at over 5000 ft. I passed a gurgling spring. After a short walk through the woods I emerged in a bald below the summit ot Whitetop Mt. There was a rock outcrop called Buzzard Rock. The bald itself was light green and beautiful in the afternoon sun with the summit of Whiterock Mt to the north. There were stupendous views to the east, south, and west. There were mountains as far as the eye can see. These were the best views in VA. There were thunderheads building but none had coalesced into a storm.
A little after 4 pm I started to hear thunder. I picked up the pace in hopes of getting to camp before the rain. I didn't make it. It was raining for the last 45 minutes into camp, however, not too hard. My shoes remained dry which was the most important thing.
I'm at Lost Mt Shelter. There is one section hiker here as well as four college age kids out for a few days. The section hiker talks nonstop. I'm in my tent which I set up during a rainstorm. There is still tree rain falling as I write this entry.
I saw only two thru hikers. Both will be flipping to Maine. There were multiple backpackers out for a few days and many day hikers.

I slept well last night. There were more rain showers until sometime after midnight. I was up at 4:45 and on the trail at 6:10. My tent and rain jacket were still wet from the rain so had to put away as is.
The hiking was mostly easy with two climbs. For a short distance the trail followed the Virginia Creeper Trail, an abandoned rail line that's been converted to a biking and walking trail. The AT climbed up to a ridge before dropping down to US 58 then climbing Cuckoo Knob. This was the last climb for this year and the last view.
I was at the outskirts of Damascus at 2:20 then a quick one mile road walk into town where my car was parked. I was there at about 2:40. I was moving fast today because of a light pack and the pull of the car.
I saw no thru hikers and 12 section hikers including an extended family of 10.
Overall this was an outstanding trip this year. I had the best views in VA on day 9 from Buzzard Rock. Grayson Highlands with the ponies was great. Sunrise from Chestnut Knob was impressive. The New England like vegetation around Mt Rogers reminded me of home. I only got rained on twice and the temperatures were mostly comfortable.

Goodbye Virginia, hello Tennessee 
I slept well at the Dancing Bear Inn. I was up at 5 am and on the trail at 6 am. Several miles south of Damascus I crossed the VA/TN state line. After three seasons of hiking in VA, it was good to enter a new state.
The trail today was easy. I was at Abington Gap Shelter before 11 am. I had lunch south of the forest road at an abandoned log shelter at 11:30.
The trail was almost all in the woods. There was just one view to the northeast about 1.6 miles north of Double Springs Shelter. I arrived at the shelter at 4 PM. This is the earliest I've made it to my intended campsite in years. The spring is 100 ft from the shelter with a good flow. Snoopy, a section hiker from South Carolina, is here. He is going NOBO and is out for three days.
Other than Snoopy I saw two long distance NOBO section hikers (Willy, who is a splitting image of Willy Nelson including two pony tails,  and Little Bird), two out for a run, and a couple taking a walk with their dogs.
The only wildlife today was a squirrel and several raptors.","Damascus, VA

I was up at about 5:15 today after a good night's sleep. I chatted some more with Snoopy. He is an electrical engineer who works for a manufacturing company.
Today was mostly hiking in the woods. In the early part of the morning the trail passed through a pasture with cows. This was followed by the only road crossing of the day. After this, the trail followed a ridge. There were just a few places with limited views to the east. I had lunch at the spring and campsite at mile 1751.6. I refilled on water at the spring at 1754.4. It was flowing strong. I'm camped at mile 1757.4. There is a spot with room for just one tent. 
I saw two groups of section hikers. The first was a Mennonite or Amish family. The mother and three teenage daughters had ankle length dresses and head scarfs. The father was neatly trimmed, i.e., no long beard. They were out for just over 200 miles. In prior years they'd hiked from Springer Mt. The other was a couple from NC that are pecking away at the trail in sections. 
No wildlife today.
I had planned to camp at the spring at mile 1754.4 but there were no suitable sites. There was a great site 0.2 north of the spring but I wasn't going to hike back to that. A comment in Guthook suggested that there was a site 0.9 south of the spring at an overlook but it wasn't suitable. I kept going until a found a site that was workable.

I slept well last night. I just slept in my sleeping bag liner. Early in the night that was too hot. By the early morning I was just a tad cold.
I was up at 5:05 and was hiking south at 6:35, This was 90 minutes to get out of camp which is par for the course.
First I hiked down to Wilber Dam Road. There was another campsite 0.5 miles south of the one I was in. It was nicer than the one I was had chosen.  There was another campsite before the road.
I crossed Watauga Dam, an earth/rock dam. There was a hydroelectric station connected to the reservoir by a tunnel. There was a glory hole spillway to pass high flows. The dam was constructed from 1942 to 1949. Today the reservoir was high as evidenced by submerged trees around the perimeter. This was most likely due to the rains last Thursday and Friday.
The trail skirted the reservoir for a mile or two then the real work of the day began, a 1700 ft climb up Pond Mountain. I had lunch at the unofficial campsite at the top. The spring serval-tenths of a mile below the top was flowing strong. Next was a long drop down to the Laurel Fork. The trail along the Fork was very rocky with significant ups and downs.
Laurel Fall was SPECTACULAR. It was by far the best waterfall on the AT. The river was high due to the rains so that added to the magnificence. After that there was a long rock staircase up to an old railroad grade which brought me to Dennis Cove Road. At one point the railroad grade emerged from a rock cut then into nothingness.  There must have been a trestle across the river.  The trial picked up on the grade after a short detour across the stream. Once I reached Dennis Cove Road, it was going to be a 0.6 mile road walk to the Black Bear Resort but the owner was driving by at the perfect time and picked me up. I'm now relaxing on the porch of my cabin listening to a small stream. I hope to get a very early start tomorrow.
Today I saw one woman doing a random section hike, two women out for three days, and two people out for a day hike. There were lots of day hikers near Laurel Fork and the falls.

I had a good night's sleep in my cabin. I sleep better in a real bed than in my tent - less tossing and turning. I got up at 4:30 and was walking down the road at 5:45. After a 0.6 mile road walk I was at the Dennis Cove Trailhead at 6:00, as planned.
Today was mostly hiking through the forest. The forests are mostly mature hardwoods with some evergreens. Some trees are over 200 ft tall. In many areas there is little undergrowth because the giants are catching all the sun.
The geology has changed to hard metamorphic rocks resulting in some major boulders and some limited exposed ledges. The latter gave a few views.
I had lunch at the Upper Laurel Fork campsite near a small cascade. Later I passed by Mountaineer Falls.
I was hiking strong all day which was necessary since I had lots of miles to cover. I'll need to do the same tomorrow.
I passed a few NOBO section hikers: father and son, a threesome, a solo woman, and a solo guy who passed my campsite when I was eating dinner. There were also a couple of people breaking camp a few miles south of Dennis Fork Road.
For wildlife I saw a turkey and a squirrel. I saw many deer tracks in muddy areas.
I'm camped at an excellent campsite at mile 1793.8. This is about 0.2 miles north of Campbell Hollow Road. I can just see some homes through the trees. I can hear people mowing their lawns, vehicles, etc.

The highlights today were all the balds I crossed including Hump Mountain, Little Hump Mountain, and Jane Bald. There were mountains as far as the eye could see. Truly outstanding - this is why I hike. At the high elevations the hardwood forests with lots of oaks gave way to pure stands of maple. There were birch in a few areas. At the highest elevations were spruce-fir forests. I saw several Gray's Lillies which are very rare and found in only a few places. 
There were a multitude of day hikers and short distance backpackers, and a few long distance section hikers. There was a summer camp group with 20 boys out for about 15 days.
For wildlife I saw deer and rabbits. 
I'm camped near the Roan High Knob Shelter. With an elevation of 6186 this is the highest shelter on the AT. The shelter was a log cabin that I assume was for the lookout at the fire tower what was on the knob.  The cabin was very dark and dank so I chose my tent. The water source was flowing good. I'm the only one here but I can hear people noises through the woods.

I was up at 5:30 and on the trail at 7:10. Someone did stay in the shelter last night as I saw a headlamp just after my alarm went off.
There were three rainstorms today. The timing for the first on was perfect as it started a little after 12 noon as I arrived at the Clyde Smith Shelter for lunch. I kept dry as I ate lunch. The rain stopped by the time I was ready to get back on the trail. The second was about 2 pm. I just put on my raingear and kept hiking. The last one was just after I got my tent set up. I filtered water in the pouring rain. I cooked my dinner under the cover of the shelter. 
I saw many red efts today. These are orange newts. In some spots I could see three at once. A young deer bolted through the campsite during the last downpour. 
There is evidence of people's prior use of this land. There are the remains of barbed wire fences especially at the TN/NC  border, long abandoned apple orchards, and woods roads. 
One bulldozer trail cutting across a steep hillside at a very steep angle, combined with the upward sloping trail that I was on momentarily caused me to loose track of which way was vertical. I had to close my eyes for a moment to regain equilibrium.  This was the same effect as optical illusions that are created to make it look like water is flowing up hill. 
For people I saw a local trail chapter work crew, several section hikers (grandfather and granddaughter, Rip as in Rip Van Winkle, and a husband and wife).

I got up at 5 am and was on the trail at 6:30. The tent was soaked but there was no choice but to roll it up as is.
For most of the morning I was hiking through low clouds. There was a big climb to Unaka Mountain (elevation 5,180). The top was a pure spruce forest. I went through an area where the trail was overgrown with grass and weeds. They were soaking wet. It was like walking through a car wash. My boots were full of water. At times it was very breezy. I wonder if this was lingering aftereffects of Hurricane Elsa. By lunchtime I'd already done 10 miles, thus I was making great time.
By afternoon the weather started to clear and the sun came out at times. I met a woman from Eustis, Maine who is section hiking NOBO with her niece. 
I arrived at Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel at 4 pm. I unpacked all my wet gear. It's 8 pm and am still working on drying things out. I ordered Domino's delivery for dinner. 
I saw two NOBOs who are doing a thru hike. They will flip up to Maine at some point. A guy at the hostel (Ursa) will be doing the same thing. I saw a few other section hikers. There are several section hikers at the hostel. I spent quite a bit of time talking to Ticker who hopes to make it to Harper's Ferry this year.

I got up at 5 am. It took me a while to get my gear organized, in part because my cabin was so small and most of my stuff was spread out drying. I got on the trail at 6:50.
The first order of business was climbing the switchbacks out of the Nolichucky Valley. Part way up there were some views of the valley which was still filled with clouds. Once out of the valley, the trail contoured around the hillsides for miles. The trail miles were probably twice the straight line distance as the trail dipped into all the gullies.
By midafternoon I'd made a long climb to High Rocks (elevation 4280). There were some views of the valley and a gathering storm. Just after High Rocks I saw two does. They were not scared of me. I got some pictures. 
Next was a drop down and then more climbing to over 5000 ft. The whole time I could hear thunder. I was trying to get over Little Bald (elevation 5220) before the storm hit. I just made it. I hiked the last mile to the shelter in the rain. The rain had eased off by the time got to the shelter. I'm staying in the shelter because of the rain still dripping off the trees.

After that it was a long descent to Sam's Gap and I-26. In the parking lot, a family getting ready for a day hike gave me an apple, the first trail magic in years. I had a late lunch at the Hogback Ridge Selter. The family who had given me the trail magic was there.
I had 8.8 miles to go to my intended stopping point for the day. Thus, I had to keep moving. There were was one area with views. I got some good pictures of the gathering storm clouds. There were a few light rain showers. My legs are getting tired from many long days with no short or rest days, but I'm almost done for this year.

It took me a while to fall asleep last night due to the accumulated aches and pains of nine days on the trail each with big miles and no days off.
I got up a 5:15 and was on the trail at 6:45. The first order of business was a climb to the top of Big Butt Mountain (elevation 4815). Yes, that is its name. There were a few grassy areas where their could have been views, but the clouds were rising up out of the valleys so I was partially in the fog.
After a short down and up, the trial passed over a series of ledges with views of a major, broad valley in TN to the west and seemingly endless mountains in NC to the east. The trail was very tricky with significant rock scrambling. This was the highlight of the day. There were also some ripe blueberries - yum!
After that the trail skirted Camp Creek Bald on a moderately rocky trail. The trail transitioned to a mostly easy descent to Allen Gap. I'm camped about 0.6 miles north of the gap. The guides did not indicate a campsite in the area but there are often unofficial campsites near major road crossings or at the top of ridges. The map showed that both were checked off. Thus, my intuition was correct and I'm at a well used site.
Today I saw three solo NOBO section hikers and a camp group with about a dozen girls who were out for a week.
When you are on the trail a common question to ask is ""How long are you out for?"" This is the exact opposite of what you'd ask someone in prison: ""How long are you in for?"" The freedom of being on the trail is indeed the exact opposite of being confined in prison. 
No notable wildlife today.
I crossed the 1900 mile mark today. 
I had Helen's Choice African Peanut Stew for dinner. It is worth having again.
This is my last night out for this year. If all goes well, when I make a similar entry next year, it will be the night before summiting Springer Mountain and completing the AT.","Flint Mt Shelter

I was up at 5 am after a great night's sleep. I was on the trail a 6:35.
After a short descent to Allen Gap, there were multiple climbs to Spring Mt Shelter. The total elevation gain was 1318, but there were also some ups and downs in between so the total was more like 2000. Several of the climbs were steep. Next was another drop and then climb to Rich Mt Lookout Tower. The view from the tower was excellent. Next I dropped down to Tanyard Gap where I stopped for a quick lunch. 
There was a little more climbing but mostly it was downhill to Hot Springs, NC at elevation 1326. Walking through town I had a couple of tourists ask if I was a thru hiker. I said no, I was a section hiker and had done over 1900 miles over 12 years. They were impressed. 
I saw no one on the trail until 11 am when I got to the turn off for the Rich Mt Lookout Tower. This was typical for this year, there were long stretches of the trail where I saw nobody. Overall today I saw two section hikers and one thru hiker who was going to flip up to Maine. There were multiple groups of day hikers around Mt Rich and near Hot Springs. One woman with her two sons where hiking up the ridge out of Hot Springs. As she trudged up hill, the woman asked me if this way the way to the parking lot? I asked which parking lot, the one in Hot Springs? She said yes. I then told her that she needed to turn around and hike down to get to the parking lot. She said she was so glad that she had encountered me. I wondered how someone could get so confused on an out and back hike where one direction was all up hill and the other was all down hill.
No significant wildlife today.
I reached my car at 4:15 and was ready to start the drive home at 5 pm. In total I did 196.3 miles with over 10 miles of elevation gain and loss. This was a much more strenuous section of trail than any since New Hampshire. 
I have 274.6 miles left to go to reach Springer Mt. If all goes well, I'll complete the trail next year. With that distance, if I have any sense, I'll take one or two zero days to recover in the middle of the hike.","Campsite at mile 1902.8

D6,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658535,"My plan for this year is to complete my section hike of the Appalachian Trail.  Over 11 seasons (2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021), I've completed 1918.5 miles, Mt. Katahdin to Hot Springs, NC.  With the exception of 2009 when I did the southern 2/3 of the Long Trail, which coincided with about 100 miles of the AT, I've done the hikes in order as a SOBO.  In 2010 and 2015 I was out west and completed the Colorado Trail.
This year I hope to complete the final 275 miles from Hot Springs, NC to Springer Mt.  All my other hikes have been in July.  This will be a new experience hiking in the fall.  I have my shelter reservations for Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  I have my food and gear organized.  The long range weather forecast is good.  I can't wait to get on the trail!","Home
