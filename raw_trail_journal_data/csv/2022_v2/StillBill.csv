overall plan for the sixth year of my six month hike is a repeat of
last year's hike that ended on the first day, due to another closed
avulsion fracture of my right ankle. As in 2019, I will be hiking
with my friend Boo Boo. 
I will start again where I stopped in 2018 and 2021 at Rattle River
in Gorham NH hiking north 298.8 miles to the northern terminus of the
AT at Katahdin which is in Maine's Baxter State Park. This will
finish my hike of the Appalachian trail.",,Overall Plan,"Aug 01, Mon",0

couple of things about training for the hike this year. My hiking
start weight is down a few pounds from last year. My backpack weight
has been 35 pounds and I am planning for about the same this year.

During
the winter I walked 10,000 steps per day, increasing that number in
the spring to 20,000 steps per day around downtown Toledo. I finally
got back on a regular basis to the weight room. By summer, I was
walking over 30,000 steps per day, with about 10,000 of these steps
coming from walking the ramp of a parking garage. Mid July I started
walking the stairs at the Commodore Perry with increasing pack
weight.","Toledo OH

the hardest mile of the whole trail. About a mile into today's hike
was the start of Mahoosuc Notch which most concede to be the most
difficult mile of the AT. It's one mile of jumbled pit of boulders.

A great hard day of hiking. Worked the way up Bigelow Mountain west
peak. There was a big wind storm at the peak, and we sat down on the
back side of the mountain to get out of the wind. Watching six other
hiking going on, and not coming back, so we decided to give it a try.
Big wind was coming from the east, but after a short climb, you could
safely move off to your left out of the wind for good. Ended just
past it at Avery Memorial campsite.","Hostel of Maine

next to Harrison's Pierce Pond Camps where you can get a big pancake
breakfast, and we were first in line. Three miles from camp is the
Kennebec river where you must use the canoe ferry service. The
service is free daily from 9am to 2pm. After crossing we stopped in

heat, and this was a hot day. Early in the day, we went up a 1,000'
to Pleasant Pond Mountain. Nine and a half miles into the day's hike,
I was really feeling the heat. I said that I had to stop and take a
nap at Bald Mountain Brook lean-to which we did for about 20 minutes.
I was clearly having issues on this day. As we started going up Maxie
Bald Mountain, Boo Boo pointed out that this was one of the very few
mountains on the trail that has a bad weather bypass trail and that I
should take it. I agreed. As Boo Boo went up and over the mountain,
my path was about a half an hour shorter. Somewhere in the middle of
the bypass, I could see the peak of the mountain, there was no way
that I could have made that climb. On the other side of the mountain,
where the bypass meets back up with the main trail, Boo Boo found me
there past out. I somehow made it to Bald Mountain Stream camp to
send the night.","Boise-Cascade

was coming. Up before the sun, with no rain, that lasted about 10
minutes. We had to put the day on hold for a few minutes until the
heaviest of the rain passed. The rain would last all morning, but we
needed to get moving. This day saw us ford water five times.
The trail was mostly somewhat flat meaning it was nothing but tree
roots and mud. We came off trail on ME 15 and a man stopped to gave
us a ride into Monson, ME to Shaw's hostel.","Bald Mountain

on schedule, we decided to do three days of slackpacking from here
and not take a zero. Shaw's dropped us off at Otter Pond Parking and
we had to hike to the trail from there. Heading south, we ford six
water crossings on this day, bring the total fording to 14. The first
half of the day was hard slow hiking, but we could pick up a little
speed the second half heading back into Shaw's.","Shaw's

this time heading north. Up a 1,000' to Barren Ledges for some nice
views, then up another 600' to the top of Barren Mountain where there
are some remnants of a tower. Down a bit and then back up to Fourth
Mountain. Down to Mount Three and a Half, and back up to Third
Mountain/ Monument Cliff where there is wreckage from a plane crash.
Next up was some more hard hiking going over the Chairback Mountains.
We got picked up on one of the very few roads in the Wilderness,
called Katahdin Iron works Rd. spent the night again at Shaw's.","Otter Pond

half, this time we headed south back to Katahdin Iron works Rd. Going
up over 2,000' to get to the summit of White Cap Mountain which
stands at 3,650'. The last “Big” mountain before Katahdin. There
must have been over 1,000 man made steps on the way up. The steps
made it a little more bearable, but it was still a hard climb. Up
and down for the six miles after that to West Peak. The final seven
miles for the day were downhill that included Gulf Hagas which is
known as the Grand Canyon of Maine. There are some big ass trees
there. Right before the pick up point, we had to do our 15th
ford of the hike across West Branch Pleasant River, it was a wide
ford with a slick rocky bottom.","Logan Brook

out, headed north. Back into water right away for the 16th

from about 50 miles away. I'm not sure if the last fording was over

and came up to the border of Baxter State Park. Like most hikers, I
stayed at Abol Bridge Campground. They have a restaurant out front,
and all the other hikers just dropped their backpacks and headed in
to”calorie up”. I was right with them. Boo Boo and I shared a
campsite with a hiker named Money Stash. We will be up early tomorrow
for it is of the most importance that we get a campsite for tomorrow

Hiked 10 miles. To get a campsite at the Birches, you need to be one
of the first 12 hikers to sign-up just inside the park at a Ranger
Station kiosk. The Ranger is to show up at 7am and assign the spots.
To guarantee that we would be two of the hikers picked, we got up at
1am to be first and second in line. I can tell you that it was a cold
dark night out there at that kiosk. It was light by 6am, and by 7am,
when the Ranger was due there were 13 hikers in line. Well, 7 came
and went with no Ranger, by 7:30am all the hikers were in agreement
that we were done waiting so we got a piece of paper and made our own
list. Boo Boo and I were number 1 & 2 on the list. After the list
was made, each hiker took a
photo of the list. All the other hikers then went back to the
restaurant for breakfast with just the two of us heading up the
trail. The hike was 10 miles of tree roots and mud. The Birches
campsite Ranger Station is at Katahdin Stream Campground and we
needed to report in. The Ranger was out to lunch so we made the
decision to just take 2 sites, set up our tents and then check in
with the Ranger. By the time we got back to the Rangers Station, he
was outside sitting at a picnic table with about 20 hikes around him.
Just then, he looks at his phone and says that he wants to start
cleaning up the list and ask if Boo Boo and StillBill were present.
We raised our hand and he had us come forward to be signed in. By
5:30pm, I was out for the night.","Abol Bridge

Hiked 5.2 miles to the summit, and somewhere around 5 miles back
down. I've been told that Katahdin
takes no prisoners,
We were planning that it would take 7 hours to go 5,000' over 5 miles
to the summit. The summit is the northern terminus of the AT. Got up
at 4am and was heading out of the Birches by 5am. The first thing on
the way was to stop by the Rangers Station at Katahdin Stream
Campground to store as much of our gear as possible in the lean-to
out front. This way we would be slackpacking with about 10 pounds on
our backs and not carrying around 35 pounds for the day. By the time
we got on trail it was 5:30am and the first light was upon us. By 6am
it was light. The first 2 ½ miles went easy and fast. Next came the
rock climbing. The poles were put away for the climb. There were by
now a few people in front of us and we could see where and how they
were moving forward. This went on for about a mile, and then we came
onto the Tableland. Standing back up and getting our poles back out
we hiked the final 1.6 miles to the summit. Overall, it wasn't that
bad of a climb. Stayed at the summit for about 45 minutes getting
photos, talking to other hikers and some personal time for reflection
of this event. Made the decision
to
not return the same way we came up, so we descended by way of Abol
Trail. It was about one mile very close to straight down. The first ¼
miles probably took an hour. The whole Abol Trail was listed as 2.8
miles, but it was much longer than that. Once down we headed into
Millinocket, ME and stayed three nights at The Appalachian Trail
Lodge. Starting each day having breakfast down the street at The
Appalachian trail dinner, and then for the most part just laid around
all day. The way home was two buses to Boston and then a 17 ½ hour
train ride back to Toledo.","The Birches

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659187,"Looking
back, the odds of completing the trail are small, and I had many
failures. My
goal in 2017 was to thru-hike the AT, I failed to reach that goal, it
ended up being a good thing for me.
I can say that I was not surprised by the brutality of the trail, the
pain, the agony, the suffering, The trail is riddled with problems,
trials
and struggles. I was surprised by its magic and wonder. I hiked with
Giants.
I chose the hardest thing, and I did it intentionally. I had gone
into the wilderness and braved the elements and even though I got my
butt kicked by nature, sometimes brutally hard, I learned and
survived to live another day. The trail has a way of reducing living
down to the basics, and in the process of doing so, you realize how
little you truly need to be happy.

A
few things I can now say I did: 

I
have hiked the States of Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts,
Maryland, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, Vermont, and Virginia.

By
hiking the 2,194.3 miles of the Appalachian trail, I have hiked the
Great Smoky Mountains, The Blue Ridge Mountains, Jefferson National
Forest, Cherokee National Forest, Shenandoah National Park, All 50
miles of “The Rocks”, The Eastern Continental Divide, The Green
Mountains, 106 miles of The Long trail of Vermont, The Presidential
Range, The White Mountains, Grafton Notch State Park, and The 100
miles of Wilderness.

I
have summit: Clingmans Dome 6643', Mt. Guyot 6621', Mt. Kephart
6036', Blood Mt 4458', Max Patch Mt 4629', Big Bald Mt. 5516',
Courthouse Bald 4708', Standing Indian 5435', Unaka Mountain 5180',
Roan Mountain 6212', Mt Rogers 5729', White top 5518' , The Priest
4063', Three Ridges Mountain 3959', Mt. Greylock 3491', Killington
Peak 4235', Mt. Moosilauke 4830', Mt. Lafayette 5249', Mt. Washington
6288', Mt. Jefferson 5712', Mt. Madison 5366', Bigelow Mountain 4145'
and Katahdin 5267'. Just to name a few.

I
have conquered: Dragon's Tooth, McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs, The
Roller Coaster, Jacob's Ladder, The Lemon Squeezer, The Stairway to
Heaven, Wildcat Mountain Ridge, Mahoosuc Notch (the hardest mile),
Mahoosuc Arm, Knife Edge, Bear Rocks, Bake Oven Knob, and Lehigh Gap,


I
have been to Audie Murphy's Monument, Pennsylvania's Washington
Monument, the Monument for all war reporters killed in action, and
High Point State Park New Jersey. I saw the ponies in Grayson
Highland park, to name only a few.

I
stayed at the Bears Den in Virginia, Devil's Backbone, Stanimal's,
The cabin at Upper Goose Pond, Skyland In Shenandoah NP, the Doyle in
Duncannon Pennsylvania, Greylock Bascom Lodge, The Inn at Long
Trail, the Notch Hostel, Jen's House :) , Lakes of the Clouds hut by
Mt. Washington NH, Hiker Hut, The Hostel of Maine and Shaw's in
Monson ME. Most nights I camped in the wild of the Appalachian Trail.

This
is a journey few people make. The Appalachian trail is traversed by
incredible people all of which have a unique story. I need to thank
my hiking mentor Ron White again for whom I learned so much about how
to hike, and all the other hikers, through the tears and the laughter, you were a joy to deal with. Thanks to everyone for all the
love and support you gave me on this journey of a lifetime. 

To
Christina, you told me that my plan to hike the Appalachian trail was
“Grossly Ambitious”, as normal, you were correct!
