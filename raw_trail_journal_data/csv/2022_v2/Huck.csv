Huck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646877,"To Hike or Not To Hike 
Well, I’m going to hike the Appalachian Trail next year. Right?  I want to say something less committed but, if I don’t start being sure, then the time will pass and the opportunity will be gone. I’ve been acting like this is my plan: buying gear, reading journals, watching YouTube hiking gurus–I’ve been doing that for a couple of years. Lately I’ve avoided things that get me excited about the idea. I feel like if I get excited now, I might stop perpetually thinking and planning and keeping my options open. But the time for noncommittal attitudes is just about past. If I really want to do this I have to commit. I may even have to tell people. Nothing keeps you on track quite like the expectations of other people. 
So, why and why now? I’ve acted like I wasn’t sure and this is partly true. I had some strong romantic reasons--the old dream, just hiking off into the wild, punctuating my new life as a retiree, proving myself. When I was a kid, we used to drive under overpasses that had signs on them hanging over the highway… Appalachian Trail–that was the start.  I hiked pieces of it as a scout and during college. Doris and I were going to hike it before we were married. I guess, you know, I always wanted to do it. It’s unfinished business. And this is my chance, probably my last chance. I’m not getting younger. It seems like every day something else hurts. That big ticking clock is a big motivator. I mean, I had cancer! Friends have died younger than I am now. It’s now or never I’m afraid. If I put this off like I have so many things--visiting Pease, Bubba, Allan Rench--it will suddenly and irrevocably be too late. 
I’m pretty sure that I can do this. I tested myself on the Superior Hiking Tail. It was hard but I liked it. I miss it now. I actually enjoyed sleeping on the ground for a month. I have the skills and most of the gear. I have the time and the money--I figure I need at least $500 a month. That’s really low ball, closer to a thousand is more realistic. That’s $20/day for food (high end) and $300 or so for hotels/hostels like once a week for showers and laundry. Hell, I’ve spent enough on gear already that I sort of have to go ($400 tent, $200 pack, $100 poncho…). I still need a stove, and sleeping bag, maybe a very good raincoat. 
When I got to the end of the SHT, my first thought was of Chuck Pease. That trip and the AT aren’t memorial trips exactly but there is something going on. I kinda feel like I have these dead friends with me, like I’m doing it for them. Clearly, they cannot because they waited too long. In part, their loss just kicks me in the ass but more than that, they urge me to not delay. I’d like to think that 5 or so months of hiking will afford me time to think of these people and all the others. To, in essence, pray for the dead. But I already know that I have trouble thinking about anything while hiking. Still, my first thought at the completion of the SHT was of Chuck Pease. I think I won’t have to purposely carry their memories along; I just will. I’m way past thinking they can feel my hand outstretched, but they all had more travels in them, more adventures. Even the old timers like Bruce and Lambert, Sue and Donna. 
And why not? It turns out that there are plenty of reasons not to hike the hike. Is it really more than self indulgent bullshit? Would I do just as well to keep making my award winning scones? My family needs me. Even if all I do is plant the garden and wash the dishes. These people are still trudging off to work, trying to figure out their entire lives, suffering the normal fears and travails of life as we know it. Is this the time for such a selfish enterprise? My baggage doesn’t even let me see this argument honestly. All my family are too self reliant  and generous to say please Papa, don’t go; we need you. They also don’t think they have the right to state their own needs or desires. Especially desires. We don’t do desires.
I do worry about how I will deal with the guilt. I know I can take care of a lot of business ahead of time: set up auto pay and stuff. It turns out that Doris and Iris especially are really good at emergencies. So if things really turn to shit they’ll be OK. I, myself, am pretty useless in a pinch. None of my kids are about to take their first steps--well Amos might be making long term professional decisions.  And I think at least once a week I should be able to make contact--I guess phone service is really unreliable outside of towns. I already struggle with loneliness so that won’t be different on the Trail. I’ve long since reconciled with my loner temperament. 
People say you don’t fail. You hike what you hike. I’m pretty sure that, even though I’m pretty philosophical about failure, I won’t take it well if I don’t complete the Trail. And I know I won’t complete the Trail if I’m uncertain at the beginning. I need to commit to complete or I’ll bail. I’m torn between telling people what I plan so I will not want to let them down, and keeping my plans private so I have wiggle room. I think I will feel shame if I quit unless the circumstances are severe. I would just feel old and like I’d squandered my only chance. Is the chance of failure worth the risk of trying? The real conundrum is between letting myself down and fulfilling my expectation of failure. 
I’d sure like this attempt to be a lesson for all--old and young. Living life to the fullest and adventuring even late in life. I’d like to overcome my own inborn lack of expectation. It would be really awesome to round out my adventuring life with one more long trip. It is worth noting that Doris suggested the Mississippi River trip and once planned this one, too. I fantasize that my old students will be inspired to “light out for the territories.” This might just be justification, an attempt to make the idea feel less selfish, but it is valid.
You can see how I keep talking myself into and out of the Hike. Let’s just say that my deadline for shitting or getting off the pot is New Year. January 1. Call it. I am to the point now where I know that if it were just me–no family to worry about or to worry about me, I’d go for sure. Ask me right now? I’m going man. I’m pumped! Psyched! I may feel differently tomorrow. 
I’m going. Couldn’t sleep last night. I’m pretty freaked out now about all the planning and the actual leaving. I guess there will be many more nights like that up until I actually pack up and go. After that, I’ll be easy. Right?",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Mon",0
Huck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647020,"Well,
Tomorrow will be the 23rd of February. One month later at dawn I will board the plane for Georgia. After a couple of days with my daughter, Eva, in Alabama, she and her husband, Thad, will drive me to Amicalola Falls State park to begin my Appalachian Trail Thru Hike. March 27 is my registered start date. The rubber is about the hit the road.
I’m a little freaked out, a little excited. I have a month to take care of bidnes–taxes, checking the sump pump, paying off Blue Cross… My outfit is just about set. I still need a battery backup. My base weight is 23 pounds. With a week of food and a liter of water I’m at 36 pounds. Feels like a ton!
What could I drop? I just added a one pound chair. I think I’m taking that; it’s the sort of luxury that could make the difference between finishing and being miserable. They say you pack your fears; I have 2 pounds of rain related gear! Poncho, raincoat, pack cover, rain fly. I could have a lighter sleeping bag but I have a bag that I know works. Could shed a pound there. Maybe I’ll ship it home in June when it’s warm. 

I’m really looking forward to the start, stepping off onto the trail at Amicalola and starting the 8 mile climb up to the trailhead at the top of Springer Mountain. After the first 100 meters it will sorta suck–hundreds of stairs–but those first few steps away from my everyday life and into the unexpected. I don’t dare to hope to someday climb Mt. Katahdin in Maine but I secretly imagine the trill of finishing there and posing in that iconic final photo on the sandwich board at the top of the mountain at the end of the trail.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Tue",0
Huck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647019,"What does one do for 6 months in the woods on the trail along the backbone of eastern North America?  Hiking the Appalachian Trail. Is it enough to put one foot in front of the other? Stumble along. Suffer through. I hope for more than that. But...that might be enough if it carries me through. 

I hope to write some. You know, just think on paper, digress, observe. I plan to make that a regular thing. I'd like to revisit the ""Book of Delights,"" an effort to find and explore the delights of the day, to seek out and share something delightful every day. I think the seeking and the every day aspects are key. I believe or hope that if sought, delight surrounds us constantly though we often chase it away like the skittish thing it is. It may be more important to make the effort in the rain climbing  to a height tripping over roots and rocks alone among strangers feeling decrepit and wondering why I'm not back home in a favorite chair. 
I'm good at delights, too. I notice tiny flowers and bugs and the song of insect and bird and breeze. Often I adapt to the folks around me who stomp through the world trampling delights right and left.  Soon, only my own discipline and determination will stand between me and delightful days. 
I expect that frequently I will be delighted just to wake in the morning and walk some more. I don't expect to fail but I need to leave room for it. Many already caution me to call failure by some other name. Section Hiking, Reality Check. Flexibility. That's all fine. I'm willing to adapt and redefine my goals. Hell, I'm 65. I've been doing that my whole life. But I really want this. I want to finish...to be a finisher. I want the whole 6 months out of time, out of my life.  I think I have to focus on that...gotta ""see it to be it"" and all.
And though I know that the project is ultimately pointless, maybe self-indulgent bullshit even, I need to set that aside. The challenge is entirely artificial in as much as it is unnecessary. Not that I know everything or have ""it all"" figured out, but I'm not likely to receive any real revelations about life the universe and everything or any great insights into myself. Probably won't change my life. A capstone then? A distraction? A long pause.
Just being gone would be enough. 6 months of different. 6 months of simple. Meandering. Do you (I) need reason for everything? Just go.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Fri",0
Huck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647127,"We've had 3 above zero nights in a row. Spring has sprung. There is still a shit ton of snow--in fact, I was on the roof shoveling off the damned stuff last night--but the sun is warm now and the (snow)worm is turning. I have always liked winter. It was my first winter here that really sold me. It was a cold one, too. I camped out at -42--a record I am happy to say I have not exceeded. I guess I don't really like extreme cold anymore. Any temp below zero seems unnecessary and undesirable. Actually, what is really cool about the extreme cold is that it completely resets your thermostat. After a bout of -30 even normal cold temps, like 10 degrees, feels pretty mild. Still, I'd rather not ski if it's below 15 degrees--I mean, I will, but...

The nice thing about really cold weather, say below 15 degrees, is that you can dress for it then get used to it. -30 is tolerable with the right clothing. 100 degrees and humid is just awful. You can't take off enough clothes to make it tolerable. 
I may experience all of this on the Appalachian trail. Well, not -30 and probably not 15 even. I'm leaving on March 27. Surely in Georgia even in the mountains it will be spring. We're not talking snow capped peaks. The Smokies are Smoky not snowy. Yet, there may be snow and the worst kind of damp cold. One damp thing after another. Wet stuff. Hypothermia weather. I guess I'm prepared--especially mentally. I expect bad weather. ""No rain, no pain, no Maine."" I believe it and expect it. But I have enough experience with travel in awful weather that I normally do not seek it out!
They say you ""pack your fears."" I have over two pounds of rain equipment: poncho, rain coat, rain pants, rain fly, pack cover. I should dump something...but what? Each item is pretty light. I guess the rain pants and the pack cover. Poncho takes care of both of those. The poncho was too expensive to leave behind--it's a genuine Gatewood Cape named after Grandma Gatewood who hiked the trail in her 60's back in the 50's with only a rain cape made of a shower curtain and a pack made from a feed bag. It's pretty cool and light and made to set up as a shelter, too. Rain coat was expensive, too and doubles as a jacket. Maybe I'll start with the lot and loose things as I see what I use. 
I know it will be cold for a month or so, but I'm more worried about the heat. I don't like heat and humidity. Man, the mid-Atlantic states will be hellish. Well I remember summers in Maryland. Hopefully the humidity will be less in the mountains. Even the heat on the Superior Hiking Trail was hard to take. Maybe I'll get used to it.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Mon",0
Huck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647174,"Just after the equinox, I leave the far north of MInnesota for the deep south of Georgia. On the 27th of July, I will join the rest on the Appalachian Trail.

You can use that map to see just how the crowd streams north. As you forward thru the dates you’ll see the red blob surge north and thing rapidly. Legend says many hikers quit on the first day. Three or four days later when we reach the first civilization at Neel’s Gap, a bunch more leave and toss their shoes into a tree there. Only a forth of the hikers reach Mt. Katahdin in Maine and a fourth quit in the first week. 
Check out this next graphic to see the start date data. March is the month for NOBO (North Bound) starts. Before and after the numbers dwindle rapidly–too cold in the south and not enough time to get to Maine before freeze up respectively.

So far, my day has fewer than 50 starters. Look how popular April Fools day is. I considered trying to get out ahead of this bubble by starting early in March but I’ve heard that the weather is demoralizing. I considered starting in the middle, at Harper's Ferry, and heading south since the bubble thins out so fast and soon. I decided I’d soon still be hiking through a NOBO crowd of many people each day and meeting them at shelters. People hike SOBO from Maine but they can’t start till June usually–snow you know. Also, the northern portion is the hardest and Maine black flies are notorious so not many attempt this option.",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Huck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647268,"So, I took a picture of my stuff…it's a thing. Then other hikers and busy bodies critique it–”you don’t need all that underwear” “ don’t need a raincoat, just get wet” “Whoa, two pairs of socks..” Then they brag about how low their own “base weight” is: 2 lbs, 12 lbs, 18 lbs. It would be easier to take them seriously if they used metric. Kilogram just sounds more solid, has more mass though they’re less weighty.  
Low base weight is desirable–that’s how much your stuff weighs without consumables like water and food. There’s only so much you can do to reduce the weight of your 5,000 calories of food each day and nothing you can do about the weight of water short of carrying it in your belly. You can reduce base weight by leaving stuff out or by getting lighter (more expensive) gear. People do both. 

Uncle Paul met some hikers with low base weight in the 100 mile wilderness in Maine. He said they had “nothing” and were dressed in rags. I’m too old to go all Grandma Gatewood (look it up) so I’m not leaving that much behind. I put in shorts instead of extra pants. I may leave my cold weather layers. I think I’ll leave the pack cover and rain pants–I have a poncho.  I bought some light weight stuff: tent is 2 lbs, pack is 2 lbs–there is lighter stuff for like twice what I paid. I got a good lightweight backup battery. I bought a really light chair. That’s a pound right there but I think it is a necessary mass. I think I’m at 25 pounds. 6 days of food is 12 pounds. A liter of water is 2. I’ll be starting with 40 pounds. I wish it was less. But then, not long ago I weighed 40 pounds more.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Wed",0

It can't possibly go well for the people of Ukraine, but I hope a larger war will not begin.
