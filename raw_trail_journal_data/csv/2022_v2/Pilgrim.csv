I got to Caratunk at 12:30 and went to the Sterling Inn and Picked up my resupply. I realized I had shipped way too much food… 
I had a microwave burger and a pint of ice cream which I am sure slowed me down but the ice cream was delicious!


I crossed the river on the canoe ferry and slowly made my way to Pierce pond.


When I reached Harrison’s camp at Pierce Pond I was able to get Tim to ship some of the food on to Stratton. This was an awesome blessing because my pack was way too heavy.


Spent time with Tim at his camp and listened to music played on the piano by a Dutch hiker and then by Tim.


I got blister’s on both heels today - probably because I was rushing.

I started the day with breakfast at Harrison‘s Camp. On the trail around 8:15 AM. The trail was actually lovely, basically a gentle uphill,  it was humid and warming into the 80’s. My legs were very tired from the two prior days and it became obvious that I was not going to have a lot of energy today…


At around 1:00 PM I stopped at Arnold’s point beach to take a rest, cool my feet and get some water. Unfortunately, I discovered that my steripen batteries were dead and when I replaced the batteries with new ones the steripen did not work. I filled my water bottles and hiked on. I met another hiker who allowed me to use his filter to process my 2 quarts of water. This was a good short term solution, however, it would not work long-term. I made the decision to go to Kingfield to get a water filter and a good night sleep in a hostle.


At 4:00 PM I reached Long Falls Dam Road; no cell service trying hitch a ride to Kingfield...
Around 4:45 “John” a local contractor gave me a ride to Kingfield! What a blessing.
Stayed at the Terrapin Hostel and got a pizza for dinner at the local market.

I drank a lot of water last night and my body kept most of it. The pizza improved my mood! 😊
Today I will search for a water filter and let my body recover from pushing too hard the last three days.
For fear of giving TMI… my body is in good shape from the waist up. I have some chafing from hiking in wet clothes, my left knee and and ankle seem to be ok and my feet are tender and I have blisters which are more of a nuisance than a problem. I’m sure I got dehydrated yesterday and my body needs some rest. 
I’m glad to be dry and resting today.
I found a ride to the Walmart in Farmington and picked up a Sawyer Squeeze water filter! So the water problem is solved!

I got a much needed shower, washed my clothes, got my resupply (food and clothes) and felt so much better.


Several of us piled into the Cadillac and made a trip to Walmart for food for dinner and lunch tomorrow. Dinner was a Caesar salad, Nathan’s hot dogs, and a couple of Heineken’s.

I packed up and on the trail at 6:30 using my headlamp for about 30 minutes.


I experienced minimal leg pain as I hiked the first hour. Thus, I made good time and spent time in prayer thanking God for bringing me this far and asking for wisdom in making wise decisions regarding transportation back to Memphis.


Around 9:30 I connected with Cindy, a shuttle driver, as I hiked and she was able to get me to Albany, NY to catch a 5:00 flight to Memphis.
I reached Williamstown at 11:00 and did a road walk into town - no luck hitching. I stopped at a Subway and got a snack for the flights at the Dollar General.


The road walk made me aware that I made the best decision to get off the trail to allow my leg to heal.
Cindy got me to the Albany airport early and I spent time making some final notes and reflected on my hike.
I looked in the mirror and realized I looked like a homeless person; hat crooked, dirty clothes, filthy shoes and hair wild and unkept! LOL!
I’m looking forward to getting back on the trail with a healed leg, a little more trail savvy, but confident that I have what it takes to complete the Appalachian Trail.

We were on the trail at 6:20 AM and it was just late enough to hike without our headlamps. The walk up to McAfee Knob was easier than I remembered! And we spent about a half hour, enjoying the views, taking pictures, and being buffeted by the strong winds.


We stopped for lunch and enjoyed the stupendous views from Tinker Cliffs! The day just continued to get more and more beautiful. A cloudless sky, with warm temperatures and a steady breeze. It felt like a spring day!


We met Rob “All Kinds” who is a section hiker from Asheville, NC at Lambert’s Meadow and we hiked together for the rest of the day and enjoyed a beer when we reached the trailhead at 5:00.


It was a long day of hiking but a very productive one as well. We got a shower (thanks Rob) at the Super8 and dinner at Pancho’s Mexican restaurant in Daleville.
We returned to the Troutville town park where we organized our gear for another hike tomorrow.","Catawba, VA

Today’s hike included a stretch paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway.


We passed Rob “All Kinds” on the trail, and we hope to see him again.


Shortly after that, we met the “Hiking Hens” a group of women who hike together each week. They were all from the general area and one of them graduated two years behind me from high school! I didn’t know her however, we had many mutual acquaintances.



The skies were overcast for the most of the day, and the sun finally peaked out about 12:30 PM. We took our time and enjoyed a leisurely hike. I saw some flowers blooming for the first time Mountain Laurel, Daffodils and some other dainty white flower, that I did not recognize.
I crossed the railroad tracks, just a head of a Norfolk Southern freight train. Even hikers have to stop for trains.
Completed today’s hike at 2:30 PM.


All in all a very good day on the trail! By the way, I did some math and realized that I have now completed 58% of the Appalachian Trail.","Troutville

I slept very well overnight and enjoyed, listening to the rain patter on the roof of the car. We reached the trailhead at Harveys knob and we were on the trail at 7:30 AM.

The temperature was in the upper 40s with a light breeze, and the rain had stopped as we began our hike.
The rain stayed away all day and the sun even peeked out toward noon. We made excellent progress today and reached Jennings Creek at 12:30 PM.
Vic and I decided to do an additional 4 miles in the afternoon since we had made such good time during the first part of the day. I dropped Vic off at Sunset Field and drove to Thunder Ridge where I parked the car. 


I met a man (Richard) at the Thunder Ridge overlook. He said he was planning on hiking the AT but he had Arthritis in his back and other health problems. I prayed for him regarding his back and and other health issues. He was very appreciative and I encouraged him regarding his desire to hike the trail. At 2:09 PM I began my hike toward Vic and Sunset Field. I made good time and Vic picked me up right as I arrived and we called it a day!


The most interesting feature we passed today was the guillotine. Featured in the picture with this post.
 I also realized that I had hiked this section of the trail close to 50 years ago while I was still in high school!
We drove to Daleville and had fried rice dinners at Yo Mian Chinese restaurant in Daleville.


My brother and his family is hosting us Thursday and Friday nights since the weather is going to be very wet through Friday night.","Harvey’s Knob
