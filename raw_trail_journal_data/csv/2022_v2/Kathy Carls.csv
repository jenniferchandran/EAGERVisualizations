Welcome to the AT. 🤣 Hiked to Jarrard Gap and chatted with two nice trail maintainers. The hike up Blood Mountain was literally a pain in my ass.  Something in my lower back was not happy. Vitamin I saved the day and we made it to the top. Some limping may have been involved. Met Matt, another Tilak hat wearer at Blood Mountain Shelter. Also met a nice day hiker on spring break from Atlanta.  We took each others pictures and we told him he should go see Helton Creek Falls. The climb off of Blood Mountain was much better than the climb up. We made it to Neel Gap and decided to head to Blairsville for birthday dinner and a break for whatever is ailing me. Also to avoid more lovely weather. 🙄 We were advised to hitch a ride and decided why not. There's a first time for everything. Matt joined us and guess who picked us up? The day hiker from Atlanta! The trail will provide. I wish I had a picture of him. There is a learning curve to this journey. Booked a room at Seasons Inn Motel. It is very hiker friendly and the owners couldn't be any nicer. Ate dinner at Lucky's Cantina and called it a night.","Dockery Lake Trail split

We started out in chilly, foggy weather but ended up with a glorious 70 degree sunny day. Trail magic was rampant today. Thank you to Bonnie for the cookies and orange coffee cake,the pack whisperer at Mountain Crossings for the adjustment (you changed my life) and to King Tut and his crew at Tesnatee Gap for the well placed lunch spread and white blaze hat. These amazing trail angels give just for the sake of giving. #loveahiker We hiked 11.5 miles to Low Gap. Twenty percent of thru hikers quit at Neel Gap; these ascents are no joke. We are starting to leapfrog a few of the same hikers. (Bebop and Crazy Cop) The young kids blow by us like we are standing still and we never see them again. We had Mountain House Lasagna, Uncrustables PBJ and split a Kit Kat for dinner. Set up camp, hung our bear bag directly over the AT and got in a little hammock time before hiker midnight. (Sundown) I am blessed to be sharing this journey with my best friend. I do however deeply envy his ability to sleep. I have been awake for hours waiting for the sun to come up.                                                                                                  Everywhere is within walking distance, if you have time.","Neel Gap

Hunkered down in the shelter with Jay, Rebecca,  Mr. Clean, Crazy Cop... Chicken teriyaki and mocha helped us warm up while we waited for a break in the rain. Finally pitched the tent and hung the bear bag. I'm pretty sure that bears are the least of our worries tonight. They are smart enough to not be out in this weather.

Thank you, Yonder and Plato for the hot dogs, snacks. drinks and oranges. Met Kayla and Douglas and saw Harry again. Hiked to a beautiful stream/waterfall above Unicoi Gap. Smacked my head into a tree and got a wet foot videoing the stream. Note to self, watch where your head is going, not just your feet. Hiked to Rocky Mountain Visa; met Prophet and saw Rebecca and Mr. Clean again. Dried our tent while enjoying the view. Recorded my first fall on the way to Indian Grave Gap. Mud and wet rocks are my kryptonite. No harm, no foul. We continued on to The Cheese Factory site and took a snack break there. Hiked to Tray Mountain Shelter and set up camp. Cooked Knorr chicken rice with added chicken and sat with Mr. Clean and Rebecca for dinner. Made hotel reservations from a cold, blustery mountain top with spotty cell service.  It was a total cluster; we accidentally booked through a third party that stated our call had been transferred to them. Making the reservation was comically time consuming. Disclaimers, respell your name... Plus the rooms cost Jay and us more than they should have.  Be careful if you Google Hiawassee Holiday Inn. It sounds like this is a common occurrence.  I hate paying the stupid tax. The wind howled all night and temperatures were in the 30's. Are we having fun yet?

We departed on a mission to catch our shuttle with Glenn and Jay at Dick's Creek Gap. Hiked to Deep Gap Shelter and had to go downhill off trail for water. Ate lunch on a log by the spring with Mark and Jay. Glenn continued on another tenth of a mile to the shelter.  He said it was really nice. We will take his word for it. Hard pass for us; we were not adding any mileage to our day at this point. Saw Douglas and Kayla hiking in when we headed out. Glenn called Grace (Hitch A Hiker) for a shuttle to Hiawassee. Make your calls from Powell Mountain, there is no service in Dick's Creek Gap.  Mark and I took the side trail to Powell Mountain Vista. Mark loaned Glenn his trekking poles for the last long descent into the gap.  We arrived with time to spare and had a snack at the picnic table. Caught our shuttle,  checked in and went to McDonald's for dinner due to other restaurants being closed on Sunday night. A big window sign in McDonald's fell and hit me in the head. Thankfully Jay was quick enough to slow it down. Here's your sign, don't eat that junk. Met Jason while waiting to do laundry. I was short a quarter and he nicely gave me one. I later ended up with two of his socks. Luckily I was able to find him and return them. Double check your washers and dryers so you don't leave expensive stragglers behind.","Tray Mountain Shelter

I managed to trip over a root and record fall #2 before even leaving the gap. Took a lunch break near Plumorchard Shelter and continued on to the GA/NC border. It felt amazing to be crossing our first state line on the AT. We took a break in Bly Gap to get water and have a snack. The old twisted tree in the Gap is reported to be the most photographed tree on the AT. The hike out of the Gap was intense but we were rewarded with breathtaking views at the top. I bestowed my first trail name and Rebecca is now Rainbow Brite. 🌈 We beat the rain to Muskrat Creek,  set up camp, had dinner and hung the bear bag.

All of the rain we endured  rewarded us with beautiful mountain streams and waterfalls. We hiked into a signed bear sanctuary. There are signs all over in Carter Gap warning about bears stealing food bags. We hiked down the hill for water, pitched our tent and crashed Jay's campsite for dinner.

Hiked with Mark and Jay through Betty Creek Gap and Mooney Gap. We saw Crazy Cop, Mr. Clean and Rainbow Brite. Three young men we have been leap frogging got back on trail from Franklin and gave us some halos. Yummy, fresh fruit!  A lot of people are getting off in Franklin to get new shoes. The rock scramble to Albert Mountain Fire Tower was crazy. Saw Mr. Clean, Rainbow Brite and Crazy Cop at the tower. It is amazing that we keep seeing some of the same hikers over and over. I got pretty far ahead of Mark and Jay on the way to Long Branch Shelter. Luckily I chatted with Crazy Cop and then another hiker who were taking lunch breaks. This enabled Mark to catch up to me just before a guy carry a huge spear hiked up behind me. Disconcerting to say the least.  We got to Long Branch early and decided to hike on to avoid incoming rain/snow.  Pushed on to Rock Gap Shelter turn off and called to looks for rooms and a shuttle to Franklin. We found rooms at the Sapphire Inn but no shuttles. We were contemplating a cold, miserable night at Rock Gap when a section hiker from GA came down the trail. He gave us a ride to our hotel. The trail really does provide. We checked in and then had dinner at MI Casa with Jay. An amazing amount of food and coke was consumed.  Thankful for a hot shower and a comfy bed.","Carter Gap
