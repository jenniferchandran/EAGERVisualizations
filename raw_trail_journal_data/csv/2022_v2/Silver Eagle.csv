Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651523,"When Judy and I decided last fall that we would return to the trail this year, I was not overly concerned with preparing for the adventure.  After all, I had 500+ miles under my belt and all my gear, so I felt confident the planning would be a matter of picking a start date, loading the backpack, arranging for pup-care during my absence, and hitting the trail.

That attitude was a cross between naivety and arrogance and didn’t account for my indecision about whether to go with lightweight gear or my tendency to over commit my time.  
It was after the new year when I decided to make a to-do list, which evolved into lists, which evolved into multiple lists with sub-lists.  It seemed I replaced every item that was completed with two or three more new items.  And here I am, the night before heading to Marion to meet Judy, trying to set up this trail journal.  I'm exhausted before I even take one step on the trail.",,View Entry,"May 21, Sat",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651552,"Good morning!  Today is a travel day.  I will meet up with Judy in Marion and, together, we will do a shake down to try to lower our backpack weights.  I’m hovering at the 30-pound mark, and I would prefer it to be at the 26 or 27-pound mark.  It’s amazing to think our necessities can be reduced to under 30 pounds.  I am thankful that it is my choice to live out of a backpack and that I can decide when I want to return to the comforts of a real bed, daily shower, and a TV.  Not everyone has that luxury.God is good!!",,View Entry,"May 22, Sun",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651609,"I wrapped up a visit with two of my grandboys this morning, having already seen my other grandson two days ago and my granddaughter a week ago.  Seeing them and, more specifically getting their big bear hugs, was a perfect send off.  Nothing in the world compares to hugs from the grands.  It is my hope that, one day, one of my grandbabies will take a backpacking trip with me.  Time will tell.
Until then, I will continue to chip away, section by section, at reaching the ultimate goal of completing the AT, and tomorrow will be the start of the VA to WV section.  I met up with Judy today in Marion, she arrived 15 min before I did.  After a late lunch, we started the shake down--eliminating unnecessary weight from our backpacks.  Success!! We each managed to reduce our backpack weights, though at the cost of removing some comfort items, i.e. a pillow (lightweight blow up pillow).
The shake down is one more thing to check off the to-do list.  We still have more items to check off the list tomorrow before hitting the trail.  What absolutely needs to get done, will.
Before closing this entry, I want to thank all of my amazing family and friends who responded to my fb announcement about our adventure.  Your prayers and messages of encouragement and support mean the world to us both. ",,View Entry,"May 22, Sun",0

Our first stop will be the post office.  We each prepared a box of food and various items, e.g. bug spray and TP, to send to ourselves at a hostel where we plan to stay 100 miles up trail.  
After the post office stop, we will drive to Atkins, where we will park our cars at the home of a former AT thru hiker-turned shuttle driver/car custodian/trail angel and now friend, Rambunny (AKA Carol). From there, Carol will shuttle us to the trailhead, where we will officially start our journey.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651869,"Well... things didn't go quite according to plan.  Our trip to the Post Office apparently threw a wrench in Rambunny's (our shuttle driver) schedule, and instead of getting to the trailhead mid morning, we arrived after noon, only to realize i left my trekking poles in my car, which was now parked at Rambunny's property,  15 min away.  Upon returning to the trailhead after retrieving my trekking poles, Judy greeted me with a suggestion to consider sheltering here due to the late start and based on reports of slippery, rocky, terrain up trail from hours of steady rain.  As much as I wanted to start hiking, I reluctantly conceded, and we spent the.night at the shelter.  It was a good decision. The steady rain turned into a marathon downpour, lasting the afternoon and through the night, finally subsiding around 3 am.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651870,"We left the shelter at 8 am, figuring we could take our time and enjoy this section, given it was only 7 miles.  
We took our time, for sure--10.5 hours--to go 7 miles!!!  Never in my wildest imagination did I think it would take that long, but soon after we started, we were met with an intense vertical climb on a trail that was nothing but rocks, and we knew that, if the terrain continued this way, we were in for a long, tough day.  It continued.  A 7-mile torture trail.
Complicating matters, and further delaying our progress were: the rocks were slippery from the previous night's rain, equipment adjustments, crossing 3 rushing streams (fed by the rains), snack/lunch/breath breaks, and photo ops.
Yes, juxtaposed against the harsh, punishing terrain were the soft, vibrantly colored rhododendrons, honeysuckle, magnolias and lush green ferns of the forest.  No one can convince me that this wasn't a gift from God, to remind us that we may have to go through rough terrain to see the beauty on the other side.  Once his non techie person figures out how to attach photos, I will post them. 
The shelter was finally in sight, as was a raging ""stream.""  As i stood at the bank, trying to decide which rocks to hop, I see a hiker approaching.  I offered to let him go by.  He said, no, I'm here to help you cross.  
Are you kidding me???  I was so grateful for his outstretched hand.  He and his buddy were more than gentlemen,  they were our trail angels, even helping us hang our bear bags (no easy task) and refilling our water bags for us.  Thank you Stallspeed and Sky King.  I regret not getting your pics for this post, but hope you know how much Judy and I appreciated all your help.  Best of luck in reaching Katahdin!!!","Partnership Shelter

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651871,"After a good sleep, we enjoyed a leisurely breakfast with our shelter mates, Sky King and Stallspeed, and the sole tenter, Bearsnack.
I had first met Bearsnack at the previous shelter and immediately recognized her German accent.  I greeted her and introduced myself in German, and she graciously  engaged with me until we reverted to English, due to my limited conversational German skills. Coincidentally,  Bearsnack's true name is Sonja, the same name as the woman who is helping me improve my German via weekly phone chats.  Vielen Dank an beide Sonjas fuer eure Hilfe!
Clearly, one of the many joys of being on the AT is the people you meet--its a special community of people, some of whom become lifelong friends.
Breakfast done, we packed up and hit the trail.  After yesterday's experience,  we were expecting more of the same rocky, wet terrain as the previous 7 miles but were pleasantly surprised with the smooth trails with only mild ascents and descents.  We crossed several more streams, which I gratefully accepted as a minor annoyance, and were on our way to significantly improving our pace.  That is, until Judy's face had a close encounter with the ground.  Falling is not uncommon on the AT or any other trail for that matter.  Even on what appears to be the smoothest path, a root could be hiding under leaves, a rock could blend in with the dirt, or your trekking pole could catch on a vine.  Any of these could catch a hiker off guard and bring him or her down in an instant.  Many times, it's a matter of picking up,  brushing off, and continuing unscathed.  Unfortunately,  that wasn't the case for Judy.  She injured her finger/hand and was in significant enough pain for her to decide to seek medical attention.
Rambunny to the rescue!  She met us at a road crossing and drove us to the hotel,  where I stayed, then she dropped Judy off at the hospital.  
Several hours later, Judy returned to the hotel with a neatly taped fractured pinky.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652345,"Soon after starting our day's hike, it became apparent to Judy that she was in for a slow, painful journey. Perhaps some residual effects of her recent fall: perhaps a pulled muscle from trudging through the slippery, muddy trail.   Regardless of its origin, her pain was, at times, immobilizing.  It was clear, we would need to shorten our distance goal.  We exited the trail at a road crossing, where Judy arranged to be driven three  miles to the Bear Garden Hostel:  i was grateful that she had taken my tent with her in order to spread it out, rinse it off, and hang it out to dry, since i opted to hike to the hostel, rather than ride with her.  Of course, i had no clue the winds would pick up, and the skies would open to dump more rain on my already drenched gear, midway to the hostel.  After climbing a few wet stiles and a close call with a falling branch, I reached the hostel, where a shower and warm bunk house did wonders to improve my mood.  A clothesline at the hostel, a little sunshine and strong wind gusts helped to dry things out before it was time to leave again the next morning.  ","Reed Campsite

I hiked on.  Ten hours, and 11.4 miles later, I reached Chestnut Knob Shelter, a beautiful cabin-like structure atop the mountain with grand views of the valley below.  It was a struggle to get there.  The elevation, terrain,  and sparse water sources drained every ounce of energy from me. I was really dragging the last two miles.  With a half mile still to go, I was parched and completely out of water.  At that moment, along comes ""Walmart,"" whom I met at the Bear Garden Hostel, and he gave me his last drop of water, which was just enough to carry me the rest of the way.   God heard the groanings of my spirit and provided!!

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652349,"I woke up to a beautiful sunrise.  It made me think of the song ""Nobody Loves Me Like You Do""  by Chris Tomlin:  ""Morning. I see you in the sunrise every morning.  Its like a picture that you've painted for me.  Love letter in the sky...""  
How can i manage to be awake early enough to see the beautiful morning sky and still be among the last to leave camp. As hard as i try, i cannot seem to do everything i need to do in under two hours.  I was not overly concerned, though.  I was still leaving earlier than yesterday, and the distance to the next shelter was a little shorter than yesterday's trek.
My confidence quickly waned when only a few miles into my hike I realized I had not seen a white blaze, the marker that tells hikers they are still on the AT, for quite awhile.  Sure enough, I went off track.  45 minutes later, after a total 1 mile detour, I was back on track, only to learn that the downhill stretches, where i normally can pick up my pace, were basically rock scrambles.  Unless one is part mountain goat, the best and safest approach to the rock scrambles is slow. My trekking poles guaranteed a slow speed, as they kept getting caught in the rocks.  I was glad to get through the scrambles without breaking an ankle.
A road crossing at the bottom of one descent offered a great rock on which to rest.  Waiting there were gallons of bottled water that a very kind soul left for hikers.  It was nice to replenish my supply without having to take the time to filter it, and even nicer that I knew it would  carry me to the next shelter.  During my short break,  other hikers came down off the mountain.  We chatted and before hiking on,  ""Doin' it"" gave me an exuberant pep talk, convinced she would see me at the shelter before nightfall.
I rolled into camp at 9 pm, to the welcoming cheer of ""Doin' it"" and a relieved look and greeting from Stallspeed.  
Too exhausted to eat dinner, I spread out my sleeping bag in the shelter space that Stallspeed saved for me and promptly settled in for the night.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

I was surprised to see Half Shell and his Dog Indy in the car when i met up with Judy.  She had graciously shuttled Half Shell and his dog Indy, from the Bear Garden Hostel.  Half Shell was taking a zero day to rest an injured foot.  Later in the day, Blossom joined us after her hike, and Judy drove us all to dinner in Wytheville.

As soon as I took a step forward, I found myself on the ground; my gaiter was caught on a stump.  I had to take off my gaiter to free myself from the stump, and I had to take off my backpack in order to stand up.   Decision made--i would go under the obstacle, since i already had my backpack off. 
The rest of the journey was uneventful and, despite smothering humidity,  i was pleased to complete the 7 mi stretch in 4 hrs 15 min.
I met Judy at US 52, and we drove to the Weary Feet Hostel.  This is the place to stay, if you're really hungry!!  For a modest fee, you can buy dinner (and/or breakfast) and get enough food for an army.  It's a beautiful old farmhouse with good resupply options and a very friendly,  helpful crew.

Waiting there, with a buffet of trail magic for hikers, was ""Coffee Grounds.""  Hot breakfast--eggs,  sausage,  bacon, pancakes,  coffee, juice, fresh fruit, you name it.  I was still full from the breakfast I had gotten a few miles earlier.  I hated passing up this free gift, but hiked on by.  I later learned Coffee Grounds would be providing dinner- time trail magic at a road crossing a mile past the shelter, which was my destination for the day.  I would be lucky to make the nearly 12 mi hike to the shelter, much less the extra mile beyond.  Another missed freebie.  
The hike went well, partly due to the backpack.  I swapped my REI Flash 55 for the Gregory Jade that Judy brought for herself in case she had problems with the her own Flash 55.  Though the Gregory is  heavier, the pack felt better on my shoulders.  
I passed the 600-mile mark.  Of course, i completed the first 534 miles in 2017, when Judy and I first attempted to be thru hikers.  Not much has changed since then.  The trail will still beat you up yet leave you awestruck at the majesty of God's creation.

Did I jam it?  I had no clue--it seemed a sudden pain.  Still, the ankle seemed more of a nuisance injury--not terribly painful--just subtle reminders that it wasnt quite right when my foot was in certain positions.   The muscle pull, on the other hand, stopped me in my tracks in several of the downhill sections.  A return visit to Weary Feet Hostel seemed warranted in order to give my injury a break.  I was bummed.","Jenny knob shelter

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653075,"The next shelter was just four mi away.  That was far enough.  It was not a particularly difficult four mi, but i managed to take a big spill.  It was on a downward turn on gravel-like trail surface.  My pole slipped out and down i went--hard.  My water bottle escaped its plocket on my backpack and continued rolling down trail and over the side edge.  I was so concerned about retrieving my water bottle, i didnt immediately notice the painful swollen scrape on the back of my calf or the feeling like someone had just punched me in the ribs.  At least my bad ankle was spared further damage. And, I recovered my water bottle.
About .2 mi from the shelter I off loaded my backpack to follow the blue blaze down a steep hill to the water source, but I couldn't find the water.  I was not going to risk hopping the rocks on a bad ankle to find it, trusting that i was carrying enough to get me through the night and morning and to the next source that was 2.5 miles after the nearby shelter.  
I was greeted at the shelter by the fierce sounding barks of a skittish dog that was pretending to be mean.  The dog's owner, Tish, introduced the pup as Remy.  Remy greeted all guests the same and, ultimately,  welcomed all with a snuggle. Tish made the same offer to all who came-- Grommet, Square Pie, and Just Rick--that she would put Remy on a leash if anyone objected to his overly friendly mannerisms.  No one objected; hence, Remy had full reign- no one's food was safe from his nose, no one's sleeping pad was safe from his paws, no one's trip to the privy was unaccompanied, and no one's sleep was uninterrupted by the furry, four legged shelter mascot.  I woke up in the middle of the night to Remy's nose in my hair.  I must have startled him when I shot straight up with a rather loud ""What's that"" because he ended up curling up with Just Rick for the night.   
Tish slept through it all. ","Pine Swamp Shelter

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653076,"Morning reminded me of the previous day's fall.  A large bruise was forming on my calf, and my ribs ached with every cough, hiccup, burp or stretch.  I felt like I had been hit by a truck.  Thank goodness for Ibuprofen. 
I was glad I left camp early, because it took me three hours to go the first 2.5 mi.  I was slow to navigate the  solid rocky trail, and  there were a couple of spots where the trail seemed to disappear, only to reappear on the other side of a major obstacle.  I took a quick break by the spring and refilled my water bottles before continuing.  Expecting more of the same rocky terrain,  i was pleasantly surprised to find that the trail smoothed out, allowing me to pick up my pace.  I stopped for a break at the cross road and chatted with Tortoise,  then again .3 mi later at the overlook where one could see into both VA and WV; the trail straddled both states for quite a long stretch.
It felt good to finally get to the War Spur Shelter. And even nicer that a plentiful supply of wTer was actually nearby and easily accessible.   The shelter area was probably one of the nicest for tenters so far, with a lot of level, root-free space to set up, and many tenters took advantage of that space.  I was alone in the shelter. At around 9:30 pm. I was awakened by flashes of heat lightening. Then I heard the distant thunder, and soon, the deluge.  I was glad to be dry in the shelter, and i was glad the tenters who debated whether to set up their rain flies, did.  Despite the loud rumbles and pounding rain, I was able to settle in and fall asleep.  Then at about 12:30 a.m. a crowd of hikers and their two dogs rushed under the cover of the shelter.  With no predictions for rain, they started their night hike with the thought of experiencing a peaceful trek led by the light of a full moon. After consolidating my things and scooting over, six of the hikers and one dog were able to cram into the shelter built for six; one hiker had to pitch a tent for her and her dog.  It could not have been five minutes after the group settled in before a huge sonic boom-like crack shook the shelter.  There was a collective gasp, even from the tenters. 
It continued to pour throughout the night.  I thought about my bear bag hanging in a tree about 50 yards away--would it even still be hanging when I get up in a few hours.  It was.","Bailey Gap Shelter

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653487,"I returned home last week to recover.  It was a bittersweet homecoming.   While I knew that I could not continue hiking and actually looked forward yo seeing my family again, leaving the trail, even if only temporarily, feels like an insurmountable setback.  Time will tell if I am able to return this year, but in the interim,  life goes on.  There are birthdays to celebrate,  grandkids to love on, yard work to do (after healing), and memories to make. While reflecting on this, as well as on my previous AT experience,  I am grateful for the lessons I have learned and share them now as a sort of afterword to this account of my brief AT adventure,  and as a reminder to me that there is purpose in everything:
1.  All ridgelines are not created equal.  Some are open and filled with amazing overlooks, some are buried in the shadows of the forest.  Just enjoy the level hike.
2.  There is beauty everywhere on the trail--sometimes you have to look a little harder to find it.
3.  Trail magic doesn't always have to be a banquet in a parking lot.   It could be the person who gives you his last drop of water, someone who gives up his shelter space for you, or someone who hangs your bear bag when it's too dark to see.  Be someone 's trail magic.
4.  Expect the unexpected.  
5.  Not reaching your goal does not mean you failed. Maybe you need to reset your goals.
6.  Regardless of your conditioning or training, it is nearly impossible to undertake such a physically and mentally demanding challenge without the support of family, friends, and fellow hikers past and present.  To all those who have rooted Judy and me on--thank you!!  You have no idea what a huge role you all played in making our return to the AT a reality.  
7.  God is good--all the time!!
So, with this,  I close this chapter of my trail journal.  Will there be a sequel?  Stay tuned!  ","
