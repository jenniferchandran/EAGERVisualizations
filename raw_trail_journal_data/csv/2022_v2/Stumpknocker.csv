Hello everyone. This is Stumpknocker and it is December 19, 2021. This will be my first pre-hike entry for my thru hike of 2022. 


Where do I begin? 


On March 3, 2002 I started my first thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. On March 3, 2022 I am starting my 20th anniversary thru hike the Appalachian Trail.


In 2002 I ask myself what in the world have I gotten myself into….or what am I about to get myself into was the real question. It seems I haven’t learned a thing in the last 20 years because I am again asking myself what am I about to get myself into? 


A lot of things have changed since my first hike of the Appalachian Trail. My mom and dad dropped me off at Amicalola Falls State Park in 2002. My mom passed away in 2006 and my dad passed away in 2009. 


I started my first journal and enjoyed posting entries mostly because my mother enjoyed reading about what I was up to. That was a huge motivator for me to post my journal as often as possible.


I didn’t enjoy journaling nearly as much after mom passed on. Each year I would have some friends urge me to journal my new adventures. I did for a few years, but I haven’t journaled a whole lot in the last 10 to 12 years. 


I wasn’t going to journal in 2022, but the more I thought about it the more fun I thought it might be to journal and compare this year to the days of my journal 20 years ago. 
Times have changed also. My mother made me carry a cell phone even though I had been living on my own for 30 years and had raised two children. She was worried that something might happen to me and I wouldn’t be able to get in touch with anybody. Back then the only thing you could do with a cell phone was make a phone call. I ended up sending the cell phone home from New York state I believe.


It seemed strange as I was reading my journal from 2002. I got into Helen, Georgia and wrote about walking to the library to use the Internet to check my email. 


I also used a gadget called a pocket mail. It was a device that I could type my daily journal into and when I got to the next town I could use a payphone to dial an 800 number and hold the pocket mail device up to the receiver. It would send my journal entry to my transcriber as an email who then would post it to Trail journals.


I also carried Wingfoot‘s guidebook. I carried maps of the trail. I carried a pocket recorder to remember names and thoughts of the day. And I carried the previously mentioned pocket mail to type my journal out. I carried single use film cameras because the phone didn’t have that capability either. 
I’m thinking it will be fun reflecting on how the trail has changed in just 20 years. I remember how upset some people would get if they saw a hiker with an electronic device like a cell phone. Now it would be hard to find someone without a phone. 


I’m also hoping that this will be the only serious entry that I make. 


I’m really hoping to have fun with the rest of this journal and the trail in 2022. 


I haven’t journaled in a long time, so it may take me a while to get my thoughts gathered and put into print. 


OK, I’m done with the serious stuff. My final reason for doing this 2022 thru hike is because I will be 69 years old when I start and I’m nearing my physical peak in life. I understand that after a person reaches their peak physical condition everything gets harder in the future. I want to do this trail before it gets hard. :-)

Comprehensive gear review and a great big thank you for all the well wishes!


All righty.  I have been bombarded with well wishes and questions about what gear I’ll be carrying since I posted my Pre-Hike #1 entry. 


Well, bombarded may be too strong a word to describe the well wishes and questions about my gear. I’ve had quite a few people who have signed my guestbook and seemed genuinely interested. 


Okay, okay. I’ve had one person who seems fairly happy that I’ll be journaling, but there were no well wishes and no questions….yet. 


I may do a gear entry if I get at least one request. Anyone?",,View Entry,"Dec 20, Mon",0
Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646175,"I’m getting very excited about this thru hike that’s quickly approaching. Only 64 days and I’ll be walking north on the Appalachian Trail!


I’ve been busy getting ready, but not for the AT. Two hiking friends and I have been doing a Suwannee River canoe paddle in January for about four years now. I’ve been busy getting ready for that.  


Chief and Xmas know the Suwannee River. Well, Xmas knows the Suwannee River. Chief does a good job of finding rocks to run into.  Xmas always seems to get the old boy through. 


We will start the Suwannee River at Fargo, Georgia on January 3rd, 2022 and paddle a couple hundred miles to the Gulf of Mexico. 


I’ve been paddling on the Suwannee River several times a year since Xmas first introduced me to long distance paddling. 


My third time this year was in June. That’s when I captured the Gulf Sturgeon in the picture above. 


I’ll be gone for a few weeks, but I will get a gear entry for my AT hike posted here when I get back.",,View Entry,"Dec 29, Wed",0
Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646388,"Back from the Suwannee River Trip!Finished up with Chief’s, Xmas’s and my annual January paddle on the Suwannee River. This year we spent a couple weeks and only paddled 115 miles. The boys wanted to camp more than paddle. I didn’t mind a bit. 
I got home three days ago and am now concentrating mainly on my long walk coming up. Can’t believe it’s only 44 days until that will be my life for about six months. 
My plan is to lose 20 lbs before March 3rd. A person can spend hundreds of dollars to save ounces on gear. I’ll save hundreds by the food I won’t be consuming. It's Tuesday afternoon and I’m 48 hours into my first fast. My plan is to fast once a week for somewhere between 48 hours and 2 minutes to 62 hours and 13 minutes until the start of the trail. When I’m not fasting, I’ll be eating just one meal a day, usually lunch. This is actually my favorite way of eating, but I have been bad and eating like I’ve been hiking already. No limit to eating once I’m on trail. :)The second part of my plan is to seriously start putting in some walking miles. Today was a 6.5 mile start. My hill work will have to be on my treadmill and will probably be twice a week. Four days a week will be 10 to 15 miles with one rest day. Can you tell I’m serious about this? Well, as serious as I can be.
I’m still planning on doing my gear entry. I’m just waiting on the delivery of three pieces of gear for changes I’m making. That entry will go up when those items are delivered to me. I’m also detoxing after spending the last two weeks paddling on the Suwannee River with the bourbon boys. They were a bad influence on me! :)",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Tue",0
Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646433,"Scooby-Doo would say “ruh roh”.  I think I’m in trouble!I started my hill workout today. Now remember, I live in west central Florida. There’s just not a lot of mountains here to get in my hill work. The closest thing to a hill is the bridge to Clearwater Beach. That’s where I headed today. My thoughts were that it wasn’t going to do much for me. I changed my mind on the third climb. It was harder than I thought it would be. I’ve watched a few YouTube videos of people hiking the Appalachian Trail in my spare time over the last few years. I always laughed when someone would talk about a mountain being ""straight up“.Well, that bridge was “straight up“ for my fourth, fifth and sixth climbs. I have no idea how the cars can make that steep climb   Ended up being a 5.2 mile walk. I was feeling pretty good about my accomplishment. Thinking maybe 1,000 feet of elevation gain in all six climbs. Still feeling good about all the elevation gain when I got home, then I checked my tracking app Strava. It said I climbed 405 feet total. Ruh roh. I’ve got some work to do in the next 40 days. :)Two more pieces of gear coming Monday, then I’ll work on getting my gear entry posted. I’m sure Chief has been on pins and needles waiting to see what’s in my pack. Gotta say that I’m really enjoying hearing from friends that I haven’t heard from in a while. Thank you all for signing my guestbook! I’m answering each guestbook entry as quickly as possible.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Fri",0
Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646536,"This entry will have a link below to the winter gear list I'm taking with me. It took me a while to weigh everything and list each item. Looks like my winter base weight will be about 15 to 16 lbs. I know I'll be comfortable with this gear in the winter weather the southern Appalachians will throw at me. I will drop about 3 to 4 lbs of that weight when I change out to summer gear. (I did add a rain kilt from Lightheart Gear that's not on the list yet)
My normal winter weight with food and water is about 26 lbs when I leave town. That should be the same for this walk from the looks of the gear in my list.
https://lighterpack.com/r/wp6w...
I think I will keep this entry short. Any questions about the gear listed can be asked in the guestbook and I will do my best to answer there or in my next entry.
My original thought for training was to walk to the park each day. I walked the beach bridge one day and realized I needed to focus on the elevation change. I have been walking the bridge every day and plan on about six days a week. The last two days were in the rain and it was FUN!!! :)  I would never complain about rain that makes the springs run nicely like those 2003 hikers. They had it soooo nice, yet they still complain every time I see one of them.
I will be taking a short 5 or 6 day break in a week.  My ol' buddy Chief misses me and wants to paddle the northern section of the Suwannee River again before I start my long walk. 
Time is flying by! Only 36 days from today until I'll be sleeping in my tent for the first night of my thru hike.
Still hearing from old friends in my guestbook and some new friends. Always love the comments. Thank you kindly.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Wed",0
Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646715,"Today is pretty exciting for me.  It will be exactly 4 weeks (28 days) until I start walking 2,200 miles to Katahdin.
It's been a couple months now since I decided to do this 20th anniversary hike.  I get more excited each day.
I am putting off another adventure that I REALLY want to do; bicycling the Great Divide Mountain Bicycle route from the border with Canada to the border with Mexico.
I've never really had any interest in the PCT, but that has changed in the last couple years.  I'm hoping to do that in maybe 2024 and the Great Divide in 2023.
I have to keep doing these things while I'm still young enough.:)
Thanks again to everyone (except Chief) who has signed my guestbook.  I really enjoy hearing from old friends (except Chief) and new friends.  I've been trying to answer everyone (even Chief) in the guestbook.  That seems to be something new that Leif has added to Trail Journals.
Just 28 days until I walk north out of Amicalola Falls in north Georgia. Only 26 days until I leave home for about six months. I love new adventures!!!",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Thu",0

Time is moving so fast, yet not quite fast enough. Can't wait to get back to trail life. There's nothing better for me.
I don't have much to add since my last entry a week ago. Got a primary doctor visit done. Thought I would have my taxes done, but still don't have all my documents. Those seem to come later each year.  May have to do an extension for the first time. Not something I'm going to worry about now. I'm still bridge walking each day. Becoming quite familiar with an Osprey that I see fishing each morning. He eats better than I do. Fresh seafood each day. I watch pelicans diving for food.  Usually fairly close to where I see porpoises feeding.
Chief and Xmas seem to be at least as excited as I am about this walk. They are taking me to the trail and going to make sure I don't get lost for the first week. They will leave once they feel comfortable in my abilities. Chief seems to think their work will last at least until I get to NC. 
I met Chief at the end of my first full day on the trail back in 2002. (It was the end of his second full day on the trail)  He's been telling me everything I've been doing wrong since.  :)
Josh and Leigh have no idea how lucky they are that they sold their hostel a few years back. They would if they knew Chief and Xmas were back in the area.
I'm going to my guestbook next to see who signed it since last week. I'll answer them and look forward to anyone else who signs it this week. I really enjoy that personal interaction on my journal. Keeps it fun!
I will be back next week for another pre-hike update in which I really don't have much to say. See you when I have 14 days left to the long walk. :)",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Thu",0
Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646977,"Hard to believe that I will be on Springer Mountain in just 12 short days from now.  What have I done, or better, what am I about to do? :)
I seem to remember saying something similar back in the beginning of my long walk in 2002. I will have to check and maybe update from the trail. Hope to be doing a lot of comparisons between this walk and my walk 20 years ago.
Still walking at least six days a week over the Clearwater Beach bridge. Just checked my mileage and am just ten miles short of 200 miles on that bridge. 
The good thing is that I'll be in shape to walk a bridge when I start my thru hike. The bad thing is that those are mountains on the trail and not a paved bridge. I know that bridge will seem easy when I think back on it after hitting the trail. Well, that's the best mountain I could come up with in Florida. :)


My backpack and all my gear has been sitting untouched on a bed for over a week. I probably should at least look at it again and see if I have everything. 
I have a nephew who went winter backpacking in the Smokies because his most coolest uncle (Stumpknocker) has done that before. He got to a shelter in freezing weather and unloaded his pack only to discover he had forgotten to pack his sleeping bag. He had a long night keeping the fire stoked before walking back out the next day. I love that story and what my nephew was able to learn from it. :)
I leave home in ten days, unless you read this tomorrow. Then I'll be leaving home in just nine days. :)

I delivered a daily newspaper to the above theater 63 years ago on my bicycle route. 
Probably do one more pre-hike update before I actually start walking the trail. (Maybe two more)",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Sat",0

My thru hike begins tomorrow morning. (March 3rd) Yippee! :)
The photo above was taken exactly 20 years ago. I look pretty much the same as I did then. :)  I’ll post a recent picture when I post tomorrow’s entry.
Hard to believe that I’m lucky enough to be back for a 20th anniversary walk. 
Chief, Xmas and I drove up from Albany, Georgia today after a huge send off breakfast made by Alice. It only took about four hours to get here. 
They are going to make sure I’m pointed in the right direction tomorrow and maybe when they can find me at road crossings. They’re gonna hang around the area and spread their expertise to any hiker that will listen to them. Can’t imagine why one would. I’ll probably be seeing them off and on for the next five or six days.
I went ahead and signed in today, weighed my pack, and even got a bag tag. 
The walk will start tomorrow morning at the visitor’s center at Amicalola Falls. I’ll get to walk the 600+ steps first and enjoy the falls to start this trip. Then I’ll walk the approach trail to Springer Mountain and hopefully a little more before setting up my tent for the first time on this walk.  
My next entry will be an official one with actual walking miles listed. No more pre-hike entries. I’ve met two other thru hikers starting in the morning. I’ll get better with names on the trail.Time for the fun to begin! :)",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Wed",0

It’s the exact same day as my first thru hike 20 years ago. The photo above is me starting from the arch at Amicalola Falls State Park today. Look back one journal entry to see my starting photo from 20 years ago. I don’t see much difference. :)The biggest difference between the two years is the weather. It was cold in 2002. Got down to 8 degrees my first night. Today was very mild. I walked in shorts and a short sleeve shirt all day. It got up into the 70s. Chief was kind enough to take me down the hill from the lodge to let me walk back up the hill to the lodge. He didn’t even complain too much because he knew he was driving back to the lodge. I walked easy and really enjoyed the falls. It only took me 45 minutes to get to the top. Chief and Xmas had just pulled into the parking area. We went back to the lodge for breakfast. There were seven other thru hikers there, so we all sat together at one table. Xmas and I sat at the end, but ol’ Chief sat in the middle so he could better spread his knowledge of the AT. ;)Yoda, Timber, Luke, Minn, Crow, Lisa are the only names I can remember. That was enjoyable, but everyone was anxious to get their walk started. We all headed out. The 1st four above and I did the approach trail. The others started on Springer, so I didn’t see them again. Chief was anxious to drive up to Springer parking and wait on me. I did my part by making him wait until nearly 3pm. That darn approach trail wasn’t nearly as easy as it was in 2002. I did end up going over a mile farther this time. I was way more tired though. I made it to Springer and signed the guestbook. Took a few pictures and enjoyed being on the Appalachian Trail again. I spread some of my wife’s ashes at certain spots along the trail in 2002. It’s time for the rest of her ashes to go back to the earth, so I’m gonna spread her ashes in the same places 20 years later. She’s on Springer again. She would be happy. I walked down to the parking area and got water and some food from Chief and Xmas. Rested a while, then walked another half mile to the first flat spot I found and set up my tent. It’s gonna take me a few weeks to get back into decent walking shape. I think I saw about 20 thru hikers today. I’m gonna write the names of the ones I can remember. Yoda, Timber, Shoe, David from Texas, Ian, Luke, Minn, Press and  Blacklight. I’ll get better with names. It was fun getting to talk to everyone. I even met a mother and son who turned around on the approach trail. They said they needed to lose a bunch of weight from their packs before trying again. I wish them luck when they restart. I love walking this time of year because the views are always with me. Laying in my tent at the end of my first day with no cell service. That’s hard to beat! :)Oh yeah, my tag number is 737.  I’ve never had a bag tag before. That’s a good number. It means I’m going to fly up the trail. Pack weight was 25 lbs and even that feels heavy right now. I’m getting soft. :)  My pack was 41 lbs in 2002. I’d need a floor jack to get that much weight on my back now. Sent from my iPhoneSent from my iPhone","Springer Mountain

I really do love sleeping in my tent. Ate some breakfast and enjoyed my cold coffee. It’s strange because I love my pour over dark roast coffee at home, but I really enjoy my Mount Hagen freeze dried coffee cold on the trail. I actually look forward to it. Packed up and walking at 6:56. Wearing just shorts and a short sleeve shirt. Very mild out. Started enjoying a brilliant orange sun coming up over the mountains not long after I started walking. The sun was lighting up the mountain tops. Met a sobo named Tao who was just today finishing up his thru hike. A hiker asked if I was a sobo just before Long Creek Falls. I said no Rugaroo, who is a hiker I met when I signed in. You’re walking south for some reason. It took a minute for it to sink in, but he said he must have turned wrong after the falls. I headed down to the falls and enjoyed my first break of the day. They are flowing beautifully!The army rangers were out in full force with machine gun fire. This area is their training ground. Passed Lisa and Marcie, then talked to a ridge runner named Tom just before Hawk Mountain Shelter. Stopped along the trail and refilled my water. I ran into Crow shortly after Hightower Gap. She said to me that she was beginning to hate gaps. Maybe because you almost always have to climb out of them. :)I had cell service at the top of the climb, so I called my support team. I thought fried chicken sounded nice, but they were having a Dairy Queen malted milkshake and said they were in a dry county and had to figure out what to do about their low bourbon supply. Some support team. Their boy passed through 3 gaps with roads today and not a support team in sight. Oh well, they are only supporting me for another four days or so. Hope I get to see them before they are done helping me out. ;)Ran into Trail Madge on my way down to Horse Gap. He has a walking staff with a 3” glass globe on top. He said it forces him to go slow.
I ran into Tonya at Horse Gap. She’s hiking with a tiny little poodle dog. Moose Liver and Mustang Sally were camped at Cooper Gap and offered me some water. I happily took it so I would have water tonight without going to Justice Creek. That worked out great because it seemed that camping area was going to be busy.

Then a couple owls serenaded me shortly after dark. A nice way to go to sleep. I started walking at 6:55 this morning. Once again I was wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt. It’s hard to believe how mild it is here this week. The sunrise through the trees was spectacular. It wasn’t long and I got to Jenkins Creek. It looked fairly busy at the camp site. I said hello to Tonya and Roman as I walked by. They were the only ones out of their tents. I asked a couple hikers leaving Gooch Mountain Shelter if Mother Nature and Smokestack was there. They weren’t, so I kept walking. It’s great being able to see all the mountains through the leafless trees. One of my favorite times to walk in the mountains. There was a guy making sandwiches for a few hikers when I walked through Gooch Gap. I thought about stopping, but I knew Chief and Xmas would be waiting impatiently for me at Woody Gap. :)Alex, Max, Max, and Garrett were at Ramrock Mountain when I got there. They are four younger hikers that are all friends and started together. I took a short break there. Fantastic views! I walked on knowing the boys were waiting on me. I followed a couple with a YouTube channel before I left. I got to meet them just as I got to Woody Gap. That was fun meeting the couple called “Hiking With Whiskers”. It was busy at Woody Gap, so I hopped into Chief’s truck and we headed for Blood Mountain Cabins. We will be there for 3 days while I slackpack to Unicoi Gap. Then I’ll do an overnight to Dick’s Creek Gap, spend the night, and see the boys off to their wives. I’ll be on my own after that. Should make my hike easier not having to take care of those two. Carleen and Alice appreciate it when I can keep the boys busy and away from home, but I can only do so much for them. :)

I packed for the day, made a sandwich and brewed a pot of Black Rifle coffee. That’s the first hot coffee I’ve had since Amicalola Falls and it was good! :)Chief drove me from Blood Mountain Cabin to Woody Gap. I started my first climb at 7:35am. There were a few people coming down from Preachers Rock that had gone up for sunrise. Beautiful views from there with quite a few clouds below me. I only saw one other person between there and Lance Creek. She was a trail runner. There were times of fairly thick fog which always makes the woods so mysterious looking. I like that a lot!I walked uphill to Jarrard Gap and talked briefly to Larry. I try to make sure that I scan the distant mountains while I’m walking. They are a pleasure to see through the leafless trees. There were also song birds singing and I always enjoy listening to them. Music to my ears. I saw Lisa sitting on a log about half a mile before Woods Hole Shelter. I was ready for a break, so I sat down and talked to her a few minutes. She said Marcie had skipped ahead and planned to come back another time to hike this area. She also said Crow and Tonya were ahead on the trail. I walked on passing the shelter without stopping. Got to the spring at the beginning of the climb up Blood Mountain. Figured I had enough water, so I started climbing the mountain. I soon caught Crow and Shawn. Shawn was complaining about being too old for this walking stuff. He's only 65. :)Next I saw Happy Hippie and Whiskers slacking sobo to Woody Gap. We briefly talked, but they still had a long way to go. I kept climbing to the top. Saw a few people and Tonya there by Blood Mountain Shelter. I climbed the big rock with plans of having my sandwich while enjoying the view. The wind was blowing and it was too cool to sit up there long, so I ended up eating my sandwich inside the old stone shelter. I didn’t hang around long as more people started showing up. It’s a popular place for day hikers coming up from Neel Gap. Probably passed 30 people walking up the mountain while I was going down. Chief and Xmas were waiting on me at Mountain Crossings. Today was a fun walk. Slackpacking helped. :)The boys were great trail support today. They may learn how to properly take care of Ol’ Stumpy yet.

It was probably in the 50s and clear, but that didn’t last long. I walked through the Mountain Crossing building, signed the register and used one of my smiley face stickers. :)There was an 800 foot climb to start with. I was in heavy fog and fairly windy conditions by the time I got to Bull Gap. Glad I took a couple pictures of Blood Mountain before climbing into the fog. I kept walking to top out at Levelland Mountain. It seemed like it was raining with the wind blowing the drips off the trees. I was getting pretty wet and would have put on my raincoat if I didn’t have Chief waiting on me. I kept walking hoping to beat the rain coming in. Two miles later I walked over the top of Wolf Laurel Top. I do enjoy walking in the fog. It makes me feel like I’m in my own little world. I ran into three day hikers right at Cowrock Mountain. They were the only people I saw on the trail today. Chief tried calling a couple times, but I think the heavy fog and wind was messing with cell service. The phone finally connected just before I got to Testnatee Gap. Chief and Xmas was parked there. I took a short break then climbed the always tough climb north of there.  That mile took me nearly 40 minutes. I also got rained on lightly twice on the way up. Saw the first of the year daffodils blooming on top of Wildcat Mountain. I got to Hog Pen Gap and was tired from nonstop moving to beat the rain. The hot shower when I got back to the cabin was nice. Sent from my iPhone","Neel Gap, GA

Today started off at 7:30 am when Chief dropped me off at Hog Pen Gap. It was so foggy that you couldn’t see more than 30 or 40 yards. I thanked the Ol’ Chief and started walking north. Passed by two tents within 300 yards. It became clear in about 10 minutes and I could see all the mountains around me and heavy fog in the valleys. That’s one of my favorite views when I’m above the fog and can see mountain tops pushing through. Beautiful!The sunrise over the tops of the mountains was a thin sliver, but added to the morning scenery. I had walked a few miles before I saw the first hikers. Stopped and briefly talked to Red Beard, Mud and their dog Scout. It was 37 degrees when I started walking and never got out of the 40s. I still walked in my shorts, but wore a long sleeve shirt and was very comfortable. Passed by Low Gap Shelter without stopping. Shortly after I got to a small waterfall that had a perfect seat on a fallen tree. Took my first break of the day and enjoyed the sound of water falling down the mountain. I came around a corner on the trail and saw a guy peeing. I yelled to him that I caught him. :)That was Shawn, a guy I met climbing Blood Mountain a couple days ago. Next I met Beth. A young girl walking to Maine. Then I saw Owen taking a break. Another guy I met a couple days ago. My plan had been to eat my sandwich at Chattahoochee Gap, but the wind made it too chilly to stop there. I found a nice rock to sit on a little while later that was out of the wind. There was a very rocky trail that lasted maybe a mile, then I got to Blue Mountain Shelter. Took a short break and walked on. I passed T-wizz, Terrapin and a 3rd hiker that I can’t remember his name. We talked a few minutes before I walked on. It sprinkled rain a few times as I walked down the mountain to Unicoi Gap. I ran into two hikers I had met early on in this walk. Ian and Roman. I could see the parking area at Unicoi Gap, but I didn’t see Chief. He was helping another hiker out and showed up 30 minutes and 27 seconds later. :)My longest day of this thru hike and I was still done by 2pm. Very grateful to be walking this trail again. Sent from my iPhone","Hog Pen Gap

Saturday is supposed to be about 10 to 15 degrees which I could handle fine. The problem is that there is high winds predicted, so the wind chill would be bad, but I’m also afraid of falling trees. Back to today’s zero. Today is Wednesday. I really didn’t want to take two zeros this weekend due to weather, so I’ll take a zero today, walk two days to Dick’s Creek Gap and one more zero on Saturday. I should be good to go after that. Spent the day in Helen, GA. We ate at Big Daddy’s. I wasn’t real hungry, so I ordered 10 chicken wings. Those wings  were the best I’ve had in a long time. It ended up being a really fun night. Chief, Xmas, Luke, Min, Crow, Owen, Beth, Shawn and myself.

These dang hills are harder than I remember. I thought of Sheryl Crow’s song that went something like this: Nobody said it would be easy, but nobody said it would be this hard. :)I climbed and climbed and finally got to the summit. Whew!I descended the thousand feet I had just gained down to Indian Grave Gap, then had a 1,300 climb up Trey Mountain. That didn’t seem as hard for some reason. I met Cado and Medicine Man on that climb. Medicine Man came walking back to me and asked if I had seen his glasses. I had missed stepping on them somehow. I looked up when he came back and missed crushing his glasses somehow. His lucky day! Got to the summit of Trey Mountain. There was lots of fog and nice closed in views. I like the long distance views better when the days are clear, but I also like the foggy views like today. I walked down to the shelter and ate lunch. Met Will and another hiker, then Luke and Min walked in. It was cold here with the wind blowing through. We talked a little, I signed the register, then walked on. There was water streaming off the side of the mountain. I collected enough for tonight. I absolutely love the taste of mountain water. I’ll usually dump town water when I find mountain water. The walking got easier. Passed by Steeltrap Gap, then took a sit down break at Swag of the Blueridge. I was getting tired and ready to stop. Thought about stopping at Sassafras Gap which had nice flat ground. I decided to go to Addis Gap. There were about 10 people there. I should have stayed one gap back where there wasn’t anyone. I like people, but I like sleeping alone in the woods better. I found a nearly flat tent site and set up my tent. I crawled in, stretched, moaned and ate my dinner. I got out later long enough to stand around a fire for a while. It was cool enough that I headed to my quilt for the night. I heard some coyotes when I laid down. Then a deer blew a few times. And then I was listening to an owl as I fell asleep.

That helps eliminate condensation normally, but fog must have been blowing through last night because everything was damp. I had coffee and hard boiled eggs before getting out of my quilt. It started getting light as I packed up. I left camp in shorts and a short sleeve shirt because the climb up Kelly Knob was staring at me. Glad I did because I still worked up a little sweat on that steep climb. Probably the hardest climb in Georgia for me. I was thrilled when I got to the summit. That gave my legs time to recover while I descended to Deep Gap. I noticed a few small birds beginning to show up. Really looking forward to hearing the lonely songs of the brown thrasher. I could lay in bed all morning listening to those buggers. I did hear the first male grouse making his drumming sounds today. Next was a climb up Powell Mountain, then the long descent to Dick’s Creek Gap where Chief and Xmas were waiting for me. I will zero tomorrow and let this cold front go through.

I walked a short distance to the tree she had made it to and spread some of her ashes. This is a very special part of the trail to me. I walked on and passed Crow. Kept walking and got passed by Cado and Medicine Man. There was a dusting of snow from last night. I discarded my old worn out shoes and am sporting a brand new pair of white road running shoes. I believe I’m one of the few that wear Mizuno shoes on the trail. I heard some crows nearby and a blue jay in the distance. There was one woodpecker and that was it for the day. There was a pretty good climb out of Cowart Gap that took me to Buzzard Gap. I stopped briefly at Plumorchard Gap for a picture of the sign to the shelter. That shelter was my first overnight on the trail. It’s also where I met a lifelong friend by the name of Hippie Longstockings. Next was another good climb up to As Knob, then down to Blue Ridge Gap. I walked up and down a few more hills before getting to the Georgia/North Carolina border. I took a selfie because no one else was around. I’m done with Georgia! I enjoyed Georgia. Stopped at the spring just before Bly Gap for water. It was busy at Bly Gap.

I used toe warmers and even they were toasty. :)Morning light was getting close, so I had coffee, two hard boiled eggs and some powdered donuts. A fine trail breakfast!I was one of the first out of camp. There were probably a dozen tents. A bit too crowded for me, but a good group of people. I walked over to the knarly tree where I had left some of my wife’s ashes 20 years ago. I spread more ashes this morning. Put my pack on and headed for the first climb of the day. A real doozy up Sharp Top Mountain. A fitting name.  It’s the steepest climb so far on the trail and one of the steepest on the entire trail. I huffed and puffed up that bugger. It was so much easier 20 years ago. :)Got that done and the trail leveled out for a short time, then up another doozy almost as steep. Glad to have those hills behind me! Next was down to Sassafras Gap. That gave my legs some rest. On the next climb a few hikers passed me, but I didn’t get their names. Just a group of young girls climbing so easily that they made me look bad. :)I stopped at Muskrat Creek Shelter and ate an early lunch. Signed the guestbook and left a smiley face sticker. There were  reports of a feral cat living at the shelter, but I didn’t see it. Medicine Man stopped briefly to see if his daughter was there. He shakes his head every time he sees me because he can’t believe anyone would wear shorts in this cold weather. It takes a lot for my legs to feel cold. The trail leveled out for a few welcome miles. I passed by my favorite named side trail; Chunky Gal Trail. I believe that name came from Indians in the area a while back. How can anyone not like a trail named Chunky Gal?Next was Water Oak Stamp where Luke and Min passed me. They get to camp earlier and leave later than me. Just two more young hikers out here making me look bad. :)Had another climb, then down to Deep Gap where I started climbing Standing Indian Mountain. I got real close to the shelter and saw a nice spot to set up my tent. I wanted a quieter night, and this will do just fine. Ate dinner leaning on a tree looking into a bright sun. It was really warm until the wind started blowing. The wind blew quite a bit, but it was still a very enjoyable afternoon propped up against that tree. In my tent for the night with no cell service.

I only had a few ounces of water, so no cold coffee while I was in my tent. Got packed up and started walking at daylight. I passed by Standing Indian Shelter within a quarter mile and got water. Another quarter mile and I found a nice seat along the trail and had my cold coffee. I love cold coffee on the trail. :)I had about a 1 1/2 mile climb up Standing Indian Mountain. It’s graded nicely, so not a bad climb. A heavy fog had rolled in by the time I summited. No long range views, but I’m always happy with the short range views. Next up was about 4.5 miles of gentle downhill. How could anyone complain about that. It was so easy walking that I actually started getting chilled. I sat down for a break and my fingers were so cold that I had a hard time unbuckling my pack. I turned this stop into an early lunch. A very peaceful lunch with no one passing. Got down to Coleman Gap, then walked up an easy one mile hill to Carter Gap Shelter. I basically just stopped to add one of my smiley face stickers to the shelter register. Parker was there and a guy came walking in just as I was putting on my pack. I recognized him as soon as I got out of the shelter. He said “Stumpknocker!”Took me a second to remember his name, but it came to me fairly quickly. Bushwhacker. I met him in 2006. I actually met his wife first. We were the only two having breakfast at the lodge at Amicalola. She said her husband had left for his thru hike the day before. She had spent an extra day at the lodge. I had just started a thru hike. Left the arch and stopped for breakfast before climbing up to Springer Mountain. Well, I caught up to Bushwacker the next day. We started talking and I mentioned having breakfast with a good looking girl. I’ll never forget the look on Bushwacker’s face when I mentioned his wife’s name. It was priceless! :)We’ve been friends since, although we don’t run into each other very often. I said goodbye after getting a picture of the two of us. There was a mile long hill to climb, then down towards Betty Gap. It’s supposed to rain tonight, so I wasn’t looking forward to the gap being possibly really wet in the morning.

It started slowly, but got fairly heavy and rained all the way to near 11am. That’s when I got out of my tent. Yes, I’m a sissy. :)Was packed and walking at 11:21am to a fine mist. This was a day of short steps. The trail gets so muddy and slick that if you stretch your steps out your foot can slide and a person that can’t do a split, does a split. Not long after I started walking was an area where a hiker slid off the side of the trail. You could see his slide in the mud and all the leaves cleared where he went down the hill.  I got to Betty’s Creek Gap and saw the slide victim sitting on a log. His side was all muddy and his spirits were worse. Started a 2.4 mile climb to the summit of Albert Mountain. An old fire tower is still there. The views are usually fantastic, but today’s view was maybe 30 yards because of dense fog. This also marks 100 trail miles done on the AT. Woohoo! Only have to do that 21 more times to become a 2022 thru hiker. I met a family of four that are thru hiking. The children I believe are 8 and 10. Kids do better out here than most adults. They hike all day, then they play when they get to camp. All I can do is set up my tent, crawl in moaning, eat dinner and go to sleep. I actually like that way too tired feeling. :)My plan was to get near Rock Gap today. That was another 5.5 miles beyond Albert Mountain. I took a short break and Crow walked up. She heard that the large family named the Crawfords were at Rock Gap Parking area serving food to hikers. The food sounded great, but meeting the Crawfords meant more to me. I hotfooted it to Rock Gap. Still taking short steps of course. The mud, you know. I got there and the Crawfords were there! A family of eight who did a fine thru hike in 2018. Their hike, with all the obstacles and six children are the most impressive AT hike I know of. I have a hard time just taking care of myself on the trail. The food was delicious! The conversation was great. Thank you so much Crawfords!Rainier, who was 2 years old during the hike tried teaching me how to play rocks, scissors, paper. I think he actually rolled his eyes at me because I couldn’t figure the game out. :)Sunset drove up while I was standing there. He’s half of Chica and Sunset’s Hostel.

A squirrel even popped his head out. I’ve heard squirrels, but this guy was the first to let me see him. Their was a hiker’s parents cooking hotdogs at Winding Stair Gap. I had two hotdogs and an apple and we talked about 45 minutes. It was already noon when we decided to head to town. I’m used to hitching rides to and from trailheads. Crow is not. This was her first hitch ever. I made a statement that we should have a ride in 5 to 10 minutes. We did!A photo journalist who had spent the night shooting a movie gave us a ride.

Chainsaw and Drifter, 2004 thru hikers. They did an overnight. Chainsaw remembered me from 2004. I kind of remember his name. My plan was to start slow and taper. I’m getting pretty good at that. :)I will probably start increasing my mileage in about a week. This slow start has been good for me. My legs haven’t felt any lactic acid for three days now. I did feel some each of the first 13 days. The hills are getting easier!Passed by Panther Gap. Another name I like out here. Next was crossing near Siler’s Bald. That was the high point for the first part of the day. It started raining and some cloud thunder. Not the kind that strikes all around you and scares the heck out of you. I put on my rain coat, rain kilt and rain mits because it was chilly with the wind. The kilt worked great. I overheat it rain pants when I’m climbing mountains. The kilt keeps me just cool enough. The rain jacket is fairly new from Lightheart Gear. My guess is that it needs seam sealed. It leaked. Never even thought about having to seam seal a rain coat. Guess I should have, but oh well. I’ll be at NOC in two days and will pick up some seam sealer there and take care of that little problem. Next was a long decent to Wayah Gap, where I crossed a paved road and started a fairly steep climb.I climbed in the rain until I got near the high point of this hill that’s over 5,000 feet high. My planned day was in this area. I saw a trail sign for the junction with the Bartram Trail, looked right at saw a flat spot that had a sign that read: Reserved for Stumpknocker. Okay, no sign, but it’s my home for the night. Set up my tent, crawled in, took my wet clothes off and put some dry clothes on. It’s chilly when it’s 40 degrees and windy and you’re wet. Those wet hiking clothes are going to be fun getting into in the morning. 8-)It ended up being a nice day for a walk.

Oh yeah, iced coffee that really was iced coffee. :)Also heard some coyotes right at dawn. They were pretty far off, but I still enjoyed listening to them. Took down my tent and packed up after the sun was up. My fingers were numb by the time I was all packed, so I even had to wear gloves this morning. The wind kept blowing. Walked along a ridge for a mile, then descended to Tellico Gap. Met Will who was hunkered down by a wall and was boiling water for more hot coffee. It was funny because he was completely bundled up and really looked cold…and there I was in shorts. :)The next climb kept me warm. It was up the hill to Wesser Tower. That’s a platform tower that has spectacular views every way you look. I thought Pamela would like some of her ashes spread there. They blew away from the high winds on the tower. Beautiful spot for her. Climbed down and walked the sometimes narrow ridge for over a mile before the steep downhill started. It’s times like this that I’m so thankful for my hiking poles. I’ve been extremely lucky not having knee problems and I think using my poles to take a lot of my weight on the downhills is why. Downhills pound your knees and this is a very steep downhill for the first mile or so. Passed by Spoonbaby and Emily and got passed by a fast hiker. My original plan was to pull up short of NOC and get one of their motel rooms. A guy wrote that it was $60.00 just 5 days ago. They went up for Spring? They quoted me $154.00. I was going to get something in the restaurant, but it was buffet only today and that was $40.00. I have food in my pack to eat. I’d have paid the $40.00 if they would have had seafood too, but no seafood. Oh well, I did get some seam sealer from the outfitter for my Lightheart Gear rain coat. I’ll seam seal that when I’m in Robbinsville at a motel for half what NOC wanted. I’m hoping that motel will keep me out of Wednesday’s cold rain. Yes, I’m getting softer in my old age. :)It took me an hour to warm up after walking in the cold rain two days ago. I left NOC figuring that the first flat spot would be home for the night.

Watch out when the sun went down. It started blowing a steady 15mph and gusting to at least 30mph. It wasn’t real cold, but the wind made it feel really cold. I think it was in the 30s. My tent was facing into the wind. Had I thought it was going to be windy, I would have set it up facing away from the wind and all would have been okay. The wind was blowing right through my down quilt. I reached under the tent and pulled out the Tyvek ground sheet and blocked the wind with that. Then I stuck my feet that were in the quilt footbox into my empty backpack. All was fine then except for the noise of the wind blowing. This is the tenth time I’ve climbed up Cheoah. Nine times I said someday I want to sleep up there. That’s another thing marked off my list. Very memorable night. :)I ate breakfast before daylight and had two cold coffees. Was really looking forward to sunrise. It was very nice, but not as spectacular as I hoped.   Adrianne, Sticky Buns and five early risers that walked a mile from the shelter were waiting on the sunrise.   Packed up and walking by 8am. Started off with my heavy coat, but quickly took that off and was comfortable walking in my shorts and a long sleeved shirt. I walked down the steep hill to Lucust Grove Gap, then on to Simp Gap. There’s some steep stuff in this area!Got to Stecoah Gap and Sticky Bun’s father was there with some food for the hikers. We talked a while. He walked the trail last year and his name is Bouncer. I know Sticky Buns was looking forward to seeing him today. I hitched a ride into Robbinsville, NC. A lady in a pickup truck took me right to the motel. I’ll be here two nights. Got thunderstorms coming in tomorrow and this old man could use a nap. :)First things first in town. No, I’ll shower and wash my clothes later. I walked 4/10ths of a mile to Ingles for food. Came back to the room and had four bbq chicken quarters, some chips and a quart of milk. My intentions were to shower and wash my clothes. I fell asleep. That’s my first nap in a month and it was a good one. I woke up groggy. Nothing like a good nap to restore the body. The shower and washing the clothes in the shower were next. I’m clean and clothes are hanging in the room drying. Next was seam sealing my rain coat. That sounds silly, but it leaked bad in the cold rain a few days ago. Next was to fix the front tie down string on my tent. Six Moons Design makes a good tent, but they only used a thin ribbon instead of grograin on the one line that takes the most stress. The ribbon broke a few days ago. I made do by just staking the bottom of the door, but I couldn’t adjust the tent for the proper pitch that way. I opened the tent and the front guy line was gone. It was blowing so hard this morning that my tent was trying to sail away on top of Cheoah. The line must have decided to stay somewhere on Cheoah. I cut a small slice at the dome of the tent and brought the exterior loop through, then seam sealed the dome. Tomorrow I will make a new front tie down. Really looking forward to my zero tomorrow!Sent from my iPhone","Cheoah Bald, NC

I woke up at 5am, pushed the start button on the electric coffee making machine and got back in bed. I had to get up again five minutes later and pour myself a cup of hot coffee. Got back in bed and repeated that rigorous activity four more times. :)I did walk outside and was glad to not be in the rain that was coming down. I looked over my rain coat and resealed any places that I missed yesterday. Then I put more sealer on the stress point of my tent.Got out of bed about noon and powdered down the seam sealer on the rain coat and tent. Then took the side wall guy line off the tent and made a new door guy line. That’s the one guy line that basically holds up the whole tent. Remembered how to tie a Prussic knot and added that to the new guy line to adjust the door. All my gear is in good shape again. That’s a great feeling when you have to depend on that stuff to make your life easier on the trail. Nap time! Good one, but not as good as yesterday’s nap. :)The CPA sent my tax form to sign. Took a while, but I figured out how to do that on my phone, then sent the signed pdf back to them. Ended up being a really good zero. Got things accomplished and still rested all day. I’ve even set up my stay at the Hike Inn on Friday. They will take me to resupply for the Smokies, print out my Smokies permit and get me back on trail Saturday morning to enter the Smokies. Nancy, from the Hike Inn gave me the phone number for the PO in Fontana Village so I could have a package that was sent to me from a friend in Montana, waiting when I arrive at her place. I’ll let you know Clark Fork when I get it. Thank you in advance!
  The view above was from a few days ago on Wesser Bald. Things went really well today. I’m ready to get back to walking north tomorrow morning. Just have to hitch a ride to Stecoah Gap. Two more short days and I should be ready to start upping my mileage. Talked to my Ol' buddy Chief today and he said it was embarrassing even knowing someone who walked so few miles each day.  He’s always got encouraging words for me! :)Sent from my iPhone","Stecoah Gap, NC

Wanted to make sure I got all the coffee needed to get the day going. Also had a few hard boiled eggs. Slowly starting packing, then even took a morning shower. Don’t do that very often, but it’s nice when it’s available. :)Left the room and walked about half a mile to get to the road that goes up to Stecoah Gap. Found a spot to hitch so that a car had room to pull off. Lots of school buses going by. Finally got a ride after 20 minutes. DJ took me right to the trailhead. Thank you!Climbing the first hill by 8am. That one wasn’t too bad, but I had Jacob's Ladder coming up in another mile. I’ve heard lots of hikers say it’s straight up. It’s not straight up, but I’ll bet it’s 45 to 50 degrees in places. I got to Sweetwater Gap, then started climbing Jacob’s Ladder. It’s only about 700 feet of elevation gain, but it is steep. A person has to work at it to get to the top.   Morning view while climbing Jacob’s Ladder.  My legs must be getting used to climbing because it really wasn’t too bad a climb. Got to the Brown Fork Gap Shelter turn-off, but didn’t go down there. There were some slippery wet areas beyond the shelter. I just walked slowly and deliberately and got through the nearly half mile of slippery side hill trail. Sat down for some lunch. It was so quiet. Hadn’t seen a soul on the trail until I sat down for lunch. Summertime walk by. We talked a while. He’s 20 years old and seems to be having a fun walk. Walked by Hogback Gap and Cody Gap next.   Then a long downhill to Yellow Creek Gap. I sat down on a log and Guitarzan showed up. Last I saw him was somewhere in Georgia. He’s 22 and carrying a 50 pound pack, part of which is a full sized guitar. Another mile and another break. :)That took me to Cable Gap Shelter. It’s an older and smaller shelter. I did sign the register while sitting and talking to Guitarzan. I was ready to get off my feet, so I walked on and found a nice flat spot 1 1/2 miles further. I’m on a ridge just 5.7 miles from Fontana Visitor Center. Should work out well tomorrow. The Hike Inn will pick me up, let me print out the Smokies permit and go to town to resupply for the Smokies. I’ll walk into the Smokies on Saturday morning. I’m sleepy tonight, so I’m gonna post this journal entry and go to sleep early. I’m the only one tenting on this ridge tonight. I can see Fontana Lake from my tent. Nice! Sent from my iPhone","Stecoah Gap, NC

Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647827,"Day 235.6 miles 911 ascent 2,553 decent 17,382 steps 0 falls to date Woke up about 2am and completed today’s Wordle and Quordle games. I’ve kind of gotten hooked on these word games in the last few months. Went back to sleep and woke up when a few rays of light came into the tent. I’ve usually eaten breakfast by then, but today was going to be a short day to the Fontana Visitors Center which is right before you cross the dam. The clouds were laying low. They were compressing the sun’s rays to a slim streak across the horizon. It was still pretty, so I would eat a little, then take some pictures as the colors changed. Packed up and walking by 8am. A male grouse was drumming and a woodpecker was digging into a tree for breakfast. Those were the only sounds I heard as I was climbing a few short hills before the decent started in earnest all the way down to Fontana Lake.   I love how trees eat signs. Pretty sure I passed by Guitarzan’s tent about half way down. He told me yesterday that he was not an early starter. Kept descending and heard foot steps coming up behind me. Those young buggers walk fast. His name was Peach Fuzz. He was fast! I remember walking like that once, but not anymore. :)The trilliums were popping up in this area and a few ferns.   The first of the trilliums this year. Got to the boat ramp, looked around, then headed another mile or so to the Fontana Hilton. That’s probably the nicest shelter along the AT. Signed the register and enjoyed sitting. The views of the lake and the Smokies are beautiful from there.   Fontana Lake in the foreground and the Smokies in the background. Headed the last little bit to the visitor’s center. Tom from the Hike Inn showed up soon after. It was great meeting and talking with him. He told me their water system had just stopped working this morning. There was a well service guy there when I arrived, but no water yet. I had met Nancy many years ago, but neither of us could remember much of the details other than I came in walking south in January. Nancy knows Rambunny and Mrs Gorp really well, so we had fun talking about them. Tom ended up giving me a ride to Robbinsville, NC where I got a room at the San Ran Motel. My main reason for this day in town was to get my Smokies permit printed out and to resupply for the next seven days. Tom agreed to pick me up at 8am tomorrow and get me back to the trail. Nancy and Tom couldn’t have taken better care of me. I am so grateful for the both of them. Thank you, thank you!
Clark Fork, a friend from Montana sent a little trail magic to Fontana for me. I had it forwarded to the Hike Inn. Nancy handed it to me before Tom took me to Robbinsville, NC. I opened the parcel when I got in my room. A nice Granite Gear zippered stuff sack, two credit card sized magnifying glasses (those will be handy for these old eyes), assorted rubber bands and some pie money. Thank you kindly Clark Fork!

Picked up two sausage, eggs and cheese biscuits and a large black coffee.  Had breakfast back in the room while I was getting packed. Nancy Hoch from the Hike Inn picked me up at 8am and took me to the Fontana Visitor Center. This was the longest I’ve ever talked to her. I really enjoyed that. We got our picture together, then I started walking towards the entrance to the Smokies. Thank you Nancy and Tom for taking such good care of me!Walked across the dam, then about a mile road walk to the entrance to the park. There I dropped half my permit in the box and started climbing.   Fontana Lake. I believe today was the most elevation gain in a day so far. It wasn’t too bad even though my pack was heavier than it’s been. I’m carrying enough food to get me through the Smokies. We’ll see if I can make it past Newfound Gap without going into Gatlinburg. Today was a beautiful day with nearly full sunshine. The only bad thing was the high winds at a steady 28mph that were gusting to 47mph. It got up to 40 degrees today.  Supposed to have those winds tonight and tomorrow before they start dying down. I think it’s going to be in the low 20s up here tonight also. I didn’t go to Shukstack Firetower because of the wind. That thing is wobbly enough in much less wind. Passed by Birch Tent Site without stopping.   View from the Smokies. I met Polaris on the way up and three other nobody. Later I met a young man called 39. I kept walking. I knew I wanted to get to Mollies Ridge Shelter for the night. Passed by two more nobody taking a break. That’s all I saw on the trail today. Finally got to the shelter. I was a tired pup. There were half a dozen people here. The ridge runner showed up right when I did. Asked him if he had a problem with me tenting. He said to go ahead, so I set up my tent. I was hungry, so I crawled in and had a tortilla with butter, spinach, cheese and ham. Then I ate two apple pies, some nuts and some Fritos. I was still a little hungry, so I made a tortilla with butter on it. Dinner was delicious! :)They have bear cables here and I’m a law abiding sort, so I hung my three food bags. That means that I’ll have to get out of my warm quilt in the morning for breakfast and coffee. Pretty happy about my mileage today toting a heavy pack and climbing about 4,500 feet. Sent from my iPhone","Fontana Visitor’s Center, NC

The wind wasn’t as strong as yesterday, but was still blowing. I slept toasty last night. My coffee was actually ice coffee today. I kept the bottles close to me, so they didn’t freeze, but they were slushy. Had a lot for breakfast and two slushy coffees, then packed up. I knew today was going to be tough. I was right!There were two short, but steep climbs right off, then a descent to Big Abrams Gap. There was a 1,000 foot climb to get past Russell Field Shelter and a few miles later past Spence Field Shelter. I had to be careful because there was ice in parts of the trail.  Even needle ice because the ground had frozen.   It was 24 degrees. I can tell by the droop in the rhododendron leaves. :)Next we’re rugged climbs up Rocky Top and then Thunderhead Mountain. I had forgotten just how tough these climbs were. Very rocky and very steep. My legs were like jello when I got up too. Saw four hikers taking a rest on Rocky Top. It was out of the wind, so I ate lunch there with them. Their names were Tonya, Potato Chip, Sticky Buns and Brazil. Walked down to Beechnut Gap. I needed water, so I went about 50 yards down the hill and found a piped spring. I love these mountain fountains!Next was more rocky and steep ups and downs to Starkey Gap, then Sugartree Gap.   Just another beautiful view. :)One last climb up to Derrick Knob Shelter. I was beat when I got there. This was a tough day for me. I crawled into my tent and ate dinner. I tried eating more than usual just to try and lighten my pack some. I probably should have planned on going into Gatlinburg.

It was hard getting out of the tent because I was nice and toasty. Breakfast was served at 7:30am. Delicious tortilla with real butter, fresh baby spinach, peanut butter and honey. I know, it sounds strange, but it’s very good. My coffee was slushy again. I actually like my iced coffee cold, but not slushy. :)I started with big ambitions of making it a couple miles past Clingman’s Dome. I set my tent up 2.8 miles before the Dome. It would have been dark before I got there and I was already tired.   I’m really enjoying the views in the Smokies. There were lots of ups and downs today, but not nearly as rugged as yesterday. I came up on a hiker named Jennie. We ended up walking the rest of the way to Siler’s Bald Shelter. She stayed there for the night and I walked another 2 miles to Double Springs Shelter. 
  Just look at that sunshine that appeared later in the day!
It was still sunny, so I set up my tent and crawled in. That got me out of the wind which was gusting over 40mph again. That’s three days in a row of high winds. They don’t stop at night either.

Enjoy!Day 275.6 miles 1,741 ascent 1,411 descent 18,315 steps 0 falls to date A few hikers packed up a couple hours before sunrise. Their goal was to watch sunrise from the top of Clingman’s Dome. Don’t think they got the sunrise because it’s been cloudy and cool. The wind was blowing still when I went to bed. It kept blowing, but finally subsided sometime in the middle of the night. It was 30 degrees this morning. It’s amazing how balmy that felt after the cold we’ve had. I walked over and got my food of the bear cables. Crawled back in the tent and had coffee and breakfast. There had been quite a few tents around last night, but most were gone by the time I was ready to walk. There was 2.8 uphill miles between me and the highest point on the Appalachian Trail.   Dang, I’m lucky!
It got windier the higher I climbed. It was actually a beautiful morning. I took lots of photos and hope to pick out a few of the best to post here.   This is all I have to look forward to each day. :)
There were a couple guys climbing the structure on Clingman’s Dome. It was windy! I had to tighten my hat to keep it from blowing away.   Doesn’t look like it, but the cold wind was howling!
I got half a dozen pictures and even one selfie up top. I didn’t linger. I wanted back down in the trees and out of most of the wind. The trail became very icy. Walked carefully stepping on any aggregate that stuck through the ice and made it safely through that section.   Yep, I walked that and still no falls on this trip. :)
I turned at the trail junction towards Mt Collins Shelter. It’s half a mile off the AT and the water still farther. I counted 300 steps to the water. What else could I do? :)It was 300 steps back to the shelter after the water bottles were full. I was first here. Geanne (I asked how she spelled her name) came in half an hour later. Then Jack and Mad Hatter, then quite a few more. I set my tent up in the brightest flat spot that I could find. There was a better spot in the thick fir forest, but that was almost like dusk. Ate a large dinner, then stretched out in my tent for a short nap. :)My original plan was not to go into Gatlinburg. I carried heavy food to get me through. The weather forecast changed my mind for me. The atweather.org site has mountain weather forecasts. It’s calling for 45-55mph winds gusting to 60mph. Rain starting Wednesday night and lasting through Thursday. I’m just not going to take a chance having a tree blowing over during the day or when I’m tenting. I have a room reserved in Gatlinburg for the weather event coming through in the next couple days. I made a short day today and another tomorrow to escape the rain and 60mph winds. I also crossed the 200 mile mark on this walk. :)Sent from my iPhone","Double Springs Shelter, NC

It was good hard ground and even the tent stakes were hard to get in. The poor part was that the ground thawed overnight and was very wet and cold. Water squished this morning when I put my hands out to get up. Always learning out here. :)I ate a small breakfast, but still got down two cups of delicious cold Mount Hagen coffee. I love that stuff!Jeanne came out of the shelter packed and ready to walk just as I put on my pack. This is her last day on the trail for now. Her husband surprised her with a Camino trip in Spain for her birthday. I think it was the daily wine that convinced her to trade trails for now. :)  This is a very dangerous forecast. We are going to lose a lot of trees in the next two days. We walked together for the short five mile day to escape what is now being forecast as wind gusts up to 90mph tonight and tomorrow morning. I’m glad I made reservations in Gatlinburg.   A pleasant walk along the Appalachian Trail. It was a pleasant walk this morning. I even got two rare pictures taken of me. I usually shy away from pictures of me when there is such beautiful trail pictures to look at. Sponge Fob fell in and walked with us a while. Interesting guy. He’s from Ontario and has been a pig farmer for 40 years. He said cats look down at you, dogs look up to you and pigs look you in your eye like they’re your equal. Jack passed by. He’s the guy that’s section hiking and offered us a ride. His car has been at Newfound Gap for four days. He had heard the road was closed and was worried about getting out.   View from Newfound Gap. Mad Hatter passed us next. We got to Newfound Gap and saw the road was closed, but any cars already up there could leave. That worked out wonderfully for Jeanne, Mike and myself. Mike was on standby until we saw if there was any room left in the already packed Honda Civic. We all gladly carried our packs in our laps.   I look so serious! Pretty sure I was thinking about hamburgers. :)The gate was locked near Gatlinburg, but someone had walked to the visitor’s center and obtained the numbers to open the gate. We only waited about one minute before the gate was opened and we passed through. Talk about timing! :)We hit a traffic jam in Gatlinburg and I took the opportunity to thank everyone and I hopped out. Talk about luck? There was a Five Guys Hamburger joint right act the street. I felt full after $20.00 worth of burger and fries. I checked my phone to see where Microtel was and I was only 1/10th of a mile from there. I walked in at 1pm and the girl said check in was 3pm. I was pleasant and said I’ll just sit my smelly self and dirty pack right there in the lobby. No sooner had I sat down and she called over and said she could check me in early. :)I asked for a pair of scissors and trimmed my mustache so it didn’t drive me crazy growing over my lips. She loaned me a pair. I washed them before and after I used them. This entry will catch me up on posting pictures to a couple previous entries, posting yesterday’s entry and today’s.

Four cups today! There was also a continental breakfast which held me over until lunch. Packed up some of my gear that was airing out and headed out to walk around Gatlinburg. Wasn’t sure what or where I was going. Ended up at the NOC Outfitter where I was able to look around at everything I don’t need. There were a few hikers out front on rocking chairs, so I joined them for a while. Found out it’s illegal to hitch from town. Not sure what I’ll do about that. Maybe walk out of town and hitch. The road was still closed at that time. There were a few hikers that had their packs and was hoping the road would open. I headed to Cici’s pizza and ate lunch. Salad, pizza and drink.   Along the streets of Gatlinburg, TN. Stopped by Walgreens and got some powdered donuts for the trail and a Modela beer for later today. I’m 69 years old and I got carded. Crazy. Who makes up rules to card someone born in 1952?I got to catch up with a trail friend on the phone today. It was nice talking to Amoeba about some of the fun times we had along the trail at different times. Okay, coffee was 100 feet away, so I had two afternoon cups. What can I say? :)Took a nap. You have to have a nap on a zero day. Took me a few minutes to wake up, but when I did it was dinner time. The thought crossed my mind to go to a steak house, but that hamburger yesterday was so good that I decided to go have another. 
  I’ve had enough hamburgers for a while. Tomorrow night trail food is on menu. The streets were busy with Gatlinburg tourists doing Gatlinburg touristy things.

All I had to do was get out of my room and start walking out of town. I had a banana and a yogurt and one more cup of coffee. Checked out at 7am. It was still dark. I walked about a mile to get away from town so I could hitch a ride to the trail. Two different vehicles stopped, but they weren’t going all the way to the top. I thanked them, but my chances for a ride were pretty good where I was. About five minutes later I was in a Jeep on my way to the trailhead. I started walking north on the AT at 8:05am. It was a lot chillier up here than in town. I had my gloves, but the pull over cap and neck gaiter was packed away. There was a 1,000 foot climb in 3 miles to the shelter. I pulled out the cap and neck gaiter there and was much more comfortable walking after that. Filled my water bottles at the spring because today was mostly on a narrow, dry ridge. Today had just about everything. I walked through snow flurries, ice and windy conditions. The flurries didn’t last too long, but the ice held all day except where the sun was shining on it.   This is a beautiful section of the Smokies. I took lots of pictures and will try to post the best ones. Walked out to Charlie’s Bunion. That’s a large rock outcrop that has beautiful views. The sun was shining nicely there and the wind wasn’t bad, so it felt warm out there.   I continued on a lot of very narrow ridges with steep drop offs.   There was a spot with gorgeous views that was protected from the wind and had full sunshine. Took my pack off there and ate lunch. It was so warm. Started walking again and got right back into the wind. I passed by my original destination, Peck’s Corner Shelter. That was ten miles into my day, but it was still early and I was feeling good. It was a little over five miles to Tri Corner Knob Shelter, my new destination. Not sure if it was the hamburgers, or the zero day, but I felt great and had lots of energy. Made it to the shelter and had to set my tent on a site that slopes a couple inches. No other choice here other than sleeping in the shelter.

Today blew that away. Gotta admit though that I was a whipped pup at the end of the day. It didn’t help that I finished the day with a 1,000 foot climb. Woke up this morning and made some iced coffee. I really do enjoy starting my day with two cups of iced coffee. Ate breakfast and packed up inside the tent. I saw my neighbor tenters had already left when I got out. Maybe they don’t have iced coffee. :)
  Dappled sunlight. The Smokies are beautiful, but I’m always ready to walk out of them so I can start sleeping by myself in the woods again. You are required to stay near a shelter in the Smokies. I’m almost never near a shelter any other time. I truly get the best sleep of my life when I’m alone in the woods. I stopped in at the shelter to sign the register and use another smiley face sticker. I met Dreamer, PT, Starbucks and Pocka who were still there. Oh yeah, it only got down to about 30 degrees. I slept nice and toasty. My goal was a 14 mile day to Davenport Gap Shelter, the last shelter in the Smokies. Probably the same male grouse as I heard last night was making his drumming sounds again. There were three climbs and a lot of downs to that shelter. Look at the stats above and see that there were over 7,000 feet of descents overall today. That’s a lot of wear on the ol’ knees. I ran into Talus and Waffle, then ran into Persistant and Long Runner. I got to the gap just before the climb to Mt Camerer and a guy gave me a tangerine and a Snickers. I think that he thought I looked hungry. :)Passed by the side trail to Mt Camerer and the big descent started. I put a lot of pressure on the tops of my hiking poles on the downhills. That might be why I never have knee problems.   I got to Davenport Gap Shelter, but it was only 2pm. I wasn’t ready to stop walking.   Tiny flying saucers attacked this poor tree. :)Left the Smokies in another mile, kept walking and got to where I cross under I-40. Tiger was there handing out some food. I got an orange juice, an apple and two Little Debbie Cupcakes. Crossed under I-40 , then started a fairly steep climb to get to Green Corner Rd. Standing Bear Hostel is to the left. The trail to the right. I took the right in hopes of finding a flat spot in the mountains to get a good nights sleep. There was a spot just 1/10th of a mile in. That was too close to the road for me. I didn’t know it would be a 1,000 foot ascent before I found another flat spot. Set up my tent, crawled in and ate dinner. It’s nice to be the only person here. There was only enough room for me. Good night everyone. :)Sent from my iPhone","Tri Corner Knob Shelter, NC

Tented in the woods where I found a flat spot. No one else around. My favorite way to tent. Thought I might sleep in a bit after a big day yesterday. Didn’t happen. I was ready to get going at my normal time. I like to wake up while it’s still dark out and have coffee and breakfast. Usually packed and ready to walk by the time it gets light out. Used the last of my water for coffee this morning. Only had to walk half a mile before I found a nice small stream and refilled my water bottles. Persistent and Long Runner came walking by while I was getting water. Never saw them again. Today started with a 1,400 foot climb to the summit of Snowbird Mountain. It wasn’t too bad on fresh legs.   View from the top of Snowbird Mountain looking back at the Smokies. There is a space ship looking structure on top. I believe it has something to do with airplanes and their location. The woods opened up and I could look back at the Smokies. Next was a big down hill to Deep Gap. Groundhog Creek Shelter is in that area. It was nice out with sun shining. Maybe in the 40s. The wind blew all day though and that made it feel cool at times. Next was a climb that started off gentle, then half a mile down before a steep 800 foot climb. Spring is definitely coming to the mountains. There were Carolina Spring Beauties covering most of the hillsides.   Carolina Spring Beauties all over the hillsides. I ate lunch near half a dozen younger hikers. Told them how nice it would be if there was trail magic at Max Patch Rd. Got to Max Patch Rd and Biscuits, a three time thru hiker had just pulled in and started taking all kinds of food and beverages out of his van. That was certainly welcome! I had a beer. It’s been years since I had a beer until this trip. I’ve been enjoying a beer when I get to town. I also had an apple, banana and chips. Then Biscuits grilled some hotdogs. I had two before thanking him and walking on. Max Patch was my next climb. It’s an open bald with excellent views. Took some pictures as I summited.   View from Max Patch, NC. Only went another mile and found a good flat spot to make my home for the night.   Another view from Max Patch, NC. Forgot to mention in my last two entries about trees that blew over in the high winds a few days ago. There were about 60 downed trees from Newfound Gap to Tri Corner Knob Shelter. There were maybe 15 downed trees from Tri Corner Knob Shelter to Davenport Gap. There were only half a dozen in today’s section. Tomorrow I’ll get close to Hot Springs, NC and go in for breakfast on Tuesday. The Smoky Mountain Diner has a huge breakfast. :)Sent from my iPhone","Flat Spot at Mile 243.2, NC

I was playing a Sudoku game just before going to sleep. My hands got so cold it was hard to concentrate on the game. Got it done and crawled under my quilt shivering. Warmed up quickly. Woke up after a great nights sleep and played my daily Wordle and Quordle word games. Had coffee and breakfast, then packed up and started walking just as the sun was coming up. There were two woodpeckers that had to be communicating with their pecking. The one in front of me would peck half a dozen times, then stop. The one to my left would do the same thing, then stop. They kept that up all the while I was walking by. I really think they were saying good morning to each other. :)I passed by Roaring Fork Shelter without stopping. There were a few people up and about.   This was my best long distance view today. This is a rhododendron thick wet area. I was in and out of very wet areas for the first 4.5 miles of today’s walk. That’s when I hit the 750 foot climb up to Walnut Mountain Shelter. That’s a very old and airy structure. Someone had just cut all the trees down on top of that mountain when I walked through in 2002. Now it’s a nice bald. I descended to Kale Gap and decided to eat an early lunch before the 1,000 foot climb coming up. That took me to Bluff Mountain. I remembered Smoky and Red taking a break there in 2002.   I can still picture Smoky and Red on those rocks in 2002 when I passed by. I must have been paying attention to this area when I walked through 20 years ago. :)Next up was actually a down. A 2,000 foot downhill walk to Garenflo Gap. Long descents like that end up being hard. Always using my hiking poles to take as much of the weight off my knees as I can. There was only a couple miles from there to where I planned on stopping for the night. It was nice enough, but very weak cell service. Chief gets worried about me if I don’t post every night. I wake up to 5 or 6 voicemails from him hoping I’m okay. ;)I didn’t want to worry the ol’ boy, so I walked on in hopes of getting better cell service. I found a beautiful flat spot about 1.5 miles further north. A little better cell service. Gonna try uploading some pictures.   My most excellent tent site tonight. No need to thank me Chief. :)Sent from my iPhone","Mile 256 Flat Spot, NC

Predawn was already starting to show. I fell asleep listening to an owl and woke up listening to an owl. It’s hard to get any better than that. Had just one iced coffee to get my day started. I knew I would be sitting in the Smoky Mountain Diner in two hours. Packed and walking by my normal time. Guess the thought of someone else making my breakfast was a big motivator. :)
  Layers of mountains. Passed by the Deer Park Mountain Shelter in less than half a mile. Saw a few tents, but nobody moving. 
  Love seeing the distant mountains while I’m walking. Caught up to Groceries about a mile later and walked to the hostel with her. 
  Today’s footpath. Press, one of the hikers I’ve met along the trail said “Stumpy, I met someone who knows you. Trippin' Ant”.Holy smokes! I summited Katahdin with Trippin’ Ant 20 years ago.  I went back to my 2002 journal and found Trippin’ Ant and me the day we summited Katahdin. That really brought back some memories! She said Trippin’ Ant was out to walk half the trail for his 20th. I would have loved to run into him, but he still walks like I used to, so I’ll never catch him. Oh well, it was fun thinking back to old friends. Got to Smoky Mountain Diner and got a table for eight all to myself. Breakfast was delicious and filling. Coffee, well, at least six refills. :)
  The sausage skillet at Smoky Mountain Diner. Today was a nero. There’s three other hikers and myself planning on slackpacking from Allen Gap back to Hot Springs tomorrow. Should be about 14 miles. That’s gonna be my first slackpack since Chief and Xmas (the bourbon boys) left me to fend for myself back in Georgia.   Let’s see, I’ve lost that darn trail again.

Go take a look)Woke up and had a couple cups of strong coffee. I ate so much late yesterday that I was not hungry at all. Jason, the shuttle driver showed up at 7:30am. There were five of us taking the shuttle, but two backed out at the last minute. Pauka (that’s what his 6 year old granddaughter calls him), Starbucks and me got a ride to Allen Gap. We started walking about 8am. Today was forecast to be in the 80s. That’s by far the hottest day of this hike. There were 4 big hills to climb before starting some descents. Two of those were pretty steep. Stopped at Spring Mountain Shelter and signed the register and added a smiley face sticker. :)  A very old Spring Mountain Shelter. The first guy I ran into was Old School. He said he took that name because he has an antiquated view on life. I thought that was a great name. I’m walking up a hill and a guy says ""Stumpknocker”.It was Steps. He said I was the first one to sign his guestbook when he started walking a few years ago. I don’t remember that, but he was appreciative. He’s been hiking with Birdman who I believe signed my guestbook not long ago. Got their picture, then walked on. Next I ran into Smoky, who I first met in Franklin, NC. He was walking with Big Pain. Running into all kinds of people today since I was slackpacking southbound. Kind of fun running into so many people today. Next was a big climb up Rich Mountain. I stopped and talked to Persistent and Long Runner. There were quite a few mountain fountains that I kept topping off my water bottle.   Best tasting water in the world!
Summited Rich Mountain, then started easier downhill walking. Ran into Rootbeer next. I stopped and talked to most people I saw today. It was fun catching up with everyone. Some of the long range views were nice, but it seemed a bit more hazy with the higher temperature. Robby and I stopped to talk just before Tanyard Gap. I knew the other day when I met him that he’s done quite a bit of go fast bicycling. His calves showed the miles he’s peddled. He got started in 1972 when he and a buddy did a cross country bicycle ride. That was about 4 years before the Trans Am route came to be. Got down to Tanyard Gap and ran into Adrianne who was tented next to me on the extremely windy night on Cheoah Bald. Her husband Mike is here helping her slackpack this area. I also met Mike on my first day in the Smokies. So much fun running into all these new friends. :)I had about 6 miles left. I was wearing down in the heat. A lot of the 6 miles were exposed to the sun.   Open and hot area about five miles north of Hot Springs, NC. I kept walking until I got to a small pond that had a sitting bench. I’m a sucker for a sitting bench. Can’t pass one up. :)I watched a fish snag a bug from the shoreline right in front of me. Bad for the bug, but good for the fish.   Bugs beware! There’s hungry fish in this pond. I finally got to the descent into Hot Springs. This area gets a ton of day hikers. With so much use comes a well worn path. The small rocks and steep descent meant I really had to pay attention not to slip off the side. It was a relief to get down to the French Broad River, then a short walk into Hot Springs. It was hot in Hot Springs today!  The French Broad River was flowing fast. Dropped my pack off at the hostel and even though I didn’t want to go out again, I needed to resupply. Bought two fish sandwiches on the way back. That was the first food I’ve eaten since yesterday. It was a good day, just hot. Tomorrow I return to Allen Gap and walk north for 4 or 5 days to Erwin, TN. Sent from my iPhone","Hot Springs, NC

I knew that I’d be at the diner soon, but I wanted a kick start with the coffee. :)I left for the diner at 6am. Ordered a feta and spinach omelette, with home fries, a homemade biscuit and more coffee. Paucka and Starbucks showed up for our shuttle back to Allen Gap. We started walking north at 8:45am. Crossed a gravel road called Log Cabin Road and there was a small table with homemade cookies. Can’t pass up food on the trail, so I had one and wrote a thank you in the small register they left. Then started the 2,500 foot climb to the summit of Camp Creek Bald. Some of the climb was pretty steep, but most of it was fairly easy. It was just a long uphill walk.   View from Big Firescald Knob. The next big feature and probably the toughest terrain of the trail so far was making my way through Big Firescald Knob.   An example of Big Firescald Knob. The best way I can describe it is that it’s a 1.4 mile section of rugged rocks, boulders and steep ups and downs that’s a lot of fun making your way though. Also, you have to stop every once in a while to enjoy the beautiful views from the above the trees knob.   Plenty of nice views today. My legs were like jello when I finally got through. Kept walking another two miles to Jerry’s Cabin Shelter. There were a few people setting up tents, but I like sleeping near the Shelton  boys gravesite. I believe they were three very young Confederate boys (13 years old?) that were shot and killed in this area. One of these days I’ll learn the story. This place has some kind of a draw to me though. It was another four mile walk to get there and I had to go over Big Butt Mountain first. I always think of Hippie Longstockings when I walk over Big Butt Mountain. Not sure why? lol Paucka and Starbucks caught up to me just as I got to the Shelton Gravesite. We all walked up there and saw Rootbeer already had her tent set up. Got company tonight. I paid my respect to the Shelton boys, set up my tent and crawled in.   One of the Shelton boys grave stones. I ate the heaviest of the food I was carrying for dinner.

Not sure I moved until 4am. Decided to go ahead and have coffee and breakfast. Packed and walking just as the sun popped up. I walked a few miles to Flint Shelter. It was beautiful out and I was enjoying the morning. A guy at the shelter ruined all that. He said snow was coming by 2pm. Darn. It’s April 8th. No snow, nice weather.  :)I thanked him for the disappointing forecast and walked on. Turns out his forecast was wrong. It started snowing at 10am. Just as I crossed Devil’s Fork Road I noticed some snow pellets falling. Darn.   The snow wasn’t sticking much during the day. There was another road in half a mile, then a 1,500 foot climb. Again, parts of the climb were fairly steep, but some wasn’t bad at all. 
  The falling snow is obscuring the view of the mountains. I am getting in better climbing shape. It feels good when I hit a mountain and don’t have to stop to catch my breath. The really steep stuff still makes me stop for a few seconds. The wind was making it feel chilly. I had already put on my raincoat to stay dry. I had to put on my rain kilt to keep my legs warm. It’s no good for me to wear rain pants. I overheat quickly. The rain kilt works great at keeping me warm without overheating. I walked past Hogback Ridge Shelter without stopping. It was too far off the trail and I was already looking forward to crawling into my tent. I still had about five miles to get to where I planned on stopping for the night. Got to Sam’s Gap. There was only about 1.5 miles to go. I got to the spring I wanted to sleep near. Snow was all over my tent by the time I had it set up. 
  I just got my tent set up and already accumulation of snow. I walked in snow pellets and some big powdery snow for about five hours today. The snow didn’t accumulate most of the day because the ground was still warm from the 80+ degree temperature two days ago.

This is where if I were my ol’ buddy Chief that I’d be calling Carleen, explaining just how horrible it is out here and have her rescue me. I’m not Chief, so I started packing after some delicious iced coffee and breakfast. I got out of the tent and knocked off all the snow. I usually fold my tent, but today I took it by the peak and shook off more snow and ice. And then I started climbing. It was very slick, so I shortened my stride.   Today is April 9th!
I knew today was going to be slow going, so I kept a small stride and enjoyed the beauty around me. 
  Log steps up the mountain 
It had started snowing yesterday morning and continued through the night and was still snowing. I had walked about two miles and was pretty proud of myself for going on up the mountain in these conditions. Thought I heard a voice, but didn’t turn to look. I kept climbing, then I did hear a voice. She asked if could she pass. That was about a 30 year old female jogger and she was running up the mountain that I was taking small steps on. I had stopped and watched her fade away up the mountain. I was thoroughly impressed. I continued with my small steps up the mountain.   How could anyone not enjoy a day like this?
I was within a mile of the summit when the jogger came back. She said she turned around at the tableland because she didn’t have the right equipment to make the last steep climb. We talked a couple minutes, then she headed home….a home with heat! I headed for the cold, windy summit of Big Bald Mountain. 
  Getting closer to the summit of Big Bald Mountain. It’s just hard to write how pretty today was, even though it was blustery, cold and snowing on that mountain.   Trail markers on Big Bald Mountain. This was my ninth time climbing Big Bald Mountain, but it was by far my favorite. It was so beautiful that I just stood there on the summit and looked at a 270 degree view. I didn’t look at the other 90 degree view because the wind and blowing snow hurt to look into it. 
  The summit of Big Bald Mountain. Going up was tough, but going down was tougherer. Yes, that’s an actual word today. :)
  Starting to head down the other side of Big Bald Mountain. No less beautiful, but much more slippery. There were quite a few times that I would take a step that I thought was not bad, but would be 9 to 12 inches lower. That’s jarring when you’re not ready for the drop.   Love the frosty trees. Fortunately, my poles kept me upright. In fact, if there ever was a day that I should have fallen, it was today. But, my zero falls to date is continuing on. :)I stopped by Big Bald Shelter and took my first sit down break. I realized that I’d been on my feet and climbing nonstop for over four hours. Ate a little lunch, drank a little mountain water and walked on. Climbed Little Bald Mountain, then descended a bunch of very slippery rocks and got to the base of High Rocks. That’s another pretty good climb. There was a tent set up in that area. I heard a couple talking as I passed. It got very windy again while climbing High Rocks.  One more time for the sheer beauty of nature. I was very glad when that ascent turned down. Spivey Gap had been my hopeful destination. I got there, crossed the road and started the climb out of that gap. The snow at that elevation was a wet, sticky snow. It weighted the rhododendrons low in my path. I’d walk a few feet, then bash the next rhododendron with my hiking pole to relieve it of the burden of the snow. It would pop up and give me passage. I did that to the top of the first hill, maybe 500 to 600 feet in elevation before I found the first flat spot. The wind was howling, but I was home for the night. All I had to do was build my home. I set my tent on a bunch of snow, staked it out and crawled in and moaned. :)I was wet from knocking the snow out of the rhododendrons. I was tired from the long day on my feet and only one break, but I was home!Slowly got out of the wet stuff, put on all the dry stuff I could find, ate dinner, stuck my thumb in my mouth and fell asleep. :)What a fantastic day to get to enjoy! Sent from my iPhone","Near Spring at Mile 321.1 , NC

Wasn’t quite ready to tackle that at my normal time. My wet socks and wet wind jacket from when I set up camp last night were frozen solid. My shoes were frozen solid also, but I learned a long time ago to always open up the laces and the tongue of the shoes. That way you can slip your foot into the shoe in the morning and they will thaw fairly fast.   The view from my tent this morning. I was packed and walking shortly before 9am. Last two nights were in the lower 20s, but the forecast for today was sunny and the 50s. It was a snowy start and I continued to knock snow out of the rhododendrons to clear my path. It’s amazing to see trail completely blocked, but tap them with your hiking pole and the snow falls to the ground and the path opens up. 
  Do you see the trail? It’s in there. The snow had started melting in earnest by the time I got to No Business Knob Shelter. A couple walking south got to the shelter the same time I did. They said they started Waynesboro, VA when they live. I asked if they knew Gourmet Dave and his wife Sue. They said yes. They live so close to Gourmet Dave that they could throw a stone a hit his house. I’ll check that stone thing out next time I’m up there. It would be cool if I really could hit Gourmet Dave’s house with a stone. :)They asked my name and when I said Stumpknocker, they said they knew me from sometime around 2004 or so. Her name was PB, his was J. They call themselves PB&J. I took their picture, said goodbye and walked on. 
  The trail is right up the middle of those rhododendrons. The snow was almost gone on the south side of the mountain. It was even melting fast on the shady north side. Got to the point where you can look down and see the Nolichucky River. <  br>Kept descending to Erwin, TN and walked to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel.

  Another of today’s long distance views. There was a guy doing trail magic at Indian Grave Gap. I thanked him, but didn’t take any food since I had fried chicken waiting on me at the hostel. Miles To Go and M&M walked up just as I was leaving. They’re the two I shared a shuttle with. It was a pretty easy walk today. Only steep stuff was near Curly Maple Gap Shelter. I seem to remember something about a shelter burning down some time ago. I came across the foundation of what looked to be a shelter just to the north of the current shelter. Anyone know for sure?
  The old Curly Maple Gap Shelter foundation?
Started following a stream for several miles. That was nice to listen to while I was walking.It was about 1pm when I started thinking about the fried chicken waiting on me. My stomach started growling. :)
I came across a small patch of the first Mayapples I’ve seen this year.   These will be prolific along the trail before long. I could hear the Nolichucky River before seeing it. I knew I was getting close to home for the night. Took a picture of the Nolichucky River as I walked across the bridge. Uncle Johnny’s Hostel is just on the other side of the river. 
  Nolichucky River. I’m so glad I did this walk today. Took another shower. That’s a shower yesterday and one today!

I almost felt rushed to get everything ready for the day. The hostel office didn’t open until 8:30 and I owed them money for two days stay. Got dropped off at the same place as yesterday, only walked north today. First thing I did was to put on my raincoat and rain kilt. They stayed on all day because it never stopped raining for long. The trail was as slippery and slick as I’ve ever seen it. Not sure why, but there’s no aggregate mixed in the dirt. That made for walking on slick mud all day. The first big climb of the day took me up and over Beauty Spot. That’s an open bald with excellent views.   View from Beauty Spot. Walked down to Beauty Spot Gap, then started the 1,000 foot climb up Unaka Mountain.   Walking through Unaka Mountain. Unaka is unlike any other mountain on the AT. There is a species of pine or fir trees that are dark and beautiful. I don’t think sunlight ever gets through to the ground there. I’ve walked through the area twice at dusk and it has a spooky feel to it.   The misterious dark pines of Unaka Mountain. I’ve never camped there and don’t intend to. Gremlins might get me. :)Anyway, it’s very nice to walk through and enjoy the rare area. Next up was a long downhill to Cherry Gap Shelter. It was full of hikers getting out of the rain. It would have been so nice to curl up and take a nap.   Wet trail on Beauty Spot. I sat and talked a while, then headed back out into the rain. There was a small 500 foot climb, then about 700 feet down to Iron Mountain Gap. I knew by then that home was going to be the next flat spot I found. Only had to go less than a mile before finding my home for the night. It’s hard walking in slick mud all day. Only did eleven miles, but was extra tired.   Another view from Beauty Spot. The tent up, I crawled in and ate dinner. Shortly after dinner, the sun popped out. That’s the first I saw the sun all day.   Foggy and rainy weather on Beauty Spot. I’m surprised I haven’t heard any songbirds yet. They’ve got to be showing up soon. My favorite along the AT is a brown thrasher. They’re shy, so you don’t see them very often, but their four different songs are something I could listen to all day and never tire of it. I did hear a male grouse and several woodpeckers. There were a few geese along the Nolichucky River. That was all today. Sent from my iPhone","USFS 230, TN

So much so that they woke me up before 4 am. Next thing I woke up to was a song bird. All I had to do was say I haven’t heard any songbirds in yesterday’s journal and today I get one. It was nice, but a little far away. Ate breakfast and had coffee, but I was not ready to pack up. I think all that slick mud yesterday took it’s toll on me.   A nice view from near Hughes Gap. I knew Roan Mountain was coming up towards the end of my day, so I got packed and was walking just before 8am. It was supposed to be partly cloudy and 70 degree temperature. It started raining not long after I started walking. 
 Another nice view. I walked up a couple smaller hills and came to Greasy Creek Gap. There seems to be more woodpeckers out. I hear quite a few every morning now. I stopped and put a little A&D Ointment on a few places I could feel some packrash from yesterday’s rain walk. Stopped for a break and called Chief. I had to tell him that some ramps were starting to show up just passed Greasy Creek. I ate a few of the onion like plant. Hoped there might be some closer to dinner time to add to my cracked pepper turkey breast sandwich for dinner. Chief called me back and said they were at their mountain house and could come pick me up at Hughes Gap. I had to think about logistics for a minute. Sounded like it would work out and I could still get to Mountain Harbour B&B by Friday. I quickened my pace got to Hughes Gap. There were a couple guys doing some trail magic. I thank them, but didn’t have any. Carleen had Chief come and take me back to their mountain house outside of West Jefferson, NC. She’s so nice to me!It felt great having a short day. Chief got to the gap about 10 minutes after I did. It was so nice getting a hot shower, eating grilled hamburgers and hotdogs and having a couple drinks.
   Look what Carleen left on my pillow tonight. My body was feeling it needed rest and Chief and Carleen gave me what I needed.

I had to get out of bed and climb the stairs to get coffee. It was worth it though because it was Starbucks French Roast. My life is so hard sometimes. :)Chief and I headed back to the trail. I talked him into slackpacking me between Carver’s Gap and Hughes Gap. It felt great not having the heavy pack on my back.   Climbing Roan Mountain. He took me back to Carver’s Gap and it started raining and got real foggy and cool out. I didn’t want to get out of the car. I finally did and Chief got ready to leave, but had to roll his window down and smiled at my having to walk off in the rain. The area is beautiful, but it was fogged in today. Once I got about a mile in the slippery, slick mud returned. That’s so hard to walk through and stay upright. Stopped at a piped spring and filled up my water bottles for the night. The mud lasted a few miles to near the Stan Murray Shelter. There was mud after that, but not nearly as bad. Left that shelter after a short break. There were already two girls in their sleeping bags there. I wanted to walk another four miles to get in between the Hump Mountains. I passed a family of four that were walking south. The two children had walked by already, but the father said “Stumpy”.Turns out he used to read my journal years ago. His name is Farmer Chef, his wife is Momma Bear. The children are Itchy and Scratchy. They’ve already done the trail and are walking it again in sections.   Farmer Chef and Momma Bear. Passed by Overmountain Shelter without stopping.   A field full of ramps. The climb up Little Hump Mountain starts at that trail junction.   The sun made a late day appearance. My plan was to get over Little Hump and tent before the climb up Hump Mountain. I set up my tent and ate dinner.

The sun was just starting to come up when I woke up to eat. I was going to take my time because it’s a short day, but then I remembered I was climbing Hump Mountain. That just might be my favorite mountain on the entire Appalachian Trail.   Packed and walking by about 7:30 am. Got down to Bradley Gap, then started climbing Hump Mountain. It’s a mostly treeless mountain, so the views are nonstop. 
  Another great thing about starting early was that the mud was frozen, so the footing was very good. I’ll have more pictures than usual in today’s journal. All I had to do to get a great photo was point and shoot.   Even the wind was easy on me. Maybe 5 to 10 mph. I remember the winds and fog in 2002. Bob Peoples told me it was 90 mph when I crossed it. I had to walk it leaning almost 45 degrees just to not get blown over. 
  I had the mountain all to myself this morning. It was absolute silence up there. I love quiet!
  Finally started walking down the other side of the mountain. Entered woods again in about a mile.   The trail became very rocky for the next 1.5 miles. The trail improved just before leaving North Carolina. I spread some of Pamela’s ashes at the border. 
  I walked a couple hundred feet and sat on a rock. All I did was sit there and think for about 20 minutes before walking on.   Spread some of Pamela’s ashes here at the border. I continued descending. Passed 5 people walking up the mountain for day hikes. This area would be a great ten mile day hike up to Hump Mountain. Sat down just before the road and ate lunch. Polaris and Emily stopped briefly to talk.   Got to 19E and went to Mountain Harbour Hostel.Got checked in, showered and did hiker laundry. I’m signed up for their famous breakfast tomorrow.

I’ve been here maybe 7 times before, but never had their breakfast. I signed up for it yesterday. Wasn’t going to miss out again. The rain let up a little when I walked up to the main house for 7:45 am coffee. There must have been 30 different breakfast items. Way too many for a hiker to choose from, so I took a little of everything. That was too much food. I enjoyed it, but I also needed to walk today. :)  One of today’s views. I packed up and was walking north by 9:30 am. The rain was gone. That was fantastic timing for a change.   Another view from today. There’s a 1,000 foot climb to start with. That climb always seems tough to me. Parts of the trail was slick because of the rain. Walking got easier as the day went on and the trail improved. A white dog must have been up to no good because he took off running when he saw me. Walked by Isaacs Cemetery just after the summit. It feels like it’s way back in the middle of nowhere. You walk by a church and a road not long after the cemetery though.   Bet there’s lots of shade under this tree in the summer. Took the side trail to Jones Falls. It’s supposed to be one of the tallest falls around.   Tough looking at this stuff all day. :)Sat down by Mountaineers Falls a few miles later. I ate a snack and filled my water bottles. Cado came walking by. I hadn’t seen her in over 300 miles. She stopped at the shelter, but I kept walking.   This was my view from a small branch. When I crossed the gravel Walnut Mountain Rd I was called over by Marlene the Trail Angel. It felt great to sit in a chair. We talked probably 45 minutes before I walked on. She gave me two tangerines and a banana for tomorrow’s breakfast. I walked on another few miles and found a flat spot behind some rhododendrons. I heard some crows, some woodpeckers pecking, but that was about all. Sent from my iPhone","19E, TN

That was extra nice. I even heard blue jays for the first time out here. Those always take me back to my childhood.   One of today’s long distance views. Got the register at Moreland Gap Shelter and signed in wishing everyone a Happy Easter. Got to use another smiley face sticker too. :)Today was one of those days where I walked slowly and enjoyed my surroundings.   Gotta love a good waterfall!There were a few short steep climbs, but nothing bad. Also had some nice long distant views. I descended to Dennis Cove Rd and walked up to Kincora Hostel. Bob Peoples owns it. He has been a friend for over 20 years now. No one was at the hostel and only the old truck. His other vehicle was gone. It’s supposed to rain tomorrow and possibly have a little snow, so I was planning on staying at Black Bear Hostel down the road. I started walking away and heard a voice. It was Bob. He wrecked his Jeep last August and just uses the truck now. We sat and talked about two hours. That’s a short talk with Bob. :)I arranged a shuttle from him in the morning and headed down to Black Bear for the night. My plan is to slackpack back to Black Bear tomorrow in the rain, get showered, resupply in town and head out from Watauga Lake the next morning.

I was the only one around, so I drank 3/4s of the pot before Bob showed up. It’s always great to see and talk to Bob. I knew he liked Dunkin Donuts coffee, so I offered to buy his breakfast there. He had exactly what I expected; a coffee and Boston Cream donut. I had two sausage, egg and cheese biscuits. I’m not a fan of their coffee, besides I had nearly a whole pot of coffee already. We sat there about an hour catching up. He dropped me off at Watauga Lake and I walked south back to Dennis Cove Rd. Laurel Falls. It had been raining and was chilly. I started off with a 1,700 foot climb up Pond Flats. I’ve always wanted to tent up there, but haven’t yet. There’s a nice spring up there, so you don’t even have to carry water. It got cold on top for a while. The wind picked up, but that only lasted for about 15 minutes. I ran into Cado, Lone Wolf, Sponge Bob and Rootbeer. That’s part of the fun of walking south. Kept descending allthe way to Laurel Falls. They were flowing nicely today. There was a steep climb up a bunch of stone steps. Those steps really work the leg muscles!Ran into Mike again. He’s Adrianne’s husband who comes out to support her when he can. Got to Dennis Cove Rd and headed for Black Bear. It was a wet and chilly day, so I took a hot shower and had a midday nap. :)The shuttle at Black Bear only went to Hampton which doesn’t have a lot of choices. Bob Peoples took ET, a mother/daughter pair of hikers and me to an excellent Mexican restaurant in Elizabethton. Thank you kindly Bob!

It was a beautiful day and the sun was shining. The bad part was the wind. It was blowing hard enough to really make me cold. Another view of Watauga Lake. Crossed over the dam and then I started climbing. Seemed like I climbed forever. I’d climb a little and take a picture. Climb more and take another picture. It went like that all the way up to Vandeventor Shelter. View from the dam at Watauga Lake. It was just to pretty out not to stop often. My goal for the day was Iron Mountain Shelter. Stopped and signed the shelter register at Vandeventor Shelter, but didn’t stay long. The wind was really ripping through there and I chilled down fast. There were mostly small ups and downs after the shelter. A couple 400 to 500 foot climbs just to keep me warmed up. :)Got to a spring and tent spot about three miles before the shelter and decided to cut the day short. Set up my tent, got water and relaxed in the tent a few hours. Gonna be a cold night, then turning milder the next few days. The trees are getting their leaves, at least at the lower elevations. Also saw my first of the year Fire Pink Flowers. Fire Pinks, my first of the year. Laying in my tent writing this journal entry and being sung to by several birds.

I measured that little bugger and his body, not including the tail, was 5 3/16th inches long. Just exactly what I had figured. ;)Anyway, that’s how I spent my lunch today. :)Got to Double Springs Shelter next and ran into Magellan and True Momma there stretched out in the grass enjoying the sun. We talked a while and I refilled my water bottles, then walked on. I saw two deer. I haven’t seen much wildlife yet, so it was nice watching the deer. They knew I was there, so they eventually left the area. Might just be the first deer I’ve seen on this walk. I got to US 421 and took a short break at a picinic table. It’s impossible for me to walk by a picinic table without stopping. :)The next shelter I walked by was a really old and small McQueens Knob Shelter. I just took a picture and walked on. McQueens Knob Shelter in Tennessee. Not far was Abington Gap Shelter. I signed the register and realized I didn’t have quite enough water for the night. Poor planning on my part because the water here is .2 miles down a steep hill. I walked down there, got water, then walked .2 miles up a steep hill.

Three states behind me now. Hello Virginia! Thank you Tennessee!I was the only one there. Got out more of Pamela’s ashes and spread them around a few trees there. I always think of the last hug I got from her when I’m spreading her ashes around. Hannah walked up and celebrated at the state line. Took a picture of her with her camera by the sign so she could send it to her boyfriend. Tonya came up next with video rolling. She said she had lots of plans for things to do at the border. Hannah and I left so she could play. Today’s trail. Hannah walked into Damascus with me. She’s fun to be around and is a strong hiker. Much stronger hiker than me, so today will probably be the last I see of her on this year’s walk. Welcome to Damascus. Lone Wolf was walking through town and we ran into each other. I first met him and Gypsy on my 2002 thru hike when we were in Pennsylvania. He and I talked until he had to leave. I told him I wanted a good strong cup of hot coffee and he pointed me to the best in town. Pretty soon Gypsy came riding up on her bicycle, then Wolf came back. We sat there talking for over an hour before he had to leave on a shuttle. So great seeing both of them. While I was talking to Lone Wolf earlier, this year’s Lone Wolf walked up. I introduced Lone Wolf to Lone Wolf. :)Okay, coffee gone, I ordered a large chocolate milkshake and to be healthy, I ordered a house salad. A clean looking Hannah walked by and joined me. Most hiker’s priority in town is a shower. Mine has always been food. I’ll bet I spent at least 2.5 hours there and maybe 3 hours. I decided to head over to The Place and see about taking a shower. Got to The Place, but got busy talking, so still no shower. Nice shoes Stumpknocker. :)Got a call from Cathy and Karen that they were going to be as late as 9 pm picking me up. They also said that they reserved a room in Abington, VA and I could meet them there if I could get a ride. I walked to the other end of town and stuck out my thumb. Mike and Adrianne offered me a ride half way, but I was in a good place to hitch, so I stayed. Another guy offered a ride for a few miles, but I was going nearly 20. I stayed. About the 10th car was going to Abington. They had just finished riding the Creeper Trail and were going home. I sat in the back seat with a big bird that they said would bite if I stuck my hand over to him. No problem there! :)We had a fun conversation about hiking and they ended up going 5 miles out of their way to get me to the motel. I checked in and finally got that shower. It felt great. Even washed my clothes in the shower. What a wonderful day!You all are wondering why I needed a ride? Where is my ride taking me? What about my walk to Katahdin? Did I get hurt? The answer is that I have Macular Degeneration. I’ve been getting eye injections for about six years now, usually every six weeks. I talked my doctor into extending the six weeks out to eight weeks because of this year’s long walk. He agreed. My eye injections are scheduled for Monday. My insurance requires in-network care. This will be my first of this hike. I’m hoping to only have one more time to work out before I finish. It will be close.

I made a quick decision to have breakfast at Damascus Diner before I left town. Started walking out of town after breakfast. Saw two people sitting on the porch at Crazy Larry’s Hostel. It was Larry and Rambling Man. We talked a short while, then I continued walking the trail out of town. The trail turned into the woods. That was a great feeling finally heading back into the calm forest. The traffic noise was gone in about 15 minutes and all I could hear was the quiet of nature and an occasional song bird.   It was getting really warm, but I was happy to be climbing the first 900 foot hill. There was a log at the top of that climb that I just couldn’t pass up. Took my pack off and let the air dry the sweat off me. Speaking of packs, I changed out packs for this section. I’ve tried liking my Zpacks Arc Haul pack for about 800 miles. I’ve never cared for it much. Too much fiddling with it all the time. I’m carrying a Hyperlite pack now. First day ever using it and I like it. Hopefully I’ll continue liking it. :)Saw the first of the season azaleas today.   Came up to a nice stream and took another pack off break and got some cold water. The water I packed out of town was too warm to enjoy. Ben and Jerry were just leaving when I got there. They were the first people I’d seen on the trail today.   The trail stayed above the Creeper Bicycle Trail. I followed that for maybe half an hour, then started the 1,100 foot climb up to Saunders Shelter.   I had planned to keep going, but I was tired. Set up my tent and walked down the hill for water. There’s about a dozen hikers at the shelter. I’ve never seen any of them before.

I’ll stick to listening to the natural sounds that are along the AT. Nashvegas stopped and talked a while.

I’ve spent lots of time trying to get a journal entry to load on many occasions. The whole process has become more like work and that’s not enjoyable on the trail. I’m five days behind with the journal. Taking a zero in Atkins, Virginia today and just couldn’t make myself spend 4 or 5 hours of my zero day catching up on the journal. I’ve decided to stop journaling about my hike and just walk. It should be more pleasurable not spending one to two hours a day writing and trying to upload the entry. Thank you to everyone for following along to this point. Sent from my iPhone","

Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652013,"Hello? Hello? Anyone seen Stumpknocker? :)
I’ve been spotted walking on the Appalachian Trail. 
Just a quick note to let everyone know that I’m fine. Don’t know where I found the time to write my journal. I still don’t have much spare time on my hands. 
Started out very slow for the first 3.5 weeks. My average day now is 16 to 17 miles. I’m happy with that mileage.   First rattlesnake I’ve seen this year  
I picked out a few pictures from the last month to add here.   I like the turbulence of this valley fog. Thank you to everyone who signed my guestbook! I see some very good friends have signed it. I’m hoping to go through the list when I have to take a week off for my next eye injections and answer everyone. 
  I really like this photo taken north of McAfee Knob, Virginia 
Oh yeah, I’m still at zero falls for this hike. :)
One more thing. Chief offered to make up a daily journal of what he thought I was doing each day and post it here if I would only give him my password. I thought about it, but decided not to do that. I’m sure he would have written nice things about me and that would ruin his reputation. I’m just lookin’ out for my ol’ buddy. :)","Amicalola Falls, Georgia

Stumpknocker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656255,"Update time. 
I’ve been off trail for the last two months. Came home in June for my every eight week eye injection. The eye doctor had said four months prior that I really needed laser treatment to clear up foggy vision. I delayed that hoping to get through this walk first. My vision had really deteriorated by June, so I set up the first available appointment which just happened yesterday. (8-10-2022)My vision had gotten to the point that I no longer drove, stopped riding my bicycle because I couldn’t see dark cars coming when I crossed roads and I had even stopped playing sudoku because the print was a very light gray and I had to use a magnifying glass just to see the box. I continued walking five to eight miles every morning, but even had to pay special attention to make sure no cars were coming when I crossed a road. I had a 2 pm appointment yesterday. I was standing at the front desk at 3 pm settling up my bill, when I looked out the front window and could see cars clearly on the road. Print was black again, not the faint light gray I’ve been seeing. Everything thing around me is brilliant. It's wonderful!I am a lucky guy!Two more eye appointments next week and if they go well I’ll be flipping up to Katahdin and walking south to where I left off the trail in June. I’ll get Maine and New Hampshire done hopefully before my next eye injection in early October. This should clear up any questions posted in my guestbook. Thank you. :)","Appalachian Trail
