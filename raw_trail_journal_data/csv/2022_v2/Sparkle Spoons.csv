Sparkle Spoons,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647328,"I decided to take the whole family to Georgia for February break. Along the way we visited some stellar locations on the Appalachian Trail: the Shenandoah National Park (mountains for miles), the Greyson Highlands (wild ponies!) and Hiawassee (where my extended family got together to meet the boys and wish us well on our trip). Once we had spent ample family time together, Quinn and I hit the trail and did a three-day shakedown hike. 
We began at the infamous Amicalola Falls, after registering as thru-hikers. I wanted to register as section hikers, since that's what we likely are, but Quinn was really determined to get started on the most optimistic note. Who knows, maybe we could complete the trail together in a calendar year? The wonderful Sheila, who works both in the shop next to the AT basecamp and up at the Lodge store, usually registers section hikers. When Quinn said he was a thru-hiker then Sheila sent us next door to the basecamp at Station #2. Inside Station #2 we did the AT registration and listened to the prep session with the ranger. There was a small group before us, maybe four people, and only one other person listening to the session with us. She looked highly anxious and was nearly vibrating with nerves and anticipation; this was her second attempt at thru hiking the AT. Outside her family was waiting with ours. Her mother and toddler sister chatted with Griffin, Julian, and Julie as they waited for us to complete our registration. This other hiker was going to wait until the morning to start, but Quinn and I were going to start at the quite late hour of 2:30pm. 
The prep session was informing. There are bear boxes at every shelter throughout the 80 miles that the AT runs through Georgia. This was a relief to hear, because I hadn't yet learned to either secure my Ursack bear bag on the ground or to do a bear hang. The ranger was ready to teach us how to do either, but I figured I could learn to do one or both of those things during the 80 mile walk through Georgia. What I didn't realize is that our first night on the trail, four hours later,  we would be at a tent site with no bear box. We made it about three hours before Quinn started weeping and asked to lay down in a ditch, but I'll continue that tale in the next entry.After a quick 20 minute tutorial on hiking the AT, we left the ranger station and went behind the building to take pictures at the iconic stone arch. Quinn's little brothers did plenty of photo bombing and we hugged many times. Then we all started hiking together, which was anti-climatic. When we made it to the waterfall Julie decided to spare the younger children from climbing the stairs, and off they went back to the truck. Quinn and I were ready and mounted the stairs happily. There were lots of visitors to the park at the falls and several other thru hikers climbing it, too.

Our plan is to make it to Plum Orchard Gap within the week, where we'll be able to walk to my Aunt Tracey and Uncle Don's for another family reunion.","Atlanta
