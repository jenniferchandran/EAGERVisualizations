Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651137,"We decided to go for our triple crown this year. We finish our current contract at the end of April but already have a trip planned with friends to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for the last week of June into the first week of July. We tried to think of what we could do for the month of May and most of June. We still feel international travel is a gamble due to Covid restrictions and flight cancellations. (Although we did briefly consider the Camino Portuguese before realizing 2022 has been made an honorary Holy Year since last year's real Holy Year was cancelled due to Covid. Holy Year = crowds so no go for us!) West coast mountains are typically snowbound until at least June and the Southwest is usually too hot by mid May. But an Appalachian Trail flip-flop can be started in May! So that's what we decided to do. 
This isn't our first time planning to hike the Appalachian trail. We planned a north-bound hike in 2008 but then I got into nursing school with a June start date so we cancelled. Then in 2018, we planned a south-bound hike. We even bought plane tickets to Maine. But, ten miles into a gear-shakedown hike on the PCT, my right hip developed the same pain I felt at the end of our Camino Frances hike (finished a couple weeks earlier), starting my two-year-long hiking-hiatus for Femoacetabular Impingement & Tear repair. (I document my experience with FAI, surgery, and recovery here.)So the Triple Crown has been on our minds for many years but it looks like this year is the best opportunity to begin it. We're going to start in Georgia in May, hike north until mid-June, where we'll take off for our trip to Alaska and visit family in July. After that, we're leaving it open. If we're enjoying the Appalachian Trail, we'll get up to Maine and start south. If we're not enjoying it, we may do something else. We'll just have to see how it all plays out!",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Thu",0
Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651138,"Today we are flying to Georgia. When we bought plane tickets a month or so back, direct flights from Sacramento to Atlanta where expensive so we picked a cheaper flight with a layover in Seattle (go figure two flights in different directions is cheaper than one direct flight, doesn't make any sense). Our flight out of Sacramento departed at 6:00am so it was an early wake up for us. Gary was kind enough to drive us to the airport at 4:15am!!! After a brief layover at SeaTac, we boarded our flight to Atlanta.It's been a busy two weeks since we finished our contract. After leaving Crescent City, we joined my mom and her porche club in Yosemite National Park for a few days of hiking and visiting. What a fun group of people! And my favorite time of year to be in the valley. Mat and I joked that it was our Yosemite Boot Camp since we're not in the best of hiking shape right now. We hiked to Yosemite Point, a viewpoint to the right of the top of Yosemite Falls, and another day hike to the base of Half Dome. The cables weren't up so we hiked to where the cables start before turning around and heading back down. We also walked around the valley floor a lot. We saw a couple critters, including two coyotes one morning and a black bear in the field next to the Ahwahnee Lodge on our last night. After Yosemite, we house/dog sat Mat's mom's house/dog for a few days. We were able to get our camper squared away for storage and make sure we have all our gear together. After that, we spent the weekend in Marin county for Mat's dad's wedding, after which we spent some time with Mat's brother's family. So it's been a busy few weeks!We landed in Atlanta at 6:30pm local time. It took longer than expected to get our one checked bag, and just missed the MARTA red line so we had to wait 20 mins for the next one. We rode MARTA to Sandy Springs Station, arriving at 8:30pm. We chose this station since there are many hotels around and an REI with canister fuel very close by. Unfortunately, the REI was already closed but Dick's Sporting Goods was still open and had the fuel canister we needed. We picked one up and twalked to a nearby hotel where we had a reservation. We ordered some dinner, reorganize our packs, and passed out.",,View Entry,"May 10, Tue",0

Mid day - Clear with a slight breeze, 79°FEvening - Clear and calm, 66°F

We woke at 7:40am feeling well rested after sleeping the whole night. Continental breakfast and final pack up before hailing an Uber. It cost the two of us a total of $65 for an Uber ride from Sandy Springs to Amicolola State Park Visitor Center. We tipped the driver well for driving us so far. We were dropped off at the Amicolola State Park Visitor Center at 11:00am and sat at the picnic area to eat some lunch. We then headed into the visitor center to sign the registration book and get our AT tags. The visitor center building is under reconstruction so a temporary visitor center was set up in one of those mobile buildings in the parking lot. The park employees were super nice. We got our AT tags, Mat is number 3286 and I'm number 3288! (Another hiker already present got in line behind Mat so he was assigned number 3287) The employees notified us that the stone arch at the original Visitor Center building is still accessible so we walked the 0.1 miles down to get some pics. 
We started walking at 11:45am, embarking on the 8.2-mile Approach Trail to the Official AT Southern Terminus on top of Springer Mountain. The Approach Trail was nice with a fun focus on Amicolola Falls, a 729ft cascade over layered limestone rock. There were many day hikers but everyone was super nice; must be that southern hospitality! Once above the falls, the crowds thinned and we enjoyed pleasant walking in quiet forests, the birds chirping, and a slight breeze to keep the temperature very comfortable.
We saw many large millipedes through the rest of the afternoon. Plenty of little wildflowers we've never seen before and a few birds. We reached the top of Springer Mountain - the official start of the AT - at 4:30pm. We snapped some photos of the plaques before moving on. We enjoyed further forest walking, stopping at Chester Creek for a foot-soak. Around 7:00pm we came upon an empty campsite and decided to call it a day. 

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Rain Hopper - while walking through the forest with calf-high vegetation, we heard what sounded like giant rain drops, yet there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Upon closer inspection, I noticed tiny half-inch long grasshoppers jumping out of our way and into the vegetation!Mat: Weigh-In - The Amicolola State Park Visitor Center has a scale where hikers can weigh their packs. Mat was strategizing how he was going to make his pack as light as possible for the ""Weigh-In"" (minimal water in bottles since the first water source was just a few miles up trail, eat his lunch before checking in, making sure anything carried in his pockets was not in the pack, etc). We arrived at the temporary mobile building Visitor Center to find they don't have the scale set up at their temporary location!

Having slept in until 8:30 AM, we didn't start walking until 9:40 AM. A Wood Thrush serenaded us while we packed up. We love the thrush calls on the west coast so it was cool to hear an East Coast Thrush! Not too long after starting, we can upon the junction for Long Creek Falls. It was 0.1miles off trail so we ventured down to it. I'm glad we did, it was a pretty waterfall and no one was there! More walking in lovely forests with lots of chirping birds. The forests are very pretty here. The ground is covered in low, calf-high plants of various species. Interspersed in this ground cover are various tree-bushes about 10-20ft tall. Overarching these is a tall canopy of hardwoods about 50ft high. (Sorry, I don't know trees very well so I can't tell you what they are!) It lends distinctive layers to the forest, which is neat. The many birds hang out in that upper canopy so they're hard to see but, oh man, can you hear them! It leads me to wonder what the dinosaurs must have sounded like. These little birds can make such loud and complex calls and, since they're the descendants of dinosaurs, I can only imagine dinosaurs had similar ability but way louder; possibly loud enough to deafen human ears!
We stopped briefly at Hawk Mountain Shelter to use the privy. A few other hikers were there. We've seen plenty of other hikers out here but so far everyone has been weekend hikers. At Horse Gap, there was an older gentleman asking for spare water so we gave him a little over half a liter. Climbing up from Horse Gap, we came upon a little snake. It wasn't venomous since the head shape was narrow. We later identified it as a young Pairie King Snake. We stopped for lunch on top of Sassafras Mountain, Ovenbirds calling back and forth above us.
After lunch, we continued on. We're starting to see squirrels now. They're quite skittish and hurl themselves up to two feet onto any branch or tree as soon as they hear us approach. Funny to see them clear such distances! We stopped for a break at Justus Creek. We saw some sort of black salamander after leaving the creek. I'm impressed by how many wildflowers are in bloom right now: purple, white, yellow, pink. There are Flame Azalea trees in bloom; the neon tangerine flowers provide a striking contrast to all the green. Our next break was at a viewpoint on Ramrock Mountain. It was the first, unobstructed view we've had since starting. The view itself wasn't impressive but having spent all day in the trees it was very exciting to be able to see out 100s of miles!
Coming around Black Mountain we watched an owl glide silently though the canopy above. Unfortunately it moved too quickly for us to really see it for an identification. We arrived at Woody Gap at 7:00pm and took advantage of the many amenities of the trailhead: trash bins, pit toilet, etc. We dropped down a side trail to some water, once again spooking an owl that moved too quickly for a proper identification. After filling up to capacity for a dry camp, we entered Blood Mountain Wilderness, my first East Coast wilderness area! Our plan was to go a campsite a mile up trail but a large group was there when we arrived so we started the climb up to Preacher's Rock. We reached the large slab of granite about 8:30PM. We found a nice, flat campsite on the western side of the ridge, which worked out perfectly because a strong breeze was coming from the east. We set up our tent then went to the rock to enjoy our dinner. When we came back to the tent, there was one of those millipedes on my food sack. I don't think this would be a good trail for cowboy camping! Now I'll always check my shoes for millipedes before putting them on in the morning! 

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Ovenbird - Mat laughed when I told him the name of the birds calling out during our lunch break. He said, ""That's your favorite bird!"" then launches into a mock conversation: ""[Normal voice] 'Kalyn, what's your favorite bird?' [switches into a falsetto] 'Any bird that's in the oven!!'""Mat: Toad Shade - Mat spotted a very interesting looking wildflower today. It looked like a very squat trillium with a very dark purple, almost black, flower. We looked it up and discovered it is a Toad Shade, aka Toad Trillium. Mat liked the name, saying ToadShade sounded like the name of a minor boss in a Nintendo video game!

The wind blew steadily all night, bringing in many clouds. It's supposed to rain today but current forecasts postponed the rain until tomorrow. There are some pretty dark clouds in the sky so we'll see. We spent the morning walking along a forested ridge with a few ups and downs. We passed by lots of trillium, centipedes, and millipedes. The ridge walking culminated with Blood Mountain, one of Georgia's ""4000ers"". It's sprinkled on and off on our final push to the top. We reached the summit at 12:30pm. Even though the sky was overcast, we could see the land lay out below in every direction. It was pretty neat! It was also very crowded, and pizza was calling us from Mountain Crossings below, so we continued on.
We reached Neels gap and the famous Mountain Crossings gear shop at 1:50pm. It's a very cool stone building, looks like it was built by the CCC. Inside is a fantastic gear shop and hiker resupply. Plus you can purchase microwaveable foods to eat, charge your electronics, and purchase a shower. We both purchased a Baron's pizza, which the employees heated in their oven for us. The employees were super nice! We talked a little bit with one of the employees, trailname Creep, a triple crowner. There were quite a few hikers there so we chatted with some of them. We met Jim, the hiker who started the same day as us and got the number between us. We also chatted with a group of three ladies who looked to be in their 60s. They were day-hiking a large sectional of the AT. One of them is from Spain so we talked about the Camino de Santiago. It rained a bit while we were hanging out but then the clouds cleared out and we enjoyed blue skies.
After resupplying, we continued on at 3:50PM. We eventually climbed up to Cow Mountain, an open granite slab with views to the west. On our navigation app, comments from prior years warn of a Copperhead nest under the only rock on the open granite slab, but no comments were made for this year. I've never seen a copperhead before so I grabbed my headlamp, put it on spotlight mode, and dropped down to my hands and knees from a safe distance. Unfortunately no copperheads. We heard thunder rumble so decided to get down off the open granite before the thunderhead came. A steep descent to Tesnatee Gap before immediately climbing up the side of Wildcat Mountain, then a drop back down to Hogpen Gap. We were grabbing water at Hogpen Gap when we saw some nice open campsites a ways back from the road. We figured, even though it's a little close to the road than we normally camp, we can't see the road from the campsites, it's not a busy road, and we were in a nice, low, uniformly forested area if a lightening storm comes in overnight. We decided to set up camp here rather than continue climbing the next ridge. Some rain fell just as we were pulling out our tent. We waited out the heaviest of the downpour before setting up. With the humidity, once things get wet they don't dry out!

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Automatic windshield wiper - Mat laughed at me for immediately deploying my umbrella as soon as I felt some rain drops. He said I was like an automatic windshield wiper!Mat: Offline Google lens - I was wondering about the name of a shrub-tree that looked a lot like manzanita but different. Mat says, ""It's an Eastern Manzanita."" When I asked him if he just puts 'Eastern' in front of everything, he responded, ""Yes. If we're hiking in eastern states then everything has the same name with 'Eastern' in front; if we're hiking in the southwest, just put 'desert' in front; if hiking in the mountains put 'mountain' in front. Then you know it's name! I'm like your offline Google Lens!""

8:50AM start this morning. As we crossed hwy 348, a car slow to a stop and honked at us, then drove to the parking lot. It was the group of ladies we talked to yesterday! Today they were hiking from Neels Gap to Hogpen Gap so we won't see them on trail, unfortunately. But it was sure fun to run into them before we set off in different directions; perfect timing! In the parking lot, a gentleman came up to us and offered us some baked goods from their BnB in town. He cave us a baggie with two blueberry pancakes - still warm - and a baggie with a piece of cinnamon walnut raisin bread. We just ate breakfast so we split the warm pancakes and saved the bread for later. People are so nice!
Walking was pretty level this morning and we made good time to Low Gap Shelter where we stopped to use the privy and eat an early lunch. The cinnamon walnut bread was delicious! Three older gentlemen arrived while we were eating, Blind Eagle, Uncle Jim, and Tired Guy. They're from Alabama and have section hiked most of the entire AT. It was fun chatting with them. Continuing on, we enjoyed luxurious walking on an abandoned road: level with no rocks or roots, gradual climbs and descents. It allowed us to cruise at a nice clip, despite the lack of air movement today. Humidity is much more tolerable when there's a breeze! We met Mike, a thru-hiker who is hoping to Yo-yo the trail. We leapfrogged with him the rest of the day. 
We made it to Blue Mountain Shelter around 2:30PM and stopped for a break. A group of section hikers were finishing their section hike at Unicoi gap. When they found out it was only 2 miles away, they booked a hotel room in Helen and proceeded to unload all their extra food on us and Mike. We're talking Mountain House meals, bars, electrolyte drinks, the works! We were astonished but gladly took it all! It was very nice of them! 
Rain started sprinkling on our descent down to Unicoi Gap. Climbing back up the other side to the top of Rocky Mountain, the heavens opened up and it rained solidly for a good hour. Eventually it stopped and the sun came back out. Mat has a head cold and was feeling tired so we called it quits at a nice campsite on the ridge before Tray Mountain. We listened to the songbirds scurry back to their nests and an owl start hooting in the distance. Rain came back in after dark and we fell asleep listening to it patter against the tent.

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Thunder Burp - Mat thought my burp was thunder while we were laying in the tent listening to the rain fall.Mat: ER senses tingling - while leapfrogging with Mike, he warned us a group of hikers we recently passed were planning to party at the next campsite until late at night and had already started drinking. We thanked him for the heads up. Mat then says, ""I had a suspicion when we passed those guys, my ER senses were tingling.""

Town day! That means we start earlier than usual, 8:30AM this morning. We stopped in at Tray Mountain Shelter for water then continued on. Fairly descent walking this morning without too many ups and downs, occasional views out to the surrounding hills. An inversion layer settled in so clouds obscurred the lowlands. It was humid though, not much air movement. We met Craig and Matt, they looked related to each other. Matt is section hiking to NC, Craig is considering doing the whole trail. We chatted for a bit while walking before pulling ahead. We reached Dick's Creek Gap just before 3:00pm and started hitching. Lots of traffic but not great visibility or room for someone to pull over. Some section hikers finished not too long after we did and were piling into their cars. One guy had extra room so he gave us a ride into Hiawassee. His name is Rusty and today they completed all of Georgia. He's already completed North Carolina and Tennessee and a bit of Virginia, so about 500 miles! 
The road down from the pass wound through beautiful farmhouses to Lake Chutage, lined with huge, fancy houses. Hiawassee is a cute little town and hiker-friendly. We checked into the Hiawassee Budget Inn, started laundry and showered right away. After four days in the humidity, I think that was the best shower I've ever had!! Once we were all cleaned up, we headed over to Zaxby's Fried Chicken, a local chain. I got a sweet tea because I have to try it. I think it gave me diabetes because I couldn't stop drinking water afterwards! Spent the rest of the afternoon checking in with family and planning the next couple sections.

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Bird poop -I felt something fall on top of my head while hiking but thought it was a piece of plant debris. When I got to the hotel and looked in the mirror I found it was a small bird poop! It wasn't very noticeable but it was there. Luckily I get to shower today!Mat: Hiker Box - Mat scoped out the hiker box at the hotel and found a jetboil pot! We already have a pile of stuff to mail home so Mat included the pot in to mail home. Quite a nice score!

We ate and packed up a bit. It was 10:00AM at this point and still had to mail stuff home and resupply at the grocery store a half mile away. Check out is at 11:00. Can we do it? Let's do it! We walked briskly to the supermarket where Mat continued next door to the post office to mail home a box and I headed into the market to start shopping. Mat joined me to complete our shopping. As I started the check-out process, Mat went over to the outdoor gear shop across the street to pick up a few items we needed. We met up a few blocks towards the hotel. We got back to the hotel at 10:50 and spent the last 10 minutes repackaging our food. Done exactly at 11:00AM! We walked to the end of town and started hitching. Snagged ourselves a ride in less than a minute, a nice gentleman who was going home from the plant nursery but decided to give us a ride instead! He was super nice, worked for FedEx for a couple of decades and lived all over the country for it.We arrived at the trailhead by 11:25AM. We sat at the picnic tables for a good 30 mins preparing ourselves for the climb up. At least it wasn't humid today! A nice breeze lent movement to the air, which improves things immensely! Our legs felt like lead at first but then they warmed and loosened up, allowing us to putt along. We saw a large Garter Snake on the climb up. We also started seeing these large black butterflies with iridescent blue lower wings; very pretty!We reached the Georgia/North Carolina border around 4:30pm. A wooden placard looked handmade and brand new! We snapped some pics of it, wondering how long it will be before someone vandalizes it. Once in North Carolina, we had some steep climbs. But the temps were cooling so we were chugging away. Making our way up the second climb, we moved in silence but then stopped to recover our breath. I made a comment about the steep climb and a voice calls out from the woods, ""You're almost there!"" It was Craig! He and Matt were taking in a nice view from a viewpoint just above us but obscurred from our sight. I thought it was funny to have a voice of encouragement come out of seemingly nowhere! We hung out with them for a bit while taking in the view. Craig was carrying Larry the Log, a hug chunk of a branch that must have weighed 25lbs!! I guess there is a society of hikers who will pass on Larry the Log until it gets to Maine. Phew, don't think I want to test my hip with that cumbersome weight. Luckily he didn't try to pass it off on us!We eventually carried on, reaching Muskrat Creek Shelter at 7:30PM. Mat used the privy while I chatted with the two hikers there, a southbound section hiker named Cheesehead and a northbound section hiker named Karma Trekker. We grabbed water then headed back over to a nice campsite we spied on Raven Rock Ridge just before the shelter. We ate dinner as we watched a lovely sunset over Lake Chutage below. Two Barred Owls started calling back and forth at each other as darkness gathered.Reading the comments on our navigation app for tomorrow's camping locations, people are warning of significant bear activity at Standing Indian Shelter, Carter Gap Shelter, and Betty Creek Gap Campground over the last week. Multiple food bags where stripped down from where they were hung, bear canisters stolen and rolled down the hill, even a couple of Ursacks chewed through! Apparently the bears aren't afraid of humans or even dogs. We are carrying only our Ursacks minor, a bag that repels rodents but is useless against bears. Technically we can hang it to protect against bears but it sounds like these bears have no problem tearing down a bear hang. Our best option is to walk through the entire bear section to a campsite far beyond. Betty Creek Gap, the farthest of the problem campsites, is 16.3 miles from us so we'll set an alarm to wake early to make the miles needed to camp safely.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn -Mat: Gap Hater - All the gaps are signed.

It was definitely nice to be in my sleeping bag and not be overheating! With our alarm, we were hiking by 7:50AM. It was cool walking at this time of morning. As we rounded the slopes of Yellow Mountain, past Water Oak Gap, we saw a mama black bear and four cubs in the bushes downslope from the trail. They ran off quickly! Not much further, we came upon Karma Trekker. We chatted with her while hiking, asking her advice on the best time to visit Big Bend National Park in her home state of Texas. She's already hiked the Smokey Mountains and is now finishing up her section hike up to the Smokies. She's done a lot of hiking all over the country! We reached Standing Indian Shelter at 10:00AM. It's a nice shelter but it is plagued by the problem bears. We had a first-lunch (or would it be second breakfast?) and I used the privy. It's so nice to have the privys on the AT to keep all the hiker poops in one, contained area. With the AT being so popular (>3000 nobo hikers alone!!), one would come across poop bombs all over the place if the privys weren't here. The extra bonus is we don't have to pack out our toilet paper! From Standing Indian Shelter, we kicked it into gear up a lovely graded climb to the top of Standing Indian Mountain. Dropping down the backside, the trail traverses in a large loop along ridges of the Southern Nantahala Wilderness. Lots of birds were singing so I used my ""Bird Shazam"" app - Merlin - to ID a bunch. We took a break and second-lunch at a cute little creeklet just beyond Kelby Creek. We talked briefly to a couple from Vermont who were here to backpack a section. Unfortunately they didn't have the Far Out (navigation) app warning of all the bear activity. We gave them a heads up so they were considering how far they would have to hike to stay bear-free. Karma Trekker passed us. Then, as we were packing up, an older gentleman in all hunter orange came southbound, said his name was Almost There and he had thru-hiked the AT in the 70s. He said he was thru hiking it again but sobo. Must be flip-flop hiking SoBo because I know Katahdin at the northern terminus hasn't opened yet this year.We continued on, enjoying the PCT-style graded traverse of the ridge, occasional views out of the woods to the valleys below. We crossed paths with a guy who is part of the Nantahala Hiking Club, which maintains this section of trail. He asked us if we had come upon any problems such as downed trees, etc. We told him how much we've been enjoying the North Carolina trail. They are aware of the bear problems. Apparently this particular part of North Carolina is considered a bear sanctuary where hunting bear is illegal. Every spring, the bears are hungry after their hibernation and know they can get easy food from the hiker shelters. They usually disperse by summer but it's only a matter of time before a hiker gets hurt. They're considering a couple options: they have considered putting bear lockers at the shelters but then many hikers tend to treat them as trash recepticles, which the hiker club members would then have to pack out. They've also considered opening up the sanctuary to selected hunting to thin the population and get the bears scared of humans again but then club members are concerned about a hiker getting accidentally shot. Another option would be to install bear hang poles. They would have to be strong since this bear has no problem knocking a tree over to get the bags hung from it! In any case, they are working on a solution. We finally made it past the last of the problem bear spots and took a break at the next water source. There we met Flavel, a section hiker born in Brazil but living in Charlotte. He's trying to make it to Fortuna Dam by Sunday since he has to go back to work on Monday. It was still too early to set up camp, only 5:00pm, so we continued on. We climbed up over Albert Mountain, a steep pitch of 400ft in 0.3 miles! We made it to the top by 5:30pm. What a lovely view! Since we had cell reception, Mat called a hotel in Franklin to make a reservation. A family with school-aged children burst onto the scene so we picked ourselves up and continued walking. Not long after dropping down from the fire tower we came upon the 100-mile mark made from rocks arranged on the ground. We made 100 miles!! We pulled out our phones to snap a pic. It was then we realized we hadn't taken any photos at the Albert Mountain Fire tower! Doh! We had hiked nearly 19 miles by this point and I guess we were too tired to remember to take pics! Oh well. It was still two miles to the next shelter and water so Mat scrambled off trail to collect water from a slow spring so we could dry camp. Campsites were occupied though so we followed the trail off the ridge. Luckily we found an unoccupied campsite on a little saddle above Long Creek Shelter so we set up. There are multiple bunnies around here. Generally, as a rule, we don't do big-mile days in the first few weeks of a thru-hike to allow our bodies to properly adjust and prevent injuries. But the habituated bears required us to push it today. We're going into the town of Franklin tomorrow so we can recover. We listened to the bunnies hop around on the dead leaves outside as we fell asleep.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: 100 - First 100 miles done!Mat: 20 - First 20-miler day of our AT hike!Daily steps: Elevation gain: 3967ft","Raven Rock Ridge, NC (Mile 81)

Morn - Clear and Calm, 55°FMid - Clear and breezy, 68°FEve -

Last night we were awoken by a critter walking around outside our tent. At first we were mentally preparing ourselves for how we can save our food from a bear. But after listening more closely, we realized the animal was stepping carefully, a movement bears don't generally make. At first I thought it was a deer but then we haven't seen ANY sign of deer whatsoever. It could be a cat or other small predator. That let us relax a little. But when the sound of crunching dead leaves circled around our tent, we figured we better figure out what we're dealing with (is there cougar in the Appalachians?) We flicked on the spotting beam of our headlamp and spotted what looked to be either a fox or a coyote hunting the multiple bunnies hanging around our tent. Satisfied, and with the realization that we might be woken back up by the squeals of a dying bunny, we settled back down for sleep.
The alarm went off at 7:30am and we were hiking by 8:30am to catch the 12:30pm bus at Winding Stair Gap 7.6 miles away. The bus is sent from the town of Franklin three times per day to pick up and drop off AT hikers during the busy season. Only $5 per hiker too. The trail continued with yesterday's nicely graded traverse, this time following the ridge down. Birds and squirrels and chipmunks were scurrying about. We stopped at Rock Gap Shelter to use the privy. Rock Gap parking lot isn't much further beyond and has trash bins. Apparently this is also a stop for the bus into Franklin but we already missed the morning bus here and had already planned to catch the noon bus at Winding Stair Gap so we continued on. Past Wallace Gap, an Indigo Bunting flew in front of us, it's bright blue feathers catching our attention. What a pretty bird! At the next water source, we ran into Flavel again. He had taken the last tent spot at Long Branch Shelter last night so it was a good thing we found a place to dry camp last night otherwise we would have had to hike a lot more miles since Long Branch was completely full! We also met Trail Ambassador Grandpa and his wife, they were super friendly.
We reached Winding Stair Gap just before noon and waited for the shuttle. We were surprised that we were the only ones there. We thought there would be at least a few other hikers looking to go into town. At 12:30PM, the shuttle arrived, full of hikers getting dropped off at Rock Gap: Broadway, Dreamer, Pincushion, Oksana, and Smiles. Luckily two people disembarked so we jumped on. The driver then proceeded to Rock Gap where the whole bus unloaded except for us. Outside the bus, we saw many hikers we've chatted with over the last few days including Mike and Karma Trekker. Nobody got on the bus so we were the only ones brought down to Franklin. Luckily the bus driver stopped at Winding Stair Gap again because we saw Mat's ground cloth on the parking lot ground, his camp sandels tucked inside! The bus driver opened the door and let him grab his items. They must have fallen off his pack when we loaded! When we reached town about 1:00pm, it was still too early to check into the hotel so we had the driver drop us off at the Ingles grocery store in town to buy our resupply. Ingles is the most common grocery store along the trail, at least in the south, so we signed up for an Ingles card to get the sale prices.
After the grocery store, we walked over to old town. There are cute little shops and garden squares. They had a huge sign up welcoming hikers of 2022; we signed the banner, adding our names to all the others. We stopped in at Wells Fargo so I could withdraw some money in small bills needed for shuttles and laundry and hotel tips. While walking to our hotel we spotted a cardinal in the bushes, such pretty birds! We reached our hotel about 2:00pm. A hiker we passed earlier was sitting outside the office. We recognized her from a couple days back. She wasn't having any fun and was, as she put it, ""going to have a different adventure."" I liked her attitude, she wasn't enjoying the AT so she was going to do something different but still adventurous. She gave us her fuel canister since she didn't need it anymore and we were almost out. We thanked her for the fuel canister and then checked into our room. We were famished by this point so we quickly showered and then walked back into town for a late lunch at the Motor Company Cafe. It was super delicious and they had amazing looking Banana Splits and other sundaes. We order a chocolate chip cookie sundae but they were out of cookie crumbles so we ordered a banana split but they were out of bananas. The waitress told us the hikers had cleaned them out over the weekend and haven't gotten their next shipment yet! So we ordered a fudge sundae to split. Oh man was it tasty!! 
On our way back to the hotel, we stopped in at Outdoor 76, a very nice gear shop that has a hiker lounge in their basement with showers, laundry, and pool tables; super cool! We didn't need to use their facilities but they did have one last pair of the woman's Hoka Speedgoats size 8.5. Mat switched to Hokas a few months back while working and has raved about them. I started the trail with my Solomon's XA Pro 3D V8 (what kind of shoe name is that?!) which only had 100 miles of use on them when I started. Every day my feet feel pounded, which normally I would have just written off as my feet getting used to hiking all day. But Mat's feet hasn't felt pounded at all since getting his new shoes, so I've been very tempted to try them myself. It's stupid, really, to switch shoes in the middle of a hike, especially when the original shoes aren't causing any problems. But I have a hunch this might be a good change. This last pair of Hokas were a bright barbie pink, which somewhat clashed with my more orangey-pink skirt and visor. Mat laughed at me for being all pink now. But at least my shirt is teal! The store gave us a thru-hiker discount so that was awesome! While parusing the store, Karma Trekker and two other thru-hikers we breifly met came through the door. Karma Trekker wasn't originally planning to come into town, but yesterday's long hike to skip bear country gave her some shin splint pain so she is going in on a room with the other two to rest her legs. I wore my new shoes back to the hotel. We did laundry, repackaged our food, and relaxed. I have caught Mat's head cold so now it's my turn to feel tired. Pizza delivery for dinner!

We bought some focaccia bread, cookies, and croissants to pack out plus some scones and tarts to eat this morning. They were super delicious! Check out at 11:00AM then parked ourselves in front of the hotel office waiting for the shuttle to arrive. Another hiker, Connor, was there; he's hoping to go all the way to Maine. He's a contractor pipe layer and recently finished his contract in Portland, OR. He too was having foot fatigue and bought a new pair of Hokas from Outfitter 76 in town. I was about to toss my old shoes in the hiker box (they were still in relatively good condition, only having 200 miles on them; someone may be able to use them) when Conor informed us there is a parking lot with trash bins available in 10 miles. I followed his lead and packed up my shoes instead. I can hike in my new shoes for 10 miles with climbs and descents to see if they cause any issues. If they do, I'll switch back to my old pair; if not, I can toss my old pair in the trash at that point.The watch hit 11:50AM and we started to get nervous. Yesterday, the bus driver said he makes his rounds starting at 11:30am with the goal of leaving town at noon. Maybe we misunderstood the driver? We started looking at Uber prices but at 11:59am the bus rolled up! We were dropped off at the trailhead by 12:25pm. Mat and I immediately started up the climb from Winding Staircase Gap. During our climb, we saw two deer. We weren't sure what kind they were, Mat thought they were white tail but they didn't raise their tails as they ran from us. Later, when we had a spot of cell reception, we found that white tail are the only deer in Appalachia.We passed by a large group of day hikers. Two different people said to us ""Hey! Good to see you again!"" Only one of those two people looked closer and said, ""Oh wait, you're not who I thought you were."" Apparently Mat and I have some doppelgangers around? Further up the climb towards Wayah Bald, we came upon Karma Trekker and the two other ladies, Gadget Gal (or GG) and Penny (I think her trailname was Deitris?) We chatted with them a bit until we pulled ahead, we'll probably see them at the NOC tomorrow. We reached Wayah bald and viewpoint at 5:15pm. At the trash bins, I had to make my final shoe decision. My new shoes were comfortable so far, didn't cause any issues with my knees or hip, and my feet didn't feel as pounded! The Solomons ceremoniously went into the trash. The Wayah Lookout Tower was cool. We could see down into Franklin, Standing Indian Mountain, and the ridges we walked to connect with Albert Mountain. To the north we were able to make out Clingmans Dome, located within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the highest point on the entire AT. After a nice break, we continued on, filling our water at the next spring on trail so we could find a spot to dry camp. Our typical routine to find a campsite back West is to walk until about 6:00pm, then we look at the maps to see if there is any flat terrain or water sources coming up. At the next water source, we fill enough water for dinner, breakfast, and to make it to the first water source of the morning. Then we hike until we reach the flat terrain. At this point, Mat will set off from the trail, going out about 100 or so yards to find a spot clear and flat enough to pitch our tent. On the Appalachian Trail, we follow the same routine except, because the woodland is pretty dense, or is covered in poison ivy (actually haven't seen any since leaving Georgia, thank God!) we don't cut off trail. But, there are many campsites that line the trail with room for one or two tents. Some are indicated on the navigation app as actual campgrounds (these ones almost always have at least one camper in them every night), some are described in comments for other landmarks (these ones have a 50-50 chance of being occupied any given night), and then there are ones not indicated in the app at all and these ones are usually always empty. These are the ones we generally go for. After filling up water, we just walk until we find an unoccupied campsite to use. All these campsites have fire rings, which we have no desire to use. In the west, we usually dismantle any fire ring we see that is far away from a water source or road but out here it rains so frequently that I don't think wildfires are an issue so we don't mind them, except for all the trash left in them.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Two Pair - wore one pair of shoes and carried the other!Mat: DoppelgangerDaily steps: 29,765Elevation gain: 3120ft","Franklin, NC via Winding Staircase Gap (Mile 109.4)

Woke early to the sun rising through the clouds in the east. We were hiking by 7:50am. We trekked along all morning, reaching Wesser Bald lookout tower at 11:35AM. We dropped our packs and climbed to the top for views out, we could see the head of Fontana reservoir and the ridge of the Smokey Mountains. We stopped for lunch at the Wesser Bald Shelter, listening to a Wood Thrush. After the shelter, the trail took us along a narrow ridgeline which abruptly ended and we descended down a steep, rocky face. I had to check my navigation app a few times to make sure we were still on the AT! We dropped 3000ft over the next 4.5 miles, the thermometer rising as we lost elevation. On the way down, we entered into blooming Mountain Laurel. The blooms are so pretty and interesting: like mini white, or light pink, satellite dishes but more octigonal in shape, with tiny pink designs inside the ""bowl"". I think they're supposed to smell good but I caught Mat's head cold so I can't smell much with my nasal congestion. We also saw a Scarlet Tanager, a super pretty bright red bird. 
We reached the Nahtahala Outdoor Center, or the NOC, just before 3:00PM. The NOC is a complex straddling the Nahtahala River. On the southern shore is an outfitter, a little market, and a restaurant; on the northern shore there is a bar with food and lots of chairs and tables. The two sides are connected with a pedestrian bridge. There are cabins and bunk rooms available to rent as well as shower and laundry facilities. The AT goes right over the pedestrian bridge so the NOC does cater to hikers. But it's more known for it's white water rafting and kayaking on the Nantahala River. The NOC hosts world competitions on the rapids just east of the pedestrian bridge, and offers classes as well as guided rafting trips. There were quite a lot of people there watching the rafters float by. It was 87°F and very hot! We stopped at the outfitters to get Mat's visor he ordered. We talked with a hiker named H.W., based on his initials. We ran into Broadway, Pincushion, and Oksana lounging in the adirondack chairs lining the north side is the river. We sat for a moment, chatting with them. Pincushion is out here attempting his Triple Crown like we are but his fiancee, Oksana, is on her first hike. So he's taking it slow to ensure she is having a good time. Both are from Oregon. Pincushion is a family friend of Jonathan Ley, creator of the CDT maps we used in 2006, we also know Jonathan and he was the photographer of our wedding. Such a small hiker world! Broadway, from Missouri, hiked from mile 750 north to Katahdin last year and is back this year to hike from Springer Mountain to mile 750. We also met Nick, a nice fellow just graduated from college with a degree in plant biology and came out right after graduation to hike the AT. He wants to be a park ranger some day.
Broadway joined us to get a burger from the bar and we brought our meals back to the adriondack chairs to eat. We stood in the river to try to cool down but there were too many nice families around to warrant a full-on thru-hiker trash swim. So we just stuck to the shade like civilized adults. Eventually, Pincushion and Oksana started off up the climb but it was still way too hot for our taste. Broadway was offered a fourth spot in a cabin + guided rafting trip tomorrow so she's sticking around. Mat and I went back to the south shore and I stayed with our charging battery bricks in front of the Outfitter while Mat ran across the street to pick up a few resupply items from the market. He brought me an ice cream sandwich. With our chores all done, it was 5:30pm but still felt too hot to hike so we wandered back over to the north shore where one can easily access the water. We sat with our feet in the water, a local border collie named Jesse made friends with me so I would throw his frisbee for him. He was cute! 6:15pm rolled around and we finally felt it was cool enough to start the eight-mile, 3800ft climb up out of the Nantahala River gorge. Nick was sticking around until 8:00pm in hopes his last package would arrive today. 
We started the big climb up. Luckily it wasn't too long before we were high enough to catch the breeze, the sun behind the mountain. We reached the water source a few miles in. H.W. and Pincushion & Oksana already had their tents pitched. It was a very cool area: it was a large alcove shaded by tall hardwoods but no underbrush, a large outcropping of cool rocks protruding from the back. The spring was about 0.1 mile downhill from the alcove but it bubbles up from under a tree. It was a very neat place; it definitely had a presence. We filled enough water for a dry camp and continued further up ridge, going as far as we dared; the climb was easier in the cool evening but there also weren't very many camping spots. We found a nice flat area at 8:45PM. Time to throw down and eat! As we were prepared for bed, Mat noticed a firefly flickering outside. It was only one, and it seemed to be flying around kind of drunkenly, probably trying to get the hang of what it needed to do. Still it was very cool!!

We hit the trail at 8:25AM, resuming our climb up to Cheoah Bald. It was already warm but there were some clouds in the sky to block direct sun through the trees. H.W., who had passed our tent as we were lazying about, was having a snack break on Grassy Knob false summit. We chatted a bit but then continued to the Sassafras Shelter to get water and use the privy. We continued to leapfrog with H.W. until we reached the top of Cheoah Bald at 11:30AM, 3865ft above the NOC. The views were lovely: multiple layers of wooded ridges, puffy white clouds preluding to the thunderstorm forecasted to occur this afternoon. After a little break, we said our goodbyes to H.W., who we'll probably see in Fontana tomorrow, and start the descent off Cheoah. We traversed wooded ridges the rest of the afternoon. Around 2:00PM, the booming of thunder began, lasting for about half an hour. But rain never came. Dropping down to Stecoah Gap, a hiker named Jack came up behind us. He and Mat were Twinsies!! They were both wore a t-shirt of the same shade of blue, black shorts, red Hoka Speedgoats, and white HMG backpack. The only difference between their looks was the red hat Jack wore compared to Mat's grey visor. It was hilarious! He was slack packing NOC to Fontana Dam in one day so he was moving fast with a light pack today but I hope we see him again in the future because I forgot to get a picture of it.More wooded ridgelines. We stopped at Cody Gap to chat with a hiker named Snailmail. He's a retired mailman from Connecticut. Last year he hiked from Harper's Ferry to Katahdin and he's back this year to hike Springer Mountain to Harper's Ferry. After loading up on water, we trekked another 0.7 miles to a dry camp on the ridge, setting us up for a 7.5-mile hike into Fontana Dam tomorrow. Eastern Wood Thrush serenaded us while dusk gathered. We've taken to listening to the Green Tunnel Podcast while eating our dinners. Karma Trekker recommended it to us and it's good. Each episode takles a different historical aspect of the Appalachian Trail: how the trail came to be, or how the shelters came about, or the history of trail food. Very fun to listen to! After dark, we saw more fireflies tonight! There were some up in the trees that would do a quick flash (like a camera flash), and there were some along the grass that glowed continuously as they moved along. They moved the same speed as a person so it was kind of eerie, like a 2ft tall spirit walking by. So fascinating! We also saw lightening flashes NE of us but heard no thunder so the storm must be far away.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Pub Mac - I threw a bunch of bacon bits into my Annie's Mac & Cheese and told Mat I was having a fancy Pub Mac & Cheese.Mat: TwinsieDaily steps: 39,723Elevation gain: 4665ft","Near Grassy Gap (Mile 140)

Started hiking at 8:15AM. We did our typical stop at the next shelter to use the privy. Long descent down to Fontana Dam. As we neared the bottom of our descent, we came upon a large, black snake over three feet long. We looked at it for a while, waiting for it to move off trail. Eventually it obliged and we continued on, discussing what kind of snake it might be. It didn't have a triangle head, but it did shimmy it's tail against the dead leaves, producing a low, muted buzz since it didn't have a rattle. Not half a mile later, we came upon a second one! This one did not want to move despite our attempts to scare it off. Instead we gave it a wide berth as we cut off trail up against some rocks to the left. It didn't move while we maneuvered around it but, after we were past, it did cut off trail towards the rocks. Maybe it's nest was in the rocks? [Later looked it up, they we Black Rat Snakes!]
At 11:40AM, we reached the parking lot of the Fontana Dam Marina. It was definitely too early to think about checking into the lodge so we walked down onto the dock where the marina store is located at the far end. We purchased some frozen tamales and cold gatorade for lunch, then proceeded to buy our resupply items while our lunch was being microwaved. They have a cool deck out back for people to sit and look out on the water so we enjoyed our lunch there, watching the Chimney Swallows twist and turn over the smooth lake surface. At about 1:00pm, we wandered back up to the parking lot, where a landline phone was located, and called the shuttle. A van was there to pick us up in no time. The driver was nice and gave us a tour of the resort grounds. The resort is huge with multitudes of activities: huge fire pits, swimming pool with a 'float river', tennis courts, mini golf course, frisbee golf course, bike rentals. Of course none of this stuff was open because it's not even memorial day and the kids still have a few weeks of school. I can imagine it gets packed in the summer time! He drove us up to the lodge to check if our room was ready. It won't be ready until 4:00pm so the driver brought us down to the laundromat. We started our laundry and sat on the chairs on the large deck. The general store and ice cream parlor, which the laundromat was attached to, wasn't open for the season yet. It was slightly eerie sitting in the middle of this large resort that was pretty much empty on a Sunday afternoon. But we'll take it! Especially since rain started to fall as we got our load started.
After laundry, there was a break in the rain so we trucked it up the hill to the lodge. They weren't budging on their 4:00pm check-in time so we hung out in the beautiful lobby. Pincushion and Oksana were there waiting for their room as well. Mat and I went out on the deck to listen to the thunder boom and watch the rain fall. We purchased our permits for Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the lady at the front desk was kind enough to print them for us. Finally we got into our room at 4:00pm, at least our laundry and resupply was already done! Showered then lounged until 6:00PM when we wandered down to the restaurant for dinner with Pincushion and Oksana. We enjoyed dinner with the two of them; poor Oksana being a good sport while the rest of us swapped PCT and CDT stories. After dinner, we made it back to our room before the big thunderstorm hit. We sat on our little porch and watched the lightning flash and the torrential rain fall until after dark. Some sort of loud frogs were happy in the nearby trees.

Woke to steady rainfall. We were planning to zero in Hot Springs, NC but after looking at the hotels in that town, we realized they were more expensive for a less nice hotel room than here at Fontana Lodge. Plus it's forecasted to rain over an inch throughout the day today with improved weather tomorrow. I convinced Mat to zero here instead of Hot Springs. We walked down to the lobby to see if we could stay an extra day. Fortunately they had another night available for the hiker discount. We will have to move rooms as the 'king bed with a mountain view' room we occupied last night was specifically reserved by tonight's guests but the room across the hall was available for us to move into right away! So we moved our stuff into room 209. It had two queen beds with a deck overlooking the parking lot but we didn't care! Plus a sports car rally was going on today so Mat kept going out to the deck to look at all the fast fun cars coming and going. 
We wandered down to the breakfast buffet, which was really tasty. There was a group of older hikers all talking about how glad they were zeroing out of the rain today. We recognized H.W. but the rest we hadn't met yet. After breakfast we went back to our room to tend the gear and look at the trail info through Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which we enter tomorrow. One of the shelters said it was closed due to bear activity on the navigation app and the ATC webpage but the GSMNP webpage said there was no bear activity closures. So I called the GSMNP Backcountry Office. The ranger informed me that the Russel Field Shelter is closed and probably will remain so for a long while. All the rest of the shelters, including Mollie's Ridge, were still open but to remain vigilant as habituated bears may move to neighboring shelters. At least these shelters have bear hang cables.  
It rained steadily hard the rest of the day. We don't feel torn up: no aches and pains in the body. But we do feel tired, at least I do since this head cold is lingering. I took an hour long nap in the afternoon. Hopefully I'll kick it soon and have more energy. Mat's energy seems to have returned to him finally. We ate lunch in our hotel room, Mat eating his leftover pizza and I cracked into one of the ramens I bought yesterday for my resupply. Mat was aghast that I would want to eat ramen on a town day; he didn't believe me when I said it sounded good to eat with my head cold and I actually wanted to eat it! I'll have to pick up another one at the marina tomorrow to replace it though. It rained the rest of the day but let up enough in the evening to get down to the restaurant for dinner. Back to the hotel room to watch some shows then bedtime!

After breakfast, we started packing up our stuff. I was gathering my food together and noticed my bag of almonds was empty, the bag shredded. ""Mat, did you have some trouble when you ate all my almonds?"" I asked, amused at the job he did of the plastic baggie. ""What? I didn't eat your almonds."" He replied. That's when I noticed a couple mouse poops on the table. I apologized to Mat for falsely accusing him of eating my entire bag of almonds with such gusto and we check all our food for sign of intrusion. Fortunately, my almonds were the only things they got! We started noticing little poops in other places too. Man I did not hear the little creatures last night! We let the front desk know. The lodge is still lovely. Outside our window we saw Oksana and Pincushion walking outside and the shuttle van pull up. We hustled to get out there so the shuttle driver didn't have to do two trips. We piled in and got down to the Marina about 10:30AM. Pincushion and Oksana had to buy their resupply, I had to grab another ramen since I ate one package for lunch yesterday. Mat stayed with our packs at the bathroom. Nick was just finishing his resupply at the Marina and was heading out. I grabbed what I needed, bade farewell to Pincushion and Oksana, rejoined Mat, and we set off just after 11:00AM. Light pink azalea trees dotted the forest, as well as the occasional Flame Azaleas. We passed the Fontana Shelter, lovingly referred to as 'The Fontana Hilton' since this shelter has a solar panel with a charging station, and a brick building bathroom with flushing toilets and showers. Fanciest A.T. shelter on trail! The trail was very level, but rather humid, for the two miles to the dam. The Fontana Dam is apparently the tallest east of the Mississippi River.After crossing the dam, we walked a road to a parking lot, then entered the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We had a climb up onto the ridges. The trail grade wasn't too steep so we made good progress with our climb. Near the top, we ran into Snailmail again. We chatted briefly with him then told him we'll see him at the top. At the top we took the 0.1-mile side trail to Shuckstack Fire Tower. Up there hanging out was H.W. and a woman named Area 51, goes by 51. 51 is originally from Ohio, although she was rather recently living in Grants Pass, Oregon. She's looking to hike the whole A.T. with her dog, who is currently with 51's mother while 51 hikes the National Park. H.W. and another hiker continued on, Mat and I climbed halfway up the rickety metal tower; just enough to get us above the trees but not too high beyond. We could see the Fontana Dam, Lake, and Lodge below. Clingmans Dome, which we'll hit day after tomorrow, had a few clouds obscuring it's top. We came back down and continued on. At the fire tower trail intersection we ran into Snailmail again as he was sitting having a break. ""Are you going to go up to the fire tower Snailmail?"" We asked him. He replied, ""Why would I do that? To see green bump upon green bump?"" He cracks us up. He is from New Hampshire and has a complete disregard for the Southern AT, thinks it's too monotonous and boring, not as scenic as his home. He reams us for 'leaving beautiful Washington to hike here!' He's hilarious. He assured us that northern AT is much more enjoyable. But he's not biased, right?We leapfrogged with 51 and H.W. We reached the North Carolina/Tennessee border but there was no sign to commemorate, probably because the trail follows on top of the border for many miles. It was still cool to reach another state, though! Eventually we met Twinkle Toes and Papa Smurf, who we'd seen briefly at the lodge. Papa Smurf retired in 2020 and they planned to hike the A.T. in 2021 but postponed due to Covid. They are also doing the same kind of flip-flop as us but they are flipping in Harper's Ferry instead of Damascus. We reached Mollie's Ridge Shelter at 5:30PM; a little early for us but the next shelter in three miles is closed due to bear activity so it's six miles to the shelter after that. In the National Park, backpackers must stay in shelters or camp next to them so we can't hike until our normal time. So we pitch our tent in the furthest spot from the shelter. We ended up having 13 hikers at this shelter including us, H.W., Twinkle Toes & Papa Smurf, Nick, Area 51, Oksana & Pincushion, plus four other hikers we didn't know. The shelter is on a ridge and, through the trees, we could see the clouds below us on the Tennessee side, just like we imagined for Smoky Mountains. Unfortunately there were a lot of trees between the shelter and the view so it was hard to get a photo of it. We ate dinner in the communal area then retired to our tent to lay down around 8:00PM. Thunder boomed in the distance, probably around Clingmans Dome. At 8:30PM we heard the whistles from the shelter; it's going to be a long night if the bear is already here at 8:30PM.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Bear Whistle Sleeper - Mat thought it was hilarious that I fell asleep as the hikers at the shelter were warding off the bear with their whistles.

But I fell back asleep so I don't know how long it was out there trying. The wind picked up overnight and, at some point, I woke up to spits of rain so closed up our tent then fell right back asleep. Woke up in the morning to still more wind and spits of rain. We have a long ridge walk across the Smokey Mountains so it's going to be a blustery day.We packed up inside the tent and brought our backpacks to the shelter to reorganize and eat breakfast. Everyone was up except for Nick and Area 51. After breakfast, we ventured back out into the blustery fog to pack up the tent and hit the trail at 8:20AM. The trail eventually dropped below the clouds, still windy but at least dry, allowing us to shed our rain layers. We can upon large swathes of soft, silky green grass, all bent the same direction due to the wind and would ripple in waves. It looked really cool. The relatively level trail allowed us to reach Spence Field Shelter in good time and we stopped to eat food in the dry shelter and use the privy at 10:30AM.After about an hour we continued on. But the trail climbed back up into the clouds to go over aptly named Rocky Top and Thunder Mountains. The trail was steep and covered in slick rocks or roots. The forests opened up so on a clear day we'd have views but today we are in a very windy cloud! Dropping back down from those peaks, we reached a series of low gaps below the clouds. The clouds broke apart here so sun came through. At a gap in the brush, we could see down into Gatlinburg basking in sunshine. It appears the clouds are clustered around the National Park's backbone ridge we are traversing. At 1:30PM, we stopped at Starkey Gap to have a snack and pull out the tent to dry in the strong wind and spotty sunlight. The tent dried fair enough after about 20 mins. At 2:50PM we reached Derrick Knob Shelter, a nice little shelter protected from the wind. We stopped for a snack and to get some water. At the end of our break, Nick showed up. We continued on, climbing towards Clingmans Dome. We reached Siler's Bald Shelter around 5:20PM but it was still too early to call it quits. Plus the little shelter already looked cramped with six people inside and more from our group last night on the way. The surrounding area was tall grass, which isn't ideal to camp in, so we continued an additional 1.7 miles to the next shelter. I'm glad we did because we passed five more section hikers heading for Siler's Bald shelter from the opposite direction! We climbed up into pine trees and eventually popped out at Double Spring Gap Shelter at 6:15PM. We gathered water, found a spot for our tent that was sheltered from the wind, then went to the kitchen area to eat dinner. This shelter appeared way less crowded with actual room to sleep inside if we wanted to but we opted not to. There was a young couple, a father-son team, and one other person, all section hiking the A.T. through the Smokies. After dinner, we retreated to our tent to lay down. Phew, almost 5,600ft of climbing today, no wonder I was tired!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Double skirt - it was so blustery today I ended up wearing my rain skirt over my regular skirt all day for warmth against the wind.Daily steps: 45,032Elevation gain: 5584'","Mollie's Ridge Shelter, TN/NC (Mile 177.7)

Morn - Overcast and hard rain, 54°FMid - Overcast and rain, 55°FEve -

Today is our 15th wedding anniversary! Happy to be celebrating it out on the A.T.! 
At 2:00AM it started raining so hard I was getting wet inside the tent from splashback - where the ground is so saturated, rain just splashes up instead of getting absorbed into the ground. We tried to fortify ourselves as best we could but it didn't let up the rest of the night. We woke up in a puddle, luckily our bathtub floor of the tent kept us dry. But everything under the vestibules was soaked from splashback since it was raining so hard. I was confused as to how we got so wet in our double-walled, bathtub-floor tent. Mat assured me it was poor site selection and nothing to do with the tent itself. Last night, Mat selected a flat spot that was protected from the unrelenting wind. He knew the spot wouldn't be ideal for rain but the forecast didn't show much rain anticipated. We lost that gamble, but the other site would have had us getting pummeled by wind as well as the rain and, honestly, we would have gotten just as wet. After waking, we waited about an hour to see if the rain let up before making our move. It never did so, from inside the tent, we packed up our packs and brought them to the shelter. Everyone from the shelter was already gone! We went back for our tent and our hung food bag. The tent was already soaked and very muddy so Mat just poured his water bottles over it to rinse off most of the mud and debris. We packed up and headed out at 10:00AM.
Heavy rain came and went as we climbed up to Clingmans Dome. At 6612ft, Clingmans Dome is highest point of the A.T. We reached it at 11:20AM and climbed to the top of the observation tower to snap an anniversary selfie despite a complete lack of views. It was windy up there, too, so we didn't linger long. We hiked pretty much non-stop to Newfound Gap since there were no on-trail shelters to take a break at. We reached the gap at 2:30PM and started hitching. We didn't have our hopes up of getting a ride because it was super foggy and the trailhead is on a tight corner without much visibility anyway, not to mention we looked very soggy! But we lucked out; within minutes a truck pulling out of the trailhead parking lot pulled over for us. We didn't get his name but he is Peruvian-American and loves to hike. We asked him about the best hiking and food in Peru and told him about the mountains in Washington he should visit. 
The road down to Gatlinburg was pretty; we were below the clouds so we could see the terrain around us! The West Prong of the Little Pigeon River - which the road followed out of the mountains - was a raging, overflowing torrent! Our ride dropped us off in front of the hotel where we had a reservation and we were in our room by 3:15PM. There was a Subway next door so Mat grabbed us some lunch and we showered. We had a tricky task in front of us: the room was absolutely tiny - the smallest hotel room we've had in a long while - and everything of ours was SOAKED! We had a Tetris Pack Explosion. I was pretty discouraged, I didn't think we'd get our things to dry. The hotel didn't have laundry either so we had to hand wash our dirty clothes. Luckily we just did laundry at Fontana Lodge a few days ago so only a few items needed to be washed. But, even though drying everything out was a daunting task, we had some good tools: a heater bulb and fan in the bathroom, a heater/AC in the room, and a hairdryer! We washed everything that needed to be washed and set everything in every imaginable place we could find. We kept the vent and heater bulb on continuously in the bathroom. The heater/AC unit we would manually change back and forth - turn to heat to pull moisture from our stuff into the air, then turn to AC to have that damp air pumped out. It worked quite well! For stubborn water-logged items we'd hit them with the hair dryer. It was a lot of maintenance, but everything was mostly dry by the time we went to bed. 
We hit up Bones BBQ next door for dinner. It was a tourist joint so the food wasn't amazing but it hit the spot! After dinner, Mat took me to the Milkshake Bar down the street and bought me a milkshake to split. This place was crazy, they filled a mason jar with a milkshake of your choosing, then they topped it off with another dessert like a piece of pie, a piece of cake, an ice cream sandwich, or a bunch of cookies. We just got a simple milkshake to split. It was definitely a memorable anniversary!

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652213,"Weather:Morn -Mid - mostly cloudy and windy, 51°FEve - Mostly cloudy and calm, 49°FThe best way I can describe Gatlinburg is like Vegas for Children. The main drag is lined with arcade halls, daiquiri and milkshake bars, themed restaurants, olde-time photo lobbies, 5-D movie theaters (apparently the chairs move and wind blows on you), and entertainment museums such as movie car museum or salt & pepper shaker museum. There are gondolas and ziplines in the surrounding hillsides, and a space needle for some reason. It feels so out of place butted up against a national park featuring the highest mountains of the east coast. It's bizarre because the kind of people who would be attracted to the national park would not be interested in anything offered in Gatlinburg, and the kind of people attracted to the offerings of Gatlinburg wouldn't be that interested in what the national park has to offer. But, obviously it works, otherwise they both wouldn't be so successful (GSMNP is the most visited national park in the country!)Pretty much everything was dry this morning. Success!! A simple continental breakfast then to Walgreens to resupply since there are no grocery stores in this part of Gatlinburg. Fortunately, the Walgreens had an impressive resupply variety. We checked out of the hotel at 11:00AM and made our way towards the NOC outfitter. We had a shuttle scheduled for noon but the driver was already in the parking lot when we arrived at 11:30AM so we just hopped in and went on our way. There was another hiker hitchhiking on the drive up so our driver stopped for him. The shuttle dropped us all off at Newfound Gap. It was significantly colder up here and a cold wind blew in from the northeast. We saw a young couple who were section hiking the Smokies, whom we met in the shelter day before yesterday, and said hello. We sat down to eat our lunch of leftover brisket, salad bowls, and fruit, taking advantage of the trash bins in the parking lot. There were a lot more people here than there was yesterday, probably because it wasn't raining and you could see out. After lunch we hit the trail around 12:45PM. The first four miles northbound is a popular day-hike to Charlie's Bunion, a rocky viewpoint, so we came upon many day-hikers. We caught up to the young, section-hiking couple. ""We have something for you!"" they said when they saw us. Apparently a thru-hiker from a prior year was out day-hiking and brought a Subway foot-long sandwich to give to a thru-hiker as trail magic. He hadn't seen anyone so gave it to the section hikers. Well, the sandwich had onions in it, which they couldn't eat, but they knew we would be coming up behind them so they took it to pass it on to us! So thoughtful! We thanked them for their thoughtfulness. Mat was definitely excited as he loves subway.It started to rain heavily after about three miles in so we pulled out our umbrellas. We reached Charlie's Bunion, four miles in, at about 2:30PM. Just as we arrived at the viewpoint, the rain stopped and the clouds lifted to provide the prettiest view we've had yet on the AT. The previous hour of rain had cleared out most of the day-hikers so there were only two other couples present besides us. The rocky point opened up to steep hills covered in thick rainforest, the clouds adding drama to the scene. We could see far out into Tennessee. It was quite spectacular. We didn't want to leave so we stopped to eat our Subway snack while appreciating a view that comes so rarely on this trail. After our snack, we continued on, the trail following a relatively narrow ridgeline. Clouds rolled in and out. No more day-hikers past Charlie's Bunion. The next shelter was Peck's Corner Shelter, which was 0.4 miles off the AT. That's a long ways off trail, maybe we can push to the next one? But that one, Tricorner Knob Shelter, was an additional five miles with 1500ft of climbing. We didn't think we'd arrive at Tricorner Knob until after 8:00PM, which is too late to roll into a shelter area. So we accepted our fate and stopped on the earlier side, arriving at Peck's Corner Shelter at 6:00PM. There were six people already at the shelter, with a mother-daughter team coming in at the same time as us. There weren't very many tent sites so we picked a sloped one halfway between the shelter and the privy. As we were setting up, a Ridge Runner named Captain Caveman arrived. A Ridge Runner is an employee of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy that hikes their assigned section of trail regularly to keep an eye on things. They also provide education on leave-no-trace ethics with tips and tricks. He even taught me a trick: while in bear country, consider dry brushing your teeth to prevent smelly toothpaste being spit onto the ground. He also mentioned swallowing the toothpaste, which might be fine occasionally but I'm not sure how good that is on a regular basis. We joined Captain Caveman for dinner at the shelter. Apparently, in the National Park, while he's an employee of the ATC, they help out the national park rangers by providing basic maintenance of the privies, reporting trail conditions, and checking permits. He asked for ours, which we showed, and then we started talking about trails. He was fun to chat with. After dinner, we hung out food bag and went to go lay down. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn:Mat: Subway MagicDaily steps: 28,097Elevation gain: 2585'","Gatlinburg, TN via New Found Gap (Mile 207.7)

Another day on the high ridge that comprises the backbone of the National Park, as well at the North Carolina-Tennessee border. It was foggy, chilly, and drippy but at least it wasn't raining! By the time we reached Tricorner Shelter at 10:40AM, the sun burned through some clouds. We stopped for brunch and to use the privy. I'm glad we didn't push to get here last night because apparently there were a lot of people, filling up the shelter and occupying all the tent spots! The rest of the day was nice walking, pretty level actually. We saw many hikers today, being the Saturday of Memorial Weekend. I think the northern half of the park is more scenic than the southern half and, therefore, attracts more backpackers. I could be wrong since we spent all our time in the southern half enveloped by clouds. It could also be that, because the northern most trailhead is near a large interstate highway, access is easier between the northern border and Newfound Gap. On trail, we saw a beautiful white-tail buck. He only had two prongs on his velvet antlers but they were thick prongs so they're still growing and will probably branch into a couple more prongs. He wasn't too concerned about us. I love seeing the big, trophy animals that find sanctuary in the national parks. They get to be way bigger than what is seen outside the parks and aren't that afraid of humans since they are protected. We passed by Cammerer Peak. Apparently there is a cool, old stone lookout at the top with 360° view. But it is a 0.6-mile one-way side trail climbing up to the top. We had a pretty nice view at Charlie's Bunion yesterday so we opted to bypass Cammerer and started the big descent down to Pigeon River. As we lost elevation, the temperature rose. We entered into rhododendron blooms, bright fuchsia pink. We exited the park, a big milestone completed. We came upon a nice campsite at 6:00PM. It was a little early to stop but we were less than two miles from Standing Bear Hostel, which is our next resupply. We didn't want to spend the money to stay overnight, and the next two miles are along the interstate corridor so there won't be many opportunities for stealth-camping. We decided to take advantage of the nice campsite. Besides, we've done a total of 7326ft in descent today so we should probably give our feet and knees a break! Our camp is next to a nice creek so we were able to soak our feet and rinse our legs. A couple of groups came by, I guess that's what we get for camping a half a mile from a trail head on the Saturday night of a holiday weekend. But luckily the groups of people stopped coming as dusk gathered. Fireflies came out after dark, floating up and down the little creek canyon. They're so fun to watch!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn:Mat: Tent stake - Mat found two tent stakes today, a nice aluminum one this morning and a cheap plastic one tonight.

Hiking at 8:30AM. We walked passed a cute waterfall and over the very swollen and muddy Pigeon River, under interstate 40, and made it to Standing Bear Hostel by 9:20AM. We plugged in our battery bricks to charge and headed over to the resupply room. It was small but had a great variety of single-use items. The food selection, however, was very lacking. Maybe because the bubble of thru-hikers has already passed but much of what was left was off-brand items without much variety. We sat by the fire pit to pack up our resupply. We recognized Captain from Mollie's Ridge Shelter a few days back. Yesterday he twisted his ankle, we could see it was swollen and slightly bruised. He walked 17 miles to get to the hostel so it's not broken but definitely a tear of some sort. He wrapped it in an ACE bandage and kept it elevated, taking the day off to rest it. He's a critical care nurse from Virginia so he had everything he needed in his first aid kit. He has section-hiked the entire AT already. At 10:45AM, we headed out. Although Standing Bear Hostel is a neat place with cool buildings and a creek running through the grounds, I'm glad we didn't spend the money to stay there last night. It probably would have been enjoyable as a young person, or a solo hiker. I guess I've just come to value privacy and quietness as I've gotten older. 
We descended a bunch yesterday, now we have to climb back up! The sun is out and it is much warmer today. We crested over Snowbird Mountain, a nice little clearing on top filled with azalea bushes. Once we were back in the shade of the forest again, we stopped for a lunch break. We pulled out our foods we had just purchased and started eating. Why does this food taste funny? Mat checked the expiration date. The pepperoni & cheese combo packages expired August of 2021, Mat's goat cheese he bought to spread on his bagel (since they didn't have cream cheese) and my bag of chips expired a few months ago. What the heck? We reconsidered our resupply and pulled out any food that looked or tasted suspect. We have enough to get into Hot Springs tomorrow but we were really put off by being sold expired food. At least they didn't over charge for the food. Gatlinburg may have been a zoo, but I'm glad we stopped there for a resupply so we didn't have to completely depend on Standing Bear's resupply.
The rest of the day consisted of PUDs (Pointless Ups and Downs) in the forest and it was quite warm. Eventually we reached Max Patch at 5:30PM, a large bald with 360° views. It was a lovely: looking back south towards the Smokies, sunlight streaked through tufts of clouds to light up patches of tree-covered slopes; to the west, we could see far into Tennessee; to the north and east, more Appalachian mountains rose up from deep valleys. We sat down at the top to have a break and eat some food. It didn't last long though, as Mat's grass allergy caused him to start sneezing excessively. So we continued on, dropping back down towards the trees. Just prior to entering the forest again, we came upon an Eastern Box Turtle just hanging out on trail!! Neither of us have seen land turtles in the wild (only sea turtles and sliders that hang out in college campus ponds). It was super cool to watch for a few minutes. 
We descended into the forests. We had our eye set on a creek to stop for camp but some weekenders had set up a big camp there so we hiked an additional two miles to another flat spot mentioned on the navigation app, stopping to camp at 8:30PM. Our feet and legs felt tired, then realized we had hike almost 22 miles with 6,460ft of climbing! Of course we were tired! We ate dinner and watched the fireflies come out again. So much fun to watch!

Town day so we were hiking by 7:50am. We could see dark clouds to the southeast as we crested over Walnut Mountain. We thought we could be dealing with some rain but it never materialized. We made excellent time today, reaching Laughing Heart Hostel at 1:30PM. As we dropped into the French Broad River valley, the humid heat became oppressive. Luckily, Reboot let us check in to our private room right away, which had air conditioning! But, the largest beds here are full-sized beds so it's going to be cramped tonight! 
We changed into loaner clothes, started laundry, and showered. With laundry done, we made our way into town for an early dinner. The only restaurant opened on a Monday was the Iron Horse, which was delicious. After dinner, we hit up the outfitters, Bluff Mountain Outfitters. They actually had a great little resupply section and we got the majority of food we needed. The last few items we picked up from the Hillbilly Market on our way back to the hostel. As we approached the hostel, we spotted another long Black Rat Snakes slithering across the road. We watched it cross to the other side before heading in; such cool looking snakes. We spent the rest of the evening relaxing in our air conditioned room, watching some shows. There is a very large group of college-age kids tent camping at the hostel for some sort of retreat or get-together. We did meet a uncle-niece team of section hikers, Scraps and Scruff. They were very nice.

The large group of kids tenting out in the lawn made for a very long line for the bathroom. It is also supposed to be hotter today than yesterday so we decided to just pack up and have breakfast in town on our way out. We left the hostel at 7:40AM and stopped at the Smoky Mountain Diner for breakfast. The eggs and hash browns were terrible, but the biscuits and gravy???? OMG the best we've had yet! Had I known how good they are, I would have just ordered a whole breakfast of biscuits and gravy! We left the diner at 8:30AM, crossed the very large and muddy French Broad River, and started the climb. It wasn't hot yet but it was humid without a breeze so we sweated anyway. Came in rather close to a pretty Cardinal. We ran into Scraps and Scruff sitting on a bench near the dammed pond. There were large bullfrogs croaking and fish in the water, Mat said they are Bluegill. We chatted with them a bit before continuing on. Up, up, up we climbed; it was getting warmer but at least we were reaching higher elevations where it is somewhat cooler and we could catch a breeze occasionally. We spent the midday traversing a dry ridge. There we're many tiny beetles that were a gorgeous iridescent green color, I looked them up and found they are called Six Spotted Tiger Beetle. We took a break at the water source after dropping off of the ridge. There was a tiny black salamander hanging out near the water, glad we didn't smoosh it while filing up! On the next big climb, we met a lady named Silica, she's out here going as far as she can before she has to go back to school in the fall.At 6:20PM, we found a nice campsite site on the upper flanks of Camp Creek Bald were a nice little breeze was blowing. We've already gone more than 20 miles and climbed 6800ft so we were ready to lie down!

I wondered why everything still felt so damp despite being camped on a dry ridge with a breeze. When we started walking, we realized we were just below the cloud level: perfect visibility looking around but if we looked up the treetops were in fog! Just four miles from where we camped is a trail junction; hikers can choose to go over the top of Big Firescald Knob with nice views, or take the 'Badweather' route lower through the forest. We wanted to see the views but were torn: first off, the weather forecast predicted a chance of thunderstorm before 11:00AM and we did not want to be stuckup there with a possibility of lightning; secondly, we could see the cloud sitting on top of the knob so we figured we wouldn't have a view anyway. By the time we reached the trail junction, however, the cloud lifted off the ridge and we could see that thunderheads hadn't formed yet. We decided to go for it! Rock outcroppings started to jut out of the ground and the environment took on a different look and feel, like we were hiking on a foreign tropical island or New Zealand! Eventually, we broke out onto the rocky top of Big Firescald Knob. The cloud was directly over us so we couldn't see super far out to the horizons, but we could see the forested terrain open up below us. The top was covered in vibrant blooms of Mountain Laurel and Rhododendron mixed with pine trees and rocks. It was a cool ridge. But it ended quickly and we dropped back down into the forest where we reconnected with the lower trail. The intersection is at trail mile 300! We dropped down the flanks of Big Firescald Knob, reaching Jerry's Cabin Shelter at 10:30AM for brunch and privy use. Afterwards, we continued on the crest line that comprises the North Carolina-Tennessee border. We stopped for a break at Flint Mountain Gap and another break at Sugarloaf Branch Creek to soak our feet. This creek had many dark salamanders, five or six we counted as we sat there! We continued on, stopping at the viewpoints from Lickrock Divide Mountain to look at the terrain we were headed into. At this point, three young men showed up. Their names were Hot Spot, Wet Woody, and Clown Foot. They were at the Laughing Heart Hostel but came in while we were out on our errands so we hadn't met them there. We chatted briefly and they continued on, looking to reach Hogback Ridge Shelter for the night. We pulled into the shelter around 6:45PM, looking to get water for our dry camp tonight. There were two older ladies there, Jeckle and Heckle, so I passed on the message of greetings from Scrap and Scruff as instructed. We got water then sat in the communal area chatting with Wet Woody, Hot Spot, and Clown Foot. Wet Woody is from New York and Hot Spot is from Ohio, both had spent quite a bit of time in New Mexico recently. Clown Foot is originally from Minnesota but now lives in Tennessee. It was fun chatting with them. It was like 8:00PM before we decided to keep going to get to our dry camp and cook dinner. We found a nice spot not much further down the ridge from the shelter that had a nice breeze. It was a pretty sunset as we set up our tent and cooked dinner.

We came upon an Eastern Salamander, bright orange in it's juvenile stage. After crossing beneath the highway, we started the climb up to Big Bald, shielded from the breeze so we sweated a lot. The last water source before Big Bald, we came upon Mike. He hurt his calf and so took Hwy 26 down into Erwin for a zero and is now back on trail. We chatted with him a bit before he continued, we settled down for a lunch. After lunch, we packed up and made the final push to the top of Big Bald. Wet Woody, Hot Spot, and Clown Foot caught up to us at the top. The top was a huge grassy opening with 360° views. We chatted with a local couple who had a super cute little dog. Wet Woody and Hot Spot took off for Big Bald Shelter but Clown Foot hiked with us until the shelter. He's from Minnesota and has spent lots of time in the Boundary Waters so we asked him about the area. He's also an ultra runner, having done the Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim run in the Grand Canyon! At Big Bald Shelter, the trio stopped for lunch, we used the privy but continued on since we already had our lunch. As we crested over and down the backside of Little Bald, the thunder cloud above us starting rumbling. We had a few spits if rain but nothing drastic. We took a break at Spivey Gap, soaking our feet in Big Creek. It's a good thing we did because not 20 minutes after we started walking again, the thunder rumbled and real rain started falling. Fortunately for us, the trail was dropping in elevation, contouring along the slopes of No Business Knob (instead of the more typical going up and over the top!). Despite the frequent rumbles overhead, we felt safe descending though the dense forest. The trio caught up with us again at the last water source of the day. They pushed on up to No Business Shelter but hadn't decided what their plan was for the night - Uncle Johnny's hostel was just six miles away! We made our way to the shelter, Mike was there as well as two other hikers we haven't met yet. The trio found out from the group that they wouldn't be turned away from Uncle Johnny's bunkhouse if they came in late so they decided to push all the way to Uncle Johnny's tonight. We continued on to camp at Temple Hill Gap to set ourselves up for a 12.3-mile walk to Indian Gave Gap tomorrow where we'll hitch into Erwin for our hotel reservation. But Mat found a nice, level stealth spot 0.2-miles prior to the Gap. The thunder storm seemed to have worn itself out but if it did come back around, we felt we were in a pretty protected location. The trio walked by as we were setting up our tent. We told them to enjoy their beer tonight! Time for dinner!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Chocolate Thief - Mat mixed up a chocolate instant breakfast for his breakfast.

We used my Bird-Shazam app (Merlin) to identify it as a Whippoorwill. ""Oh boy, a nighttime bird that is known for repeating it's loud call continuously,"" I informed Mat, ""It may be a long night.""

Morn - Cloudy and calm with occasional sprinkles, 62°FMid - Foggy and raining, 61°FEve -

A little bit of rain came in overnight but no thunderstorm. It stopped by the time we woke. We started walking rather late for a town day today, 8:25AM. Spits of rain started as we began walking and soon it turned into an outright downpour as we descended Temple Ridge. At a cliff above the Nolichucky river, a bright red cooler sat on a rocky ledge, a sign on the cooler stating ""Take One!"" I didn't feel comfortable stepping down the slippery stones to the cliff ledge but Mat was called by the prospect of a free, cold soda. He carefully stepped down the slippery rocks and opened the cooler to find it full of bibles. Hopes dashed! We reached the river's edge, near Uncle Johnny's hostel, just after 10:00AM. The hostel is a popular stop for hikers but we have a hotel reserved in downtown Erwin with plans to hitch in from Indian Grave Gap eight miles ahead. It was still raining hard but at least we'll climb up out of the Nolichucky River valley with minimal food weight in our packs! After crossing the river and re-entering the forest, it happened: Mat sustained his annual bee sting. He gets stung every summer and we have no idea why; he isn't wearing bright colors, he doesn't swing at bees, they just land in him and sting. It's a good thing he's not allergic to bee stings. It's also early in the summer so hopefully he won't get hit a second time. Just after Mat got stung, we came upon another Eastern Box Turtle! This one had a very yellow shell. We saw more of the orange juvenile Eastern Newts as well. We climbed back up out of the Nolichucky River Valley as the rain continued falling. 
We reached Curley Maple Gap Shelter just before noon, stopping to eat lunch at the dry picnic table. I set my pack down on the inner bench so I could face out and enjoy the scenery as I ate. Mat was on the opposite side of the table and, after a few minutes I heard him say, ""Is that a real spider?"" I turn around to look into the shelter and up on the back rafter is the biggest spider I've ever seen in the wild. It was about four inches and super dark brown, almost black. Mat climbed the ladder to the upper sleeping deck to get a better look, and to make sure it wasn't a plastic fake spider. Nope it moved! Eeek!! I was very disturbed, we haven't slept in a shelter yet and now I don't think I ever will! Interestingly, it positioned itself right next to a small paper wasp nest. It must be hunting the wasps. We finished our lunch and continued on quickly! 
We reached Indian Grave Gap at 2:00pm. Luckily the rain recently stopped so we spruced ourselves up for town. We hadn't heard any traffic go by while we spruced up so we figured we'll hitching for a while. But, just as we came down to the road, a car drove out one of the gravel forest service roads. We stuck out our thumb and the car stopped for us! People here are so nice, it's way easier to hitch here than on other trails! Probably because everyone knows backpackers out here are on the Appalachian trail. Logan was a very cool guy, working on his goal of visiting all the national parks. He had some amazing photos from his most recent trip. He was very nice and dropped us off right at the Super 8 hotel. We were in our hotel room by 2:30PM! Laundry and showers, then we ordered pizza for delivery. Mat found a couple of Klondike bars in the room fridge, score!! Time for an ice cream sandwich and some relaxation!

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652665,"Last night and this morning we looked closely at our schedule. We have plane tickets back to the West Coast flying out of Tri-cities airport. Our plan was to get to Damascus, VA before flying back home. But we are ahead of schedule. We could hike past Damascus but we kind of wanted a nice place to finish our flip-flop triple crown. We decided on a finish in Grayson Highlands. It'll allow us to complete 500 miles northbound, get an extra couple days of hiking in before leaving for the west coast, and I'll get to take triple crown pictures with wild ponies!!! We're also getting tired of all the frequent town stops; between here and Damascus there is a town stop every other day. It's hard to get into a hiking rhythm (not to mention save money) when you stop for town every other day. We decided to go straight through to Boots Off Hostel, skipping the Roan Mountain/19E stop.Even with the new plan, we still had an extra two days so we decided to take a zero today with the nice hotel room. We spent the morning going over our plans for our five weeks back home and how we will get back out to Mt. Katahdin and the Appalachian Trail in late July to head southbound. We also caught up with family and hit up the grocery store. Before going grocery shopping, we grabbed some lunch. There was a Taco Bell and a Bojangles in the parking lot of the grocery store. Mat wanted Taco Bell but I wanted to try Bojangles. We stopped in Bojangles first and I got some fried chicken and a biscuit with gravy. I'm telling you I'm fast becoming a fan of biscuits and gravy out here, super delicious! The fried chicken tastes better dipped in the country gravy rather than the ranch I always get. Didn't like the fries though. After I ate we went over to Taco Bell for Mat. He said it didn't taste as good as back on the west coast but he still bought some burritos to pack out tomorrow. After getting back to the hotel, we looked around for a shuttle back up to the trailhead. We didn't want to hitch since we would have to walk a good 1.5 miles across town to get to the particular road going back up to Indian Grave! Much easier to just schedule a shuttle. The one person who got back to us said they could drive us up tomorrow either at 8:00AM or 11:45AM. We requested the earlier time since we had a zero today and we wanted to get back on trail early tomorrow.","Erwin, TN

The sun was out, the air was cool, and a breeze kept the humidity down; it's going to be a beautiful day of hiking! We were walking by 8:35AM, our packs heavy with 4+ days of food, but we felt good and rested. We climbed up to Beauty Spot, a bald with views out into the surrounding county. At Beauty Spot Gap, we stopped for water. Mat spotted a cuben-fiber rock sack with Paracord caught in a tree - someone's bear hang tangled up. At least the person (or possibly the bear?) got the food bag but left the hanging setup. Mat was able to get the rest of the hang setup out of the tree. He was stoked because it was $25 worth of nice gear in good condition! After the break, we climbed up Unaka Mountain, the top enveloped in a forest of Spruce trees, the ground covered by a thick, continuous carpet of moss. It was a pretty little spot. The trail immediately dropped down the backside. We spent the rest of the day moving along the crest that comprises the North Carolina-Tennesse border. The trail/state border makes a large loop here so we are walking compass-south for some time. This is the third such loop since entering North Carolina but I guess the Appalachian mountains are very sporadic here, not the north-south ridges of the west coast. This afternoon, we came upon a small brown garter snake and a pretty red grouse luring us away from her little chicks that we could hear but not see.Around 6:30PM, we came upon some tent sites before crossing Hughes Gap Road. It is earlier than when we wanted to stop but apparently the road is fairly busy and there isn't much in terms of campsites on the other side, the start of the climb up to Roan Knob, unless we wanted to hike another four miles with 1500ft elevation. We've already hiked 20.8 miles with 5560ft of climbing so we figured it would be a good time to stop for the day. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn:Mat: Treasure - Mat liked finding little treasures that others leave behindDaily steps: 45,246Elevation gain: 5561'","Erwin, TN via Indian Grave Gap (Mile 352.6)

Started walking at 8:30AM, dropping immediately down to Hughes Gap Road before beginning the five-mile climb up to Roan High Knob. The climb was nicely graded, though, and the air was cool with a nice breeze. We spooked two white tail deer and numerous small snakes. At 10:40AM, we reached the site of Cloudland Hotel, the remnants of a hotel from the early 1900s. At 6200ft, the air was crisp and we were surrounded by stunted pine trees. We felt like we could be in Mt. Rainier National Park, without the snowy peaks. Less than 0.1 mile off trail was the Roan High Knob parking lot with nice picnic tables, trash bins, and flushing toilets. We stopped for an early lunch, eating anything that maximized our access to the trash cans. After our early lunch, we climbed the last little bit up to forested Roan High Knob and dropped back down to the large parking lot of Carver's Gap (only pit toilets and no trash bins like the other parking lot). There were a lot of cars parked here! From the parking lot we entered the open Roan Highlands. Even though it was Monday, the weather was nice so there were many people day-hiking. I'm glad we weren't here on Sunday yesterday! There are many rhododendron bushes near Carver's Gap but the fushia buds were still tight; another week and it will be popping up here! Flame Azaleas were in full bloom though. 
After the open scenery and crowds of Round and Jane Balds, we dropped down to forested Yellow Mountain Gap. A sign at the actual gap said a group of mountain men used the gap to make their way to the coast to fight off British troops during the revolutionary war in the 1770's. Interesting. From Yellow Mountain Gap, we climbed back up to open scenery on Little Hump and Hump Mountains. There were some people up here but not nearly as many as there was near Carver's Gap. We climbed to the top of Hump Mountain, we could see well into Virginia. We wanted to stop for a break but it was very windy so we dropped down the far side, finding an outcropping of rocks in the grass that was fairly protected from the wind. After our break, we started the 2700ft descent to Hwy 19E. Along that descent, we left the North Carolina-Tennessee border we've basically been following since our first day in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Now we will be completely in Tennessee until we reach Virginia in 75 miles. We passed a sign marking the state line. Eventually we reached Hwy 19E, the busiest road we've had to actually cross so far, no under or overpass for this one! We scampered across and climbed up. The trail eventually came to a grassy draw. Luckily the trail crew had been through at some point, trimming the three-foot tall grass down. Mat was especially appreciative of this due to his grass allergies. That is until we saw the broken weed-whacker cord on the ground, then we had to walk on narrow trail through the tall grass. It was getting late but we didn't come across a nice campsite until about 8:00PM. We scoured the site for possible poison ivy since there is A LOT around here. No poison ivy so we threw down the tent. While laying in our sleeping bags eating dinner, Mat realized his thermarest pad wasn't holding air. Luckily he was able to find the leak quickly and used our spare field-patch kit to fix it. So far it's holding. There are roads and scattered houses all through the hills here so there was a lot of noise pollution tonight. But at least there are a few fireflies to watch in the meadow further out.

Mat's thermarest held all night, luckily it was just one small tear. We started walking at 8:30AM with intermittent spitting rain. We're in forests at a lower elevation than we have been for a while and we are frequently hearing the calls of Pileated Woodpecker. It's hard to see them 40ft up in the backlit canopy. But their calls can sound like the whoops of monkeys. We'll hear one and Mat with pipe up, ""Woodpecker vs monkey?"" We reached trail mile 400 early in the day. We dropped down to Elk River, reaching it's banks just before 10:00AM. I was going to keep walking but Mat stopped and stared at the river like a Labrador dog. I realized, 'Oh of course he wants to go in the water!' so we stopped for a break. He immediately took his shoes off and walked in, washing the itchy grasses off his legs. I stepped in as well, the water felt cool, not cold; different from the west coast where the water would most likely be snowmelt runoff and difficult to stand in more than a minute. Mat admitted he would actually go swimming if he knew his clothes would dry but it is humid today without much air movement so there is no guarantee his clothes would dry out. So he resisted his natural tendencies! After our refreshing splashabout, we continued on. Around 11:00AM, we passed Mountaineers Falls Shelter. We decided we could keep going before stopping for lunch. Sure enough, not long after we walked past the shelter, rain started to fall. So we sat on a log in a light rain for lunch. The rain didn't last too long as we weaved in an out of the ravines of Walnut Mountain. We crossed Hardcore Cascade, which I thought was a hilarious name for such a little waterfall, if you could call it that. We came upon a pretty creek called Laurel Branch with some nice campsites. The trail climbed up above the creek but will be joining the creek again downstream as it enters a short gorge. The trail ascended the slopes of White Rocks Mountain. Occasionally the trees opened up to brief glimpses of the Roan Highlands to the south. All day the highlands have been shrouded in a dense cloud. Man I'm glad we hiked through it yesterday when we could see out. It would be frustrating to deal with all that climbing and be stuck in continuous fog all day!A break at the empty Moreland Gap Shelter before the final push to the top of White Rocks Mountain. Just as we reached the top, we were hit with a rain cloud. I put on my rain skirt and rain jacket as the downpour was pretty strong and the vegetation encroached onto the trail, causing me to frequently push through wet brush. Luckily we were going downhill. Eventually the cloud passed and blue skies opened up. The recent heavy rain and sunshine created small, intermittent patches of light fog. Just before 7:00PM, we rejoined Laurel Branch Creek and entered Pond Mountain Wilderness. Here the trail follows Laurel Branch Creek into a little gorge. It was a very pretty area. We dropped down to Laurel Falls, a large rock face that Laurel Branch Creek pours over. After the waterfall, there is a rock ledge protruding into the river that the AT uses as trail, causing hikers to maneuver the rocks just above the creek; the rocks were kind of slippery from the recent rain but not too difficult. Just before 8:00PM, we set up our tent at a large, packed down campsite. We went over to the creek to wash off. It's surprising how rare it is to come across creeks large enough to swim in so far. Most water out here comprises of small creeklets where one can splash themselves, but not a whole lot of swimming options! We also reflected on how we only saw three sets of day hikers all day; we must have gotten ourselves into quite the hiker anti-bubble right now! Saw some fireflies tonight as we fell asleep listening to the creek.Trailnames of the Day:

Rain woke us at 5:30AM but we were able to close up the vestibules and secure the tent before it grew into heavy rain, which continued until 8:30AM when it stopped long enough to pack up. Only, the rain came on again very heavily just as we had our packs wide open to store everything inside! We tossed the rest of our items into our packs and started walking. We continued following Laurel Branch Creek for another mile or so before the AT turned and climbed up the slopes of Pond Mountain. I spooked a Dekay's Brown Snake; about the size of a garter snake but brown with a complex pattern on the back instead of a garter snake's stripe. By the time we reached the crest of the ridge, the rain stopped and the clouds broke above us revealing blue sky. The ridge across Watauga Reservoir, however, was still shrouded in thick clouds, so the trail over there was at least in fog if not rain. We had cell service so we were able to check the weather; a thunderstorm was forecasted for this evening into tonight with over an inch of rainfall. Hmmm, most of our stuff was already fairly wet from rain yesterday and this morning. Maybe we should stay at Boots Off Hostel instead of resupplying and hiking on to Damascus like we were considering.
We arrived at the hostel at 11:50AM. It was clean and organized. There was only one private cabin left so we nabbed it. We bought an oven pizza and soda from the store (they also had microwave burritos and hamburgers) to eat lunch first. We then headed over to our little cabin. These things were great! Very small inside - Full sized bed with a bunk over the top - but they each had their own mini fridge and coffee maker, A/C and heater, lamps and alarm clock, and hooks EVERYWHERE! Which is super useful when trying to dry out wet gear. We tied up cord between our cabin and the next to hang our tent and ground clothes out to dry, then brought our laundry up to the store where they washed it for us for $5. They have loaner clothes as well. Next, time for shower, which consisted of two private outdoor showers, with actual shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and shaving cream provided! The showerhead was a tin garden bucket with holes drilled in the bottom so it was a nice rain shower. We felt rejuvenated afterwards and went back to the cabin to relax. I'm very impressed with this hostel: the bathroom & outhouses were clean and everything well run and organized, and the bed very comfortable 
At 3:30PM, the thunderstorm hit. Luckily all our stuff was already dry and inside our cabin. We could see lightening flashes in the daylight, with booms only three seconds after; about half a mile away. I'm really glad we're not out there! The rain abated by the time the shuttle bell rang. Eleven hikers, us included, climbed into the four-row van and were driven down to Hampton, TN. First stop was the little market to get resupply, second stop was Subway where half the hikers got out to buy their dinner, third stop was McDonald's where the rest of the hikers got their dinner, then back to the hostel we went. Mat and I went back to our cabin to pack away our resupply food. More hard rain came in as dusk gathered. We curled up to watch some shows on Mat's phone; the 5G cell service is nice!

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: 20 Piece - while at McDonald's, they had an option on the self-order kiosk for 20 Piece chicken nuggets. I asked Mat, ""Would you judge me if I ordered the 20-piece meal? I'm really hungry!"" (We hadn't eaten since noon). He said, ""Of course not!"" so I selected the 20 Piece. Apparently, they don't make 20-peice mcnuggets a meal, no fries and milkshake to accompany my 20-piece chicken nuggets! I was aggrieved! So I ordered the 10-peice and selected a large fries and milkshake. Mat: New Product - every year for our hiking season, we like to see what new (and often ridiculous) products are put out by companies for American consumers to buy. When we're out hiking, we'll buy foods/snacks we'd never eat during the off season so there are always a few items to try each summer. While at the store, I saw Reese's had put out a new product of a big cup with pieces of potato chip mixed in the peanut butter. I laughed and showed it to Mat, ""Who would actually buy this stuff?"" He replied, ""You're husband!"" as he looked down into his cart of resupply and one was already in there. We both started laughing.

It's 42 miles from here to Damascus, which would put us rolling into town late tomorrow evening if we started early today. We don't like coming into town so late because we'd have to spend money on a place to stay without getting to enjoy the benefits of town. So we took our time this morning to delay our entry into Damascus the next morning. We relaxed in the comfortable bed until 8:30AM, then headed up to the communal kitchen to enjoy the continental breakfast of cereal and fruit, then back to the cabin to pack up. We also scheduled a shuttle from Damascus to the Tri-cities airport on Monday. The places to stay in Damascus are super expensive unless it's a bunk house, which we don't want to do. We found a decently priced bed at Dragonfly Inn for Sunday night that we reserved, then will have the shuttle take us to a hotel near the airport for Monday night, much cheaper than staying in Damascus for two nights. Now we'll just have a long hitch from Massie Gap in Grayson Highlands State Park back to Damascus. But it'll be Sunday afternoon so hopefully there will be lots of day-hikers; someone will give us a ride!
After getting reservations and shuttles all situated, we left the hostel at 10:00AM. The trail hugs the edge of Watauga Lake here and some comments say the trail is under water currently so we opted for the road walk; it adds 0.2 miles but at least we'll keep our feet dry. There wasn't too much of a shoulder along Hwy 67 but traffic wasn't too bad going our direction so it worked out. Although two school buses driving in the opposite direction drove by so fast the resulting wind blew my hat straight off my head and into what looked suspiciously like a poison ivy patch. Mat picked out my hat with his trekking pole and I carried it to the next lake access where I rinsed it in the water. Hopefully I don't get a poison ivy rash on my head! 
We rejoined the AT on trail that continued to follow the shore of Lake Watauga. We ran into a very nice couple from Pennsylvania who have a vacation home here in Hampton, TN. They've been hiking sections of the AT and the husband is looking to thru-hike in 2024 after he retires. Her trailname is J-way but he doesn't have one yet. They eventually want to turn their vacation home into an AT hostel. It was fun chatting with them. We continued on, crossing the earthen Watauga Dam and ascending Iron Mountain Ridge - a straight, 15-mile long ridge that is lovingly referred to as the Tennessee Turnpike since the trail follows the ridge to make actual straight progress towards Maine. The trail has been interesting in North Carolina. It's as if, upon exiting Georgia, North Carolina wants to bounce the hiker around like a hot potato, making the trail go back and forth resulting in multiple large loops. The trail eventually gets to Tennessee, but it follows the border with North Carolina so North Carolina still bounces the hiker back and forth. Once the hiker fully enters Tennessee, leaving North Carolina behind, the Tennessee trail is like, 'Let's get these hobo-hikers out of here as fast as possible. My shelters are tiny, without privies. Nope, we don't want to make it too comfortable for these hobo-hikers, they hang around if you make it too comfortable. Let's just get you to Virginia as fast as possible, you'll like it there. Virginia is for lovers.' And *bam* the trail follows a few long, straight ridges right into Virginia! Don't get me wrong, every Tennesseean we've meet has been incredibly friendly. It's the trail that suddenly decides to get moving. That's fine by us, it's nice to make northward progress!
The ridge was forested and the trail somewhat overgrown with grass. We could catch glimpses of Watauga Lake below but the foliage has really grown in so even the viewpoints highlighted in the navigation app didn't have much of a view. The best open view we got was from the big rock behind Vandeventer shelter. A strong wind kept the humidity at bay; it was quite lovely walking. Lots of neat tent sites on the ridge but I definitely wouldn't want to be up here during a lightning storm. 
Just before 7:00PM, we found a nice campsite. Just under 25 miles to Damascus so we'll be able to do a nice full day tomorrow, then have just a few miles into Damascus the next morning for breakfast before hiking back out. We pitched our tent and got in, the air already cooling. It's supposed to get below 60°F tonight so I'm excited for some cool sleeping! A little bunny checked out our tent as we relaxed in our sleeping bags.

More likely a bird of some sort so I whipped out my Merlin App and used the Bird Shazam feature to find it was a Yellow Billed Cuckoo. Very shy birds but they have cool white dots on the underside of their tail feathers. We tried to look for it but it lived up to it's elusive nature. Mat's air mattress has another slow leak, we'll have to try and find it for another patch. Started walking at 9:00AM since we didn't want to end up in Damascus later today. It was fantastic walking this morning: open forests with level, brush-free trail, cool weather with a nice breeze. After a couple miles we crossed TN Route 91 and entered open cow pastures. We crossed fields covered with yellow dandelions, purple clover flowers, and white daisies. Large orange butterflies with orange-brown patterns on their wings loved all the flowers. I looked them up and they are called Great Spangled Fritillaries. We stopped for a short break on a nice little bench set on trail overlooking a view into the valley below, watching the cows graze before us. I don't know who the land owners are, but they provide a beautiful and welcoming path through their cow pasture. Even the old barn had a cool AT arrow logo on it. The cows looked very healthy and not afraid of us so they take good care of their animals. There were a couple of cute baby calf's in the herd. My topo maps calls this area Osbourne Farm.
Before long, we passed back into the forest, the tall trees provide nice cooling shade from the sun! We spent the rest of the day in the forest, following Pond Ridge towards Virginia. The ridge is pretty dry so we had to drop 0.2-miles off trail (and climb 0.2-miles back up) to reach the spring at Abingdon Shelter. Occasionally we could glimpse through the trees down to the patchwork of farm fields and forests below, overlayed with a separate patchwork of sun and cloud shadows, very pretty. At 6:00PM we reached the Virginia border! Three states down now, 11 more to go! We walked to the next accessible water, also 0.2-miles off trail. We pitched our tent here, only 2.2 miles into town for breakfast tomorrow!

We didn't pack a breakfast for today because we knew we'd be eating at the Damascus Diner. We started walking at 8:00AM, descending the two miles into town by 8:35AM. The town park, which is reached first, was a thru-hiker's dream park: level walking path lined with multiple trash bins, power outlets, water spigots, benches, and picnic tables. No camping allowed, however. We used all the amenities, and the bathroom, before making our way to the Damascus Diner; Mat needs his coffee! By 9:00AM, we were sitting in the Damascus Diner, legendary for it's delicious food and amazing prices. We expected it to be super busy given it's a Saturday morning but there weren't too many parties inside, although more people showed up after we were seated. The food lived up to it's legendary status, and so did the prices! While eating breakfast, we discussed our route out of town. The Virginia Creeper trail is a 34-mile Rails-to-Trails path between the towns of Whitetop Station and Abingdon, rolling directly through Damascus. A popular tourist activity is to rent a bike from a company in Damascus, which shuttles people with their bikes up to Whitetop Station, and ride/coast the 17 miles back to Damascus. The Virginia Creeper trail parallels the AT for 12.5 trail miles, intersecting at multiple spots. While the AT climbs up ridges and drops back down a couple times, the Virginia Creeper trail steadily follows Whitetop Laurel Creek. In what the AT does in 12.5 miles and 3176ft of climbing, the Virginia Creeper does in 9.6 miles and 793ft of climbing. The Virginia Creeper offers multiple opportunities to soak in the creek, plus a lunch & ice cream joint 6.5 miles in. We decided to do the Virginia Creeper trail. Although it's not a purist AT hike (which some AT hikers look down upon), it offers variety from the green tunnel and we're still connecting our steps from Georgia to Maine. Our decision came down to this: walking the Virginia Creeper trail will be a much more memorable experience than hiking more of the same forests we have been passing through for the last month. In a couple years, all the mundane forest walking will blend together and we probably won't remember the section of AT anyway but we'll always remember walking on the Virginia Creeper Trail because it is different.
After breakfast, we headed out of Damascus; we'll have time to explore the cute little town when we hitch back tomorrow. We continued on the Virginia Creeper trail when the AT split off, stopping to soak our legs in the creek. Going northbound on the Virginia Creeper trail is nice because pretty much all the bike rider are coming at us so we really didn't have to worry about cyclists coming up behind us. On one of the bridges, we saw a Brown Water Snake drop to the creek below and swim to the edge. Further along, we heard a shrill monotone whistle. The next bike riders that came down said there was a black bear ahead, but the cyclists must have scared it off because we didn't see anything as we rounded the bend. In a cute little valley called Taylor's Valley, we stopped for another soak in the creek. From there, we walked another mile to the Hellbender Cafe. Just prior to arriving at the cafe, we spotted a Bald Eagle! We didn't know they were around here. Some cyclists came by as we were looking at the big bird, we told them there was a bald eagle. The first cyclist said, ""What?!"" slamming on her breaks, causing the girl behind her to crash. Whoops. We asked if they were OK but they all just laughed saying they knew one of the group was going to crash today. But their whole group stopped and watched the big bird as we left. We stopped for delicious pulled pork sandwiches with fries and coleslaw, followed by ice cream at the Hellbender Cafe. The place was packed with cyclists, the cafe must do very well here! 
After lunch, we continued on, the herds of cyclists starting to thin. Crossing another bridge, Mat spotted a crazy looking caterpillar with spots and spikes. I looked it up to find it was a Pipevine Swallowtail caterpillar. Eventually we reached where the AT branches off from the Virginia Creeper Trail for good and started to climb towards Whitetop Mountain. It was a forested climb until we reached Buzzard Rock, at this point we entered an open field covered in blackberry bushes. The blackberry bushes here are so different from the west coast; they grow as a single stick, all reaching the same three-feet height. If one needed to walk through the field they could, albeit not very comfortably since the branches still have thorns. Compared to west coast blackberry bushes that grow taller than a man's head and in such an intertwining mess a person couldn't move through it. I wonder how these blackberries taste? Back into forest for another mile before breaking into a ledge covered in Flame Azaleas in all sorts of colors ranging from a deep red-orange to cream orange to yellow, views of the surrounding mountains beyond. It was very pretty. We reached a gusher of a spring coming right out of the ground but, as we were filling up, realized one of the people camped 50 yards away was puking. At first we thought, ""oh no, thru-hikers with Noro Virus!"" But after a second look, we realized they weren't thru-hikers, just regular campers from the nearby parking lot; probably drank too much in the sun all day. Just beyond the parking lot, we found some camp sites. Usually we don't like camping near roads or parking lots, especially on a Saturday night, but this road seemed very far out of the way, not a place people come to party. Plus it is still a couple miles away from anywhere else we could pitch a tent and it was getting late. We set up the tent. The sunset was muted but still colorful. 

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Bear Free Lake - While walking through Damascus, I spotted a road sign for Bear Free Lake. ""Bear Free Lake? That's quite the promise for a national forest campground."" I told Mat. But as we neared the sign, we realized it actually said Bear Tree Lake and the metal bolt holding the sign up was in such a place that make it look like it said Bear Free Lake from afar!Mat: Virginia Creeper

I passed out so hard last night I missed seeing the fireflies. Hopefully I didn't miss the last opportunity to see them; maybe we'll see some in New England while going southbound. We started walking at 7:30AM and, within an hour, reached the Elk Garden Trailhead with pit toilet and trash bins. All water sources this morning are barely trickling. We kept going to the next water source, and the next one, but they were all little puddles. We ended up walking six miles before we finally got to some flowing water, walking the last four of those miles completely out of water! Luckily the temperature was cool with a nice breeze to keep us from sweating.
This is when we saw our first wild ponies. Ponies have been roaming the Grayson Highlands since the 1940s, prior to when the land was acquired by the National Forest. In the 1970s, the Wilburn Ridge Pony Association formed to care for and manage the more than 100 wild ponies. Every fall they lure the ponies in with salt licks, give them all a visual health checks, and select a few young males to be taken to auction for purchase (to keep herd numbers down). Since they're wild, people are not allowed to pet or feed the ponies, but the ponies have learned that hikers are salty and will come up to lick your arms or legs. We were walking on trail just below the summit of Mt. Rogers and, rounding a bend, came upon a line of four ponies walking straight towards us. I stepped off trail to let them pass but instead the leader of the little pack came right up to me and started licking my arm, then a little baby pony foal came out from behind her and started licking my other arm! Once those two had enough and moved on towards Mat, the two younger (but not babies) ponies came up to lick! They were very gentle, if not a little overwhelming coming all at once. Although the baby foal nipped with it's teeth a little bit, less eye-mouth coordination I think. After licking on Mat, they continued down the trail! Super excited we got the encounter those wild ponies!
In another mile or so, we saw another family herd of ponies. These ones weren't interested in us, munching on short grass and laying in the sun. Two day hikers came up from the opposite direction. They were very nice and chatty so we talked for a bit. It turns out the older guys is an aspiring rapper going by the stage name Snoopy Down Flave and he's about to drop his next album. We will have to look that up. Immediately after saying goodbye to these guys, we hit the 500 mile marker and entered into a tunnel of blooming rhododendrons! As we swung onto Wilburn Ridge, the views opened, framed by bright rhododendron blooms. We stopped for lunch to admire the flowers. After lunch, we continued the last few miles to Massie Gap, seeing more family groups of ponies with little babies. We reached Massie Gap and dropped off trail down to the large parking lot, ending the northbound part of our AT flip-flop. It is a gorgeous area with the views and rhododendron blooms, worthy of a triple crown flip flop finish! I can't wait to see what it will look like with fall colors when we come back southbound. But it may be foggy and storming, though.
We hit up the pit toilets then set up to hitch down to Damascus at about 1:00PM. A single older gentleman had passed us while on Wilburn Ridge, we saw him in the parking lot puting his stuff into his Prius, an Appalachian Trail Conservancy sticker on his car window. ""This guy will surely give us a ride."" We said to ourselves. Nope, he just drove by as we stood on the side of the exit with our thumbs out and our packs set up with our AT tags prominent. Wasn't expecting that! Oh well, there are tons of people out today, being a Sunday with great weather and blooming rhododendrons; we'll get a ride in no time! Boy was I wrong. It took us a total of three hitches over the course of 2.5 hours to get back to Damascus! Not unusual for some west coast trails but definitely crazy for the AT! We worried what we will do when we finish in the fall, possibly with foul weather. We may have to suck it up and pay for a shuttle to come get us if it's stormy. Something to be mindful of. The first ride was a young couple who got us down to the park entrance on hwy 58, but there was hardly any traffic on this back-roads highway. The second ride was from a guy in his truck, employed by the state to trap gypsy months, which are slowly destroying the Appalachian forests. He was going to a job site in the middle of nowhere so dropped us off at Whitetop Station. The lady at the gas station told us we might have better luck if we walk further down the road to where the Virginia Creeper Bike shuttles turn around to go back to Damascus. This was a smart idea so we started walking. But we didn't know what we were looking for exactly and ended up passing it, getting into narrow curvy sections with no room to pull over; terrible conditions for hitching! We ended up walking two miles until we found a place with a pull out. We stuck out our thumbs but traffic was light and no one stopped. Just as we were about to give up and walk another half mile into the next little town, a car pulled up. Rich and Elaine rescued us! They cleared out their hiking and biking gear from the back seat and we climbed in. We chatted with them about hiking and biking all the way down to Damascus. They were actually going to the coffee shop directly across the street from the Dragonfly Inn where we had a reservation. They invited us to coffee but we really wanted a shower, especially after being out in the hot sun hitching all afternoon!
After showers, we gathered our laundry and walked over to the part of town where restaurants are still open. Dragonfly Inn does not have laundry, unfortunately, but we walked right past Crazy Larry's Hostel, which has laundry. He charged us $10!! since we weren't guests of the hostel. But we are catching a flight back home to the west coast and I didn't want to smell for the 5+ hour flight so I handed him the $10 bill. He said it'll be done in an hour so we ambled over to 7 Trails grill for dinner. After dallying for an hour, we walked back towards the Inn, swinging into Crazy Larry's to pick up our clean laundry. We stopped at the coffee and ice cream shop across the street and got some dessert to enjoy on the Dragonfly Inn's amazing wraparound deck. When the mosquitoes came out, we headed to our room to relax. Besides the hitching fiasco, a fantastic way to end our north bound section.
Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: No horses, Ponies OK - There were a few signs scattered in the Grayson Highlands that said No Horses (no pack horses). I wanted to pull out my sharpie so bad and write ""Ponies OK"" beneath the words on the sign. But I didn't want to vandalize so I didn't. Mat: Salt Lick - Ponies treated Mat like a salt lick!

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652963,"Tomorrow we are flying out of Tri-cities airport in Tennessee back to the West Coast for our planned five-week break. We have a two-week trip into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) of Alaska that we've had planned with friends since before we decided to hike the AT. It's a reunion of a similar trip we did with the same friends back in 2016; it was one of my most favorite trips and I'm looking forward to repeating it! I plan to write about our ANWR trip as part of this journal but won't be able to post the entries until after we get back on July 5th so it'll be a little while before those are up. We also have the annual camping trip with Mat's family in July. Additionally, we'll visit some of my family and friends, and still have some time to hike the last five days of the PCT I haven't finished yet.
We decided we are going to finish the AT this year. We bought plane tickets to Maine and made reservations with hostels and shuttles. We will be starting south bound from Mount Katahdin on July 23rd. We are super excited to see Maine and visit our friends living there as we hike through. Looking forward to seeing Vermont and New Hampshire as well. All three states we've been wanting to explore for a long time and now we will get to hike through them!!","

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653478,"Welcome to our Arctic National Wildlife Refuge mini-journal! We had this trip planned prior to our decision to hike the AT. It's a reunion of a trip we did with our friends in 2016, although this year we're down one (sorry you couldn't make it Rob!) and we're hiking through a different drainage system. I journaled our 2016 trip here. This is our third multi-week foray into the Brooks Mountains and our fourth time camping above the Alaskan Arctic Circle so we feel pretty comfortable (I journaled those trips here and here). Madison, our head honcho, has flown out into ANWR almost every summer since 2009, so we feel super comfortable following her lead. Matt and Krista have ventured into the Brooks Range many more times than we have. The plan is to be out for 12 nights/13 days, although we may be picked up earlier or later depending on the weather. It's the longest we've spent in the backcountry without a resupply. As a result, we're each carrying about 26 pounds in food alone. My pack with gear is 42lbs, Mat is carrying 53lbs. But this trip isn't hiking all day every day. Primarily this trip is about wildlife viewing, particularly the Porcupine Herd caribou migration, and enjoying a beautiful part of the world with fun people! This consists of hiking up a drainage, setting up a base camp, spending a few days day-hiking, then picking up and establishing a new basecamp further along our route; wash and repeat.
Today we caught the 8:15AM flight from Seattle to Fairbanks. We landed at the Fairbanks airport a few hours before check-in time at the AirBnB so we hung out at the airport for a couple hours. Madison called us with an update from pilot Kirk: fog is forecasted for the next few days on the north slope, obscuring our original drop off location, and it may be prudent to have a couple backup destinations on hand to make our decision ""in the air"" tomorrow. This happened last time: Rob, Mat, and I flew out to Arctic Village and didn't know where Madison, Matt, and Krista ended up landing until Kirk showed up to fly us out to them. Such is planning a trip in ANWR! We ate some takeout pizza from House of Fire and poured over the maps to plan out a few routes. Tomorrow, Kirk will fly Madison, Matt, & Krista out, deciding during the flight where to get dropped off. Then Kirk will fly back to Arctic Village to pick us up and take us to wherever Madison, Matt, and Krista end up.","

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654203,"Weather:Morn - Overcast and calm, slightly smokey, 57°FMid - Partly cloudy and breezy, 59°FEve - Overcast and breezy with moderate rain, 48°FSlept really well despite the light outside. Alarms woke us at 5:00AM and we arrived at Kirk's hanger just after 6:00AM. Madison then dropped Mat and I off at the Wright Air hanger where we checked in for our commercial flight to Arctic Village. They weighed our packs, then weighed us holding our our carry-ons. Mat's pack is over the allotted 40lbs so we paid an extra $13 for our check-in luggage. We sat in the little waiting area watching people check-in for their flights to different villages. Many of them were locals flying back home with boxes of food from the Fairbanks grocery store. Life must be so expensive for these folk: pay for round-trip tickets to fly into town, then pay for groceries, then pay the additional fee for excess weight ($1.88 per pound over 40lbs) when flying the groceries back home! Dang. Just before 8:00AM, the pilot called out the names of the passengers loading his plane. Usually this route has a stop in the village of Venetie but none of the passengers needed to stop there so we're going straight through to Arctic Village. We were up in the air by 8:00AM. Once again, as soon as we were up in the air, the pilot let autopilot take over and flew pretty much the whole way without touching the steering! There was a high overcast but a layer of smoke was the real hindrance to visibility. A lightening storm a week or so back started a smattering of small fires across the interior, giving the air a slight haze and smokey smell. North of the Yukon River, however, the smoke cleared and the clouds parted. We landed in Arctic Village at 9:20AM. It was a smooth flight and the smoothest landing I've ever had on a gravel runway, barely felt a thing! A group of locals were hanging out with their ATVs ready to collect family members and groceries. They drove off one by one. The last guy talked with us a bit before heading back into the village. We set our packs by Kirk's refueling station then hung out at the little mobile unit that is the Arctic Village Visitor Center. They used to have tables inside with brochures and maps but it looks like they cleared it out after Covid. Another local came over to chat with us; Arctic Village locals are so friendly!Kirk landed at 10:0AM. He said he was very happy to see us and launched into his miscommunication scare: After he dropped Madison, Matt, and Krista off at the Kongakut, he radioed our Wright Air pilot to see if he dropped off two backpackers at Arctic Village. ""Nope, all locals,"" is what he told Kirk. So Kirk radioed into Wright Air base, he couldn't remember our names but asked if two backpackers flew to Arctic Village. ""Don't think so, but we flew two backpackers to Allakaket."" Kirk thought maybe we got mixed up and flew to the other village that starts with an ""A"", hundreds of miles away! He started thinking of how he was going to have to notify Madison and grab us from Allakaket tomorrow, delaying our trip. So he was real happy to see us at the Arctic Village runway! I guess I feel flattered to be considered a local! He fueled up, loaded our packs, and asked who wanted to be up front. Mat sat in the front last time so he let me sit up front this time. We were up in the air again by 10:15AM! It was a pretty smooth one hour flight to the Kongakut airstrip, a little bit bumpy as we flew into the the bigger mountains. Kirk regaled us with stories of flying as a contractor in Antarctica, Greenland, and the Arctic. He's such a friendly guy and so easy to chat with. We landed at 11:15AM, the rest of our crew chilling above the river, swarmed in mosquitoes in a patch of Arctic Azaleas. Arctic Azaleas are miniature azaleas growing close to the ground with bright fuchsia blooms. So pretty and so neat after spending the spring with azalea trees! Mat and I collected our stove fuel and bear spray that went on Kirk's first flight with the rest of our group, rearranged our packs, and started off across the tundra around 11:45AM. The skies were partly cloudy and we prayed for the breeze to keep blowing and drive down the mosquitoes.We followed the Kongakut upstream to a low pass that cut north to Drain Creek. The views were nice and the walking too. Climbing up the low pass, Mat spotted a grizzly bear a few hundred yards away on the opposite side of the valley. We continued walking until we were straight across and watched it dig for and catch ground squirrels. I don't think it caught our scent so it didn't realize we were watching it from across the valley. It was fun to watch the massive grizzly jump and hop around, trying to catch the little ground squirrels. Once successful, it would chomp away while looking around, much like a dog showing off it got a tasty treat! Matt spotted a couple Dall sheep high up on the cliff above the bear. Dall sheep are like Big Horn Sheep with large curled horns, but are all white like a Mountain Goat. We crested the shallow pass and dropped down towards Drain Creek, the valley narrowing to the point where we had to cross the ice cold stream a couple times. In the mud of the creek we could see tracks for caribou, bear, and wolf. Luckily the bear tracks were moving in the opposite direction of us (and probably belonged to the bear we already saw) but the wolf tracks went in both directions. Madison said she saw wolves in the Drain Creek valley last time she walked through here. I hope we get to see some! There must have been a caribou kill in this part of the little pass because we kept spotting remnants: a patch of hide with fur still attached, wolf dung with a piece of hoof or bone, etc. It was all pretty dried up so not a recent kill but still interesting to see.The low pass opened up again and, just before 5:00PM, we came upon some relatively dry, flat ground less than a mile from Drain Creek and decided to call it for the day. Dark clouds gathered to the south of us. We pitched our tents and set up the bear fence around them. We sat a little bit away from camp to cook and eat dinner while we watched the storm cloud approach. We climbed into our tents as the rain started to fall around 7:15PM. Earlier today, Madison was worried about completing the entire trip as she was having swelling at the site of her operation five months ago. Her surgeon told her it was OK to go on this trip and she felt good prior to the trip. She was thinking she may have to fly back out but we told her we'll take it easy and not over exert ourselves. By the end of the day, the swelling hadn't gotten worse so she felt more optimistic.Daily steps: 12,734","

The rest of the group didn't stir until around 9:00AM. We took our time this morning, reorganizing our food bags and packs. Eventually we packed up and started walking at 11:00AM. Drain creek basin opened up before us as we dropped down the last of our low pass. We immediately forded the creek, which was just under knee-high for my 5'3"" frame, and turned to walk up the gravel of Drain Creek. We came to an open part of the gravel bed which allowed us to see far up the valley. That's when we spotted the white wolf up on the bench just across the river. It looked at us then contoured on the bench above the creek. At one point it laid down to watch us as we sat watching it. But the mosquitoes and flies must have gotten to it because it started snapping the air around it's head. Before long, it took off, cresting the bench and disappearing. Very cool to watch! A rain cloud overtook us as we prepared to continue walking so we donned our rain gear. After an hour or so of walking, the rain cloud moved beyond us and sun came back out. We stopped near a neat aufeis field to dry out during a lunch break. Matt, of course, spotted more Dall Sheep up in the cliffs. We also saw from a far distance two golden eagles and a handful of caribou. We continued up the valley when the next rain cloud hit and we donned our rain gear again. When that cloud passed we stopped for another break to snack and dry out. From that vantage point, Matt spotted more Dall Sheep, a mama grizzly with one cub very far across the valley floor, and a handful of caribou far up Bathtub Ridge. We continued up valley as another rain cloud moved toward us. This rain cloud hit just before we reached our goal for camp so we decided to pitch the kitchen tarp and wait out the deluge. Once that passed, we booked it to an open area Madison remembered from her trip up Drain Creek seven years ago. Around 7:00PM, we found Madison's spot of nice level, open, dry ground and pitched our tents, the kitchen tarp, and the bear fences before the next rain cloud hit. Matt and Krista took a trip up the side drainage to try to get photos of a Dall Sheep they saw prior to setting up camp. Mat, Madison, and I fixed our dinners under the kitchen tarp, watching the rain come down. Matt and Krista returned and reported seeing three bull moose and a bull caribou on their little trip up the side drainage. As we were chatting eating our dinners, we heard a wolf start to howl. We clambered out from under the tarp to see if we could spot it. More voices joined the howling but they were all low in the thick willows lining Drain Creek. We lingered but never did spot the singers. At this point it was nearly 10:00PM, although still plenty of light out. The mosquitoes were pretty thick so we climbed into our tents for the night. There are definitely a lot more mosquitoes and wildflowers than 2016. Daily steps: 16,333","

We'd rather spend more time on the north slope in hopes of catching migrating caribou. The Kandricks were already halfway packed up before the rest of us even began packing! They started out before us so they could sneak up on and watch the herd of Dall Sheep hanging out on a cliff face above the side drainage we are going up. Madison, Mat, and I finished packing and got to walking just after 11:00AM. We moved up the side drainage, away from Drain Creek. We spotted Matt and Krista sitting on the gravel bar below the cliff face, a couple dozen sheep sitting on the ledges above them. We dropped down to the creek and worked our way upstream to join them. There were so many sheep hanging out on the cliff face above the creek: rams, ewes, lambs. They were licking the rock so there must be some mineral they like. We sat for a good hour watching them while we ate lunch. Beautiful big, full curl rams and little baby lambs. So fun to watch!Eventually, we continued up the side drainage, crossing the creek multiple times as we followed it towards a mellow pass over the continental divide. Matt found a rotted Dall sheep skull with horns intact. After a couple hours, we stopped for a snack break. This is when I realized my phone dropped out of my pocket. I knew I dropped it recently so Mat and Matt accompanied me to retrace our path. We walked back to the spot I last remembered having it and we slowly returned. I was scared the phone fell out during a creek crossing but we didn't see it in the clear water so we continued on. Matt spotted it randomly along the caribou trail we were following through willow not too far from where Madison and Krista waited for us. Thank goodness!! After our snack break, we made the final push towards the pass. Walking became much easier with nice caribou trails to follow. Motto of the day became ""The bou will get you through!"" We reached the pass at 4:45PM and stopped for a break to enjoy the view. The mountains to the north were large and steep! We took pics and had an impromptu dance party. Matt was around the corner glassing the surrounding ridges. He spotted a few caribou high up on the ridge of the next peak over. We ate a snack as we looked at the map to decide our route down. We had two options: follow the creek below all the way down to where it intersects the Leffingwell River halfway down it's branch, or cut left/west immediately and go over a few low passes to drop into the headwaters of the Leffingwell. We decided on the latter. We descended the steep north face of the pass then cut left to go over the first low pass. It was after 6:00PM by this point so we climbed the next low hill and found a dry-ish place to camp. We pitched our tents, the bear fence, and grabbed some water. While eating dinner, a group of 30 sheep were spotted on a grassy slope far off in the direction we're heading tomorrow. After 9:00PM we decided to climb into our tents even though the sun was still high in the sky and the evening fairly warm. There are way more mosquitoes here than on the south side. It's good though; maybe the mosquitoes will drive the caribou into migration!Daily steps: 14,845","

The winds shifted and a smokey haze filled the sky. I'm glad we went over the pass yesterday and got to see the mountains in clear skies! We started a little earlier than normal: 10:00AM once we got all our tents and bear fences packed up. We set out west across a series of low passes to reach the headwaters of the Leffingwell. We reached the last pass at around 11:00AM, stopping to take a snack break and scan for animals. We spotted Dall Sheep on the surrounding slopes above us. In fact, we watched one run down the north hill, across the ravine below us, and up the south hill towards its friends. After our break, we descending down the drainage, reaching the upper Leffingwell around 1:00PM. We glassed the valley floor and the surrounding hillsides for animals but only spotted a single caribou on the far side of the river valley. Not far into the wide valley, a mound rose up out of the surrounding flat brushland. We beelined for it and, once on top, determined it would be a good place to camp: a strong breeze to keep the mosquitoes down and a commanding view of the upper valley! Matt and Krista pitched their tent below the mound on the leeward side since their tent is not the best in windy conditions. Madison, Mat, and I pitched our tents on top. Mat and I were hungry so we made ourselves a late hot-lunch and re-evaluated our food inventory while Matt and Krista went on a day hike to see if they could sneak up on the caribou and Madison went to down to the creek to wash up. After our food survey, we followed Madison's lead and did some washing up too. The sun was out (although hazy), the temps warm, and a nice breeze so laundry dried fast! We lounged in the sun watching for critters until Matt and Krista returned from their walkabout. It was dinner time at this point so we fixed up our meals. Still no critters when we retired to our tents around 8:30PM. But what a pretty valley!Daily steps: 11,793","

Morn - Mostly cloudy and breezy with a smokey haze, 61°FMid - Partly cloudy and breezy with a smokey haze, 71°FEve - Mostly cloudy and windy with a smokey haze, 58°F

We anticipated spending a day or so in the upper Leffingwell basin but there were still no animals when we glassed the area this morning. On top of that, tomorrow's weather forecast shows 70% chance of rain with a high of 54°F; a good day to spend in the tent. So we decided to go down the Leffingwell as far as we can to get closer to the north slope. Madison said the same thing happened on a prior trip where they saw no animals in the northern mountain drainages because they were all down on the north slope near the caribou herds. We're hoping that is the case for us. Madison was packed up and started walking before us. Mat and I set out at 9:25AM, the Kandricks still packing up. The ground was firm and quite nice for walking, allowing us to make good time going down the Leffingwell while being serenaded by robins and white-crowned sparrows. At our first break, we spotted a Dall ewe and lamb on a mountain slope and two Golden Eagles soaring up in the air.
We continued down further to a soft, dry lunch spot. The wind was strong and the sun warm so we were able to eat our lunch and lounge in our t-shirts without fear of mosquitoes. The river was a nice class II chute making us wish we had our packrafts with us! Further down valley, we came head-on with a young caribou, who switched to the opposite side of the valley before continuing it's trot up the river. At our next break spot, we sat perched on some rocks looking at the large, thick sheets of aufeis lining the river. Aufeis is ice that has built up on a river over the winter. A river will freeze, causing overflow to occur (river water flowing over the top of the ice), which then also freezes, causing more overflow to occur over that, repeat until a bed of ice forms that can be tens of feet thick! The aufeis below us was wide and up to 10 feet thick so we walked on it for a while before climbing back onto the shelf above the river. The bench above the river had turned to boggy tundra at this point so the going was much slower. But the river was now continuously lined with aufice in various states of decomposition so we couldn't walk the gravel bed.
During our last break, we watched a lone caribou come down river, probably the same one we encountered earlier today. We also started spotting sea and shore birds: a couple Semipalmated Plovers and a Glaucous Gull! We saw a Green-winged Teal floating in a little tundra pond as well. Before long, we came to a flat, dry strip of grass near the river which looked perfect for camping; we may not get another opportunity for a flat, dry campsite for another mile or so, and it was getting on 7:00PM, so we called it a day. We set up our tents and bear fences. We gathered to eat dinner using our big pyramid tent as a wind block. Large slabs of aufeis occasionally slumped into the river, giving off thunderous booms. Clouds are starting to build; we may be staying here tomorrow as well if the rain is pouring down!

Morn - Partly cloudy and breezy, 55°FMid - Most cloudy and windy, 68°FEve - Overcast and raining, 50°F

Woke to sunny skies but Madison needs a day of rest from her swollen surgery site so we enjoyed a lazy morning. The rain was forecasted to move in around 11:00AM but the weather still seemed good at 10:30AM when Mat, Matt, and I took off for a day hike up the ridge. Madison and Krista stayed in camp. We climbed the hillside; it felt good to walk without a heavy pack on! We reached a rounded saddle and sat looking into the large bowl drainage before us, we glassed for critters but didn't see anything so we turned to climb the point north of the pass. We had great views from the point. To the west, we could see the entire basin bowl. To the east, we could see far up and down the Leffingwell: the tents were tiny orange dots on the green tundra below and the mountains across the Leffingwell looked steep and rugged. The aufeis stop just a mile or so down steam and we might have some gravel bars to walk on tomorrow, which would be nice. 
We sat behind the rocky outcropping, out of the wind, enjoying the scenery. We spotted a Northern Shrike plucking bugs off the tundra. We were commenting on how the rain isn't showing up and that there's actually blue sky above us. That's when Matt got up and looked around the backside of our rocky windbreak. The rain is coming, it's sneaking up behind us! So we got to moving back down the slope towards the tents. We rejoined Madison and Krista around 2:00PM and ate some lunch. The wind turned cold so we moved into our prospective tents for the day. Rain finally started at 6:30PM, much later than anticipated but it was good to have a day of rest!

Morn - Mostly cloudy and breezy, 55°FMid - Partly cloudy and breezy, 70°FEve - Mostly cloudy and windy, 58°F

The rain didn't last long overnight and the weather is forecasted to improve so we packed up this morning to keep moving down the Leffingwell. We started moving at 9:30AM, ragged low clouds pushing south to reveal blue skies. The aufeis cleared out so we were able to do some gravel walking. On the tundra, muskeg tussock dominated which made walking difficult. Despite the tussock, we made good time walking down the straight valley. Still didn't see any animals besides some birds: we saw a Golden Eagle soaring high during our lunch break, two semipalmated plovers on the gravel bar, and some American Pipits nesting in the tundra tussock. I spotted a nest with a baby bird freshly hatched, no feathers on its body and curled up sleeping. Surprisingly the mosquitoes weren't bad as we walked.
In the evening we approached a pass we planned to take over the ridge into the Aichilik River valley, which the Leffingwell joins anyway but further downstream than we want to be. Krista thought she heard a howl but it didn't last long, wasn't repeated, and was never answered so she thought maybe she was hearing things. The Leffingwell cliffed out a bit so we climbed to get above it and decided to keep climbing to angle towards the pass. We found a stepped perch to set up our tents on various levels, a overlooking view of the lower Leffingwell valley below as it joins the Aichilik. We fixed and ate dinner as we looked at maps and watched the view. Madison texted Kirk, he informed us that caribou came up the Aichilik a day ago, making new trail in the valley, and more was heading that way. We planned to drop into the Aichilik tomorrow and set up a base camp for a day or two to hopefully catch some caribou, then cross the ridge between the Aichilik and the Jago to our pickup strip 15 miles from there. 
Eventually the clouds covered the sun, making the breeze too cold to sit in, so we retired to our tents. Mat and I were settling in to fall asleep when he decided to go outside to pee one last time. That's when he spotted the wolves: three black ones and a grey were running down the Leffingwell, effortlessly crossing the tussocks. He notified me and Madison, who was camped close to us, then tried to whistle up to the Kandricks, whose tent was above us a ways. They didn't hear him but then one of the wolves barked and howled, which brought the Kandricks out. We watched them lope down the valley towards the Aichilik. I guess Krista heard correctly when she heard a howl earlier! Excited to finally see some wildlife again, we tried to go to bed. Maybe this is a good sign for tomorrow.

We started walking at 9:00AM. As we rounded the mountain, the lower drainage of the Aichilik opened up and we had a direct view out through a gap in the mountains to the open North Slope plains. With binoculars we could see a faint, light, flat line furthest out; possibly the Arctic ocean? It's 50 miles away so maybe, maybe not. As we approached the pass into the Aichilik, we came across a single caribou. It caught wind of us pretty quickly and ran off. We reached the low pass into the Aichilik at 10:45AM and we sat to scan for animals, eat a snack, and discuss crossing points to get across the Aichilik. The mosquitoes absolutely swarmed us while we rested. A dall sheep approached from the northern slope. Matt and Krista started baa-ing at it and it came quite close. Looked to be a young female, separated from her herd and looking for them. We were downwind so she couldn't smell us but decided we looked too funny to be her friends despite sounding like them so she crossed the pass above us to the south side. We eventually dropped down to the bench above the river, spooking a pair of willow ptarmigans on the way down. On the bench above the river, we stopped to debate crossing it now or later. The Aichilik River splits into many braids here, making it appear quite crossable. Our best bet of catching migrating caribou herds is here in the Aichilik valley so we knew we wanted to stay at least one full day here. The Jago pick-up spot is still 15.5 miles, or two days of walking, away. We could cross now and camp on the far side, relaxed knowing the last of our major obstacles is complete, or we can cross later since, on this side, the camping appears better and there are many caribou prints. There is no rain forecasted for the next two days so that should be helpful to let the water drop the longer we wait but one of the tributaries is fed by a glacier, which will produce more water since the temps are forecasted to reach into the high 70's over the next few days. We decided to not cross the Aichilik yet, but will cross it first thing in the morning when we do cross it.We spent another hour picking a campsite; since we'll be here a while we wanted a level site with a nice view to observe for animals, a breeze to keep the mosquitoes down, and nearby side stream since the river has glacial silt. We eventually agreed on a site and set up. Mat and I did our food survey, which brought Matt and Krista over to do some bartering and trading. Food takes on different values out in the Alaska bush! Nutter Butters were traded for a bag of Famous Amos cookies, Doritos for Cheez-its, a Snickers bar for a top ramen. Madison sat in front of her tent giggling at our wheeling and dealing until Matt pulled out a pristine Nutty Buddy ""in mint condition"". Then she pulled out her food bag to trade for that Nutty Buddy. With trades complete, we moved on to other camp chores such and bathing and laundry. We kept scanning for critters but didn't see anything besides birds. A couple of American Pipits kept a close watch on us, chirping at us anytime we left the campsite; they must have a tundra nest nearby. On the river we watched a few pairs of gulls and some Red Breasted Mergansers. Smoke crept back into the southern skies, obscuring the view of the high peaks in the back of the valley. The smoke is pretty thick back there, making us wonder if the fire is closer than we thought. The wind stopped and the mosquitoes swarmed us as we ate dinner. After dinner, we spotted a big, dark caribou on a grassy patch upriver. It had some nice antlers. But it moved up a side drainage and didn't come our way. Mat and I went to the overlook at the edge of the tundra bench to look out over the river as the sun dropped down to circle around. We eventually went back to the tent. At 11:00PM, the sun cleared the big mountain and swung north over some low open hills so I got out of my sleeping bag to get some pictures. Such a pretty night!Daily steps: 10,578","

It was bright and warm by 6:30AM. Still no animals to be seen this morning but we'll be spending the day here so hopefully something will reveal itself. After a leisurely breakfast, Matt, Krista, Mat, and I went on a dayhike downstream to see what we could see. Madison stayed in camp to rest her knee and protect camp from critters. The four of us walked down river about a mile to the far side of the next bend where we could see down the valley. Didn't see any animals but did see a group of four male merganser ducks. The river looked very crossable below us so we decided to try it out to see how fordable the Aichilik is during midday. We were able to cross it with some back and forth, wading no deeper than the knee for us short girls. On the far side, we climbed the bluff to scope out possible campsites for tomorrow. We found a suitable area and stopped to glass the hills. Still no animals, although there are more trails and bones on this side, including a small caribou leg left over from a kill not very long ago. We dropped back down to the river closer to camp and found another passable fording path. Matt found a large dall horn; pretty degraded but a full, tight curl; possibly 11 or 12 years old. We didn't find the second horn. Madison was down by the river so Matt and Krista went over to her while Mat and I went back to our tent, hungry for a late lunch. After lunch was nap time. When we woke, I spotted a young female caribou crossing the river a mile upstream. Matt saw it before it went into the willows but it was out of sight by the time everyone else got their binoculars in hand. While scanning around, Mat spotted a grizzly bear climbing up out of the willows in the riverbed up the mountain slope about 700 yards away. We watched it nonchalantly walk up hill, sticking its head in ground squirrel holes, sniffing the ground, and looking around. It climb up to a little ledge and laid down. It napped for at least an hour and a half, if not two hours, on its little tundra nest! We ate dinner while watching it slumber, also watching the single young female caribou running around crazy from the mosquitoes. After we ate our dinner, the bear woke up. It must have finally caught wind of us because it quickly headed back upstream away from us, stopping to scent the air occasionally. It was gone before long. At this point the caribou came trotting down stream along the river directly below us, it was a pretty, dark caribou with a brindle face. Krista and Matt jogged over to the ledge looking down into the river to try to get some good photos but it must have crossed the river into the willows on the opposite side before they got to the ledge because they never saw it up close. Madison saw it crossing the river further downstream after a while. We all got up to the top of the knoll behind camp to watch it trot out of sight. That's when Krista spotted the porcupine trundling across the tundra about 50 yards in front of us. At first we thought it was a wolverine but realized it was moving way too slow. Binoculars defined the critter as a porcupine and we watched it beeline to the nearby creek. Madison said she's never seen porcupine in ANWR before. After all the critter excitement, Mat and I walked down to the ledge overlooking the river. We didn't see any critters, even the ducks and gulls had moved on, but it was a pretty night. A warm and buggy night, too! We did a weather check and there is a 40% chance of rain forecasted for our pickup day on Tuesday, worse weather on Wednesday. Weather forecast can still change, but we decided to get moving tomorrow to arrive at the pickup airstrip a day early just in case Kirk is able to get us before the storm moves in. Our friends don't have work for a few more days so they can stay an extra two days in the bush if need be but Mat and I have our flight to Seattle which would be a pain to reschedule so we'd rather get out a day early than be stuck for two extra days. We'll see what happens.Daily steps: 12,758","

We started out at 10:00AM this morning, immediately dropping to the Aichilik River to cross. The river was slightly higher than yesterday but still crossable, reaching just above the knee for us short girls. We showed Madison all the things we saw yesterday: the ram's horn and caribou leg. She found an old caribou skull we missed. We entered the large drainage of an unnamed creek opposite of where we camped; it will lead us to a small, high pass over to the Jago river, dropping us down right at the landing strip. The mouth of the unnamed drainage was wide and the stream at the bottom braided out. The wildflowers were blooming in high density until we turned off the main valley floor up the narrow north branch, which was choked with tall willow. We followed up the north branch for a bit until we found a fantastic place to eat a late lunch by a clear little brook with shady willow bushes; it was perfect for the heat. Many White-crowned sparrows serenaded us while we ate. After lunch, we continued up the north branch of the unnamed drainage. We came upon an area with a high concentration of bear poops: we'd see a bear poop every 50 yards or so. We made a lot of noise going through the willows here; we did not want to surprise a grizzly! We saw smaller bear prints so it's probably a mama with cub. The willows became shorter and the wind stopped. It was hot in the narrow rocky valley with no wind. The water in the main drainage dried up but each little side drainage would drop water down to the valley floor before disappearing underground. Just before 5:00PM, we reached the last flat-ish area on the map before the drainage becomes more canyon-like and starts climbing to the pass. A large, clear creek flowed out of a side drainage so we thought it would be a good place to camp before we got caught in steeper terrain. We sent the Mat(t)s up on a bench to find camping spots since they're both so picky about where they pitch their tents. Once surveyed, we all climbed up to the bench above the drainage. A slight breeze was blowing as we set up camp. We each took a turn to wash up at the creek below then settled down to eat dinner. While eating, we kept hearing the chirp of a predatory bird in the cliffs across the valley but couldn't find it. After dinner, we were chatting when Madison walked behind the tents to look up the side drainage we were camped at the mouth of. She spotted a mama grizzly with two cubs about 700 yards up the drainage. We all jumped up with our binoculars and cameras and watched the mama graze in a grassy patch while her two cubs wrestled each other. We climbed higher up the bench to get a better, closer look. We watched them for a bit. We could also see further up the drainage to the mountains surrounding our pass that we'll go over tomorrow. Madison found a feather that did not look like a golden eagle and spotted the nest of the predatory bird we've been hearing: perched on top of a rock spire sticking out of the scree slopes on the opposite side of the valley is what looked and sounded like a Peregrine falcon. It was about 9:00PM at this point and the mosquitoes aggressive, so we retired to our tents. A thunderhead that built up over the evening boomed out a couple peals of thunder far away. Maybe we'll get a spot of rain. Madison heard from Kirk this evening: the smoke is so thick in Fairbanks he wasn't able to fly today and that he might be able to get three of us out on Monday while the other two may have to spend another night or two out here. We told him we'll be at the Jago airstrip tomorrow evening to give him the most flexibility to decide when to grab us. But if it's too smokey, we may have to wait an extra day or two until the rain clears. We'll see what happens.Daily steps: 18,303","

They packed up and started walking about 9:00AM while the rest of us didn't get to walking until 9:40AM. The mama grizzly and cubs were gone. We continued up the unnamed drainage, the walls getting narrower and the floor becoming more rocky. A single female caribou came down stream towards us, probably spooked by the Kandricks ahead. She effortlessly trotted around us. We caught the Kandricks during their break before the final turn up to the pass. We rounded the corner and started the last of the climb. It was definitely hot with barely a breeze, the mosquitoes swarming us. We reached the pass at 12:50PM and sat to eat lunch while enjoying the view: to the west were the high peaks above the Jago, to the east we could see the peaks above the Aichilik. The east side was definitely more smokey, the Jago side was clear. But a thunderhead was building up quickly to the south of us so we started moving down the pass as thunder boomed. The descent wasn't as steep as it looked on the topo maps. We dropped into an amazing, open, flat valley carpeted with the most Mountain Aven flowers Madison has ever seen. We spread out, walking slowly to take in the beauty. The valley turned a corner and narrowed, the tall peaks west of the Jago rising up taller as we descended. The mosquitoes came back with a vengeance, flying up our noses. We descended the last steep pitch down to the Jago valley, vistas opening up to the north and south. As I was walking down the tundra slope I was charged by a mama Willow Grouse protecting her five chicks. I backed up and went around to avoid distressing them. Krista and I tried to warn Madison, who was behind us, but she was charged by the grouse as well!We reached the landing strip at 4:15PM and did a little celebratory jig. We pitched our tents but it was really hot so we found a place to cool off in the Jago. We cooked dinner as a thunderhead over the mountains to the west blocked out the sun and made the temps much more tolerable. By the time we finished dinner, we saw a wall of rain advancing down the valley towards us. We secured our belongings as lightening flashed. The river had definitely swelled since we first arrived and we were watching it eat away at the tundra at the south end of the air strip. There was plenty more landing space but it was interesting to see. Mat noticed a bunch of dust kick up on a large gravel bar downstream. We all thought it was just the wind picking up sand but I kept the binoculars on the area. I saw a lump that looked like an animal but wasn't moving so I thought it was a bush. I continued to watch it and saw it move. It was big and furry, possibly a muskox but I thought a grizzly was more likely. I told the others I saw a bear but when Matt trained his super nice binoculars on it he said it was a muskox! We shouted to Madison, who had made her way upstream to get a closer look at the calving tundra. At that point the rain hit hard. I was ready to go out in my rain gear to get closer to the muskox for photos but Madison said they don't move much so we piled into our tents to wait out the deluge. Lightening flashed and thunder rolled. Eventually the rain let up enough for us to venture out in our rain gear. We walked half a mile downstream to be straight across from the muskox; thunder, lightening, and rain starting up again. When we reached a good spot, the muskox was laying down in the bushes with it's back to us. We took some photos but there is no way to tell it's muskox versus a grizzly bear. We didn't know how long it'll be lying down so we decided to go back to camp. We agreed that anyone who gets up in the middle of the night is to check on its status and wake the group if it's up and about. We walked back to camp, lightening still flashing but the rain easing. Matt found some exposed permafrost. It was cool to see the ice under the soil. The rain stopped by the time we reached our tents. Madison corresponded with Kirk throughout the day. Apparently the smoke in Fairbanks has kept him grounded for a few days. He thinks he should come get us in the morning to minimize the disruption from smoke and before the next multi-day rain storm comes. Our options are to either get picked up a day early or have to stay out an additional three days. We are to give Kirk a ground weather report at 6:00AM tomorrow morning and he'll make the decision whether or not to come get us based on the smoke in Fairbanks. He's hoping he'll get all five of us out, taking Mat and I to Arctic Village first, then going back for the rest to bring all the way to Fairbanks. We'll see what happens tomorrow. Daily steps: 22,273","

About an hour later, he responded with a 10:00AM pick-up time. Since we had extra time and the muskox moved out of its willow bed, we walked down to the river to get some shots of the muskox. He wasn't standing very long before he laid down again. We went back to camp to finish packing up all our gear. At 9:25AM I noticed my phone was missing, again. I pulled everything out of my pack, walked down to the river where we took photos, then walked back to go through the backpack again. Madison found it next to the river. She is my hero! I need to get a bright case for my phone, or find hiking pants with deeper pockets but that's nearly impossible as a woman. We were all packed up and ready for pick-up by 10:00AM but Kirk didn't arrive until 10:35AM. The smoke is too unpredictable to fly in and out of Fairbanks so he's going to fly all of us to Arctic Village and spend the night himself at Fort Yukon so he's available to get his other clients out. He said he's been refusing to drop new clients into ANWR right now because the smoke makes it too unpredictable when he can pick them back up; something he said he's never had to do in the past. Kirk had Mat and I up in the air by 10:55AM, flying right over our muskox friend. He jumped up and did a 180° but that was it. We had a gorgeous flight back to Arctic Village over high peaks with hanging glaciers. He flew us over the bundle of mountains that comprises the headwaters of the Hula hula, Sheenjek, Chandalar, and Jago Rivers. The skies were clear and the ride wasn't bumpy. Flying low over the East Chandalar River, I spotted a moose in a pond but very last second so didn't get to notify Kirk or Mat. We landed in Arctic Village at 11:45AM. The air was much warmer here and thunderheads had built up in neighboring mountains. But Kirk turned right back around to get Madison, Matt, and Krista. Mat and I fixed ourselves up a large lunch (we had been rationing our food just in case we were stuck for a few days due to smoke), then headed over to the visitor center where I napped on the patio on my sleeping pad while Mat looked through a Hubble Space Telescope coffee table book. Kirk returned with the rest of our group around 1:30PM. Sarah, one of the elders of the village, came up on her 4-wheeler to exchange news with Kirk. She informed us the village was having a BBQ with races and fire works to celebrate 4th of July and invited us down. Kirk took off for Fort Yukon and we secured our belongings when Sarah came back with Edward driving a 4-wheeler and Donald driving a side-by-side. We all piled in and were driven into the village, which is about a mile from the landing strip. We were fed cheeseburgers, bratwurst, salad, spaghetti, and oranges. Mat went to the store to buy 16oz sodas for $4 each. We watched the races, each race with different contestant categories: 0-5 years old, 6-12, 13-17, adult women, adult men, elders women,.and elders men. They held running races, money grab, carry-a-partner, then moved to the bubble gum race and ended with a funny faces competition. It was great. Matt and Mat partook in the run races, Krista and Madison did the piggyback ride race, and Madison and I tried our luck at the bubble gum race. Kids were firing off firecrackers during the whole shindig.After the festivities, there was an hour long break before bingo started, which seemed to be the top excitement for the village. They invited us to play but it was a $30 buy-in, plus we were tired from 11+ days in ANWR. We didn't see another person for that entire trip so it was a little bit overwhelming, to be honest. But we enjoyed ourselves. We walked the mile back to the air strip and sat under the awning of the porch of the Welcome Center while the sun baked. Kirk texted us to inform us that he has two more seats reserved on tomorrow's Wright Air flight out of Arctic Village to Fairbanks. The last person he will pick up and fly to Fort Yukon where they can catch a commercial flight to Fairbanks. Just before 7:00PM it cooled enough for us to pitch our tents and fix dinner. Kirk has extra fuel containers in his box on the airstrip but no water so Mat grabbed some water to boil from the East Fork Chandalar River. Thunder boomed in the surrounding hills. We fell asleep to the sound of gentle rain tapping our tent.","

Woke and enjoyed a leisurely breakfast before it became too hot to sit in our tents. At that point we packed up and moved up to the Visitor Center where it was cooler and less buggy. At 9:15AM the Wright Air plane landed. The pilot had Mat and I on the list, plus passengers Kirk 1 and Kirk 2. We asked about getting Matt on the flight but apparently more passengers will be picked up in Venetie on our way back to Fairbanks. Matt stayed behind. Just as we got to the runway, Madison received notification that there is room for all five of us on the flight. Kirk had messaged us earlier but Matt turned off the In-Reach so we didn't get the message until now. Mat tapped the pilot on the shoulder to let him know but the pilot shook his head and took off. The locals said there was a second flight coming to the village in a couple of hours so maybe he can catch that flight. We sent a message to Kirk to let him know Matt is still in Arctic Village. 
We took flight at 9:35AM, landing in Venetie for a five minute layover to add one passenger. There was definitely room for Matt on this flight. It was a smokey flight back to Fairbanks, not much visibility at all and we could smell the smoke in the air. We landed in Fairbanks at 11:15AM. We checked in at the office and found out the next flight to Arctic Village was stopping in Deadhorse and Kaktovik as well so it'll be a long while before it comes into Fairbanks. The flights out of Arctic Village are completely full for the next few days so it wouldn't work to catch tomorrow's flight. Matt's only option to get to Fairbanks today was to have Kirk get him to Fort Yukon before 2:00PM to make today's cargo flight to Fairbanks. No one was able to get ahold of Kirk, which means he's probably flying other clients. At least Matt was currently enjoying some moose soup at Sarah's house. There was nothing more we could do so we drove to the pizza place next to the hangers to eat some lunch. While eating, we received word Kirk picked up Matt and brought him to Fort Yukon where he's waiting for the cargo flight to come up from Fairbanks so he can get on board. Madison has work tomorrow and can't wait for Matt to fly in that evening followed by a six-hour drive back to Anchorage so she booked a flight to Anchorage this afternoon using miles. Krista will wait for Matt and the two of them will drive Madison's car back to Anchorage. We loitered at the pizza joint, looking at photos and changing into our cotton clothes. Krista then dropped Madison, Mat, and I off at the Fairbanks airport. While hanging at the airport, Madison got a text from Krista saying Wright Air cancelled their cargo flight to Fort Yukon so now Matt is stranded in Fort Yukon. So frustrating. If we had gotten Kirk's message earlier, all of us would have arrived in Fairbanks early and for much less cost. But because we didn't get the message on time, and the pilot didn't want to stop, we'll have pay more money for the flight to Fort Yukon and Matt and Krista are delayed for who knows how long. Luckily Krista has friends in Fairbanks she can stay with. 
We sat with Madison until her flight boarded, then waited another hour for our plane to board. We had an uneventful flight back to Seattle, landing just after 10:00PM. I checked in with the group after we landed: I guess Wright Air changed their mind about the cargo flight to Fort Yukon and Matt was able to get back to Fairbanks. They were currently on the road near Denali. Nice!! We picked up our checked backpacks and caught the shuttle home, finally arriving there at midnight.
Mat and I will be visiting my family for a few days, then we're driving down to California to finish the last 100 miles of the PCT I haven't completed (Donner Pass to Buck's Lake). After the PCT we will visit with Mat's family for their annual RV camping trip. On the 22nd, we'll fly to Maine, then start southbound from Katahdin on the 23rd.","

Eve - Clear and breezy, 83°F

We had a nice break: Got to visit some good friends we hadn't seen for a while; had a fantastic time up in Alaska; enjoyed some fun, quality time with family; and we were able to finish the last 115 miles of the PCT so that trail is now completed! Quite a lot packed into five weeks!
Back to the Appalachian Trail now, but not without it's hiccups! Yesterday morning started with an emergency trip to the dentist. The day before, my little nephew pushed a metal swing into a wild trajectory, hitting me squarely on my left front tooth as I was squatting to talk to him. Luckily it was a single, clean break with no pain or sensitivity. The chip was identical to Jim Carrey's character from Dumb and Dumber! Although there was no pain, it was a stressful thing to happen the day before leaving on a three month hike! I saved the chipped-off piece in a baggie of milk and luckily found a dentist who saw me 24hrs later. The dentist was able to bond the chip into place but I won't be able to do any direct, difficult bites like an uncut apple or corn on the cob, etc, until I get a crown sometime in the future. Glad I was able to get it taken care of before the flight out! 
Last night we caught our red-eye flight to Bangor, Maine. We took off just before midnight and landed in Newark, N.J. at 7:30AM for an hour layover. Luckily, there wasn't any delays so a short layover wasn't an issue. Descending into Newark, our seats on the left side of the plane provided us with a cool view of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty during landing. The pilot reported it was already 82°F outside at 7:30AM! 
The short flight to Bangor was uneventful; that is, until we sought Mat's checked backpack. We landed at 11:00AM and were considering what to do with 6.5 hours of free time before the bus to Medway arrives at 5:30PM. But when we arrived at the baggage carousel, there was no backpack. I carried on my backpack but Mat checked his with our knife and trekking poles. When we looked up the baggage claim number, the last scan was from unloading in Newark; Mat's backpack never made it onto our plane to Bangor! We spoke with the airline agent, she put in a request to have his backpack loaded onto the 3:10PM flight from Newark to Bangor. Now we just have to wait. We loitered in front of the airport for a bit, thinking of our options in case his backpack was lost permanently. I have the tent and my stuff; Mat would need to replace his backpack, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, stove, ground cloth, tent stakes, clothing, and food. We could probably wrangle all those up in three days or so but it would be expensive purchasing all of that equipment in one go, not to mention the price of staying in town for three or so days waiting for the packages to arrive. Eventually we headed to the local supermarket to get some food we still needed to buy for the upcoming section, then to McDonald's to eat some lunch and loiter in the air-conditioned building. Although not as hot as Sacramento Valley's 100+°F days, it was still 90°F (with a cool breeze) so it was nice to not have to sit out in the sun. We met two young hikers who summited Katahdin today and were on their way back home. At 3:15PM, I checked the status of Mat's luggage on the app and it stated the backpack was put on the 3:10PM flight, arriving at 4:45PM! Mat walked the mile back to the airport while I stayed with my stuff and the groceries at McDonald's. At 5:00PM, I walked the 0.3 miles to the Concord Coach Lines station where the Cyr bus will show up. Mat messaged me a pic of his backpack on the luggage carousel! He walked back in his 'overdrive stride' and arrived at the bus station 10 minutes before the bus! Such a relief to have all our gear and not have to spend money and time replacing it all!
Uneventful bus ride to Medway where the AT Lodge Shuttle was waiting for us. A couple from Calgary joined us, first time hikers going southbound. Air Bud was our shuttle driver and got us checked in. They opened the gear shop so we could purchase fuel and any last minute necessities. We were shown to a very hot, non-air-conditioned room where we repackaged our food and reorganized our gear. We have to be in the driveway at 5:45AM tomorrow for the 6:00AM shuttle to Baxter State Park. Shouldn't be too hard to fall asleep after a night of little sleep and stressful day!

It was just the two of us in the shuttle today. It was a pretty drive up to Baxter State Park, passing multiple ponds and lakes surrounded by woods. We arrived to Katahdin Stream Campground just after 7:00AM. We talked with the ranger issuing day-hiking permits for Katahdin. ""What's your name? What's your trailname? Where are you staying tonight? Oh you're hiking out of the park today? So you'll be hiking 20 miles total with the Katahdin climb?"" He was super nice, we just kind of laugh because it feels like we are trying to convince another person that we're crazy. ""Yes, we are hiking out of the park today, because we're crazy. Yes we are going to hike 20 miles including climbing Katahdin, because we're crazy.""We obtained our permits, hung our food bags laden with six days of food for the 100-mile wilderness (which lays just south of the Baxter State Park boundary), and were on trail by 7:30AM. It was a fun climb. The grade wasn't too steep until we reached the treeline. Then the trail goes up a series of boulders and rocks, requiring us to put away our trekking poles so we could use our hands to scramble up the rock faces. For 0.7 miles we rock-scrambled up the ""trail"" until we reached the Katahdin highlands plateau; the last 1.5 miles to the terminus is a nice, flat alpine stroll. We reached the summit and AT terminus at 10:30AM. The view was beautiful! You could see out in all directions; multiple lakes, ponds, and creeks marked the forested land below. The air was slightly hazy for some reason. There were a few groups of people at the top but it wasn't too crowded. We took some photos and sat for a break. At 11:00AM, we started back down. Down-climbing the boulders took longer than climbing up them! I'm glad we had good weather! I can't imagine trying to get off this mountain in poor weather or fog, or worse a lightening storm! Some dark puffy clouds formed as we dropped down but nothing came of them. After dropping below treeline, Mat was dive-bombed by some sort of white bird but the bird couldn't get too close to him due to tree branches. (He thought it was possibly an Osprey but we later found out Northern Goshawks live in these forests and are known to dive at hikers so that's probably what it was.)We reached the Katahdin Stream Campground again just before 2:00PM. We ate a late lunch before heading out at 2:30PM. The trail meanders pleasantly through forests past ponds. We walked past a Ruffed Grouse, who was showing off his black feather necklace. Walking by Daicey Pond got me wondering what the difference is between a lake and a pond. I was under the impression that a pond was a small, grassy body of water that could dry up during dry years, whereas a lake doesn't really dry up. But Daicy looked like a lake and yet was named a pond. Hmmm. Eventually the trail joined Nesowadnehunk creek and followed it down to West Branch Penobscot River. The creek flowed over large slabs of granite rock, similar to Sierra creeks but the water was warm and stained with tannins from the deciduous forest. We stopped to take a swimming break at a flat, smooth granite slab. Mat enjoyed his swimming hole a lot because there were ripe blueberries right on shore and the back eddy came up strong like hot tub jets! After our break, we continued down, passing many blueberries and toads as we made our way to the Penobscot River. The river was large and moving slightly faster than our hiking speed, which made me want our packrafts! We followed the West Branch Penobscot River out of Baxter State Park, reaching the border by 7:00PM. There was a lovely beaver pond at the border and a nice view of Katahdin beyond. We quickly found ourselves a place to set up camp. Fireflies came out after dark. They're not ones that stay glowing for a few seconds like in North Carolina, these ones flash like cameras in a stadium. It was cool to see them again, I wasn't expecting that! I think we'll sleep good tonight!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Katahdin Kalyn Mat: Blueberry PoolDaily steps: 46,918Elevation gain: 5075ft","Katahdin Stream Campground

But we are camped between a beaver pond and the Penobscot River. Mat's shirt and shorts were hung on some bushes outside so they were wetted through. But the sun was super intense so once it crested over the treetops things started to dry quickly. We were walking by 7:30AM, promptly getting pulled into the Abol Bridge Store. There was a line of people waiting for breakfast but the store clerk said it was for people staying at their campground (on the north side of the road, not the state campground on the south side) so we purchased a few items from the store to eat. After eating our purchases outside, we continued on at 8:15AM, immediately entering the 100-mile wilderness. Although crossed with dirt roads, intermittent cell service, and even a railway towards the southern end, it is 100 miles to the next town so it's call the 100-mile wilderness for the AT. The trail meandered through dense forest. It was hot and humid with no airflow but at least it was shady! There were so many toads on trail, all different sizes. Eventually we climbed and crested a granite ridge, busting out of the trees for some views and a breeze. There were even ripe blueberries! But it didn't last long and the trail dropped back into the forests. We reached Rainbow Lake at noon and stopped for a swim and lunch. The skies were overcast now but it was still very hot. Fortunately, the water was clear, cool, and deep. Along the shallow shoreline we watch some crawfish and long leeches swim about. After our break, we spend the next couple hours hiking along side Rainbow Lake, then past Rainbow Dam to Rainbow Badwater. That's a weird name for a lake. We took an afternoon break at Rainbow creek, Mat going for a second swim. The trail then follows Rainbow Creek through a series of neat shallow canyons alternating with wide grassy swamps. No moose though, not even signs of them. Around 6:00PM the clouds grew dark, so dark a Barred Owl start hooting. But it wasn't getting late, it was a thundercloud blocking out the sun through the overcast. We received intel from a southbounder that all campsites for the next four miles were occupied. We didn't want to risk camping at the viewpoint up 1100ft during a thunderstorm so we set up camp early along Pollywog Creek. Mat had his third swim of the day!! An older, northbound couple set up camp next to us. As we ate dinner on the creek the thundercloud rolled and rain started to fall. We crawled into our tent and promptly fell asleep. It's on the early side but we both felt very tired from the heat today.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Rainbow BadwaterMat: Third swimDaily steps: 31,877Elevation gain: 1975ft","Old State Road, ME (Mile 14.8)

It drizzled on and off over night, which continued into the day. We started walking by 8:00AM, climbing up Nesuntabunt Mountain where we stopped for a snack break. The top had a nice view of Mt. Katahdin and the large lakes surrounding our immediate vicinity. We dropped down to Nahmakanta Lake for a lunch/swim break. Mat was swimming around in the lake despite a dark rain cloud coming; lucky for him the cloud never did anything. After lunch, the trail paralleled the shore of Nahmakanta Lake, then the banks of Nahmakanta Stream. We started seeing piles moose scat, but still no moose!
In the afternoon, we came upon a wide sandy beach at Jo-Mary Lake so we stopped for another swim/snack break. Thunder clouds were scattered across the sky, some dropping rain. But the lake was warm so I walked down the beach to where the lake floor was free of aquatic plants and waded out to my knees. Mat piped up from the beach, ""wow look at that rain falling!"" ""I know, it looks cool,"" I replied looking at a streaming rain cloud far to the south. Then I turned to the right and saw a wall of rain moving fast across the lake towards us! I turned and, laughing, ran as fast as I could out of the water and down the sandy beach to our gear under a pine tree. I reached the sheltered spot just as the rain overtook me. I sat under the pine tree and deployed my umbrella. Mat was laughing at me running from the rain! I'm going to get wet anyway so why not just get in the water? The rain shower didn't last long and the sun came back out. We swam in the warm lake; it's nice to cool off, wash off, and wash the clothes all in one go! After swimming, we retreated back to our gear to eat some food and dry a bit. I saw what looked like a turtle head poke out of the surface of the water down by where we swam. I told Mat about it, and 10 minutes later, another turtle head broke the surface in front of us about 15-20 yards out. I pointed it out to Mat; he thinks it might be a snapping turtle but we'll have to look up what turtles live around here. (There are snapping turtles living in Maine lakes.)
Eventually we started walking again, easy terrain to walk on. We reached Cooper Brook at a point where it was a tranquil beaver pond. The sun was low and the day calm. We spotted a beaver serenely swimming in it's pond. We followed Cooper Brook until 7:30PM when we stopped for camp. We enjoyed a wash in the brook and dinner before bed. More of those flashing fireflies tonight in the trees as we fell asleep.

We slept in this morning, camped next to the noise-drowning creek, so we didn't start hiking until 9:00AM. Immediately we hit Jo-Mary Road. Kristin - of 100 Mile Wilderness Inn - was parked there, having just dropped off a shuttle patron. She offered to take our trash, which was awesome! The trail followed Cooper Brook. We stopped at Cooper Brook Falls Shelter. It looked like a super cool shelter: clean with an awesome swimming hole right in front. The privy was nice too. While using the privy, I couldn't help but laugh at the placement of signs. There was the typical ""Please don't put trash in the privy, we have to fish it out and we're just volunteers"" sign. But immediately underneath that sign was one advertising becoming a Maine Hiking Club volunteer! Someone in the Maine Hiker's Club has a sense of humor!
We stopped at Crawford Pond (more like a lake) for lunch and Mat's swim. Then we started the rough southern half of the 100-mile wilderness: lots of steep climbs and less swimming. The first climb didn't even have a view at the top before going right back down. The noise of distant heavy machinery 'serenaded' us all afternoon as we walked through the forests, possibly some forestry equipment? But we passed by multiple interesting fungi: orange mushrooms with yellow spotted caps, ones shaped like waffle cones, large gray flat ones the size of dinner plates. There were lots of red squirrels: small squirrels that aren't very wary of humans. We saw a couple of small snakes as well but they move too fast into the underbrush to identify.
We stopped at East-Branch Lean-to to use the privy. There, we met Garmin and Coach, flip floppers heading south to Virginia; Blaine, a southbounder from Colorado; and Mermaid, a section hiker from Germany. Next was the big climb up White Cap Mountain, a steep climb into alpine territory. The views from the top were fantastic so we stopped for a snack break. We followed the ridge down to the next peak, the trail winding through dense spruce forest with moss ground cover. We reached Sidney Tappan Campsite at 7:30PM so we set up camp for the night.

We dropped off the last of White Cap ridge down to West Branch Pleasant River. The river goes through a canyon called Gulf Hagas but it is a loop off the AT so we didn't walk it. It must be a popular day-hike, however, as we walked past many day-hikers. We had our first wet crossing: West Branch Pleasant River was too wide to rock-hop across. But it was only calf-deep and slow. After the river crossing was another climb, this one up a series of peaks towards Barren Mountain. In between peaks, the trail dropped into a small bog. Flowering Purple Pitcher plants littered the bog. They were very neat to see! Apparently there are Broad Leaf Sundew in the bog but we didn't see any. We continued on, the trail following the ridge. We stopped for a snack break but our filtering ended up taking longer than ur snacking. We've been using the Katadyne BeFree filter. It worked great when we first started in Georgia. But since then, it's slowed significantly. We have to push on the Hydrapak bladder so hard the seams have started to burst. It literally took us 45 minutes to filter three liters. We're definitely going to replace our water treatment system when we get into Monson tomorrow. We reached Barren Peak just after 7:00PM. We didn't have a whole lot of water for camping so we pushed on, planning to reach Long Pond Stream for camp. But then we came upon Barren Ledges, a south-facing cliff overlooking mountains and lakes. The sun was setting, turning the clouds pink. We decided we would rather ration our water than drop back into the forest, missing this amazing view and sunset. We pitched our tent at a nearby stealth site and went back to the ledges to enjoy our dinner as the sky turned dark. Trailnames of the Day:Mat: Three by 9:00 - Mat had earned himself three trailnames by 9:00AM.

Town day today so 7:30AM start this morning. We dropped down Barren Mountain, sweating just as much going down as we do going up. That's one thing I've noticed about Maine: the downhills are so steep, it takes just as long to go down as they would going up. We saw quite a few large toads though, about the size of baseballs. Off the ridge, we crossed a series of nice streams. We met Robinhood at one of them, a southbounder but seems to be experienced. We moved along, stopping for lunch at Little Wilson Stream. We pushed hard but the trail went over numerous ups and downs, each climb and descent comprised of thigh-high rocks. The flat trail in between was veined with tall roots, creating an uneven surface, so even walking the flat parts required attention and balance.
We eventually reached Highway 15 at 4:22PM. We stuck out our thumb and hitched a ride within minutes from a guy who was headed to the same place as us. We have a reservation for the Lakeshore House Lodge and Pub. The pub has open mic night on Thursdays so he was driving down with his guitar! We were down in Monson and shown to our room before 4:45PM! I know I've said this before but it must have been the best shower I've ever had washing away six days of sweat. We started laundry right away but luckily the inn had loaner clothes so we were able to go down to the pub to get food. They had a cute outdoor area with colorful picnic tables and adirondack chairs overlooking a small dock protruding into Lake Hebron. Although it was hot earlier today, the skies clouded up and the temperature was quite comfortable. The food was delicious! After eating, however, my knees and feet were feeling beat up so Mat walked to the gas station to get us ice cream while I went back to the room the be horizontal the rest of the day! The southern half of the 100-mile wilderness was quite rugged and, if I knew then what I know now, I would have planned to do it in six days instead of five; ease the body into it and be able to take more time on those steep descents, more time swimming, maybe even hike the Gulf Hagas. But we had our reservation in Monson so we didn't have much of an option. Now we are free of reservations so we can take our time and not hurt ourselves on the rocky, rooty Maine trails. As we relaxed and watched a movie in bed, the clouds opened up and it rained heavily. Nice to be inside!

Kalyn: Pyschopath - I was seriously craving milk so, when we sat for dinner at the pub, I ordered a glass and downed it.

Monson is a cute town! A small main street sandwiched between forests and Lake Hebron, lined with old wooden buildings, some of them built on brick foundations sticking into the waters of the lake. Our lodge was cute too: a three-story old house with the pub on the ground level, the lodging on the second, and owner's quarters on top. The lodge property backs up to the lake so they have a nice outdoor eating area and a dock. It's very nice and we enjoyed our stay immensely. Only one other couple was staying there - a young, quiet European couple - so it was a quiet and peaceful stay. After breakfast, we went back to our room to finish chores; it was a 10:00 check-out time so we didn't have much time to dally. Out of the room by 10:00, we sat in the common area trying to decide which town stops to do through Maine. It's kind of difficult on the AT, there are so many towns near the trail and they're so frequent that it's hard to know which ones are good and which ones can be skipped. Sometimes, there are two good towns in a row but they're only 30 miles apart and we don't want to spend the money and time going into town so frequently, so we have to decide which ones to hit and which ones to skip. We are going to take it easy, though, through Maine and New Hampshire due to the unforgiving trail grade. Noon rolled around so we headed downstairs for lunch. We are in no rush to get out of town today because we are meeting some friends of ours Sunday evening at Caratunk 37 miles away. If we rush out of here this morning, we would arrive in Caratunk too early and, considering we got into Monson on the late side yesterday, we wanted to make the most of this cute town today. We ordered lunch, then ordered lunch-dessert (brownie ala mode), then walked down to the dock to sit and loiter some more. We had to hit up Poet's Gear Emporium before leaving town to get a different water treatment system, so we stalled until it opened for the afternoon at 2:00PM. We stopped by the post office to mail some stuff ahead to ourselves, then made our way over to Shaw's and the Gear Emporium. We bought some Aqua Mira for water treatment and our food resupply. We saw Robinhood and said hi to her. She's staying for a zero so probably won't see her until further up trail. There were two shop dogs, a fluffy blue Merle Aussie and a yellow lab mix. Both dogs didn't pay us much attention when we came in and did our shopping. But, when we sat at the picnic table outside to repackage our food, they both came out and played the begging game hard when we opened our bags of pepperoni sticks! All the sudden they wanted to be best friends! But we didn't give any handouts so they stalked away and sulked. Last stop was the general Store again since Shaw's didn't carry big bags of chips, then we set up at the end of town to hitch back to the trail at 3:15PM. There was lots of traffic but they seemed to mostly be weekend warriors from the bigger cities to the south. Eventually someone pulled over, a prior thru-hiker, So Way, and his husky Maya. We were up at the trailhead and walking by 3:45PM. The trail tread isn't quite as rugged on this side so it was chill walking this afternoon. We saw a massive green frog, about the size of a small apple. We dropped down to the East Branch Piscataquis River, which is typically a wet crossing but we were able to keep our shoes on and dry by rock & branch hopping across. Just before 7:00PM, the trail was about to enter a little canyon so we picked a campsite before the terrain got too narrow.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Sausages! - A dog's best friend Mat: Bird scat - somehow Mat got two small bird droppings on his clean shirt!Daily steps: 17,375Elevation gain: 879ft","Monson, ME (Mile 114.5)

Later in the morning, we reached the ford, which we were able to do via a rock hop and keep our feet dry. We stopped on the far side for a snack break. We were observing the river when Mat pointed out what looked to be like a snake head sticking out of the water as it swam, the head moving back and forth slightly. Mat got up to get a closer look but found it was the very tip of a stick poking out of the water. He pulled it out yelling trying to scare me but it didn't work. Crazy that the stick moved only slightly back and forth, mimicking the movement of a swimming snake so well! After break we continued on, now following Bald Mountain Stream. Marble Brook joined in a deep, muddy, boggy mess; we took our shoes off and waded across. It was so deep the water came up to my upper thighs. I was moving slowly and deliberately across until I saw the leech swimming straight at me from the side of the small pool. When I spotted it, I moved quick and jumped out of the pool. How do they know where to locate a person? It was pretty chill walking along Bald Mountain Stream. At one point, we crossed a road where someone had set up a unique white blaze: the blaze itself was a piece of white birch bark stretched and sewn with sinew to a wood stick frame, like a hide being stretched on a wooden frame. It was cute. We reached Bald Mountain Pond and stopped for a late lunch. We sat on a large boulder next to the lakeshore, two loons diving in the waters and calling to each other. They are neat to hear. After lunch, we climbed, reaching the top of Moxie Bald Mountain before 3:00PM. There were nice views and a stiff breeze. We eventually decided to continue, dropping down to Baker's Stream and Joe's Hole Lake, passing some crazy deep rock overhangs along the way. We stopped for a final break at Baker's Creek before climbing up the long ridge of Pleasant Pond Mountain. We climbed until about 7:00PM when we found ourselves a nice stealth site for the night Trailnames of the Day:Mat: Optimistically optimistic - as we walked along the West Branch Piscataquis River, Mat said he was optimistically optimistic that we would be able to cross without getting our feet wet.Kalyn: Pessimistically optimistic - I said I had my doubts about keeping our feet dry but it was possible so Mat said I was Pessimistically optimistic.Daily steps: 37,524Elevation gain: 3645ft","West Branch Piscataquis River, ME (Mile 122.3)

We finished the rest of the climb up Pleasant Pond Mountain. The views were nice but we also stopped because we had cell service here and knew we wouldn't have any cell service down in Caratunk. We solidified our plans with our friends: they won't be up here until 5:00PM so we will go to Sterling Inn to resupply and hang out until they arrive. We also reserved a room for our next resupply. With everything in order, we started down the back side, laughing at how many other hikers were on top calling places, making reservations, and taking care of various business. A steep walk down, past noisy Pleasant Pond (motor boats are apparently allowed on Pleasant Pond), and down to Holly Brook. As we filled up our water, a northbound flip-flopper came up. Her name was Cat Water and she lives in Alaska and is also triple crowning on the AT. We chatted for a while before parting ways. We dropped down towards Caratunk, arriving at Hwy 201 at 2:20PM. We thought about hitching to the Sterling Inn but there wasn't much of a shoulder on the highway and people were driving fast, heading home on a Sunday evening. We decided to just walk the 1.5 miles on Main Street to get to the Inn. We arrived at the inn at 3:00PM. The son opened the resupply room for us. Although the son obviously didn't care for hikers, the resupply options were fantastic and we bought everything we needed for the three days to our next resupply. They also let hikers shower and do laundry, even if they are not guests. We took advantage of this so we won't be too stinky when our friends arrived. Once our friends, Josh and Soleil, did arrive, they whisked us to the community of the Forks. We had drink at Marshalls, the local watering hole, meeting all the locals of the Forks. Being a major white-water rafting destination, most of the citizens of the Forks are rafters, so it was fun to hang out, Josh and Soleil catching up on the latest. Next we went to Hawk's Nest Lodge, a beautiful wood lodge with a restaurant on the ground level, for a tasty dinner. We met more locals there. After 9:00, we headed to Josh and Soleil's friends' property where Josh and Soleil have a camper to stay in while building their place near Caratunk. We were planning to pitch our tent on the lawn next to the river but Adam said we could sleep in the loft above the garage so we got an unexpected mattress and bathroom! Super nice!!

I take that back, we weren't that lazy because we were starting to look into the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and more specifically the Presidential Range (also known as the Presies). There is the White Mountain National Forest, which is straight forward enough. But within the National Forest is the Appalachian Mountain Club, which has it's own rules and regulations (and prices for staying at their campsites and shelters) and within that there is the Randolph Mountain Club that has even more rules and regulations. To stay at one of their shelters above treeline is closing in on $150 per person; that price comes with dinner and breakfast but no shower, electricity, and you're sleeping in a bunk room with 50 other people. Yeah no thanks. Apparently the White Mountain National Forest is one of the most utilized in the country and the Presidential Range has the most severe weather in the lower 48 so I can see why all the rules and regulations are necessary. It's just all a little confusing coming from the west coast where luckily no hiking clubs have monopolized the trails. We're still about 10 days away so we'll get it sorted out.We left around 8:00AM, taking Soleil's car she left us to Berry's General Store to pick up some breakfast sandwiches and coffee before heading up to their property where they spent the cool morning working on their house. They had already erected one wall and we watched them erect the second. They have a sweet piece of property sandwiched between the AT and the Kennebec River, their house is going to be fantastic once it's done! We hung out for a while then decided we should probably get back to walking. Soleil drove us to the Hwy 201 parking lot and we said our goodbyes. It was 11:00AM at this point and we quickly arrived at the Kennebec canoe ferry. Rob, the person ferrying hikers back and forth across the river, gave us a smooth and quick ride. On the south side, we climbed up beside Pierce Pond Stream - a beautiful, clear stream with lots of pools and falls. We stopped at Upper Pierce Pond Stream Falls and jumped into the large, deep pool for a warm swim. It felt great! A quick lunch as we dried and then we continued on. Near Pierce Pond Stream Cascades, we came upon a cooler with cold Gatorades and sodas. A hiker, No Rush, was there so we chatted with him as we enjoyed our cold treat. We continued on, the trail alternating between rugged rocks and roots to flat, soft tread. We made good time to East Carry Pond where we stopped for a break and soaked the feet. As we made our way around the lake we debated whether to camp on this pond or go to the next. We found a nice campsite off trail but another SoBo hiker walking ahead of us heard us talking about the spot and backtracked, asking if the site was good as he walked into it. Oh well, it was only 5:30PM so too early to stop anyway! Luckily the tread between the two ponds was nice and we arrived at West Carry Pond at 6:40PM. Mat found a good spot, then found a better spot not very far after. We started setting up but then I looked up and saw the top half of a tree trunk lodged sideways between two trees. These are referred to on trail as 'Widowmakers' because someone could set up their tent underneath one and get crushed in the middle of the night. This particular trunk looked like it had been there a while but it was big and would cause severe problems if it came down so we threw our stuff back into our packs and went down to the pond for a swim and dinner, planning to backtrack to the first spot Mat saw for camp. The water was warm and we enjoyed a nice swim. We cooked our dinners while air-drying. Mat accidentally kicked over my meal pot before hot water was added. He felt really bad but only half of it spilled and we have plenty of food to get us to town day after tomorrow. We enjoyed a lovely sunset after we finished our dinners, the Loons pitching in their song for dramatic effect. Once the colors faded, we headed back to the first campsite. On the way, we passed a small snake with a nickel-sized frog in it's mouth. We pitched our tent in the gathering dark and proceeded to pass out!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn:Mat: Inked - Mat put Deet on not long before our break at East Carry Pond.

I woke up having to pee just as enough light entered the sky to barely make out the trees. As I fell back asleep, the loons started their morning calls. It was very cool to listen to. But the sleep interruption caused us to sleep in until 8:00AM. We didn't hit the trail until 9:15AM and even then we stopped within a mile to use the privy at West Carry Pond Shelter. No Rush was there so we chatted with him again. He gets up very early to hike but walks about 10 miles per day, trying to go one mile per hour and writing a haiku for each mile. His son, Tent Potato, hangs out in his tent all morning, working on a book he's writing, then hikes fast to the next shelter he and his dad agreed upon the night before. Seems like a good system for them! We bade No Rush goodbye and continued on our way.
Talking about haikus got us coming up with some as we climbed the next few ridges to Flagstaff Lake. Mat first came up with:
A long way to walk
But the trail is so rugged
Crush miles later.

Then I came up with:
The loons are calling
They keep me awake at night
They sound so eerie

Then Mat came up with:
She is so hungry
Her stomach starts rumbling
Time for hot ramen

I corrected his:
She is so hungry
I knocked her food pot over
Time for me to die

We met another flipflopper going south. His name is Bourbon and he's from Arizona. We chatted with him a bit before continuing on our way, dropping quickly to Flagstaff Lake. We passed another one of the many signs throughout Maine warning hikers about Northern Goshawks and how to protect yourself from dive bombs. So we came up with another Haiku:
Northern Goshawk dives,
On the trail's most wanted list
Very ill-tempered 
We found a nice pebble beach and jumped in, swimming to cool off. It's a big lake so the water was a bit cooler. As we were out in the water, we watched a mama Loon with her five loonets dive and swim not too far away. I looked towards Mat and watched the male surface not 20 yards beyond him. They are big birds with huge sharp beaks! I exclaimed out of surprise and Mat whipped around to see the big, pretty loon. He paddled off away from us towards his family. Mat told me of a newspaper report detailing a Bald Eagle that was killed by a Loon, which impaled the eagle through the chest using its beak. I can see how that would happen. We sat on the beach eating lunch, listening to a pair of Merlins calling at each other, before we started walking again. We passed Bourbon again, he heard there was trail magic at the parking lot so we walked fast around the bottom of the lake. Sure enough, there was a large tent awning set up with lots of camp chairs. Sir Stops-A-Lot, Mountain Lifer, and Steve were hosting hikers, cooking up cheeseburgers and hot dogs; serving watermelon, banana, and tangerines; with ice chests full of sodas, gatorade, and PBRs. It was super nice! There were some hikers from previous years, including PR, a Parson Terrier that thru-hiked the AT with his owners two years ago. We sat for a couple hours, chatting with the other hikers. Rain came and went as small but dark thunderclouds rolled over and past. 
Eventually we pulled ourselves away to start the climb up Little Bigelow Mountain. The climb wasn't too bad and we gained the top by 4:45PM. Thunder was rolling from a cloud to the south making its way towards the coast. But Bigelow Mountain itself was shrouded in a thick cloud cap. We were hoping to stealth camp on that ridge but decided not to push for it since it looked foggy and cold up there. Instead, we filled water at a slow spring on the NW ridge of Little Bigelow Mountain and found ourselves a spot just before reaching Stafford Notch. We didn't do many miles today but we enjoyed ourselves and we still only have 10 miles to the road tomorrow. The wind picked up as night gathered, blowing out all the thunder clouds.

We immediately hit the big climb up Bigelow Avery Peak, reaching the top by 8:30AM. As we reached the top, we ran into a Southbounder named Metric, originally from Australia but recently living in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta. Metric took a break on top of Bigelow Avery but we pushed on to West Bigelow Peak for our break. It was sunny on top - glad we didn't push up here yesterday when it was shrouded in a thick cloud cap - but distant clouds blocked supposed views back to Katahdin and the Presidentials in New Hampshire. We chatted with Metric on the downclimb. Before the climb to the Horns, we ran into Trouble and Turtle Fish, both of whom we've seen before but never met. Trouble is a nurse from Homer, Alaska. We were planning to reach the 1:00PM shuttle at Hwy 27 so we booked it up and over the Horns. It was a steep drop down the backside. We reached Hwy 27 at 12:50PM. A gentleman was hanging out in the parking lot and offered us some cold sodas. His trailname was Bourbon Batman and he's the chief of police for Carrabasset Valley. It was fun chatting with him while we waited for the 1:00PM shuttle from Hostel of Maine. John drove up and, after catching up with Bourbon Batman, loaded us up and brought us to the Hostel of Maine, a gorgeous wooden cabin with comfortable rooms and a nice resupply. They had us leave our backpacks, tent, sleeping bags, and clothes not to be laundered outside in a dry locker, had us pick out loaner clothes and let us shower first thing. After that, they showed us around. We gathered our laundry together to be washed, laid out our sleeping bags and tent to try on the outdoor line, and bought a frozen pizza and sodas. With all that taken care of, we did our resupply - they had great options in their little store - and called the local restaurant that had been picked for dinner. Everyone placed and paid for their individual order for pickup by Hostel of Maine and the hosts picked up all the orders at 5:30PM. It was a very comfortable and accommodating place to stay. The hosts, John and Tabitha, are from Tacoma as well so we chatted with them about it. We ate dinner with northbounders Lazerus, Vulcan, Rocket man, and Tracker, all retired guys about to complete their hike. Rocket Man is a retired rocket scientist and Lazerus is an ER doctor. After dinner, everyone picked out and devoured their own personal pint of Ben and Jerry's, something none of us could do if not hiking!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Time table - as 1:00PM drew nearer, my pace became faster to the point Mat had a hard time keeping up with me; motivated to reach that shuttle!Mat: Coco - Mat kept trying to get himself named cool or hardcore trail names.

We slept very comfortably and enjoyed a lovely breakfast of coffee, tea, OJ, hard boiled eggs, homemade bread and banana bread, bagels, and cereal. We really enjoyed our stay at the Hostel of Maine - quiet, clean, and comfortable. John and Tabitha dropped us off at the trailhead at 9:40AM; it was their day off but a hiker needed a shuttle to Bethel so they decided to provide that and take a little road trip to see the surrounding area. We're starting this next section by climbing the mountains of and around Sugarbowl Ski Area. It was a long climb up and the day started out hot, but the clouds gathered into a high overcast to keep us cool and the grade up Crocker Mountain actually wasn't too bad for Maine. At the water source near the top, we ran into Rocket Man and Lazerus, slackpacking from Caribou Pond Road back to Hwy 27 and the Hostel of Maine. We also met a family hiking the AT, parents with four children between the age of 6 or 7 to 12, I think. They called themselves The Nuts, each family member with a nut-themed trailname, switching to The Flipping Nuts when they flipped up to Katahdin from Pennsylvania and hiking back. The kids definitely looked in good spirits, although the parents looked a little tired.
We summited Crocker Mountain with no view, dropped down a bit then summited South Crocker Mountain with no view, then dropped steeply down to the South Branch Carrabassett River. After that, we climbed high up the flanks of Sugarloaf Mountain but turned before breaking the treeline. The trail became more level, winding through pretty forest of tall white pine with dense ferns beneath. More little frogs hopped out of our way; there sure are a lot of frogs and toads in the Maine mountains! We passed the most northbounders today than we've seen yet; all seemed beaten down with the steep climbs and descents. We also passed SoBo Mile 200, putting our total trail mileage at about 700. After a break near Spaulding Mountain Shelter, a little rain sprinkled but did not last. We found a campsite on an abandoned road near Perham Stream. A lightening storm raged on the other side of the mountains from us. We could distantly hear the booms, and as night gathered, the frequent flashes became bright. Luckily the storm didn't cross over to our side, and we felt pretty safe in the low, forested valley. Glad we didn't camp up on the ridge!

I just love putting on a damp t-shirt! We started at 8:00AM this morning with hopes of getting up and over Saddleback Mountain before any thunderstorms develop, which was forecasted to hit the mountain this afternoon. We dropped down to Orbeton Creek, following aptly named Sluice Brook for the last of the descent. Lots of happy frogs and toads this morning. After rock-hopping across Orbeton Creek, we started the long climb up. There was absolutely no air movement today and we were pouring sweat. We both thought we had never sweated so much in our lives but I think the reality was nothing was drying so we felt the most damp we've ever felt. The bandana I use to wipe my face never dried and I eventually used up every corner until the entire thing was too wet to use. We took a morning break at Poplar Ridge shelter before pushing up to Saddleback Junior Peak, then drop down steeply before regaining all that elevation to reach Saddleback Horn Peak. Just before reaching the top, we came upon Jay and Tina from the YouTube channel Jay Wanders Out. We hiked the Arizona Trail at the same time as Jay but never met him. He started the AT in the south back in February so we watched his videos prior to our start. They looked tired but it was nice to meet them! Shortly after parting ways, we reached Saddleback Horn Peak. Thunder clouds were building up over surrounding ridges but above us the clouds still looked pretty thin so we were glad to get through the exposed rocky ridge before any storms developed. There were a few low cloud wisps blowing over the peak and it was quite windy. The weird part was the wind was totally warm! I didn't need to put on a jacket or anything, just warm wind blowing warm clouds across the exposed ridge! Although it was a really pretty area - I would venture to say it was a highlight of the trail - we didn't want to linger for fear of a lightening storm materializing out of nowhere. We descended into the open col then climbed up to Saddleback Peak. We started the descent, planning to take a break just before re-entering the forests. We kind of slowed our pace a bit to enjoy the views and breeze, but then I saw a lightening bolt strike a ridge 15 miles away, close enough to worry about stray lightening strikes, so we picked up our pace again. We eventually reached the tree line so we stopped for a little break. There were delicious blueberries up here growing close to the ground. We watched another dark cloud build up over mountains to the east but the clouds still looked pretty thin above us. We eventually got moving, slipping back into the forests and dropping down the steep rocky trail. We reached ME Route 4 at 4:45PM and walked the 0.2 miles to Hiker Hut, an off-grid hiker hostel with a resupply. Mary was the only one there as Steve was gone and they had no hikers spending the night tonight. She took excellent care of us, cooking us up some egg & cheese sandwiches, which were heaven with our cold gatorades. The hostel had an amazing garden, it seemed very peaceful and Mary was very sweet. We finished our resupply purchases and made it back to the trail in under an hour. We climbed up to South Pond, finding a stealth spot on the east side of the lake. We walked down to the pond. Mat jumped in right away and drew the ire, or curiosity, of the resident beaver. It slapped its tail a couple times but never swam away, it just swam back and forth near Mat. I found it very amusing to watch both my husband and the beaver floating along the surface of the pond, heads barely out of the water, sizing each other up! Mat eventually came back to shore and the beaver came in closer, diving a couple times where Mat had swam. We also spotted a couple Loons on the water so hopefully we'll hear their calls tonight. Back to the tent for dinner. After the skies turned dark, we could hear the beaver walking around in the forest and chewing on wood!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Egg Sammash - I was completely re-energized after her egg & cheese sandwichMat: Beaver - For a moment, Mat and the beaver's swimming movements were exactly the same!Daily steps: 35,333Elevation gain: 5039'","Perham Stream, ME (Mile 205.0)

Then the little red squirrels chattered at us in the early morning, waking us up. We started walking at 8:15AM. The walking wasn't too steep this morning, and there was at least a slight breeze to help us stay drier. We took a lunch break at Sabbath Day Pond, a clear and pretty lake. After that was a steep climb above Long Pond. That's when we started passing northbounders who told us about trail magic at ME Route 17. It didn't take us very long to drop down to the highway, where we walked over the the scenic overlook. Trail angel Slow Stepper and his wife Mary and their little Pomeranian Dolly were hosting hikers. Slow Stepper provided us with soda, Mary's homemade cookies, and fruit while he cooked us up some Red Dogs (all-beef hotdogs in a natural casing that gives it a red color). It was so delicious! And all while overlooking scenic Mooselookmeguntic Lake (that's a mouthful). Approaching 80, Slow Stepper has section-hiked the AT in the past, his wife joining him for 500 of those miles. We eventually pulled ourselves away, thanking them for their generosity. We dropped the rest of the way down to Bemis stream were we sat soaking our feet and legs to cool off and tank up; it's eight miles to the next water source so there is a possibility we may be dry camping tonight. It was a hot and steep climb up to Second Peak Bemis Mountain, a sparsely forested granite outcropping reminiscent of the sierras. The blueberries were abundant and sweet and I couldn't help myself stopping frequently to pick a handful. Super delicious! The trail somewhat leveled out until the climb up Bemis Mountain. The climbs and descents are so steep, they average 100ft per 0.1 mile. Are arms and shoulders are starting to join our legs and knees feeling beat up! A large thunderhead to the northwest was building and rumbling, making us a bit nervous to get up and over the wooded peak. But after 6:00PM, the thunderhead switched to dissipation. We dropped down anyway, wanting to get to the next low point of the ridge for camp. There were multiple tents set up at the flat intersection with Bemis Stream Trail so we continued on. About 0.1-miles before the water source, we found a sloped, lumpy, but empty campsite so we pitched our tent. We had drank quite a bit of our water during the hot climb so I walked the 0.1 down to the water source to get water for dinner. There was a hammock tent strung up next to the water. Back to the tent for a nice dinner. It didn't cool off after sunset, no breeze either. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Water Skipper - Soaking my legs in Bemis Stream, I was talking at Mat when I looked down at my legs and saw three water skippers congregated on my leg!

We started walking at our usual time: 8:00AM. Not long after starting, we wound through an old rockfall, all the large boulders covered in moss and trees. But cool air rose up from behind the rocks, it felt like natural air conditioning! We passed the next water source, which a number of hikers had camped at last night, and climbed up to Old Blue Mountain. The stunted trees on top allowed us to catch some of the breeze that the taller trees below blocked. The top was also neat because we were right at the bottom level of the surrounding clouds. We came across a number of northbound hikers as we descended Old Blue Mountain, more than we've seen in the last two days. Some of them told us about trail magic at the road at the bottom of the descent. Mat laughed as my speed and mood increased. At the bottom, we came across a duel trailmagic setup by 'I Will' and 'Patriot'. I Will hiked the AT in 2019 and was putting on some amazing trail magic: breakfast burritos with eggs, bacon, and cheese; cherries, apples, and bananas; gatorade, juice, soda, and beer. The Patriot calls himself a P Section Hiker - he's only hiked enough of the trail to go pee when he hosts his trail magic. He is a professional trail angel, going up and down the trail hosting hikers every year. He had an awning tent with bug mesh, an industrial mister fan, and even rigged up a mini-freezer in his car so he can pass out popsicles to hikers! It was all amazing. We met Southbounder Eagle Eye there. We arrived just before 11:00 so we enjoy a breakfast burrito, hung out to chat and snack, then enjoyed a delicious cheeseburger before finally pulling ourselves away at 1:30PM. Very wonderful and generous people! Plus, we were fully fed so now we have enough food to get us into town!We had a steep climb up and even steeper descent down over Moody Mountain, stopping for a soaking break at Sawyer Brook, then another steep climb up Hall and Wyman Mountains. The trail was lovely and smooth going down to Surplus Pond. Eagle Eye set up camp there. We chatted with him a bit but we wanted to get a few more miles in during the relatively cooler evening. We found a place to pitch the tent just before we reached East B Hill Road, which we assumed would be packed with camping hikers. As we settled in for the night, a thunder cloud rumbled to the west above us but we didn't see any flashes. However, at 11:00PM we were woken up by lightning, thunder, and rain. We scrambled to secure our stuff before going back to bed. The lightening didn't last very long but I'm still glad we're in a safe location.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Breakfast and Lunch - I got to eat two trail magic meals today!Mat: Follow the Leader - Mat was following behind me, listening to his audiobook.

We packed up and started walking just before 8:00AM. In the warm thin fog, we dropped down to Dunn Cascades, a cool narrow notch in the rock through which the small West Branch Ellis River flows. Next was a long climb up to Baldpate Mountain. Climbing above the fog patches, we finally reached the granite top of Baldpate just before noon. We stopped for a lunch break. There were a lot of blueberries on top but they weren't very sweet for some reason. After lunch we descended a saddle before climbing up West Peak Baldpate Mountain and finally going down towards Hwy 26. We reached the highway at 2:15PM. There wasn't much traffic but we probably waited only half an hour before a mountain biking father-son duo stopped in their Tacoma truck and let us jump in the back seat. They brought us right into Bethel, another cute Maine town. We checked into the Bethel Village Inn, a super cute motor inn run by an older couple, Ruthie and Steve. We have reservations here for a zero tomorrow and it was the perfect room: on the end so we had two windows and on the second story so we could have those windows open. We even had a little outdoor porch overlooking the main street. Ruthie took our dirty clothes to wash. The grocery store was right next door so I grabbed us a few necessities while Mat placed a food order for pick-up. Our friends from Portland, Maine, highly recommend the restaurant Le Mu but it's only open Thursdays through Sundays so it won't be open while we're in town, unfortunately.

Kevin gave us a ride up to the trailhead, regaling us with stories. Although he has lived in Maine for 30 years, he's still proud of what he calls his Irish Masshole Roots. He was fun to talk to, both he and Ruthie were such pleasant and wonderful people! We started the big climb up Old Speck Mountain around 11:15AM. It was overcast and a good 10° cooler than when we got off trail day before yesterday. Rain had just moved through so the rocks and roots were slippery, which does not bode well for Mahoosuc Notch later today. We ran into quite a few northbounders, all in a good mood since they've entered into their last state. We took a break just past the trail junction with Old Speck peak, watching fog clouds roll in and out and rain curtains falling here and there over the forested land. We could also see into New Hampshire but the trail vaguely parallels the state border so we won't get there until tomorrow. Next, we dropped down to Speck pond. A light, low fog covered the surface of the water which was neat. We climbed up to the top of the Mahoosuc Arm and started the notorious descent (a climb for northbounders) of 1200ft over a mile. With the wet rocks and roots, it took us an hour to get to the bottom. I came up with a new slogan for Maine trails:Maine - where hikers cut trail to make switchbacks!Parts of the descent were just 15ft of sloped rock face, super treacherous in wet conditions. At the bottom, we made our way over to ""The Notch"", a narrow slot between Mahoosuc and Fulling Mill Mountains lined with boulders. For a mile, hikers must rock scramble over and under the boulders. It was fun except for the slickness of the rock. It took us about 1hr 40mins to pick our way through the slick boulders and mess around. We definitely were sure to secure our phones because in between the boulders were big, deep holes. We could hear the water flowing below the rocks. Occasionally I would look down into holes with bigger openings and see neat miniature forests of yellow-orange cap mushrooms sprouting from beds of moss. It took us a while but it was a lot of fun. We reached the top of the notch at 6:00PM. There was a loud group of young people ahead of us and they bypassed the camp sites at the top of the notch, probably looking to go the next shelter 1.5 miles ahead, so we pitched our tent here. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Rock Climber - I was using a lot of moves from my rock-climbing days in college to get my 5'2"" frame up and down the boulders!Mat: Spinner - Mat did a smooth move spinning around a tree while descending the Mahoosuc Arm.

Hiking just after 8:00AM, we started our day with a steep climb up Fulling Mill Mountain. As the day went on, going up and down steep grades, we came across quite a few Northbounders, and they were all in a weird mood: boisterous but dishing out unsolicited advice and fear mongering. We'd walk by and say hi and they would just start giving us advice. One older couple saw us and the guy immediately yelled out, ""SOBO ALERT, SOBO ALERT! How's your SoBo hike coming along, southbounders?"" Then proceeded to give unsolicited fear mongering. We thought, ""Is this how the whole northbound bubble is going to be like?"" Then we realized these Northbounders are excited because they just entered their last state. Hopefully it won't continue as we get further away from the Maine border. If it does, I'm going to be adding some patches of my other thru hikes to my pack. 
We reached the New Hampshire border at 1:30PM. There was a couple having a lunch break at the boarder. They started making a big deal for us about finishing our first state and we could tell they were about to impart their wisdom on us when we piped up, ""oh we're flip floppers, this is actually our fourth state."" That nipped it in the bud. We've found that, when people ask which direction we're going, telling them we're flip-floppers, rather than southbounders, prevents the unsolicited advice and fear mongering. Dropping the ""TC Bomb"", or the fact that we're on our Triple Crown hike, also prevents these things but it feels like showing off. We thought of a social experiment we might try: next time a NoBo proceeds with unsolicited fear mongering, we'll just fear monger right back. Should be interesting to see what sort of reaction that produces. It did seem to die down after we crossed into New Hampshire so hopefully it's not something we'll have to deal with for the next month as we pass the northbound bubble.
We walked along, taking short breaks on Mt. Success and on the shores on Upper Gentian Pond. The trail is still very rugged with steep ups and downs so the miles came slowly. After Upper Gentian Pond, we lucked out with some smooth, level trail and was actually able to move some miles! We filled up our water at the next creek so we'd have options of where to camp. We reached Wocket Ledge, which had a sweet stealth spot with a view but, being able to actually see out of the forest, we noticed a large thunderhead coming off of Mt. Washington trailing north. We did not want to camp in such an exposed spot with a lightening storm so we dropped down to Page Pond where we found a sheltered spot to pitch our tent. The thundercloud must have moved in the opposite direction, though, because we only had a sprinkling of rain; never heard any thunder and only saw one or two flashes in the darkness.

It's a town day so we were hiking by 7:20AM. Luckily the trail tread was super nice and we were able to get some miles in. In fact, we reached Hwy 2 by 11:00AM! We caught up with southbounder Mountain Goat. We saw him briefly back at Baldpate Mountain but we took a zero in Bethel so now we caught up with him again. Mat and I set up to hitch on the highway shoulder. Mountain Goat crossed the highway and was shuffling through his gear by the trailhead exit. We told him we'd have him join us if we got a hitch. But Mountain Goat waved down a car leaving the trailhead. It was a family from the Netherlands on a auto tour in the U.S. for about a week. Mountain Goat talked them into giving us a ride into town. I felt bad; the three boys didn't seem to mind but the wife didn't seem too happy to have us three stinky hikers in their rental SUV. But it was only a two mile drive into town so we didn't have to inconvenience them for very long. However, 11:20AM is way too early to check in to the motel so we stopped at Dollar General to eek out a resupply from the picked-over shelves. Next door was the post office, where we had some packages waiting for us. We decided to get some lunch but didn't want to go somewhere local to loiter while stinky. We beelined for the McDonald's to eat lunch and loiter for an hour or so before attempting to check into our motel. After 1:00PM, we walked down to Northern Peaks Motor Inn where we had a reservation. I think we got the last room of the motel, a family suite next door to the office. They let us check in right away so we got into our room, did our pack explosion, showered, and did some sink laundry since the laundromat is a half mile away. We thought we had a package coming to the office of our hotel but realized it was accidentally sent to the hotel in Bethel where we just stayed. Lucky for us, our friends are driving up from Portland, ME, and their route goes right through Bethel so they were able to stop at the Bethel hotel to pick up our package! Adam and Liz arrived at 3:30PM. Adam, trailname Magnum, thru hiked the PCT with Mat in 2004 and the CDT with us in 2006. He also hiked the AT in 2000. We spent all afternoon visiting. They took us to dinner at The Public House Eatery. We eventually let them continue on their way at 7:00PM, they were heading over to the Lincoln Wilderness for some hiking and trail running this weekend. It was really good to see them and we had a great time catching up. After a half an hour at the motel room, we decided we were still hungry so we walked a block away to J's Corner Restaurant for some New England Clam Chowder and dessert. As we were enjoying our dessert, I asked Mat, ""Is this considered second dinner?"" Mat thought for a minute before responding, ""No it's a formal dessert: we came for dessert but ordered a small meal and drinks beforehand - a formal dessert! Makes sense to me!

We walked back to the motel room to relax, I took a short morning nap. Out of our room by the 11:00AM check out time, we walked back towards the post office to mail some stuff home. Mat went back into Dollar General to see if there was any instant coffee. They didn't have any so he bought a can of cold brew mocha to pack out! We walked to the edge of town before we started hitching. Although spread out and packed on a weekend, Gorham has some cool old buildings, many of them getting refurbished, and good restaurants. We set up to hitch and didn't wait very long before a '70s Cadillac pulled over. It was the owner of the hiker hostel in town; he was on his way to pick up some hikers from the trailhead so figured he'd give us a ride down. He was super nice and the Cadillac seats were super plushy! He informed us that New Hampshire recently passed a law allowing ATV on roads in certain towns. Gorham, being one of those towns, has made a name for itself as an ATV destination. He said every weekend over the last three years, Gorham fills up with ATV'ers, making it very difficult for hikers to find a room. He dropped us off at the trailhead, we thanked him for giving us a ride in his cushy Cadillac.We were walking by 11:45AM, following the pretty little Rattle River, more like a clear mountain creek, up towards Mt. Moriah. We eventually broke away from the creek and climbed a steep ascent. Near the top, we met Han SoBo, who happens to be Mountain Goat's brother. At the top of Mt. Moriah we had our first unobstructed view of the presidential traverse ridge. It looks like a pretty area and Mat got excited to walk the ridge day after tomorrow. Dropping down we came across Wet Woody, one the of the Northbounders we met on our southern section and the first we've seen since flipping. We last saw him just before Erwin, TN. He wasn't with Hot Spot or Clown Foot, as they all had different summer commitments with his being the shortest, so they were further south somewhere. He was now hiking with a guy called Spidey, who seemed nice. It was fun to see him, he's almost done! We saw many northbounders today, all of them good interactions. Next was the steep climb up North Carter Peak but nothing we haven't dealt with in western Maine. Upon gaining the top, we enjoyed nice ridge walking along Carter ridge. It's not PCT-style ridge walking with constant views; the AT ducked into the tree frequently. But we keep popping out of the trees frequently, as well, enjoying views of the Presidential Ridge. Mat was very much enjoying the afternoon with the cool air and the frequent ability to see out. Just after 6:00PM, we decided to call it a day and jump on an unoccupied dispersed campsite. stake out one of the dispersed sites since we are contending with many northbounders. Since the Whites are so popular there are quite a few camping restrictions in place so there are less dispersed campsites. In addition, we are competing for these fewer campsites with more hikers since we seem to have reached the northbound bubble. Lastly, tomorrow we will go no more than 16 miles to camp before starting the Presidential Traverse so no need to push tonight. We grabbed the next stealth site within trees greater than 8ft tall that fit our tent.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Cold, sticky hands - Being up on the ridge, the air was definitely cooler but still humid.

A chilly start at 8:00AM, but the weather looked promising! We warmed quickly climbing up to South Carter Peak. A drop down to Zuma Pass before climbing right back up to Mt. Hight. The top of Mt. Hight was clear of trees so we had fantastic views, particularly of the Presidential Traverse across the Peabody River Valley. We enjoyed the views then traversed over to Carter Dome. Just before reaching the forested top, Mat exclaimed and I looked up to glimpse a fisher running down the trail. Funny little critters! 
From Carter Dome it was an extremely steep descent to Carter Notch. Located next to the ponds was Carter Notch Hut, the first of the Appalachian Mountain Club huts for us southbounders. We decided to scope it out. The bathrooms were fantastic, the bunkhouses looked nice too. But for $150 per night, we can't justify spending the money. We filled up our water bottles at the spigot and went down to the pond for lunch. After lunch, a steep climb back up to Wildcat Mountain and a fairly even traverse to Wildcat D Peak. Wildcat D is the top of a ski resort and they use the lifts in the summer to shuttle dayhikers to the top. Being a gorgeous Sunday, it was definitely crowded here! We didn't linger long but instead started the insane descent down to Hwy 16 and Pinkham Notch. The descent was incredibly steep, I think moreso than Mahoosuc Arm, and we were very grateful it hadn't rained recently. It took us a good hour to get down the mountain. We reached Pinkham Notch around 3:15PM. We entered the visitor center to get our resupply packages. The cafeteria did not look manned so we bought a soda and ice cream from the gift shop to eat while we packed up our resupply at a picnic table in the shade. We were hiking again by 4:00PM with plans to go at least five miles to Osgood campground, maybe a little bit beyond. We reached the campground around 6:00PM and decided to start on the climb of Mt. Madison. We found a stealth spot after another 30 mins so pitched our tent. Weather looks pretty good for our traverse tomorrow, we're looking forward to it!

Since no thunderstorms were forecasted, we figured a 5:00AM alarm would be sufficient. But multiple hikers walking by at night and a mouse running around kept waking us up overnight so, when the alarm went off at 5:00AM, it was shut off and we slept an additional 45 minutes! Even with our ""sleeping in"", we got to hiking by 6:45AM, not terrible since there are no thunderstorms to contend with. We reached the top of Mt. Madison within two hours. We were excited to be spending so much time above treeline in a pretty area with such good weather. Mat suggested we should make the most of our time up here and hit all the peaks along the traverse, elongating our time above treeline. Sounds good to me! First was Mt. Adams, the furthest peak from the AT, but the views were fantastic. Going up, a woman recognized my Purple Rain Adventure Skirts; she knew Mandy, the owner of the company. She was very excited to see the skirt in use! On the way down, we passed a thru-hiker. As we passed he asked me, ""PCT or CDT?"" I replied both and asked him how he knew we were western hikers. ""Your shade umbrella! Only western hikers carry those!"" He was nice, on his fourth thru-hike of the AT. We chatted for a bit before continuing on to Mt. Jefferson. From Jefferson we climbed up Mt. Clay. Big fluffy clouds formed but didn't consolidate or stack. From there we could see across the next dip to Mt. Washington and the Visitor Center, a cog rail running up through that dip to the top. We continued on, pushing to get to Mt. Washington before any possible cloud envelopes the top. But the clouds never dropped that low.We reached the top of Mt. Washington at 1:15PM. It was covered in tourists who either drove up the road from the east or rode the cog rail from the west. There was a long line to get a picture in front of the Mt. Washington sign so we bypassed that. But we did find the cafeteria! They weren't selling hot food but Mat bought us some egg salad sandwiches, soda, fresh cookies, and a muffin. After eating our lunch, I wandered down to the museum, which had a $2 entry fee. It was ok but didn't talk as much about weather science as I was hoping. We still had six miles and two more presidential peaks to go so we got going again after an hour at the visitor center. We dropped down to Lakes of the Clouds Hut, a pretty hut near a few tarns. There were a lot of people milling about so we filled our water and moved on, climbing up Mt. Monroe. We dropped back down to the AT and followed the ridgeline south. We climbed one last peak, Mt. Eisenhower, finishing the off-trail presidential peak climbs. A steep drop down to Mizpah Spring Hut and filled our water. While obtaining water, we met another nobo hiker, Mule, who was staying at the hut. We continued an additional half mile to a stealth spot in the forest. It was only 6:00PM but we were wiped out and ready to lay down! I'm glad we got here by 6:00PM because northbound hikers kept walking by; at least six passed us after we had set up camp.

So we decided to get an early start and do as many miles as we can today in hopes of getting over the ridge tomorrow before rain starts. We were walking by 7:15AM and immediately climbed up Mt. Jackson, which had great views over Crawford Notch. It's the last cell service until the end of the day so we made a reservation for a hotel in Lincoln. A Canadian Jay flew right up to me, begging for food. They're cute birds! We met two southbounders at the top, Bird Man and Ninja Turtle. A long 2700ft descent down to Crawford Notch. We met another southbounder, Homeward Bound, or HoBo, as he's from Georgia and walking home. We reached the Saco River and stopped for an early lunch. The river is low and flowing very slowly but it still felt good to wash the grime off our feet and legs. As we sat eating our lunch, a few raindrops started to fall. Mat watched me and said I was his rain canary: if I don't take any action against the rain, then it must not be that bad. The drops lasted only a few minutes so I made no move!After crossing the road, we climbed up a low pass to Ethan Pond. The trail turned into a flat, straight path with minimal roots or rocks for six glorious miles until the climb up to Zealand Falls Hut. It was fantastic to move so quickly and freely! We reached Zealand Falls Hut and stopped for a break and water bottle fill. One of the southbound hikers we saw before Osgood campground was there, we learned his name is Music Man. Eventually we continued on, climbing up Mt. Zealand. Once again a few rain drops fell during our climb but I didn't do anything about it so Mat followed his Rain Canary's lead. The top had a nice view, and a pair of Cedar Waxwings perched close to us, which was cool because they're usually pretty shy birds. After Mt. Zealand, we traversed a number of peaks along a forested ridge. A huge rain cloud snuck up on us fast, overtaking us as we crested over Mt. Guyot. As Mat put it, the Rain Canary went crazy! It was a soaking rain from a big cloud so I put on all my rain gear triggering Mat to reluctantly do the same! The rain passed by the time we reached the top of South Twin Mountain an hour later. The views were fantastic and we could see the large dark cloud moving out west. Luckily it was just a rain cloud and not a thunderstorm! A wet, slow downclimb from South Twin Mountain to reach Galehead Hut where we filled our water bottles. We continued to drop down the rocky trail to the trail junction with Gale River Trail. It was almost 8:00PM at this point and the skies were getting dark. We've passed the most northbounders today than we've seen yet in a single day so we're definitely entering the bulk of the northbound bubble, which means more people camped at the dispersed campsites. This place was no exception, with multiple tents set up around the trail junction. We didn't want to continue in the dark so we piled in to the last spot big enough to fit our two-person tent. Someone hung their food bag right over the clearing. Oh well, they'll just have to wake us up in the morning when they retrieve it. We'll want to get an early start anyway.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Rain CanaryMat:Daily steps: 40,888Elevation gain: 5860'","South of Mizpah Spring Hut, NH (Mile 339.6)

We hit the trail at 6:50AM, eating breakfast while we walked. There was a steep climb up to Mt. Garfield which included another rock scramble but this one had a little creeklet running over it to add extra slickness. Once again, as we made our way towards it, we heard many hikers comment on it, mostly from non-thru-hikers. But we scrambled right up it with no difficulty. At the top of Mt. Garfield, we sat for a break, taking in a nice view of Mt. Lafayette and the Franconia Ridge. So far the cloud cover stayed high with no sign of rain so we pushed on. The descent down Mt. Garfield was slow going but the climb back up Mt. Lafayette wasn't bad! We reached the treeline and was hit by the wind. Winds were forecasted to be blowing 30mph by the afternoon but it wasn't that bad yet! We reached the top of Mt. Lafayette by 10:45AM. Thick low clouds were starting to materialize but they were small and passed quickly. We lucked out as other high ridges in the area were socked in with thick clouds clinging to their top but for some reason, maybe the wind, the clouds just passed by Franconia Ridge. We could see Mt. Washington in the distance but it, too, had a bundle of fluffy clouds atop it's peak. For the next 2.5 miles, the trail followed the top of Franconia Ridge above treeline, providing nice views. The clouds and wind kept us cool as we climbed over Mt. Lincoln and Little Haystack Mountain. The clouds lifted on some of the nearer ridges, revealing the last big mountains of the AT southbound: Mt. Kinsman and Mt. Moosiluake. Those we will do after our town stop in Lincoln, NH. But after those two big mountains, we could see the terrain smooth out; only 30 more miles of White Mountains left! We enjoyed the rest of our ridgewalk, encountering only about a dozen people during the whole ridge. Adam and Liz informed us this hike is very popular and can get extremely crowded on weekends. I think we lucked out by hitting it on a weekday with a poor weather forecast. And we lucked out in that the poor weather never materialized!Upon reaching the trail junction we dropped 2800ft over three miles towards Franconia Notch and Interstate 93. We reached the bottom at 2:45PM but then had to walk 0.7 miles on an access trail to Liberty Springs Trailhead. There we called Mt. Liberty Lodging, where we have a reservation, and they picked us up along with two northbounders, Cloudy and Tyler. Susan and Mike, owners of the lodge, we're extremely friendly. Susan did our laundry for a small fee, providing us with nice cotton loaner clothes, and, after our showers, Mike dropped us off in Lincoln for a small fee. Lincoln is apparently a touristy town with many gimmicky activity centers. If we learned anything from Gatlinburg, TN, it's that the gimmicky tourist towns pretty much only offer terrible food for exorbitant prices. So we went to the McDonald's to eat then hit up Rite Aid to purchase some trail items as well as some microwavable meals for our hotel room since there are no restaurants within waking distance. Mike picked us up and we headed back to our hotel room to relax just as rain started to fall!Daily steps: 25,314Elevation gain: 3684'","Gale River Trail Junction, NH (Mile 360.7)

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656660,Poor weather today up in the high country. It rained all night and was still raining when we woke. The wind was blowing and we could tell by the fast moving clouds that it was even windier up on the ridges. No need to be climbing up and over Mt. Kinsman today so we took a zero. Weather is supposed to be better tomorrow. We spent today relaxing; didn't even need to resupply as we have enough food left over from our last section to get us to Hikers Welcome Hostel.,"

Liberty Lodging, even though we were far away from restaurants. Mike dropped us off at the Liberty Springs Trailhead at 9:20AM and we walked the 0.7 access trail back to the AT. I realized yesterday if we had chosen the Franconia Notch Bike Path as our access trail, we would have ended up at the Flume Gorge Visitor Center which has a little cafeteria! Oh well. We started the climb up Mt. Kinsman, which was mild for the first 1.5 miles but then turned into a rock trail until Lonesome Lake Hut, followed by a steep climb with occasional rock scrambling until we reached the north peak of Kinsman. We pushed on to the south peak of Kinsman before stopping for a late lunch. We could see Franconia Ridge across the Pemigewasset River Valley/Franconia Notch to the east, and to the west we could see the smooth ridges of Vermont. The nice weather brought a lot of day hikers out. Dropping down the backside of south peak Kinsman Mountain was very steep with occasional down-scrambling, which took us a while. We were very glad we didn't have to navigate wet rocks, which would have been the case if we didn't take a zero yesterday. At the bottom we passed by a small bog with a huge field of pitcher plants; we've never seen so many in such a high concentration! The trail traversed along a ridge then climbed forested Wolf Mountain. Descending the long ridge towards NH Route 112 in Kinsman Notch, our camping options looked grim. We definitely didn't want to camp next to the road on a Friday night. The climb up Mt. Moosiluake on the other side looks immediately steep without many options. There was a shelter on the other side but a) it was a mile and a half from the road so we figured there would be a lot of weekend campers there and b) it was still a 2000ft climb up to it. We decided to find a dispersed campsite on the ridge even through it would be stopping earlier than normal for us. We spotted a site and pitched our tent. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn:Mat: Splatter - Lots of mud holes on trailfrom yesterday's rain.

Being a nice Saturday, we passed by 30 or so hikers going up before we reached the road. From the road, we started the climb up Mt. Moosiluake. The trail follows alongside Beaver Brook, which basically is comprised of a series of pretty little waterfalls. I would love to see it in the spring when it's really going off! But, luckily, the trail, although steep, did not consist of any rock scrambling. We reached Beaver Brook Shelter at the top of the steep section and sat over by the stream to get some water and have a snack. After the shelter, the trail mellowed out a bit. We reached the top of Mt. Moosiluake at 11:45AM. There must have been 70 or so people clustered at the summit cairn; we've never seen so many people at a summit in our lives! But the views were very nice: we could see all of Franconia Ridge and all the peaks until Mt. Washington in the distance.The ridgewalk to the south peak was sheltered within a cluster of short trees and super flat! Then came the 3400' descent. Luckily, it too did not require any rock scrambling, in fact it wasn't all too steep and we made it down in good time. At the bottom, even the numerous rocks and roots gave way to nice, level dirt and walking was wonderful! We ran into Music Man, who switched his name to OSHA, and his hiking partner Squid Bait. We hadn't met Squid Bait yet; she's from Colorado and hiked the PCT in '19. We walked with them for a mile or so but then reached NH Route 25 where we split off to go to Hikers Welcome Hostel for our packages and a resupply while they planned to hit up The Greenhouse restaurant in another five miles. We bid them farewell and walked the 0.2 miles along NH Route 25 to the Hostel. We bought some sodas, microwave pizzas, and ice cream sandwiches and obtained our new shoes. We've only walked 400 miles in our current shoes (in the past we've been able to get ~800 miles out of a pair of shoes) but Maine and the White Mountains where so rugged they definitely got torn up and the tread is nearly gone. We like the comfort these Hoka Speadgoat shoes provide; our feet aren't nearly as tired in them as our previous shoes. But they definitely aren't as durable as other shoes we've used, which is frustrating considering how expensive they are. The other day Mat went online and discovered an article discussing other shoes with similar cushioning but with more durable soles so I think he's going to be doing some experimenting this winter. We dropped our torn-up shoes in the large pile of worn out shoes left by other hikers who received new shoes here.At the hostel, we met Tin Man, from Florida. We also saw Square Peg again. We chatted with them for a bit. The hostel is owned by Pack Rat, who hiked the CDT the same year as us. We asked Legion, the caretaker at the moment, if Pack Rat was currently on premises. Unfortunately he wasn't but Legion informed us that Homebrew lives in town as well! We hiked with Homebrew and Simply Seeking in northern Wyoming for a bit. What a small world! With our resupply done and new shoes on our feet, we walked the 0.2 miles back to trail and continued south. The terrain is so much different already than what we've experienced the last 400 miles: less rocks and roots, less boulders and pine trees. We definitely felt the trail looked similar to anything we walked through in the south. We are a little bit torn: we are super excited to be done with Maine and the Whites with rock scrambling and slow, joint-pounding descents. However, it also means we are done with scenic ridge walks and unobstructed views. The rest of the trail will be in forest. But, we reached SoBo Mile 400, which means we've hiked 900 miles; we're getting close to halfway done and the miles should be coming faster now. We easily found a flat, open dispersed spot to pitch our tent and enjoy an AT sunset: red horizon through the trees.Daily steps: 25,893Elevation gain: 5325'","Above Kinsman Notch, NH (Mile 387.7)

The miles are coming easier so we elected to have a lazy morning so we don't get into town too early. We didn't start hiking until after 9:00AM! The trail rolled along with great tread. We ran into Obi Wan, who we haven't seen since the trail magic just before the Bigelows over 200 miles ago. We walked with him for a bit; he's from San Francisco so we chatted about the west coast and all the differences. We also met southbounder Prometheus, originally from New Jersey but now from Maine. We continued to leapfrog Obi Wan and Prometheus throughout the day. We ran into Six Pack, who we met just before the Georgia-North Carolina border during our northbound section. It was good to see him! We also stopped to speak with some older day hikers who just learned about the Appalachian Trail. They were very nice. Talking with the couple, the woman lowered her voice and said, ""You look a lot healthier than other hikers out here."" It made us laugh and we informed her we are nurses so we take good care of ourselves but we're also older and don't have the high metabolism that can cause emaciation in some of the younger hikers who have been out for a long time.We stopped for a lunch break and to soak our feet at Brackett Brook. Although it was very hot, all we had for lunch was ramen. I don't mind eating raw ramen so I decided to eat mine that way to prevent having to eat a hot soup on a hot day. But Mat can't eat it raw so he made his into a soup! At least we had the creek to keep cool! The climb up Cube Mountain was steep but didn't require rock scrambling and had nice views at the summit. The rocks at the top consisted of glacier-polished granite slightly different looking than the younger Sierra Mountains of the west coast, which was cool to see. We dropped down to Jacob Brook, stopping at the Eastman Ledges to look out over the forested hills. The trees are thinking about turning; tips of branches are hinting towards yellow and an occasional orange or even red can be spotted with close inspection. I'm looking forward to see the fall colors.At Jacob Brook, we loaded up on water to get through the 10-mile dry stretch plus a dry camp. Luckily the air cooled and the climb up Smarts Mountain was gradual. We reached the fire tower at the top before sunset but there was probably 20 hikers milling about so we just continued on. I think we're definitely in the northbound bubble; we must have passed 40 or so hikers going north today! We dropped down the backside until we found a nice, flat spot to pitch the tent. It's definitely getting darker as Mat had to use his headlamp to cook his dinner after I ate mine.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Seesaw - walking on the wood beams across a mud pit, one of them was loose and when Mat stepped on it behind me, it shot me up on the other end.

Morn - Overcast and breezy, 62°FMid - Overcast and breezy, 72°FEve -

A Fisher Cat romped around our tent a few times last night, hunting and occasionally calling out. We got to walking just after 8:00AM; OSHA, Squid Bait, and Prometheus already past by this morning. We dropped down to the Grafton Turnpike before climbing up to Holts Ledges. The eastern edge is a cliff so we had nice views from the top. We ran into OSHA and Squid Bait talking to two northbounders who we recognized from the Boots Off Hostel in Tennessee. We found ourselves a nice place to take a break with internet. Today is a Durston Tent Drop day and we want to try to get one. Our current tent is too short and doesn't keep us dry in heavy rain. We are anticipating more rain as we move toward fall so we want to sell this one and try something different. After spending at least 40 minutes trying to get onto the website, we were successful. We're excited to try the X-Mid Pro 2 in a few weeks! We dropped the rest of the way down to Goose Pond Road. There we met Chuck, an older gentleman (probably in his late 70s or early 80s), who lives a few miles away and is trying to support a water cache at the road crossing. He was very knowledgeable about the trail and has section-hiked all of New Hampshire and Maine. He was fun to talk to.
At 1:00PM, Daryl from Dowd's Country Inn came by and picked us up. We got in and luckily our room was ready. The Inn is an amazing huge house built in 1793! All of the rooms were converted into private bedrooms with their own bathroom, creating a 20-bed BnB. Our room was once the library converted into a nice bedroom with private bath. The barn was converted into a banquet hall and a tavern was also attached, although the tavern is currently closed due to lack of staff. Additionally, being a Monday, all other restaurants in town were closed. So we walked to the country store next door and bought some fresh-made sandwiches, veggies, and soda. Back in the hotel, we showered and they did our laundry for us. We finally have access to a bathtub so Mat blew up and submerged his sleeping pad to try to find the airleak. He has to inflate his sleeping pad twice every night now. With the pad submerged under water, he found six leaks! They were in a row so something must have snagged the pad and caused these little holes? In any case, he patched all six leaks with temp patch kits. Hopefully that will do the trick for now. 
We relaxed until 6:00PM when we wandered down to the store to pick out what we could for dinner, which we quickly ate in the outdoor dining area of our Inn before going back to the store to purchase soft-served ice cream from their machine. Eating our ice cream, we walked around the open park in the middle of town, lined with historical, classic Colonial-style houses, most with carriage houses converted to garages. The large church at one end has a church bell that was cast by Paul Revere! The town of Lyme itself was incorporated in 1761, a decade before the Revolutionary War! So cool! Raindrops started to fall as we made our way back to the Inn.

I got French Toast and Mat got the omelette; breakfast included a huge glass of juice plus coffee or tea. Super nice! Daryl drove us back to Goose Pond Road trailhead. There was a small group of northbound hikers and we recognized Mike as one of them. We hadn't seen him since just before Erwin, TN! We caught up and wished him luck before we heading south at 10:15PM. The trail here consists of beautiful open deciduous forests, periodically laced with hand-stacked rock walls that are a few hundred years old. A hiker interested in history we met at Hostel of Maine told us about them. I don't remember exactly what he said but I remember him saying that the rock walls are the remains of sheep fields when the price of wool skyrocketed. We pushed hard to get into Hanover before too late and reached the Co-Op at the edge of town at 3:30PM. We went inside to buy a resupply. We were overwhelmed by the variety of food! When on trail, we tend to eat the same thing over and over again: instant ramen, instant potatoes, Mac and cheese, brand named bars and snacks. At the coop, we had access to local breads and pastries, off-brand bars and snacks, they even had a sushi chef making sushi packages. We were giddy looking at all the variety of tasty foods! We definitely bought a sushi pack and some soda to eat outside while we repackaged our food. Prometheus was there and we chatted with him while we repackaged our food. With our resupply done, we continued walking through town, passing by different Dartmouth College buildings. There were some local restaurants offering cheap or free appetizers to hikers but, being in a college town with plenty of ethnic food, we decided to forego the typical pizza joints and pubs and ordered food from Tuk Tuk Thai (it was hard to choose between Thai, Indian, or Samosas). We grabbed our take out and sat on a bench at the Dartmouth College Green. It was SUPER delicious; hard to get food like this on other trails!We finished eating and got to walking again at 6:00PM, the clock chime pinging out some sort of song for a good three minutes as we packed up and moved on. Rain started to fall as we dropped down to the Connecticut River bridge, at which point we walked into Vermont! On the far end, we walked through the little hamlet of Norwich, VT, incorporated in 1761. Once again, cool Colonial-style buildings lined the street. But the trail cuts off from the main road before entering the town proper so we hiked back out into the woods. We did a few miles to make up for some lost time spent in Hanover. Eventually we found a flat spot to pitch the tent. The clouds were thick and dark but rain never fell. We fell asleep to the sound of hundreds of crickets.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Legit Breakfast Mat: Pad ThaiDaily steps: 38,692Elevation gain: 3691","Lyme, NH via Goose Pond Road (Mile 428.2)

Guess I was tired from not sleeping well the last two days. We got to hiking around 8:20AM, the skies threatening rain but it never materialized. We saw lots of the orange juvenile Eastern Newts today, though; haven't seen those since the south! We also saw our first millipede since the south but only saw one of those today. We dropped into the small hamlet of West Hartford, nothing there except the public library. But the residents were nice! As we walked into town, we passed by an older gentleman reading the newspaper on his porch. His house was beautiful and also the old school house, built in the early 1800s. We chatted with him a bit before continuing on. In town, Randy called out from his porch offering us cold sodas or hot coffee, our choice! He also had an 11-week old puppy named Max and a very friendly, social orange and white cat named Millie. We sat on Randy's porch enjoying cold sodas and getting some pet love. Five northbounders showed up and joined in. Eventually we pulled ourselves away from adorable animals and continued on, stopping for lunch at the top of the climb. Lots of ups and downs today but the tread was really nice. Lots of water accessibility was an additional bonus. We passed by about 35 or so northbound hikers, still sounds like a lot but it's less than we've passed the last number of days. We rolled along, stopping for an afternoon break at Pomfret Brook and soaking our feet. The rest of the evening was peaceful, passing many roads with little farms on them. We climbed up Pinnacle Mountain as the sun set. We still have some miles until our reservation at the Inn at Long Trail tomorrow so we decided to do some night hiking so shave off a few miles in the cool evening. We finally stopped at the notch prior to climbing up The Lookout, pitching our tent on a flat area. Good thing we did because not 20 minutes after setting up, rain began to fall! Luckily no thunderstorms, but it rained pretty heavily and we fell asleep before it stopped.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Pet TimeMat: Fig Bar: Mat realized today that he hiked out of Hanover with five different fig bars of different brands and flavors!Daily steps: 50,302Elevation gain: 5928'","Mosely Hill, VT (Mile 445.8)

We woke early with the goal of getting to the Inn 17 miles away by a descent time. We were walking by 6:50AM, the sun shining through clear skies. More rolling ups and downs today. We walked by Thundering Falls, one of the taller waterfalls in Vermont. We reached the Shelburne Pass Trail Junction and split off from the AT to walk the 0.5 miles down to The Inn at Long Trail. The inn is a cool, three-story building with an authentic Irish pub on the ground level. We arrived at 2:40PM, checked into our room, and started laundry right away. With both us and our clothes clean, we went down to the pub for first-dinner. Mat ordered a bowl of Guinness stew, served with a slice of delicious Irish Soda Bread and a slice of regular bread, and a local Amber Ale while I ordered Corned Beef Hash (can't pass up an opportunity for a breakfast meal!) with a bottle of Magners Irish Cider. Super delicious and refreshing! The bar was neat, too, all wood with giant granite boulders incorporated into the design. We went back to our room to relax and get some chores done before going back down to the bar at 8:00PM for a last meal before bed. This time we each had a bowl Guinness Beef Stew and I ordered a pint of Guinness on draft!

A nice, full breakfast is included with our stay so we went downstairs to the breakfast restaurant. The whole back wall consisted of windows to view a small green garden punctuated by bright pinks flowers, enclosed by more giant granite boulders. It was very pretty and fun to watch the little red squirrels hop around the boulders while we ate breakfast. Mat ordered the omelette with sausage, juice, and coffee while I ordered french toast with bacon, juice and tea. After breakfast, we returned to our room to pack up. We left our room and stashed our packs in the shed, borrowed shopping bags from the front desk, and caught the 10:20AM bus into Rutland to do our resupply. Rutland has a cool little downtown of old brick buildings, definitely different than west coast towns. A Walmart is a few blocks from the transit center so we did our resupply there. Mat found a new product to try: French Pancakes To-go; prepackaged, premade pancakes. Should be interesting to try. A violent lightning storm rolled in while we shopped; we could hear the thunder crashing from inside the building! We checked out and stepped out to torrential downpour and visible flashes of lightning. We hurried back to the bus stop to catch the 12:15PM bus back to the Inn.
We repackaged our resupply in the front lounge, watching the rain come down. With that done, we decided to stall a little longer and get lunch from the bar. Mat ordered a bowl of Guinness Beef Stew for the third time in a row! (I think he just really likes the bread). With lunch eaten and the rain still pouring, we sat out in the common area. At 2:00PM, the rain finally stopped so we jumped at the opportunity. We had an easy climb up Pico Peak. Here the Appalachian Trail joins the Long Trail, a north-south trail that follows the length of Vermont, so we'll be seeing some Long Trail Hikers as well as AT hikers out here. As we walked through a ski run, a couple Monarch Butterflies perched on some flowers at eye level right next to the trail. I hadn't realized their bodies where so spotted, white polkadots on a black body. At the top of Pico Peak, the trail contours the ridge for a while, cresting near Killington Peak above 4000ft. Another lightning storm is forecasted to roll in this afternoon but, lucky for us, it kept getting pushed back. We decided to bypass the 0.2-mile side-trail to the top of Killington Peak so that we could drop down to lower elevations before the next lightning storm arrives. Rumbles began as we started our descent down the south side of the mountain. We were able to get down pretty far and find a small flat spot to pitch our tent before the rain started. By 8:00PM, lightning was flashing and thunder was constantly rumbling but it was pretty high above us and we felt safe. In fact, I fell asleep as the storm raged!

We woke during a little break and waited for the last rain shower to pass before packing up and walking by 7:45AM. We hit the 500-mile mark early in the day, which puts us at 1000 miles of the AT completed! Only 100 more miles and we'll be halfway done! Of course, the second half will go by much faster than the first half as the most difficult sections of trail are the first 500 miles and the last 500 miles, both of which we have now completed. The clouds dispersed and we had a little bit of pretty morning fog in the forest. The walking was nice, good tread and mellow grade. The ground cover in this particular area consisted of a carpet of Club Moss, a single tendril of green growing up to 3-5 inches tall. They look spiky but they're actually quite soft. We've seen them occasionally before now but we've never seen such a dense carpet of them until now.We took our first break at the Clarendon overlook, positioned above the mouth of the small Clarendon gorge. We dropped down to the road then crossed a cool pedestrian suspension bridge over the pretty but short rock cleft. After that, we climbed up and over a progression of hills. As the clouds cleared out, we saw lots of day hikers and even a number of Long Trail Hikers but not too many AT hikers. In fact, one of the AT hikers we passed said they hadn't seen southbounders for a while so maybe we're getting into a little pocket. We took our second break at Bully Creek where we soaked our feet before climbing up White Rocks Mountain. The upper slopes where covered in a pretty spruce forest with (surprise!) white rocks. At one intersection, rocks were stacked into cairnes or arranged into shapes. We dropped down and passed Little Rock Pond; lots of weekend campers there. We found ourselves a big flat spot to pitch the tent near Big Black Branch Creek, letting the tent dry out a bit before setting up inside. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn:Mat: Attempted Food Coach - Mat made a comment about one of the food items I was devouring.

More rolling forest walking today but we saw a lot of cool, unique mushrooms! A cluster of white ones with split caps looked like five-petal flowers, tiny black ones in tight clusters looked exactly like deer scat, larger brown ones tightly clustered together giving it a weird appearance, thin papery ones, and even a regular looking mushroom that was completely plum purple!We're encountering less thru-hikers now, we passed maybe 10 today? Definitely passing a lot more Long Trail Hikers than Appalachian Trail Hikers. We reached Griffith Pond hoping to take a break along the shore but there wasn't any good water access so we continued on to the Peru Peak shelter. There we soaked our feet in the cold creek and watered up for the 10-mile dry section over Styles and Bromley Mountains. Styles Peak had a tiny rock slab at the top that allowed a small view but eight or so people were clustered on that small rock slab so we continued to Bromley Mountain, which, being the top of Bromley ski resort, was completely open. We stopped for a break on a rock in the breeze. After our break we dropped down from Bromley Mountain, intersecting VT Route 11 at the bottom. At this road, hikers can hitch into Manchester, VT. Back in Rutland, we decided to skip Manchester and hit up Bennington 40 trail-miles beyond. It's kind of disruptive having so many towns so frequently, especially when one must hitch into and out of town. So we opted to carry the food weight of 3+ days and hike straight through to Bennington. After crossing busy Route 11 we climbed up to Prospect Rock. The viewpoint from the rock was nice and we could see down to Manchester nestled in the forested valley below. It looks like a cute town. We hiked to the next water source and filled up before finding a flat dispersed campsite on an abandoned road. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Unprofessional Instagramer - Mat was trying to get a nice shot of me as we left the top of Bromley Mountain. I didn't realize it so I was reorganizing my snack situation as I walked, occasionally dropping something I would have to pick up. Mat laughed at me and I then realized what he was attempting. He told me, ""You are not a professional Instagramer with all that garbage hanging out of your pockets and dropping stuff!"" It made me laugh.Mat: Crossing the line - Bromley Mountain is apparently a popular hike and occasionally rope would be strung along trees to keep hikers corralled onto the trail.

At the top, there was an open fire tower. We dropped our packs and climbed the fire tower. It was nice to look out above the trees but the humidity haze prevented us from seeing to far in any direction. We sat up there anyway, enjoying the stronger wind that was blowing above the trees. Apparently was the mountain James P. Taylor was on when he conceived of the idea for the Long Trail across Vermont. Benton MacKaye, while building a section of the Long Trail here, came up with the idea of the Appalachian Trail. 
We decided to drop down to a viewpoint for lunch. When we arrived to the ""viewpoint"", we found a rock bench facing a divot in the trees; absolutely no view, especially when sitting down! Oh well. We ate our lunch and continued our way down. We had our second break at Black Brook, soaking our feet. A cool-looking butterfly landed near my pack, we looked it up and found it was a White Admiral Butterfly. Next was a long climb up Glastonbury Mountain. We ended up setting up camp as the sun set about a half-mile from the fire tower. We saw a number of northbound hikers but we think they were all Long Trail Hikers, I don't believe we saw any Appalachian Trail Hikers today; maybe we've made it through the NoBo bubble?

Despite camping on a ridge with a breeze, we woke to everything very damp. No drying out on this trail! We were walking by 7:45AM, immediately hitting up the Glastonbury fire tower. We were surprised to find no one camped up there. Maybe we really are through the northbound bubble. Once again we dropped our packs and climbed the tower. Mat climbed halfway up to a platform looking west and declared there was no view right now due to the clouds and so the climb was not worth the time and effort. I went up a staircase higher to a platform looking east and the view was beautiful! Mat laughed at himself for declaring no view while only looking into the incoming clouds, totally missing the pretty view behind him! Encouraged, we climbed all the way to the top. We could see far out to the east, a coastal fog settled in the very lowest points, while clouds coming from the west flew over the ridge along the tree tops and past the fire tower, causing us to play peekaboo with the peaks to the north and south. The sun was behind a high cloud so the rays casted a pretty light on the land. Definitely one of the most scenic views on the AT, mostly caused by the dramatic lighting and cloud play. We dropped down 0.2 miles to the shelter and found half a dozen people camped there but they all looked like Long Trail hikers. 
Good trail down to VT Route 9, allowing us to reach the parking lot by 12:15PM. The owner of Catamount Hotel picked us up at 12:30PM and brought us to the hotel. I asked what Catamount meant since I saw the same name on some other buildings in town. He informed us that Catamount is local slang for Mountain Lion: Cat of the Mountain, or Catamount. Interesting! We did some errands and got our clothes washed. Mat also got his new sleeping pad since his is finally died after five years and thousands of miles. Just as we were about to walk the half mile to downtown for some dinner, a huge thunderstorm erupted. Not a whole lot of thunder but a torrent of rain fell. We watched from our hotel door as the road in front turned into a river despite being on a hill. Cars driving up or down made a full-on casing of water around the whole front half of the vehicle as they drove. We decided to order delivery for dinner. The thunderstorm eventually stopped, but a more steady rain restarted at night. I love being in town at times like this!

Most hikers waited until check out time of 11:00AM so we were all sitting around waiting for a ride back to the trail. We met Little Calf-Man, Grunts, Smoked, and Fat Chill. We rode up with Smoked and Fat Chill as there wasn't enough room for Little Calf-Man and Grunts so they volunteered to wait for the next shuttle. Hiking by 11:45AM, the climb out of Woodford Hollow was steep but after 1.8 miles the trail leveled off and the rest of the climb up to Harmon Hill was nice. At the top of Harmon Hill we took a little side trail through a patch of tall fern to an open area with a nice rock to sit on and a view of Bennington below. We ate our lunch there, reveling in the cool wind full on blowing. We actually got a little chilled! And we actually dried from the steep climb up as well! After lunch we continued on. With the cool temps and super nice trail, we made better time than we anticipated. Little Calf-Man and Grunts caught up to us and we leapfrogged with them for a bit, super nice people. We noted they used a data sheet instead of the navigation app. They are the second group of young people we've seen use old-school navigation tools rather than a phone app. Good skill to learn! We reached the Massachusetts/Vermont Border at 6:00PM, Little Calf-Man and Grunts already there to welcome us! We took pics and bid goodbye to the two, they are going further than us tonight. Soon the trail drops steeply down to Williamstown; any dispersed camping must be found within the next mile or so. We found a large, flat spot 0.2 miles beyond the state border and decided it was good enough even though there was still an hour of daylight left. Only four miles into Williamstown tomorrow.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Mountain Rat - I told Fat Chill my trail name and she launched into a story of hiking with someone who called Pikas 'Mountain Rats'.

Rained came in overnight, waking us enough to close the tent fly before falling back asleep. The rain was done when we woke up but the clouds were dark enough to make us wary. With our rain gear accessable, we set out for town. We've noticed an immediate change in the terrain from Vermont, which surprised us. The ground is rockier, which provides better drainage and less mud. The thick underbrush of Vermont is gone and the trees and ground cover are much more open, probably due to the rockier ground. Even the pine trees look different. The steep descent into the Hoosic River valley turned out to be really not that steep and we arrived in Williamstown around 9:30AM. We turned off trail and walked 0.2 miles to a cafe called The Break Room. The coffee and tea was amazing; the food was fantastic, too! Some of the menu items looked expensive for not very much food, but we picked items that provided a lot of food for a good price. While eating our breakfast, we tried to make reservations at a hotel in Great Barrington. Unfortunately, we will arrive on Sunday of Labor Day Weekend and all the hotels were booked up or $250 per night. Not worth it, I guess we'll hitch in and get a resupply then head back out, postponing a shower and laundry until the next town stop after the holiday weekend.
After cleaning our plates, we bought some delicious looking pastries to go. After walking the 0.2 miles back to the trail, we started the long climb up to Mt. Greylock, which, with the strong cold wind, was actually not a bad climb since the wind kept us mostly cool and dry. On the way up, we passed by Southbounder Mile 600, which means 1100 miles of AT for us: halfway! At least mileage-wise, the second half of the trail should go by a lot faster than the first! At the top, we enjoyed the views and our lunch of pastries. I did a quick jaunt up to the top of the War Veterans Memorial tower, then we dropped down to Bascom Lodge, which looked like a mini Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood. After filling our water bottles at the provided hose at the lodge, we embarked on the long but nice descent down to the town of Cheshire. Once we reached town, we walked 0.2 miles to Dollar General to buy a resupply. We walked another 0.1 miles to a Dunkin Donuts within a gas station in hopes of finding something to eat for dinner. Unfortunately, their grill was down so they only had donuts. Luckily the gas station sold hot pockets and had a microwave so we ate a dinner of hot pockets and soda before walking the 0.3 miles back to the trail. Here the trail goes right through the middle of a corn field, which was neat! We arrived at Father Tom Campground, a neat grassy camping area for AT hikers with everything a hiker needs: potable water, charging station, picnic tables, lawn chairs, clean porta potties, hand sanitizer, a hiker box, and even two bikes to borrow to get around town! Very impressive! But it was still fairly early so we continued on after filling our water. We climbed up from town, reaching the Cheshire Coble Viewpoint just in time to catch the sunset. From there we continued on along the ridge to find a stealth spot to camp.

Although still fairly cool, the wind had completely stopped overnight and the temps were slightly warmer than yesterday. We reached the road into Dalton around 10:00AM and made our way through the pretty neighborhood. Almost all the houses were two stories with big porches, surrounded by large grassy yards and no fences. When we reached the correct street, we cut off trail to walk 0.2 miles to Dalton Diner. They had an extensive breakfast menu at excellent prices. Steak and eggs was under $15 so we each ordered a plate. Stuffed with another delicious breakfast, we walked the 0.2 mile back to the trail and made our way to the other end of town. The trail goes right in front of Sweet Pea Ice Cream Parlor but it doesn't open until 2:00PM; oh well. We climbed up from Dalton, making short business of the six miles of winding trail to Warner Hill. This hill had an open granite top with a view of Mt. Greylock rising above the surrounding hills so we sat in the shade for a break. Today felt even more like fall than yesterday: with a cooler breeze than normal, drier air, lots of dried leaves already scattered around the ground. I love the smell of dead leaves. We didn't break for long as a large group of high school or early college kids arrived. We continued on, quickly coming to Washington Mountain Road where a sign for Cookie Lady was posted. This family lives 0.2 off trail and offer cookies for AT hikers. We walked down to the farm but, unfortunately, a sign was posted in the driveway that they were closed for the season, which makes sense as we're seeing less than a handful of hikers each day. Disappointed, we continued on. We stopped slightly early, not wanting to get stuck on a narrow ridge or too close to interstate 90 for camp. For some reason, camping outside of designated campgrounds/shelters is not allowed in Massachusetts, so we find stealth campsites 200 yards from the trail. Hikers out here have a bizarre habit of calling any campsite that is not apart of a campground/shelter as 'Stealth Camping' instead of Dispersed Camping (even when that area to pitch a tent is right next to the trail and so is in no way stealth). But we've been pitching our tent in true stealth style where we can't be seen from the trail.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Steak N EggsMat: Cookie Disappointment Daily steps: 43,718Elevation gain: 3156'","The Cobles, MA (Mile 613.9)

We woke sometime after 4:00AM for some reason - I think a bird? Instead of falling back asleep, and therefore sleeping in, we rested for a bit then got a fairly early start to our day, hiking just after 7:00AM. Within four miles, the trail crossed Interstate 90, which starts/ends in Seattle near our home; we crossed it in Snoqualmie, WA, on the PCT and near Anaconda, MT, on the CDT.From the interstate, there was a short climb before dropping down to Higley Pond. It was only 10:00AM but we stopped for a break anyway because the water was too nice to pass up; the water wasn't very cold so I waded in to do my bird bath while Mat jumped in all the way. After our dips we sat on the edge drying and eating some food. A rather large shoal of minnows was hanging out in the shallows so Mat threw small chunks of tortilla to them. They ate in a frenzy, attracting some slightly larger Blue Gills and another fish Mat didn't recognize. We fed the fish for our entertainment. Eventually the bigger fish filled up and stopped going for the food.
We continued on, climbing up and over Baldy Mountain. Near the top, we had a close encounter with a Barred Owl. Recently we've been hearing their distinctive calls almost every night, 'Who cooks for you? Who cooks for youuuu?' But this one perched in a tree just 10 meters away, giving us a good look-over with it's ink-black eyes before taking off again, huge and silent through the forest branches. Very cool! Dropping down to the Hop Brook Valley on the other side, we entered a magical wetland. Wildflowers we have not yet seen were still in bloom despite it being September, tall cattails reached high above the flowers, the air abuzz with dragonflies and Swallows. The boardwalk was a little narrow and wobbly. We came upon a very dry but very large bear scat on the boardwalk. I sure wouldn't want to meet that bear on this boardwalk! It's way too narrow and I'm surprised the wobbly wood handled such a large bear's weight!
After the wetland the trail climbed up, crossing Jerusalem Road where a pretty, New England style house had The AT Stand set up: a little shed on the road with an antique refrigerator, trash bin, and electrical outlet inside. The fridge held sodas and ice cream sandwiches! We plugged in our battery bricks to charge and enjoyed cold sodas and ice cream sandwiches at the adjacent picnic table under a giant oak tree. A pigeon hung out with us. Mat recognized it as a Blue Bar Homing Pigeon with a little band on it's leg. It was very friendly, hanging out with us. We offered it food but it wasn't interested, but it did take a drink of water we poured into a peanut butter jar cap that we were throwing away. We paid for our snacks via Venmo then continued on, climbing into picturesque Tyringham Coble Park, a nice little trail park in open forests with nice benches at the viewpoints. The trail dropped back down to Tyringham Valley one more time before climbing up to Sky Hill. The climb was very nice: switchbacking trail through fern ground cover; shaded by lovely, tall, open trees. 
On top of the climb, lovely trail continued, mostly level with pine duff. The forests became more dry; we noted Mountain Laurel for the first time since the south. We passed by South Mount Wilcox Shelter, hearing a large group of young men out for the weekend before we saw them. We reached The Ledges as the sun dropped behind some low clouds, lightning up the clouds in a cream color contrasting with the baby blue of the sky. We dropped down to Benedict Pond as muted sunset colors developed. We took pictures and grabbed some water before continuing on to find a stealth site prior to Blue Hill Road. After dark, we could hear the booms, but not see the lights, of a professional fireworks show somewhere nearby. Never heard of fireworks for Labor Day Weekend.

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: AT tread - While hiking, I came upon a split in the trail, one going straight up a rock incline and the other consisting of tread going more straight and around a large tree. I was confused because the tread route looked really developed but the trail obviously goes up the granite rock so I went up the rock, thinking the tread went to a campsite or something. When I gained the rock, we started laughing because the tread was actually a switchback. I guess I've been on the AT too long if I get confused by a switchback!Mat: Homing Pigeon - Mat told me all about his years of owning homing pigeons when he was a kid.

Whoever was partying nearby did so until 1:00AM. But we still woke early to make the most out of the amount of daylight hours we have. We were hiking by 7:45AM. Looking at the map, we realized we could hitch directly into the northern part of Great Barrington via MA Route 23 only a few miles away, allowing us to get into the part of town we needed, rather than hiking to US Route 7 and having to get a ride to the very far side of town. We reached MA Route 23 and stuck out our thumbs. The first car stopped, a young couple with their infant out camping for the weekend. She was a nurse practitioner so it was fun talking with them. They drove us the four miles to Travelodge Inn where we had sent a package. We retrieved our package, double checking to see if any rooms were available but they were still completely booked. So we wandered across the street to Rio Cafe for a super delicious breakfast. After breakfast we walked over to the grocery store for resupply, then I called my brother and his family to wish my niece a happy belated birthday. I wanted to video chat with her while on trail so she can see what it's like but the cell reception was always too poor. So we chatted while I sat outside of a McDonald's! Mat got ahold of a person in Salisbury, CT, 30 trail-miles ahead, who rents rooms to AT hikers so at least we'll get a shower and maybe even some laundry tomorrow, which will be nice since we haven't had either since Vermont.
With all chores done, we walked to where MA Route 23 left town and set up to hitch. Once again we got a ride quickly. Say what you will about ""Massholes"" but everyone in Massachusetts has been super friendly, from day hikers to people picking us up to people leaving jugs of water and snacks at trailheads; I've been super impressed by the amount of love Massachusetts people give the AT! Back on trail at about noon, we climbed up to Ice Gulch, a bizarre cleft in the granite about 25' wide and 30' deep, which was pretty cool looking. While contouring along the top of the ridge, we came upon a huge hornet's nest about the size of a volleyball built right on trail. I almost stepped on it! But I stretched out further to step over it. I was bitten on the back of my leg but never stung, Mat got stung on the back of his leg. He jumped, dropping his phone and water bottle so he had to stop and stoop to pick them up; luckily he didn't get stung more!
Around the corner, we reached East Mountain Ledges, a granite outcropping above a cliff with open views to the Housatonic River Valley below. We stopped for a break before continuing on. Thunderclouds were building up and the humidity was through the roof! We dropped down into the valley, crossing the Housatonic River on a bridge before turning north and following it for a bit. We met a guy there in a sprinter van; he was waiting for his wife who was section hiking the AT. He offered us some water, which we gladly accepted. All the springs and creeks are dry, the only water sources being beaver ponds, agricultural runoff, or the chemically polluted Housatonic. I believe it has been 15 miles since the last flowing creek that isn't from a cow pasture and another four miles before we reach the next good source. But the friendly people of Massachusetts leave water at all the trailheads!
Crossing through the field on the western side of the valley, we came upon a monument for the final battle of Shay's Rebellion, which occurred in that field. Shay's Rebellion occurred after the Revolutionary War; farmers who left their farms to take up arms against the British fell behind in their earnings. Taxes were increased after the war to pay for it. Veterans promised pay for their service were either not paid or given worthless currency so the farmers turned to loans to pay their taxes. Unable to pay back the loans, farmers were taken to court and thrown into jail. Massachusetts state courts were favoring the lenders so Shay started a rebellion with the demand for central government regulation to prevent favoritism state court rulings. The rebellion was ultimately squashed but it played a prominent role in development of the constitutional convention. Prior to the rebellion, there was a strong pull for a weaker central government and stronger individual state governments. But with the rebels wanting federal regulation of local corrupt government, and state law officials frustrated by rebels evading local jurisdiction by simply crossing a state line, both sides saw reasons for a stronger central government. The event pushed leaders into action and the Constitutional Convention was planned, leading to the U.S. Constitution.
Continuing on trail, we walked through more fields to the other side of the river valley. We met Nick, or Medic, a SoBo, just before the climb up Mt. Bushnell. By then the rain was coming down enough for me to pull my umbrella out. The climb was nice with occasional views out into the Housatonic River Valley. The rain ceased by 7:00PM so we found a flat, dry place to pitch the tent. More rain is forecasted for tonight and tomorrow.

Steadier rain moved in overnight. In the morning, we waited for a slowdown in the rain before making a move to pack up, hitting the trail just before 8:00AM. We stopped at the Hemlocks Shelter to use the privy; it was a super nice shelter and no one signed the log book last night so it was probably empty. Dang, should of stayed there last night and kept dry! Oh well, next time. Nice climb up to the top of Mt. Everett. Although the rain stopped, the top was all fogged in so we didn't have any views. The descent from Mt. Everett was slippery, then we climbed back up Mt. Race. Once again the top was shrouded in cloud but the trail followed a cool cliff edge for a bit. It was kind of eerie walking along a wet rock slab next to a cliff that disappears into foggy nothingness!
From Mt. Race we dropped into Sage's Ravine, a narrow gulch between Mt. Plantain and Bear Mountain. The creek was pretty, flowing clear into nice pools between mossy rocks. Unfortunately, the rain started up again and it was too stormy for a swim, but it would be a nice place to play if it were hot out! Climbing out of Sage's Ravine, we crossed into Connecticut; seven states done, seven left to go! Next the trail climbs over Bear Mountain. Apparently, it is an extremely steep climb with rock scrambling, 450ft in 0.3 miles, a mini White Mountains experience. It also gets very slippery when wet. We already dealt with slipping on the wet rock crossing Mt. Race and Mt. Everett so we decided against climb Bear Mountain and took the Wet Weather Route around the mountain, adding 0.3 miles to our day. 
Beyond that, we had an easy descent down to Undermountain Road. We followed the road 0.7 miles towards the hamlet of Salisbury, CT. We arrived at Maria's house around 2:30PM. Maria, who is 92 years old, has been hosting hikers for 30 years! She can't hear much of anything but she still gets around with her walker. Her grandson and a good friend help turn over rooms so she can keep hosting hikers. We're the only ones here tonight though. We took our showers and laid everything out to dry before walking down to the local market to find some food for dinner. Unfortunately, they closed at 4:00PM today since it's the holiday. We missed closing time by 15 minutes and we are all out of trail food so we have nothing! Luckily, a pizza place in the nearby town of Lakeside was still open and delivering. So we ordered delivery and made our way back to Maria's house. The little coffee shop in town had a sign up saying it was closed until Sept 20th for the owner's vacation. Dang, they looked like they had good pastries! Once pizza was delivered, we settled down in our room and watched some TV shows. The rain came back in earnest after dark. Weather forecast states 1-2"" of rain over night with a chance of local flooding! Glad we're inside tonight! Glad some of these creeks and springs can get reloaded!

A giant rain storm has hit, another two inches of rain is forecasted to fall today. Unfortunately, we're in the most inconvenient of places - Connecticut: Land of the super expensive BnB's and Country Club Inns. Luckily, we're in Salisbury where local resident Maria rents out rooms to hikers for $40 per person. It's kind of awkward hanging out in someone's house for a zero; I prefer having my own space and privacy by staying in a motel. But the price is right and her place is comfortable. Much preferable to hiking in nonstop heavy rain! So we decided to spend another night here. We ate trailfood for breakfast as the rain was falling too hard for a walk down to the market. Around noon, the rain, although still steady, let up enough for us to venture out to the market to buy our resupply and sandwiches for lunch. There's a little strip of land right on the main street where someone keeps sheep and chickens, the critters are alway eyeing us when we walk by! We made another trip to the market one in the evening to buy dinner. By this time the rain had stopped. A relaxing day in town. 
A weird thing happens on these long hikes. After spending months sleeping outside, it becomes uncomfortable to sleep indoors. We've definitely hit that point now. Don't get me wrong, I love getting a shower and laundry, I love being able to dry my stuff out. But when it comes to sleeping, I sleep terrible compared to outside. The room is always too stuffy. And if we turn on the air conditioning, the mattress itself seems to retain heat and feels stuffy as well. I end up waking every few hours to turn to a cooler position and try to get comfortable. That combined with light and/or TV so we usually stay up later than normal but still wake at 6:00AM. For Mat, the antique bed in this particular room is much too short, so he is further uncomfortable by the wood footboard preventing him from fully stretching out. We're both usually pretty tired after staying in town and look forward to sleeping outside!","Salisbury, CT

The rain storm has passed. Local news reported that Great Barrington, 15 air miles away, received 4.2"" of rain with the storm. Glad we weren't hiking in that!! We did a quick jaunt down to the market one last time for some breakfast sandwiches and coffee, watched by the farm critters on main street. We ate on our way back to Maria's house and grabbed our packs. We were walking in earnest by 9:15AM, making our way the 0.7 miles back to the AT. We climbed up and over Mt. Prospect, surprised the trail wasn't a mud pit; it actually was quite dry even though the sun hasn't been out yet. Dropping from Mt. Prospect, we intersected the Housatonic River at Great Falls. Usually the river drops down the 30ft rock face in a spindly fashion. Today, the river raged in flood mode, filling up the entire drop in a roiling, foamy white water. We decided to stop for an early lunch to enjoy the waterfall in all it's glory; it was so loud we could barely hear each other! 
After lunch, we continued down river, entering a little trail park and enjoying flat trail along the banks of the Housatonic. Eventually, the trail joined some busy roads and then finally climbed away from the river up Sharon & Easter Mountains. It was somewhere on this climb that we crossed SoBo mile 700; 1200 miles done and under 1000 miles left! We passed by quite a few interesting rock formations today such as Giant's Thumb and Roger's Ramp. We also noticed the ground cover is extremely brushy so we decided to stay in a designated campsite. We reached Cesar Brook Campsite around 6:00PM. One other hiker was setting up his hammock, a northbound section hiker. There are a lot of cicadas and frogs making noise tonight, and, of course, a Barred Owl in the mix!

Walking by 7:45AM, a thin fog clinging to the trees. As the sun rose higher, the forest took on that ethereal look until the light fog burned off. Eventually we dropped down to Guinea creek, the largest non-bridged creek crossing in Connecticut. A previous commenter on the navigation app said they heard it was waist deep and fast after the rain so they did a one-mile reroute. Luckily it was a dry rock-hop for us, maybe calf deep if one where to actually ford it. I can't imagine the creek getting waist deep as it is pretty wide but who knows. We climbed up Silver Hill, meeting Phoenix on the climb. She is a flip-floppers as well, making her way back to NoBo mile 730. She was fun to talk to, we ended up leapfrogging with her throughout the day. After Silver Hill, the trail dropped back down to the banks of the Housatonic River and we had five glorious miles of flat riverside walking: beautiful wide trail set between the river and one of those old rock walls. The river was flowing so nicely, I once again wished we had our packrafts! In fact, I bet one could Aqua Blaze (float instead of hike) practically all of Connecticut: put in on the Housatonic River near Great Barrington, MA (mile 668) and pull out near the Connecticut/New York Border at Ten Mile River (mile 732), then hike the last three miles of Connecticut. One would have to portage around Great Falls, of course, but that should be doable.
We ate some lunch before starting the steep climb up to Caleb's Peak and what followed was a series of ups and downs. At least the temperature wasn't too bad and the terrain was pretty. We stopped at Mt. Algo Shelter for the privy and water. Two white tail deer were hanging out at the empty campsite; first time seeing deer since flipping. We gained the top of Preston Hill and traversed the wide plateau, dead leaves crunching under our feet as we walked along the grassy, open deciduous forest. The trail crossed into New York for two miles to summit Schaghticoke (pronounced SKAT-eh-coke) Mountain. The immediate forest around us feels fall-ish but when looking out of the viewpoint at the top of the mountain, the surrounding hills still look very green. 
We dropped down Schaghticoke Mountain and back into Connecticut. We reached Bulls Bridge Road. Here a hiker can walk 0.5-miles off trail to a market. We planned to resupply at this market but it was getting fairly late, already 6:00PM. So I took the tent and Mat took my trash. He walked to the market to do our resupply while I hiked on to Ten Mile River Campsite to set up camp. The trail follows along the Housatonic again as the river enters a shallow gorge. There are some actual rapids here and a drop that is beyond my skill level so I would have to do a portage here too if I followed my Connecticut Aqua Blaze dream. I saw another White Tail deer and I met Canyon the horse, who's rider was trying to train to like humans so she gave me some horse cookies to feed him. He was a pretty horse! I reached Ten Mile River Campsite, surprised to see no one else present. I set up the tent and my bed before walking down to the river to rinse off. A mama and baby white tail deer ventured out into the grass field to eat. Just before dark, Mat arrived. He saw a beaver munching away on a branch during his walk to the campsite. The market is owned by a nice Indian family and they had all sorts of microwaveable Indian food so Mat brought dinner of warmed microwave Indian food. It was so amazingly delicious! We devoured it while the darkness fell. I set up his bed while he took his turn at the river. We fell asleep to the sound of cicadas, frogs, and the rushing river, out bellies full of delicious Indian food!

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Palak Paneer Mat: Treefall - walking the straight trail along the river, we heard what sounded like a large rock banging against another large rock. The sound happened again, and then a third time. But the third time a tree actually came down, landing in the water. The river was overflowing and undermined the tree, causing it to fall. It wasn't a big tree but it sure made loud cracks before going down. Now we know what a falling tree sounds like before coming down!

I slept in until after 7:00AM so we started walking a little later than usual: 8:20AM. We immediately started the climb up Tenmile Hill. At the top, there was a little opening for a view to the next ridge to the west. We were taken aback by seeing swaths of red within the green trees on the next ridge over. Well, either red or dead. From this distance we couldn't really tell but it's hard to imagine such large swaths of trees turning red when we haven't seen any up close yet, so they must be really dried up trees. Within a few miles, we entered New York, leaving New England behind! Eight states down, six left to go! Immediately, there is a split in the trail where the ATC has hikers walk on a road to avoid crossing a creek of which the bridge washed out in 2019. Some people commented on the app that the creek is a simple rock hop and the trail is more pleasant to walk than the road. We took the trail and found it just as others had said: pleasant walking with an easy rock hop across the creek. So far the terrain seems to alternate between open forest parks with minimal ground cover, and overgrown swamp or brushy rock. We've also noticed larger, more solid outcroppings of rock on the ridges. Above us, we noticed an increase of flight traffic, mostly helicopters and small planes. We realized we were walking right across the flight path between Albany and New York City. 
Just after noon, we reached NY Route 22. Visible from the trail is DC Malaysian Food Truck. David and Cathy have been running the food truck for a couple years and are extremely hiker friendly. He offered us a few free samples, then made our ordered meals. He keeps chairs in the shade and offered to fill out water bottles, stating he keeps an extra 40 gals of water to give to hikers. The food was delicious! Plus I have been really craving milk tea and he had Thai Boba Tea!! I was a very happy girl! While we were enjoying our meal, northbounders Irish and BedHead arrived. Irish is from Seattle, Bedhead from New York. They're soon going to flip up to Monson, Maine, to hike the 100 Mile Wilderness to Katahdin and then head south from Monson back to Connecticut. They started chowing down on their food when an older couple arrived and chatted us up while waiting for their food. His brother does trail angeling in Connecticut and he himself has a trailname of Fat Tire. They were funny. After finishing our meals, we bid farewell to everyone and continued on. Immediately after crossing the road, we crossed Amtrak rail. There is a train stop right on trail where hikers can ride straight into New York City, or New Yorkers can ride straight to the trail and start hiking! If both of us hadn't been to NYC multiple times, we would have done it. But there's really not much more we're interested in doing in the big city - especially dressed as stinky hikers - so we kept walking.
The day became quite hot and humid. We climbed up the next plateau and passed under the Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the Appalachian Trail. It's over 300 years old and has a diameter of six feet. It's huge! Unfortunately, it's right on a rather busy road so we didn't rest next to it. Still cool to see though! We continued climbing up the ridge, entering the forest we had seen from Tenmile Hill earlier today. These trees are definitely dried out and not red! It's weird to see large swaths of them looking practically dead! Next, we passed by Nuclear Lake, the site of a plutonium research center that was closed in 1972 after a chemical explosion. Mat decided not to go swimming in that lake. We me southbounder One Mile but didn't get to chat much. 
The rest of the day was forest walking punctuated by multiple road crossings. Despite the recent rain, the creeks and springs are still dried up in New York but there has been full gallon jugs of water at every road crossing so we've been staying topped up. The air finally cooled a bit as the sun dropped lower in the sky so we walked a few more miles before finding a place to camp prior to the Interstate 84 corridor. Once again the frogs are serenading us, outsinging the cicadas, which makes sense since we saw a lot of frogs and toads today on trail. And, of course the Barred Owl call in the distance. A full moon is rising (we can actually see the moon!), very orange in the atmospheric haze.

Walking by 7:45AM and, within a few miles, we crossed over Interstate 84, which starts/ends in Portland, OR. On the PCT, we crossed under it at Cascade Locks (I think it coincides with I-80 where the CDT crosses it.) Not long after that, we cut off trail to get to Mountaintop Market for a resupply. Unfortunately, the pizza & gelato place next door wasn't open for another two hours. But the market had delicious breakfast sandwiches and Mat got some coffee. We blue-blazed back to the trail, following a road through pretty countryside. We regained the ridge but the trail parallels I-84 for a few miles so there was a lot of road noise. We dropped down and crossed under Taconic State Parkway. Beyond that, we reached Ralph's Peak Shelter, one of the AT's more famous shelters. It's a donated property in a neighborhood. The small building has bunks with mattresses, the large lawn has multiple picnic tables and yard chairs, and trash bins are available. Apparently, hikers can order pizza delivery to this shelter! We just took a break, propping our feet up in the shady lawn. 
Eventually we pulled ourselves away from the relaxing spot and climbed back up the ridge. We saw a fairly large Milk Snake as we crossed under power lines. At 2:30PM, we arrived at our afternoon goal of Canopus Lake. It's located within a NY State Park and has a center with water and bathrooms. Normally there is a grill but they closed for the season last week. We tanked up on water then went down to the lake to swim. It was very refreshing! After swimming, we met the manager of the park and chatted with him a while. We asked about the trees that appear to be dried up. He informed us birch trees do this because they're sensitive to drought, but they just shut down their leaves earlier than other trees and will make a come back in the spring. A relief to hear, I was getting kind of worried that large swaths of trees were dying. 
With much cooler evening temps, we continued on. We reached a stretch of trail that was really flat and well graded. We realized after a while we were walking on trail built into the top of a rock wall. Funny that walking on a rock wall was less rocky than the trail! The rest of the evening we spent hiking rolling ups and downs. The terrain was fairly rocky with thick underbrush so we walked until dark before finding an open, flat area to pitch our tent. Lots of frogs and cicadas again tonight!

Woke to rain starting so we scrambled to get the vestibule situated. Then we realized it was 6:00AM so we might as well start our day; it is a town day! The sprinkles passed and we packed up dry, walking by 7:00AM. Early on, we came upon a plaque near an old stone foundation. The plaque stated the foundation was remnants of a barn where General Washington had his troops inoculated against Smallpox. Even President Washington believed in vaccinations! It was a cool piece of history to see! At the next road crossing, we came upon One Mile, Mayo, and the twins Hunter and Lake. A nearby resident was bringing them breakfast sandwiches and coffee! We chatted with them until the local came up. She offered us the same but we felt bad sending her back to her house to cook for us so we turned down her offer. We bade the group farewell to enjoy their breakfast; we'll see them in a few miles at the Appalachian Market. 
We continued on, passing by Snails-it, who's about 10 years older than us and is completing the second half of her thru-hike, her husband supporting her in their van. We reached the market at 10:00AM. We bought some breakfast sandwiches and were eating at the outside tables when the group of guys showed up and joined us. The twins, Hunter and Lake, are from Missouri and just graduated high school. Mayo is a young guy from Utah and, although this is his first thru-hike, he's hiked multiple sections of the AT. One Mile is our age, from the Chicago area, and had completed the AT via section hikes already but is attempting a southbound thru. It was fun chatting with them. Everyone took off one by one. Mayo and the twins planned to hike through but One Mile decided to stay in Fort Montgomery as well. We did our resupply to Greenwood Lake since Fort Montgomery doesn't have much of a resupply option, then continued on, climbing up White Rock and the ridge above the Hudson River. Rain came and went. Dayhikers appeared as we neared Bear Mountain Bridge. We walked the Bear Mountain Bridge across the surprisingly large Hudson River. It was somber walking across the Hudson River on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Some of the Fort Montgomery locals informed us the hijacker steered the planes to follow the Hudson River as their landmark to get back to NYC and the twin towers.
On the far side of the bridge, we ran into One Mile again. We were considering walking through the zoo before going into Fort Montgomery since the trail goes right through it and it's open only during limited hours; it would be nice to complete it so we don't have to worry about the timing tomorrow. But One Mile had already called the hotel owner and he was on his way to come pick us all up. The owner grabbed us and brought us back to Bear Mountain Bridge motel. It was small but comfortable and clean, and the owner did our laundry for an additional fee! We showered and headed over to the BBQ joint across the street. The skies really opened up as we ate; I'm grateful to be in town right now! We walked back to the hotel and spent the rest of the day relaxing, ordering pizza delivery for dinner.

Woke and walked down to the nearby cafe for breakfast sandwiches. The owner of the hotel was there. We told him we'll get dropped off at 9:30AM but then he started to pressure us to be gone before then. We told him the zoo, the next section of trail, doesn't open until 10:00AM. He told us to blue blaze around it. Reluctantly, we left the room at 9:10AM and the owner dropped us off where he picked us up. We hung out in the parking lot for 40 minutes until the Trailside Zoo opened at 10:00AM. Had we known we'd have such pressure to be out so early, we would have walked through the zoo yesterday and requested to be picked up at the Bear Mountain Lodge parking lot instead! The little zoo was enjoyable; a small zoo where animals raised in captivity or injured are cared for. The Great Horned and Barred Owls were cool. There was also a reptilian house where we saw all sorts of snakes, toads, and turtles. 
The trail left the zoo and went underneath U.S. Route 9 to Hessian Lake, a very large picnic area with many picnic tables, both covered and open, as well as vending machines and trash bins. There was a concession stand but it was closed for the season. It must get very busy here on nice weekends! From there we climbed up Bear Mountain, the trail comprised of beautiful stone steps. We reached the top just before noon. The tower was locked but the low clouds prevented us from seeing out too far anyway. We found the vending machines and purchased ice cream sandwiches and soda to go with our lunch. We sat by the tower and enjoyed our lunch. Before long, the clouds broke and lifted. It was then we spotted the New York City skyline! And someone unlocked the tower so I climbed to the top for views above the trees. 
Eventually we left the top, descending into Harriman State Park. The trail does some rolling ups and downs. We met Nine Lives, a day hiker who has section-hiked the AT over the decades. We dropped down to Palisades Interstate Parkway, which hikers must cross on foot. It's very sketchy as cars were going like 70mph! But a wide stretch of land separates the different directions so we only had to worry about one direction at a time. A sign next to the road informed NYC was only 34 miles away! With that sketchy crossing behind us, we climbed up Black Mountain. The temperature increased and humidity was very high. We felt very sluggish all day due to the heat and humidity. But we reached the top and found a shady spot to stop and rest and enjoy the view of the New York City skyline. After Black Mountain, we rolled along nice forests. All the creeks were dry but a nice local has been keeping up water caches at all the roads within Harriman State Park. We were very grateful. We ran into Snails-it again. 
We climbed up Fingerboard Mountain, crossing SoBo Mile 800, which puts us at mile 1300 completed and about 900 left! The recent rainfall caused the grass to green up, which added a whole other beauty to the forest. We stumbled upon a beautiful four-point white tail buck. He wasn't afraid of us and walked off slowly. He was beautiful! We walked until 7:00PM when we found a flat, low spot to pitch our tent. Thunderstorms are forecasted tonight with heavy rain so we wanted a spot safe from possible lightening and won't flood from possible heavy rainfall tonight.

Loud lightning woke us from a dead sleep in the middle of the night. It sounded like strike lightning, versus lightning that flashes in the clouds above. I don't know how close it was as we were asleep during the flash but the boom was very loud! Luckily, that was the worst of the lightning; the rest was either far away or up in the clouds. It did rain solidly but I don't think it was the 1.5"" predicted; if it did rain that much I slept right through it! Luckily we had set up our tent well and the inner tent was completely dry. In fact, we were able to pack up completely dry except the fly, which we unhooked from the inner tent and Mat stored on the outside of his pack to keep everything else dry. The rain stopped by the time we started walking at 7:30AM, although the forest was very drippy. We came upon Lemon Squeezer pretty quickly, where the trail goes down a very narrow crack in the granite and out a hole in the boulders. One Mile was sitting on a log right after. He stayed at Fingerboard Mountain Shelter last night. He didn't mention much about lightning, the strike must have not hit up that direction, but he did mention a bear coming into camp early in the morning.
One Mile walked with us a bit, although we were in a hurry because we had to retrieve a package waiting at the post office in Greenwood Lake 15 miles away before the post office closes at 5:00PM. We were trying our best to move along but the trail traverses some ridges, causing us to go straight up and down, and the humidity was 75-90% today, depending on the weather website used. Even just sitting we'd pour sweat, I soaked my entire bandana and it wouldn't dry. Ugh. By the time we reached Bellvale Mountain Ridge, the clouds broke apart and a heavenly breeze picked up. Once we gained the ridge, the trail was nice and flat. Looking at the navigation app, Mat realized there was a bus stop at the pass that drops right into town. I looked up the schedule and realized the next bus came in 20 minutes but it would be two hours before the next. We booked it the last mile and made it to the bus stop with five minutes to spare! 
The bus came and we hopped on; it was kind of expensive, $5 for the two of us to ride a few miles, but it was air conditioned! We were dropped off in front of the post office by 2:30PM. A restaurant called The Grill was steps away so we went there for a late lunch before heading over to the post office. The Grill was a little mom and pop place, barely could fit four tables inside and cash only. But man was it freaking delicious and priced right! Stuffed, we sauntered over to the post office where we picked up our package. I changed into my new T-shirt, tatters going into the trash. CVS was next door so we resupplied enough to get us to Unionville tomorrow. With all our town chores done, we walked to the end of town to hitch back up to the AT instead of waiting an hour for the bus going up. We stuck our thumbs out at a few cars when a guy parked across the street hollered at us that he'll take us up the hill. Turns out he is the owner of the local taphouse. He was wondering how to advertise to hikers so Mat told him about the Far Out app. He dropped us off at the Bellvale Farms Creamery per our request and wished us a good trip. The Creamery sells amazing ice cream and is only 0.2 miles from the trail. I was super surprised and excited to see Matcha Green Tea was one of the ice cream flavors available, seriously one of my favorite ice cream flavors ever! I got a waffle cone of matcha and Mat got himself a double scoop cup of cookies & cream. We enjoyed our ice cream while looking out from the Creamery's fantastic views. 
Just as we finished, One Mile showed up and got his ice cream. He's going down into Warwick to the drive-in movie theater. The theater is super hiker friendly, allowing hikers to buy entrance and set up their tents on the lawn, lending out portable radios so hikers can listen to the movie while lying down in their tent. Sounds like a good time! But we have to get to our next package in Delaware Water Gap, PA. If we went to the movie, we would arrive in DWG after the post office closes on Saturday, which would require us to take a zero on Sunday so we can retrieve our package on Monday. We're just not interested in that kind of delay. So we bade One Mile goodbye and continued on the ridge. Although kind of rocky, it wasn't as bad as traversing perpendicular across the ridges like we were doing earlier, plus the wind really picked up and blew out all the clouds and humidity. The weather felt great and we were able to bust out quite a few more miles because of it! On one high, rocky outcropping, we spotted the upper half of the New York City skyline: faint shimmering pink vertical lines against a gray background as the tall buildings reflected the last of the sunlight. Very cool to see. Just after 7:00PM, we reached the New York - New Jersey border. Nine states done, five left! We found a nice spot to pitch the tent just after. I walked a few hundred feet beyond our campsite to where the trees parted where I was able to catch a glimpse of the NYC buildings lighting up but it was still fairly obscured by the surrounding trees.

Slept well with the cooler temps and steady breeze. We were walking by 7:50AM and had a quiet morning of nice trail. Surprisingly, we came upon a lot of day hikers when we descended from Pinwheel Vista. I began to wonder if it was a weekend but then realized it's probably the first nice, cool, non-humid day people have had in a while and they're out enjoying it! On the descent, we came upon what looked like a caterpillar but flat and with a body made of chitin instead of fuzz. We ran the google lens on it and found it was a glow worm. That would be cool to see in the dark!
We reached Heaven Hill Farm at 11:30AM. Perusing the edible goods, Mat spotted a 9"" quiche on sale for 50% off. We bought the quiche and some drinks then took it outside to eat. We ate the whole thing between the two of us! Then I had a piece of chocolate cream pie and Mat had some ice cream, then we both had to try the homemade cider donuts the place was famous for! After an hour stop, we waddled out of there, overly stuffed with deliciousness! Thank goodness we're going SoBo and had flat terrain in front of us, I can't imagine going NoBo up the steep grade feeling so full! In fact, New Jersey has been quite nice; pretty with relatively flat terrain. 
We entered Wawayanda State Park and once again were amazed by the number of day hikers. Here the trail follows a 1.5-mile boardwalk across a large wetland marsh. We saw a number of turtles sunning themselves on the banks of Wawayanda Creek. The trail led us up over a set of hills before we dropped down to Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge, a small rectangular plot of marshy land that attracts ducks and other water fowl. Once again there were a lot of day hikers. Some miles after that, we reached the road into Unionville, just across the border back into NY. We walked the 0.4 miles to the General Market for a resupply. The deli was still selling cold sandwiches so we ordered some to pack out for dinner. We walked the 0.4 back to the trail and followed it for a bit until we found a flat spot far away from the outlying neighborhoods. We had our cicadas and frogs competing against the noise of town, roads, and air traffic. We could hear the bells from the local church chime out the hours. A group of turkeys walked by. Once in bed we dived into our sandwiches. Mat ordered the Italian sub and proclaimed it the best sandwich he's ever had. I had egg salad on a sub and it was delicious! These sub sandwiches were over a foot long, weighed about a pound, and were made with the most delicious hoagie bread ever. I didn't think I would be able to eat all of mine due to it's size but it was so delicious I ate it all!

Walking by 7:30AM, we pretty quickly came upon the junction with Secret Shelter, a private camping/hunting cabin owned by a former AT hiker and open for hikers to use. There is a spigot on property so we headed in. We also heard Jake the Donkey resides on the property, keeping it safe from predators and the lawn free of overgrowth. We found Jake napping in the morning sun but he quickly got up to greet us. We gave him scratches as we filled up our water. Some deer came in close on the neighboring property, which he didn't care for at all. He watched them closely to ensure they didn't encroach on his property.
We continued on, enjoying the mellow New Jersey terrain. We ran into One Mile; he is staying with friends in Warwick and they are slackpacking him through northern New Jersey so he was hiking light and fast NoBo in this section. Eventually, we left the valley floor and climbed up onto Kittatinny ridge, cresting at High Point State Park. On the state's highest point, New Jersey built a building identical to the Washington Monument in D.C. The tower is a side trip from the AT so we bypassed it for the scenic lookout tower on trail. From there we walked the last mile to High Point State Park headquarters for our lunch break, reaching it just before noon. The headquarters is located in a beautiful stone and wood building. Hikers can purchase candy bars and soda and can charge electronics and fill water bottles for free. We purchased some soda and sat at the picnic table outside. The temperature was so nice and the breeze so strong we actually got chilled and had to sit in the sun! That hasn't happened at all yet this season!
After lunch, we continued on, enjoying rocky but flat ridge walking with a nice breeze. We saw many snakes: a group of three garters (we think two males were competing over a female?) and two separate Rat Snakes. The big, black Rat Snakes were thoroughly warmed up and moved super fast! We continued following the ridge, stopping for another break at Sunrise Mountain Overlook and passing by Culver Fire Tower. As we dropped down the ridge into Culver Gap, we came around the corner and almost ran into some sort of bird of prey sitting in the middle of the trail. It took off, clutching a limp grey squirrel in it's talons. I'm not sure what kind of bird of prey it was but the grey squirrel was nearly as big as it was! Very cool to see. We found a flat spot to pitch the tent before entering town. Lots of road noise tonight.

It was actually cold this morning, below 50°F! Mat picked up a virus of some sort, waking up with a sore throat, headache, and nasal congestion. We get into town tomorrow so we'll test for COVID then. We started walking at 7:45AM, crossing Route 206 early on before regaining the Kittatinny Ridge. The walking was fantastic on top of the ridge, relatively flat although a bit rocky. The temperature was perfect and a nice breeze kept the humidity down. It was lovely! Poor Mat looked a little miserable with his head congestion though. 
We entered Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area fairly early in the day and enjoyed long sections of very nice, wide trail. We saw many critters within the DWGNRA, including many white tail deer, three black bears, and a large praying mantis! Mat saw the first black bear; it turned and ran off before I could spot it but Mat says it was small. In the early evening, we watched a small black bear scramble down a tree and run off, then, later on, we spooked another small black bear as it was about to cross the trail about 30 yards ahead of us. All three black bears were rather small and all three turned tail and ran fast away from us. The praying mantis was large, about five inches long. They're such alert and curious bugs, turning it's head and large eyes to look directly at us. Such cool critters! We also came upon a number of Spotted Lantern flies. Although pretty to look at, they are aggressively invasive and wildlife management requests the insects be killed whenever spotted. We did our outdoor civic duty, killing a total of three we found today.
Towards the evening, we walked into a habitat consisting of many small oak plants growing out of the dry grass; it reminded us so much of the Sierra foothills of California, particularly around Chico. We called it a day a bit early, around 6:00PM, because Mat was tired and we only have seven miles into town tomorrow. The frogs serenaded us tonight.

Cresting from our campsite, we saw a snake of clouds settled on top of the Delaware River, outlining it's course through the land, just like it did yesterday. We rounded pretty Sunfish Pond, spooking an Osprey, before dropping into the valley of Dunfield Creek. Eventually the trail reached the creek, located within a fairly steep valley with some rock flumes and nice swimming holes. Even though it was early, we already came upon multiple day hikers. We reached the parking lot and passed under Interstate 80, which starts/ends in San Francisco. The PCT crosses it at Donner Pass, and the CDT crosses it at Rawlings, WY. We stopped at the Kittatinny visitor center parking lot for a little break. The parking lot filled up quickly; a nice weekend day so lots of day hikers! We crossed the Delaware River via a pedestrian walkway along I-80. The bridge was surprisingly and uncomfortably bouncy! Painted on the sidewalk was the sign marking our entrance into Pennsylvania. Ten states completed, four left to go! We reached the town of Delaware Water Gap and the post office at 10:45AM. We retrieved our package: new shoes and a new tent (and also cookies)! We mailed our old tent back home; hopefully the new one works out! With that business finished, we called an Uber into Stroudsburg where we were able to get to a pharmacy and purchase a COVID test. Mat tested negative so it must be a regular head cold. We were able to get him some Sudafed, throat lozenges, and tissues. I'm waiting for my turn but so far I haven't had any symptoms. We walked over to Burger King to loiter for an hour before heading over to Walmart for a resupply. By this point we could check into our hotel so we called another Uber for a ride back to Delaware Water Gap. Laundry, shower, chores. But Del Water Gap has some nice little restaurants. We ordered Ramen takeout from a little Japanese sake joint, and dessert from the local bakery.

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658173,"We decided to take a zero today. Mat is still feeling under the weather and I slept terribly last night (due to not being outside). If I'm tired I'm more likely to catch Mat's cold, which would slow us down even more, so we figured we'll stay and rest. The next section of trail is rugged with rocks; not necessarily steep just a lot of active stepping, and many a hiker have been injured when not paying full attention. It's in our best interest to tackle this section of trail more rested. It was kind of hard for Mat to suggest we stay another night because he's so excited to play with his new tent! Dunkin Donuts downstairs for breakfast, then spent the rest of the day resting, eating salad kits for lunch that we bought at Walmart yesterday and snacking on leftovers/excess trail food. For dinner, Mat ordered pizza from the local joint but I can get pizza anywhere so we swung by the Apple Pie Bakery on our way to pick up the pizza so I could get a Shepard's pie for dinner. Pretty muggy today, hopefully it's less humid tomorrow.","

They were ginormous! Completely filled up, we walked to the edge of town, spotting One Mile at Coven Coffee Shop. He said he was going to head back out in an hour so he'll be right behind us. Around 9:30AM, we climbed out of town, regaining the Kittatinny Ridge by reaching the top of Mount Minsi on the south side of the Delaware River. Once on top of the ridge, the walking was nice and flat with the occasional rock jumbles. Just after noon, we reached the Kirkridge Shelter. There we met Chef Boyardee, a young man from Colorado going SoBo. He attempted to thru-hike the CDT last year but ended up getting off after 1000 miles. He figured the AT will be an easier trail for a first thru-hike than the CDT so here he is. He said he met many more people on the CDT than he has going southbound on the AT (minus the northbounders), stating he hiked Vermont to New Jersey pretty much by himself, no other sobo hikers around. But now there are three hikers a day ahead of us, two a few hours ahead, and four behind in town so a little SoBo bubble here. He was nice to chat with. He took off while we continued our break. After lunch, our water filled up, we set out again. The trail got rockier. Thunderheads built up overhead. The thundercloud directly above us got so dark it felt like dusk and some of the cicadas started chirping. That cloud opened up, rumbling thunder with rain and wind but no lightning. All while we were walking over rocky terrain so we couldn't move very fast. My new shoes will now be forever damp, sigh. Fortunately, the storm didn't last long and blew out by the time we reached Wind Gap. The sun came back out and rest of the evening was pretty in the forests. We found a flat spot free of rocks to pitch the tent. It's bigger than our last tent but roomier inside. So far I like it, we'll have to see how it handles a rainstorm though. Some pretty fireworks were going off, perched high on the ridge we could catch a glimpse though the trees.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Tree Worm - we saw a lot of millipedes today. Before the AT, I had only seen a millipede once in the wild and thought they were quite creepy. I realized today that I no longer view them in that light anymore but simply as tree worms; worms with legs that eat wood and leaves to produce soil.

It's fantastic walking on a ridge but it's definitely dry, especially this time of year, especially during a drought year! At the spring we met and chatted with Buzz, who is from New Jersey. We filled up to capacity and walked the 0.4 back up to the trail before continuing on. We made good time walking along ridge with a nice breeze. At one point, we came upon the back half of a Black Rat Snake, the front half disappearing down a hole in the middle of the trail. It didn't slide out with the vibration of our footfalls. Mat wondered if it was dead but I could see slight peristalsis movement of its body. ""I think it's eating!"" I told Mat. We gave the snake a wide berth so it could consume it's meal in peace.Before reaching Little Gap, we came upon an interesting looking snake we hadn't seen before. It was thick but rather short for it's girth. It had a pattern along it's back: wide tan bars with black spots on each end of the bar. It didn't have a rattle nor a triangle head but it's neck flattened out as it slithered away, almost like what I imagine a cobra could do. We snapped a picture and Google Lensed it: Eastern Hog-nose snake, also known as a Puff Adder. Although not endangered, apparently they're relatively rare. Cool to see! We watched it slither off. We crossed the road and found some awesome trail magic on the other side: someone left a huge bag of dehydrated meals and some water jugs! Mat and I each picked out a Mountain House Biscuits and Gravy and Mat topped up his water. The ridge after Little Gap was different; more open with some small pine trees. We enjoyed fantastic views to the north, a steady breeze keeping us cool. That's when we spotted the hundreds of Spotted Lantern Flies covering multiple trees. Native to China, the Spotted Lantern Fly was first identified in Pennsylvania in 2014. It feeds on the bark of trees, specifically fruit trees, and excrete a sugary substance while they eat, which encourages the growth of a black, sooty mold that kills off the tree. We probably spent a good half hour killing the invasive species before eventually picking up our pace again. We re-entered dense forest when I stopped in my tracks due to a huge snake stretched out lengthwise on trail I hadn't seen before. It was as thick around as Mat's forearm in the middle, black scales upon greenish skin. My eyes followed the body down to the tail, which was closest to me, and I spotted the rattle. Suddenly it coiled up fast, sticking up it's tail to rattle. Mat and I leaped back enough to be out of striking distance. A timber rattler! I didn't realize they were so dark in color, I thought they were more grey. The snake stayed coiled up on trail, at least not buzzing anymore but not moving off trail either. Mat and I slowly worked our way around it, cutting off trail to stay out of striking range, keeping a close eye on the snake and as well as where we stepped, hoping there wasn't a mate or a nest nearby. We safely made our way around it. Back on trail, we turned to admire the predator. Creepy but at the same time pretty; definitely huge with 7 rattles on it's tail. We were a bit jumpy after that but at least I know what to look for in a timber rattler!Not long after, we reached the descent down to Lehigh Gap, a short but steep scramble. There were day hikers on this section so luckily the snakes where scared away where everyone uses hand or foot holds. We reached the bottom and maneuvered an interesting crossing of Route 248 before crossing the bridge over the Lehigh River. Mat told me about a bike race he partook in at Lehigh Valley Velodrome just south of here; the Junior Nationals he competed in while in high school. On the far side of the bridge, we climbed back up to the Kittatinny Ridge, stopping at a nice spring for a break. We watched a father cardinal being harassed by his almost-full-sized chick. Back on top of the ridge, we walked in and out of beautiful forests of what I think are Black Gum trees (aka Black Tupelo. I could totally be wrong about the species, though). The only underbrush growing beneath the trees were bright green ferns, the trunk sticking up with a slight twisty curl to them, free of branches. The tops have turned orange or red, the first of the legit fall colors! We found an open flat spot in one of these pretty forests and pitched our tent for the night.

Early on we hit the rocky bits of Bake Oven Knob, Bear Rocks, and Knife's Edge. Today actually being a dry day, the rock maneuvering wasn't all that bad. The tricky part was scanning for snakes then scanning for the next spot to place my foot; which made for fairly slow going. But we made our way through without snake bites or broken bones! We came upon Chef Boyardee again and chatted for a bit before continuing on to Thunderhead Lodge on PA Route 309. The deceptively named tavern (not actually a lodge) is closed today but they allow hikers to fill their water bottles at their outdoor spigot. Additionally, they have a huge, shaded grassy area with picnic tables in the back, as well as a dumpster. We fixed up lunch and took a nice break in the shade. We called ahead to the Microtel Inn outside of Port Clinton. It appears they are limiting the amount of guests allowed each night, most likely due to lack of help. She told us to call back tomorrow to see if they have rooms available.Continuing on along the top of Kittatinny Ridge, we had mostly smooth walking with occasional sections of rocky terrain. Eventually, the trail turned down off the ridge and crossed a creek near Hawk Mountain Road, which we reached at 4:30PM. We gratefully dropped our packs and stuck our pounded legs and feet into the cold, clear water and enjoyed a snack break. We were feeling pretty tired and had already done almost 20 miles for the day so we started the climb up to the next water source to grab water for the night and set up camp at the next dispersed campsite despite it being only 6:00PM. There is a forecast for possible thunderstorms overnight so we didn't want to finish the climb up to the ridge for camp. This campsite is about 300ft lower than the surrounding ridges so hopefully we're protected enough.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Cookie Crumbs - Mat spotted a bunch of cookie crumbs on my upper sleeping pad this morning.

The trail consisted of a nicely graded jeep road all the way up to the Pinnacle; it was lovely! We reached the Pinnacle at 8:40AM. Apparently a favorite day hike for locals and normally crowded, we had the place to ourselves! The views were fantastic: open farm fields nestled between small forested hills below, the puffy rain clouds above adding drama by streaking sun rays across it all. It was so scenic and peaceful. We stopped for a snack break but eventually the rain caught up so we moved out. Traversing to the other side of the plateau, thunder and lightning started. We found a dry spot to wait out the worst of the rainfall and looked over our maps. The descent from Pulpit Rock is probably going to be treacherous with wet rocks but we found an access road that drops down from Pulpit Rock and reconnects with the trail below so we decided to do that. Luckily the lightning and thunder didn't last long, and the rain subsided by the time we finished our access road alternate to rejoin the trail at Furnace Creek. We finished out the last few miles to town, gaining the top of a narrow ridge above the Little Schuylkill River before dropping all the way down. We passed a hornet's nest somewhere and Mat got stung again, for the third time this trail. With the cold, damp wind blowing, we were surprised the hornets were out and about. We found more of the Spotted Lantern Flies eating on some trees, black mold covering the trunk and the surrounding ground. We killed a bunch. Just before reaching town, Mat called the Microtel hotel again but they didn't have room. We reached Port Clinton, a cute town but currently without rooms as the only hotel in town is renovating. We ate lunch at the tavern while looking over our options. There is a Motel 6 about nine miles from Hamburg, next door to a restaurant and a Dollar General. Perfect! With lunch done, we went out to Hwy 61 to hitch. Even though the highway goes right through the little town and the speed limit sign says 35mph, everyone was driving 60mph! It was crazy! The cops could set up a speed trap here and rake in some money! But someone pulled over within 10 minutes and drove us directly to the Motel 6, he was going out of his way for us but waved off our gratitude. So nice of him! Did our chores; no laundry nearby so we just did some sink washing. Dinner at the restaurant next door.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Chicken - During the rainstorm, Mat watched me for when to deploy his umbrella, rain canary style.

We ate a ton of food and the bill was under $20! Man it's nice to be out of expensive New England and Mid-Atlantic! After breakfast, we headed next door to the Dollar General for resupply, then back to the hotel to organize and pack up. We called an Uber; the driver was born in Africa and told us about African hiking. Sounds cool! He dropped us off in Port Clinton and we were hiking by 10:45AM. A steep ascent back to the top of Kittatinny Ridge and the trail leveled out. We enjoyed wonderful walking with clear skies, a crisp breeze, and temps in the low 60's; seriously the best weather we've had on trail! The tread wasn't bad either: occasional rocky sections but otherwise smooth. It's dry on the ridge; we had a 15-mile water carry to a water source a quarter mile off- trail. But with weather like this I don't need much water to stay hydrated and we ended up going the full 17 miles to the on-trail water before filling up. We crossed super sketchy PA Route 183. The AT crosses the highway as it curves a ""C"" shape around the northern trailhead. Going northbound, hikers can see down both sides of the curve but, going southbound, bother directions are blind. On top of that, the road is four lanes across, and Pennsylvanians drive ridiculously fast! We waited at the roadside until we didn't hear any cars in either direction then ran across the four lanes, still having cars from both directions come up fast. But we made it safely across. We passed by the site of Fort Dietrich Snyder, a lookout post during the French-Indian war of 1755. Then we reached Hertline campground and creek, filled up, and continued on a few miles before finding a spot to pitch our tent for the night.

We slept good fully in our sleeping bags but the cold did make it hard to stir; didn't get to walking until 8:20AM. Within seven miles, we reached the SoBo Mile 1000 mark, which means we're at 1500. Strangely there wasn't any signage on the ground indicating 1000 miles completed for southbounders. The majority of the day was nice, forested walking on the ridgetop, mostly smooth but with the occasional rocky sections.In the afternoon, we dropped down and crossed underneath Interstate 81. On the south side was a parking lot for a bike path with trash cans! Free of our trash, we crossed Swatara Creek via an old steel bridge from 1890 that has been converted into a pedestrian/bike bridge. The ironwork was intricate and pretty neat to see. I looked down river and saw the biggest hornet's nest I've ever seen hanging precariously from a tree branch over the river. That thing must have been two feet in height and at least a foot across. Luckily it was way down river and therefore no threat to hikers but it was crazy looking! It was so heavy the branch was bent down towards the river surface, the tip of the nest a few inches from the water. A good flood will take it out!We entered Swatara State Park, a number of people out on such a nice weekend. At one point there is a reroute of the trail to avoid a flooded area caused by beaver dam. With the low water levels, we decided to take our chances and did the original route, log-hopping across the deep area. If the water was any higher, those logs would be underwater though. After the state park, we followed Rausch creek up to it's headwaters, many campsites along the way occupied by weekend backpackers. We ended up hiking until after dark to find an open spot but the trail was nice and flat so it wasn't too much of a nuisance. Daily steps: 54,987Elevation gain: 3350'","White Horse Mountain, PA (Mile 993.8)

It didn't last long enough to soak us so we packed up dry. There is an extreme weather warning forecasted for the area with heavy rain and thunderstorms so it was nice to be moving early. As we packed up, some white tail deer snorted at us non-stop. 'Patience! We'll be out of your way and and you can eat all the pee you want in a few minutes!' More rain came at 9:15AM but didn't last very long. We dropped down from Stoney Mountain Ridge to Clark's Valley before climbing up to Peter's Mountain Ridge, which we follow for 13 miles to the Susquehanna River. On this ridge we got hit with the lightning storm. Luckily, there was only one flash of lightning and two booms of thunder so it wasn't that violent of a storm. But the rain was torrential and we received a good soaking before it stopped half an hour later. The good part of the rainstorm was that this ridge usually has a lot of snakes, but we didn't see any today! As we inched closer to the end of the ridge, Mat called the Doyle Hotel to reserve us a room for the night; we'll be reaching town this evening and can't hike through as we must retrieve our bounce box from the post office in the morning. The Doyle is a 115-year old hotel and tavern that is an icon of the AT. No one answered Mat's phone call and that's when we realized the Doyle wasn't open on Sundays and Mondays. Scrambling, we looked at our options. We could camp prior to Duncannon but with three miles of road walking plus two miles of steep terrain rising from the river, the closest in we could camp is five miles from town, which not only will we reach at 3:30PM today (very early to stop) but will also require us to stop early tomorrow before entering the Cumberland Valley No Camping zone (a crossing of privately owned lands so hikers must stay in very specific spots). In town, there was a bunk hostel at the local outfitters but it charges $30 per person. We feel $60 is pretty steep to spend on bunk-style lodging. Plus, the website only lets reservations be made at least a day out so we can't even make reservations online; either that or they're already booked up for today. There's a church hostel or a hotel six miles up the highway. We decided to make our decision when we arrived to town.By the time we reached Clark's Ferry Shelter, the sun had come out and dried most of the plants. We stopped for a break at the shelter before dropping down to the Susquehanna River. A train engine sped past us just as we reached the railroad tracks at the bottom of the descent so we sat down, expecting to wait out a very long train. But it only took a minute to go by so we crossed the tracks and started towards the bridge. We could see Chef Boyardee a 100 yards or so ahead as we crossed the bridge. The Susquehanna River is quite large, the bridge spans over 2000ft to cross it, but wasn't that deep (we could see the bottom all the way across). On the far side, a historical plaque described the history of the river crossing here and that it was once home to the longest covered bridge, over 2000ft in length and used from 1828 to 1925 before it was replaced with concrete. After the Susquehanna bridge, we crossed the Juniata River on a smaller and older bridge, which lead us into the town of Duncannon. The trail lead us on sidewalks through neighborhoods. We walked past the church hostel but noted some non-hiker looking people going in and out so we decided to call an Uber to the hotel outside of town. But first, food! Sorrento's pizzeria was the only place open on a Sunday evening so that's where we went. After eating dinner, we called an Uber and was whisked away to Red Carpet Inn. The owner was super nice, says he gets many thru-hikers staying with him. He offered us a free ride to any of the nearby restaurants and a ride back into town in the morning for $10, which was the same price as the Uber. We scheduled a 8:00AM shuttle time and headed to our room. Once showered, we watched with smug satisfaction as a huge lightning storm rolled in. Multiple flashes lit up the dark sky and more torrential rain came down! Man I'm glad we're down here in a warm, dry hotel and not camped up on that ridge!!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Nutella - new to this thru-hike, it has become a staple for me, although it's getting harder to spread as the ambient temperature drops.

The hotel owner took us back to town, dropping us off at the post office by 8:30AM. We collected our bounce box, now ready for the cold weather clothes we've been bouncing since Lyme, NH. The postal workers were super nice and encouraged us to grab anything we wanted out of the mega awesome snack box they had. I selected some pistachios and Mat grabbed a mini bag of crackers. We made our way to the only breakfast place in town, a place that has been talked about by northbounders as a must stop: Goodies Cafe. I strolled up in anticipation of a hearty breakfast meal only to find they recently changed their hours and are closed Mondays! I let slip a frustrated tirade of curses, too angry to realize a group of young kids and their parents where waiting at the school bus stop across the street. Whoops. Still, we seem to be having very poor timing with closed cafes and hotels in Pennsylvania. We even found out the Pine Grove Furnace store, home of the classic AT Half-Gallon Ice Cream Challenge (to celebrate completing half of the trail), is only open weekends after labor day. Guess when we'll be rolling through: not during the weekend. Mat was really disappointed with that one, he was planning to partake in the challenge (to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting). Limited hours is the only real drawback of hiking southbound. Now in a terrible mood, I figured out our best bet to find some breakfast was the 7Eleven on the way out of town. Luckily this 7Eleven had an actual semi-deli inside. So we bought a couple of breakfast sandwiches made in house this morning, Mat enjoyed a hot coffee, and I got my black tea with hazelnut creamer. It's no Goodies but it'll do just fine! We finally left 7Eleven and started walking at 9:20AM. There were two hikers about 0.1 ahead of us, and two about 0.1 behind us. We walked out of town and stopped at the base of the climb to shed a layer. The hikers behind us caught up to meet us. Skip and Sky Pilgrim are from Texas and are hoping to finish their southbound hike by mid December. They let us go ahead and we bid them farewell before starting the climb. Not too bad of a climb and we reached the top fairly quickly. The trail was still rocky but flat as we followed it for a few miles before dropping off the other side. The rocks finally eased off and the trail entered rolling hay fields. Mat got stung again for the fourth time this hike; at least it was from a bee and not a painful hornet. Eventually, the trail turned due-South and dropped further down into the populated Cumberland Valley. Camping is only allowed in specified areas for the 18-mile crossing of the Cumberland Valley. The trail took on a very different feeling as we walked by houses and through farm fields. We followed the Conodoguinet River, crossing it on a bridge near Scott Farm. Someone left some sodas for hikers so we each grabbed a root beer. We reached the Carlisle Turnpike around 4:30PM and turned off trail to walk 0.2-miles to the Quality Inn. There wasn't a sidewalk on this busy street but it did have a very large shoulder so it wasn't too bad. We got ourselves a room and showered before heading over to The Middlesex Diner right next door for dinner. They had huge meals for cheap! I ordered meatloaf with veggies and Mat ordered Spaghetti with meatballs. After dinner, Mat ordered apple pie alamode and I ordered pecan pie alamode. They were tasty!

With such a comfortable hotel and a fantastic diner next door, we were tempted to spend a zero here. But the weather is ideal right now and there's supposed to be a bunch of rain this weekend (spinoff from Hurricane Ian) so it's smarter to be hiking now and zero later. We headed back over to the Middlesex Diner for breakfast. Since entering Pennsylvania, I've noticed a breakfast meal of Chipped Beef on restaurant menus, which I've never heard of before so, of course, I have to try it! Basically, it's Philly Cheese Steak style meat (without peppers or onions) smothered in country gravy poured over a stack of toast. It didn't come with eggs so I ordered a side. It was ok, definitely tasted better with fried eggs on top. But there is other stuff I would rather eat. Still, I'm glad I tried it; I would have kicked myself if I got through Pennsylvania without trying the local breakfast meal!Back to the hotel room, we relaxed until 10:00AM, then packed up and headed out just before 11:00AM. We walked the 0.2 miles back to the trail and continued our traverse of the Cumberland Valley. We chatted briefly with one local who lives right on trail. At a small, old cemetery, we caught Skip and Sky Pilgrim. We ended up hiking with them for six miles to the town of Boiling Springs, chatting away. Skip is a dive instructor and is planning to move to Thailand after the new year to teach scuba. He regaled us with tales from his dives. We reached the super cute town of Boiling Springs, PA, about 1:45PM. We bought a fuel canister from the little gear/fly fishing shop then joined Skip and Sky Pilgrim at Cafe 101, a Mexican restaurant a few yards from the trail. Chef Boyardee came strolling up and joined us, five SoBos having lunch! It was fun chatting with everyone and the food was delicious!After our late lunch, we headed out, biding Skip and Sky Pilgrim goodbye for now. O the way out of town, we passed by some of the biggest sycamore trees I've ever seen but they were surrounded by lots of trees so couldn't get a picture. The skies turned dramatic with darkened clouds punctuating the sun as we walked through the last of the farm fields and back into the forested hills, finishing our traverse of the Cumberland Valley. Some more rocks, and even some boulder scrambling, on Rocky Ridge. Mat spotted a giant hornets nest, larger than a basketball, hanging from a tree just off trail so we ran past it. It was late enough in the day and chilly so the hornets weren't out and about, luckily. As dusk gathered, we found a flat spot to pitch our tent. Chef Boyardee rolled up not too long after us. We informed him there was plenty of flat space so he pitched his tent as well. After two nights in a row of staying up late watching TV and still waking early, I'm going to sleep really well tonight!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Churro Sundae - Cafe 101 had Churro Sundae as a dessert: five churros topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup.

We started walking at 7:20AM. Within a few miles, we reached a road crossing where we cut off trail to walk 0.3 miles to Green Mountain Market. They had amazing breakfast sandwiches made to order and Mat got a hot coffee. We also grabbed a small resupply to get us through 30 miles to the next resupply. The store had all sorts of locally made foods like extra sharp cheddar, meat sticks, and pastries. Of course we bought a little bit of everything. The mini sticky buns were legit! The gals running the place this morning were super nice and let us charge our battery bricks while we ate and organized on the picnic tables outside. Chef Boyardee rolled up just as we were packing up to take off. We walked through nice forests, the weather perfect for hiking: a little bit chilly when stopped but perfect for not sweating while walking. Around noon we entered Pine Grove Furnace State Park and joined up with a nice bike path. We came upon the old iron smelter from the late 1800s, cool looking building. Near the AT museum, we stopped at some picnic tables to eat some lunch. I left to use the restroom and when I came back, Mat was surrounded by a class of 2nd graders. They were on a field trip to the State Park and had just finished going through the children's section of the AT museum. The teacher asked Mat if he'd be willing to tell the kids a little bit about our hike. They were cute and well behaved and asked great questions. It was fun! They continued on to the next part of their visit to the park and we finished our lunch. The AT museum was closed to the public (except on weekends) so we didn't get to see inside. Oh well. We walked past the store where the Half Gallon challenge takes place but, of course, it was closed as well. The Iron Master's Mansion, which has been converted into a hostel for hikers, was beyond the store and looked like it would have been a cool, historical place to stay. We spent the rest of the day in forests. At 2:15PM, we reached the AT halfway point marker. It's not our halfway point, we passed ours 500 miles ago, but it was still a cool little monument. Shortly after that, we crossed mile 1100. We hiked until 6:50PM before stopping at a flat spot on a ridge. Trailnames of the Day:Mat: 0 Gallon - Mat was sad he didn't get to do the Half-Gallon Challenge.Kalyn: 0 Museum Time - I was sad I didn't get to go inside the AT museumDaily steps: 58,206Elevation gain: 4199'","Near Rocky Ridge, PA (Mile 1077.7)

Too early!! Walking by 7:20AM, another beautiful crisp day. We deopped down to Quarry Gap Shelter, a super nice shelter designed by an architect. It was thoughtfully laid out with two smaller sleeping spaces flanking a covered picnic area between the two. There was even covered bear storage and a bench swing. It was all very nice and clean. But a local homeless guy had set up camp in one of the shelters so we didn't linger for long. We reached Hwy 30 at 9:15AM and set up to hitch into town for resupply and breakfast. We spent 30 minutes hitching and lots of cars drove by but nobody stopped. Not wanting to waste any more time, we eventually called an Uber. While we waited for the Uber to come, a red fox walked across the little access road we stood at. That was cool! The Uber dropped us off at the Flamingo restaurant where we enjoyed a large breakfast for cheap. Just as we were finishing up, Mayo walked in. He actually arrived yesterday but his cold-weather gear wasn't scheduled to arrive at the post office until today. So he's waiting for his stuff to arrive. He's planning to do the Four-State Challenge (Walk ~ 45 miles from Pennsylvania, through Maryland and West Virginia, and camp in Virginia within 24hrs) so he can catch up with his friends. After breakfast we walked the 0.3 to Dollar General for our resupply. It was the most organized DG I've ever seen but the lady was definitely not hiker friendly. We purchased our food then called for another Uber to get us back to the trailhead without messing around with hitching. Beyond the restaurant (which was good), we get the feeling this town doesn't care for AT hikers. Fortunately our Uber driver was super nice and knew exactly what we were doing, even dropping us off right in front of the trail despite the awkward parking situation. Finally done with what was supposed to be a quick in-and-out, we hit the trail. It was already 11:20AM at this point and we'd only hiked a little over four miles so far. Not exactly the best start of the day when we're trying to reach Harper's Ferry area day after tomorrow. But the weather was cool and the tread pretty nice so we booked it along. Walking was fairly uneventful but we did see a piece of snake skin shed and a White-marked Tussock moth caterpillar, which was cool looking.We reached the Pennsylvania/Maryland border, also known as the Mason-Dixon line, at 6:30PM. Eleven states done, three more to go! Afterwards, we entered the beautiful Pen Mar Park, a park high up on a ridge with nice views to the west; picnic tables, bathrooms, trash bins, and drinking fountain available. We said hi to a cute little West Highland Terrier and enjoyed a little bit of the sunset before we moved off to find a stealth spot outside the park. We found a nice spot as the skies turned from pink to black.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Mason Mat: DixonDaily steps: 50,586Elevation gain: 3376'","Big Pine Flat Ridge, PA (Mile 1104.8)

Weather reports show the remnants of Hurricane Ian hitting the Maryland Appalachia this evening instead of the early hours of tomorrow morning. At least an inch of rain is forecasted for tonight with wind gusts up to 40mph. We decided it would probably be smart to stay in a shelter tonight to keep dry. 1600 miles of the AT hiked and we are finally going to stay in a shelter. There is a shelter, actually two shelters, 25 miles from here: New Rocky Run Shelter and Old Rocky Run Shelter. That'll be our goal tonight, hopefully we'll get there before the rain starts.The hiking was unremarkable this morning, walking through forests with occasional rocky tread. Annapolis Rocks area had a lot of day hikers getting out for a jaunt before the rainy weekend. We reached Washington Monument State Park by 4:00PM. The knob has a stone structure built by locals in 1827 to celebrate 50 years of independence, dedicating it to George Washington. The tower was used as a signaling station during the Civil War. Now it's a state park. The refurbished tower offers a nice view of the surrounding area. We poked around for a bit but a wedding party was finishing up photos so we didn't linger.We dropped down to Turner's Gap, passing by a cool old stone church that reminded us of the knights templar churches we often saw on the Camino in Spain. Just beyond Turner's Gap was Dahlgren backpacker's campground, which has flushing toilets, hot showers, trash bins, and electrical outlets. Usually it's a crowded spot and we were expecting to see people there since it's Friday night. But the place was deserted. I guess people are smart enough not to camp out in this kind of weather! We were tempted to set up camp inside the bathroom; a good way to stay dry, get a shower, and charge our electronics. But that would tack on two more miles to tomorrow's hike in the rain so we decided to keep going to Rocky Run Shelter.Quickly we reached Fox Gap. I was torn: the rain was coming soon so I wanted to finish the last mile to camp, but there was lots of interpretive signs describing some historical event that happened here. I took pics of the signs to read later so we could get to camp. Mat pointed out the empty parking lot; looks like there won't been any weekend campers at the shelter ahead! Raindrops started to fall just as we turned off the AT onto the access trail. We walk up to the shelter to find two guys and a child there, drinking and smoking cigarettes. Of course, the one time we actually go to stay in a shelter it's taken over by squatters. They immediately told us to go to the old shelter 0.1 mile further; no ""hello"" or ""how you doing"", just ""the other shelter is over there."" We sat at the old shelter, trying to decide what to do. That's when we read through comments made by hikers at other shelters in the area. It seems homeless people frequent the shelters of Maryland, often threatening hikers in the middle of the night, sometimes pulling knifes or guns. Our choices were to either camp out in the rain and wind of the post tropical storm or stay in the old shelter and hope the squatters in the new shelter don't decide to come over and mess with us. We decided to sleep in the old shelter but kept our knife right next to us. I hope I never have to stay in a shelter again. Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Not a shelter fanMat: Rain racer - Racing the rain to campDaily steps: 55,000Elevation gain: 4449'","Quirauk Mountain, MD (Mile 1127.9)

Around 1:00AM, Mat woke stating he was directly under a leak. We flicked on our headlamps to find leaks all over the inside of the shelter. The only semi-dry spots was the strip I was laying in and one up against the back wall perpendicular to my feet. It would have been nice to pitch the tent inside the shelter but ours is not a freestanding tent so that wouldn't work. We cut our ground cloth in half so Mat could move to a dry area and deployed our umbrellas in strategic spots to minimize splash as well as put our pack covers on our backpacks to protect them. With the way this shelter leaks, we probably would have stayed drier if we camped in our tent. Better yet, we should have stayed at the bathroom building at Dahlgren campground; it would have added two miles to our hike into town but at least we would of slept better and stayed dry. After getting Mat to a dry area, I finally drifted off to sleep around 2:00AM.Woke at 6:30AM and waited out the heavy rainfall until a break at 7:30AM when we packed up and headed out. We walked by the new shelter, the two guy and kid were still asleep, spread out all over the inside of the shelter, an empty liquor bottle on the ground. We were on trail and on our way by 8:20AM. We climbed up onto South Mountain Ridge, the wind blowing fiercely as we gained the ridge, dragging low clouds across the trail. The the wind eased off as the day progressed and the clouds lifted just slightly higher than the ridge. Turned out to be a nice break in the storm!Just after 10:00AM, we reached Gathland State Park, a civil war historical park. There were a number of interpretive signs and old brick ruins. The War Corespondents Memorial was a cool brick structure. We continued on, following the last of South Mountain Ridge to it's end at the Potomac River. We dropped down and road walked to the Hillside Hotel where we had a reservation. We could have walked the additional 1.5 miles into Harper's Ferry today but the hotels are ridiculously expensive on weekends, like $200 per night! Alternatively, Hillside Hotel, in Maryland, was $70 for a Saturday night and is next door to a restaurant and convenience store. Perfect for us! We still want to spend time in Harper's Ferry so we did make a reservation for Sunday night (at half the price of Saturday night) which will allow us to pick up our package at the hotel, do laundry, and see the town of Harper's Ferry.As we walked across the parking lot of the hotel, we noticed four hikers across the street at the restaurant parking lot. It was Mayo, Lake, and Hunter! And a hiker we hadn't met yet named Wildstyle. We walked over to chat and catch up. They finished the Four-State Challenge yesterday and are taking a zero at the Cross Trails Hostel nearby. Always good to see those guys! We got our hotel room and spread out our gear to dry then went next door for a late lunch before coming back to the room for showers and relaxation.

We crossed the river on a pedestrian bridge and entered West Virginia. Twelve states done, two to go! The historic town of Harper's Ferry is super cute and full of little historical museums. Unfortunately, our shoes were already soaked through, making us rather cold and uncomfortable so we only stopped at one mini museum: the Lewis & Clark expedition. Apparently, Captain Lewis was sent to Harper's Ferry by President Jefferson's cabinet to obtain the expedition's supply of ammunitions since the town was home to the National Armory and Arsenal. It's funny because Mat's dad and his wife are on a RV trip following the Lewis & Clark expedition up the Columbia River in Oregon/Washington. We hit up the gear shop; Mat needed the tips of his trekking pole replaced. The owners were nice and gave us some bricks of recently expired cheese for free! We ate lunch at the Rabbit Hole Tavern, one of the few eating establishments with indoor seating. It was very tasty food! We continued on our way towards the motel. But first we stopped at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy for the traditional front-porch photo! Any hiker that comes to the conservancy gets their photo taken in front of the sign on the front porch. They've been doing it for decades and keep the photo records. A young woman named Dakota was running the show there today and was super nice. With that done, it was 2:00PM and we made our way to the hotel. We spotted a Ground Hog/Woodchuck moving around in a grassy field. It confused us at first, it looked like a small beaver or marmot. But eventually we realized what it was.

After dropping her off, we ate breakfast at a local cafe. By the time we finished, we noted the traffic became heavy with commuters so we found a parking garage and took the Metro into the city. Four years ago, we spent five days in Washington DC, hitting up pretty much all the museums, so this time we thought the Smithsonian National Zoo might be a good visit. It did not disappoint! Being a weekday with rain forecasted, the zoo was practically empty and the animals were quite active! We expected the rain to come but it never did, and we ended up enjoying the zoo until 2:00PM! The crazy thing is we saw a 10-point White Tail buck wandering around freely inside the zoo. I guess it's a safe place for a buck to live!

Luckily it wasn't a bad highway crossing; we didn't even have to run! On the south side, we entered Sky Meadows State Park and climbed up to Blue Ridge. The meadows on top were more blackberry brambles than actual meadows, but it was nice to see some open sky. In one of these meadows, we came upon a baby turtle, it's shell about the size of a silver dollar coin. It wasn't moving but it also looked unmolested. Mat picked it up and placed it off trail where it won't get stepped on. It still didn't move although it's head and legs continued to stick straight out and not droop during the transfer. I guess it could be dead, but it's shell was intact and it didn't look dried out (like it died of dehydration) and there was plenty of green vegetation around. Maybe it was warming up or sleeping? Who knows. But we did move it off the trail so it wouldn't get stepped on!The trail was nice walking the rest of the day. Later in the afternoon, we met Southbounder Trip. He was super nice and we chatted for a bit until we reached a creek just north of Manassas Gap. I halted in my stride as I spotted a baby Eastern Smooth Green Snake hanging out by the water. The three of us admired the small, pretty snake. Trip mentioned he and his friend spotted a Copperhead snake in the shelter they stayed at last night. Interesting, I thought all the snakes had gone into hibernation for the year but maybe today was warm enough to coax them out again. I would like to see a Copperhead - the last of the eastern mountainous snake I haven't seen - so I was excited to hear the snakes weren't entirely gone for the season. Although I got to see a Copperhead at the Smithsonian National Zoo the other day so I guess it's OK if I don't see one in the wild. Trip continued on as his friend was waiting for him at the road below but we stopped to collect some water then continued on ourselves.

As we sat outside the grocery store, a guy stopped and asked if we wanted a ride back up to the trail. Unfortunately, Mat still had to do his resupply so we had to turn him down; didn't want to make him wait. It was really nice of him though! Mat went in to do his resupply while I guarded the packs and reorganized. By the time Mat finished and we were set to go, it was almost time for the trolley bus that goes up to the trailhead. We walked briskly the half-mile to the nearest trolley stop. We spotted the stop and eased our pace a bit as we had six minutes before the next scheduled trolley came. But, about 100 yards from the stop, we saw the trolley coming down the road. We started running to get to the stop but the trolley drove right past the stop. It was six minutes early and it just blew right on by despite us running towards it. We were shocked. Unfortunately, the next trolley bus isn't for another two hours. We ended up calling a Lyft but the poor driver was far out of town and didn't reach us until 20 minutes later. We finally got to the trailhead at 12:30PM, having spent three hours for just a resupply and a meal. Oh well. We started the steep climb up into Shenandoah National Park, crossing the boundary around 2:30PM. The trails became nicer and we ran into more day hikers. One couple was super sweet and gave us a bunch of bars and an amazing, delicious apple when they found out we are hiking the whole trail. People are so nice! The trails quieted down as evening approached and clouds built up. We spooked a pretty 10-point buck from his resting spot right near the trail. Eventually, we came upon a nice camp spot at South Marshall Cliffs. We didn't quite have enough water so we passed it by but came upon an unmarked spring about 50 yards later. Although it would mean stopping our day earlier than normal, it would be quite a memorable place to camp in Shenandoah National Park so we grabbed water and backtracked to the campsite. After pitching our tent, we took our dinners out to the cliffs to enjoy the scenery as we ate. A cold wind blew but it was pretty. We're still about a week early for the peak tree color change. There is some color but still a majority of greenish yellow. A thru-hiker popped out of the woods behind us, stopping for a dinner. His name was Journey Man, he had hiked the trail mostly northbound except for a section from Pearisburg, VA to Great Barrington, VT. Now he's going southbound in that section so he's almost done. After he finished his meal, he packed up and continued on. We sat on the cliffs until it was too cold, then retreated to our warm sleeping bags in the gathering darkness. The temps aren't that cold but the wind is blowing strongly so it feels colder!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Trolley oath - I understand if a bus is running late it shouldn't stop to wait for people.

The wind blew strong all night, waking us a few times and keeping the ambient temperature cold. We woke cold so figured we better get moving to warm up! We were walking by 8:00AM. Soon the trail dropped to the leeward side of the ridge and we enjoyed a reprieve from the cold wind. We moved quickly to stay warm and arrived at the Elkwallow Wayside at 10:30AM. The grill wasn't open yet for the day so we bought hot cocoa packets, top ramen, and an extra fuel canister so we can enjoy hot drinks and lunches during this section. Mat also bought some frozen breakfast sandwiches he microwaved. Journey Man was there and we chatted with him some more. He took off to catch his friends at Thornton Gap while we stayed to charge our battery bricks for a bit. 
Eventually, we got to hiking again, once more trying to warm ourselves by walking. The trail was nice, alternating between sections of completely empty trail and sections with quite a few day hikers. Shenandoah National Park is one of the few national parks that allows leashed dogs on backcountry trails so we got to see lots of doggies. In the early afternoon, we reached Thornton Gap. Instead of dropping down to U.S. Route 211 to run across the highway, we stayed on Skyline Drive to use the overpass, walking into a parking area where we could get some water before rejoining the trail. There we saw Journey Man and his friends Fuego and Shower Beer. They had trailmagic: a local couple unloaded a whole picnic's worth of foods on them and took off. Chicken, Mac and cheese, rolls, soda, water, fruit, apple sauce; it was incredible! We sat and ate with them until about 4:30PM. We bade them farewell and cut back into the AT for the very popular climb up Mary's Rock. The climb wasn't too bad, although crowded. But the crowds disappeared as soon as the AT cut away from the viewpoint. The skies cleared and the wind died down as the evening wore on, although it still was cold. Around 6:00PM, we reached Pinnacle Picnic Ground. We were amazed by how many people were there picnicing in the cold evening, using the little fire pits scattered around the manicured grounds. It was very nice but no camping allowed so we filled our water bottles and continued a few more miles until the sun set. We found ourselves a flat area and pitched the tent. It's forecasted to be colder but not as windy tonight. The moon is also very bright!

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Braid skillz - I was so cold this morning I got to hiking before rebraiding my hair like I do every morning. Instead, I kept my hoods on until I warmed up enough. At this point, I just handed my trekking poles to Mat so I could french braid my hair while walking. Mat was very impressed by my skills.Mat: Crab chips - One of the items at the trail magic picnic was Chesapeake Chips with a picture of a crab on the bag. A small disclaimer in the corner stated ""No seafood in these chips"" but we still thought it was funny.

It read the same last night so maybe it's not that accurate below 40°? I'll have to test it in a freezer at the next town. In any case, we were walking by 7:30AM, immediately starting with a nice little climb to warm us up. The trail walked by some viewpoints, frost covering the shadowed ground on this side of the hill. We could see down into the Shenandoah River valley, a line of fog clouds traced the river as it wound it's way through the farm fields below. It was a pretty, albeit cold, morning. The cold kept us walking at a brisk pace and we reached Skyland Resort just before 9:00AM. Many people were milling about, all bundled up against the cold. There was a coffee stand inside so Mat got us some hot drinks and a couple microwave breakfast sandwiches. We took turns sitting inside in the warmth and sitting outside to guard the packs; there had been a few stolen packs here throughout the years. But the sun crested the hill and bathed a corner of the patio in warmth so we both enjoyed our drinks sitting in the little sunspot outside. The coffee stand was out of chai so Mat got me a Pumpkin Spice Latte. I haven't had caffeine for a number of months so it hit me pretty good and I kept a strong pace all the way to Big Meadows Lodge.We reached the lodge by 12:30PM. I was hoping to video chat with my mom to get more cold-weather gear mailed out but the reception was poor. Instead, we refilled our water bottles and continued to Big Meadows Wayside. Unfortunately, there wasn't any reception there either so we ate our lunch on a picnic table in the sun. By this time, the sun was warm, the wind stopped, and numerous tourists were sitting outside picnicing and enjoying Big Meadow. After our lunch, we continued on, doing another five miles before giving up on a video chat and settling for a phone call with mom. With that all squared away, we continued on, the sun dropping in the sky and the temps following. We filled up water at Pocosin spring before going another 0.7 mile to a dispersed campsite just as darkness gathered. Skyline Drive is nearby but went silent after the last of the tourists left their sunset watches. Once the road empties out for the night, the Shenandoah National Park backcountry gets super quiet; fairly uncommon for the AT that is always close to roads or houses or farms. A full moon rose up from the east, shining brightly while a couple Barred Owls called back and forth. Some coyotes started yipping close to the tent to voice their displeasure at our proximity. I think it's the first time we've heard coyotes on this trail! It feels slightly less colder tonight than last night.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Pumpkin Spice Latte Mat: Site Selection - Mat has done an excellent job selecting campsites that keep us out of the wind and frost.

The coyotes woke us in the middle of the night with a pack howl. I fell back asleep quickly but Mat stayed awake for a bit, causing him to sleep in this morning. A lot of people walked by our tent this morning; seven had passed by the time we hit the trail at 8:40AM. They had small packs with ultralight gear but all the gear, and their clothes, looked too new to be thru-hikers; possibly an ultralight meetup group?
It was shaping up to be another beautiful fall day. At one point we even took off all the layers and hiked in our t-shirts! We dropped down to Swift Run Gap and Hwy 33. We originally planned to stay in Elkton a night to shower, resupply, and do laundry. But we haven't been sweating due to the cooler, drier weather, and we still had a lot of food due to the many Waysides in the park. We realized we could skip Elkton and go straight into Waynesboro. So that's what we decided to do.
We continued on, climbing up and over Hightop Mountain. Around 2:30PM, we reached the next water source. It was then we realized we could probably make the Loft Mountain Wayside in six miles before their 5:00PM close time if we push a little. By getting there today, we could resupply and continue walking, bypassing the need to camp early tonight and start late tomorrow to time their 9:00AM opening. We kicked it into gear and reached the wayside at 4:30PM, crossing the 1800-mile point for us (1300 miles going southbound). The cafe workers were already wiping down tables and putting stuff away but I walked in anyway and asked if they were closed. Luckily, they said no and we were each able to order a chicken wrap. I wanted to try the legendary blackberry shakes the Park Waysides are well known for but I didn't want to make more work for them. I tipped them well for not shooing me away. Unfortunately, the resupply at this wayside was dismal: two cliff bars and some premade sandwiches & wraps in a mini-fridge was all they had. Mat grabbed the last of the cliff bars and we each picked a sandwich to pack out. Thank goodness we were able to order food from the cafe!
After eating, we made our way up to Loft Mountain Campground. The camp store had much more resupply food, plus coin-operated showers and a laundromat. Unfortunately, the store was already closed and we didn't want to wait around until it opens at 9:00AM tomorrow. Showers and laundry were available 24 hours, however, and Mat considered taking a shower. But we had only an hour until the sun set and he decided it was more important to find a campsite before dark. We hiked out of the campground, passing a prong-horned buck. After a brushy couple miles, we found a open, flat spot to pitch the tent.

As we packed up in the morning, the deer circled us like land sharks, waiting for us to leave so they could get at our salty urine. Despite pressure from the deer, we had a leisurely morning, hitting the trail before 9:00AM. Early on we reached Dundo Picnic area, where we topped up water bottles, used the pit toilets, and threw out our trash. We didn't stay long and continued on. The trees are more colorful today; I don't know if it's because we're in a different part of the park or the cold temps the last few days triggered a faster change. The colors were especially apparent from Blackrock Summit, where a large rock field allowed us to see out at the colorful hillsides. Following the summit was a series of small ups and downs as the trail followed the wooded ridge, crossing back and forth across Skyline Drive. We both felt very tired today, whether from last night's interrupted sleep, today's frequent small climbs with bigger water carries, the fact that we are on day seven of hiking since our last town stop, or a combination of the above. In any case, we struggled to make miles. But the weather was wonderful and the trees beautiful. We saw a lot of interesting critters today. Early in the day, we came upon a very large toad sitting in the middle of the trail with it's eyes closed. It was the size of a baseball and was waiting to warm up; possibly a Fowler's Toad? Midday, we came upon a garter snake (apparently I stepped right over it!). Then, in the afternoon, we came upon a Copperhead Snake. It wasn't very big, but it was right on trail and wasn't moving. We walked backwards a few steps to give it some space to feel safe to move off trail but it wasn't going anywhere! The surrounding brush was too dense for us to step off trail so, eventually, Mat found a five-foot branch to move the snake with. First, he just touched the snake with the stick but it did nothing. Then he used the stick to push the snake to the side. The snake just stayed in its coiled position but didn't not attack the stick. We figured it must be too cold to do anything but it was still too close to the trail for our comfort to pass. Third time was the charm as Mat was able to pick up the snake with the branch. Draped over the stick, it still didn't move until Mat transferred it to a sunny spot well away from the trail. Then it dropped itself onto the forest floor and slithered away. It was a pretty snake and I was happy to enjoy a non-eventful copperhead encounter in the wild. I was also happy Mat got it out of our way! Later, when we had cell reception, we looked up Copperheads and learned their defense mechanism is to stay motionless rather than flee since their camouflage is so good. We definitely experienced that; when we backtracked, we couldn't spot the snake anymore and had to come back towards it a few steps before we spotted it again!Late in the day, we turned onto the side trail to Calf Mountain Shelter to collect some water for the night from a spring. As we headed back to the trail, we met Root, a southbounder from South Africa. He's going into town tomorrow so maybe we'll see him then. We continued on, looking to get a few more miles in with the hour or so of daylight left. We summited Little Calf Mountain and enjoyed a nice evening view. We dropped down and climbed back up Bear Den Mountain, where we found an excellent dispersed campsite as the sun set, turning the high wispy clouds to the west into a peachy pink color. We're four miles from Interstate 64 and we could hear the cars below. Since it is such a short distance to the trailhead tomorrow, we considered hiking to the next trail access 7.5 miles beyond and hitching into town from there. But looking over our food tonight, we realized we only have enough food for the morning. With the waysides and cafes of Shenandoah National Park, we were able to skip hitching down into Elkton for a resupply, going 46 miles further than we expected. But we hit the last of these amenities last night and ate the rest of our carried food today. We have a few bars to eat for breakfast in the morning but not enough food to get us 12 miles with a 2000ft climb.

With less than five miles to town, we took our time this morning. Someone hiked past our camp around 8:00AM, probably Root, and we started hiking at 9:00AM. We quickly reached McCormick Gap where we met Ridge Runner Rana and his friend Trail Fox. They gave us each a banana (fruit, yummy!!!!) and we chatted for a bit. We thanked them for the treat and continued on, surprised by the steepness of the climb south of the Gap. The last few miles of trail were rocky so it made for rather slow going compared to the nicely graded trail further within the national park. We popped out of the forest at Rockfish Gap, officially done with Shenandoah National Park. That park had the best trail engineering of the entire AT! We walked down past the Interstate 64 interchange to increase our chances of hitching a ride with someone going directly into Waynesboro. It took about 20 mins but a woman named Kristen stopped for us. Her husband had spent the last 20 years section hiking the AT and completed the whole trail with a New Jersey section hike this summer. She was super nice and dropped us off at the Quality Inn where we had reservations and a package. It was only 11:30AM, too early to check in, but the desk attendant let us leave our packs in the lobby so we could run errands.
First up was to check in at the post office. With the much colder weather, we had my mom send out more cold-weather gear. She sent it UPS thinking it was going to our hotel instead of the post office. Historically, we've had packages returned because UPS won't deliver packages to post offices (or post offices won't accept them). When I asked the postal worker, she said they do accept and receive UPS packages but today's delivery hadn't arrived yet. Relieved that it will actually be delivered, we wandered out to find lunch. We realized the AT fabled Ming's All You Can Eat Chinese buffet was right behind the post office so that's where we went for lunch. It was tasty! Definitely can't eat as much as we used to when we were younger but it was still fun to eat all sorts of different foods! After lunch, the UPS tracking stated our package was delivered to the post office so we grabbed it and headed back to the motel to leave it with our backpacks. We still had an hour until check-in so we headed over to Walmart to resupply. It was 2:00PM by the time we finished and were allowed to check in to our room. Mat got his new socks from the office, then we proceeded to do laundry and shower. Although it's been a week since our last shower, and 10 days since our last laundry, we didn't feel particularly gross since the cooler weather and more level trail kept us from sweating too much. Dinner was pizza from across the street. We ate while watching the latest two episodes of Andor and the latest episode of Rings of Power.

We originally planned it because we didn't want to miss the package of our cold weather gear but it arrived yesterday so we spent the day relaxing and planning our trail departure. We set up a rough itinerary for when we'll reach the Grayson Highlands, then bought plane tickets home a few days after that; nice to have a little time buffer in case another big storm rolls through. I can't believe we're so close to finishing up the Appalachian Trail and our triple crown! 
Around noon, we set out to see if we could find a fuel canister. ACE hardware next to the hotel only had the larger 12oz cans. We walked over to Stanimals hostel but they didn't have any for sale and the ones in the hiker box were practically empty. We headed back to the hotel without a new fuel canister, but not before hitting up Klines Dairy Bar. Klines makes their own ice cream and offer all sorts of different menu items like sundaes, milkshakes, frosties, etc. Mat teased me saying it was my kind of bar, the kind where it's not considered weird to order a glass of milk! We made up different scenarios of me in a Dairy 'BAR'. I told Mat that my dairy bar is more like a club and I would get preferred entry while the bouncer would make him wait outside in line! We spent the rest of the day relaxing and catching up on chores. Dinner was burgers from Front Street Grill; they were really good, tying with Port Clinton, PA for best on trail!

Woke up and got to packing. At 9:00AM, we walked down to the post office to mail some stuff home then walked to the edge of town to hitch. Within 20 mins we were picked up by a young lady who helps out at the local hiker hostel. We got to play with the sweet young pup she was dog sitting as she drove us back up to Rockfish Gap. We were hiking by 10:15AM. Our packs were very heavy. We were considering going 102 miles to Middle Creek Campground, a private campground about 1.5 miles off trail which can be blue blazed (depart from the AT at one spot and rejoin the AT at another spot so there is no need to backtrack). The campground is supposed to have a decent resupply and even a nice grill during high season. But it is now shoulder season and services and hours are limited. I called them from Waynesboro to see if they'll be open when we come through. No one answered so I called again at a different time. Still no answer so I left a message to have them call me back. We never did hear from them so we decided to not rely on the resupply spot and just push through to Daleville. It's 132 miles from Rockfish Gap to Daleville so we had a lot of food in our packs, making them much heavier than we normally carry. In fact, I think it's our heaviest carry of the trail. Heavier than the 100-mile wilderness for a few reasons: 1) that section was a total of 115 miles vs this section is 132 miles; 2) that section was warmer vs this section we're carrying heavier cold-weather gear; and 3) that section we didn't have to consider hiker hunger vs now we eat more food every day. But at least the weather was cool and lovely, the trees really putting on a display. We stopped for lunch at the very nice Paul Wolfe Shelter, nestled in a copse of yellow trees next to an idyllic creek. After lunch was the climb up Humpback Mountain, where the AT intersects a popular trail to Humpback Rocks viewpoint. Since it was a gorgeous Friday, there were quite a few day hikers on trail but it wasn't long before we reached the turn off and the trail grew quiet again. We enjoyed some lovely ridge walking with multiple views. It was hard to keep an eye out for snakes along the rocky ridgeline while also enjoying the views! Looking out over the valleys below, we could see farms with large patches of green fields hedged by multicolored forests. We followed the ridge towards Three Ridges Mountain. At the Trailhead parking lot, we noticed a ton of cars. Considering it's a lovely Friday evening, we figured there will be a lot of people camping at the upcoming campsite and shelter. We climbed until we came upon the first campsite. Luckily it was empty. We figured we better set up here as it was highly likely anything further along will be occupied. The sun set as we pitched our tent on the ridge. We can see many stars tonight.

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: Squirrel Miscalculation - while hiking on trail, a squirrel made a dash for safety as we approached. It grossly miscalculated its escape route, first running directly towards us, then climbing a very small, short tree right next to the trail beside us. It peaked it's head around the tree to see us right there. I think it really panicked then, looking to jump over my head and across the trail to a bigger tree but it was short a few feet, landing roughly on the ground instead, then running off. All this happened right in front of me! I think it was a young squirrel.Mat:

Within 30 mins, we reached the intersection with the Mau-Har trail, an alternate that follows along a pretty creek (versus staying on the AT to climb up Three Ridge Mountain). Going southbound, we've hiked on a lot of ridges with scenic viewpoints in the last few weeks but it's been a long while since we've hiked beside a pretty stream so we decided to take the alternate. It was a lovely trail. The trees of the narrow creek valley had turned yellow, carpeting the ground and lining the creek's small cascades in gold. It made me wish I had my heavy, fancy camera to take nicer shots! The trail then climbed up out of the creek bed and rejoin the AT before dropping down to the Tye River and VA Route 56. Next was the 3000+ft climb straight up Priest Mountain. We stopped for lunch at Cripple Creek, and it took us another hour or so to reach the top. After that big climb, the trail followed along the mountain tops, comprising a series of smaller climbs and descents. With a heavy pack, the climbs slowed me down considerably. Spy Rocks trail had quite a few day hikers but the trail became quiet again after we passed the viewpoint.Porter's Gap campground was really nice: flat open forest with a spring and nobody around! But, it was too early to camp so we continued on. I felt pretty exhausted from all the climbing today so we decided to throw in the towel a bit early at Lovingston Spring trail junction. We also didn't want to go another mile or two and end up at one of the multiple forest service roads just ahead; likely to find weekend campers at these roads. We pitched our tent in a relatively flat spot, then ate a cold dinner of lunch foods to ensure we have enough dinners to get us into Daleville. Tomorrow night is forecasted to be rain with lightening storms. Unfortunately, 20 miles from here we start a six-mile ridgewalk; not a place we went to be camping during a lightning storm!

Our que to exit! We passed by the two forest service roads, surprised to find no one car camping. We climbed up to Tar Jacket Ridge, which had some really nice views. From there, we dropped down to Hog Camp Gap, which had many weekend car campers. But everyone seemed quiet and respectful. We climbed up from the Gap, reaching the top of Cole Mountain. The top consisted of open, grassy fields and the views were superb. But there were quite a few people around so we continued on to Bald Knob (which, ironically, is forested and therefore has no views) before stopping for a break. Off of Bald Knob was a long, 3000+ft descent down to Brown Mountain Creek. The creek was situated in a pleasant narrow valley comprised of open forests. A historical sign provided an explanation for the occasional stonework foundations: Brown Mountain Creek was home to a small settlement of freed slaves. In the 1920's, the land was bought by the forest service. Around 1:00PM, we reached Brown Mountain Creek Shelter and stopped to use the privy. On the outside of the building, I noticed a peculiar piece of spiderweb hanging from the outer wall that looked like artwork. The web silk was in the shape of an upside cone. Long, horizontal pine needles gave it structure, like the hoop skirt cage of a Victorian-era woman's dress. Little bits and pieces of leaves and debris adorned the cone at pertinent points and a plume of three leaves sprouted from the top of the cone tip. It was so intricate and alluring. Mat figured out it was a wall of web that disconnected from one side and curled back onto itself, the long horizontal pine needles preventing it from collapsing on itself and producing the cone shape. It was so interesting; cool spider artwork! I tried to get a picture of the but the 2D photo doesn't do the 3D shape any justice.After leaving the shelter, the skies turned very dark, almost like evening. Rain started at 1:45PM, hours earlier than predicted by our weather apps. The shower lasted about 45 mins. At a stream crossing, we stopped to collect water. We had gone 0.3 miles beyond it before Mat realized he left his trekking poles at a creek and had to backtrack to get them. The trail contoured above Lynchburg Reservoir. We didn't have a clear view of the water but we could glimpse the colorful trees on the far side of the reservoir, reflected on the water surface. Rain started to fall again as we crossed Pedlar River via a suspension bridge. As we climbed up Rice Mountain, a flash of lightning lit up the sky and a couple thunder claps boomed. We decided not to follow the trail on the ridgeline above, opting instead to drop down to a forest service road paralleling the trail down by the creek. Eventually the rain stopped. We reached the top of the hill where the road crosses the trail again. From here the trail continues to climb up 1200ft towards Bluff Mountain followed by the long prominent ridge of Big Rocky Row. We did not want to be camped up there tonight with the forecast of more lightning storms on the way. Instead we set up camp for the night, even though it was only 4:45PM. A rain cloud let loose as we set up the tent. It rained heavily the rest of the evening and we could see and hear some distant lightning. The rest of the week is forecasted to be clear, although colder. Hopefully we can get an early start on the day tomorrow to make up for our early camp today.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Spider ArtMat: Wear dry - When Mat's clothes get wet, from either sweat or rain, he likes to wear them inside the tent until they dry.

It rained heavily the first half of the night. We heard thunder and saw a few flashes of lightning but they were far from our location so we felt safe and slept well. The storm passed by early morning. When we woke for the day, it was clear out. We started hiking before 7:30AM; it's hard to get moving too quickly when it's dark out! We climbed up towards Punchbowl Mountain while the sun crested above the lowlands. We could see through the trees a layer of thick clouds covering everything below. It made for a gorgeous morning as we climbed. We rejoiced at the trash receptacle where the trail crosses the Blue Ridge Parkway, getting rid of probably a pound's worth of trash from the last three days.
We climbed up to Bluff Mountain, finishing our first 1000+ft climb of the day. The top was in and out of fog so we didn't stay long. We dropped onto Big Rocky Run Ridge and enjoyed some nice contouring, passing a small pack of northbound flip-floppers finishing their trail in Harper's Ferry. It was on this ridge that we passed southbound mile 1400, which means we're at mile 1900! We stopped for a break at Big Rocky Run peak, looking out over the James River valley below. Time to drop down 2000ft! We descended, dropping back into the elevation with the most colorful trees; too high up and the leaves are already dropped, too low and the trees are still mostly green. 
The last mile following Big Rocky Run creek was extremely scenic: the fall trees gave the little gorge a golden hue and the water dropped along a rock bed with diagonal striations. We were surprised there weren't a ton of people here! We popped out onto U.S. Route 501 and crossed the James River on a long pedestrian bridge. We followed the river's edge for a mile before entering James River Face Wilderness and ascending Matt's creek, another cute creek but much smaller than the last. We climbed just about 2000ft from the James River before the trail leveled off into fantastic contouring just below the ridges. The colors were in their prime, turning the mid-distance hills rainbow with blotches of red, orange, yellow, and green. We enjoyed lovely walking, very much a highlight! But flat trail never lasts and eventually we started a series of climbs to gain Thunder Ridge. 
We reached Thunder Ridge Overlook as the sun set. It was gorgeous. There we met Mishap and Amethyst, a couple who are vlogging their southbound hike. Amethyst hurt her foot and tapped out in Vermont but has been supporting Mishap with their truck, both of them sleeping in the back, a cap on the truck bed, on a nifty homemade bed platform with storage underneath. They saved our hides! Their YouTube viewers donated money to them, which they used to buy food to give to other hikers they meet. We're a little light on food to get all the way to Daleville but with the snacks they gave us, we now have enough food to get us into town! They were super nice and it was fun to meet another couple our age. Their YouTube channel is Mishap & Amethyst Hikes. We'll have to check it out. 
Now we needed to find a place to camp! With the cold wind blowing hard, we moved fast to stay warm. Unfortunately, we couldn't find a place before darkness gathered so we busted out the headlamps until we found a slightly slanted place between two rocks that made do. The wind really picked up; it's going to be noisy tonight from the wind blowing the trees above us but we are fairly protected from direct wind buffeting the tent.

Trailnames of the Day:
Kalyn: James River Face - I really enjoyed this wilderness.Mat: Sock failure - Mat was wearing a new pair of the Dry Max socks we like so much. His previous pair lasted thousands of miles. However, one sock of his brand new pair, only the second day of wearing them, developed a half dozen dime-sized holes throughout the sock. We were baffled by so many holes in a brand new sock when the previous pair lasted so long. Must be a manufacturing defect.

Gusts of wind are in the upper 20's, which brings the wind chill down to 8°F! (Thanks windchill graph on back of thermometer I originally thought was useless!) Man I'm glad we got more cold-weather gear and that it was delivered without issue in Waynesboro! Don't get me wrong: with the right gear, I much prefer dry cold to humid heat!We started walking at 7:40AM, coming upon The Guillotine. An AT landmark, The Guillotine is a boulder, approximately one meter-square in size, wedged high between two shed-sized rock outcroppings. The trail goes right between the outcroppings under the wedged boulder. The boulder has been there a long time, but it doesn't appear to be super solidly wedged and it's unnerving to walk under! Beyond The Guillotine, we summited Apple Orchard Mountain, the tallest peak of Central Virginia AT. But it was very windy and cold so we didn't linger long. In fact, it was so cold, we came upon a frozen flying squirrel on trail during our descent. (It was totally intact, it appears to have frozen to death clinging to a branch up in the trees where the wind was probably stronger and colder, then fell to the ground. The tail was very interesting to look at, similar in appearance to a feather.) It was so cold this morning, we wore all our clothes and didn't shed a layer for two hours, even with the climbs! In a sunny spot sheltered for the wind, we stopped for a break. Mishap passed us by, going fast and light since he doesn't have to carry any gear. The rest of the day consisted of non-descript hiking in fall-colored forests. We stopped under the bridge at Jennings Creek for a late lunch before climbing up Cove Mountain Ridge. The ridge was very scenic, looking out over the James River valley below. The wind blew fierce and cold, though. As the sun set, we intersected the Blue Ridge Parkway. The Blue Ridge Parkway is a tourist road, beautifully paved, that runs along the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains for 469 miles from Smokey Mountains National Park to Shenandoah National Park. It's curvy and doesn't lead to anywhere populated, just a nice drive for tourists. But that means, at night, there are no cars on the road. The trail parallels a few yards from the road for 6.3 miles so we just night hiked the road. We love night hiking: not only does it provide opportunities to see nocturnal animals, night hiking also allows for a different perspective of the environment and our place in it. (Additionally, night hiking is a nice way to beat the heat on hot western trails!) Night hiking on the AT is very hard to do: the forests make it exceptionally dark, there are many rocks and roots to trip over, and it's quite difficult to find a dispersed campsite in the dark, requiring hikers to roll into, and set up camp at, a shelter or official campground after dark when everyone else is asleep. But on the smooth Blue Ridge Parkway we could walk without our headlamps on (we flicked them on only when late tourist cars drove by). A smattering of house lights in the dark valleys below mirrored the stars in the moonless sky above. The Big Dipper was out and, since we were 1500ft above the lights, we could even see the Milky Way! We hiked until after 8:00PM, enjoying the peaceful darkness and night views of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Eventually, we cut back over to the trail to a dispersed campsite somewhat protected from the cold wind. A very memorable night on the AT! Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Cold Hazmat - With all my clothes on, including my rain gloves, I looked like I was wearing a haz mat suit!Mat: Mocha frapp - We weren't sure if we had extra fuel for hot drinks this morning so Mat made his mocha with the slushy water in his water bottle this morning.

We didn't hit the trail until 9:00AM. Still windy, the temperature was 10° warmer this morning than yesterday morning, although we're 1500ft lower in elevation as well. We enjoyed nice walking through colorful forests. We met Professor, a local trail angel who was out for a nice day hike. Mishap passed by us again at Fullhardt Knob Shelter, having been dropped off at Bearwallow Gap to hike into Daleville today. We reached Daleville at 2:45PM. We checked into our hotel room at the Super 8 Hotel. The room was really nice, and for a good price, too! We were starving so went to the Pancho Mexican restaurant in the hotel parking lot. As we sat and ate, we discussed our options. We are ahead of schedule and have done some big miles so we would like to take a zero. At first, we thought of just spending one night here and hiking back out tomorrow so we could get through the touristy 'Virginia Triple Crown' (scenic viewpoints of Tinker Cliffs, McAfee Knob, and Dragon's Tooth) before the weekend, then take a zero at one of the towns afterwards. But we realized the hotels coming up aren't as nice as this one, especially for the price! So we decided to take our zero here, walk the majority of the touristy area on Friday (hopefully it won't be too crowded), and not do a zero in a dingier hotel room later on. After our late lunch, we went back to the hotel for laundry and showers. When dinner time rolled around, we went back to the Mexican place for half-off margarita Wednesday! Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Trash pick - My trekking poles gathered dead leaves on the tips as I walked, sometimes collecting a whole pile of dead leaves.

Next was an early lunch at my favorite southern fast food joint: Bojangles! After that, we hit up the grocery store for our next 90-mile section to Pearisburg, VA. With all that done, we decided to get a dinner from Bojangles to bring back to the hotel for later tonight. Apparently I ordered a Big Bo Box: 8 pieces of fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, and a half-gallon of sweet tea, all in a handy, but large, carry box. Mat starting laughing when I exited the restaurant carrying a box half my size! There were drink cups and cutlery sets for four people, but not a problem for two thru-hikers! Even the hotel receptionist laughed at us tromping in with our giant box of Bojangles! We spent the rest of the day relaxing and catching up on chores. A resident woodchuck living life in the lawn outside our window provided entertainment for us throughout the day. And yes, we ate the whole Big Bo Box over two meals between the two of us!

The sun was shining and the air still. We enjoyed the many viewpoints from the ridge while walking through colorful forests. We stopped at Lamberts Meadow campsite to get some water; it was a very nice, open campground. From there we climbed up towards Tinker Cliffs. A large tree fell somewhere nearby; we didn't see it but it made a huge crashing noise! We crested out on Tinker Cliffs, a granite ledge that drops about 50ft but overlooks the Catabaw valley 1500ft below. We spotted a pair of turkey vultures perched together enjoying the view. We rounded the ridge another five miles before climbing McAfee Knob. The knob has a rock overhang at the top with nice views looking out over the Catawba valley. Besides the Mount Katahdin and Springer Mountain terminals, it is the most photographed point of the AT. It's also very popular for day hikers. In fact, when we arrived at 5:20PM, a handful of people were milling about on the top, a few of them sitting on the overhang eating food. We waited a minute and they eventually moved so we could get a photo on the overhang. After we got our photo, eight more people showed up. We decided to keep hiking to get to a designated campsite before dark. (Due to the popularity of this area, no camping is allowed on 26 miles of the AT except for at designated shelters and campgrounds.) On our decent, we passed an additional 20 or so people on their way up! We reached Catawba Mountain Shelter to get some water. Two tents were set up and one person was in the shelter. We continued the additional mile to get to John's Spring Shelter, which was completely empty. We searched around to find a flat spot big enough to accommodate our two-person tent; there weren't a ton of tent sites at this shelter and the obvious ones were either slanted or could accommodate only a single tent. But we found one that wasn't too slanted.

At 11:30PM last night, four guys hiked into the shelter, talking loudly, shining their bright headlamps everywhere. We heard them spot our tent but they didn't change their behavior. Mat asked them to quiet down and be mindful of their headlamps, but it didn't help. They started a fire, smoked cigarettes, and talked until 2:30AM. Seriously, every time we try to stay at a shelter we deeply regret it. There's no camping in this area except at designated sites but we should have just stealth camped out of site from the trail.
Day hikers started walking by at 5:00AM to catch the sunrise from McAfee Knob. We didn't get to stirring until after 7:00AM, hitting the trail sometime after 8:00AM while our inconsiderate campmates still slept. We passed by a steady stream of more dayhikers. The parking lot was packed and a temporary electric construction sign advertised a McAfee Knob hiker shuttle from a Park&Ride somewhere 7A-7P. I don't know where this Park&Ride is located or if the shuttle runs during the weekdays but maybe hikers can take it to a restaurant or something. The trail was completely quiet on the opposite side of the parking lot for the six miles to Dragon's Tooth trail junction. We came upon Professor again, this time going south. He has 30 miles left of his section and then he's completed the whole AT via section hikes.
When we joined the Dragons Tooth Trail, the hoards of day hikers reappeared. One lady lost her dog, it kept running further up trail in the opposite direction whenever someone tried to grab it. Eventually, a day hiker coming down with his own dog was able to pick up the runaway and carry it back to it's owner. The trail turned into a fun rock scramble. On one of the rocks, I stepped right over a small copperhead without even realizing it. Mat saw it move after I stepped over it! We reached Dragons Tooth at 12:40PM. It was overrun with college students and day hikers so we snapped a few pics and continued on, the AT turning quiet again after leaving the dayhikers trail. In fact, we saw only two other people the rest of the day! The terrain turned dry with many rocks and pine trees. It reminded us of the California foothills. 
We dropped down to cross VA Route 620, then had a very long climb up Brush Mountain. I felt very slow today. It may be the interrupted sleep last night; or it may be the fact that the trail is now on a westward trajectory going across the grain of multiple 1500ft ridges for the next 50 miles, not exactly a motivation booster. But once we reached the top of Brush Mountain, we had nice, flat trail for about a mile. Here we crossed sobo mile 1500, putting us at 2000 miles completed! Less than 200 miles to go! After our one mile of ridge walking, we dropped back down to Craig Creek as the sun set, the golden hour lighting up the colorful trees. We found a flat spot to pitch our tent as darkness gathered. An owl hooted, we think it might be a Long Eared Owl. Exhausted, we passed out well before 9:00PM.

Despite Mat's alarm going off at 6:45AM, we didn't hit the trail until 8:30AM. It's hard to get moving when it's dark, especially in a cold narrow canyon like the one we camped in. The trail moved through open forests in the Craigs Creek Valley. We appreciated the many white blazes through here as the entire open ground is blanketed in a thick layer of freshly fallen leaves, obscuring the trail completely in some places. After crossing the large creek on a nice trail bridge, we climbed up to Niday shelter, where we stopped for water and the privy. We continued the climb up to the top of Sinking Creek Ridge, which is also the Eastern Continental Divide: water on the east side of the ridge flows into the Atlantic while water on the west side flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Although nice to be up high, the trail followed directly on the rocky ridge top, making for slow going as we picked our way along unlevel trail with boulders and slippery dried leaves. We came upon southbounder Migrator having a break. Migrator confirmed we were the only hikers seen this section. It's definitely quiet out here, I didn't realize the AT could be so empty!After the long ridge, we dropped down towards Sinking Creek, passing the massive Keffer Oak along the way, which is the largest oak tree along the southern AT. Like the Dover Oak in New York, the Keffer Oak is about 300 years old. The Keffer Oak appeared taller than the Dover Oak, but the Dover Oak had longer branches and appeared wider. I wonder how much all that wood weighs? We stopped for a break at a small creek just before crossing VA Route 630. We pulled out our tent and sleeping bags to dry the moderate amount of condensation from last night. After our late lunch, we climbed up and over an intermediary hill before starting the long climb up Kelly Knob, followed by an equally long descent to John's Creek. Although a little on the early side, we decided to camp next to John's Creek. From here, it's only a mile of relatively flat terrain before the trail makes a steep climb to Salt Pond Mountain over two miles. We weren't sure how brushy the next mile is so we set up camp slightly earlier than usual in the guaranteed open flat spots. We fell asleep to the sounds of crickets, the creek, and some coyotes howling in the distance.  Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Breakfast Equilibrium - I don't care for oatmeal and I don't care for peanut butter.

When we packed up in the morning, we found small holes in the floor of the tent. Investigating what caused such destruction, we found a metal tent stake stuck in the ground, the head broken off so the jagged end barely stuck up from the dirt. I tried to dig it out with one of our larger tent stakes but it wouldn't budge so we put a rock over it as a warning to future campers. Luckily, we were camped near a creek so Mat was able to submerge his inflated sleeping pad to find the location of the air leak. He highlighted the spot with a marker so he can patch it later in the day after his sleeping pad dries. After all that hubbub, we got to walking at 8:30AM.We had nice hiking in the morning. Although starting with a 2000ft climb up Salt Pond Mountain, the grade and trail were nice, and a water source near the top negated us from having to carry water weight. Even when we traversed over to Potts Mountain Ridge, the trail was smooth and even. It made for nice walking. We stopped for first break at Wind Rock Viewpoint. The trees are now past their prime fall colors and the viewpoint revealed many bare branches throughout the forest below. After break, we left Mountain Lake Wilderness (why is it called Mountain Lake Wilderness, there is no lake!) and crossed Mountain Lake Road. The trail changed for the worse: the path was narrower with encroaching brush and grass, there were multiple unnecessary elevation changes, and many uneven rocks partially hidden by the thick blanket of freshly fallen, slippery leaves. Our pace slowed considerably navigating the obstacles. The trail improved slightly after we dropped down and neared Big Stony Creek. The valley bottom was covered in a dense rhododendron forest, which kept us pretty cool as temps were in the mid 70s and no breeze reached the narrow valley floor. I was hoping the trail would be easier following the creek for a few miles but, instead, it climbed and dropped multiple short, steep pitches until it ultimately left Big Stony Creek for the climb up to Peter's Mountain Ridge and the Virginia/West Virginia border. The climb actually consisted of very nice trail and we completed the ascent in no time despite carrying full water capacity for a 10-mile dry stretch plus camp. On the ridge, the path started nicely graded but eventually deteriorated into a rocky jumble of trail; the kind that, like earlier in the day, one can't take their eyes off if they don't want to fall. Which was a shame because, to the northwest, the ridge fell away steeply to reveal pretty farm fields framed by trees still in their prime colors far below in West Virginia. But we had to pay more attention to our feet than the view. We reached the last marked dispersed campsite just after 6:00PM. Looking at the map, the ridge becomes narrower, and already it's too brushy and rocky to find our own spot. We could push another 1.3 miles to get to Symm's Gap, where apparently one can camp, but nobody mentions how large the area is. One thing about the AT, it's hard to pass up a guaranteed camp site in hopes of getting more mileage done, especially when finding space for a two-person tent! So we decided to camp here for the night even though it's still early in the evening. We looked at our mileage: how is it we feel so worn out and yet we hadn't even hiked 20 miles?! Probably the terrible trail tread today. We fell asleep to the wind blowing in the trees and the constant hum of a factory in town below (apparently a cigarette filter maker). Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn:Mat: Tent stake - it caused such destruction to poor Mat's gear. Daily steps: 40,728Elevation gain: 4783'","Johns Creek, VA (Mile 1522.9)

Even though it was 48°F with a constant breeze this morning, we didn't feel cold. It's amazing how quickly our bodies adapt to colder weather! 8:25AM start this morning. The trail was a bit rocky first off but improved as we made our way along the ridge. Prior comments made on the Farout App described free range goats living on this ridge, shaking down hikers. Unfortunately, we never saw them but we saw their scat! Just before arriving at Rice Field Shelter, the forests gave way to open fields and we could see out to the horizons. We spotted a bobcat kitten climb down from a rock pile about 100 yards before the shelter! The trail was really nicely graded all the way down to town. We reached the trailhead at VA Route 100 by 2:00PM. We were planning to walk the 0.8-miles into town, sticking our thumb out at passing cars but Amythest was parked at the trailhead and offered us a ride! She dropped us off at Hardee's and we inhaled a large, late lunch. We walked over to the Plaza Motel to get a room but they had no vacancy! So we called the hostel in town. Luckily they have private rooms available in addition to bunks. We walked to Food Lion for resupply then Mat quickly walked to the mercantile to buy a new fuel canister.
We made our way to the hostel via a blue blazed trail behind the food lion and were pleasantly surprised. The private rooms were in a nice little house, very clean and well kept. A bonus was we were the only ones in the house. Other people were in the tenting area or the bunk room but we had the house to ourselves! Shower and laundry done, we decided to cook dinner in the kitchen. We hadn't bought anything to cook but we found some pasta noodles, olive oil, freeze-dried minced onion, and tons of spices so Mat cooked up a lovely meal. I met Doc Peppa, the proprietor of the hostel; she was nice. Our room was spaceous and the bed comfortable, the bathroom was super clean and very well stocked. I believe it was a nicer place than the hotel would have been! We discussed post-trail employment, and even talked with our recruiter as we made dinner. After dinner was a movie then bed. This last section from Daleville was surprisingly difficult and draining, hopefully the next section will flow smoother.

Mat gave me the normal fork for our pasta dinner. It was funny watching him eat with a serving fork as we talked about having to relearn manners when we reenter the post-trail world.

We had a relaxing morning, drinking coffee/tea in bed, the little electric false fireplace heater (in our room!) going. This hostel advertises itself as a 'zerolicious vortex zone' and man did we feel the vortex. We almost stayed for a zero since the house was so comfortable but we've been taking zeros in almost every town now and we should keep rolling. The hostel stay included a free shuttle to the trailhead, which we scheduled for 10:30AM. We were back on trail before 11:00AM, climbing up Pearis Mountain. The trail was in excellent shape, the grade very manageable, and the temps cool so the climb wasn't bad. At one point, a small downed powerline crossed the trail. I was able to duck underneath it no problem but Mat, being a little taller, really had to maneuver to get under without touching it. Apparently it's been down for three weeks so I can't imagine it's still live, but disconcerting nonetheless! Around noon we finished the 2200+ft climb and enjoyed descent ridge walking. The dense overcast above parted exactly over the valley, lighting up the green pastures below with red/orange forests surrounding them. It was very pretty lighting. We stopped for a late lunch at a large power line so we could enjoy the scenery and lighting. The trail was quite nice the rest of the day, a little rock-hoppy at times but nothing like the previous section. The real crazy part is we didn't see another person once we started hiking today; no thru-hikers, no section-hikers, not even any day hikers! Nobody! Pretty amazing. I didn't think that was a possibility: a perfectly nice day on the AT and coming across nobody. We saw a couple cars parked at road crossings but never saw a soul. There was some pretty views from the top of Sugar Run Mountain as the sun sank in the sky. Shafts of slanted light burst through partings in the clouds, highlighting different parts of the hills below, clad in the last of the red and orange trees. It was very dramatic lighting but a cold wind had picked up so we didn't stay at the viewpoint for long. We decided to follow the trail down off the ridge to find a sheltered place to camp.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Resupply dupped - I looked at resupply points for the next section and saw a deli market a day and a half in, but a half-mile off trail. I didn't think Mat would go for an off-trail mile, passing it up for the market that is on trail in two and a half days. However, while resupplying, he said he wanted to hit both markets to keep our food weight low and score some deli food. So we bought enough food for one day out. Sure enough, this evening on trail, Mat was like, ""Eh, it's a half mile off trail, we could just go straight through to the next market."" Bah! I knew that would be what he eventually ends up doing but I was dupped into a false belief of the opposite. I knew better!Mat: Electric Limbo - Mat does Limbo under the downed powerline Daily steps: 38,354Elevation gain: 4390'","Pearisburg, VA via VA Route 100 (Mile 1556.1)

We're in the new/waxing moon cycle so we don't even have the moon size or location to give us a clue. We've done winter backpacking trips but usually for a few days at a fire tower or cabin; this is the first time we've been on a thu-hike this late in the season and it's definitely annoying to have so much darkness in the day! We started walking just after 8:00AM, quickly dropping down to Wapiti Shelter to use the privy. The trail follows Dismal Creek through dense rhodedendron forests. The creek itself is very pretty, I don't know why it's called Dismal! And the walking was fantastic, wonderful tread! We reached the trail junction for a side trail to Dismal Falls. Looking at the topo maps, we realized we could blue blaze from the falls to Trent's Market and Grill, saving us a mile of out-and-back, off-trail walking, plus the advantage of seeing the waterfall. We walked down to Dismal Falls, a cool 10ft tall waterfall over a series of steps cut into a ginormous smooth rock slab. It was really neat looking and probably would be even cooler if the creek levels were higher. I tried to take some pics but it's hard to capture. We rock-hopped across the creek below the waterfall pool and climbed up the access trail to gravel VA road 671, which we followed for a mile down to Trent's Grocery. We arrived at exactly the same time as northbounder Half Glass. He calls himself The Last of the Northbounders! We bought some sodas and I ordered a chicken tenders basket while Mat ordered a pepperoni pizza, and also a cheese pizza to go. We spent an hour eating and chatted with Half Glass. Coming from Washington DC, Half Glass is hiking the AT during some time off before starting law school. He had a sweet dog with him that he said started following him a few days ago. She was super friendly and wasn't afraid of people. His plan was to bring her to the next hostel, Wood's Hole Hostel, in 10 miles where the owner is very animal friendly and will most likely help him find a home for the dog. The owner of Trent's Grocery was super nice and gave Half Glass a leash, a collar, and some dog food. Before hitting the trail, Mat bought a can of beer for himself and a can of root beer for me as I bagged up the cheese pizza to pack out. We set out again, bidding Half Glass goodbye, and reconnecting with the AT. We had nice ridge walking. At Price Ridge Road, we stopped to filter some water out of the drainage on the side of the road, the only water in a 17-mile stretch that includes a dry camp. The rest of the day was spent walking on the ridge of Brushy Mountain on freshly fallen leaves. I have a few thoughts on these freshly fallen leaves we've been dealing with the last few days. First off, they're treacherous! The leaves create a thick covering, about two inches deep, so they hide the location of rocks on trail. We may step on a rock wrong and roll an ankle, or put awkward pressure on weird parts of our feet. The leaves are slippery, causing us to slide slightly backwards on climbs or slip and fall on steep descents. We've realized that our feet have been unusually sore at the end of the day despite not going very many miles and we think it's lack of traction created by the leaves. Additionally, they're NOISY! It's so hard to have a conversation because the leaves make so much noise; my soft voice especially gets washed out by the continual crunching of unbroken leaves. Mat and I may have to yell at each other the rest of the trail! We pitched our tent at a flat area along the ridge. There are many stars out tonight!Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Pizza Party - Pizza and Root Beer for dinner!Mat: Barista - Mat fixes me up a mocha each morning using an instant coffee packet and chocolate instant breakfast mix.Daily steps: 46,801Elevation gain: 3612'","Sugar Run Mountain, VA (Mile 1573.5)

At one point, we stepped over an old, thin fallen log with a large crack in it. Mat was going to step down hard to break it all the way through when he noticed a tiny microcosm of teeny little mushrooms growing only inside the crack. It looked really cool so he just left the log alone. Prior to crossing Interstate 77, we hit southbound mile 1600, which means mile 2100 for us; less than 100 miles to go! We climbed up to Brushy Mountain Outpost by 10:30AM and ordered some food; I ordered a cheeseburger but Mat went with the Brushy Mountain Burger, which is a cheeseburger with an inch thick slice of bologna. It was huge! In fact, it bested Mat and he was unable to finish it! Migrator walked in and downed a double scoop of ice cream as well as a bacon cheeseburger in no time. We sat and talked. From New York City and just out of highschool, Migrator has been trekking along, killing it! We did our small resupply then bought some ice cream, once again with huge portions. After an hour and a half, we bade farewell to Migrator and continued on our way. The tread continued to be fabulous but covered in slick, noisy leaves. We pass by Trail Boss trail, which had a bunch of funny video game reference comments in the Farout App. From there we dropped down to scenic Laurel Creek, a large creek dropping down a series of shallow rock steps, lined with golden leaves. Short climb up before dropping back down to Hunting Camp Creek. A pack of coyotes yammered fairly close by as we bottomed out; such funny animals, they sound like spaznuts! We loaded up on water for a dry 12.5 miles plus a dry camp. The climb up to Garden Mountain ridge was long but not terrible. We reached the top just before sunset so we went a ways until we found a nice camp site and stopped for the night: a mellow, forested point of the ridge. The trees have lost all their leaves up here at 3900ft so we could see through to the green pastures in the wide valley below dotted with little farm houses or barns. The stars were crisp in the night sky once the last of the light left. A lot more day and section hikers out today.Trailnames of the Day:Kalyn: Down Hermit crab - I bury myself in my cold-weather Feathered Friends Kestrel down sleeping bag when I sleep. Mat uses my Enlighten Equipment puffy jacket as extra insulation in his sleeping bag since I don't need it to stay warm in my current bag.

Luckily, I closed my vestibule door earlier in the night, keeping my gear pretty dry. We got to walking before 8:20AM, the ridgetop trail alternating between long sections of annoying rocky tread and short sections of smoother tread. Within an hour we reached VA Route 623 and saw Amythest drive away; she must have dropped Mishap off at the trailhead. We continued on the ridge with active hiking. I slipped on leaves and fell; I've fallen multiple times in the last few days due to slippery leaves. Before the climb up to Chestnut Knob, we came upon Mishap chatting with some section hikers. Two of them we had met earlier on Priest Mountain! Mishap continued on and we eventually started up Chestnut Knob. It was open and pretty at the top. We could see down the ridgeline we had been following the last 10 mile and the green valley below. Dropping down the other side had some nice, open views as well. We spotted the mountains of Grayson Highlands State Park for the first time; we're getting close to finishing! At a water source, we met Linguini, a southbounder. We continued dropping down, then followed a series of climbs and descents across the grain of three 700ft ridges. The ford across Lick Creek wasn't bad; we log-hopped our way cross the wide creek. Dropping into Possum Creek campground, we found Mishap and Amethyst cleaning up from dinner. We pulled up and started chatting. Then we heard a shout from the far side of the field, ""Is that Laundry Mat and Pika, and Mishap and Amethyst?"" It was Chef Boyardee getting dropped off by Fat Chill! We last saw Fat Chill at the Catamount Hotel in Bennington, VT! She was off trail but following hikers. She took Chef Boyardee and a few others to Tennessee for a few days and was just dropping him off. They came over. Amethyst introduced us to another southbounder named Twiglet who is ahead of us but hanging out with Amethyst healing up from a medical issue. Then Linguini rolled out of the woods. We had a full on SoBo gathering! Fat Chill took off and Linguini beelined for nearby Bear Garden Hostel but the rest of us chatted for a bit. Amethyst hooked us up again with soda, beer, and a hot cocoa with whipped cream for me. Eventually we bade them farewell and hiked with Chef Boyardee for four miles into the night before we found a place to camp. Trailnames of the Day:Mat: Muskrat - When we first met Amethyst, she misheard Mat's trailname as Muskrat.

Chef Boyardee was sitting outside waiting for it to open so we sat down for lunch together. Before we ordered food, Wildstyle showed up and joined us. We hadn't seen him since just before Harper's Ferry. The meal was great! After paying, we bid farewell to Wildstyle and Chef Boyardee; they're both hiking on. We decided to hitch into Atkins and go from there. We set up to hitch and scored a ride in about 20 mins. The guy was very friendly, took us to General Dollar and offered to wait while we resupplied and take us to the hotel half a mile away. It was very generous of him but we have to purchase supplies to make crowns for our finish so we told him we'd be ok with walking. We resupplied, then scouted for crowns. We hoped there would be something from Halloween but the seasonal isle already changed over to Christmas! We went to the birthday isle but they were out of paper crowns and only had very small plastic tiaras that looked like they would break in a hot second. So we wandered to the crafts isle. We were looking at project paper when I spotted bulletin board liner. ""That's it! This will work!"" I told Mat.We walked the half mile to the hotel, checked in, then hit up the cafe across the street to order dinners to-go since the cafe closes at 3:00PM.

We cleaned up, did some town chores, and then I got to work making crowns for Mat and myself. My mom sent us our trail stickers with the last box of shoes in Daleville so I had everything I needed !

It rained overnight and continued to rain on and off in the morning. We loitered in our room until just before 11:00AM. After check out, we hit up Subway next door and ordered sandwiches to pack out for tonight's dinner. Although not raining in town, the clouds were dark up on the ridges and we could tell it was raining up there, so we decided to get an early lunch at Atkins Tank cafe. We ordered from the breakfast menu and discussed our exit strategy from the trail. The big question was: do we try to hitch into Damascus from Massie Gap at the Grayson Highlands? We did that last spring and it turned into a three hour, three hitch ordeal! Or we could just walk the extra 30 miles into Damascus over a day and a half, forgoing a long hitch. I guess we'll just see what happens. In the meantime, we have to hitch back up to the trail!We set out to hitch and was out for about 10 minutes when rain started up. We sought out shelter by sitting on a bench under the restaurant overhang; holding an umbrella usually doesn't help with hitching but we didn't want to get soaked standing at the side of the road. Luckily, the shower didn't last long and we ventured back out to the roadside. It took about 30 minutes before a Jeep Gladiator stopped. He grew up next to the AT so knew we were hikers. We were on trail by 1:15PM, climbing up out of the Middle Fork Holston River valley. From the top of Glade Mountain, we could see through the bare trees to the valley below, now shrouded in low clouds. There were some plants with berries or seeds that resembled miniature pumpkins; very fitting for Halloween! It would be fun to dry them to create beads. We climbed up and down a series of ridges before gaining Brushy Mountain ridge. The trail was very rocky and uneven, covered in slick wet leaves. At least the leaves aren't as noisy when wet, allowing Mat and I to talk.We passed by the Mt. Rogers National Rec Area visitor center around 6:00PM. It was a beautiful large stone building, CCC-style, on nicely manicured grounds. We laughed at a sign posted prominently on a side lawn stating ""Hog grazing prohibited"". Hog grazing?? Man I wish we got a picture of that sign. Immediately after the visitor center was the Partnership Shelter, one of the fancy shelters with a shower. No one was there.

We could see the valleys below getting lit up occasionally by the sun as clouds opened and closed again. We hiked into the clouds, crossing aptly named High Point, heavy mist dampening everything. Dropping down to Dickey Gap, we found Amethyst and Twiglet hanging out at the parking lot. We stopped to chat for a bit before continuing on. Next was a split in the trail: follow the trail over Comers Creek or take a blue blaze around it. We decided to risk the rock hop over Comers Creek Falls and very easily stepped over the creek using large stepping stones. Maybe the creek gets high enough to be a problem in the spring?After the falls, we decided to take an alternate trail over Iron Mountain. The AT drops down towards Hurricane Creek before climbing back up to go over Iron Mountain whereas the Iron Mountain trail continues climbing from the falls up to the top of Iron Mountain and stays on top, reconnecting with the AT before dropping down the backside to Fox Creek. We stopped for a break at the top to attempt drying out our gear in the breeze since there wasn't much sun. After break, we dropped down and crossed pretty Fox Creek.

Less than a mile away was Old Orchard Shelter but, before we reached it, we passed by a couple section hikers going northbound. They informed us there was a lost dog at the shelter, no collar but sweet. When we arrived, we found a hound dog, skittish and very skinny, but not mean. We threw him some jerky and cheese sticks since he looked so skinny. The shelter is located in Lewis Fork Wilderness in the middle of Mt. Rogers National Rec Area, far from any neighborhoods, so I took a picture of him with plans to tell the rangers at Grayson Highlands State Park. But as we walked away, he started following us. We didn't know how he would react to the wild ponies but figured if he followed us all the way to the State Park, he would be around more people and would get help. The dog ended up following us for all eight miles to Massie Gap. Although skinny, he was clean, and didn't appear to have any injuries except sore paws. He didn't know any commands, but he warmed up to us and was friendly. The walking was lovely all the way to Grayson Highlands. We passed by a few campers at Scales Campground and spotted a few ponies in the bushes of a side trail above the campground. Not long after, we came upon a group of ponies on trail. We pulled out our crowns and took a few pictures with the ponies in the background. They kept a sharp eye on the dog 10 yards behind us. At one point, we passed some ponies but they turned and stood their ground against the dog, not letting him pass. We kept going, figuring the dog would backtrack to the campers at the Scales Campground not even a mile away. But a mile later, the dog showed up again; he must have gotten around the ponies somehow. So the dog continued to follow us all the way to Massie Gap. When we reached the Gap at noon, it was like a 180° from when we were here in June. In June, the place was crowded with day hikers and ponies. Today: nothing. No ponies, no day hikers. I'm glad we saw the ponies by the Scales Campground to get some pictures! But, we were hoping there would be a lot of day hikers so someone would take the dog. We couldn't just leave him there with nobody around. Plus, we decided we needed to get into town today to start working on job opportunities and so needed to hitch, which is much harder to do with a dog, especially if you don't have a collar or leash. Even if we did end up walking into Damascus, the dog was already exhausted by following us for eight miles and it would be an additional 30 miles into town! So we called Grayson County Animal Control. Luckily, a sheriff arrived an hour later. The dog was curled up in a ball sleeping and just let the Sheriff come right up, pet him, and slip a loop leash on him without issue. When the dog didn't want to walk, he let the Sheriff carry him to the truck. He was a sweet, good dog; he didn't know any commands but he wasn't mean and didn't bark at people or animals, and stayed close when we walked. If we had a car or lived nearby, we would have taken him in (and named him Grayson). But at least now he'll be warm tonight and have access to food and water. He's a good looking hound dog so he'll get adopted quickly. We finished our AT hike, and our Triple Crown! Although more stressful than we imagined! Since there were no people around, Mat asked the Sheriff for a ride out of the park to the entrance where we'd have more traffic for hitching into Damascus. The Sheriff offered to drive us all the way to town! But, when he checked with his superior, they told him he could only take us as far as the country line, which was White Top. We gladly accepted and was dropped off at the same gas station as last time. Deja Vu, but this time we knew better than to walk away from the gas station! Still, there wasn't much traffic and we ended up waiting an hour for a ride. A Christmas tree farm next to the gas station kept sending out loads of trees and coming back empty. Eventually one of the workers leaving for the day picked us up, having watch us unsuccessfully solicit rides for an hour. Kent was a retired airplane pilot who now lives in Shady Valley and helps his girlfriend with her Christmas tree farm. It was fun chatting with him. He dropped us off in front of the Damascus diner at 3:00PM. This time the hitch took us two hours with two hitches, not bad! We ate a late lunch before walking over to the Dragonfly Inn. We showered and rested in bed as we began working on our next work contract. Around 6:30PM, we got hungry again. Google maps showed Seven Trails Diner, a half mile away, was open until 9:00PM so we decided to walk over there. When we arrived, the diner was closed and dark. Mat said, ""But wait..."" and turned my body to the side to the only building lit up in the darkness: a Subway. It even had it's door propped open in welcome. Additionally, there was a gas station behind us that offered gas station brand Hunt Brothers Pizza. Subway or gas station pizza. Both are on par in terms of my interest in them but we just had subway day before yesterday so I went with the pizza. I just finished the Appalachian Trail, heck I just finished the Triple Crown, and all I got was a gas station pizza for dinner! But I was too exhausted from the day to feel very celebratory anyway, and I definitely didn't have the energy to seek out a different diner, so gas station pizza will suffice. We can celebrate tomorrow! We brought our pizza back to the room to eat while laying down and catching up on Andor. Trailnames of the Day:AT thru-hiker - We did it!Triple Crowner - We really did it!!! 👑👑👑Daily steps: 22,376Elevation gain: 2146'","Lewis Fork Wilderness, VA (Mile 1682.1)

Laundry Mat & Pika,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660349,"A final entry on my perspective of the AT, coming from a person who:
A) Hiked the AT as a later trail (not their first)B) Is from the west coastC) Doesn't like to be around lots of people 
Overall, I enjoyed the AT more than I thought I would. I believe a huge part of that is due to two factors: 1) It was a dry year and 2) we did a flip-flop hike with a southbound emphasis. 

Weather:I do admit, there were a couple of times I fantasized about calling it quits on this trail. These were days when the humidity was so high, literally nothing dried. My thinking went along the lines of ""This isn't fun, there are so many other places I'd rather be exploring right now."" But, like every adversity, these were temporary thoughts that passed once the humidity improved.  All fleeting thoughts about quitting ended once fall arrived; the temperatures dropped, the wind picked up, and humid days were mild and extremely rare. Because we started our southbound section on the late side (July 23rd), the fall transition occurred earlier in our hike than had we started going south during a more traditional time (early June). The weather transition occurred for us at Port Clinton, Pennsylvania. We hit the peak fall colors in Virginia. We'd heard about the Virginia Blues but we never experienced that since the weather was so lovely and the colors were amazing. In fact, Virginia ended up being our favorite state (followed closely by Maine). If 2022 was a wet year, I'm sure I would have had a harder time. 

DirectionWe knew we didn't want to do a traditional northbound hike because of how crowded we heard it was. Because we had a prior trip planned in Alaska in late June, we decided to make our hike a flip-flop, starting our hike in Georgia after our work contract ended in May, heading north until it was time to go to Alaska, then flipping up to Katahdin and hike south back to where we left off. We really enjoyed this schedule. We hiked in the south after the big crowds had already gone through and got to see the Mountain Laurel, Azalea, and Rhododendron blooms (in fact, I thought the Grayson Highlands were much prettier in June than in November). We got off trail before the heat really picked up. Then, starting at Katahdin on July 23rd, we missed the black fly season in Maine. We had some record heat in Maine but there were lots of swimming opportunities.  The only drawback with a late southbound was how many places shut down or significantly reduce their hours during the off-season. There were a number of times we missed out on iconic AT stops because we hit them midweek instead of on a weekend. 
Knowing what we know now, if we wanted to do a continuous hike and not deal with flipping, we would do a late southbound (starting end of July). Although, we would want to get into hiking shape prior to tackling the difficult climbs of Maine and New Hampshire. We would also have to be prepared for snow travel in the Smokey Mountains (we didn't have to worry about snow in the Smokeys with our flip-flop).

Water carries and capacityAs I mentioned earlier, 2022 was a dry year and many of the springs dried up for the fall. The driest states were New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (I don't know how dry North Carolina, Tennessee, or Georgia are in the fall but there was more frequent rain by the time we finished at Damascus in early November so the springs were replenishing). The longest dry stretch we encountered was about 25 miles in southern New York, south of Bear Mountain (SoBo Mile 787.8); however, a local trail angel was maintaining huge water caches at the frequent road crossings in this area so we actually didn't have to carry that far. The longest water dry section we had to carry water was 17 miles in Pennsylvania south of Port Clinton. Luckily the weather turned cool by this point and we didn't drink as much water as we did when it was hot. Typically water sources were approximately five miles apart so our water capacity was 2.5L each and that was all we needed. We dry-camp most of the time so 5L capacity between the two of us was enough to get us two cooked dinners, one hot drink (sometimes more), and to the next water source. 

TicksTicks were a major concern we had about hiking the AT. Lyme disease is not something we want to contract! We considered wearing long pants/sleeves but knew that would be uncomfortable with the heat and humidity. Our strategy ended up being to send our shorts/skirt, shirts, and socks to InsectShield to have them professionally treated with Permethrin. It costs $8 per article of clothing (a pair of socks is considered one article) or you can order a bag for $100 and fill it with as many items of clothing as you can. (Because there are two of us, we did the bag order and also treated the clothes we were bringing up to Alaska.) It worked amazingly well; not only did it offer amazing protection up in the Arctic during the mosquito bloom, but we also hiked the whole AT without seeing a single tick on us. The lack of ticks could be partly due to the dry weather and the time of year we hiked but we never saw a tick on us. 

Comparison of the trails:We got asked this question a lot when people found out we already hiked the other trails. Here are our thoughts. 
Good things about the AT that the other two trails don't have:The AT is a simple walking path. No concerns about avalanches or fords (every ford crossing on the AT had a high water alternate). The only risky things were road crossings with poor visibility and mentally unstable squatters.The AT has many hostels that are amazingly dialed into what hikers need. Most of them had fantastic resupply options selling single items (buy only three Ziplocs instead of the whole box)! And many of them had daily shuttles to local stores and/or restaurants. The hostels make town days much easier. Most locals knew about the trail, which made hitching a ride much easier and businesses more tolerant of loitering. On the other trails, local knowledge about the trail isn't as pervasive so hikers often get mistaken as homeless or vagabonds. It can take a long while before someone is willing to pick up a hitchhiker, and businesses are less tolerant of loitering. The green tunnel wasn't as claustrophobic as we imagined it would be. The canopy was often pretty high up and therefore provided a lot of space to see out.There are so many cool amphibians, reptiles, insects, and birds. The western trails are often too dry for amphibians and the relative lack of tree cover makes for fewer insects and birds. Frequent bailout points: one can practically stay in a hostel or hotel every night if one can afford the shuttle fees. In any case, if the weather turns bad, you are almost guaranteed to cross a road at some point during the day which can bring you into a local town.Bad things the AT has not found on the other trails:Poor trail design. This is particularly noticeable in Maine and New Hampshire. The western trails have better trail design, with better erosion management and grades, mostly due to being constructed by the CCC. The AT often went straight up or down, sometimes with huge steps, creating a lot of erosion and making the trail unnecessarily dangerous. We heard of many hikers (day, weekend, and thru) getting injured in the Whites, slipping and breaking a bone, and needing to be rescued by helicopter because the trails are too rugged. If the trails were designed better, there wouldn't be as many broken bones, and the ones that still get broken would probably be easier to get out by other means than an expensive helicopter ride. We've never fallen as often as we did on the AT and we thank our lucky stars we didn't break a bone.Squatters: because the AT is so close to many towns and has shelters every few miles, we frequently heard about or ran into homeless people with mental health issues who took over shelters that are a mile or so from town. Thanks to the FarOut App, hikers can learn which shelters are frequented by squatters and plan accordingly. 

Specific items needed and not needed on the AT:
Q-tips: I used a lot of q-tips on the AT. I think the humidity made my ear canal feel damp and itchy, especially if I was wearing an earbud. A daily q-tip helped dry out my ear canal and helped with itchiness.Camp/town sandals: Normally we do not bring sandals on thru-hikes. But we loved having sandals on the AT purely for the use of hostel showers! I ended up with two bandanas on the AT. One to blow my nose, and a dedicated (and much more often used) second one just to wipe sweat from my face. I saw other hikers had their sweat bandanas attached to their shoulder straps so it would air-dry between uses. Sunglasses. One could argue that sunglasses aren't necessary on the AT. Mat did send his home. I kept mine for a couple of reasons. 1) I have light-colored eyes and am pretty sensitive to glare. 2) Going southbound, we walked into the sun. As the leaves fell in the fall, the sun was in our faces more. Hat & sunscreen: I usually use a large-brimmed sun hat on my hikes. Because of all the shade, I got away with using just a visor. I ended up sending my sunscreen home. Between the shady forest and visor, I felt I was protected enough. I know some people are more religious about wearing sunscreen than I am. Umbrella: I normally carry an umbrella for sunshade as well as rain protection. I didn't need the umbrella for sunshade and, therefore, carried it in my pack much more than on other trails. I thought about sending it home. But, it was indispensable in the rain, especially while climbing up steep trail! I'm glad I didn't send it home.
Dispersed camping and sheltersComing from the west, I am used to what East-Coasters call ""Dispersed"" camping. Since the East Coast is more crowded than the West, trail systems try to minimize the impact by building shelters near a water source and with a privy, so the majority of hikers camp within that location. I think it's smart to have these shelters to minimize the annual impact of thousands of hikers; the AT would have a very different feel if every few yards you walk by a campsite with a fire ring someone built. That being said, the shelters do have some problems. They often attract habituated animals, anywhere from mice to bears. The animals know the shelters are where people, and their food, rest for the night so they come. There are ways to counter the food-stealing animals: bear boxes at some shelters, bear hangs at others, dangle hooks inside the shelter to protect from mice, etc. So that helps. But we didn't want to deal with mice scurrying across our faces or bears wandering into camp while sleeping so we avoided the shelters as much as possible.
Because I didn't do much planning prior to starting this hike, I had no idea what the dispersed camping situation was like on the AT. Here is what I learned:
Dispersed camping is allowed, and easy to do, on the AT except in specific locations. The states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland have a notice on the FarOut app stating ""Camping on the Appalachian Trail is only limited to designated sites."" That being said, we never saw any signs on the ground forbidding dispersed camping in these states except for small areas of private property or day-use areas (small enough to walk through). We dispersed camped in all these states, making sure to follow the typical Leave-No-Trace rules (A quarter-mile away from streams, roads, trails, private property, ruins, and shelters/designated campsites; no fires or buildings of fire rings, etc). Connecticut was the only state where the underbrush was so thick we couldn't find dispersed camping and ended up staying at designated campsites. Luckily it was south enough that we didn't have to compete with north bounders for campsites. Also, Connecticut is only 53 miles so we only spent two nights in CT.Other specific areas had camping restrictions and were too big to hike through without camping. Here they are in a southbound direction:Baxter State Park, Maine (N: 2179.8-2194.3; S: 0-14.5): Baxter State Park has many rules and regulations. They pride themselves as a wilderness park: recreation takes a back seat to preserving the wildness of the park. With the popularity of thru-hiking exploding in recent years, there have been recent clashes between thru-hikers entitlement behavior and the state park's ""Wilderness first, recreation second"" ethos. Personally, I think both parties would benefit from a movement of the northern AT terminus to, say, the Canadian border but that hasn't occurred (yet). In the meantime, thru-hikers must try to sift through Baxter's many rules (which aren't that clear on their website) and stress about being legal (which is more difficult for non-Maine residents going southbound). We were lucky to move through Baxter State Park legally but it was stressful as southbound non-Maine-residents. AT hikers should look at Baxter State Park and the AT Consortium websites to read the rules and plan their trips. White Mountains National Forest, New Hampshire (N: 1790.5-1907.8; S: 286.5-403.8): Basically the White Mountains National Forest allows dispersed camping following the typical rules, with the addition of no camping above timberline (timberline is considered to be areas where trees are eight feet tall or less), which is basically most ridges in the White Mountains National Forest. Additionally, no camping within a half-mile radius of the fancy backcountry lodges. We had no problem following these regulations while dispersed camping.Delaware Water Gap National Rec Area, New Jersey (N: 1292.2-1321.1; S: 873.2-902.1):  Dispersed camping is allowed but has the typical Leave-No-Trace restrictions. They are listed in the FarOut app or on the website.Cumberland Valley Crossing, Pennsylvania (N: 1120.4-1138.6; S: 1055.7-1073.9): The trail cuts 18 miles across a valley filled with private property.  There are shelters/campsites at each end so one could do it in a day. There are also a couple of hotels 0.2 miles off-trail about halfway through the crossing one could stay at. We did see opportunities for stealth camping within bushes during this crossing but it would be noisy with traffic and easily accessed by homeless people. It's possible, but I wouldn't do it. Shenandoah National Park, Virginia (N: 868.0-968.2; S: 1225.1-1326.7): Dispersed camping is allowed following the typical dispersed camping rules. A free backcountry permit must be obtained at the trailhead kiosk located at trail entry points into the park.Virginia Triple Crown Area, Virginia (N: 703.7-732.8; S: 1461.5-1489.4): This is an extremely popular hiking area consisting of McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs, and Dragons Tooth. There are plenty of designated shelters and campsites in the area. We tented at a shelter while walking through and were rewarded with loud campers arriving at 11:00PM and staying up until 3:00AM. The trail south of VA Route 311 (between Dragons Tooth and McAfee Knob) was much less used and had a few stealth camping opportunities.Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee/North Carolina (N: 164.7-238.9; S: 1954.2-2028.4): This National Park does require a permit before entering the park, which can be done online. A copy of the permit can be screenshotted on your phone or printed out and carried. Backpackers must stay at shelters. Thru-hikers must stay in shelters unless the shelter is full of non-thru-hiking campers, then the thru-hiker can tent next to the shelter. We tented next to the shelters because they were full each night. There were many other restricted camping areas throughout the AT (Max Patch, Grayson Highlands State Park, Harper's Ferry, Ponds of the Green Mountains National Forest, etc) but usually they were a mile or less in length and therefore easy to plan around and walk through.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0
