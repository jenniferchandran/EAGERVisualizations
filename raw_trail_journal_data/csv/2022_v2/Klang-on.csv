(Privies at shelters don’t have it, so we have to furnish our own).  Second surprise was Jacob’s Ladder, a 600’ climb in less than a mile that worked out to over 1000 ft./mile.  Weather continues to be good and it was another good day!  5300’ of ups/downs.

They do a great job and the hospitality is excellent!  Got a shower, clothes washed, and shuttled into Robbinsville for resupply.  Smog (for Slow Moving Old Guy) and All In showed up at the inn and we rode with them and J&J to a great dinner at Fontana Village.  We ate at the same restaurant that friends Meg, Neal, and Catherine Evans took me to for lunch, nearly a year ago on my SOBO hike they here.  The 3 other hikers were all doing NOBO sections like Wicked and me, but are coming off the trail.  Among numerous enjoyable discussion topics, were all the things we take for granted in our “normal” lives!
