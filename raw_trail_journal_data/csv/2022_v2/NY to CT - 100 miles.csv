NY to CT - 100 miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653563,"For my 2022 hike I decided to continue going North on the AT. Having completed PA in 2021, NJ and part of NY in 2019, I wanted to complete NY state and continue up through Connecticut. Approximately 100 miles would take me within a few miles of the Massachusetts border in the far northwest corner of Connecticut.
After discussing plans with my parents and their intent to stay at their house in Dennis, MA for a couple weeks in June, we agreed on a June date where they would be able to drop me off at the trailhead on their way to Cape Cod without too much of a detour from their travel route.
They had picked me up from the Anthony Wayne Recreation Area in 2019 after my hike from Delaware Water Gap. This is where I would pick up where I left off 3 years prior.",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Tue",0

When I finished in 2019 I exited the woods and crossed the two lanes of the Palisades Parkway and walked up the shoulder for a few miles to the recreation area to make pickup easier. Unfortunately, a hiker was killed when struck by a car here in 2021 https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/appalachian-trail-hiker-killed-at-palisades-parkway-road-crossing/ so in the past few months they’ve rerouted the trail to utilize an overpass over the highway. This was something long overdue in my opinion having attempted to cross this road before. Depending on the time of day and traffic volume, it could make it almost impossible to cross the road for any hiker as most drivers would not expect to see pedestrians here and have little time to brake, there is not much signage or warning of a crossing, and very little gaps between cars to allow somehow to get across in time.
As we approached the area by car I was taking a driver’s perspective and trying to see what it would be like for a driver encountering a hiker; I found that the crossing comes up very quickly. There is a sign to the left indicating a hiker crossing, but no other warnings or signs to slow down. We turned into the area and parked by the trailhead. The recreation area was quiet other than a guy hitting golf balls on the large grassy area next to the large parking lot. We enjoyed some vanilla Oreo cookies as a snack and I said goodbye to my parents.
I started around 1pm, so I didn’t expect to get far on my first day. Within a few miles I would cross through the Bear Mountain resort area, stop to grab a cold Coke from a vending machine and sit for a bit. The area has a resort hotel, and a water park I could hear people enjoying from a few hundred feet away. You can BBQ, picnic, swim, boat or just run and hike in the area. There is a Zoo as well, but the gate was closed on this Wednesday as they were rehabbing the animal enclosures. My devious plan was to text my family that I saw a bear in the woods and then show them a pic of a black bear in one of the enclosures as a joke. This text would have to wait.https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xz1K...
https://photos.app.goo.gl/DpKC...I crossed the Hudson River bridge as car traffic from the opposite direction was moving slowly. There were some classic cars mixed into the traffic, and my guess is they were possibly coming from or going to a car show. Incidentally, the bridge is considered the lowest elevation point on the whole AT!?  In reality the nearby part of the zoo area is lower, but that’s not considered “on the trail”. Having trudged through the bogs and swamps in northern New Jersey, to find out that a bridge a few hundred feet over the Hudson was the lowest point was surprising.https://photos.app.goo.gl/zqek...https://photos.app.goo.gl/ybqP...
After crossing the bridge and weathering the intense cross-wind there was a steep climb up to a mountain top in the Hudson Highlands State Park. After a few miles I arrived at the Hemlock Springs campsite for my first night, with 10 miles under my belt. There was an older couple already in their tent that was doing a 140-mile hike, and a few other tents setup on the other side of the site. There was some rain expected in the morning, so I made sure to fix my tent for maximum dryness.

This time of year, myself and most hikers tend to rise with the sun and the sound of the birds, which would usually be around 6am. This morning however, the rain would start to move in at this time and hang over the area until around 9am. Rather than pack up and hike in the wet, I decided to stay put until it passed. I did not hear any other movement at the campsite so it seemed like other hikers were doing the same.
After the three-hour rain delay, I got started. Around 11am I was coming around a corner of flat, open trail and saw this large, furry black object in the trail about 100 feet ahead. It was a bear! 
https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZkbV...
This would be my first bear sighting on the AT! 
PA and NJ are where you more typically come across them, and I'd not even come close to seeing one over 370+ miles of those trails. It's hard to know if the bear even saw me as I'd come up from behind it, and it started to leave the trail right after I saw it. In talking with other hikers about this during my hike, it seems pretty likely it knew about me well before I knew about it, and just mosey'd right off the trail once it picked up my scent or sound. 
I crossed a back road and came upon a local historical site I'd heard about previously, the Innoculation Station. 
https://photos.app.goo.gl/pNUu...
I'd bumped into a guy named Jeff earlier in the day, shortly before I saw the bear. We both arrived at the Appalachian Trail Deli https://www.yelp.com/biz/appal... and grabbed some food and sat and chatted for a bit. The Deli has breakfast all day, lunch, lots of resupply options for hiker and is open 24 hours. While I didn't really need a prepared meal I ordered a bacon, egg & cheese on a bagel and a Gatorade. Jeff had mentioned the next campsite as his next destination as he was just doing a few days of hiking. He parked his car at the next campsite, hiked south, and had turned around to go north, the same direction as me. 
I arrived at the Dennytown Road campsite after a 12-mile hike. Other than my first day, and last day, I had budgeted about 15 miles per day on this hike so I could pace myself and reach my ultimate destination on time. Due to the rain delay in the morning, 12 miles seemed reasonable and this site would be a good one to stop. The site is right next to a road and parking lot, with super-clean porta-potties located a short walk away, an open grassy area to setup your tent, a pump house about 100 feet away for water, and a woodsy area next to the grassy area with plenty of trees to hang your food bag.
Jeff arrived shortly after and grabbed a speaker from his car and had some blues music going while he setup his tent. He offered to let me use his car to charge anything, and also to store my food bag overnight which I took him up on.
For your entertainment, please enjoy this video of a persistent ant in my tent repeatedly attempting to climb my tent wall, failing, and attempting again. This would continue for many minutes.

I was still drying out from the previous day's rain, and used some nearby tree branches to hang various pieces of clothing and then settle in for the night.","Hemlock Springs campsite

NY to CT - 100 miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653574,"On the first night of my hike, I didn't sleep well, though on this night I would sleep pretty well. I made one gear upgrade that I think was starting to pay off - a pillow. In previous hikes I'd just used my clothing sack, which was a bit of a weight-saving ""hiker hack"". Why not use a bag of soft material that you were already carrying, as a pillow? Well, the clothing bag is made of durable vinyl and is not a comfortable material to lay your face on, and the inside of the ""pillow"" (my clothing) would tend to sag over night resulting in lots of tossing and turning. My upgrade was an inflatable camp pillow I purchased at an REI seasonal sale. I'm not sure why I didn't think of buying something like this sooner, as the cost was about $17, with a minimal size and weight penalty when added to my pack.
A few other hikers (both couples) had arrived later in the day, and we all seemed to wake and prep around the same time. Jeff grabbed my food bag from his car, and told me he planned to do about 5-7 miles and then turn around to head back to his car and head home. He lived in Haddon Township, NJ just across the Delaware from Philadelphia and was out for a few days hike. He's done the section from Delaware Water Gap (PA-NJ border) to NY before, both north and south. I offered my 'thanks' for his company the last day or two and I left the campsite around 7am. 
Due to the previous day's rain, it seemed the trail today would be a bit of a slog as it was very muggy and buggy for the first half of the day.  It would dry out a bit towards the end of the day. I had picked up a head net for this hike as I had heard New England could be a bit buggy this time of year, but ultimately I would not use it. I used some bug spray, and also used the camp towel I had hanging from my pack to lay over my head to cover my ears and back of my neck when the bugs seemed the most intrusive. I think the towel disguised the heat coming from my head and various orifices was a huge benefit to keeping them at bay.
There was a nice flat, easy section early in the morning. It included a section of trail that had these built-up ""bridge"" sections of trail https://photos.app.goo.gl/pyja...
These have some historical significance as they were built to allow for the transportation of iron ore mined in area pulled by horses. Rather than have the horses pull the ore up and down over small hills, the valleys were built up with stones. The trail and ""bridges"" were pretty narrow so I was trying to imagine what kind of cart was being used to drag the ore. It's possible the trail was built only wide enough to accommodate the horses with maybe some sort of sled to drag the ore. I did find some write-ups of the history behind this https://highlandscurrent.org/2...
During my last hike in November '21 I came across some trail magic including a package of Sour Patch Kids. At the time, this cache of sugary goodness would help me get through the more difficult sections of trail later in the day when my energy levels were lower. I had planned ahead on this hike and brought a similar 'Share Size"" sack of flavor with no-one to share with! I would put a few ""kids"" in my pocket to pull from the remainder of the day. 
My trail navigation app (https://faroutguides.com/) indicated a large field would be a good place to stop for the night. The field itself turned out to be a bit overgrown but I found a great stealth spot just before the field to sleep tonight. 

As got ready for sundown it was at this time that I realized I had forgotten to brush my teeth in previous days. I know, gross. I would make sure to correct this oversight for the rest of the hike.

NY to CT - 100 miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653625,"The cool weather was starting to move in, and I could start to feel my body adapting the hiking conditions. I was monitoring a few small blisters developing but the wrap around the balls of my feet helped them from getting worse. 
The hiking in NY continued to be pretty consistent, nicely maintained trails, some climbing, but not too many rocks or unpleasant sections. At around 12p I came upon Nuclear Lake and found a nice spot to sit and have lunch. On my approach to the trail an older man in his 60s said something about a ""doppelganger"". I said, ""Who, me?"" and he proceeded to tell me I looked just someone he used to work for. Then he told me that the same guy laid him off! I said ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm not even from NY"". We both laughed, though he a bit less than I off we went.
My lunch spot: https://photos.app.goo.gl/cTbf...
As I sat and ate I looked up the history of Nuclear Lake, as I'd heard some interesting things about it regarding its name: https://www.poughkeepsiejourna...  I didn't observe and three-eyed fish or anything concerning, but I made a conscious decision to not filter any water from the lake. I did see some Canadian Geese swimming in the lake, and plenty of day hikers using the AT and the connecting loop trails around the lake on this Saturday. 
One hiker stopped to chat for a bit as I finished up my lunch. We would catch up later on trail and for the next 30 mins we had discussions about the area, hiking, sports, etc. while we hiked. He lives nearby and spends part of his weekend helping others navigate the loop trails, and refilling water jugs for AT hikers and seems to enjoy the social aspect of hiking quite a bit. He showed me a nice overlook that I would have otherwise walked right by called 'Cat Rocks' and told me that I would shortly be making a descent from the mountain and pointed out in the distance below where I would be in about 15 minutes. I said 'Thanks' for the local tour and he said his trail name was Torque, though more of a childhood nickname than a trail name.

During the afternoon I came upon a stream and decided to filter some water as I was almost out. The water was a very light brown, and filtering it made it a little less brown but still had a tinge to it. It otherwise smelled and tasted OK and I decided the water color was due to the tannins in the water from cedar trees I could see had fallen into the stream at the crossing. The water had a bit of a dry aftertaste, possibly from the tannins, and since I wasn't dying of thirst I decided I'd drink as little as possible until I could find a more clear water source. The next stream was also brown, but after a few miles I found a sparkling clean water source and dumped all my water and restocked.
One cool landmark I would see this afternoon was the famous Dover Oak of Pawling, NY https://photos.app.goo.gl/LVA7...  The tree is apparently 300+ years old and 22 feet in circumference https://www.nycdayhiking.com/h...
I still wanted to get in about 15 miles today, though there weren't any campsites coming up. I had asked a few hikers going the other direction if they knew of any, but no one could reliably say. One can usually find out about undocumented camp spots, usually for one or two tents, by looking through the comments in the FarOut app. I set my sights on one that would be on a mountain top hoping it was not already taken, or not hard to find. As I reached the mountain top I realized the wind was starting to pick up and the temperature was starting to drop a bit, but I came upon the site right on the trail and quickly setup my tent to get warm.

NY to CT - 100 miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653628,"This morning I would start my hike by finishing up a few more miles of NY with the intent of rolling into Connecticut by mid-day. After coming down off the mountain from the previous night I would do quite a bit of ""board walking"" in the low lands of NY. New Jersey has quite a few sections where they've constructed a small board walk to keep hiker's feet dry in often wet, muddy or downright boggy sections. I think I walked the equivalent of .5 miles of these during the morning. 
As I crossed a rural residential street I came upon my first trail magic of the hike. It was a large cooler stocked with cold drinks and a smaller cooler with snacks. Another contained had supplies like bandages and a guestbook where you could sign your name. On top of the large cooler was the contact info for Eric, who offered to help any hiker he could and provided his phone number. I could see a house just around the bend of the road and wondered if that was Eric. Based on the condition of everything I'd have to assume the cooler is checked pretty frequently. 
https://photos.app.goo.gl/UryC...
I grabbed a drink, a cookie and some Propel water flavoring packets.
Around noon I had popped out of the woods for a short road walk, and soon found myself in CT!  Crossing a state line always feels like an accomplishment on trail. https://photos.app.goo.gl/qDoX...  It probably wouldn't be much longer before I'd come across a hedge fund manager talking on his phone about his next acquisition. Just kidding... I lived in Middletown, CT for a summer internship in college and so this would be the most time I'd spent in CT in 20+ years. I had good memories of CT as a very clean and very green state with lots of handsome small towns and I was looking forward to it.
Shortly after I had come upon the Housatonic River which includes about 5 miles of flat, easy walking along the river side which I was looking forward to. Before that, I stopped for lunch on a small beach on the river which I had all to myself https://photos.app.goo.gl/fyUD...
The hiking today would be quite relaxing as the AT goes, and other than the walk along the river, the ground under my feet in Connecticut seemed to take on a soft, almost ""cushiony"" feel due to the years of leaf litter accumulated and the trail rolled up and down over small hills. By the end of the day however the character of the trail would change pretty dramatically. Perhaps I was lulled by the soft trails I had earlier encountered, but Connecticut decided to throw a few very steep and rocky technical descents straight down from mountain tops. I started to reminisce of my challenging hike of the upper part of PA last November commonly called 'Rocksylvania'. It's even less enjoyable when you're tired, and you just want your day to end. Even just the last mile to get to my destination for the day, was a technical, rocky descent before arriving at the Mt. Algo Campsite.
The campsite was much larger than most you see on the AT; It had a shelter, a nice large and clean privy, a small stream 50 feet away for fresh water and a bear box which is always a welcome sight. There would be a number of hikers here perhaps b/c it was Sunday, and Father's Day. I could hear a man with a German accent, another with a British accent at the picnic table nearby but I decided I needed some ""me"" time after the rocky hiking and settled into my tent for the rest of the night. The burbling sounds from the stream nearby would provide a nice backdrop for a relaxing slumber.

NY to CT - 100 miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653841,"On the next to last day of my hike, I was expecting a pretty relaxing hike. Each day has seemed to get progressively easier, as my body was acclimating to the conditions, my pack was losing weight (as was I) and the weather was starting to dry and remain on the cooler side.
One thing I'd read about before the hike was the presence of Gypsy Moth caterpillars and their eating habits throughout the woods of Connecticut. The AT is know as the ""green tunnel"" for its miles of green canopy that protect you from the sun, but also trap you in what can seem like a long tunnel of vegetation until you cross a dirt road, go under a power line or pop out into a meadow.  
It was very noticeable on this day as I climbed over some small mountains that there wasn't much shade to be found. Trees seemed almost bare of leaves. https://photos.app.goo.gl/vvRT... I used my hat and sunscreen as protection, but luckily the conditions weren't too bad as the weather remained in the 70s and low 80s. 
I would make another slow, technical descent down a rocky hill, which involved using my hands, knees and some bit of patience. Luckily many of the large and small boulders had a slight discoloration from hikers shoes/boots over the years that tend to help connect the dots for each foot placement. A well-placed step now will prevent over-extending a tired joint later.  I got to the bottom and walked past the largest boulder I think I've seen https://photos.app.goo.gl/WRgB... and then to a small parking lot where locals could park and walk the trail.
I was now along the Housatonic River and would begin a relaxing 4-5 mile walk on flat, level ground. I stopped at an accessible brook feeding into the river for some very fresh mountain water before I got on my way.
https://photos.app.goo.gl/xk6j...
https://photos.app.goo.gl/eiUD...
The walk would go by too quickly and after stopping for some lunch I continued on. Despite my fast pace on this section I wasn't under any pressure to make big miles today. My check-in time at the Inn I would be spending the night at the following day was 2pm, and I didn't want to be waiting around for a room, most of the morning. I put in a relatively easy 14 miles for the day and ended at Cesar Brook campsite. 
A couple had already been setup near the front of the campsite and seemed a bit ""giggly"" so I picked a spot near the back of the site on a very soft bed of pine needles. Shortly after they stopped by for a visit while I was in my tent and said they were leaving the site to meet a friend at the next road. They wanted to let me know they weren't leaving because I had just shown up. I thanked them for the thoughtful gesture and thought to myself ""no one does that"".  Well, these friendly people do!
The site had a bear box and was very near a water source. It also had a wash pit which consisted of a box-frame of 2x4s and some screen material where I guess you could place some clothing and then pour water over it and maybe provide some scrubbing action to ""clean"" your clothes. Someone had taken the time to build it and also carve a nice sign on the tree above it to identify what it was. I passed.

NY to CT - 100 miles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653850,"On my final day of hiking I woke from a very restful night's sleep. Soon I'd have the comfort of a bed, but at the same time would surely miss the peacefulness of the woods.
While the idea of a ""doing your business"" in the woods, or even using the commonly found composting or moldering privy in the woods would tend to skeeve most people out, there is usually a common theme - privacy. One humorous aspect of this campsite was this almost, not-quite, sorta maybe a privy in the woods. https://photos.app.goo.gl/EBWi...  Yes, that was it. Note the lack of privacy Safe to say I chose to dig a cat hole on this morning. 
By mid-morning I would traverse over some more low-land and the walking boards I was becoming familiar with. I crossed a makeshift bridge of logs over a stream and as I got to the other side I heard a very loud rustle from a large bush behind me to my left. Within seconds I was about 50 feet from another large black bear, just across the stream. This time I would make direct eye contact with this large animal that was looking at me very curiously. I started to shout ""Hey Bear!"" a few times to announce myself but it didn't seem to care and went about shaking the tree for food. I got my phone out to record and called out a few more times. At this point I wasn't sure which way the trail was going, as my eyes were not about to leave this bear until I knew what it was going to do. It looked at me again and again went about its business. I really was expecting it to run off like I'd heard other bears do when a human starts yelling. The video consists of mostly rustling bushes https://photos.app.goo.gl/UByN...
After I got my bearings, I realized the trail went in the opposite direction so I got on my way and looked back a few times to make sure I was alone. I crossed a road about .25 miles later and shouted to a young woman running with her leashed dog that I'd just seen a bear so maybe stay on the road. She was in agreement and carried on.
The rain threatened a bit later in the morning so I stopped to put my pack rain cover on and put a bit more in my step to avoid ending my day in wet clothes. I came around a bend and a father and daughter were stopping at an overlook for a picture. As I got closer I realized this was the view to see Lime Rock Park, a well-known race track. https://photos.app.goo.gl/brzW...  It looked like the only one doing any driving was someone mowing the grass around the track. Possibly the weather forecast had put any driving activities on hold for the morning.
After I graduated college in the late 90s I had some spending money and could begin my foray into the world of amateur motorsports, so I attended the Skip Barber Driving School at Lime Rock. There was no driving on track, but we did do alot of braking, turning, etc. drills on a smaller paved section, including a few controlled lapp around a small oval in a Dodge Viper.  Now that I have a number of years of actual race track performance driving under my belt, it's always been a desire of mine to go back to tracks like Lime Rock and experience them first hand.
My initial goal for this hike was to reach Salisbury, CT, which would put me at ~103 miles. The Innkeeper, Mark, at https://www.cornwallinn.com/ does provide complimentary shuttle services from the trail back to the Inn, but would probably balk at picking me up from this far out and might charge me for the add'l miles. As I was already going to pay for the next morning's shuttle to the train station, I felt satisfied with my hike so far and the rain was still looming I decided to come off trail at Falls Village, CT. There was a nice cafe there in the small town where I could grab some lunch and await my 2pm check-in and shuttle pick-up. 
There was a hole-in-the-wall package store just around the corner where I could also grab a few local beers to cap off my week of hiking. The cafe was a bit busy, but a thru hiker named Tyler and I sat outside and chatted for a bit about hiking, food, and how Connecticut seemed like a nice place that consisted of approximately 68% Subarus. (We are Subaru owners of 17 years so nothing but love for them).
Mark showed up and took me back to the Inn. When I originally called to book the room, his wife Stacey recognized my 215 area code and asked if I was from the Philadelphia area. They had originally lived in West Philly and ran a B&B there for many years before moving out to CT to raise their kids, now college-age. Their son goes to Temple and she had some helpful suggestion on train routes to get back home which helped me greatly. 
During the car ride, Mark and I chatted about their Inn, and the difficulties they had surviving during the pandemic, and various other topics. The room was great, I showered and relaxed and ordered food from the only place in the area that would deliver to their location. The next morning Mark offered to have breakfast early at 7a if I wanted to catch next earliest train at 830a. Since I was still on hiker time, I was already up at 6a and agreed to the idea of getting home a bit earlier. I moved up the time of my Amtrak ticket (and saved $40!), grabbed some breakfast as we talked more about Philly news and events and he dropped me off at the NY Metro North Regional rail station at Ten Mile River with room to spare.
I got into Grand Central station in NYC and then walked 25 mins across town past the Empire State Building to get to the Amtrak Station for my ride into 30th Street station in Philly. I snapped a few pics of myself as I transitioned from the woods to the urban jungle and all of the human absurdity around me called New York City.
https://photos.app.goo.gl/ju7n...https://photos.app.goo.gl/WZd7...
While I had to take 3 different train lines home, the total trip was as seamless and easy as could be. This would be the most traveling I've undertaken in the pursuit of walking some trails, and made me realize that the further I go on the AT the more time, effort and planning there will be on the front and back end. I may also think about reversing directions and heading south for my next hike starting at the PA/MD border where I first started the AT in 2018.
