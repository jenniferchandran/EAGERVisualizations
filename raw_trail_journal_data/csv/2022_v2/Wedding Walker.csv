Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656590,"Starting what will probably be the toughest section I’ve hiked on the AT (Appalachian Trail) as I’m hiking through the White Mountains (200 miles with 17 peaks over 4,000 feet). Plan is to hike south to Killington,Vermont where I ended my hike last spring. Luckily I have a hiking partner Al (aka  Webmaster- from running into spider webs as an early morning hiker) who I met a couple years ago when we were rained in together at a shelter in Virginia. We met up Monday at an Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) Lodge in Pinkham Notch, New Hampshire after a long bus ride from Boston. We are both planners so I won’t even tell you how many versions of our hiking plan (ok we are on version 5 before setting foot on the trail). Al is a faster hiker than me, he already did 3 weeks on AT this summer but he didn’t abandon me yet  


Today’s hiking plan was to head up 4000’ over rocks (boulders and lava type) and roots over Mount Madison and descend to Madison Springs Hut.  A good part of the climb we had to use our hands instead of our poles on the ascent. We passed a lot of Thru Hikers (most started in Georgia in March), the most interesting one wore only cowboy boots and hat and shorts. 

The AMC Huts are the “bougie” way to hike in this area (bunks, dinner and breakfast) but Al has a good saying about certain older hikers “when the knees get thinner, the wallet gets thicker” so we are splurging on the huts. 


Huts are run by a Croo (this one had six in their twenties) who work 11 days on, 3 days off. They use a “pack board” based on a World War I design which weighs 10 pounds and they load an average of 50 lbs of food which is carried up twice a week (no access to hut by motor vehicles)
There were about 45 people in this hut and dinner included vegetarian tacos, salad and applesauce cake. No beer on tap or showers at the hut.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656596,"Mount Washington (which is known for some of worst weather in U.S.) was on the way to our next hut but the weather forecast included “Wednesday: clouds w afternoon rain. Temperatures: Mid 40s Winds: NE at 30-45 mph increasing to 50-70 mph w/ gusts up to 80 mph” so we left early and took a trail about a half mile under the summit (I promised to hike safely!) It was windy (gusts to 40) but we made it to the hut before an afternoon downpour. We only passed one thru hiker on the way and we asked him how conditions were behind him (I think he went the summit) and he said “it really felt like an adventure!”  
The other two ways to get to the summit are by car or a cog railway. It used to be a tradition for hikers to “moon” the train but they started making arrests so Al and I didn’t partake.
This hut has the most bunks on the AT (space for 90) but it is overflowing as it is cold, windy and rainy so hikers who didn’t have reservations are going to sleep on the dining room floor or down in the “dungeon”.
At dinner Croo member Aiden proposed to Mya while they were introducing the Croo and serving dinner. Plus a couple we met last night at Madison Springs hut announced tonight that they got engaged last night. A lot happens above 5000’

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656673,"Hard rains and extremely high winds (up to 70 mph on the summit above) had us change our plans and stay here another night (what hikers call a zero). Our decision was the correct one as hikers who arrived from the direction we were headed advised not to hike as visibility was only 15-20 feet and the driving rain was brutal. The trail is on a ridge above tree-line for the first 5 miles.  Many other hikers did the same thing and spent time playing games and reading. I picked up a 2012 edition “Appalachia” magazine and read a story called “ding ‘‘em down” (referring to the dinner bell at the huts). The article was a about a father Doug Teschner and his son who were both Croo members of the huts and how the father returned to the huts with his son. Interestingly Doug worked as a manager for the Peace Corp in Kiev, Ukraine and two of the older Croo at this hut talk to him occasionally  (small world!). 


In the book “This Grand & Magnificent Place” I learned about the Abenaki tribe as the first inhabitants, the Crawford Path  (which we will hike on tomorrow) is first hiking trail in America, Ethan Crawford was known as the “Giant of the Hills” due his then-enormous height of 6’2” (my height), tragic avalanches and floods, the rise and fall of the grand railroad hotels and the founding of the AMC (men & women were original members) and other hiking clubs in the late 1800s. Today’s hikers have LED headlamps, the hikers of the 1800s lit matches to read their compasses when darkness fell.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656712,"When I woke up at 5:15am I could see mountains in the distance but by the time we left at 7:30 visibility was 1/16 of a mile which was fine and much better than yesterday. We ended up taking a shorter route (actual mileage was 9.8) to AMC Highland Center (where we were supposed to stay last night) since our batteries were low and there are no more recharge options for 5 days. The path often resembled a stream or waterfall due to 3” of rain on Mount Washington yesterday. But when do 65 year old “kids” get to rock hop over streams all day? At the AMC Center I had a beer (too heavy to carry on trail) and chips (wouldn’t survive being smashed in my food bag). Zealand Falls had 2 beautiful waterfalls and I had the chance to swim and rinse some of my dirty clothes. Water was cold and perfect for sore feet and ankles
A group of 7 dads and 13 kids took up 20 of the 35 bunks here. One dad was with without his CPAP (something my wife’s family can relate to) and I swear it could have been a bear snoring. Luckily I had good earplugs. At 3am I got up to go to the bathroom and the night sky was so clear and stars, moon and planets so bright.

Trivia I learned from reading “Appalachia” magazine last night before bedtime (9:30pm is the start of quiet hours) was that in the 1800s porcupines were deemed destructive and there was a bounty on dead ones. Hunters received a cash bounty based on each porcupine nose you brought in. 


Had 3 amazing views today (Zeacliff, Mount Guyot, North Twin Mountain) with clear skies and warm temperatures. Elevation change appears to be up 1,750 ft down 2,900 ft. Lots of day and weekend hikers on the trail, a number of who are working on climbing all 48 of the 4,000 foot peaks in New Hampshire.  A lot of rock climbing up and down large ravine-like trails full of boulders. No way to practice this kind of hiking in the Midwest. 


Galehead Hut is the most remote Hut is on the smaller side (36 bunks) and has wide view of mountains from the front porch. Al and I had some nice conversations with 2 hikers from Massachusetts and a hiker from Toronto before dinner. The hiker from Toronto rented a house for the summer and is working on the 48 summit. A father (who section hiked the AT over 31 years) is also working on the 48 peaks for a 2nd time. This time with his daughter. 


Dinner was a large slab of turkey (didn’t look natural but it was good), mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, broccoli, salad and chocolate cake. My hiker hunger was more than satisfied. 


As for the nightly reading of “Appalachia” one of the women from Massachusetts always read the “accidents” section which I initially thought was a bit morbid but they always have helpful lessons learned. 


I went outside to see the stars after my middle of the night bathroom stop. I guess that is one advantage of being older out here! 


This morning I was on the front porch before the wake up call and one of the dads from the group couldn’t stand the snoring of his one friend and chose to sleep on the benches in the dining room. Luckily Al and I were in a separate bunk room.

Incredible views continued today! When I’ve hiked other parts of the AT you spend a lot of time in the Green Tunnel with an occasional view. With hiking higher elevations above tree lines you can see mountains in all directions when on the summits or on the ridge lines.


You have to earn the views and the first challenge was Mount Garfield (4500’) which included climbing a waterfall (allegedly a trail). From Garfield we could see Mount Lafayette (5,100’) in the distance and in the afternoon we made it to the rocky summit. Since it was Sunday the trail was still busy (trail runners, peak baggers, circuit hikers, day hikers). Quite a few hikers are from Quebec as it is fairly short distance for them. We saw Larry the Log, a veteran and thru hiker who carried a 20 lb log from Georgia to Maine as a fundraiser.


At the Greenleaf Hut Al & I talked with Turquoise (hiker from the Finger Lakes in New York). She is recently retired nurse doing another section and has hiked over 1000 AT miles. 


After dinner hiked down to Sunset Rock to check out the sunset over Echo Lake.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656873,"Another bonus of the huts is that they have coffee ready around 6 (breakfast is at 7) and sitting outside with a cup of coffee looking down a valley or up at mountain is pretty sweet. 


We hiked the 1.1 miles back up To Mount Lafayette and proceeded south on one of the most famous sections, Fraconia Ridge Trail. Although clouds completely covered the ridge in the late afternoon, our morning hike couldn’t have had better visibility (360 view). Since it was Monday the weekend crowds were gone which made for an even better experience.  While climbing down from Franconia Ridge though some boulders I had my first fall ending up on my side after underestimating my momentum coming down. Surprise and some soreness on my left side were the only effects of the fall. 


My next mishap was I only saw one sign (the second was about 8’ to my right) at a trail crossing so we ended going up and down a 4,500’ peak (Mt Liberty) and adding .6 miles to hot and humid day! 


Before we reached Lonesome Lake Hut an older hiker from England coming northbound excitedly told me he had landed in Canada, hitchhiked all the way to a nearby road crossing and he was starting his AT hike. His positive demeanor and British accent affectionately reminded me of my Uncle Jim who recently passed away.  


At the hut I went down to the dock and rinsed off while visiting with other guests. One was the extended family (kids, parents, grandparents) of a man who works for the AMC and actually started as a member of the Croo as his first job. 


Later a Bachelorette party (of 4) joined our table. The bride to be couldn’t recruit her sisters for the adventure but she and her friends were having fun.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656903,"Early cup of coffee and watching sunrise over Lonesome Lake & Franconia Ridge Trail was pretty spectacular. Oatmeal, eggs and blueberry muffin and headed down short trail to the Flume Visitor Center. The Flume is a 2 mile loop with natural gorge at the base of Mount Liberty with Avalanche Falls at top and lots of visitors and one tour bus unloaded while waited for a shuttle to the Notch Hostel. Was very strange to be with large groups of people after being on the trail for a week. Met several thru hikers including ones from Australia and the Netherlands. One common theme is that a number of AT hikers read the Bill Bryson book “A Walk in the Woods” which was very funny but didn’t seem at all accurate once I did my first hike. 


First shower in 8 days (had some stream dunks and lake rinses) felt luxurious. They also do laundry here and we took advantage of the shuttle to grocery store and Mexican restaurant. Bunk room had real sheets, comforter and pillow which was a first on this section hike.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656914,"Today was a “Zero” hiking day to avoid rain and relax before our last 4,000 footer in the White Mountains, Mount Moosilauke (4,800’). It is tough to leave the Notch Hostel as it is the nicest hostel I’ve stayed in. They have clean, comfortable bunk rooms, relaxing porches, very nice staff and we took their bikes into town and had a burger & ice cold Coke at the Woodstock Inn Brewery. Got caught in a downpour on the way back but would rather have rain today than tomorrow. 


Met a mom and 3 young daughters from Houston who are thru hiking and started their AT hike in mid February in Georgia. Later in the day met another section hiker from Texas who had recently retired and decided to hike a section in Vermont and New Hampshire. 


Nicest part of the time off was the chance to talk to my wife and family. I’ve been able to send out a daily GPS update on our progress but cellular coverage is very minimal in the first part of our trip. 


Thank you for reading my journal and for your comments in my guest journal. I’ll continue to post entries and photos as I have coverage.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656993,"Most important thing of the day was for my wife and I to connect (even if could only be by text) on our 38th wedding anniversary! I’m incredibly lucky we met and so blessed to have her as my partner and best friend. She was enroute to Montana for a trip with some of the “girls” of the neighborhood so she is having her own adventure. 


Most everyone in the hostel was awake by 6am as shuttles to the trail started leaving at 7am. A teacher who arrived yesterday with her dog Finn had brought several baked bread items for dinner last night and a banana bread for breakfast this morning- all to share with hostel guests. Finn’s cage was right next to me in the 8 person bunk room and was as good as gold. 


Climbing up Mount Moosilauke was steep with some of the trail going up the stream but with all the hype we thought it might be harder. Due to the high humidity and me sweating going up the mountain my merino wool shirt sparkled with water drops. It was foggy all the way up and cool and windy at the summit with no views due to the fog. For northbound thru hikers, Moosilauke is the highest peak since Virginia so we definitely heard some comments about it as they were hiking up. 


Hikers Welcome Hostel might remind you of an extremely rustic summer camp. The shower, washer/dryer and toilet are all outside in a row with shower curtains providing some privacy for the shower and toilet. Al and I took the shuttle for pizza, a beer and ice cream and sat in a huge seating area made of large stones around a fire pit meeting other hikers.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657039,"My resupply box was at Hikers Welcome Hostel when we arrived. Contents include tent, sleeping pad and food. Breakfast was 2 pop tarts and coffee and then we were shuttles out 10 miles for an easy hike back to the hostel.  Highest elevation for today was less than 1/2 of yesterday so we are definitely out of the White Mountains. This was my first “slack pack” where you carry only what is needed for a day hike (not much) and hike back to the hostel. We slack packed because rain was forecast and we didn’t want to hike and tent in rain.  (As you can see we are making this hike easy where possible!). Thunderstorms started with about 45 minutes left before we got back so we were soaked but coming back to a warm shower and dry bunk. Finished up leftover pizza and ice cream for lunch, took my last shower for awhile and did a load of laundry. 


Tonight picked up a Greek salad, yogurt & fruit parfait and a few fill ins for my food bag from the gas station/deli.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657085,"On the AT hikers follow 2” x 6” white blazes painted on trees or rocks to guide them on the the trail. Blue blazes indicate side trails. 


Unofficially there are also “non physical” types of blazing such as a hiker told me her now boyfriend “pink blazed” after initially meeting her on trail. (Older Definition-Pink blaze: Hiking with the intention of catching, or slowing down to meet up with a lady hiker). Last night at dinner I told a hiker we just got our tents at this hostel stop and hadn’t been tenting and she said with a smile “oh you’ve been platinum blazing” which I guess means taking advantage of luxuries like huts and hostels. 


Last night when I went outside for a bathroom stop I didn’t look up for stars I looked down and around for skunks. The hostel has a compost pile and there were three skunks enjoying it yesterday including a white skunk which is new to me but I’m not sorry I missed. 


A full pack and 4,100’ of elevation gain made a 10.3 mile day seem longer but we ended up tenting at Smarts Mountain (3,200’ elevation) which had an old Fire Tower (5 flights up) with amazing views. See photos section for additional pics. Cooked couscous with beef jerky and went back up the tower for sunset.

",Smarts Mountain ,"Aug 27, Sat",10.30
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657171,"Set alarm for 5:45am to go see sunrise from Fire Tower. One hiker slept way up there and soon about 5 others joined us. The mountain tops peaked out from the clouds and the edge clouds to the east had a bright red metallic look and the sun popped up and lit up the morning. 


Lucky, a 70 something section hiker, gave us some tips on water sources, where to watch out for bears and a potential “ice cream man”. Her tip on ice cream didn’t pan out (no sign out on the dirt road) but there were no water sources for very long stretches. We passed up a known good source but it was close to a road and a parking lot and were told about a small stream provided just what we needed for the short term. Our concern was there was no water at our planned tenting site 7 miles further and none the next day for 4 miles. Our mobile app Guthook/FarOut had a comment about a trail angel leaving gallon jugs of water at a road crossing closer to our tent site. One of the people that confirmed the water cache was Forest Grump (he doesn’t like summer heat, bugs or crowds) who is a volunteer for the Dartmouth Outdoor Center (a local AT club that maintains this section of the trail). At the road crossing 84 year old trail angel Chuck met us with a nice cold Pepsi and plenty of water. We tried to offer him some money for his supplies but he wouldn’t accept. As we continued our hike south thirsty hikers appreciated hearing water was just ahead. 


After 12.3 miles and about 3,100 ft elevation gain we reached Moose Mountain. I fixed instant shrimp-flavored ramen (no chance there was real shrimp) and added tuna to it. Two smashed up Pop Tarts for dessert completed the meal. 


Sun just went down and we are being serenaded by coyotes- not my favorite sound of nature.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657205,"Just heard the coyotes once more last night and they said hello this morning. Fairly warm night and Al and I were both up by 5:30am and left camp at 7. Ran into hiker Johnny Walker from Scotland and quite a few other hikers. One hiker told us the stream was just a mud puddle but we found a decent stream with just enough flow after that. 


Had tasty California Club sandwich and huge shake at our nephew Jack and his fiancé Lauren’s favorite breakfast spot, Lou’s in Hanover. They like the place so much they named their dog Lou. I actually had ordered a piece of pie for dessert but had to cancel it as even my “hiker hunger stomach” couldn’t tackle it. It was very noticeable that we were back in “civilization” - everyone seemed so dressed up, the road noises and smells were something I hadn’t missed. 


Next we crossed the river into Vermont! Stopped for my final food re-supply and shuttle driver for Hanover Adventure Tours Hostel picked us up. Saw a couple SOBOs who had passed us a couple days ago and met a woman from Michigan who is a NOBO with a married couple. Their goal is to reach Mount Katahdin in Maine by October 7 as it closes by October 15 or earlier based on snow.  Did laundry, shower and had some ready bake pizza and got organized for our last few days. 


Tomorrow is supposed to be almost 90 so we hired a shuttle driver to pick us up at 6:30am, the hostel shuttle doesn’t leave till after 9.

",Hanover Adventure Tours Hostel,"Aug 29, Mon",12.50
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657248,"Hostel was pretty good except we thought we were getting a room for 2 and we were in a room for 4 including a grumpy hostel employee who didn’t like sharing the room with hikers because they smell up the room and disturb his sleep when they get up early- definite lack of focus on the customer. 


After make-your-own pancakes and eggs shuttle driver picked us up and we are on trail by 6:45am. This was comparatively the easiest terrain this trip and in West Hartford, VT we were called from the front porch of the Blue Door Barn where Linda and Ray offered us coffee, cold drinks, water refills, apples and watermelon. Recently they had 60 NOBOs stop by in one day. 


You know water is scarce when the last 3 times the directions for the only spot to fill your water carrier was “see the leaf with the water going over it”!  After our final water fill up we hiked up to Thistle Hill Shelter. As expected a big storm came thru with high winds and rain pounding the metal roof of the 3-sided, 8-person shelter. Besides Al and I, hikers Digger (he liked to dig foxholes as a kid) and SideQuest (he takes time to explore and check out views) are in the shelter. SideQuest and I both picked apples from trees left in old apple orchard. Great guys who we met back at Hikers Welcome Hostel. 


Storms are expected to continue till morning and temps have dropped from over 90 to the low 70s. Hopefully trail won’t be too wet. We have 31 miles to cover in 2 days with a total of 8,600’ of ascent and 8,100’ of descent before we reach the Inn at Long Trail in Killington.

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657293,"Storms kept on rolling in through the night and the rain hammered the metal roof on the shelter. There is a unique six-sided privy for the shelter; the bottom half is wood and the top half is screens which provides a nice view looking out. The trails weren’t as muddy as we thought they might be, the ground was so dry it was ready to soak in the rain. The day was long (15.5 miles) and the terrain was tougher than yesterday but we loved the 20 degree temperature drop and nice winds. We saw a sign for a farm stand near the trail but to our dismay it is only open Thursday- Sunday. Tonight we are at the Lookout Cabin, a privately owned, fully enclosed cabin with a small deck (accessible via a steep ladder) on the top with 360 degree view of the mountains around us. We can see Mount Killington in the distance which is where we end our trip tomorrow.

",Lookout Cabin,"Aug 31, Wed",15.50
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657383,"I’m thankful that we stayed under a roof at the Lookout Cabin last night as this morning the tents were heavy with last night’s rain. Climbed the ladder to the rooftop deck where the sunrise over the mountains (see photos) was the first gift for my last day on the trail. The next gift was a temperature around 60 to help with an almost 16 mile day with ascent and descents over 4,000’ each. 


SideQuest was responsible for the next gift when he saw 2 cubs and a momma bear and waited till we caught up so I got to see them heading up a hill. Although I’ve seen several bears on other hikes these were the first ones I’ve seen on this hike (still haven’t seen a moose). 


It was a long and very rocky side trail down to the Inn at Long Trail (Al and my final destination). Al and I took a celebratory photo in front of the Inn to mark the successful end of our approximately 170 mile hike from Pinkham Notch, NH thru the White Mountains to Killington, VT! 


While Al was showering I was headed outside to hose off my shoes when I received a surprising gift- Juice, my hiking partner from last spring, had driven up from Maryland to celebrate with me (and vacation with his wife)!  He had joked with me about showing up but I never expected he would. 


Al (Webmaster), Digger, SideQuest, Juice and I gathered in the Irish Pub (where Juice and I celebrated the end our hike last spring) and easily consumed 3 course meals and a few beers. In the pub there were a NOBO couple who had just graduated college in Florida and an older couple who spend several months at the Inn visiting with hikers in the pub and doing some hikes. They travel on a motorcycle and the husband hiked most of the AT many years ago. The young couple was going to take a bus to an outfitter to buy a water reservoir but “the trail provided” and I gifted them my reservoir. 
I was really fortunate to have met Al two years ago during a rainstorm a shelter in Virginia. In addition to being a great guy, Al always had a daily hike plan plus knew how to sort thru options as we faced obstacles like weather or lack of water. He also never pushed me off the side of a mountain even when I made a mistake like the day I took a .6 mile detour up to the peak of Mount Liberty; and Al does not like heights! 


It definitely felt good completing another AT adventure. I’m very fortunate my wife is supportive of both my pre-hike prep (physical conditioning and planning) plus the extended time I spend away from home!  I also appreciate the supportive comments, texts, etc from you (my friends family and journal readers) about my hike. 

The best gift of these hikes is always the people you meet and spend time with (Special shout out to Al, Digger, SideQuest & Juice). The percentage of happy, positive hikers who are “living the dream” is really uplifting. One woman commented that, because of the common bond of the AT, they are very open about their lives and people have pretty deep conversations after just a few minutes. Some hikers come to the trail for difficult reasons- depression, loss of a family member, job burnout or an unexpected divorce and sometimes “the trail can provide” in supporting them. Out of the goodness of their heart, Trail Angels bring water, food, rides and sometimes shelter to assist tired, thirsty and hungry hikers. It is an incredibly supportive community.
Thanks for reading my journal and as hikers often say as they pass each other “Happy Trails”!
