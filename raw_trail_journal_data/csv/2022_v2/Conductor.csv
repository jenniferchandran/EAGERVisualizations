Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657443,"Virginia has always fascinated me with the variation the trail offers. Foothill pastures complete with cows, high steep ridges and remote green tunnels. The windswept high country of the Grayson highlands and Mt Rogers area cap it off before I drop into Damascus. A beautiful variety of landscapes. I have often thought about what the south bound long distance AT experience would be like. Different weather patterns, different people, with different destinations, yet still the white blaze to follow. Walking into winter instead of out of it.Living near the NCT, I follow the blue blazes during my short shakedown hikes. Guess I better recalibrate.",,View Entry,"Sep 04, Sun",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657527,"Well, this is different. Although I have been considering the weather, it doesn't factor in last minute chore around the homestead that happen prior to cold season. Get's cold enough here in SW Michigan that we have to kind of batten down the hatches, if you will pardon the cliché. Still, we had to decide to defer some of the chores until I return home. Another reason to be home in early November. Really a little freaked out that I may find a goof reason to bail and bail early. So I'm probably gonna edit this for a while until I don't have any reason to doubt myself.A few items for my bear canister and I'll be fully loaded for trail. and looking to start by the end of the week.",,View Entry,"Sep 05, Mon",0

Left Harper's Ferry Quality Inn, on a convenient side trail that connects with the AT at 0730 with a slack pack for an 11.5 mile trip to Blackburn trail center, where Beth would pick me up. Not many people out there today, but I did meet a few hikers. 
Many deer in the woods and I guess it must not be a hunting area, because none of them hurried away. They appeared thin, which doesn't add up. But maybe I haven't been that close to deer in a while. I heard but didn't see a cuckoo. Only one annoying bug. Oh and a huge black rat snake.
Beth will be leaving tomorrow. It's full pack time. Right before a section of trail called the roller coaster. Whatever possessed me to start with this stretch I dunno. It's not really that bad, but it does have some ups and downs. 
Thinking of staying at Bears Den hostel tomorrow night.","Harper's Ferry

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657733,"The Bears Den trail center is someplace I missed on my previous hikes thru this region. It just never did fit into my itineraries. I'm sure there is enough history here to fill a book. One of those stone buildings dating back to days when they built thinks to last.
Only a ten bunk hostel, but tenting and private room available, and the grounds are worth a stop. Actually quite a beautiful setting,with stone fences and manicured lawns.
Strangely, the eight miles even with full pack didn't take as much out of me as yesterday's light pack day of 11.5 miles. I think I'll opt for short mile days. Today was strange. Saturday hikers, lots of em. I was going to keep a tally of critters versus humans, but except for the dogs humans were too many to count. Headed, likely for a viewpoint called Buzzard Rocks I hiked past today.
Looks like rain tonight and into tomorrow. I think I could rationalize and avoid it by staying here, but that doesn't get me along the trail. I'll do the miles tomorrow and stay on my light schedule. It's nice to just meander through the woods without a deadline.","Blackburn trail center 
",Bears Den Trail Center,"Sep 10, Sat",7.90
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657862,"I left the hostel this morning at 10:00 hoping the rain would lighten up. Didn't really make any difference. I was soaking wet by the first of eight hills in the hot weather.
I stopped, a lot. Course made good at 1 mph. Half a typical day's pace. Had pancakes for breakfast, but I screwed up and didn't leave a full days rations out of thr bear can. Only a Lara bar and a cream pie about 350 calories. 
As I topped the last peak and started the final decent of the day. I started getting dizzy. I stopped and felt my arms start vibrating. Rats. Nothing like exploding one's pack on the trail. I did what I had to do. Dug out the bear canister and wolfed doun a few peanut m&ms. Laid out my foldable mattress and took a siesta. It was still daylight when I reached the shelter, not by much.
A nobo section hiker named Buck was already settled in, so I opted for my tent. So here I am fed, watered, and secure in my Nemo. It's a hot and humid night and the cacophony is in full swing.
One parting shot, before I sleep for my alliterative daughters.
I prudently pushed past a perfect pawpaw today.","Bears Den Trail Center
",Rod Hollow,"Sep 11, Sun",9.80
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657864,"08:50 Man and woman with dogs appeared traveling to spring. 
The Rod Hollow cacophony continued through the night. Thousands of creatures feeling the warm humid night. In their element, their time to sing! Glorious! I found my ear plugs and rolled over.
The nine miles to Whiskey Hollow shelter went by fast today, even though I stopped several times to eat and wring out my shirt. Oh yes, wringing out the shirt because the humidity simply overwhelms any evaporation. But that's a part of this trail. Particularly this area of Northern Virginia. Thunder started two miles out, light rain began as I turned off the main trail. Main storms moved in after I arrived. Decided to sleep in the shelter tonight. 
Gonna be a full shelter tonight.","Rod Hollow
",Whiskey Hollow,"Sep 12, Mon",9
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657865,"Ten people at Whiskey Hollow shelter last night. Not to complain, but I'll take the bug singing over a shelter chorus any day.
As is my custom, I was the last one on trail, leaving at 10:00 with plenty of time left in the day to relax at a shelter I have not had the privilege of staying at before. It's a short day into Front Royal tomorrow, so the Jim & Molly Denton shelter was worked into the plan this time. Although I didn't use it, there is a solar shower here.
The weather changed slightly and today was less humid. I reckon anything would be better to hike in than yesterday's 99% humidity. Anyway, the drier air made the hike quite enjoyable today.
Maybe partially due to the weather change, but I found my hiker hunger today. What a relief. It compounds the difficulty when I can't eat what I brought. My food canister has way too much food left in it as I end the first leg of the journey tomorrow and go into town for a resupply. Ideally it should be empty. Oh, and I don't know where I'm goin, but I am going to eat a big meal in town.","Whiskey Hollow
",Denton shelter,"Sep 13, Tue",10
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657908,"Short day into town to clean up a little and replenish. I'm going to take a planned zero miles day tomorrow. I feel good, probably could just move on tomorrow, but I'd rather give this old body a fighting chance, and I'm not pressured for time. A day of recovery won't set me back. In fact it will give me extra time to plan for Shenandoah NP. A hundred mile stretch with occasional cheeseburgers. Some say that makes it easy, for me it takes a little extra planning.
The plan is to bump my miles going forward. Not sure I want to, but it kinda makes sense in the SNP because the shelters tend to be 15 miles apart. Just a reference to go by and I will probably camp in the woods anyway. 
Mountain home is a sweet B&B with hostel. Listed in the Nation Register of Historic Places, the complete details thoroughly documented in a binder for guests to read.  Only a couple minutes off trail. Scott and Lisa are super nice folks, and I marvel at how they do it. It's a large house with parts dating back to the 1700s and a small side cabin called the Cabbin, that sleeps eight. Kitchen, bath, free lemonade. I think there is also a bunkhouse and, of course, the main house where everyone can mingle. Excellent, by the Conductor hostel rating scale. Tell ya bout the breakfast tomorrow.","Denton shelter
",Mountain Home B&B,"Sep 14, Wed",5
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657947,"Today I did only minor physical exertion. The intent of this slothery rests on mending whatever needed mending in the tissues of my body. Mainly because my itinerary tomorrow may include the longest milage day thus far and it's generally up hill. That's the plan Stan... 
Now, I'm sure some younger folks will not understand the need for recovery as I see it. It's a learning experience sixty or so years usually. I feel good tonight. The burden of tomorrow's climb into the SNP isn't really on my mind.
I'm not hungry, no cravings, and I have food that doesn't make me gag. All balanced positive. That gag part can be difficult after starring down yet another energy bar. I know I can resupply at the park waysides, but I just don't want to risk the variety until my hunger gets stronger. Meanwhile, protein and starch in palatable portions.
I did want to mention my super power. She only stands about 5'2"", but that doesn't stop her from lifting me up. I can do this because she supports me in every endeavor and encourages me to pursue my goals. Beth, my super power.","Mountain Home B&B

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658251,"Gotta love national park trails; made the day easy. Into the SNP we climb, while barely noticing. It's Friday, it's still the warm season of September and as expected the hut and vicinity are peopled. The solitary experience remains elusive. 
I got to camp first, because it was still early afternoon. Did chores, ate my instant potatoes and non-gmo extra premium line caught Albacore tuna which diminished the yum of the potatoes, but got some protein in me.
Tomorrow, I'm going to push a little harder. Eat something decadent from the grill at Elk Wallow wayside and see if I can't find a suitable dispersed sight.
Reporting back. Breakfast at Mountain Home was eggs and fruit and homemade jams for the toast and various juices. Vegetarian without the guilt trip, know what I mean...I hear the French toast was delicious, but my vote goes to the scramble.","Mountain Home

Pass Mountain
Kinda tired tonight. Stopped and got the Elkwallow Burger at the wayside, with  a side of absolutely delicious kettle chips.
Saw a whitetail buck and might have got a picture. Still no bear,but I did come across some scat with what appeared to be cherry pits in it.
Short one tonight. Long day tomorrow.","Gravel Springs hut.
",Pass Mountain hut,"Sep 17, Sat",13
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658253,"As I sat in silence this morning, listening to the forest, it occurred to me that my day was going to a be a long one. 
Fast forward 12 hours and 15.4 miles later. Here I am feeling better about my plan. 3600+ feet ascent today at intervals. Took me 9 hours, but I feel pretty good so... Yesterday's hike took more energy resources for some reason. Maybe the climb over Pass Mountain at the end of the day.
Today I drank 4 liters of water, but missed a spring and ended up at Pinefield hut running on empty. One of the liters had Mio lemon lime with electrolytes mixed in. Kinda good, went down fast.
Here I sit, listening to the forest. Looking forward to a shorter day tomorrow as I pass through Big Meadows wayside area. It's a beautiful orange sun sinking over the mountains in the distance. Nice to watch the sunset from a campsite. Doesn't happen every day.","Pass Mountain hut

The shorter day made my feet happy. The cheeseburger with everything on it made my half mile off trail excursion worthwhile. But the salad I carried out from the wayside and enjoyed in camp made my day. This wilderness stuff is hard, I tell ya.
A few less people on the trails of SNP today. Probably because it's Monday, but the weather held clear most of the day. A few sprinkles here and there, but I may have to pack a wet tent tomorrow. I'm at Bearfense hut, but I chose to camp in my tent 1rather than stay in the shelter.
I have yet to see a bear, although there is sign of them about. I've usually seen a few by now in the SNP. Maybe tomorrow. 
Half way thru Shenandoah NP, with eight days planned. I passed 100 miles today somewhere around the cheeseburger. Still lots of views along the trail, but I haven't been taking the side trail rock scrambles. Just really too many to visit them all.","Rock Spring hut
",Bearfense Mountain hut,"Sep 19, Mon",11.50
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658256,"Another beautiful sunset, another night in my comfy little tent. Five nights of listening to the bug and frogs and owls. 
The nights have been warm and so have the mornings. Hiking during the day thru the green tunnel I'm glad for the shade. It's kinda hot out here for climbing hills with a backpack. I dunno, some folks like 85° weather for hiking. I've spoken to a few sobos now and for the most part they know they need to hurry. It won't be warm forever and there's high country ahead. The nobos deal with cold weather at the beginning of their thru hike. It's the opposite for sobos. I don't envy them needing to add winter gear to their summer packs.
Five days in the park and still no bears, strange for this park.","Bearfense Mountain hut
",Hightop hut,"Sep 20, Tue",12.40
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658257,"Having a difficult time putting today in perspective. I had a salad at the Loft Mountain wayside. Where I arrived at around 3 pm via a side trail. Then rejoined the AT later at Loft Mt campground. According to the FarOut app I made 17.6 miles south today. Oh, I also downed a quart of Gatorade, while the tourists eyed me as sus. I must be a wild sight indeed for some of these folks who have no idea about the AT.
It was hot today and my t-shirt was thoroughly soaked. I had been hiking for 5 hours in 85 degree weather climbing and descending over 3600 feet. Probably looked like bona-fide hiker trash. Well, that's what we call ourselves, eh? Reckon I coulda taken a shower, since I walked right by them later at the campground store. Nah. Why bother. I made several miles on with the easy trail south of the campground.","Hightop hut
",Sobomile 1304,"Sep 21, Wed",17.60
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658258,"I have hiked 150 miles with 11 or so remaining until Waynesboro. That's enough for now. I finally found solitude enough by choosing another non imposing dispersed site. One problem with that. The water needs to be abundant enough to allow for camping where there isn't any.
This has been a dry time for the Shenandoah NP. Some of the springs are pretty low, or dry. I passed on a chance today to divert .2 miles to Blackrock hut today to fill up with water. Luckily I was able to yogi a liter, from a nice young couple from New Jersey. 
Anyway, a cold front is passing thru on this last evening in the woods. At least my last day will be pleasant hiking weather. I've ascended 30089 feet and decended nearly the same. The weather up until this afternoon has been warm and humid. So humid nothing dried on the line last night. This afternoon I noticed my shirt had dried out. First time that has happened. 
Another beautiful sunset tonight. I think tomorrow maybe a cooler hike.","Sobomile 1304
",Sobomile 1317,"Sep 22, Thu",13.30
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658259,"The front passed thru last evening, negating the sound of the night creatures and bringing with it wonderfully cool weather. The last day of hiking was certainly the most comfortable. I even started out with my fleece. Last night I put on my down jacket. Two items I've been carry and not using. Glad I had them.
I traveled the length of the SNP without seeing a single bear. That was unusual. Maybe the food is more plentiful at lower elevation. 
I walked into Rockfish gap today, got a ride to town and ordered my standard veggie pizza. Don't know why, I don't do any meat on a trail pizza. My body says eat a veggie pizza. I comply, although I am a registered omnivore. 
I'm not going to lie. Most of the hiking days were a slog, reminiscent of the thru hikes during hot weather. The sobo experience was altogether different than the nobo. Finding a campsite was never a problem, unlike the nobo experience. In my case traveling at approximately half speed I didn't really get to know any of the Sobos, but there were an appropriate amount of them. All in all, seemed like the resources, were not stressed, as they are with the Nobo season. It's evident along the trail that the impact is growing.","Somewhere flat and secluded.
