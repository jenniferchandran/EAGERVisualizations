Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517779,"Well, this is my first go at starting my trail journal. Hope it displays alright.I've always dreamed about hiking the AT, and, back in August my wife Terri said why don't you do it?, you're not getting any younger...I'm 54 years old. I do have a little hiking/backpacking experience, but it has been a while (14 years to be exact) since I have hiked any distance. I lived in the Seattle area for 11 years and did some week long backpack trips in the Olympic National Forest, and on the Wonderland Trail at Mount Rainer....beautiful part of the country I might add. Anyway, 5 or 6 months is too long to be away from home, so I'm going to divide my ""thru"" hike into 2 sections: my plans are to hike from Springer to HF beginning in late April, 2016; and then hike from HF to Katahdin the following year. I retired from the US Navy in 2005, submarine force. My wife Terri and I live in Port Orange, Florida. Training for my AT hike is a bit of a challenge here in Florida, seeing that I live on a gigantic sand bar, with the only elevation gain/loss in the area being the Port Orange bridge....more about my training/preparation in journals to come...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517844,"Here's what I've been doing to get in hiking shape....I joined LA Fitness back in January and have been working out there 4-5 times per week. I lift weights twice a week to increase my overall body strength; not wanting to bulk up, just to better my body tone. I do cardio usually twice a week, and hike twice a week. For my cardio workout, I usually walk on an incline treadmill for an hour, then hit the stair stepper for 30 minutes. My ""hikes"" are normally 6-12 mile walks on the beach; on 1/2 of the beach walks I will carry 10 to 20 pounds with me. I will increase the weight as my AT hike gets closer; I'll also increase my hikes per week as time gets closer. I've also done a few 10 mile hikes on the Florida Trail near Ocala. After the New Year, I'll do some overnighters there to make sure my gear is good to go.I've been getting my hike gear over the last month. So far I've got my tent, backpack, sleeping bag, trail runners, stove, and some clothes. I just ordered my trekking poles this morning...more on my hiking gear a little later. I remember when I did my hiking /backpacking when I lived in Washington State, my old external frame REI Wonderland backpack weighed 54 lbs for a 1 week hike! I did 7 days on the Elwha River Trail...the scenery was beautiful, but the hiking was pure torture. I had my almost 3 lb. Vasque Sundowner full leather hiking boots, and my feet were shot after 7 days....blisters everywhere!I plan on reducing my pack weight this time around to 25-27 lbs. I've been gaining great hiking/backpacking knowledge the last 4 months reading Whiteblaze and the AT Section Hiker magazines. It is so much easier today to get information, and I've been asking questions on Whiteblaze. Thank you to everyone who have answered my questions. I've also been reading some hikers trail journals...much great info. to get from them also. Thank you for all of your insight and information to those who keep trail journals....thank you especially to Redbeard, Neemor, Airlock, and Yoda.",,Training,"Nov 30, Mon",0
Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517992,"Today felt like Christmas morning! I received three packages today...one was my packa, the second one was my therm-o-rest sleep pad, and the third was my REI Revelcloud jacket. Yesterday I received my Black Diamond Z Pole trekking poles,my esbit stove fuel tabs, and a long and short sleeve icebreaker merino wool shirt(s). I'm still waiting on my esbit stove, a couple pair of darn tough socks, a pair of Columbia hiking pants that convert to shorts, and a therm-o-rest z-seat.
The picture is my Sierra Designs Flashlight 1 tent that I set up in my backyard a few weeks ago...
I've got about 80% of my gear....I'll be doing some overnighters in Ocala National Forest to test out my gear, probably after the New Year.
I already have three pair of New Balance trail runners, which I've already tested on some hikes. I also have an Osprey Exos 58 backpack which i tested out last week. I have not used my Marmot Never Winter sleeping bag yet... 
I walked eleven miles this morning on the beach....legs are feeling good and getting stronger. I worked out yesterday at LA Fitness on the incline tread mill and stair stepper for 90 minutes.
Getting excited about the AT even though it's still over four months away.....

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518265,"Well, there has been a slight change of plans...I was originally set to begin my AT hike on 4/25/16. I have changed it to 4/21/16. My wife Terri and I wanted to stay at the Amicalola Falls Lodge on the 23rd and 24th of April, which is a Saturday and Sunday night, and I would hike out the morning of the 25th, which is a Monday. I found that the Lodge was booked up for those two nights, so I got us a room at the Lodge on the 19th and 20th of April, and I will hike out on Thursday morning, the 21st of April. Yesterday, I also registered with the ATC, and registered for hiking out from the Approach Trail on 4/21. With all of the expected hikers this coming year, I wanted to make sure that I'm good to go on the 21st...The attached picture is of me taken on the AT at Newfound Gap back in 2012. I had no idea at the time that I would be hiking the AT 4 years later! I am so psyched!I hiked 13 miles on the beach yesterday; it was a beautiful day here in Florida, breezy and in the mid 70's. My legs feel good....will be hitting the incline treadmill today for 90 minutes.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518509,"I've spent the last week continuing to work out and fool with my gear. Yesterday, I got my Roll Top Waterproof Food Bag and a Tyvek Ground Sheet from Z-PACKS. The food bag holds 5 days of food, and, since it is waterproof, can be used as my bear bag at night. I am going to use the tyvek ground sheet as my tent footprint. I am putting it thru a couple of wash cycles as I write this update. Have been told that washing it a few times will ""soften"" it up so it won't be so crinkly. I also bought a grommet kit for installing them on the footprint.The picture is of my Esbit Stove...it's lightweight and has no parts that can break; also, no heavy gas canister to bring. I'll use 2 fuel tabs per day...they come in a pack of 12, so a pack will last for 6 days.I'll keep boxes of the fuel tabs in my bounce box, and resupply them every couple of weeks. I do need to build a wind screen for it, probably out of thick aluminum foil...I also found out I'll be able to use my trekking poles with my tent....my poles are not adjustable, so I was afraid they would not be the right length for the tent. But my 2 vertical tent poles are the exact same length as my trekking poles, 46 inches. So I'm pretty excited about that; will be able to save me a little more weight...I hiked 8 miles yesterday along the beach with my Osprey Exos 58 backpack with 21 pounds of gear and water. I love the backpack; didn't feel like I was carrying anything! I'm guessing I'll have between 28-31 pounds loaded with my gear, 5 days of food, and 2 liters of water.Everyone have a Merry Christmas!

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518846,"I'm ramping up my training a little more each week as April 2016 gets closer and closer. I hiked eight miles yesterday with my pack at 27lbs, the weight at which I expect to be carrying on the AT. The legs are feeling good; wasn't too sore afterwards yesterday...Ran for 30 minutes today on the treadmill at LA Fitness, then did an hour on the stair machine...a good leg/cardio workout. I'm still lifting weights twice a week to increase my overall body strength.I made a few changes with my gear...I'll talk more about that on my next journal entry.I still need to make my tent footprint out of the tyvek sheet I have. I'll be doing that soon as well...Everyone have a Happy New Year...will talk more later...

It is all presently in a large box in my garage. I'm going to bring everything inside and lay it all out on the bed in our guest bedroom so I can visually see everything I have, That way, I can put the final touches on what I need for my hike.I got a pair of crocs from Walmart the other day for my camp shoes, and a pair of small bic lighters.77 days and counting until the Approach Trail!

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520824,"Well, I brought all of my gear inside from the garage yesterday and placed it on the guestroom bed. The picture is everything I have minus my sleeping bag, which was in the closet when I took the picture. I thought I was going to need a few more pieces of clothing, but I still had some polyester long johns and shirts from my hiking days back in the early 2000's when I lived in the Pacific Northwest. I believe I have everything I need except for the first three or four days of food I'll be taking with me.I will make a bounce box that I'll mail a couple of weeks ahead of me. I believe the first place I will mail it will be in Hiawassee, Georgia. I still need to make up a list of items that I will include in my bounce box.Of course, my female cat Smoltzie had to get in the picture with my gear. She loves laying/sleeping on my REI Revelcloud Jacket, which is very soft.My calf muscle that I aggravated the other day feels much better; I'm going to do an eight mile hike tomorrow at the St. Francis trail in Ocala national Forest...I'll let you know how that went tomorrow.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520851,"I hiked the St. Francis Trail in the Ocala National Forest the other day. I ended up hiking 9 1/2 miles, mostly in the rain and very sloppy trail conditions. In many areas I was trying to walk on the edge of the trail to stay out of the water, but there were some areas where I just had to walk through the large puddles of up to a foot of water. By the half way point, my shoes were totally soaked, so I just hiked straight thru the water; my shoes were not going to get any wetter! I know there will be days like this on the AT, so it was good training. My Marmot rain jacket kept the upper half of my body nice and dry. It was around 60 degrees, so I had the pit zips open on the jacket, which kept me from sweating too bad underneath.My legs felt good during the hike, but my calf is still a little sore from when I tweaked it last week. I stretched it out yesterday at LA Fitness, and did a slow walk on the treadmill to loosen it up.I'm going to go do a beach walk over in Daytona Beach Shores today; will go about 8 miles if the calf feels alright...I'm planning on doing an overnighter later this week with a mostly full pack if the calf is good....looking forward to taking all of my gear out and testing it.....supposed to be in the low 30's at night later in the week...will see how my 30 degree sleeping bag does...I'm sure I'll be wearing some layers inside of my bag to stay warm.I did make my tent footprint a few weeks ago out of a tyvek sheet. I installed grommets on it at the tie off points.The picture is of the St. Francis Trail from the other day...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520891,"So I hiked yesterday at the beach....8 miles...it was chilly (for Florida) and windy. I was warm and dry in my merino wool icebreaker long sleeve shirt and my windproof Marmot rain jacket. I also wore my Columbia hiking pants that convert to shorts for the first time....they fit good and are very lightweight. The legs felt good for the most part...my left calf muscle was still a little sore...but not to the point where I couldn't hike. Today, there is some general soreness there...not too bad.I wear prescription glasses, but decided I am not going to take them on the trail. I have heard and read too many stories where hikers leave their glasses behind at a camp spot, or when they take a rest/food break. My eye sight is not terrible, so not having my prescription glasses with me will not be a problem. I'm going to go buy a nice pair of non-prescription sunglasses today, along with a strap to hold them around my neck (forgot what those straps are called...).I am also going to use trekking poles with me on this hike (for the first time...). I saw a you tube video the other day on how to properly walk with them and use them on the up and down hills. I found out I had been using them all wrong. So I used the proper technique yesterday...it was slow going at first, but after doing it the right way for a couple of miles, I was walking smoothly with the poles and not even thinking about it. So yesterday was a great hike in that regard...Later today I'm going to fully pack my backpack getting ready for my overnighter in Ocala National Forest on Thursday.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521058,"Well, I did my overnighter last night at Juniper Springs on the Florida Trail in Ocala National Forest. It went well. I only hiked in 3 miles before I found a nice camp spot amongst a meadow of tall pines and palm brush. It was in the low 60’s yesterday, and got down to 40 degrees early this morning. I stayed warm in my 30 degree Marmot sleeping bag…I had on two light merino wool shirts, a pair of long underwear, and a pair of wigwam socks, along with an OR fleece hat to cover my ears. My sleeping pad was comfortable, but I know it’ll take me a few weeks on the trail to get used to sleeping on the ground. I hear from many AT hikers that when you’re hiking up and down mountains all day that sleeping isn't usually a problem.I was thinking to myself as I was setting up camp that it has been 15 years since I last spent a night in the woods….October of 2001 to be exact. I was in Olympic National Forest in Washington State, and I shipped out to Hawaii soon after that last hike, where I spent the last 4 years of my Navy career.My pack was at 22 pounds with one day of food and a 2 liters of water. I need to go thru my gear with a fine tooth comb here in the next few weeks; I want to get my pack a few pounds lighter. I don’t want to be over 28 pounds, and thats with 5 days of food.I took my time setting up camp seeing it had been a while since I have done it. I figure each time I do it, I’ll shave off more time for setting up. I’m sure after a month on the AT, I’ll be able to do it blindfolded in just a few minutes…The only “lessons learned” moment was in the middle of the night when I had to urinate. I brought a collapsible bottle to use for just that purpose; so I do not have to get out of the tent in the middle of the night to go No. 1…Anyway, I couldn’t get the dang bottle open, so I had to go outside to go no.1 anyway…After it got dark, I went for a 1 mile night hike to test out my Petzl (sp?) headlamp. There are 2 different light settings on it, and it puts out a lot of light! It’s about the same as hiking in daylight. That’s good to know if I ever need to hike after dark.The stars were awesome last night, and I got to watch a crescent moon fall in the sky, and set around 9:30.I used my esbit stove for dinner…it took 4 minutes to bring the water to a boil. I then had Mountain House beef stew…not too bad…All in all, not a bad first night back in the woods….

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521157,"The attached picture is my first attempt at hanging a bear bag in 15 years! I think I did alright. I know it's supposed to be 10 feet off the ground and 10 feet from the tree trunk. I believe I was pretty close. It was still there the next morning, so I suppose it was ""mission accomplished""...
I took my full pack minus food for a 6 mile hike on the beach today. Legs felt good. That's all for now...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521434,"So I hiked 9 miles today at the beach with 25 lbs in my pack...legs a little sore afterwards, but just general soreness. I was thinking about some things about the upcoming hike...63 days until I begin...but whose counting?...I don't want to stay in the shelters, unless I absolutely have to. I also will not cook where I camp. I plan on stealth camping as much as possible...I'll pack up each morning, hike an hour or two, then take a break and have breakfast. My lunch will be ""on the go"" in the early afternoon. I'll have dinner on the trail, then hike a while longer to a stealth camp spot. I only want to carry a liter of water with me, so I will ""camel up"" at the water sources. I know things change on the trail, and I won't always be able to do these things depending on where I am and weather conditions....I also need to make a concerted effort to only hike 6-10 miles a day for the first week or so, seeing that I haven't been able to train on hills or mountains....kinda flat here in Florida! Also, to take everything a week at a time; not to look too far ahead, and to enjoy the whole experience,and not get wrapped up in ""getting the miles in"".These were just a few of the things I was thinking about while I hiked today. The mind does tend to wonder while you're hiking!


Bubblehead",,Some thoughts...,"Feb 19, Fri",0
Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521731,"Well, I have a little change of plans....I will now start the approach trail on April 8 instead of the 21st. The reason I am moving it up a couple of weeks is so I have a better chance of reaching Katahdin before October 1st...that's right, I am now going to thru hike the trail this year! 
If you've been reading my journal, I was supposed to stop at Harpers Ferry, and hike the second half of the trail in 2017. The last few weeks, my wife has told me to go ahead and hike the whole thing, if I want to. She brought it up again this morning, and I finally decided to do it. 
I need to change a few things gear wise....other than that, I'm ready to go. I'm getting a packa for my rain/wind protection; it's much lighter and takes up less space in my pack tham my current rain jacket. I'm also debating whether to get a warmer sleeping bag. I now have a 30 degree bag, and also have a silk bag liner which is supposed to give me 5 more degrees of warmth, so I'm actually covered down to 25 degrees. Problem is, I'm sure there will be a few nights, maybe more, where it will dip below 25 degrees after April 8th; but I don't really want to spend more money on another sleeping bag.
I just read the book ""Appalachian Trials"", and am currently reading ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"". 
I am still fidgeting with my pack, trying to get some more weight off. My pack weight w/out food water is currently 19-20 pounds...I would like to shave another pound or two off of that. I will.
Going to go back to the Florida Trail tomorrow and hike 10 miles w/ a full pack. Talk again soon.",,Change of plans,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521878,"I hiked 9 miles yesterday at Bear Pond Trailhead in the Seminole National Forest with 27 lbs in my pack.My legs felt good and my backpack feels good with that amount of weight. I don't want any more than 30 lbs in my pack max. I downloaded the Guthook app for this section of the Florida Trail to try out. I like it a lot, and am thinking about getting the Guthook app for the AT.I also ordered a set of carbide tips for my Black Diamond trekking poles. I've been told the rubber tips do not last very long. I believe I have just about everything I need for my thru hike, minus food and water. I'm still waiting for my silk sleeping bag liner to come in the mail from REI.I also used my Sawyer Mini filter for the first time. The water I filtered had a brown tint to it, but I did not get sick, so I believe the filter works alright...I have a question concerning documenting your hike while on trail that hopefully someone can help me with... I know that while hiking, if you don't have cell/internet coverage, you can still document your hike daily in the notes section of your i phone; then when you get coverage a few days later, you can go back and copy and paste it into your trail journals page. My question is, how do you copy and paste with the i phone? Have already copied and pasted an entry using my i mac at home...so I see how that works. But using the i phone? not sure...I documented todays entry onto my notes app on my i phone, but could not figure out how to copy/paste it to trail journals using the i phone. Please help!

The right knee was a little sore during the hike, but it feels fine tonight as I write this post...
I got seven days worth of food yesterday and boxed it up to mail to Fontana Dam for my stint thru Smoky Mountain National Park; I'll have my wife mail it about a week before I get there. I'm also getting my bounce box ready to go.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522666,"I did another day hike with full pack yesterday along the Florida Trail in Seminole National Forest....I hiked 12 miles....body felt good....pretty sore this morning; to be expected...There were actually some other hikers out since it was the weekend. 
A number of hikers were interested when I told them I was going to do a thru hike of the AT. Of course, all of the normal hiker questions were asked...Are you hiking with someone?... Won't you be lonely hiking by yourself?...Are you bringing a gun for protection?...Will you bring a big knife with you?...What about the bears?...Did you see the movie ""A walk in the woods""?...Pretty funny....
I got my packa in the mail the other day and tried it on over my pack....it's nice and light...7 ounces. My old rain jacket was 16 ounces, so I'm saving a little more weight. I had 4 days of food in my pack yesterday, along with a liter of water...came in at 28 lbs. I figure when I load out with 5 days of food, my pack will be 29-30 lbs. I think I can deal with that...of course, over the next few weeks, I'm going to see if I can shed another pound or two off of that...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522994,"This is my first post inside my tent. Guess I better get used to this! I hiked in about 5 1/2 miles to a camp area called ""Hidden Pond"" on the Florida Trail in the Juniper Prarie Wilderness of the Ocala National Forest. 
The pond is spring fed and the water is crystal clear. 
I got a late start today, and didn't get to the campsite until just an hour before sunset. So I didn't light off my esbit stove; I had a snickers bar for dinner. I had just enough time to set up my tent and get everything organized before it got dark. I did not need to use my headlamp. 
I found out tonight that I can use my trekking poles instead of my tent poles, so that will save me some more weight. The rubber tips I was using in my trekking poles would not fit in the tent grommet hole, but the new carbide tips I installed on my trekking poles last week do fit. Awesome!
It's a very comfortable tonight...clear with temps down in the mid 50's.
One month from today I will have just hiked the Approach Trail to Springer Mountain and my AT hike will have begun.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523069,"Here are some fun facts about the Appalachian Trail...The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest continuously marked footpaths in the world, measuring roughly 2,180 miles in length. The Trail goes through fourteen states along the crests and valleys of the Appalachian mountain range from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia, to the Trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin, Maine. 
Known as the “A.T.,” it has been estimated that 2-3 million people visit the Trail every year and about 1,800–2,000 people attempt to “thru-hike” the Trail. People from across the globe are drawn to the A.T. for a variety of reasons: to reconnect with nature, to escape the stress of city life, to meet new people or deepen old friendships, or to experience a simpler life.
The A.T. was completed in 1937 and is a unit of the National Park System. The A.T. is managed under a unique partnership between the public and private sectors that includes, among others, the National Park Service (NPS), the USDA Forest Service (USFS), an array of state agencies, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and 31 local Trail-maintaining clubs.
FUN FACTS
• The Trail is roughly 2,180 miles long, passing through 14 states.
• Thousands of volunteers contribute roughly 220,000 hours to the A.T. every year.
• More than 250 three-sided shelters exist along the Trail.
• Virginia is home to the most miles of the Trail (about 550), while West Virginia is home to the least (about 4).
• Maryland and West Virginia are the easiest states to hike; New Hampshire and Maine are the hardest.
• The total elevation gain of hiking the entire A.T. is equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 times.
• The A.T. is home to an impressive diversity of plants and animals. Some animals you may see include black bears, moose, porcupines, snakes, woodpeckers, and salamanders. Some plants you may encounter include jack-in-the-pulpit, skunk cabbage, and flame azalea.
HIKERS
• About 2 to 3 million visitors walk a portion of the A.T. each year.
• The A.T. has hundreds of access points and is within a few hours drive of millions of Americans, making it a popular destination for day-hikers.
• “Thru-hikers” walk the entire Trail in a continuous journey. “Section-hikers” piece the entire Trail together over years. “Flip-floppers” thru-hike the entire Trail in discontinuous sections to avoid crowds, extremes in weather, or start on easier terrain.
• 1 in 4 who attempt a thru-hike successfully completes the journey
• Most thru-hikers walk north, starting in Georgia in spring and finishing in Maine in fall, taking an average of 6 months.
• Foods high in calories and low in water weight, such as Snickers bars and Ramen Noodles, are popular with backpackers, who can burn up to 6,000 calories a day.
• Hikers usually adopt “trail names” while hiking the Trail. Of course, mine is ""Bubblehead"" which is a nickname for Naval personnel who served in the Submarine force.
I love the saying...""No pain, no rain, no Maine""...

I walked 5 miles along the beach up to Daytona Beach to take a look at all the motorcycles, because it is ""bike week"" here. It is crazy crowded here with people bringing their bikes from all over the country.
I think I've decided to go with just Aquamira for my water filtration system. I don't care too much for my Sawyer Mini water filter. The Aquamira has a slight chlorine taste, but I believe the water tastes fine.
I'm to the point now where I'm getting tired of the day and overnight hikes to get myself ready...and I'm tired of working out at LA Fitness...and I'm tired of planning for the hike. I am ready to go right now! Enough of the prepping...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524690,"Two weeks from tomorrow my wife will drop me off a mile from Springer for the beginning of my AT thru hike. As the time draws nearer, I am having many mixed emotions about what I'm about to do. Am I ready? I've been training physically for this for the last eight months. I think, physically speaking, I've done about all I can do to get ready. The last few weeks I've been doing 1 1/2 to 2 hrs a day of incline treadmill work with my full pack to get my legs ready. The only thing I have not been able to train for are the downhills. I know the first 3 or 4 weeks on the trail I will have to take the downhills very slowly. I must make myself keep my distance at around eight miles a day for the first few weeks, even if my body tells me I can do more. I do not need to be in a hurry, and set goals for a week at a time, and not on Katahdin...and to slowly increase my mileage as time goes on...The part that I do not know how I will react will be the mental aspect of a thru hike. I spent 20 years on submarines in the Navy and went thru many hardships there, both physical and mental.....I think I am mentally strong....but won't truly know until I get out there....going thru days and days of rain, mud, roots, slippery rocks, the constant up and downs, hunger, cold, insects, etc.I love challenges, and am greatly looking forward to this one...I am looking forward to meeting hikers and picking there brains about what works for them; all of us with the same goal, helping and supporting each other as we hike day after day, and week after week...I'm looking forward to the simplicity of the trail....going to bed when the sun sets, and waking up when it rises. I'm looking forward to the quietness and calmness of the trail....I believe time on the trail gives us time to think about our life and people/loved ones in our life on a more deeper level and time to sit back and think how truly I am appreciative of those who are most important to me...my wife Terri who is so unselfish and giving and who is letting me do this hike. I worry about leaving her for up to 6 months, but she is a very strong and independent person, and of course she keeps telling me ""I will be just fine""...I will also miss my 2 cats....Bama and Smoltzie....I wonder what they will be thinking when I am not around??? I know Terri will take great care of them as she always does...Anyway, thats just a few of the things that start swirling around in my head each night when I go to bed....2 weeks to go, and I'm very excited about what is to come.....

Yesterday, I sprayed my backpack, clothes, and trail runners with permethrin. They are all airing out today in my garage. Rain is called for here in Florida thru Monday...so Tuesday I'll set up my tent in the yard and spray it with permethrin. After my tent drys I'll probably pack my backpack for Georgia on Wednesday.
I'm getting ready to head to LA Fitness to do my 2 hours of incline treadmill work. I'm thinking my last workout day will be next Saturday. I figure I'll rest all of my muscles and joints for 5 days before getting ready to leave on the eighth.

Other than that, I think I'm ready....a few more things to square up here at home...Terri's having a ""kick my ass out the door""party on Sunday with around 15 people over...we smoked some butts and chicken yesterday, and other family members and friends will be bringing side dishes...lots of good food!I'm thinking my next journal entry will be from Georgia!

The views of the falls were outstanding as I climbed the stairs beside them; especially at the bottom looking up. The day was cold and windy, even with a little sleet mixed in.

I got to Black Gap shelter at 2:30 and stopped there, 1.5 miles from Springer Mountain, where the AT officially begins.I met Sage and his wife (forgot her trail name); they're from New England. They are also thru hiking. We had dinner together in the shelter, since no one is staying in it. I had chicken and rice (Terri, you'd be proud...) (OK, maybe not).

I probably burned off those calories in the first hour after leaving Dick's Creek Gap...Anyway, why, do you ask, is Melvin Roberts called ""lightening"" Melvin Roberts?

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529650,"Good day today. Got an early start and was out on the trail by 7:45. I love the name of some of these gaps/mountains: today I hiked thru Licklog, Burningtown, and Tellico Gaps, and Copper Ridge and Wesser Balds.Right near the end of today's hike, I came across a spring-fed stone cistern. (see picture). I spent about 20 minutes there drinking and filling my water bottles, and taking a mini bath. It's good to get the layers of sweat off you whenever you can. I'm currently at a nice, quiet stealth campsite with me, myself, and I. Sweet!Last night, there were just too many people at the shelter. Tonight, I found a nice little spot up on a ridge...just enough space for a single tent. I've had my dinner, and hung my food bag. I'm 5 miles from the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center). They mostly do white water rafting there, but they do have some services for hikers like showers, laundry, and what's supposed to be a pretty good restaurant. I think I'll try their burger; it's gotten good reviews. Am looking at Thursday for entering the Smokies. Chow for now...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529815,"I think today was my toughest day on trail so far. It included a very tough 5 mile descent hike to the NOC, and then a brutal 7 mile uphill hike out of the NOC. The uphill was basically continuous for 6.5 miles. And the uphill, in most cases, was straight up. I stopped around 5:00 uphill from Sassafras Gap Shelter on a ridge with beautiful views both north and south.The burger I was looking forward to was not to be. When I got to the NOC, they said the restaurant was closed until Wednesday due to a water line break. I did get a ham and cheese wrap at the General Store there. I also took a shower. On a somber note, my bear bag got stuck in a tree just a few minutes ago. I've had that bear bag since I lived in Washington state, 17 years ago. I tried everything to free it, but I believe it wanted to have its final resting place right above the AT with a beautiful view of the mountains. We've had some good times together. Rest in peace bear bag. It is where it wants to be...I was planning on getting to Fontana Dam on Thursday, but with a couple of 11 mile days, I can be there by Wednesday evening. It's supposed to rain Thursday, so I might take it off and tent at the Fontana Hilton (it's not really a Hilton hotel, it's just a campground).

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530110,"Long day of hiking today. Only need to go 8.8 miles tomorrow to reach Fontana Dam. I'm going to get an early start in the morning; would like to be on the trail by 6AM, which would mean breaking camp and hiking for a while with my headlamp. I would like to be in the shelter, the Fontana Hilton, before it begins to rain. 60 percent chance of rain by tomorrow afternoon, 80 percent chance on Thursday, sunny on Friday and the weekend. I might take a zero on Thursday, especially if it's raining. I've been going at it hard lately, and my legs are tired; especially on the up hills. Got some trail magic in the form of apples and bananas at Stecoah Gap today. Bob, trail name Quest, thru hiker 2004, was the trail angel. He asked me my trail name, so I told him. He said, ""I've heard of you. I follow you on trail journals."" That was pretty cool! Anyway, thanks for the fruit Bob, much appreciated.After leaving Stecoah Gap, I got to experience the infamous ""Jacobs ladder"" that I've read about. It's straight uphill, and I mean STRAIGHT UPHILL! I had to stop and rest about once every 30 seconds. Very intense climb. I survived.I have a nice stealth spot on a mountain top with 270 degree views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Very nice. I had a lot of my clothes hanging on my ""AT clothesline"".,,aka, a tree, when it began raining. Clear sky mostly, except for a small dark cloud above. Had to get everything under cover quickly. I hunkered down in my tent; the rain lasted for about 20 minutes.That's all for now.

I thoroughly enjoyed hiking in the darkness; my headlamp has two settings on it, one brighter than the other. It lights up the trail nicely, just like day hiking, except for not being able to see the surrounding scenery. I hiked the 9 miles and was at the Fontana Hilton by 10:30AM. Met Cosmo at the shelter. He is from Austin, Texas. We've been hanging out for most of the afternoon. I went up and took a shower soon after I got here; also washed my clothes in the shower (on trail, you wash your clothes anywhere you can).I've got some extra food, so I've been eating more than normal today, and will again tomorrow. I do want to have lunch tomorrow at the restaurant; hopefully, it will be open.Had a few light sprinkles today after I got here. More expected tonight and tomorrow, and again Sunday/Monday. Need the rain; have heard 15 miles of the trail are closed north of Hot Springs.I can post this because Cosmo is letting me use his wifi off his I phone. I have no phone service here; hopefully will have it when I cross Fontana Dam early Friday morning. Will pickup my 7 day supply food box tomorrow to get me thru the Smokies. Taking tomorrow off, will be heading into the Smokies on Friday...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530307,"Well, I experienced sleeping in a shelter for the first time last night. It's one of the better shelters so far; no mice, and it's got a great view of Fontana Lake and the surrounding Great Smoky Mountains to the north. Quite the interesting people that I shared the shelter with last night...that's all I can say about that since this is a public journal...Me and Cosmo walked the .4 of a mile to the visitors center where we caught a ride to the general store, restaurant, and resort lodge. I had a nutty buddy at the general store; then I facetimed with Terri. That is the hardest part of my hike so far...I miss my wife.We then went to the restaurant and had a great lunch. I had a pulled pork sub with ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, BBQ sauce and fries w/ sweet tea. Very good...We then walked up the hill (even on my zero day I can't stay away from the up hills), and I picked up my 7 day food supply to get me through the Smokies. I am currently hanging out at the bathroom up the street from the Hilton charging my battery charger. Great way to spend an afternoon, hanging out in the bathroom with beautiful mountains all around me...Anyway, once that is done, I'm heading back to the shelter to pack up my backpack to get ready to hike out in the morning. I'm figuring 6-7 days to get thru the Smokies. They're calling for 4 straight days of rain beginning Saturday. We'll see how my gear, and I, do. Haven't had to deal much with the rain so far.Haven't had phone reception here at Fontana Dam, and might not for another 8-9 days, until I get to Hot Springs.The day off has been good for my legs; ready to hit the long uphill out of Fontana early tomorrow morning.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530538,"Left the Fontana Hilton @ 7:45. The first 1.5 miles was on the road past the visitor center and over the Fontana Dam. I then entered the woods, turned in half of the Smoky Mtn. thru hiker permit, kept the other half, and began my hike into the Smoky Mountains...all uphill for the first 9 miles. On the way up the mountain(s), I saw my first 2 deer cross the trail about 50 yards in front of me. I took 3 pictures, but couldn't see them in the pictures, so I deleted them. When I got to the shelter tonight, a man from Ohio, whom I had just met, said he saw a bear about a mile before he got here.I had cell coverage on the trail, so I called Terri. It was good to talk to her. Just in the past 30 minutes, the wind has kicked up, and it has turned colder...rain coming soon...haven't had to hike in the rain since the day I went thru Woody Gap; more than 2 weeks ago. Have to sleep in the shelter tonight; Smoky Mtn. park rules. There is a ridge runner at the shelter tonight; he's checking to make sure all of the thru hikers have their permits, and to enforce the rules. Real nice gentleman, looks to be in his 60's. Says he's been doing this for 13 years. Good job to have..That's all for now...

Got to the shelter around 1:30; only 2 others here, but it's now 4:30, and the shelter is full, and there are also people tenting. It's been raining off and on for the last couple of hours. Should be an interesting night...I'm hoping tomorrow will be a better hiking day; should be seeing Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT at over 6700 feet high. Had great views today on Rocky Top Mtn. Could see Fontana Dam way off in the distance. It's neat to look at all of the ranges of mountains and know that I have hiked over them to get where I'm at.Lots of ups and downs today; max effort hiking without the distance to show for it. Have been spoiled with great weather so far; was due for a day like this.Hopefully, better weather tomorrow...Oh, almost forgot... there was a bear in our camp last night.

Just after dark, I turned on my headlamp and it was about 3 feet from my face, looking straight at me, not phased by my light in the least. I started from Derick Knob shelter about 7:45AM in my rain gear; my goal was to get up and over Clingman's Dome, highest point on the AT at 6667ft. The climb up to Clingman's Dome was long and hard. My shirt was soaked thru w/ sweat when I reached the top and the wind was blowing pretty good, so I only stayed there a few minutes because I had to keep moving so I wouldn't get a chill. I was very fortunate in that it did not rain. I reached my goal, which is Mt. Collins Shelter. The shelter is full, so I'm able to tent, thank God. The shelters are dirty, stinky, and have mice. This is the first night back in my tent in 5 days. It is thundering right now, and looks like we'll get some more rain tonight. Lots of hikers here; must be at least 10-12 tents, along with the full shelter.Talked to a hiker who who is on the first night of hiking the Mountain to Sea trail. It starts at Clingman's Dome, and traverses the entire state of North Carolina, ending at the Outer Banks. 1150 miles. Pretty cool. No cell phone coverage today, Should be done with the Smokies on Wednesday. Was told it would take 5-8 days to accomplish. Looks like it'll be 6 days for me. I feel good about that. Supposed to take 2-3 days to reach Hot Springs once I'm done with the Smokies. So Hot Springs is looking like Saturday-Sunday.I also crossed the 200 mile mark a half mile north of Clingman's Dome.

Within 10 minutes, I was bailing...getting everything out before it got wet. The shelter was full, so I slept on the wooden bench...builds character, right? No pain, no rain, no Maine...I called Terri, and she called REI, and ordered me a Big Agnes Copper Spur tent, which will be in Hot Springs on Friday. Thank you Terri!My lesson learned: don't go cheap on the big three- tent, backpack, sleeping bag. Backpack and sleeping bag are doing well. Tent to follow...The hiking today was great; lots of high altitude ridge hiking with awesome views. Took a break at Davenport Gap; Terri took a pic of me 4 years ago at the mileage sign there; so I had the same pic taken there today. Same pic, a little older, and a lot scragglier looking! The pic 4 years ago is my cover photo for this journal.The last 2 miles I was practically sprinting down the trail, because it was thundering all around me and getting very windy. I did get to the shelter before the rain began. But it began pouring about an hour later.

I wanted to hike 12 miles to the Cosby Knob shelter, but when I got there around 4PM, it was full, and I could not tent because it leaks. Can't wait to get my new tent! So I had to hike on, 7 miles further to the next shelter, for a 19.7 mile day, in the mud. Fun stuff! Got to Davenport Gap shelter around 6:30PM. There was a space left for me to sleep. Now only 1 mile to go until I leave the Smokies. Looking forward to getting out of the park.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531789,"Probably my worst day of hiking so far. It rained all night at Groundhog Creek Shelter and was fairly cold, but I slept well. It was a terrible weather day, only reaching the upper 30's at the higher elevations, where I spent most of the day. It was a day of rain, snow, sleet, and the worst of all, the wind. Looking back on the day, I should have worn more layers. By the time I got to Walnut Creek Shelter, I was totally soaked thru with sweat, and shivering. My fingers were numb. Not good. Plus the shelter was at nearly 4300 ft., so it was snowing, sleeting, and very windy there as well. It took me about 20 minutes to set everything up, get on my dry sleep clothes, and get in my sleeping bag to try and warm up my body. I still couldn't get warm in my bag. I continued shivering for another 3 hours. I finally had to get out of my bag to do the remaining chores before I could crawl into my bag for the night. Use the privy, get water, and make some dinner. I also believe I was dehydrated, which also led to me not being able to get warm. During my 13 mile hike, I didn't stop to drink water because I was so cold, I wanted to keep moving to stay warm. During the days hike, I climbed up and over Max Patch, a great bald mountain with outstanding views. Only when I was up there, visibility was virtually zero, and the wind was blowing so hard, the sleet was going horizontal!I'm about done with this cold, wet weather. I believe it's been 5 days in a row of it.But tomorrow is Hot Springs, and the forecast is finally starting to look better.I have been hiking off and on the last week with a guy with the trail name Fox. He hikes in either a pair of crocs, or in his bare feet! I have seen his bare footprint in the mud a few different times.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531791,"Had a much better day of hiking today. Did not sleep well at all last night. It rained and sleeted heavy all night, with strong winds. The shelter itself was very drafty, and did not keep the rain out. All of my hiking clothes are wet; putting on wet, cold clothes in the morning is not fun. Once you get hiking, you warm up. Merino wool is a great fabric, even when it's wet, you still stay warm, for the most part. But that's all a part of hiking the AT; there will be times when it rains days in a row, and everything you have to wear does not get a chance to dry out, and it stays wet.Anyway, after I left the shelter, I immediately descended below cloud line, and it got warmer, and the trail a little drier. Above cloud line, the trail stays wet and gets muddy from all the use. The sun showed its face for the first time in about a week as I got closer to Hot Springs. In Hot Springs, the AT goes right down Main St. It was pretty cool walking straight into town. This is an AT hiker friendly town; most of the locals will wave at you, and the ones I've talked to are friendly and ask me questions about my hike. It was that way also at Newfound Gap; had many tourists come up to me and ask me if I was a thru hiker, amongst other questions.I had a fish sandwich at the Smoky Mountain Diner, then went back 4 hours later and got a pizza. Ate half of it; will eat the other half in the AM for breakfast. I also did my resupply at Dollar General; a 5 day resupply that will get me to Erwin, TN. I'm staying at Elmers Sunnybank Inn; it's actually a 107 year old house; reminds me of my grandparents old farmhouse named Midloch in Louisa, VA. I have one of the upstairs bedrooms, no TV, all antique fixtures and furniture.

It was thundering around 6:30, and as I was getting ready to take the tent down, it started to rain. You don't want to get your tent wet (the sleeping area under the rain fly), so all I could do was climb back in my tent and wait the rain out. If it had started raining just 10 minutes later, I would have had my tent packed, and I would have been on my way. Anyway, I waited in my tent about 3 hours before I could pack it up and get moving. I left about 10AM, in a light rain, and then it started to pour. I was thoroughly soaked thru after an hour. See, even if you have on your rain gear, which I did, you get totally soaked with sweat underneath the rain gear. And I sweat a lot to begin with. So you can take your pick, get soaked with rain, or get soaked with sweat. I prefer sweat, because at lest you're still warm...the rain gear is an insulator from the cold.I hear once the weather warms up, some hikers don't wear rain gear; they just let the rain cool them off as they are hiking. Not a bad idea...Received trail magic twice today. Once from thru hiker Yonder 2007. Krispy crime donut and a banana. Thanks Yonder! Much appreciated. Then on the climb to Big Bald Mountain, there was a gallon of milk and cookies, and deviled eggs. Thank you to that trail angel as well. You all really lift our morale on the trail; especially today with the rain. By the time I got to the summit of Big Bald, the sun had popped out. Beautiful scenery 360 degrees.

I was hiking by 9:30. I saw Alpiner at Johnny's Hostel. I had not seen him in over a week. He told me he's had some Achilles issues and that he has had to take some zeros. He was at the hostel to catch a shuttle up to Trail Days. I hope he can get back on the trail soon.I had a good day hiking. It took me about 3 miles to get back into it. It's a little hard leaving the hotel where you've been resting and relaxing and know you have to get back on the trail and start busting your ass again. I talked to Terri a lot while in the hotel. I miss being home ALOT...but I know this is my one shot to complete my dream of hiking the AT, and I need to give it my best shot. It threatened rain this afternoon, so I put on my pack rain cover, but it never did materialize. It was very windy, and it's turning colder. I'm at 4150 ft tonight, the low is supposed to be in the low to mid 30's, but the wind makes it feel colder. At least it is not raining/snowing. The high tomorrow at this elevation will only be 54 degrees. I have on ALL of the clothes in my pack tonight to try and stay warm.Good to be back on the trail...

More cold tonight, then gradual warming the next few days, with rain in the forecast. I believe the month of May has generally been colder than the month of April was. I was looking forward to staying at the Greasy Creek Friendly hostel tonight to get out of the cold and wind. There was a sign on trail saying it's closed until tomorrow afternoon. I believe the owner is up at Trail Days in Damascus promoting the hostel. So I'm sleeping in the shelter tonight...hopefully the 3 sided shelter will block some of the wind.The hiking itself today was good, minus the cold wind.

Took a number of great pics, one of them being an old chimney and fireplace on top of Roan Mountain, and it's located right on the AT! Also took a couple of videos of 360 degree views up on Round Bald & Jane Bald, which are part of the area called Roan Highlands. Beautiful area, one of my favorites so far on my thru hike. The scenery reminds me of the mountain views with Julie Andrews in ""The Sound of Music"". I'm staying in a very unique shelter tonight, Overmountain Shelter. It's actually a shelter for thru hikers renovated from an old barn. It's huge, probably sleeping at least 30 hikers. Looks like there are about 15 sleeping in the barn tonight, and another 10 or so sleeping outside. And, of course, the shelter (barn) is painted red. Have been told you can see a great sunrise here over the mountains when it's clear.

I'm looking forward to that hike, and then hiking southwestern Virginia. Towards the end of the hiking day it caught me off guard and started to rain. I did not have my pack rain cover on, and my pack started to get wet. Within the last mile, I must have passed 4 or 5 campsites. And now that it was raining, there were no campsites to be found, of course. I was running up the trail looking for any small, flat area where I could set up my footprint and rain fly quickly, and get me and my gear out of the rain. I finally found a small area; it wasn't even a campsite. But I got my footprint and rain fly set up fairly quickly (not bad for the first time under duress), and got out of the rain. It's fairly warm tonight, I think it'll get down in the upper 40's...so I'll sleep without the tent and just with the rain fly over my footprint. I've already got my sleeping pad down and my sleeping bag. It's currently not raining; the sun even came out a few minutes ago. I have to stop at Black Bear Resort tomorrow and get me enough food to get me to Damascus. It's 10 miles from my current location.

But on the positive side, I have loved hiking over the Balds the last 100 miles...some beautiful scenery...I have the bunk room to myself tonight here at Black Bear Resort. Took a shower and laundered my clothes. Some hikers are staying in the cabins here. I want to start early in the morning, 5 or 6 o'clock, to beat the rain, which is supposed to start again by mid afternoon.

Even though it wasn't raining at the time, the wind was blowing the earlier rain off of the trees and onto me. And then it started raining again. I know when I cross the Tennessee/Virginia state line, it will stop raining. That's how states work...Actually my last day in Tennessee, tomorrow it is supposed to be clearing up, and they're talking 80's by mid week.

Yep, the AT physically runs thru someone's cow pasture, with cows, and many cow patties, which I had to dodge around. The cows did not seem very interested in us hikers...(see pic) I was very scared...not really...Also, yesterday there were 2 hikers, C-sharp and Cake, who came upon a bear above Watuaga Dam, the bear would not move out of their way. C-sharp and Cake were yelling at it, but the bear still wouldn't move. So another hiker, Avalon, an opera singer, came up.

A heard of about 8 horses have given me quite a show this evening. I've taken lots of pics and even a short video. They came waltzing up to my campsite, sniffing my tent, backpack, shoes, jacket, and me. I had already tied my food up when they came up. After they left my campsite, the heard was running all over the meadow playing either hide and seek, or tag. It was quite fun to watch. At one point during their game of tag, the heard ran within a few feet, and right by, my tent. I thought they were just going to run it over! Was a little scared there for a minute...They were chasing each other and neighing, and sometimes jumping up on just their hind legs. I believe they were putting on a show just for me. I am so glad I picked this campsite. I'm the only one here in this meadow. Most other hikers/campers are in the tree line or at Thomas Knob Shelter, which is a mile south of here.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551693,"Hi All...It's been about 5 1/2 months since I ended my 2016 AT hike in Pearisburg, Va. The 40 pounds I had lost on trail are pretty much back on. I have gone back thru my journals a couple of times since and relived my experience...what an experience! Two months on the trail were enough for me for 2016, and the weight loss really threw a wrench into the works...I never thought at the beginning of the hike that that was going to be a problem; I never had the first problem with my legs or feet. The only pain I had was pain in my right shoulder; I separated it years ago, and it never healed properly. The weight of the pack on my shoulder and I believe the motion of my continuous arm swing with the trekking poles caused the pain. But I could deal with that pain; it was not the reason I ended my hike. I feel that 2 months of hiking is the right dose for me.With that being said, I still want to do what I originally set out to do; hike the entire AT. I think about it at some point everyday. I have the first third done (approx.), and want to hike the the rest of the trail in equal thirds. One year the middle third, which would take me from Pearisburg to just short of the Connecticut state line in NY. And the final third from NY to Katahdin. Will see how things work out....would like to do the middle third this coming year...but have to clear it with the boss first!Thanks to everyone who followed me on my journal this year...all of the words of encouragement were much appreciated! Who knows, maybe I 'll be starting up my journal again this next year! I'll let you know...Bubblehead",,Hiking still on my mind...,"Nov 21, Mon",0

I'll go to the Walmart in Pearisburg and get 3 days of food to begin my hike.I was doing a 5 mile hike (walk) today around my neighborhood when it started raining with about a mile to go. The rain felt really good since it was about 90 degrees outside. We need the rain really bad here in Florida because it has been so dry. My wife pulled up next to me in our truck during the rain and told me to get in. When I got in, I asked her why she came to get me. She told me she didn't want me to get wet....She is so sweet! I told her whenever it begins to rain on my upcoming AT hike,  I'll give her a call to come pick me up in the truck so I won't get wet! We had a good laugh over that....

I mailed my backpack to Angel's Rest Hiker Haven in Pearisburg. I just texted them, and they received it this morning...one less thing to worry about! 
All I'm taking with me on the plane is the clothes I'll be wearing on the trail.
I'm not sure if I'll be hiking out Monday or Tuesday. Once I get to Pearisburg, I'll need to go pick up my backpack, then go to Walmart or Food Lion there and get 3 days of food, and then drop off my rental car at Enterprise Car Rental, which is only a 1/2 mile from the trailhead. 
I figure if everything goes smoothly, and I can get on the trail by 1:30 or 2:00, then I'll go ahead and hike out on Monday. If not, I'll spend the night at Angel's Rest and hike out Tuesday morning.
My flight is due to arrive in Roanoke at 9:49 AM.

Everything so far has gone well. The flight from Orlando to Roanoke went on schedule. Got the rental car at the airport and was in Pearisburg by 11:15AM. 
Ate lunch at Hardee's, then checked in to Angels Rest Hiker Hostel. $10 to sleep in your tent and to have a shower.
I got 4 days of food at Walmart, then came back to the hostel, put up my tent, and showered, then had dinner at Pizza Hut. 
Cloudy today, but no rain. 
I enjoyed sitting in the living room of the hostel meeting the hikers who've been on the trail, and were asking them about how their hikes have gone so far, and the conditions on the trail. Very interesting to listen to all of their stores and trials and tribulations.
Hoping to turn in the rental car and be on the trail by 9 or 9:30 in the morning.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566833,"I turned in the rental car this morning and began the second leg of my AT thru hike around 9:25. It was flat the first couple of miles from the trailhead and across the New River Bridge. But then from there the trail went up for the next 6 miles to the Rice Field Shelter. I took it slow up the mountain, since it was the first mountain I had hiked in a year. 
Once I got to the ridge line on Peters Mountain, it flattened out again with views both east into Virginia, and west into West Virginia. 
My tentsite tonight is right on the state line, so I can't really tell you currently what state I am in!
I had my first AT bear sighting today; I didn't see any bears last year in the 650 miles that I hiked. This year, the first day! A mother and her cub. I saw the cub first; it was right on the trail and about 100 yards in front of me. Then the mother showed up; they looked at me for about 10 seconds, then ran off the trail and away from me. Didn't see them again after that. I had taken my phone out to get a pic, but didn't have enough time.
My campsite is at 3362 ft.
I ended up hiking almost 13 miles...think I over did it a little. I'm sure I'll be quite sore in the morning.
But all in all, a very good first day back on the AT...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567812,"I accidentally deleted today's entry, so I'm writing what I remember about this day a week later...
I broke camp and began hiking around 8AM. I continued hiking along the ridge of Peter's Mountain straddling the state line between Va. and W. Va for another 3 miles before I turned east into Virginia and finally began heading down the mountain towards Dismal Creek. I ran out of water shortly into my hike, and Dismal Creek was the next water source, 5 miles away. So by the time I reached the creek, I was quite parched. I filled and treated 2 liters of water and had lunch sitting on a large rock next to the creek. Summer sausage, cheese, and a little trail mix...
After lunch I passed by the Captain's Place. The Captain has a home on the other side of the creek (more like a river) and let's hikers tent in his yard...and I'm told he normally has a cooler with soft drinks on his porch. The only way to get to his house is by a zip line over the creek. But the Captain's Place is closed right now because he just had surgery last week and is recovering. Hope he gets better soon...
I hiked a couple more miles and set up my tent near the Stony Creek bridge. 
It rained for about an hour before I set up my tent, but just a steady drizzle. Good night from the AT..,

At my first break at Bailey Gap Shelter, I met Slow n Steady. He's 62 yrs. old and is attempting a thru hike. He left Springer in February. 
For most of the day, I was hiking in woods; there was beautiful mountain laurel blooming, white, pink, and orange. I finally made it to an overlook at Wind Rock, and it was a big rock, and it was very windy, so whoever named it got it right. There was a 180 degree view of mountains...
From there I spent the rest of the day hiking down the mountain I had spent most of the morning and early afternoon hiking up. 
I did see a rattler on the trail just before Wind Rock. It's rattle wasn't rattling, so I hurried on past it.
I'm too tired to set up my tent tonight, so I'm sleeping in the War Spur Shelter. It's 7:00, and I'm the only one in the shelter so far. There is a mother and her son who are tenting here...  Good night from the AT...

Got an early start this morning; on the trail by 7:00. I hiked up and over John's Creek Mountain, and then had lunch down the mountain at Laurel Creek Shelter. 
After that I left the woods and hiked for 3 miles thru beautiful farm land, and yes, cow pastures. Remember my experience with the cows in Tennessee and how frightened I was? Well, Virginia cows are much nicer and have better trail manners. The momma cows don't stand directly on the trail feeding their calf here in Virginia like they did back in Tennessee. How rude of those Tennessee cows! No trail manners whatsoever!
As I was leaving my adventures thru the cow pastures and re-entering the woods, I came upon the infamous Keffer Oak. The second largest Oak tree on the AT (the largest on the AT is in NY). It is 18 feet around at the base, and over 300 years old.That tree was alive before we were even a country. Amazing. It still looks healthy; it'll probably live another 300 years. 
I also saw another huge black snake, around 4 feet long. No rattler this time.
In the woods just before the pasture, there were squirrels everywhere. These weren't your scrawny looking Florida squirrels; they were squirrels on steroids, they looked more like rabbits. Must be something in the acorns here...
Anyway, that was my exciting day on the AT.
I'm at Sarver Hollow Shelter tonight, just me, myself, and I. There's a bird nest under the porch roof of the shelter that has baby birds in it. The mother flys into the woods and then comes back with food to the chirping babies delight. That's my entertainment for tonight...
I haven't seen many hikers on my 4 days on the trail. Most thrus are north of me.
Good night from the AT.

Needed to hike the 16 miles so I could get to Four Pines Hostel tomorrow by lunch to eat at the famous Homeplace Restaurant...all you can eat with 3 meats...roast beef, fried chicken, and ham...that was my incentive to hike the long distance today. 
While eating lunch at Niday Shelter, I met Voyager. He looked to be about 60+ years old. He is currently on his second thru hike of the AT. He has also hiked the Continental Divide Trail twice, and the Pacific Crest Trail twice; meaning when he finishes this years AT thru hike, he will be a triple crown Hiker, two times over!
He averages 25-30 miles a day. He told me the secret is you don't need to hike fast, just hike slowly all day long and the miles will start flowing. He doesn't spend more than 5 minutes at a shelter to eat...he eats while he hikes. Would have loved to pick his brain more..,.but after 3 minutes, he was off again.
He started from Springer Mountain on April 30 this year, and already close to 700 miles down...incredible!
I ate dinner at Pickle Branch Shelter and met 4 adults with 4 Boy Scouts doing a 5 day hike. They are from Farmville. One of the 4 adults graduated from University of Richmond in 1973. Great sharing the Shelter with a fellow Spider! 
One of the boys just graduated high school and will be going to Longwood College in the fall. I wished him luck this morning as we headed out. They were headed southbound.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567852,"Very tough day on the trail, even with the low mileage. My legs were shredded from yesterday...no joint pain, just burning in my thighs. 
And the 6.7 miles ahead of me were  going to be my toughest on the trail (along with hiking over Max Patch last year in the snow, sleet, and wind). Hiking up and over Dragon's Tooth was very difficult. The white paint blazing in this area was not good...and I spent the better part of 3 hours scrambling and jumping up, down, and over huge boulders...in some areas they had rebar ladders you had to climb up and down rock faces that was the trail.
At one point I missed a white blaze and continued scrambling (not hiking) down the mountain when I heard and met for the first time, Target and Sleepy Head. They were telling me that I wasn't on the trail, and needed to turn around and scramble back up the mountain to find the trail again. 
We would later rehash our escapades for the day when we were seated together for lunch at The Homeplace Restaurant, which was outstanding! Served family style, it was very good food. 
And of course, it was Sunday afternoon, so everyone there eating was wearing their Sunday best, except for us dirty, sweaty, crusty hikers. The locals are obviously used to the hikers eating there, because there were no dirty looks or comments from anyone. We were treated very nicely...much appreciated...
I also met my second Richmond Spider in as many days today at the Hostel...Mystic, who lives in the D.C. area. Richmond grad class of '75.
Four Pines Hostel is basically a farm yard with chickens, roosters, pheasant hens???, ducks, 2 nice dogs, and one black and white kitty. 
I was going to tent out, but the weather is threatening, and it's already thundering outside...rain expected tonight until mid afternoon tomorrow. So I'm sleeping in a garage with about 30 bunks. There are probably 20 hikers here tonight. Good night from the AT...

While at the Hostel, I met Medicine Man from Des Moines, IA. He injured his Achilles and will go home for treatment. He was staying at the Hostel for the last week to see if his foot would get better, and he shuttled hikers to and from the Homeplace Restaurant and the grocery store. He's hoping to get back on the trail in about a month. Real good guy...
I immediately climbed a small mountain from the trailhead, then walked a couple miles thru some beautiful farm pastures. No scary cow incident this time...
I then crossed US-311 and began the ascent towards McAfee Knob, one of the most popular and picturesque places on the AT. I'm at a shelter about a mile and a half from McAfee Knob tonight. It's still sprinkling as I lay in a packed full shelter. Hope the weather will cooperate tomorrow morning on my visit to McAfee Knob.  Good night from the AT.

It's never fun, but after a 1/2 mile of hiking I was wearing warm, wet clothes. Warm being better than cold...
Anyway, I had 2 miles to hike up 1000 feet to get to McAfee Knob.
The weather much better than yesterday's rain. 
McAfee Knob is about the most pictured place on the entire AT. If you get a book on the AT, chances are the cover will be a picture of a hiker on McAfee Knob.
There were 5 other hikers when I got there. The Knob is a cliff that sticks out from the mountain, with about a 2000 foot drop if you were to fall off. Beautiful scenery of other mountain ranges and fertile green valleys below. I got another Hiker to take some pics of me on the Knob.
I hiked about 5 more miles to get to Tinker Cliffs. Another beautiful spot with amazing Cliffs jutting out from the mountain with incredible views also. From there, you can look across the valley, back to McAfee Knob. The AT itself goes right along the edge of Tinker Cliffs for about 1/2 mile, at times the trail itself right on the edge of the 2000 foot drops to the valley below. I spent an hour up there by myself soaking in the warm sun, and drying out all of my gear and clothes that got soaked yesterday. 
While sitting on Tinker Cliffs I watched a couple of falcons flying at about the same height I was, just floating on the air...a beautiful sight, the only sound being the wind...a very serene experience.
I then hiked a couple more miles down the mountain and set up my tent at Lambert's Meadow Campsite.  So far, I am the only one here.

There were some nice overlooks into the Daleville and Troutville valleys. I also saw a buck along the side of a mountain; it didn't scare when it heard me... just slowly walked away from me.
I came out onto highway 220 around 12:30, and had a short walk to Hojo's.
I couldn't get into my room until 2:00, so I walked across the street to Pizza Hut and had a meat lovers pizza and a Pepsi. The first real good I've eaten in 8 days. It was very good!
There's supposed to be a good BBQ place up the street, so I'll check that out tomorrow for lunch. I'll also go to Kroger's to resupply, an by an outfitter to get a pair of crocs and a buff. Probably Mexican for dinner, then back on the trail Friday.

I met Laser Beam early on in my hike as I was passing underneath I-81. She left Springer with her husband, but he got hurt and had to leave the trail back at the NOC. Since then, Laser Beam has continued her thru hike, and her husband follows her along in the car,and picks her up every 3 or 4 days to resupply and stay in town. While she's on the trail, he's a trail angel, feeding hikers or giving them rides as needed. Pretty cool story.
The trail today was very good; still had mountains to climb up and over, but the trail was very smooth; no large rocks or boulders to hike around.
Water is not as plentiful on this section of trail, so I'll have to keep an eye out for that, and might have to carry some extra liters of water with me in certain areas. I normally carry 1-2 liters with me, but can carry up to 4 if I have to. Each liter of water weighs 2 lbs. 
I hiked a little over 11 miles today. Just before the Shelter I'm currently tenting at is Wilson Creek. I watered up there, but also soaked my feet in the cold creek for about 15 minutes.

After over 15 miles hiking, I set up my tent about 50 feet from the Pedlar River Suspension foot bridge. I even have my bear bag hanging from it tonight!

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569069,"Had a long climb up Bald Knob today; went from 600ft elevation where I camped to over 4000ft on Bald Knob. Don't know why it's named Bald Knob, it is totally forested on top.
Early on in my hike I stopped at a good flowing stream and rinsed some of my sweaty clothes and took a sponge bath. Of course, by the time I was half way up Bald Knob, my clothes were totally saturated in sweat again. 
Once I reached the top, I took an hour break and put my clothes on the AT clothesline (a tree) and let the wind dry them out. 
I then hiked down Bald Knob and up Cole Mountain, which incidentally, is a Bald. Beautiful scenery on Cole Mountain, a 270 degree view. I spent about 30 minutes sitting on top of a big boulder, again letting the breeze help dry out my sweaty clothes. I love the grass covered mountain summits...Cole Mountain reminded me of all the Balds I hiked over last year back in North Carolina and Tennessee. 
I then reached my camping spot, Hog Camp Gap. Looking for the hogs...haven't seen any...
I'm in my tent early, because currently there is a thunderstorm a happening. The only camp chore I didn't get done was to hang my bear bag. Another Hiker who's tenting near me already had his up, so he put my bag on his line. Nice, young guy...will be sure to ask his trail name in the morning.

I'm at 4000 ft tonight; this is the chilliest night of my hike so far; the elevation combined with the cloudy skies and rain.They say -3 degrees for every 1000 ft of elevation, so it's 12 degrees cooler here than it would be at sea level.
Part of the hike today was in the clouds and fog.

Back up to 4000 ft again.
A long, difficult, and challenging climb. It took me 4 hours to get to the top. Lots of straight up climbing, and in many places hand over hand scrambling over large rocks and big boulders. 
Was told by a SOBO Hiker that this would be the last really big mountain until Vermont, and that the hiking will be getting easier. Not sure if easier was the right word to use....none of this trail is easy.
I then got to Maupin Field Shelter, where I planned to spend the night. This other Hiker was there signing the Shelter log book, and said Reid's Gap was only 1.6 more miles, and from there we could hitch a ride to the Devil's Backbone Brew Pub where they will let you tent and get some real food. My planned dinner of almonds and a granola bar would not happen. I hiked the extra 1.6, even though I was beat, and me and Pappa Bean hitched a ride.

After just a couple of miles, I stopped at Dundo Campground. It was a nice area with picnic tables to sit (having a place to sit, rather than on a log or boulder, is a luxury) along with real bathrooms (quite the luxury on trail), trash bins (also a luxury, so you can empty your packout trash bag), and a water pump, even though it said you still needed to treat the water. 
I stayed there for close to an hour, eating and chilling.
I then hiked for the next 5 miles on relatively flat trail, until I got to the Loft  Mountain Campstore. I stayed there for about 45 minutes and had a Pepsi, Lays Potato Chips, and a chocolate chip muffin. You could also take a shower there, and do your laundry, but I didn't.

I am feeling better today, thank goodness. Don't know what caused yesterday's episode; I'm just glad it's over. I hope not to have to go thru that again.
My goal tomorrow is for 15 miles to this established campsite, then it'll only be 10 more miles to the Pennsylvania border, which I'll reach on Saturday.

This morning it was still drizzling when I headed out. But by mid morning it had stopped and the sun finally began breaking thru the clouds. I stopped at Dahlgren State Park and refilled my water there, and also talked to Bulldog and one of his sons he had hiking with him. I've seen Bulldog off and on since my first day in Shenandoah National Park, more than 2 weeks ago.
My next stop was at the original Washington Monument, which is right on the AT. 34 steps to the top in a winding staircase. All made of stone...interesting architecture. Would have been a great view, but the clouds had just started to lift. 
After visiting there, I crossed I-70 on a covered foot bridge and hiked up to Black Rock Cliffs. I stayed there looking at the outstanding scenery of the valley and beautiful farmland while I dried out my clothes.
Gonna try for an 18 mile day tomorrow to set up a stay in Fayetteville, Pa. on Sunday night. We'll see how that goes...

It rained pretty hard for a while, but it has begun to lighten up some. It's supposed to clear off in about an hour and be a nice evening. 
Today's highlight was crossing the Mason-Dixon line and entering my 7th of 14 states on the AT: Pennsylvania. The Maryland trail for the most part was very good, but ended with lots of rocks and small boulders to scramble over...a precursor of things to come in Pennsylvania, so I've been told.
I have 9.6 miles to hike in the morning to US-30, where I'll get picked up by the hotel I'll be staying at. Looking forward to a shower and good meal, or two. The Flamingo Restaurant across the street from the hotel is supposed to be really good.

I immediately had my biggest climb of the day up to Chimney Rocks, which had a good view of the next mountain range to the east. 
The rest of my short hike of 9+ miles was on fairly level terrain for the most part, scrambling over rocks/boulders on the ridge line, and hiking thru some beautiful pine forests, which seem to be increasing in number as I head further north.
I reached US-30 by 11:00, and called the hotel, and was picked up within about 10 minutes.
After getting into my room, I immediately took a shower, then walked across the street to the Flamingo Restaurant, where I had a terrific lunch of meatloaf with brown gravy, mashed potatoes, and Lima beans. 
I then got my laundry done, then took a short walk to the Dollar General store to get my resupply. I got a few new food items, because I really didn't eat everything in my food bag this past week. Gonna try some bagels with Nutella this week, with more cookies and sweets. My food has been really bland lately; have to mix it up a little.

It made for quick time. I began hiking just before 9AM, and had gone over 16 miles by 4:30. If I had started at my usual time of 7AM, I could have gotten in 18-20 miles. 
I had a good breakfast this morning at the Flamingo Restaurant...a sausage and cheese omelette, hash browns, corned beef hash, and toast. My stomach has shrunk...couldn't eat all my dinner last night or all my breakfast this morning. 
Back to the trail, the shelters so far in Pennsylvania have been the best of all states I've hiked in. They each have a caretaker that keeps them clean. They are also built very well. Pennsylvania definitely puts money into their shelters. 
Also, pine forests are really beginning to show up on the trail. Beautiful forests with the fragrant pine smell. Pine needles also make for a very soft, comfortable trail for the feet to walk on. I'll be getting to Pine Grove Furnace State Park in the morning, and should be able to get breakfast at a restaurant there that is right on the trail. 
I reached and past the halfway point of the AT today. 1094.9 miles from Springer, 1094.9 miles from Katahdin. I now have more miles hiked than miles to go to reach Katahdin. Hey, the little things like this keep you motivated to keep hiking up and down mountains all day long...

Early in the hike today, I passed the 1100 mile mark, and came to Pine Grove Furnace State Park, where I stopped at the General Store and had a breakfast sandwich...not bad...fried egg, bacon, ham, and cheese. With OJ. 
I then went over to the AT museum they had there...everything you want to know about the history and the people over the years that have made the AT what it is today.
I then got back to hiking. The trail had been more or less flat up to the state park. But north of the park, the ups and downs began again, along with the rocks. 
But I was making good time. The last 3 or 4 miles were scrambling, sometimes by hand, over large rocks and boulders on the ridge line of the mountains, which slowed me down. 
Tomorrow's hike will be interesting. The AT leaves the mountains for about 14 miles to cross the Cumberland Valley....farmlands and pastures, before it enters the mountains again on the other side. There are no water sources during the 14 mile stretch, so I'll have to ""camel up"" before I get there. 
The town of Boiling Springs is just 3 miles down the mountain from where I am tonight... the trail goes right down Main St., so I'll grab some breakfast there in the morning. A real breakfast 2 days in a row on the trail. You can't beat that!

Today's hike started on top of a mountain at Darlington Shelter, then hiked down the mountain and hiked thru some beautiful farmlands and pastures, then climbed another mountain and followed a rocky ridge line before descending to Duncannon, a small town with a railroad running thru it on the Susquehanna River. 
When I walked into town around 11:30 AM, the first place I came to was an Exxon Mini Market, where I got 2 Gatorades and downed them quickly. I was very dehydrated from the trail. 
I then went to the famous (by AT standards) Doyle Hotel where I had sweet tea, a cheeseburger, and fries. Very good. 
I then went to the local laundromat and washed my clothes. 
Then I went to a local church where the pastor, who has a house next door to the church, allows hikers to stay in his basement, with A/C, shower, refrigerator, and TV. Free of charge. He does take donations, so I will be sure to contribute. What a nice service for the hikers...and much appreciated...
After I showered and got settled in, I went to the local Italian restaurant and had an Italian sub and mozzarella sticks. 
I then walked to the old train station on the Susquehanna River and chilled for a while at a picnic table and watched a couple of trains go by. 
I then had a double dip of black cherry ice cream, then went back to the church for the evening.

I left Duncannon about 8AM. I had a 2-3 mile road walk out of town...crossed a bridge over the Susquehanna River, and then back into the woods again, immediately climbing Peter's Mountain. About a mile into the woods I ran into Papa Bean at the first campsite, who I've been hiking off and on with since about the second week of my hike, about 400 miles ago. I believe I first met him north of Daleville, Va. We're close to the same age, and we obviously hike about the same speed. 
After about a 13 mile ridgeline walk, I finally came down off Peter's Mountain and was getting close to my destination for the day, when I ran into trail magic.

While I was eating breakfast this morning, I talked to a very curious beaver. He kept swimming around and crawling around his beaver dam looking at me. He would pop his head up every time from the creek, or from his dam, and look at me. He was very curious, and not afraid. 
Had another good weather day for hiking. Two climbs today up the mountains, the second mountain was actually named ""Second Mountain"". The water sources today were few, and the ones that were on the trail had a yellow/orange color to the water due to all of the mining that was once done in the area.
I even hiked by an old abandoned coal mining town called Rausch Gap. From 1828 to 1910, it was a mining town with 1000 inhabitants. There is now just woods there.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572323,"I was due for a hard hiking day. Today was the day. I crossed under I-81 (for the third time, once in Virginia, twice in Pennsylvania) and headed steeply up the mountain. Once on top, the trail       was not well maintained. The trail had vegetation growing over it, in many places walking thru knee high grasses and vines. To make it harder, the trail became very rocky. Sharp, pointy rocks. These rocks really slow you down because the whole time you're hiking, you must look straight down in front of you, concentrating on every step you take. Rocks are hard on your feet, and hard on your shoes. Pennsylvania is known for the rocks, and the rest of this state (about 100 miles) is supposed to get even more rocky. 
And to top it all off, I got to within a half mile of the shelter, and it began pouring. I was soaked head to toe from the rain (I was already soaked in sweat). 
I did get trail magic twice today. I met Matman on the trail. He started a thru hike this year, but got hurt on Blood Mountain back in Georgia. He gave me a soda and some candy bars. Thank you Matman, much appreciated!
Also at the shelter tonight, Kinder brought 2 boxes of Dunkin Doughnuts. Kinder is hiking the trail and staying in the shelter tonight. 
So the 2 trail angels made a tough day on the trail much better. 
And also a local resident is here at the shelter as I'm writing this entry offering a ride to his house to take a shower. I guess he will be known as the third trail angel of the day. That's what the AT is all about.

Completely submerged in water due to the heavy rain yesterday. For a while I was able to step from rock to rock to keep my feet and shoes fairly dry. But then the water got deeper, and the rocks disappeared from view. All I could do now was hike thru the ankle deep water. The good thing about the trailrunners I have is they dry out quickly. I did pass the 1200 mile mark while I was hiking the river/trail. When there wasn't water or rocks to deal with, there came the mud. Lots of mud today.

The combination of warm weather and having to give max physical effort over the rocks/boulders makes it hard to stay hydrated.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573468,"Did a little bit of everything in my hike today. Climbed up and down various mountains, walked a mile on a boardwalk thru a swampy area (that was beautiful and very serene), and boulder scrambled for about a mile, including climbing a rebar ladder up a rock face. Oh, and I saw a bear right on the AT, AND I crossed the state line into New York. 
These long mileage days have me pretty exhausted by the time I climb in the tent, so I'm going to keep the descriptions of what I've been doing to a minimum. But I am down to 79 miles to go in my hike. 
I have a nice campsite near the Cascade Brook, about 3 miles into the state of New York.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573541,"Today was a long day. I basically hiked from sun up to sun down. It was constantly up mountain , down mountain all day long. No easy sections today. And the ups and downs weren't on your normal woodsy path. I was scrambling over boulders and rock walls all day long. It was very challenging, in some places fun, in others not so much. There were many places where I had to throw my trekking poles in front of me and climb  or pull my body up with my hands.
Right at the end of the day I went thru the Lemon Squeezer. A very narrow channel to hike thru, so narrow you have to take your backpack off and push it in front of you as you narrowly slide between 2 tall rock faces.
A very hard day, but I still got in the miles I wanted to, it just took longer to get it done. 
The weather today felt like Fall. Windy and cool all day. The sun came out for the first time since Pennsylvania. I did not see the sun at all in New Jersey.

After climbing up and over Bear Mountain, I stopped at the Bear Mountain Recreation area and ate 2 hotdogs, a bag of chips, and a Pepsi. It was very good after all the trail food I've been eating. 
After eating, I left the rec area, and the AT passes thru the Trailside Museum and Zoo. The lowest point on the entire AT is at the Bear cage in the zoo at 177 ft. elevation. I did not see the Bear. 
I then crossed the Hudson River over the Bear Mountain Bridge. The bridge is 1/2 mile long, and it was very windy while I crossed it. It was a beautiful view of the Hudson River; a very wide river. 
Another awesome weather day for hiking...sunny...upper 70's.
I'm tenting with one other Hiker (a SOBO thru Hiker) tonight at the Hemlock Springs Campsite.

But in talking to a couple of hikers who lived in the area and knew the trails well here, there was no viable tenting option at the 18 mile point. So I had to hike 3 extra miles to get to the Shanendoah campsite, which also has a water pump. In New York, campsites and water sources have been few and far between. Many of the water sources have had non drinkable water. Trail angels have helped at many road crossings by leaving gallon jugs of water. Thank you to all of the trail angels.
3 miles into the hike today, the trail ran right by Appalachian Market and Deli. It's a gas station, but they also have a deli inside that's open 24/7, 365. And they make great food! It was breakfast time when I got there, so I had a overloaded breakfast burrito. Man, the thing was huge, and it was so good. Eggs, bacon, sausage, peppers, and onions. I also had salsa to go on it. I washed it down with 2 bottles of OJ. It really hit the spot.
I was also about out of food, so I got enough for the final 2 days of my hike. 
Speaking of trail angels, I came across a gentleman who was serving fresh lemonade and pound cake to the hikers. His trail name is Marmalade. He hiked the trail earlier this year from Springer to Atkins, Va. He plans in hiking the whole trail over a 4 or 5 year period. He looks to be about my age. Thanks to Marmalade for the trail magic!
I finally got to my destination just after 7PM; about 12 hours of hiking today. I was beat.
In looking at the map, I'll hike 10 miles tomorrow and 20 miles on Wednesday to finish up. Six miles into tomorrow's hike, there's a pizzeria and deli just off trail that I'll have lunch at.
Hiking only 10 miles the next to days will nice; I've been going 17-20 miles everyday for the last 2+ weeks. Both of my Big toes are numb from all the pounding they've taken on the trail and the rocks.

Wow, it has been such a great experience, everything I hoped it would be...and was very challenging, something I hoped it would be also.
I saw some awesome scenery, met some great people on and off the trail, and stayed in some great trail towns. The majority of folks who live in the trail towns support the trail and hikers who hike it in such a positive way.
Thank you so much for everyone who followed my journal and gave me words of support and encouragement.   I thoroughly enjoyed writing the journal, and tried to portray what life is like on the trail. I would especially like to thank my wonderful wife Terri who let me go play in the woods for a couple of months while she unselfishly stayed at home and took care of everything.

I can’t believe it’s been 4 1/2 months since I completed my section hike in New York. 2/3 of my hike of the AT is complete, with my final third from Pawling, NY to Katahdin still ahead of me. I’m working on replacing some items that need replacing to cover the final third of the trail. I got another set of Black Diamond trekking poles and put on the carbide tips the other day. I got a new Sea to Summit Reactor sleeping bag liner; it will give me 15 degrees of additional warmth for my 30 degree sleeping bag.I also got some more Aqua Mira, and some patch material for my tent...I have a small hole in it. I still need to get another pair of Columbia hiking pants (my old ones have holes in the backside from sliding down many rock faces). I also need a new pair of Icebreaker underwear and another Icebreaker short sleeve shirt.I didn’t carry my esbit stove with me this past year, but will be taking it with me this coming year. I plan on leaving a little earlier for my last leg to catch some more of the cooler weather, and to try and stay ahead of the bubble. Too much hiking in the heat this past year...want to avoid it as best I can...If everything works out, I’m planning to start my hike early to mid May where I left off back in August, in Pawling, NY. I plan on flying from Daytona Beach to NYC, then catch the train up to Pawling. Plan on summiting Katahdin mid to late July. I’ve pretty much gained the weight back that I had lost. I’m currently working out at LA Fitness, and doing occasional day hikes on the Florida Trail to stay in shape. Will be picking up my training some as my departure date gets closer. Of course, I will not really get my “mountain legs” back until about 3 weeks into my final section...Take care, and I’ll update ya’ll more a little later...

I'll take the Airporter shuttle from JFK to Grand Central Station, then the train from Grand Central to Pawling. They have a park in Pawling within walking distance of where I'll get off the train. The park allows AT hikers to camp there. I'll spend the night there, then catch a cab to the trailhead, which is about 4 miles away (I know because I walked it last year!)  I wanted to leave a little earlier this year to miss the hot weather, and to stay ahead of the majority of the hiker bubble. I'll be taking my winter gear with me, and I'll also take my stove with me this year. My sleeping bag is only rated to 30 degrees, so I got a Sea to Summit Reactor Bag Liner, which will give me an additional 15 degrees of protection. I believe I made the right choice last year to go stoveless during the warm weather of the mid Atlantic, but it'll be good to have some hot food this year in the cooler weather of New England.I am so looking forward to hiking the final third of the AT!!!!; particularly New Hampshire and Maine. I hiked 644 miles back in 2016, from Amicalola Falls State Park to Pearisburg, Virginia. Last year I hiked 806 miles from Pearisburg to Pawling, New York. This year will be 747 miles from Pawling to Mount Katahdin in Maine.   I want to thank my awesome wife Terri for allowing me, for the third straight year, to go play in the woods for 2 months.

I might have to get a few smaller ticket items like deet, some more pericord, and other items like that.

Both flights were on time and were uneventful. I arrived at JFK airport about 10:30 AM. 
I caught the NYC Airporter bus to Grand Central Station and got there around 12:30 PM. I had a 90 minute wait to catch the train to Pawling, where I’ll begin the final leg of my AT hike in the morning. I finally got into a Pawling around 4PM. 
I got some food to last me 24 hours at a convenience store, and walked about a mile to this park where they allow AT hikers to camp at. 
I have my tent set up finally...it always takes a while to set up camp the first few nights...I had to organize my backpack...until I get back in the “AT” swing of things. 
Supposed to get a couple hours of rain this evening, then it’ll clear off. Just heard the first rumble of thunder...

The tent was wet from last nights thunderstorm, so I hung the footprint and fly out to dry in the sun. The tent did fine during the storm; I stayed dry along with all my gear.
I was 3 miles from the trailhead, so I called a taxi to give me a ride. I was at the trailhead just after 9AM. 
I started the last leg of my AT journey where I left off last year, at NY-55 north of Pawling. I was very excited to be back on the AT again.
Great weather on my first day back on the trail; sunny, breezy, mid 60’s. 
I took it very slow, not being used to the ups and downs of the trail; have to get my legs back in “trail” condition. Usually takes about 3 weeks. Start slowly, and build the miles up gradually. 
After a little over a mile, I took my first break sitting next to Nuclear Lake. A beautiful area. In this area of New York, there were small mountains coming down to the deep blue lake. There is foliage on the trees, but the leaves are still small. The cab driver said they had a very cold winter here, not warming up at all until just a couple of weeks ago.
By 12:00 I had hiked 4 1/2 miles and came to Telephone Pioneers Shelter; the next to last Shelter in New York. 
I decided to stay here at the shelter, even though it was just lunch time. It is supposed to begin raining again tonight, and all day tomorrow. I wanted to stay in the shelter to keep my gear dry tonight, and leave in the morning with a dry tent. 
I’ll resupply tomorrow at Tony’s Deli, then push on north to Wiley’s Shelter, just one mile from the Connecticut state line.

It rained for s good portion of the day, and it was colder, only 50 degrees for the high. Within the first five minutes of leaving the shelter this morning, I fell coming down the mountain on a wet rock, and bent one of my trekking poles. First time I’ve done that. I think I can still use it; we’ll see,
I stopped at Toni’s Deli and got my resupply and had an Ultimate Cowboy Hamburger..2 1/4 lb. patties, bacon, Colby jack cheese, onion rings, and BBQ sauce. Awesome! Tony’s Deli reminds me of true New York; family run deli: mom, pop, and both daughters ran it, and there was an old 1980,s TV showing an old Mel Brooks movie from the 70’s...you know the one where about 100 pigeons poop all over Mel Brooks new suit?   had me laughing while I was eating my burger.
I then left the deli in the rain and hiked the 5 miles to Wiley Shelter, where I was going to end my day. I got there and there was a person tenting there with 2 dogs. In talking with the guy; let’s just say I didn’t feel comfortable staying there. So I had to hike another 4 miles, in the rain, to Ten Mile River Shelter in Connecticut! 10 states down, 4 to go!

I then climbed up and over Schagticoke Mountain. I stopped near the summit and ate lunch and dried my wet clothes on the AT clothesline (a small, scraggly tree). 
After about an hour, I left and walked along a nice wooded ridgeline for a couple of miles. The last 3 miles went up and down numerous Ridges on the side of the mountain overlooking the town of Kent, Ct. This area had lots of rocks and boulders to hike over. 
I got to Mt. Algo Shelter by mid afternoon. It started drizzling as soon as I got there, so I sat in the shelter for about 90 minutes until it stopped raining. I then went and put up my tent.

I had a great western omelette with home fries at the Villager restaurant. 
I needed to charge my battery charger, so I stayed there for about an hour and drank 5 cups of coffee.
I then walked to the IGA and got enough food for 4-5 days. I then went to the town information center to fill my water bottles, and the local bank atm to get some cash. Then to the jewelers to replace the battery in my watch. 
A great guy name Matt gave me a ride back to the trailhead. Thank you Matt!
I was back on the trail just after 11:00. 
I climbed up to Caleb’s Peak, where I took a 30 minute break and dried out my tent rain fly, which got wet during the night. There were great views from there down into the Housatonic River valley. I then crossed St. John’s Ledges, and then descended down a very steep grade of boulders down to the Housatonic River. The climb down reminded me of the climb down from Dragon’s Tooth back in Virginia. It was more of a scramble...huge boulders with a very steep grade of descent. A little harry in places. 
I finally made it down, in one piece, and began a beautiful 5 mile walk along the Housatonic River. I made good time because it was a very flat grade. Spring has finally arrived in Connecticut, and all of the birds told me so. Birds, chipmunks, squirrels, and snakes; even one rattler.
I arrived at Silver Hill Campsite around 5:30. There is a group of about 20 students here from Yale University. Joy! I have had no solitude at the campsites or shelters so far. There have been either students, or homeless people at every stopping point.

I got down the mountain and called a Hostel that was as nearby to see if they had room. They did...I needed to get off the trail and regroup. I was sore and tired.

It was straight up hill, of course, from the road to split boulder, which is a narrow channel to hike through. To get to the split, you had to climb up an 8 foot rock face. It was wet and slippery with no places to grab on to, and I wasn’t about to take another chance of falling, so I bushwhacked about 1/3 of a mile around and back to the trail.
Buckle is a 66 year old man from NJ who thru hiked the AT in ‘15. He’s currently doing a long section from Pawling, NY to Bennington, Vt.
After Split Boulder, it was a good trail for the next 5 miles generally along ridgeline before the trail dropped to US-7. It then was a hike thru farmland and a road walk near the town of Falls Village, Ct. After walking over Iron Bridge, it was back in the woods for a climb up and over Mt. Prospect.

Early on, I came out of the woods and walked thru a large grassy field with a nice view of the valley below. I then went back into the woods and came by the “Giants Thumb”, a huge oblong looking rock sticking up out of the earth.
I then hiked down the north side of Prospect Mountain and bypassed the town of Salisbury. Just before getting to the road, I reached the 1500 mile point of the AT. 689 miles to Mt. Katahdin! 
I then had a pretty steep ascent up to Lions Head, a real nice over look over the South Taconic Range, and back to the town of Salisbury.
I then hiked mainly on ridgeline another 2 miles to the shelter here.
It’s just me and Buckle again tonight in the shelter.

My knee really began bothering me on any descent. The pain is getting worse; not sure why. I ascended Bear Mt. in good fashion, but the hike back down was horrible. Rocks, boulders, and a couple of rock faces to climb down. I couldn’t figure a safe way to get down the second rock face I came to, there were no good foot or hand holds to grab without falling about 20 feet, so I spent close to an hour bushwhacking my way around the rock face thru thick brush. Not fun.
I finally got to the bottom of Bear Mt. and began my climb up to Mt. Cube. It was a long ascent, but no problems; I reached the Mt. Cube ledges, a .6 mi. walk on beautiful ledge overlooks to the north, east, and south. Reminded me of walking along Tinker Cliffs back in Virginia, but in my opinion, much better. I took about a 30 minute break and listened to nothing but the sound of the wind; and watched the birds floating on the air out from where I was sitting. Very relaxing...
I then had another 100 ft. of elevation to get to the top of Mt. Cube, and then began going back down the mountain. My knee killed me going back down. My hiking speed slowed down to about a crawl. 
The last mountain of the day was Mt. Everett. My hiking app says Mt. Everett is a grueling climb on either side of the mountain. I was barely moving, and knew I couldn’t make it over the mountain. The shelter I was trying to get to was just a mile on the other side.
I ended up getting off the AT and taking a side trail towards US-41. I stopped at Race Brook Falls campsite, and in the morning will hike 1.8 mi. to the highway and get picked up by a person who lets hikers stay at her house.

She has a home in Sheffield, Massachusetts and has 3 bedrooms where hikers can get off the trail and rest and resupply. I took a shower, then slowly walked 15 minutes into town to get some lunch: pulled pork and BBQ brisket with black beans and Mac and cheese. Very good.
After lunch Jess drove me up to Great Barrington to the hospital’s ER to get my knee looked at. I got it X-rayed. The doc said I would need to wear a brace and be on crutches, and would need to go see an orthopedic specialist to look at my knee and get an MRI on it...pretty much: my hike was over.
My 2+months I planned spending on the AT lasted just 7 days this year.
I’m grateful for the last 2 years of getting to spend a lot of time on the trail...,635 miles in 2016, and 806 miles last year. This year, it just wasn’t meant to be. I’ll be flying Hartford to Charlotte to Daytona Beach tomorrow evening.
Thanks to everyone who followed my journal this year. Sorry it didn’t last long. Maybe I’ll get to Katahdin one day, maybe I won’t. I sure have had a great time getting from Georgia to Massachusetts, and relaying on to you my experiences along the way. Take care, and of thanks again.
Good night from Sheffield, Massachusetts

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603244,"Well, it’s been 4 months since I got off trail just north of Mt. Race in Massachusetts at mile marker 1511 due to injury.
The MRI on my knee was negative; no structural damage, probably  just a deep bone bruise. I wouldn’t have been able to hike again for 3 weeks, and I couldn’t afford to sit up there that long and wait to get back on the trail. 
Boy, was I dejected after I got off the trail. My 2 month long hike to finish the trail lasted just 7 days. 
My knee has fully recovered; and I’m currently training to get the legs back in good hiking shape. 
I will finish the trail next year...as a matter of fact, I just purchased my plane ticket this morning. Even though I’ve hiked from Springer Approach to southern Massachusetts, I’ve decided to back track about 220 miles and begin my hike next year at Delaware Water Gap. I want to do this to make sure I’ve got my legs in the best trail shape I can get them before I enter the White Mountains.
By starting at DWG, I’ll have close to 500 miles hiked prior to getting to the Whites.
I believe that will give me the best chance to finish the trail.
I’ll be flying from Orlando/Sanford to Lehigh Valley on Friday, May 3rd...then taking an Uber or Lyft to DWG to start my hike.
Will give more updates as my hiking start date gets nearer. Chow for now!

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609908,"One month until I fly up to Lehigh Valley to begin my LASH from Wind Gap, Pa. to Mt. Katahdin, Me.Unlike last year, I’m physically ready this year. I’ve lost a little over 20 pounds, and I’ve trained differently, and more effectively, this year. Since September, I’ve been climbing AND descending 12 flights of stairs, 90 minutes at a time, at the Florida Hospital twice a week, hiking back and forth over the Port Orange Bridge twice a week with a 25 pound pack on, and swimming laps for an hour twice a week. My legs are in the best shape they’ve been in to start since I’ve hiked the AT.To make sure my body is good to go, I went up to North Georgia a couple of weeks ago and did a 4 day shakedown hike; to test my body and some new gear I have.I hiked 8 miles each day from the beginning of the Springer Approach Trail, up and over Springer Mountain, to a camping area called Hickory Flats.My body/legs/knees did great...no issues. They felt very strong.The new gear I tested was a new Osprey Exos 58 backpack, a new Enlightened Equipment quilt, and a Zpacks Plexamid tent. The quilt and backpack did fine; the tent, not so much.The Plexamid support bracket at the top busted...When I got home, I mailed it back to Zpacks, and they are sending me a new one. They said I need to pack it a little more carefully, and don’t overtighten the stays (chords).Other than that, everything is good with the body and my gear, and I’m ready to go.Since I’m backtracking on the trail a little over 200 miles back to Wind Gap, I probably won’t start my journal back again until I reach where I left the trail last year, just north of Mt. Race, in Massachusetts. We’ll see. Take care and see you from the AT...soon!

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615293,"This is my first journal entry of my 2019 AT LASH (long ass section hike). 
I got on the trail between Palmerton and Wind Gap Pennsylvania on May 9th at mile 1271 on the Appalachian Trail. Since then, I have hiked a total of 226 miles thru eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and as of today, into Massachusetts. 
My legs feel “Trail tough” and I feel confident of my chances of getting to Mt. Katahdin in Maine about 8 weeks from now.
I believe the extra 200 + miles of the trail that I’ve previously hiked give me the confidence to finish this trail.
Overall, in the last 3 weeks, the weather has been, for the most part, good; with the exception of a 3 day period out of Delaware Water Gap, when it was cold, windy, and raining...all 3 conditions needed for hypothermia.
I was close to it on the day I hiked out of DWG; a 10 mile hike to the Mohican Outdoor Center. When I got there, I was soaked thru and I couldn’t get my pack off because I couldn’t move my fingers, so the owner helped me with my pack, and sat me by the fire to thaw out.
And by the way, there is no hiking gear that is “rainproof”. If you are out in the rain long enough, it will soak thru ANY material.
I started the hike doing 8-10 miles a day. I’m currently doing 12-16 miles a day, and plan to build on that in the next couple of weeks as I hike thru Massachusetts and into Vermont next week.
So, all in all, things are going well. Glad to be back writing my journal again! Stay tuned...Good night from the AT...

I left the shelter and went up and over Mt Bushnell...not any views due to the fog/clouds. I then descended Jug End for close to 600 feet of huge rock slabs going almost straight down..a 600 foot descent in 7/10 of a mile...pretty steep! It then flattened out for the final 5 miles to my pickup point; US-7. The mosquitoes swarmed pretty bad in the lowlands; there were many bogs I hiked thru; even had to put on my head net for the first time in this years hike.
Anyway, I had just an 8 mile hike to get out to US-7 today, where Jess Treat picked me up. I stayed a night at her house last year when I got off the trail. She is the one who took me to the Great Barrington ER to get my knee looked at.
I’m taking a zero tomorrow to rest my legs, so I’ll be staying at her house for 2 nights. It was so good to get in the shower today. I got my laundry done, and she also serves breakfast, and my own room...not too bad for $40 a night!
I took my last zero in Fort Montgomery, NY about 10 days ago. I stayed at the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel, just a few miles south of West Point...
I’m ordering a pizza for tonight, then tomorrow night I’ll eat at the local BBQ restaurant they have here in town; ate there last year and it was pretty good.

It always takes a few miles of hiking on this day to get back into a hiking rhythm. 

Jess Treat dropped me off at the Route 7 trailhead around 7:30. My goal was to hike 13.5 miles to the North Mt. Wilcox Shelter. Mission accomplished. I hiked up the mountain to some Ledges with great views back to the west of the mountains I hiked over on Saturday: Bear Mt., Mt. Race, and Mt. Everett...Mt. Everett looms biggest of all those mountains on the South Taconic Range. 

I did take a pretty nasty fall later in the day. I was climbing up a steep hill on big rock slabs. I was just standing on one and lost my balance and fell backwards. Luckily no sprains or breaks, just a couple of nasty contusions on each leg. I hiked 4 more miles to the shelter afterwards. My right hamstring is sore, but it’ll be fine. 
Other than the fall, a great hiking day...

I got out of my tent, and the black bear was about 50 yards away, pawing MY bear canister!  We were all yelling at the bear, and he ran off. The bear canister worked...only a claw or tooth endenture in the hard plastic.

Today’s hike included nice views at Benedict Pond, and on top of Tyringham Cobble.
After I descended Tyringham Cobble, I came upon an AT Trail Stand with drinks, chips, candy, and a phone charging station. It was payment by the honor system...I got a Gatorade...I already was packing a lot of food, so I didn’t get anything to eat. Much appreciated to the people that set up this stand on the trail for the hikers...
I got to Upper Goose Pond Shelter around 3PM. It’s a 2 story enclosed shelter with 16 bunks, and is run by a caretaker. He’ll make pancakes for the hikers in the morning...can’t wait!

I planned to only hike to the next shelter, which was only 9 miles away, so I didn’t start hiking until about 9:30. 
A couple of miles into the hike I crossed over the Massachusetts turnpike, I-90. I then began the 800 foot climb up to Becket Mountain, which is at 2180’ elevation. The top of the mountain was wooded, so no view, but there was an old foundation of a fire tower that once stood there.
I then descended Becket Mountain and came down to Finerty Pond, a beautiful Pond in the middle of nowhere. I’ve seen many beautiful lakes/ponds in Massachusetts. I’ll be crossing over Mt. Greylock in a couple of days, the highest peak in Massachusetts. I’m looking forward to that. There is supposed to be a restaurant on top of the mountain.

I hiked 5 miles this morning to get to Cheshire where I got my 2 day resupply to get me to Bennington. As I was walking thru town, they had AT Special Event signs posted. Starting at 10 AM, they were going to have a barbecue for the hikers. I was going thru town too early, so I missed the BBQ. Oh well...I did eat some ice cream at Dollar General...
It’s funny how some of the locals react when they see a thru Hiker sitting outside the store...some look at me and probably think I’m a homeless person...others go out of their way to avoid walking by me...pretty funny. I should stick out a tin can... maybe they’ll give me some money...
After Dollar General, I began my long ascent up to the highest peak in Massachusetts, Mt. Greylock. Greylock is the first 3000+ peak since Virginia. It was an 8 mile ascent up the long mountain...it took me about 4 hours to climb.

I had a chili dog and chips at the restaurant at the summit. I then hiked the final 3 miles to my current location.
Two 16 mile days in a row...my legs are feeling it this evening.

Had a short 10 mile hike today to set me up for my pickup tomorrow that will take me into Bennington. Eleven miles to hike to VT Route 9 tomorrow to catch my ride.
Boy, I need a shower!
Two highlights today: first, I hiked into Vermont, and a little over a mile later, went over the 1600 mile marker on the AT...only 2 states left after this one, New Hampshire and Maine. Both Vermont and New Hampshire have about 150 hiking miles in each state. Maine has 282 hiking miles; the biggest state on the AT other than Virginia.
Hikers often call Vermont Vermud. The first 3 miles I hiked in Vermont did not disappoint...lots of mud on the trail, even though it has been dry the last few weeks. There were some muddy areas where my hiking poles sunk a good six inches in the muck. You get very good at walking on rocks and roots to avoid the mud, but sometimes you can’t help but step right in it...

A little extra motivation to get out of your sleeping bag and to do all the things you have to do each morning to break camp. On average, it usually takes me about an hour and fifteen minutes from getting out of my sleeping bag to hiking out.I saw a couple of neat beaver ponds today on my hike, where the beavers had built dams. While hiking by one of them, the water level in the pond was actually higher than the boards I was hiking on right beside it due to the beaver dam...I was actually looking UP at the pond level from where I was...very strange..,There was no cell reception at the trailhead where I was to be picked up, so Pete, the owner of the Catamount Motel said for me to give him a call from Harmon Hill, 2 miles from the trailhead, where I could get cell reception, and he’d pick me up in 75 minutes, enough time for me to get down off the mountain. The last 6/10 of a mile saw an 800 foot drop in elevation...it seemed I was almost hiking vertically straight down the mountain...very hard on the knees...

It was straight up the mountain from Route 9. About an hour into the hike I came to Hell Hollow Brook...a substantial stream with a footbridge; only the footbridge was washed out, so I had to Ford the stream with my backpack unclipped over my back, that way if I were to fall in the rapids, I could drop my back so it would be easier to pick myself back up. I crossed on a few submerged rocks, but the crossing went fine...

My goal was to hike another 15 miles to Stratton Pond Shelter, which will set up a 10 mile hike tomorrow to Manchester Center.
It only got up to the low 50’s today. The last part of my hike went over Stratton Mountain, a 3900 + peak that seemed to go up and up and up...I thought I would never get to the top. At the top, there was a caretakers cabin and a fire tower. The caretakers cabin had a thermometer on it which read 40 degrees. It was also raining, and the wind was blowing about 30 mph. No good scenery to see at the top due to the weather, so I hurried off the mountain top to get back in the trees again, to get a little better protection from the wind. The rain also stopped as I headed down the mountain.
It rained for about 3 hours total. I got a little cold towards the end of the hike, but not as bad as the day I hiked out of Delaware Water Gap, where I did get hypothermic.
I met a couple I hadn’t seen since New Jersey. They had been hiking with there dog, when I met them in New Jersey.

I had 10 miles to hike to get to the road where I could hitch into Manchester Center. The early portion of the hike partially walked around Stratton Pond, and then entered the Lye Brook Wilderness . The forest thru this section was about as thick and dense as I’ve scene on the AT. And the trail was a muddy, streamy mess. The ground so far in Vermont has bees saturated with water, like a wet sponge. It can’t absorb any more water...which makes for very frustrating hiking...this kind of trail zaps the energy from you quickly, and slows you down a lot.
After about 5 miles of this, I came upon a road and walked it about a mile to a great rocky overlook above Manchester Center. The trail then re-entered the woods for the final 4 miles to VT 11/30, the highway into town. It sprinkled some towards the end of the hike, but not too much.
After about 5 minutes of sticking out my thumb, I was picked up by a local who had a hair appointment in town. She dropped me off about a mile of where I wanted to go, so I stuck my thumb out again, this time with no luck, so I walked the final mile to the restaurant where I got a delicious hamburger and the grocery store where I got my resupply that will get me to Killington by Tuesday or Wednesday next week.

Part of the AT climbing the mountain was on an actual ski slope...just grass in the summer. I could see the snow making machines every hundred yards or so sticking out of the edge of the woods as I hiked up the slope. There was a huge gondola at the top of the mountain with two ski lifts going in different directions down the mountain. Pretty cool.
After Bromley, I hiked over Styles and Peru Peaks. I stopped on top of Styles Peak to grab a bite to eat, but the black flies and horse flies were so bad, I got up and hiked down the mountain.

It was misty at the start; still put my pack cover and raincoat on to start. I walked by Griffith Lake in the first mile of the hike, and a few miles later climbed/scrambled up to Baker Peak, via some very wet, slick rock slab Ledges. 
I then came to Big Branch where a local angler was fishing. I asked him the weather because I hadn’t had any cell coverage in over 24 hours. He said the rest of the day looked good, especially north, where I was headed. So I took off my raincoat and headed down the trail. Within about 30 minutes, it started raining. Lightly at first...this was around noontime. It then became a steady rain. I stopped at Little Rock Pond Shelter, put on a dry shirt to warm up, and had a little lunch. I contemplated staying there for the evening, because by this time, it was raining pretty good...but I really needed to get to the next shelter, 4.7 miles up the trail, to help set up my stay in Killington this Wednesday. So after an hour of warming up, I put my gear back on and headed up the trail, with rain jacket back on...by the way, it was a hard, steady rain.
By the time I reached Greenwall Shelter 2+ hours later, I was soaked thru, and cold. The trail the last half of the hike today was a total disaster of mud, wet roots, and tree branches sticking out in the trail to whack you in the face....fun, fun! No rain, no pain, no Maine...

Oh well...it’s all part of the AT hike experience...
Early on I crossed Bully Brook, but had to walk about 150 yards upstream to find a place to cross. After I crossed Bully Brook, I could see several nice waterfalls as I continued north on the other side.
I then crossed Vermont’s version of Bear Mountain, because all the other states I’ve hiked in also have a Bear Mountain...it was a Bear...much harder ascent than I had anticipated.
I then reached the rocky Ledges of Airport Lookout...I sat their for about 90 minutes hanging all my wet stuff out to dry in the breezy sunshine. I got my clothes mostly dry...my shoes and hiking socks are still a work in progress...The Airport Lookout is a nice view of Rutland Regional Airport and the Taconic Mountains of New York to the West.
I then rock scrambled almost straight up to Clarendon Lookout. Nice cardiovascular workout...
I then had to Ford Gould Brook...there was a log that crossed but it looked slippery and I didn’t want to take the chance...I also didn’t want to get my trail runners and socks completely soaked, so I took them off and put on my camp shoes to cross the Brook with...it was a good moving current and an average of 2 feet deep, and a little chilly...!
I have found a nice stealth camping spot just across a bridge from Sargent Brook. It seems like it’s been for ever since I’ve tented, due to all the wet weather that’s occurred. I believe it’s been 8 days ago...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616696,"Had a nice stay last night at my stealth site by Sargent Brook...quiet with only the sound of the Brook.
During the early part of my hike, I had to slide across a fallen dead tree on my backside to get over Sargent Brook, about a mile north upriver of where I had camped. It was a little harry, but made it over OK. With all the rain lately, a number of the streams that are normally passable on foot are not now...
I hiked today up and over Killington Mountain, Vermont ‘s second highest peak. It was about a 5 mile ascent up the mountain. Maple trees crowd the forest at lower elevations, but as you climb 3000 feet in elevation and higher, the pines, and then the beautiful spruces take over....the top of Killington looked like Christmas tree heaven...Christmas trees everywhere, and they smelled fantastic! I also saw a lot of Moose poop on the trail, but haven’t seen one yet.

After a 4 mile descent, I reached Churchill Scott Shelter. I had hiked just under 10 miles, and was done for the day by 12:30PM. Right towards the end of my hike I passed the 1700 mile mark on the AT..,
I put up my tent on the one tent platform they have at the shelter.
I’ve spent the afternoon in my tent catching up on my journals, talked with Terri, and made my hotel reservations for Hanover, New Hampshire for this coming Sunday-Tuesday, taking 2 zeros to rest up and get ready for the White Mountains...
I’m only hiking 4 miles in the morning. Gonna stay tomorrow night at the Inn at Long Trail, and take the 20 minute bus ride to Rutland to grab a bite to eat and get my 3 day food resupply to get me to Hanover.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617063,"A short hike today to the Inn at Long Trail. I got there about 9:30 AM, and wasn’t expecting to be able to get into a room that early, but they let me in a room right away...very nice of them. The first thing I did was start my laundry, and then I took a shower. They had some scales, so I weighed myself...186 lbs, started my hike at 214; that’s 28 lbs. lost in 6 weeks...each of my 2 long hikes before I lost 40 lbs...I’m  on my way...
After my laundry was done, I took the 20 minute bus ride into Rutland to get something to eat and get my resupply food.There was a movie theater next to the grocery store, so I went and saw “Rocket Man”, the movie based on the life of Elton John. Good movie.

I then got my resupply at the grocery store and took the bus back to the Inn in Killington.
At the Inn they have an Irish pub downstairs with a restaurant. I had Guinness Stew and a salad for dinner. Man, that was some of the best stew I’ve ever had! It tasted so good! The perfect day to end a really good day off the trail...
Expecting heavy rain tomorrow...so will get some hiking in, not just sure how much. The next shelter is 8 miles up the trail, so I’ll at least try to make it there...
And speaking of heavy rain, I ran in to Olly at the Inn today; haven’t seen him since Connecticut. I met him on my second day on trail this year at Kirkridge Shelter, back in Pennsylvania. Every time I have seen him on trail, it was heavily raining...first in New Jersey (the day I was close to hypothermia), then again in Connecticut, when we had to spend half a day in our tents to get out of the heavy rain, and now. When he saw me he said, “ uh-oh, there’s Bubblehead...we’re gonna get dumped on tomorrow...”

I only hiked 8 miles today due to the rain; I left the Inn at Long Trail at 8:30 AM, and got to the shelter around 1:00. 
I hiked past beautiful Kent Pond early on in the hike, then ascended Quimby Mountain, a 1300 foot elevation change in a mile and a third...a real ass kicker...
It’s supposed to rain all night and until lunch tomorrow. I’m hoping it’ll be done by 8:00AM. I need to get 13 miles in tomorrow to keep on schedule heading into Hanover, N.H. on Sunday. So tomorrow will be 13 miles rain or shine...The trail tomorrow will probably be under water...oh well...!

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617081,"I got up this morning planning to start hiking around 7AM, but it started raining, so I put my sleep clothes back on and climbed back in my quilt. I dozed off and on until 9 o’clock, when I got up and put my cold hiking clothes back on, and finally hit the trail at 9:40. The rain had stopped, but it was very foggy and the wind was blowing the water off the trees, therefore it felt like it was still raining.
I watered up at the stream heading down the mountain and got hiking.
I hiked almost 14 miles today, and for the first half, the trail was muddy with lots of slick, wet roots to deal with.
Finally after about 7 miles, the forest turned to pines and evergreens, and the trail became much more hikable. Pine needles always make for good trail...a much drier and smoother track.
I stopped at Wintturri Shelter and had a bite to eat and watered up again for the last 4 miles of the hike.
I finished the hike at Vermont Route 12, where a local farmer lets hikers sleep on the 2nd floor of his barn.

He also has water and an outdoor shower to use.
I also might be sleeping in another barn tomorrow night in West Hartford. There is a couple there that let hikers sleep in their barn. It’s especially good when you have to get out of the rain. 

Tomorrow is my last full day in Vermont.

Sleeping in the barn last night was an experience. It was so close to the road, every time a truck passed the whole barn shook...so it took me a while to fall asleep. 
I got started about 7:30. It was a lot of up and downs today, but each one didn’t last too long.I crossed s creek today that had a steel cable span it so you could hold on and pull yourself across. So I took off my trail runners and socks and put on my camping shoes to cross. The creek was running swiftly in the middle, but only a couple of feet deep. I made it across no problem. I put my hiking shoes and socks back on, ate a Cliff bar, then put on my backpack to continue hiking. I was ready to go but noticed I had no trekking poles (called “sticks” on the trail...). I went back to the creek, and there they were, ON THE OTHER SIDE! So I had to take off my shoes and socks again and go back across the creek a second and third time. That was my stupid adventure for the day...

I’m camping in some people’s yard in West Hartford. Ten miles to hike tomorrow to get to New Hampshire. I plan on starting early in the AM and getting there by lunchtime. I’ll grab a bite to eat there, then call the hotel to come pick me up. I believe the hotel is 3 miles south of Hanover.

I stopped at Molly’s on Main St. and had a terrific cheeseburger with fries.
I then called the hotel and they picked me up.
I got my laundry done and took a shower. I then put up my tent up outside and let it sit for a couple of hours to dry out. I also ordered to have a pizza delivered.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617389,"Long day today. Got picked up by the bus near the hotel around 6:30 AM, and was hiking by 6:45. I had about a mile road walk leaving Hanover, and walked by Dartmouth’s football stadium and athletic fields before I entered the woods. I immediately started going up, hiking first to an area called Velvet Rocks. A little later in the morning, after hiking thru a number of grassy fields, I hiked by a graveyard, and then hiked over Moose Mountains south and north peaks.
I used the privy at Moose Mountain Shelter today. It’s an open box privy...what’s different about this open box privy is it’s within eyeshot of the trail. So anyone hiking by can see you conducting your business...
Luckily, no one hiked by when I was conducting mine. I guess if someone had, I guess I would have waved and said hello...

It was a long descent from Moose Mountain north peak, and then it was right back up again, 1000 feet up to Holts Ledge...with awesome views of the surrounding mountains, including Smarts Mountain, which I’ll hike over tomorrow. Smarts Mountain has a fire tower, and is supposed to have the best views in New Hampshire prior to entering the White Mountains. At Holts Ledge, there was also a huge drop off to the valley below...the ledge being right on the edge of a cliff.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617545,"It took me a little over 12 hours today to hike 16.7 mi. I can usually hike this distance in 9 hours. That tells you how hard the trail is getting here in New Hampshire. Lots of steep angles of ascent and descent, coupled with lousy trail conditions...mud, wet roots, slippery rocks and rock slabs and lots of hand over hand climbing rather than using my trekking poles, make for many hours hiking with low mileage being the result. I have to take my time and concentrate on most every step...to keep from falling and getting hurt.
I hiked over 2 big mountains today: Smarts Mountain and Mt. Cube. Mt. Cube had huge ledges of pure quartzite rock, white and shiny in the sunshine today. A different look...
I climbed the fire tower on Smarts Mountain. If you looked northeast, you could see many peaks of the White Mountains, and looking back west, the mountains of Vermont on the other side of the Connecticut River.
I’m a little worried about my feet. The plantar fasciitis I’ve had in the past seems to be coming back...pain in my left heel. Not terrible, but bothering me somewhat. 
I also have 2 hotspots on my feet...my left pinky toe and right heel. I’ve never had a blister in my entire hike of the AT, going all the way back to Georgia. I just started wearing new trail runners yesterday....they are the exact same shoes as I wore from Pennsylvania to Hanover this year. Not sure why I have the hotspots...
I’m going to hike only 11 miles tomorrow...I’ll see how my feet do with the reduced mileage. I’ve hiked 16 miles each of the last 2 days. I didn’t feel the hotspots until about 2/3 of the way thru my hike today.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617573,"Good weather day today. Sunny, mid 70’s. Slept hard last night after the long day yesterday. Today, I cut my mileage back from 16 to 10. I’m figuring out that reducing the mileage will be the only way to make it thru the Whites. I’ve heard it prior to getting here, but until you’ve actually started hiking the trail thru here, you really don’t realize it. The trail thru here becomes more technical...you have to concentrate on every step, and foot placement becomes critical, because a missed step can end your hike...quickly.
The next 3 days will be about my biggest test so far. Tomorrow, Mt. Moosilauke, and Monday North and South Kinsman Mountains. Tomorrow on Moosilauke will be above tree line with a chance of rain/thunderstorms...so I need to be ready for ANY weather...
The descent of Moosilauke is supposed to be very hard...almost straight down rock faces that are slick and wet from the waterfalls as you descend. Just need to take it slowly one footstep at a time, using both my sticks, and at times, my hands to ease my way down the mountain. 
Ditto for North and South Kinsman Mountsin.

I’m at the Hiker Hostel just off trail. Bunk, laundry, shower for $25. I wasn’t gonna stop here, but it’s right on trail, and the last 3 days have been grueling, with much more to come! One day at a time...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617634,"I slack packed today for the first time. I hiked the trail today from north to south; I was driven around the base of Mt. Moosilauke to the north side of the mountain, and hiked it back over to the south side. Slackpacking is hiking with only what you need for the day; so my normal 25-30 pound backpack only weighed about 5 pounds today. It felt like I was walking on a cushion of air...just floating along...
The ascent up Moosilauke was the toughest part of the hike today: I used my hands along with my trekking poles to pull myself up the rock faces. For the first mile, Beaver Brook Falls cascaded right by the trail. It cascaded down the mountain as I climbed up it. The Falls were magnificent! Tumbling hundreds of feet in some places only a few feet from where I was hiking. 

Visibility was good until I came within a few hundred feet of the summit. By the time I got above tree line, visibility was about 50 feet, and the wind was blowing about 30-40 mph.
When your above tree line, the trail is marked by cairns which are triangular piles of rocks...visibility was so bad, you couldn’t see from one cairn to the next; you just had to keep looking down to make sure you were still on trail.
Just past the summit, I got off trail by around 100 feet; I couldn’t visibly see it; but I used my gps on my Guthook App to get back to the trail. No problem...
So I can now check the first major mountain of the Whites off of my list.  South and North Kinsman Mountains are next, which I’ll be hiking on Monday. 
I’ll hike over Mt. Wolf tomorrow to get me in position to get over the Kinsmans Monday. Weather not good for tomorrow, but better weather beginning Monday. Will just have to get a little wet tomorrow...

Wolf, which isn’t known as one “of the biggies” in the Whites, so I figured it would be a nice hike to get me ready for the Kinsmans tomorrow. Wrong.
I forgot, this is still the White Mountains
There was a slight drizzle when I left the trailhead, so I put on my pack rain cover. As soon as I started hiking I found a wallet in the middle of the trail. I looked in it, and it was the other Hiker who rode the shuttle with me. It had ID, credit cards, and cash in it. Her name was Sarah, and I wasn’t going to catch her because she was slack packing; I wasn’t. So I stuck it in my pocket and hiked on. The trail immediately went straight up on large boulders. About a mile later, this couple whom I’d previously met at Manchester Center, Vt. at the hostel there, came up behind me, and I told them the situation. They were hiking 3mph...very fast...so I told them Sarah should be about a 1/2 mile ahead of us. They said they’d catch up to her and give her the wallet.
I wouldn’t have given the wallet to just any fast Hiker, but I knew this couple and trusted they would give it to her.
So as I approached Wolf Mt., it started thundering; just as I got to the top, the sky let loose. The trail was already in terrible condition; one foot deep standing water in the trail, and nothing to do but to slush thru it. Add to that the rain, thunder and lightning, AND being at the top of the mountain and having to start my descent, didn’t make for very safe conditions, at all.
So the last 2 1/2 miles down the mountain on a terribly unsafe trail in a thunderstorm was not what I envisioned this morning at the beginning of the hike.
Anyway, I did make it to the shelter, soaked to the bone and getting cold. 
I quickly changed into my dry sleepwear, ate some food, and got in my sleeping quilt to warm up.
It’s finally stopped raining, and the next few days are supposed to be nice.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617956,"I began today’s hike around 6:30 AM. I immediately began hiking up South Kinsman Mountain. For the first mile, the trail followed Eliza Brook, which had some outstanding waterfalls all within a few feet of the trail. There were some really good swimming holes at the base of some of the falls.
Within 2 miles the climb required the use of my hands to pull me up via rock edges, roots, and tree trunks where I’d have to throw my sticks (poles) up ahead of me and use my hands. Very technical hiking/climbing.
Finally after 2 hours of hiking, I had hiked 2 1/2 miles and reached the summit of South Kinsman Mountain. The summit was mostly tree covered, and there was no view to be had due to the clouds. So I hiked another mile and reached the summit of North Kinsman Mountain, which was actually about 100 feet below the summit of South Kinsman. A fifty foot side trail lead to this summit. Again, no view.

On the way down, I passed the first of the New Hampshire huts, Lonesome Lake Hut. 
Tourists spend good money staying at these huts to experience the back country. Usually 3 or 4 thru hikers a day can do a “work for stay” and get a meal and can sleep on the floor for the night for helping out with some of the chores like washing dishes or sweeping out the living quarters, etc.
It took me 8 hours to hike almost 10 miles...The Whites are definitely slowing my progress!
I was finally able to call home towards the end of my hike. Life sometimes gets in the way, and I need to go home. There are more important things in life than hiking the Appalachian Trail. 
I truly enjoyed this almost 2 months on the trail, the places I visited, the sights, and most of all, the people.

Franconia Ridge is known for some of the best scenery on the AT, and today it didn’t disappoint.
A long, steep climb out of  Franconia Notch to get to the Ridge...it was sunny and warm climbing up the mountain. Once on the ridge, you climb up and over Little Haystack Mountain, followed by Mt. Lincoln, Mt. Lafayette, and finally Mt. Garfield. Four mountains in a 9 mile day. Rough, but beautiful...
The climb up Little Haystack Mt. was steep and rocky. I got to the top of Little Haystack, still below tree line. Beautiful views all around...it was starting to cloud up, and get colder...I was still in my hiking t-shirt.
Next was Mt. Lincoln, and as I climbed it I went above tree line, and it started to drizzle, and the wind really began to pick up. I put on my rain coat to keep me dry and block the wind. 
Once I began climbing Lincoln and being above tree line, I could see the trail miles in front of me, up and over Lincoln, and up and over Mt. Lafayette 2 miles ahead of me. Beautiful scenery...it looked like moonscape...solid rocks and dirt all around, with beautiful green mountains below me as far as the eye could see. 
By the time I summited Mt. Lafayette, the wind was gusting to 40-50 mph, and it was raining off and on. I had a couple take a picture of me at the summit...it was hard to stand straight with the wind gusting.
Once I started descending down Lafayette, the wind stopped suddenly...very strange...I’ve come to find up on ridgeline in the White Mountains, the weather can change on a dime. 
It was 80 degrees and sunny just a few hours earlier at Franconia Notch. Now it was around 50 degrees with heavy wind and rain.
The last mountain of the day, Garfield, was below tree line...but the trail was roots with big boulders to ascend/descend...the hardest hiking of the day.

Then hiked up Galehead Mountain and stopped at Galehead Hut to take a break, grab some water, and eat a piece of coffee cake they had out on a table. It had been cloudy with no views up to this point, but as I approached the Hut on a side trail the clouds began to part a little, showing some views of the beautiful White Mountains all around. My hiking t-shirt and pants were completely soaked out with sweat, so I sat outside on the Hut’s porch to dry my clothes in the wind. I got a little chilled, but I wanted my clothes to dry out as best they could.
I left the Galehead Hut behind and immediately began the 1 mile ascent of 1400 feet up to the summit of South Twin Mountain. The summit was above tree line, and there were quite a few hikers up there..mostly day hikers...a few section and thru hikers. I was able to get my clothes completely dry at the summit; it didn’t take long because of the wind. It wasn’t too cold at the top; I didn’t need to put on my rain/wind jacket.
After South Twin, there was actually some pretty good trail as I headed towards Mount Guyot. As I approached Guyot, I again went above tree line and had to cross a large boulder field. There were nice views again all around.
After Guyot, I did a small descent and ascent up to Zealand Mountain. The summit of Zealand Mountain was tree covered; no views to be had. I then began the long, steep, rocky descent down Zealand Mountain to the Zealand Falls Hut, where I took another short break to drink some water, grab a snack, and fill my water bottles for the night. 
I then left the Hut and hiked just 2/10ths of a mile to a decent stealth campsite. The black flies were so bad I had to eat dinner in my tent, something I had never done before.
My back is really bothering me...I haven’t mentioned it, but I hurt it a few weeks ago either ascending/descending Mt. Moosilauke or the Kinsmans. The pain is becoming too much to handle.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627671,"Hi All,
I've hiked the AT from Springer Mt. to Crawford Notch in New Hampshire over the last 4 years. I jacked up my back pretty bad last year, I believe while I was hiking North and South Kinsman Mt. It's been 9 months since I got off trail...I've been doing lot's of 5-7 mile walks here in Florida since then...my back feels better, but still doesn't feel 100%. Therefore, I'm planning on hiking the Benton Mackaye trail this year, hopefully in October...depending on what happens with the virus...
I feel if I can hike the Benton Mackaye Trail, 289 miles thru Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina, it will give me confidence that I'll be able to finish the AT in 2021 or 2022. We'll see...

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639860,"Hi All,Gonna finish the Appalachian Trail this year, the trail I began at Springer Mountain Georgia  back in 2016. I got off trail last back in 2019 when I hurt my back on North Kinsman Mountain. I hiked to mile 1847 at Crawford Notch, but could not continue on due to intense back pain. It’s been 2 years, and my back is still not 100%, but it’s as good as it’s going to get; so it is time to finish the trail. On July 5th, my wife Terri will drop me off at the Springer Mountain parking lot, where I’ll hike around 3 weeks and 150 miles to Stecoah Gap, NC.I’ll then jump north and get back on trail at Crawford Notch, NH, where I’ll hike the remaining 345 miles of the AT finishing at Mt.

I started hiking the AT Approach Trail at the top of the Falls. I met a hiker about 4 miles in at Nimblewill Gap that was hiking SOBO with his full pack. Said he was leaving next Sunday to hike the Colorado Trail. I told him my plans, and we wished each other good luck.
I stopped at Black Gap Shelter and had a snack. I then hiked the 1.5 miles left to Springer Mountain, had a hiker take my picture, then hiked .2 miles here to the Springer Mountain Shelter. I hiked 7.5 miles today. My total miles you see at 1846.6 is miles I’ve hiked to get to Crawford Notch, New Hampshire. Once I get back up there at the end of the month, I’ll restart the total mileage each day.
I’m at a secluded campsite..don’t believe anyone knows I’m here.
I got a couple liters of water from the nearby creek and went up to the shelter and had my dinner. I then put my food bag in the bear box and came back to my tent where I’ve been laying for about an hour now.

Gonna hike to Hawk Mountain tomorrow.
A good first day on trail.

I left Springer Mountain shelter around 9AM and hiked the 2.8 miles to Stover Creek shelter where I  had a snack and used the privy.
I then hiked past Three Forks and came to Long Creek Falls where I took a few pictures and filtered a couple of liters of water.
I then hiked to Hickory Flats where I ate my big meal of the day…mashed potatoes, spam on a tortilla, and hazelnut spread on a tortilla. Hickory Flats is a covered pavilion with tables and chairs, a bathroom, and a cemetery owned by one of the local churches. They let hikers use the facilities. 
I then hiked to the last destination of the day for me, Hawk Mountain shelter. There’s about 8 people here tonight. Everyone seems to be tenting; the shelter is kinda dirty. It needs a good cleaning. I didn’t stay here back in 2016 when I hiked thru.

I hiked past Hightower, Horse, and Cooper Gaps. I also hiked over Hawk, Sassafras, and Gooch Mountains.
Another great weather day; third in a row. The next couple of days we might get some weather from the tropical storm moving thru Florida tonight. Not really sure…
I’m running low on food; will be getting me a 4 day food resupply box when I get to Neels Gap on Thursday. Neels Gap is mile 31 of the AT..,that should get me to Dicks Creek Gap at mile 69, where I’ll get off trail for one night either in Clayton, or Hiawassee Georgia.

It started drizzling rain when I was about to eat breakfast this morning; so I immediately broke down my tent and broke camp before anything got wet.
So I ended up hiking the first 2 miles and got to a rocky ledge with a nice view of the surrounding mountains to the south and east and just south of Ramrock mountain, where I was finally able to eat my breakfast, drizzle free. I then hiked down to Woody Gap, where I got rid of my 4 days of trash, and used the bathroom they had there.
I then hiked past Preaching Rock and Big Cedar Mountain, both with beautiful views 
About 2 miles past Woody Gap, I filled up on water from a stream that crossed the trail.
About 3 miles later, at Jarrard Gap, I topped off my water from a very slow running water source…it took 15 minutes to fill one bottle.
I then began to ascend Blood Mountain, the highest peak on the AT in Georgia. I’ll hike over the summit first thing in the morning.
I am at Wood’s Hole shelter. Most hikers don’t use it because it’s almost 1/2 mile off the trail.
After my longest hike today, 10.7 miles, I didn’t feel like setting up my tent, especially with rain in the forecast. If you can keep your gear dry, you do it!

Had a very nice evening at Woods Hole shelter last night.
Today the hike began with the immediate ascent of Blood Mountain. Beautiful views on top of Blood Mountain. I had much better views than I had in 2016…today I was looking down on some cloud inversions on surrounding lower mountain ranges. The descent was harder and longer than the ascent. Lots of wet boulders and rocks from last nights rain to navigate. 
I finally got to Neels Gap around 11:30 and picked up my food resupply box. I also had a microwave pizza and 3 Powerades. I was extremely dehydrated. I still am tonight lying in my tent at Baggs Creek Gap. I sweat heavily and it’s hard to drink enough fluids to keep up.
After I left Neels Gap I hiked thru a rain shower that lasted about 30 minutes. More rain expected tomorrow.
I crossed 3 mountains today, Blood, Levelland, and Wolf Laurel Top. Only hiked 7.8 miles today, but it was a hard hike, plus the 2 hour stop I had at Neels Gap.

I broke camp around 8AM. I had seen that the forecast had called for rain between 12 and 4 in the afternoon, so I wanted to get as much hiking in as possible before the rain hit. I’ll hike in the rain, but if I don’t have to, I won’t.

I then went down into Tesnatee Gap…the ascent NOBO out of there was brutal..,straight up with big rocks/boulders to deal with. I finally got to the top of Wildcat Mountain which had limited views.
I then went down to Hogpen Gap, and then up and over Poor Mountain; again with limited views. 
Hiking the trail in July, the leaves are fully in, blocking many of the great views you would get in March or April. The vegetation in July grows over the trail in some spots, making for a little harder hiking. Some parts of the trail are maintained by cutting back the growth over the trail, some parts have not been touched. About a mile before I got to Low Gap shelter, I began to hear approaching thunder. So I quickened my pace. It began a light drizzle, then within about 3 minutes of arriving at the shelter, the sky’s let loose. I had made it just in time! There were 4 hikers, all Air Force retirees, who weren’t as fortunate. They arrived 30 minutes later soaking wet.

So I got under my quilt and took a little afternoon siesta. I had planned on hiking a few more miles after the rain, but it was late in the day and I was already pretty set up in the shelter, so I stayed there for the night.

Left Low Gap shelter about 8:15AM…the trail after an initial slight uphill was flat for about the next 3 miles…the flattest, best graded trail since the beginning 45 miles back at Springer Mountain. I made really good time thru this section keeping a steady 2-3 mph pace.
As Early Riser said,”the only thing better than a flat trail, is LOTS of flat trail!” 
At the end of the flat section, the trail leading up to Blue Mountain shelter for a couple of miles became a very rocky, technical trail, requiring more concentration of every foot placement, navigating thru and over the large rocks…a much slower pace…but the woods all around this section were thick and beautiful.
After a long uphill to Blue Mountain shelter, I gained cell service and called a shuttle driver to get a ride to Clayton, where I had a new cell phone charger sent to a hiking outfitter to pickup…I also needed to get off the trail for a day and recharge my batteries. I was dragging and hadn’t showered in 7 days…
I still had 2.4 miles to hike from the shelter to Unicoi Gap where I was to be picked up.
The driver took me by the outfitters to pick up my new phone charger, then dropped me off at the Days Inn. Tomorrow, Sunday, will be a zero day for me, so I’ll get back with you Monday when I head out again. Good night from Clayton, Ga.

After a lot of blood, sweat, tears and 3 section hikes this year totaling 285 miles, I truly feel my body is ready for what awaits me…

Maine and eastern New Hampshire is the most rugged and remote section of the AT, and from what I’ve been told, the most challenging and beautiful.
Weather permitting, I will summit Katahdin either Wednesday (tomorrow) or Thursday. I’ve been told it’s not a good idea to hike Katahdin on a wet day. Tomorrow looks like the best of the 2 days weather wise…I’ll make that decision tonight when I get to the 100 Mile Wilderness Inn, where I’ll be able to get the best forecast for Katahdin.
I’d rather take tomorrow off to get acclimated, but if I have to hike tomorrow, I will.

It was about a 20 mile ride.,,had to stop for a few minutes on the way due to a huge bull moose standing in the middle of the road just staring at us. That’s when it hit me that I really was in the state of Maine…
Finally got to Katahdin Stream Campground around 6:30, and registered there with the park ranger. Had to say which trails you were taking up and down the mountain. I was taking the Hunt Trail (Appalachian Trail) up the mountain, and the Abol Slide trail back down.
I left The campground around 7:30; 5.2 miles to the summit of Mount Katahdin, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. I was finally going to attempt to do what I’ve been thinking about for years.
Many, many places on these boulders where a slip of the foot or hand would be the last thing I ever did. No joke.
Once above treeline, everywhere you looked were awesome views of the Maine woods and mountains as far as the eye could see; and the woods beneath the mountain looked so far away because you were so high on the mountain above them. It’s hard to explain…but beauty was everywhere; the expansiveness of the woods was incredible from up on the side of Katahdin.
Don’t get me wrong; a lot of the rock scrambling was fun and enjoyable, but a lot  of it scared the shit out of me!
Once above the boulders and rock faces, finally, was a place called the tableland, about a mile of relatively flat hiking with a view of the gateway, which is more climbing up a ridge line to the Katahdin summit.
You finally get a good view of the gateway and summit (for the first time) from the tableland.
I climbed the gateway and reached the summit after 5 hours hiking 5 miles.

II touched the northern terminus sign, something a year ago I thought would never happen. I made it! 
I’m so thankful and grateful for my wife Terri letting me fulfill a dream. Thank you so much Terri.
I came back down the Abol Slide Trail, and I spent a lot of time “sliding” down those rock faces on my but. 
All in all, it took me 10 hours to hike 10 miles.
It is now time to finish the AT…340 miles to Crawford Notch NH, and I will be done. That journey begins tomorrow.

Filled my water from cold, clear Katahdin Stream, ate breakfast, and broke down camp. I stayed at Tentsite 22 at the campground with 3 other SOBO hikers…one from Illinois, one from Ohio, and one from Britain. The 2 Americans are Tim and John, and they don’t have a trail name yet; so I call them “Just Tim” and “Just John”, for now.
Started hiking about 6:45. A relatively flat hike all day, much appreciated after the grueling ascent and descent of Katahdin yesterday.
Had to hike 9 miles thru Baxter State Park…beautiful thick growth forests, and lots of river walking. Had to get my feet wet and ford my first creek; one of many to come in Maine.
Saw a beautiful waterfall called “Big Niagara Falls”.
A fly fisherman was at the pool at the bottom of the falls.
Also saw a beautiful bald eagle 🦅 perched in a tall pine tree along the River.
Once me and Just Tim exited Baxter, we walked to Abol Bridge where there’s a restaurant. I had a Pepsi and an Italian Sausage sub with chips. Very good.
We then hiked another 1/2 mile along Golden Road and then re-entered the woods, beginning the famous 100 mile wilderness. No services for the next 100 miles of trail until Monson, ME. at mile 115 of the AT. 
I’ll be getting a food drop on the 3rd of July 1/2 way thru the wilderness. That will give me 5 more days of food to make it to Monson.

Within the first couple of miles, I came to Rainbow Ledges, where there is a good view of Katahdin to the north. I also finally got cell phone reception, so I gave Terri a call and told her I made it to the summit and back down and lived to tell about it.
Getting to the ledges was the only real ascent of the day, from 750 to 1500 feet. The rest of the day was relatively flat, and followed the shore of Rainbow lake for over half of the day.
I took a good break and got water from the lake and sat there for a good 30 minutes listening to the water lapping on the shore. Very peaceful…the water here in Maine is crystal clear, in both the lakes and the streams.
I got to Rainbow Stream Lean-to by 3:00, and my body told me to stop for the day. My body is taking its time recovering from the ascent and descent of Katahdin…VERY sore in my legs, back, and arms. I’m hoping the deep soreness begins to subside soon.
Beautiful Rainbow 🌈 Stream flows directly in front of the lean-to. I’m up on a hill behind the lean-to with many other campers.

I started by hiking along Rainbow stream. I hiked by Rainbow Cascades….would have been fun to inner tube that section of the stream…water chutes and small water falls. This whole hike so far has been around water…beautiful lakes, streams, ponds, falls,etc.
I also hiked partially around Crescent Lake…a very beautiful location. No roads lead to the lake, but there is a boat landing with 3 canoes you can take out on the lake.
I took a snack break and talked to a NOBO hiker from Charlottesville that graduated from UVA in 2019. He now lives in DC…he left Springer on February 26…told him he made really good time. He’ll summit Katahdin on July 4th.

I then went for dinner to the Lakeshore House and had a great pizza with a Sam Adams beer. I ate with Governor Sanford, the gentleman I said went to the same high school I did, and Bait, a hiker I’ve hiked off and on again with since day 3 of my hike. He lives in Philly and went to Arizona State University…The Lakeshore House had a nice outdoor eating area on Lake Hebron…a lake I’ll hike along when I get back on trail on Monday.

Have to stop at post office in morning which opens at 9:15 to mail my trail runners I’ve been wearing back home, so probably won’t get to trail until around 10:00. Relatively flat hiking tomorrow… will still try and get about 9 miles in to the first lean-to, or to a stealth site just before or just after the lean-to.
I ate the 2 pieces of leftover pizza I had from last night for lunch, then had ice cream again mid afternoon and went to the Lakeshore House for dinner where I had teriyaki chicken over a salad and an IPA.

For the first time in this hike, the trail was mostly flat and the day was uneventful.
Me and about 5 other hikers got dropped off by Poet around 10:15. 3 of us headed south, and 2 headed north into the 100 mile wilderness. 
I hiked 9 miles to the Horseshoe Canyon lean-to, but the water source was dried up, and their weren’t any flat tent spots… so I hiked another .4 miles and found a nice camp spot right on the trail and next to the Piscataquis River.
I’ve already eaten, hung my bear bag, and gotten more water; so I’m laying in my tent and getting sleepy.

The first was just below my knees, the second was mid thigh high, and also muddy.
I then stopped at Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-to for a snack and to get some water for my hike over Moxie Bald Mountain.

By the time I reached the summit, the skies were partially clearing, and the wind was blowing 30-40mph. I had outstanding views periodically when the clouds would part for a minute or two. I stayed at the summit a few extra minutes to let the substantial winds dry my clothing.
On the descent I passed some interesting rock formations and rock caves.

A huge like, miles long and a mile wide in places. Stopped at a beautiful, secluded little beach and had a snack, listening to the nature all around me, and the cold, clear water lapping onto the shore…a very serene experience.
A little later I ran into a nice couple, probably in their seventies, doing trail maintenance. They are responsible for a 3 mile section of the trail…they’ve been talking care of it for 20 years. I thanked them for what they did, and continued on. About s mile later by s road someone had left some Gatorades on a stump. I downed one in about 30 seconds. I’m sure the couple working on the trail left them for the hikers…very nice of them to do that, and a real pick-me-up for the hikers.
I then began the ascent of Little Bigelow Mountain. The ascent was from 1200 feet to s little over 3000 feet.
I stopped at Little Bigelow Lean-to and had a snack and got some water, and stretched out pretty good. They have a trail at the lean -to that goes to “ the tubs”, It’s a creek with small waterfalls and 2 areas where you can go in and relax and have the cascading water flow over you, like in a bathtub. The water was too cold for me.
I reached some ledges and got my first view of Avery and West Bigelow peaks. They are huge and look very intimidating, like the Knifes Edge on Katahdin. I’ll be climbing both of those peaks tomorrow. Can’t wait!
I’m camping tonight at Safford Notch Campsite, just below Avery Peak. I’ll immediately be ascending Avery Peak first thing in the morning. I’m currently at 2200 feet elevation. Avery Peak is over 4000 feet, West Peak is over 4200 feet…some of the trail will be above 🌲 treeline.

Both Avery and West Peaks are above treeline and had 360 degree views. From Avery Peak, both Katahdin to the northeast and Mt. Washington to the southwest are visible on a clear day…I made out Katahdin, but wasn’t sure which mountain to the southwest was Washington. 
The views today rivaled the views on Katahdin. I could see mountains off in the distance that I’ve hiked over to get here. Just intense views of greenery and forests and millions of trees looking like vast fields of carpet, with no towns, or farms, or anything…just forests and mountains as far as the eye can see. 
When I was on Avery peak, the wind was blowing 30-40 mph. One hour later, I summited West peak, and there was no wind. On West peak, it was like you look back at Avery peak and can reach out and touch it.
The hardest part of the day wasn’t climbing the three Bigelow peaks, it was the long, hard descent from South Horn to my campsite. Rocks, boulders, roots, and steep angles of descent went on forever. Using my trekking poles at times, and sometimes throwing them ahead of me down the mountain and going hand over hand, lowering myself by grabbing a boulder or rock edge, or a tree to lower myself down.

I’m now in the most rugged terrain on the AT…southern Maine, and eastern New Hampshire where I’m only hiking at a 1 mph speed. 10 miles in a day from here on out will be a really good day.

You can get hypothermia even at 60 degrees…I’ve had it twice before on the AT,  in North Carolina and New Jersey, and it’s not a good situation to be in.

Downfall and her husband with no trail name we’re also there. They live in LaGrange, Georgia…just down the road from where I used to live in Newnan. The husband went to LaGrange High School, where I was a substitute teacher for a couple of years. He graduated in 2010…I subbed there in 10 and 11.
From the lean-to, it was an immediate climb to begin the ascent up East Baldpate Mountain. The angle of ascent was sharp…climbing up large rock faces, with ladders installed in some places where the angle of ascent was just to great to get up unassisted.
Once on top, it was above tree line, and, I know I sound like a broken record, the views were unbelievable. I could see Saddleback Mountain far off in the distance, which I summited 5 days before.
It was then down East Baldpate, and up again to West Baldpate Mountain. West Baldpate was below tree line and had no views. I didn’t even see a summit sign.
But once I began descending West Baldpate, the trees opened up to huge granite slabs with in some places, steep angles of descent. I had to really take my time down these granite slabs, so I wouldn’t lose my balance. Going down there was a nice view of the formidable Old Speck Mountain; the next peak I’ll climb in a few days after my zero in Bethel, Maine.

It was noticeably colder in the notch, blowing fog with my breath. It was s giant maze…there were a number of times I went one way, then had to turn back and go another way.
It says it’s the hardest mile on the AT…after doing it I would agree. It is, but it was also fun and extremely challenging. 
After the Mahoosic Notch, the trail went steeply up 900 feet to the summit of Fulling Mill Mountain.
I then got to Full Goose shelter and took a long break and had some lunch.
I then hiked 4.4 more hard miles to Carlo Col Shelter, which is only 1/2 mile from the New Hampshire state line. 
Today I hiked 7 miles in 10 hours.
Maine will be done in the morning. It is everything I expected and more. Beautiful vistas on almost every mountain, beautiful lakes, streams, waterfalls, and lush, thick, green forests. I will remember this beautiful hike in Maine for the rest of my life. The whole Appalachian Trail is special, but Maine is by far my favorite state, and I’ll never forget my time here. 
Good night for the last time from Maine.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655737,"Slept in the shelter last night since I didn’t get there until 6PM.
Started hiking this morning around 7:00. Within the first mile, I crossed over into New Hampshire. This hike is 281 miles in Maine and 64 miles in New Hampshire for a total of 345 miles. As of tonight, I have 54 miles to go to get to Crawford Notch. After tomorrow’s hike into Gorham, I’ll have 3 days over the Wildcats and 3 days over the Presidential’s and I’m done.
Todays hike was over Mt. Success, the first mountain in NH for SOBO’s. It was a relatively short ascent and a very long descent. I then stopped at Gentian Pond shelter and had some lunch. It was warm today with very little breeze, so I drank lots of water. I stopped and topped off my water at Dream Lake and Page Pond. I then hiked the rest of the way to Trident Col Campsite, where I am tenting tonight. 
I’m going to take an unscheduled zero in Gorham before I hike the Wildcats, which are supposed to be very tough. I have some pain in my middle back area. I think an extra day off will be good for it.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655743,"I got started on the trail about 6:20 this morning; the vortex of Gorham was pulling on me hard. The first few miles of trail were up and down, large granite slabs, some hand over hand manipulation to get up or down the mountain…the trail in this section was poorly maintained…lots of fallen trees, lots of vegetation growing over the trail, and no white painted blazes to guide me.
I then summited Mount Hayes, and for the most part, the trail mellowed out somewhat, once the trail turned from the Mahoosic Trail to the Centinial Trail, and the white blazes magically reappeared!

I was heading down Mount Hayes, when a NOBO hiker said,”Bubblehead?” It was Bald Eagle, a guy I hiked a few weeks together with back in 2017….he got off the trail at Harpers Ferry then, and I continued my hike on to Pawling, NY. It was great seeing him again…I wish we could have hiked together longer.
Ironically, we are doing the exact same section hike to complete the trail. I’m hiking SOBO from Katahdin to Crawford Notch; I’m almost done. Bald Eagle is hiking NOBO from Crawford Notch to Katahdin.He started 6 days ago. Both hikes 345 miles, both hikes will complete the Appalachian Trail for us.

We had stayed in touch for a couple of years, but then lost touch.
I finally got into Gorham around 11:00 AM, immediately got a shower and got my laundry done.
I then went to a BBQ restaurant and had fried chicken. Big mistake…southern fried chicken in northern New Hampshire was not the best choice.
I’m taking a zero tomorrow…my body is telling me to..

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655838,"The Barn Hostel dropped me off at Pinkham Notch Visitors Center around 7:45; by 8:00 I crossed NH-16 and began hiking. The AT goes right thru the visitors center parking lot.

After the first relaxing mile, the AT went straight up to Wildcat D Peak climbing from 2000 to 4000 feet in 2 miles. I put my trekking poles away and used my hands the whole way up the mountain.
On the way up the mountain, there were a number of beautiful views back across Pinkham  Notch to Mount Washington. I could see the radio towers on top of the mountain and hear the Mt. Washington train whistle as it went up the mountain with tourists. Mount Washington is so close I can reach out and touch it. I’ll be up there in a few days…it’ll be a great way to finish my hike of the Appalachian Trail.

After that grueling climb, I climbed an additional 400 feet to Wildcat Mountain. For some reason, I didn’t have great energy today. I felt like the whole hike today was a struggle. On just the other side of Wildcat Mountain, there was a great view down into Carter Notch, and the Carter Notch Hut. The Hut looked so small from the high perch I was viewing it from.
I then hiked 1000 feet down in a mile and refilled my water at the Hut.
I got water at the Carter Hut and hiked 1/4 mile down the Wildcat River Trail behind the hut to a small camping area. You are not allowed to camp within a 1/4 mile of any shelter or hut in New Hampshire. 
Long day tomorrow to the Imp Campsite with rain in the forecast.
Good night from my he Wildcat River trail.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655903,"Was expecting a hard hiking day today and I got one. Started hiking at 6:20 this morning…wanted to get to Imp Campsite by early afternoon to beat the rain that was expected, but never came.
I left the Carter Notch Hut area and immediately had a hard climb to reach the peak of Carter Dome. 1500 foot elevation gain in 1.3 miles. Like yesterday, I stashed my trekking poles on my backpack and hand over hand hiked up the mountain, kinda like Spider-Man climbing up a building . It worked for me yesterday climbing Wildcat Peak D and it worked well today climbing Carter Dome.
I then summited Mount Height, and South, Middle, and North Carter Mountain peaks. I passed Bonehead and Tin Man who continued to hike SOBO just before I reached the peak of Middle Carter Mountain. I hope to see them again when I get back to Gorham on Sunday. Not sure if I will. I told each one to text me and let me know how their southbound thru hike is going. They should finish sometime in November. I enjoyed hiking with them for the last 3-4 weeks.
The descent down North Carter Mountain was difficult. Numerous times I slid down large rock slabs on my backside to make it down.
All of the peaks in the Wildcat range are 4000 footers, with Carter Dome being the highest at 4832 feet.

Tomorrow is what I hope to be my easiest of the 3 hiking days in the Wildcats with only one peak to summit, Mount Moriah, the northern most peak in the White Mountains. I’ll then descend after Moriah for the rest of the day to Rattle River shelter, only 2 miles from US-2, where the Barn Hostel will pick me up Sunday morning.
Imp campsite/shelter is really nice. They have rebuilt the shelter pretty much, a new roof and sidewalls. They also have to wooden chairs just down the hill from the shelter at a nice overlook of the mountains and down to the town of Gorham. I sat there for a good hour relaxing. It’s 7PM, and I’m the only one in the shelter.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655990,"It was nice and quiet last night in the shelter with only me there until 5 hikers showed up after dark and cooked dinner and talked loudly…2 things you shouldn’t do if you arrive after dark…proper shelter etiquette is if you arrive after dark, you quietly set up to go to sleep…using your red headlamp and not your white one. White is for hiking, red is used in the shelter after dark. And you definitely don’t cook dinner after dark in a shelter. So rather than go to sleep at hiker midnight…that is 8PM, they finally settled down around 11PM. That’s why I usually tent out unless it’s raining when I get to the shelter. Poor decision on my behalf last night…
Today’s hike was only 6 miles, where I am currently tenting out at Rattle River shelter. The first 1.3 miles was ascending up Mt. Moriah, the last mountain in the Whites if heading north. The last 4+ miles was all down hill to the shelter. I got here at 11:30 this morning. I had a relaxing afternoon…I dozed off for about an hour in my tent, after I took a dip and rinsed all the sweat off my body in the Rattle River. It was cold, but it felt good to clean off all, or most of, the hiker stink.
All the hikers today passing me heading south had just come from town…I know this because they all smelled good, with washed clothes and washed bodies. You can smell the deodorant/perfume when you pass them, just like they know I’ve been hiking for a while because I stink.
Only 1.9 miles to the trailhead in the morning where I’ll be picked up by the Barn Hostel. I have a scheduled zero on Monday. It’s all up in the air right now about exactly when I’ll hike Mount Washington, because the weather doesn’t look particularly good for the coming week. I’m not going to wait around for ever to finish my hike. I might just have to bite the bullet, and go up in less than favorable conditions. We’ll see. I’m ready to finish this thing and go home.

I got the ride back to the hostel and grabbed a shower and washed my clothes first thing. I then went across the street to Subway and had a breakfast sub sandwich.
At lunch I went to McDonalds and then back by the convenience store to grab a couple of Powerades to rehydrate.
I spent the rest of the afternoon charging my cell phone and charger and headlamp and relaxing, talking to all the other hikers talking to them about what hikers talk about…hiking. We talk about how their hike is going, where they are going, when they left Springer or Katahdin, and how they got their cuts, scrapes, or bruises that we all have. Hikers talk about their cuts and scrapes as if they are badges of honor, telling all how hard and tough the trail is up here in the northeast. The AT hiker community is a very close knit community. It’s so great being out here because you can, for a while, not see or talk about all of the crazy stuff that’s going on in the real world, all we talk about or care about is where the next water source is, or how is the trail up ahead, or how is the privy coming up, or what is the weather going to be today…
Bonehead hiked out this morning up Mount Madison, so I won’t see him again; I gave him a fist bump this morning, told him I enjoyed hiking with him, and good luck as he walked out the door of the hostel ready for battle…
Tin Man is here and will hike out in the morning. We went and had dinner and a beer together and reminisced about our adventures of the last month.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656288,"Paul from the Barn Hostel dropped me off at Pinkham  Notch Visitors Center around 7:45, and instead of hiking north into the Wildcats like I did a few days ago from this spot, I headed south to do the presidential traverse which is the last section I need to hike to finish the Appalachian Trail.
Today was overcast and drizzly. The first 4.8 miles was a gradual ascent to Osgood campsite; then the real fun began.

Within a mile of leaving Osgood Tentsite, where I got another liter of water, I reached tree line on Mount Madison. Everyone says you’ll hate the ascent/descent on the north side of Madison, especially if it’s wet. Once above treeline, it became a boulder field of big rocks/boulders. Even though they were wet, the rocks weren’t slick, so my trail runners grabbed them pretty good. There were no views, just whiteness of being in a cloud.
I put away my trekking poles and began using my hands to grab the boulders to steady myself up the mountain. I found myself actually enjoying this section. 
I passed a hiker who had a bloody shin from her trek down the mountain. I was thankful to be going up. Down would have not been fun at all. 
Even though visibility was zero, there was very little wind, which helped me to stay warm. Wind here the other day was 50mph.
After a long trek up Madison, I reached the summit at 5367 feet. There was not any sign at the summit, and I had to look at my FarOut Map on my phone to see if indeed this was the summit, and it was.
I then began the dreaded descent. The good thing is it was less than half a mile to Madison Spring Hut; it still took me an hour to do .4 miles.
I got to the hut and dried off a little, and fill up on water. I then headed 1/2 a mile down the Valley Way trail to the Valley Way campsite. There was one other hiker there.
All in all, I did what I set out to do today.

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656338,"Got an early start and had a steep 1/2 mile ascent to get back up to the AT at Madison Springs Hut. I refilled both of my Smartwater bottles there and then began my hike up to Mount Washington and ultimately to Lakes of the Clouds Hut, where I had made a reservation for an overnight stay.
From the hut, it was immediately a 700 foot ascent up to Thunderstorm Junction, where there was a massive cairn marking the 5 way intersection of a number of trails leading in all directions.
I passed 3 blue blaze trails leading to the summits of Mounts Adams, Jefferson, and Clay. I stuck to the AT since there were relatively speaking no views from any of those summits today.
I was in the middle of a 13 mile section of the trail all above tree line… so the trail wasn’t marked by the normal white painted blazes on the trees, because there were no trees. The trail instead was marked by rock cairns; a pile of rocks stacked in a triangular shape.
I knew I was getting close to Washington because the whistle of the train going up and down the mountain was getting really close, and finally the train tracks, and finally one of the trains appeared out of the fog. I was close enough to where I waved to the passengers, and they waved back. I don’t know why, but when I waved to them, I got emotional, realizing my dream of completing the Appalachian Trail was becoming a reality, and was about to come to an end.
Finally, the buildings on top of Washington finally came into view.
When I got to the top, I immediately came upon the Mount Washington summit sign, where I had a gentleman take my picture. I then went inside to the restaurant and had 2 hot dogs and a Powerade.
I then began my descent down to Lakes of the Clouds Hut which was 1200 feet in a little over a mile. The trail, for whatever reason, was much better on the south side of Washington than the north side. And I could see the entire trail to the hut, and the hut itself, all in front of me as I headed down the mountain….still no trees, just sand and rocks; kind of a moonscape.
I got to the hut, got my bunk, then had a very good dinner of lasagna, corn, bread, and a salad.
All in all, a very good day. I finally climbed Mount Washington!

Bubblehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656371,"Woke up this morning and had a good breakfast of oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and bacon and coffee. The kids that run the huts are called “the croo.” The Lakes of the Clouds Hut is the largest hut accommodating 92 hikers everyday during the busy season. They do funny skits for the guests. The 6:30 alarm clock this morning was a kid singing into the bunk rooms playing the guitar. Their work schedule is 11 days on, 3 days off. They do get paid and they eat and sleep for free. Most of the kids are recent college graduates.

I began my last full day of hiking, and within 15 minutes, the clouds blew in and the wind went from 10 mph to 50 mph just like that. I had my rain jacket on for wind protection and it kept me warm as temps were in the mid 40’s to begin my hiking day. The trail was difficult in places, but tamer here on the south side of Washington than yesterday on the north side.
With the clouds swirling all around me at 50mph, and visibility not good at all, I mentioned to another gentleman hiking SOBO with me that it looked like a vast moonscape we were walking on. Rocks, dirts, and no trees with clouds flying by us over the ridge.
On my trek towards treeline, I hiked past Mounts Monroe, Eisenhower, and Pierce with off shooting trails to each of the summits. But at this elevation, all the summits were were big piles of rocks with a view, and since there was no view, I stuck to the AT.
After 4 1/2 miles, I made it to Mizpah Hut, the last hut SOBO on the presidential traverse. And, I was finally back under tree line after 13 straight miles over it. This hut was less than half the size of Lakes of the Clouds hut.
I ate some food, drank and then refilled my water bottles, and used the bathroom, before I was off on the AT again and heading south to Webster Cliffs, 4 1/2 miles further to the south.
Mount Jackson was the next mountain to climb and the last 4k footer I would summit on my hike. It was an unexpected hard ascent and descent. Lots of throwing my trekking poles ahead of me and using my hands to grab the big rocks and boulders.
After I summited Mount Webster, I finally made it to the Webster Cliffs, where I found a good flat spot where I could put my tent, 2000 feet above Crawford Notch, with a breathtaking view where I will complete my LASH and the entirety of the Appalachian Trail. 1.9 miles to go tomorrow morning!

My tent was 50 feet from the 1800 foot drop off from the cliff down to Crawford Notch. I sat on the cliff and had dinner with astounding views up and down the Crawford Notch valley, and across the valley to the impressive Wiley Mountain on the other side. I could see the parking lot of the trailhead far below where I would end my hike.
And to top it off, there was a full moon last night that lit up the woods all night long.
I started my last 1.9 miles of my AT hike around 6:20, and it was down, down, and more down the mountain.
But after the first 20 minutes or so of hand over hand hiking (and sliding) down large rock slabs, the trail became an easier walking trail, though I continued to descend.
I crossed the Saco River .1 mile from the trailhead, I took a picture of the last white blaze I would walk by, and just like that, my hike of the Appalachian Trail was complete.
No emotions at the end, just a deep feeling of satisfaction.
About an hour later, Jack drove up and picked me up, and we headed to his home in Webster, NH, where he let me take a shower and relax for a couple of hours before heading to my hotel. Jack and his wife Jean have a beautiful home on the Blackwater River. We walked around and he showed me their property, a lovely place. I told him I still felt like I was on the AT, it was so quiet and peaceful there. I also enjoyed meeting their dog Milley.Jack drove 4 hours total, let me relax in his home and take a shower. He and his wife Jean were so gracious. Jack is a true trail angel, and I greatly appreciate what he did for me. Like he told me, and I’ve heard many times before, “the trail provides.” I also enjoyed meeting their dog Milley, who gave me many licks on the face on the drive back to their home.
