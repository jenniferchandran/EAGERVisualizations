Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569175,"First day of section hiking the AT.  Today was the first white blazes I have ever passed.  It was a long time coming and I actually got emotional once while walking past and looking at one of those white blazes.  I've read that those white blazes become quite a sense of comfort and I'll have to agree.  Two friends of mine and I spent two days doing the WV section of the trail, about 20 miles.  We parked our car for the night at the Tea Horse Hostel in Harpers Ferry and got a shuttle from there with Laurel.  She was nice and agreed to come early since we arrived early.  She took us to the Snickers Gap parking lot.  It was packed!  This was Memorial Day weekend and there were many people on the trail, especially up to the overlook at Raven Rocks, shortly after crossing from Virginia into West Virginia.  The view was fantastic.  Of the 4 or 5 views we could have had over the weekend, all but Raven Rocks were fogged out.  We did get a decent view from a powerline, but it wasn't great.  Once we passed that, the trail was a little quieter.  We did pass a group of about 20 people, all wearing the same T-shirts and they wanted to know if they were almost to Wilson Gap. They were close, but I don't know what the excitement was about, it was just a little ditch.  They had to be disappointed.  Our trip did include the last 3 and half miles of the infamous roller coaster.  Not sure what all the fuss is about, I liked it.  When we arrived at David Lesser Memorial Shelter, it was early, but already packed with people, so we went back out and just across the AT and set up camp there, which was fine.  People were pretty rowdy at the shelter until well after dark, which I didn't expect.  Overall, great day!","Snickers Gap Parking Lot

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569210,"Day 2 of WV section hike, we got up early and had breakfast and started humpin' towards Harpers Ferry.  I realize this section isn't one of the most notable on the trail, but its close to home and a good test run.  I was surprised how rocky it was.  It wasn't bad, but more than I expected, the whole part from Snickers Gap to Harpers Ferry.  I thoroughly enjoyed the hike.  One of group struggled with being out of shape and paid for it.  We had to wait for him some, which was fine, but at one point I asked some people we had seen a few times if they had seen him and they said they hadn't.  So backwards on the trail I went and he wasn't far.  I sat on a rock overlooking the Shenandoah River while we waited.  Recent rains had the river raging.  We finally made it down and across the well-known bridge over the river.  We bypassed the side trail to the ATC.  I was suprised how tough the little trail along the river in town was.  I got ahead of our group again and waited for them at Jefferson Rock.  Must say, that was a disappointing place.  We continued into town and being Memorial Day, it was nuts!  We wanted to go the overlook at Maryland Heights, but looking up the mountain, the overlook was very crowded, so we decided against it.  We crossed the footbridge over the Potomac so we could said we did all of West Virginia and we gandered at some of the ruins for the C&O Canal.  We went back into town and tried to find a place to eat.  So many people you could hardly walk, I wanted to be back up in the woods at that point.  Finally ate at Coach House Grill and Bar and the food was good, but it seemed to take a while to get.  Everywhere was busy and we were starving, so that probably made it seem longer.  After we ate, we stopped in at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  They too were very busy, and frankly, they seemed a little frazeled by all the traffic.  Just not a good time to visit.  May have to stop in another day.  In August I plan on doing another section from Pine Grove Furnace State Park in PA to Harpers Ferry.  That should give me 99 miles for the year, a good start.","near David Lesser Memorial Shelter

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570757,"My next section hike is in early August.  I will be going from Pine Grove Furnace State Park, about 80 miles south into Harpers Ferry.  In the meantime, we were visiting a friend in Martinsburg, WV.  The wife wanted to take the boy to the Smithsonian, I wanted to go hiking, so we did both.  After running through the American History museum in DC, we raced to SNP and drove to the top of the ridge at Thornton Gap.  It was nearing dark and I was afraid we wouldn't make it to the parking area I wanted to be at until dark.  The cars were 10 deep at the entrance, which surprised me at that time of day.    I informed my wife that this place was crawling with bears.  We weren't a mile into the park, going north, and a truck in front of us stopped and low and behold there was an adult bear right next to the road.  My wife got some film of it.  First time to SNP, bear count = 1.
We had gotten the family into hiking this past fall and winter.  I of course turned it into the job and constantly talked about the AT.  To the point that my son was petrified that everywhere we went, I was going to have him onto some hike from Georgia to Maine.  So we kept this a secret until we got there and got his picture by one of the concrete posts along the trail and he actually seemed excited.  I promised them it was a very very short hike up to the overlook.  It was supposed to be 3 tenths of a mile, but it didn't even seem that long.  It was about dark and my wife was concerned about bears and coming back in the dark.  But we made it and took a bunch of selfies.  The sun had hid behind some clouds, otherwise it would have been a great sunset.  The view was great and worth the little hike up that side of North Marshall Mountian.  We made it back to the car about dark and didn't get mauled by any creatures.  I have to say, the park entry fee of $25 for our short ride was worth it.  The views on that road at the overlooks were jaw dropping.  Jaw dropping is an understatement.
It was good to be back with the blazes.  I have a Facebook page where i can post more hiking pics, mainly from my section hike adventures, but I am going to add some other family pics that I like.  There is a link below.  If anyone would like to join the page, I would appreciate knowing there are people out there following along.  I make this journal for my own memory keeping and the Facebook is for sharing pictures.  But I see the benefits people can have with sharing their info and it would be nice to know others can see what's going on.","Car

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573936,It's it's Wednesday August 2nd. I'm getting ready to go out on my first long-distance hike by myself. The plan is to go from Harpers Ferry North as far as I can in 7 days. I have a shuttle that has agreed to pick me up wherever I may be at that time. I'm hoping to make it to Duncannon but we'll see how my feet feel. That is averaging 18 Mi days over what is considered pretty easy terrain. Earlier this year we did an easy 20 miles north in to Harpers Ferry. If I make it as far as I want to go it will give me 144 miles for the year which is about 6 and a half percent of the trail. I've studied the route pretty well and it seems doable.,"Home

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574898,"Today was day one of this section hike from Harpers Ferry to Duncannon, PA.  I paid to park my car at the Teahorse Hostel in town, $20 for the week.  I again used Laurel from Teahorse for my shuttle, but instead this time I started walking and she agreed to pick me up wherever I may be at the end of my hike, figuring it can't be a wide range of miles so the distance would be about the same wherever it may be.  Having her meet meet this way at the end of next week added 40 miles to my trip, 124 total miles.  She's pretty flexible and ended up even getting me a day sooner than planned due to my finishing early.This part of the trail, from what I gather, is supposed to be a little easier than other parts of the trail.  I found it to be quite tough along the way.  While I waited for my trip date to arrive, I walked up hills every day to prepare my body and I lost over 40 pounds.  My pack, fully loaded with 6 days of food, and 2 liters and 20 ounces of water was 40.3 pounds.  I never did carry over 40 at one time.Anyways, I'm an early riser and I started walking about 7am NOBO along the C&O canal towpath.  I'm no civil engineer, but I think the canal has lived out its useful life.  The climb up to Weverton Cliffs was pretty stiff, a real good climb, but I like the climbs.  Maybe its not the best approach, but its all just one day long workout to me, which I enjoy.  I passed by a SOBO flip flop thru-hiker at Gathland State Park.  I believe he went NOBO all the way from Pine Grove Furnace State Park in PA and then flipped and was heading SOBO from there, but he wasn't real clear.  He stunk like a thru-hiker, that's for sure.  I wondered how long it will take for me to earn that smell (not long).  I reached the view at White Rock Cliff eventually and spoke with a girl there who was out for the weekend or a few days by herself.  Any woman alone out there is pretty brave.  The world is full of nutballs, IMO.  She did mention she was headed to Rocky Run Shelters, which was my planned destination and I told her that was my plan as well.  But, it was somewhat early in the day when I got near the shelter.  i was aware that Dahlgren Backpack Campground had showers and it was only a little farther.  I use Guthooks AT app and I read somewhere that Dahlgren also had electric, so that was a no brainer and I headed there instead.  Being a Saturday night, I figured the shelter would be full of boy scouts or lots of weekenders.  Dahlgren could be too, but at least I could get a shower and a charge on my phone.  Dahlgren BC was smaller than I expected, but had room for plenty of people.  I got a tent pad and used it, since they are supposed to be level ground.  I did see some thru-hikers immediately upon arrival locate the stealth fire ring up in the woods.  Wish I had their experience and should have known better.  This camp was known to be close to a main road.  Any shelter or camping spot next to a road, especially on the weekends, is bound to have people that aren't backpacking just wander in and make themselves at home.  That's fine, the trail is for everyone.  But.....a guy and his daughter got the tent pad next to me.  They were nice and built a fire.  Fire's mean people will sit around and talk, which means no sleep for me.    Eventually another man and most likely his son came over and asked if they could hang out since they couldn't start a fire.  Oh great.  At one point, the man and girl said they wanted to camp for the night so they just drove up to the road and walked in the .3 miles to the camp.  I walked 20, I just wanted to go to bed.  Its all fine, I sort of expected this being close to the road.  At one point I thought they were going to bust out an acoustic guitar and start singing hymns.  I love hiking, but hate camping.  I can't sleep in a tent and I am just a very, very light sleeper.  I carry extra weight even, to try to be as comfortable as possible.  But I want to hike the AT and love hiking, so I am willing to put up with camping and socializing so I can do that.  The kicker is, the girl that was headed to Rocky Run Shelters showed up at Dahlgren because she was alone at the shelter and didn't want to stay there by herself.  I could have had the shelter to myself, or at least with only one other quiet person around.It was a good day of hiking and the people at the camp didn't keep my up too long.","Tea Horse Hostel in Harpers Ferry

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574964,"Day 2I got up between 5:30 and 6am like I did everyday on the trail.  That's about what time the sun came up. It was only a couple miles to get to Washington Monument State Park where they have a tower on top of a hill that overlooks the Cumberland Valley. The view was spectacular. There was another section hiker there that was just doing Maryland. I saw him at the backpack campground the day before.  He was a pretty nice guy. He didn't want to go to the top because he has knee problems but I told him he should, it was worth it. That was also the day that I crossed over the interstate 70 foot bridge, a bridge that I had driven under numerous times. I was also able to get to Annapolis Rocks campsite which had its own caretaker on-site and also had an overlook. They overlook there wasn't as good as I thought I had read about. The better overlook was at Black Rock Cliffs which was the next one just another mile later.  It was a pretty good view. I lost my watch as I was climbing up the rocks to get to the view at Black Rock Cliffs. I feel naked without my watch I always wear one and I was pretty upset about it, so I didn't have a watch the entire rest of the trip.  I had to keep looking at my phone for what time it was and how my pacing was. I did stop and stay at Raven Rock shelter after a pretty good climb to get up there. After the events of the previous night I pitched my tent as far away from the shelter as possible. Usually if you stay at a shelter you are admitting that you want to be a social person which that is not me, at least not for now. But I did talk to the fellas there for a short time.  There were two section hikers there and one thru-hiker that was going to have to probably flip his hike at some point and go to Maine because he's not going to have time to get there without flipping. The one section hiker was going to Boiling Springs but he didn't know how he was getting back home to Harpers Ferry.  Didn't seem like he had any plan.  The other guy had been section hiking for five years.  He was from the state of Washington and he went out for six or seven weeks at a time and he said he was about 50% done with the trail.  I thought that was a pretty good way to go about it. I can only take a week at a time and I'll be lucky to ever finish it all. It was raining a little bit in the next morning.  I never did have to pack up or pitch my tent in the rain. The trail was pretty rocky like it had been all the way from Snicker's Gap and I wondered if the entire Trail was like this, but I didn't discuss it with those guys. Like always on the second day my feet started to blister pretty bad and started to hurt pretty bad. Part of my problem is that I hike hard for long periods of time. I do make it a point to stop every two and a half hours and tend to my feet and take my socks off and let them cool off but it doesn't seem to help.  I'm sitting here right now in my house soaking my feet in Epsom salts and I'm pretty sure I bruised the foot pads on the front of my feet.  They really, really hurt. If I don't figure out how to hike with out making my feet hurt so bad I'm not going to be able to continue long distance hiking. I bought shoes that I thought were comfortable but they really weren't and I'm probably going to end up throwing them out.  It was another good day of hiking and camp was good.","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575115,"Day 3 was a day of hiking in the rain. I'm out here for one week and that's all I have so I'm not about to sit there and wait for good weather to hike. I had a poncho that covered me and my entire pack, so I hiked. I don't know why but the entire time I was out there I felt like I had a little bit of either an upset stomach or the chills but I never really felt quite right the whole time. I don't know if it was due to diet or the weather or nerves or what but I just never felt real good. I was happy but I didn't feel real great plus my feet are really hurting at this point. On the morning of day 3, I got to Pen Mar Park and there was an overlook on a little side trail and that view was spectacular even though it was raining. I took some pictures there. The climb down from there was a ""suicide"" downhill, from what I read about and I have to admit it was pretty hard on the knees and I had to really watch my step going downhill on these giant boulders. There was one really stiff climb coming up out of Tumbling Run Shelters.  That climb was pretty steep and it went on for a long time. There was a view called Chimney Rocks at the top of that but it was in the clouds, so I had to move on. My plan was to stay at Rocky Mountain Shelters but I got to looking at my app in the guides for Caledonia State Park. Now, if I was thru-hiking I would mainly stay at shelters and not pay for stuff but I'm on vacation hiking so I'm willing to spend a couple bucks for a shower. The state park at Caledonia had showers so I decided to hike the extra 4 miles to get there, which was a mistake. It was not an easy hike those 4 miles.  Just as soon as I made a decision to skip the shelter and move on to the state park, the ridge became extremely rocky and I was dead tired and needed to eat and it was pretty difficult getting down into Caledonia State Park. So when I got to the park I couldn't find the office. I went to one building that looked like an office and it was closed, so I finally called and they told me I had to take another half mile side trail, which I had no other choice at that time. Finally, I got to their office and was checking in and the guy assigned me my tent spot and I paid and while he was explaining to me how to go to my spot and display that I paid, I got sick to my stomach and then I got light-headed and I put my hands on his desk and bent forward to support myself and the next thing I know, I fell over backwards and fainted and passed out and busted my head open right there on their floor in the office. Thank goodness they didn't call 911. The first thing that I thought was if they do, that my hike is over.  So I started rattling off all kinds of details about myself and that I had gotten the certain number campsite and everything I can do to show them that I wasn't concussed and was thinking clearly. Thankfully, I wasn't concussed.  The guy there offered to drive me up to my campsite and he said someone else would be around to check around on me later but I didn't see anybody else the whole night.  There were other campers there, but not people from the park. That's the first time I have ever fainted.  My mom fainted once and it was pretty scary. I just made sure that every time I stopped somewhere, I sat down and had some water and sugar before talking to anyone. I had already been eating every time I stopped and I was drinking as much water as I possibly could, but apparently I don't think I was eating enough.  I pushed it too much that day without taking care of myself enough.  Hiking in the rain wasn't bad, but I wouldn't want to do it often if I'm out trying to enjoy myself.  The campground at the state park was a bit of a hike to get to.  There are a number of things I would do differently if thru-hiking or being out for a few weeks, and one would be avoiding long side treks like this.","Raven Rock Shelter

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575202,"Despite the events of the previous day, I decided to push it again just a little bit the next day and went 4 miles past my intended stay.  That wasn't bad because the walk the entire day was quite easy. The climb out of Caledonia State Park was known to be difficult and that was no joke.  It was difficult and once you get up to the Quarry Gap shelters that climb went on forever and it was pretty steep once you got to the top of that hill.  It was pretty smooth sailing the rest of the day. During the day I did pass the well known old fancy trail midpoint sign that was so nice that they never took it down. I also passed the midpoint for the trail this year but I didn't see the marker, so I missed it. I don't know where it was. Although my feet were killing me, the hike that day was quite easy and I got to go through Michaux State Forest which was actually a pretty nice walk. Even though my feet were killing me, I was still enjoying it. My goal was to get to Pine Grove Furnace State Park where they have the Pine Grove Furnace General Store and the AT Museum. That's a pretty good stop on the trail that everybody goes to.  The General Store is also known for the half gallon ice cream challenge, which I did not do.  I wanted to camp again at the state park so I can take a shower. My family are supporters of the Pennsylvania state parks so I don't mind paying a couple bucks, plus I get a discount for being a resident and I get a shower and I had electric that night. When I got to Pine Grove Furnace General Store I did get a dish of ice cream. I also had a burger that was pretty good. I talked to a fellow there that came out of what I thought was the State Park office (it was actually the AT museum, I was told wrong), but he didn't know anything about the campground.  He just said the camping payment is on the honor system. So I took the long walk to the campground, which was a half a mile off trail, a long ways for people who are hiking. I got to the signpost where you go into the campground and there was nothing really that told you what to do other than put your money in an envelope stick it in the slot and pick a site. Something like that, so that's what I did. I didn't have correct change so I overpaid and put the max amount of $40 in there.  Also, I didn't have anything to write with so I pulled up a bunch of tabs on the envelope so I knew it was mine if anybody question me I could tell them that I paid. I went and found a campsite that had electric and I set my stuff down, and it just so happened to be right next to the campground caretaker site. I didn't even know there was a caretaker there, but the guy started telling me how I did the whole process wrong and I had to register and he didn't really seem too happy about what I did. His wife wasn't thrilled either, but he quickly recognized my honest intentions after I explained to him what I did and he would help me and he told me there was a ranger that came around and got money every once in awhile and I should just fill out the proper envelope stick it in the thing with a note saying that my other money is in the other envelope so they can get it.  Eventually that ranger came around and I talked to him and everything was smoothed out and they got my money, so it worked out fine.  The guy ended up being a pretty nice guy, that caretaker, and the ranger was real nice. After we got all that sorted out, he offered me some corn on the cob and I accepted that. I'm pretty sure that the guy didn't even know that he just gave me trail magic. I thanked him after I ate it and told him that that was some real trail magic and I don't think he understood, and his wife didn't seem happy to be dealing with this stranger in me. But the guy gave me a wink and said he just knew I've been working hard all day and looked like I could use some extra food and I appreciated that. I thanked him again for his kindness.
When I was eating my ice cream at the store, I met some thru-hikers that were also eating. I asked them when did the rocks start and they basically said the rocks started where I started my hike earlier in the year at Snicker's Gap, and everything else before that was not as bad as it was where I had hiked. Go figure. When my wife and son and I went to Shenandoah to hike for a little bit I couldn't believe that the trail was so smooth. I'm hoping the entire south is like that so I can enjoy the south more than what I've had to deal with in this part of the trail. It's been quite rocky and I didn't even hit the bad PA rocks yet as far as I could tell. One of the fellas in the group was the only one to continue onward in the coming days. Two of the people finished their hike in Carlisle and another girl got stung and had to get off the trail. I ended up hiking some and running into that guy multiple times the rest of my trip.  Later on, he told me his trail name was Bounce, or Bones.  Talking to another thru-hiker later on, Cowboy, he said his name was Bones.  So Bounce, or Bones, either way, good guy.","Caledonia State Park

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575271,"After hiking for a few days and having my fainting episode and making sure I take better care of myself, I was getting to feel pretty good about how things were going and it looked like I was going to make my goal of Duncannon. I will be the first to admit that my problems are because I like to hike for a long time and I hiked pretty hard. There were not any hard climbs this day. I thought that it looked like there was going to be a couple and I had read about some tough terrain, but maybe I was just getting my trail legs more and more. Climbing up out of Pine Grove, there was a view at Pole Steeple Trail.  It was a little bit of a hike to get to that view and it was a disappointing for that bit of effort. There is a store and deli called Green Mountain General Store on Route 34 that I had been wanting to stop at since I was planning my hike. That was a little bit of a short side hike to get to the store, but not bad and it's well worth it if you're a hiker. I bought two Hoagies there. One I saved for later and one I devoured right there on their front porch. I bought some Pop-Tarts so I could supplement my calories through the day so I can keep my blood sugar up. They also had Andes creme de menthe ice cream sandwiches, which was probably the most delicious thing I've ever had in my life. I didn't even know they existed. I should have ate a dozen.  Anybody that's ever hiking through that area I suggest stopping at that store.  It's a nice place to stop and eat and the food was good and they were hiker friendly people, with a nice porch to relax on.
The plan was to stay at Alec Kennedy shelter. But the mosquitoes had gotten so bad and my feet hurt so bad that I decided to try to get to Route 11 in Carlisle where I could get a room for the night and really get myself fixed up because I really needed it. And if I did that I had a good shot at shaving a day off my trip so I could finish earlier and I wouldn't have to put up with another day of my feet hurting so bad and the bugs. That meant it was going to be a 27-mile day and I about ran the last 10 miles across that flat valley. That last 10 miles through the valley was actually a very nice hike.  It was getting dark and it was getting cool outside, the trail was smooth, and it wasn't rocky.  I made it to the Days Inn Carlisle just before dark. I sat outside and had some water and sugar and cooled down a bit before going in to get a room.  Staff was hiker friendly and getting a room was a big boost to my mood, and I needed to do some maintenance.  I would have liked to have spent more time in Boiling Springs, but there just wasn't any reason to really be there. I did stop at the Regional ATC office and ate my other hoagie on their porch and loaded up on water so I could make the rest of the run across the valley.  They were closed but there were people there that let me in to fill up my bottles.  This was probably my favorite day on this section hike, mainly due to the store stop, the nice evening hike, and there were some rock mazes near Alex Kennedy Shelter that were fun to get through.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575363,"The stay at the Days Inn in Carlisle really rejuvenated my body and mind.  It also made my last hiking day just 20 miles into Duncannon possible.  I ran into the thru-hiker Bounce (or Bones) that I met at Pine Grove Furnace General Store multiple times this day. The trail was pretty good today. There was supposed to be a really rocky ridge near Duncannon, according to AWOL's, but it wasn't any more rockier than any other place I've hiked on the AT. The last climb up to the last ridge before Duncannon was probably the toughest climb all week.  It went up at a steady incline of probably 45 degrees for a long ways. But again, I like the climbs so I enjoyed it. When you get to the end of that ridge, there is Hawk Rock and it overlooks Duncannon.  I knew I had made it then, viewing the destination. I had thought about getting to that rock earlier in the week and I got emotional a few times.  But there were other people there when I got there and the moment just never hit me. I saw Bounce again there and another thru-hiker, Cowboy. They're both real good guys. The climb down from Hawk Rock into Duncannon was long and steep and really hard on the knees. When you're carrying that much weight, the downhills really suck. They are just hard on the knees and the feet when they're already hurting. It actually hurt more than anything just to walk on flat pavement, and it is a long pavement walk through that town. There is a legendary hole-in-the-wall hostel in Duncannon called the Doyle Hotel. That was my goal, but I had no intention of staying there. I did want to stop in there and have lunch since I thought I heard the food was supposed to be good. I got a burger and fries and the burger was very good and the fries were good. I ran into Bounce and Cowboy again and I had seen Bounce was going through the hiker box where hikers can leave items for anyone that wants them, and I mentioned to him I had some extra food and I gave him two of my Mountain House meals that were left over.  The Doyle Hotel used to rent out rooms and I think you can still stay in the basement.  Its unclear to me whether you can even stay there or not.  On one hand, they owners were complaining about cheaper options in town taking business, but on the other hand, I think you have to press them on staying there to get a room.  Really not sure.  The owners were real quirky but I knew that going there and that was fine. I enjoyed their humor and the food was good. I have seen in Early Riser 71's videos on YouTube where there was a fisherman's campground near the river on the north end of town so I headed there and it was only five bucks to camp.  It was right next to the railroad tracks but they didn't bother me and I didn't figure they would. I can't sleep in a tent very well anyways, but I got as good a night's sleep there as I did anywhere else. The mosquitoes were pretty bad, but it was by the water and it's that time of year. The $5 camping section they have was basically on gravel parking rocks. It wasn't real easy to pitch a tent on but I don't care, and I have an air mattress. When I finalized my pick-up plans with my shuttle, Laurel from Teahorse Hostel, she wanted to go to the Doyle to eat lunch and chat with the fellow hostel owners.  So I got up the next morning and went to the Pilot truck stop across the Juniata River to get a shower because I was not going to get in that lady's car smelling like pee. I knew the showers were 12 bucks, but they were supposed to be nice and I didn't care about the cost.  I walked up to the register and told the girl I wanted a shower and some trucker just comes right in front of me and swipes his card and pays for my shower. He was just a day trucker that had built up shower points at the Pilot station and couldn't use them, so he paid for my shower and I thanked him profusely.  Free shower!  I have to tell you those showers are  real nice. I got my own good size bathroom with the toilet and shower and vanity.  They gave me fresh towels too.  I had plenty of time before meeting my shuttle, so I got real comfortable in there and spent about an hour. I got cleaned up real good and then I made the long long walk back through Duncannon to go back to the Doyle to meet my shuttle. I got there about an hour and a half early and sat on a bench in front of the Doyle.  I just went through my work emails on my phone since I hadn't looked at them all week and I had alot of time to kill. Before they opened, the Doyle's cook showed up for work early and sat out front with me while waiting for them to open.  He didn't speak though.  Eventually, Cowboy showed up again and he sat out front with us for a little while.  We got to talking and it turns out the cook at the Doyle was a former thru-hiker that made it as far as the Doyle a few years ago and stopped hiking and just stayed there and became the cook.  I didn't press him on the circumstances surrounding ending his hike, but I thought that was something, the way a life can turn out, interesting. Lunch at the Doyle was good, again. It took over 2 hours and 15 minutes to drive back to Harpers Ferry from Duncannon. I can't believe I walked that far. We got back to the hostel and I went to the ATC in town since it was just right around the corner and I wanted to use their scale. It seems like I only lost 4 or 5 lb on this trip, but I was already about emaciated as it was. I had lost 40 pounds just getting in shape for this hike.  I wanted to go to the Maryland Heights overlook.  That is the classic view over Harpers Ferry, but it looked like it was going to pour down rain and my feet couldn't take it.  People that I asked told me it was a little bit of a longer hike up there than what I had thought, so I didn't go.  Some other time. I think when I go on another long section hike, which should be next summer, I don't want to go by myself.  Mainly for the reason that I think I would just enjoy the whole trip a little more if I had someone with me. I don't need someone with me to take care of me or to help me out, I just think it would be have been more fun. My partner who did the short section hike from Snicker's Gap to Harpers Ferry is my head assistant at work.  He did the Presidential Traverse last year in New Hampshire and he wants us to go up there next year and do a section hike of the AT, basically on the hardest part of the trail. We should have 10 days to do it but it would be difficult on the office for both of us to be gone at the same time for that long.  But we've already cleared it with the boss. So that might be the plan for next year. If you ask me I'm all about going somewhere where the trail is nicer just to do some more testing on my feet because I have to get some things figured out. I can't long distance hike that hard and abuse my feet and then come home like this. A week later, my feet are just getting better to walk on.  We might go later this year towards winter and do the southern 9 miles of the roller coaster and the rest of the trail that goes to Front Royal from Snickers Gap. That would make my AT travels contiguous down to basically where Shenandoah starts going south, all the way to Duncannon. So then later, sometime in the future, I can take a week and do Shenandoah in one trip.  The two section hikes I have done amounts to about 6.6% of the trail being done.  My goal is 100 miles per year.  I did about 144 this first year section hiking, but there will certainly be some years where I will be well under 100 miles, up north.  I'm 44 years old and this should take about 20 years.  I won't be able to retire early, so this is the way it will have to be.  Since I came back a week ago, I have seen my doctor about fainting and he added some lab work to an already existing lab order.  After talking to him, and after I get the labs back, I expect a clean bill of health, but we'll see.  I have to figure out a way to slow down hiking.  Its not my style, but I will have to force myself to take it easy.","Days Inn - Carlisle

I was just happy to be there and not have it raining.  The hiking today was routine for PA pretty much.  On my way up a long climb on a gravel road, I ran across a guy pushing a bicycle style stroller and at first I thought it just had supplies in it, but there was a kid and supplies in it.  I didn't ask, but I think it was a special needs child and I'm pretty sure this guy pushed that cart quite a ways up a pretty stiff hill so he could camp with that kid.  I have a special needs daughter, and I kind of felt bad for the guy.  He said they were out for a night and told me about the camping.  It just seems he was going to go camp in nature with his kid and that was that.  I would have liked to talk to him longer, but I was in a hurry.  I really did not run in to many people on this trip.  There were times when I felt pretty alone.  Which is fine, but I felt like no one was within miles of me at times.  I slept okay on this trip.  I know I fell asleep a good bit because I kept on having some pretty funky dreams.  I didn't sleep great, but better than usual.  Frankly, lately I haven't been sleeping very well in my own bed either.  I have yet to see a bear on the AT, and I have not seen any copperheads or rattlesnakes.  I am terrified of them, but I would think it would be neat to see a rattler rattle.  I'm quite certain I walked by many snakes that I never saw.  There was alot of weeds lining the trail.  Due to COVID, there were a good number of places where there had been no trail maintenance.  Aside from doing the climb out of Lehigh Gap, and crossing the bridge in to New Jersey, I am finished with all of PA.  I have to say, I was really dreading the rocks on this part of the trip and lack of views.  But I found quite the opposite.  There were plenty of views, more than in southern PA, and there were a good number of very long stretches where the hiking was very easy, the 4 mile an hour type of easy.  I was very suprised by this.  People seem to like to debate or discuss where the rocks in PA start.  And the way people talk, the entire trail in PA is nothing but rocks with no views.  But that is not the case.  And the rocks don't really start anywhere.  There are rocks through the whole state.  There were also many very easy stretches of hiking in the south and north of the state.  I would say the severe rocks were more numerous in the north, but the entire state had a good bit of those little ankle roller type rocks.  I have heard the first 30 miles of New Jersey are rocky, so when I get that done, I will be done with what is a pretty rocky stretch from Bears Den in VA til there.  I still have the rocky parts of New Hampshire to do, and 70 miles in Maine to do.  The majority of the rest of the trail though should be easier on the feet, and if the setup I used this time really did the trick for my feet, that makes me pretty happy. After doing 50 miles in two days, my feet were beat, but that was understandable considering the miles.  I was at the car a little after 4, and it started raining.  I guess you could say the weather worked out.  Done with PA.  People seem to frown upon PA and I thought it was good, so the rest of the trail must be wonderful.  Looking forward to getting in to New Jersey and back up to Maine next year.  For those that signed my guest book, you've answered my question about if anyone was reading.  I have sometimes used this journal as a confessional or place to vent and I am probably not going to have the same approach in the future.  I am a very open and honest guy that has been through alot in the past couple years and hiking is one of my few joys in life.  I hate camping.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Shoestring,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657518,"Southern NY was a pain the butt.  Northern New York was some of the easiest hiking I have done to date.  Its just what I needed.  When I got off trail in the spring and quit early, I really need a good trip like this.  It was pretty dry, but not as dry as a normal central PA late summer.  Today was pretty easy and I knocked out the 8 miles (includes the .7 back to the trail) before 10am.  When I got to the Connecticut border, there were nine people there taking pictures and heading out for the same day that I just did.  They took the train from New York City, got a cab to drive them around and they were going to hike the 8 miles back to the train station where I just came from.  I figured it must have been nice for them and wondered how many people think they are in the city and can't get out and do stuff like that.  My stomach had not felt good since day one, I wondered if it was from them ibuprofen horse pills.  Who knows, its always something.  I felt so in knots driving back that I pulled off at a rest stop.  I got my pillow that I travel with, laid the seat back, and set a 30 minute timer on my phone.  I must have needed it because I fell asleep real fast which isn't normal and dang if that wasn't one of the best naps ever.  I felt pretty good driving the rest of the way home.  Not sure what the plan in next year, possibly SOBO from Massachusetts to the NY/CT line, and then later in the year that western White Mountains 50 miles that I need to get done.","Tony's Deli, Pawling
