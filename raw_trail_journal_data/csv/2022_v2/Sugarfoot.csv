Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646152,"I’m back!  Did you miss me?  This will be my fourth attempt to thru-hike.  If you are new to my journals, let me introduce myself.  I’m 71 years old and have been hiking the Appalachian Trail mostly solo since 1994.  It took me eight years and ten hikes to complete it in 2001, and I just keep coming back for more.  I’ve hiked everything south of New Hampshire at least two times and some states many times, especially Georgia, Virginia and Vermont.  I’ve even hiked Pennsylvania three times, earning me a plenary indulgence for any inadvertent Leave-No-Trace violations.  I haven’t kept track of all of my AT hikes, but they aggregate to at least five or six thousand miles.  So why can’t I complete a thru hike?
I was active as a volunteer with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, serving six years on its board of directors and another eight on the board of managers under its previous name, the Appalachian Trail Conference.  Conservancy is a more descriptive name of what the organization does — it conserves (protects, manages, and advocates for) the Appalachian Trail — but Conference is how it accomplishes its task, by a series of seemingly endless meetings.  There were years in the pre-Zoom era when I made as many as ten trips to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, where ATC is headquartered.  I lived in Sarasota, Florida at the time, so that meant flying to Atlanta, changing planes, flying to Dulles, and renting a car.  So a one day meeting took me three days.  I served twelve years as treasurer, and that was as exciting as it sounds.  During my tenure, ATC learned to reconcile their bank accounts and to take responsibility for their financial statements.  I would like to think that my efforts helped prepare ATC for their current four-star (highest) rating from Charity Navigator.  
My first thru-hike attempt in 2013 coincided with starting to phase-out my career as the  tax principal at a CPA firm I helped to establish.  Thru-hiking commonly coincides with major life events, like graduation from college, divorce, and retirement. From the first step at Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia, my knees hurt and after the nearly 2,000’ descent to the Nantahala River in North Carolina, they were totally swollen, painful and useless. It was my stupidity.  Instead of taking it easy on the downhill, I galumphed down, lured to my doom by the scent of bacon and burgers lofting from the restaurant at the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  I flew home from Asheville and dealt with prostate cancer that had been diagnosed just before I left on the hike.  Does anyone other than me remember the 1950’s TV game show, Queen for a Day, in which bedraggled housewives competed with pathetic stories for the sympathy of the studio audience?  My tale ought to earn me at least a washing machine.  
I was first diagnosed with patella-femoral osteoarthritis while hiking Virginia in 1997.  From the beginning I was told that my condition was progressive and degenerative and that I would eventually need knee replacements.   I tried every nostrum and remedy short of twirling a dead cat in a gunny sack over my head by the light of a full moon with a suitable incantation.  Let’s see, there was chondroitin, MSM, proteolytic enzymes, all manner of straps and braces, and even an arthroscopic procedure (bilateral release of the patellae) in 2010.  The latter was successful, for a while.  It allowed me to return to running and to believing that a thru-hike in 2013 was possible.  Silly me.  
When I fully retired in 2016, we moved to Burlington, Vermont, in a reverse of the typical direction of retirement moves.  By then I was wearing custom carbon fiber off-loading knee braces for walking and hiking, but they stopped working.  I consulted with the orthopedics department at the University of Vermont Medical Center, and they recommended physical therapy.  It worked wonderfully, and I could again hike without pain and without the awkward braces.  So in 2018, I started a flip-flop thru-hike in Harpers Ferry, heading north.  I had no trouble with the gnarly rocks of Pennsylvania or with Agony Grind in New York, on the west side of the Hudson River.  I returned home via Amtrak for a few days, and the first day I resumed my hike, my knees started to scream.  I persisted for a couple more days, but the pain was at a level of six or seven on the zero-to-ten scale, even with popping Aleve beyond the recommended maximum dose.  Why on the relatively easy terrain east of the Hudson did my knees give out?  I returned home in failure once again.  Sillier me.
This time physical therapy didn’t help, and I essentially had a choice of taking up competitive rocking or getting knee replacements.  I chose the latter and am grateful to Dr. Nick Antell of Mansfield Orthopedics in Morrisville, Vermont.  It’s not an easy rehabilitation and it takes a long time, usually 12 to 18 months.  As I found out, that’s for a return to ordinary activity, like walking a few miles on gentle terrain.  In 2020, I tried a reunion hike with my 2018 tramily (trail family), Cousin Rocky Raccoon and Willow, on the Northville Lake Placid Trail in the Adirondacks, but that was premature.  I went home after 5 days, and Willow went home a few days later with a nearly completely ruptured Achilles tendon.  The intrepid Raccoon completed the hike, her first solo hike!  
I continued rehabbing my knees and tested them on some pretty gnarly day hikes in Vermont, including the Camel’s Hump Loop that includes a section of 82% grade.  My knees felt good, and once the Covid recommendation against long distance hiking was lifted, I made plans for another AT thru-hike attempt. I started southbound from Harpers Ferry in late-August 2021, joined by Rocky Raccoon, planning to hike south to Georgia and then hike the northern part in spring 2022.  My knees did well the first week, but starting in week two, my knees started to swell and to hurt earlier each day.  When we left the trail at Swift Run Gap in Shenandoah National Park to sit out the remnants of Hurricane Ida, I returned home.  Silliest me. 
My thinking was that I had reached the limits of what I could do with the artificial knees.  I tried acting oh-so-mature about it, but the view from our living room, over the City of Burlington and across Lake Champlain, is the High Peaks of the Adirondacks.  I wanted to be there, hiking.  So I went back to the physical therapist who had guided my rehabilitation after the knee replacements.  Jack not only earned his doctorate in physical therapy but is also certified in orthopedics as well as being an avid outdoors athlete. He asked me a lot of questions about my hike and my preparation for it and pondered a good bit.  His conclusion was that it wasn’t a matter of leg strength or flexibility, but rather that I hadn’t hiked enough days in succession during my training for the hike.   I needed rebuild muscle memory and to build tolerance for the day-after-day pounding that defines a long hike.  My training for my 2021 attempt consisted of rotating a long walk with two routines at the YMCA and an occasional day hike.  It wasn’t enough.  Jack laid out a training program for me and is confident that if I survive it, I will be ready for a fourth AT thru-hike attempt.  I’ve used up my silly superlative, so it simply must work this time.  
Jack started me with a long walk (8-10 miles) one day and a short walk (4-6 miles) the next day,  once a week.  When I was comfortable with that, it was two long walks on consecutive days once a week.  And then two long walks and a short walk, and so on.  It is interval training on a grand scale.  At first my knees protested vehemently, but following Jack’s advice, I stuck with it.  Jack calls it building tissue tolerance.  I translate it as convincing my knees that life’s a bitch, it’s going to get worse, and they must adapt.  And gradually they stopped complaining and started to look forward to the abuse.  Last week, I walked five days totaling 56 miles, in addition to going to the Y four times.  Weather permitting, I occasionally wear a weighted vest weighing 30 pounds, 25% more than my maximum pack weight on the trail.  It’s made of black ballistic nylon with vertical weight pockets and has earned me more than a few suspicious looks.  My route is mostly along the lakefront bike path but includes some very steep hills and occasional paths through the woods.  I hesitate to say it, but my knees and legs feel better than they have in decades.  (Pause to knock on wood.)  My feet are well calloused and trail-worthy. Provided that I can maintain this program through the winter, I will start with confidence! 
Has there been a successful thru hike by someone with double knee replacements?  I don’t know. Stick around and let’s find out!",,View Entry,"Dec 21, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646153,"Journaling emphasizes the written word as opposed to photos or videos.  At least with respect to the Appalachian Trail, journaling appears to be in decline.  The number of hikers annually attempting to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail roughly doubled from 2010 to 2020, from about 2,000 to over 4,000. The number of Appalachian Trail journals on TrailJournals.com was 432 in 2010, hit a peak of 489 in 2015 and has declined since, to a low point of 107 journals in 2020 before rebounding to 145 in 2021.  As of today, counting my journal which hasn’t gone live yet, there are 24 journals started for 2022.  
I don’t believe that hikers are more reticent about their hikes today than a decade ago, but rather that they are sharing their adventures on other platforms, like Instagram and FaceBook, that are more user friendly and more visually oriented.  Much of the sharing is with photos and videos.  I am a private person and avoid social media, but if I really wanted privacy, I would not be writing a public journal, and especially not for the fourth time. I just prefer the written word to photos and videos so TrailJournals suits me just fine.  Once I start the hike, I’ll try to remember to take one photo a day and post it with my entry.
I’m not a Luddite.  I learned Fortran in 1968 when it still used punch cards. I designed and maintained databases in the early 1980’s.   My work as a tax CPA was heavily dependent on software for return preparation and web-based services for research.  I prefer to read ebooks to paper.  I hold no nostalgia for the slide rule that hung from my belt in high school.  It was not an ideal fashion accessory.  So it’s not a fear of or an ignorance of technology that causes me to prefer writing to taking photos or videos.  
Photos for me have two untoward effects.  First, the act of taking the photo removes me from the scene, even if it’s a selfie.  I like to nurture the illusion of oneness with nature.  Stepping back to snap a photo destroys that illusion.  Second, photos tend to freeze my memory.  I prefer for my memory to be malleable.   I want my memories to improve with each recall, like a good story improves with each telling.  I do not believe that my memory is less true if I enhance it over time.  A friend, who will probably give me hell for mentioning this, and I were emailing about Christmas, and she mentioned that her mother preferred St. Nicholas to Santa Claus and collected statues of the good saint.  I mentioned that his feast day was December 6 and asked if her mother also collected pickled boys.  That prompted a “Huh?” I explained that there was a popular legend that St. Nicholas restored life to three youths who had been killed by a butcher, chopped up, and thrown into a pickling vat.  Yummy!  It far predates the Demon Barber of Fleet Street.  I knew the story from Benjamin Britten’s delightful cantata.  She was aghast and questioned how I could believe such a thing.  I responded that I didn’t take it any more literally than I do the Bible, but what is so hard to believe about the power of unbridled love overcoming death?  Writing embodies the truth far more than photography, at least for me.
I was thinking about this as i walked yesterday morning.  Friends ask me why I walk the same route along the lakefront bike path morning after morning, just varying the distance and occasionally the return route, depending on whether I want to climb a steep hill or walk through the woods, which especially with snow on the ground, feels very Robert Frost.  These are the same people who ask why I hike sections of the Appalachian Trail repeatedly.
One reason I prefer the bike path for my morning walks is that there are plenty a side trails where I can discretely pee, which I desperately need after my morning coffee.  This time of year, it’s dark when I start my walk but I know the route by the shape of particular trees and don’t have to think much about where I am so my mind is free to wander off.   The Appalachian Trail satisfies both of these attributes — plenty of places to pee and easy navigation.  Even though it is the same route either on the bike path or on the AT,  it seems different to me each time.  Yesterday I tried engaging a snow kitty, enticing him to run toward me until he realized that I was not one of his people.  And I enjoyed watching a lady wearing much-needed gloves trying to juggle a mug of coffee, a cigarette, and her cell phone as she walked toward me.  The coffee was soon iced, and I realized that if she were a hiker, she would have scooped it up and enjoyed it as a coffee slushy.   In a matter of moments, I imagined the cat saving face by abruptly walking off the bike path like it had been his plan all along and I made the woman into a hiker.  I can’t do that with photos or film.  
I don’t always or even often succeed, but I like for my journal entries to be stories that place me back in the moment and allow me to remember it in a different way.  I try not to use excessive adjectives and adverbs that might overly define the set, so that you as a reader are free to insert yourself into the story and make it your own.  Feel free to invent your own backstory and change things around.  I do.  
I wrote in my 2018 journal about how even as a little kid, I found comfort being in the woods, not any particular woods, just being under the trees.  That’s still true, but it doesn’t explain why I want to thru-hike.  I could just find a little camp in the woods somewhere.  In my 2021 journal I offered stubbornness as a reason for my third attempt.  For my fourth attempt in 2022, I’ll offer another reason.  I hike to collect stories, some of which may even be true.",,View Entry,"Dec 23, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646154,"I have just registered my hike on ATCamp, The Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s voluntary hike registration system, to start April 21, 2022..  No other flip-floppers are registered on that date.   And I purchased my plane flight.  Now that it’s official, I expect my knees to start hurting again so I can enjoy the torment of self-doubt.  
I had my annual physical exam last week and my semi-annual dental appointment earlier this month.  I’m cleared on both fronts.  I was assigned a new physician by University of Vermont Health Services and was a little leery about meeting her.  I shouldn’t have been.  She thru-hiked in 2002!  I have an appointment with my ophthalmologist in early February, but that shouldn’t upset my plans.  I’ve booked my haircuts with Nathan until right before my hike and then have one booked in late May, when I expect to be home for a few days from around the Hudson River.  There are some hikers who don’t believe in cutting their hair or, for the men at least, trimming their beards until the hike is finished.  I’m not one of those.  There are also hikers, almost always men, who also don’t believing in bathing.  Please!  
You can read about the gear I’ll be carrying by pressing the gear button on the sidebar.  If you are reading this on a cell phone, you may need to rotate it to landscape in order for the side bar to appear.  I do.  I’ll use the rest of this entry to highlight the items that have changed since my last hike.  Every time I leave for a hike, I’m confident that I’m carrying the optimal gear, and that I’ve made the best choices for me.  And after every hike, I always make changes. It’s humbling to know that my gear will never be perfect.  I’m consoled by the belief that once safety is dealt with, gear really doesn’t matter.  Except for consumables, my pack will weigh 14 pounds, 14.2 ounces.  I call this my base weight, but there is no uniform definition.  With consumables including the three days of food and one liter of water I plan to start with, my leaving-town weight will be 22 pounds, 5.9 ounces.  Other consumables include, hand sanitizer, a small gas canister, toothpaste, dental floss, toilet paper, Dr. Bronner’s soap, Foot Glide, Aleve, Flonase, Chapstick, sunscreen, Picaridin, and cash.  I include my first aid kit in my base weight because I hope not to consume it.  I’m comfortable with this pack weight and the ULA Circuit is rated up to 35 pounds, so I’m not close to its capacity.  
If I were to omit my bear canister, the Bearikade Blazer, then I could substitute a lighter pack, like the ZPacks Arc Air 50L Robic Backpack, and even allowing for a bear bag and line, I could save three pounds.  It wouldn’t be worth it me. I love the convenience of not having to throw a bear line most evenings and having a camp stool, not to mention the positive Leave-no-Trace karma realized.  I’m extremely pleased that ATC has joined with the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club and other partners to offer a bear canister lending program in Georgia.  The Green Mountain Club offers a similar program in Vermont.  Try one.  You’ll like it, and you may just be saving the life of a bear.  
Tent Stakes
On past hikes, I’ve used ZPacks’ 6.5” Red Tough Titanium Tent Stakes for my ZPacks Pleximid Tent.  On my last hike, however, I was set up on a sand/clay tent platform above Gravel Springs Hut in Shenandoah National Park.  I was down at the hut having dinner when an intense thunderstorm rolled through, with horizontal bands of rain.  When I got back to my tent, the three stakes at the back of the tent had pulled free so that the tent wall was now inside the bathtub tent floor.  The good news was that the bathtub didn’t leak.  I was spared a wet down sleeping bag because it was on top of my NeoAir pad, floating on several inches of water.  I had to bail out the tent with my mug and blot it the best that I could.  So for this hike, I’m replacing six of the shepherd’s crook-style stakes with titanium V-stakes that offer much better holding power.  The other four guylines are not critical, so I’ll use the old stakes.  Plus, I’ll carry an extra.  Altogether, I’m adding 2 ounces to my kit, nearly the equivalent of a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie (2.6 ounces).
Washer to Unlock Bear Canister
The Bearikade uses three quarter-turn fasteners to lock the aircraft aluminum top to the carbon fiber cylinder.  It’s easy to open with a coin except when my hands are cold.  Then I need something larger to grip.  I carry a steel 1-1/2” diameter washer that I can grip even with gloves on.  The one I’ve been using has rusted so I bought a new stainless steel one that actually weighs 0.1 ounce less!
Hydration Gear
On my last hike, I carried a three-liter Hydrapak Seeker for raw water.  A Katadyn BeFree Filter screws into the top of it.  It sprang a pinhole leak on the first day.  HydraPak is one of the few gear companies that offers a lifetime warranty (Montbell and ULA-Equipment being two others) and they graciously replaced it with an updated model that features a lanyard for the cap and integrated carrying handles, very convenient when fetching water after making camp.  For this hike, I’ve returned to a one liter Platypus Hoser for my clean drinking water.  I don’t like to carry bladders inside my pack, because things have happened, so the Seeker goes in one side pocket and the Platypus in the other, each secured with a small carabiner.  On the last hike, I tried using a SmartWater bottle attached to a shoulder strap with ULA’s water bungie bottle holders.  I didn’t care for that.  I could just use a SmartWater bottle in the side pocket instead of the Platypus Hoser, except while I have an easy time retrieving the bottle, I can’t replace it in the pocket without taking the pack off.  Rather than do that, I skimp on my hydration, which is not a good idea.   
Clothing
I carried Patagonia Capiline 1 long underwear for years but eventually it wore out.  I replaced it before my last hike with their new Capilene Air that uses a Merino Wool blend.  I found it heavier and slower to dry.  For this hike, I’m using Montbell’s Zero-Line Lightweight Tights and High Neck Zipper Shirt, both odor and static resistant. The Zipper Shirt is replacing the Montbell Cool Hoodie that I’m pictured in.  I found that the combination of the Zipper Shirt with the Buff that I carried anyway saved weight and was much more versatile.  I will miss the garnet color.  Altogether, my carried clothing weighs 2.1 ounces less than on my last hike.
Sandals
For years I used a pair of Vivo Barefoot Ultra 3 shoes with the insole and tongue removed as camp shoes, weighing 7.2 ounces for the pair.  They have worn smooth on the bottom rendering them useless.  Thanks to a friend sending me a link, I’ve replaced them with Mayfly Imago 2 sandals.  The pair weighs 2.0 ounces!  They will certainly be adequate around camp, but whether they are strong enough for fording creeks and walking around towns remains to be seen.  Truth be told, I seldom take the time to change into sandals before fording anyway.  
Insoles
For about 20 years, I’ve used Green SuperFeet insoles in my hiking shoes.  I was introduced to them by Phil Oren, the famous foot guru, at an ATC Biennial Meeting.  They need to be replaced regularly, usually after about 500 miles or a year of use, whichever comes first.  Mine needed replacing and rather than just grabbing another pair of Green SuperFeet, I went onto SuperFeet’s website and tried their insole finder.  The Trailblazer Comfort insoles were recommended for me, so I bought a pair.  What the heck, right?  SuperFeet come in various lettered sizes, each covering a range of shoe sizes.  I’m fortunate that my shoe size is right at the top of one of the insole ranges, so I don’t even have to trim them to fit.  I put them in my hiking shoes, stood up, and just grinned!  It was like falling in love at first sight, when you know you will be together for life (yes, that happened to me too).  I now have about 100 miles on them from my morning walks and will probably have to replace them before my hike.",,View Entry,"Dec 24, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646184,"Santa has returned to his workshop at the North Pole.  Our tree will remain up until Epiphany, January 6.  We won’t even pretend to stay awake until midnight for the start of the new year and will forego the bubbly.  We had a dear friend from Romania who would always ply us with Veuve Clicquot Champagne, so we have tired of it.  Yes, it is possible.  The Champagne, however, was a welcome alternative to her favorite drink, slivovitz.  If you don’t know what slivovitz is, consider yourself fortunate and let it go at that.  The fireworks by the lakefront will start at 8:00, so we will stay awake for them, especially since they only last 15 minutes.  We have a great eye-level view from our living room.   I won’t make a new year’s resolution, but there are always a few holiday pounds to be shed.  I need to get in shape before my serious pre-hike regime coinciding with Lent.  
Now it’s time to make my thru-hike checklist of the remaining things I need to do.   I can’t help it.  Checklists are an occupational hazard for CPAs.  Checklists and due dates define our profession.  Some people think that checklists inhibit spontaneity.  I find that if I write something down, then I don’t have to carry it around in my brain, and my mind is freed for other things.  
There are three-and-a-half months to go before the start of my hike, and I have my gear, I’ve had my physical exam and had my teeth checked, I’ve registered my hike, my haircuts are scheduled out, and I’ve made my flight reservation.  Some, like food shopping and packing are reserved for the last week.  Other items can be done anytime, meaning that I will probably procrastinate until April 1.  I’m preparing this list for myself, but I’ll share it with you.  Maybe there will be an item that you’ve forgotten in your own planning.  If you think of something that I’ve forgotten, please note it in my guestbook!

Update hiking schedule with revised 2022 mileage figures and additional trail services.
Send new clothes to InsectShield for permethrin treatment.
Schedule car inspection (April), snow tire changeover (early May for Tom to handle), and semi-annual servicing (late May when I’ll be home for a few days).
Break in two pair of hiking shoes (doesn’t take long).
Wash and surface treat my lighter down puffy, after a winter of use.
Preprint property tax and estimated tax payment envelopes and schedule payments.
Pick up priority mail box from Post Office and stamps for mailing pack duffel home.
Restock first aid kit.
Evaluate SuperFeet insoles for replacement.
Trim body hair about 10 days prior to leaving.
Buy food for first few days.
Load pack and place in pack duffel with postage paid priority mail box, setting aside travel clothes (t-shirt, shorts, rain pants, puffy, socks) and TSA items (Sea-to-Summit daypack, electronics, electric toothbrush, mini-Bic lighter).
Confirm shuttle from Dulles to Harpers Ferry.
Download airline boarding pass.
Set alarm for 2:30 for 5:50 flight (egads).

Some of these items may strike you as odd, so for want of anything better to do, I’ll elaborate a little.
I plan my hike in detail on a spreadsheet, listing campsites, shelters and major road crossings on the left hand side.  Stop laughing, it gets worse.  Then I have four sets of columns for actual, moderate, slow and fast.  I’ve set it up so that I enter the day number and the date and daily miles pop up.  At the bottom of each set are calculations of average miles with and without zero days (non-hiking days).  It’s not really a plan because I have the three sets of tentative hikes averaging 12.3, 10.3, and 13.3 miles per day, excluding zero days.  By having three hikes with the slow being very slow, I’m hoping to avoid falling into the bad mental place of feeling behind my schedule.  I need to be home May 25 and 26 for appointments and the plan helps me know where I’ll be on the trail.  Depending upon my speed, I will be near a MetroNorth station in Port Jervis, NJ; Garrison, NY; or Pawling, NY.  I can take MetroNorth into New York City and then catch the Amtrak Vermonter to nearby Essex Junction, VT.  I am looking forward to Amtrak extending the Ethan Allen Express to Burlington this summer.  Its station will be at the bottom of the hill I live on!  I’ve only made a plan for the northern half of the trail, because once I flip back to Harpers Ferry, I’ll be on the trail for keeps until Springer Mountain.  I just downloaded the 2022 Thru-Hikers’ Companion and have started my update.  I’ll complete it when FarOut (formerly known as GutHook Guides) updates their app with the revised mileages. A schedule is absolutely not essential, but I enjoy preparing it, and I certainly have the time.Permethrin is an insecticide not a repellent.  In practice it means that if a tick starts crawling up your leg to get to the good parts and encounters your treated socks or shorts, it’s apt to die before it digs in for a nice blood meal.  I count that as a victory.  You can buy a bottle of permethrin and treat your own clothes.  It’s good for about five washes.  Or you can send your clothes to insectshield.com, pay an exorbitant fee, and they are good for 70 washes.  I have found permethrin-treated clothes in combination with Picaridin insect repellent on exposed skin to be a great combination. I’ve had Lyme Disease once, and some of the other tick-borne diseases are even worse.  DEET is equally effective to Picaridin but is noxious, feels terrible, and dissolves plastic.  Picaridin goes on like a body lotion and is actually pleasant.  
I follow the instructions provided by Western Mountaineering for laundering my down items:  http://www.westernmountaineering.com/product-details/product-tips-care/.
Bills need to be paid whether I am home or not.  A husband is very handy for such chores and I recommend them highly.  That being said, I try to make it as easy as possible.  I’m planning to be home for a few days in late May, taking advantage of easy Amtrak access.  I’ve already scheduled a hair cut and a dental cleaning then, and I’ll also schedule the semi-annual car servicing then since that is traditionally my job.  
When I used a ZPacks backpack, I purchased an Osprey Transporter to protect it as checked baggage when flying.  It isn’t necessary with a pack as sturdy as the ULA Circuit, but it just simplifies things to use it.  I’ll mail it home from Harpers Ferry.  
I have gotten in the habit of trimming, not shaving, my body hair before a hike.  It makes it easier to spot ticks and to keep a little cleaner.  I have a new trimmer this year so I am really looking forward to it.  I do it about 10 days before leaving for the hike so the inevitable itchy phase will be over.  
It will still be quite chilly in Burlington on April 21st, so I won’t be comfortable in just my hiking shorts and t-shirt.  The Montbell rain pants fit well enough that I have no hesitation in using them as travel pants with my shorts underneath.  I just wish that had a pocket or two and a fly!  My light puffy will be perfect with expected temperatures in the mid-30’s when we leave for the airport.  I’ll bring my hiking pillow case too, and if the jacket isn’t needed on the plane, maybe I can sleep a little.  Certain lithium rechargeable batteries are allowed in checked baggage, but rather than trying to figure out the rules, I’ll carry everything with a battery in my day pack as a carry on.  Bic lighters can also be carried on.   
Even at an airport as small as Burlington’s, arriving two hours before flight time is recommended, so we’ll need to leave about 3:30.  I probably won’t sleep anyway, but I’ll set the alarm for 2:30.  One of the many joys of retirement has meant not setting an alarm clock unless there is an early flight!",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646220,"First, a great big thank you to Christine who shuttles hikers around Kent, Connecticut, ranging from Harriman State Park in New York to Lee, Massachusetts.  In my guestbook, she noted that it’s just a short shuttle from Kent to the Tenmile River Station of MetroNorth, providing me with yet another option for getting into New York City for my scheduled return home in late May.  Actually, this is a very attractive alternative.  When I hiked Connecticut for the first time in Fall1999, I stayed at the Fife & Drum Inn in Kent and enjoyed an excellent dinner at their restaurant — duck flambéed table side with a nice Chilean red wine and a jazz pianist. Kent would be 65 miles further than Fort Montgomery, New York, my “moderate schedule” target.  That’s only about 15 miles further each week or two miles a day …  You see what I’m doing to myself already?  The duck will wait until I get there unless it’s a Tuesday when the restaurant is closed.  Perhaps more importantly, Christine met three 2021 hikers who had double knee replacements and shuttled two of them.  One was a section hiker, but the other two successfully completed the thru-hikes.  So I’m definitely not the first to attempt it.  I feel like slightly less of an idiot now.
Rosie also signed my guestbook and worries that with my start date, I’ll be risking “black fly attack squads further north.”  She’s right, of course, but black flies are only one of the many flies that plague hikers, including midges (no-see-ums), gnats, deer flies, horse flies and, believe it or not, moose flies.  That’s in addition to the myriad other flying insects including mosquitoes, bees and wasps.   And let’s not forget our favorite Arachnid, the black-legged tick.   So taken in context, black flies are just one of many hazards and inconveniences the hiker faces.  Hah!  Easy to say if you’ve never been mobbed by a cloud of hungry black flies that threaten to eclipse the sun, tiny little flying buzzsaws that are not satisfied until you are lying exsanguinated on the trail.   
My first encounter with black fly was in Maine in June 1992 when I paddled the Allagash Wilderness Waterway in Maine with three friends.  This was back when I lived in Florida.  We timed the trip for just after ice-out, so the flow would be near peak since we wanted to start in Allagash Stream to extend the trip.  We used a canoe livery service out of Millinocket run by a man named Crazy Eddie and had a conference call with him.  I asked the question, “I hear the bugs can be bad in June.  Are they a problem?”  I’m sure Eddie answered honestly, “Arrgh, they never bother me.”  I was accustomed to Florida mosquitoes, mostly active at dawn and dusk, and even 2” flying cockroaches called Palmetto bugs (omitted from tourist brochures), so I didn’t give it another thought.  Eddie met us at the Bangor airport, took us to a food warehouse (Costco?) to provision, and then dropped us off in an old quarry outside of Millinocket for the night.  That’s when I realized that our tent lacked adequate netting.  The mosquitoes were unremitting.  We put in on a sunny day and were immediately greeted by a cloud of black fly.  Their larval phase is aquatic in swift flowing streams and they emerge at ice-out.  Our timing was perfect.  I had never heard of them before.  The bites are quite painless since they inject an anesthetic along with an anti-coagulant.  I soon discovered that I was allergic to them.  My fingers were so swollen that I found it hard to grip my paddle.  Then it began to rain and rain and rain until the final day of the trip when we pulled into Allagash Village at the confluence of the Allagash and St John Rivers.  Chase Rapids, the major attraction, was in flood and not runnable in open canoes.  The rangers portaged us around them.  The rain would have been worth it if it had held down the black fly, but it didn’t.  I have encountered black fly many times since, and each time I react less to them to the point that they are hardly more of an annoyance than mosquitoes now, and perhaps one day I can join with Crazy Eddie in saying, “Arrgh, they never bother me,” but not just yet.  I used to take comfort in knowing that a species of black fly pollinates blueberries, but that turns out to be a discredited myth.  I’m sure the trout appreciate them.  The Vermont Center for Ecostudies reports that there are over 40 species of black flies in the Northeast, but that only four or five really annoy humans, and some of those are non-biting, merely swarming around our heads and bodies. 
Black flies are a problem in New England from about Mother’s Day to Father’s Day, but can persist longer in a cool year.  They prefer colder temperatures, so as it warms up in Spring, they seek higher elevations.   I found them crowded on the summit of Stratton Mountain in Vermont in early July one year.  I was tempted to move quickly on, but the long-time caretakers Hugh and Jean Joudry encouraged me to stick around to see what would happen next.  Before long, squadrons of dragonflies appeared and made strafing runs, consuming virtually all the black flies.  I cheered.  Dragonflies also have aquatic larval stages and predate on the black fly larvae.  The black flies emerge first and must be delighted to get shed of their vicious predators.  The dragonflies delay their emergence until the black flies are concentrated on the peaks.  It must be so depressing to the black flies to be devoured by their ancient foe.  Isn’t Nature wonderful?
You will know black flies when you meet them.  As their name suggests, they are black and about 3 mm in length.  No-see-ums, a biting midge, is much smaller at 1-3 mm and can be nearly invisible.  They are found on the AT from New Jersey south, but will probably extend their range northward with climate change.  Gnats range from 2-4 mm in length and even though they don’t bite, they can drive you crazy as they seek out the tears in the corners of your eyes.  I associate them particularly with Virginia, but gnat species are found throughout the eastern United States.  Deer flies have beautiful iridescent green eyes and are larger at 5-12 mm.  I hold them in unabashed loathing.  They target my elbows and hairline, burrowing down to my scalp.  Their bites hurt and bleed for a long time.  They are notoriously persistent in their attacks.  Horse flies range up to 25 mm and you will definitely know if one bites you.  Then comes the moose fly at a hefty 35 mm.  The larger the fly, the lower the frequency of their buzz, with the moose fly sounding like an old Douglas propellor plane.  
And then there is the mosquito, which as an insect of the order Diptera is properly termed a fly.    I just read that the word “mosquito” derives from Spanish or Portuguese “mosca” meaning fly and the diminutive “ito.”  Unlike the other flies discussed above, mosquitoes have the added bonus of carrying various viruses that can cause encephalitis in humans.  Black flies may drive you crazy, but mosquitoes can kill you.  The worst mosquitoes I have encountered on the Appalachian Trail were at Punch Bowl Shelter in Virginia, the Shaker Campsite above Tyringham, Massachusetts, and along the Arnold Trail in Maine.  
Aside from practicing the art of invisibility or trying to outrun black flies and their kin, what can you do?  I’ve already mentioned that I send my clothes to InsectShield for treatment with permethrin and use Picaridin on bare skin.  That combination seems fairly effective for me.  I prefer to tent when possible so that I have a refuge from the noxious wee beasties.  Wearing long pants and a long-sleeved shirt is recommended, but I can’t stand to do that except in cold weather.  Also, light colored clothing is recommended.  As a last resort, I carry an InsectShield-treated Sea-to-Summit head net and a baseball cap to keep the net off my face.  I haven’t used the head net yet, but carrying it has proved very effective.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646289,"On January 1, Bookworm, who completed his thru-hike in 2021, left some sage advice in my Guest Book, quoting Robert Burns, “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.”  
As Burns wrote it in his Scottish poem, To a Mouse:     But Mousie, thou are no thy-lane,
     In proving foresight may be vain:
     The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men
     Gang aft agley,
     An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,
     For promis’d joy!
How appropriate to be quoting Robert Burns, the author of Auld Lang Syne, on New Year’s Day!  Thank you, Bookworm.  It’s not his fault that I suffer at the very mention of Robert Burns.  
In 1976, I was invited to the Burns Cottage in Atlanta, a replica of his birthplace in Scotland, constructed by the Burns Club of Atlanta in 1911 and listed on The National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service.  It was January 25, the club’s high holy day, Robbie’s birthday, which they celebrate in grand style.  The highlight of the evening was piping in the haggis with 24 battle pipes.  By that time in the evening, I may have been seeing double, so perhaps there were only 12, but my hearing was not similarly impaired.  One bagpipe in a small enclosed space is agony enough but surely two dozen violates the United Nations Convention against Torture.  The exquisite pain was only exceeded by the taste of genuine haggis.  There is not sufficient single malt on Islay to make such a thing palatable.  Only once has that foul taste been exceeded in my experience, and that was a wee bite of salmon fermented in Gochujang, Korean fermented chili paste.  I actually spewed that out.  Oh, that taste haunts me still!
If I followed Robert Burns’ advice to poor Mousie, I would do no planning for my thru-hike.  What’s the point?  Some oafish farmer-poet will plow through my well-constructed burrow and well-stocked larder leaving me with nothing in the face of winter’s wrath.  My carefully curated gear will be stolen when I go to fetch water the first night.  My attempts at physical training will come to naught when I trip over a root not a quarter mile in, breaking my hip.  
But Bookworm doesn’t leave off with what he called the first lesson the Trail taught him.  He proceeds to quote Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe in World War II and our 34th president:  Plans are worthless but planning is everything.  And that’s what I want to discuss today.
On the advice of my physical therapist Jack, I’m walking a minimum of four days a week for a cumulative distance of 40 to 60 miles, in addition to getting to the Y four days a week.  So far, I’ve been able to maintain this regime even in the bleak midwinter of Vermont, but it takes planning — that word again!  When I was ready to go out at 6 AM yesterday, my first planning chore was deciding what to wear.  My goal is to be like Goldilocks and find a combination of clothes that will have me neither too cold nor too warm but just right.  Had it been summer, no thought would be required: low hiking shoes, light socks, shorts, wicking t-shirt, and a sweat band.  My first thought yesterday was that we had had three inches of snow the previous day, meaning that the lakefront bike path would be in fine shape.  The bike path is a rails-to-trail conversion so has little grade.  It’s paved, 10-foot wide, with two-foot wide gravel shoulders.  The City plows half of the path, more compacting the snow than removing it, and leaves the other half for cross-country skiers.  Walking on the freshly compacted snow is very pleasant.  The most dangerous part of the walk is the mile downhill on the sidewalk to get to the bike path.  The City plows and salts the sidewalks, but there can sometimes be patches of black ice that are nearly invisible before sunrise.  The temperature was six degrees and the windchill minus 6, but I had to allow for it to warm up with sunrise.  Indeed it did.  Three hours later, the air temperature remained 6 degrees but the windchill had moderated to minus two.  My winter boots are lightly insulated and feature Vibram’s Arctic Grip sole, which greatly improves traction on snow and some ice.  When the temperature is below about 15, I switch to SmartWool socks from my FITS light hikers.  I bought a pair of REI fleece-lined trail pants this year.  Between 10 degrees and negative five,  I add a pair of ultralight long underwear.  I have two heavier weights for colder temperatures.  My Montbell ultralight zipper shirt is perfect.  Above about 26*, my lighter down puffy is sufficient, but at 6*, I wanted my Western Mountaineering bomber jacket.  I wore my Buff pulled up over my head so that it protected my cheeks and topped it with a fleece-lined ski cap, complete with a pom-pom and tassels.  It took me a couple of years of living in Vermont to learn that insulated mittens are much warmer than gloves, and I switch to them at about 25*.    My planning, starting with knowing the weather conditions and my available clothing, was perfect and the ten miles were literally no sweat. 
My planning for an Appalachian Trail hike follows the same steps.  What are the conditions I’m likely to face?  Having been borderline hypothermic twice, I pay particular attention to weather, and start by looking at the average and record temperatures for towns near my hike,  I find the monthly tab on weather.com useful for this.  I then subtract 10 degrees to adjust for elevation.  I plan for comfort at the average temperatures and survivability at the record lows.  You can explore my clothing choices at the gear tab on the left.  Planning doesn’t predict the actual conditions I will face but prepares me for the likely range of circumstances.  I won’t be the one wearing a trash bag as a rain jacket.  My two instances of hypothermia were a sudden thunderstorm in June in Georgia and a cold rainy day on the north end of the Long Trail in July in Vermont.  So you’ll see that I carry lightweight long underwear, gloves, and a fleece cap year-round.  I was once pelted by hail blowing horizontally on Mt. Rogers in Virginia and wish I had had my Buff then!  
Planning also informs my gear choices.  I carry a bear canister because only rarely have I been able to throw a proper bear line, both because of my athletic inability and the lack of suitable trees.  Also, I’ve seen bears in twelve of the fourteen trail states, with only Maryland and Connecticut to go!  They are out there and they are hungry, and I am lazy.  Planning gives me the opportunity to know my nature and adapt to it.  
I’ve mentioned my obsessive spreadsheets with slow, moderate, and fast (for me) hikes planned out.  Do I expect to follow any of these scenarios? No way!  But I know that if I fall much behind my slowest alternative, I may be hiking in cold weather in the south after I flip back to Harpers Ferry.  I have an idea where I might be in late May when I need to return to Burlington for a few days.  I have an idea how much food I need to carry between towns depending on my pace.  Planning helps me to think flexibly and to be prepared for most of what I might actually face.  My planning is tempered by years of experience and misadventure. I prefer to make new mistakes rather than repeating the old ones.  
I think this is what General Eisenhower was getting at.  I know that a mad poet can plow through my plans at any moment, but I’ve learned to moderate my whisky consumption and won’t be ordering haggis from a menu, no matter how tempting sheep’s offal mixed with suet and oatmeal, boiled in the sheep’s stomach, may be.  Is planning essential, other than the most basic equipment and figuring out how to get to the trailhead?  Obviously not.  There are plenty of outfitters along the way, and it’s not easy to get lost on the Appalachian Trail.  Plenty of hiking virgins start thru-hikes each year and I haven’t seen any statistics to suggest that their success is any less than obsessive experienced planners.  The trail is an excellent teacher, but you may not prefer the methods the trail uses to make its points.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646357,"I hadn’t intended to write another entry about the futility and necessity of planning, but yesterday provided too good of a lesson.  I didn’t go for a walk yesterday morning because it was minus 10 degrees with a feel-like temperature of minus 37, according to Accuweather.  That’s more than I want to deal with.  When the windchill moderated to minus 17 after lunch, I walked down to the Y and worked legs, so I wasn’t a total slug.  Midmorning, I received an email from United Airlines informing me that my 5:50 AM flight to Dulles on April 21 was cancelled.  They rebooked me on a later flight, but after shuttling and visiting ATC headquarters for my photo and thru-hiker hangtag, that would have meant starting my hike around 3:00.  Too late!  I shrugged my shoulders and didn’t so much as mouth an expletive.  Welcome to thru-hiking, yes?  Things happen.  Accept it and move on.  
I checked for alternative flights to Dulles but couldn’t find anything better than United’s proposed rebooking.  So I cancelled it and they will refund the full amount.  Instead I booked an early morning direct flight on American to National Airport (that some people call Reagan) for the previous day at 6:08 AM, meaning nearly 20 minutes more sleep.  It’s easy to get from National to Union Station via MetroRail.  There I’ll check my pack for the day for $10.  I’ll mail my pack duffel home from the post office conveniently next door.  The National Arboretum on the Mall opens at 8AM and is one of my favorite places in Washington, an oasis of calm.  Most of the other Smithsonian museums open at 10 AM.  
The last time I had a day in Washington, I was with my cousin Debbie before my 2018 thru-hike attempt.  That was several days before she earned her trail name Rocky Raccoon.  We visited the Museum of the American Indian which was a wonderful experience especially in retrospect.  Rather than endless racks of baskets, pots, and arrowheads, it was organized by nation.  Cultural artifacts and history, even the most unpleasant parts, were presented as informing present culture, so that it was possible to step back, see everything as a whole and proclaim with the Great Spirit that Creation is good, very good.  But it could be better!
This time, I would like to visit the National Museum of African American History and Culture.  Like all of the Smithsonian Museums, it is free, but a timed ticket is required.  I’ve marked my calendar 30 days in advance, when the tickets are made available.  
Forgive a digression, please.  One of my fellow board members at ATC was Robert Stanton, the last director of the National Park Service to have been a career Civil Service employee and the first African American to serve in that capacity, appointed by President Bill Clinton.  The ATC board was meeting on the campus of Storer College, an historically black college that is directly behind ATC’s headquarters in Harpers Ferry.   The side trail from the AT to headquarters goes through the campus.  In 1906, it was the site of the Niagara Movement’s second conference, the first held in the U.S.  The Niagara Movement was founded in 1905 and led by W. E. B. DuBois to promote black social equality in all things, rejecting the dominant “accommodation” policies of Booker T. Washington.  It was the predecessor of the NAACP. The college closed in 1955 and the buildings now serve as one of the four regional training centers of the National Park Service.  I was between meetings and wandering around the campus to clear my head, when Bob Stanton arrived late.  He apologized and said he had come from Buffalo, New York, where he had delivered the keynote address at the centennial of the Niagara Movement. He asked if I knew what that was, and I surprised him with a 30-second discourse on the basics.  It helped that I had just read the historical marker near the college’s front gates.  He looked at me askance and asked, “You black?”  I answered, “No, but it’s my history.”  And that’s the way I feel.  Whether it is visiting the Museum of the American Indian or the Irish Hunger Memorial in Manhattan or the Stonewall National Monument in Manhattan or the Museum of African American History, I am learning about myself.  I’m not native American;  I’m not Irish; Well, I am queer; I’m not black.  But all of these things are part of what make us who we are as a nation.  I have little patience for those who would have our schools teach only polite, read white, history.  
After visiting the museum and lunching in their Sweet Home Café, I’ll walk to the REI store, about a mile from Union Station, and buy a small gas cylinder to start my hike.  The Amtrak Capital Limited leaves at 4:05 PM, arriving in Harpers Ferry at 5:16 at a cost of $11.  I’ve reserved a room at the nearby Quality Inn.  A friend Chris has offered to meet me at the station and save me a nasty walk along U.S. 340 at rush hour.  And just possibly I’ll get to have dinner with Chris and his wife Sandi.  Sandi and I served together for many years on ATC’s board before Sandi’s elevation to president and CEO a couple of years ago.  The Quality Inn is next to the trail at the Shenandoah River Bridge, so that’s where I’ll start my hike the next morning, stopping at ATC headquarters for my photo and thru-hiker hangtag.  
I could have been upset when United cancelled my flight.  Instead, I reverted to an alternative travel plan.  As I write about it, it sounds even better than my original plan.  Plus it gave me something to write about.  And it’s kind of appropriate for the eve of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646411,"Whenever I step forth from a trailhead on a long hike, especially if I’m under the tree canopy, I get a magical feeling and say to myself, “They can’t find me now!”  I never quite know who the “they” is, only that they can’t find me and that feels wonderful.  I worked as a tax CPA, and I would try to get away as soon after April 15th as possible, or “as practicable” in CPA-speak.  During tax season, I felt pulled in a thousand different directions: client meetings, staff needing guidance, emails up the wazoo, phone calls to return, and tax returns to be reviewed or even prepared.  “They” were unrelenting.  At least until cell phones came in, I knew that once I was on the trail, I was safe, at least until the next town with a pay phone.  I was blissfully invisible to the world.
I thought about this morning as I set out on my walk.  I left the condo at 6 o’clock and reached the lakefront bike path about half-an-hour later.  It was still dark except for the waning gibbous moon, two days past the full Wolf Moon.  The snow-covered path glistened and no one was in sight.  Ahhh!  Freedom!  It snowed about eight inches on Monday.  If you don’t live up north, that might seem like a lot, but our first winter here, in mid-March 2017, a snowstorm dropped 30.4 inches on Burlington, the second highest total on record.  That was fun  When the sidewalk was plowed and blown, there were snow walls four feet high lining the sidewalk.  It was like walking on an old sunken country lane.  I always think of the Sunken Lane at the Civil War Battle of Antietam, but there were no bullets flying in Burlington.  So this was nothing like that.  The bike path this morning was half cleared, the snow compacted and crunchy, good for walking.  I tried walking on Tuesday morning before the path was plowed, but would have needed snowshoes.  When I set out, it was 20 degrees, feeling like 13.  It dropped 10 degrees during my three-hour walk and will continue dropping to minus 9 by morning, feeling like minus 24.  If so, I won’t be walking tomorrow, but today’s temperature was bad enough that I saw only three others: a runner wearing micro spikes, a cyclist, and a walker going the other direction.  
I realized that there is no “they” in my life anymore.  I practiced in Sarasota, Florida and the odds of meeting former clients here are remote.  The extended federal statute of limitations on returns I prepared tolls this April 15, and Florida’s statute of limitation on accountant malpractice claims is two years, from discovery or when it should have been discovered.  So even if “they” find me, I’m likely safe from them, especially with tail coverage on my firm’s professional liability insurance policy, not that I’m aware of any errors on returns.  
I suppose there are some who would find my life without purpose now, especially since we don’t have children or grandchildren.  Instead it’s a wonderfully joyous feeling.  New people I meet will often ask what I do.  I smile politely and respond, “I’m retired.”  Very few ask what it is that I did because I no longer do it.  I do not signify, and that is fine with me.  My job now is to practice patience and forgiveness, to learn acceptance and gratitude, to love, and it’s the most satisfying work I’ve ever done.  I can look at the cute college kids at the Y and know that they look through me.  I feel no envy, knowing that they have their own mistakes to make, will fall into and out of love a dozen times, and maybe just maybe in 45 or 50 years, they will be content. I hope so.
In three months, I’ll be leaving Burlington for Harpers Ferry and the start of my thru-hike.  I just hope I can carry joy with me and that it doesn’t weigh too much.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646549,"This is what the lakefront bike path looks like this time of year.  The left side is lightly plowed for walkers, runners, and cyclists.  The right side is left untreated for cross country skiers.  This morning was on the chilly side.  When I got home at 8:30 after walking eight miles, it was minus 3 degrees with a windchill of minus 20.  That’s my limit.  I saw only one runner and one woman being walked by her very happy yellow Labrador Retriever.  I had my Buff pulled up over my head so that it covered my cheeks, leaving just my face exposed.  The opening was coated in ice crystals from my condensed breath and there were snotcicles hanging from my mustache.  My water bottle was partially frozen.  The combination of the Vibram Arctic Grip soles on my Merrill insulated boots and my carbide-tipped hiking sticks give me great traction and a complete body workout.  Without the fear of falling, my mind has the luxury of floating off to other lands.  This morning, I tried to focus my thinking on hiking food, knowing that I was going to be writing about food this afternoon, but my mental menu was stuck on hot cocoa and soup.  
Let’s start with the basics.  Why is food important?  Do you remember Pac-Man, a very early video game dating back to 1980?  Pac-Man looked like a pizza with a slice missing and was singularly focused on eating dots while evading four ghosts named Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.  Eating all the dots would advance the player to the next level.  I never had that extravagant joy, lacking the requisite eye-hand coordination for either game playing or real life.  My Pac-Man always died an humiliating and premature death by making contact with a ghost early on.  There are plenty of hikers who view food as Pac-Man dots, just something to be consumed to garner the necessary energy to hike another day.  
How many dots must a hiking Pac-Man eat in a day?  Expressed in terms of calories, backpacking burns about 500 calories per hour, at least according to the Mayo Clinic.  Assuming six hours of hiking a day plus basal metabolic requirements of 2,000 calories, that’s 5,000 calories.  I cannot eat that many dots and seldom exceed 3,000 or 3,500 calories in a day, meaning that I accrue a daily deficit of 1,500 to 2,000 calories, equivalent to the loss of about 1/2 pound of body weight a day.  That’s my actual experience for the first 10 days or two weeks of a hike, until my appetite kicks in and I force myself to eat more and particularly to spend time in towns where my primary chore becomes eating.  Not everyone finds this to be the case.  My cousin Rocky Raccoon eats like a bird, a small bird, and gained weight on our last backpacking trip.  She can carry two weeks of food that weighs less than four days of food for me.  I am mystified by her.  The 14th century saint, Catherine of Siena, is said to have consumed nothing other than a daily communion wafer for the last seven years of her life. The Blessed Alexandrina da Costa of Portugal lived exclusively on the Eucharist for 13 years until her death in 1955, and a Brazilian women is said to have lived for 60 years on that same diet.  That would be the ultimate uber ultralite backpacking diet.  You will quickly learn whether you are a truffle hog like me or a saintly raccoon.    
There are two basic ways to replenish your food on the trail: mail drops and local stores.  They are not mutually exclusive.  Some hikers with dietary restrictions or religious scruples will have no choice but to mail themselves foods they can eat.  That’s usually done via Priority Mail, which used to be reasonably priced and would assure delivery to a local post office within three or four days.  The current price for a medium Flat Rate Priority Mail Box is $16.10, and my experience is that delivery times of seven to ten days are not unusual.  Plus you are dependent upon the goodwill of family or friends to mail the packages on time.  The hours of many small town post offices have been reduced.  In 1998, I arrived in Port Clinton, Pennsylvania on a Saturday afternoon after the post office had closed and had to spend two nights at the Port Clinton Hotel unable to find any reading material other than a Louis L’Amour western.  Naturally, it was raining and the only food available was 3-C’s Restaurant (only open for breakfast and lunch) about a mile up a busy highway.  I spent hours reclining on the sagging mattress under the glare of a bare 35 watt lightbulb, thinking evil thoughts.  This was before the days of Uber and the possibility of shuttling into nearby Hamburg and the taxidermy paradise of Cabela’s.  An alternative to post offices, is to ship your package to a local motel or a store with longer hours, but even if your hikers’ guide says they accept packages, it’s polite to check with them in advance.  
Some hikers purchase all of their food before their hike or master the art of dehydration, divvying up their food into pre-addressed mail drops.  Bully for them.  Even when I was disciplined enough to manage that, I would approach opening a mail drop with a sense of dread and doom at the thought of having to eat what I had packed.  Food is more than energy dots for me, and I crave variety, flavor, and texture as well as nutrition, and my tastes change from week to week.  I have been much happier relying upon local stores, especially if there is a nearby full-service grocery store.  Occasionally it has meant hiking out of town with little more than Ramen, single-serving packages of Spam, Slim-Jims, Ho Ho’s, Ding Dong’s and Lance’s over-salted peanuts, but usually I can do better.  So what do I eat?
My preference for breakfast is pre-cooked bacon rolled in a flour tortilla and a Carnations Essential (formerly Instant Breakfast) with a tube of instant coffee added.  For a morning snack, I’m partial to jerky and dried fruit (mango and papaya being special treats).  Lunch is typically tuna, summer sausage, and/or cheese on another tortilla (I’m not a big fan of peanut butter).  In the afternoon I snack on nuts and carbs, like Fritos or Cheese-Its.  I prefer Dark Midnight Milky Ways to Snickers.  And dinner varies tremendously.  A favorite for the first two nights is cheese or spinach tortellini with a little olive oil and a shaving of Parmesan Reggiano (the harder the cheese, the longer it keeps).  Knoor’s pasta or rice sides with a pouch of tuna or chicken satisfies.  Stove-top stuffing with chicken and gravy becomes Thanksgiving.  Anything goes in instant mashed potatoes.   And occasionally, I’ll buy freeze dried dinners more for the variety than the taste.  I often carry something like fried chicken or a sub sandwich out of the town for a first night feast.  It all depends upon my mood.  I seldom eat dessert at home, but on the trail, I welcome a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie and a square of dark chocolate.  
I have tried going without a stove, but I find that I eat even less.  I hiked with a thru-hiker in Virginia in 1997 who left town with a four pound tub of peanut better, a spoon, Hostess Fruit Pies for breakfast, and Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies.  He thrived on this diet.   It helped that he was born lacking senses of taste and smell.   I carry a small stove that screws onto an isopropane/butane canister.  It’s convenient, easy-to-use, and finding canisters (sometimes the larger eight-ounce size) is not difficult.  My stove choice has migrated from the MSR Whisperlite white gas stove in the 1990’s to Esbit tablets to umpteen alcohol stoves before settling on a canister stove for the utter simplicity.  I use a Gossamer Gear Warm Sak as a pot cozy to reduce my use of fuel, and it serves as a stuff sack for my cook set.  For my kind of cooking, a 0.9 liter pot and a long-handled spoon suffice.  Those who only boil water for rehydration or freeze-dried dinners can get away with less.   
I dream of food at night and fantasize about stumbling into trail magic at the next road crossing or being asked to join picnickers.  It rarely happens, but towns are a near certainty every three to five days.  Most hikers gravitate toward pizza and beer, but my first desire is usually salad.  I try to get into town by noon so I’m assured at least three meals before I leave.  If there is an all-you-can-eat restaurant, that’s where you’ll find me in the evening.  If I take a zero (non-hiking) day there, I seek out fine dining the second day, emphasizing quality over quantity.  I find that my body craves a zero day every 10 to 14 days, and I try not to deny it.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646712,"I realized after posting the last entry that I had forgotten a food I eat almost daily on the trail, energy bars.  I usually buy my favorite brand, Luna, and have often regretted not finding it and substituting a lesser bar.  In thinking about it, however, I started to wonder if it were barely possible that I could be stuck in a rut, like with Green SuperFeet, when for years Trailblazer Comfort SuperFeet had been hiding in plain sight?  So I bought seven energy bars at the grocery store, limiting myself to bars that were sold singly.  


If you’ve read my previous journals, you know that I like to create comparison spreadsheets, listing attributes across the top and alternatives down the side.  I weight the various attributes by importance to me by assigning a maximum score for each attribute, and then proceed to fill in the matrix based on my experience or research.  My judgments are admittedly arbitrary and capricious, some might say mercurial.  I then sum the scores for each row, calculate it as a percentage of the maximum score, and assign it a letter grade.  Somehow, that makes it seem objective.  I did this with trail towns in 2018, identifying 17 attributes important to me, including proximity to the trail, lodging options, and having a grocery store (all 3-pointers),  a medical clinic and barber shop (2-pointers), and more esoteric features like an historical society or museum and an Episcopal Church (worth 1 point each).  My A-graded towns were Franklin, NC; Damascus, VA; Waynesboro, VA; Manchester Center, VT, and in a surprise to me, Gatlinburg, TN.  Another surprise to me was Marion, VA, earning a B+.  I’ve never considered going into either of these towns as a hiker, but now I’ll consider both. If you are curious, Port Clinton, PA was in the deepest, dankest corner of the cellar, earring a failing score of 31%.  


You may recall from Genesis that God was prepared to utterly destroy Sodom but that Abraham argued with God, suggesting that if there were fifty righteous people in Sodom, then God should withhold his wrath.  God agreed, and Abraham kept lowering the righteous target until he reached ten.  With the advantage of omniscience, God knew that it wouldn’t matter if the number were two, but it was a nice gesture.  Perhaps I should spare Port Clinton my judgement, if I can find one positive thing to say about it.  I’ve got it!  The hand cut French Fries at the Port Clinton Hotel are that good.  So for the sake of the French Fries and the fact that Port Clinton straddles the trail and so is unavoidable, I will visit it once again, probably in the first week of May. Returning to energy bars …


Don’t worry, I’m not going to construct a comparison matrix for energy bars.  There would be no point in it because my weighting of a single attribute would overwhelm all of the others.  That of course, is taste!  When Alice B. Toklas published her cookbook in 1954, some critics pounced on her for including so many unhealthy recipes.  I had always heard that she retorted, “Give me flavor, not nutrition!”  I can’t find any reference for that, so I’m left with the quote in the upper left corner of this page.  Alice’s cookbook is remarkable not only for her recipes but also as a memoir of Alice and the countless wives and companions she entertained while Gertrude Stein held salon with their genius husbands.  Alice had no need to write a complete autobiography, because Gertrude did that for her in 1933.  In fact, Gertrude single-handedly destroyed the genre in 1937 by writing everything that ever needed to be written about anyone in her Everybody’s Autobiography.


So flavor is everything when it comes to my choice of energy bars.  Even if a bar is chockfull of nutrients and dense with calories, still I won’t eat it unless it tastes good.  It will remain in the bottom of my bear canister until I find a home for it in a hiker box.  My term for trail food that is good for me but I won’t eat it unless facing imminent starvation is pack ballast.  It only serves to weigh me down.  Following the advice of Colin Fletcher in The Complete Walker, I carried pemmican bars on my first AT hike in 1994.  Taste is highly individualistic.  Perhaps you like this combination of dried meat, melted fat, and dried fruit more than I did.  I include in on my very short list of foods I loathe, along with meat loaf (no, not even your granny’s), Jell-O, most organ meats, and Brussel sprouts (not even if roasted with Balsamic vinegar and buried beneath mounds of bacon). 


In spite of the fact that the only relevant review of my seven energy bars is, “Ooh, aah, I like this one but not that one,” I will identify attributes that serve as strata for supporting my ultimately subjective response, starting with the obverse of the packaging that led me to select it and then the reverse for nutritional information and even a calculation of calories per dollar and calories per ounce.  Only then will I open the packages and slice off a piece of each and nibble away. I thought about making this a blind taste test, but I think I would recognize each bar anyway.  


Packaging - Unique Selling Point



Clif Bar Blueberry Crisp - An attractive blue wrapping promising “nutrition for sustained energy,” featuring a cartoon rock climber, to convey that by eating this bar, I too could suspend myself from an overhanging ledge by my fingertips.  It’s organic and GMO-free, as a bonus.
Kind Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew - This is the only bar to feature transparent packaging.  The three named ingredients are easily visible, and by eating it, you will “do the kind thing for your body, your taste buds & your world.”  Gluten- and GMO-free.
Larabar Lemon Bar - This bright yellow and red package screams high energy and features “just 6 real ingredients.”  As opposed to what, pretend ingredients?  It has no artificial sweeteners, is plant based, gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan. 
Luna LemonZest is also yellow with a palate-teasing photo of a cut lemon and curled zest. It’s “the first nutrition bar for women” and encourages me to “Life the life you love. Love the life you live.”  It’s gluten- and GMO-free.
NuGo Dark Chocolate Coconut is wrapped in various shades of brown with a photo of a split coconut and hunks of dark chocolate.  It proudly proclaims 10 grams of protein and is gluten-, GMO-, palm oil-free as well as vegan.  
ONE Almond Bliss is in a glossy white wrapping with cheerful green letters with a split coconut and what would be gigantic almonds if they were in scale to the coconut.  It sold me with its slogan, “Indulgence is bliss” and 20 grams of protein.  It’s gluten-free.
Quest Blueberry Muffin has suitably blue packaging with a photo of a luscious muffin noted as “For Illustration Only,” and 21 grams of protein.  



Nutrition


Total calories range from 170 (Kind) to 240 (ONE).  Protein ranges from 4 grams (Kind and Larabar) to 21 grams (Quest).  Looking at vitamins and minerals over 5% of Daily Value, Cliff dominates with 11 entries.  Luna is second with 4.  The cost ranges from $1.25 for Clif and Luna to $2.49 and $2.59 for the two high protein bars, ONE and Quest, respectively.  In terms of calories per ounce, there isn’t much difference with a range of 90 to 125.  Expressed as calories per dollar, Clif takes the cake at 200, with Luna following at 152 and the high protein bars lagging at 98 and 73.  


The reality is that I do not depend on any one food source for my trail nutrition.  My trail diet and town binges are highly variable and probably cover the nutritional bases.  If anything, my trail diet tends to be low on fat, which I try to augment by adding a splash of olive oil to my dinners.    The most common vitamins and minerals in the various bars are calcium and iron.  Clif alone has various B-vitamins, ranging from 10-25% of the Daily Value.   


Taste and Flavor


I’ve thought far too long and too hard over how to rate energy bars and finally came up with the following utterly pragmatic scale.  At the top is Scrumptious, meaning that I would reach for the bar even if a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie and a Midnight Milky Way were sitting beside it.  Next is Edible, meaning that after sating myself with preferred snacks, I would willingly eat it.  The rest are consigned to Pack Ballast, and I would not buy then again, regardless of package design and nutrition.  



Clif Bar Blueberry Crisp - EDIBLE

I am not much of a dessert eater unless I’m in a trail town on a long hike, but when I have to make a dessert, It’s usually a crisp of some sort because I’m not good at pastry.  A crisp is easy - sweetened, thickened fruit with a crunchy streusel topping, often with oats.  This energy bar is more like a chewy granola bar with dried blueberries.  In spite of the misleading name, it’s tasty and more than edible but less than scrumptious.  It is the most nutritionally balanced of the bars I selected, so that’s a plus.  



Kind Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew - PACK BALLAST

It took three small pieces to confirm my judgment.  This reminds me of a glass of cheap California Cabernet Sauvignon with the flavors coming in sequence but never melding into a satisfying whole.  First comes the crispness of the cashew, followed by the bitterness of the dark chocolate and finally a cherry aftertaste that lingers like a cough drop, all imbedded in grainy fudge.  Sorry guys!



Larabar Lemon Bar — PACK BALLAST

The “6 Real Ingredients” are dates, almonds, cashews, lemon juice concentrate, lemon juice solids, and lemon oil.  The stickiness of the dates holds the other ingredients into a gooey unappealing brown bar.  The nuts are there, like the plastic baby in a King Cake, but not well integrated.  The lemon oil lingers on the tongue as do the sticky dates on the fingers.  This is the second flavor of Larabar that I’ve tried and will be the last.



Luna LemonZest — SCRUMPTOUS

Ummmm!  In addition to the lemon, I’ve enjoyed the Blueberry Bliss, Chocolate Dipped Coconut, Nuts Over Chocolate, and Chocolate Peppermint Stick. All border on ORGASMIC and make me very happy.  I often carry one on my morning walks and enjoy it at my turning point.  The Chocolate Peppermint Stick, when partially frozen as it is by then, is particularly refreshing.  The LemonZest is iced on the bottom with an intense lemon flavor that explodes upon hitting my tongue. The rest of the bar is crunchy yet moist, reminding me of a fresh Rice Krispies Treat without the gooeyness of marshmallow.  Luna Bars are marketed toward women, but what can I say?  Go Girl!



NuGo Dark Chocolate Coconut — SCRUMPTOUS

Okay, I’m surprised!  The entire bar is enrobed in about 3/32” of a really nice dark chocolate that seems free of the paraffin often added for gloss and to resist melting. This rice-based bar is light, containing identifiable coconut and almonds.  It is lacking much in the way of nutrition other than 10 grams of protein and 200 calories, but more than makes up for it with flavor.  



ONE Almond Bliss — PACK BALLAST

I didn’t finish my sample bite, but did take a second nibble to confirm my first.  This is a very attractive bar, reminding me of an Almond Joy, dipped in chocolate with three embedded almonds.  The chocolate is flavorless, even when picked off and eaten in isolation.  This bar gains its 20 grams of protein from a combination of milk and soy extracts that left me pursing my lips and trying to scrape my tongue on my teeth.  I would feel guilty putting this in a hiker box, and it’s the one bar that I won’t be finishing on my walks.  I hesitate adding it to the compost. 



Quest Blueberry Muffin — PACK BALLAST

This bar is dipped in something.  I don’t know what, but it is orange-brown in color and flavorless but must be needed to hold the gooey, chewy protein mixture and microchips of dried blueberry together.  I’ll save the rest of this bar for a very long walk when my hunger will swamp my taste buds.


Conclusion
Luna Bars remain my all-time favorite, but NuGo which was new to me comes in at a very close second, followed by Clif Bars.  I will definitely explore the other flavors of NuGo stocked at my grocery store:  Dark Chocolate Pretzel with Sea Salt and Dark Mint Chocolate Chip.  The other energy bars that I sampled are all worth remembering, just so that I can avoid them in the future.  


Your tastes may be very different than mine, but I would encourage you to sample whatever foods you plan to bring on your hike before making a major commitment.  Food is not only energy and nutrition; it should be pleasure.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Thu",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646763,"We don’t watch much current TV.  It’s usually on, set to the classical music channel, with the picture off.  I watch an occasional Chopped episode on the Food Network, and we are getting hooked on the new HBO series, The Gilded Age, that we record and watch at 4:00 on Fridays, gin & tonic time.  Tom enjoys some of the old BritComs.  And we watch Andy of Mayberry from the 1960's and Newhart, set in Vermont, from the 1980’s.  Our movie watching is pretty much limited to film noir and cheap 1950’s and 1960’s horror films, like Them!   I also record and watch NOVA, although I often snooze through part of it.  When I really want a nap, I watch Nature, especially the episodes narrated by David Attenborough.  Something about his voice has me out in minutes.  Also, anything to do with the English Royal Family or World War II guarantees a snooze.  Note the omission of sports of any variety, including The Olympics.  The last broadcast series that I recall us watching religiously was Seinfeld in the 1990’s.   I thought the writing, primarily by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, was brilliant, usually weaving three unrelated and trivial storylines together in a tapestry of laughs.  They proudly portrayed it “a show about nothing.”
I tried to answer the question of why I want to thru-hike in my second entry, before Christmas.  I didn’t succeed, although I did explain why I prefer writing a journal to photography or videos.  Why do others thru-hike?  I’ve looked at many of a my fellow Class of 2022 thru-hikers’ trail journals hoping for clarification.  There were some specific goals falling into categories like Rite of Passage or Transition, Physical Challenge and Conditioning, and Being One with Nature.  One couple is hiking as a fundraiser for a disease that impacts them personally.  For the most part, the reasons are vague, like something I’ve always done, something I feel like I have to do, or checking off a bucket list item, and in one case, literally healing a broken heart. One even lists 38 reasons, which is another way of saying that he doesn’t have a single reason.  I’ve Googled “Why do people thru-hike the Appalachian Trail?” and found many inspiring hits that really come down to “because it’s there.”  So maybe my vagueness is not unusual.  I’ve decided to embrace it and to proclaim my thru-hike to be a hike about nothing.  Look at my last entry — 2,200 words about energy bars!  
Shortly after graduating college in the early 1970’s and repaying my student loans, I tested a religious vocation at Holy Cross Monastery, an Episcopal order headquartered in West Park, New York, about 38 miles north of where the Appalachian Trail crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge.  Holy Cross sits above the river, directly across from the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Hyde Park. The Monastery’s property backs up to Black Creek which leads to the John Burroughs Nature Sanctuary and the Black Creek State Forest.  I would often hike there on Sunday afternoons, our free time during the week, but sometimes I would hang out by the swimming pool at the house next to the Order’s driveway on Highway 9W.  One of my fellow postulants at Holy Cross was from a patrician family going back to Nieuw Amsterdam days.  I’ll call him Dutch to respect his privacy. Dutch introduced me to the two gentlemen who owned the house, both teachers, who also had an adjacent small antique store open on the weekends and during summer.  It was the first time I had ever met a long-term gay male couple and saw that such a thing was possible.  How could I have been so naive, you might be wondering?  Remember that it wasn’t until 1973 that the American Psychiatric Association passed a resolution stating that homosexuality was not a mental illness or sickness.  Gay people were either closeted and invisible, confined to certain artsy occupations, or otherwise marginalized.  There certainly were not any positive role models on TV.  Gay liberation was just beginning and marriage equity and equality were not taken seriously.  Fast forward about 25 years in Sarasota, Florida.  I went out to the lobby of my office to meet a prospective client, referred by an existing client.  A true OMG moment, when I recognized him as one of the two teachers!  His partner had died and he had retired to Florida.  He has since married a Texas cowboy, but that’s another story.  Dutch also kept a credit card, a no-no, and we would sometimes escape over the wall and walk down to a small Italian restaurant at the bottom of the hill for Champagne and shrimp cocktails, an activity that just might call our religious vocations into question.  I was the only one of my postulant class of six invited to enter the novitiate, but I left.  You may be asking, and probably should be asking, why I’m sharing this story.  Why indeed?  Because it serves to illustrate the way life happens.  Life isn’t the grand unrolling of an oriental rug with colors and patterns predetermined.  It’s a series of coincidences.  If Dutch hadn’t been my classmate and befriended me, I might have callouses on my knees today from prayer instead of on my toes from walking.  I could offer you one or a dozen reasons why I want to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, but they would all be fiction, not that there’s anything wrong with that.  I’ll be doing it because I’ll be doing it and that is quite enough.  The trail will lead me to Maine and to Georgia, but where else?  I have no idea and I look forward to being surprised by many twists and turns along the way.
While I can’t tell you why I’ll be thru-hiking, I can tell you how I plan to hike.  I don’t mean flip-flopping or hiking three dozen miles a day or whether I’ll be stoveless or arrange for catered dinners at road crossings.  I mean more my mental attitude toward the daily hike.  In early November, we had a rare warm and sunny day.  Coming home from getting a haircut, enjoying the luxury of wearing shirt sleeves without even a jacket, I saw a friend sitting on a bench in City Hall Park.  Patrick (not his real name) is 95 years old and until recently a regular at the Y.  He shared with me what he called his four “benchmarks” for a happy life:  Acceptance, Forgiveness, Thankfulness, and Love.  I hope to practice these during my thru-hike.  Acceptance means not complaining about endless days of rain, the mud and rocks, and even clouds of black flies and mosquitoes.  Bitching doesn’t change anything and only makes me feel worse.  Forgiveness extends not only to the trail gods who soak me with rain and to the trail clubs who route the trail in less than optimal fashion but to my fellow hikers who may occasionally violate Leave-No-Trace principles or otherwise piss me off and especially to myself for my unceasing stupidity.  Thankfulness meaning finding something each day to be grateful for, something I find much easier than acceptance and forgiveness.  Love is the power that binds us altogether and with the Universe and makes the other three benchmarks possible.   Patrick tried thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail many umpteen years ago and confesses that he was never so happy as when he suffered an injury and had no choice but to come home.  Patrick is not a religious person but I wouldn’t call him an atheist, because he does not place himself in opposition to God, the very issue of belief or unbelief simply not registering with him. HIs four benchmarks strike me as superbly rational and humanist and quite compatible with a hike about nothing.  The characters on Seinfeld were largely amoral and the nothingness that dominated the plots was important only to the extent that they were personally affected.  I’ll be looking for meaning in the trivialities of the trail and I hope I can do so without falling into the fallacy of composition, that what is true of the parts is also true of the whole and arguing from the specific to the general.  For me, it’s not the hike; it’s the stories.  I’m glad that you’ll be joining me and maybe when I’ve finished you can tell me why I did it.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646861,"I have learned a new word, erratum, for the correction of errors in printing or writing.  The plural is errata but that is not as much fun to say.  
Paul from New Jersey kindly pointed out that Port Jervis is in New York and not in New Jersey.  My most sincere apologies.  It is located at the junction of three states, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. and calls itself the Gateway to the Upper Delaware River.  It is served by New Jersey Transit with connecting service to Penn Station in Manhattan taking about 2-1/2 hours.  If I’m on my slow schedule on this hike, I’ll use it to get home for a visit in late May.  
I would like to confirm my opinions of the various energy bars I reviewed earlier.  I had about 3/4 of each bar left after my taste test and brought one daily on my morning walks.  The Luna Bar, NuGo Bar and Clif Bar were joyful companions.  Even though Tom had bought a box of individually wrapped Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies, I chose to carry the energy bars.  I love Little Debbies as trail snacks, but not so much at home.   I carried the Kind Bar on my walk Thursday but couldn’t bring myself to eat it until I got home.  The cherry cough drop aftertaste persisted for about an hour.  Actually, it reminded me of the flavored Achromycin liquid I would occasionally be given as a kid, not a pleasant association.   Now I’m facing the remnants of the Quest Blueberry Muffin and the Larabar Lemon.  I can’t bring myself to eat either, but I hate to waste them.  I just took another little nibble of each and now I feel justified in adding them to the compost.  Egads!  Don’t manufacturers taste their products?  I was in City Market, our local Co-Op grocery the other day buying veggies.  It’s kind like a Vermont funky Whole Foods featuring lots of local and organic products.  I couldn’t resist buying a Maple Pecan O.W.L (Original. Wholesome. Local.) Energy Bar made in Brattleboro, Vermont.  I didn’t walk far enough Friday to deserve a snack so my review will have to wait until next week.  The temperature rose into the mid-30’s Thursday, meaning that some of the snow melted.  It froze overnight, leaving the sidewalks coated with black ice and the bike path dotted with ice and frozen snow.  Even using my carbide-tipped hiking sticks, it was too dangerous and I turned back after a couple of miles.  
I sent my new clothing items off to InsectShield for permethrin treatment earlier this week and expect them back by the end of the month, so one more item is checked off my to-do list.  
There’s a persistent thread on WhiteBlaze.net on car care during a thru-hike.  It reminds me that most thru-hikers are young and aren’t leaving a spouse or partner at home and quite possibly won’t have a home to come back to as they are between and betwixt.  Finding someone to run a car occasionally to keep the battery charged and the tires round is important to them.  I’m glad not to have to worry about that, but I do have to worry about the spouse I’m leaving at home.  Tom’s quite capable of charging his own battery and keeping himself in true, but I know that he gets lonely and misses me.  I know I’ll be missing him, but it’s tougher to be the one left at home.  Cell phones have made keeping in touch easier but it is also a daily reminder of the loss.  In some ways, I liked it better back in the days of pay phones!  At least I’ll be here for Valentine’s Day tomorrow and for Easter, both chocolate feast days of obligation. I’ll miss Tom’s birthday in June, but I’ll leave a card and present hidden somewhere and won’t tell him where until the day before.  I could leave them in plain sight and it wouldn’t matter, because it is inconceivable that he would peek.  if I hike on at least my moderate schedule, I’ll be with Tom for our anniversary in August.  He may meet me in Baxter State Park, but he won’t be climbing Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646891,"Now that it’s coming up on two months before I leave for the start of my thru-hike, friends are starting to believe that I’ll actually be doing this and are asking different kinds of questions, focusing much more on the practical.  Up until now, it’s been mostly the why question:  Why are you doing this?  You know I don’t have an answer, but any answer will do for most people, so I usually blather about feeling at home in the woods and my previous attempts only making me more desperate to succeed this time.  Vermonters are very outdoorsy — 78% of the land is forested — and comfortable in the woods.  So instead of vague questions about what I’ll eat and where I’ll sleep, there are specific questions about which stove I use and which tent I carry or have I tried a hammock (yes, but I didn’t like it).  People who know me well and my tendency to drift off into daydreams ask how I’ll avoid getting lost.  I’m not sure if they mean physically lost or fear that I’ll wander into some space from which there is no return, my own private universe of dementia.  The very act of worrying about it reassures me that I haven’t taken residence in dementia yet.  I  take great solace in scientific papers that find a relationship between a lessening in the complexity of sentence structure in people later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.  The papers have such wonderfully juicy titles, like Longitudinal detection of dementia through lexical and syntactic changes in writing: a case study of three British novelists and Dementia and grammar in a polysynthetic language: an Arapaho case study.  The latter has a first sentence worthy a Bulwer-Lytton Prize — “In dementia in inflecting and agglutinating languages, morphosyntax is much better preserved than lexical access or pragmatics, but little is known about how dementia affects language in polysynthetic agglutinating languages with their complex verb morphology.” — except that the contest is tongue-in-cheek and this sentence is serious academic twaddle. 
Are you familiar with the annual contest inspired by Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton’s 1830 novel that begins with the sentence being typed by Snoopy?  Here’s the 2021 Grand Prize winning sentence:  ""A lecherous sunrise flaunted itself over a flatulent sea, ripping the obsidian bodice of night asunder with its rapacious fingers of gold, thus exposing her dusky bosom to the dawn’s ogling stare.”  Congratulations to Stu Duval of Auckland, New Zealand!  You can read all of the 2021 winners at https://www.bulwer-lytton.com.  Or you could subscribe to Language, the journal of the linguistic Society of America.
If decreasing complexity in writing is a sign of future dementia, I feel relatively safe.  In fact, a touch of Alzheimers might make my writing more comprehensible.  But there is no touch, only early stage with the inevitable progression.  I don’t think my friends are seriously worried about my wandering into a mental wilderness so much as simply wandering into trackless woods because I got sidetracked in my thinking and forget to follow the blazes.  
The surest way to be found is to avoid being lost, and the surest way to avoid being lost is to hike mindfully, by which I mean being aware of the trail, the way it lies upon the ground, the overall topography and in particular the blazes.  I can do that for short periods, but unless the trail is challenging, my mind drifts off and my feet go on auto-pilot.  
For those of you who don’t know, blazes are 2-inch wide, 6-inch high white rectangles usually painted on tree trunks at eye level or higher.  They can be artful constructions, starting by carefully limning the outline with a box cutter, removing any loose bark with a paint scraper, masking off the surrounding bark, and applying the paint in smooth, steady strokes, with nary a drip.  Or they can be a splotch of white paint loosely resembling a rectangle.  They widen as the tree grows and unless regularly maintained eventually resemble a 6-inch square, which is how boundaries are marked on Pennsylvania game lands.  If there are no trees, the blaze may be applied to rocks, wooden posts, or even plastic slats.  Above tree line, little rock pyramids called cairns substitute for blazes.  In the White Mountains of New Hampshire, blazes painted on cairns may be yellow, making them easier to spot in the snow but very confusing to AT hikers imprinted on white.  Occasionally, you will find blazes painted on paper birch trees, like a white-on-white minimalist painting, creating an opportunity for you to practice forgiveness.  
On the Appalachian Trail, blazes are most often rectangular and white, but other trails use other colors, and rather than paint, trails may be marked with colored plastic circles, squares or other pleasing shapes nailed to trees.  Side trails on the Appalachian Trail are usually blazed in blue.  Occasionally blue-blazed trails may be bad-weather bypass trails that reconnect to the AT but most often lead to water sources, overlooks or shelters.  You will frequently see double blazes, one atop the other, intended to alert the hiker to something unexpected, like a change in direction.  Some trail maintaining clubs offset the upper blaze in the direction of the turn, but in spite of interminable well-intended meetings, a uniform blazing policy has yet to evolve.  I personally sat through a day-and-a-half long, very long, meeting on double blazes with heated passions raging on all sides, a frank exchange in diplomacy-speak.  
You might think of blazes as route markers, as I did for many years, but the current terminology is reassurance markers or sometimes confidence or confirming markers to indicate that you are  on your intended trail.  When I started hiking the AT, the standard seemed to be that when you were standing at one blaze, you should be able to see the next blaze.  That thinking is now viewed as passé.  The current fashion is to paint a blaze  only where necessary, for example at trail intersections and road crossings, to prevent hikers from wandering in circles, until weak with hunger, they collapse and the vultures descend.  Often there will be pairs of blazes, one before the intersecting trail and one perhaps fifty feet on the other side, to reassure you that, yes, you made the right decision.  Minimal blazing by design is especially practiced in federally-designated wilderness areas, like much of the Georgia AT where most thru-hikers start.
Wooden signs nailed to trees or wooden posts are commonly used to mark shelter side trails or upcoming roads.  If the local maintaining club chapter has a talented wood worker who received a router for Christmas, the signs may be quite elaborate.  They often include distances to the noted features, which while well-intended are frequently incorrect.  In Shenandoah National Park, concrete posts with inset embossed metal bands serve this function, some so worn with age so that you would need to resort to graphite rubbing to discern the message.  
The whole point is that while nice, reassurance blazes and signs should not be your primary navigation method.  Map and compass is the traditional method.  Thirty-six maps cover the Appalachian Trail, costing about $385.  Or you can do what most hikers do and purchase the FarOut app for either iPhone or Android for $59.95.  Check it out at https://faroutguides.com/.  It uses the GPS function of your cell phone, meaning that your phone can be kept in airplane mode, greatly extending battery life.  It includes both map and elevation views, services in nearby towns, current comments from other users, and the ability to check-in with family and friends.  It places you accurately within feet on the AT and shows shelters, water sources, viewpoints and other features.  Tapping one of the features shows the trail distance to it.  The cursor is a directional arrow, so it is hard to hike in the wrong direction.  It probably isn’t necessary but I also carry a comprehensive guidebook, the most popular ones being the AT Guide and The  Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers’ Companion, for their additional trail town and shelter information.  The Companion also includes trail history and lore that used to be common knowledge but is sadly fading away.  I prefer the Companion because I find that the Guide has too much information in a small space for my old eyes to manage.  I carry a PDF of the Companion on my cell phone.  I can’t imagine returning to maps and compass, but i still carry a compass in case my phone fails and I find myself off trail.  I can at least walk in a straight line with a compass.  
If you are like me, you will occasionally be hiking along and be hit with the realization that it’s been some time since you’ve seen a blaze because you’ve been inattentive.  What do I do?  First I squint and look ahead in hopes of seeing a white blaze.  Failing that, I look behind me to see if there’s a blaze for people hiking the opposite direction.  If I don’t see a blaze and the trail seems like it ought to be the AT, I’ll continue but just for five or ten minutes.  Usually a blaze materializes and I can return to my daydream.  If not, I bring out my phone, activate FarOut, and on the map view, press the GPS button to locate myself in relation to the AT and backtrack to where I screwed up.  It really isn’t a problem.
Some hikers also carry a satellite messenger like the new Garmin InReach Mini 2, weighing 3.5 ounces.  This new version features TracBack®, which will retrace your steps if you find yourself lost!  It is probably the ultimate in on-trail safety, including interactive SOS signaling and check-ins with family and friends back home.  Its battery is amazingly long-lasting.  If I were hiking a more remote trail than the AT or hiking out of season, I would seriously consider carrying it.  
I kind of miss the days before cell phones and GPS and especially before the AT became so popular, back when it was possible to get lost or to hike in the wrong direction for hours at a time.  It made it more of an adventure, especially when you realized that you have everything you need on your back and you are there because you wanted to be in the woods.  In Central Virginia, the AT crosses and recrosses the Blue Ridge Parkway many times.  I hiked that section in October one year and most of it was in dense fog, with visibility down to 10-12 feet.  The Blue Ridge Parkway was closed and I couldn’t see across it to see where the AT reentered the woods.  Today, it would not be an issue.  I would bring up FarOut and quickly see that the trail continued directly across or took a dogleg left or right.  Without the app, I scuffed a mark on the pavement, went directly across and placed another scuff, and then explored left and right until I found the trail.  It was one of my favorite hikes.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646955,"I wasn’t able to walk very far on Monday or Tuesday before I hit sheet ice on the lakefront bike path.  Even with high-traction boots and carbide-tipped hiking poles, it was just too dangerous.   Next year, I’ll explore traction devices, but the ice isn’t thick enough for my MicroSpikes.  They would be ruined in no time.  Falling and breaking something now would end my hike before I even start.  I didn’t try walking Wednesday, but Thursday was lovely.  I carried my sticks and used them in only a few places.  For most of my walk, I was able to go at my preferred pace and stride length.  It’s been a while since I could do that, and It felt so good!  I just wish that I had worn my hiking shoes instead of heavy boots. It didn’t feel quite as good when I turned around and had to walk home into a 20 MPH headwind.  I ended up walking a bit over 10 miles, far enough that I felt justified in eating the Maple Pecan O.W.L. Energy Bar.
It’s heavy at 2.6 ounces with 323 gluten-free calories.  Only fat (17 grams), fiber (5 grams) and protein (9 grams) exceed 5% of Daily Value.  It’s expensive at $3.39.  My first nibble was tentative, my second less so, and then it was gone.  It taste like fruit cake ought to taste, dense as a doorstop, but in terms of flavor, it’s as far from Claxton Fruit Cake as Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame Champagne is from club soda.  It’s what Geraldine Page must have baked in Truman Capote’s A Christmas Memory (1969).  It is more than edible but not quite scrumptious on its own.  Taking a “page” from A Christmas Memory, it could be made miraculous.  Wrap it in several layers of cheesecloth and brush or spray it with moonshine whiskey, preferably Mr. Haha’s if you can find it.  It is some kind of good and will be joining the Luna Lemonzest, NuGo Dark Chocolate and Coconut, and Clif Blueberry Crisp at the start of my hike for my mid-afternoon snacks.  
A friend and neighbor has loaned me The Book of Joy, by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Demond Tutu with Douglas Abrams, published in 2016, because I mentioned having gotten to know Desmond Tutu back in the early 1970’s, before he was consecrated bishop, when he was on retreat at Holy Cross Monastery.  I can’t remember a thing he said, but I can still see into his eyes and feel his hands on either side of my face as he pressed his forehead to mine.  Mostly I can hear his laughter!  Innocent, mirthful, full-throated but never ribald.  He was amused by everything, and as is apparent in this book, so is the Dalai Lama.  I usually avoid the self-help/spiritual genre in non-fiction books.  It’s not that I’ve achieved perfection, self-actualization, or enlightenment, but I find greater benefit in my own prayer and meditation discipline than in reading about those of others.  Nonetheless, I’m finding the book to be pleasant because of the characters of these two men, both of whom emerged from decades of struggle and strife with joy intact.  You’ll recognize their eight pillars of joy as not all that different from my friend Patrick’s four benchmarks for happiness that I discussed a couple of entries ago.  They are Perspective, Humility, Humor, Acceptance, Forgiveness, Gratitude, Compassion, and Generosity.  They provide a perfect jumping off point for a discussion of trail etiquette, which is what I want to write about this morning.   
When I hike the Appalachian Trail, I don’t feel like just a hiker.  While I have done very little trail maintenance other than a day spent removing invasive plants and bootleg fire rings in Connecticut, assisting an Old Dominion Appalachian Trail Club volunteer in digging out a privy at Paul C. Wolfe Shelter in Central Virginia, and clearing water bars in Georgia, my involvement with ATC exposed me to a wide range of trail maintenance issues.  I cringe when I see unburnable food pouches and foil in fire pits, food and gear left in shelters by well-intentioned hikers (save it for a hiker box in town), litter on the trail, and unburied poop and toilet paper.   I feel sadness when I see living trees, trail signs and shelters defaced with graffiti and a twinge of guilt when I’m tempted to cut a switchback or to widen a path to avoid getting my shoes wet and muddy.  Think like a volunteer trail maintainer or a ridge runner and don’t make their jobs any more difficult!  
I am embarrassed by thru-hikers trying to claim rank over section or day hikers, getting upset that the Appalachian Mountain Club Huts in the White Mountains of New Hampshire cater to guests paying $139 per night (member rate) or that hikers with reservations have priority for bunks in shelters in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, or expressing disappointment not to find a hiker feed or trail magic at each road crossing.  Thru-hikers make more intensive use of trail resources than any other group.  A good dollop of humility and gratitude would not be misplaced.  Rightly, we are the untouchable Dalit caste of trail users and should not be surprised when motorists and townspeople gag at our stench.  A bit of soap and changing into a cleaner shirt before hitching into town would not be a gross imposition on thru-hikers.  The magic words of please and thank you should fall from our lips!
On the trail itself, hikers coming uphill have the right of way, but in practice, uphill hikers are all too willing to take a break and allow you to pass.  Take a moment to greet them, assure them that the summit is not too far, and that the shelter is just over the next ridge.  Try not to lie, although it is so tempting to see the happiness on their faces in thinking that they are almost there.   If you come upon a hiker who is struggling offer help or commiserate with them that it really is hard.  In Maine I saw a hiker ahead standing off the trail who appeared to be having some difficulty.  From behind, I asked if he needed a hand.  He turned and I saw that he was trying to zip up his fly with two prosthetic hook hands.  Oops. We shared a good laugh.  
It is at trail shelters where etiquette comes into strongest play.  It’s all common sense and golden rule stuff, but especially after a difficult day’s hike, it’s easy to forget and react without reflection.  Trail shelters were not built for thru-hikers but for anyone who cares to use them.  They were first constructed to offer hikers an alternative to carrying a 10-pound canvas tent but have become a popular part of hiker culture.  Are they needed today when single-person tents weighing only one pound are available?  It’s questionable, but it’s unlikely that shelters will be removed in the foreseeable future.  Well-sited and well-maintained, shelters concentrate overnight use and minimize the impact to the environment.  
My personal preference is to tent near a shelter site, since shelters usually have water sources (requiring treatment), privies, and increasingly, safe food storage.  As a solo hiker, I enjoy the chance to socialize.  Why do I prefer to tent, even if the shelter is mouse-free and uncrowded?  I sleep better in my own space, the ground being softer than a wooden shelter floor.  I’m an early riser and like to be hiking at first light without awakening a shelter full of hikers.  There’s often a fire pit in front of the shelter, and for reasons which are unfathomable to me, many hikers associate being outdoors with making a fire.  Tenting allows me to escape the smoke and the smell.  
Shelters are first-come, first-serve, and especially in the rain, can get very crowded.  Is it permissible to save a spot for a friend?  Debatable, but better to offer your spot to your friend and set up your tent if the shelter is full.  Needless to say, dogs, especially wet dogs, do not belong in shelters unless everyone agrees.  Smokers should ask before lighting up in a shelter, and no one should hesitate to object.  
There’s often a picnic table at a shelter to encourage hikers not to cook inside the shelter.  Especially if it’s raining and the shelter lacks an extended overhanging roof, cooking inside the shelter happens.  Food inevitably spills, rewarding the mice who live in many of the shelters.  Try to confine your gear to a swatch not much wider than your sleeping pad so that late arrivals don’t have to ask you to move your stuff.  There are hikers who habitually sleep into the morning and hike into the night, arriving after 9PM (known as hiker midnight), set up their gear in the shelter and proceed to cook their dinner.  Even using red head lamps and speaking in whispers, it awakens everyone.  Sometimes it is well-intended section hikers who are late coming in because they were over-ambitious in their planning.  Try to be generous and point out the water source and privy so they don’t wander through the woods making even more noise.  It’s another good reason to tent.  
It’s natural for hikers to coalesce into informal trail families (tramilies), sometimes hiking together but often meeting at an agreed upon shelter at night.  Hikers come and go from the group, depending on speed and sometimes side trips, but at the shelter, the tramily is often perceived of as a clique, like the popular kids in high school, and others can feel excluded.  Be aware of it and try to include others in the conversation.  Some of my most memorable nights have been spent with summer camp and scouting groups.  Young scouts see an old man and sometimes volunteer to fetch my water.  Should I deny them the pleasure of doing a good deed?  Camp groups, in particular, often cook too much food.  Your being there to help with the leftovers is good Leave-No-Trace.  Often there is one kid who feels excluded from the group.  Be a good friend and listen!
Good etiquette obviously includes practicing Leave-No-Trace, which constitute the rules of civilized trail behavior that protect the resource and makes it more pleasant for everyone.  
It’s hard to imagine either the Dalai Lama or the Archbishop having thru-hiked, but in 1959 the Dalai Lama, fearing death, trekked for two weeks from Lhasa across the Himalayas to Tawang in India, to escape the Chinese occupiers of Tibet.  It’s a far more dramatic tale than any AT thru-hike!",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647017,"I seem to spend a great deal of time obsessing about weather, more at home than on the trail.  The weather is what the weather is.  None of my wishing will make the rain go away and come again some other day.  And none of my looking at the Weather Channel and weather.com and cross-checking it against accuweather.com will tell me much more than sticking my head out and seeing what it feels like.  We are affected by multiple weather systems here and forecasts more than three days out are of questionable value.  One of the luxuries of retirement is being able to schedule our own activities and to a large extend avoid going out in miserable weather.   I don’t take my morning walk if it is raining or the windchill is below minus 20.  I try to schedule grocery shopping on a dry day.  On the other hand, neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night will keep me from walking down to the Y, but black ice defeats me every time.  My Montbell Versalite rain suit is well tested, and I actually enjoy walking in it. The biggest decision I face each morning is deciding what to wear for my walk along the lakefront bike path.  This morning was difficult.  It was 21* at 6AM but forecast to be 30* at 8:30, when I usually get home.  I ended up wearing my winter hiking pants that are fleece-lined nylon, a mid-weight long underwear top, and my heavier Western Mountaineering Flight Jacket, insulated mittens and a fleece-lined woolen cap, complete with tassels and pom-pom.  I carried lighter gloves and cap and ended up switching to them at my turning point as well as partially unzipping the jacket.  I was rewarded for going out this morning by meeting a most exuberant retriever just out of puppyhood and her young man and got to assist in teaching her that meeting people on the bike path is a good thing and not something to be feared.  
Deciding what to wear on the trail is so much easier, if for no other reason than my options are so limited.  Hiking shorts?  Check, except on going-into-town days when I wear my cleaner camp and sleep shorts.  Wicking t-shirt?  Check, the gray one except the white one if the flying insects are bad or it’s a town day.  The white one will soon be indistinguishable from the gray one.  Socks?  Check, changing after two or three days, saving a cleaner pair for sleeping and town day.  Forest-green soft A.T. cap?  Check, unless it starts out hot and I prefer a sweatband.  If it is chilly in the morning, I might add ultralight long underwear tops or even bottoms, and if it is downright cold, I’ll add my light puffy and perhaps knit gloves and fleece cap and possibly my Buff as a balaclava.   And if it’s raining, I’ll wear my rain jacket.  If it’s both rainy and cold, the rain pants go on.  The rain suit  is made from Gore-Tex Infinium Windstopper.  It not only keeps me dry without undue perspiration but also is a great wind block.  
I have experienced borderline hypothermia twice.  It is an unpleasant experience and one I hope not to repeat.  What I have learned is the importance of not hesitating to stop and add or subtract a layer of clothing.  It’s all too easy to say, “Oh, it’s only three miles to the shelter.  No point in putting on a rain jacket.”  Or to start the day with rime ice or hoar frost and say, “It will warm up soon.”  
Deciding what clothing to bring is easy for me, because I avoid late fall, winter, and early spring hikes.  The clothing I describe above covers the balance of the year for me.  Many people prefer long or convertible trail pants, and especially if worn tucked into socks, they are an excellent tick deterrence.  I get too hot in them.  They would be nice for travel, but I get by with my black rain pants,  
I have evacuated from the trail when a hurricane, high winds, or flash floods threaten, but I can recall only two instances since I took up this ridiculous sport in 1994 that I have allowed weather to cause me to shelter in place on the trail.  The first was in 1996, just south of Roan Mountain, when Pet Rock and I awoke to a greenish black tornado sky.  During a break in the storm, we packed up our tent and spent the day at Clyde Smith Shelter, along with six others.  The other time was in 1998 at 501 Shelter in Pennsylvania.  I was with the first northbound thru-hiker of the year and we had had rain daily since Pen Mar Park.  We were awakened by a thunderclap and could see vivid lightening and bending pine trees through the shelter’s skylight.  I don’t think either of us even questioned whether we should hike that day.  It just seemed to be a given.  At the time, there were hundreds of old paperback books and magazines in the enclosed shelter, once a potter’s studio, so it was a pleasant day and the caretaker who lived in the adjacent house drove us into Pine Grove for dinner.  My first year, at Plum Orchard Shelter in Georgia, I didn’t like the looks of the sky when I had finished my lunch so I took a nap and awoke to that sick greenish black color.  A family came running in, just in advance of the storm.  That particular shelter is a massive timber-framed structure that was air-lifted onto concrete piers by the U.S. Army Rangers who train nearby and was sited to the north of and below an east-west ridge.  Most tornadoes travel to the northeast, so I felt we were in as safe of a location as possible.  About 2AM, we heard the proverbial freight train and the next morning, trees were down like pick-up sticks.  On one hike of northern Virginia, while I was in the southern district of Shenandoah National Park, there were thunderstorms moving through.  Before I ventured onto the summit of Blackrock, I waited until the storm was well past, or so I thought.  Lightning struck close enough for the hairs on the back of my neck to rise and tingle.  It had to have been a warning shot, since God by definition would have perfect aim, and it’s a warning I’ve heeded since.  
The only weather-related decision I’ll face is which sleeping bag to start with on April 21st.  Both are Western Mountaineering.  The Highlite is rated at 35*.  Wearing long underwear and fleece cap, I’ve been comfortable at 30*, and if necessary could wear my puffy for additional warmth.  The average low in Harpers Ferry, my starting point, is 40* on that date, with the record low being 25*.  The highest campsite in Maryland is about 1,800’, 1,500’ higher than the bridge over the Potomac, so I will subtract 5* from the Harpers Ferry temperatures for planning purposes.  My goal is to be comfortable at the adjusted average low of 35* and survivable at the adjusted record low of 20*.  The Highlite sleeping bag is sufficient, but I will look at the long-range forecast before flying down on April 20, and possibly start with my UltraLite, rated at 20* but comfortable for me at 10*.  Unless 2022 is an unusually warm year, I plan to switch to the warmer sleeping bag at Hanover, New Hampshire.  
There are plenty of hikers who carry less clothing than I do and just a light quilt for warmth at night.  They are fine in about 75 or 80% of the conditions they face and while they may have a miserable night or two, they will be okay.  I personally want better odds and greater comfort, but that’s just me.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647107,"Magic and miracles might mean the same thing to many people.  In theology, magic is often thought of as things done by people, or even demons, that are improbable or seemingly impossible, while miracles are equally wonderful, improbable and impossible, attributed to the divine.  Magic is illusion, dependent on the skill of the magician in using the rules of nature and science to create an effect of their having been violated, like sawing a person in half and having them made whole again with nary a drop of blood, pulling a rabbit out of a hat, or pulling quarter after quarter from an audience member’s ear.    Miracle is in direct contravention of nature, such as having the sun stand still in the sky, a medically impossible healing by divine intervention, perhaps through the intercession of a saint, or the dead rising from the grave.  But a trail journal is not a place to argue theology or to debate how many angels can dance on the carbide tip of a hiking pole.  
On the Appalachian Trail, trail magic has come to mean coming across what you need when you least expect to find it or at least a pleasant surprise resulting from the generosity of others.  It can be losing your pocket knife and then discovering one abandoned at the next shelter, a crib of cans of soda or even beer in a cold stream, a smile on a really tough day, or a small boy sharing his Chicken McNuggets at a scenic overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  It can be losing your rain jacket on a slack pack from Trent’s Grocery into Pearisburg, Virginia, only to have Tillie from Woods Hole Hostel phone the caretaker of Holy Family Church Hostel that someone had found a rain jacket on the trail and carried it in and the caretaker retrieving it and surprising the hiker with it.  It can mean coming upon an older couple near Davenport Gap in the Smokies scouting for a wildflower hike they would lead the next day, sharing your sightings with them, and being invited to join them for coffee and home-baked cookies.  All of these have happened to me and left me filled with gratitude.  What they have in common is that they were all unexpected both by me and by those responsible for the magic, trail angels.  
Trail magic has been stretched to include hiker feeds put on by well-intended people who set up at road crossings with grills and coolers, prepared to fete any hiker who comes along.  It may be unexpected and welcome by most hikers, but it is certainly not a spontaneous act of kindness.  That’s not something I want to debate.  Offer me a burger, a piece of fruit, or a cookie, and I’ll gladly offer my thanks, if you don’t mind my speaking while my mouth is full.  Hiker feeds have become common enough that I sometimes fantasize one at the next gap and then find myself disappointed not to find one.  Years ago, I hiked the Duncan Ridge Trail in Georgia.  It’s mostly a dry razorback ridge trail and my final day ending at Neels Gap was brutally hot.  I ran out of water and knew I still had a ways to go before reaching the AT and a spring at Slaughter Creek Gap.  I was sucking on a hard candy to keep my mouth moist.  As I came down to Wolfpen Gap, I heard noise and saw a red and white stripped tent but wasn’t sure if it was real.  I had stumbled upon a feeding station for the Six Gap Century Bicycle Race.  They invited me in and I left rehydrated, with a full water bladder, and orange juice dripping down my chin.  It was magical for me and aiding a hiker was totally unexpected by the race organizers.  
Trail magic has been written about ad nauseam but I haven’t seen the term trail miracle before.  That’s what I want to explore, not acts of kindness and generosity by other people, wonderful as they are, but seemingly impossible or improbable things wrought by the trail itself that leave a hiker amazed, inspired, and just happy to be a part of nature.  Oh, I wouldn’t mind divine trail intervention but I have yet to see fairies dancing beneath a mayapple leaf or to be greeted by The Blessed Virgin Mary swinging her legs while seated on a tree limb above the trail.  But especially when I hike alone there are moments when I just wonder.  Believe it or not, there are many sections of the Appalachian Trail that are not difficult and the tread way is not comprised of rocks, roots and mud, whole days when your feet can take care of themselves and carry you along leaving your mind free to explore other lands.  There have been moments when I am possessed by an ecstatic vision of the unity of nature. The meaning of life is clear. Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass makes sense. Each time this has happened, I am restored to the confusion and disorder of myself by the sting of a bee.  I am left with an instant, burning, sharp pain and filled with awe at having been graced with the merest glimpse of heaven, even if it is ineffable and soon forgotten.  
On my first solo hike, going hypothermic on the ascent of Tray Mountain in Georgia and suffering poor judgement, I missed the left turn to the shelter and lost the AT.  I ended up climbing down a rock face and finding a shallow cave facing due east.  Before I reversed course, I sat to regain my wits and wondered if I were in a Cherokee spirit cave.  Would the Nunnehi, the immortal spirit people, emerge and invite me to join their dance in the mountain?  Not having completed a two-day fast, would I be trapped inside the mountain forever?  Am I the only one who worries about such things?
Back in the olden days before cell phones and apps like FarOut, trail navigation was a matter of maps and luck.  You estimated distance by time elapsed and your usual hiking speed, and especially in the late afternoon when the sun strobed through the leaves there was a feeling of reality flickering in and out of existence.  I feared missing the shelter side trail, not always well marked.  I would frequently have shelter mirages caused by the angled sun light glinting off mica in a rock and appearing like the metal roof of a shelter or privy.  Sometimes the trail had a sense of deja vu like I was repeatedly hiking the same 100 yards over and over again in a hiker’s hell of Groundhog’s Day.  
There have been times when I have fallen from a height of over 10 feet, usually from an algae slicked plank bridge over a dry creek bed.  Time slows to a crawl, and I’ve always managed to twist and land on my pack with my head tucked.  Then there are minutes of taking inventory of body parts and being delighted to find that my toes and fingers move and that there is no damage aside from contusions and bruised ego.  There’s time at the moment of impact to wonder if the multiverse exists and in a parallel existence, I’m lying there dead or injured.  
Then there are times when Nature itself seems to provide a benediction, sometimes as passive as a sunset and other times as ridiculous as a kaleidoscope of blue butterflies covering me to lick off salts from my perspiration at a road crossing in Virginia or when taking a break in Virginia, leaning against a tree truck, and having a doe approach and lick the salt from my leg.  Their tongues are rough.  Or the time on Baker Peak in Vermont when a peregrine falcon stooped at me, presumably to drive me away from their nest on a cliff face.  Virginia seems to be crowded with miracles for me.  One September, I encountered six black bear in Shenandoah National Park, ranging from a mother with her cubs playing tag on the trail, to yearlings consumed with curiosity, to the largest male in the Park.  In each instance, I had a definite sense of communication, nothing terribly profound, more like “Damn!  A human.  And we were having such a nice time,” or “Keep your distance and wait your turn to pass.”

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647169,"The first image that the word discipline inspires for me is that of a dominatrix.  I don’t think it is the whip that frightens me so much as the spike-heeled shoes.  I find nothing about it attractive.  Thank goodness, that isn’t what I mean by discipline.  Maybe rule as in rule of life is closer.  You might think that retirement brings with it the cessation of rules and utter freedom to do what we want when we want to do it.  Maybe it does for some people.  For us, retirement has meant establishing new rules, a new discipline, that is every bit as rigid as our former workaday lives.  We wake up nearly the same time every morning, between 4 and 5.  I’m usually the first one up so I quietly close the bedroom door so Tom can sleep a little longer.  I put on the lights and TV, which Tom set to the local news channel before coming to bed, and check the weather on my phone to decide if it is a walking day or not.  This week, each day has been walkable.  If it’s walkable, I allow myself a breakfast sandwich of a toasted English muffin with a folded one-egg omelet with whatever meat, veggie, or cheese scrap appeals to me, and always a handful of blueberries.  If the weather precludes walking, I’ll forego the English muffin.  Tom used to have instant oatmeal every morning but lately he has substituted Greek yogurt or even a Pop-Tart, a single Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tart.  And we have coffee.  I have one cup; Tom has two.  I go into the study, respond to emails, and again check the weather to decide what clothes to wear for walking.  I leave just before 6 and get back between 8:30 and 9.  Tom will still be in the bedroom doing his exercises, having started shortly before 7.  I don’t know what he does, but respecting each other’s privacy is important so I’ve never asked.  I eat a bunch of grapes or some other fruit that doesn’t make my throat itch, check up on the news, read or write, and if it is a Y day, I’ll change clothes and walk down to the Y and get that over with, unless it’s legs day, in which case I’ll wait until after lunch.  Working legs is hard after walking 8-10 miles.  At least I find it so.  When Tom emerges, I’ll go in and shower and sometimes shave.  We alternate weeks cooking, starting on Thursday so we can avoid shopping when working people have to.  Lunch is invariable, with soup on Friday, Sunday, and Tuesday, “anything” on Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday, and “something” on Thursday.  “Something” is usually a wrap that we split or for a special treat, chicken salad and croissants or even a Paul Newman Pizza.   “Anything” for me means a veggie stir fry with a few shrimp. “Anything” for Tom means just that.  We go our own ways in the afternoon, even if it is just to separate corners of our rather small condo, but we meet in the living room at 4:00 to discuss the day and to exchange pleasantries.  On weekends and holidays, we have gin & tonics, except in Lent when I try to forego them.  It is amazing how many holidays there are.  For example, did you know that March 3rd is International Ear Care Day?  Cheers!  We started recording the episodes of The Gilded Age on HBO and now watch it on Friday at 4, a highlight of the week.  Dinner is at 6, and I’m usually falling asleep in my recliner by 8 and drift into the bedroom.  it’s not a rigid rule, but absent an externality like church on Sunday which delays lunch by an hour, it is our usual pattern.  Saturday morning means housecleaning, and we have divvied up the chores. Sometimes I will do mine on Friday afternoon so I can walk on Saturday morning, so you see, I am flexible.   
I’ve always taken great comfort in a regular life.  It’s one of the things that attracted me to monastic life.  The Order of the Holy Cross follows a modified Rule of Saint Benedict that dates from the early 6th century, with life organized around several daily offices (prayer services) and the Eucharist, with work fit in around the prayers.  I still say Matins, morning prayer, daily using all three of the daily assigned lessons, but if I’m feeling particularly naughty, I’ll skip the Psalm. On the Trail, I’m anxious to start hiking so I instead say Vespers, evening prayer.  Within a few days of hiking, I will have established a rhythm of life that is every bit as regular as my home life: waking at first light, breaking camp, breakfast, hike, morning break, hike, lunch, hike, afternoon break, hike, make camp, dinner.  My trail routine is not inviolate.  Sometimes I will stop at a shelter or park for dinner and then hike on to a dry campsite.  And I will stop to enjoy views, to watch wildlife, or just to stare off into space.  I would like to imagine that I will seek out new opportunities and adventures along the way, but for the most part, it is lather, rinse, repeat, day after day.  
There’s nothing holy or even admirable about having a rule of life, whether in a monastery or in the secular world, but most individuals and couples develop patterns of life, a Gestalt of sorts, that has meaning above and beyond the parts.  There are daily rhythms, weekly and monthly rhythms, and annual rhythms punctuated by holidays and festivals, whether it’s a liturgical calendar keeping the feasts and fasts of the Church or Friday night high school football in Texas.  We all do it.
If I didn’t have a set time to clean the bathrooms, they would probably not get cleaned.  Right after college, I went through a series of cheap apartments, moving rather than cleaning, gladly forfeiting my deposit.  It’s the same thing on the Trail.  If I didn’t have fixed expectations of hiking except on planned zero days or when my body is screaming for a break, I would find it very hard to leave town on a rainy day.  Having a trail discipline saves me from having to debate it with myself, and as is the case with most things, it’s the first step that is the most difficult.  Walking is what I do.  It defines who I am. 
But even the same is different if you look carefully.  Sunday and Tuesday this week were warm, reaching 33*!  On Tuesday, the plowed half of the bike path was nearly down to the blacktop and I was looking forward to walking on Wednesday in my trail shoes.  Instead we had a scant inch of snow overnight, so I wore my boots.  The City plowed the sidewalks and flattened half of the bike path so it was nearly smooth with 1/2” of snow above the asphalt.  That meant that every animal print appeared as black against the white background.  I saw skunk tracks near where a skunk had run across the path in front of me a couple of months ago.  And possum tracks were everywhere, coming and going, and in one spot a jumble of at least dozen possum tracks, like there had been a possum conclave earlier that morning.  A little bit further, I sensed motion in my peripheral vision and spotted the lovelies in the photo above.  Yesterday, I noticed small flocks of robins attacking sumac tree seed pods and then a mixed flock of robins and male cedar waxwings gleaning the wizened up sour cherries remaining on a tree near our condo.  A few robins and cedar waxwings overwinter in Burlington, but the ones I’ve seen tend to be solitary.  The small flocks I saw today must be the vanguard of the returning migrants, still in flocks and not quite ready to establish territories to attract the females who should be arriving soon.   How I wish that I could pretend that this was a sure sign of spring!  Alas, it was minus 4* when I walked this morning, but we are due for a warming spell of days in the 30’s and 40’s and freezing nights, perfect weather for sugaring!  
There are some trail discipline decisions I’ll need to make before or early on in my hike.  One is whether to listen to the news.  In the olden pre-cell phone days, that wasn’t an issue.  Unless you were in town, you enjoyed splendid isolation, but now it’s optional.  I’m undecided.  On one hand, divorcing myself from national and international news reminds me that what matters is the immediate now, extended to my loved ones.  On the other hand, especially with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I feel great anguish.  My grandmother, my mother’s mother, came from the Ukraine, a small village near Odessa, escaping one of the early Soviet pogroms.  She never spoke about her childhood before what she called “the pickle boat,” which I suppose referred to the way refugees were crowded in steerage.  If I decide to go news-free, that will include my time in towns, where I tend to watch the Weather Channel compulsively anyway, as though the rainy forecast is miraculously going to change.  
Another decision deals with my trail purity.  I think I can defer this for about 150 miles until Raush Creek when I have to decide whether to take the bypass route or to wade across Stony Creek, flooded by beaver activity.  Then at Lehigh Gap, do I climb through the steep Superfund Site for the fourth time or do I take the Winter Trail bypass?  Some shelters are on loop trails.  Do I have to backtrack and leave the shelter the same way I came in?  How pure must my heart be to seek after the Holly Grail of Katahdin?  
Do I want to be a true solo hiker or do I want to join others in a loose trail family?  I may not have much choice about that, since there are only 13 flip-floppers registered at ATCamp in the two week period centered on my start date, and some of them may be starting in places other than Harpers Ferry.  Registering is not mandatory so there will probably be others.
I was surprised this morning to find the walking half of the bike path largely free of ice and snow.  It won’t be above freezing today, so tomorrow I will walk in my trail shoes and wear my pack, at about 20 pounds.  My leaving town weight is no more than 25 pounds, so this will be a good beginning.  I hope to be fully broken to the pack before leaving for my hike.",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647223,"I was able to wear my hiking shoes Saturday and carried my backpack weighing 20 pounds.  That’s about what it will weigh midway through a trail section with about 2 days of food left.  The ULA Circuit fits me perfectly, without any need to custom bend the aluminum stay.  One disadvantage of this pack is that it lies against the back, meaning that it can be quite warm.  Some packs are arched to allow for air circulation between the pack and the back.  I’m fortunate in not sweating profusely, so it doesn’t bother me, and the X-Pac fabric shouldn’t absorb odor.   Before winter set in, I had gotten accustomed to wearing a weight vest with up to 30 pounds on my morning walks.  The 20-pound pack didn’t feel heavy, but I knew it was there especially on uphills. I limited my miles for the first day.  I was a little slower and my stride length was shorter.  I was definitely ready for a snack (grapes) when I got home.  I will get used to it quickly and add another four or five pounds.  This will be the first hike when I’ve actually trained before hand wearing my pack.  It will be a new experience for me starting a hike already broken in to the pack weight!
A friend at church took me aside yesterday.  She’s been following my journal and is concerned for me, but that’s not what she said.  “Aren’t you worried?” she asked me.  I suspect she views me as addled, because I assured her that I’m not worried about my hike, but that I am getting excited.  There’s a big difference.  I’m not immune to worries.  I worry every time I get into a car. I worry about climate change and the stupidity and cupidity of world leaders.  I worry about attempts to suppress voters and to impose archaic standards on women and LGBTQIA folks.  I worry about acronyms getting out of control, split infinitives and misplaced modifiers.  I worry about things that I can’t do anything or not much about.  I try to choose a safer car (Subaru Outback) and exercise my right to vote, but short of staying home in bed with the blanket over my head, I am exposed to the worries of the world.           
Now excitement!  That I feel.  My dreams lately are full of hiking, rarely in a discernible place.  Sometimes I’m with people, even people I know, but usually I’m alone.  Unless I see a reflection, I only rarely see myself in a dream, but it’s not like looking through my eyes or wearing a GoPro camera. I am there but seem absent.  Sometimes I am walking and on the best nights, my stride lengthens and I start to run and then I find myself flying, always vertical, never like Superman, through the trees like a Northern goshawk. I have yet to splat against a tree trunk.  The feeling of freedom is intense but simultaneously humble, like I must be very careful not to disturb anything and to fly invisibly through the forest.  Sometimes I come upon a shelter, always a nice clean shelter and never a nasty one, and find a long-lost friend there, someone I should have told that I loved.  I’ll keep those dreams private!  
This will be my fourth time hiking from the Potomac River to the Hudson River.  I know the towns and places I want to visit again and places that I will avoid.  Of course, I picture the first day as bright sunshine with a few puffy clouds, cool temperatures and a gentle breeze.  After breakfast at the Quality Inn, I’ll hoist my pack and take my first step on the Appalachian Trail at U.S. 40 and Shenandoah Street, just up from the hotel.  I’ll time my arrival at ATC Headquarters (0.5 mile including the side trail) for 9:00, pick up my thru-hiker's hangtag, pose for my thru-hiker portrait, return to the trail and walk downhill (0.7 mile) and across the Potomac River Footbridge to the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal Towpath (0. 2 mile).  Then it’s a level 4.0 miles on compacted dirt with the Potomac River to my right and occasional cyclists and runners whizzing by to Weverton Cliffs, a 500’ climb, where I’ll take my first break.  Finally the trail will enter the woods and gently bump-de-bump within a couple hundred feet of elevation change to Ed Garvey Shelter in another 2.1 miles.  If I’m tired, I’ll stop there, but probably I’ll continue another 3.7 miles to Gathland State Park and have dinner.  There’s a covered picnic pavilion, potable water and even flush toilets!  It’s also the site of the War Correspondents Monument, a good place to reflect on the sacrifices of our fourth estate.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 188 journalists were killed in the five year period ending 2021.  You can see their names at https://cpj.org/data/killed.  I’m still old-fashioned enough to believe that independent journalism is our best way of knowing the truth about what is happening in our world, until the present becomes the past and the domain of historians, keeping in mind that “The past is never dead.  It’s not even past.” [William Faulkner, Requiem for a Nun (1961)] I guess the attacks on freedom of the press is something I worry about too.  I’ll load up with water and hike the remaining 0.4 miles to Crampton Gap Shelter and set my tent, making my first day 11.4 miles.  At least that’s my hope!
The FarOut App has just updated their trail mileages to correspond to The Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers’ Companion, so I’m doing a final revision of my hiking schedule spreadsheet and updating for changes in services.  I can visualize almost every waypoint and the weather is always perfect in my imagination.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647359,"From Ghoulies and Ghoosties, long-leggety Beasties, and Things that go Bump in the Night, Good Lord, deliver us!  [from Alfred Noye’s 1909 anthology, The Magic Casement]
Have you ever spent the night alone in the woods, shivering in your sleeping bag not from the cold but from what your fevered imagination is picturing out there?  Or does the very thought terrify you?  I found a marvelous word for this fear, Nyctohylophobia, Greek for night forest dread.  Bwaa-ha-ha!  You are not alone.   I’ve read that 41% of people report that they would not want to venture or sleep alone in the forest at night.
When my partners and I started our CPA practice in 1993, we had no clients and under Florida law at the time, we were forbidden to contact people, even former clients, to solicit their business.  Tombstone ads announcing our practice were as aggressive as our marketing could be.  Building a practice would take time.  We knew we wanted to establish a high-quality full-service firm and to do that required first-class space and the illusion of permanence.  The owner and landlord of one of the better buildings took a liking to us and agreed to build out space for us.  We had to execute personal guarantees, which were worthless, and he knew that.  He also switched his accounting to us and his advice was invaluable.  I would like to think that we repaid his faith over the years.  He and I certainly became friends, and he took great delight in the stories of my solo Appalachian Trail adventures.  I invited him along several times, but the fear of the woods was deeply ingrained in him.  Eventually he signed up for a week-long National Outdoor Leadership School program in Western North Carolina that taught him the necessary skills and culminated in each student spending a night alone in the woods.  I’ve never seen a man so proud and happy over an accomplishment, and I am sure that he would have become a backpacking companion had he not contracted a cancer and died in his late 50’s.  I still think of him often.
His fear of the woods made me wonder why I never suffered that particular phobia.  I was certainly not a brave person and would sometimes fake sickness to avoid having to deliver a book report in front of the class in junior high (middle school).  i was indoctrinated into all of the classic fairy tales and should have feared the woods as places infested by wolves and witches and perhaps even dragons.  Three Billy Goats Gruff especially terrified me and when we were driving somewhere, I would always close my eyes when we crossed a bridge, so I wouldn’t see the hideous troll, trusting the logic that if I couldn’t see him, he couldn’t see me.  It worked.  That was back in the days when I thought that if I could see the actors on TV, they could see me, and I wouldn’t change clothes in front of the TV set.  
Yet somehow as far back as I can remember, the woods were my safe place.  There was a wooded area on the western side of the subdivision where I grew up in Baltimore County, Maryland.  From the time I was allowed to cross the street, that’s where I spent my time, sometimes curled up in the hollow trunk of dead chestnut tree.  The woods meant refuge to me, a place to escape from the kids who taunted me for being uncoordinated (which I was) and just different (also true).  To this day, I still feel a deep sense of peace when I step under the forest canopy, especially in the midatlantic deciduous forest where I’ll be starting this hike.  My phone will be in airplane mode, and I know that the dreaded they can’t find me.  
My first night alone in the woods was at Hawk Mountain Shelter in Georgia in 1994.  I had the shelter to myself and was awakened by helicopters flying at tree top level, hovering and dropping flour grenades and then Army Rangers rappelling down.  They were training for the NATO involvement in the Bosnian War.  I wasn’t frightened, just angry.  I had not ordered room service.  The next night at the old Gooch Gap Shelter, since removed, was much more peaceful.  My only fright was being nuzzled by a large dog as I attempted to shower beneath my water bag and being surprised in the buff by the dog’s people.  
Trees rubbing together in the wind can mimic the worst haunted house sounds.  The maniacal calls of the Barred Owl can’t compare to the mournful whinny of a Screech Owl for sending a frisson up my spine.  But the nightbird most loathed by backpackers must be the humble Whippoorwill, with its incessant call, sometimes interrupted for a few minutes if he manages to attract a mate. 
I’ve only been awakened by a bear in camp once, on Mt. LeConte in the Smokies in 1970, when we foolishly left our small rucksacks with food beneath a tree by our tent.  The bear was far less frightened than we were and in spite of our protestations, took all three in its jaw and vanished into the mountain laurel.  We lost not only our food but our ponchos, which would sorely have been welcome the next morning.  One of the few times I was glad to have sheltered instead of tented was on the Long Trail in 2002 when a moose on its way to the spring ambled through where I would have been tented.  I’ve been surrounded by coyotes, their eyes glowing silver, at Knot Maul Shelter in Virginia one fall.  You may have noticed that many of my misadventures happen in Virginia.  That’s no accident.  I’ve hiked Virginia several times but more importantly 557.0 miles of the 2,194.3 miles of the Appalachian Trail are in Virginia.  Another time in Southwest Virginia, I was tented at the edge of a pasture and was kept awake by something big walking around my tent.  At first light, I summoned my courage and looked out into the face of a contented cow.  At Ten Mile River Shelter in Connecticut, a lovely shelter set in a hemlock grove, I awakened to the stares of a gray fox in the shelter clearing.  We sat there calmly regarding each other for several minutes before he got bored and sauntered off.  He had delivered a dream to me, which I confirmed as true that day in Kent, but that is another story.  
I haven’t been scared by people at night, but I confess truly homicidal thoughts in 2018, at the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel in Pine Grove Furnace State Park, Pennsylvania, near the halfway point of the trail.  A skinny, little guy about my height with a pointy chin managed to keep the entire men’s dorm awake with his cacophonous snoring.  I can’t recall his trail name but I think of him as Ferret. 
There are all kinds of therapies available to treat nyctohylophobia including exposure therapy, talk therapy, behavioral therapy and even medicines.  Don’t let your fear of the the woods at night spoil your fun!",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Sat",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647541,"Last Saturday’s snow quickly melted, so on my morning walks this week I’ve been wearing my backpack fully loaded at leaving town weight, 23-1/2 pounds.  There was still some ice on the bike path Monday morning hidden beneath a dusting of snow that fell overnight.  I started with my hiking poles strapped to the front of my pack (which I persist in thinking of as the back of my pack), but they were soon in my hands.  Even so at one point my concentration drifted and my feet went out from under me.  It was more of a controlled slide, but I have to count it as a fall since my butt hit ground.  My rule is that it’s a fall if either butt or knees contact the ground unintentionally.  I sat there glad to be alone, but from out of the woods came one of our homeless persons to check on me.  He obviously had his own problems but at that moment his concern was for me.  The combination of self-reliance and caring for others wrapped in a love of nature seems essential to the Vermont character.   I stood up and assured him that I was fine.  We introduced ourselves, and Kat and I walked together for the next mile.  I gave him a little something for breakfast or whatever his needs were.  I’ve looked for him on my walks since then but haven’t seen him.  Could my guardian angel be a homeless person?  Honestly, I would prefer a fairy godparent.  
It warmed up on Monday and the bike path is now ice free.  I’m not even bringing my hiking poles. Yesterday and today were so warm, in the mid 40’s at 6AM, that I’ve been comfortable walking in shorts and a fleece hoody, Vermont haute couture.   Without the sticks, I find myself leaning slightly forward to bring the center of gravity in.  For the first couple of mornings, this created tension in my lower quadriceps, but Brother Ass has adjusted to it.  I’ve also slightly modified the way I load my pack.  At the bottom are still my sleeping bag, sleeping pad, tent, and clothes, with the bear canister set vertically on top.  I keep it centered by wedging my day pack with all of my little kits on one side and my puffy on the other.  What I found yesterday is that if I place my wedges slightly toward the back of the pack, it forces the canister against the front of the pack instead of against my spine.  Much more comfortable!   Little things can make such a difference.  
I also found that I have a shoe problem.  The shoes I plan to start with, Scarpa Zen Pro metric size 44-1/2, are broken in and seem ideal.  Pennsylvania will fry them so I planned to switch to a second pair when I return home for a few days from New York.  The second pair are an older pair of size 44 that I wore on my aborted thru-hike last year.  Following the suggestion of Eduardo, the shoe guru at the new REI store, I’m starting the lacing at the fourth eyelet to open up the toe box. That seemed to work fine, until I tried them for ten miles with full pack weight.  Then my pinky and ring toes complained.  I went online to order a second pair of size 44-1/2 and discovered that Scarpa has discontinued the Zen Pro.  There are still pairs available at various outfitters, but that would only delay the inevitable.  So next week, I’ll visit Eduardo for his recommendations.  I’m not fussy about my shoes.  I only ask for:

Low shoe
Breathable — no waterproof membrane
Sole equivalent to Vibram XS-Trek for excellent traction
Torsional rigidity because my feet tend to freely pronate
Tongue loop, to prevent tongue from sliding too far to the side
Narrow heel so that even unlaced it grips my heel
Roomy toe box

I know I’ll have to compromise, but maybe I’ll find a pair I like even better.  The last two days I’ve worn much lighter shoes (Scarpa Rapid and Epic Lite) with the SuperFeet Trail Blazer Comfort insoles.  I’ve moved faster with less soreness afterwards, so now I’m thinking of changing shoes.  I might start with the Zen Pro for the Pennsylvania rocks and then switch to lighter shoes when I come home for a few days in late May.  Where is this new found flexibility coming from?
I continue to complete items on my pre-hike checklist, like scheduling the snow tire changeover, but I seem to add more items than I check off.  This week I added a reminder to lubricate the gaskets on my bear canister, to apply Velcro tape to the back of my shoes for the Dirty Girl Gaiters, and to start a nasal corticosteroid a week before leaving Burlington since the oak trees will be pumping out pollen in Maryland.
I’ve decided to go without coffee on this hike, except in towns.  I only drink one cup a day at home (Peet’s Major Dickason’s Blend).  It will take me a week to wean myself off it so I don’t start the hike with a headache.  I had planned to bring the little tubes of Starbucks instant Italian Dark Roast and add it to my Carnation Essentials (Instant Breakfast), but finding it in trail towns can be a hassle.  It’s among the better instant coffees, but even so, I can’t abide it as a hot beverage.  So coffee will become a town treat on this hike.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Fri",0

Another myth you may have heard is that a pound on your feet is like five pounds on your back.  But it turns out that this one is true, or at least is supported by a serious study:  Bruce H Jones, Michael M.

In my last episode, I listed seven criteria that I was looking for in a new hiking shoe:

Low shoe
Breathable — no waterproof membrane
Rugged sole, with both excellent traction on wet rock and durability
Torsional rigidity - my feet freely pronate
Tongue loop
Narrow heel so that unlaced it grips my heel
Roomy toe box

and left it as a cliffhanger.  I’m now happy to resolve it.  I added an eighth criterion

Velcro patch on heel

and started my research by asking my friends which shoes they wore hiking.   Altra, Oboz, Hoka and Topos emerged as contenders.  Then I checked articles with names like Ten Best Trail Running Shoes of 2022 and checking out real reviews on REI.com.  The Altra Olympus 4 seemed to meet all of my criteria except possibly the torsional rigidity, but would they actually fit my feet?
I phoned the local REI store to see if Eduardo, the shoe guru i found a few weeks ago, would be working.  Apparently, I wasn’t the only one who noticed his superb skills in everything foot related.  Instead of selling shoes, Eduardo now trains other employees in shoes. The guy who served me starting by asking if I knew my size.  I answered 10-1/2 and that Eduardo had measured me just a few weeks earlier.  He practically genuflected and said, “Eduardo, himself?”  He brought out the Altra shoes and they fit well and survived both the ramp and the kick-the-wall test.  I purchased another pair of SuperFeet TrailBlazer Comfort Insoles and switched out the flimsy Altra insoles.  The combination was perfect, adding the rigidity I need.  The combination of the REI dividends I had and a 20% off coupon saved me $67!  
The acid test was wearing the Altra Olympus 4 shoes this morning with a full pack load.  I came back through the woods to test them on actual trail, including a couple of steep ups, and felt like doing Snoopy’s little dance.  Yes, yes, yes!  Oh, happy feet!  I weighed the shoe with the SuperFeet insole at 12.8 ounces versus 20.6 ounces for the Scarpa Zen Pro, a reduction of 15.6 ounces for the pair.  Using the Army rule of thumb, this equates to a pack weight reduction of 4.875 pounds, exceeding the weight of a half gallon of water. 
Altra shoes are a little odd looking because the toe box is wider than the heel, like a real foot.  My toes can actually wiggle.  Not only is there a Velcro patch on the heel, a feature they call GaiterTrap, but there is also a small metal ring at the bottom of the laces for the hook at the front of my gaiters.  As a bonus, they come in blue to match my pack.  Isn’t that a fashion rule on the Appalachian Trail?   
The Altra shoes are now consigned to the closet until the week I leave for the trail.  They needed no breaking in.  I’ll wear the Scarpa shoes in the meanwhile, so that when I switch to the Altra my pack will feel so much lighter!  Altra shoes are so widely available that I see no reason to order a second pair in advance.  
My other task this week was getting a free timed-entry pass to the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture for April 20.  The tickets become available at 8AM 30 days in advance.  I waited until 8:30 and there were only four tickets remaining!  
I leave for the trail four weeks from tomorrow and hope for no more drama until then.",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647904,"We have lived in Burlington for six years now, and I’ve always heard to stay off the trails during mud season, which runs from the the first thaw to Memorial Day weekend.  This year it began on the vernal equinox, the start of astronomical spring.  I never thought to ask what was so special about mud season since mud isn’t unique to spring.  
The first time I hiked the AT in Vermont was in autumn of 1998, going southbound from Hanover, New Hampshire.  I flew into Boston Logan and then took a very small U.S. Air plane to Lebanon, just south of Hanover, planning to start my hike that afternoon.  Instead our plane’s luggage went to Presque Isle, Maine and vice versa.  I ended up spending the night at a motel in the shopping plaza below the airport and eating in a Chinese restaurant where my fortune read, “He who walks slowly walks best.”  My pack was brought to me that evening, and in spite of that inauspicious beginning, it was an excellent hike.  I had no rain, very few bugs, and I met a jazz pianist whose brother gave me a lift to the airport in Albany, New York for my flight home.  There was no mud and I never needed to touch rock with my hands.  When I hiked the Long Trail in 2002 and 2003, it rained, and I gained an appreciation or at least respect for Vermont mud.  After having one foot sink down to knee depth, I quickly learned that if the trail is black and I couldn’t see footprints, it might not a good idea to step there.  Okay, I thought, when it rains in Vermont, there is mud.  But why does it deserve a special season?
I’ve finally gotten curious enough to look up mud season, and it is different from the run-of-the-mill Vermont mud that follows each rain, at least in cause.  As should be no surprise, the ground freezes in winter in Northern New England, to a depth of five or six feet.  The depth of the freezing is actually inverse to the amount of snow, since heavy snow serves as an insulating blanket.  
This winter Burlington saw less snow than usual, 59”, compared to an average of 72”.  On Mount Mansfield, the highest summit in Vermont, the snowpack peaked at 57” compared to an average of 75”.  So presumably, the ground froze deeper than usual.
When the ground starts to thaw, the melt water can’t percolate down into the earth since it’s frozen below, and it either runs off creating flooding along the streams and rivers or just ponds wherever it can creating the mud bogs beloved to Vermont hikers. It takes quite a while for the ground to totally thaw and the mud to coalesce into trail again.  Anyone hiking through it in the meantime or attempting to step around it amplifies the problem by compacting the soil or widening the bog.  This is the time of year when school buses meet students at the nearest paved road instead of attempting to navigate dirt or gravel roads, and tow trucks are kept very busy.  
I’ve timed my hike so that I won’t be in Vermont until mid-June, and now I know why.  If my timing is good, I’ll miss mud season but hit the peak of black fly season!",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648045,"I only time I enjoy reading poetry is while on a long hike, when time slows down and I live in a space that is neither here nor there, where the trail ceases to be linear but seems to circle back around on itself, when no concerns compete with the rhythm, words and possible rhymes of a poem, when the poem is free to echo in my skull until it merges with my soul. Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, the very slim first edition, kept me company for several hikes.  Dylan Thomas was a good companion another year.  The last to join me were the Sabbath Poems of Wendell Berry.  Who will hike with me this year?
That’s a question for you, Dear Readers. I welcome your suggestions in my guest book. I prefer an e-edition, but if it is paper, it must be thin and lightweight! 
Three weeks now until I start hiking. I’ve tested my sleeping pad and it seems to be leak-free, meaning that it deflates only slightly overnight when weighted down, as my warm breaths cool to room temperature and some air works it’s way through the fabric like a birthday balloon. I just now checked my BeFree filter and it’s slow. I’m soaking it overnight in distilled water to remove mineral deposits.  If that doesn’t work, I’ll replace it.  Next week comes the dreaded trimming of my body hair and the inevitable itching that follows.  How do sheep stand it?
I find myself already starting to make the mental adjustment to the trail, withdrawing a little more than accustomed from regular life.  Walking yesterday morning, I had my AirPods in but forgot to tune in to NPR until I was halfway down the hill.  I found the news bothersome and switched to the classical station after a bit.  I imagine that starting next week, I’ll go unplugged and allow my thoughts free rein.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648326,"In past years, when I’ve asked my readers to suggest novels to bring on my hikes, there have been plenty of ideas.  But for poets there have been none.  I guess I’m not alone in having a hard time reading poetry in regular life.  Poetry can seem like an archaic art form in a digital age, when the emphasis and funding in higher education is focused on STEM.    Words have lost their power in the modern age, yet in a hundred or a thousand years, what will we be remembered for?  It won’t be STEM.  Science, technology and engineering constantly obsolete themselves as progress marches on, and except for historians of science, yesterday’s science is of little interest.  Mathematics has the advantage of being the language of creation and as such is eternal. If we are spared destroying ourselves and our environment, we might be remembered for our literature, our words, our art, and our music.   I suppose I am a dinosaur in my thinking.  That doesn’t upset me.  One of my favorite books as a child learning to read was The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek written by Evelyn Sibley Lampman and published in 1955.  I was very fond of George the Stegosaurus and imagined that he visited me at night.  I am not giving up on words and find support from a very high authority.  “Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.” [Albus Dumbledore (J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows)]
I reached out to a friend who is an associate professor of English (medieval studies) at the University of Vermont for a recommendation of a poet.  Maurice Manning’s Bucolics (2007) now resides on my iPhone.  Jen awarded it a rare ALL CAPS recommendation, noting, “It is practically the Psalms.  Only not.  But yes very much so.”  So I won’t be hiking alone after all.  My tramily member and friend Willow, who thru-hiked in 2018, also suggested a few poets, but I had already purchased Bucolics.  I’ll hold her recommendations in reserve.  
My old BeFree Filter was not salvageable, so I’ve replaced it and will endeavor to swish the new one in a stream daily to better maintain its flow rate.  While at REI, I also purchased a couple of single-portion freeze dried dinners, good until my hiker appetite kicks in. Their “best by” date is January 2052, which I trust will exceed my own expiry.  At our local food co-op, City Market, I purchased two O.W.L. energy bars, a couple of my favorite Luna flavors, and some local beef jerky.  Since I had to visit my all-time favorite chocolatier, Nu Chocolat, for Easter bunnies, I also bought a bar of their 65% Columbian dark chocolate for the start of my hike.  If it were not Lent, it would already have vanished, without any need of magic.   I’ll pick up the rest of my starting food at the regular grocery.  I have pledged to buy only foods that I Iook forward to eating.  I won’t buy food that is healthy and good for me unless it also tastes good.  Kale will not find its way into my bear canister.  I also got my second Covid-19 booster shot, almost six months to the day after my first one.  Is it necessary?  Probably not, but my age places me at increased risk.  I’m continuing to mask indoors until the start of my hike, perhaps more out of habit than medical necessity.  
There are finally more positive signs of spring here than mud.  I’ve seen a few snowdrops blooming, and the first crocus (or if you prefer, crocuses or even croci) are just days from blooming.  I saw furry pussy willow catkins this morning, and Scilla can’t be far behind.  Daffodil, tulip, and iris stems are emerging and the buds on my favorite forsythia are just starting to open.  I hate leaving Vermont before the full glory of spring, after having waited so long for it.  
The nearer I get to my departure date, the slower time seems to pass.  I’ve resisted the urge to add additional gear to my kit, and I’m not suffering from any doubts.  Perhaps that is foolish, but I have it on good authority that “The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it.”  Recognize it?  Right!  Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie (published as a book in 1911).",,View Entry,"Apr 05, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648663,"We have had a surfeit of cold rainy days lately, mostly with heavy drizzle or light rain and temperatures ranging from the mid-thirties to the mid-forties.  It’s the kind of rain that would hardly be noticeable on a hike, like elevator music, irritating in the background but harmless.  But at home, talking myself into going out walking for a couple of hours in the rain is a hopeless battle.  Perhaps it is  a blessing since it is causing me to taper off my training a bit, and I will start the hike without any sore muscles.  
Today, however, is sunny, the only time “sunny” shows on weather.com's 10-day forecast, still a bit chilly this morning at 31*, but oh, so beautiful!  For variety’s sake, I drove to my usual turning point at Leddy Park and walked north on the bike path through the Winooski Delta and across the Winooski River to Delta Park in neighboring Colchester.  I had forgotten how beautiful it is.  I even saw a bald eagle on a snag above the river.  That’s not particularly unusual.  After 35 years of recovery efforts, bald eagles have been removed from Vermont’s list of threatened and endangered species  Even so, I feel honored to see one, another sure harbinger of who-knows-what.   
My pre-hike checklist is nearly complete.  It took a week to wean myself off coffee, even though I only drank one cup a day, and finally I’m not waking up with a caffeine withdrawal headache.  I’ve lubricated the gaskets on my bear canister and washed my lighter puffy, Buff, and fleece cap after lots of use this winter.  I finally trimmed my body hair so the itching will be over before I leave.  I’ve bought my starting food except for flour tortillas and a hunk of well-aged Parmigiano Reggiano.  It’s a great cheese for adding flavor and lasts a long time without refrigeration.    I’ll miss Tom’s birthday, so I’ve already bought his present.  There’s no hiding anything in a small condo, but not to worry.  Tom would never open a package or even shake it before the occasion arrives.  That’s inconceivable.  Even as a kid, he never searched for gifts left by Santa in the custody of his parents.  
The days are just creeping along now and I find myself growing impatient to start.  I am having thoughts like, “This is my last week to cook until August or November!” or “I only have to shave five more times before my hike!”  I shave my neck and cheeks every other day.  “Saturday will be my last time cleaning the bathrooms before my hike!”",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648880,"I’m scraping the bottom of the job jar looking for things to do before my hike.  I unstopped a bathroom sink drain and took the car in for its snow tire changeover.  I’ve packed and repacked my backpack several times.  I haven’t added anything, but I did remove a little food.  I really don’t need both dried blueberries and dried mango to start.  A snack pack of olives, however, is staying as a reward for the last day of my first section.  Like a lab rat, I respond well to positive reinforcement.  A square of good chocolate in the evening is fine reward for a day spent walking.
I’m met my friend Vieva at 9 this morning (she keeps regular hours, unlike early bird me) and we walked the bike path north of where I stopped on Monday.  After winding through a suburban neighborhood on streets, the path picks up in Airport Park and then follows a causeway between Lake Champlain and Malletts Bay.  The entire lakefront bike path is a rails-to-trail conversion.  The tracks ran north to Isle La Motte, just a few miles south of the Canadian border.  You might wonder why the railroad went to the expense of running a spur out to a rather insignificant lake island, requiring construction of a three-mile causeway and several bridges.  It wasn’t to celebrate the spot where Samuel de Champlain first set foot in what is now Vermont, but rather to service the quarry there that produced a much sought after fossil-rich black limestone.  It was used to build Radio City Music Hall in New York City and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.  The causeway makes a delightful walk on a cool sunny day like today.  Vieva spotted a loon, but I missed it.   It was a fitting celebration for what is probably my last walk before I leave for the trail.
Tomorrow (Saturday) will be raining again.  I will suffer through the Easter Vigil that starts at 8PM, my regular bedtime, so I will be tired and grumpy on Sunday and very ready to end my Lenten abstinence of alcohol and sweets.  A Bloody Mary (made with gin) and dark chocolate bunny ears and head sounds much better than taking a walk.  Monday I’ll be assisting the organ tuner at the Cathedral, a grand way of saying that I’ll be pressing keys and pedals while he tunes the pipes.  And Tuesday, naturally, will be raining, and I’ll go for a pre-hike haircut.  That leaves only charging my electronics and trimming my finger and toe nails before doing a final packing.  And then Wednesday, I travel to Harpers Ferry.  Finally I’m feeling a little excitement!",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649141,"Well, it is only mid-April after all.  By the time the snow switches to rain early this afternoon, we should have accumulated 3-5” of the heaviest, wettest snow imaginable, since it is just 32* now.  It will get up into the low 40’s today and stay in the upper 30’s tonight.  Helped along by the rain, the snow shouldn’t last long and certainly won’t affect my getting to the airport tomorrow morning.  I hope the sidewalks are clear by the time I walk down for my haircut at 2:00.  I really don’t want to put on my winter boots again.  The daffodils have started to bloom, and they should be just fine.
I just checked in for my 6:08 flight tomorrow and American offered me an upgrade to first class for $43, including free checked bags.  It would have cost me $30 to check my pack duffel anyway, so it is well worth it for the expedited security line, and I won’t say no to a Bloody Mary, for the vitamins, of course.  As a result of a federal court decision yesterday, masking is now longer required on planes or in airports.  I will be masking anyway and just hope I’m not given grief by a fellow passenger.  
I had planned on going to the Y this morning, but somehow that doesn’t seem wise.  So I will do my final packing now, checking my gear list twice just to be sure that I’m not forgetting something vital.  Twice I’ve forgotten my phone charging cable.  The alarm is set for 2AM.",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Tue",0

If you don’t know, creemee is what Vermonters call frozen custard, maple being the preeminent flavor.  American Airlines was very pleasant this morning.  It was well worth the $13 for the upgrade to first class, just to have room to cross my legs and to be made to feel welcome. And a Bloody Mary was a nice celebratory touch to start this hike. 
I successfully navigated the Metro without  the FarOut app!  It took me three tries, however, to find out where I could check my pack for the day at Union Station (the right side of the Amtrak ticket counter). There’s a branch of the Post Office at the end of the food court, and I mailed my pack duffel home. Then finally I went outside.  I felt like Dorothy landing in Munchkinland!  Green everywhere!  Trees got leaves!  What fun to walk up the Mall to the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture!  It’s on the cool side, 50*, but sunny, maybe not as blue as I would prefer. We could see the brown haze of pollution on our approach to National Airport.  
The museum was crowded with both people and exhibits. The lowest level is a journey of people ripped from their African civilizations and cultures and brought in chains to the colonies. The walls are festooned with the names and countries of slave ships with the starting number of human cargo and the much smaller number who survived the Middle Passage, only to be cast into an even greater outer darkness upon arrival in the New World. Narrations from autobiographies of formerly enslaved persons add to the genial mood. The visitor winds through exhibits of slavery by region complete with manacles, slave auction blocks and the words of enslavers justifying the system they richly profited from. The promise of freedom brought by the Civil War is dashed on the shoals of reconstruction morphed into Jim Crow. The upper floors highlight the accomplishments of African Americans in every field from science to every genre of music to cuisine and athletics, but in no way do the upper floors excuse or justify the basement. On one hand two hours is not nearly long enough for this museum and on the other hand thirty minutes would be sufficient to induce major depression. 
Fish & Chips and a local IPA at nearby Elephant & Castle dulled my conscience. Then I took the Metro to the REI for a gas canister and back to Union Station. 
I’ve  boarded Amtrak Capital Limited and met another thru-hiker starting northbound tomorrow as well. Scott looks younger than I am and will be staying at the Town’s Inn. I did that last August, with Rocky Raccoon. It’s a good place if you really like train whistles all through the night. I opted for the Quality Inn this time.  At the Harpers Ferry Station, I met two more thru-hikers who were on the train. 
I opted to eat dinner at the Rabbit Hole since it is near the station and about a mile from the hotel. I sat outside on the deck and was glad for my puffy!  I had a chef’s salad and a local draft brown ale. The ale was better than the salad. Then I walked to the Quality Inn via Shenandoah Street and a short distance on U.S. 340, going around the hill I will climb tomorrow. I’ve stayed here many times and it has always been nice and a fair value (ask for the hiker discount!).  At the hotel, I met another three hikers, all starting tomorrow and going north. I had fantasies of being alone, but that isn’t going to happen.  I’ve been up since 1:45 this morning and the bed is so comfortable even if it isn’t quite 8:00 yet!

Breakfast at the Quality Inn was microwave Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, yogurt, cereal, pastries and fresh fruit. I checked out at 8:30 and started my hike across from the hotel, up to the side trail to ATC Headquarters. There were six hikers there to get hang tags but first we had to be lectured on the seven principles of Leave No Trace. I left with the other five who belong to a hiking club in Atlanta at 10:00. I kept up with them on the C&O Canal Towpath until I needed to “find a tree.”  I caught up a couple more times, but they are faster than me and a close knit group. I’ll find my tramily soon!  The climb up Weverton Cliffs wasn’t bad, but I’m tired. I had lunch, a tortilla and a pouch of chicken, on the cliffs. It started raining, just light showers, but when I got here to Ed Garvey Shelter after only 7.3 miles I decided to stay. It doesn’t look like I’ll be alone!  The seasonal spring is a long way down but piped and running well. There’s a more reliable spring another 0.3 miles downhill. I’m glad I didn’t need it.

I was in my sleeping bag at 7 last night and except for peeing once at 2, I stayed there until 6.  I didn’t sleep the entire 11 hours, but I awoke to the rising sun - the shelter faces east — feeling refreshed and myself again. I don’t know who I was yesterday but I’m glad he is gone. There were scads of thru- and section-hikers there. I slept in the lower level of the shelter with two women heading into Harpers Ferry today. One of them had a sleeping pad that looked very plush, maybe 6” thick, but every time she moved, which was often, it sounded like a dog wrestling with a very large chew toy. I was so tired that it hardly bothered me. One woman from Detroit sleeping in the loft had three kids, the oldest a boy of 13. Usually I don’t get along with kids, but these little ones wouldn’t settle for that and more or less adopted me. I left at 7:15 feeling wonderful. At Gathland Park with the memorial arch to war correspondents I met three thru-hikers from Roanoke, Virginia, Mis-calculate (a retired CPA), 21Q [uestions], and Refresh. They have a friend who is shuttling them for their first section of the trail, taking them to a campground near Gettysburg for the nights. I expect I’ll be seeing a lot of them. The trees in the gaps are leafing out.  On the ridge, only the understory has leaves.  The mayapples are just coming up.  Violets and bluebells are among the more common wildflowers. 
I found that the piezoelectric igniter on my stove wasn’t working yesterday so I went into my first aid kit for my mini-Bic lighter. It is nearly out of fuel and I had to hold it in my fist to get it to light. So what do I see lying in the middle of the trail this morning?  A blue regular size Bic lighter!  It was a lovely day, maybe a little warm. I snacked at Gathland and a viewpoint and had a leisurely lunch at Rocky Run Shelter before getting to Dahlgren about 2:00. The State of Maryland operates a bathhouse for hikers here, with hot showers!  There are six tent platforms and a large grassy field. The couple at the adjacent site, Clay and Dani, were at Garvey last night. They got married last week and now have started a thru-hike. I mentioned receiving the magical lighter today. Clay had dropped it!  He has a spare so I’m welcome to it. 
About 0.2 mile north of here on level excellent trail or along a service road is US 40A and the historic Old South Mountain Inn. I am playing trail angel this evening and hosting Clay and Dani for dinner to celebrate their marriage.  We have all showered and changed into our cleanest clothes for the event.  The crab cakes were better than I remembered!
It has been an excellent day and I’m grateful for magic received and the opportunity to do a little magic.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649452,"I slept well and was the first one out at 6:50. I saw many does and fawns who seems very nonchalant about me. Then I began to see other people, so many that I started counting them. Most were day hikers, a number were weekenders and section hikers and a couple were GA-ME thru-hikers. Altogether I counted 114 people on the trail, not counting people who have come into the shelter. I have never experienced numbers of hikers like this before. I’m tenting above the shelter — I’ve had enough people for today!    So much for the splendid isolation of the trail.  My favorite was Óscar D. Grouch. She’s from Tel Aviv, a sergeant in the Israeli army. She started in Harpers Ferry and has two months to see how far she can get. Our speeds are compatible but it’s obvious that she isn’t looking for company, or at least not for mine. 
It’s a beautiful day, starting about 50* and overcast but it cleared off and reached 72*, with a gentle breeze. That could be what brought out the crowds. Finding a discrete place to pee was a little more challenging than usual. 
The trail was mostly excellent, occasionally rocky, with only one really nasty section of about 1/2 mile where the trail traces the extremely rocky ridge. Most of the day it stayed on the west side of the ridge until it crossed over to descend to the shelter. My knees were uncomplaining and I got here at 2:00, leaving me only 9.6 miles to Pen Mar Park tomorrow. I phoned ahead to the Cobblestone Hotel to reserve a room. Just as I was ready to start setting up a shuttle driver, I received an email from Curious George. Rocky Raccoon and I met him at Bears Den Hostel in Northern Virginia last August. We’ve stayed in touch and he’s offered me a ride from the park to the hotel!  His wife will be with him, so I’ll change into my cleaner shirt out of consideration for her!  More trail magic, yes?  I am grateful. 
I started seeing stone walls today, like the one pictured. The trail running alongside it was obviously an old road.  As I understand it, aside from marking boundaries, the walls provided something to do with the rocks that made farming so difficult. Given the Civil War history of this area, it was easy for me to imagine troops hiding behind the walls ready to ambush whoever came along. The trail follows South Mountain through Maryland and into Pennsylvania. Aside from skirmishes at the various gaps, Antietam is just to the west and Gettysburg is to the east of the trail in Pennsylvania. The rocks in these walls witnessed such history. I try not to think much about it or I start to smell the metallic odor of blood rising from the ground.","Dahlgren Backpackers’ Campsite

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649532,"My tent was on a sideways slant last night so I didn’t sleep well. Every time I turned on my right side, I collided with my pack. Lesson learned, until next time. I started my hike at 6:30 and got to Pen Mar Park at 11:30. It was hotter today with clear skies and there were a couple of good climbs with lots of rocks.  Amazing how my memory conveniently edits out the bad stuff!  
When I got to Pen Mar Park, everything was locked up and the water fountains were off. The only accommodation was a Portapotty. Oscar D. Grouch gave me some of her water, since she had a shuttle driver waiting for her. Curious George and his wife Stephanie came about 1:00 and we had a nice visit. They live in Warrenton, VA and were up visiting their son at Penn State so their being here to shuttle me is more a trail miracle than trail magic. 
The Cobblestone Hotel is every bit as nice as I remember it from 2018, and they let me check in early. I changed into my rain gear, gathered my dirty smelly clothes and started the washing machine. While that was going, I dealt with myself, watching the dirt swirl down the bathtub drain. I realized that I got a little too much sun today and really ought to rely on sun screen instead of dirt. I arranged a shuttle at 8:00 tomorrow morning (breakfast starts at 6:00).  Roger also shuttled us in 2018. Then I inventoried my leftover food and planned out the next leg of my hike, to Boiling Springs. I’ve made the decision not to push mileage this week. My body is doing well but some special care and feeding would be appreciated by Brother Ass, my body, until he becomes accustomed to the serial abuse that long distance hiking is.  I made a reservation for Friday night at Red Cardinal B&B, so there is no temptation to go further each day. The $80 hiker rate includes shuttle to and from Boiling Springs and breakfast. Laundry is an additional $5. Such a deal!
When my clothes had dried, I walked over to the Walmart and bought food and then, finally went to Applebees. I hadn’t eaten much today, and I fear that I drooled on the menu before settling on a Caesar salad, a bacon cheeseburger, onion rings and a draft Yeungling.  So good and just the right amount to leave me groaning. 
Now I just have to strip the packaging from the food I bought and get my pack ready for tomorrow. I will reward myself with a nice Bourbon at the little bar downstairs before drifting into a food-induced coma. 
The first leg of my hike, from Harpers Ferry to Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, is now complete. A little evaluation is in order. Physically, I am pleased. I’m not ready to skip up the steep rocky ups yet, but my knees seem fine and my endurance is good, remembering that I am 71. Thank you Jack the physical therapist. Mentally and spiritually, I’m happy. I’m meeting nice people and perhaps we will coalesce into a tramily or at least enjoy each other’s company when we meet. Two other thru-hikers are here individually, Sightseer and Cosmo. Sightseer pulled a muscle and will take a zero day here tomorrow. I invited Cosmo to share my shuttle back to Pen Mar Park.  My gear is performing well. I’ve worn every bit of the clothing I brought except my gloves, but there will be a morning this week down close to freezing, so perhaps I’ll wear those. The only failure is my camp shoes, the Mayfly sandals weighing two ounces for the pair. They are adequate for nighttime pee runs, but nothing else. On the other hand, the Altria shoes are so comfortable that last night I forgot to take them off until bedtime.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

How do you transform scrambled eggs into urethane spray insulation?  And the small biscuits were like baby hockey pucks. Other than breakfast, Cobblestone was a grand experience. Roger was on time. Cosmo shared the shuttle. We started hiking at 8:30 and in spite of two snack breaks and a lunch break at Old Forge Park, we were here before 1:00. The trail was lovely today and the temperature moderate. If I hadn’t made a reservation in Boiling Springs for Friday, I would have hiked on. So my plan is working. By having the reservation, there is no reason to hike on, and I’ll have an easy week for my body to adjust to life on the trail. 
The trail was blissfully uncrowded today, mostly with flip flop thru-hikers and section hikers. Tumbling Run is a twin shelter and I’m sharing a side with Updog from Alexandria, VA. Cosmo hiked on, but I expect to see him again.  I’m sheltering tonight because rain is expected. 
My tragedy today is that my 16 oz Lexan bottle and the titanium mug it fit perfectly in must have popped out of my pack’s side pocket somewhere during today’s hike.

Actually the second fall was secondary to twisting my ankle. It’s a little sore but will be fine tomorrow. I started about 7 this morning and pushed a little, stopping only once for a snack, because rain was forecast. I got to Quarry Gap about 12:30, ten minutes before the rain did. That’s a strange feeling. I felt good for me but sad for those behind. Ness (Necessary Evil) came in followed by Updog.  Ness is a retired grade school librarian. Updog is a retired telecommunications attorney. Quarry Gap is another twin shelter, but one of them has been crushed by a falling tree. Ness and I are in the surviving one and there’s room for one, maybe two more. There are also covered picnic tables that could be slept on as well as tent platforms and a group tenting site. 
The rain should stop early this evening and the next couple of days should be colder with nights as low as 29*. That’s at the limit I planned on!  If my ankle allows, I’ll try doing 17.2 tomorrow and get to the Ironmaster’s Mansion and be indoors!","Tumbling Run Shelter

It will be even colder tonight, upper 20’s. I was up early, leaving about 6:30. Unfortunately this meant that I missed an angelic visitation complete with cases of Hostess pastries. I didn’t hear about it until Óscar D. Grouch caught up to me at Birch Run Shelter. She brought me one, something chocolate covered with chocolate pastry and “crème” filling. So awful and so good!  Óscar is not really a grouch!  
The trail today was lovely, much of it following old woods roads. I suspect that many of them were used to bring charcoal to the iron furnaces. I saw two 16’ diameter depressions that were probably charcoal ricks. It makes much more sense to carry charcoal in than to bring in wood and process it centrally. Whatever they were, they made the day very pleasant. Even with my sore ankle from yesterday, the distance was not a problem. I wore long underwear under shorts and under my down puffy with fleece hat and gloves to start. I didn’t stow the puffy until after lunch!  
The only people on the trail today were a few GA to ME thru-hikers running past, flip-floppers like me and a few long distance section hikers. There’s starting to be a real community developing. I hesitate to call it a tramily yet. Ness and I are hanging together and plan tomorrow at Alex Kennedy Shelter, 15.3 miles, stopping at the Green Mountain Store for lunch and maybe a carry out dinner. From Kennedy it’s under 4 miles into Boiling Springs so we will probably race in for breakfast on Friday, do our chores, and call the B&B for a pickup in the afternoon.

The innkeeper finally showed up about 7:30 with frozen pizza. It had self-rising crust and cheese topping and would have paired perfectly with Ripple. I should have eaten noodles and tuna from my canister. The breakfast pancakes were an equal delight, reminiscent of Elly Mae Clampett or Lisa Douglas’s.

One Match, acclaimed for his fire making acumen, proved it once again and even arranged for the wind to blow away from the shelter.  I truly appreciate the warmth!  And I’m thankful for Ness staying with me this afternoon and during my fall!","Ironmaster’s Mansion

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649860,"In planning for my hike I considered it possible but unlikely to have freezing temperatures. Last night got down to about 28*. Unfortunately, One Match did not stay awake all night to feed the campfire. I wore socks, long underwear top and bottom, down puffy and fleece hat inside my 35* sleeping bag. By morning, I had it mummied down to about a 2” diameter circle over my mouth and nose. I wasn’t quite shivering, but close. I woke up about 5 having to pee but climbed back into me sleeping bag for another hour or so. One Match and Ness did the same. I nibbled on an energy bar and quickly took off. Ness caught me on the second and final up before the gentle descent to the farm fields surrounding Boiling Springs. By 9:45 we were seated in the Cafe 101 enjoying a real breakfast. I had a perfect Greek omelet loaded with spinach, mushrooms and Feta, with home fries and delicious coffee. Ness had a Mexican skillet. At the outfitter, I replaced my lost mug and bought a couple of Cliff Bars, all that I need with the food I still have. 
ATC and the National Park Service had a regional office in Boiling Springs, but space constraints led to their moving into Carliyse.  The town now owns it and will be opening a visitors’ center. For now, it’s closed but there is a covered patio with a picnic table available for hikers and trash cans. 
We are staying at the Red Cardinal Bed & Breakfast, in a private home a couple of miles outside Boiling Springs, offering two rooms. The hosts are gracious and the special hiker rate of $80 includes shuttles to Boiling Springs and a huge country breakfast featuring eggs from their own hens. Laundry is $5 per load. Ness and I split a load. The old part of the house dates to the 1850’s. J.E.B. Stuart’s passed through the property on the way in Gettysburg.  I recommend the Red Cardinal thoroughly!  
I’m very grateful for the stay here. I’m beat up from the miles yesterday and the day before not to mention yesterday’s fall. Tomorrow will be a relatively easy day, just 8 miles up the Cumberland Valley and near level!","Alec Kennedy Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649972,"Our B&B hosts Joanna and Bill filled us in on many of the details of their lives last night and before a delicious breakfast this morning — broccoli & cheese omelet, ham slices, fresh fruit, and slices of Bundt cake. Then Bill drove us back to Boiling Springs. We started about 9:15 and reached the Quality Inn 1/2 mile off the trail at 12:15. The trail through the Cumberland Valley has a very narrow corridor and is level or very slightly uphill for miles, often walking along the borders or through farmers’ fields. Uneventful would be an overstatement. The greatest excitement was climbing over stiles like the one pictured to get over fencing. 
After lunch at the Middlesex Diner next to the motel, Ness and I spent the afternoon talking and planning our hike through the rest of Pennsylvania. On Monday, we’ll be at the Doyle Hotel in Duncannon. I am looking forward to seeing the remodeling that the new owners have started. Considering the filthy firetrap the place was two owners ago when I first stayed there in 1998, it sounds like major improvements, like in suite bathrooms!  They have reopened the restaurant and hope to get their liquor license next week, probably too late for us. I would love to see this historic Anheuser-Busch Hotel restored to its glory in the city once called the Jewel of the Susquehanna. We still have uncertainly about a schedule from Port Clinton to Delaware Gap. There are a lot of questions about the water situation and available services (if any)!","Boiling Springs

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650018,"Breakfast at the Quality Inn was understated, a choice of generic Cheerios or Fruit Loops, a few oranges, a few mini-yogurts and do-it-yourself waffles. The attendant tried explaining that we should wait until Monday, that they put new food out then. We think he says that every day. Anyway, here I am crossing a field at the start of today’s hike. If I look grumpy, it’s because I’m hungry. There were a few steep ups today. A little after noon, it started to rain lightly and it was cool enough for my rain jacket to feel good. Simultaneously, the trail became very rocky, a foretaste of Rocksylvania to come. We got to the shelter and so far have it to ourselves. It’s only a bit more than four miles, all downhill, to Duncannon. Sensible people would push on, propelled by visions of pizza and beer. The spring here is a couple hundred yards steeply downhill. Now that I’ve gotten my water, I’ve changed into long underwear and dry socks, puffy and fleece hat. After eating the rest of my snacks for today, I’m in my sleeping bag trying to warm up before cooking dinner, a Knoor’s rice side and a pouch of either chicken or salmon.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650103,"I decided to post a photo of last night’s shelter because it was such an unusual night. A 28-year old guy Mush with his ever faithful and most friendly trail dog Hoid came into the shelter as Ness and I were eating dinner. Mush is an attorney who practiced in the area of employee benefits in Washington, DC and suffered the breakup of a long term relationship. What better time to hike the trail?He is also Flip-Flopper, having started in Glasgow, VA.  A little later Li’l Bit came in, a good looking guy doing prodigious daily distances and avoiding time in towns because of severe budget constraints.  He wanted little more than to scarf down his dinner and go to bed. 
There was abundant sign at the shelter of porcupine activity and it looks like a running battle between the beast and the maintainer. The maintaining club has removed the shelter steps to try to keep Porky out and covered the edges of boards with aluminum to little effect. Gnaw marks are everywhere a sweaty human might touch. There were two opposing bunks in the shelter with clear floor space in between. With four of us, we each had a bunk. It rained off and on during the night making it feel chillier than it was, but I slept well until we were visited by the Phantom Porcupine. 
It sounded like he was on the roof gnawing through the metal roof. The sound ricocheted through the shelter. I could hear each gnaw and felt like a tooth enduring a root canal. I was glad to be in a lower bunk because I kept expecting the porcupine to crash through the roof onto Lil’ Bit above me.  Lil’ Bit was banging on the roof to no effect, but eventually the toothsome beast let off.  Only to return a bit later (I didn’t check the time) more determined than ever to devour us all or shish kabob us on quills. Finally brave Ness left his warm quilt, grabbed a rock, and beaned the beast.  The porcupine retreated but sent in reinforcements, namely a whippoorwill who proceeded to serenade us for goodness knows how long. I preferred the bird to the porcupine, but both were infinitely annoying. 
The trail from the shelter to Duncannon is predominately downhill, often steeply with irregular rock steps. My knees do not appreciate such things. It was a bit over 9:00 when we reached the parking area. A gentleman offered us soft drinks, but we both declined. Goodies Restaurant, the usual breakfast place, is closed on Mondays, but the Doyle Hotel is now serving three meals a day. Breakfast was excellent, especially the generous fresh fruit compote. Even though it was quite early, the owner Don gave us a tour and got us settled in rooms. Ness was not happy with the rather thin mattress in his and switched to another room. Mine was lovely. 
To appreciate the work that Don and family have done in starting the restoration of the Doyle, you will need to have visited the hotel under prior owners. The immediate past owners, Pat and Vicky, did a tremendous amount of improvements but the plumbing, electrical and general cleanliness left much to be desired. Even so it wasn’t the hellhole it was when I first visited in 1998 and resorted to spreading a ground cloth on the bed and squatting in the tub. The Doyle is still a work in progress, but my room is freshly painted, the windows have been replaced, and the mattress is new and most comfortable. DeDe the housekeeper is a dear!  
We visited Kind of Outdoorsy, an outfitter and hostel new since I was here last. There was almost enough hiker food for a complete resupply and I purchased a new small gas canister.  After Ness and I did laundry (the laundromat is several doors down), Christine from the Doyle gave us a ride to the grocery and waited while we shopped. Christine asked how long we had been hiking together and Ness explained that we just started that a few days ago but enjoy kidding each other to pass the time. I said that I was the straight man, which for some reason brought laughter. Am I that obvious? 
Next is an early dinner at Sorrentos to cap a delightful day.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650173,"After a good breakfast at Goodies, Ness and I checked out of the Doyle and started the hike with a walk through Duncannon on High Street and then on bridges across the Juniata River and the Susquehanna River. Then the trail gradually ascends to the ridge, which was very rocky and bouldery (is that a word?) at times. Ness and I separated a while today because I’m much slower on rock and crossed signals on break time.  Ness went into Clark’s Ferry Shelter and I continued on until I came to a suitable fallen tree. He actually backtracked a little looking for my broken and bloody body. Not finding it, he quickly caught me. We had a late lunch in the parking area at the highway overpass which used not to be there. It was a most dangerous at-grade crossing when I first came to it in 1998. It’s a busy highway to Harrisburg with blind hairpin curves. In a thunderstorm it was treacherous and I was nearly hit. Having a bypass is a wonderful luxury. The shelter is a pleasant three miles from there. 
Peter’s Mountain Shelter is a lovely two story shelter. The only drawback is the water spring that is steeply down 300 rock steps. It would hurt my knees mightily. Saint Ness fetched for both of us. He counted 588 left-right steps. I owe him big time now!  
There’s a nice group here and a great Australian Shepherd, Scout, who has befriended me in exchange for part of my fig bar and beef jerky.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650475,"This is a very difficult entry to write, and I've delayed for three days.  My apologies to those who have been following me.I slept well last night in the loft of Peters Mountain Shelter, getting up once to pee.  The dog Scout didn't even react to my coming down the ladder and leaving the shelter.  We have an understanding.  It rained a good bit last night and even a few thunderstorms rumbled through.  While I was eating my usual breakfast of precooked bacon rolled up in a flour tortilla, another shower came through.  I started walking alone this morning since Ness was still eating and interviewing.  I wore my rain jacket for the first couple of hours but there were no downpours, just occasional light showers, and it was cool enough to be quite comfortable.  I started off hiking comfortably and before long caught up to the Two Sisters who had come in later last night, when I was already in my sleeping bag.  As the morning wore on, my legs and knees were getting progressively more uncomfortable and balky.  Even though there weren't many areas of large rocks, there were lots of little ankle-twisty rocks embedded in the trail and a lot of little step-ups and step-downs.  The cumulative impact of the past two weeks started to tell and my speed decreased considerably, from 2-1/2 or 3 miles per hour down to 1 mile per hour.  It felt a lot like last August in Virginia.  It wasn't especially painful, but my legs just didn't want to cooperate.  Extending and curling my lower legs wasn't happening with any rapidity.  It was bilateral so unlikely to have been caused by any trauma other than the repeated stress of just doing what a hiker does, walking while carrying a load on uneven terrain.  This was supposed to be an 18-mile day, necessitated by the spacing of the shelters and the availability of water.  There was no way that my legs were going to do that.  I thought about it a lot and even prayed about it. After last August's aborted thru-hike, I returned to the physical therapist who had guided me through my two knee replacements.  He designed a rigorous training program and I kept with it, even through winter, so I felt like I've given it my best effort.  Last fall, I thought it was just a matter of training, building up tissue tolerance, and regaining my muscle memory.  Now I know that it is more than that. The reality is that the combination of the knee replacements with my age of 71 is that I simply cannot do what I used to do and what I want to do.  Some people can, but I can't.  It's not a matter of desire or mind over matter but of coming up against physical limitations and having no choice but to deal with them.  I've never been very graceful, and I don't expect to deal with aging gracefully.  I'll do it my usual clumsy, bumbling way, perhaps even in emulation of my first childhood hero, Sugarfoot, TV's first anti-hero, who somehow in spite of knowing even less than a tenderfoot always managed to get his man by the end of each episode.  Did I make the decision to leave the trail or was the decision made for me?  I don't know, but as I walked on, I felt very unsettled and shed some tears for the inevitable.  I've grown fond of Ness and greatly valued his friendship and compassion.  We had planned to go into Pine Grove on Friday, May 6 and had reservations at the Comfort Inn.  We planned a zero day at an airbnb in Hamburg a few days later.  He passed me earlier this morning before I made my decision so there wasn't even a proper goodbye.  I knew I was coming up to a major trailhead parking area at PA 325 and pretty well decided that I would end my hike there if there was a way to get to someplace with transportation.  As it turned out, there was a couple offering trail magic of soft drinks, water, and snacks in the parking area.  They suggested that I call Trail Angel Mary in Duncannon, who is very well known on the trail.  She answered her phone but wasn't shuttling that day but referred me to her friend Maureen who picked me up in about 30 minutes and drove me to Harrisburg.  I hoped to return home via Amtrak but the schedule wouldn't cooperate so I used Delta Skymiles and booked a flight for the next day.  I'll end this entry sitting in an airport hotel, regretting a lousy burger and salad at the hotel restaurant, although the draft IPA was good, and in general feeling sorry for myself.","Peter’s Mountain Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651076,"Fifty plus year ago, I studied quantum mechanics and worked through the wave equations, using linear partial differential equations and something that sounds very romantic, eigenvalues.  I struggled with the paradox of quantum superposition as illustrated by Erwin Schrödinger’s Cat who was simultaneously both dead and alive.   I eventually surrendered what I had come to think of as my rational view of the universe and immersed myself in the beauty of the equations themselves.  They became my reality.  Seventeen years later, I faced the same situation in a graduate course in microeconomics required for my masters in accountancy.  I could have taken a descriptive service course intended for accountancy students, but I mistakingly signed up for the section intended for economics graduate students because it better fit my schedule.  When I found out, I was too proud to change and once again chased the white rabbit down into the wonderland of matrix algebra and partial differential equations.  Instead of descriptive two goods models, I dealt with n-goods in n-dimensional space.  I earned my A and was rewarded with a new way of viewing reality that was quite fantastical and impossible to imagine.
And now, thirty years later, I find myself in the same situation again, not knowing if my hike is alive or dead.  It is simultaneously both, and I won’t know which until I open my hike box in late August, and even then, I won’t know for a matter of weeks, because even a dead hiker bounces, to add a little finance to my mélange of physics and economics.    
It’s coming on two weeks since I left the trail in Pennsylvania and returned home.  Walking still isn’t without discomfort and my trail abrasions and contusions are still evident to some degree.  I’m still in recovery mode and don’t feel hike-worthy yet.  Yet is such a lovely word, pregnant with hope.  And I do have hope that my hike is merely suspended.
I appreciate all of the guest book comments from friends and followers and private communications that I’ve received.  Most were along the lines of a valiant effort, well played, and the sad necessity of playing the cards one is dealt.  At least I didn’t hear from survivors of the Bataan Death March, that stopping meant certain death from their captors, so I should have continued the hike on my hands and knees if necessary.  Actually with knee replacements, crawling would have infinitely more painful that walking at a snail’s pace.  But leaving aside the well wishes, how am I feeling?  Defeated, for not having met my goals.  Sad, for missing my trail friends, Ness in particular.  Relieved, for being spared the step-by-step torture that hiking had become.  Happiness, for being home with Tom.  I’m not rapidly cycling among emotional states but rather feeling all of these things and more simultaneously in superposition.
I had done everything my physical therapist Jack had suggested, and it still didn’t work.  So I thought it only fair to let him know. In an email, I started by praising Jack, because his method of building up tissue tolerance by walking longer distances on consecutive days had worked well.  Distance wasn’t the problem.  Impact was.  So I put a question to him, asking if it were possible to build up tolerance to high-impact hiking.  I expected a sympathetic response reminding me that life has limits and I’m not getting younger.  Instead Jack started his response with, “Absolutely you can get back to high impact hiking,” and proceeded to outline a training program not dissimilar to what I had been doing but incrementally adding impact.  He explained that “There isn’t a whole lot of evidence suggesting that high impact things are bad for joint replacements so most surgeons just say not to do them and err on the side of caution.”  I certainly had been indoctrinated into believing that impact was bad and all of the standard patient resources say so.  So in my post-implant training, I avoided high impact like excessive step-ups and step-downs and certainly jump-downs.  
I just spent some time online and found a literature review, Return to sport after total or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, by Louis Dagneaux, Julien Bourlez, Benjamin Degeorge and François Canovas [EFORT Open Rev 2017;2:496–501. DOI: 10.1302/2058-5241.2.170037]  The reviewed studies include all of the usual caveats, dividing sports into three baskets:  authorized recommended low-impact activities like walking and gardening,  authorized sports with experience like road biking, hiking and skiing, and unauthorized sports like football, basketball, jogging and bouldering.  The studies recommend that “High-intensity sports must be advised against,” but the authors add, “although evidence of increased injury risks or mechanical complications (early damage, unsealing, periprosthetic fracture) is lacking.”  In their discussion, the authors summarize as follows:
""Few studies have focused on return to sport after knee arthroplasty. Surgeons have long advocated for the restriction and even the prohibition of certain sports activities without having scientific proof of the effect of sports on implant survival rate. To our knowledge, previous studies investigating the link between physical activity and wear are mostly experimental. These results were not found in clinical practice because series from the literature did not have sufficient hindsight to draw conclusions.  Prosthesis survival rate – for either UKA or TKA – is currently 95%, greater than it was ten years ago, but has not been specifically evaluated in very active patients practising sport at a high intensity rate.""
I could walk over to the medical library at the University of Vermont Medical Center and probably find more recent articles, but it’s raining out, so I’ll stop here, concluding that Jack’s optimism is not unreasonable.  
i have resumed my morning walks and started incorporating short jogging intervals.  The higher impact from jogging quickly caused my knees to protest and to duplicate the pain I had on my last day on the trail, but to a lesser extent.  This is wonderful!  I’m not saying this as a masochist but because it provides me with a simple means of creating the situation to which I must develop tolerance.  Think of it as allergy shots, where injecting increasing amounts of specific allergens enables the body to develop immunity or tolerance to the allergen.  It’s a rough analogy but you understand my point.  By gradually incorporating jogging into my walking discipline, my knees will adapt just as they have for distance walking.  That’s the hope anyway.  At Jack’s suggestion, I have also added lateral step-downs to my daily routine and will gradually increase the height.  Eventually, I’ll add kettlebell weights and even start jump-downs.  After mud season and when black fly season ends in mid-June, I’ll start some gnarly trail hiking as well.  The Burrows Trail up Camels Hump  is severely eroded, mostly uneven rocky treadway with frequent step-ups and downs.  In other words, it is much like the Appalachian Trail in Pennsylvania, except that it gains about 2,400 feet of elevation in 2.6 miles and rewards the hiker with the second largest alpine zone in Vermont.  There are few rewards in Pennsylvania!  The Green Mountain Club is currently fundraising and hopes to rehabilitate the Burrows Trail in 2023, but its present decrepit condition is ideal for my purposes.  If I can develop tolerance to hiking it on consecutive days, I will be ready to face the AT again.
I have reverted to pre-hike status on Trail Journals and will post entries occasionally as my rehabilitation progresses.  I hesitate to say “my plan,” but my hope or my delusion is to return to Harpers Ferry in late August and hike south to Georgia and then do the northbound portion starting next April, so that I complete the entire AT within a 12-month period.  
My next entry will review the successes and failures of the gear I used so far this year.  I’ve started a list of replacements needed, but I won’t purchase anything until I have greater confidence that Schrödinger’s hiker is alive.",,View Entry,"May 15, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651451,"Two weeks and two days since I came off the trail, I feel hikeable again.  I walked eight miles this morning in just over two hours without any particular soreness other than my right ankle which is still recovering from a mild sprain.  I’ll be kind to it for another week and then step up my impact training.  I thought about returning to Pennsylvania in a week or so, but I was overtaken with an unusual spell of rational thought.  There’s no reason to think that without additional training that I would be able to handle the rocks.  So I will train and wait until August.  I don’t think I could handle another failure!
When I left Harpers Ferry a month ago, my gear less consumables, what I consider my base weight, was 15 pounds, 0.6 ounces, just a tidge over my target of 15 pounds.   Leaving town with four days of food and 1.5 liters of water, my total pack weight was 23 pounds.  Pack weight was not a problem and with very few exceptions, I was happy with my choices.  Assuming that my rehab is successful and I return to the trail, these are the changes I will make:
Camp Shoes
The Mayfly Imago 2 sandals weighed 2 ounces for the pair and were very colorful, but even at zero ounces, they would not have been worth their weight.  They wouldn’t stay on my feet in other than ideal conditions, which is to say none of the time in camp.  I quickly tossed them and reverted to leaving my hiking shoes on until bedtime and using my hiking shoes if I needed to pee at night.  That worked, but I found I missed having camp shoes that allowed my tootsies to air out in camp and to use in town.  Crocs are probably the most common camp shoes, but they don’t work on my feet. For years, I happily used a pair of Vivobarefoot Ultra that, with the tongue and footbed removed, weighed 7.3 ounces, but they are completely worn out and, of course, no longer made.  I have a pair of Xero Z-Trail EV sandals that seem fairly comfortable and weigh in at 9.4 ounces.  
Weight Increase 7.4 ounces. 
Hydration
I was very happy using a one-liter Platypus hoser kept in a side pocket of my pack as my primary water source during the day, but had one little problem that will cause me to replace it.  After I lost my 16 oz Nalgene bottle, I took to using the Platypus at night and once rolled over onto the bite valve, causing a minor flood. The Platypus Big Zip EVO includes a  shut-off valve, but the smallest size is 1.5 liters.  The top-filling design will make filtering into it easier.
Weight increase 3.1 ounces
Somewhere in Maryland, my 8 oz titanium mug with16 0z Nalgene bottle that fit perfectly inside of it popped out of a side pocket of my pack.  I used the mug only as a water scoop and will replace it with a Hydrapak SpeedCup for a weight decrease of 1.5 ounces.  I used the Nalgene bottle to mix Carnation Essentials in the morning and for Nuun’s electrolyte tablets.  Replacing it with a Hydrapak Stow 500 ml flexible bottle will save 1.5 ounces.
Weight Decrease 3.0 ounces
Cookset
I was very happy the Gossamer Gear Warm Sak pot cozy.  Simmering a Knorrs dinner, either noodles or rice, for just a couple of minutes and then transferring it into the cozy for ten minutes worked very well.  What didn’t was moving the nearly full pot using the GSI Outdoors MicroGripper.  Replacing it with a MSR LiteLifter will cost me 0.6 ounces but add much needed security, preventing a possible burn or, worse, a lost dinner.
Weight Increase 0.6 ounces
Eyeglasses
My reading glasses were essential, but I never used my distance glasses.  I don’t need them legally for driving and in spite of good intentions, I never got up at night for stargazing.
Weight Decrease 0.7 ounces
Clothing
I wore all of the clothing I brought with the exception of the ZPacks over mitts, but they would be worth the 1.0 ounce weight in the event of freezing rain.  I had brought a second wicking t-shirt to use as a town shirt, but found that it wasn’t necessary (weight decrease 2.9 ounces).  While I used my fleece cap as a sleep cap and on colder mornings, I could have just as easily used my Buff.  Leaving the fleece cap home will save 1.1 ounces.
I was happy with long underwear bottoms under shorts on colder mornings, and could have added rain pants if I were still cold.  On the other hand, I found that there were plenty of morning when a t-shirt and the Montbell Zipper long-underwear top was not enough but adding my puffy was too much.  Substituting my Montbell Cool Hoody (pictured in my photo) for the long underwear top would add 1.7 ounces and a lot of versatility.  And I like the garnet color.
Weight Decrease 2.3 ounces
Repair Kit
 While I loved the combination of the Altra Olympus 4 hiking shoes and the SuperFeet Trailblazer Comfort insoles, the toe caps separated from the uppers on the shoes.  The problem was easily solved with a tube of Krazy Glue weighting 0.1 ounce.
Weight Increase 0.1 ounce
__________________________
Net Weight Increase  5.2 ounces
I could easily compensate for this increase, plus my starting overage of 0.6 ounce, by leaving three things home:
     Electric toothbrush & recharging cable            3.2 ounces 
     Apple AirPods in charging case                        1.9 ounces
     Baby Rocky Raccoon                                       0.7 ounces
Net Weight Decrease 5.9 ounces
But I won’t.  I’ve had recurrent gum problems over the years and consider 3.2 ounces a reasonable price to pay to maintain my dental hygiene routine.  I didn’t use the AirPods often, but sometimes a little music is essential for my mental well-being.  The raccoon, knit by my cousin Rocky Raccoon, is a talisman, although I must admit that it hasn’t brought me great luck so far.  
Of course, I could easily offset the added weight and then some by leaving my bear canister home.  When I started carrying it five years ago, I was ridiculed to some degree.  This year the major objection I heard was that it was unnecessary, since every shelter, at least from Harpers Ferry to Peters Mountain, had a bear pole, a bear box, or both.  I found that very frustrating, as though the maintaining clubs in their efforts to protect hikers from bears were discouraging a superior solution — hikers carrying canisters.  Bear canisters are only required for camping in one five-mile section of the trail in Georgia but are highly recommended by ATC and by various National Forests.  Bear Canister lending programs have been established by the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club and the Green Mountain Club in Vermont in cooperation with ATC using canisters donated by BearVault.   I would personally like to see those programs expanded trail-wide and bear boxes, poles, and cables removed.  My own experience in trying a canister is that I’ll never go back to bear bagging my food.   A bear canister is so much easier, more secure, and a ready stool.   I doubt that canisters will ever be made mandatory, since there is no effective way of enforcing such a rule along the AT.  And there will always be those who say that they have always slept with their food and never had a problem.  I hope their luck continues.
So how will I compensate for the additional 5 ounces I plan to carry?  Not a problem.  I found that on each section of this last hike, I carried too much food.  Two energy bars less will do it!",,View Entry,"May 20, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652233,"My impact training is progressing, and I’m starting to believe that it’s possible for me to return to “normal” hiking again.  Normal!  That’s quite a concept.  As one who has spent his life as an outlier, more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean of a standard bell curve, I laugh.  Why would I aspire to normal when I can be so much more?  I’m enjoying a brilliant first novel now, Seating Arrangements, by Maggie Shipstead (2012), having just read her latest novel, Great Circle (2021).  If you’ve ever felt a tinge of envy toward traditional WASP society, Seating Arrangements is bound to cure you.  Walking without pain gives me all kinds of time to think about such things, and yesterday was one of those blessed times.  It reminds me of the true reason I find hiking so enjoyable, that when everything is working, my mind is free to float away and explore new lands.  I only went eight miles yesterday, with several intervals of jogging, and about a mile in the woods.  The stone stairs and rock ledges in Rock Point were not a problem, and I even braved a few jump downs.  There was only one little problem, but when tiny irritants aggregate into dense clouds of mosquitoes lusting for my blood, they are enough to restore me to mindfulness and drive me out of the woods.  I’ll bring Picaridin or DEET next time and possibly a head net. 
I have gotten comfortable with step downs and stairs, so I’ve added static lunges to my routine.  I can’t get my knees all the way down to the floor yet, but that will happen.  Then I’ll add weight.  Left to their own devices, my knees will take charge and limit my activities.  My plan is to both lengthen my walks and intensify my strength routines and so keep my knees servile and obedient.  When I return to hiking, I want my knees to rejoice at the relative ease.  Okay, it’s a fantasy, but i’m allowed.   
Last week, I placed the odds of my returning to the trail in August as “more likely than not.”  That’s a term of art from my pre-retirement CPA days, referring to a 50% confidence level in written tax advice.  I need to get up to the level of “should,” meaning that I believe there is a 70-75% that my hike will be successful before I fully commit.  Nonetheless, I have started to plan.
I have revised my hiking schedule for the southern half of the trail.   My moderate schedule is more like the slow schedule of my previous version, at least for the first few weeks.  Assuming that Amtrak is successful in extending the Ethan Allen Express to Burlington in July, I will take it to Schenectady on Saturday, August 13 and visit with Rocky Raccoon and her partner Rick, enjoying a feast at Canali’s Restaurant, celebrating their 75th year of traditional Italian food.  Then on August 14, Rocky and I will train from Albany to Harpers Ferry.  I snuck into and out of Harpers Ferry last time, so this time I’ll spend Monday visiting with friends and touring the National Park Service exhibits in the National Historic Park.  Then on Tuesday, we will start our hike.",,View Entry,"May 31, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653245,"I am ready for the challenge of resuming my thru-hike!  I still have occasional not-so-good days when my knees ache, but I have many more days when my knees don’t express anything and seem willing to bear whatever distance and terrain I throw at them. They may be just suckering me in, getting me to commit to hiking again, only to fail me again after two or three weeks. I won’t know until I try. I’ve been diligent in exercising since returning home in May, walking 8-10 miles most days including up and down hills and on uneven trail and doing strength training, with a special focus on my quad muscles and all the tissues that stabilize my knees.  I feel ready, but I do harbor doubts. Sometimes I think of my knees as a vindictive cat, offering me the great honor of rubbing her belly, all the while intending to scratch the hell out of my arm with all four stiletto-tipped paws.  For the moment at least, I’m taking my knees at face value and trusting them to see me through.
I purchased Amtrak tickets yesterday for Albany NY to Harpers Ferry, WV for August 14 and made reservations at the Quality Inn in Harpers Ferry. Amtrak has announced that the Ethan Allen Express will start daily service from Burlington to New York City on July 29, but isn’t selling tickets yet, first needing to assign three-letter codes to the three new stations. It’s only been a 69-year hiatus for regular passenger service here!  The station is at the bottom of the hill I live on so will be very convenient. I’ll purchase a ticket to Schenectady on August 13 when they become available.  My cousin Rocky Raccoon is raring to go!
Those of you who have been following my star-crossed hike this year and might be wondering what happened to my trail friend Ness, whom I abandoned in Pennsylvania. I’ll pleased to report that I picked him up last Monday in Killington, Vermont and hosted him here for two zero days. He and Tom got along well.  It was wonderful cooking for someone afflicted with a thru-hiker’s appetite.  I returned him to Killington on Thursday morning, well-rested and well-fed.  Perhaps I’ll see him again when he returns to Rockfish Gap, the southern end of Shenandoah National Park, for the southbound portion of his hike.  At any rate, I expect we will be friends for many years.  
I registered my hike at ATCamp this morning and started ordering necessary replacement items, like a new pair of shoes.  I’m sticking with Altra Olympus 4 shoes with Superfeet Trailblazer Comfort insoles.",,View Entry,"Jun 19, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653827,"I hesitate to use the word “love” in connection with an inanimate object, not being a fetishist, and truth be told, there are very few people who I’ve awarded that accolade to, not that my love is such a rare and precious treasure.  But I would gladly cuddle with my Altra Olympus 4 hiking shoes with Superfeet Trailblazer Comfort insoles.  It goes without saying that a mere two days after receiving my replacement pair, I received notice that Altra has replaced them with the Olympus 5.  My feet are already in mourning, but love is a fickle thing, and I can already feel them getting curious about the new model.  They will have to wait until Damascus, Virginia. It is often said that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, but I find that my love blossoms lower down, at my feet that is.  
I wore the new shoes to Mt. Philo State Park this morning, for the first test of my impact-trained knees on real trail.  Mt. Philo was the first state park in Vermont, dating from 1924, and being a mere 16 miles south of Burlington, gets a lot of use.  The old carriage road to the summit was paved long ago, and there’s a popular campground and picnic area on the summit.  The views across Lake Champlain to the Adirondacks are superb.  The hiking trail to the summit is only about a mile long and gains 650’ in elevation.  The original trail had eroded into a quagmire at the lower elevations and a slip-and-slide mess toward the summit.  The popularity of the trail left the managers no choice but to harden it against erosion. It has been substantially reconstructed over the last two years, starting with House Rock Trail from the parking area to its intersection with the park road about half way up.  That’s mostly crib construction now, with 8” x 8” timbers forming a rectangular frame that is backfilled with rock and gravel.  The cribs can be stacked as stairs, and it’s ideal for poorly drained soils and moderate grades.  The steeper Summit Trail has been relocated and now relies upon stone steps, like the ones pictured above.  It’s not a primitive trail but I thought the stone treadway would be a good incremental challenge for my knees.  They passed with flying colors and I zipped up and down the trail without any discomfort, meeting several hikers and dogs along the way.  Yesterday, a momma bear and her two cubs graced the summit.  I saw a photo, but alas, they have wisely moved on.  I thought about hiking it twice, but the parking area was already crowded when I got back to it.  I’ll go earlier tomorrow morning (the Park officially opens at 8AM, but there is no gate) and try for two circuits.  Next week, I’ll turn my attention to the much more challenging Camels Hump!
The few things that I ordered have come with the exception of the Suluk46 Miksa Pot Lifter that has been slowed by having to cross an international border.  It is manufactured by Steve Evans in his garage in Toronto, Canada.  I opted for the large size weighing 0.39 ounces.  You can check it out at https://suluk46.com/product/miksa-pot-lifter/.  Is it worth $23.00 USD plus shipping?  The MSR PanHandler is comparable but weighs 1.0 ounce and costs $14.95.  I’ll let you know what I think in my next entry.  
I also bought some additional Compeed advanced blister cushions that work well for me.  Most hikers trust Leukotape, but it is made from natural latex, one of my allergies.  I bought a roll of latex-free 3M Nexcare absolute waterproof tape, and if I develop a hot spot or blister on my feet, I’ll try it.  I rolled a couple feet of the tape around a plastic tube.  Carrying two remedies almost assures that my feet will remain blister free.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654326,"This morning, I passed the final exam for my hike starting mid-August.  The trailhead for the Burrows Trail up Camels Hump is a 45 minute drive, and I started hiking at 7AM.  The parking area is about 3.5 miles up gravel Camels Hump Road at about 1,800’ elevation.  The trail intersects the Long Trail after 2.2 miles at 3,800’ at the start of the alpine zone.  From there it’s another 0.5 miles to the summit at 4,083’.  The Green Mountain Club has started rehabilitating the popular Burrows Trail but for the moment it remains a rocky, rooty, muddy mess.  The photo is of the middle section.  The upper section is rockier and the lower section is muddier.  My old hiking shoes are pretty worn out so I wore my new shoes.  I was glad for the increased traction.  The alpine zone this morning was kissed with cloud, so there were no views and it was chilly and windy enough that I delayed my snack break until I was back below tree line.  
I had hoped to hike up Camels Hump on consecutive days, but I realized this morning that the chance for a sprained ankle is just too great.  I had no problem this morning with nary a whimper from my legs and knees. I didn’t have to stop for huff-and-puff breaks.  I was back at my car in 3-1/2 hours, which is less than AllTrails estimate of 4 hours.  The only people who passed me were a couple of trail runners, still enjoying their youth and immortality.  More power to them!  
This morning went well enough that my confidence level for actually completing my AT hike this time is much increased, to the point that I am going to order a second pair of shoes and insoles for Tom to send to me in Damascus, Virginia.  
I received the new pot lifter this week and I think it will work fine.  I can easily lift my pot filled with water with good control and without getting my fingers wet, a problem with the GSI Outdoors MicroGripper I have been using — especially when the food is hot!
I’m still waiting for Amtrak to start selling tickets for the Ethan Allen Express which starts service from Burlington on July 29.  The present northern terminus is Rutland and Amtrak has adjusted the schedule from there for the extended route, but the three new stations in Middlebury, Vergennes, and Burlington are still not showing on the Amtrak website.  I emailed Amtrak customer service on July 4th and received a very polite acknowledgment, thanking me and letting me know that they respond to online inquires 7 days  a week between the hours of 8 am and 8 pm (ET), that emails are answered in the order that they are received, and that they will respond as soon as possible.  I would prefer that they be less polite and more efficient!",,View Entry,"Jul 08, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654600,"Yay! I’m now ticketed for the Amtrak Ethan Allen Express on August 13, from Burlington to Schenectady, NY.  Historic Union Station is one mile downhill from our condo.  I’m very excited to have train service here!  The Schenectady Amtrak station is convenient to Rocky Raccoon’s house.  She lives about 20 minutes west of there.  The train will take 4 hours, 23 minutes.  Driving time is about 3 hours, 10 minutes, with the possibility of an additional 30 minutes due to traffic congestion around the outlet stores at Queensbury, NY.  Given that I’m coming down on a Saturday, that is almost a certainty.  Plus, if we drove, Tom would be facing another 3 hours plus to get home that afternoon or the next day.  The regular fare is $51, which is about the cost for gasoline alone for the 300 mile round-trip drive.  The comfort of business class is easily worth another $23.  I know it is un-American, but I don’t like driving or even riding in a car, and I’m not all that fond of flying.  Trains, on the other hand, make me happy.  My knees are feeling great and now that I’ve purchased this final ticket, the hike feels real.  
It doesn’t seem to matter how many hikes I’ve done and whether it is a new trail to me or an old familiar friend like the AT, I always feel excitement build until I step away from the trailhead, the sounds of traffic fade, and I am surrounded by trees and at peace.  I suppose with all the hiking I’ve done and considering my ripe age, I should be blasé about starting another hike, but I’m not.  Many years ago, I tested a monastic vocation.  I thought my spiritual advisor Father Sid was addled because if asked how he found anything, whether the food in the refectory, the Gregorian plainsong in chapel, or even the weather, he always answered, “Best ever!”  Now that I’m about the age he was then, I find myself thinking the same way.  Perhaps, I am now the addled one.  At any rate, I look forward to this hike as the best ever!  
The gear I’ll be carrying will also be the best ever, until I tweak it and make it even better.  I recently compared the gear list for this August hike to the list for last April’s hike, and frankly I’m embarrassed by the number of changes.  I can’t justify it, but in keeping with a religious theme, can I claim that my gear is proceeding from glory to glory, from the best to even bestier?  
I’m not going to update the gear tab now.  I’ll do that after completing the southern half of my thru-hike when I start a new journal under 2023 for the northern half, but here are the changes I’ve made:
Clothes
I will carry my garnet Montbell CoolLite Hoody instead of the Montbell long-sleeve zipper top.  It’s a little bit warmer.  I’ll leave the fleece cap home since the Buff can substitute for one.  I used it mostly as a sleep cap anyway.  At some point, probably Damascus, I’ll want a fleece cap but I’ll look for one in fluorescent orange since deer hunting season will be starting. 
Pack Cover
The ULA pack has proven to be waterproof, but I’ll have an older fluorescent orange pack cover sent to me in Damascus, Virginia, to reduce the chance of being mistaken for a deer.
Hydration
I lost my titanium mug and 16-ounce Nalgene bottle in April.  I’ve replaced the bottle with a new 16-ounce Nalgene Sustain Water Bottle that is BPA/BPS-free.  I chose the Cerulean color to go with my pack.  Instead of a mug, I’m use the bottom of a SmartWater bottle.  I don’t drink coffee in the morning on a hike and was just using the mug as a water scoop.  I have nothing against coffee and will enjoy it in town, but I find trail coffee to be a wretched imitation of the real thing.  I can add instant coffee to Carnation Essentials if I really feel the need for caffeine.  
Cookset
I’ve substituted a Miska Pot Lifter for the GSI Outdoors Microgripper.  It’s the same weight but easier to use, with less risk of burning my fingers or spilling my dinner.
First Aid
I’m omitting the sheet of moleskin — it never stuck to my feet anyway — and am substituting 3M Nexcare latex-free waterproof padded tape.
Sandals
I will miss the bright colors of the Mayfly Imago 2 sandals but they were utterly useless.  I hope that Xero Z-Trail EV sandals will prove kinder to my feet, enough so as to justify the 9.4 ounces of weight.  If not, they will go home quickly.  
Shoes
I will be starting with Altra Olympus 4 shoes and switching to the replacement Olympus 5 model in Damascus.  In combination with Superfeet Trailblazer Comfort Insoles, I’ve never had greater comfort or traction.
Gaiters
My Dirty Girl gaiters have worn out and I’m replacing them with Altra gaiters that have Velcro patches on both sides at the heel, perfect for the “gaiter trap” that is built into the Altra shoes.  
Hip Belt Pockets
I’m omitting my distance glasses in a foam sleeve since I never used them in Spring and don’t legally need them to drive.  In accordance with current CDC guidance, I’m carrying a few KN95 face masks instead of a cloth mask.  I will wear one on the train.
Rocky Raccoon Talisman
I’ll have the real Rocky Raccoon, my cousin Debbie, at the start of this hike so I don’t need a stuffed one.  
As a result of these changes, my base weight, which I define as everything other than consumables, will be 15 pounds, 5 ounces, an increase of 4 ounces.  I’m compensating by carrying a smaller container of FootGlide and by omitting Flonase, which I only need during Spring tree pollen season.  My leaving town weight with 1 liter of water and 4 days of food remains 22 pounds, 8 ounces.  In another week, I’ll start carrying my fully loaded pack on my morning walks.",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Wed",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655212,"What a fine day this has already been!  I didn’t walk this morning; I floated.  I wore my fully-loaded pack four times this past week, so today I treated myself to just a small daypack with a bottle of water.  I must take advantage of slackpacking whenever possible on this upcoming hike!  I usually go to church on Sundays, but for a number of reasons including thunderstorms expected tomorrow morning, I opted to walk this morning instead.  
My favorite radio show, Harmonia, an early music show produced at the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University, is broadcast at 7AM on Sundays by Vermont Public.  Today’s theme was Chiaroscuro: Darkness to Light, starting with an intensely gloomy setting of Psalm 130, Out of the Depths. by Christoph Graupner (1683 - 1760), followed by the cheerful (not) In Darkness by John Dowland (1563 - 1626).    Nothing like wallowing in melancholia to put me in a joyous mood.  Musical schadenfreude?  Whenever I am feeling down, listening to Thomas Tallis’ Lamentations, written for Maundy Thursday between 1560 and 1569, cheers me right up.  
I took the path through the woods on my return route, knowing that I would pass by a patch of red raspberries.  I spent five minutes harvesting the ones that ripened since yesterday, leaving plenty to be gleaned by others.  Yum!  I ended at the Y at 8:00, when they open on Sunday, and naturally worked legs.  I find that I have to limit my walking to five miles if I’m going to do strength training afterwards.  Vermont Public broadcasts Sunday Baroque at 8AM, another favorite show.  And now you know: My sexuality is perhaps the least queer thing about me.  
Wearing my pack this past week gave me an opportunity to go through my gear once again and pick out my favorite new items.  First, must be the combination of the Altra Olympus shoes and SuperFeet Trailblazer Comfort insoles.  At the moment at least, I have all ten toe nails, having shed several from the last hike, and my soles and the the tips of my toes are nicely calloused.  The surprise new favorite for me is the Platypus 1.5 liter Big Zip EVO.  
I replaced my older Platypus Hoser after its drinking tube and bite valve managed to find its way under my sleeping pad in a shelter this spring, creating a minor flood.  The Big Zip Evo has a shut-off valve by the bite valve.  I was reluctant to try the top loading Big Zip, afraid it would leak, but when secured by the slidelock, it seems quite secure.  I haven’t tried driving over it, but I am convinced that tossing it into the back of a pickup truck would be fine.  The Hoser was a pain to filter into.  I had to hold it between my knees as I squeezed water from my dirty water bladder through the BeFree Filter.  It was very awkward.  I can filter directly into the Big Zip without removing it from my pack.  In addition, the quick release coupling means that I can easily remove the reservoir from the pack to fill at a potable source without having to unthread the hose through the straps of my pack.  I’ve really enjoyed it this past week!
Three weeks to go.  Most of my To Do items for this week relate to household chores I would like to complete before I leave, like restocking office supplies, sharpening kitchen knives, and replacing a lightbulb in a ceiling fixture.  There is one hike To Do item for this week that I always dread, trimming my pelt. This has been too nice of a day to ruin with that.  Maybe tomorrow or the tomorrow after that.",,View Entry,"Jul 24, Sun",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655757,"Old Men Dream Dreams; Young Men See Visions.I’m definitely in the former category.   I awoke Monday morning from a most pleasant dream.  I was a kid maybe eight years old, attending a summer camp for LGBTQIA (pause here for breath) youth.  There were classes in such things as how to throw a baseball and self-defense, skills I never learned.  All the bathrooms and showers were private spaces.  It goes without saying, but I’ll say it, that there were no such places in the 1950’s.  I lacked even words to describe my feelings and was left with a nameless fear, one I knew I must keep secret.  To attend such a camp, to have words to describe myself, to know that there were others like me!  What would that have been like?  How would my life have been changed?  I’ll never know.  
I don’t hike in rainbow colored clothes (not a single sequin) or sprinkle fairy dust in my wake, but I am open as a hiker.  When my wedding band prompts a question of how my wife feels about my being on the trail, I always respond that my husband is very supportive. Only once has that led to an angry, “I can’t stay in a shelter with a f#%*ing f*^#%t!”  as though my sexuality were contagious or that my cooties might attack his cooties in the middle of the night or that I would find his chest-thumping display even remotely attractive.   He packed up and hiked on.  Everyone is welcome on the Appalachian Trail.  If that bothers you, please stay home. 
Less than two weeks now!  My chores are down to last minute stuff like charging electronics and trimming nails. The only remaining purchase is a dark chocolate bar from a local artisanal chocolatier, Nu Chocolat. I don’t dare buy it much in advance. I’ve  been tapering off coffee and am down to one-half cup a day and will stop altogether this weekend.  Coffee will be a town treat.  
The Amtrak Ethan Allen Express started service from Burlington last Friday and has actually been running nearly on time.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655942,"The question has come up of why I’ve decided to start my hike from Harpers Ferry on August 16.  Don’t I know that it’s still summer?  Didn’t I live in the South long enough to remember the hot, humid, gnatty weather, the occasional severe thunderstorms and even tornadoes?  Yes on both counts.  
Mid-August is not the perfect time to be hiking in Virginia, but given my self-imposed constraints, it is optimal.  Here’s what I mean:

I want to leave early enough to be out of the Smokies before much chance of accumulating snow.
I want to be home early enough in November to have time to order my Thanksgiving turkey from a local farm and to prepare for the feast.
I don’t want to leave until after our anniversary on Tuesday the 9th.
The later the date, the better the chance that I can complete my thru-hike on Katahdin within 12 months of my start date.  My target will be complete the hike and be home for our anniversary.  If Tom meets me in Baxter State Park, I’ll have a few days longer.

I expect to reach Davenport Gap and enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in mid to late October.  Using the monthly tab on weather.com for Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on October 31, the average high and low temperatures are 49* and 31*, and the record high and low are 68* and 10*.  I will have switched to my 20* Western Mountaineering sleeping bag in Damascus, Virginia and wearing long underwear, I’ve been comfortable in the teens before.  If I wear my down puffy, I have no doubts about being survivable at 10*. An average of 1.9” of snow falls in October.  On the other hand, in late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy dropped 32 inches of snow on Mount LcConte creating drifts as deep as 7 feet!  So I will need to stay vigilant and flexible.  At any rate, October in the Smokies is more temperate than November.
I hope to reach Spinger Mountain in the first two weeks of November, in plenty of time to travel home before Thanksgiving.  Actually, I order my Vermont turkey on-line through our local food co-op, so that isn’t a problem.  Thinking about it reminds me to buy a package of cheesecloth before i leave, as it is often in short supply as the holiday approaches.  I wholeheartedly recommend Julia Child’s recipe in From Julia Child’s Kitchen.  My copy has decades of gravy stains on those pages.  
Leaving Harpers Ferry by April 15 next Spring should give me adequate time to reach Katahdin and be home by our anniversary. 
And so, Rocky Raccoon and I will suffer the heat and humidity and no-see-ums for the first week.  The elevation of Shenandoah National Park should moderate conditions, I hope.  
I’m just back from my morning walk in full pack.  It’s only 70 degrees here in Burlington, but the humidity is 91%.  I admit that I’m asking myself the title question!  Instead of the reasoned response I present above, I hear echos of stupidity, stubbornness, and insanity bouncing around my empty skull.  A friend in Harpers Ferry has offered to slackpack us the first day, for the 900’ climb up Loudon Heights that starts our hike.  I’m not as resolute in my refusal as I was yesterday!",,View Entry,"Aug 06, Sat",0

For those of you who have followed the misadventures of my Spring hike and wondered what became of my trail friend Necessary Evil (Ness), I’ll tell you some of his story.  About a month ago, while approaching Mt. Success and the Maine border, Ness heard a pop in his left foot followed by excruciating pain.  He managed to limp slowly and painfully to a road crossing, and called a hiker he had met on the Colorado Trail last year who lives in Maine.  Ness was rescued the next morning, taken home, and then to the Portland Airport the following morning.  A partial rupture of the plantar fascia was diagnosed and poor Ness won’t be hiking for months.  His plan for next year is to hike from Rockfish Gap, the southern end of Shenandoah National Park, where he started this year, south to Springer Mountain in Georgia, and then to hike Maine in 2024 to complete the Appalachian Trail.  We spoke for about an hour this week, and I admire his positive attitude and maturity.  Talking with him made me realize how wonderful it was to have a close trail friend this year.  I haven’t had a real tramily (trail family) since 2018, and now I want one again!  I see that as unlikely for this hike, since I’ll be moving slower and hiking lower daily miles than the southbound thru-hikers and flip-floppers I’ll meet.  But it is something I would relish.  And Ness’ sad tale reminds me that even if my knees are trouble-free, something else could always go wrong!
I’ll do my final packing tomorrow morning and walk down to the Amtrak station for the Ethan Allen Express leaving 10:10.  Tom offered to drive me down.  It’s about 1 mile even, but I like the idea of saying goodbye at home and feeling like leaving the condo with my pack on is the start of my hike.",,View Entry,"Aug 12, Fri",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656430,"The Ethan Allen Express arrived in Schenectady on time yesterday. Debbie and her partner Rick met me along with their dog Tigger who was cowering behind the driver’s seat.  I never knew he was there. Tigger is a rescue dog and must have had a hellish puppyhood. Their cat Leo on the other hand has transformed from a shy bashful claws-out beast into a gentle loving needs-to-be-petted-now fur ball. So maybe there is hope for Tigger. Indeed, if Leo can change his stripes (use your imagination; he’s solid black), perhaps there is hope for us all. After a dinner of take-out Italian from their favorite restaurant, Canali’s, it was early to bed for me.
And early to rise, since we had to leave at 4:45 for the Amtrak station in Albany. The Empire Service arrived at Penn Station a few minutes early. The café car didn’t open.  I was hungry and Debbie was craving coffee, but we had to wait until we got to Penn Station.  A bagel & lox from H & H Bagels, where some of you may recall that Kramer from Seinfeld worked for a short while until he lost his chewing gum in the dough, filled me nicely. Debbie ordered a string of adjectives and adverbs from Starbucks and seemed well pleased.  When the Moynihan Pavilion at Penn Station opened last year, it was criticized for the lack of seating and food. There’s now a ticketed passengers waiting room that is quite nice with lots of wooden-slatted walls, built-in seating. a stone floor, and more importantly, an abundance of charging ports and outlets. The bathroom was immaculate but lacked any means of drying my hands. No paper towels, no blower, no anything. Maybe that’s in the works for next year. The food court offers everything, except chairs. 
My apology to the Moynihan Pavilion. Debbie just returned from the restroom. There are three taps at each sink. The leftmost one is an automatic soap dispenser. The middle one is water. That’s as far as I got. The right hand one is an air dryer. Fancy!
We left New York three minutes late. The Northeast Regional is a looong train and the business class car is at the end, making for a nice hike.  It’s a fairly new car and very comfortable, even more leg room than the last train.  We got into Washington 13 minutes late but we still have an hour and 25 minutes until the Capital Limited that stops in Harpers Ferry. It’s a beautiful day, 83* with 38% humidity. We found a bench in a wooded park between Union Station and the Capital, and relaxed in the fresh air and quiet and enjoyed a respite from the dreaded mask. There were a fair number of unhoused people about, but we fit right in with our backpacks. We met a very nice man camping across from us who broke his umbrella trying to frighten away a panhandling squirrel. I contributed to his umbrella replacement fund. He had a very well cared for service dog, a Staffordshire terrier mix, named Rocky Balboa. We think he is related to Rocky Raccoon. 
The Capital Limited was boarding when we got back to the station. We were assigned to seats 37 & 38 upstairs, which do not exist unless like Platform 9-3/4 in Harry Potter, these seats require magic to access. We were reassigned to more appropriate muggle seats. Our friend  Chris  met us at the station in Harpers Ferry and carried us to our hotel. While waiting for Chris and his wife Sandi to pick us up for dinner at The Anvil Restaurant, we met Cat Water, an older woman (perhaps my age but I’ll guess younger to be polite) who started at the Flip Flop Festival a few days after I did. She summited Katahdin last week. Cat Water enjoyed Ness’ company in Gorham, NH just days before his injury that forced him to leave the trail. She will starting her southbound section on Wednesday so perhaps I’ll see her again. 
Sandi and I served together for many years on the board of Appalachian Trail Conservancy and she is currently serving as president and CEO. Chris is the Potomac AT Club trail overseer for the section of trail south of Harpers Ferry known as the Roller Coaster for its seemingly endless series of steep rocky ups and downs. A narrow right of way forces the trail to follow a razorback ridgeline. Dinner with old friends was be a special treat for us.

We walked up to ATC Headquarters. The visitors’ center has been thoroughly cleaned for the first time in decades. I looked through the hiker photos. I am flip-flopper number 67.  I wrote my number on my thru-hiker’s hangtag so I wouldn’t forget it this time. 
Then we walked down High Street to Lower Town, the Harpers Ferry National Historic Park, and toured the various exhibits housed in 19th century buildings.  As a hiker it’s easy to overlook the significance of Harpers Ferry in geological and historical terms and just see it as another bump in the trail. Geologically, it is situated at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers on a peninsula prone to flooding, undergirded by metamorphic rock and limestone.  Harpers Ferry is surrounded by Maryland Heights across the Potomac, Loudon Heights across the Shenandoah and Bolivar Heights to the west. The abundant water power made it a natural choice as a national armory since 1799.  Meriwether Lewis came to Harpers Ferry to outfit the Lewis and Clark Expedition.   It is best known as the site of John Brown’s Raid in 1859, a precursor to the Civil War. It changed hands eight times during the Civil War, and played a key role in Robert E. Lee’s invasion of Maryland in 1862, culminating in Antietam. 
We met Laurie Potteiger, recently retired as ATC’s director on information, known as Trail Mom to thousands of hikers, and her friend Chris at the Rabbit Hole for lunch. Chris is a certified National Park guide and an avid hiker and cyclist. I reined in my appetite and had only a seasonal salad and a local IPA, saving room for our dinner this evening at the PressRoom in Shepherdstown with ATC’s director of finance, Stacey. We worked closely together when I was treasurer and both prize Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Stacey’s husband Laird is the chef at the PressRoom. I’ll let you know how that goes. 
I’ll close this final prehike entry by promising that starting tomorrow I’ll write more about hiking and less about eating!",,View Entry,"Aug 15, Mon",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656510,"Dinner at the Press Room in Shepherdstown was superb. The companionship of my friend Stacey and my cousin Rocky Raccoon would have been enough, but add in the excellence of the setting (the intimate Library Room) and the food and it was a memorable evening. Stacey’s husband Laird, the chef, sent out an appetizer of grilled peaches, crispy pancetta, pickled red onions and goat cheese over a bed of baby arugula, all drizzled in balsamic vinegar. We also shared the house made mozzarella with roasted tomatoes. I had the halibut special, baked with a cream sauce with Ritz cracker topping, done to perfection so it would just flake with a little effort but not fall apart, and a side of hericot vert, still slightly crunchy. All wonderfully fresh ingredients treated with respect and consummate skill. It all paired well with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Dessert was an intense lavender crème brûlée. I almost forgot the sour dough bread made from a starter that is decades old. 
Does your brain have taste buds so you can so you can read a menu and savor the items?  It’s like studying a musical score and hearing a quartet in your head. Both are skills worth developing. 
The rain has stopped and it’s time for a repeat of yesterday’s breakfast, description not warranted. There is food that is mere sustenance, like breakfast at the Quality Inn, and then there is food like last night, the memory of which will propel me across the Shenandoah River Bridge and 900’ up Loudon Heights. It’s in the 60’s this morning so it should be pleasant.
Guess what?  It wasn’t. Long climbs are never pleasant. From Loudon Heights to Keys Gap is another 3.5 miles and a good spot for a break. Debbie stayed and watched the packs while I walked 0.3 mi east on Rte 9 to the Sweet Springs Store, a nice gas station convenience store that I knew from a previous hike had excellent fried chicken. I carried a drumstick and a breast another 3.0 miles to David Lesser Shelter where we are spending the night. It’s only 8.6 miles, but that’s enough for the first day. There were some rocky sections of trail today, and I knew my knees were there, but it was nothing like Pennsylvania a few months ago. 
David Lesser Shelter is very nice, with a large wooden porch, detached picnic pavilion, bear pole and privy. A blue blaze trail leads to an overgrown camping area and continues steeply downhill for another quarter mile to a cold spring. Definitely leave your boots on to get water and I would suggest bringing one hiking pole.  
There’s a gentlemen who appears to be squatting in the campground.  Perhaps I am misreading the situation, but Rocky and I have opted to stay in the shelter tonight. 
My dirty water bladder holds three liters which is easily enough for any cooking and plenty to drink and to start the next day, and even enough to squander on a bandana bath. I like to bathe before dinner and change into cleaner clothes for dining and sleeping. My BeFree filter screws into the top of the bladder. 
It’s 3:00 now. I’ve eaten the fried chicken and so far Rocky and I have the shelter to ourselves. We saw only a few hikers today, so maybe our luck will hold. The temperature has climbed to 81*. Just sitting here in the shade in the picnic pavilion is very comfortable. Walking in it, lugging a pack, is not as comfortable. 
I was in the lead when we saw the first hiker coming toward us.  She and I mutually exclaimed, “I’m so glad to see you!”  Translation:  I won’t have to break any more spider webs. There were several well-constructed orb-weaver webs at head level this morning. Fortunately they were easy to spot because of rain drops from the shower earlier. 
I’m thankful for the weather today. Starting in the rain is never fun. At the moment, the forecast looks excellent until the weekend!","Quality Inn, Harpers Ferry

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656597,"We were joined last night by Nabib, a retired industrial engineer from Pakistan who was educated in the U.S. and worked all over the world. His wife is from Ohio and they are retiring to Fairfax, Virginia. He also established a charitable foundation in Pakistan to feed school children and hopes to do the same here. He started today from Snickers Gap, below Bears Den and ends tomorrow in Harpers Ferry. I shared my extra water and saved him a trek down to the spring. 
Then Sassafras from Denmark came in, but she is tenting below. She started a flip-flop north from Harpers Ferry in the spring, but was falling behind so skipped a couple of states. She has a six-month visa so is limited. She started from Harpers Ferry southbound yesterday and will see how far she gets. I would like to get to know her better. 
Clear this morning but rain showers expected after 3. I am hoping we can hike the 11.2 miles to Bears Den Hostel by then. I fell asleep early last night, about 7:00, but awoke when Sassafras came in. Then I was asleep until 4:45. Debbie will get up about 6:30. I quietly packed up and moved to the picnic pavilion. A bacon tortilla and Carnations Essential for breakfast this morning. I look forward to offloading my garbage baggy with chicken bones at Bears Den.  
About 3/4 mile into our hike this morning we came upon a decapitated large bird in the middle of the trail. It was very fresh. Judging from the color of the feathers, I’m guessing that it was a golden eagle or an immature bald eagle, but it could have been a buzzard. We heard shotgun blasts last night. Perhaps there is a connection. At any rate, it was a disturbing thing to find and horrible to speculate on the motives of the person who did it. Could it have been a great horned owl, known to eat the head of their prey?
We passed Blackburn Trail Center but didn’t go down since we didn’t need water but did take a snack break by the southern access trail. The trail was characterized by steep sections, occasional rock gardens, and some nice dirt trail, and it became more intense after we entered the roller coaster. We had four large steep climbs today. At first, I was able to walk up them without breaks, but by the last one, I was fried and resorted to step counting. 
Bears Den Rocks is an outcropping offered great views across the Shenandoah Valley to the Allegheny Mountains and is popular for day hikers and for teenage drinking and trysts. In order to police and maintain the Rocks, ATC bought an adjoining estate and house once owned by a physician and his opera singer wife from Washington. She gave weekend concerts. It’s managed as a hiker hostel by PATC. $35 gets a hiker a shower, bunk, frozen pizza, a pint of Ben & Jerry’s, a soda, and laundry. What a value! 
A southbound thru-hiker Beyoncé and Sassafras from last night are here, tenting outside. 
I’ll sleep well tonight, freshly showered and stuffed with pizza and ice cream. Tomorrow will be the rest of the roller coaster.  Thrills!","David Lesser Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656707,"I was asleep last night when a first-year group from William & Mary College came in. They had reserved the upstairs dormitories.  The noise they made getting situated was like a herd of elephants over our heads. It sounded like they were moving furniture, pushing it from one side of the room to the other.  Even so I got a good night’s sleep. Breakfast was DIY pancakes and I did the honors for Rocky and me. I enjoyed a little coffee with mine. 
We are delighted to be done with the thrill ride of the Roller Coaster. It usually ranks among the top ten most difficult sections of the AT. We certainly set no speed records but we survived intact with no falls. Our toes are a bit worse for wear from the steep rocky downs, but nothing a little tape and a few easier days won’t mend. About half way through today, with just three climbs left, it was as though the roller coaster cars started coasting into the station. The constant rocks that defined the treadway up until then vanished for the most part and there were even switchbacks on some of the ups and downs. 
It wasn’t a long day in terms of miles, but it was in terms of effort. It was warm, low 80’s today with a slight breeze found only at the tops of the hills. 
The highlight today was getting to know Sassafras better. She is much faster, but at one point today, I saw her hiking toward me. She had gotten turned around. It happens to all of us. So we had lunch together sitting at the trailhead at Morgan Mills Road. She has gone on past Rod Hollow Shelter so it’s unlikely that we will see her again. It was fun learning about Denmark from her. Imagine a country where the most conservative political party is to the left of Bernie Sanders!
Rod Hollow is a nice shelter.  Amenities include a typically smelly pit privy, a piped spring and a few tent pads, but no Verizon signal. Rocky and I grabbed two of the tent pads. I’m looking forward to a good night’s sleep. I tried the Alpine Air Chicken Pot Pie for dinner.  I would rather have had Ramen.","Bears Den Hostel

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656708,"I did sleep well last night, but truthfully, I almost always sleep better outdoors and especially after hours of exercise. Exhaustion is a great cure for insomnia. 
Several southbound thru-hikers came in last night but none wanted to share their story. One was named Hummingbird, but that’s all I learned. This morning we met another hiker who came in after I was in my tent. Atlas, a thirty-something woman lives in Northern Virginia and is section hiking. I’m hoping she comes to Whiskey Hollow Shelter tonight. 
Today’s hike was uneventful but the heat, humidity and lack of a breeze made it less than pleasant. I’m glad we scheduled a short day instead of pushing on another 5 miles to Manassas Gap Shelter. After a prolonged sweaty up, we entered Sky Meadows State Park featuring a hiker bench at either end. We took full advantage of them. On my first few hikes of this section, Sky Meadows was kept mown and it wasn’t unusual to see herds of deers grazing. It’s been allowed to go natural meaning that the trail is closed in and there are no views. I’m sure it’s healthier this way from an environmental standpoint, but I miss the meadowy feeling it had before. There were no deer, but there were several sightings of day hikers both on the park trails and the AT. 
Whiskey Hollow Shelter is a newer shelter on a quarter-mile access trail. It’s lovely with a clerestory window above the loft, reached by steep stairs. I’m sleeping below but Rocky Raccoon will be adventure sleeping tonight. Capacity would be 12 in nice weather and many more in the rain. The water source is clear cold Whiskey Creek, perhaps hinting at the history of this site. There’s a composting privy, always a pleasure compared to pit privies. 
I braved another Alpine Air dinner tonight, Wild Mushroom Linguini in Cream Sauce. It was really good!  
Atlas came in. She earned her name by the weight of her pack, in excess of 40 pounds. It hurts to even think about it. She’s from Northern Virginia and hiking from Harpers Ferry to Big Meadows in Shenandoah National Park. Her gas canister died mid-dinner so I had a chance to help. I can pick up a new one in Front Royal. 
There’s actually a breeze at the moment and walnuts are falling onto the metal shelter roof. Will it rain?  There’s not a strong enough signal for me to check the weather, not that it matters, but it’s one of the things I obsess over given the chance. 
Tomorrow will be another relatively short day, 10.0 miles, leaving us a short walk to Front Royal on Sunday.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656731,"In an earlier posting, I wrote about St Francis who referred to his body as Brother Ass. It is said that one of the few regrets he expressed at the end of his life was not being kinder to Brother Ass so that he might have lived longer. I vowed to be kind to my brother ass on this trip. Aside from the nasty heat and humidity today, there was nothing special about the miles we hiked today, yet I was aware of my left big toe still in rebellion from countless rock kicks in the Roller Coaster. It’s asking for a little love and tenderness. So I’ve decided to take a zero day (zero hiking miles) on Monday in Front Royal. We will arrive there tomorrow after 5.2 relatively easy miles tomorrow morning. Coincidentally, thunderstorms are forecast for Monday!
Aside from seeing two box turtles, heads happily attached, the highlight came at the Tucker’s Lane parking area at VA 55.  I remembered that there was a picnic table there, a good place for lunch. I had been debating with myself whether to go into Linden to a convenience store for ice cream or a cold drink and then taking Fiery Run Road out of town, bypassing 2 miles of the AT and a miserable climb in the heat. The temptation was strong and my resistance was melting. I can’t blame Rocky Raccoon who was agreeable to either. The dilemma was resolved by our finding Cat Water, whom we had met in Harpers Ferry, and her hiking buddy Crossword sitting at the picnic bench. He had iced cold bottles of Gator Aid and an assortment of UTZ chips (my favorite brand of potato chip).  They paired perfectly with my tortilla and tuna in olive oil. Revived by the Gator Aid and friendship, it was up and over the noxious hump. 
Jim and Molly Denton Shelter is a PATC showcase, a large clean shelter with a wooden front porch featuring bench seating and an Adirondack style lounge, a separate food pavilion, composting privy and most especially a solar shower and water faucet, gravity fed by spring water. The shower was bracing but well worth it. 
A pair of brothers are here this evening. The younger, Optimistic, is age 24, a student of political science, and thru-hiker. He started in Georgia and at Harpers Ferry will flip to Katahdin in Maine and hike south. His older brother, Luke, is age 27 and a glass artist in Denver, mostly relating to the burgeoning cannabis industry. He’s just out for a week with Baby Bro and their father will meet them in Washington. Seldom have I met such erudite delightful young men on the trail or anywhere. What a treat for me.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656766,"We covered the 5.2 miles to US 522 in about two hours. Much of the trail was as photographed, the ideal of the AT, mostly smooth dirt and well maintained. After a relatively short up, it was all downhill to the highway.  For the last mile or so, it follows the tall fencing for the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute used for breeding rare and endangered species. We saw none. It comes out on US 522 at a good place for hitching west into Front Royal, at least it has been a good place on past hikes. Not today.  It was starting to rain and perhaps that discouraged drivers. Wet hikers must out-reek a wet dog. We followed the AT to the main trailhead across the street and found ourselves between two battling trail angels. Daisy’s Mom, wife of Orange Pops who we met twice, was giving out water, electrolyte powder and bananas. Peddler also had goodies but I mentioned that what we really needed was to get into Front Royal. He rearranged his car and drove us to the Baymont Motel where had reservations. True trail angels!
It was only 10:45 and our room wouldn’t be ready until about noon, so the motel held our packs. We wandered up Main Street. There were signs of life and economic recovery a year ago, but the improvements since then are amazing. I saw only one vacant storefront. The streetscape is attractive with hanging baskets of petunias, benches decorated to reflect nearby businesses, the banana split bench in front of one of three ice cream parlors being particularly noteworthy. Main Street seems designed to appeal to tourists more than locals.   It’s good to see Front Royal capitalizing on its location as gateway to Shenandoah National Park. Element Restaurant which occupied a small space on the edge of town several years ago has relocated to Main Street with double the space. I looked at their menu and they’ve added a pizza oven. I fondly renember a Hendricks martini, a truly first-class Caesar salad, complete with curls of aged Parmesan, anchovies, and Parmesan croutons, and a perfect roast local chicken. Glad to see that they are thriving. It being Sunday morning, most businesses including the outfitter were closed. We’ll go back this afternoon. 
The smell of town food was giving me hunger pangs. Rocky Raccoon, however, seldom eats more than one meal a day. She walked out to the CVS while I enjoyed a grilled cheese and hash browns at the Dunkin’ across from the motel. It was surprising good, with stringy gooey cheese on thick sour dough slices. When I finished that, I returned to the motel. Our room was ready. I checked in, leaving a room key for Rocky. She came back while I was showering. The motel is tired, but the room has been remodeled, is clean, and has great water pressure. Their regular rate is $110/night. They say they don’t offer a hiker discount but with my AAA discount it was $70. I am grateful!  
Our friend Willow who thru-hiked in 2018 mailed us a care package to the hotel. It included Luna Mashup Bars of lemon and blueberry (very good), pistachios, snack packages of olives and delicious chocolate. 
The motel has a guest laundry but all of the available soap included bleach so I’m at the laundromat across the street while Rocky showers. There’s something fun about laundromats when it’s not in your own town. It’s always a collection of misfits down on luck or marital fortunes. There are harried women juggling children and laundry, confused middle aged men wondering how to use the machines, heavily tattooed gentlemen with hogs parked out front, hiker trash (me), and an assortment of migrants who appear and sound Hispanic. The prize goes to a double plus-sized woman with the most perfect Bride of Frankenstein stripe down one side of her hair. Has the laundromat become America’s new melting pot?  Is this the True America?
I’m glad we are taking a zero tomorrow, or at least my right big toe is. Last night’s treatment has it looking much better but it needs another day for hiking without pain. Meanwhile, my legs and knees are quite happy but not objecting to a day of rest. 
I played with my sleeping pad in the bathtub and couldn’t find a leak. A rubber ducky would have been much more fun. I searched on line and I’m not unique in having this problem.  Also, the Thermarest NeoAir Uberlite is notoriously noisy. The outfitter here is very low on inventory, cleaned out by previous thru-hikers, and had nothing suitable. I checked out sleeping pads online and decided on the Exped Ultra 1R pad that is effectively uninsulated but about the same weight as my present pad but quiet. I called the outfitter in Rockfish Gap, my next town stop. They don’t carry it, but are willing to accept a package for me. REI will have it there in plenty of time. I may need to add an ensolite pad under it at some point, but that’s okay. Meanwhile, I’ll reinflate the old one when I have to get up to pee at night. 
Dinner tonight is Royal Spice Indian and Nepalese cuisine. We shared Samosas for an appetizer, enjoying both the mint and tamarind sauces. My entree was lamb Biryani, tender marinated lamb cooked in basmati rice with a side of raita, a yogurt “fire extinguisher.”  I ordered mine a 6 on a 1-10 heat scale. Definitely a sinus clearer. A Ottakringer Vienna lager paired well. 
My only task for tomorrow is visiting the grocery store. I don’t need much.  And we’ll have to figure out how to return to the trail on Tuesday.","Jim & Molly Denton Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656807,"You might think that I wouldn’t find much to write about on a town day, but you know me better than that. True, there won’t be much happening, but that doesn’t mean my imagination isn't active. I’ve shared before that the regular rhythm of walking, especially on trail like I photographed yesterday, leads to day dreams. And getting adequate daily exercise almost always assures vivid dreams at night. So I’ll write about those. 
I’ll start with a daydream following the laundromat yesterday. How about a one act play titled “Spin Cycle?”  Researching it would be easy, just visiting laundromats in strange towns and listening. A celebration of the ordinary yet grotesque. 
Then last night, two memorable dreams. The first cast me as the male lead in a Hollywood musical about love at first sight. I was a college student trying to get out of town on the last day of exams and traffic was fearsome so I took to the backroads.  At one point the narrow country lane was blocked by an empty farm cart and I just slightly bumped it, but it was enough to upend it. The cart was a dream apple cart designed like a harness racing sulky so that absent a horse it was very easily upset. Yes, I was back in time on an old fashioned apple farm and my car was gone. I saw a beautiful young woman played by ingenue Barbara Cook and instantly fell in love. And so did Barbara. Then she was sitting on a tree branch belting out a paean to first love. Shirley Jones, in her prime, played her mother and while Barbara repeated her song, Shirley added a second melody about the dangers of love at first sight while simultaneously remembering that’s how she met her husband. I added a third line, as a lyric tenor, about how this was the girl I was going to marry.  If my dream can transform my rusty baritone into a lyric tenor, it can also make me straight. Only in Hollywood. Needless to say, I had to prove my love by entering into a quest, standard fare for us heroes. The dream goes hazy in my memory  but there was lots more music.
The dream I awakened from had me as a student at a school for witchcraft and wizardry. Sound familiar?  It wasn’t Hogwarts but Professor McGonagall put in a cameo appearance. Only she wore an academic robe.  On the last day of classes, we were sent on a scavenger hunt in lieu of exams, instructed to identify and record the location of 10 things from arcane clues. The hunt was interrupted by an alien space invasion. Little flying saucers, maybe 1 meter in diameter, came crashing into the ground boring deep circular holes from which scores more saucers emerged. Kind of a reverse Elon Musk. The aliens who were invisible to me appointed dense humans to watch over the school, but our watchers seemed more afraid of us than we were of them and we continued with business as usual. I found my final object, two botanical sources for perfume, in a necropolis of sorts. 
Both dreams have similar elements: end of term (a time of transition), a disruptive event (falling in love or an alien invasion) and both have me going on a quest. Since when is a long hike not a quest of sorts?  
I’ve often been asked why I hike. One of my answers is for the dreams. Now do you understand?  And the above is just one day’s dreams and only the ones I remember!  Going to the grocery store is going to feel very tame indeed, but “Watch the skies. Everywhere. Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.”
Cat Water was at breakfast this morning. She’s an anthropologist and great fun. She’s going into Shenandoah National Park today so will be ahead of me. I shouldn’t see her again but one never can tell with hikers.  Hikers come and go so quickly around here, it seems. 
Rocky and I walked over to Martin’s Grocery for a few things. After Willow’s care package we didn’t need much. The store has a cute robotic floor sweeper named Marty. I had thought the store name was Martine’s and pronounced it “Mar-Teens” which amused my cashier.  She doesn’t like Marty because she never knows what he is thinking and fears that he may be more intelligent than her. She scanned her personal member card, saving me $1.25. Front Royal is such a friendly town. 
The motel desk clerk is working on getting us a 7:30 shuttle back to the trail tomorrow. The motel typically shuttle at 10:30, but that is too late. I offered to tip well, since we were planning on a taxi otherwise. That worked and the hotel handyman will drive us tomorrow. 
While Rocky read by the pool, I  made reservations at the two resorts in Shenandoah National Park for Thursday at Skyland and Friday at Big Meadows, two less nights to put up with my sleeping pad!  
We had lunch at the Old Mill Restaurant, sitting out on the covered porch. More accurately, I had a grilled chicken salad and a local ale called Satan’s Pony. Rocky, saving her appetite for dinner, was content with a wheat beer. There was a Rolls Royce convertible, top down, parked nearby. When a heavy rain shower rolled in, I confess to taking pleasure in watching two gentlemen run out to raise the top and then meticulously drying the interior. We waited 15 minutes or so for the shower to pass before returning to our motel. 
In past hikes of Shenandoah National Park, I’ve always stopped at the self-registration kiosk near the park boundary to complete the multiparty carbon-paper permit using the miniature golf dull pencil they provide, struggling to hold it in my large hands and apply sufficient pressure for the multitude of copies. Rocky said that we could apply online but the link she sent me was for regular park visitors and not backcountry hikers. I explored the park’s website and found the correct form, forwarding it to Rocky. While I took a long soak, for the sake of my toe (right!), Rocky used the guest computer in the lobby. It took her three tries and a phone call to the park administration office, but we now have confirmation emails detailing our registration on our phones. Excellent work, Raccoon!  All that remains of this most pleasant zero day is dinner.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656969,"Last year, Rocky Raccoon and I arrived at the US 522 trailhead by taxi from the Baymont Hotel. As I watched the taxi recede into the distance, I realized that I had left my water bladder and bottle in the refrigerator in our room. It took a second cab fare to retrieve it. This morning was Rocky’s turn. Her Nalgene bottle that she uses for electrolyte mixes was in the back of our shuttle driver’s SUV.   Rocky phoned the hotel who phoned Chris, the driver, and he was back in minutes.  Chris is the head of maintenance at the hotel and kept very busy renovating rooms, one by one. 
The trail follows the Smithsonian compound fence and gradually gains elevation to Tom Floyd Shelter. We didn’t stop in but continued to Possom Rest, an escarpment that marks the
boundary of Shenandoah National Park. We passed by the self-registration station and soon  saw two park employees hiking toward us. Seeing a ranger in the backcountry is a rare sighting so we took a photo.  The ranger is charged with keeping track of the park’s bears. We missed seeing a sow with cubs nearby. The young woman is an intern very interested in making a career with the National Park Service. The trail in the park is by and large magnificent, but ups still go up.  Much of it wascbuilt by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930’s when they paved over the original AT to build the Skyline Drive. We climbed Compton Mountain and then Marshall. We arrived at Gravel Springs Hut about 4:00 and had it to ourselves for an hour. A couple of southbounders who are doing 25-35 mile days are in now.  Micky D is a young man from Milwaukee who seems hellbent on his mission of completing his hike, hiking over 30 miles a day. He has little time or interest in conversation. Tick is a 50-something man convinced of the righteousness of his cause, which comes across as being himself. He hikes 20+ mile days. 
As you would expect for stone and wood shelters built nearly 90 years ago, Gravel Springs Hut is home to mice. Rocky, Micky D, and I elected to tent on the convenient compacted dirt tent pads. Tick kept the mice company and probably convinced them of the error of their ways.","Front Royal

About half way up, the trail grazes a parking area along the Skyline Drive. We were hailed by Daisy’s Mom, out doing magic while she awaits her husband Orange Pops. This time Daisy, a large friendly Great Dane was at her side. I scarfed down a gooey delicious chocolate bar hoping the burst of energy would carry me up the remaining mountain. It didn’t. Way down the other side was Elkwallow Wayside. Wayside is SNP-speak for a combination camp store and grill. I enjoyed a Shenandoah smash burger, stale chips and a mountain blackberry shake for lunch. I also bought a package of Ramen for dinner, knowing that I wouldn’t be hungry. Rocky Raccoon ate her instant peanut butter on tortilla, but did have a few of my chips. 
Sassafras was at the wayside enjoying the same lunch. We thought she was ahead of us, but she took a double-zero in Front Royal. She elected to “ghost blaze” after lunch, meaning following the original route of the trail which just happens to be followed by the Skyline Drive, saving a couple of miles and a mountain. Rocky and I were tempted but followed the current trail, including a couple of long ups in the afternoon heat and humidity. I came close to losing my lunch on several occasions.  Needless to say, Sassafras beat us to Pass Mountain Hut by a comfortable margin. There are bear warnings posted so we elected to join Sassafras in tenting, all in close proximity.  We were all in tents by 6:30 and I fell asleep soon after.

The day started with a long gradual descent to Thornton Gap and then 1,200’ up to Mary’s Rock.  It’s a long way!  It’s the one up that I like to take at my pace, promising that I’ll wait for Rocky at the top. On the way up, I met a Marine from Oklahoma, retired on 100% disability for back injuries. He can day hike, but backpacking is out of the question. Today, he was photographing, spending 15 minutes on a millipede.  Rocky took the lead while I put my kit together again. She was a flying raccoon and I made no effort to keep up. Daydreaming, I took a blue blazed trail downhill, losing about 30 minutes. I eventually caught up with RR at Pinnacle Picnic Ground for lunch. We shared the pavilion with three retired siblings, now living in Front Royal. They were already putting up their picnic so we were too late to share. I tried my best and we hit it off well, but some people just can’t take a hint!  A black snake made a cameo appearance before climbing a tree to escape our interest. RR and the older sister are not fond of snakes. Brother is fond of them. The climb up Stonyman Mountain was agony mid-afternoon. Guests of Skyland didn’t make us feel better, skipping past us and reeking of cleanliness. Our arrival at Skyland was timed perfectly for check-in time. Oh the joy of showers, comfortable mattresses and real food!  I enjoyed a Caesar salad, with almost too much Parmesan but no anchovies, a foil pouch of boneless trout, white wine, and julienned bell peppers with a side of wild rice. Dessert was apple crisp with a cat’s head scoop of rich vanilla ice cream, almost more than I could eat. 
I forgot to take any photos today, so I’ll share the kissing trees from in front of Pass Mountain Hut. I first saw them in 1997 and the embrace just keeps growing in intimacy. 
Tomorrow will be a much shorter and easier day to Big Meadows where we also have reservations. At the moment I can’t face breakfast, but we will see!","Pass Mountain Hut
",Skyland,"Aug 25, Thu",10.70
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657037,"It was quite easy to face breakfast after all.  No problem to inhale a pint of orange juice, custom omelet and potatoes. Skyland doesn’t open for breakfast until 7:30 but we were not in any hurry this morning, with only 8.1 relatively easy miles to hike. It is by far our coolest day with a bonus breeze and the clearest views. The iPhone camera doesn’t do it justice. Ridge after ridge of mountains, some with low clouds cloaking the valleys. We saw a four point buck in velvet, totally unbothered by us and actually walking toward us on the trail. He debated whether to claim right-of-way but finally conceded the trail by just a couple of meters. 
We arrived at Big Meadows shortly after noon, hoping we could exchange our room with a king and a fold out sofa for a room with two beds, but they are at full occupancy tonight. The Friends of Shenandoah National Park are meeting here, so we are lucky to have a room at all. We are literally chilling out in the balcony waiting for either the tap room to open or for our room to be ready.  Neither of us want lunch. It was a short hike and I had breakfast. Rocky doesn’t want to ruin her appetite for dinner. It is maybe 70* but the breeze makes it feel cooler.   We retreated indoors and then to the taproom. Our room was ready at 4, the regular check-in time. It’s a walk of a couple of tenths but a nice room. Rocky has claimed the sofa directly in front of the large TV and the remote.  I’ll be asleep before she finishes channel surfing!  
Dinner tonight was a side green salad and osso buco with grits and Feta. It was tender but unremarkable. The local Merlot bordered on insipid, harsh alcohol with little balance and minimal fruit.  No dessert for me tonight. Perhaps had today been a more challenging hike, I would have appreciated dinner more!
Tomorrow will be another easy hike ending at Lewis Mountain Campground. Before climbing Lewis Mountain, the trail passes through a section that has always felt bearish to me. Perhaps Rocky will finally see her bear tomorrow!","Skyland
",Big Meadows Lodge,"Aug 26, Fri",8.10
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657326,"When we first got into our room yesterday, Rocky Raccoon put on the TV.   The 1993 film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray was playing.  It took a few minutes for me to unpack my backpack, to retrieve my toilet kit and cleaner clothes, to be ready to shower, but it was enough time for the movie to bore its way into my brain. In combination with the osso buca and nasty wine, it set off a doozy of a dream last night. 
I dreamed that we were in the lodge for breakfast (in reality Rocky doesn’t eat breakfast), and we were talking about what a pleasant hike yesterday was. I commented that I wouldn’t mind doing it again. A nearby man dressed in a linen suit, who looked suspiciously like Burgess Meredith, interrupted, “If I heard you correctly, perhaps I could be of assistance.”  He proceeded to lay out the terms of a contract that would allow us to do just that. He seemed harmless enough, so we signed his contract using his proffered pen. As he capped his pen, our signatures, the words of the contract and indeed the paper, possibly parchment, itself vanished. He assured us that it was in a safe place. We laughed it off as cheap stage magic and proceeded to enjoy our breakfasts. 
We left Big Meadows heading trail south and everything seemed fine, until we climbed Lewis Mountain and found ourselves looking at the stables at Skyland Resort. We continued on the trail to the water tower that marks the spur trail to Skyland Lodge. I went into the office and this time there was no confusion about rooms. I was again told that it was paid. I had provided my credit card information when I had made the original reservation. The desk clerk suggested that I charge our meals to the room for simplicity. The menu wasn’t changed, I noted with regret, and the next day we hiked back to Big Meadows, where our room awaited us without delay. 
Somehow none of this bothered us. But when the same thing happened the next day and once again we found ourselves at Skyland, we started to become concerned. After several more repeats, and still without any menu change, we started to believe that we were trapped in a loop of time. Perhaps the Burgess Meredith man was not the kindly gentleman he seemed. Perhaps we should have read the whereas, hitherto and consideration clause of the contract more carefully. 
That’s when I awoke sufficiently to commit the dream to memory. So later today, wherever you are, if you hear a loud scream in the early afternoon, remember us condemned for eternity to hike the same stretch of trail without any hope of an updated menu or improved wine list. 
I wasn’t planning on breakfast at the lodge this morning, but I’m hungry once again, so I’ll take the risk. There was no mysterious man in a linen suit, thank goodness. I had two eggs over easy that were over hard, bacon that was obviously precooked and not warmed on the flattop, rye toast with frozen butter balls but a really good Maine blueberry preserve, and a fruit cup with ripe grapes and watermelon, canned pineapple and not-ready-for prime time cantaloupe and honeydew. It’s like no one cares!
The first half of our hike was glorious trail, very much that the ideal section I photographed a few days ago making for mindless hiking and good speed. If I rate it a “10,” starting at Hazeltop it degenerated to a mere “8,” with occasional rocks, still darned pleasant!  The trail across Bearfence Mountain crosses an old rock slide, so by necessity it is more rugged, but even so the amount of labor required to construct it is mind boggling. The Civilian Conservation Corps is amazing. Their were lots of weekend day hikers out to enjoy the rock scramble on Bearfence!  
We saw four deer including a six-point buck but no bear. Plenty of berry-rich bear scat and a print that I thought might be a bear but is more probably a bobcat!  Bears show five toes and claws. Bobcats show four. It could be a fox. What do you experts say?
I was greatly relieved as we crested Lewis Mountain not to see stables. Such a joy to be where we ought to be!  As we had been told, all of the cabins at Lewis Mountain are booked, so we are tenting in the campground and have our private picnic table and bear box. Woo-hoo!  The campground hosts are hikers and invited us for coffee or tea in the morning. Having the National Parks Senior Pass paid for itself, saving us $15. The regular rate is $30 per night. The camp store is very friendly (thanks, Ken), and we’re doing laundry. A five-minute shower for $2.50 was fine for me, but Raccoons with thick hair require lots more time. She’ll clean herself off in one of the camp bathrooms. 
I have no signal here at all, even when I stand in the magic spot by the fire hydrant. I’m dressed in my laundry clothes, my rain suit, and enjoying a Jimmy Dean sausage biscuit and a Yuengling Lager to tide me over until dinner, which will be something else nuked. How relaxing it is just to sit here on the store’s porch in my rain suit, gently rocking without a care in the world. Time has slowed down for me and I find great pleasure in sitting and watching nothing more exciting than the occasional squirrel and sometimes cars, mostly large SUVs and gurgling motorcycles, come into the campground. We need to do more sitting and a rocking in real life and learn to appreciate the fullness of nothing. 
Dinner was a Jimmy Dean spicy chicken sandwich and a double IPA called Bearfence from City Brewing in Waynesboro where Rocky ends her hike. Smooth and potent!  Rocky has a fire going. The hosts, Jim and Ann, offered some extra wood. They are from near Franklin, NC and have given me their contact info if I need help on that part of the trail. God bless them!  It’s a cool night and as much as I dislike fire, I’m enjoying this one. The wind is cooperating and keeping the smoke away from us. 
No signal here, but I’ll post when I can.","Big Meadows Lodge
",Lewis Mountain Campground ,"Aug 27, Sat",8.70
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657327,"Last year, Rocky and I left the trail at Swift Run Gap and went into a motel in Elkton. The immediate reason was flash flood warnings from the remnants of a hurricane. The proximate reason was my knees. Even with double knee replacements, they were unable to tolerate the day after day pounding. Flash forward. Thanks to extensive physical therapy designed to build “tissue tolerance” to the insults of the trail, both distance and impact, my knees are doing fine this hike, no sorer than the rest of me. So crossing Swift Run Gap about lunchtime was a quiet little celebration. I wish it wasn’t immediately followed by a long climb up Hightop Mountain, but that’s the AT!  
Until that climb, we had a pleasant time, playing leapfrog with Sassafras and another woman Sour Cream. Sour Cream started in Georgia, got homesick in Bland, VA, and after visiting home in Maryland, she returned to the trail at Katahdin in Maine and started hiking southward. When she reaches Bland, she will have completed her thru-hike. Sour Cream is a little unusual in being a solo female African American hiker, in her 20’s or early 30’s. Both Sassafras and Sour Cream went into a hostel from Swift Run Gap. They will most probably pass us tomorrow. 
This being a Sunday with delightful sunny, breezy weather (unless you are toting a pack uphill), the trail on High Top Mountain had lots of day hikers. We met a couple from Harrisonburg out maintaining their section, weed whacking and pruning. We thanked them profusely. A previous section today had stinging nettles encroaching on the trail. Ouch!  Harrisonburg is home to Eastern Mennonite University, and also James Madison College. Where I lived before moving to Vermont, Sarasota, Florida, has a large Anabaptist community. One of our staff accountants Ed Yoder moved to Harrisonburg when his wife, a nurse practitioner, joined the faculty of EMU.  Yoder is like the Smith of Mennonite names, but I asked if our maintainers might know him. Sure enough. Ed does the accounting and taxes for his business. So I’m hoping Ed receives my greeting. Had he stayed with our firm, I have no doubt that he would have been a partner.  The maintainers were a Yoder too, but unrelated. 
So far, Rocky and I are alone tenting at High Top Hut. A day hiker dressed all in orange with iridescent blue nail polish stopped by the hut to visit. He calls himself both Jonathan Livingston and The Planetary Prince. 
The water is a way downhill but is a gushing ice cold piped spring. As usual, I’ve wiped myself down and dressed for dinner. 
No Verizon signal the entire day. 
Our solitude was bound not to last. A flip-flop thru-hiker has come in. Go Girl covers in one day our hard won effort of two days. Won’t see her again. The hosts at Lewis Mountain Campground told her that she would be safe with us here. We’ve been promoted to the rank of trail grandparents. A couple from British Columbia and Ohio are sectioning four days, starting this afternoon mid-way up this mountain where the trail crosses the Skyline Drive. They are tenting below the shelter.  No one wants to stay in SNP huts. It’s where dead mice who were naughty in life are reborn.","Lewis Mountain Campground

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657330,"Today was 14.0 miles for our 14th day.  The first 8 miles to Pinefield Hut where we had lunch was fine. We met a section hiker there who is zeroing at the shelter for the day.  We loaded up on water since the temperature was climbing and the humidity was very high. The rest of the day was predominantly uphill and drained us both. We passed a 900 mile marker, probably constructed by a northbound hiker. It seems so far to go for me!  Lots of deer, especially at Loft Mountain Campground. We got there at four. The ranger sold me a pass good for any unclaimed space shown in black on the campground map, the red being reservable spaces. Before we chose a space, we hurried to the camp store that closes at 5 and bought dinner, breakfast, and a few items I need to finish this section in Waynesboro.  Then we walked around the black sites, finding a level grassy site close to the bathrooms and water. There isn’t a bear box, but Rocky found one a couple a spots down that isn’t being used. The park host gave her a tough time while I was at the camp store doing laundry and showering. I never pass up a chance to shower!

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657332,"I had to reinflate my sleeping pad umpteen times last night!  I can’t wait to pick up a new pad on Thursday. Between lack of sleep and yesterday’s long miles (for us), I woke up in a grouchy mood. Fortunately this was a short day with relatively easy trail. The highlight was crossing a giant jumble of fractured rocks on a CCC-manicured trail on Blackrock Mountain. Ravens were circling in the sky, taking time to mock us lowly bipeds. We arrived at Blackrock Hut about noon and quickly did our camp chores — fetching water, setting tents, a little cleaning — before having our lunches. I have a weak Verizon signal here, enough to handle texting, emails, and even a phone call home, but not strong enough to post. 
I was able to get a weather forecast for the first time since Big Meadows, and surprise!  A nasty band of severe thunderstorms is expected to roll through about 3:00. We have battened down the tents and are up at the stone and timber hut. The last rain we had was on our zero day in Front Royal, and here we are safe and dry once again.  The next two days into Waynesboro look good.  
My body is screaming for a zero day!  I’m sorry Brother Ass must wait a couple more days, but I’ll try to treat him well in Waynesboro so he doesn’t sit down and refuse to move ahead. 
We can hear thunder now!  I’m sorry for the hikers stuck out in this storm.  
At the peak of the storm, the couple from British Columbia and Ohio came in looking like drowned possums. Glad to have missed the experience. Our tents stayed dry inside. Last year during a similar storm. I had a stake pull out allowing the tent fly to flap inside the bathtub floor, flooding the tent. That’s why I upgraded tent stakes this year!  
And an first-year orientation group from Washington and Lee University came slogging in, soaked to the skin. Unfortunately they have pitched a tarp mere feet from our tents and didn’t quiet down until after 8:00. Can you imagine such a thing?  The hours students keep today!","Loft Mountain Campground
",Blackrock Hut,"Aug 30, Tue",7.40
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657333,"Today we hiked 13 miles to Calf Mountain Shelter which is outside Shenandoah National Park boundaries. The top of Calf Mountain that we will get to tomorrow morning is an antenna farm, excluded from the national park. Then we will reenter the Park until Rockfish Gap and the highway to Waynesboro. There were ups and downs, but we cruised today, except for the final climb up Calf Mountain.  We don’t do well in heat going uphill.  Mere yards from the shelter access path, Rocky and I were each stung by a hornet (whether the same bee or not, I do not know). They were probably trying to drive us away from their ground nest and succeeded. The spring is on the access trail so we stopped and loaded up. Dennis and Myra, the couple from British Columbia and Ohio, were there as well and are tenting here tonight. Rocky is tenting as well, but the remaining tent pads are unsatisfactory. I’m staying in the shelter where I can reinflate my pad as needed without disturbing anyway. The ridge runner, Tiny Pony, stopped by. Tiny he isn’t.  About 7:45, well after all of our bedtimes, Alec came into the shelter waking me up. My sleeping pad needed inflating anyway.  He is heading northbound through the Park.

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657356,"Last night was miserable for me. No sooner would I fall asleep than it seemed I woke up as either or both my shoulder or hip would be asleep, in pain, against the wooden shelter floor. Time to huff and puff to reinflate my sleeping pad yet again. Exhaustion made what should have been a relatively easy hike into Waynesboro agony for me. I managed to get confused as to route two times and nearly took a third wrong turn, but Rocky called me back. The second boo-boo was discovered when we saw Dennis and Myra approaching us on the trail. Oops. That misguidance was for less than 100 yards.  I was tripping over my own feet all morning and couldn’t believe how slowly the miles past. 
The highlight of the hike was sitting in a row of old tractor seats stuck into the ground near the communications antenna farm. I’ve never driven a tractor. The seats are surprisingly comfortable. Since they are on top of the mountain, I think of them as thrones. Queen Rocky Raccoon is photographed surveying her domain with one of her ladies in waiting. 
I was thinking very negatively about both the trail and myself this morning  and seriously considering quitting. It only got worse when we got to Rockfish Gap. The popcorn/hotdog van was closed today. The vendor is always friendly and cheerful and his customers frequently offer rides into town. Instead we had to walk uphill another quarter mile to the welcome center. Stepping into the air conditioning partially revived me. The welcome man provided us with a map of Waynesboro and a list of angels who shuttle people into town free!  We lucked out with Glenn Martin who pulled up in a matter of minutes in a sparkling SUV with air conditioning to the max.   Such a little thing but what a mood changer for me. We stopped at Rockfish Gap Outfitters.  I was sufficiently revived that I picked up three single portion freeze dried dinners, meaning that I intend to hike on. I also bought five aluminum “groundhog” tent stakes to replace my titanium v-stakes that were bent beyond utility. The new ones should withstand being pounded into the ground with a heavy rock. And I picked up my new Exped Ultra 1R air mattress with an inflation bag. 
Glenn drove us to the Quality Inn and we were warmly welcomed. There was no issue about checking in early. There’s a pool so Rocky is happy, a guest laundry center, and a breakfast room, with coffee available all day. While Rocky showered, I inflated my new air pad using the provided bag inflator. It’s much faster than blowing it up by mouth and better for the pad not to be filled with warm moist air. The Exped pad actually holds air. Imagine that!  It weighs five ounces more than my old Thermarest NeoAir Uberlite, but I haven’t had a good night’s sleep since we left Big Meadows. And it doesn’t sound like a bowl of Rice Krispies when I move.  Thoughts of fleeing the trail are rapidly retreating!  
It was Rocky’s turn to do laundry so I’ve caught up posting my journal entries. I apologize to my readers for the delay in posting. Signal strength in the southern district of Shenandoah National Park was very weak. 
It’s 4:00 now, almost time to visit Ming Garden Buffet and the promise of food without end.  No lunch today but I finished the snacks in my canister. Except for an ounce of beef jerky and some electrolyte packets, it’s empty. Nothing so sad as an empty cookie jar, right?
What can I say about Ming’s?  It’s a favorite of both townspeople and hikers. I could criticize each and every dish I sampled. Yes, the sushi rice was mushy and the rolls lacked textural and flavor contrasts. Yes, the sauces on at least half a dozen of the dishes were similarly cloying and lackluster. Chinese buffet dishes are missing “wok breath” by not being served immediately. But that’s missing the point. 
We go to Ming’s not for the singular excellence of the food but as cattle to the finishing feedlot provided all the corn they can eat. I could practically feel my muscles marbleizing. Row after row of steamer trays of food continental in scope, from Japanese sushi and teppanyaki to food from all regions of China, to American specialities and a salad bar, all replenished instantly. Soft-serve ice cream, yards of gooey pastries and cookies, fresh ripe fruit. Drops of spillage from serving yourself are instantly removed so that the buffet is perpetually pristine. Discarded plates are promptly removed. I started with appetizers, sushi and soup and then moved on to more serious eating. After two plates of Chinese, I enjoyed a salad as a palate cleanser and allowed a final plate of seafood wonders to push me perilously close to food coma. Dessert for me was fresh melon and one decadent pastry square. Walking back to the Quality Inn, uphill in part, was slow and painful. I collapsed into bed and didn’t dream about food. 
I awoke to find my new sleeping pad still firmly inflated and my soul refreshed by gluttony. Tomorrow I’ll be ready to hike again, but today dawns as a zero day!","Calf Mountain Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657385,"Breakfast at the Quality Inn was adequate, especially after last night’s pig-out. Rocky joined me on a trek to the Krogers for me to reprovision for the five days down to US Rt 60 and Lexington. She’s so good at finding things!  Then I found my courage and walked over to Shifletts Barber Shop. It’s a five chair shop, but times are hard and it’s just Marsha Henderson now. She’s been cutting hair for over 30 years and does things her way. I haven’t had a part in my hair in decades but now I do. She’s intensely Covid conscious, allowing only one masked customer in her shop at the time. She trimmed my beard but I had to whack at my mustache at the other end of the shop. I’m used to paying $60 to my “hair artist” Nathan back home. Here it’s $15 including old-fashioned hair lotion.  I smell pretty like a day hiker.  What a bargain!
Marsha recommended Stella, Bella & Lucy’s restaurant for lunch. It’s named after the original owners’ dogs and is filled with old stuff and very popular with locals. Not a hiker to be seen but with my new haircut, I pass.  I found what I was craving — a triple cheese grilled cheese and a cup of their housemade tomato soup. It was perfection and perhaps the best unsweetened iced tea I’ve ever had. 
I also stopped by the Historical Society that I enjoyed so much in a previous visit to Waynesboro. They have a new exhibit on the digging of a rail tunnel through Afton Mountain in antebellum days. The engineer was Claudius Crozet who served under Napoleon, moved to the U.S. and taught at West Point before becoming Chief Engineer of the Virginia Board of Public Works. The nearby town of Crozet, Virginia is named after him and features prominently in the mystery novels of Rita Mae Brown. (Didn’t you always wonder about that?)  The laborers for the tunnel  were mostly enslaved African Americans and Irish. The latter were preferred as more expendable since owners didn’t have to be compensated for their loss. Recently the tunnel reopened as a tourist attraction and visitors can walk through it. 
I also bought some glue at Krogers. The toe caps are coming loose on my hiking shoes. 
Now it’s time for a long soak in the tub, something I never do at home!  Rocky is lounging poolside. 
I’ve eaten at Green Leaf Grill once before and it was excellent. Tonight climbed the superlative scale. It’s a classic San Francisco-style bistro, almost too loud but not quite, even with live guitar and singing. I started with a dry Hendrix martini, straight up and a cup of their gumbo that would rival anything I have had in New Orleans. Rocky and I shared a baked Brie swimming in a pool of raspberry pepper sauce surrounded by toasted Pita points. We inhaled it, with one extra point that we fought over. They make all of their own vinaigrettes and the two we tried were worthy of bottled sales. I had the potato-coated rockfish that was sautéed with a potato crumb coating, not gross chips, jasmine rice cooked perfectly, and sautéed branched green beans. My cousin had the gumbo entrée  and was entranced by their house baked sour dough bread.  A nice New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc paired perfectly for me. Rocky had a wheat beer, never my choice. They still have their cheesecake with expresso sauce on the menu, but there was no way we could manage it.  Our loss.
It is amazing how a good zero day and especially a superlative meal completely changes my mood. I am so shallow!

The first section was Harpers Ferry to Front Royal, the second was Shenandoah National Park, and the third began today, Waynesboro to US 60, Lexington. 
Rocky and I went down to meet our shuttle driver about 30 minutes early, which was right on time.  I no sooner returned our key cards than DuBose Egleston pulled up in his yellow truck. He looked familiar and once we put our packs in the back of the king cab pickup truck and got in, we recognized DuBose from last year. It’s a new truck but already made to home by a surfeit of empty fast food bags and drink containers. DuBose is a large man and delights in talking about his life and business. Bush hogs figure prominently in his monologue. I felt a little guilty leaving Rocky to his wiles when I got out at Rockfish Gap, but she survived him alone last year. 
I started hiking just after 10 and lallygagged the 4.8 miles to Paul Wolfe Shelter in 2 hours.  I passed the ruins of the W.J. Mayo Homeplace and the Lowe Family Cemetery on the way and spent a little time pondering on the folks who lived in these hills long before the Appalachian Trail and the Blue Ridge Parkway came through. It seems so pristine and peaceful but I imagine these lands were extensively logged and served as pasture lands. What do I know?  
Paul Wolfe is a lovely shelter, but I found a tent site below the shelter that is even lovelier, near perfection in being level, well shaded and partially hidden from passing day hikers on this Labor Day weekend. It’s just 2:30 and already three flip-flop thru-hikers and two section hikers are in for the night. Below me is Mill Creek. There’s  the sound of babbling water and a gentle breeze stirring the leaves, the temperature feels about 70* under partly cloudy skies. What more could I want?  I filled my water bladder, had lunch, rinsed out my t-shirt and wiped myself off using my headband as a sponge. The only question facing me now is whether to spend the next few hours reading or napping. Maybe a bit of both.

So I awoke early, about 5:00 and ended up waiting until 6:45 for it to be light enough to hike. My day started with a 2,000’ climb up Humpback Mountain. The trail was well constructed, more dirt than rock, and most of the ascent was gradual until close to the summit.  I saw two 4 to 5’ black snakes crossing the trail and managed to photograph one. Kate from Worcester, MA and I shared a snack break on the summit. She returned to the parking area north of the summit while I continued southbound. The descent was on mostly rocky trail, making for slow going, until Three Ridges Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Then it was level dirt to Reed’s Gap and then a final 500’ climb and descent. This was the only up that bothered me, coming at the end of a 16 mile day, my longest yet. Rain was threatening all afternoon but held off until I got into Maupin Field Shelter. I prefer tenting to sheltering, but not in the rain.  The water source is a stream behind the shelter. The water is low, but there was one good pool for scooping.

She is from Sparta, NC, in the far northwest of the state, near Fancy Gap, VA. Susan works as a nurse and hikes short sections as time permits. Her current section completes the Appalachian Trail south of Harpers Ferry for her. I enjoyed her company. 
I didn’t leave the shelter this morning until nearly 7:45. After yesterday’s 16 miles, my legs were tired this morning for the climb of Three Ridges.  The trail going up the mountain was mostly dirt and well-graded.  Near the rocky summit, I met a fourth year med student from UNC-Chapel Hill and her friend who is applying to med school. They were going northbound. The descent of Three Ridges was extremely rocky and even difficult in places. My tired body did not appreciate it and I moved very slowly and carefully. The rocks gave way to dirt the final mile before Harper Creek Shelter. It didn’t help that I was walking in cloud for most of the morning, so that everything was covered in fine mist including the rocks. I arrived at noon, exhausted.  In prior years, I would hike from Maupin Field Shelter up and over Three Ridges and end the day at the Priest Shelter after a 3,000’ climb, but I don’t seem capable of that anymore. Instead of getting stronger, I seem to be running out of energy earlier each day. 
Two flip-flippers, Goose and Gander, who I had seen the past two nights were finishing their lunch when I arrived. They hiked on so I won’t be seeing them again. As for me, Brother Ass has sat down and isn’t inclined to move more today.

No one else has come in and once again it’s a mouse-free shelter.  Someone has carried in a case of Natural Lite Beer and it sits in the corner.  Perhaps if it were a better beer, I would try cooling a couple of cans in Harpers Creek, but it isn’t worth the effort for Natural Lite. Besides the creek is very low and not very cool.  The thought of warm Natural Lite is unappealing.","Maupin Field Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657589,"It started raining steadily at 7PM last night and continued, heavily at times, until 2AM. There was no thunder so I slept well except for the occasional crashing of tree limbs in the woods, making me glad that I hadn’t tented. Even with napping yesterday afternoon and a good night’s sleep, I awoke feeling less than hikeworthy.  Nothing in specific hurts, not even my knees, but my muscles are just tired. 
I started at first light hoping to get the 3,000’ climb of the Priest over with early. But first I had to hike the gentle dirt trail downhill 2.5 miles to the Tye River. There’s a suspension bridge over the river and the bouncing of the bridge almost cost me my breakfast!  On the other side is a very minor state road and a trail parking area. Four people intending to hike were standing around a sad and bedraggled beagle hound. They witnessed a car hitting the dog. The driver stopped and then drove on. The dog had a heavy leather collar embossed with the name and phone number of his owner, but naturally there is no signal there. The one man offered the dog water, but the dog was uninterested and appears to be in shock and may have internal injuries. The man kind of shrugged and prepared to start his day hike, leaving the three ladies and me. Two of them, orthodontists from Harrisonburg who are training for a trek in Bhutan, left on their hike over Three Ridges to Reed’s Gap where they had left a second car. One of them gave the keys to her car to the third lady, Beverly, who offered to get the dog to veterinary care instead of hiking. Beverly looked lost. Feeling the way I was and seriously doubting whether I was capable of climbing up the Priest and continuing my hike, I offered to help Beverly. 
My period of indecision was ended. My hike was over. I didn’t feel sad but relieved. Brother Ass is too old for multi week hikes anymore. I should have realized it several years ago, but my knees stopped me before the other physical limitations caught up to me. The intensive training before this hike, especially the impact training to strengthen my knees, worked well. I was walking 8-10 miles most days in full pack. So I started this hike feeling strong and fully prepared. Three weeks in, without pushing distances, I should have been on the cusp of being a hiking machine. Instead I found myself growing weaker each day and questioning my ability to climb each mountain. It was time, and thanks to an injured beagle, I acknowledged it. 
The car, now dog ambulance, was a shiny new Audi Quattro and Beverly wasn’t sure she could drive it but since it was her friend’s she felt like she had to. We loaded the beagle into the front passenger wheel well as gently as we could. He curled up and just looked at us with those intensely sad beagle brown eyes, obviously in some pain. Once we figured out how to start the car and put it in reverse, we proceeded east to US 15 and north a short way, parking at the Nelson County Visitors Center. We both had cell phone service there. 
First we tried calling the number on the dog’s collar. Out of service. Then we Googled for a veterinarian.  They can’t treat an animal unless you are the owner. We called the Nelson County Animal Control Services and got a recording. Out of desperation, Beverly called 911 and the operator was a dog lover. She took Beverly’s name and number and in a few minutes called back. She had reached Animal Control who in situations like this becomes the de facto owner and can authorize veterinary treatment. She told us the veterinary clinic to take the dog too. It ended up being a mere 100 yards down the highway. Because of their Covid protocol, we had to phone in and a veterinary tech came out and, after muzzling the dog for safety, cradled the dog in her arms with amazing gentleness and strength . I opened the door of the clinic for her and that’s the last we saw of the beagle. The tech promised that they would treat him and make every effort to find his owner. 
Now Beverly was absent one beagle but still had a dirty hiker in her friend’s car. I say dirty because I was but not dirty and smelly. I had sponged myself off the previous afternoon and rinsed my clothing out. They were still wet when I put them on in the morning but had dried by the time I got to the trailhead.  It was a beautiful sunny day, by the way, so I didn’t quit on a rainy day!  Beverly was planning to drive the car back to the Priest trailhead and wait for her friends to complete their hike and drive back. I suggested that Beverly instead park at Reed’s Gap. She grasped the plan immediately and realized that she could then hike in and meet her friends!  That meant driving north about 30 miles to Charlottesville, taking I-64 to Rockfish Gap and driving a short distance south on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Conveniently, almost like it was planned, I had a ride to Charlottesville and could fly home the next day. 
As we drove, I brought up the IHG app on my phone, the parent company of Holiday Inn. I have lots of membership points and anticipated a free night. But the app wouldn’t take me to the login screen. I tried accessing it through Safari with the same results. By then we were on the Charlottesville bypass and seeing airport signs. Beverly noticed a Holiday Inn on a lodging information sign and here I am. It turns out that IHG’s website has crashed and been broken for over a day. The front desk was crippled. They wouldn’t have a room available until after noon, so I camped out in their lobby and ate trail snacks and availed myself of their lemon water. 
Shortly after noon, the desk clerk motioned me over. The system was still down so I couldn’t use my points. I didn’t care and gladly paid for a room. Their restaurant wouldn’t open until 5:00, so I ate a trail lunch of pepperoni on tortilla in my room.  The hotel has an airport shuttle and I’m booked for 10:00. My flight on Delta leaves a little after 1:00 and after changing planes at LaGuardia, I’ll be home in Burlington before 6:00. One reason I like Holiday Inn is that they usually have a guest laundry. So I’ll be traveling home clean.  The menu in the bar/restaurant was a joke but the Devil’s Backbone Vienna Lager was quite good. The green salad was fresh and the steak edible. What more could I ask for?  Well, maybe an IPA instead of a lager but that wasn’t an option.","Harpers Creek Shelter

Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657851,"The good news is that I phoned the veterinary clinic in Lovingston, Virginia. The beagle has been released to Nelson County Animal Control so presumably is doing fine. I hope they can find his people!  At any rate, they should have no trouble finding a home for a hunting beagle in rural Virginia. 
I visited the doctor’s office today. The most likely diagnosis for my bilateral lower leg pain is chronic exertional compartment syndrome. I’ve been referred to the sports medicine clinic in orthopedics at University of Vermont Healthcare. Getting in to see them can take two or three months. Meanwhile, I can do whatever I want but I should stop short of the pain. CECS is caused by the swelling of a muscle constrained by inflexible fascia — think silver skin on a pork tenderloin — causing pressure to increase on arteries and/or nerves within an intramuscular compartment. It only hurts when I move and particularly when I walk uphill. 
So now I start walking alongside the medical mill race of diagnostic testing (imaging and pressure measurement) and then treatment options that range from usually ineffective physical therapy to questionable Botox injections to usually effective surgical fasciotomy and try to avoid being crushed beneath the waterwheel.  At some point, how badly I want to backpack will become the question.  And who knows, maybe the clinic will find another cause that is easier to treat. 
In the meantime, my gear is cleaned and safely stored away. I’ll be ready to try a thru-hike once again after this little setback is dealt with. I am not a patient person but I have no choice but to act like one.",,View Entry,"Sep 13, Tue",0
Sugarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658914,"Does anyone remember the arcade game, Whac-a-Mole?  I lack the eye-hand coordination to play arcade games and even gave up on computer games back in the ancient days of Pong and Space Invaders.  But i liked watching others play Whac-A-Mole, particularly enjoying the thwack-thwack sound of the mallet bashing down on moles’ heads and the utter futility of trying to defeat them.  I always thought the moles looked more like gophers, but either way they struck me as bash-worthy.  So long as it was others doing the bashing, my pacifism wouldn’t be called into question.  The game has popped into my head lately, but I seem to be playing the dual role of basher and mole.  It’s a fair analogy for aging.  Medical problems seem to pop up with increasing frequency.  As soon as one is bashed down, another pops up to be dealt with.  Is there no end until I end? 
Ten years ago, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Whac!  After a year of diagnosis and studies, I elected surgery, and beat the hell out of that mole.  After 22 years since the first diagnosis of osteoarthritis of my knees, Whac!  Total knee replacements.  Three years later, I have that beat too.  On this hike, my knees didn’t complain at all.  But then another mole popped up in the form of a burning sensation in the backs of my calves.  It’s too early to claim another WHAC! but I have been looking at flight schedules between Burlington and Charlottesville.  
My primary care doctor’s PA ordered a vascular study on my legs.  It was normal.  I had X-rays before meeting with the sports medicine doctor.  He was very nice and eliminated what I had been fearing, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, as well as medial tibial stress syndrome and stress fracture.  That left him to suggest muscle and tendon origin or possibly nerve entrapment.  He’s ordered an MRI to clarify things, but that will take another month.  Meanwhile, he’s referred me to physical therapy, and in that, showed great genius.
The physical therapist I had been using took a position with The Veterans Administration, so I chose a practice within walking distance of our condo.  They assigned me to a young DPT named Harry.  He lacks a scar on his forehead and doesn’t carry a wand, but he has proven to be magical.  Within twenty minutes of excellent questions and poking and probing and contorting me, he eliminated spinal involvement and managed to recreate the pain in my calves that drove me off the trail.  Recreating the pain allowed him to diagnose it as relating to the sciatic nerves, probably caused by the shrinkage of the nerves during the inactivity following my knee replacements.  He prescribed a supine sciatic nerve glide exercise, which seems too simple to achieve anything.  I wanted something difficult, something noble, like surgery, that would be done to me and banish the pain forever.  
Do you remember the story of Naaman, in 2 Kings?  He was supposedly a very successful commander in the army of Aram, a Syrian king, and was amply rewarded with riches and power  He had everything, including leprosy, which he would have preferred not to have had.  His wife’s Hebrew servant told her about a prophet in Israel, Elisha, who could cure leprosy.   So Naaman and his army rode into Israel to see the great prophet, freaking out King Joram of Israel along the way.  Elisha couldn’t be bothered with seeing Naaman and sent word that all he had to do was dip himself seven times in the Jordon River.  Naaman exploded with rage.  He was prepared to enter into a hero’s journey to prove his worthiness to be healed.  He would slay any dragon that Elisha wished or quest for the golden fleece or ring of power.  Telling him to go take a bath was insulting.   Nevertheless, Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordon and was cleansed of his leprosy and perhaps a bit of his hubris.  
And so it came to pass that on the third day of doing Harry’s exercise, my pain vanished and has yet to recur.  Harry also evaluated my gait and found issues.  Probably as an accomodation to my bum knees, I had gotten in the habit of relying mostly on my leg muscles in walking and underutilized the various gluteus muscles around my hip.  My leg muscles are strong, but my glutes are weak.  Harry prescribed additional exercises and stretches.  I’ve seen him twice now and am booked weekly through the end of the year.  I can already feel a difference in my walking.  Adding Harry’s exercises to my regular stretching, foam rolling, and abs has me spending an hour before I even leave the condo for walking and the Y.  Harry is limiting me to five miles except for non-Y days when I’m allowed eight and wants me to stay on the bike path, avoid trails and hills other than the ones necessary to get me back home.  It’s good to be retired and have the luxury of spending three or four hours a day exercising!  
If all continues well with Harry, my plan is to fly down to Charlottesville the first week of April and hike north from Rockfish Gap to Katahdin.  This will give me 285 miles of relatively easy trail before the rocks of Pennsylvania.  Then I’ll return to Rockfish Gap for the southern section.  I’ll start a new journal in January.  Perhaps one of my readers will start a pool for how far I will get this time.  My husband Tom is fully supportive, partly I think because he really doesn’t expect me to be away for six months.  My track record for attempted thru-hikes is not good.  This time will be different.  There are some things that do not diminish with age, self-delusion being one of them.",,View Entry,"Oct 21, Fri",0
