Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/309092,"Still trying to settle on a sleeping system for a late Spring section hike along the A.T.. Bought a 1-1/2 lb poncho liner to try as a replacement for a 3 lb sleeping bag. Decided to hold a dress rehearsal in the backyard.""Hiked"" the loaded pack to the backyard about 10 p.m.. Using the mini LED headlight, setup the GT lightweight travel hammock and Slap Strap micros. Rigged the camo tarp above the hammock and staked the corners down. Put the foam pad into the hammock; inflated the travel pillow and tucked between tarp and tarp line; and covered the hammock with the poncho liner.Bear bagged the food bag using the PCT technique and a low hanging branch on the apple tree. Not high enough for bears, but safe from rodents, possums, and the family dog. Clipped the largely empty backpack to the head end of the hammock to get it off the ground.Sat on the hammock and donned our long underwear over our shorts and t-shirt. Placed our shoes under the hammock and laid down. Tucked a corner of the poncho liner under the foot end of the pad and pulled it snug. Material was hanging and touching the ground. Decided to tuck the extra material on the sides under the foam pad as well. Was comfortably warm and went to sleep.Awoke about four or five in the morning. 8 mph winds were lifting the tarp and blowing across the top of the poncho liner. Could feel the heat leaving the enclosed space. Also, noted our pad had slipped and was now hanging over the hammock and beyond the tarp. Got out; replaced the foam pad; and re-staked the tarp closer to the hammock and ground. Also swung the backpack under the hammock and fastened the waist belt over the hammock to help keep the pack out of any rain. Went back to sleep after re-tucking the poncho liner.Awoke after sunrise to rain hitting the tarp. Snivel meter read 54F. We were comfortable. Checked for rain penetration. Inside of tarp was dry, as were the hammock, pad, and poncho liner. Decided to practice breaking camp in the rain. Retrieved the backpack. Stuffed the poncho liner into a compression bag and packed it away. Rolled up the foam pad and placed next to pack. Grabbed the hammock system stuff sack and stuffed the hammock and the two Slap Strap micros. Decided to leave the tarp and food bag hung until they had a chance to air dry. Has this been an actual long distance hike, we could have packed up while keeping everything critical dry.Other than buying a new foam pad to cut down to fit the hammock, we are done acquiring and testing gear. We've settled on our cooking system: vintage aluminum pot w/lid and handle; super cat alcohol stove, spork, and cup. Plan to just boil water and use freezer bag cooking for breakfast and supper. While monitoring the weather, we'll plan our meals and start shopping for food.Next weekends forecast is for three days of rain. May decide to practice setting up camp in the rain. Need to make mistakes now and not later on the trail, away from the safety of home and hearth.",,Backyard Shakedown,"May 09, Sun",0
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/309181,"Have started acquiring food for the fast approaching section hike. We are content to eat the same things for breakfast and lunch for weeks on end, so menu planning will largely revolve around supper.For breakfast we plan to consume two packets of apple & cinnamon instant oatmeal, 1/2 packet of freeze dried apples (mixed with the oatmeal), two large fig bars, and some fortified hot chocolate. Sometimes we'll also nibble leftovers from the previous day, such as trail mix and pepperoni slices.Lunch is a mix of quick snack items: trail mix, fruit slices candy, pepperoni slices, cheese sticks, and sugar sweetened lemonade. Lunch starts shortly after breakfast and ends at supper time. We'll take a mid-day rest break to mix and consume the lemonade with some meat and cheese. Should be no shortage of scenic vistas to pause at the first week out.For supper, we almost always start with pork ramen soup as it helps us rehydrate and replaces needed salt. We add dehydrated peppers and onions to our soup to add flavor and some vegetables. If you read my Section Hiking the Appalachian Trail, blog you know that I plan at least one Mexican night with back bean burritos and vegetarian chili. We may also try a Cajun night with dirty rice and spicy meat stick subbing for andouie sausage. We like tuna, so will try to have tuna at least twice the first week and likely more the second. Office personnel have donated mayo, salt, and pepper packets for the trip, so tuna salad will be easy to make. We also enjoy tuna and rice with butter, salt, and pepper. We're testing instant cheese mashed potatoes with diced beef and cheese sticks this week at the office. We'll see if the idea tastes as good as we imagine.We'll also add some instant banana and chocolate pudding pre-mixed with powdered milk - just add water. May split some freeze dried bananas among two pudding bags. We also down a cup of soothing warm tea after dinner, again to help with hydration.Would really like to get the menu down on paper so we can pack carefully and eliminate excess weight and free valuable pack space. Its gonna' be tight, but if we go with the poncho liner, then we should be able to use the small pack and still carry 5 days food. That should get us to our first resupply at Henicle's Market and then to Carlisle/Duncannon for our second resupply.",,Menu Planning,"May 10, Mon",0
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/309525,"Took my small backpack to the shoe repair shop across the street from the office. Asked to get two FastTab 6's sewn atop the flip over pocket for attaching the tarp and pad horizontaly. Cost $12 plus tax. Promised the pack will be ready Tuesday. A friend familiar with the business mentioned that ""Tuesday"" may mean what ""Domani"" means in Italian - don't show up expecting it done when promised.Meanwhile we have made a list of final preparations:HaircutBuy foodPack foodPick up packBankOffice vacation paperworkMow lawn10-day weather reportPack upMcDonalds (breakfast)Purchasing gear is all but over. Our wallet list shows only emergency bivy ($11), body glide ($6), and keychain strobe/flashlight/whistle ($5).Menu planning is almost complete. After buying tuna packets, genoa salami, and beef and cheese sticks this past weekend, we seem to already have most of our first week's food on hand. Hope our grocer still has the Disney freeze dried apples in stock.The big unknown today is the weather for the first 8-10 days. We're trying to go very light with a poncho liner instead of a 40F sleeping bag. Any night time temps below 50F and we'll dump the ultralight pack and poncho liner in favor of ""Big Blue"" and the 40F bag, an automatic 5 lb penalty.",,Final Preparations,"May 11, Tue",0
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/311988,"I have arrived in Washington D.C. I have my MARC ticket. I'm set to go to Harper's Ferry. It's been an uneventful trip, except that when I hit Charlottesville, VA, a young guy got on the bus behind me with a pair of hiking poles. Turns out he's a 'through hiker.' He's been hiking since Springer Mountain, GA to Charlottesville. He's on his way home to take care of some emergency involving his dad. Kinda gave me some more lowdown and everything. His trail name is 'Low Key.' He seems to be a really nice guy from Massachusetts. Anyway, I'm hanging out in front of the National Capitol in the shade. I'm having some refreshment. The train leaves at 5 to 5. I'll try and do another update a little bit later tonight once I get to Harper's Ferry. I talked to the outfitter on the phone before I left, and I can't spend the night on the back porch. So, I'll probably be stealth camping along the C and O Canal a little bit north of town.
Update: Hiked two miles up the C&O canal to the free Huckleberry Hill Hike & Bike camp. Had the site to myself. Trail to and from is level with a good surface.","Little Rock, AR

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/314440,"Left the Huckleberry Hill Hike & Bike camp about 9:00 a.m.. Met a group of bikers on recumbent bikes after about 1/2 mile. Got to Harpers Ferry again at about 10:00 a.m. Planned to depart Harpers Ferry about noon after cheking in with ATC office and buying fuel at the Outfitter.Found the AT trail south at the bottom of Union Street and decided to follow it to the blue blaze trail to the ATC office. Steep climb up stone steps from Union Street. Passed the Catholic Church and found myself at Jefferson Rock. Some Japanese tourists were there and we had a short talk on the trail. Continued up the trail and then down to the Shenandoah River bridge. Oops! Somewhere we missed the blue blaze trail to ATC. Saw the Comfort Inn and a road just to my right and decided to backtrack up a smoother and ""shorter"" road. Nope. Road route is longer and hotter.Dropped my pack on the ATC porch. As a volunteer was taking pictures of thru hikers for the 2010 album, I got my section hiker photo taken for AT posterity. BigHodag from Little Rock, AR is section hiker 84 for 2010. Bought a cold soda and an AT patch. Met a few thru hikers that I would end up seeing again a few days later (RoboJesus & Patches, RiverDog, Lil Dipper, Redwing, Veggie).Went down Union Street to the Outfitter to get some fuel. Bought a pop bottle full of denatured alcohol for about $5.00 plus a wee bit for ""the governor."" Great little store. Saw a full display of Grand Trunk hammocks like mine right by the register.Continued on down Union Street to the Cannonball Deli, located about in the basement of a building just about even with the train station. Ordered a cheese steak to go from a great Russian immigrant and his girlfriend. Thought I was undercharged, but was surprised to discover that hikers receive a 10% discount on their food orders. Spaseba!Crossed the train bridge back into Maryland at about 12:30 p.m.. Hiked east along the Potomac River to a clearing just before the turn North and the climb up to Weverton Cliff. Workers have cleared a wide grassy area and cut some trees down. Several stumps were conveniently positioned as ""chairs"". I then realized that I had made a novice mistake of not cameling up on pure water back in Harpers Ferry. I had a quart and a few swallows to get to the Garvey Shelter. Decided to fill up the second bottle from the Potomac, which was easily accessible here, but brown and muddy. Used my hankie to filter most of the mud out and dropped some iodine in to start the water ""cooking"". Also, decided this was a good time to doff the boots and socks and have a foot check. Found one small blister and quickly applied moleskin to it. This was also my planned lunch stop, so we ate half of our cheese steak. Left the river about 2:30 p.m.Shortly after our lunch break the AT took a hard left and crossed the railraod tracks and entered a road/parking area. Found the trail in the brush across the street and started a modest rise up and away from the river. This section came out at the new parking area at the foot of the Weverton Trail. While taking a quick five and sitting on the guard rail, some teens popped out of the woods across the street. Asked if any had leftover water to top off my bottle of pure water. One gave me about a pint. Not quite true trail magic, but he was a trail angel to me at that moment.Water problems resolved, we crossed the street and passed under a very busy highway. I noted a flowing creek at the bottom of a steep embankment under the bridge. Always good to know when the last time you passed water and where.Just after the bridge the trail became very rocky and steep with switchbacks. Not having trail legs yet, this was a tough section for me. Rounding a switchback, we'd pause, catch our breath and sip some water. Made it to the Weverton Cliff side trail at about 5:00. Just as I got there, ""Bloomer"" showed up, sunk his poles on the side of the AT and dropped his pack. I did the same and we ventured down to the cliff about 100 yards down the hill. Great view from the rocks of the Potomac River. Took a picture of Blommer for him and he did the same for me. Struggled back up the hill and donned a pack that I would rather not be carrying anymore.My original plan was to RON (remain overnight) at Crampton Gap, but it was clear that I was too tired and moving too slow to make Crampton Gap. Decided to settle for the closer Ed Garvey shelter. About 7 we staggered in to the Garvey area and rounded the shelter expecting to see Bloomer and RoboJesus who had passed us after Weverton Cliff. Instead, we found Seeker, a solo female sectioning South to Harpers Ferry. Dropped the pack and started heating water for dinner. Didn't have much of an appetite as I thought I would so just had some soup and called it a night.Pitched my hammock behind the Garvey shelter. Hung my food bag in the shelter with the others as no one expected bears in this area. Patches the trail dog was also on duty.Had a restless time trying to fall asleep. We were having cramps in out thighs and calves. Fortunately, we were able to sit on the side of our hammock and rock until the cramps went away. Sometime after we passed out until after daylight.Thus ended our first day on the AT.","Harper's Ferry, WV

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/312291,"From TrailPhone:""I made it to the Garvey Shelter yesterday after about a 10 mile day. I hiked a little bit more in the morning in and around Harper's Ferry than I had planned. I'm going to leave here about 9 local. I'm headed north. I'm going to try to make it to Dahlgren Camp for a shower and a little bit of R&R there. If I tucker out again, I may stop short at Rocky Run.Right now, I'm about 3 to 4 hours behind, definitely 4 miles short. I'm doing well. I met a couple of great 'through hikers' yesterday, including Patches the dog. I got some really bad leg cramps last night. I was cramping up coming into camp. I'm having a little problem not managing water and salt, but I think I will get it all figured out in the next day or two. I've got a big water source about 4 miles up. I just going to tank up like a camel.""UPDATE: Left the Garvey Shelter around 9 a.m.. Seemed to be the last hiker out. After breakfast I had only about a pint of water left to get me down the trail to the next water source. As the spring at Garvey is .4 miles downhill and .4 miles back up a steep climb, I decided to tough it out and head for Gathland state park.Hiking down into Gathland SP, my left knee began to ache and I became a bit worried that my section hike might soon end. Fortunately, the ache went away and never returned the entire trip.I was very glad when Gathland SP came into view. I had been planning to get a soda to help get some salt into the body. The trail in Gathland SP comes down past the restrooms and two soda machines in the front. I dropped my pack on the nearby bench around a tree and prepared to get a soda. Two hikers already there informed me that the machine on the left was totally inop and the one on the right would accept and return money only. So, we filled out water bottles and after a short break, headed across the street, photographed the War Correspondents Memorial, and pushed on up the hill into the forest.Just before dark, we made it down the hill into the Rocky Run Shelter area. There was a signpost pointing to the side trail to the shelter, but there was two trails. We took the trail to the left and about halfway down noted a shelter and people across a creek. We back tracked a bit thinking we had missed a turn on the blue blazed side trail. Nope. We were on the trail, so we continued on. We soon found ourselves at the abandoned Rocky Run Shelter with a partially rotted wood swing and partially rotted deck. We dumped our pack onto the shelter floor and decided this was the place. Done. I ain't moving. We quickly located two trees and hung our hammock beside the shelter. Dug out the food bag and cook kit and made some hot mashed potatoes and soup. Bear gagged our food on a convenient bear line and called it a day.One of the hikers across the way came over to use the piped spring. The spring was on the opposite side of the shelter and water was just gushing from the pipe as if it were a broken water line.Thus ended the second day.","Ed Garvey Shelter, MD

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/312392,"From TrailPhone:""Hey. It's 9 o'clock eastern time. I'm at the Dog Run Backpack group camp. I'm going to take about 30 minutes to shower and head on up the trail. Pounded out 10 miles yesterday to Rocky Run Shelter. My left knee was causing me a little problem. Seems to be a little better with walking today. I was really dehydrated last night and this morning. I didn't really feel like eating. I've choked down 2 liters of water last night, another 1 or 2 this morning. If I stop early, I'm going to stop at Pine Knob Shelter. Depending on how I feel at Pine Knob, I may go ahead and press on to the Pogo Campsite, but I'm not going any further than Pogo today. Other than that, it's been a beautiful day. Getting up early really came good yesterday. The high was 92, had a heat index of probably close to 100. I really should not have been hiking. Probably explains why I'm feeling kind of miserable, but I'm seeing some interesting stuff, a lot of frogs. I saw my first snake yesterday, a little black snake, 6 inches long, a little dot behind it's head. It looked poisonous, but other than that, things are going well. Bye bye.""UPDATE: Got up about 7 a.m. and started breaking camp and fixing breakfast. Ate some oatmeal with freeze dried apples. Still couldn't stomach eating the Fig Newtons I would normally eat at the office. Left Rocky Run about 8 a.m.About 9, we entered the Dahlgren Backpack Camp Ground. Found the mens room and enjoyed a long hot shower and shampoo. We even ""did laundry"" by rinsing out our t-shirt and shorts. We attempted to shave with just water as a lubricant and managed to start what later became an ingrown hair. After showering, we met ""Veggie"" a female AT soloist and vegetarian.Around 10 a.m. we had reached the Gap where Dahlgren Chapel and the Mansion Inn stand. Took some requisite photos and resumed our hike along very level and rock free trails.About noon, we found ourself entering into Washing Monument SP. After a short walk uphill to the museum and monument parking area, we took a short break and sat on the low stone wall fronting the parking area. Big mistake. Not only did we embed numerous tiny evergreen bits into our t-shirt and back, but we also maneged to embed the same in the pad on our backpack. Even removing our shirt and buffing our back brought little relief.We topped off our water bottles and ascended up the gravel trail to the monument, which also is a section of the AT. The sun was now nearly overhead, but we found some shade on the view side of the monument, doffed our pack and had our scheduled lunch break. Today we enjoyed a packet of tuna in oil to which we added a packets of mayonnaise, salt, and pepper. The extra salt and mayo was a blessing and we repeatedly thanked those office personnel who graciously donated their condiments. After lunch we took a quick trip up the tower and took yet another requisite photo of the view.From the park, the trail begins a sharp downhill with large water bars. Sometime around 2 p.m. we were feeling the effects of the heat and decided to pull off to the side, pitch our hammock and take a nap. We awoke around 3:30 pm. just in time for visitors. First, the volunteer PATC trail patrol was on their return leg. (We saw them at the water faucet while resting on the wall in the park, but didn't recognize who they were.) They asked about my water status and if I knew where water sources were. I showed them my elevation sheet with water holes highlighted green. I told the patrol I planned to stop just across I-70 at the next shelter. Then, Lil Dipper and Redwing passed by and the patrol recommended we overnight at Annapolis Rocks and cook dinner while watching sunset from the rocks.I ambled on down the trail and popped out of the woods facing a pair of homes with a man riding back and forth cutting grass. Where was the trail? No blazes to the right or left, no marks on the pavement and none of the trees on my side indicated a turn. Curious... The I saw the blaze across the street. The AT ran between the two homes between two garden borders. At the rear of the homes, the trail took a sudden left turn down wooden steps made from railroad ties. Then a sudden right and we were crossing I-70. I had passed under this very bridge in 1991 when I drove my family from New Jersey to Arkansas following my return from Operation Desert Storm. Today, I was back and headed north with a full pack. As I crossed a car honked their approval and encouragement.Immediately after crossing I-70, I lost the trail once again and found myself in a parking lot. Someone in the lot directed me back towards the bridge I just crossed. The AT circled right and down under the bridge and followed the freeway for about a quarter of a mile. Then up. Lots of up...After a short climb up from I-70, we found the blue blaze trail to the shelter and water. As there was still several hours of daylight and we had no immediate need of water, we continued to climb. Somewhere along the climb we met Josey. Josey was headed to Annapolis Rocks. We jokingly mentioned watching for us and if we didn't arrive to send help. As Josey departed, we continued to climb. Eventually as the skies grew dimmer, the trail flattened and we suddenly found ourselves surprised by a sign announcing the blue blaze trail to Annapolis Rocks. Down! The only problem with ""down"" is that it means ""up"" first thing in the morning. We started down the trail and first found a privy, one of two according to a camp sign. We located the camping area trail and started looking for a good place to hang for the night. Area 5 met our needs and we hastily made camp. Grabbing our food bag, cook set, fuel, and water bottles we headed for the spring and the rocks. The spring was a piped spring with water just gushing our of the hill. Josey was camped just below the spring and the second privy was just downhill and downwind. Josey led the way to the rocks where we both met COB. While COB and Josey enjoyed the sunset, I started water boiling for dinner. We started with hot pork ramen soup and followed with some hot mashed potatoes. We were starting to get an appetite back and ate all the soup and most of the potatoes. We packed up our mess kit and took yet another requisite photo of the sunset. Following COB back up to the camping area, we inquired as to his trail name as COB is a Navy term meaning ""Chief of the Boat"". Nope, COB was a navy guy. His family gave him the name and it stands for ""cranky old bastard."" laughing, I found myself thinking it wouldn't be long and my own family might take to calling me ""COB""Thus ended the third day.","Rocky Run, MD

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/314446,"While we were hoping for an early start from Annapolis Rocks, we were a bit tuckered and got a later start than desired. By the time we had breakfast, refilled water at the spring, used the privy and broke camp, it was already 9 a.m. We started up the blue blaze trail to the AT. Mercifully, it wasn't as far uphill as we thought and soon we were cruising on relatively flat trail.Within the hour the nice smooth flat trail gave way to the Maryland Rocks. The trail had become a small boulder field and we were hoping from rock to rock. Falling wasn't an option as both sides of the trail were home to lush growths of nefarious poison ivy. Good thing we had two hiking poles as we often needed both to maintain balance. Our former rock climbing and chess skills also came into play as we often had to plan three and four moves ahead.Shortly after emerging from the cursed rocks, we spied a solo male southbound hiker. ""Greetings, friend!"" we hailed. ""Top of the morning to you!"" came the reply. As our new acquaintance drew near we were surprised to discover ""Buzzy"", a very senior citizen. Buzzy was hiking with two friends, one of whom was 62. Buzzy stated that he had section hiked from Springer Mountain, GA to Harpers Ferry, WV back in 1996 when he was 74. He was now 87. Dumbfounded, I asked the group to pose for a photo. I warned the threesome of the rocks ahead and we wished each other well.Our last climb of the day was up Raven Rock. Earlier we had thought we had already started our ascent, but had hiked up and over a very steep hill before Raven Rock. Sometime around 8 p.m. we staggered up and over raven Rock looking for the promised blue blaze to the shelter and water. The side trail soon appeared and the sign stated that the shelter was about a half mile down the hill. Nope. Not doing that. Just down the trail was an open area and a group of hikers. Since it looked like plenty of room for both I asked if they minded my hanging nearby. Turns out it was a scout group headed south from PennMar park. They were more than ready to share the space. I set about fixing dinner while I caught my breath and regenerated enough energy to hang the hammock and tarp. After a quick dinner, we made camp and turned in. As we were feeling a bit exhausted and worried that we may have set ourself up for heat stroke,we asked a scout leader to check on us before their bedtime and before departing in the morning. Around 9 p.m., the scout leader checked on us and we replied that we were ""OK"".Thus ended the fifth day.","Annapolis Rocks, MD

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/312920,"From TrailPhone:""Hi. I'm at Pen Mar park on the very extreme edge of northern Maryland. I'm within a half mile of passing into Pennsylvania. I have a gorgeous view of the Old Fort Richie and the town of Cascade. I just found the first working Coke and Pepsi machine in all of Maryland. I can't believe I walked 40 miles for a cold one. I plan to cross into Pennsylvania. I don't know how far I'm going to get tonight. I did 13 miles yesterday from Annapolis Rocks up to Raven Rock. I was absolutely dying when I got in. Thankfully, there was a Boy Scout troop camp there. I had them kind of check on me, make sure I didn't have anything serious going on. But, I'm doing well, no new blisters today. I've got about 4 or 5 small ones, but I'm still pressing on. So, Happy Memorial Day to everybody! I'm flying the Flag on the backpack. I'll see you guys hopefully in a week. That's it.""UPDATE: Shortly after dawn I heard the scoutmaster calling me. I lifted the tarp and said I felt better. ""Thanks for checking on me"" I said. After the scouts had cleared out, I crawled out of my hammock and started my day. First order was breakfast. Boiled some of my water and made some mashed potatoes. I had planned oatmeal with apples, but still had no desire to any any oatmeal. While having breakfast, three guys wandered in looking for some lace to have breakfast. All three were veterans, two marines and one army. They had started early at PennMar. Opening his pack, one marine started handing out boxes of MRE en-trees. I inquired and learned that this was their first long distance hike, but they had no experience save their military experience of lugging large, heavy packs across the desert. I mentioned they could save weight by further unpacking their MREs and leaving the cardboard boxes at home. None had ever seen a hammock camping system and were somewhat envious that I wasn't sleeping on the hard ground. I invited my comrades at arms to examine the hammock nearby.While the guys were having breakfast, I packed up the tarp and hammock and hit the trail. Shortly after leaving the camp site I realized something was missing. There was no hat bouncing off my chest. I had lost my nylon fishing hat either at the camp site or along the way up to Raven Rock. I suspect there was a hat laying on the ground near a log somewhere on the south approach trail as that was the last time I recall seeing the hat. We resolved ourself to the cold fact that sometime later we were going to pay for our oversight with a painful sunburn to our neck and/or ears.Leaving Raven Rock the trail was mercifully undulating and relatively rock free. We soon found a sign and blue blaze trail to High Point. As we will likely never pass this way again, we followed the blue blazes and found ourselves starting at a large outcropping painted gray and overlaid with bright graffiti. While resting on the outcropping and enjoying the scene of Maryland dairy farms, a couple arrived by car. The lady was a school teacher and her husband offered to take my picture. I agreed as when hiking solo there are few opportunities to include oneself in a photo.After the couple departed, we followed the blue blazes back to the AT, ensured that we were facing north and resumed our trek. The trail soon started down and become a boulder field. We again found ourselves using technical rock climbing techniques to negotiate ourself safely down. Shortly after reaching the bottom a small army of scouts in blue t-shirts came marching past us southbound. A few minutes later Josey overtook me. Then, I lost the trail. Josey was wandering ahead of me and asked if I saw the white blazes. I looked around and spotted a series of blazes far to my right. Josey may his way to the trees and we both resumed our hikes.Sometime before noon we started to hear vehicles. As we were scheduled to reach PennMar at about that time, we became enthusiastic. The trail soon widened with a gentle slope upwards - ""tourist trail"" - a good sign. Then a playground with children appeared between the trees to our right. PennMar! Rounding a corner we beheld a large park full of people and activities. Nearby at a picnic table was Josey and another hiker. I asked to join them. We soon discovered that water was available from a large goose-neck faucet in the men's room and there were working Pepsi machines just up the hill at another structure. Off I went to get water and not one, but two 20 oz bottles of Pepsi. Josey and the other hiker departed and we were left to enjoy lunch. We started some water boiling for a hot lunch to enjoy with our Pepsi. While waiting, we made a quick call to TrailPhone and left the above entry. An outdoor wedding was taking place at a nearby pavilion and just as we were about to eat, the minister started saying grace. Perfect timing. After lunch, we repacked and headed off to top off our water as we had a good source of pure water. We spotted a group of five about to start south towards Harpers Ferry and took their photo by the sign pointing to the two terminii in GA and ME.The trail from PennMar was a treat. Wide with gentle downhill. The Mason-Dixon sign was missing so we didn't know exactly when and where we crossed into PA. I suspect the train track was around the border. Crossing the track the trail continued down to a beautiful creek and a wooden bridge, much like Cane Creek SP in Arkansas. Not needing water, we started up the hill on the other side. The trail eventually wound up crossing road. A sign proclaimed two nearby boxed springs. We unclipped our cup and enjoyed some nice cold water straight from the mountain. While resting, we watched a solo hiker come up the same trail and soon met Absent, so named because he had a habit of being absent fro many days at a time from his original group. Absent was headed for Bailey Spring.Absent departed and we resumed our slow trod up the hill. We eventually started downhill and after a small rise found ourselves at Bailey Spring. Following a short blue blaze trail down to the left we found ourselves looking at large box spring. We still had a bottle of pure water from PennMar, but decided to fill our second from the spring. We spotted Absent starting a fire across from the spring. He had decided to eat dinner there. I mentioned that I planned to continue on to Deer Lick Shelter for the evening as there was still enough light and the days hike had been easier than planned.I arrived at Deer Lick which is actually two small shelters with their mouths facing away from each other. I quickly located two trees and hung my hammock and tarp. One of the thru hikers was a bit leery of me as my tarp was camouflage. I explained that my choices were bright royal blue or green camo. As part of the leave no trace philosophy is to also blend in to the woods and not be a conspicuous eyesore, I chose the camo. He felt better after the explanation.Shortly after dinner we were treated to a display of bouncing lights coming through the trees. The event looked like a scene from Close Encounters. The light were thru hikers putting in extra miles. They were glad to discover that none of the shelters were occupied. All the early arrival had chosen not to use the mouse boxes.Thus ended the sixth day.","Raven Rock, MD

I'm doing well. Climbed an 800 ft. set today at about an hour and a half. I'm starting to eat better. I'm probably going to have dinner at Rocky Mountain Shelter, but I may slide down the hill a mile or two to get a little closer to Caledonia, so I can get in there, get my shower tomorrow, hit Henicle's Market, buy some groceries. I'm eating a lot of tuna and soup, can't stand Milky Way bars and Fig Newtons for some reason. I need more lemonade. I'm getting kinda the hang of this, I think. That's about it. I just wanted to give an update. Tomorrow, I'm just going to get into Caledonia, shower, resupply. I'm definitely going to hit Quarry Gap Shelter. I don't know if I am going to press on to Birch Run. I may make it a short day and kinda rest up. I'm getting kinda tuckered. I think I put in like 9 or 10 miles today. That's it. Bye bye.""UPDATE: Got up about 8 a.m. and had breakfast with two of the late arriving thrus Mumbles and Peanut. Broke camp and hit the trail by 9.Arrived at Antietam Shelter around 10:30. Antietam is sited along a creek and has two adjoining fields. Go thing as word has it that there were about 70 folks here last night. Good thing I held short at Deer Lick. I had a more intimate evening. Decided to pop off the boots and socks, check for hot spots, and air the toes while reading the log. We also popped a Protonix to ease some low stomach pain. After donning the the footwear we set off across the field to discover a short side trail to a ballfield and a spigot with pure water. Decided to camel up and top off both bottles and our 2-liter hydro. We departed the Old Forge picnic area with a gallon of water (8 pounds) about 11.About a hour later we arrived at Tumbling Run. Tumbling Run is a big creek with several wood bridges and good access to the creek. Camping seems popular here as the forest floor was barren of litter due to all the tent sites. A few moments later and we arrived at a pair of shelters labled snoring and non-snoring. The building were in very good repair and had clothes lines behind each shelter. We dropped our pack at the table and checked the log.About 12:15 we left Tumbling Run and started up Buzzard Peak, and 800 foot climb. We just kept putting one foot slightly ahead of the other. Breath on the left; exhale on the right. We only took one brief stop for our 3 gulps of water on the way up. Our best ascent yet. Our smugness was short lived as just about the peak, we met a young couple with small children walking towards us on the trail. They wandered past while we found a log in the shade and had a wee bit of lunch. To celebrate the highest climb of the day we enjoyed some tuna salad and half our second Pepsi. Just as we were finishing up the husband of the couple surprised us and stuck a large bag of red Twizzlers in our face. ""Here. Take a handleful of these."" Resisting the urge to mug the man and take the entire bag, we took a handful and stuffed most into a side pocket on our pack. I took a moment to explain that because they had offered a hiker candy they were now trail angels. As they walked off I heard the mother explaining to the daughter what a trail angel was. Hopefully they will remember our encounter and offer trail magic to other hikers wheverever they may be.Setting off on a relatively flat trail with Twizzler in hand we made up some time and distance. Eventually we wound back down off the peak and near 5 p.m. we started our last climb of the day up Rocky Mountain.We reached the blue blaze to Rocky Mountain Shelter about 6:30. I asked some college students, whom I had first seen near Bailey Spring but not met, where the shelter was. They replied it was three-tenths of a mile downhill. Rather than go downhill and back again in the morning, I decided to press on a bit closer to Caledonia SP just 3 miles ahead. The students shouted that I was going the wrong way to the shelter. I said ""If I'm going to walk 3/10ths of a mile, I'm going to go 3/10ths North, not East."" About 3/10ths North I found a rock outcropping off the right side of the trail with a nice view. Perfect. While too uneven and rocky for a tent, there were two trees 6 paces apart. WE hung our hammock above some low rocks. As there was no sign of rain, we decided to ""cowboy it"" and forgo the tarp to save time in the morning. Fixed some dinner at the nearby outcropping and enjoyed the view and solitude. After bear bagging our food, we turned in about 8 p.m. We watched the stars begin to appear and fill in the formerly blue sky over the rocks. Sometime near 11, we awoke and saw a nearly full moon rising above the rocks through the trees.Thus ended the seventh day.","Deer Lick Shelters, PA

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/313189,"From TrailPhone:""Hi. This is Timothy. I'm at Caledonia State Park. I've had a shower. I got a ride with some Scouts down to Henicle's Market. I've resupplied. I got a lift back to the park with Trail Angel Paul. I had a really nice lunch with chicken and some fruit. I'm sitting here hanging with Absent. Getting ready to head north for another 7 or 8 miles today. I have a 1,000 foot climb. Happy Memorial Day to everybody. I should be in Boiling Springs Thursday. I have to do 10 and 1/2 miles everyday for the next 4 days. That's it.""UPDATE: Today was the day I had been anticipating the entire trip. Today is shower and resupply day!We woke about 6:45 a.m., ate and packed up. By 7:45 we were on the trail. The trail to Caledonia SP was mostly downhill except for two bizarre side trips over two boulder piles posing as hills. Why the trail suddenly veers to cross these two ""peaks"" is beyond me. Somewhere between the two peaks, Absent overtook me. I told him to watch for me at Caledonia SP.I crossed the highway into Caledonia SP just before 9. The trail here is wonderfully flat and follows what looks like another canal. After about a mile, the trail makes some turns and you can see the swimming pool/bath house/snack bar across a grass field. I headed over to the pool to take a shower and get a soda. Closed. Its Memorial Day and the pool is closed! I saw Absent wandering about nearby and called out to him. I looked at the park map with Absent and found a second shower up in the camping area above the meadow area. The map showed a trail past the ampitheater. I led the way across the park and found the trail. Absent had no idea that many state parks had ampitheaters and evening programs. We popped out of the trail, made a right turn, and about two tenths of a mile later we found the showers. We did everything. Dumped trash, showered, shampooed, washed clothes, etc. I donned my ""go to town"" shirt and clean dry briefs for my visit to Henicle's Grocery.Absent and I wandered back down the street and trail to the park below. We followed the road to the park office where I paid for my shower and got a cold Mountain Dew. Yum! Salt, sugar, and cold. No one leaving the park stopped to offer us a ride, so we decided to head out by the highway to improve our chances. Just as we reached the mail intersection, we saw some scouts walking to their cars and trucks. Turns out that Absent had camped with the scouts at the Rocky Mountain shelter last evening. We went over and asked if we could catch a lift. Sure! They had to retrieve some other vehicles so we tossed out packs and poles in the back and headed down to Henicle's. At Henicle's, the scout leaders said they'd be back by in about 45 minutes to see if we needed a ride back.We dropped our packs outside by the two grocery carts. Henicle's is a small compact store with a bit of everything. I was looking for Propel, mashed potatoes tuna, Pork ramen, dry meat and something to celebrate the holiday. propel was available in three flavors. Tuna was mostly in cans except for large packets. Instant potatoes were almost gone except for two packs. Ramen only came in beef, chicken and shrimp flavors. We grabed some lemon Propel, beef ramen, a can of tuna, and a can of small beef sticks. We also bought a quarter of roasted chicken, some diced honeydew, and two bananas as we could use some potassium. While waiting for our ride back, I also bought some orange juice which Absent highly recommended. While waiting for the scouts, trail angel Paul offered us a ride back to the park. Paul was unaware of his trail angel status so once again I explained trail angels to yet another samaritan. I took Paul and Absents photo back at the park, and Paul shot a photo of Absent and me also.Absent and I wandered back into the park and immediately found two southbound hikers. We exchanged greetings, gave them a heads up on the trail south and I gave them a map of the upcoming section. Absent and I wandered back towards the bath house and found a picnic table to use. I set about laying out my plastic bags for each days meals and started dealing out the food. Absent was impressed with my organization. While packing up my food bag, Absent commented there was ""no love"" at this park. No trail magic had appeared. As I had bought more lunch than I needed I offered Absent my chicken leg and half my melon. Ever the true thru-hiker, the food quickly disappeared. Thru-hikers a like human shrews and constantly eating and will consume almost anything in their quest for calories.Just before leaving around 1:30 p.m., I spotted a hiker coming across the stone bridge. I introduced my self and met Traveler. I took Traveler over to our table and introduced him to Absent and then departed. I headed back across the grassy meadow to where the trail crosses the creek and heads north. The trail follows an asphalt path out of the park. One of blazes is even on a pavillion support beam. After the asphalt the trail starts a steep ascent up. We hate up. WE hates it! Fortunately, up is short lived and the trail become a more gradual ascent with a well maintained rock free surface. Suddenly, we came upon a spring. Also ther was a sign waning about timber rattle snakes being protected. We continued up the trail and in just minutes arrived at the nicest shelter on the entire trail, Quarry Gap, about 3:30 p.m..Quarry Gap shelter is meticulously maintained by a very dedicated caretaker. He keeps everything freshly painted and in excellent repair. He has even taken time to landscape the spring with rocks and flowers. Quarry Gap is a must stop along the trail. While I had planned to spend the night, it was still early and I was well behind on my schedule. I had to hike 10.5 miles daily to make my bus on Friday. As my feet felt hot, we decided to check for blisters. We had anew one and broke out the moleskin. Our scissors on our multi-tool were all but useless. A southbound section hiker without a trail name offered my the use of her scissors on an old Swiss Army knife her dad had gave her. I mentioned she might considered ""Scissors"" as a trail name, but later while hiking decided ""Mercy"" was probably better. After packing up and donning our pack, we noted a bite valve from someone's bladder on the table and tossed it in out trash bag. (Remember this little fact, as its significant in tomorrow's tale!)I departed Quarry Gap about 4:30 and enjoyed some of the nicest trail of the trip. The trail wandred up and down, but fairly straight through the forest. Every now and then I would see a camping area off the trail were people had tented in times past. About 7:00 we stpped at one such camping area ona steep descent. After taking a break and almost being tempted to stop for the night we started back down the trail, only to find that we had been just a 100 yards above our destination, Milesburn Cabin.Milesburn Cabin is a locked PATC cabin that is famous for having a block with the letter ""M"" embedded in the wall. The cabin sits facing a small creek and has a locked privy up the hill behind it. There's also a large fire ring used by groups staying at the cabin. We found some trees just across the trail from the cabin and hung our hammock and tarp. Grabbing our food bag and stove we headed over to the fire ring and made dinner. After dinner we bear bagged our food and tuned in.Thus ended the eigth day.","Rocky Mountain Shelters, PA

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/313379,"From TrailPhone:""Hey. I'm at Pine Grove Furnace at the General Store. I just watched someone finish 'The Gallon Challenge.' It's about 12 miles for me today. My feet are bushed. I'm going to spend the night in the area. I don't know if I'm going to back up some, go forward, or spend the night in the park. I got rattled this afternoon by about a 4 foot Timber Rattlesnake. Hopefully, the picture turns out pretty good. I'm feeling a lot better. I've got my trail legs, eating well, staying hydrated. I'm starting to just get the hand of all this. That's it. Bye bye.""UPDATE: We awoke about 6:30a and lowered our bear bag to start breakfast. While our water was heating, we decided to cook 2 liters of extra water for the days hike as there were no springs between the cabin and Pine Grove SP. After breakfast, we grabbed our bag and filled our 2-liter bladder with water. Surprise! Water started gushing from the end of our hose. The bite valve was missing! It seems the bite valve we picked up yesterday as trash was in fact our own. Where was it? A search ensued as we last saw it with some other trash. A check of our trash ziplock bag proved fruitless as did a search of our backpack. The bite valve was no where to be found. As we lacked a spare bite valve, the bladder was essentially useless dead weight. We drained the water from the bladder back into our bottles and stored the bladder back in its pocket. Damn the bad luck.During our search we took advantage of the porch on the cabin and its many benches. By the time we repacked everything we had taken out and ensured nothing else was lost, it was 8:30. We headed across the creek and uphill towards Birch Run.We reached Birch Run around 9:30 and took a brief break to read the log book and make a short entry. Birch run also featured a bear pole for hanging food so we took a moment to check out the bear pole.About 10:30 we reached Ship Road and a nice grassy section. Around 11:00 we took a break and enjoyed an orange we had saved from Henicle's Market and swapped our water bottles around. The empty bottle goes into the side pocket upside down and the fresh bottle hangs conveniently from our right pack strap.Just before noon we passed the blue blaze trail going down to another PATC cabin. The AT here seems to be a reroute that circles the entire cabin area to afford cabin renters privacy from hikers.1:45 p.m. found us crossing the wooden bridge into the Toms Run shelter area. Toms Run features a pair of shelters with one in front of the other. I dropped my pack, read the log, and added an entry with the date and time. As this was the last water hole before Pine Grove SP, I took my empty bottle and utility pouch back to the bridge. After filling the bottle and dropping the iodine, I decided to ice my feet in the creek. That's some cold water! We iced the feet and then rested them on a large smooth rock. While we were sitting on the bridge, Riverdog came bounding by and asked where the shelter was. I pointed out the direction and said I'd join him in a few minutes. After donning my socks and boots, I returned to my pack, loaded everything back in and headed over to the other shelter where Riverdog was snacking and reading. While we were talking, who should arrive, but Traveler. I asked about Absent. Traveler said Absent was hanging around Caledonia SP to meet some British hikers raising money for wounded British war veterans. Traveler and Riverdog discussed the Half-Gallon Challenge at Pine Grove and deiced since it was early, they were going to head to Pine Grove, do the challenge and then head closer to Boiling Springs as they wanted to be at Darlington the next evening and Duncannon the night after. I wished the fellows well and they departed as swiftly as they arrived.I hiked my own hike at a much slower pace. After about a half hour, we came out of the woods to a gravel road. The double blaze indicated a right turn so we headed right. Further down we saw the white blaze to our left and a sign saying the trail was closed and to follow the road. Okay, we have a bypass. We went down the road and made a left as instructed. This road was much nicer and smelled of blooming honeysuckle and blackberries. Not knowing when a truck might come barreling past, we kept to the right hand side. About halfway down the road we heard a rattling/buzing sound. Were we just rattled. I stepped to the center of the road and turned around to look. Sure enough! In the high grass along side the road was a four foot timber rattlesnake with his head pulled back as if to strike. Camera! We quickly dug our cellphone out of the utility pouch and turned it on. We held our camera out towards tje snake and stepped a bit closer until we heard a second rattle. Close enough! We took the picture and headed off along the centerline.At the end of the road, we say a trail head around a gate and through the woods. So we followed the worn trail. After a few moments we realized that we hadn't seen any white blazes. We headed back to the gate and out into the road. Looking around we found a whaite blaze down the hill along what looked like a dirt road. We headed down the road. After a while we started seeing homes and cars along both sides of the road. This was a bit distressing as we understood the sate forest to abut the state park. We had not expected any private homes as we thought we might camp for free just across from the state park were we now found houses. Passing signs admonishing ""stay on trail"" we reached the bottom of the hill and Pine Grove State Park. The trail make a left turn and just a block or so up the road veers into Pine Grove SP. Entering the park, the old Ironmasters Inn is the first structure on the left. A former hostel, the Ironmasters Inn had just closed at the end of April. Just beyond on the left was the general store and we could see the new AT Museum just beyond the store. Arriving at the store, we found Riverdog and Traveler finishing their 1/2-gallons of ice cream. River dog finished first, followed minutes later by Traveler. Both entered their names in the book of honor and received their coveted commemorative spoons. While both napped from the effects of the ice cream, I enjoyed a pint of Hershey Cherry Cordial with a Coke and used my cup to eat both float style. Afterwards I flagged down Ranger John and asked about camping in the area. Ranger John said the choices were $20 to camp in the campground or continue north and camp anywhere outside the gate marking the forest boundary. He also mentioned on the way out to the north the trail passes a lake and a private bathhouse with free showers. We decided to head up the trail 2 miles to the lake.The trail from the store goes down a paved road past an old iron furnace. The trail then continues directly to the bathhouse where there are nice showers and bathrooms, a water fountain, and electricity for charging a cell phone. We spotted the lake to the right and a picnic area. We selected a table where we could watch some swimmers and some fishermen. The lake is an old quarry and contains both trout and bluegill. Most folks were trout fishing. About 5:30 we broke out the food bag and mess kit and heated up some soup.After dinner we headed back to the bathhouse to pickup the trail. The trail follows the bathhouse and then rejoins the trail from the lake. The trail then follows the stream feeding into the lake. After a few miles we saw a metal gate with sign boards on the park side. We also had the feeling we would need a cat hole shortly. We hustled up the trail and made a right turn into the forest. Safe! We can camp anywhere we want. At the moment we wanted a cat hole and so we pulled off the trail and started digging. Too late. Our shallow cat hole has soon overflowing. (We covered it with leaves to help with composting and then covered the hole with some large stones to keep wildlife from digging.) Were we sick? As the park headquarters and help were just a few easy miles south and it was a long way to help going north, we decided to play it safe and camp immediately. We found some suitable trees not too far from our cat hole and pitched camp. Expecting the worse, we ran a string line to the cat hole and hung some TP in a bag for probable nocturnal visits.We slept off and on. Every time we woke we sipped some water and Propel.Thus ended the ninth day.","Milesburn Cabin, PA

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/313692,"From TrailPhone:""Hi. This is Tim. I've stopped for the evening after a climb up from Whiskey Springs. I'm around mile 1106. I seem to be about 6 miles south of Boiling Springs. I'm going to hold there tomorrow night and make the dash to the Flying J Friday morning. I'm doing pretty good, new blister on the bottom of the foot. Leaving the park last night, I had need of an emergency cathole, multiple times, so I decided to spend the night there near a creek in the national forest. I felt a lot better today. Mostly sipping Propel and ice tea. That's it.""We awoke about 7 a.m. to cold. We got up and went down the hill to the creek to purify a fresh liter of water. For breakfast we went no cook with just orange juice and a salami wrap.About 8 we started up the hill further into the forest. WE were passing gas, but no signs of the previous evening's troubles.Noon found us at Tarr Run. We made our way across a log ""bridge"" and fixed a hot lunch of mashed potatoes on the opposite bank. Purified another liter of water to get us to Whiskey Spring.We departed James Fry shelter at 1 after checking the log and making an entry.At 4 we started our last big climb of the day. At the top of the climb was an open rocky area popular with the paintball set. Pink splotches were everywhere including attempts by paintballers to obscure the white blazes. We followed the white blazes on the rocks around and through the area. Moment by moment the trail became more and more absurd. WE squeezed through a narrow gap and followed by down climbing. At one point the trail went over a high ledge that required us to remove our pack and toss it up and then perform a lie back manuever to get ourselves up and over the ledge. At that point I was furious with the PATC trail maintainers. (Talking with other hikers and reading other TrailJournal entries for this section confirms that nearly everyone finds this section pointless and a needless hazard.) Eventually, around 5:30, we were down off the boulders and descending a normal trail.About 6 we heard the sound of running water and discovered Whiskey Spring was a creek crossing under a road through a culvert and down the hill. We dropped our pack and filled our bottle from the outflow from the culvert. While resting a woman and her dog arrived in a car. She seemed a bit nervous with me being at the trail head. Think about it. Dirty, stinky, unshaven man with a backpack. We also discovered that Whiskey Spring marked the end of the Mason Dixon line.As we had planned to stop for the evening in the area of the spring we started watching for a place to camp. The area before the spring had sported ""No Camping"" signs. The situation across the road was little better. Campers had trodden the area so much that it too was a no camping zone due for reforestation reasons. We ambled up the trail another hundred yards and found an area of the trail that folks had never used, probably due to its uneven slope. Fine with us. Hung the hammock between some trees and over some seedlings and limbs. We carefully avoided stepping on anything that would leave a mark of our having camped. Leave no trace. To further reduce walking, we decided against pitching our tarp, but kept it nearby should it rain.We made dinner out in the trail itself as it was the only area free of dried leaves. Our mini lighter was out of fuel, likely from all the pre-trip cooking at the office. We found our backup matches and were soon cooking with gas, well alcohol. We had some soup and finished the remainder of our hard salami we had bought at Henicle's Market. We discovered that our Bubblope, while being a good freezer bag cooking cozy, also made a fair insulated fridge to keep salami from spoiling from the day's heat.We bear bagged our food and mess kit along the trail and retired for the evening. We soon fell asleep looking up through the trees at the stars.Thus ended the tenth day.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park, PA

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/313800,"From TrailPhone:""Hi. This is Timothy. I'm in Boiling Springs at the ATC office. I've had a wonderful hot shower at the pool for only a buck. Another buck 50 got me the biggest cup of coke I've ever downed. After my shower, I treated a couple blisters I picked up this morning on the back of my right heal. Slowing me down, but I'm doing good. Just after rounding the bottom of the lake, I found the British Hiking Team that's raising funds for British war veterans. A white Jeep, their support vehicle's here at the office, guys come up the trail shortly. Since it's about 2:30 and I've got 8 miles to Carlisle, I'm going to press on to Carlisle, grab a motel for the night, kinda clean up, get downtown a little early tomorrow so I can see about catching the 3 o'clock bus so I get in around Saturday afternoon Little Rock. The weather's a little on the warm side, but we've got a nice breeze so I think I can get into Carlisle right around sundown. That's it.""UPDATE: We were a bit lazy and just really enjoying laying in our hammock in the woods. Being so close to Boiling Springs and then the end of our hike, we weren't in a rush to get going this morning. We hit the trail around 8:45 a.m.Just before 10 a.m. we hit our final spring and topped off our water supply. 2 liters to get us into Boiling Springs where we could refill with pure water at the ATC office.Shortly after leaving the spring we completed our last climb of our trip up to Centerpoint Knob. We took a few minutes to take in the Cumberland Valley stretching out before us. The trail takes a sharp right turn at the peak, which is recognizable by the large, homemade stone stile adorned with rocks of various sizes and shapes. A sign nearby informs us that we are leaving PATC maintained trail and are now the guest of the Cumberland Valley trail committee. We spotted a brown box hanging on a nearby tree and found a log book inside. In addition to the date and time, we left a short note for Absent stating we were leaving our remaining food for him at the upcoming ATC office. That done, we started down our last downhill of the trip.Before long the trail flattened out, curved through some brush and then...farm fields! While standing to determine the AT's course, we watched a large farm tractor and trailer coming up the road past a picturesque set of farm houses. The trail passed between two hay fields with occasional blazed wooden posts to mark its path.The trail would then cross a road and we would need to pause to determine where on the opposite side the trail restarted and where it was headed. Generally, the trail passed along the edge of young cornfields with the corn just weeks old. Often, the trail would make sudden right angle turns left and then right working our way across the valley.After a few miles of this we spotted a long straight line of trees. Could this be the train track just south of Boiling Springs? Entering the woods, we saw a train track rising up above us. Scrambling up and over we curved through the woods and past the blue blaze to the only legal camping site in the valley. The trail then became a gravel road with a white iron gate blocking the entrance. As we passed around the gate we noted a white plastic bag hanging from the gate. Trail magic? A peek inside the bag showed us several large soft pretzels and some oranges. It was trail magic! We tore off a chunk of pretzel and munched it while crossing over an old brick bridge into Boiling Springs.It was about noon. As soon as we crossed the bridge we found ourselves on the backside of the swimming pool. Walking around to the office we inquired about the $1 shower for hikers. While they were not yet open to swimmers, we were allowed to take our shower and clean up. We also bought a very large Coke for just $1.50. While the men's room won't win any awards due to its dated look, it was clean, well maintained and had lots of bench and floor space. While dressing we discovered two fresh blisters on our heel. The head lifeguard found us some bandage scissors to cut our moleskin with. Clean, bandaged, and re-hydrated, we donned our pack and made our way back to the bridge and the last known blaze.The trail makes a right turn at the bottom of the bridge and follows the creek a short ways. Then, the trail makes a left into a large parking area. We were surprised by two things we saw in the parking area. The first to our right was an old furnace nearly identical to the one at Pine Grove Furnace SP. The second to our left was a hiker sitting on a bench with a Union Jack flag draped over the bench back.Seeing the British flag we went over and discovered that both of us had been wanting to meet the other. This was the British team that Absent had been waiting for at Caledonia. While showering they had caught up and passed me. It was great to be among allied brothers at arms. Another fellow with a large white Landrover (trail name ""White Jeep"") explained that he had wanted to meet me due to my TrailPhone use. It turns out that I was the only hiker passing through Maryland and Pa that was using TrailPhone. The driver's wife Seminole had been listening to my updates for trail conditions ahead. I left White Jeep and headed up the trail. The trail follows along the eastern edge of a wonderful lake in the center of town. At the north end of the lake sat the ATC office. A volunteer sitting in the porch swing welcomed me. I dropped my pack at the picnic table and set about to my final tasks. We plugged our cell phone into a jack inside the office. Inquired as to where to leave our excess alcohol fuel. (On the floor just inside the door on the left with the other assorted fuel.) We wrote a short note for Absent in the log and deposited our excess food in the hiker box on the porch. (Actually, there were two hiker boxes, both overflowing with goodies.) Our pack emptied of fuel and food we took it over to the hanging scale on the porch for a final weigh in. It weighed 23 pounds; 13 pounds less than at Harper's Ferry. Little wonder of five days of food lasted seven with leftovers. We were still 8 pounds heavier than we would like to be, so we resolved to buy a digital postal scale and weigh every item of gear and work on reducing our base weight for the next long hike.We left our pack in the care of the volunteer and walked across the trail to the outfitter, which is really a fly fishing shop that has a rack of hiking what nots and books. Across the street from the outfitter and the ATC is the famed tavern. We walked around the west side of the tavern and found the ""boiling"" spring that gives the town its name. The area around the spring is home to the local thrashers who were busy skateboarding and posing. Across the corner from the tavern is a gas station that caters to hikers. Every hiker favorite from jerky to sweet rolls to chips and sodas was for sale.Wandering back to the ATC office, White Jeep arrived. While packing up the cellphone and charger and getting some fresh pure water for both bottles, Seminole appeared and was about to depart north. I asked her for a moment longer so I could hike with her.About 3 p.m. Seminole and I departed the ATC and took a right turn down the street past the Post Office. Five or six blocks down the white blazes indicated a tun and we soon found ourselves hiking through a strip of brush. Seminole was headed for Scott Farm to meet her husband White Jeep, her personal support team. Seminole set a quick pace, which is what I wanted. I had decided while showering to continue on to Highway 11 and exit the trail today versus camping by the train tracks and making a mad dash in the morning.While hiking, Seminole mentioned that she didn't know what poison ivy looked like. She lifted the legs of her long wind pants and revealed a large red rash all over her right calf. Ouch! I got Seminole to pause long enough for me to point out a large vine growing on a nearby tree. She noted the ""leaves of three"" and more importantly the hairy vine they were attached too. Further down the trail I spotted some young poison ivy growing along the corn. Seminole paused to note the reddish bright green ""leaves of three.""","Whiskey Spring, PA

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/313833,"From TrailPhone:""Hi. This is Tim. I've stopped for the evening about a mile west of mile 1120. I'm at the Motel 6 shelter, formerly known as the Holiday Inn shelter. This is probably the nicest shelter I've been in across the AT. They've a little white metal locker in the room for securing my food. There's a pipe spring in the shelter. I don't see mouse hangers, so I'm assuming we don't have a mouse problem or we've got a really nice snake. I made Boiling Springs a little bit before noon, took a shower at the swimming pool there. I kinda got cleaned up. On the way into downtown Boiling Springs, I met White Jeep and the British Wounded Warrior hiking team that was coming up the trail behind me, so I got a chance to meet some conrades in arms. I dropped my surplus fuel and food at the ATC office for the other through hikers to benefit from. I departed about 3 with Seminole. Seminole's a hiking fool. She kinda led me at a really rapid pace until about 4:30 when I had to fall back and go back to my own hike your own hike speed. I limped off U.S 11 overpass around 6:30. Just about then, a large cloud burst let loose. I came into Motel 6 a little wet and slightly hypothermic, but I'm doing fine. I've had a hot shower. I limped around the corner to a Bob Evans, had turkey, carrots, with green beans. I highly recommend it for everybody. I had a big leg cramp right before I left the restaurant, so I'll probably be hitting electrolytes kinda heavy today. But, I'm off the trail. I'm safe. I'm dry. I'm warm. I'm clean. So tomorrow morning, we'll kinda get everything together, find the bus stop, and make my way to downtown Harrisburg and start the trek back to Little Rock. If I can get this 3 o'clock Greyhound, I should be in around 5:30 Saturday evening. That's it. It's been a heck of a trip! I've got a lot of stories, a lot of pictures, and I can't wait to see everybody! So, thank you all for your support and your prayers. Tim out!""UPDATE: We got up early and took another wonderful hot shower, our third since check-in. Donned our traveling clothes and packed everything up. We decided to wear our flip-flops and pack our boots. We tied the boots together, snapped on a carabiner, bagged the boots to reduce their odor, and clipped them on the back of our pack.Checked-out of the hotel about 8:45a and headed to the bus stop. We walked out to the main drag and selected a spot on the right (East) side of the intersection as in most cities buses stop across intersections. After a small wait we spotted the bus and waved our $3 at the bus. The bus pulled off for a pick up but continued 20-30 feet past us. Didn't understand what the driver said about his stopping, but we were glad to be aboard.The area between Carlisle and Mechanicsburg has been growing and there is considerable new commercial development. About 10-15 minutes later we stopped at a corner with a new Walmart Supercenter and a Target. When the bus reached the K-Mart in Mechanicsburg, we decided to hop off and head to K-mart. We slowly walked across the parking lot, tossed our pack into the first cart, and headed into the store. We first looked for shoes to replace our dollar store flip-flops and settled on a pair of brown, fleece house slippers. Heading over to the first aid supplies we added a box of heavy-duty Curaid bandages. We then checked out and went over to the kiddie rides and took a seat on the rocket as there were no benches available. We applied the heavy-duty bandaids to our blisters and then donned our clean socks and slippers. Much nicer. We dropped our trash and the flip-flops in the trash can and headed over to the McDonalds by the street. Breakfast was still on, so we got a large 32 oz. sweet tea and a McMuffin to go. Found a sliver of shade from a utility pole and made ourselves comfortable on the lawn in the shadow. We finished our breakfast well before the next bus.Caught the next city bus headed east to Harrisburg and enjoyed the ride. City buses are a good way to locate everything important in a town. Found some more shopping areas, a farmers market, and several historic buildings. The bus crossed over the Susquehanna River, wound downtown, and dropped us one block from the Amtrak/Greyhound station.We headed over to the station. The train station is upstairs on the entrance level. Greyhound is one floor below on the Market street level. It cost us $15 to have our 30-day advance ticket adjusted to depart today at 3:00. Departures to Pittsburgh and points west depart from gate 5, located down a short hallway to the right of the ticket counter. It being only 11:00, we decided to see some of downtown Harrisburg.The capitol is just one block north. The current capitol is located in the center of a raised park. There are bridges from the capitol grounds to structures on all sides. There isn't much in the way of small shops, but there are several eating places, including a Turkish/Middle Eastern place near the south-east corner. We noted lots of pedestrian traffic entering and exiting Strawberry Place. We went in and found a large food court on the second (Capitol park) level. There was a large seating area and over a dozen food vendors, including Asian, Mexican, Italian, pizza, sandwiches, ice cream and more. We decided to have a 1/4 roasted chicken and some tea from the Mexican place near the bridge to the capitol. After a leisurely lunch and extended people watching period we headed back to the bus station.Back at the station, we wandered into the convenience store just outside the Amtrak area. The store is wells stocked. If arriving to hike the A.T., one could probably find enough food and last minute supplies to make it to either Duncannon or Boiling Springs from the US 11 bridge.The bus arrived on schedule and we departed about 15 minutes late. We stored our backpack below and took just our food bag and poles aboard. About 15 minutes later we passed under the A.T. and I felt a bit melancholy as I had just stood on that same bridge the afternoon before watching the traffic below.About an hour after departing, we took a meal stop at a rest area on the PA turnpike. The building was fairly new with clean restrooms. We got a Whopper Junior and a soft drink at the Burger King inside. Ate outside as the weather was comfortable.The bus arrived in Pittsburgh just before sundown. WE had a hour layover while the bus was cleaned and refueled. We made friends with two foreign college students headed west to Branson for summer jobs. One from Macedonia was headed for the Steak n' Shake, and the other from Mongolia to another restaurant. I helped ensure they knew when to reboard the bus and looked after them until Indianapolis where they departed for St Louis and I to Nashville.After a few changes of buses and even more drivers, we arrived in Little Rock about 5:45p. I claimed my pack and repacked the food bag and secured the poles to the outside. Stepping outside the front door, we didn't recognize any cars or any people. We noted stairs to the new pedestrian bridge ended just behind the Greyhound station so we headed around the building to the bridge.From the Greyhound station it's about one mile to the Transit center. What's a mile after 107? We headed up the stairs and over the bridge. We took the elevator up to the middle section. Arriving on the other side, a couple told us the elevator down was inop. We shrugged and headed down the stairs and off the bridge.","Carlisle

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/335421,"Preparing for May 2011 section hike from Delaware Water Gap (DWG), PA to Greymoor, NY. Since I can't finish PA in two weeks and there are no easy solo hiker access points before DWG, the best solution is to resume at DWG and save the remainder of PA for another year. This enables us to complete NJ and half of NY.The basic plan is to Greyhound to NYC and take a Poconos bus to DWG. Return is by commuter train from Garrison Station (Hudson Line). May stay overnight in NYC at a hostel before Greyhound home.New gear for 2011 includes an Ursack. We got tired of wasting time bear bagging every evening. The Ursack should be a noticeable improvement. We also will likely trade our heavy tarp for a lighter version and hopefully drop a pound or more.In the mean time we have started a new @section_hiking Twitter account to go with our Section Hiking the Appalachian Trail blog.",,Preparation,"Jan 15, Sat",0
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345038,"Arrived in New York City about 2:30 p.m. Martz Trailways ticket counter is located next to Greyhound in the Port Authority building. Bought a ticket to Delaware water Gap departing at 3:15 for $34.95. Made a quick stop by the United Service Organizations (USO) office located two floors above the Greyhound ticket office. Discovered the USO does not offer a baggage storage closet due to security rules. Also, one cannot take any pictures in the Port Authority. We walked over to the other side of the building and downstairs to catch our Martz bus. The bus arrived at Delaware Water Gap, PA a bit after 5:00. We took some time to pull our pack our of its travel duffel and reconfigure the pack for wear. We followed the highway back to the exit ramp and visited the two service station/convenience stores. We bought a bottle of 12 oz. HEET (alcohol stove fuel) at the first gas station. We headed down the street towards the center of town passing the bakery, a restaurant, and the outfitter, all of which back up to Cherry Creek. We headed up the hill towards the Presbyterian Church of the Mountain in search of it's famed hostel. We found Ryan, a thru-hiker already at the hostel and the hostel unlocked. Joy! We did not have to implement plan B, which was to hike 2 miles south and up Mt Minsi to stealth camp.","Little Rock, AR
","Delaware Water Gap, PA","May 01, Sun",0
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345663,"Awoke early and waited until thru-hikers Ryan and Paul were off to get cleaned up. After a leisurely breakfast and shower, we took some time to sweep down the outside picnic table and visit with the church secretary. We saw some deer just behind the church.We set off down the hill and across the Delaware River at about 10:00 a.m. We passed a really nice rest area with indoor toilets, trash cans, and picnic tables. A bit further up we stopped by the ranger station and asked about camping at Camp Ken-Etawa-Pec. The ranger stated the YMCA had ceased operations there and there was no back country camping.After crossing under I-80, we found ourselves at the true trail head up Kittatiny ridge. The trail in this area is wide and easy to hike.Around noon, we found ourselves at Backpacker camp #2. The camp is at the intersection of several trails and just a few minutes hike from Sunfish Pond, the nearest water source. The site was clearly burned from an illicit fire that got out of control. (Note: No open fires are allowed anywhere along the AT in NJ.) There were plenty of tent and hammock sites available. We wandered down to the ridge runner's tent platform and had a quick lunch. We familiarized ourselves with the BearSaver bear box, which we would would find at all legal camping locations in New Jersey.About 15 minutes after leaving the backpacker camp, we were at the beginning of Sunfish Pond, a glacial remnant lake. The trail runs along the western side and consists of boulder hoping for about 1-2 miles. This was a prelude as we discovered much of the AT in Western NJ is extremely rocky. We grabbed a liter of water from the pond and dropped some iodine to ensure we had adequate water for the final ridge walk.A few miles north, we were surprised to walk out of the woods onto an open ridge and discover a large rock cairn. There is a beautiful view of the Delaware River valley from this vantage point. A few hundred yards north and the trail exits the state forest and re-enters the Delaware Water Gap Recreation Area and legal off-trail camping.We continued on and late in the day began our descent to a creek and foot bridge with a gravel road just beyond. A quick look to our left showed a sign announcing the Mohican Outdoor Center just a few hundred yards away. We turned onto the gravel road and walked a gentle descent into the MOC. No one was at the visitor center, so we topped off our two water bottles at the faucet next to the garage and took a seat on the benches out front. Eventually, John returned from some cabin maintenance and checked us and another section hiker into the center. We opted for the $9 tenting option and decided that tent area #3 had the best trees for hammocking. We also bought a canned Mt Dew for an extra $1. For an extra $3, hikers can use an indoor toilet and shower. We opted for the complimentary privy.After dinner, we placed our Ursack and backpack into the nearby bear box for safe keeping. We took a few minutes in our hammock to update our log book and review the next days trip plan. We fell peacefully asleep about 8 p.m..Thus ended the first day.","Delaware Water Gap Area, PA

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345664,"Arose this morning at 8:00 a.m.. It is my vacation after all and our hammock is very comfortable and cozy. After a hearty breakfast of oatmeal, freeze dried apples, Fig Newtons, and hot chocolate, we broke camp, took some photos of the MOC visitor center, topped off our water and headed up the gravel road to the AT about 9:30 a.m..The trail started out fine, but quickly rose in steepness and rocks. About 10:15, we were atop Catfish and began the ridge walk we had anticipated when planning this trip. The trail in this section crosses over slabs of rock and offers views of New Jersey to the east.Just before 11 we were surprised to look up and find the Catfish fire tower framed by the trail. We had planned to be here at noon. We discovered a concrete picnic table below the tower surrounded by narcissus and lilies. We took a break to drop our pack and fix a quick salami wrap.After our break, we started down from Catfish fire tower. The trail first follows the gravel fire road downhill, but soon turns left where the trail does double duty as drainage. Lots of large steps down over rocks and roots. The trail continues down in this fashion until it T's with a gravel road and one must turn to continue.The elapsed time and distance indicated we were near Rattlesnake Spring. We noted some black plastic drain pipe crossing the gravel road to our left and went to investigate. We discovered a small spring seeping from the hill just a few feet above the road. As this was the only water source listed, we filled a bottle and dropped some iodine tablets.Following the gravel road we noted some stealth camp sites where the road makes a sharp left turn. About noon, the gravel road led us to CR-602, a paved road with more frequent traffic than we anticipated. While we took a moment to rest on the boulders in full sun to update our notes, we soon discovered after a brief road walk west, there were shadier rocks and logs up the rail where it reenters the forest.Fifteen minutes later the trail took us along a picturesque small pond where we heard a bullfrog and watched a goose dunk itself in the water. On the other side of the pond, the trail resumed its rocky rise back to the ridge.The day was sunny and warm. Feeling a bit tired, we decided to take a ""safety"" and pull off the trail and take a nap. We found two suitable trees, rigged just our hammock, and nodded off in the partial shade.Around four o'clock, we awoke, packed, had some water and a light snack and resumed our day's trek. We were passing along a wide section of trail that had once been a housing development. The houses were long gone and the road had nearly reverted to trail save for patches of old asphalt. Signage warning of bears and forbidding camping were prominent.Apparently we had once again been close to one of our mile markers when we stopped for the nap as just fifteen minutes later we found a weather station and a pump along a paved road. The pump proved to be inoperative which was disconcerting as this was a planned water hole and we were low on water.We had originally planned to stop just past the road at Camp Ken-Etiwa-Pec, but as the ranger had told us the camp was defunct and there being additional no camping signs across the road, we decided to keep going. Interestingly enough, when we crossed the road there was a white sign announcing the camp to AT hikers and the sign did not very old. None the less we pushed forward over a very rocky section of trail.About a half-hour later we began to round the end of Long Pond on which the former camp sits. We discovered water flowing across the trail from a small pond higher up that was overflowing from recent rains. We took advantage of the gift of water and filled two liter bottles and dropping more iodine.Shortly after we passed the two ponds, the trail widened and improved to wide grassy well graded trail. Except for a brief rock climbing section to change between trails, we found ourselves on a back-country expressway. We sped up our pace as sundown was approaching and the earlier rocks had slowed us down considerably. Our goal was to hike a mile past Crater Lake out of the no camping zone and find a legal camp site just past the Buttermilk Falls trail intersection. By 6:30 we still had not reached the trail intersection and we were overheating. We spotted an old trail/stealth camp and decided for safety reasons to stop and make camp. After a brief episode of side cramps and dry heaves, we rigged our hammock, made a hot dinner in the middle of the trail, and hung our new Ursack bear bag on a tree down the trail.By eight o'clock, the temperature began dropping, but we were snug in under our sleeping bag. The wind began to increase and about ten o'clock it began to rain.Thus ended the second day.","Mohican Outdoor Center, NJ
","Camp Ken-Etiwa-Pec, NJ","May 03, Tue",10.50
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345666,"We awoke about 2 a.m. to discover the wind had blown some of the rain under the end of our tarp and dampened one side at the top of our nylon hammock. Our sleeping bag was dry, except for some condensation on top. We went back to sleep after lifting our tarp and verifying our Ursack was still hanging on the tree.We arose about 8:30 a.m. to continued rain. We skipped breakfast, but retrieved our Ursack as we were about an hour or so from established shelter. We then broke camp carefully following our rainy day procedures developed back at home in Arkansas. Basically, stay under the tarp and carefully disassemble and pack each item.We departed our stealth camp about nine and moments later made a sharp left turn on the trail. Just after the turn we discovered the blue blaze trail to Buttermilk Falls. Just past the trail intersection, we found three large well established campsites ideal for both tents and hammocks. We had once again been very close to our goal, only to have stopped just short!We arrived at the Brinks Road shelter about eleven in the morning. The shelter is about 2/10ths of a mile down a gravel road. Just before the shelter the blue blaze trail passes a shallow pond, which is the water source cited in guidebooks. The shelter floor was nearly at ground level, a first for us since in MD and PA the shelter floors were at waist height making donning and doffing packs very easy. We dropped our pack and immediately went to get two liters of water. We dropped iodine in one and used the second for a hot breakfast.We sat on the floor of the shelter and lit our Supercat alcohol stove and brought as much water to a boil as our cup would hold. We made a large bowl of hot Ramen soup, hot chocolate, and even tossed a tea bag into the remaining hot water in the Esbit cup.We repacked out mess kit and stove, packed the days food baggie in the top pocket of our pack for accessibility, and resecured everything else inside the main pack in a plastic trash bag.About 1 p.m., just as we were departing the shelter and walking back up the gravel road, we met a lone backpacker dressed in red. Our new friend indentified himself as 3Stoves. No way! I had read 3Stoves' blog just before departing and hoped to meet him and his trail posse. 3Stoves was one of the few hikers this year who completed the 24-hour challenge of hiking from the Virginia border across West Virginia and Maryland and setting foot in Pennsylvania within 24 hours - a distance of over 51 miles! I briefed 3Stoves on the shelter and water situation. 3Stoves alerted me to three other NOBO hikers behind him.We continued hiking back up the blue blaze to the AT elated to have met 3Stoves. In fact, we were so elated we hiked past the AT and began to descend on the other side for about 100 yards before we realized our error. Sore knee. Rain. Overshot the trail. Big sigh.We no sooner regained the AT and resumed our northbound hike when we met an older couple hiking south. We exchanged trail info with Eyeore and Orchid; and was entertained by Peanut the dog who was barking from inside Orchid's jacket which was tucked tightly under her waist belt to make a pouch for Peanut.The trail continued its rocky course back up to the ridge line where the wind was blowing strongly. Sometime about three o'clock we found ourselves looking down on RT206, aka Culver Gap. It took us about forty-five minutes to wind ourselves down a long diagonal trail to the west. Just as we were about to exit the woods onto RT206, we noted a man in shorts and short-sleeves hitchhiking just beyond the woods. We grabbed a granola bar from our pocket and offered it to him. He declined and almost seemed offended. C'est la vie.We booted our phone and took photos of the deli, Kevin's Steakhouse, and the gas station. The deli was closed so we were unable to gather any information to report, we asked the station attendant if they sold HEET. ""What's that?"" was the reply. Don't plan on buying alcohol fuel at Culver's gapIt was about ten to four when we started back across Kevin's parking lot. The sign said they opened at four. We tried the front door, found it unlocked and entered. ""Hello?"" No answer. Ummm... warm. We stood in the doorway with our pack on enjoying the warm air and feeling ourself drying out. Eventually a delightful woman appeared and put us at ease. ""Of course hikers are welcome, have a seat. What can I get you?"" ""A coke without ice and a wedge of lemon."" While enjoying the sugary, salty Coke we read their menu. While the soup of the day was a lobster bisque, we wanted the French onion soup. Kerrie explained that the kitchen doesn't start until four so it would be a while until the soup was hot. (They actually arrive, unlock and start cooking at four!)Shannon a waitress arrived shortly after and was excited to see their first hiker of the season. Me? First? Surely not! Shannon retrieved their hikers log book and asked me to make the first entry of 2011. Reluctantly I wrote a short entry feeling the honor of first post should have been given to a 2011 thru-hiker. Our soup arrived and we dug into a dark salty beef broth with sweet onions, bread, and lots of melted cheese. Delicious and just the thing for a cold wet day. As much as we would have liked to have stayed we were still four miles south of Gren Anderson shelter with an estimated hiking time of more than two hours. It was nearly five! We asked Kerrie for a liter of her best tap water for our water bottle and quickly departed.Mercifully, the trail re-entered the woods just across the street and was mostly flat and smooth for the first mile. Then we resumed up. Up a rocky trail to Culver tower. About a half hour later we spotted a communication tower off to our right bristling with antennae. Hmm... We thought Culver tower was another fire tower, not a comm tower. We were proven wrong further up the trail we we looked up and suddenly another fire tower was framed by the trees. We past under the tower at about six. Two miles down and two more to hike.About seven we arrived at Gren Anderson to find 3Stoves and two of his posse along with two SOBO section hikers having dinner. We quickly found two suitable trees and hung our hammock. Not being hungry from the recent soup we ate a light dinner of tuna in oil and hot chocolate. We also briefed the assembled hikers on the TV weather report we had watched while at Kevin's. Cool and windy for the next two days then warmer and sunnier. Evening lows would be in the 50s in a few days.The temperature began dropping fast so we tucked into our sleeping bag around eight. Our bag was damp, but not soaked - likely from being packed while still damp with condensation. We remained in our rain suit and wore our old quilted field jacket liner underneath to ensure a warm nights rest. Damp, tired and still remembering the French onion soup we drifted off to sleep in our hammock.Thus ended the third day.","Camp Ken-Etiwa-Pec, NJ
","Gren Anderson Shelter, NJ","May 04, Wed",14
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345667,"We arose about nine o'clock and discovered the shelter empty of all hikers. As the morning was sunny and breezy, we hung our sleeping bag atop our tarp to thoroughly dry it out. We also hung our Dri-ducks inside out as well as our old field jacket liner. While things dried we used the privy and fixed a hot breakfast of oatmeal, freeze dried apples, fig newtons, and hot chocolate. We took some time to read the shelter log book and noted IRover had not logged in.We hadn't seen or passed him during the previous day's rain so we assumed he was ahead of us. Still, strange that IRover had not signed the book.We took advantage of the nice weather to reconfigure our pack to move the blue foam pad inside and off the top of the pack. Once expanded inside, we were able to drop our bag of dry, clean clothes into the bottom, put the Ursack with food upright against our back, and stuff the hammock system around the Ursack. Only the oversized tarp needed to ride atop the pack.After sweeping down the shelter, we hit the trail at about 11:30 a.m. headed for the Rutherford shelter at High Point State Park.Around one-thirty we arrived at Sunrise Pavillion. While there were no tables, the pavillion was lined with benches. We sat on the raised floor and used a bench as a wind break against the still blustery winds. Our feet had started to have hot spots from the fairly rocky trail. We doffed our boots and socks and applied heavy duty bandages and duct tape around three toes and both heals. While cooling our feet, we took time to break open a package of A Genoa salami and make some salami tortilla wraps. While eating a section hiker from Quantico, VA passed through. Just before we left a woman, child, and older woman came up the trail from the north side. (Clearly we must be near a road as they were not in our condition). We set off northbound and down a slight downhill and discovered not just a road, but a full fledged parking area complete with privies, trash cans and a picnic table and overlook. No mention of that in the guide books and trail discussions.We continued north along the every rocky trail and arrived as Mashipacong shelter a bit after four. Mashipacong shelter was a pleasant surprise as the shelter is on the Appalachian Trail and has a large grassy area in front. The shelter also features a new fiberglass privy, a large bear box, and generous trees and tent camping area just past the shelter. Most amazing though was the gallon jug of what was clearly water. There wasn't much left in the jug so we took just a pint to ensure adequate water to reach Rutherford shelter, still four miles distant on a warm afternoon.We found the log book and dutifully entered our arrival date and time as is our habit when hiking solo. We discovered that IRover had passed by before us so there was a chance we would met at or before Rutherford. The log also stated the shelter was maintained by Alf and also that Alf had hiked in and stashed some 13 gallons of pure water which was in the bear box. We wandered back by the bear box and opened the main right-side door. Sure enough. Two large blue 5 gallon water containers with spigots were inside along with a few gallon jugs. This is noteable because Mashipacong is renown for not having water and all the guide books and signage warn hikers to have sufficient water to hike several miles beyond Mashipacong.We donned our pack and set off north from the shelter down a dirt fire road and soon noticed the distinct lack of white blazes. Damn! Not on the trail. Back to the shelter were we last saw a blaze. Standing in the middle of the grassy area we turned slowly ina circle looking at all the trees. No blazes? We walked back to where we entered the grassy area originally and found our last seen blaze. Aha! There on the corner of the shleter roof was a double blaze signalling a left turn. On the back roof was a single white blaze. The trail runs along the south outside wall of the shelter and down what can only be described as a dainage ditch to the paved highway below.Crossing the road we found a nice parking area and an information display welcoming us to High Point State Park. The display included a detailed topograpghic map of the park depicting all the park trails and elevation contours. Hmmm.. A short climb, foolowed by a downhill to a lowland and then a steep climb just before Rutherford. Nice. Hikers always enjoy a steep climb late in the day when they're tired. Not.We left the parking lot and the short section of groomed trail suddenly reverted to nasty rocks. About a half hour in, around five, we found IRover resting on a rock up ahead. Trading information we learned IRover had fell on the wet descent into Culver Gap mashing his hand badly. He took a room at a motel several miles east of the trail. So, that's why he wasn't at the shelter with 3stoves and company. IRover stated he was headed for Rutherford but he was going to enjoy a cigar first. We joked that if he didn't show up by eight, we'd alert the park rangers, and then we headed on up the trail ahead of him. Always nice knowing another hiker is close by in case of injury.Around six and after an hour of rough hiking we encountered Mike from Quantico flip-floppoing back south to Mashipacong shelter. He had stood above Rutherford shelter, but not visited it. Mike told me he had been hiking about 20-25 minutes. We estimated our remaining hiking time to be around 45 minutes to an hour as we were moving much slower.True to the map the trail began a rocky descent down with large steps off of stones and roots. The left knee was really complaining now. At the bottom the rail became squishy. Great. Wet, muddy boots was just what I needed most. Nope. The local trail club had already decided what I needed most just then was to go up. Not just up, but a chance to tryout our old rock climbing skills. The rearranged pack with a closer center of gravity was much appreciated, although we did catch ourselves trying to do a head first back dive while attempting a ""move."" At the top we found ourselves among large slabs of rock running at steep angles along the hillside. About halfway across one of the largest we found a sign marking the blue blaze trail to the Rutherford shelter. All we had to do was safely descend a smooth slab and hike another 3/10ths mile to the shelter. We managed to get off the slab without a serious fall and discovered the woods below was swampy with massive blow downs of trees. About halfway to the shelter we crossed over a small creek, likely the water source noted in the guide books. We gathered a liter from the stream and skipped the iodine as we would boil the full liter while making dinner and breakfast.We arrived at the shelter about seven-thirty. Already the sun had dropped behind the ridge above and the temperature was dropping. We used two trees near the entrance to th shelter area to hang our hammock. One had a bit of poison ivy starting around its base so we went slowly to ensure we didn't contaminate or hammock or webbing. We didn't have much of an appetite despite the long day of hiking so we boiled a pint of water and made so soup and hot chocolate. While sitting at the table we noted the area had a lot of trash littered about from previous hikers. When storing our bear bag in the provided box we discovered even more along with oatmeal encrusted bowls and metal silverware inside the bear box. Not a problem, we'll be at park HQ tommorrow and will report the conditions to the rangers.We hung our now mostly empty pack on a nail under the left side of the shelter roof where we could keep an eye on it from our hammock, just in case a bear visited that evening.Eight o-clock found us snuggled into our hammock and wondering when we would hear IRover. We couldn't miss him as we almost blocked the entrance to the shelter area. About eight-thirty we really were becoming concerned. Should we file a missing hiker report with the rangers in the morning or should we assume IRover was OK?Thus ended the fourth day.","Gren Anderson Shelter, NJ

Left knee was sore, but let an EMT check it out and I am free to continue hiking. We ended today's hike at the Jim Murray property.""We awoke about 2 a.m. to find cool temperatures, but no rain. The top of our sleeping bag was again moist from condensation. We lifted the tarp to check on our backpack which we had hung just under the shelter roof in sight of our hammock. Panic! Nothing. All we saw was the black interior of the shelter, until we made out a small patch of blue near the roof line. Of course, the back of our pack is mostly black and black on black is invisible in low light. Whew! We also noted the shelter was conspicuously empty and there were no new tents about. IRover still had not made it to the shelter.We laid back down, but now fully awake from the sudden burst of adrenalin coursing through our veins. That gave us time to reconsider what to do concerning reporting IRover missing the next day. As IRover seemed well equipped and somewhat experienced the few times we met, we decided to not file any reports just yet, but to wait and see what information the day may reveal.We drifted back to sleep and arose around eight. We arose and took our sleeping bag over to the picnic table and spread it out for the sun to dry. On the way back from the privy, we emptied the bear box of our food stuffs and returned to the table and started breakfast. We still had very little appetite which concerned us as the previous year found our appetite suppressed the first few days and ravenous by the fifth day. We should have a case of the ""hiker hungeries"" starting. We ate some tuna and had some hot chocolate.After breakfast we broke camp, repacked our pack and took time to do some trail maintenance. We removed several bench support logs from the illegal fire pit and reassembled two benches. We also picked up most of the litter we found scattered about the picnic table area and added it to our growing trash bag.We started back up the blue blaze trail to the AT, pausing to gather a liter of fresh water at the swamp along the way. We carefully climbed the rock slab to regain the white blazed path along its top and set off north.Mid-morning we found ourselves at a lovely overlook above Sawmill Lake. We had spotted the radio tower beside the park HQ building just moments before. We were close to our main event of the day - picking up our maildrop! We quickly set off down the trail in front of the overlook, cursing the trail maintainers as we carefully descended several steep down climbs to another overlook below. It was then we noticed the lack of white blazes. Damn! Off trail again, except this time we were sure we couldn't safely climb back up to the last known blaze. I could see campers along the lake, yet would likely need to be ""rescued"". We took a moment to have a bit of candy and some water and think about our situation. We knew the trail ran along the radio tower to our right, so the trail had to be above us and to our right. We noted some game trails used by dear running to our right. Perhaps we could work ourselves right and then find a thin area of thicket and bushwack ourselves back onto the white blazes. We kept going right and finding the situation no better. Finally, we found an area that seems thin enough for us to fight our way back up at a diagonal. Ten or fifteen minutes later we found a worn path adorned with white blazes in both directions. Turning left we hustled north again.Due to our getting ""lost"" we didn't arrive at the park HQ until 1 p.m., an hour after our planned arrival time. We went to the visitor center and asked Renee if she might have a maildrop for ""Timothy Lee."" Renee checked under the counter and produced the very box we had mailed a week earlier. Renee said she had received the box on Monday, just 3 days after we mailed it. We inquired about a soda machine as we thought low blood sugar and/or low salt might be effecting our hiking. None, but Renee offered to have a ranger pick one up for us on the way back. Renee radioed Victor who informed Renee there was some soda upstairs. Renee returned with a 2 liter bottle and transferred some into one of our water bottles. We left $2 so they could restock for other hikers in need. We also asked about a Wilderness EMT who might could evaluate our sore knee. Renee said Victor was their EMT. WE said we'd wait for Victor's return and set about having lunch on one of the many large benches in the visitor center. We also availed ourselves of the large window sills above electrical outlets to recharge of phone. Victor arrived shortly and looked at the knee. He didn't see any trauma and could only offer an Ace wrap and ice pack. As we had an Ace wrap in our first aid kit we thanked Victor all the same. Victor discussed our loss of appetite and suggested we may have low potassium as we were not diabetic. Victor recommended apple juice instead of soda as a possible remedy. having lunched, recharged, diagnosed and filled our water bottles, we strapped our maildrop box atop our pack and set out north around 2:10 p.m..We quickly crossed the highway and found the trail, which just as quickly went from grass to troublesome rocks. About 3, we found ourselves below the viewing platform. We climbed up the platform and dropped our pack onto a convenient bench. We took a few photos of the monument and the surrounding terrain. We donned our pack, climbed down the staircase and resumed our travels along the path now going down. Just before we reached the road below we again realized there were no white blazes. We did it again! Twice on the same day within just hours. Really! We continued down to the road and turned towards the monument as we knew from our research that a blue blaze trail ran from the AT to the monument. Just up the hill and around the corner we spotted the blue blaze trail which actually was more green than blue. We descended the blue blaze trail and moments later found ourselves intersecting the white blazes again. We turned left and continued to descend, still over rocks and roots.About four o'clock we heard the sound of running water. High Point shelter was listed as having water, perhaps we were near. Moments later we saw a blue blaze trail to our right. Event though we were hours behind schedule, we would likely never pass this way again in our life, so we followed the trail south and discovered a very nice shelter just over the creek. We took a break, dropped our pack on the table and retrieved the shelter log book. There in the log was an entry by Irover. IRover was here about 1 p.m. and stated that he had left his food bag in the bear box at Mashipacong shelter and had to double back the previous evening. Seems IRover passed us when I was having fun bushwacking. We dated our log entry and quickly resumed our hike.The trail from the shelter south was much improved and was mostly clear of rocks. We were able to increase our speed and make up some lost time. Shortly after leaving the shelter we were overtaken by a soon to graduate engineer who planned to go into ministry instead of engineering. We hiked together exchanging ideas until we reached Route 419 about 4:45. Our minister to be remained behind and we crossed the busy highway and continued southeast, now following the New York border somewhere to our left. The trail kept losing altitude as we went over small rises and down longer sections. We crossed several rock walls, pastures, and fences. At one point, just below a farm pond we missed a left turn and found ourselves wandering in wet swampy goo. Backing up to the fence we had just crossed we found the turn and followed long the pond's earthen dam. Every twenty or thirty minutes we crossed a road. Knowing we were near the Jim Murray property we kept a keen eye out for a non-descript sign saying ""water"" that signaled and unmarked route to Jim's property and the so-called ""secret"" shelter. Finally, just before 7:30 as we were tiring we spotted a small white sign on a tree across a recently graded dirt road saying ""water 100 yards"" and an arrow pointing left. Where we here finally? WE turned left and walked up the road to find on our left a grassy hillside with a water faucet and several small buildings, one of which we recognized from other hiker's photos online. Beside the main building we saw a small green tent. ""Hello in the tent!"" we hailed. We were surprised when instead of the now familiar IRover we saw an older woman's face appear. Oops! We apologized and headed uphill away from the tent to another building with a raised front porch at sitting height. We dropped our pack and started making camp using two old fruit trees nearby. After we hung our hammock we, started dinner. As we were cooking an older male approached. Was this Jim? No. Our visitor identified himself as the husband of the earlier lady in the tent. They were section hikers from Orlando and were finishing New Jersey at High Point State Park. They had a camper awaiting and were driving to Connecticut to finish a section there. We exchanged information on trail conditions and water availability and then wished each other well on the trail.As night fell, we sat on the porch eating tuna, hot pork Ramen soup, hot chocolate, and some of the Pepsi we had saved for this very moment. The sky had cleared and we had a great seat there on the porch as the stars slowly appeared in the night sky.Thus ended the fifth day.","Rutherford Shelter, NJ

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/346354,"""After camping at the Jim Murray property, we were on our way to Pochuck Shelter. We were able to get a great meal of pizza, ginger ale, OJ and a banana as well as some ibuprofen for the knee pain.""We arose at 8:30. Our plan was to clean up, sort our maildrop, and then head up the trail to Unionville, NY and our backup resupply point - Horler's Grocery. Our elder trail friends were packing up so we had breakfast and waited until they had cleared out before using Jim's shelter building which featured an indoor table and chair. We opened our box and sorted our food into five large ziplock bags. It was then we realized that we were hiking eleven days and not ten. Oops, one day short. Not to worry. We had planned to purchase a few meals along the way, so there would still be enough food to get us past the Hudson River six days hence.As Jim had a scale on the porch, we took time to weigh our now reloaded pack. The pack minus food & water weighed 24 pounds. Our Ursack with five days food weighed seven pounds. Our liter of water weighed two pounds for a total of 33 pounds. Our decision to hike earlier during cooler weather forced five pounds on us by using a full sleeping bag (+2) and larger pack (+3). We could have hiked a 19 pound pack and been below 30 pounds total.We sponged ourselves off, rinsed our shirt under the faucet, and set out for the trail.The trail southeast from Jim's property is good trail and we made good time to Unionville. Just prior to Lott Road, the trail passes a home with two large dogs that eagerly bark at hikers. A new memorial pond across the street sets a warm welcoming mood for visitors. We headed down Lott Road towards the town center. We confirmed the location of Horler's store with a passing teen on a bicycle. We checked the faucet at the town cemetery that guidebooks list as a water source. Off! Good thing we had topped off at Jim's place and didn't yet need water. We continued down the street to the T-intersection, turned left and had a short 1-2 block walk to Horler's store. Horler's features a wide porch wth several rocking chairs and low side tables. Per the notes taped to each table top, we dropped our packs and entered the store. Wow! Horler's is a great resupply and stopover. A three shelf grocery section contained nearly every desired hiker food: Pop-tarts, tuna packets, Ramen, mac & cheese, and more. A long ice cream freezer offered a bufet of treats. We were disappointed to discover that while Horler's carries HEET, they were out of stock. Troublesome, as we knew we were short fuel and there were no known sources ahead. We selected some orange juice from a wall of coolers containing most known beverages, including large individual beers. At the back deli we were also disappointed to discover the menu was mostly sandwiches. We were elated to be offered hot meat loaf that wasn't on the menu. $7 bought us a large chunk of meat loaf with two slices of bread, orange juice, a banana and a liter bottle of ginger ale. (We thought the ginger ale might help with our nausea and the empty bottle would provide extra water storage capability for the long dry sections ahead.) We sat outside in a rocking chair and slowly ate the meat loaf, unsure if we would be able to tolerate it as our appetite was non-existent. We managed to get everything down including a second bottle of orange juice.We had been told of a pizza place in town by the earlier teen and after lunch donned our pack and made our way to Annabel's Pizza just across the main intersection. Annabel's offers over a dozen pizzas by the slice at reasonable prices. Most of the days pizzas were based on chicken. They also offered a taco pizza and a Sicilian foccacia style pizza. For about $5, We bought two slices of the Sicilian as it was thick and sturdy and would likely survive when pushed into the top pocket of our backpack. The plan was to have a cold dinner and cold breakfast to save alcohol fuel and to cover the missing day of food. The proprietor topped off our water bottle as it didn't fit under the restroom faucet. With a fresh bottle of water, a liter of ginger ale, and short- and long-term food supplies, we headed back up the hill to the trail.We started following the white blazes a little before 2 p.m. The trail started off wide and level and then reverted to a narrower path crossing rock walls and damp muddy low areas. Before three we started a 2-mile road walk that took us across Pochuck creek and through the wildlife refuge. The long section of straight, flat trail enabled us to makeup lost time and provided some relief to our aching knee. About 3:30 we took a break just before leaving the refuge and started across more planks towards the ever looming Pochuck Mountain. I just love a long, steep climb after a day of backpacking, don't you?We crossed the highway and started up Pochuck. After about 15-minutes we were surprised to discover a wooden sign stating ""water"" and an arrow pointing to a white house off the trail. As a fellow hiker had reported the faucet off just weeks before, we didn't have much hope of there being water, but decided to check anyway. The faucet behind the abandoned house, now owned by the park service, was on and we filled both our water bottles. Now at an estimated maximum weight of around 38 pounds, we staggered back to the trail and continued the grinding slog up.Mercifully, Pochuck shelter is located just before the peak and we arrived at the blue blaze side trail around six. We dropped our pack on the picnic table and set about locating our trees for the evening. We had our dinner of pizza and ginger ale around 6:30. While eating, a dayhiker came by asking about the distance to highway 565. We figured he had about four miles to cover and less then 2 hours of daylight to get there, including doing two more short climbs after getting over Pochuck.Dinner done, we hung our mostly empty pack in the shelter and put our food and leftover ginger ale into the bear box. We discovered trash and two packets of M&Ms. We selected the peanut version and added it to our food bag for tomorrow's section. We retired to our hammock which we had sited to watch the sunset over Kittatiny ridge in the west. We could just barely find the High Point monument 2-days to our west.During the last moments of twilight, a section hiker named ""Oak"" came in for the night. Oak bushwacked his way towards our hammock and we visited for a few minutes. Oak had hiked from High Point and was flip-flopping back in the morning. We lit Oak's path back to the shelter with our headlamp.Thus ended the sixth day.","Jim Murray Property, NJ

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/346355,"""Happy mother's day to all the mom's! Today's hike took us through Heaven Hill Farm, Pinwheel's Vista, and Iron Mountain Road Bridge. The day ended at Wawayanda Shelter with five other hikers.""We arose at 7:30 a.m. and had breakfast with ""Oak"". During breakfast, Oak told us his hiking philosophy of ""NOW!"" If you see a nice place to sit, then do it now and take a seat as there may not be a better rock or log ahead. If you see water, then top off your water now as there may not be water ahead. We agreed with Oak and related how we had bought only one bottle of HEET at DWG and left two on the shelf for other hikers. Horler's was out of alcohol when we went by yesterday. Had we bought sufficient alcohol for our trip the first time, we wouldn't be rationing alcohol at this point. Oak stated that he was carrying extra alcohol fuel and gave us the extra fuel he didn't need for his trip back to High Point. Oak's generosity ensured we had sufficient alcohol until our endpoint. In return, we gave Oak some Benadryl lotion packets for a rash he had developed. (Oak's wife changed laundry soap prior to his trip and he suspected his skin was reacting to something in the new soap.)As we were finishing breakfast, an older male hiker in khaki shorts and shirt arrived at the shelter and asked where the water was. He identified himself as ""Half Fast"". We told Half Fast the water source for this shelter was back down the mountain where the sign in the middle of the trail said ""water."" Half fast had seen the sign but assumed there was water at the shelter ahead. Half Fast decided rather than backtrack, he would continue on. Oak mentioned this was yet another example of NOW!After breakfast and Oak's departure, we texted a Mothers' Day greeting to our spouse, cleaned up and broke camp.We departed Pochuck shelter about 10:15 and resumed our trek up and over Pochuck Mountain and two additional rises beyond. By 12:30 we had made it over all the climbs and had descended to Pochuck Creek bridge. After the bridge the trail improved to a grass path and our feet and knee were much relieved.After an hour of over hill and over dale we popped out of the woods to find a paved road with a housing development to our left and cars lining both sides of the road to our right. Across the road we saw a wooden pier extending across a wetland. We had arrived at the renown Pochuck boardwalk and a much anticipated part of our trip.We donned our hat for the exposed section of trail. The boardwalk was busy with dozens of small families out for a special Mothers' Day walk. We spent a bit of time pulling into the many waysides to allow groups to pass. That was more selfish on our part than chivalrous - we didn't want to be bumped off the narrow walk into the muck below. After a while we came to a shady, dry land section of trail and took a break sitting on the edge of the next section of boardwalk. We took our break NOW! rather than continue on under the bright sun. While sitting we caught up our log and checked our map and elevations. A passerby asked if we were lost. ""No, but thank you!"" (Actually, we wanted to say no and then ask if they were lost.) We continued down the second section and soon arrived at the famous suspension bridge. We paused to take some photos sans groups of people and then crossed over to the third section.The third section continued its winding across the wetland and then abruptly came to an end complete with rocks and planks. Eventually the planks gave way to muddy trail. We were amazed at the families crossing the muck. Several groups were coming head on from somewhere ahead. We passed through some bushes and then found ourselves crossing a pasture. Up ahead on the trail was a familiar figure in khaki shorts - Half Fast. We caught up to Half Fast just before crossing some train tracks and a second cow pasture.While crossing the second pasture we caught sight of Heaven Hill Farm, a popular thru-hiker rest stop. As we would one pass this way onece in our life, we told Half Fast of the tradition of stopping for ice cream and fruit. We had hopes of a slice of water melon and a cold bottle of orange juice. Half Fast joined us and we entered the farm around 3:00 to find picnic tables beside the main building and a water faucet just over by the wooden fence. Half fast wanted to air his feet so we left our pack in his care and went inside first. We were disappointed to discover a single narrow cooler with just Coke products, a small bakery and a single small ice cream freezer. We bought a Dr Pepper for $2.50 and a single scoop of lemon Italian ice for another $2.50. We returned outside and watched the packs as Half Fast went in and returned with a package of pastry. ""Tourist Trap"" was how Half Fast described the business. While we enjoyed the cold refreshments, particularly the tangy lemon ice, we did not feel that Heaven Hill Farm offered good value compared to our previous day's venture into Unionville, NY.Around 3:30 p.m., we left the ""farm"" and returned to the trail head. The trail head was full of cars as Wawayanda Mountain is a popular dayhike for locals. It was starting to look like rain and we had a long slow ascent of the steep hill ahead of us so we where anxious to stat up. Half Fast delayed and was debating diverting into nearby Vernon to the Episcopal Church hiker hostel. We were surprised up the trail when Half Fast came by while we were taking a scheduled water break. Half Fast had an orange bandanna pinned to the back of his pack. We made it a game to try and keep the orange banner in our site as it told us were the trail turned and set a faster pace for us to get over the obstacle. By 5:00 we had reached the peak of Wawayanda.We then started the agonizing section of ""down"". Our left knee reminded us of its displeasure with down. Around 7:30 as the available sunlight was rapidly disappearing behind Wawayanda, we arrived at Wawayanda shelter. We met ""Tulip"" and ""Crank"" who were having dinner. As the water source was 1/4 mile from the shelter, I offered to get water for both ourself and Half Fast. Half Fast preferred to go himself, but needed a bag to carry all the water bottles. We lent Half Fast our rope daypack we used for packing our spare clothes. While awaiting Half Fast, we pitched our hammock which neither Tulip nor Crank had ever seen used before. Half fast returned about 8:00 and soon after we were joined at the shelter by ""Sanford"" and our trail friend ""IRover"". Although they had just met, IRover and Half Fast both had a shared experience in Unionville, NY. Both had planned on camping in the city park and discovered the practice had long ended. Both ended up spending the night at the local bar in a large closet known as the ""Unionville Hostel"".After dinner on the rocking picnic table, we stored our food in the bear box and hung our pack inside the shelter. We hit the hammock, reviewed our notes and fell asleep well after hiker midnight (9 p.m. for the non-hikers reading).Thus ended the seventh day.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter, NJ

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/346356,"""Today was a rough day. My knee and feet were not doing well. We made it to Wildcat Shelter, but will be hiking back two miles to 17A in the morning to catch the bus to NYC.""We arose about 7:30 little suspecting today would be our last full day of section hiking. We instead felt excited as today we had planned to finish hiking another state and would get to visit the Cold Stone Creamery.Rather than eat our pre-packaged oatmeal and freeze dried apples with Fig Newtons, we opted for a bowl of hot Ramen soup and a cup of hot chocolate. While eating, Tulip and Crash appeared and started their breakfasts. As we had accumulated a number of bulky Fig Newtons, we offered them to the nooshing thru-hikers. Crash immediately confiscated the Fig Newtons explaining to Tulip, who was from Amsterdam, that Fig Newtons were not cookies and therefore she would not be interested in eating them. Tulip had a love for desserts and was eagerly enjoying nearly every American sweet, cake, or dessert she happened across. We found an overlooked packet of Fig Newtons and managed to pass them to Tulip without Crash's knowledge.We broke camp and carefully packed everything into its assigned place. Once again we were the last hiker to leave the shelter. It was 9:10 on our watch when we set forth. Our immediate goal was to visit the water source at the nearby visitor center for two liters of pure water (no iodine) and to get more pictures for our section hiking blog. Shortly after turning left onto the trail, we were turning right onto the blue-blaze trail to the visitor center. Both rails were fairly level and hazard free so we made good time. We dropped our pack onto the wide benches just outside the restroom doors, filled all three water bottles, and dug out our camera. While taking photos, a car pulled up and the driver asked if he could be in our photo. We when walked back, we exchanged info with the driver and discovered like ourselves he was an USAF veteran and worked on the RF-4C. We then wandered into the visitor center center and saw our one and only black bear. There stuffed and mounted was ""Bobby da Bear"".By 10 a.m. we were back on the Apalachian Trail and following the white blazes towards New York. The trail through Wawayanda State Park was relatively good. On entering the state forest the rail began to rise and we returned to large rocks.Around noon, we just knew we were close to the state line. Ahead of us loomed a large rise with few trees and a lot of sky visible beyond. One problem - the trail had turned into a climbing wall. Right after we clambered up part of the rise and made a left turn , we found ourself boxed in on three sides staring at a rock wall with a single white blaze above our head and few hand or foot holds. We tossed our poles up above us onto the ledge. We doffed our pack and similarly heaved it up over our head and onto the ledge. We were now committed to climb the wall and retrieve our gear or return to the state park empty handed. We took time to study the wall and work our our sequence of moves. Our rock ballet choreographed, we began our climb. About half-way up we looked behind us and saw a black snake sunning atop the rocks ledge behind us. The snake had raised its head as if to say ""Dude! Seriously?"" About that time we felt our left foothold give way and gravity kicked in. Feeling the rock about to scrape our patella from our left leg we pushed out from the rock and landed on our feet. Our second try was successful and we stood, not overlooking Greenwood Lake, but yet another down climb with a rise beyond that was clearly tree covered.Pushing on, we hiked along pink colored granite turned edge wise. We noticed as we hiked the wedging of our feet into the deep grooves was abrading the stitching along the side of our boots. Both boots had small gaps above the soles. Not good. Suddenly, a lone hiker appeared coming towards us - ""Mississippi Al"". We were elated to find we were just minutes from the state line. At 12:50, a large rock and a bright blue box attached to a nearby tree appeared. Behind the rock was a painted line labeled ""NJ | NY"". We dropped our pack on the large boulder, fished out the official ATC log book and made our entry. Tulip and Crash had long passed as had Half-Fast. We added our information below Mississippi Al's. Since we had been hiking for four hours, we decided to take an extended lunch break and fixed a salami tortilla wrap. That was washed down with the last of our Dr Pepper from Heaven Hill Farm.Looking at our hike plan and maps we realized we were two hours late arriving at the state line and still had nine miles to hike to the next shelter. Best case: we would be racing the sunset and arriving after 7:30 this evening. Worst case: we would have to stealth camp short of the shelter and its water source. Actually, there was an even worse case which we would soon discover.We donned our pack and set off north now taking miles from the New York section of the Appalachian Trail and elated to have completed yet another of the 14 states. A mile or so up the trail we set our right foot down and immediately had a shooting pain in the front sole of our foot. Great! Our left knee was again inflamed, our left little toe had been so battered that it was throbbing and the one foot and leg that had been taking up the slack and propelling us along was now lame. We slowed our hiking pace to less then one mile per hour. Forget Wildcat shelter, our ability to even make it out of the woods to NY Highway 17A before dark was now in doubt.We continued on and eventually heard water flowing and falling. A creek! Remembering Half Fast's axiom that soaking ones feet equaled two weeks of rest, we crossed over on teetering rocks and found a place to drop our pack and sit along side the flowing water. We took off our right boot and sock, massaged the sole and plunged our foot into the cold water. After several massages and soaks our foot felt much better. We put our sock and boot back on, donned our pack, and resumed our death march. Forget fun, forget scenery, our focus was now one of survival and self-rescue. We realized our hike was likely over and that we would exit the trail at the upcoming NY 17A. The question was when? Tonight or tomorrow?Just before 6 p.m. we heard the sound of rushing traffic and the trail began to level out and widen. The trail rose just to the left of an old burned out residence with ""No trespassing"" signs and then we were at the guard rail along NY 17A. A small blue sign across the highway said ""Cold Stone Creamery .2 miles"". Sounded good to us. We would hobble up to the creamery, get water, and decide on a course of action, perhaps over sweet, sugary ice cream. Enroute to the creamery a New Jersey Transit bus passed south bound towards New York City about 5-10 minutes after the hour. We also passed bus stops with signs on both side of the busy highway. This was our exit point. We wrote down the stop number and the number to text with SMS for a bus schedule. (SMS 'Stop #26259"" to 69287.)Cold Stone Creamery is just a wonderful place. Perched on a cliff side, it offers a white picket fenced area with picnic ables and a clean, efficient ice cream parlor. All products are made by the creamery including five varieties of glass bottled soft drinks. Not wanting to take up premium space in front of the creamery, we set our pack down on picnic table next to the parking area and topped our two water bottles of at the faucet on the side of the building. Unlike the earlier Heaven Hill Farm, Cold Stone Creamery offered homemade at reasonable prices resulting in a feeling of ""good value."" We weren't enticed by the ice cream, but found the glowing orange glass bottle on the back shelf a siren call. $1.69 got us an orange soda to rival Fanta and which surpassed any foreign orange soda we had ever imbibed.With about one and a half to two hours of sunlight remaining, we decided to damn the sore feet and knee and head up the trail to Wildcat shelter. We would hike back to the creamery and bus stop the next morning. Our left foot was not happy with the decision, but a fresh wave of endorphins allowed us to continue down the highway and onto the flat, wide trail headed north to Wildcat shelter.The first mile passed quickly and we felt good about our decision to pass the night at a legal camp site safely distant from the road crossing and any local hooligans. Our second mile began with another bouldering exercise. A nearby blue blaze offered an alternative route around the rocks, but we decided the shortest, quickest route was up and over. On the other side the trail descended and a quarter mile later presented a second bouldering exercise. Oh, goody. We made it over the large pile of rocks and continued down the trail. Just after crossing a shallow running stream we saw the blue-blaze trail on our left heading downhill to Wildcat shelter. Heading don over yet another rocky trail we found ourself in a wet, muddy lowland and lost sight of the blue blazes. WE also could not see the shelter which should have been visible. ""Hello in the shelter"" we called out. ""Hello"" in a familiar voice came the reply. ""Half Fast, is that you? Where's the shelter?"" We turned to our right and started bushwhacking towards Half Fast's position. Moments later we saw a footlocker style bear bx chained to two trees and then the shelter looming above us surrounded by boulders. Lovely, just lovely. More up.We hobbled up to the shelter and dropped our pack on the raised shelter floor opposite Half Fast. Already dusky, we spotted a pair of trees just past the shelter along the ""cliff"" and quickly hung our hammock and tarp. Half fast turned in so we quietly went about starting and eating dinner. After dinner, we decided against hobbling down and back to the bear locker and hung our Ursack on a small tree on the opposite side of the shelter from our hammock. Our final test of the Ursack in black bear territory.It being almost hiker midnight we hung our boots on the foot of our hammock, hung our socks on the tarp line above, and turned in for the night.Thus ended the eighth day.","Wawayanda Shelter, NJ

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/347954,"We awoke at 6:50 a.m. with our knee and feet still sore. We found five large, new blisters on our feet, including both heels. It was clear that we were done hiking as there was no reasonable justification for continuing through twenty-miles of remote forest and park. The next best exit past NY17A was at the Hudson River where we could catch a bus or train to NYC depending on which bank we were standing upon.We lay in our hammock and wrote ""Da' Plan"" in our notebook.DA' PLAN1) Hike back to NY 17A to Cold Creek Creamery.2) Take a sponge bath & change into clean clothes in restroom.3) Catch NJ Transit bus #197 to New York City.4) Hobble to Big Apple Hostel.5) Hobble to Times Square Walgreens and buy slippers.6) Adjust return bus ticket at Greyhound in Port Authority terminal.We heard Half Fast breaking camp. We wished him well and arose shortly after his departure. Without endorphins to dull the pain, each foot step was painful. We gave considerable thought to each movement and sought to maximize each trip. We took our sleeping bag, boots, socks, and pad with us to the picnic table when we first left the hammock. Our goal was to minimize any further trauma to our sole means of exiting the trail. It was at this point that we mentally thrashed ourself for not having decided to stealth camp much closer to the highway. We had given to our vanity and made a poor decision, when safety should have been foremost.We managed to retrieve our Ursack from the tree and made a hot breakfast. After breakfast we left our bottle of remaining HEET in the shelter to benefit another hiker. We took down our hammock and packed our pack. As we packed we gave thought to the coming sequence of events and loaded the pack with our clean clothes on top, followed closely with our hygiene kit and wash cloth. Satisfied that we were ready to go, we made the final entry of our trek in the Wildcat shelter log book. It was now about 10:30 and two elder hikers, the Stapletons, suddenly appeared with small daypacks and they began to explore the shelter area. The couple was slackpacking sections of the trail. As theelders departed, we gave a big sigh and worked our way down and around to the blue-blazes and the trail ""home.""After making the right turn south on the white blazed AT, we paused at the sole water source between Wildcat shelter and NY 17A. We should only need one bottle of water to get back to the highway, a scant 2 miles distant. We had one liter of pure water from the creamery remaining and an empty liter bottle from dinner and breakfast. Oak's words leaped into our thoughts; ""Now. Do it now."" We filled the empty bottle and dropped two iodine tablets. In 15-minutes, we'd have 2 liters of potable water.We crossed the stream and continued south with slow deliberate steps. In just a few 10ths of a mile we came upon a hiker in an orange Cabela's balcap taking a break just off the trail. ""Hey, IRover! I'm leaving the trail. That section from the state line to 17A just tore my feet up. I can't continue. Thought you smoked cigars on your breaks!"" ""I was just about to lit one,"" was IRover's reply. We wished each other well and I turned and resumed my slow walk south. I felt sad that I was leaving my hiking companion for the past week. Although we never hiked together, we had each known and been aware of the other's presence for tens of miles through logs and chance encounters.About a half-hour later we found ourselves looking up at the first of two bouldering exercises we had no wish to participate in. We opted to hike the blue-blazed safety route around the hazard. We did the same when the second set of boulders came into view. Just after the second and final set of boulders, the trail became wide,level and mostly rock and root free. This provided much relief to our left knee.About noon we heard cars and then saw NY 17A through the trees below us. We exited the woods at 12:10 p.m. and started up the hill past the sign announcing the creamery ahead. Two tenths we told ourselves. Just another two tenths.As we limped up hill we saw the hot dog stand across the road was open and there was a table and two open chairs available. As it was lunchtime and the creamery offered only ice cream and soft drinks we made our way across the highway and towards a chair. Digging out our change purse, we ordered a hot dog with cooked onions and a cold can of Lipton sweet tea and paid the princely sum of $3. The cooked onions were nothing special to us, but the tea hit the spot.Fed, we donned our pack and continue our hobble over the final tenth towards the creamery. We paused at the bus stop sign and wrote down the stop number and telephone number for schedule information. We made it across the rhighway, took the short cut over a small dirt berm and made base camp on the first picnic table in front of the creamery. Phase 1 of Da Plan was complete.We went inside the creamery which had just opened and asked the sole person at work for a birch beer and permission to change clothes in their restroom due to our injuries and need to catch the bust to NYC. We sat outside and enjoyed our birch beer and waited for the few customers to leave before we monopolized the restroom. When all but two women in front of us had left, we asked the two ladies if they would mind our tying up the rest room for an extended period. ""No, go ahead"" was their reply. We grabbed our backpack and entered the restroom. We worked fast and removed our boots and socks, flipped open our pack and removed the plastic bag with our clean spare clothes and waiting wash cloth. Off went the stinky set, we gave ourselves a quick wipe down with a nwe warm, wet washcloth and began to dress. Suddenly there was an urgent knock on the door. ""Be right out shortly!"" was our reply. We hurried to finish dressing and repack our dirty clothes. A second urgent knock cam quickly. We grabbed our boots, clean socks and backpack and exited the restroom for the unknown person. An older woman we didn't recognize pushed past us saying something about our changing clothes in the restroom. We headed back to the picnic tale and finished putting on our socks and, with much reluctance, our boots. Phase 2 was now complete.As we finished the women exited the restroom and scolded us for having left boot prints and leaves on the floor. Didn't we note how clean the creamery kept the restroom? ""Ma'am, we left before we could clean up after ourself as we thought you needed to urgently use the restroom. We'll gladly clean the restroom."" The lady disappeared inside the creamery and re-appeared moments later. ""I'm sorry. I acted hastily."" She drove off in a little sports car that was not there when we first went in to change. We went inside to the counter and asked for a broom and mop to clean the restroom. We found one small bootprint and a few small bits of leaf on the floor and thought they paled to the toilet paper scattered nearby and behind the trashcan. We swept and mopped the floor, wiped down the sink really well and buffed the chrome which clearly had received such attention for a very long time.It was coming up on two o'clock. Remembering seeing a bus just after 6, an even hour, we texted the stop number and received an immediate reply. The next buses came by at 2:10, 4:10 and 6:15. We turned in our cleaning supplies and empty bottle, thanked the young lady for assisting us in our need, and set off to await our bus.Almost on the exact moment the bus came around the curve below. We held up our hand and the bust slowed and then stopped. The door opened just inches in front of us. Wow! (Last year in Carlisle, PA the bus went past us a considerable distance and we had to hustle on blistered feet.) We stepped up inside and found the front seats vacant. The driver said to take a seat and pay him in a few moments at a stop below in Greenwood Village. The fare to NYC was just $12.75!The bus ride into the city took about three hours. Normally, it was just over two, but we arrived at the start of rush hour and it took some time to get through the Lincoln Tunnel. We arrived on the top floor of the Port Authority. Our driver let off most of the passengers and then pulled the bus forward to drop me off in front of the escalator going down into the terminal. (Thank you, Ron!) Phase 3 of Da' Plan was complete.We exited the escalator and found ourselves in a shopping gallery with no familiar landmarks. Across thew wide passageway we saw a ""You are here"" map and got our bearings. We were one floor above and very near to the Greyhound ticket counter. We made our way slowly to the escalators going down. Once off we slowly hobbled towards Greyhound. We handed our ticket to the lady behind the ticket counter and asked to have our ticket adjusted to an earlier bus, but one that would arrive during daylight hours. ""That will be $15."" Your bus leaves at ten o'clock. Phase 6 was complete.With a new return ticket in hand, we went in search of food and something to drink as eating and drinking on a NJ Transit bus will get you removed. We found a large deli with one of the largest walls of drinks we've ever seen and what seemed like a mile of glass fronted counters filled with delicious panini's and hot entrees. After making a single pass along the entire length, we decided on a fruit bowl and lemonade. We sat at a table and relished every bite of fruit - from little grapes to large chunks of cantaloupe. Fruit, glorious fruit! (to paraphrase a well known musical).Fed, we fired up our phone and called the Big Apple Hostel to cancel our reservation two nights hence. We only take cancellations by Internet was the answer. We explained our situation and the desk clerk replied she'd cancel our reservation for us and send us the cancellation by email. Phase 4 was complete.Six o'clock, four hours until our bus. We donned our pack and started back towards te greyhound terminal. We saw a pharmacy and went in hoping to find slippers. There against the back wall were several varieties of slippers. We found Chinese made set that cleverly consisted of a sole and two wide flaps that secured with Velcro. Nothing to touch our inflamed toes or heels. Perfect and just $7. We also found ice cream and soft drinks at reasonable prices. We added an ice ream sandwich. Also, along the route back we passed a bread shop that also offered hot soup in 6-8 flavors. We added an apple pastry and a hard roll for later in the evening or for breakfast. Phase 5 and Da' Plan were complete.As we resumed our slow walk we passed a pub that had been opened earlier, but now had locked doors and a sign to enter from Second Street. Disapointment. We had planned for months to have a cold beer after checking in to the hostel. With our bunk canceled it seemed so was our cold beer. The lady manning the nearby information booth informed us we could find beer at McAnn's one floor above us. We turned around and headed back to the central escalators. McAn's was behind them to our right. Miraculously, a single table and stool just inside the door were clear and unoccupied. We doffed the pack, set it in the corner behind us and took a seat. No one glanced or even came by. We wet over to the counter and ordered the seasonal Sam Adams beer. ""We don;t have one."" We bought a Sam Adams lager for the sum of $6. More than we prefer to pay for beer, so we nursed it while updating our notebook. We event took time to draft a hiking schedule to start at NY 17A and complete New York state.We left the bar about nine and headed down to the basement and our departure gate. We sat on the floor of a nearby gate and changed from our bots into clean ""bus socks"" and our new slippers. We pulled our Ursack, which we had packed that morning with snacks and foods suitable for the bus ride, and a water bottle out of our pack along with an over-sized duffle bag which doubles as a rain cover. We dropped our backpack inside and affixed the official Greyhound baggage tag to the straps.We had seen a teenage girl sitting nearby who seemed tired but didn't look American by her coat, scarf, and pale complexion. We were concerned that she may have been lured to the U.S. for work and was in the process of being exploited. ""Paruski?"" we inquired. Ukraine. ""Ah, Oo-krain-sky-ya. Men-ya za-voot Timofye Pavlich."" She seemed a bit cheerier that someone spoke some Russian. She lit up even more when later a group of young adults came into view and she recognized a girl friend. The group were exchange students headed for Williamsburg, VA and Kill Devil Hills, NC for legitimate summer jobs. We felt relieved.Our bus arrived and was quickly loaded. The seat beside us was one of the last to be filled. A young man of Asian background sat down. ""I'm from South Korea"" he said. ""Anyo hasaeyo"" we replied. He was momentarily stunned, but his look of surprise said it all. ""How do you know Korean?"" ""I lived there for a year long ago."" As the bus pulled out of the terminal and the tunnel, we had a final look at New York City while exchanging bits of Korean. I would say goodbye to Jool in Asheville, NC the next afternoon.Thus ended the ninth and final day of our 2011 section hike of the Appalachian Trail.","Wildcat Shelter, NY
","NY 17A, NY","May 10, Tue",2
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/385721,"Arrived in New York City about 7:00 am. after a 31 hour bus ride via Columbus OH & Pittsburg PA. Enroute to Grand Central Terminal to catch the Metro North to Kent we stopped by a McDonalds on 42nd St. Discovered no Sweet Tea, a 30-minute dining room limit upstairs, and no plugs for charging cell phones. We ate our takeaway at famed Bryant Park behind the public library. Had the park mostly to ourselves as to our surprise NYC is not full of early risers. Streets were largely empty of traffic and pedestrians when our hometown of Little Rock would be teeming with commuters.After a quick walk around the library exterior and watching a group photo session of workers who restored the library facade, we entered Grand Central terminal. Its everything and more you've seen in movies. Our ticket for the 9:40 a.m. departure was just $16. After securing our ticket we sought again to charge our phone. The few visible sockets we tried were all turned off and there was no charging stands as at many Greyhound stations. We wandered down to the lowest level were the food court is found. Much like at Union Station in DC, there is a wide availability of food available, although most eateries did not open until 9:00 a.m. We found Lamb pitas for $8.50, Thai food for $8.95 to 9.95, croissants for $6.95, and four water fountains all capable of refilling 1 liter water bottles, which we did. We found a spot on a large wooden bench and people watched a while and we're people watched ourselves by a NYPD officer and his dog.About 9:15 we headed back upstairs and boarded our train which was air conditioned, unlike the immediate track area which was stifling hot. Immediately after departure the conductor asked for our ticket and we were on our way north to CT. After leaving the city we passed through a greenway with lakes and quaint towns and stations. At Southeast station we're scheduled to debark and switch to another train for our final leg. However, arriving at Southeast were directed to a waiting bus as there was a blockage somewhere north. The bus turned out to be a blessing as it paralleled the tracks and went to the stations before and just past where the A.T crosses Highway 20. So we got a good look at Pawling, the nursery and the various delis and gas stations along the way.We arrived at TenMile River station well before our arranged 1:00 p.m. shuttle pickup. We called the outfitter in Kent and notified them of our arrival. We were promptly picked up and delivered to the outfitter at our request for the sum of $25. We bought 10 ounces of denatured alcohol for $.30/ounce and charged our phone. The outfitter accepts mail drops and there were many already awaiting hikers. After getting our phone from one bar to three, we donned our pack and headed west on Macedonia Road to the the trail. The first half of the roadwalk was sunny & hot and we were relieved to find shade after clearing the town. The trail north goes over a fence ladder and then down across grassy fields. Our trail south went up and was full of rocks. After climbing 20 minutes we heard flowing water and found the blue blazed trail west to Algo shelter. As we were running an hour behind schedule, we opted not to visit the shelter and continue up.We made it over the first hill, over a creek, and then up and over a second hill. We thought we had missed the campground and were further along than planned. At 6:25 we met Scrog and later around 6:50 we met Spicekit and moments later Blue. The afternoon was extremely hot and all the thru-hikers we met were suffering as much as ourself. The one exception was Blue. Blue looked like she was out for an afternoon stroll. About 7 p.m. we found a clearing along the trail with two ideally spaced trees and hung our hammock for the evening. Even though we could see a cell tower across the valley and count antennae elements, it took several tries to get an SMS text message out.","Kent, CT
","Shaghticoke Mountain campsite, CT","Jun 21, Thu",3.20
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/385722,"We awoke about 5:30 a.m. and immediately set about breaking camp to take advantage of the cooler morning temps. About 6:00 a.m. we discovered that we were not as far around Shaghticoke Mountain as we first thought and clearly had not passed the campsite, as there it was in front of us. We doffed our pack, pulled out our Ursack, boiled water from the creek and had a hot breakfast of oatmeal, fig bars, and hot chocolate. After breakfast we topped off both water bottles, dropped iodine, took a photo and resumed the march south.8:00 found us at the first NY/CT sign and the weather was already hot, humid and dead calm - no wind at all.By 8:45 we were already starting the descent down towards Bulls Bridge. We took a rest stop and switched out our water bottles. We also met 3 hikers (Kim, Kim & a guy). The trail at this point was well groomed and we were moving faster. Around 9:15 we met NOBO thrus Trail Dance, Strider, and Fog. Just after that encounter, we encountered a black rat snake crossing the trail ahead of us. During our 10:15 rest stop, Willie Boy headed up past us with a soaking wet long sleeved fishing shirt. Willie Boy reminded us that one of the fastest ways to cool off is to lay on the large rocks. We knew that trick, but it was tucked so deep in our brain that we weren't practicing it.About a half-hour later, we stopped on a large log and took an extended water break. No sooner had we started than more thru hikers appeared and we met Chuckie the Fish, and Princess Goah. Shortly after setting off the trail made a final set of long switchbacks and we found ourselves at a small stream. Being nearly out of water and an unknown distance from Bulls Bridge, we remembered Oak's advice from 2011; ""Now!"" We filled one bottle with water, but held off the iodine. Just a few moments below the stream we crossed a low stone wall strewn with a half dozen empty gallon water jugs. Some found trail magic, but not us.At the bottom of the mountain we found ourself on a gravel road and made a right turn and started a road walk. Being largely sunlit, we donned our wide brimmed hat. After about a mile we heard cars and soon intersected the road to Bulls Bridge. Knowing of a convenience store just across the bridge, we turned east and headed to the bridge. Just before the bridge we stopped on one of the many boulders lining the highway to prevent parking to drink the last of our pure water. Bandaid and Laces, a thru hiking couple, were headed back to the trail as we were about to depart. We crossed through the covered bridge, over an old canal, and cut across a gravel parking lot and a small mown field to the now visible c-storeThe Country Mart is an oasis for long-distance hikers. We found nearly desired re-supply item, including BIC mini lighters. We purchased a 20 oz. apple juice, a 1 liter Mountain Dew, and 1 liter of water (we wanted a 3rd clear bottle based on our consumption rate). We adjourned to the two picnic tables out front and drank our apple juice straight down and amazingly (to us) our entire Mountain Dew. While foraging in our UrSack for something to eat, Gato suddenly appeared from across the field. Lightening Jack appeared about ten minutes later while we were setting on a milk crate under a window shade eating some tuna with mayo. After the tuna, which contained extra salt, we started on our liter of water. Moments after drinking pure water, we were seized with massive cramps in both legs and in all the big muscles. It was as if someone had flipped a switch or opened a valve and were torturing us. Pain! Massive pain! An 11 on a 10-point scale! We tried to walk and could only hold ourself up between the two tables. Thoughts of calling 911 and being carted off to a hospital in an ambulance flashed in our brain. Was our hike so quickly and easily over? We kept trying to stand and walk and eventually the cramps began to subside. We grabbed both our poles and hobbled across the highway to a shady strip and paced back and forth in full view of Gato.The cramps gone, we returned to the tables and packed for departure. We headed back across the field and gravel lot, took photos of the bridge and headed back to the trail. We had two options. Take the first blue blaze trail to the left which intersected the A.T., but followed the river south or walk on further to the white blazed A.T. and miss the river. We opted for the more scenic blue blazed trail. Our choice provided us a well groomed trail along a small bluff overlooking the river below. We were disappointed when we regained the white blazes and the trail disappeared into high grass and brush.Shortly after passing under power lines, we arrived in a fir thicket with a trail intersection and no guiding blazes. The wear of the trails indicated we should turn left. Good decision, as minutes later we found ourself on a metal foot bridge over a Housatonic River tributary. To our surprise, when we stepped off the bridge we found a large grassy field and saw an elevated privy. Were we at the Ten Mile shelter. We didn't see anything resembling the shelter photos we had studied pre-trip nor was there a shelter sign. There was a sign announcing Ten Mile campsite. Huh! We dutifully took out our phone to document the site with a photo for a future blog post. While examining the site, the wind suddenly picked up, dark clouds began to appear and we decided that due to our earlier cramps, a clearly approaching storm and a four mile hike over a hill to the next shelter that we would go ahead and make camp for the day. No sooner had we pitched our hammock and rigged the trap as a lean-to than it began to rain. As we listened to the storms increasing intensity we could also hear the flow of the adjacent river increase in volume. We just hung snug in our hammock with feet elevated and enjoyed the solitude.Just after dark, the fireflies came out. Hundreds and hundreds of fireflies were hovering over the grassy field by the privy flashing their lights in search of a date. We were enjoying the event until one lone, off course firefly floated in front of us and lit his glow plug. FLASH! Our eyes were so accustomed to the dark we actually had a moment of flash blindness.The rain continued off and on until dawn.","Shaghticoke Mountain campsite
","Ten Mile campsite, CT","Jun 22, Fri",5.50
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/385723,"Morning found us with everything damp, except for a patch beneath our tarp were our pack was resting. We dug out our stove and retrieved our now wet UrSack and headed over to the sole bench to fix breakfast. We decided on a salami wrap instead of oatmeal and apples, but washed the wrap down with some hot chocolate. After a quick trip to the privy, we broke camp and hit the trail about 7:45a to partly cloudy skies. Shortly after turning south out of the campsite we arrived at signage announcing the shelter area uphill. A map showed the shelter, a privy, and recommended camping areas. As our phone still had a limited charge we opted to press on and skip a photo.Just after the blue blazes to the shelter, the trail made a sharp left turn and began its rise over the first notable hill of the day. About 100 yards up we crossed a fire road used to access the shelter. Another hiker had arranged sticks in the shape of the AT symbol, much as we had found along a gravel road in PA during our 2010 section hike. We took a break around 9 a.m. and Hemlock and Granny Bus happened along sectioning north to Bulls Bridge. At 9:20 the snake of the day appeared, a common ribbon snake. About an hour later we discovered a dead mouse in the middle of the trail. We wandered past rewriting Loudon Wainwright III's skunk lyrics to fit the deceased mouse.Around 10:45 the trail descended down some rock steps to shallow water flowing across the trail. As we were below the surrounding ground level, we decided it was bath time. After filling and cooking another 2l of water, we unclipped our washcloth, stripped off our shirt, and sponged down away from the water source. We also dragged our t-shirt through the water and rung it out away from the water. We didn't realize it, but we were very close to entering NY.At 11 a.m. we crossed the CT/NY and just past a kiosk welcoming hikers from a nearby trailhead met the infamous Gunrunner, who had been hiking with Mouse. For several days we would spot Gunrunners telltale cigar butts that he left to taunt others behind him.We arrived at the Wiley shlter at Noon and took off our pack for an extended break and to eat. We opened our new honey peanut butter packet and made a wrap with a tortilla and washed everything down with lemonade.Being tired and a bit nauseous from the heat and exertion, we extended our break reading the shelter log until our new calories kicked in and we felt better.After setting off south we continued up past Wiley shelter and started cruising along a high level section. Just after 2 p.m. we met Haystack, Cool Breeze and three dayhikers from the morning train. A little further and we met a group of men with a young boy in tow. The group was headed for the Wiley shelter. They explained they had visited the shelter area earlier in the week and stashed a large quantity of beer nearby. Glad we weren't staying at the shelter that night and will recommend to others that you avoid the Wiley shlter on Saturday nights unless you're looking for the party crowd.About 4:00 we arrived at a long section of boards. In the midst of no where with no blazes we intersected another board section. We opted to continue straight ahead and not turn. This turned out to be the correct choice as once we got off the boards we started seeing the familiar white blaze. Just before 4:30 we arrived at the edge of the woods, atop a hill looking over farm fields and hearing cars in the distance. We were near the train tracks and the nursery we passed on the bus two days ago. Heading down the hill we met Teflon coming up. Teflon confirmed the new pizza trailer was waiting at the highway below. We continued downhill in full sun. We climbed over three electric fences using fence ladders. After the last fence we hiked down a well worn path past another kiosk and then we reached the highway. To our right was a rest area with the bright yellow pizza trailer. Across the highway to our left was the nursery. We headed across to the nursery and dropped our pack on the porch of the now closed business. A group of four thru-hikers were gathered at the far end disassembling mail drop boxes and stuffing their packs. We sat in a rocker across a side table from Parmesan. She informed me about the posted rules. We located the water spigots around back and filled all our bottles. She also pointed out the two electrical outlets along the wall of the goldfish pond. We plugged in our phone and headed across the highway to the pizza trailer. $2.50 bought us a generous slice of cheese pizza and another $1.50 added a can of orange soda. Returning to the nursery and our pack, we munched on our pizza. Scott the on-site caretaker arrived shortly after. Scott pointed out where the assembled hikers could camp on the property. We headed over a rigged our hammock above some weeds using a tall fence post and a nearby tree. We were awakened several times in the night by repositioning trains and passing trucks.","Ten Mile campsite, CT
","Pawling, NY","Jun 23, Sat",12.10
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/385724,"Sunday morning found us up at 6:30, before most of the encamped thru-hikers. We quietly moved our pack and then hammock to the nearby porch and dug out our stove set and UrSack. Noting a round picnic table just around the corner, we walked over, set up our alcohol stove and boiled a pint of water. Breakfast was a bowl of pork Ramen soup, beef & cheese sticks, and hot chocolate. By 7:30 we had dried out a dew covered hammock and poncho liner, packed up, taken photos, and refilled water bottles.We left the nearby Appalachian Trail train station about 7:45 after pausing to take photos of the station and the adjacent board walk. While crossing the board walk we found a pair of ribbon snakes sunny on the wooden structure. One slithered over into the wetlands on our approach. The board walk was short and at the end we began a sharp ascent up a steep hill. Once atop the hill the trail began a gradual descent south following along the edge of farms fields.Around 9:15 we met Achey Breaky headed north. Fifteen minutes later we arrived at West Dover Road and the famed Dover Oak, the oldest oak tree on the A.T.. The Dover Oak was a bit sad as rather than being amid trail inside the nature preserve, the tree's trunk is just feet from asphalt and ringed with reflective u-posts. While taking the requisite photo of the oak tree we noted a purple house behind us. The purple house was significant as the guide books reference a purple house as a source for tap water. We wandered over to the drive way and then down the gravel drive. We were met with a snarling dog inside the fence. The owner was out in her yard enjoying a cup of coffee and told us to leave our poles near the driveway entrance. Monty the dog had been beaten as a pup by homeless people in New York City. Smelly hikers with poles trigger an deep set imprint. Holly was delightful and we learned about her husband's demise, her landscape background, and the use of the Dover Oak as a rendezvous point for local drug dealers. We topped out water bottles off with the hose and spigot at the end of the driveway. [For hikers, leave the hose alone, turn the tap, wait for the warm water to flush out, fill your bottles, turn off and leave. Don't ask first, particularly early in the morning. Don't handle the hose.] Waving goodbye to Holly and Monty we resumed out southbound walk around 9:45.Ten minutes later while ascending Cat Rock our left little toe felt uncomfortable. We treated a small blister with a band-aid wrapped in duct tape. Around 10:15 we met Lime Green, who matched his name by wearing shorts and shirt with bright lime green accents. We reached Telephone shelter at 10:35 and took a water break while reviewing and updating the shelter log.We reached the summit of West Mountain around 11:30. The trail then leveled out and became well groomed. We moved along easily and thought good thoughts about the crew that built this section. Around 11:50 we felt hot spots on our right foot and shortly after spotted a large rock we dubbed ""rest stop rock"". We sat down, unstrapped our pack, and removed our shoes and socks. While we didn't find any new blisters, we wrapped three toes in duct tape as preventative medicine. While we dumped heat from our feet, we ate a fudge covered granola bar and reviewed our hiking plan. We calculated arriving at much anticipated Nuclear Lake around 2:30 p.m..After donning our socks, shoes, and pack, we resumed our cruise along the trail south. We were surprised when a little after 1 p.m. we arrived at Nuclear Lake and a kiosk with a map of surrounding trails. We hiked a bit around the lake until we came to an old rock wall and several well placed rocks suitable for a lunch break. We ate some tuna in oil with extra mayonnaise and drank the last of a Mt Dew we reserved from the evening before. While we were dining, a local couple passed through on a circuit of the lake. By 2:05 we had finished our meal, hiked around the lake to the opposite end and met the LaPolla family of Poughkeepsie NY. Joe the father had noted me refilling my water bottles from the lake when he announced they had some left over iced water, that would be discarded back at their car, and would I like it. You betcha! While transferring the water I filled the family in on the concept of trail magic. Iced water was probably the best trail magic I could have received at that moment. I started walking off with the family chatting and walked past the A.T. returning to the woods. We said our goodbyes and I back tracked 20 yards and followed the white blazes south.A bit after departing Nuclear Lake we arrived at a very busy NY 55. Playing Frogger for keeps, we darted across the highway hoping a speeding car would not suddenly appear over the nearby rise. Our notes said to look down the hill for a yellow school bus which was actually a hotdog stand. No bus was in view. We continued into the woods on some nice trail, but littered with broken glass. After a mile we popped out of the woods to Old Highway 55 and saw a yellow school bus just up the hill. We walked just up the stret and discovered not a food truck, but the storage yard for local school buses. Disappearing again into the brush the trail descended rocks steps to a nice wooden bridge over a boulder strewn creek. As the end of the bridge was about chair height, we sat down and dropped our pack. Checking our hiking plan we were now about 3 miles from the next shelter to our south and on time to arrive well before dark. We set off south and crossed a set of railroad tracks which a section we noted had been nicely paved for hikers.We continued our march as the trail began to slowly rise and continued to rise for some time. Feeling fatigued we arrived at a gravel road around 5:00 and noted blue blazes on the adjacent trees. In fact, there were three blue blazes indicating both a a left and a right turn. We didn't recall any discussion of a road leading to the shelter. Presently we heard construction noises from over the hill and decided to continue on.Our fun meter was well into the red zone. We were out of our comfort zone and muttering about the faux blue blazes and where was that dang shelter. After an hour we started to hear people from off to our left and moments later spotted the front of an A.T. shelter. Already at the site where Deb & Ian from Atlanta, Stray Dog, and Mel. We slouched over to the sunken fire pit which Deb was stoking and stated; ""I'm tired, hungry, and want to throw up and I don't know which to do first."" Deb recommended sitting a bit, which we did while sipping on diluted Propel.After 10-15 minutes the nauseousness waned and we wandered behind the shelter to locate a pair of trees for the evening. Trees located we hung our hammock and tarp and prepped our bed. We grabbed our food bag, stove, fuel bottle and water and headed back to the pit. Where there was once smoke there was now a small fire. Stray Dog put his pot on a provided grate while we started our nightly boil. We started with our soup while some garlic mashed potatoes rehydrated in our freezer bag cozy. We managed to get all our potatoes eaten with the help of some hot chocolate. We inquired about water and were directed to the pump well down hill from the shelter. We took all three of ours and inquired if anyone else needed water. There being no takers we set off down a steep downhill and found a quaint, but large hand pump. After three full strokes water gushed forth, but not into the small opening of our plastic bottle. Someone left a cutoff water bottle at the pump which we used to collect and pour the precious well water into our assembled bottles. We carefully made our way back up hill hoping we wouldn't snap a tendon due to the steepness. Pleasantly full and with water for the morning, we headed off to our hammock for the night. Around 10:45 it began to rain and continued to rain through the night.","Pawling, NY

Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646387,"This is the section. Springer Mountain, GA to Damascus, VA. 470 miles.
With a mid-April start date, Megabus ticket in hand and my shuttle to the Amicalola Falls coordinated, this year's section hike is falling into place.
I have swapped out my vintage 5 pound backpack for a modern lightweight 65L pack. Base weight today is 20 pounds with 7 pounds of food and fuel, plus water. I'm using LighterPack to work on shaving off a few pounds to be between 17-18 pounds base weight. 
For those curious about my gap in TrailJournals.com entries, I dislocated a knee cap in late 2013 and then broke the same leg two years later. I most recently had a heart attack in mid-2021. I've spent considerable time in rehab working to regain my ability to backpack. Training for this year's extended hike has been progressing well. (OK, I did try to break an ankle a few weeks ago, but that too is healing nicely.) 
I look forward to meeting and traveling with this year's class. Many of you late starters will be passing me by.",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Tue",0
Hodag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646892,"So, I had a heart attack in July 2021 due to overexertion. Someone was having way too much fun with their shovel while out in the garden. 
In addition to a acquiring an expensive, shiny new stint, I had the opportunity to undergo cardiac rehabilitation at a local hospital. The staff have helped me regain my ability to backpack again, but in a safer, informed manner.
My local hospital offers a healthy heart program for just $35/month. Take advantage of these facilities and professionals, if you have access. My program has three exercise days each week. Weight, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen levels are checked before, during and after exercise by medical staff. Most of the equipment provides immediate feedback on my pulse and also my energy expenditure in metabolic equivalent (METs).
METS are a system to measure how hard you're exercising. One MET is sitting still. Two METs is twice the energy of sitting and so on. Backpacking averages about 7 METS. At least once, A.T. hikers backpacking the Virginia triple crown section have been connected to heart rate monitors. While their energy expended ranged from 3 to 13 METs, ""... the absolute intensity during hiking averaged 6.6 METs ..."" during their five day section. METs are my carrot.
A safe way to build up METs is with a treadmill. Charts and calculators are available that convert speed in mph and grade in degrees into METs. For example, 3 mph at 4% grade is 5 METs. So is 2.2 mph at 8% grade and 1.4 mph at 15% grade. The Bruce stress test used by cardiologists typically starts at 1.7 mph at 10% grade for 4.6 METs for three minutes. Next is 2.5 mph at 12% grade for 7 METs. Then 3.4 mph at 14 % grade for 10 METs. By the way, average backpacking speed is about 2.2 mph. Most hikers average 1 mph uphill.
After the holidays I started adding pack weight to my treadmill sessions. Simply adding five pounds of pack weight will stress your body. Be ready to reduce speed and/or elevation. I've found I can tolerate the higher elevations by slowly adding 1% grade every two minutes. The photo above shows me with 13.6 pounds (10 pounds of rice) walking 2.2 mph at 10% grade (5.7 METs). 
One of the best $10 I've ever spent is for a small rechargeable pulse-oxygen meter. The staff helped me calculate my safe pulse range. Start by subtracting your age from 220. Being 64, that results in 156. Then calculate 80% of the first number. For myself, that is 128, my redline. My heart and arteries won't explode at that level, but they will work at their aerobic best if I keep my pulse below 128. Mentally, 125 is my yellow caution line. Most of my thirty minute treadmill sessions are spent between 115 and 125 beats per minute (bpm). While backpacking I pause every twenty minutes for water, so the ability to tolerate thirty minutes of intense activity bodes well. Blood Mountain and the climb out of the NOC may take a while, but I should be able to safely get up and over, now I have a device that can give me feedback while trudging uphill. 
So, my advice for fellow seniors is to find a treadmill, a treadmill chart and a pulse-oxygen meter. Start slowly, but increase your grade and walking time until you can tolerate 30 minutes at 7 METs or better. Start adding weight, but reduce your starting speed and grade when you do.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Tue",0
