Colonel Sanders,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632579,"I have had a dream, ever since I knew what it was, to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. Like most people with the same dream, I was unable to get 6+ months off of work to follow through. Now that I'm newly retired, I have decided to make good on realizing that dream and start training for a thru-hike in 2022. I have high hopes that the trails will be open for business once again by next spring with the Covid-19 vaccine rolling out faster every day. Being a bit of a planner, I started today with gear inventory and a thru-hike checklist to determine what I have, and what I need. I also got the latest AT Thru-Hiker's Companion and started entering all that data into Excel to start planning the trip. So, I can get a bit bogged down in the planning and not getting around to execution, therefore I also put on my shoes and went for a long walk. The first of many that will hopefully result in lost weight and improved fitness level that won't have me leaving the trail prematurely.I'm going to go Northbound. I really wanted to go Southbound because I worried that I would have anxiety looking at the calendar every day hoping I make it to Mt. Katahdin in time by going northbound. South would free up the calendar for a less restrictive schedule and, hopefully, a more relaxed hike. However, I'm not exactly a spring chicken and I haven't been hiking in a long time, so the idea of summiting Katahdin, then 15 miles later doing the 100 Mile Wilderness, and all the other tough NE trails, right from the start would probably had me feeling like I bit off more than I could chew, and would take longer to get my trail legs than I might prefer. So, reason will win this day and I will head to Amicalola Falls State Park, GA in spring of 2022 to begin my adventure.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Sun",0
Colonel Sanders,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632596,"Well, I'm pretty happy to report that I walked two days in a row for an hour at about 3-4 mph. That may seem like peanuts to some, but for this old guy who has become comfortably fluffy in retirement, It's a good start. I also took our overweight dog with me so we can get our whole family in shape. Made some good choices in eating as well, so cross fingers that I see the fruits of my labor soon.The best part about planning such an adventure over a year out is that one can struggle with their decisions and weigh pros and cons over time. No rush. If information changes, so too can our plans. For example, I keep flip-flopping on going SOBO or NOBO. For reasons I gave last time about being out of shape, I decided NOBO. But should I get into better fitness through hiking some of KY's beautiful trails and eating better, I may reassess a SOBO option. That would appease my anxiety over finishing in time. And for the record, I am aware of the many ways one can finish a thru-hike when running short on time. The one I would likely take is travel to Katahdin and hike south to meet up with the point at which I got off. Thereby still hiking the whole trail as a thru. But do I need to tell you what that would do to my OCD? LOL! I have this inner need to get on the trail at point ""A"" and not get off until point ""B"" no matter what. I even have heartache over zero days in towns (even though I accept that they will probably be inevitable, and that's OK).All this to say, so far so good on the preparations for my greatest adventure to date.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Mon",0
Colonel Sanders,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632602,"So, I'll be honest, this journal in the pre-hike stages is more for my own mental health and a way of keeping myself accountable by journalling. I have a habit of coming up with grand ideas (like an AT thru-hike!) and spending every waking hour researching and filling out spreadsheets and planning that I neglect the actual preparation phase, then burn out or doubt my ability to follow through. So I'm journalling my activities so I ensure that that's not I'll type out in a day. That said, if you choose to not read the ramblings of an old guy trying to get his shit together, I don't blame you. Probably won't be a whole lot of terribly interesting material in these pages until I this summer when I can go on longer prep hikes and backpacking trips.This said, I managed to tie up my shoes, grab the dog's leash, and go on another hour-long/3.5 mile walk today. If I can do that without too much joint pain, or blisters, I'll up it to 2 hours. I'll probably cap my future walks at 5 or 6 hours because I don't think I'd walk much more than that anyway on the trail. Of course as my walks get longer, I'll add the weight of a pack. In the end though, no matter how hilly my town is, nothing beats putting your feet in the dirt of the woods. I can't wait until the weather improves and I can train in the beautiful hills of KY. They're the AT foothills, so it's an appropriate transition stage.Well, another successful day of exercise and diet in the books. See you tomorrow.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Tue",0
Colonel Sanders,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632616,"Today we are in the path of an ice storm in KY. But guess what? I went out training today anyways! I figured when I make a plan to hike, I better go rain or shine because on a thru you don't get to sit in camp until a pretty day. Icy rain and cold wind didn't bother me. I had the AT on the brain. I bundled up my pup and put her boots on and she even came with me. I have been thinking a lot about the WHY of the thru hike. So I think I will update that portion of my bio here to get my head clear on my goals.So, on the topic of weather, I think I will take the same approach in the spring/summer when I go on trial hikes and gear shakedowns. Rain or shine, when I make a plan to go backpacking, I'm going. I don't want to test all my gear in sunny warm weather then find out it isn't sufficient.Hoping we don't lose power tonight! I'll check in tomorrow.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Wed",0
