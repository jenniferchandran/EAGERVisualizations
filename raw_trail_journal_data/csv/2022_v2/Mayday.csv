Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586125,"Well, this is my official one year notice that I am hiking next April. I started telling a few people yesterday and it is so good to say it out loud. I will be boring my friends, I’m sure, with my ongoing conversations about prepping for this adventure. So excited to dig in!","

Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586350,"Not sure how to prepare physically for this trip but since I’m totally out of shape and overweight I suppose any activity will be good. So, I’ve been walking the trails here on weekends for a while and now I think I need to walk farther, more often and start carrying a backpack sometimes. It feels good walking here. No blisters so far with my Keene shoes (yet). Time to step it all up a bit.","

Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586438,"Well,  it’s time to start looking at the big ticket items for the trip. I’ve pretty much decided that comparing things on the web is pointless and I need to actually go to a store and see them in person. The only thing I have bought so far is my backpack and a pair of shoes. My husband surprised me with another good pair that have a lot of air flow and will be useful in wet areas. I’m a little worried about how much money this will all cost and I have to say I’m hoping to get the gear purchases right the first time to save money on the expensive stuff. I’ll be looking for the sales, of course. And,OK, here’s an odd thing that I have been thinking about- my hair. Should I grow it out so I can pull it back while on the trail or cut it short just before I leave so I don’t have to deal with?  Seems like a dumb subject, but I’m still thinking...","

Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587173,"I know you have to walk in all weather but my state park here has had the trails closed due to the inclement weather and massive rains for weeks. Hopefully the winter will end sometime soon- it's almost May! In the meantime, I have decided to go with my oldest daughter (who will hopefully hike some days with me) in July and buy my tent, sleeping bag and pad. that will let me make some trips using those and practicing set-up before winter returns (if it ever leaves).","

Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607107,"I have decided to delay my hike by a year. I’m trying to pay off my debts before I leave and I got a chance to “double-dip”for a few months more.  I want to just go now but I must be practical with the money. So, I will be on that trail the middle of March 2020.","

Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626736,"Two weeks from tomorrow I’ll hit the trail!  My daughter, Carissa, is going to do the first 4 days with me...hopefully we get to Neel Gap. I know my whole family will feel better if she reports back that I know how to set up my tent, etc., because some suspect I am incompetent ( but I think I am hiding it really well). Just joking, some people are worried about my safety, of course. I am one of those...I’m not namedo Mayday for no reason.I have packed up my bag and weighed it in at 31 lbs. I am still changing items in and out...I didn’t realize how heavy the Anker battery pack was.I have to mention one item I love! It’s a neck knife! It is small and lightweight and hangs on a neck cord. SO COOl! I found it online from a place called MT Knives after watching an Instructional AT video by a past thru hiker trail-named Dixie (one of many videos she has done). She is my favorite source for AT information, so funny, too. Till next time ~Mayday",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Sun",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626871,"Hi,It’s only 9 days till my first step! I’m really excited and in the right mind to do this. I checked the weather for the next few weeks in Georgia and it’s lots of rain, for sure. Oh well, why not? I won’t melt. Sounds like the whole world is staying put due to the Corona virus but with all the fresh air out on the trail I guess we’ll be fine. BTW, Anyone else having a hard time finding hand sanitizer? Later...Mayday",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Thu",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627054,"Hello Friends,Yes, I am still going to start hiking on Sunday.  I have spent time thinking about pros and cons and my responsibility to myself and others in this medical crisis. I have decided to go now. As you can see in the picture my rooms are full of piles. I’ve made a few boxes if I need food shipped in. Now I’m concerned about a whole other set of problems. Will I find hostels and food sources still open?Will someone pick me up when hitchhiking or will hikers now scare people? Will I find tent sites so I don’t need to stay in a shelter?Deep breath...it will all work out. Or it won’t. I’m will cherish the experience whatever it will be.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Tue",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627185,"Hi hikers and others,I’m here to say I have decided to delay my hike...again! I delayed a year ago to save more money and again today to get through this Corona stuff. Please, please may I get on trail next year? I will be  67  years old next May and I’m worried I’m missing my window of strength and good health. I know that sounds selfish but I really want to experience this. In the meantime, good health to all of you, safe hiking for those already on the trail and good luck.",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Fri",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627578,Well isn’t this a weird time? Hiking seems pretty low on my priority list after spending two years planning my AT hike.  I know it’s just a matter of months and life will speed back up so I’m actually enjoying this down time.  Trying to stay somewhat in shape is my main concern but I’m not very motivated.  I’m planning to try again in March 2021.  I’m concerned about the overcrowding on trail next year after this years overflow of hikers are added to next years. I was  3 days from being on trail before the AT first said please don’t start if you haven’t already. Now I don’t feel like I am part of the Class of 2020. Vey weird time warp we are living in.,,View Entry,"Apr 11, Sat",0

Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628660,"Hi!Just updating since the trail has re-opened and many have jumped on trail. I am still at home doing some practice hiking/camping trips. I decided I would wait until next spring to attempt the full hiking experience. I am going to hike down into the Grand Canyon next month which should be super hot but fun. So, I will be part of next year’s bubble and happy for it!Till then...walk on!  ~Mayday 2021",,View Entry,"Jun 20, Sat",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632189,"Hi, I’m happy to report that I will be making my third attempt to thru-hike the AT. I chose March 23rd ( for the 3rd time). Starting in Georgia and heading (very slowly) North. See you out there.~Mayday",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Tue",0
Mayday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646799,"Gonna try again the second week of April. Not in as good shape as the previous 3 attempts, but I know the trail will provide that, among other things. Hahaha",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Wed",0
