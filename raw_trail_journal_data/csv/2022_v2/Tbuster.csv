I just clicked on Trail Journals and saw the class of 2022 already has a journal page. The several who have already uploaded introductions and comments look like a nice bunch. Guess I might as well join them.
As the saying goes, “Half the fun of going is getting there.”
My journey has already begun, at least between my ears, even if it is two years distant.
Grandpa, Dad’s dad, once told me, “Tbuster, (his nickname for me after the Howdy Doody character) life is a merry go round that spins faster and faster. If you don’t take the opportunity to jump off and follow your dream, you may never get the chance.” 
This hope of hiking the AT has been with me for over fifty years, since I was in junior high school and heard a fellow talk about his hike from Georgia to Maine. I remembered Grandpa’s advice about following dreams and the thought of strapping a pack on my back and walking thousands of miles appealed to me so much that I told my parents I was going to either hike the Appalachian Trail or homestead in Alaska upon high school graduation. 
Obviously, Grandpa hadn’t shared his wise words with either.
Both told me to get an education first.
Life has a way of overtaking a person.  I graduated from the university, married, got a teaching job, had four sons, acquired a dog, two cars, a few cats, and worked umpteen odd jobs to keep the bills paid. All thoughts of hiking the AT quickly faded in the name of economic survival.
We eventually settled in northern Maine where I continued my teaching career. Over the years, our family hiked Katahdin and other Maine mountains.Years later, with the sons mostly grown and looking at the termination of a thirty year marriage, I was offered a professorship by the University of Alaska to work with Inupiaq Eskimos who wanted to be teachers in their own villages north of the arctic circle. I built my own cabin on the Noatak River, seventeen miles from my closest neighbor, and traveled between ten and fifteen thousand miles a year on snowmobile and/or bush plane from village to village in the name of  teacher education. During that time, I was able to hike much of the Brooks Range and in later years, the mountains around Southeast Alaska. 
I retired in 2012. My wife and I live in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan on 42 acres of trees, lakes, streams, and beauty, and fondly refer to it as “Alaska Light.” 
I’ve kept busy hiking the Picture Rocks Trail along Lake Superior, the River to River Trail across southern Illinois, and some of the northern sections of the AT. Eight years ago, for my 60th birthday, my four grown sons and I trekked up and down Mt. Washington in a single day. I wanted to prove that I still had what it takes. I’ve also made a winter summit on Washington, complete with crampons, ice axe, and all the perefenalia that goes with a cold weather climb during some of the White Mountain’s harshest conditions.
So that brings me to now, two years and twenty seven days before my kickoff date of February 27th, 2022. Why the 27th? I don’t know. It very well could be the 26th or the 28th. Either are before the big hiking bubble begins, yet late enough that I hope to miss some snow and cold weather. From northern Maine and Alaska, I’m not terribly fearful of wintry weather. 
People ask why 2022? Why wait? The bones are getting brittle, the joints sometimes painful and I find my balance isn’t what it once was. All that being said, the boy who once dreamed of hiking the AT is still inside me. He’s much older and no spring chicken, but he’s alive and well, just a bit more “seasoned”. 
I read somewhere that only fifty people, age 70 or older, have successfully completed a through hike on the AT. I’d like to be number 51.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Sat",0

Sometimes I feel like a silly dreamer for writing about my planned hiking journey over two years in advance. On the other hand, if one’s been thinking about the hike for over half a century, two years is hardly anytime at all. 
I’m walking daily, as much to keep a hiker frame of mind and to keep my fitness level somewhere between the lines. I do worry that at my age, I’ll wear out my knees or some other body part between now and the time I want to begin. There has to be a common sense approach to being fit. I’m still trying to find it.
I had a torn meniscus repaired six years ago. The surgeon reminded me at the time that I was no spring chicken and most of all, to quit running. Walking was okay, but running, something I was doing to gain an elevated heartbeat, was out.
My good buddy belongs to a local gym and attends exercise classes three nights a week. He approached me the other day saying the gym owner was offering a free one month trial membership. I’ll begin that in April upon arrival home from a late winter sojourn south.
My goal is to strengthen my core which is gawd awful weak. I have outstanding WALKING legs, but hiking? Who knows? There’s a big big difference.
I used to be strong, really strong. Once upon a time, I could climb a rope hand over hand without using my legs. No jar lid was too tight, few weights too heavy to lift.
That was then. Now is now.
When shoveling heavy snow, I have to stop every so often to catch my breath. Recovery time is fast, but still, equating that to steep uphill climbs means that it could take me four years and a month to complete the AT, hardly a through hiker’s dream. 
 
With the metabolism that of a dead rock, I’ve become overweight by twenty pounds. I’m hoping to keep my pack base weight to around fifteen pounds, so in reality, I still weigh five pounds more than my hoped-for total hiking weight. I don’t consider myself fat, but I have acquired a comfortable grandpa look, complete with the beginnings of a burgeoning belly. After all, my wife and I have ten grandchildren, isn’t that how I’m supposed to look?
I’ve read time and time again that the hike will eliminate any extra pounds, but I really want to enjoy the trek from beginning to end, not huff and puff while carting an unnecessary spare tire up and down every mountainside. That aside, carrying an extra twenty pounds can’t be good for the knees or hips. 
At this early date, I’m going to keep it realistic and not worry about losing weight until after this coming trip south. Being with good friends and vacationing, I’m going to enjoy some good old fashioned southern fried catfish, hush puppies, boiled peanuts, sweet tater pie, and all that goes along with southern fare. It’ll be a different story when we arrive home. The quest to shed at least twenty pounds will begin with the exercise classes in early April. I know the trainer is a tough cookie who likes to push his clients. I want to be pushed. I want it to hurt. Since my high school football days, I’ve always equated hurting while working out with getting in shape.
It’s time to go for a seven mile walk. I’ll plug in the ear buds and listen to Steve Adam’s Mighty Blue podcast. With the thermometer reading a big fat zero, I’ll bundle up and trudge along, pretending that I’m in the Smoky Mountains in early March, battling snow and cold. 
After all, half the fun of going is getting there. I’m there in spirit. Now all that needs to be done is getting my body to follow.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Thu",0

I’ve been thinking a lot about my mental stamina and the trail lately. Other than a break, sprain, muscle tear, and other injury, I’m not really worried about my body staying together for over 2,000 miles. I do worry about my mental stamina.
I’m a married man who worries about leaving his bride for several months to go trekking some 2,000 plus miles. We’re soul mates and partners, but most of all, we’re best friends. I delight in sharing my daily thoughts with her and enjoy listening to what’s on her mind. We’re fishing buddies, driving companions, and simply put, we enjoy each other’s company.
What we aren’t is backpacking/hiking buddies.
How, I ask, will I fare, trudging day in and day out, without with my beloved wife and best friend at my side? 
The obvious answer is for her to accompany me. Unfortunately my bride has absolutely zero interest in accompanying me on a five to six month hike. I think one of the reasons we’re so close is that we’re exact opposites. Her idea of camping is a room at a Holiday Inn Express. She’s deathly afraid of snakes, lions and tigers and bears, oh my. If something goes boom in the night, she assumes it’s evil and is full of germs? Had I known before our marriage what I know today, I’d have bought stock in a hand sanitizer firm and become a millionaire. 
Me? I’ve had more bear experiences than I care to talk about, been charged by bull moose, was happy to have had a pet snake during my high school years, and besides, how do we know if germs really exist when you can’t see them with the naked eye? 
My wife reluctantly supports my fifty year dream although she’s not nearly as enthusiastic as I am. 
Am I being selfish and unrealistic or am I merely continuing to follow Grandpa’s advice?",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Sat",0

This is supposed to be a seven mile walking day, but since the temperature is eight above zero accompanied by a twenty-five mph northerly wind, I’m delaying this morning’s walk. It’s much more comfortable sitting by the wood stove with a cup of coffee close at hand. I feel guilty for not going. Shouldn’t being miserable while walking now be good practice for things to come? Yes it is. Time to take a hike.
Later in the day
I didn’t make it seven miles. I ran into new neighbors a mile down the road and had a Saturday morning roadside conversation that lasted almost an hour. I still managed to put three miles under my feet.
I’m thinking of technology today. Instagram, Twitter, Snap Chat, Face Book, Youtube, all are social media venues where I can read about the adventures of other hikers plus post my own. Problem is, I know very little about any of them. Seems the kids can effortlessly navigate from one social post to the other with no problem, but most are beyond me. 
It’s pretty obvious that I’m going to have to bite the bullet and have a youngster give me a few lessons.
I penned a newspaper column for over twenty years and have been blogging for even longer. I’d like to try my hand at creating either a video blog or even a podcast, but again, I have no idea where to begin. 
Speaking of technology, I’ve heard through-hikers say no one needs a GPS on the trail, that it is well marked, and why carry a few extra ounces when it’s not necessary? On the other hand, I listened to an experienced Triple Crowner the other day say he always carries a Garmin Mini. Having served in multiple search and rescue operations, plus having more extreme arctic travel than most, I’ve found it’s always better to error on the side of caution. I’ll carry a some kind of tracking GPS PLUS a good, old fashioned, simple compass.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Sat",0

It’s been a few days. I was walking my usual seven mile route earlier today when it occurred to me that my planned departure from Springer Mountain is scheduled for two years from today. As I walked along, I tried to picture how my emotions will be, how it will feel to finally sign the register, walk through the arches, and set foot on the trail.
My buddy, Scottie, who lives in the Atlanta area, is a member of my support team and will  transport me to Amicalola Falls. I’ve visualized the drive from the Atlanta area north, signing the register, weighing my pack, and attempting to shed any last minute jitters.
I wonder what my “big three” will look like? I own the Dan Durston Drop single walled tent, am leaning towards purchasing the Z Pack Arc Haul Zip backpack along with some kind of 10 degree quilt. Of course, this early in the planning, all three can and probably will change as shakedown hikes occur.
I listen to various hiking podcasts as I walk, mostly those from the Trek as well as Mighty Blue’s program. I find both extremely informational as well as entertaining. I pick up some useful information from The Trek’s correspondents and I like Mighty Blue’s more mature take on the trail. He’s hiked it twice while in his sixties.
Today, I’ve been reading about powdered green, a vegetable supplement. According to the literature, not does it supply additional nutrition found in green vegetables, it also serves as an energy boost. At my age, I’ll try most anything that will give me some extra vim and vigor.
I’ve also been reading on light weight power banks to recharge whatever electronic gear I may take along. I know I’ll need one. Just exactly what make and model is still up in the air.
So, it’s two years from today, February 27, 2020. It seems like such a long time, yet I look back over the past two years and it’s flown by in blur. Something tells me the next two will go just as fast.",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Thu",0
Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627547,"As an armchair AT thru hiker who is waiting in the dugout for the next two years to pass before stepping foot on the AT, it's difficult to sit back and watch the hopes and dreams of this year's hiking class diminish with each passing day. I eat, sleep, and live, hiking through reading, podcasts, and of course, corresponding with others who have the same interest. I can't imagine the disappointment this year's hikers must be experiencing.I feel badly for those who have left the trail, just as bad for the few who are continuing on. I hate reading all the negativity that is floating around the hiker community from those who are pro or con about leaving the trail. It's sad. Just sad.It seems to be the new world in which we hike.This past winter's feet and feet of snow in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is quickly disappearing and I'm anxious to try out my new tent, the Drop/Dan Durston 1 person, model. The price was right and the reviews are decent, so I figured why not? We'll see. With two years to go before my hike begins, time is on my side for testing equipment and finding what's right for me. I'm still walking/hiking daily, alternating three and seven mile routes. I was going to join the local gym this spring and begin core strengthening, but with the current shelter-at-home law, that's out of the question. I've thought of training to some online videos, but honestly, I need a person standing in front of me, shouting encouragement, and telling me I'm a poo poo and to try harder. So with that, I think I'll close for now. The people from this year's class whom I was following on the trail have left and those few who remain seem to be playing a convoluted game of cat and mouse. It's definitely a different hike, physically and/or mentally, that each of us is trodding these days. For now, all we can do is pray for the health and safety of all and that the COVID - 19 virus runs its course and goes away.Meanwhile, I have seven solitary miles to hike this morning. Time to get walking.As I mentioned previously, it's a new world in which we hike.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Mon",0
Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630369,"It's been several months since I made an entry. The summer has so busy that I've not had the time to sit and reflect in written form on 2022's planned kick off from Springer Mountain. That doesn't mean the six-month trek is ever far from my mind. Each morning has seen me take one of my favorite hiking routes that range anywhere from three to nine miles while listening to Mighty Blue's latest podcast or any of the others on the Hikers Radio Network. I enjoy them all, but identify most with Steve as we are the same age and experienced somewhat similar paths in life.
There are two or three rather steep and long hills on my routes and it's not uncommon for me to reach the top of one only to turn around, go back down, and walk back up again. 
It's that cardio thing you know.
I'm happy to report that I've lost twenty pounds over the past six months. Yeah, I know that I'm to carry ample caloric stores once I begin the hike, but these sixty-eight year old knees of mine don't need any extra stress. They seem to be in good shape and I'd like for them to stay that way. 
That being said, I feel good. Darn good. 
If it weren't for this Covid thing and the fact that I want to celebrate my 70th birthday on the trail, I'd have departed from Springer Mountain this last spring. Other than my high school athletic days (where I was a legend in my own mind,) I don't think I've ever been in better shape. 

My wife seems to be warming up to the reality, no, accepting, that if everything remains status quo, I'll be leaving for six months in the future. We've had many discussions resulting in her quietly saying that she doesn't want me to go and that I'd better come back to her in one piece. I've told many stories of my arctic Alaska adventures, hiking and kayaking in the Brooks and Alaska ranges, and of other wild sojourns in my former life from which I safely returned. None seem to put her at complete ease. 
She supports me because she loves me. She doesn't understand my need for one more lifetime adventure and why anyone who's quickly approaching seventy years of age would have an insatiable desire, an urge, no a compulsion, to test himself in his golden years.  My bride is convinced that any grandparent of thirteen grandchildren should be perfectly content to stay home, grow a garden, and take afternoon naps. I like all of that, but still, an important component is missing.
It's called living.
I've been making a conscious effort this summer to teach her some of the things I do on a daily basis, mostly maintenance chores such as checking the oil in the riding mower, putting fuel in the car, etc. These are activities that are second nature to me, but can be somewhat daunting to her. Still, she's a trooper and not afraid to tackle any challenge... well, other than accompanying me on the trail. She has no interest in a six month journey testing both physical and mental skills.
I know it's not for everyone. In fact, few choose such a challenge. I understand that most long distance hikers and adventurers have a screw loose and mine seems to wobble more than most. My friends and family questioned my sanity during my Alaska years.
A few people have asked if I intend to hike with anyone. 
Heck, yeah, but with no one in particular. I'm starting solo. There's little doubt I'll meet people who hike my pace and are socially compatible. I don't care if they're young, middle aged, or in their senior years. I simply hope to hook up with those that can encourage me when I get down and will accept my support should they find themselves in a slump. Between those times, I want to laugh, talk, eat, and get to know my fellow hikers. As an ""old guy,"" I'm happy to serve as Grandpa in a tramily if they'll have me.
Other news from this summer:
I gave my X Mid 1P Dan Durston tent a good foul weather test. It performed wonderfully during four days of record setting torrential rain accompanied by high winds and other than a bit of water blowing in through the push out vent, it remained high and dry. Not closing the one vent was my fault. I'd simply forgotten it was open. I think I've discovered the art of erecting and dismantling the tent during wet weather while keeping the inside dry. I learned that by first grabbing the two peaks where the trekking pole insert and folding them together with the inside covered insures everything will remain dry. 
I like that. I like that a lot.
Unless something else comes along, at this stage of the planning, it appears the X Mid 1 P will serve as my shelter. The next big test will be this late fall and early winter when it will go through cold weather trials.
Use a quilt? Make a quilt? Stick with a sleeping bag? I have no idea which it will be, but time is on my side. Stay tuned on that one.
So that's the update from this armchair AT through hiker in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Fall and winter are quickly approaching and it won't be long before I'll be writing, ""Hard to believe I'll be leaving a year from today.""
Until then, all I can do is keep walking and exercising and dream, correspond with other hikers, listen to hiking podcasts, watch youtube videos, and continue writing. 
Honestly, I feel like a second string substitute watching a big game, but someday, you wait and see, I'll be stepping away from the bench saying, 
""Put me in coach. I'm ready to play!""",,View Entry,"Sep 03, Thu",0
Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630977,"One of the things that concerns me is how do I haul my daily prescribed medications while on a thru hike? I take a simple pill daily for high blood pressure, another for cholesterol. Other than Ibuprofen or some other pain reliever, I'd rather not take or carry any pills while hiking.
My high blood pressure is inherited. In fact, I come from a long line of high BP'er's. Grandma had it, Dad was the same. Unfortunately, he passed it along to me along with his love of adventure and the outdoors.
The fix? I'll talk to my health care provider several months before leaving and TRY to get her permission to cut out the meds during my hike. In both cases, the numbers for both were getting ""iffy"" and the meds were prescribed as a preventative measure. 
One of my biggest concerns is my eyesight. Having been diagnosed with an advanced case of dry macular degeneration over ten years ago, I was pronounced legally blind five years ago. In desperation, I sought an alternative way to cope with the life changing disease, something more than a sympathetic click of my opthamologist's tongue and a prescription for taking two ARED vitamins a day.

Through the grace of God, I met a scientific researcher who had done research on macular degeneration using near infrared light therapy. She recommended an opthamologist who had also done the same and between the two, I found myself receiving near infrared therapy, something the FDA has yet to approve.
The outcome? It is working, at least so far. One eye has digressed somewhat, but I can read, drive without any restrictions, and best of all, I can hike unencumbered. 
So, here's my dilemma. The near infrared therapy requires treatments three times a week. The entire procedure entails holding a small electronic device up to each eye for three minutes. It's not terribly heavy, exactly 1 lb, 2 oz, and though it seems somewhat rugged, I'm going to have to devise a water proof case, probably one of Tupperware with padding.
I think of having to lug the device and I wonder what's next, Depends for lack of bladder control? How about Geritol for iron poor blood? Thankfully, I'm not anticipating those problems, at least yet. 
Then there are the usual aches and pains we all experience once we've crossed into Seniordom. 
Is that a real word? I think not, but in my real life, I was an educator for forty years, so I'll pronounce it official. 
Hmmm... SENIORDOM. Works for me. 
I get up in the morning and the bottom of my feet feel and sound as though they morphed into hundred year old blocks of plaster while I slumbered. It becomes apparent that Snap, Crackle, and Pop, the Rice Krispie triplets, moved in during the dark of night. I listen to a symphony of noises accompanied by little flexibility as I hobble from the bathroom to the coffee pot then to my easy chair. Ten to fifteen minutes of painful shuffling results in near normal function of both feet and I can get on with life.
I've had multiple (and painful) cortisone shots in each foot. The podiatrist tells me my feet have been ""ridden hard and put away wet."" I simply refer to them as hiker's feet. Anyone who has strapped on a backpack for any amount of miles has them.  
Often during the day, I suffer from the occasional cramp on either side of my upper back. The only relief is to stop what I'm doing and go through a two minute regimen of touching my toes... or at least try to. I haven't actually been able to keep my legs straight and touch my toes in years, but I'm fairly certain all ten are down there. 
I broke my back during my arctic Alaska days. That's when I lay in a bunk helpless for three days before regaining enough strength to start my snowmobile and motor myself seventeen miles to the nearest village. After treatment, the doctor warned me that I should take several months away from work, to be still, and most of all, NOT ride a snowmobile, something that was required for my work. He warned that failure to heed his advice could and would probably result in multiple negative effects as I aged.
Nodding in agreement, I evidently had my fingers crossed behind my back as I was back to work soon after, ignoring the grinding sounds in my lower back and traveling up to five hundred miles a week through the arctic in the name of education. 
So that's my story of my pre hike ailments. I'm not complaining, nor am I bragging, and have no more or no less than anyone else in their golden years. Still, this is a hiking journal and I know some will be amplified on the trail along with a parade of new ones that will accumulate along the way.
So what am I saying? Nothing really, it's part of the planning, the adventure, the thrill of being an active hiker who's enjoying Seniordom.

Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631509,"A (strictly) amateur photographer, I'm familiar with the Law of Thirds. Without going into any great detail, the concept deals with splitting a potential photograph or piece of artwork into three parts that makes it most pleasing to the eye.
That aside, I recently heard a guest on one of Mighty Blue's podcasts refer to his thru hike as being in three parts, a hiking Law of Thirds if you will.
The first third was physical
The second, middle section, was mental
The third section, spiritual
That made a lot of sense to me and helped me focus on my eventual journey on the AT.
I'm an active guy and enjoy a physical challenge. Though I walk several miles daily, I know that at age 70, until I posses a pair of trail legs, the up's and down's of Georgia and North Carolina will be a burning/gasping challenge. Still, there's a little bitty pseudo masochistic part of me that likes to occasionally hurt in a good way. It means I'm doing something, that I'm alive and living life. To not be active in some fashion means I'm going backwards... and that's not an option.
Though I may be somewhat miserable during the first third, I'm looking forward to it. 
Ah, the second third, the part I'm least looking forward to. I know I'll be homesick. I love our home, our forty-two acres of woods, water, and garden in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but more than that, I'm truly in love with my wife. She's my soul mate, my other half. We think many of the same thoughts, finish each other's sentences, sing, dance, and laugh together, and even when we disagree, we're eager to end any dispute so we can get on with the business of enjoying life. 
Long days, longer miles, sore muscles, and inclement weather, will be a challenge, but those are just physical. It's my mental state during those long miles of the second part that I worry about. Oh, there's no doubt in my mind that I'll tough it through. I've lived through worse, both mentally and physically, but still, it remains a concern. 
I'm already laying the groundwork for my wife to come to the East Coast for the occasional weekend rendezvous. With the help of family and friends, we'll make it happen. Being mentally prepared, beforehand, will, no doubt, help me make it through the second part.
Spiritual. 
I'm eagerly anticipating the last third of my journey. There are multiple reasons why I'm hiking the trail, but what I really want is to peel off seventy years of layers. Some are good, others not so good, but still, they are layers, each a tiny wall that I tend to spiritually hide behind. I'm tired of hiding. I just want to be me, inside and out.
I'm looking forward to some long and insightful conversations with God along the way.Though I've never encountered a burning bush, I know He's there. It's my sincere wish to clear my head and soul and summit Katahdin a better man and husband, one without seventy years of layers to hide behind.
So, the Law of Thirds, usually applied to the visual arts. 
You know, it may be perfect for the thru hiker.

Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632197,"Here it is a new year and suddenly, leaving Springer in one year and a month doesn't seem quite so far away. There's little doubt that time will fly by and February of 2022 will be here in no time. I've spent most of this winter either walking, working in my wood shop, or ice fishing. 
A buddy and I were walking the other day when a truck pulled up. The driver rolled down his window saying he and his wife read my daily blog (pentogatales.blogspot.com) and in the same breath, mentioned that his wife was a hiker.
From then on, the conversation became all about trails, equipment, time schedules, etc. etc. I didn't initially notice that my friend's eyes and those of the hiker's husband glazed over. When I did, I gave my new hiking friend a questioning look. She shrugged and smiled as if saying he was used to it.
The above brings me to the real subject of today's blathering. Does anyone else notice that the prospect of hiking the AT seems to sneak into every conversation?
Electric bill increased last month? You should see the new headlamp I just got to take on the AT. It'll run for thirty six hours straight on AAA batteries, no electricity needed.
Heart Surgery? She should have hiked the AT beginning years ago, watched less Ellen and eaten fewer potato chips.
Pimples? Hike the AT and your body will burn the calories so quickly that they won't have time to contribute to the pimple making process. Burns sugar and chocolate in a flash.
Car broke down? Who needs one? Walk to the grocery store. It will get you in shape for hiking the AT.
While most of my friends, many retired, talk of migrating to warmer climes during the Upper Peninsula's cold winter months, I'm gabbing on and on about the 10 degree quilt I recently purchased.
Like my hiker friend's husband, their eyes glaze over as well.
In retirement, I have a rather extensive wood working shop complete with a floor full of heavy power equipment. I love my shop, especially the lathe. Turning bowls and other goodies has become a wintertime passion.
My wife jokingly asked the other day how I was going to fit my three hundred pound lathe into my backpack and take it with on the AT. Thankfully, she didn't suggest I load it into the pack and go swimming... yet. If I don't shut up about the trail, she may.
My new hiker friend, the mother of teenagers, and I have become hiking pen pals. She's planning on solo hiking in Glacier National Park this summer as well as our own Porcupine Mountain Trail here in the Upper Peninsula. I'd love to invite myself to go with, but we're old fashioned. it's that girl/boy thing.
At least I have a hiking penpal, someone whose eyes won't glaze over when talking about pack weight, trails, or hiking gear.
So as of now, everything is still on track for leaving Springer a year from this February.
Until then, all I can do is keep walking daily and pray my wife doesn't get that look that suggests I hop into a lake with a three hundred pound back pack.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Thu",0

Hard to believe, but after fifty years of waiting, planning, learning, listening, and hiking around Alaska, the Northeast, and the Midwest, I'll be ready.
Yep, a year seems like a long time, but when a person's put his plans on hold for half a century, a year is but a blip on the big screen of life.
Things have been shaking and moving these past six weeks. Gary, aka Pokealong, and I have made contact through Trailjournals and we're talking about starting the trail together. Pokealong will turn 75 years old while on the trail. I'll turn 70 in June of 2022.

Pokealong told me the other day that his daughter had a few concerns regarding her father undertaking a 2,200 mile thru hike. He told her he'd met this guy who was about the same age who was leaving at the same time. That seemed to put her somewhat at ease. I've relayed the same message to my wife and like Pokealong's daughter, it seemed to make her feel much better.
Ah, Pokealong. It's nice to have have someone to communicate and plan with. How long we'll actually hike together remains to be seen, hopefully, the entire trail, but it's the hike your own hike thing. As I'm fond of saying, half the fun of going is getting there. Talking with Pokealong has made this pre hike most exciting and enjoyable.
I've run into a bit of a hiking snag, but have decided I'll put the solution in the hands of God, whether its in the form of trail angels, fate, ophthalmologists, or careful planning.
The dry macular degeneration that has called my eyes home for the past twelve years has progressed to the wet phase in one eye. In other words, fluid is leaking from the back of the eye and if not treated, can cause permanent blindness. The right eye was diagnosed as “wet” last month while at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine where I received the first... gulp... shot directly in my eye. These injections will continue on a monthly basis for the rest of my life.
Just think of having a root canal without Novocaine coupled with running your fingernails up a blackboard... oh, and throw in a good case of hemorrhoids at the same time.
Yeah, kind of makes the back of your lap pucker right up, eh?
So, what's that have to do with a 2022 thru hike of the AT? Simply put, I'm going to have to find ophthalmologists and transportation along the way to receive the monthly injections.
I ain't worried, no sir. My research scientist/MD/ophthalmologist at UW Med says she'll work with me to help find doctors and set up appointments as I trek along. As she said, “One way or the other, we'll make it work.”
What a sweetheart, eh?
As it's said, the trail provides. This will put it to the supreme test.
In other pre trail news, I'm making an introduction to what, I hope, will be a youtube channel of pre trail and on the trail happenings. Having worked in the communication's sector in my previous life, I'm no stranger to speaking in front of a camera, but it's this digital thing that I have trouble with. In the old days, we used film and thought we had gone big time when SVHS and BETA were developed.
Thankfully, my sister in law is a whiz at such things and has promised to tutor me in the ways of iMovie, GoPro, and the like. Pokealong is also interested in shooting video, so who knows, by the time we're finished, we may have a sequel to Bill and Ted's Great Adventure.
I continue to work on pack weight and it appears that my winter base weight shouldn't exceed twenty pounds, hopefully a pound or two less. I'm continually adding and subtracting ounces. The key word is SUBTRACT. I'm not worried. I'll have it all figured out after this coming summer's test hikes.
The weather in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has been brutal these past few weeks and daily highs of well below zero are common. One nighttime low reached -37 and numbers in the negative 20's have been the rule rather than the exception. I've missed only one day of walking, simply because I was feeling lazy and decided to take a break.
A year from now... dang, this thing's really going to happen, isn't it. <-said as a statement, NOT a question.
Until next time, good luck to this year's 2021 thru hikers. Be safe, have fun , and please keep writing and posting online. Give or take a year, Pokealong and I will be right behind you.",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Fri",0
Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634980,"It's been awhile since I've written, but that doesn't mean hiking or the trail have been far from my mind. I continue to gather small odds and ends, many of which will not make the final cut, but this spring, coming summer, next fall, and early winter, are dedicated to test driving equipment and trying various methods.
I finally had the chance to use my Hammock Gear 10 degree quilt on a chilly night and absolutely loved it. I wasn't thrilled with the Klymit V sleeping pad and am questioning if the R4 value is true. I became chilly from underneath and am thinking of looking further for a higher rated/time tested sleeping pad. Probably the Thermarest with the R value of 6 plus that many seem to like.
Keeping pounds and ounces in mind and trying to maintain a base weight between fifteen and twenty pounds, I've added micro spikes to the list of things that must go, especially since I'm starting mid February. Mine weigh a pound, but I'm prepared to add to them my pack for the first few weeks, certainly until after the Smokies and a ways beyond.
I'm currently walking several miles daily, but carry a full pack three to four times a week while playing with the compression straps, shifting the contents, and so on. There are times that I've been hiking for well over an hour and forget the pack is on my back. That's when I know I'm close to having the perfect fit.
My wife remains very supportive and dedicated to my hike. She's often suggested we watch hiking videos together and for a non hiker, has taken a remarkable interest in my upcoming trek. Currently, we're following Betty White (Worth Heading North), Nahamsha, Meandering Meagan, and the Blazin' Bakers, on youtube as they make their way northward on the AT. All have taught me something, even if it's what not to do.
I've been practicing making and editing videos. Though I taught broadcasting and mass communications years ago, technology has dramatically changed and I'm slowly learning how to navigate in the digital world. Right now, I plan to bring my GoPro 8 fastened to my chest strap and an iPhone mini 12. I have no idea how often I'll upload a video, or if I even will, but practicing and learning the software beforehand certainly enhances my chances of recording and sharing my hike.
I find myself looking at the calendar and thinking, ""A year from today I ought to be around ...."" 
I like that. I like that a lot.
So, with that in mind, I just wanted to check in, read other's entries, and catch up on what's happening in the world of hiking the AT.

Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638642,"Everything seems to be progressing as the days churn by towards February's kick off from Springer Mountain. The pack has been tested, base weight checked with items being subtracted, added, or simply eliminated. Videos have been watched with particular interest while following Betty White on Youtube. Over twenty years my junior, the boy talks honestly, simply, and is simply fun to watch.
The current question regarding 2022's hike is, do I want to publish a daily journal, do a youtube channel, both, or possibly neither. I write a daily blog, so penning my thoughts is nothing new, but by the time a few pictures are added, it could be a chore. I can picture publishing a video several times a week, uploading  it when possible.
I've been practicing making videos. All are scattered about on my daily blathering. I enjoy the challenge of using the camera and editing. 
Next? Possibly starting a youtube channel dedicated to my hiking adventures, the next which will be the second week of June while section hiking a part of the Superior Trail in Minnesota. Elevation won't be challenging, but it should be a great opportunity to further test my equipment.
It's a short one today. Just remember, half the fun of going is getting there.

Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640272,"It's unseasonably hot and humid in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan these days and I remain convinced that a mid February kickoff on the AT is a wise move.
I don't fear the wintry conditions that I'm certain to encounter. As a true northerner, having lived in northern Maine, arctic Alaska, and now, northern Michigan, I believe I can handle whatever winter blows my way.
But heat? Now that could be my Achilles tendon if I have such a thing.
I don't do heat well, never have. Following some of 2021's hikers who started late, a few are talking about the warm temperatures from Virginia to New England and I've heard several comments about water sources, or in some cases, the lack of them.
I think I'll put my money on an early starting date and see where the cards fall. So far, it's still mid February.
I completed a three day, fifty-seven mile, shakedown section hike of the Superior Hiking Trail a couple of weeks ago. Pack weight, including four days of food and one liter of water, was twenty three pounds.
The terrain wasn't overly difficult, although there were plenty of PUDs to keep the blood flowing. The worst sections were those where the trail wound through the clear cuts, places where loggers had stripped the forest to bare ground several years ago.
We encountered thick stands of ten foot tall aspens, immature trees that were tall enough to block any breeze, yet short enough to allow a hot sun to shine directly on us, making our trek not so enjoyable.
Due to a lack of snowfall in northern Minnesota this past winter and a very dry spring, water sources were few and far between. With the trail winding several miles from the shores of Lake Superior, we were forced to draw water from some unsavory ponds and streams. At one point, desperate and knowing the next closest water source was several miles away, I used my CNOC to dip water from a murky beaver pond. While attempting to filter it through a Sawyer Squeeze, I noticed several tadpoles swimming inside the 2 liter bag. Additional chlorine pills were used to purify the water and even then, had I not been thirsty and fearing dehydration, I'd have waited for the next water source. As it was, the next source was worse than the pond from where I'd drawn water, so I was happy for the warm, awful tasting, coffee colored liquid. Well, sort of.
I was delighted with my tent, a Dan Durston Mid XP 1. One night saw severe thunderstorms marching our direction and with only minutes to spare, I staked the four corners and literally, threw my hiking poles into place to erect the tent. Total setup time was well under two minutes. My hiking partner was still piecing the frame of his tent together when the first raindrop fell.
One other thing about the tent... we experienced high winds during the storms and even with only the four corners staked, the tent remained rigid throughout. I didn't have the time to use any guys nor were any additional stakes needed.
Also, I remained high and dry throughout the driving rains as did my pack that was stored under one of the vestibules.
I was also well pleased with my Hammock Gear 20 degree down quilt. I certainly didn't need anything that heavy, but with nighttime temperatures dipping into the low forties, I pulled it up each night and slept like a baby.
I wasn't so thrilled with my Granite Gear Crown 60 pack. I like the pack, love the lack of weight, but I'm not certain it loves me. For whatever reason, I couldn't get the bag to settle on my hips resulting in my shoulders bearing most the weight. I adjusted, readjusted, played with the compression straps and load lifters, packed and repacked, but try as I may, I couldn't get comfortable.
My wife and I will be making a trip to our closest REI in Appleton, Wisconsin, three and a half hours south, in the near future where I'll consult with a certified packologist. I'm going to take my Granite Gear Crown pack and hopefully, he can tell me what I'm doing wrong or what may or may not be wrong with the pack. No doubt, like any good used car salesman, the packologist will try to make a sale. All I can say is he'd better be ready for me to wear the loaded pack around the store for a while and weigh as little as possible.
I was also reminded that food weighs a lot. With a non hiking partner, I packed too much “just in case.” Had I been hiking solo, my pack weight would have been well under twenty pounds.
It was a good shakedown hike, the first of several I plan to make this summer, fall, and early next winter. Overall, I'm fairly well pleased. I've got the pack problem to solve and a few more pounds of pack weight to shed. My goal is for it to weigh no more than 20 lbs, fully loaded, when I kick off from Springer.
No doubt there'll be more changes, but as the days, weeks, and months, roll by, it's starting to become real and I like that. I like that a lot.
Until next time, just remember, half the fun of going is getting there!

Tbuster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642455,"It's August 16th, less than six months to go until the planned mid February kick off date. It's still up in the air, February 15th or 16th, 2022, makes no difference.
I write a daily blog and it seems that it was just a few short months ago when I wrote at the time that only two years remained until my 70th birthday and the arrival of my long planned attempt to thru hike of the AT. Suddenly, it's less than six months. Not crunch time yet, but getting close.
I feel as though I've been at the far end of the bench in the dug out for the past several years, on deck this past year, and with this season's thru hikers finishing from now into October, our class of 2022 will soon be up to bat.
Put me in coach, I'm ready.
Other than walking four miles daily this summer along with making a few practice hiking videos, I've not done any special preparation. I'd like to commit to having my own Youtube channel and making a series of regular videos while on the trail. I think I will, but I want to make sure doing so won't take away from my hike. Also, if I start a series of videos, I'll feel obligated to post regularly. Is that something I really want to do.
I think so.
While on a three day, sixty mile, shakedown hike earlier this summer, I recall being glad that I didn't have anything to do at day's end other than make camp, eat, and crawl into my tent. Shooting a few clips and editing them via iMovie seems to be simple enough. Getting it uploaded to youtube can be problematic.
Stay tuned, guess we'll see.
This summer has been filled with yearly maintenance household and yard chores. We burn mostly wood to heat our home. Since I plan to be gone for the majority of next summer, I've been cutting two year's worth. Something looks as though it could break? Then let's replace it now and we'll have a spare. There're just a lot of honey-do jobs to complete.
My wife, bless her heart, is fully onboard with my upcoming hike. An avid non hiker, she's taken the time to educate herself in all aspects of the trail and though I've hiked various northern sections of the AT (and she hasn't) probably knows as much or more than I do. Hostels? I bet she can name a dozen or more. Various shelters? Yep, she's right there. The Smokies, the Whites, Presidential's, Hundred Mile Wilderness? Uh huh. Trail towns? Piece of cake. She's reminded me more than once that I need to start slow and work up to the larger miles as I develop my trail legs. Despite the distance we'll be apart, some things won't change, I guarantee it!
We were visiting my sons and their families in New Hampshire last month and stopped at the REI store in North Conway. Originally from northern Maine and having summited Mt. Washington and Katahdin several times, (both winter and summer climbs) it was different. While wandering around the store, it suddenly occurred to me that upon my next visit to Conway's REI, it very well could be as a thru rather than a section hiker. There's a big difference you know.
In other news, I'm still toying with equipment. I love my Dan Dustron XP 1 Mid tent. That's a definite.
I'm still up in the air about a sleeping pad. February could be cold, darn cold, and after using the Klymit Static V earlier early last spring on a frigid night, I couldn't keep warm from below. Supposedly it has a high R value, but you couldn't have proven it by me. I'll try putting something reflective between it and the ground and see what good that does, otherwise, I'll be shopping for a better R rated sleeping pad.
I really liked my Hammock Gear 10 degree quilt on that cold night and it kept me very warm on top. Two thumbs up for Hammock Gear. 
I've decided to go with the regular Granite Gear 60L pack, rather than the long. Six feet tall, my torso was right on the line between the two, but I found the long was too long. Unable to ride on my hips on an earlier shakedown hike, it hung from my shoulders the entire way. The regular should be arriving in the next week or two.
With six months left, that's the news from this end. Despite skepticism by some, I'm still hoping to keep my pack weight in the 20 to 25 lb range. The trick is to not trade comfort for less weight, but I have to be realistic. Having seriously broken my back north of the arctic circle during my Alaska years, hauling a heavy pack could/would seriously place my trek in jeopardy. Somewhere there's a happy medium that will ensure the best chance of a pleasurable and successful trek.
