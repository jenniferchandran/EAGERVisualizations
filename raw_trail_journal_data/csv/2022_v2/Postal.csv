Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570850,"so this is it.
this is more than a sentence or a paragraph. this is a commitment. this is one more step toward Springer Mountain. when i post these, my friends and coworkers will see ...
so ... i guess, this is it.
i have spent the money on the stuff i would never, ever, ever use on my day hikes. I have spent the money on several pairs of shoes/boots, most of which i've ruled out and returned (Priase be to REI.) I have listened to AWOLs book like 25 times just to get a feel for the experience. I have spent the time on the planning. And i have spent the time on the anxiety over my hike. Crap, and i still have like 279 days and 12 hours. but who's counting, right?
so, as kenny loggins sings ... this is it.
Yeah rain, rocks, cold, body soaking heat, bears, snakes, bats, mice, ticks, black flies, mosquitos ... yippee for backpain, kneepain, chafing (BIIGG hurray for that!), shoulder pain, footpain, chafing (i feel that needs to be mentioned twice), oh and have i mentioned blisters and those toe nails randomly falling into my socks.
i really can't wait for alla that.",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Tue",0
Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571589,"I'm leaving on a jet plane .... i'll be dry running (dry hiking??) in the Rocky Mountains for a week. I leave in 36 hours. (image of a happy faced me). My pack is packed like it will be next April, same food, same sleeping bag, same Crocs. (my son is horrified that I will be wearing Crocs and people will see me in them.) I plan on eating what and how I will be eating on the Trail. I will be breaking down my tent every morning, carrying it on the moderate hikes (no im not carrying a 25 pound backpack up 13,000 foot summits ... im crazy, not a masochist ...), wearing the same clothes, filtering water from the abundant sources, sharing the trail with trees and rocks, bears, marmots, deer, elk and moose; oh, and not bathing ... yummy on that one.  I have a couple of summits (Fairchild and Storm) on the menu and a long 20 mile moderate altitude gaining/losing circuitous hike as a main course. Rumor has it that there are rocks in Colorado, too ... :)so see you at a Mile High.",,Rocky Mountain National Park,"Jul 10, Mon",0
Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571914,"Rocky Mountain High ...

RMNP is gorgeous. Spent the first full day here climbing Twin Sisters with my 16 year old son. He's been out here for 6 weeks already so he was already acclimated to the altitude and the thinner air. Me, not so much. He was nice enough to make it seem as though the 4 or 5 breaks up the trail were his need, not mine. FYI, northern Illinois doesn't quiiite have the same altitude as Colorado. 
Started at 9,073 feet and hiked up to 11,401 feet in a little over 3 hours with 70% pack weight. I had my tent, sleeping bag (you know in case I wanted to pitch a tent and nap on my day hike) extra clothes, filter (FYI, no water sources on Ye Olde Twins) ... basically about 18 pounds of stuff. But not enough water. But I did have my filter. (Yeah, preparation!)
Tomorrow is a longer, flatter hike.",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Thu",0
Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572899,"So 5 days, 5 hikes, (T-Mobile and the mountains don't work and play well with one another.)
Friday, July 14th (you know, the longer,  flatter, easier hike with a full pack.): Fern Lake trailhead to Fern Lake trailhead ... 15.8 miles. 
This morning started with a pack full of food, water,  and all my goodies, including a new filter I'll get into in a moment. It started innocently enough at 8,150ft. The pack, though heavy, was bearable and wearable and the first 4 miles passed ... ummm, what's the word?  Oh yeah, UP! up and more up for about 1,500ft but the payoff was an absolutely stunning view of Fern Lake (see pic above) with the mountains towering in the distance and reflected in the calm water's surface. Small cutthroat trout were swimming just off shore.  We stopped for a 15 minute protein-bar, filtered water (I'm getting to the filter, I am), and an apple slice break  .....
before heading on ... and up ... another 600ft and through a boulder field with the mountains looming all around to Odessa Lake. We stopped long enough for me to dangle my feet in the icy, snow-melt waters (long enough for me decide my feet were the only thing that was touching that cold water)....
 From 10,020 feet we moved on up (sensing a theme here?) another mile and another 560ft in elevation and traversing 2 long, icy, mid-July, mountain side snow fields to Lake Helene. (One of those snow fields we decided was too treacherous to cross where we were, so we descended 40 or so feet crossed over boulders, then had to climb back up.) Lake Helene is very shallow and so serene ... still with the mountains rising directly behind.
This was the last of the lakes we would ""shore-up"" to. We saw 2 others at a distance, but did not divert to them. And there still were 10 miles to hike. Day 1, Good Times!
So, this water filter ... MSR has a new-ish filter called the Trailshot Microfilter and lemme tell you the first impression is Super! (in Big G.. Al's voice). Check it out. It completely eliminates my paranoia of accidentally getting untreated water in my drinking water.",,View Entry,"Jul 14, Fri",0
Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572914,"So i woke to dawn riddled with clouds after days of bright blue. Grey skies in Colorado are ususally a portent of greyer, wetter skies and many times lightning and thunder. Under timerline that thunder and lightning isn't as much an issue--in fact it's usually kinda cool, but at 13,300 feet mountain top, it's far from treeline and far, far from cool.
I drove to Long's Peak trail head at 9,400 feet. still grey. it started to sprinkle, but i knew i had 3 hours under the trees before i broke out of the trees and their relative safety. Since this was a light daypack hike, i made good time ... 2 hours to the tundra, and about 10,700 feet. I've hiked this trail probably 6 or 7 times before to various locations, but this was the best time i've put in--also it's the first time i've used trekking poles. I don't think it's a coincidence.
I took a few pictures of the rocks i was dealing with to remember that i have dealt with monster rocks before and will be ready and careful when they come up on the trail next summer. This is, rocks not withstanding, the best part of this trail and the part that really makes it worth the effort if you ever go to RMNP. When Long's Peak and Meeker come into view, it's (for lack of a better cliche) magnificient.
I played tag with another hiker dayhiking from the trail head up, he and I chatted everytime we passed, but finally another 2+ hours up the trail, on the 'boulder field' leading up to Long's, we passed for the last time, he wished me luck, and I him, and we went our separate ways--i was happy i only had 1/2 a mile and 600 feet up, he had much further, and about 1,000 feet more UP. 
oh, and still grey. but there were specs of blue.
up through boulders and rock hopping to the summit of Storm Peak, but with many stops to catch my breath. even after 7 days in Colorado i still was getting used to the thinner air. the summits in RMNP are exhilerating. you can often see down from whence you came, you can see the other summits, you can see everywhere. On clear days, it seems like you can see 3 states in every direction. did i mention this was not a clear day.
From Storm i could see down to the Gorge i had circled around in just 2 days before. I could see the Lakes (Mills, Black, Blue) that i had journeyed to, and those (Frozen, Green) that i had passed on visiting.
But it was grey. Grey is not good when one is 2,500 feet, several hundred boulder jumps, and 3 hours from tree line. So i stayed long enough to snap some pictures and skeedaddled (spelled right??) back down.
The trip back, with a detour to Chasm Lake, was easy (as easy as a 4,000 foot descent down rock and root strewn path can be) and for the most part uneventful.
after this hike and after 53 miles of hard Rocky Mountain hiking, i realized a few things about the upcoming A.T. journey:
1. SOCKS ... the injinji 2.0 toe socks that purported to prevent bisters worked like a charm. my feet were not too terribly worse for the wear. And i have almost always suffered some kind of a blister (usually under my big toe) after a week of Colorado hiking.
2. SHOES ... the Solomon X Ultra Low GTX hiking shoes will probably be what i start with. the pull string laces didn't slip (though as my hiking progressed i did need to tighten them a little more once or twice early.)
3. POLES .... the Komperdell poles i took broke. they were the foldable kind, and the lacing within the pole snapped. i will be moving on to telescoping poles next.
4. PANTS/SHORTS ... the Kuhl Renegade convertable pants were comfy and had enough storage for my little stuff.
5. UNDIES ... Icebreaker's relaxed fit boxers are the best thing ever. I got them from the Icebreaker site, and they performed completely as advertised. No chaffing for me!
6. TENT ... with a little string replacement i will probably be sticking with my Big Agnes UL1 HV tent. the tent is light, but the tie down strings are way too fragile. (and besides it has that little lighting system inside that is so cool.)
7. FILTER ... i am still undecided. the MSR Trailshot was really convenient, but the KATADYN filter actually carried water, and it stowed down into a smaller, lighter package when not in use. I am very concerned about the reviews that report the KATADYN filter's water sack tearing at the seam after only a few uses. I didn't obviously experience that, but that would really SUCK if that happened on the trail.
8. CAMERA ... undecided. completely and utterly undecided. i have an Samsung S5 and an S6 ACTIVE, both of which are wonderful phones, are very water and impact resistant, and take ok pictures. I have a great Cannon camera, but it is not in any way water resistant, but it takes gorgeous pictures. And i have used the water resistant Fuji camera which takes good pictures, but its battery duration ... well it could use the battery equivalent of the little blue pill. So, still up in the air on this one. Cause it's about the pictures, doncha know?
9. HAT ... Sox hat. done deal ... or Seahawks ... damn, i thought this would be easier.",,View Entry,"Jul 18, Tue",0
Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576740,"So, i got back from Colorado on July 20th. it's now August 31st, and this is only my 5th day off work since my return ...... I get paid by the hour, that's my mantra ... i get paid by the hour.
So i took advantage of the day off and got out for the first post-Colorado hike-hike (there are hikes, and then there are hike-hikes, and then there are hike-hike-hike--you get the idea.) This was a 3.5 hour, 10 mile, full pack hike (-hike) through Starved Rock State Park. As flat and boring as most of Illinois is (and it really, really is), Starved Rock is a little hidden treasure nestled out in the middle of nowhere, Illinois. It has some PUDs, the Illinois River running next to it, and some really (struggling for the right word here ...) grand (??) canyons. It is Illinois' own Green Tunnel. This Park is my escape from the flat hiking nearer where i live. Winter or summer, i try to get out to this park when i can. And as green and peaceful as it is in the summer, the winter is equally wonderful. Fewer visitors make for more isolation, the waterfalls that have carved the canyons freeze creating huge ice falls, and then there are the eagles. The colder the winter, the more bald eagles flock to this park. (flock, really? ugh!)
okay, okay ... I'm done being a PSA for Starved Rock.
the hike, though not long reaffirmed my decisions on camera (my Samsung Active phone), backpack (Osprey Exos 58 ... NOT my camelbak, thank you very much, says my bruised shoulder blades), REI telescoping trekking poles, and clothing (underwear and socks). I'm now undecided on shoes/boots. The Solomon hiking shoes seemed too thin, and my feet felt bruised even though 2 pairs of socks.
If anyone has opinions on hiking shoes (such as Solomon ultra x) vs boots (such as Vasque Breeze LOW 2.0) vs trail shoes (such as Brooks Ghost GTX), i'd like to hear/read it.

Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580002,"So I got a few days off now because we're staffed better than we've been like ever. So instead of hiking, I grabbed the kayak and decided to come out to Lake Chaminwood and I've just been coasting on the water for the last 90 minutes. I've been listening to the woods, and wind, and water (and unfortunately the Highway which is very far away--but semis are damn loud) doing my best not to bug the fishermen ... and I suppose more not to bug the fish than the fisher-persons. 
I have all my equipment, I've booked my flight for my wife and me, I have my rental car. Now all I can do is just watch the timer click down on my phone and enjoy this, the last 60 degree day of 2017 I believe. Judging by the forecast the next 10 days are going to have highs in the 40s and low 50s so finally more, uhhh ... Octobery. 
This is also the first entry that I'm doing text to speech so far it seems to be going rather well. Granted I'm no Daisy, I'm going to have a few errs and uhs, but it seems to be going okay. All of my other entries I've spent 30 minutes over, crafting, trying to get just right. I don't imagine I'm going to be afforded that luxury in my tent, in the dark, with the rain popping outside and a dying battery in my phone.
On another note, my wife has been ... well I don't want to say nagging but, well, nagging me to start preparing and eating some of the food that I'll be eating next (deep, calming breath) April. I can honestly say that I've only had one serving of oatmeal in my life and as I recall it was really less than appetizing. I'm more of a hamburger for breakfast kind of person. But I have flavors of oatmeal at home that I'm going to try, dehydrated marinara sauce, packets of tuna and the one thing that I do like a lot ... perhaps too much and have since my college days ...  Knorr packets of Rice and Noodles. Those were a staple of my college diet back when they were called Lipton. And I presume they will be a staple of this diet (since I don't imagine I'm going to be able to find a Steak and Shake.)",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Thu",0

Tonya, my wife, me and Maggie (the cute little fur ball on the end of the lead) went for a 4 mile hike thru the mud and chill. The frozen waterfalls have thawed out a little, but they were still worth the hike. I was fully loaded (uhhhh, not like THAT) at about 26 pounds, Salomon hiking shoes, poles, 2 liters of water, and 3 full days of multi- servings meals. Felt good. I have everything, including the new 2018 AT Guide (thanks to AWOL for taking his time to keep publishing this Guide), and am literally counting the days. I was sad, though, because i walked thru REI a few days ago and i didn't need anything. But it was uplifting, too, to walk thru REI, I was excited because of it ... I'm ready, I'm really ready.

Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583094,"last night I unpacked and spread everything out, yet again. the only thing missing from the photo is my down jacket ... I really have no idea what to expect from April in Georgia, so I don't know if I will need it, but I'm budgeting space and weight allowance for it anyhow. I added a contractor bag to my pack this time i packed. It's kinda a pain in the butt, but i guess one more layer to keep things dry is worth a little butt pain.Right now the only luxury item im taking with me is my sweatproof pair of earbuds. i'm debating taking my KINDLE. But it isn't waterproof, and it adds weight, but i think it would be a nice but unobtrusive bit of civilization on those nights when i can't fall immediately to sleep. ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS would be appreciated: Kindle yea, or nay?So i packed it all up again, and went out in the Illinois rain this morning. this was the first time i used the Frog Toggs. One thing i found out was that however great the poncho is, the water does indeed go somewhere. in this case it ran right off the waterproof poncho (yeahhh!), and onto my not so waterproof pants (boooo!). But the rain started, stopped, started again ... so i got to take the poncho off, stowed, then unstowed and put back on while i was still walking. no real issues with that, other than the freezing water on my knees and shins. Here's hopin' in Georgia's version of April, there won't many 34 degree rainy days.Oh, and once again, the Salomon GTX X ultras were the best. Socks were just a little bit damp by my ankles and a little sweaty on my toes. with all the ice puddles and snow i walked through i consider that a win.It's 9:24 on Monday, Presidents' Day, February 19th. I get on a plane in 48 days, 9 hours and 20 some minutes ... not that i'm counting.",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Mon",0
Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585693,"I haven't been spending my days off like it seems many other upcoming thru hikers have been. I haven't been hiking, gradually increasing mileage, weight and weather (you know, pain and rain). I've been giving my feet little one-day vacations on those off days in preparation (and pre-apology) for the atrocities to which they will be subjected to very, very soon. Of course i have set my tent up about a dozen times, unpacked and packed my backpack, i have planned out my few mail drops, and i have laid out my hiking plan for those first 60 days. But i haven't exercised. And I'm really okay with that.
And in 7 days I'll be hiking through Georgia.While I'm away, my 18th wedding anniversary will come and go and my older son's 17th birthday will pass. And then there's my family ... Apart from a few months 11 years ago I haven't been apart from my wife and kids (... interlude--a Train song quietly playing in the background) for more than a day, even if it's just blearily pausing in the mornings or at night. My wife and I are best friends. We enjoy each other's company, we still hold hands, and we laugh at the same stuff, things that other people would call ... well, let's go with odd. And I'll be without my 2 boys, teenagers, who very often try my patience, but who I will miss daily and carry with me every step of the way.But in 7 days I'll be hiking in Georgia.
So, on Saturday April 7th, i will work my last shift at the Post Office for at least 2 months -- where most all of my friends are. On Sunday April 8th, i will take my younger son to a Chicago White Sox home game at Guaranteed Rate Field (yep, that's what their home park is called ... yikes). Then early Monday morning my wife and i will head to Midway International to catch a flight to Atlanta. By early afternoon Monday, my wife and i will be wandering around Amicalola Lodge grounds. Then early Tuesday morning we will drive to the Gap where I'll (maybe we'll) climb up to Springer. Then we'll return to the Gap and part ways for at least 2 very long months. And that is going to be really hard ... really, really hard.
And then I'm off ... and I am so #$*#$&ing ready to go!!

Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586021,"So a little bit about what i am about to undertake.
The Appalachian Trail (henceforth, the AT) is 2,190 miles (or so) long, passes through 14 states, eight different national forests, and six national parks. (taken from the appalachiantrail.org website ...) The trail is marked for hikers using a white, vertical stripe of paint (paint stripes are called 'white blazes') on trees, posts and/or rocks intermittendly throughout the length of the AT. There are other colors of blazes meaning different things, but that isn't important right now.
The AT is one of three trails that make up the Triple Crown of hiking. The other 2 are the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT, and is about 2,659 miles long along the West Coast) and the Continental Divide Trail (or CDT, which is roughly 3,100 miles from Mexico to Canada and runs the length of the Rocky Mountains). So we've established that the other 2 trails are longer ... but the total elevation gain and loss ... (the distance trudged up and down and up and down and up--getting the picture?) The PCT (2,659 miles) elevation gain and loss is roughly 315,000 ft. (that's 315,000 feet up and down and up and ... sorry ... where was I?) The CDT (the 3,100 miles through the United States Rocky Mountains) has an elevation gain/loss of 400,000 feet. (yipes! right?) Our beloved AT (a measely 2,194 miles) has an elevation gain/loss of 515,000 feet. (source ... outdoors.org ... other websites cite 465,000 feet ... still ...) that's at least 89 miles of up and down distance ... or like 16 times up Mount Everest ...
You carry what you need on your back. Sleeping back, tent, a limited first aid, hygeine (consisting of toothpaste and brush and T.P.), cooking stove (simply a small burner that screws onto a fuel cannister), water filter (for the stream/spring water you'll need), food (3-5 days worth of the just-add-water kind ... and of course my peanut butter ... some protein bars or GORP to snack on while walking), and 2 sets of clothes (1 day set--layers, which will get wet, dirty, stinky, gross, muddy--and 1 sleeping set--that needs to be kept dry.)
And when you get tired, you find a shelter (3 walls and a roof in most cases). in this shelter, you and 5-30 of your closest stinky, dirty, unwashed friends roll out your sleeping bags, curl your stinky self up (in some cases like sardines in a can), and try to sleep through other people's night ... rituals (snoring ... and other noises.) If the shelter is full or you just get tired in between shelters, you can set up your tent (most places, there are a few tenting restrictions here and there throughout the trai) and sleep all by your lonesome.
So the hike itself involves walking all day, then finding a place to camp (either a shelter--spaced 6-20 miles apart--or camping with the tent.) For dinner you most often boil water and add it to something liteweight and/or dehydrated. (lipton rice, ramen, oatmeal or commercial dehydrated meals from Mountain House are my meals of choice.) Then you clean up your dish and plastic spork, hang or otherwise stow your food in order to keep it from mice and bears, sleep, get up, fix yourself breakfast and then move on to do it all over again. Towns and other re-supply options are spaced fairly evenly throughout the trail so that at my pace i should hit a re-supply point every 4-5 days. And if that 4-5 days brings me to a town or a hostel (a hiker inn ... typically bunks in a garage or maybe someone's home) I will get to shower and/or wash my clothes.
I won't be killing and skinning squirrels or making snakeskin belts ... and i really won't be alone that often when just starting out. in fact, i don't imagine i will go more than a few miles at a time without passing/being passed by another hiker (or more likely hikers).
So this is what i'm setting myself up for ... and I really, really appreciate the good wishes and good will today ...

After all was said and done (and packed and re packed) the pack came out to about 28 pounds. ( ...and I need all of it!

It was maybe 30 degrees.  Still I had no appetite but I choked down a protein bar and water and took off at 840am. The trail had heavy ups and then downs to gaps early on. The worst climb was up to Sassafras Mountain. On the way up, I passed 2016 thru hiker Greeter going the other way who was just out for a few days, and upon seeing me winded, told me with a smile, ""You know what they say, doncha, Sassafras'll kick your ass."" ... and yup it did. (He also reminded me, in a non-verbal manner, that hikers don't shake hands in greeting .... cause frankly you never know where they've been: they fist bump.)The hiking leveled out at that and we made good time to Gooch Gap Shelter-- getting there before 1pm. We (me and thru hiker Helen ... no trail name yet) had a quick, insufficient for me (as it turned out-- still no appetite) lunch and decided to move on to Lance Creek Restoration Area, 8.1 miles further.That hike, while long was uneventful. I did meet thru hiker Tadpole. She's hiking with her daughter, Peanut and her recently adopted dog, Niko.Uneventful, with one wonderful exception. I caught up to Helen at Woody Gap and stumbled onto my first trail magic!! (Trail magic is a hiker term for any form of serendipity on the trail, most often hot food or cold sodas, quite often from previous thru hikers) Hot dogs, orange slices, apples, chips and soda from a couple from Indiana who come down here once a year for a week. She thru'd in (if I remember right) 2013. So so SO needed and timely. I still hadn't really eaten much and it was totally catching up to me. This enabled me to power thru to Lance Creek Campground.

I missed my turn ...and wound up hiking the wrong way-- back the way I'd come-- for over 2 miles. I hadn't intended to stop at Neel Gap, but spending 2 1/2 hours just to get back to my starting point made that decision for me. ...so at 1025am I started for Neel Gap. After lots and lots of up I came across thru hiker Steve. I introduced myself and he recognized me from trailjournals, then said his trail name is Pirate Pete--i knew of him too. We compared aches and pains-- my knees, his ankles, and he said he didn't think he could make it up Blood Mountain with his ankles. I told him I was thinking of short-cutting, too, because of my knees. We both knew where the side trail was, so when i left him we both were going on that side trail. When i got to the sign, I stood there for a few, then decided 800 feet up wasn't so hard. ...so up I went. No side trail por mois!At the top I met thru hiker Metric who is hiking to McAfee Knob, finishing his thru home with this section hike. (Turns out he is from Hilliard, Ohio--only a few miles from where I lived when I lived in Ohio--and he worked a few blocks from where I worked in Ohio, and is going to work at the hospital at which I was born 50 some odd years ago. I didn't think I'd have a small world moment at all, much less 3 days into my hike.) Just as I was packing up to move on from Blood Mountain, Pirate Pete arrives with thru hiker Night Shift. He thought I might have tried the mountain, so he came up, too! He said he did the same thing, stood at the side trail and thought about it for a minute then thought this is why he came to the trail. When he made it to the top, he proudly introduced himself to two arriving hikers as Pirate Pete. I rushed down (as much as I could with 2 sorta gimpy knees) ...and arrived at Neel Gap at 20 till 5. Only a 8.1 mile day ... plus that 4.2 miles of backtracked trail. But I'm here, I got a bunk, a whole Red Baron pizza and a pseudo mountain dew (mello yello). I shared the pizza with Metric, Helen, and Metric's hiking buddy (who was also from central Ohio ... I know, small world.) But I'm here, now I lay me down to sleep.","Lance Creek Campground

Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586968,"Day 4Waking at Neel Gap bunkhouse, I didn't sleep very well again ... another ongoing trend ... and the night before I didn't take the time to resupply, or mail back the handful of items that I vetoed mid-hike. As mentioned in the previous entry,  I ate pizza then watched movies in the hostel with hikers Paul, Dupont, and a few others the night before. (I asked the room where they were when Independence Day was released in 1997. Paul said working, Dupont said second grade, and the two thru'rs next to me said at the same time,  ""i wasn't born yet."" UGHHH!) So when I woke at 6 Friday morning, and was packed by 7am, I didn't want to wait till 830 when the hostel store opened to resupply, so off I went. (2 days later I met up with hikers Short Shit and Hummingbird Ellie, and they pointed out that somehow I missed the famous shoe tree ... where hikers who call it a hike at Neel Gap cast their boots to the tree limbs. It's quite famous, and really, really difficult to miss. )The very beginning of the hike was amazing. Within a mile from the Gap, I passed a group of men, 1 with a guitar, harmonizing hymns as the dawn broke. I paused to listen for a moment. It was really nice. (Although Metric told me a little later that he had camped with them and they had started wandering around at 530am with head lamps and hatcheting smaller wood ... so he figured it was time to get moving.)A bit later I came up to, and hiked with Happy Feet and Paul. My knee was acting up again, and Happy Feet had a hamstring, so we all hobbled along till Low Gap Shelter. They both decided to call it a day the Shelter. Before I left them, intent on getting to Blue Mountain Shelter (and back with Metric and Helen), Happy Feet offered to wrap my knee. It was AMAZZZING. Just a little discomfort, but zero pain. The rest of the hike to Blue Mountain Shelter (another 7.3 miles) was, well, not easy, but uneventful. The forecast however, was not good for the following day, Saturday, and just before I arrived at the Shelter, I called Enota Lodge and secured a bunk for the following evening. When i got to the Shelter, however, it was full, but there were plenty of tenting options. I must say, though, my tenting site standards have taken a grave hit already ... I no longer look for a flat parcel of land, just one that's sort-a flat with no roots. That site discovered, and tent erected in minimal time, I ate half a serving of rice (totaling almost one package of rice for the entire day--sooooo not enough food) then hung my bear bag. I also discovered I had 2 blisters on my right foot. I'm a thru hiker now! I've hiked the wrong way and I have blisters! (side note, I tried to get an action shot of the pus squirting from the blisters when I lanced them but missed the ""money shot"") I popped and treated the blisters, then hobbled over and checked in with Metric and Helen and went to bed, trying again to sleep more than 4 hours. But happy, nonetheless.","Neel Gap

I woke sorta early to a fogged in campsite. It was eerie, but serene. I packed up and moved on, hobbling again, because the wrap from my knee had gone AWOL during the night. (It only made it as far as a wadded up blob at the end of my sleeping bag.) So the 1040 foot decent to Unicoi Gap (only after AH-scending 120 feet to the fogged-in summit of Blue Mountain) was slow, plodding, and maybe not painful, but certainly uncomfortable.
I was to meet a shuttle dispatched from Enota Lodge at 9am, and got there with time to spare. Wonderful thing because even that early in the am, there was a huge Trail Magic set up for hikers at Unicoi! I mean huge. The Magicians (???) had big ole hot dogs, breakfast burritos, chips, Little Debbie's, soda, Gatorade, water, fruit ... everything a hiker could need. They even offered to make sandwiches for the hikers to take for a later lunch. There I ran into the (somewhat smallish, I'll admit) gang. Metric was there with Peter, and Helen came sauntering in a little bit after I. This was fortuitous, because right when I finished as much as i could eat of my breakfast (and 2--or maybe 5--servings of Mountain Dew ... oooo, how I missed you!), the shuttle from Enota Lodge showed up. After a couple fist bumps, I jumped in the truck and sped off. 
Before I get to the lodge ...
I was able to get my laundry started ($5), and a helpful member of the Enota team told me she'd transfer my wash to the dryer (so cool!) Then I caught a ride from Linda, a so-friendly volunteer at Enota, to Hiawassee where I was able to purchase my knee brace and do some grocery shopping for items that I prayed (!!) would sound and taste better than the meals I had thought I would enjoy on the trail. (I was genuinely, gravely concerned about my appetite at this point.) Enota is peaceful and lovely. There really isn't any other word for it. It's huge, but they don't have a lot of experience with thru hikers yet, but they're learning. The staff is great (the owner, Doc, is a little ... intense) and I was fortunate enough to roll in on a weekend when there was a retreat ongoing. I say fortunate because the cook, Rachel (geez, I hope that's right!) in addition to being a complete stitch, is an excellent cook! Since there was a group retreat there, they had a buffet style meal for dinner, and I threw in my $$ to jump in. All I could eat BBQ wings, broccoli with cheese, mac n cheese, apple crisp, homemade mashed potatoes (Rachel said she spent an hour plopped on the floor, peeling potatoes), salad, lemonade ... it was delicious, and I was a little relieved by my resurrected appetite. I unequivocally recommend Enota, especially if you can catch them hosting a group retreat simply for the food!
I then wandered the nicely kept grounds for a while, listening to the variety of streams, looking to the high waterfalls, before retiring to my standard issue bunk room. It wasn't luxurious but it had a toilet, a sink and a bed ... what else does one need, really?
Footnote: I did take note, of course, that the crappy weather that was supposed to have arrived on Saturday had been backed up till Sunday ... (well, swell!!)
But for now, I laid down and tried to sleep.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587001,"Day 6, SundayI woke early again. Again getting less than 5 hours of sleep. But my Post Office clock had gone off and I was awake. I laid in bed (bunk), listening to the rainfall and knowing that it was supposed to continue raining all day, and not insignificantly, getting colder as the day passed. Knowing also that every other thru hiker knew this as well. Even if I pushed to get a little over 5 miles from where I left the trail, there was no guarantee that the next shelter (Tray Mountain Shelter) wouldn't be full and I'd be stuck setting up a tent and tenting in the rain and falling temps. Right then, at 630am, the temp was a comfortable 60. By midnight it was supposed to be in the high 30s ... and still drizzling. Decision made. At 8ish I walked to the Lodge and paid for another night. My first zero day (no hiking) ... waayyy earlier than I had thought it might be necessary. The retreat was still going on, but I passed on the morning buffet ... I'd already spent too much money. It looked good though ... Real scrambled eggs, biscuits, potatoes with onions, sausage and at the end (like it is at every buffet), bacon. Plus orange juice, fruit and tea. I spent time in my bunk before making my way back to the lodge ... another fortuitous turn, as I met thru hiker Hummingbird Ellie, section hiker Short Shit, and Short Shit's support person, Rick ... her brother. I had been reading Ellie's trailjournals entries for months, so I was thrilled to meet her in person. Then there was Short Shit. I don't think that wasn't her original trail name, but she had that kinda sense of humor that once someone mentioned it to her, she loved it and it stuck. Short Shit is from the Chicago suburbs as am I, and her brother, Rick, is from Maine. We sat in the Lodge chatting about the standard stuff hikers chat about upon first meeting. Origins, family, jobs, sports, etc. before being told the Lodge was closing early. It was Sunday, the retreat group had gone, so the staff wanted to go home for the day. We were told the TV room would remain open (with it's comfy couches), so we moved to the TV room a little further down the grounds. Of course it was raining, so the Dish Network didn't work, but that was actually a good thing. We talked for hours about things silly (movies and TV), serious (guns, lifestyles, parents, children) and most importantly about the Lodge and it's ... intense and somewhat intimidating owner. We talked peacefully about, in some cases,  touchy subjects, sometimes with differing opinions, politely and pleasantly. (Why can't Congress do that?!?)Rick had a ton of food in his truck to support his sister's hike, and I threw in wayyyyy overpriced chips and salsa from the Lodge, and we had a grand ole time for lunch/brunch. Later, Rick and I went to Hiawassee (I bumped into Paul and Happy Feet in town and I thanked her for the outstanding tape job on my knee--sadly she is still suffering from her strained hamstring). Rick and I got Subway for dinner, and got to observe the entertaining process by which Short Shit had to consume her massively over-stuffed sub. By the time dinner was over it was (as previously mentioned) still raining and getting colder (at least the weather channel got THAT right.) We agreed that they would move into the bunkroom for the night, since their equipment was soaked but the rain (they had been tenting). So just like that, I went from not knowing these 3 interesting, wonderful people in the morning, to sharing a 12 bunk bunkroom with them ... and keeping them awake with my snoring (devilish laugh!)
Footnote: Short Shit will be getting off the trail Wednesday, her section done. Hummingbird Ellie will be continuing on. I hope she (and we all) find companions on this hike as outgoing and friendly as Rick and his sister. Footnote: I'm really bummed out I didn't get a pic of Short Shit, Rick and Ellie","Enota Mountain Lodge

And after goodbyes to Hummingbird Ellie and Short Shit, Rick, good to his word, drove me back to Unicoi Gap. He absolutely didn't have to. Enota Lodge did offer to shuttle me, but they couldn't give me a concrete time. On the way up we saw snow up higher in the mountains. We made it to Unicoi, and we parted ways.My trek for the day was indeed snowy, but for the most part it had already fallen. The snowfall sunrise view from Rocky Mountain was magnificent. The pics will not do it justice. I was alone for the first 4 hours on the hike, and only when I decided to detour for lunch to Tray Mountain Shelter did I meet anyone else. There were two hikers left over from the previous (snowy, freezing) night. I made myself lunch, which consisted of hot Lipton noodle soup and 2 burritos with pepperoni ... and I ate it all ... finally. (More on that later.) They made themselves hot chocolate, I gave one who accepted one of my yummy pepperoni burritos, and packed up and moved on. The rest of the day I passed 2 hikers and millions of snowflakes (okay, maybe thousands) as the snow kicked up again.  After pausing here and there for amazing snow and frost pics, and after 16.7 miles of hiking I made it to Dick's Creek Gap. There I met thru hiker Quebec and her shetland whose name I cannot begin to pronounce, cause it's in French, but the dog was gorgeous and so well-behaved. She was staying at the Top of Georgia Hostel, which is where I wanted to stay. Of course we had to walk there ... and after going almost 17 miles I didn't wanna walk another .5 miles beside a highway ... but I didn't have a choice. When I got to the hostel it was around 430 and they were completely filled up. (Unhappy faced me!) They were very, very nice there, though. They offered me hot chocolate, and gave me a list of hotels in Hiawassee, and offered to shuttle me there for $10 (it's a 12 mile hitch, soooooo, ""yes please!""). Given the weather, all the ""cheap"" hotels were full, as well.  Holiday Inn Express was my last option and they had vacancy ... and a pool, and a hot tub, and free expansive continental breakfast .... and frankly, I wasn't really disappointed with the jacuzzi tub ... so I ordered a pizza, salad and a 2 liter of Mountain Dew (yeahhhhhhh!) Then I proceeded to sit in the jacuzzi tub, eat pizza and drink Dew and think of the beginning and middle of my cold, blustery day, take another bite of pizza, and was happy with the end of that same day. The Dew was the only thing I finished before bed. 
After today, my thoughts went to the artist Seal, and his lyrics ""So we're never gonna survive unless we get a little bit crazy ... "" Crazy like hiking 16.7 miles in near freezing temps through scattered snow and freezing rain ... and loving it.

I was careful not to make mess the night before so as to not give us thru hikers a bad name. I checked out, had 2 pints of milk, half a bagel from the continental breakfast (still suffering appetite side effects from the 3 ibuprofin I took the day before, before i had connected the ibuprofin dots), gathered my things and left the jacuzzi tub ... uhh, I mean the Inn.First stop was the Post Office to mail things back to Joliet, things I didn't wanna carry any longer. (Hiawassee has 9 (or 7 ... crap!) rural routes and no city routes ... and it looks like they're still driving their own vehicles) Second stop was to Ingalls grocery for a couple of things to tide me over for a few more days. On my way out I turned to deliberate on a bench in front of the store, which was already occupied by a person who had some kind of physical impairment. Shorter arms and legs, but very nice. He said he was raising money for something, and I gave him the ones I had. While I was getting ready to call a $30 taxi shuttle back to Dick's Creek Gap, he asked where I was heading. Right after I answered, I heard a woman (who happened to be walking into Ingalls) repeat, ""You want to go to Dick's Creek? I'll take you there for $10."" So ... someone who just happened to be within earshot--after I had taken a few seconds to dig out my money to give a stranger a few bucks--when I answered a stranger's question whom I most likely never would have sat next to under other circumstances was a shuttle driver who was going to the Gap anyhow. So for $10, I didn't have to wait and I didn't have to call a taxi, and give them $30.The woman was a retired Tampa Deputy, who had moved to Hiawassee and had just started shuttling. She was going to the Holiday Inn Express to pick up hikers. At the Inn I again met Squatch and Squeak (the 2 hikers who weren't born when Independence Day was released--see previous entry), and met Force Flex and Curley Turtle (who I'd been reading on trailjournals). The hike itself was once again breathtaking, mountains, trees, forest sunshine, green tunnel ... everything that the AT is. But two things of note did occurFirst, I MADE IT TO NORTH CAROLINA! (And I have photo evidence!) 1 state behind me, 13 more ahead. Second, I camped shortly after the border, like .1 mile after the border at Bly Ridge. I met there a hiker by the name of Crossroads. He's a great, Santa looking, friendly bear of a man who had come to understand the true meaning of hike your own hike. He had fallen several days before, trying to push to make miles, and had to take multiple days off. Since then, he hikes till he's done or till he finds a spot he likes (3 miles, in some cases) and then he stops. He helped me tie my bear bag knot, cause I'll be damned if I could remember how. (Funny how practicing 15 minutes on my couch while watching Archer didn't quite stick.) I might have just given up on the hitch knot and tied a never-gonna-get-this-thing-untied knot, but he showed me how to tie it correctly. So I camped, and the wind ... the wind that rolled and roiled over the ridge we (and about 12 other hikers) camped on had to be gusting at 35 mph. It sounded like a freight train. My REI Quarter Dome tent shook and shimmied a bit, but it held up to the night long onslaught. You know how i know that? I know that cause I was awake most of the night. But I'm still heading north. Next goal, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.","Hotel

 The wind finally died down over Bly Gap shortly after dawn, but that wasn't quite early enough for me to get any real sleep. C'est la vie. 
I cooked a warm meal of freeze-dried scrambled eggs & bacon and had my water and a pop tart. After that meal ... calories ... I packed up, bid good hike to Crossroads, waddled past the old gnarled tree (a known photo op at Bly Gap) and to the first white blaze of the morning, the first white blaze of the first morning in North Carolina! That first white blaze just happened to lead me 500 feet brutally up (in less .50 mile ... oh, and Joliet--where I live--is only 547 feet above sea level). After this, I got a reprieve. I trudged down thinking that was a unkind and foreboding intro to North Carolina, and before I'd even regained my breath, I was going up again. Another 400 feet. (And I was thinking very not nice things about this second state. Pass the border and BAM take that thru hiker! Granted,  it was made worse since I had just climbed out of my tent only 15 minutes earlier.) 
 Once again I was running solo, but at least today the snow was mostly missing and the temps were a manageable 50ish and sunny. 
I always joked with my father-in-law that the views of Colorado would be so much better if they would just cut down some of those darn trees. That is equally true of my AT experience to date. (Disclaimer: I in no way want anyone to be clear cutting forests for better views ... but a button say every 2 miles on the AT to make the trees slide to the side like drapes would be awesome!) 
 The terrain did level out around 4,500 feet for a few miles before North Carolina and the AT reminded me I was soooooo not in charge here. Standing Indian Mountain, while not horribly steep, is 5,479 feet. And it takes a good bit to trudge up from Deep Gap at 4,250 feet ... but once on top, the view was spectacular. (And no trees in the way.)
A hiker from Germany was already up top (a nice coincidence, because it isn't always easy to take good panoramic shots of yourself going it solo.) He said had taken a break from climbing all the 12,000 foot peaks he could get to in the Alps (he was about half done), to hike the AT. 
 The remainder of the day's 15.3 miles got me to Carter Creek Gap where I happily met up again with Happy Feet, Paul (now The Preferred Customer), Quebec and her dog, and Squatch and Squeak. 
 Oh, and I was reunited with my buddy from the night before, those swell wind gusts. And it's difficult to describe them, but imagine yourself on the side of a freeway with no cars. In the near distance you see a semi coming toward you and you can hear the roar of its engine. Over the next 5 seconds it gets closer, the roar gets louder. Then it blows by you, the wind from its passing roaring over and around you. That's what the wind was like ... you could literally hear it coming seconds before it got to you, racing and raging from a distance, then it would hit and rattle anything loose on your tent. But good ole REI Quarter Dome 1 held up ... all g'darned night. And it was awesome. Again, not a lot of sleep, but awesome.

Another night with limited sleep. Sleeping at 4,500 ft. was again chilly, with lows in the high 30s but my 20 degree bag was more than up for the challenge. (I slept in shorts and a short sleeve shirt and was very comfortable.) I ate cold pop tarts (or, more accurately,  pop tart flavored crumbs, as they don't really travel well), and drank orange flavored, caffeine infused water, packed up (in between the wind gusts which were still rolling thru) and moved on. I popped by Preferred Customer's tent to wish good hiking, snap a quick pic of the two of us, and moved onto the trail. My ongoing good luck with the weather held, and I hiked a good deal of the early morning with a hiker by the name of Power. (Power got her name because she was a collegiate athlete, a power forward, and another hiker had coincidentally mentioned off-hand to her how she was powering through the rough parts of the hike. So, Power it is.) We talked adoringly about our respective spouses, our work history, and by mid morning the temps had risen to the comfortable high 50s ...  then at the 5 mile mark the true ascent began. At this point, Power lived up to her name and left me behind. I'd overcome some pretty healthy ups and downs, and I was gearing myself up mentally for Albert Mountain, which to my understanding was a steep enough anyhow for a mountain, but for the last 300 feet it was bedrock, on all 4s, rock-crawl kinda steep. The uphill hike wasn't terrible, and to my pleasant surprise, although really steep (roughly 300 foot elevation gain in .25 mile), I was able to keep my feet and summit to a wonderful view. Already up were Force Flex, Curley Turtle, and Power. On top of Albert Mountain there is a fire lookout tower. (yeaahhhhh ... more up!) Of course I was going to climb that. Power told me regretfully that there had been Trail  Magic at the top of the tower ... someone had left IPA beers up there and she had taken the last one. I was like, 'awwww,' until she told us that that was the first Trail Magic she had received. (I already had 3 doses of Magic, so I didn't feel as sorry for myself.)
As I wandered the summit, Preferred Customer bounded to the summit. Good thing, that, because he pointed out that I was at the ... DRUM ROLL, PLEASE ... 100 mile mark! I took a pic of the marker jotted on the side of the tower.But as we all know all good views must come to an end (or something like that). So Preferred Customer and I joined forces and continued down from Albert. 
We played trail tag with Force Flex and Curley Turtle before they branched off at Rock Gap Shelter. We kept moving onto Rock Gap and beyond intending to hit Winding Stair Gap more than 3 miles more down (and up and down) the trail, where our shuttle to Gooder Grove Hostel would be waiting.The owner of the hostel, Zen, was waiting for us when we got there, just as he said he would be. He and his hostel are awesome! He shuttled us to and from the trail head, gave us a quick tour of Franklin, offered free shuttles to the local grocery, showed us around his home, explained the simple rules, provided an amazzzing shower (truly amazing) and a bunk for less than most charge for the bunk. (And the bunk had REAL sheets!) Oh, and for $5 they washed and dried our clothes. If you're looking for an awesome! (somewhat quirky) hostel, get with Zen and Gooder Grove.
At the hostel I met Jessica (a young woman who has already conquered the PCT), Samurai and Squints, (both strong hikers) and Sparky (retired military).
Although I've seen and heard evidence of buttholes on the trail, everyone, and I mean everyone I've met and spoken with has been the best kind of people, real and true assets to the hiking community. So in Gooder Grove Hostel I slept the first full night's sleep I've had in my 9 previous nights on the trail.

 The day break was amazing from the top of the ridge. Once again however it would have been better had just one big ole tree acquiesced and moved to the side just for a minute so I could snap the pic, but trees can be stubborn jerks doncha know. 
Knowing the destination was the Nantahala Outdoor Center and that check on time was 3pm, I was sooooo not in any hurry. But even casually, I still broke camp and started hiking by 8:10. Only 11.5 miles to hike.
The first modest climb was near the summit of Rocky Bald. The AT actually skirts the summit, directing hikers off-trail to the summit if one were so inclined. I was, in fact, so inclined. The side trail led over bedrock and through 6 foot shrubbery (""Bring me a shrubbery!"") for maybe 1,000 feet to the summit ... and it was the best summit view to date. The Hobbit, Gummy Bear, Preferred Customer, Helen, Caitlyn, and one other hiker I didn't know were up already admiring the view. I didn't stay as long as the others, because on my way up the blue-blazed trail, I passed a great tree that I knew I had to get a pic of for Tonya. The tree was all lines and sloping angles of dead branches. She sketches, shades and colors leaves and trees and she's amazing at it, and seeing it reminded me yet again how much I miss her.
Pictures taken I hiked on with Preferred Customer descending 1,000 feet to Tellico Gap with sunny, pleasant skies before turning right back up immediately gaining back 600 feet. (Funny how all those descents into Gaps and road crossing and such inevitably lead to nasty, long ascents back up.) These 600 feet led up to Wesser Bald and the fire tower on its summit. Of course the tower was not technically on the AT, but I still had to climb it. On a clear day, you could see for miles, over layers and layers of mountain. And this was a clear day. I lingered, even laying on the wooden deck of the fire tower for a few, before descending the stairs and taking up a seated position on the edge of the rocky outcropping of Wesser Bald's summit. Preferred Customer packed up and moved on, but I stayed; the view was too much for me to just glance at. I sat on a very nice butt shaped rock seat, my feet dangling over the edge for what had to be 15 minutes, just listening to the silence, then the wind or a bird's call. The picture won't do the experience justice.
Having lost Preferred Customer I dawdled in my descent. The trail ran over a narrow ridge for what seemed like miles. On either side of the trail the was a 100 foot drop with only the trees to stop you should you fall. Once again, I hope the pics do this justice. 
One thing, though ... no water source. I went what felt like 8 miles, under a cloudless sky for miles with very little water. The last mile I was completely dry. I did find a water source before arriving at the Nantahala Outdoor Center, so I didn't suffer too badly for my lack of foresight. But being out of water is not a fun thing.
The descent down to 1,700 feet was long, long, never ending, and long. It seemed to go on forever. The day, all tolled, was the longest 11.5 miles of my infant journey to date.
The Nantahala Outdoor Center is a water recreational area built over the Nantahala River. They have canoes, zip lines, rapids, and a hostel, general store and restaurant. 
I met back up with Preferred Customer and we got with Helen, Caitlyn, Dutchie, The Hobbit, Peach (as recently as that afternoon he had been Gummy Bear), and Jessica for dinner. (Burger, fries, and soda). That took a couple of hours, but eventually, only me n Preferred Customer remained, as the others moved on from the N.O.C. 
Me n Preferred Customer got our bunk room keys, settled in for the night. I glanced at AWOL and saw what we were up against the following day. (Another rise from a long descent. This time 3,300 feet climb out of the valley that the Nantahala River had carved out.)
We had 2 bunkmates in the bunkroom. One was a fellow from Boston, named Two Hats. This was his second attempt at the trail. He had damaged his Achilles last year and had recuperated enough to try again this year. The other was a career hiker (by the look of him) named Duck Fart. He was a gregarious older man with experiences and a willingness to share them.

Well ... Duck Fart didn't sleep well, so that meant neither did I. To be honest, the N.O.C. bunk was a little rigid, so I wouldn't have slept well either way, but Mr. Fart was up at 430am, and I couldn't get back to sleep after that. 
The mello yello I had purchased the day before went well with my breakfast of lipton rice and broccoli, and after that Preferred Customer and I started the menacing 3,300 foot climb. (The bunk room we slept in was already 23 feet up the ascent according to my GPS, so I had that going for me ...) 
It was much, much more forgiving a climb than the descent to 1,700 feet into the N.O.C. the day before. Regardless of the poor night's sleep, I felt strong and made the uphill, 8 mile journey in a little more than 3.5 hours. The combination of a forecast calling for rain, corresponding grey skies, and how I had started so strong that I was alone on the summit: the combination meant I didn't take any shots from the 5,052 foot summit of Cheoah Bald aside from the geological survey medal. (So yes, I was there!) 
The day continued with grey skies that never delivered (thank you for that!) And I continued to make good time alone. But again no good water sources (other than the one I stopped to video-- I recorded it and the surrounding flora and trail, but did I get any water ...? nope. Dumbass.) My water did last today until I hit the shelter, but only because it was an overcast 55, and not a hot and sunny 65 like yesterday.
I stopped at Stecoach Gap-- there are 2 picnic benches there, so I sat for a snack of skittles and a pepperoni tortilla. There was a woman giving her dog a potty break from their car ride and she asked about my hike. She asked where and when i had started, if a had a name, if I was going the whole way ... (It is becoming easier for me to talk to strangers about what I'm doing.) She took her huge dog up the trail a ways and I finished up my quickie lunch, packed up, and moved on. (Come to find out, a little bit later another woman coming up to the Gap to resupply her son on his thru hike brought a big bag of cheeseburgers and chicken sandwiches. A couple hikers who arrived at the Gap after I got some real timely Trail Magic.)
15 of the 16 miles were forgiving (even that first climb up from the N.O.C). But that last mile ... let's just say I'm really, really happy I didn't have to climb it in the rain. It's a section called Jacob's Ladder, and it seemed longer than the climb up to Albert Mountain. It rises 642 feet in .52 miles. On dry dirt and leaves and rocks it was exhausting. I can't imagine how difficult it would have been had it been a muddy, gloppy mess. I was, again, fortunate that the rain held off just long enough for me to crest this rise. The shelter was only .5 mile from there, and just as I pulled in it started to sprinkle. 
This is the second night I'll spend sleeping in a shelter. The first was my first night on the trail. Then it was me and Sam (I do wonder where he is now). Now there're 7 of us crammed in here, all new to me (including a hiker from Paris, France ... I miss Tonya). There may be more packed in before the night is out. After my dinner of dehydrated beef stew (Mountain House brand, very yummy) and water I curled up near two strangers and sorta slept ...","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Postal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587777,"Day 14, Monday I'm glad I got into the shelter last night because the rain was on and off (but mostly on) all night. It was noisy on the metal roof of the shelter, but I was dry. And if nothing else the rain drowned out the nocturnal noises of some of the shelter residents. One great thing about this shelter--and it was noted as such in the shelter register--there was no sight or sound of mice all night. No mice sniffing, no mice chewing, no mice crawling over me or my stuff. (The shelter register is a notebook in which those who rest, snack, or sleep in or near the shelter sign, often leaving little notes, jokes, anecdotes or illustrations.) Once morning broke, Preferred Customer, Peach, and Sparky met at the shelter, they having tented nearby. (There were others, but I didn't get their names.)The destination for the day was Fontana Dam, 11.5 miles down the road, so I geared up with pepperoni, skittles, a protein bar, and 2 excedrin for breakfast. Once again I started out strong. I'm reluctant to put into words how good my knees and feet are performing,  even my introductory blisters have healed over--I hope I'm not putting any kind of mama voodoo hex jinx on myself by writing this ...All dudded up in my rain gear (I'll have to get a pic next time, I forgot this time), I started out. Before long the drizzle tapered off, so off came the poncho. This held for a couple of hours, but all too soon the 70% chance of rain won out and rain started falling in a steady, but not heavy, fall. On went the poncho. After 6 miles and about 3 hours I came across Cable Gap Shelter, one of the older shelters on the Trail. Really thoughtfully, the builders placed this shelter right on the AT (not really the norm to my limited experience). Therein I had a real (by my AT standards) lunch. I heated water for hot chicken noodle soup and with it had Ritz crackers and pepperoni. (Sensing a pepperoni theme to my meals?) Preferred Customer passed by while I was eating. Then, just as I wrapped up and was ready to journey out into the rain again, Sparky wandered up for his lunch. We caught up, meaning I stayed out of the rain for another 5 minutes or so ... but then I had to go. The trail for the remainder of my 5 mile, 3.5 hour hike day wasn't terribly vengeful. It was little ups and downs until the big descent toward Fontana Dam. That said, the trail was a muddy, slippery, aggravating, treeroot-riddled, frustrating, rocky, slowing-my-progress-so-I-don't-slip quagmire (""Giggity!"") Also, that being said, I did slip ... twice. Once to my knee (""Slop!!""), and the second time I actually took note of someone who before me had skidded in the muck, and I thought, 'nope I'm not gonna step there,' so I stepped further to the right ... and then went down anyway. (""G-Damnit, Archer!"")Sooooo anyway, with that the day pretty much ended. I'm at Fontana Dam. I'm dry. 90% chance of rain tomorrow. I can see the Smoky Mountains! I'm 2.8 trail miles from the Smoky Mountains!","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

 Another zero. This time at Fontana Village.
But I had company. Granny Gear zeroed, as well as Helen, Jessica, Caitlyn, and Dutchie.
But the morning started with a breakfast at the Village Resort. Granny Gear and I wandered into the restaurant and ordered. My omelette and potatoes was really quite yummy, and G-Gear seemed to enjoy his too because we both finished with empty plates. Before we could get up, Splinter Britches came in and we invited her to sit and eat with us. Then Dutchie came in, saying the girls were eating meals in their room. When Splinter Britches and Dutchie got their food, Power came in and sat near by. None of us had ever seen the Upper Peninsulinian (??? she's from Michigan) ... well ... cleaned up, so Splinter Britches said unabashedly loudly ""hey Power!"" ... so Power joined us. 
And ironically enough, within minutes after she did, the power went out in the entire complex. No joke. Evidently a tree had fallen on power lines and ""Bloop!"" out goes the lights, the laundry, the TVs, the electrical outlets, and the 2 restaurants. 
Fortunately for us all, however, the beer coolers still worked ... again, no joke. 
So our zero consisted of sitting around, or wandering the grounds of Fontana Village Resort in the drizzle trying not to use our phones, because we couldn't charge them back up. The Smoky Mountains are notorious for their lack of electrical outlets embedded into tree trunks, so we didn't wanna go in with near-dead phones. 
Two things did make this day not so crappy ... 1. the front desk did offer to charge our electronics for us after about 7 hours of powerlessness, as their entire desk was running on the generator; and, 2. The kitchen for the Resort somehow managed to whip up warm pulled pork sandwiches, BBQ sauce and potato salad. (I didn't ask how or from whence it came, I was just grateful for hot food.) And to their credit, they didn't charge for the dinner. There were probably 30 people eating, some taking 2 and 3 trips (I was a three-peater) for sandwiches, and they just kept the sandwiches coming. 
One item of note, during the day plus that we spent there, all the girls finally got their trail names. Helen is now Sweets (based upon the almost obscene amount of candy she carries). Jessica was dubbed Minaj (based upon her knowing most lyrics to and singing Niki Minaj songs on the trail--she said she would go by Mini if any kids asked her her trail name). And Caitlyn is Dimples (for completely obvious reasons if you ever met her-- she is ALWAYS smiling). 
We 5 crammed into one room (me n G-Gear got the beds), Dutchie bunked with Sparky in another room,... And we all plugged in our devices with care, hoping the electricity soon would be there. 
At 10:40p.m. the power did come on. 
And all was charged. Sleep well, T.","Fontana Village Resort

The last day of this current 4 day rain giveaway! Get your rain now and we'll throw in mid 40 degree temps for free!
(Tomorrow will be better) 
Waking up in Mollie's Ridge Shelter at 6, I was packed and on the trail by 7. My breakfast consisted of 8 Oreos and chlorine-treated water. (I shared 2 of my Oreos with the couple above me that had located my sleeping bag compression sack the night before.) 
I started on the trail by myself, and much to my surprise the sun was out! (Insert Austen Powers 'Yeah, Baby!') The sky was blue ... ish! My really, really short term goal was to make it to the next shelter 3 miles down the trail for some semblance of a real breakfast. 
I passed only a single hiker, he was heading South. He was just as happy with the brief reprieve from the rain. 
I made it to Russell Field Shelter for second breakfast still under warm skies, but while i retrieved water (that I had to filter, but didn't have to boil) I saw dark clouds percolating in the western skies. I inhaled my pepperoni, crackers, and water, packed up and started to move on when I looked to the east. A hiker was securing his hammock for the morning and beyond him I saw clouds in the valley below. The picture won't do it justice, and although this isn't the first time I've been above the clouds, it's still wonderful. 
Within 25 minutes of leaving my breakfast hostel the sky released its wet, chilly bounty. The rain, while really unwelcome was gentle. Gentle but persistent ... like, all day persistent and it played absolute havoc with the trail. 
Most of the rest of the hike I was solo, except I played trail tag with The Hobbit a few times.
And the rain, which started gently at 935ish, continued, just as gently up to and beyond the time I walked, drenched and muddy, into Derrick Knob Shelter at 300pm. 
The hike, while only 12.1 miles, was frustrating because of the sloppy conditions. Perhaps counterintuitively, it took longer to descend the trail in its repeated downhills because of the muddy mess, than to ascend the inevitable uphills. I had to take tiny steps, looking for the least mushy, muddy spot to place my next foot. But I didn't fall! No muck-ass for me. 
Toward the end of the day I did pass a hiker name of Moxie. She was so upbeat and contagiously positive that it carried me the rest of the way. She said she was being careful with her steps, too, because she didn't want to be named Falls-On-Ass-In-Mud. 
All things considered, I got to the shelter early enough to get 'seniority' and keep my spot. Fortunately, Granny Gear made it here early enough, as well. 
With the lows in the low 40s tonight and the rain continuing till around 11pm, I was glad I was in the shelter and not tenting.
This shelter, like the last, had a tarp enclosing the front opening and also like the last, this shelter had a fireplace. A hiker named Dragon Breath tried his damnedest to get a fire going but after an hour he was still at it ... go Dragon Breath!

Day 3 in the Smokys started off cool, but ... quiet. Listening, there was the noticeable absence of the pinging of rain off the shelter roof. I laid in bag for a while, past 630, only listening for the sounds of rain to reemerge, other hikers getting up and moving out. Me n Granny Gear had talked the night before and decided to go another 12 mile day. This day would take us not only to the highest point on the AT (Clingman's Dome), but it would get us past the 200 mile mark.
It was another 35 minutes before i rallied myself to get up. i reached under my sleeping bag for my hiking socks and yup, they were still wet and cold. But judging by the wet stain on the wooden floor of the shelter, they were not as wet as they had once been.
Still in my dry, warm clothes, i wandered out into the morning fog, assuring myself that there was in fact no rain falling from the skies, and meandered out to the privy area, not going out deep enough to enter the mine field.
Over the next 20 minutes, i rolled up my sleeping bag, disrobed down to my undies and put on my wet, muddy pants (good for a shiver or two, but it wasn't terrible) and my long sleeve fleece. I then got out breakfast (ramen noodles, pepperoni and crackers), and made my way outside again to the cooking/dining/picnic area for breakfast.
I dragged my breakfast out as long as i could before walking back into the shelter and staring down my wet socks and wetter shoes. Damn. So off came the dry socks and crocs, and on went the wet. I stowed the dry items, then threw the backpack on and started for the day, knowing that with enough walking, even through a foggy, chilly morning, my feet would warm up.
Granny Gear was ahead of me by a few, and i snapped a picture of him in the morning fog. The trail was so much better early on without the overnight rain and the sucking mud and puddles. I still had to watch my steps on the downsides so as not to slip, but was stll so much better.
This was another day when we were going to stop at the first shelter for a second breakfast and anything else that might warrant a break. That shelter, Double Spring Gap Shelter, came after only a little less than 2 miles. The sun had broken through the fog (we actually cheered), so i shed my fleece, gathered some more water, and finished off my skittles and crackers. Then we were off. Clingman's Dome lay ahead, only 2.8 'ahead' and 1,200 feet up.
For the past 4 days we had wondered if we'd be able to see anything from the summit, with all the rain and misery in the forecast, but today's forecast was sun, and thin clouds, and blue sky. And it was right on. Before 2 oclock we reached the summit of the tallest mountain on the AT. The summit is just that, the peak of the mountain, but someone had gotten it in their heads to build a big ole tower on the summit, so of course we had to climb up that ramp, too. The skies were blue, the sun was bright, and the visibility seemed to stretch for hundreds of miles. I've said it before and this will be the last time ... the pictures won't do it justice. (there have been a handful ... 3 or 4 ... times when i wish i had brought my Canon camera for pics instead of my cell phone. Now it's 4 or 5 times.)
I'll add this, too. The summit isn't actually ON the AT, so instead of continuing on from the summit, we had to backtrack to the point where the Dome's side trail branched off from the AT, so we could rejoin the AT at that same point. If we would have continued on the blue-marked trail from the summit that I had noticed, we would have missed about .2 of a mile of the AT. Hence, not hiked the entire AT. (it's beside the fact that i only had 2 months to hike, so i wasn't going to finish anyhow.)
The north side of the trail descending from the Dome evidently had gotten all the detridus from the shifting that caused these mountains. the trail was much, MUCH more rocky, and for the first 1.5 miles down, we were back into the mud, muck and the on-going stream that was the trail. (And my shoes had just started drying out!)
One noteable item ... we passed the 200 mile mark! Granny Gear had less than 2,000 miles to go ... he didn't seem much comforted by this fact.
it was during this descent that i heard my phone jangle ... SERVICE! ... in case i hadn't mentioned it, AT&T wasn't all that A.W.E. (-some) through the Smokys. I didn't take the time to look at it, but i continued down, frustrated, grumbling and grouching about the condition of the trail. (I even got so frustrated at one point that i shouted an obsenity at the Smoky Mountains ... yeah, actually shouted, loudly. wasn't proud of it then, not proud of it now. but it is what it is ...)
There was one more up and down, then a pretty significant detour off trail to get to the Mt. Collins Shelter. I walked through the approach to the shelter, through what had to be 20 tents already set up (it was early, too: maybe 3:45). I found a spot and quickly set up my tent without checking the shelter. After the last two nights in shelters, i really wanted to sleep alone ... 
I went up to the shelter to cook my meal (beef stroganoff--another big hit!), and finally looked at my phone.
I knew Tonya was going to need surgery, but we thought it could wait until i got back. It was a routine surgery, but she and the doctor thought it best to get it over with. The text i had gotten earlier read the surgery was in 4 days time.
There was no deliberation. There was no way i was not going to be there.
I ate, telling Skillet, After Party and Granny Gear that i was getting off the trail, that i was heading back to Chicago. I told them i only had 2 months to hike anyhow, so it wasn't like i was going to finish, so leaving early really wasn't going to affect the outcome. 200 miles or 800 miles, i wasn't going to finish this year. The important thing was I was going to be home for my wife and family.
my sleeping bag was warm, the night was quiet, and my sleep was restful.
I woke in the middle of the night, having already gotten 7 hours of sleep. Without a 4G signal, i could only plan
I called Motel 6 when i again had a signal halfway down the trail toward the Newfound Gap and they had a room. 
I caught a shuttle van the Baptist church runs during April from Newfound Gap to Gatlinburg (super awesome and friendly, BTW). From the Motel 6 i planned out Sunday. I would take an Uber from Gatlinburg to Knoxville, then get a rental car and drive back to Joliet. I would be home by 9pm sunday night.","Derrick Knob Shelter
