KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645761,"A couple months ago, Joanne asked me whether, if I looked back ten years from now, I'd regret not having attempted to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. The answer was obvious right away, but it took me a few weeks to accept it. An 80-mile hike in western North Carolina last month <https://www.trailjournals.com/...> cemented the decision: I'm going to hike from Georgia to Maine in 2022.
I'll start the 9-mile approach trail at the stone arch in Amicalola Falls State Park. The AT officially starts at the summit of Springer Mountain. But after just a quarter mile on the AT, I'll turn right onto the Benton MacKaye Trail (BMT). The 286-mile BMT ends at Big Creek at the northeastern edge of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. From there, it's a short road walk to the Chestnut Branch Trail, which joins the AT near Davenport Gap. Starting on the BMT will add 52 miles of hiking and some other challenges: more elevation gain, rougher treadway, several cold-water fords, no privies, and only two shelters with picnic tables. Furthermore, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) won't recognize this as an official thru-hike of the AT.
Why start on the BMT, then? First, the southern end of the AT is notoriously overcrowded at the beginning of thru-hiker season. I've been there, and while it was an experience to remember <https://www.trailjournals.com/...>, I'd prefer to spend my first few weeks away from the crowds. Historically, 25% of thru-hikers who began at Springer have quit before Davenport Gap. Second, this hike is for me, not for anyone else. I'm not undertaking it for any kind of official recognition. Third, I've already hiked the AT in sections from Springer to Davenport Gap, whereas the BMT will be mostly new to me.
Note: While on trail I won't be spending much time checking email or perusing social media, but I'll keep an eye on the Guest Book (in the column to the left). Drop me a note!",,View Entry,"Nov 11, Thu",0
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645762,"My friend and frequent backpacking partner Neon has offered to hike the first 80 miles with me. He's able to take a week off work in early March. I can't think of a better sendoff than that!
I'll fly to Atlanta on 5 March and we'll start walking on the 6th. I've purchased a one-way plane ticket and registered my hike with the ATC. Neon and I have arranged a car shuttle and reserved a room at the Amicalola Falls Lodge. 
It's beginning to feel very real. My feelings alternate between excitement and dread. I relish the opportunity to leave everyday ""first world"" worries behind so I can appreciate more fully what nature provides. I've usually been a little sad at the end of a hike. No matter what happens, it will be an adventure to remember.
So why the trepidation? Well, the odds of making to Katahdin aren't great: only 19% of those who attempt a thru-hike succeed. In his book Appalachian Trials, Zach Davis explains why the success rate is so low:
....One foot in front of the other. Do this approximately 5 million times and you have successfully walked from Springer Mountain, Georgia to Mt. Katahdin, Maine. It’s as simple as that, right? 
Right. Except for one thing, the five million part. 
You might assume that the most difficult aspect of walking the length of the eastern United States would be purely physical. Undoubtedly thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail is a physical feat on par with few other challenges in life. You will push your body to new extremes. You will sweat. You will struggle. You will wake up and fall asleep sore. With that said, the physical challenge is not why seven in ten aspiring thru-hikers ultimately fall short of their goal.
In no uncertain terms, the psychological and emotional struggle is what drives people off the Appalachian Trail.
It’s the unpredictable and daunting psychological impact of your Appalachian Trials. It’s the homesickness, redundancy, and loneliness. It’s the thick, sweltering heat while scaling a shadeless, rock-face mountain. It’s trying to sleep through sub-freezing temperatures, hoping that wearing every damn article of clothing in your pack and wrapping your sleeping bag over your head will provide enough warmth to grant a few hours of sleep. It’s the constant swarm of mosquitoes, flies, and gnats. It’s the boredom that comes from another day of walking through lackluster terrain. It’s the pain that strangleholds every muscle of your body upon waking. It’s putting on sweat soaked clothes for the fifth morning in a row. It’s trying to sleep next to that snoring asshole six inches from your face. It’s waking up in a shelter to sound of a mouse eating his way through your backpack. It’s pooping in the rain; have fun trying to wipe. It’s drinking discolored stream water. It’s wandering a mile off trail before realizing you have no idea where you are. It’s checking your nether regions for parasitic and disease carrying ticks at the end of an exhausting day. It’s living in a constant coat of filth. It’s walking consecutive days with a set of throbbing blisters between your toes and on the sides of your heals. It’s veering off trail to go to the bathroom, only to look down and notice that you’re standing in poison ivy. It’s rocks eating through your boots and insoles, making it feel as though you’re hiking barefoot. It’s running through a storm while hearing lighting crash down on every side of you. It’s the rustling of an animal prowling outside of your tent just moments before you were going to fall asleep. These are the reasons people throw in the towel, not because a climb is too daunting.

Of course, not every day will be miserable. In fact, many days will be indescribably fun and uplifting! But no matter what happens or how far I get, this will be an adventure to remember!",,View Entry,"Nov 12, Fri",0
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646134,"What's an adventure without a setback? For the past 13 months I've been plagued by Achilles tendonitis. As you'll see in my recent journals https://www.trailjournals.com/..., the injury hasn't stopped me from backpacking, but it has hampered my enjoyment. After consulting a sports medicine orthopedist, I decided to undergo a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) procedure. The treatment was yesterday. I'll be in an immobilizing boot for two weeks, to be followed by approximately six weeks of physical therapy to regain strength and range of motion. Right now, it's very sore! Even with the boot, I've needed one or two rubber-tipped trekking poles for additional support as I hobble around my home.  
My shakedowns are done and my gear is dialed in, with only a few decisions to make--mostly clothing. Right up until the procedure, I'd been day-hiking local trails two or three times a week with a weighted pack. I felt good about my preparation, but with less than 11 weeks before my start date, the recovery window is short. The challenge will be regaining strength and endurance without re-injuring the tendon before I start. I'm heartened by the knowledge that I can start the trail slowly, increasing my daily mileage as I continue to recover. Many people have hiked from Georgia to Maine with far bigger challenges!",,View Entry,"Dec 21, Tue",0
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647189,"With my departure less than 12 hours away, I've been frantic. There are all the usual backpacking preparations of gear, food, clothing, navigation, etc. Leaving home for 6 months multiplies the effort. 

Fortunately, I have a strong team of supporters at home. Shout outs to Dustin, Joanne, Jim, and Richard!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647201,"At 7:30 this morning, I locked my front door for what will probably be the last time for half a year. 
Neon, who drove from Columbia, SC, this morning, picked me up at the Atlanta airport. We parked at Dyer Gap, where Neon will end his hike next weekend. I left some resupply items in his car, and we took a prearranged shuttle to Amicalola Falls State Park. 
At the Visitor Center, a Trail Ambassador weighed my pack (32 lbs) and registered me as the 823rd thru-hiker of 2022. He handed me a thru-hiker tag for my pack and sent me on my way. Neon took my picture at the iconic stone arch that marks the start of the AT approach. The symbolism of walking through the arch hit me hard. I was a jumble of nerves as we set out toward the infamous 604 stairs to the top of the falls. 
It was barely a mile walk to The Lodge at Amicalola, just off the trail, where we're spending one last night in luxury. After settling in to our room, we wandered downstairs, where Nimblewell Nomad was giving a talk. (Nimblewell Nomad is legendary in the hiking community for being the second person to  have hiked all eleven National Scenic Trails and for being the oldest, at 83, to have thru-hiked the AT.) He inspired and motivated me. 
Not everything went smoothly, though. I discovered that I had left my glasses in Neon's car during the transfer to the shuttle. Later this evening, I realized that I had also left my toothbrush and toothpaste behind. We're far from the nearest store, so there's a challenge to be faced tomorrow.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647225,"After some text exchanges last night, shuttle driver Ron Brown purchased and delivered reading glasses, a toothbrush, and toothpaste to the lodge this morning. He handed them to me with a smile and refused payment. ""Trail magic,"" he said. 

Neon started an hour before I did, while I waited for Ron to bring my goodies. It was mostly cloudy but dry and unseasonably warm. The nice hiking weather brought out a few day hikers, but most of the people I saw were backpacking. 

The Appalachian Trail Approach, more commonly called the Approach Trail, took up most of the day. It connects The Arch to the summit of Springer Mountain, which is officially the southern terminus of the AT. Just a quarter mile beyond Springer is the southern terminus of the Benton MacKaye Trail (BMT). The BMT is where Neon and I are headed. 

 

We had agreed to camp at the large Three Forks campsite. I hadn't caught up with Neon during the day. When I reach Three Forks at 5:15, Neon was nowhere to be found. The six hikers who were here hadn't seen him, either. The campsite is unusually large, with lots of hidden clearings in rhododendron thickets. I looked all around, but there was no sign of Neon. He still hadn't appeared by the time I had set up my tent and thrown my bear line. I was worried. Finally, as I was eating supper just after sunset, he appeared. He hadn't noticed all the hidden tent spots, so he had continued on, looking for a good campsite. He had camped a half-mile up the trail. I was grateful that he returned to let me know he was OK. 

I'm tired, and my Achilles hurts. Lights out at 9:00.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647246,"It may have been the breakfast buffet yesterday. Or perhaps it was a case of nerves. Either way, diarrhea struck yesterday afternoon and evening. It's no fun digging a cathole in the dark at bedtime. I awoke just before midnight with my stomach in knots once again. Fortunately it settled, and I feel much better today. 

The day dawned cloudy and mild. Neon had started hiking, as usual, before I did. The BMT followed the same path as the AT for a couple miles before splitting off to the west. I saw six hikers in those two miles, in contrast to the BMT, where we met just five hikers in eleven miles. Three of the BMT hikers were college students on a shakedown hike during spring break, in preparation for starting an AT thru-hike at the end of the semester. 

 

It rained briefly several times. I'm carrying an umbrella, which is much more comfortable than wearing a rain suit unless it's very cold or windy. The on-and-off rain did get a little a annoying: there's a bit of a procedure to deploy or stash the umbrella. I caught up with Neon at lunchtime, and we walked and talked together during the afternoon. Around 3:30, the downpour began. We collected water and set up camp in moderate to heavy rain. I undressed and crawled into my sleeping bag to dry out and warm up. Fortunately, the rain stopped in time for supper, which made eating much more pleasant than it would have been in the rain. 

Everything was wet from the rain, and the temperature started to drop, so we headed to our tents early. All in all, it was a good day for hiking, just not a great one.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647258,"It didn't rain any more overnight, but everything was still wet in the morning. Even the outside of my sleeping bag was wet to the touch. 
There are fewer camping options on the BMT than on the AT. We had settled on an old roadbed about 50 yards from a two-lane paved highway. There wasn't much traffic overnight, and I didn't hear any excessively loud vehicles. What I did hear were chickens from the nearby chicken farm. Lots of chickens. Noisy chickens. All night long. They didn't stop me from sleeping, but I heard then every time I woke up and rolled over. 
I started hiking around 9:00, with Neon ahead of me. Although the day dawned cloudy, I was looking forward to the forecasted sunny skies and warm temperatures. An hour into my day's hike, I stopped at a pretty overlook on Toonowee Mountain to arrange replacements for some lost and broken gear. (Yes, already.)  It wasn't quite sunny, but the sun was trying hard to break through the clouds. I took off a layer of clothing. However, the almost-sunshine didn't last. It soon clouded over completely. 
At the summit of Wallalah Mountain, I met a southbound hiker moving very fast. (I didn't catch his name.) We chatted only briefly because he was obviously in a hurry. He did say he had just finished the Pinhoti Trail and was headed to Amicalola Falls to start northbound (NOBO) on the AT. Neon told me later that this super-hiker was planning to turn around at Katahdin and then hike SOBO to Key West. This year!
It sprinkled a few times just after noon. Just as I caught up with Neon at Payne Gap at 1:30, it started to rain. It gradually increased to a hard, steady downpour. The temperature, never having surpassed 50°, dropped. We arrived at our planned campsite, an open field on Bald Top, in steady rain at 5:00. Conversation ceased as we each focused on setting up our tents quickly as the rain fell and the wind blew it sideways. Once in my tent, a glance at the weather app on my phone revealed a huge area of moisture and precipitation across much of the Southeast. Cold and wet, I broke two cardinal rules of backpacking: I cooked and ate in the vestibule of my tent, and I'm sleeping with my food bags in the tent. Let's hope the bears are hunkered down out of the weather, too. 
One bit of good news: I hiked all day without feeling the need to take anti-inflammatories for my Achilles tendinitis. It's still sore, but that's progress.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647299,"Yesterday's rain continued intermittently overnight. Worse than the rain was the wind-driven mist that wetted everything that wasn't sealed in a waterproof container. Neon awoke with a puddle under his sleeping pad. The moisture had seeped into both of our sleeping bags. The last rain shower ended around 8:00, but the mist lingered most of the morning. 

A six-mile, mostly downhill, walk led us to Shallowford Bridge over the Toccoa River. We stopped at Iron Bridge Cafe and General Store to resupply. The pickings for hikers were slim. Most of the the food items were in cans or required cooking, not just adding boiling water. We settled for Snickers bars, packets of peanuts, and the like. The place had a North Georgia rural vibe, cimplete with contemporary country music playing. 

In this area, the BMT is a four-mile roadwalk. A half-mile past the Iron Bridge, we stopped into the Toccoa Riverside Restaurant for lunch. We dined on trout with salad, vegetables, and in my case, carrot cake. The easy listening music was from the Frank Sinatra era. Thw staff was equally friendly and helpful in both places, but the contrast was startling. 

As the roadwalk continued after lunch, we passed dozens of imposing second homes and gated communities. On a cool and dreary Wednesday, there wasn't much activity or traffic. 

Eventually, the BMT headed uphill from the road, on a footpath once again. There, we crossed Masshole, who had hiked the Pihoti Trail and was hiking south on the BMT to begin an AT thru-hike at Springer Mountain. He was the only other hiker we saw today. 

As I mentioned previously, camping opportunities on this part of the BMT are limited. We opted to make it a short day rather than a very long one. Our chosen campsite is beside fast-flowing Fall Branch, just upstream from the falls. Arriving at three, we hung our wet stuff out to dry. Although the mist had stopped, the weather remained cloudy and humid, so not much drying occurred. We took our time setting up, talked a while, ate dinner, hung our food bags, and crawled into our tents when it got dark at 7:30.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647324,"It didn't rain last night, and there was a sunrise this morning! It was still very humid, and there was a lot of condensation in and in our tents. But seeing the sun put smiles on our faces. We both put on our still-clean second pair of socks and hiked out together just before 9:00. 

The day began with a thousand-foot climb. It sounded daunting, but the sunshine and crisp air made it feel easier than it sounded. 

The BMT has been yielding one or two encounters with other hikers every day. Shortly after leaving this morning, we passed a young couple who were breaking camp. Our interaction with them was limited to greetings and finding out they were also headed northbound. I expected to see them later in the day since we were only walking a short distance, but they didn't reappear. 

Speaking of short day, our choice was to walk 10 miles or 16. We chose the shorter option. In between Indian Rock Shelter and the next (dry) campsite, the trail crosses private land where camping is prohibited. The shorter distances of the last two days have probably helped my Achilles. I haven't taken Aleve in the past three days. 

Today's route crossed an interesting variety of terrain. We experienced hardwood forest, rhododendron groves, a big open field, a small lake, and a couple miles through an upscale community of big log-cabin homes with fancy landscaping built into the rocky hillsides. 

We arrived at Indian Creek Shelter by mid-afternoon. It's one of only three on the entire 300-mile BMT. The shelter is pleasantly located by a creek in the upscale neighborhood of two-plus acre lots. One house looks down on the back of the shelter from a high bluff. A few other houses were barely visible through the leafless trees. We could occasionally hear souds of human activity over the gurgling if the creek. Altogether, it's a unique spot that feels close to civilization yet simultaneously removed from it. 

We took advantage of the sunny afternoon to dry our wet sleeping bags, clothing, and gear. No other hikers appeared. After early dinner, we hung our food bags and crawled into our sleeping bags in preparation for an early start tomorrow.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647335,"No latecomers joined us, so Neon and I had the shelter to ourselves. From the thick layer of dust, it didn't appear to have been used recently. 
The weather forecast for the town of Blue Ridge is calling for snow overnight tonight with a low of 24°F and wind gusts to 25 mph. Our original plan for the day was to hike 13 miles and camp at Halloway Gap. Given that conditions are likely to be even worse at 3,200' elevation, we left early so we'd have the option of making it to Neon's car today. 
From the shelter, the trail wound through a charming mix of trail and residential neighborhood roads. The houses, many log-cabin style, appeared to be mostly second homes. We saw one man out walking. He had also checked in on the shelter just before we started. Although the trail was very well blazed, we managed to walk a quarter mile off trail at one point and almost missed another turn. 
The pleasantness came to an abrupt end when we reaches the start of an unpleasant four-mile road walk. Neon, who walks suburban streets daily, pulled ahead of me. My Achilles tendon flared, so I took an Aleve and shortened my stride. Whether it was the pace, the terrain, or the medication, the inflammation subsided not long after we re-entered the woods. 
As he had on previous days, Neon set the pace and I followed. There wasn't much flat ground: we were either ascending or descending without interruption. But the treadway, for the most part, was soft and smooth. It felt to me as if Neon was walking faster than he had previously. Other than brief pauses for photo and video opportunities, we made only one stop for a quick lunch. 
The weather had been cool and damp most of the day. With the breeze, it felt colder than the 52° shown on Neon's thermometer at our lunch break. By the time we reached Halloway Gap, our planned stop for the night, the sun had emerged and it was looking like a great day to camp out. We both felt good, with enough energy to walk four more miles, mostly downhill, to the car at Dyer Gap. Knowing what weather conditions were in store, we pushed on. 
The last four miles were quite possibly the most enjoyable of the week. The trail traversed hardwood and deciduous forests, passed an old homestead with an enormous oak tree, and led us along a rhododendron tunnel that traversed some pretty creeks. We reached the car before 5:00, having averaged a tad more than 2 mph, including stops. 
While Neon drove us down the mountain in his car, I used my phone to find and book a room at Douglas Inn and Suites, the only motel in town that has a guest laundry. We showered, and Neon lent me some clothes to wear while mine were in the washing machine. We capped off the day and Neon's hike with a huge meal at a nearby Mexican restaurant.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647378,"What a difference a night makes! We awoke to snow flurries, strong winds, and two inches of snow on Neon's car. It would have been a miserable, possibly dangerous, night on the trail. Hiking in the mountains this morning wouldn't have been fun, either. In addition to the nasty weather, a coating of snow over ice would have made every step treacherous. 
I had left a partial resupply of hard-to-find items in Neon's car. After breakfast, I set about rearranging what would go on with me and what Neon would mail home for me. That done, Neon drove me to the Reid Ridge Lodge, where I had previously reserved the next two nights' stay. 
Saying farewell to Neon was emotional. He has been the most supportive, encouraging, and reliable companion I could have wished for. When we needed to make a joint decision, he often demurred, saying, ""This is your hike."" The other way of looking at it, of course, is that it was the entirety of his hike but only a small fraction of mine. I'll miss him in the days ahead. 
At the hotel, I perched on a stool in the small lobby, planning to hang out there until the weather improved. When the desk clerk Divi saw me and my backpack, he treated me like a celebrity. Based on earlier conversations with other staff about my reservation, word of ""the hiker"" had preceeded me. Peppering me with questions about my hike, he checked me in early to an upgraded room. 
The rest of the day passed quickly. I eagerly unpacked a package from home--thanks Joanne--and some replacement gear from Amazon. (My inflatable pillow leaked and mybfeet poked out the bottom of my sleeping bag liner.) I had lunch, walked downtown, and treated myself to a massage for my tendinitis. Blue Ridge, apart from a few blocks of touristy establishments on Main Street, isn't a very pedestrian-friendly town. Nevertheless, I walked about six miles on this zero day.

Today was more restful than yesterday. I probably walked only a couple miles. My favorite destination has been the superb Ingles supermarket. It has the usual deli and Starbucks, but it also boasts a salad bar, a soup bar, an olive bar (not just olives), even a wings bar, with a nice seating area next to sunny windows. 
Life has been a little too easy these past two days. I need to get back to the trail tomorrow. My one source of stress has been shuttle driver Richard Anderson, who hasn't responded to any of my text messages since Friday evening. He's supposed to pick me up at 8:30 tomorrow, but I don't feel especially confident that he'll show.

The drive up the Forest Service road to Dyer Gap was pretty. The early morning sun glistened off icicles and patches of snow. Grouse were wandering on the road, unperturbed by the vehicle. 

Some snow remained at the higher elevations. After a chilly start, the sun quickly warmed up the dry air. I went from three layers and warm gloves to a T-shirt in just a couple of hours. Hiking conditions were ideal, and the scenery stayed pretty all day. 

In late morning, I passed the junction with the Pinhoti Trail. All the BMT hikers I had crossed last week had come from the Pinhoti, so I expect to see fewer between here and Fontana. This afternoon, I saw two groups of day hikers. The first group consisted of five BMT trail maintainers who seemed to be out to enjoy the trail rather than to do any serious trail work. (That's not a judgment.) The second was a couple from Atlanta who were out for a short conditioning hike with weighted backpacks. 

Trail blazes, which had been exemplary to this point, suddenly stopped. They didn't just thin out, they disappeared completely. Several trail junctions were lacking directional signage, too. I was happy to have offline maps with GPS position overlay on my phone. I carry rudimentary paper maps and a cheap compass for emergencies, but the electronics eliminate almost all the guesswork. 
Double Spring Gap, my destination for the night, is just a few yards north of the GA/TN border. In keeping with the lack of trail markings in this section, there isn't even a sign marking the state line. It felt anticlimactic. I set up camp out of the wind, hung my food bag, and ate supper in the last of the evening sun.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647468,"Poor sleep the past five nights finally caught up with me. Feeling chilled, I crawled into my sleeping bag at 6:45 yesterday. I figured I'd write my journal entry and read a few pages of my book before going to sleep. I dozed until it was nearly dark. Or so I thought.... I awoke to bright moonlight at 11:20 PM. I tossed and turned a little, and then realized it was 7:40 AM. I must have slept more than 12 hours. 
All that sleep didn't help much this morning. The day started with a steep, nearly 1,000' climb to the summit of Big Frog Mountain, which I didn't embrace with much enthusiasm. From there, it was a 3,000' descent to the Ocoee River. The first couple miles of the descent were along a ridgeline that only hinted at the great views they woukd have provided on a clear day. Some patches of snow remained at the higher elevations, but there was no trace of white stuff by the time I got close to river level. 
No hiker sightings today. The only other person I saw before reading the campground was a mountain biker. 
Thunder Rock Campground opens for the season tomorrow. Had it been open, that's where I would have stayed. Instead, I booked a room at Ducktown Copper Inn, a motel popular with BMT hikers. As arranged a couple days ago, the owner Carl picked me up at the trailhead and drove me to the motel. After showering, I resupplied at the nearby Family Dollar and had microwaved dinner in my room.

I occasionally heard human activity, but I didn't set eyes on another person. This kind of solitude is a rarity on the trail. It certainly wouldn't happen near the southern end of the AT this month. It makes me glad I chose the BMT. 

The solitude does mean that I should be careful. There's nobody else around to help me get out of trouble. Case in point: I made a rookie mistake this morning. Knowing that there was a water source less than two miles from the trailhead, I chose to start hiking with just one liter of water. That's reasonable, but I got careless and missed the spring. I had about six miles to cover with just one liter of water. The going was easy, and the weather was cool, so the risk was minimal. But it did remind me that a more serious lapse could have much worse consequences. 

The weather forecast called for rain and showers all day. But the last of the steady rain ended by 8:00 AM. There was a little drizzle and mist later in the morning, but the total precipitation was minimal. The sun peeked through the clouds a few times in the morning and more frequently in the afternoon. By sunset, the sky was nearly cloudless. 

Tonight's campsite may be the best one of the hike so far. It's on flat ground near Lost Creek, which is almost a river at this point. I ate dinner on a rocky shore with the sun at my back. It felt deliciously warm without being hot or muggy. As I write this in my tent after sunset, the temperature is dropping and a very gentle breeze is keeping the humidity under control. It doesn't happen often on a long hike, but this evening I felt as if I was on vacation.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647549,"Today I hiked from Lost Creek to Loss Creek. (Could Tennesseans be in the habit of losing their creeks?) The trail followed Big Lost Creek downstream into what became a gorge with cascades. After crossing the Hiwassee on a highway bridge, the BMT followed that river upstream. Seldom during the day was I away from the sound and sight if running water. It was a treat for my eyes and ears. 

The day started cloudy and very damp. I rolled up my tent wet with from condensation. This morning presented my first two fords of this hike. They were both easy, one ankle-deep, the other up to my shins. The sun started to appear as I finished the second ford, and by noon we had clear blue skies and warm temperatures. 

Reliance, TN isn't so much a town as a few buildings scattered not too far away from the bridge over the Hiwassee River. Several rafting operations and a couple of restaurants near the bridge were closed for the season. A half-mile (roundtrip) detour took me to Reliance Fly and Tackle, a locally famous spot. The owner apparently doesn't serve very many hikers: he seemed surprised when I ordered a cheeseburger after eating the chicken salad sandwich that he recommended. 

It got quite warm in the sun this afternoon. The trail came upon a picnic area where three women were taking a break from paintings they had been working on as a grumpy man was grilling burgers. I stopped and talked, eventually taking them up on their offer of food. (In hiking parlance, this is called Yogi-ing, after the cartoon bear.) I munched on grapes, cauliflower, and celery while we talked; fresh produce is too heavy to carry, and places like Reliance Fly and Tackle don't have any other than slices of tomato. They even offered me a cheeseburger when they saw me looking at the grill. I turned down the cheeseburger with thanks, but it was good practice for the next opportunity! 

Although I obviously saw and spoke with other people today, none of then were hikers. If memory serves, it's been a week since I last saw another backpacker. I know there's another BMT thru-hiker heading SOBO. Our paths might cross tomorrow, unless we missed each other during my lunch detour today. I'm enjoying another pretty campsite alone tonight. It appears to be moderately used, but I haven't seen any trash. The scene on the AT right now would be very different.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647583,"I awoke several times last night. Each time, my tent was lit up as if by a nightlight. The full moon shone down brightly until clouds obscured it near dawn. Then, at first light, the eastern sky turned fiery red. It turned out to be a prescient omen. 

Yesterday's pleasant sounds of flowing rivers were replaced today by those of rain, thunder, and wind. The rain started at 11:00, thunder and lightning followed an hour later, and the wind picked up an hour after that. Fortunately, the rain tapered off in the afternoon, but not before the wind broke my umbrella. The temperature stayed chilly, too, not breaking 50° on my thermometer. Wind and wetness made it feel colder. 

The wind is the worst at high elevations. Strong winds make howling sounds as they whistle through leafless trees on ridges and in gaps. The wind whipping through Tate Gap, my intended destination for the night, could be heard nearly half a mile away. Securing a tent there against the wind would have been next to impossible. Sleeping through the noise would have required ear plugs, at least. The next tentsite, Moss Gap, is nearly six miles ahead, and the map shows it has similar topography. Water was becoming a priority, so I followed another hiker's directions to a nearby water source, a couple hundred yards down a fire road. Exploring a little farther, I discovered a nearly-flat spot, mostly sheltered from the wind, about a quarter mile from the trail. I'm camped in the middle of the road, so I hope the rescue truck doesn't need to come through tonight. 

One incident did break up the dreariness. It was mid-afternoon, almost exactly 24 hours since I had left the picnickers who fed me yesterday, my last human contact in that time, when I came upon a tent on the side of the trail. It wasn't blocking the trail, but it certainly wasn't in what you'd call a campsite. I called out, and a voice from within answered. Warren unzipped the door, introduced himself. He's hiking NOBO, possibly to Maine. We didn't talk long because I was barely staying warm while I was moving. But it was fun to finally see another hiker. 

I'm tucked into my sleeping bag as I write this, finally warm, dry, and cozy. I can certainly hear the wind, along with a few occasional drops of rain, but my setup here feels secure. Overall, today was more about making miles than enjoying them. Tomorrow will be a better day.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647627,"What's that I hear? It's a brook, not far away. I couldn't hear it at all last night over the wind noise, but it was as clear as a bell when I awoke this morning. The sky was mostly clear, too. Yay! 

A little reading over breakfast revealed that I was camped not on a fire road, but on private property. Oops. The owners hadn't come out with shotguns during the night, and the only trace I left was a rectangle of flattened leaves where my tent had stood. No harm, no foul. 

Today's section of the BMT coincides with the State Line Trail. As the name implies, it follows the Tennessee/North Carolina state line. That line is neither straight nor flat. Instead, it follows the highest mountain ridges and summits. At times, I was hiking southwest instead of northeast. After hiking nearly 13 miles, I ended the day 5 miles due east of where I started. And I climbed more than 3,000 feet to end the day 200 feet lower in elevation. That would suit me fine on a day hike, but it feels slightly frustrating on a long-distance hike. 

Temperature comfort was challenging, too. The air was cool, the sun appeared and disappeared, and the wind varied from calm to 20 mph. It seemed inwas constantly stopping to add or remove a layer of clothing. 

I'll stop complaining. Hiking was immeasurably more pleasant today than it was yesterday. My spirits were much better, too. Although there aren't many signs of spring at today's elevations (mostly 3,000-4,000 feet), the leafless trees allowed lots of pretty mountain views that are hidden in summer. 

At 6:00, I made camp in a stealth spot beside Brookshire Creek, so I'll sleep to the sound of cascading water. 

No people sightings at all today. This area is remote, but I'm surprised. I expected to see somebody else out on a dry, partly sunny Saturday, especially after the horrible weather we experienced last weekend.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647634,"This morning was the coldest of the hike so far, with my thermometer reading in the low 30s. There were no signs of frost, so it must have stayed above freezing. I bundled up and took my time, knowing I had plenty of time to catch my shuttle to Tellico Plains with Bill Schaaf. Tomorrow will be a recovery and resupply day. 

The trail was moderately sloped, but the going was slow. A section of rhododendron blowdowns were tricky to get around. There were several stream crossings, too. Most were rock-hops, but three required fording. Those of you who hike with me know that I usually just walk through and let my shoes dry later. But today I was wearing clean socks inside dry shies for the first time in days. So I changed footwear before and after each crossing. 

Even with all the delays, I arrived at Pheasant Fields Picnic Area more than an hour before my appointed shuttle time. I took advantage of the extra time to wander over to the nearby Tellico Trout Hatchery. Only a tiny portion of the hatchery was open to visitors, and there were few interpretive signs. However, it was cool to see their albino trout (bright orange color with red eyes) and some huge rainbow trout specimens. 

It's time I mention some new gear. First, I replaced an old piece of orange paracord with a 65' length of Zing-it dyneema throwing rope, marketed primarily to arborists. It tangled terribly, and I thought the only way to tame it would be with a spool, like those used for kite string. Then Neon showed me how to coil it so it wouldn't tangle. That simple trick has made a world of difference! Most hikers carry 50' of cord for hanging their food bags. I chose a slightly longer length, thinking that I could cut off a few feet it I ever need some for repairs or emergencies. Last night, I was glad to have the extra length. After managing to throw it (tied to a rock) over a high branch and lowering both ends to the ground, only six feet were left over. I must admit that it took several attempts to make that throw. 

Secondly, I have a pair of Xero water shoes that I've been using as camp shoes and stream crossing shoes. They weigh about the same as a pair of Crocs, but their lugged soles provide excellent traction on creek bottoms and on slippery surfaces around camp. They're quick-drying, too. My Achilles tendon doesn't like zero-drop shoes for extended wear, but they've worked well for my intended purposes. 

Finally, there's a pair of 2 mm neoprene socks in my pack. My feet are extremely sensitive to cold, and these have made crossing cold creeks far more bearable for me. In the five fords I've done on this trip, I've been able to focus on getting across safely instead of on the pain in my feet.

But the weather forecast is calling for 50-55 mph wind gusts at 4,500-5,000 feet elevation tomorrow night and Wednesday, exactly where I planned to be. Winds of that speed not only blow down tents, they also topple trees. With regret, I decided to wait out the storm in the safety of a building several thousand feet lower. It's a painful choice, especially since today is sunny and warm, with a barely perceptible breeze. 
The Lodge at Tellico is just less than a mile from ""downtown"" Tellico Plains, which doesn't have a single traffic light. It does have a small supermarket, a CVS, a Dollar General, and a handful of affordable restaurants. Store clerks and waitresses greet many of their customers by name. The tiny town also has a visitors bureau because it's a destination for bikers (the motor-powered variety), since it sits at the confluence of several renowned curvy roads. The talk of the town today was the prescribed burn taking place in Cherokee National Forest, just east of here. The grocery store cashier told me she always knows when the controlled burns are about to take place, because, ""The place fills up with Forest Service people not from around here.""

Innkeeper Bryan had generously offered to drive me to dinner at Iron Works Grille, a slightly more upscale eatery outside town, with picture window views of the Tellico River. At the last minute, he invited me to join his wife Catherine and him at their table. I love solitude in the wilderness, but in town it was a treat to have an evening of stimulating conversation with an intelligent, outgoing couple. 
This morning, I planned my hike through Great Smoky Mountains National Park and reserved my campsites. Backcountry camping in the Smokies requires a permit. Appalachian Trail thru-hikers can get a flexible permit that allows camping or sheltering anywhere on the AT in the park. To hike the BMT through the park, I need to reserve each  campsite for the specific night I'll be there. It's one thing if you're arriving by car on a predetermined date. Arriving on a long-distance hike adds some complexity to the planning process. 
This afternoon, I poked around the historic downtown of Tellico Plains. The area is transitioning. Like many small town centers, it has decayed considerably in recent decades. Today, it's home to an eclectic collection of touristy boutiques, a bakery, a coffee shop, and a couple of B&Bs, sprinkled among small offices and abandoned buildings. The old downtown is making a comeback, but it still has a way to go. 
Perhaps the most remarkable establishment is Everhart Lumber Company, on the eastern edge of downtown. Founded near the turn of the twentieth century, it still occupies the same space. Out back, it doesn't look too different from an old-time lumber purveyor. The showroom tells a different story. Today, the company crafts and sells beautiful furniture and accessories made from unique pieces of wood, impeccably finished, usually for custom order. I spent at least an hour trying to decide which pieces would go where at home. Alas, none of them would fit in my backpack.

This morning, innkeeper Bryan wished me a warm farewell, and shuttle driver Bill arrived right on time to take me to the trailhead. They were the last people I saw. 

The weather was cool and dry, mostly sunny, with a gentle breeze that picked up in the afternoon. It made for great hiking weather. The day's hike included substantial ascent, but it was mostly gradual. Footing varied from smooth and easy to rock-hopping ""upstream"" aomg the trail.

Whigg's Meadow offered pretty 270° views of the surrounding mountains and the plains in the far distance to the northwest. I stopped and sat at the edge of a small pond nearby for lunch. Once I was sitting still, four or five salamanders swam about near my feet. I could have spent another hour watching them, but I wanted to get to Cold Spring Gap early because I wasn't sure what the camping situation would be.

There were blowdowns and some erosion problems, but at least the trail was relatively well maintained.

Tin Man is hiking the BMT southbound (SOBO). He started in Key West in December, and he's hopscotching his way north by way of several long trails. When he reaches Springer Mountain, he'll turn around and hike the AT NOBO. Breakfast, by the way, was excellent. 
The short hike from Tapoco to Fontana was steep, but not nearly as rugged as yesterday's traverse of Joyce Kilmer Slickrock Wilderness.

About three miles from Fontana, the lake, dam, and resort village all came into view through the leafless trees. I've been in this area before, but I've never seen it from this perspective. Very cool. 
There's a huge wedding party at Fontana tonight. The Lodge and motel rooms were already sold out when I called a few days ago, but the reservations agent offered me a cabin at the hiker rate for a room. Nice! I was just glad to get a room for the night.

(The staff improvised with gas grills and a portable generator to take care of the huge wedding party that was occupying most of the rooms. I sat beside the big gas fireplace in the lobby and chatted with some vacationers from Atlanta. Using my phone as a flashlight, I explored the gift shop. To my pleasant surprise, I was able to meet all my resupply needs right there: lots of high-energy, lightweight food items, a selection of freeze-dried meals, and backpacking essentials such as fuel canisters. Not your average hotel gift shop! 

I headed back to my cabin as it grew dark. Facing west, the cabin had benefited from the late afternoon sun and was still comfortably warm. I unpacked my groceries, brushed my teeth, and went to bed. I awoke around 2:00 feeling chilly, so I crawled into my nice, warm sleeping bag for the rest of the night. 

The power came back on at 6:00, but only for five minutes. The same thing happened at 7:00. Deciding to make use of what I had at hand, I stepped onto the front porch with my JetBoil to heat water for oatmeal and instant coffee. As I started back in with a pot of boiling water, I discovered the door had locked behind me. Annoyed with myself, but grateful that I had put on shoes and a jacket, I made the quarter-mile walk to the front desk in the lodge. When I arrived, the lights were all on and the dining room was open. The situation was improving quickly! 

As the hostess was showing me to a table, a man caught my eye and asked, ""Hiker?"" He invited me to sit and eat with him. A previous thru-hiker, Ox was here leading an AT trail maintenance crew. After an amiable chat, he insisted on paying for my meal, which saved me embarrassment as well as money because my wallet was locked in my cabin, a quarter-mile away. 

When I finally got back to my cabin, the lights and heat were on. By the time I got everything organized and packed, walked back to the lodge, checked out, and had one more cup of coffee for the trail, it was after 10:00. 

I had panned a long hiking day because I expected a quick, early start after a lodge stay. The late start wasn't a maje problem, but I knew I needed to keep a good pace all day. The BMT is linked to Fontana Resort by a 50-yard connector trail. Ox had told me that fire crews had back-burned from the BMT last night, so I wasn't surprised to see the access trail roped off. Time for an unplanned roadwalk! The road is steep and twisty, with little or no shoulder. It can be a dangerous road to walk when there's traffic, but it was very quiet this Sunday morning. Part way along the road, I came across a bleary-eyed Forest Service firefighter who had worked the fire line last night. He told me he expected there would be some fire-weakend hemlock along the trail. As if on cue, just a few minutes later I heard a large tree fall in the forest up the hill, in the general direction of the BMT. 

Luck continued to favor me a couple hours later when I arrived at the Fontana Hilton (a trail shelter, not a chain hotel). In addition to a gorgeous view of the lake, there were a few beers on ice that a trail angel had left for hikers. And there was a trash can right there for the empties! A beer was just what I needed to prep me for the walk across Fontana Dam. I have strong acrophobia, and that dam is high! 

I entered Great Smoky Mountains National Park at 1:00. After sharing the same path for three miles, this is where the two trails split again. The remaining ten miles were pleasant and uneventful. Although the trail loosely follows the north shore of Fontana Lake, it has a surprising number of ups and downs and quite a few places where fancy footwork is required to keep your feet dry. 

Just before arriving at the former townsite of Proctor (abandoned when the lake was flooded during WW II), I visited the Proctor Cenetery. It's an eerie place, full of remembrances of people who once lived in a town that is, itself, dead. Many of the graves are still visited by the descendants of those who are buried here. 

It was nearly 6:30 when I arrived at the ""very popular, sometimes overcrowded"" Proctor campsite. I was, and still am, the only one here. It does feel as though there may be some ghosts nearby.

Today, as yesterday, the BMT coincided with the Lakeshore Trail. The name is slightly misleading because the trail doesn't hug the lakeshore. It meanders toward and away from Fontana Lake, sometimes as far as a mile away, but it is taking me generally eastward along the north shore of the large lake. Seeing the lake from time to time is uplifting, even if it's not at its prettiest with its current low water level. It reminds me of the ring around a partially-empty bathtub. 

The weather remained cool. It was clear overnight, just above freezing according to my thermometer, and then it clouded over just after sunrise. The windy wasn't as gusty as it had been the last few days, but it was blowing hard enough to form whitecaps on the lake.

Joining the ""bubble"" of thru-hikers on the AT next week is going to be a striking change. (I got a small tasted of it at Fontana.) 

I was glad to arrive at camp this afternoon. I was tired, and the soreness in my Achilles bothered me. In the last couple miles, I uncharacteristically misstepped and stumbled a few times. Recalling how long it might take to get help, I slowed my pace until I finally arrived. I had been looking forward to camping at a spot on the shire of the lake. But the lake had receded, making the site less idyllic. As well, the wind was blowing cold air up from the lake. Looking around, I found a nice location nearby, back in the woods, beside a stream. For added scenic interest, there's an old stone chimney nearby. 

Food note: For dinner, I ate a freeze dried Firepot Vegan Orzo Bolognese. I hadn't tried anything from the Firepot brand before. It's a nice change from the usual Mountain House or Backpacker's Pantry meals, and I liked it enough to look for it again. 780 calories, including 40 g protein from soybeans.

My alternative plan was to detour by climbing up to the Appalachian Trail and camping at Mt. Collins Shelter tomorrow night. But the weather forecast is calling for my nemesis: high winds, with gusts to 85 mph that night. 
Could I come off trail and wait out the storm? The BMT passes through the Road to Nowhere Tunnel, which I had planned to pass today. If I could get a ride into Bryson City and spend two nights there, I could resume where I left off and spend Friday night at Mt. Collins. When arranging a ride proved to be problematic, I chose another option: road walk around the closed area. Thirty miles of road walk isn't very appealing, but at least I'd be walking instead of waiting. 
The wooded part of today's hike was enjoyable. The trail was mostly well-maintained, and the grades were gentle. Lake views and mountain streams made fir pretty scenery. The sun came out at lunchtime, and it warmed into the 60s. After not seeing anybody else for nearly 48 hours, I crossed two groups of backpackers this afternoon. As I got within a mile of the infamous tunnel, the trail got wide and smooth, and lots of day hikers appeared. 
At the tunnel, I stashed my poles, ate a snack, and steeled myself for the ten-mile walk into town. The first six miles of the road were in the park, with wide shoulders and a 35 mph speed limit. Still, by the time I reached my hotel downtown, I was tired and sore. Reasonably-priced Stonebrook Lodge appears to be brand new. Once again, being a long-distance hiker got me celebrity treatment. The receptionist, with whom I had spoken on the phone, gave me a discount and upgraded my room. I won't get those perks in an AT trail town!

To compensate, I plan to resupply at Standing Bear Farm Hostel before I reach Hot Springs. The silver lining is that I'll leave here with less food weight in my pack than I would have.

This morning, all the plastic silverware was sticky with syrup. The Styrofoam dishes, also sticky. Even the yogurt containers and the cereal packs. I was puzzled about it until I realized the date. Some early-rising guest probably had some fun. 

Today marked the last segment of the roadwalk detour around the burn area with an 8.5-mile stretch to the BMT ar Smokemont Campground. I was pleasantly surprised to find sidewalks all the way to the boundary between the town of Cherokee and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The hard-packed Oconaluftee River Trail followed the river as far as the visitors' center. The next three miles along highway 441 to the campground had long stretches with no shoulder. The Park Service would do well to make our national parks more pedestrian-friendly. It was a relief to reach the campground. 

At the campground, I took advantage of the final civilized luxuries I'd see for a few days: picnic tables, restrooms, and trash cans. I chatted for a while with a couple and their kids from the Triangle area, and then I finally took out my trekking poles and started hiking. 

I reached Upper Chasteen Creek, my intended campsite, at 2:00. It would be a long afternoon of waiting for dinner time, and I still had legs, so I pushed on another five miles to Enloe Creek. My camping permit is only valid for Upper Chasteen Creek, so I could be cited and fined by a ranger. That doesn't seem likely on a cold night this early in the season. 

Enloe Creek has very limited tenting space. When I arrived at 5:00, there was only one tent and a couple hammocks, so I was able to find a flat spot. My companions this evening were trout fishermen from Mississippi. They built a fire ad invited me to join them for warming and conversation. I haven't had company at a campsite since Neon went back to work three weeks ago. It's been nearly four weeks since I've sat or stood by a campfire. I've appreciated the solitude these past weeks, but tonight was a reminder that fellowship feels good, too.

After packing up and saying farewell to the fishermen who had invited me to their fire last night, I set out at a leisurely pace knowing that I had a full day to walk just ten miles. I was glad I had walked to Enloe Creek yesterday. For one thing, I had done the last ford of the BMT yesterday afternoon while the air temperature was mild and I was warm from hiking. I appreciated not having to face it early this morning. The second reason I was glad is that it got some of the climbing out of the way. Long, steep hills were the order of the day, culminating in a 2,500' climb in the last 3.5 miles before the shelter. 

Today is my last full day on the BMT. I savored the scenery and solitude by walking slowly and taking an extended lunch break on the edge of Straight Creek. Pretty much as expected, I didn't see anyone else on the ten miles of trail I walked. At this time tomorrow I'll be on the AT, where it will be rare to hike a full day without seeing anyone. 

This is a more popular area of the park than where I started, and three other hikers were making camp when I arrived at the shelter. (All of us are tenting.) Carrie and Marybeth are middle-aged sisters. Marybeth, an experienced long-distance hiker, is reintroducing her sister Carrie to backpacking after a fifteen-year hiatus by doing a four-day loop trip. Andrew, also on an extended weekend trip, is hiking solo with a notebook. The young man from Cary, NC is writing his wedding vows. The four of us ate dinner together and then chatted around the campfire that Marybeth had made. It was a low-key way to end what has been a low-key day.

It was another chilly morning above 5,400 feet. My thermometer showed 33°F, but the wind in the gap made it feel colder. I set out with energy to spare, excited to be finishing the BMT. Even moving at a quick pace didn't warm me until mid-day. At the Mt. Sterling fire tower, I was only able to tame my acrophobia enough to make it to the second of five levels. That was disappointing because I've climbed higher on that tower in the past. 

The trail descends steadily from Mt. Sterling to its northern terminus at Big Creek. There are few signs of spring near the cold and windy summit, but as the trail descends, it passes through hemlock forest, rhododendron thickets, fields of wildflowers, and even some deciduous trees that are starting to leaf out. It's amazing to see so much change in vegetation in just six miles. 

Big Creek is a popular day use area in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I asked some to take my picture at the (very underwhelming) northern terminus of the BMT. Someone else was willing to take my trash home in their SUV. From there, a short road walk and two miles up Chestnut Branch Trail took me to the Appalachian Trail. I smiled when I saw the first white rectangular blaze. 

My intended destination for the night was Davenport Gap Shelter. When I arrived, it looked and felt like a depressing place to spend a night. There were no flat spaces to tent, and the front of the shelter itself is a chain link fence with a gate. It looked like a prison cell. And because it sits at 2,500 feet on the north face of a steep slope, it gets very little sun, and it felt cold and damp. Two hikers were sitting there, bundled up to keep warm and not looking very happy. 

A couple of hiker comments on the FarOut app suggested an unofficial campsite two miles ahead, nearly 1,000' lower, and outside the strict campimg rules of GSMNP. I was tired, but two downhill miles didn't seem beyond reach. It turned out to have been a great choice. My tent is on a nearly-flat spot on an island in a stream. A small ridge and the sound of the stream almost completely hide the noise from nearby I-40. 

The only other people here are a family of five from Florida. Morning Glory (mom) is thru-hiking with her two sons and two daughters, ages 9 to 18. From Monarch, the youngest, to Roadrunner, the oldest, I was impressed by their spirit and teamwork. (Dad is supporting them from home, and granddad thru-hiked in 1990.) It was a privilege to meet and chat with them. It was also humbling to hear how they had faced head-on weather events that had sent me to the nearest hotel room.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648319,"The 5Fs (famous family of five from Florida) was up early and left at least an hour before I did. They're remarkably well organized, each with their own responsibilities. They each carry their own food in a bear canister as well as their own luxury items. The boys, for example, have camp chairs. (I suspect they often get ahead of the others so they have extra waiting-around time.) 

The weather was ideal for hiking. It was cool, not cold, this morning, and everything was dry--no overnight condensation. The sky remained cloudless until late afternoon, and there was just a gentle breeze. My Achilles, however, is still sore from yesterday's miles. On a positive note, I've taken Aleve only once in the past two weeks. 

Just a couple miles from last night's campsite was an obligatory stop at Standing Bear Farm. Standing Bear is a legendary trail hostel and hangout with a laid-back hippie vibe. Other hikers were there to do laundry, take a shower, pick up a resupply box, or spend a night or two. Many seemed to be zeroing there. A few, like me, were checking the expiry dates on resupply items in the ""store"". I think I managed to avoid anything that was more than six months out of date. By the time I had made my choices, repackaged bulky items, eaten a cheese bagel, and put on my pack, it was 11:00. 

Although there was a lot of climbing today, it was much easier going than most of the BMT. The trail was mostly wide and smooth, well maintained, with very little uncleared deadfall. It featured switchbacks instead of going straight up or down the mountain spines. I made good time, but my late start and Achilles pain kept the mileage modest. I carried 4 L of water the last three miles so I could camp at an unofficial campsite instead of at a crowded shelter. I ended the hiking day earlier than usual at a small but pleasant campsite just off the trail. I'm alone here for the night, which makes it feel almost like the BMT. Almost. Separately, three hikers walked past as I was eating dinner. 

 

It was a good hiking day, the kind that makes me wish for more just like it.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648389,"Last night was mild (50°F) and very dry. A 10-15 mph breeze on the ridge kept the humidity low. Even the bottom of my tent was dry when I rolled it up this morning. The dryness was a bit surprising because the forecast was for rain to start around 1:00 PM. 

Last night I heard voices wafting up fron Brown Gap, just a couple hundred yards down the steep, winding trail. Somebody walked past my campsite by headlamp at 5:15 AM. Later, around 7:00, three of the 5Fs walked past as I was eating breakfast. The two boys had been the pre-dawn hikers. 

Later, I caught up with girls on a steep climb and passed the boys, who were waiting trailside for the others. Then, at Max Patch Road, I came across a huge trail magic setup. ""Good morning, hiker. Would you like some pancakes and coffee?"" was the first thing I heard. I munched a fresh apple while I waited for the big, thick pancakes to cook and the fresh coffee to brew on the propane stove. There were plenty of other treats and even a hiker box (take something or leave something). Perhaps the best part was watching the expressions on the faces of the 5Fs as they arrived in three closely-spaced groups. Fun and yum! 

Next up was Max Patch, a famous bald with 360° views of the surrounding mountains. By the time my pancakes and I summited, the hazy sun that had started the morning had all but disappeared. The early-morning dryness had quickly transformed into heavy humidity. The mountains were still visible, but almost as if they were partially hidden behind a veil. The views had an ethereal feel. It was cold and windy, so I didn't linger. 

Except on the exposed summits, weather conditions were good for hiking for the next few hours. As I was reaching the summit of Walnut Mountain a little before 2:00 PM, the rain started. Beyond the summit, I stopped in to Walnut Mountain Shelter. Daniel and Numbers, whom I hadn't met before, were bundling up and stepping out into the rain. Daniel had so much rain gear he looked as if he was mounting an expedition. (I later learned he was protecting a bunch of photographic equipment.) 

Sheltering in the shelter were Kris Kringle from Fairhaven, MA, and Dreamer from NH. Along with them was Dreamer's dog Victory. I had met the three of them briefly at Fontana Lodge a couple weeks ago. They were drinking coffee and chatting, waiting for the rain to pass. It seemed to me that the rain would continue for a while, so after eating a bagel with cheese and a candy bar, I headed out. It wasn't raining hard, but the precipitation was wind-driven and cold. The low clouds had enveloped the next peak, Bluff Mountain, so it was hard to tell the difference between rain and moisture droplets suspended in the cloud. 

Conditions improved as the trail descended several thousand feet. The rain eventually petered out, the wind abated, and the temperature rose a little. It onve again felt good to be hiking. Campsites along the way started to look more appealing, but I knew there were nice ones at lower elevation beside Deer Park Mountain Shelter, so I pressed on for more warmth and less wind. And that's exactly what I found when I reached my destination at 6:00, feeling good. 

Which bring me to some news: my trail legs are coming in! Today's hike didn't exhaust me. Sure, I'm tired, and tomorrow I'll be sore, but I'm thrilled that after ""doing a twenty,"" I didn't immediately crawl into my sleeping bag and close my eyes. Instead, after setting up my tent and collectin water, I wandered over to the shelter for dinner and socializing. Big ups to Carolina Mountain Club for keeping the trail in exemplary condition: I wouldn't have been able to do this with the downfall, erosion, and other obstacles on the BMT.

Last night's tent spot was ideal. I found a perfectly flat spot surrounded on three sides by rhododendrons that blocked the wind. It made me glad that I had done the extra miles to get to a lower elevation.
Today's walk was a short, easy stroll into Hot Springs. Laughing Heart Lodge and Hostel is a very welcoming hiker hangout. Although my room wasn't ready, I was invited to shower and do laundry while I waited. Hikers were hanging out at the many chairs and picnic tables as well as on the lawn.
Daniel, Numbers, Firewalker, and I ate lunch at the diner, visited the outfitter, had ice cream, and poked around the tiny downtown of Hot Springs. I checked into my (very nice) room in the charming lodge, arranged some logistics for the upcoming days, and put my feet up for a while. I've been pleasantly surprised at how well my body has adapted: no significant aches or pains other than my chronic Achilles tendinitis.
Water and I walked to dinner at Big Pillow Brewing and The Grey Eagle Taqueria. The two businesses share a large outdoor eating area, and it was a lovely evening to sit outdoors.

Relections after a month: 
My body isn't as sore as I had expected it to be. That may be due in large part to all the zeros I've been taking. I'm especially glad that I've taken only three or four Aleves in the past month. I still get cold easily and frequently. When the temperature gets down to freezing I feel barely warm enough in a 0°F sleeping bag, wearing wool long johns, a puffy jacket, and a beanie. I'm enthralled with the experience.

I took advantage of the time off to plan the next few days of hiking, reawaken my upper body in the hotel gym, pack a bounce box, launder my clothes (after only 3 days' wear, a luxury), get together with Dustin, eat healthy food, and do a little reading. Saying goodbye to Dustin this evening stirred up some emotions. If all goes well, I won't see him for six months. 

TMI alert: The rest of this post is about my body. If that doesn't interest you, click the Next button now. 

Weight loss: I weighed 155 lbs when I started on 5 March. I'd like to finish weighing no less than 140 lbs. I've lost only 3 lbs so far, which is great. My weight loss has probably been limited in part by the many zero days I've taken in towns, where food is plentiful and exercise is minimal. 

Peeling skin: The skin on the bottom of my right foot has been peeling for 7-10 days. It's not itchy like athlete's foot, but it's disconcerting. I thought it might be due to constant wetness, but spending time indoors in bare feet and sleeping in bare feet doesn't seem to have helped. I'm debating whether to start a course of anti-fungal treatment. 

Shit: Carrissa said I should talk about shit. Most shelters on the AT have a privy nearby. Think outhouse, but typically not completely enclosed. There are two main types: costing and mouldering. (See https://www.greenmountainclub.org/privy-privy-privy/ for an explanation.) Either type can be dirty and smelly, but they're unquestionably convenient if you're staying at or near a shelter. Privies require maintenance (""managing the fecal cone""), especially during peak hiking seasons. Kudos to the volunteers and ridge runners who take on that dirty job! 

If there's no privy nearby, the alternative is to dig a cathole. An environmentally responsible cathole is at least 200 feet from campsites, trails, and especially, water sources. It should be at least 6 inches deep and 4-5 inches in diameter. It sounds simple until you need to dig one: there's a lot of rocky soil and much unsuitably steep ground in the Appalachian Mountains. My hip flexors are limber enough that I can squat over a hole without holding on to something, but some hikers need to dig within reach of a tree trunk or limb to hold onto while doing the deed. There are no privies on the BMT, so it felt luxurious to use an AT privy for the first time a few days ago, after four weeks on the trail. 

Another toileting challenge is privacy. It wasn't a problem on the BMT, but there's a saying on the AT that if you want to meet someone, just stop to pee. Before spring leaf-out, it can be a challenge to find any kind of privacy for urination or defecation when and where you need to go. This will improve in a few weeks.","Weaverville, NC

Snow started to appear on the ground as I climbed from 2,200' at the gap. By the time I reached Rich Mountain Fire Tower at 3,700', the ground was almost completely covered. It felt good to be back on trail. 

I've climbed Rich Mountain Fire Tower many times over the years. The 360° views are always impressive, but the air today was especially clear and crisp. Photos don't convey the grandeur of the surrounding mountains. 

I hiked alone for most of the climb, but other hikers started to overtake me as I reached the tower. Many others passed me as the day progressed. It was a little humbling because I had a six-mile head start. I shouldn't have been surprised. I was being passed by the fastest of the hikers who had hunkered down in Hot Springs while the storm passed. Laurel Gap Shelter and the surrounding tent spots were crowded with hikers. Most of them were averging 20-25 miles/day. The ""slowpokes"" who more closely matched my speed and daily distance probably stopped at the previous shelter. 

Snow cover was still extensive when I stopped for lunch at Spring Mountain Shelter, but by then the warm sun was quickly melting the white stuff. It seemed that almost as soon as I started walking after lunch, the snow suddenly disappeared. By late afternoon, there were only a few rare traces in heavily-shaded nooks. 

On the final 1,600' climb toward the shelter, I thought I heard a Quebec French accent. Sure enough, we were four Québecois at the same picnic table, and dinner conversation was mostlybin French. Two of the guys had been hiking together, but the other two just happened to be seated at the same picnic table at the same time. Jeff (Southern for ""J.

My tiredness came to bear when I threw a bear line. I made a rookie mistake, getting the line caught in a tree branch. I had to cut it. Fortunately, I still have enough line to throw branches that aren't too high. For now, I'm going to bed.

The rain started just after 5:00 AM, and with the exception of two short breaks, it rained all day. At least it wasn't cold, with temperatures hovering around 50-55°F throughout. 

Perhaps the weather had something to do with it, but my Achilles was unusually sore this morning. Even after taking naproxin, it bothered me. But I packed up and headed up the trail. The usual bunch of fast hikers who've been around me the past couple days passed me in the morning. Worse than the rain was the slippery mud. Even at the glacial pace of 1 mph, I slipped frequently and narrowly missed falling. I stopped for lunch at Hogback Ridge Shelter feeling yucky. 

Frodo, who was already there, told me the radar showed the rain would increase, not decrease this afternoon and evening. He mentioned that some other hikers were staying at Nature's Inn Hostel and Cabins. The hostel offered shuttle service from Sams Gap, just 2.4 miles ahead. A phone call verified they still had a bunk available, so I made plans to stay there. 

Frodo was waiting under the I-26 overpass at the gap, as he had decided to stay at the hostel. Hostel owner Amy picked us up in a few minutes. On the way to the hostel, she mentioned there was a private room available in the ""main house"". Being an insomniac, I jumped at the opportunity to stay there. The main house is a typical 3-bedroom, 1-bath ranch house with its own kitchen, living room, and washer/dryer. Amy and Sherpa, a friendly couple from Edmonton, are in one of the bedrooms. The third one, as of 8:00 PM, is free. 

I walked over to the large ""lounge"" building for dinner. The wood-burning stove there is the main draw. There were about 20 pairs of shoes arrayed around it. In a semi-circle around the shoes were hikers on couches. Tables and chairs made up the third ring, with cooking facilities on the outside perimeter. For dinner, I found two pulled pork sandwiches, two bags of chips, a packaged apple pie, an orange, and five mini ice cream treats. Hiker hunger is real, even when healthy food choices are limited.

After a junk food breakfast and some good coffee, we piled 14 hikers and our gear into a 10-passenger van for the ride to the trailhead. I started up the trail at 8:15, feeling good despite the short night. 

About ten minutes later, as I settled into a steady hiking rhythm, I had a sudden thought that I had left my puffy jacket in the dryer. Sure enough, when I went through my pack it wasn't there. Amy, the hostel manager, had already left to shuttle hikers to Spivey Gap and Erwin. It took a while to reach her, but eventually we connected. I retrieved my puffy, but the episode delayed my start to 10:15, two hours later than anticipated. 

As I waited at the trailhead, I was struck by how many hikers went by. Just before Amy arrived to pick me up, another car stopped. Out stepped Firewalker and Numbers, whom I had last seen in Hot Springs. They told me Daniel was now about 30 miles ahead. This surprised me because when I first met them, Daniel was struggling to keep up. 

The trail was still muddy in places, but footing was far more secure than in yesterday's slippery mess. It rained lightly for a couple hours this morning, and it threatened to resume a few times during the day. Some hazy sunshine appeared for a couple hours in the afternoon. 

Big Bald provided the day's highlight. The trail traversed a long section of treeless highland above 5,000 feet, providing 360° views of mountains in all directions. From there, Wolf Laurel Ski Resort looked even smaller than it is. The hazy sky made everything seem slightly unreal. I didn't linger because the gusty wind was very strong, making it difficult to stand, let alone hold the camera steady. 

I pushed the pace and ate lunch while underway, still angry at myself for forgetting my puffy. I passed Firewalker and Numbers around noon and played leapfrog with a group of five for most of the afternoon. 

At Spivey Gap, trail angel Gapple had set out a big spread of food and chairs. More tired than I had realized, I welcomed the opportunity to sit, eat, and chat. Gapple had taken a six-month leave of absence from his job to thru-hike. He made it only to Neel Gap before injury took him off the trail. He said he was doing trail magic to meet some of the people he would have met on the trail. 

Most of the hikers I had encountered were heading to No Business Knob Shelter for the night. Not wanting to arrive in camp too late, I stopped a few miles short at an unofficial or ""stealth"" campsite. Three of the group I had been leapfrogging, Cheeseball, Roadrunner, and Fox, stopped and introduced themselves before continuing to the shelter. Later, as I was preparing to eat dinner, Baton stopped, looking for a place to hammock. He didn't find anything suitable, but he sat and ate dinner with me. I enjoyed the company and the conversation before he left at 8:00 PM. 

A thought Baton shared with me: Anybody in reasonably good physical shape can hike 15 miles in a day ""off the couch."" But it will leave them sore, and they won't be able to do it again the next day. Of course that's a generalization, but there's an element of truth to it. It helped me realize why 15 miles is my sweet spot now that I'm into my second month on the trail. I felt tired when I reached my campsite today, but I had energy left to set up camp, hang my bear bag, and enjoy dinner with Baton. I certainly could have walked farther today, but those additional activities would have been a burden afterwards.

I was lucky to catch a ride to the Mountain Inn, saving 1.2 miles of roadwalk. 

The usual in-town tasks and a nap filled the afternoon. Later, I met Turbo at the front door. He's been averaging 22 miles/day, injury-free to date! He told me Water was staying here, so I hung out in the lobby at supper time, and sure enough, she came by. We had dinner at the Mexican restaurant next door. Thru-hikers Tabasco and Siesta were there, too, so we socialized a bit after dinner. I'm hoping for a sound sleep tonight.

A great way to start the day! 

The weather was ideal for hiking: mild, dry, and sunny. I felt energized. The trail and scenery were varied...and pretty. It all looked delightful in the sunshine, and I was in a mood to appreciate it. There's nowhere else I would rather have been. 

The trail climbed to Beauty Spot, an open bald with pretty views, dipped down, and then ascended Unaka Mountain before dropping down to Cherry Gap. Although there was considerable elevation gain today, the grade was mostly moderate. 

 

At Indian Grave Gap, roughly the day's halfway point, trail angel (and preacher) Brother Tom provided folding chairs, drinks, and food. I enjoyed a rest, an apple, a coffee, a brownie, and some conversation with other hikers before setting out on the next climb. 

Water must have started after I did because she's been hiking shorter daily distances, and I didn't see her today. Daniel and Firewalker caught up with me at a water source as I was leaving, but I didn't see them after that. I did see Frodo, Clutch, Salt, and their tramily, who also ended their day at Cherry Gap Shelter. Turbo stopped here tonight, too. 

The number of people on trail continues to surprise me. There must be at least two dozen people in or camped near the shelter tonight. The longest stretch of alone time I had on trail was less than 45 minutes.

Rain started falling at 4:00 AM, which meant breaking camp in the rain. By 9:00 it was tapering off. Apart from a few drops, the rain held off for the rest of the day. There was even a little hazy sunshine interspersed with threatening clouds and chilly wind. 

Because I was among the last to leave and I'm among the slowest hikers of the group I'm with, I didn't see as many people today. One, however, solved a mystery. At Tanyard Gap several days ago, I was surprised to see a scooter parked at the trailhead. I was even more surprised to see it again two days later, after the snowfall. Today I met Orange Crush. He has been doing a self-supported hike, positioning his scooter and van at various road crossings along the trail. 

I chose to stop at Ash Gap rather than press on to Roan High Knob Shelter, just two miles ahead. At 6,270 feet, it's the highest shelter on the AT. It's also reputed to be the coldest on the southern half of the trail. Ash Gap is some 800 feet lower and significantly warmer. Many of the people I've been around have been congregating at shelters, so I was surprised to see a dozen tents at Ash Gap when I arrived. People congregated to eat in small groups rather than in a big, noisy crowd. I enjoyed chatting with Clutch, Salt, and Sonar.

Those who continued two miles to Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest on the AT at 6,168' weren't pleased with the cold, dank, and windy conditions. It turned chilly in the Gap, and at one point we were enveloped in a low cloud, but it was more comfortable than up higher. 
It's a short, steep, rocky ascent to the summit, through spruce-fir forest, which I enjoy. Then the trail drops down to Carver's Gap, where several dozen cars were already parked on Easter Sunday morning. The highlight of the day's hike was traversing the Roan Highlands, eight miles of high bads with mesmerizing 360° views. Although the air was hazy, the temperatures were mild, the sun was warm, and the winds were unusually lightI've hiked across Roan Highlands before. The Highlands are always impressive, but in my experience clear skies have been accompanied by fierce, cold, winds. Not today. I could have spent an hour on Big Hump in shorts and a T-shirt. Throughout the day, I stopped, looked around, and took in the beauty. No photo or video could fully capture the grandeur. It seemed appropriate for Easter. 
There's rain in the forecast overnight and all day tomorrow. I debated whether to camp tonight at Doll Flats, a pretty spot at the edge of the balds, or continue down the mountain to a campsite by the road. An encounter with Clutch and Sonar on the trail this afternoon helped me decide. They're camping at Doll Flats while the rest of their tramily are staying at a hostel tonight. I've enjoyed their company, and I elected to camp with them once more before our respective schedules and priorities pull us apart tomorrow. I've enjoyed being a friend of the tramily for the past eight days.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649060,"Yesterday turned out to be the clichéd calm before the storm. It started raining lightly at 7:00 PM, and by 10:30, the wind was howling. I checked my tent stakes and fully hammered in the ones that were protruding at all from the ground. I looked around for rocks, but didn't see any without shining a white light around other tents. My tent fly and liner flapped wildly all night, but all the stakes held. (One was loose by morning; another hour of wind and rain would have pulled it out of the softening ground.) I leaned later that two nearby tents collapsed duri g the night. 
With the flapping fabric, the roar of the wind in the trees, the wind-driven rain drumming on the tent, and worrying about whether the tent would hold up, sleep was elusive. At 5:30, I decided to face the weather. The first problem outside was that the wind had twisted my food bag so tightly that it would go neither up nor down. I finally worked it free with numb fingers (temp in the 30s), and ate four candy bars for breakfast. Cooking oatmeal was unthinkable. I filled my pack as best I could inside the tent. Bringing down the tent and folding it tightly enough to fit in its bag was challenging, too. I was shivering but relieved to start walking downhill. 

My plan for the day was to hike 13 miles with moderate elevation gain. It would have been my easiest day in a while, but I was cold and tired, and the rain showed no sign of letting up. I knew Mountain Harbour Hostel was just off the trail at 19E, so that's where I headed. The owners graciously welcomed hikers who were just seeking temporary refuge from the storm. Aquaman, who had started a SOBO hike on 5 December, regaled us with his stories of hiking the northern mountains in winter. It made me feel weak-willed for seeking shelter from a little rain.

I had planned a zero day today, but I opted to slackpack the miles I omitted yesterday. Roan Mountain B&B owner Steve dropped me off and picked me up. 

Hiking without a backpack felt great! I was able to keep up with all but the fastest young thru-hikers. The weather was cool and crisp, with frost and a few patches of ice on the trail before 10:00. Although it remained cool and breezy all day, the dry air and mostly sunny skies made for pleasant hiking. 

 

The only (minor) downside was a little crowding. Yesterday's terrible weather caused a big surge of hikers to start from the same trailhead this morning. (Several hostels are located here.) I encountered and chatted briefly with Salt, Clutch, Doo-Dah, Tunes, Twister, and Legend, as well as a few others I've met before. 

Steve generously stopped and waited for me to buy a few food items for the next couple days. Back at the B&B, I rinsed and dried my shoes and my tent, laundered my clothes, and showered. Steve drove me to a nearby Mexican restaurant and picked me up after dinner. Back to the trail tomorrow...with a full pack.

Innkeeper Ann, who usually cooks breakfast, was away, and I was the only guest at Roan Mountain B&B last night. Her husband Steve brought out a platter of four eggs, eight strips of bacon, four pieces of fritata, and four biscuits. I didn't leave him any leftovers. 

The AT does not follow a straight line. For most of the day, I walked westward, in the direction opposite to that I walked across Roan Highlands three days ago. It was interesting to have the opportunity to see the peaks I had crossed from a different perspective. Some hikers express frustration at what can be perceived as backtracking. I find it helpful to think of the terms NOBO and SOBO as the concept of following the trail wherever it leads, disassociating them somewhat from north and south. 

Today's weather was great: just below freezing in the morning, rising into the 60s under clear, dry skies. The mass of hikers who had taken refuge from the storm at Highway 19E were ahead of me, so I saw far fewer people today than yesterday. Among those I encountered were Emily and her dog Bouche, whom I had first met just before Hot Springs. She and I hike at a similar pace, so we leapfrogged each other several times. 

The trail was mostly smooth and gently graded, making the miles go by quickly. Laurel Fork and Laurel Falls were the highlights of the day. The river cuts through a pretty gorge with tall, steep walls of rock on either side. Because the falls are close to two road crossings, they attract a lot of day hikers. Even so, it didn't feel crowded. 

 

I had planned to camp at Laurel Fork Shelter, but the shelter sits on a rocky promontory with no flat tenting spots nearby. After confirming this, I kept going. A half mile later, I noticed through the rhododendrons a stealth spot beside the fork. It's just far enough off the trail that most people walking by don't even notice it's there. As I write this, darkness is closing in, and I'm listening to the noise of the rushing water. It's very soothing.

After following the fork downstream for half a mile, the trail ascended a steep wall of the gorge by a series of switchbacks. The gorge wall became the slope of Pond Mountain as it rose above the valley floor. The sound of the water became increasingly faint as I climbed. I had plenty of energy given a good sleep last night, the short hike today, and the anticipation of friends joining me. 

Sleeper, whom I met yesterday, and I leapfrogged each other a few times over the summit. Shortly after starting down the other side of Pond Mountain, Watauga Lake came into view. Like Fontana Lake, Watauga was created by a dam and is used by the TVA for electricity generation. But unlike Fontana, the lake level of Watauga is kept constant so it doesn't have a bathtub ring of treeless shoreline. 

 

Joining me today for a few days as guest hikers or instant tramily will be six backpacking buddies, three of whom have thru-hiked the AT. 

I arrived at Boots Off Hostel shortly after noon. By the time I had checked in and showered, Yardsale and Rambo were arriving in Yardsale's truck. They took me to the Ingles supermarket in Elizabethton for lunch and resupply. 

Later in the afternoon, Rambo and I paddled a canoe on Watauga Lake. Yardsale bravely chose to accompany us on a stand-up paddleboard. (The mountain lake water was cold!) On ome small island, we spotted four geese sitting on their respective nests. On another island, we observed herons coming and going from four or five of their nests in the treetops. Very cool! 

Yardsale cooked burgers on a camp stove as dusk fell. That's when Shoelace's truck arrived, carrying Mr. Bean, Happy Warrior, and Bubba. After eating, the next order of business was to sort out and position vehicles for resupply and hike's end. I had reserved the entire bunkhouse for our group so we could socialize before hitting the trail tomorrow. However, I turned in before the vehicle drivers returned.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649528,"We awoke to a beautiful morning. The forecast is calling for several days of warm, sunny weather. 

Strangely, my hiker hunger was nowhere to be found this morning. I ate a couple pieces of fruit and a half bowl of cereal. I added a Cliff Bar, more because I knew I needed the calories than because I was hungry. 

As usual, it took me longer than most to get packed. I sent the others on their way while I finished, and I followed about 45 minutes later. My stomach was feeling queasy. I figured it was probably a nervous reaction to the excitement of having my new entourage. But as I started walking, the nausea grew worse instead of better. I tried hard to appreciate the beauty of Watauga Lake as the trail wound around the shoreline. 

Four miles in, just before the start of the major climbing, the trail crossed a road to the nearby Wilbur Dam Visitors Center. I was feeling nauseous and fatigued. I sat for a few minutes to rest and gather my thoughts. I was sorely tempted to take the short walk to the Visitors Center and arrange a ride to a motel room with a bed and a flush toilet. But the guys who had come so far to hike with me would have been tremendously let down. And although I felt ""sick,"" I was holding my food in. I pressed on. 

The weather was ideal, and the trail provided a panopoly of views of Watauga Lake. But every time I ate, even a nibble, the nausea returned. Twice today, I was down on the ground on my knees and elbows. The secondary discomfort was glycogen depletion. Carrying a backpack sixteen miles with 4,400' elevation gain is a lot to ask of a body with negligible calorie intake. I bonked. 

One bright spot was at Vanderventer Shelter, roughly the halfway point. I took a 15-minute nap in the shelter, and awoke to the sound of an eastern towhee in the shelter with me. Cute! And as I was getting ready to start moving again, Clutch and Generic came by and did their best to cheer me on. 

The afternoon passed slowly. I eventually stumbled into camp, ate a plain tortilla, and crawled into bed, feeling nauseous again. At one point during the night, I awoke wondering how far from the tent LNT principles would want me to go to puke. Fortunately, I was able to hold it down. 

I wasn't the only one hurting. Happy Warrior's legs cramped badly, and he was in pain for the last few miles. Bubba toughed it out, but he was close to exhaustion. The other three three fared better, but they agreed it was a tough day. I'm just grateful that the weather was nice.

I was still tired, and I really wanted to sleep longer, but there's no better way to be awakened than morning birdsongs. On a pragmatic note, I knew I had miles to cover today, and I knew I'd be walking more slowly than usual. 

I didn't dare drink coffee, but my stomach held down my oatmeal breakfast with only a little upset. My energy level was still low, but I could feel a significant improvement from yesterday. The morning sun heated the air quickly, making today the warmest of my hike to date. The trail took us along a ridgeline all day, which was perfect for catching a gentle breeze on such a warm, sunny day. And the songbirds chirped all day. The birds, perhaps more than anything else, helped me through the day. 

I snacked very lightly, so my muscles were still running mostly on stored fat. There was no spring in my step, but I felt a little more energy than I did yesterday. We all met at Double Spring Shelter, roughly the halfway point, for lunch. After a few bites, I lay down in the shelter while the others ate and chatted. The rest helped me recover some strength, and I felt a little better afterwards. 

Bile burps annoyed me several times. The biggest one came up as I was walking toward Low Gap, about 5 miles before the end of the day's hike. To my surprise, there was a huge trail magic setup at Low Gap (US 421). Powerslide and Lunch, two former thru-hikers from Alabama, had rented a truck, tents, chairs, tables, and a grill. They had purchased and prepared a huge quantity of hiker-favorite food and drinks that they were serving to hikers along with encouragement, camaraderie, and tales from the trail. Normally, I would have consumed 1,000+ calories. But all I wanted was a Gatorade. Powerslide, learning of my upset stomach, suggested a baked potato, which I readily and gratefully accepted. It was the most substantial thing I had eaten since dinner two days ago. And it stayed down! That, plus a half hour sitting in a comfy camp chair, gave me the energy to press on. I was still bonking, but far less than yesterday. 

At camp, after selecting a site, erecting my tent, unpacking my pack, inflating my pad, and throwing a bear line, I ate some couscous for dinner and talked with the guys. Once again, I wasn't the only one who suffered. Bubba said he was so tired he didn't think he could make it to camp...until he stopped and refueled at the trail magic. Happy Warrior's legs were still cramping. Shoelace had developed a big blister on his heel. 

Mr. Bean earned everyone's respect by cowboy camping tonight. Happy Warrior (Bubba's grandfather) earned a new trail name: Crampaw.

I rolled into town at high noon with Freedom and Mr. Bean in tow. Muse wasn't far behind. Yardsale and Rambo had already set up Yardsale's truck for tailgating. Shoelace came in a bit later, followed by Crampaw/Happy Warrior and Bubba. 
Walking into town on a gorgeous spring day put everyone in a good mood. The grass was bright green, the trees had just sprouted leaves, the dogwoods were blooming, and the sky was a cloudless blue. 
At the confluence of the AT and the Virginia Creeper Trail, Damascus calls itself Trail Town USA. The moniker isn't just lip service. Both trails run through, not just near, Damascus and the town's economy is based primarily on the hikers and riders who pass through. At the height of the thru-hiker bubble, backpacks are everywhere, as is the stench of people who've gone days without bathing. The announcement board outside the Baptist Church reads, ""WE LOVE HIKERS."" The town, with a population of less than 1,000, has two hiking-specific outfitters and at least five hiker hostels. 
After everyone had arrived and had a cold drink, Yardsale and Shoelace moved Shoelace's truck up to Damascus. Mr. Bean, Rambo, Bubba, and I walked across town to lunch at Mojo's Trailside Cafe. On the way back, we stopped for ice cream and were intercepted by a member of the Konnarock Trail Crew who insisted on giving us a box of cookies. 
By the time we reached the Damascus Old Mill Inn, Yardsale had returned. He and Rambo had come to the end of their hike and had to leave for their long drive home. (They also drove Freedom, who was taking a couple days off trail to visit family in DC.) I appreciate the support they provided. Yardsale, especially, went out of his way to provide food, drinks, and vehicle shuttles for the whole group. 
After checking in to the Damascus Old Mill Inn, I took a shower and a nap. Later, joined by Crampaw's wife Trish, we went to supper at Wicked Chicken. There were a few small gifts for Bubba, who turns 19 tomorrow. Finally, we said farewell to Crampaw (Happy Warrior), Bubba, and Trish, who will be driving home early tomorrow morning. 
My stomach feels far better than it has in the past three days. But it still isn't completely settled. I'm still having minor symptoms of indigestion, especially after eating. My hiker hunger hasn't returned: I can't eat more than a ""normal"" amount of food. I suspect the distress may have been caused by a minor case of norovirus. The disease had been circulating in the hiker bubble. Freedom reported having similar symptoms. And a woman at our campsite vomited several times last night. If it was norovirus, my symptoms were very mild.

For a short distance NOBO from Damascus, the AT follows the Virginia Creeper Trail, a rails-to-trails conversion that ascends very gradually. The AT then climbs steeply up switchbacks and along ridgelines before descending and rejoining the Creeper Trail some 13 miles later. Shoelace and Mr. Bean opted to walk the Creeper Trail, while I followed the white blazes of the AT. 

 
I felt strong. I didn't push, but the miles passed quickly. Surprisingly, I saw only two other NOBO thru-hikers during the day. There were three or four small groups of dayhikers walking SOBO, but the trail certainly wasn't busy. I appreciated having a little unanticipated solitude.

It rained for only three hours, and the winds remained light. My umbrella served me well, keeping me mostly dry above the waist even with the exertion of hiking. 
The rain had stopped when I reached Lost Mountain Shelter at 4:00. It was one of the earliest finishes of this trip. I set up camp, collected water, and headed to the picnic table for supper.

I left shortly after 8:00, not far behind Shoelace and Mr. Bean. I soon encountered thru-hiker Muse, who had camped a mile or so north of us. Just a couple miles into our hike, we arrived at a wonderful trail magic spread. Fresh fruit, breakfast burritos, and coffee were a welcome treat. Our hosts had set out camp chairs around a nice, warm fire. What a great way to shift our hiking into second gear! 

The trail today took us over Whitetop Mountain, down to Elk Garden, back up to near the summit of Mount Rogers, across the Grayson Highlands, and down to the Wise Shelter area at the northern end of Grayson Highlands State Park. Although there was some haze, the skies were clear, the air was crisp, and the views were inspiring. 

 

The three of us met near Elk Garden, and Mr. Bean walked the remaining nine miles with me. I enjoyed his company, and I was impressed that he was able to match my pace. We saw a few wild ponies. One pony, grazing eight on the trail, didn't even lift its head when we stopped just an arm's length away, photographed it, and talked to it. 

Mr. Bean and Shoelace elected to sleep in Wise Shelter. I usually don't sleep well in a shelter, so I prefer my tent. There's a large, semi-open area near the shelter that looks ideal for tenting. A couple tents were there when I arrived in spite of a ""no camping"" sign. It wasn't clear as to exactly which area was off-limits, so I elected to camp outside the state park, across the creek about 300 yards up the trail. It's a short walk back to the shelter for socializing. As a bonus, my tent is very close to the water, the sound of which will lull me to sleep tonight.

We had a short, unhurried walk in store, so we took our time. The AT did another of its big U-turns, which gave us the opportunity to look up at the ridge line we had walked yesterday. After walking through the windy Scales corral, we left the wild pony habitat for good. 

It was sunny, breezy, and cool most of the day. This morning's footpath was rocky, but it smoothed out later in the day, making the short, mostly downhill, walk go by quickly.

I woke up a few times feeling too hot or too cold. On one such awakening, I heard footsteps climbing up the hill through the woods near us. I thought it was one of the guys, but they both heard the same thing. Was it a deer, a bear? We'll never know. 
We rose before dawn and were on the trail by 7:00. I wanted to get to the post office before it closed at noon today. A resupply box there had chased me to Maine and back. We and our ride arrived at the trailhead early, and I retrieved the well-traveled box. Thanks to the efforts of many people, I now have a lighter-weight sleeping bag, a summer shirt, and more. 
This morning's short hike took us across a ridgeline in light winds, overcast skies, and occasional mist. It rained just enough for me to deploy and stash my umbrella twice. Just before we reached the Pat Jennings Visitor Center (for the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area), we passed through a mile-long rhododendron tunnel. I love rhododendron tunnels, and this was perhaps the longest I've seen. 
Arriving in Marion was bittersweet. As usual when hiking into a town, I looked forward to a hot shower, ""real"" food, and a comfy bed. But this arrival marks the end of hiking with my friends Shoelace and Mr. Bean. There are plenty of other long-distance hikers on the trail, a number of whom I've met and will see again. New acquaintances await, but I'll need to make an emotional adjustment as I transition from the comfort of being in the company of friends. 
Encounter of the day: Hot Rod and Baby Shark are brother and sister, both in their twenties. Baby Shark will be starting law school after their hike. Just three weeks before Baby Shark's planned start date, Hot Rod decided to quit his job to join her on the trail. Their interactions suggest that they're very close.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650035,"Shoelace and Mr. Bean shuttled back to Shoelace's truck in Damascus while I did laundry this morning. They generously returned to Marion and drove me around town to resupply. They also moved me to the General Francis Marion Hotel, an historic downtown property with a surprisingly reasonable hiker rate. After lunch, the time came for them to leave. Saying farewell was surprisingly emotional; I guess I hadn't realized the degree to which I appreciated their companionship. 

This afternoon I wandered through downtown Marion, where most stores and restaurants are closed Sundays. The town boasts more than a few very large homes. Some remain private residences, but many historic residential and commercial buildings have been repurposed. It's refreshing to see the architectural preservation. 

Later, I sorted through what to send home, what to carry, and what to bounce up the trail. By the time I finished, it was dinner time. So goes a zero day.","Marion, VA

I mailed some of my winter stuff (sleeping bag, pants, gloves, etc.) home and sent two bounce boxes forward. It was after 10:00 when the taxi dropped me at the trailhead. The late start caused me some worry, because I had a mileage target to meet: I want to ford Lick Creek tomorrow, before the rainy days forecasted for later in the week. 

The day started with an up-and-down ridge walk on loose rocks. Walking the ridge on a warm, sunny day with a gentle breeze was pleasant. The loose rocks weren't. Eventually, the rocks gave way to a smoother, softer treadway. The trail went across ridge lines, through rhododendron tunnels, across meadows, and, of course, up and down hills. 

I was pleasantly surprised to see Freedom and then Muse this morning. The only other people I saw until mid-afternoon were two SOBOs, Timmy Two-Hat and Smiling Dragon. They're hiking from Harpers Ferry to Springer, so they're at the halfway point of their hike. They told me they had seen 72 NOBOs yesterday. That made me feel very fortunate to have the solitude I did for most of the day today. Apart from a couple of horseback riders at Lindamood School (a preserved 1-room schoolhouse), I didn't see anybody else until the trail reached the highway at Atkins. 

 

Once at the highway, I headed straight for SweetWater Venue (formerly The Barn) for an unhealthy but yummy ""monster sandwich"". Hot Rod and Baby Shark were at a large table of hikers I hadn't met. There was a free seat, so I joined them. 

As I was leaving the restaurant, a group of about nine hikers walked in. At 4:45, I still had seven miles to cover, so I didn't waste any time. I was enjoying a warm spring afternoon on the trail when I crossed a trail maintainer who had just finished clearing his section. We exchanged a few pleasantries, and I thanked him for his work. 

I arrived at the Reed Creek campsite at 7:30, tired but not exhausted. Jukebox, who was part of the large group at the restaurant, had skipped the restaurant meal and was at the campsite when I arrived. He introduced himself, and we chatted for a few minutes. My priorities were to set up camp, eat something, hang my food, and get some water. It was dark by the time I finished, and it's now time for sleep.

In denial, I let it fester too long before applying Leukotape this afternoon. I'll go back to double socks (socks over Injinji toe sock liners) tomorrow. I think this one is going to be sore for a while. 

Today was mostly sunny, humid, and quite warm, probably the hottest day of my hike to date. My new sun shirt performed well. I managed water and electrolyte input carefully, but I still felt drained by day's end. It took almost a dozen attempts to throw the bear line over the branch I'd selected. 

The trail showed its nice side. I followed ridge lines, stabbed across mountain sides, and climbed through open meadows. The treadway was most smooth, dry dirt, with only a few rocky sections. 

A short detour at mid-day took me to Bear Garden Hiker Hostel, where Legend was taking a zero, reading a book in the shade. The reason for my visit was the freezer, which was stocked with ice cream treats sold on the honor system. I noticed an old scale in the bunkhouse, so I weighed myself. If the scale is accurate, I've lost 8 pounds since I started. Some weight loss undoubtedly occurred while I was hiking without eating, but the total amount surprises me. 

For a week, I've been planning my crossing of Lick Creek. The substantial footbridge that crossed the creek was washed away by a storm a couple years ago. In March 2020, Neon, Shoelace, and I chose a long roadwalk to avoid the dangerous, chest-deep ford. Today, the crossing was easy-peasy, barely ankle deep. Still, I'm glad I forded it before the rains predicted for later this week. 

The big tramily left camp before I did this morning. They're heading for Chestnut Knob Shelter, three miles beyond my campsite. Most of my hiking time was in solitude. I wasn't completely alone, as there were hikers at the usual places: shelters, the hostel, and the creek crossing. For the only the third time since I rejoined the AT, I'm alone at my campsite tonight. 

 

Encounter of the day: I leapfrogged Aqua, A Lotta (""a lotta this, a lotta that""), and Maggie. A Lotta is Maggie's adult daughter. They started at Amicalola just three days before I did.

* * * ""MISSING"" JOURNAL ENTRIES * * * I write a journal entry for each day of my hike, but sometimes a day's post doesn't appear until much later. (The 26 April entry is a case in point.) While I'm on trail, I send each entry by email when I get a cellular connection (usually from the side of the trail on or near the top of a mountain, with my pack on). An automated system converts my emails to journal postings. Sometimes, for reasons I don't fully understand, the conversions don't happen.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650329,"The highlight of the day was peering down into Burke Garden from various points around the perimeter. Burke Garden is an almost surreal, bucolic valley completely encircled by mountains. Roughly 8 miles by 4 miles, it looks like an impact crater, but it's actually a big sinkhole. 

It was very mild overnight. Rumbles of thunder at dusk didn't result in anything more than a few drops of rain before midnight. Today was warm and mostly sunny, with a cooling breeze along the ridge line that I followed most of the day. 

Starting four miles south of Chestnut Knob Shelter and two miles south of the popular camping area at ""the pond"", I didn't see too many hikers today. Ten miles in, at VA 623, I was surprised to come across trail magic. A former thru-hiker was offering irresistible treats. I sat and consumed an orange, a fruit cup, some salad, veggie crisps, and a beer. The pause and refreshment added some needed energy to my step. 

Near Jenkins Shelter in Hunting Camp Creek Wilderness, I caught up with Maggie, A Lotta, and Aqua. We stopped and chatted at the top of a hill, and we camped together with four other hikers at a nice spot by a stream. It even had a picnic table. 

 

Blister update: In Marion, I inadvertently put my trail runner insoles in the dryer. They came out three sizes smaller, so I replaced them with a pair of Dr. Scholl's. The new insoles are significantly thicker than the originals, and they were pushing my toes up into the toe box of my shoes. Making matters worse, my sloppy trimming job had left a sharp corner of insole poking into my left big toe. I trimmed the insoles this morning, and that improved the situation. I still have the big blister, but it was less painful today. I ordered a pair of new, thinner, insoles to be delivered to Pearisburg.

I slept in later than usual this morning, too, not waking until after 7:00, about an hour later than usual. True to form, I was the last one out of camp. 

I chatted a few times with Dennis and Theresa, a sixty-something couple from Mesa, AZ. They were also slow leaving camp, and we leapfrogged while hiking. 

A bit cooler than yesterday morning, just under 50 degrees F, the sun quickly warmed the air. The sky was unusually clear, making for a truly beautiful morning. The walk was easy on the feet, mostly compacted dirt, and not too steep. My blister is still bothering me, but it seems to be healing slowly. The terrain was kind to my Achilles, too. I made good time on the short hike, arriving at Brushy Mountain Outpost before 11:30--just in time for lunch. The only veggies in the restaurant were the lettuce and tomato on my cheeseburger. (Thanks to my dietician for suggesting that I check the cooler for a V8. Bingo!) The double scoop of ice cream was the biggest I've ever seen, and I had no trouble finishing it.

Shuttle driver Bubba was only a few minutes late taking me to Big Walker Motel. My room is quite nice in spite of some dated touches. There's a 2500 touch-tone phone and even a phone book. The manager apologized for not having a guest laundry, but she gave me a cup of detergent, pointed me to a wash tub out back, and told me I could hang up my clothes in the sun wherever I wanted. I emptied the wash water several times before it became nearly clear.Later, while my clothes were drying in the sun, I visited the Dollar General to resupply and bought a veggie sub at Subway for dinner.

Bubba the shuttle driver told me he usually parks in front of the Big Walker Motel in the morning. I thought this was strange until I learned that Bubba's wife runs the motel. I also learned that the couple keep a pet 400-pound pot-bellied pig in their house. 
Bubba drove Don't Stop and me to the trailhead, where I met a hiking goat and her human. They're hiking a short segment on the AT as part of a hike across America. 
It had rained overnight, and the morning was dreary. The forecast called for more rain through the day. Fortunately, the rain held off until 2:00 PM. It rained lightly for an hour or two, and then the sky partially cleared and the sun shone through. The break in the weather combined with the promise of more rain to follow helped increase my pace. I chatted briefly with Wreck It and stopped for a few minutes' rest at Jenny Knob Shelter, but otherwise I kept moving. 

 
Although I knew the rooms and bunks were completely sold out, I decided to head for Weary Feet Hostel. The hostel has a tenting area, showers, a cooked dinner, and a dry place to hang out. As I was walking from the trailhead toward the hostel, a car slowed and a voice called, ""Hey KJ!""  In the car were A Lotta, Aqua, Maggie, and Maggie's husband John. John was driving them to a hotel, and they just happened to be on the same road. I crowded into the back seat, and they drove me to the front door of the hostel. 
Dinner was served at 6:15, which gave me just enough time to check in and pitch my tent. It started to rain. Hard. With thunder and lightning. And a tornado warning. We hikers were too focused on eating to take cover immediately, and fortunately there was no tornado. But it was a violent storm, and I'm glad I was in a sturdy building. 
I was able to shower after dinner, which felt wonderful. There was a long queue of clothes bags for the single washing machine, so I skipped laundry and headed for my tent during a lull in the rain. It's raining hard again as I write this, accompanied by thunder and lightning. I'm grateful to be dry, warm, fed, and snug in my sleeping bag.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find my waterproof shell mittens this morning. After searching thoroughly, twice, I concluded that I must have dropped them when I got into the car last night. 

After a delicious cooked breakfast of eggs, sausage, and pancakes, I headed out at 9:00 under mist and drizzle. The trail followed rain-swollen Dismal Creek for several miles. I made a 0.6-mile (round trip) detour to Dismal Falls, which didn't seem as pretty as I remembered them from a visit on a sunny day five years ago. Nevertheless, I enjoyed spending a few minutes alone there. (It's a popular spot on nice days.) I also took pleasure from hearing and seeing the creek as the trail followed it for several miles. 

 

Dennis and Theresa surprised me when they came around a corner in the opposite direction. They were slackpacking back toward Kimberling Creek. We stopped and chatted for a few minutes. 

I detoured into Wapati Shelter for a sit-down lunch and a short rest. To my surprise, a dozen or more hikers were already stopped there; all had stayed at Weary Feet Hostel last night. It's ironic that the wilderness can seem so crowded at times. 

Light precipitation became steady rain shortly after lunch. The temperature dropped as the rain intensified through the afternoon. I had intended to collect water at Doc's Knob Shelter, perhaps eat supper there, and camp a little farther up the trail. But I was cold by the time I arrived, it was raining hard, and there was an empty spot in the shelter (between Scenic and Moon). The other hikers were chill and welcoming. I unpacked my sleeping bag and snuggled in. This is my first night in a shelter in nearly a month. I'm grateful to have shelter and good company.

It was an easy, mostly downhill, trek into Pearisburg. I left shortly after Scenic, Moon, Mud, and Firebeard, and we met up a few times along the way. We started in a cloud that made it feel almost as if it was raining. Water was running down the trail. I just sloshed through the streams and puddles since my feet couldn't get any wetter or much colder. As the morning progressed, the cloud layer lifted, and it began to feel warmer. It was actually pleasant, if cloudy, by the time we reached Angel's Rest, a boulder that overlooks Pearisburg and the surrounding valley.

After a newly-constructed section of trail through the woods, the AT crosses the New River on a sidewalk along US 460, a 4-lane freeway, and passes a huge Celanese Corporation plant. The trail also skirts the Giles County landfill as it climbs out of the New River Valley. Only after seven miles of hiking did the sights and sounds of Pearisburg finally fade away. 

The long, gradual climb to the ridgeline was punctuated by the sighting of a huge black snake basking in the sun on Hemlock Ridge. It was stretched out enough for me to estimate that it was about six feet long. Although black snakes are generally harmless to humans, it was lying partially across the trail, and I didn't want to step too close to its mouth. A very gentle nudge with a trekking pole convinced it to slowly move away.

 
I saw fewer people today than usual. One of the first was Mischief, who was slackpacking SOBO. Both of Mischief's feet are amputated just in front of the heel. He hikes wearing prosthetics that need to be removed and repositioned every few miles. When I'm feeling sorry for myself because my hike is tough, I look to hikers like Mischief for inspiration.

To my surprise, I caught up with Maggie, A Lotta, and Aqua before lunch. At the top of the climb, we enjoyed a lunch break together at Rice Field Shelter. From there, the trail follows the Virginia-West Virginia border along the highest ridgeline. Above 3,000 feet, it's still early spring, with a profusion of wildflowers in bloom and the trees just starting to unfurl their leaves.

Maggie, A Lotta, and Aqua had camped less than a mile beyond me. They also got a late start, and we met a couple times during the day. 

The morning's hike was an easy downhill followed by a mostly gentle walk along Peter's Creek. Then things got serious. Just before lunch was a steep 1.5-mile climb. That was followed by two miles of walking on sharp rocks, some stable, some not--a preview of Pennsylvania, I've been told. I rolled both ankles more than once, and my Achilles tendinitis flared up. The last couple miles downhill provided some relief before day's end. 

Challenge of the day: Cheese Ball challenged herself to live up to her trail name. She's been carrying a giant canister of Cheese Balls from Pearisburg. Today she set about eating them all in one day. She started enthusiastically and with some fanfare at our campsite this morning. The next time I saw her was at War Spur Shelter, some 16 miles later.

With only a third of the day's distance hiked, I increased my pace after lunch. Double Check (whom I met at dinner in Pearisburg) and I leapfrogged each other the rest of the day. The trail made its way across a couple miles of cow pasture, providing some wide-open views that aren't very common on the AT. Later, as it climbed some steep, rocky terrain to the Eastern Continental Divide atop Sinking Creek Mountain, I was thrilled to see stone steps instead of a rock jumble. Double Check and I marveled at the amount of work it must have taken to build the steps from huge rocks. 
From a viewpoint on the mountain, I could see rain coming. The wind on the ridgetop made it feel like heavier rain than the light drizzle it was. I put on my rain jacket and gloves.

Trail Days began today in Damascus, so there were fewer hikers on trail than usual. I saw only three others all day until I encountered a few day hikers near Dragon's Tooth late this afternoon.
The first part of the day's hike was typical of this part of Virginia. The mountains are shaped like corn rows, so the trail climbs 1,000-2,000 feet to the ridge, follows the ridgeline, and then descends, typically to a river or stream valley. This repeats every five to ten miles. Dragon's Tooth is a different story. The climb up the south side is rocky and steep, requiring an occasional hand assist. The climb down the north side is tougher, involving the first real scrambling on the AT. Muddy shoes on wet rocks made it challenging. Even with sharp concentration on every footstep, I slipped a few times. A skid very close the edge of a 10-foot drop-off rattled me. I was exhausted by the time I reached the hostel shortly after 5:00.
Four Pines isn't the nicest hostel on the trail. It's a big garage with a single toilet and shower. The army surplus cots that were here a few years ago have been replaced by rudimentary bunks with plastic-wrapped mattresses, which is a big improvement. I learned, however, that the bunks aren't equally sturdy. All the lower bunks were taken by the time I arrived. The upper bunk on the third one I tried wasn't too wobbly. At 6:00 PM, the caretaker drove several us to the nearby gas station/convenience store to buy pizza and rudimentary resupplies. Back at the hostel, the dining table was cluttered and filthy...even by hiker standards. 
Just before hiker midnight, the proprietress did a single big load of laundry for everybody who put their clothes in a designated bin. When she returned the bin of clean clothes, we learned that many of us wear similar socks!

Four Pines Hostel has a reputation for being a party place. Yet among the 15 hikers who stayed last night, I didn't smell any weed or even see anyone drinking a beer. Several signs proclaim that 10:00 PM is lights out time. At 9:15, someone asked whether it would be OK to turn out the lights early. Among those still awake, there were no objections. 
I was one of the first ones to leave the hostel this morning. The day started foggy and very mild, and it remained humid all day. After a few miles in the woods, the trail emerged onto cow pastures. Most of the cows ignored me, even when I spoke to them. But a couple were curious enough to approach me. 

After another short section of woods, the trail dumped me into the big, busy parking lot for McAfee Knob day hikers. It was nearly full on this Saturday in spite of the iffy weather. As I climbed toward the iconic knob, it started to rain. On the 4-mile ascent, I passed six day hikers going up, and I crossed nearly 40 going down. I was surprised to find the rock outcrop was deserted when I arrived. Eventually, a weekend backpacker from Fuquay-Varina arrived and took the requisite photo of me standing far from the edge. 

 

Several miles--and hours--later, Tinker Cliffs provided better views. The trail goes perilously close to the cliff edge, and I took pride in following it instead of taking the ""sissy trail"" farther back from the cliffs. 

Through the afternoon, the weather varied from warm and sunny to cool, breezy, and threatening. I heard thunder, and I saw what looked like heavy rain ahead, but it didn't rain on me. In fact, the sun was shining when I arrived at Lambert's Meadow campsite at 5:30. There are only three other tents in a very spread-out area, so I'm essentially alone on a flat spot beside a babbling brook. Nice! 

Food note: Tonight I added freeze-dried spinach from Packit Gourmet to Alpine Aire Grilled Chicken with Spinach Alfredo Pasta. The extra spinach made it taste yummy. It might be a while before I have these two ingredients on hand simultaneously again, but the combination is worth noting.

I walked for a while with Double Check and Birthday Sandwich, but the effort required to keep up with them was detracting from my enjoyment of the day, so I fell behind. They were in sight up the road when I reached the trailhead in Daleville, so I followed them to Three Little Pigs, a busy BBQ restaurant. Other hikers joined us, and we swapped stories at an outdoor table of seven. Nobody minded the slow lunch service because the weather was pleasant and the company was fun. 

 

After a long, leisurely lunch, I bought groceries, checked into the Super 8, showered, laundered, and took a nap. Then it was time for dinner at the Mexican restaurant next door, where I met Dennis and Teresa. Hiker midnight was upon us before I knew it. 

Quip of the day: Thru-hiker Birthday Sandwich remarked, ""You know those signs that say, 'Please shower before entering hot tub?' Those are meant for us hikers.""

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651213,"Today, for the first stile on this hike, I slackpacked SOBO, or ""backwards"". I'm due for a zero day tomorrow, so I left most of my gear at the motel in Daleville, shuttled north, and hiked back to town. 
The day dawned sunny and very humid, with rain in the forecast. Shortly after I greased up with sunscreen and started walking, clouds started to roll in, the sky turned grey, and the wind picked up. It rained lightly for a half hour around 11:00, but that was all the rain that fell. Hot, humid sunshine alternated with cool, grey, windy conditions for the rest of the day.
The scenery was pretty, with rhododendrons and wildflowers in full bloom along much of the trail. The going was mostly easy. Grades were gradual, and there weren't too many obstacles on the trail. I was grateful for that because I hadn't slept well, and I felt tired all day. When I got to my room, it took effort just to undress and step into the shower.  

 
Two things surprised me today. First, I crossed about 25 NOBO hikers. Recently, SOBO hikers have told me they were seeing two to three times that many NOBOs per day. Second, I expected to encounter NOBO hikers I knew who were a bit ahead of me or a little behind me. I didn't. 
Encounter of the day: My shuttle driver Homer Witcher thru-hiked with his wife and two then-young children in 2001. A retired hospital laboratory director, he's been doing trail maintenance for 38 years. He had a date with his wife for this afternoon to slide a mouldering privy onto the empty crib. (See https://appalachiantrail.org/official-blog/its-a-dirty-job-partnering-for-privy-construction/) That's not an easy task, and he's 80 years old.

A few of my trail buddies appeared. Midnight Maggie, A Lotta, and Aqua were in the Kroger parking lot. Fox and Cheese Ball were outside the Mexican restaurant. I stopped and chatted for a few minutes with each group.
At dinner, a pesky hornet was trying to drink from beer glass. I was looking forward to the last few sips when the hornet slipped from the rim and landed in the beer at the bottom. At first I was annoyed that it had spoiled my beer, but I quickly realized that its evening was turning out far worse than mine. 

 

I've spent two nights at the Super 8. Although I've laundered all my clothes and soaked my pack in the bathtub, the room reeks of hiker funk. The housekeeper came in to service the room this morning (an unexpected service). She didn't make a face or wrinkle her nose. I'll leave a good tip for putting up with my stench and getting rid of it after I check out tomorrow.

She quickly agreed to stop at the nearby Kroger so I could buy a tube of sunscreen. During the ride, we talked at length about privy design and maintenance, a topic only hikers are likely to enjoy. 

As I was preparing to start hiking, Double Check and Breakfast Sandwich walked by. We chatted for just a few minutes before they continued on. I didn't see them again today. In fact, I saw only a few other hikers. At Cornelius Creek Shelter, Spooky seemed quite happy to see me. She was glad to have company, as no other hikers were around. 

The trail surface was mostly smooth, allowing me to make good time most of the day. Only the final climb was difficult: half of the day's vertical gain came in the last quarter of the day's miles. I was glad to see the shelter. 

Once I arrived, fortune smiled on me three times. Nobody else was tenting, so I had my choice of tentsite. I threw my bear line accurately on the first attempt. And a trail angel had left three beers cooling in the creek. It's a rare treat to have a cold beer with dinner while on the trail.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651394,"Titanium, age 78, has been doing an assisted thru-hike. A friend drives her to a trailhead, Titanium slackpacks (carries only a daypack) to another pre-arranged trailhead, and the friend drives them both to a local motel for the night. I've seen Titanium in different places each of the last five days. We've always had a few words to say to each other. 

This morning on Apple Orchard Mountain I thought I heard her voice in distress just ahead. As I came around a corner, I found her lying in a tiny gully, head downhill, feet pointing up toward the trail. She told me her bad knee had given out (""It happens sometimes.""), and she had taken a tumble. I dropped my pack and poles, and I clambered down into the tight space beside her. She asked me to help her get onto her knees so she could get up. I extended a hand, but her body hardly budged when we both pulled. I realized she was still entangled in her pack straps, so I pulled the pack off her and moved it out of the way. 

Angling myself behind her, I lifted her by the armpits to a kneeling position. She was deadweight. Her left leg was twisted into an awkward position, so I helped her reposition it. It didn't seem to hurt her, but she wasn't offering much help. By then, I was noticing some cognitive impairment. I tried one more time to lift her to her feet. Again, she was deadweight, not seeming to make any effort to get her feet under her. I half-carried, half-dragged her up to the trail and laid her down on her back on top of her folding pad. I knew she would need to be carried out. 

Once she was comfortable, I called 911. It took a while to figure out my call had been routed to the wrong PSAP. (""What's the street address of your location? What county are you in? Where is your car parked?"") After some insistence, the operator finally entered the lat-lon coordinates I gave her into a mapping program and determined that I was indeed in a different county. She tried to transfer me to the adjacent county's PSAP, but that failed. She assured me that she'd pass along the information and that someone would call me back. 

Soon after, a couple of day hikers appeared. I told them what I knew and encouraged them to continue on their hike. But day hiker Trish worked with seniors and felt she might be able to help. While she went about comforting Titanium, I noticed a group of eight or nine day hikers approaching. From passing them earlier, I knew they were slow-moving and chatty. I took a few steps toward them, and in my most authoritative voice, I told them EMS was on the way and urged them to walk past quickly without stopping. 
I called 911 to get an update because I hadn't received a return call or a text message. While I was busying myself with these activities, Trish noticed something I had missed. Titanium had lost control of the entire left side of her body, not just her leg. Even her smile was crooked. How had I not noticed this? 

The likelihood that this was a stroke and not a leg injury added urgency to the situation. I went back to the 911 run-around. This time, the Botetourt County  operator wanted to know why I hadn't spoken with the Bedford County PSAP. My temper barely in check, I told him he was wasting time while I was trying to get help quickly for a stroke victim. He was able to transfer me to the correct PSAP in Bedford County. Neither PSAP operator seemed to be inclined to change the report from ""broken leg"" to ""stroke"", but I did get a confirmation that first responders were on the way and from where they'd be coming.

The SAR team was great. Two Bedford County firefighters arrived first, quickly checked Titanium, concluded it was indeed a stroke, and radioed their colleagues. I wasn't paying close attention, but it seemed to me that only after the radio call did the rest of the crew start bringing the stokes basket from the trailhead. (My impression was that the first responders were expecting a leg injury, not a stroke.) We waited nearby until Titanium was in the basket being transported up the trail to the ambulance. I wished her well as I passed, but her eyes were closed, and she showed no sign of having heard me. 
A while later, we caught up with the large group of day hikers. Trish and I filled them in on what they had seen and thanked them for moving through quickly. 

 

I'll have more thoughts about this incident in the days to come, but tomorrow we'll return to hiking stories.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651465,"Last night's campsite worked out well. It was on a ridge, so it caught a hint of a breeze. Almost as soon as I turned in for the night, a thunderstorm started. It didn't last long, so it didn't keep me awake too late. This morning the temperature was still warm, but the wind had picked up, and I put on my rain jacket as a windbreaker. 

 

I packed up quickly (for me) and walked down 0.7 mile to Matts Creek Shelter to eat breakfast at the picnic table and use the privy. There were only three hikers left from the half-dozen who had overnighted there. I didn't see many hikers on trail today, either. I know there are crowds of thru-hikers just ahead of and just behind me; I seem to be in some sort of lull. No complaints about that! 

For the first hour and a half, I enjoyed walking along the James River and its tributaries. James River Face Wilderness boasts one of the prettiest displays of blossoming rhododendrons I've seen. Crossing the James felt like a meaningful milestone, just as crossing the Potomac, the Delaware, and the Hudson will. Unlike those rivers farther north, the AT crosses the James on a 1,000-foot-long footbridge. 

The serious work stated mid-morning with a 2,000-foot climb to Big Rocky Row. Then the trail went up and down along the ridgeline. The temperature didn't help. It reached into the 90s at rover level, well into the 80s on the summits. The hike also required a ten-mile water carry, so my pack was weighted down with eight pounds of water. The hike was undeniably pretty, with some beautiful, if hazy, views of the river valley and surrounding mountains. The heat took a lot out of me, so the distance and elevation gain felt longer than they were. 

I had been planning to stop and spend the night at Punchbowl Shelter. But I was immediately turned off. The tentsites were all sloped. The water source marked ""spring"" is actually the outflow from a stagnant pond. Said stagnant pond seems to be a breeding ground for pesky biting insects. And there wasn't a breath of wind. The shelter and its surroundings might provide a pleasant stay on a blustery winter day, but not today. I pressed on. 

Finally, at AT mile 800, I found an available campsite on a saddle ridge. In cold, stormy weather I hate camping on a saddle ridge. But on this hot, sticky night, the breeze feels wonderful. 

People encountered: Will was at the shelter this morning, and he passed by my tentsite this evening. Amber and I leapfrogged each other climbing up fron James River, but I haven't seen her since. Two Hats, a NOBO thru-hiker, was slackpacking SOBO today. Tortoise and Hare, whom I had seen but not talked to in Daleville, had pitched their tent on my first choice stealth spot for tonight.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651518,"In addition to always-annoying whippoorwills, there were several four-legged visitors near my campsite overnight. The deer were easy to identify by sound, but there was at least one other creature, much less skittish. It was just far enough away that I wasn't able to see it by headlamp, but I suspect it was a black bear. It, or something that sounded like it, made a second visit later. My food was secured by a textbook PCT hang about 100 yards up the trail, so I wasn't worried about that. 

Yesterday's heat and humidity continued into today. Trying to beat the worst of it, I started today's relatively short walk before 8:00. Tortoise and Hare, who had camped a mile south of me, caught me at a spring where I was collecting water. They walked ""with"" me for a couple of hours. Tortoise always seemed to be 25-50 yards behind me. She didn't want to pass, but she didn't fall very far behind, even when I pushed the pace up a hill. 

We eventually split up when Tortoise and Hare took a longer break than I at a water source. It being a sunny Saturday, some day hikers were out, but I didn't see any other long-distance hikers on the trail. I did cross an ATC Ridgerunner named Flossie; she's the first Ridgerunner I've seen on this hike. 

About a mile from the end of today's walk, a day hiker told me there was trail magic at the trailhead. I left my intended snack in my pocket and picked up speed. Bumpah and a half-dozen friends had put out a big spread, including cold drinks, hot dogs, watermelon, chips, and homemade cookies. I indulged while sitting in the shade waiting for my shuttle. Eventually, Bumpah drove Easy Day and me to the Budget Inn. (I texted my shuttle driver so he wouldn't make the trip.) 

The gas station across the street had very limited offerings, and the Family Dollar within walking distance had closed early due to a staff shortage. My shuttle driver, who also works at the motel, wasn't available. Two other hikers outside the Family Dollar told me that a trail angel had offered to drive them to Food Lion, nearly two miles away. Two other hikers joined us, and the five of us sat on the floor in the back of a semi-converted Sprinter van for the trip to the supermarket. The trail angel happily waited for us to buy what we needed, and then he drove us back to the motel. I'm grateful that my diet for the next five days won't be limited to Snickers and Pop-Tarts.

We pulled into traffic at 7:29. Easy Day rode with me to the trailhead. We leapfrogged each other once, and I didn't see him after he pulled ahead. 

The day started warm and humid. In the sun, it was hot. At Hog Pen Gap just before noon, I discovered trail magic. A trail angel had left juice boxes (still cool), cookies, and a trash bag. A few yards beyond the road, thru-hikers Splitsy and Genie were treating water from a nearby spring. The heat wasn't providing much incentive to move, so we talked in the shade for a while. 

Other than some day hikers around Cole Mountain and a few SOBO slackpackers, I didn't see many people on trail. Late in the afternoon, a NOBO section hiker told me the forecast was for thunderstorms between 5:00 and 7:00 PM. Initially, I had planned to camp at Crabtree Creek, three miles beyond Spy Rock. At 4:00, it was sunny and hot. But the weather took a quick turn, with clouds, increasing winds, darkening skies, and thunder coming in quick succession. I altered my plans and pushed hard, trying to get to the campsite at Spy Rock before the approaching storm. 

I made it, but not quite in time. Just as I crested the hill and came around the corner into the tenting area, the rain started. Not slowly, but all at once. By the time my tent was up, I was drenched. Splitsy and Genie also arrived while I was setting up. Grateful for having a large tent, I unpacked my backpack under cover from the rain and changed into my dry sleeping clothes. 

 

An hour after it started, the rain tapered off. I threw a bear line and ate supper. Two more thru-hikers arrived after I had eaten, and the five of us climbed to the top of the  Spy Rock monolith. It was cool and breezy, but the views were gorgeous. The interplay of sun and clouds put on a show before sunset. We spent nearly an hour taking it all in before the sun disappeared behind a bank of thick clouds before dropping below the horizon. The thunderstorm turned out to be a blessing: if it hadn't hit when it did, I would have continued to the next campsite and missed the delightful hour on the rock. 

Puzzling to all of us were the tadpoles. There are a few small puddles atop Spy Rock, each teeming with hundreds, if not thousands, of tadpoles. Each puddle contained tadpoles of a different size. How did they get here? What happens when the puddles dry up? How many of them survive to adulthood?

There wasn't much of a sunrise, but a haze-shrouded sun appeared for a couple hours early this morning. By 8:00, it had clouded over completely. I'm grateful I had the opportunity to experience Spy Rock's charm last evening. 

The Priest is a mountain named after a rock formation that, using some imagination, looks like a priest kneeling in prayer. There's an eponymous shelter near the summit. A longstanding tradition is for thru-hikers to confess their sins of the trail in The Priest Shelter logbook. Some are quite humorous. Many involve toileting. My confession? That's between me and The Priest. You'll need to go read it for yourself. 

Just beyond the shelter, the summit of The Priest was in a cloud, so there were no views. Nor were there many people. I walked alone for four hours this morning before seeing the first day hikers. 

There was trail magic in the form of chilled Gatorade at the VA 56 road crossing. It was well-placed, at the foot of the 3,500-foot climb up Three Ridges Mountain.

 
Shortly after noon, half an hour into the climb, it started to rain. It rained all afternoon and into the evening. As of this writing at 8:30 PM, it's still raining. My umbrella proved its worth today, by making an otherwise-miserable situation tolerable. It's too warm for a rain jacket and too cold to just get wet. With the umbrella attached to my pack strap, my sleeves rolled up, and Gore-Tex shell mittens on my hands, I was as comfortable as can be in an all-day rain. 

I was tempted to sleep in the shelter tonight. When I arrived at 6:00, Tortoise and Hare were inside, along with a hiker named Richard. After eating supper at the shelter, I decided to tent. I'll sleep better tonight, but I may regret having to pack up in the rain tomorrow morning. 

Milestone: The Priest was the last time I'll be higher than 4,000 feet elevation until I reach Vermont late this summer. The big climbs have been arduous at times, but it's been fun to see seasons change in a single day.

There was a rivulet running under it. Lesson learned: choose my tent spot more carefully. There were a half dozen better locations nearby. 

Convincing myself to get up and get out wasn't easy, but I finally hit the trail at 9:00. I was in a low cloud all day. Rain alternated with drizzle and mist, but it didn't stop. A result of the wet weather was fewer hikers on trail. I saw nobody at all until two young thru-hikers passed me in the afternoon. 

Today's section of trail is tougher than it would appear from the distance and elevation numbers. Much of it is on sharp angular rocks, making it stressful on the feet and ankles. I've done it twice before, and I recall having very sore feet both times. Today, I took my time and paid close attention to foot placement. It was painstaking, and I feel tired, but my feet don't hurt. 
Near Wintergreen View--where there was certainly no view today--I paused at some boulders at what would have been an overlook on a clear day. I watched as a big black bird flew up out of the mist and landed on a rocky outcrop very close to me. I quickly took a photo. The bird spread its wings, and I expected it to fly away. But it was just airing its wings, probably trying to dry them out. It repeated the action a few more times, seemingly unconcerned by my presence. After a short while, I slowly moved away, leaving the big bird to its own habitat. It belongs there; I was just an interloper, grateful that it was willing to share the space with me for a few minutes. Moments like these are ones that I'll remember for a long time after the hike ends.

 

Paul Wolfe Shelter, a big double-decker with sheltered picnic table, was empty when I arrived at 6:00. Pellet, a section hiker I had met briefly the day before yesterday, arrived shortly after. Given the empty trails, it seemed unlikely the shelter would fill up. We each claimed a spot on the upper level. 

Pellet and I had crawled into our sleeping bags when Class of 2021 thru-hikers Ike and Two-Tone arrived carrying trail magic: beer and hot dogs. Pellet and I each accepted a good-night beer, but it was late for hot dogs. I was impressed by how skilfully Two-Tone lit and tended a fire in the rain.

I set up my tent in heavy mist and ate supper in drizzle. As I write this at 8:00, it's raining. My shoes and socks are wet, my clothes are damp, the skin is peeling off my feet, and my tent smells like stinky wet socks. Adding insult to injury, there was no mention of rain in the day's weather forecast as of this morning. Yet water has been precipitating from the sky for the past six hours. For me, the most difficult part of this adventure has been accepting things as they are, without wishing they were different. I'm still working on that. 

A number of hikers were on trail this morning, but their numbers dropped as the weather turned. Perhaps five or six were thru-hikers. I expected to see more thru-hikers, especially in Shenandoah National Park north of Rockfish Gap and Waynesboro. No complaints about that: I prefer solitude when I'm in the wilderness.

Our objective was to car camp and do some day hiking. Joanne had kindly offered to dovetail those plans with my AT trail miles. It being a beautiful Saturday on Memorial Day weekend, we were concerned that we might not find an available campsite in the popular national park. Driving up Skyline Drive, we noticed every parking lot was full, with parked cars spilling out of the lots onto the road shoulder. We arrived at Loft Mountain Campground, the largest in the park, just after checkout time at noon. To our very happy surprise, there were sites available! We found a nice one at the edge of the campground, with some privacy and its own 100' informal connector trail to the AT. 

 

We ate lunch at the campsite picnic table, and then we set out on an out-and-back walk. Coming across a non-skittish deer added a wildlife highlight. We also encountered, and chatted briefly with, thru-hiker Daniel.

It's Memorial Day. We took a few minutes during our walk together to reflect on the meaning of Memorial Day. Although the connection is indirect, it's a reminder that people have given their lives so that I may enjoy what I often take for granted.

It was sunny and the temperature soon rose, reaching into the 80s. That's hot for hiking! I'm a little surprised that I walked as far and as fast as I did. 

At Smith Roach Gap this afternoon, thru-hiker Scout waved me toward the parking lot, just off the trail. As I approached, I recognized a familiar van: it was Miss Janet. Miss Janet may be the most famous trail angel on the AT. Every year, she follows the thru-hiker bubble from Georgia to Maine, offering drinks, snacks, advice, and encouragement. Today, she also had some sad news to share. She told Scout, Black Hole, and me that yesterday, a young backpacker (not a thru-hiker) had fallen to his death from McAfee Knob. 

Later in the afternoon, I refilled my catch bag from an unmapped spring on the flank of Baldface Mountain. There was an unoccupied stealth site nearby, and that's where I set up camp.

 Emerging from Pinefield Hut, Olivia surmised that Joanne was a thru-hiker, given her physique.Scout and Bandana Dan leapfrogged with me a few times. Black Hole, whom I met yesterday, leapfrogged me through the day. We seem to be hiking at roughly the same pace.Daniel, whom I had met south of Hot Springs, is now hiking with Sunny and Blue. He told me that Firewalker and Numbers are well ahead of us.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652342,"Today felt even hotter than yesterday, perhaps because there were fewer clouds and less wind. My day started with a slightly upset stomach, so I avoided my usual morning coffee. That got me off to a slower start. Almost immediately, hikers started passing me. As if seeing Miss Janet yesterday wasn't enough, the number of thru-hikers I encountered today confirmed that I'm in the bubble. The reprieve around Trail Days has ended. 
Mid-morning, I stopped at the Lewis Mountain campstore for a cold drink and an ice cream sandwich. There I met Captain Squid and Wheezer, a very fit couple from Michigan who are hiking upper-20s every day. I later heard them discussing whether they'd do 28 or 30 miles tomorrow. 
Whiz and Smoky are hiking a much more moderate pace, and we leapfrogged each other several times. They, like most thru-hikers, stopped at Big Meadows Wayside for an hour or longer. I skipped it because it's 0.8 mile off-trail (each way), I was hot and tired, and I had plenty of food in my pack. I was also incented to arrive at Rock Spring Hut early to get one of the limited tent spots. The terrain near the shelter is steep, and the tent pads are all sloped. Most were already taken when I arrived at 5:00, but I did find a suitable spot that catches a tiny breeze. 
A bit overcome by the heat, I napped on top of my sleeping bag for a few minutes before venturing down to the picnic table for dinner. As I expected, hikers started arriving in large numbers just before 7:00 (two hours after the wayside closed), pretty much in order of their hiking speed. The three remaining tent sites were quickly claimed, and the late comers slept in the shelter or at a stealth spot farther up the trail. Although I missed the opportunity to socialize at the Wayside, I'm happy with my decision to get to camp early and settle in. Although the later sunsets lengthen the potential hiking hours, I seem to feel best when I stop hiking between 5:00 and 6:00, have a leisurely dinner, and crawl into my tent before 8:00. 
An interesting feature of the trail today was its construction. In several places it slabs across near-sheer rock faces. The handiwork of the CCC is apparent in the retaining walls constructed from large stone blocks. Most are now moss-covered, making them blend in with the natural features, but the distinctive style of CCC construction projects is apparent.

My sleep was interrupted only by a deer investigating my tent at 2:00 AM and my usual full bladder calls. 

After packing up my tent, I enjoyed a leisurely breakfast with Blueberry, Shane, Smoky, and Whiz. They left a few minutes before I did at 8:00. I enjoyed the morning sights, sounds, and smells of the morning forest as I set out with a spring in my step. 

During the morning, I met one of the unsung heroes of the AT. A volunteer trail maintainer was clearing the undergrowth around the trail with string trimmer. That's a tough job in a back yard, let alone on a remote hiking trail. These people put much of the pleasure into hiking the trail. 

A five-mile walk took me to Skyland Resort. Daniel was leaving, but my breakfast companions were just settling in. It took a long while to get served, but I finally consumed an apple, a sandwich, a muffin, and a mocha. No frozen drinks were available, and, bizarrely, no ice cream before noon. The weather was warm and pleasant for sitting outdoors, and the time passed quickly. 

 

The temperature climbed back into the eighties, but I was able to hang with the group. We took a short break for second lunch at Pinnacles Picnic Ground. Although they're barely a third of my age, I very much enjoyed hiking with this group: good chemistry, smarts, sense of humor, and hiking at my pace. 

We arrived at the US 211 trailhead with a little time to spare before my shuttle. In the shuttle van to Luray, I met Root Beer, who'll be paddling down the Shenandoah River a day ahead of me. More about that tomorrow. 
I checked into the Quality Inn, learned that it's a mile walk to the laundromat (yuck!), took a dip in the small outdoor pool, and ate a big dinner.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652473,"Aqua blazing started today. Neon and I will br paddling 40 miles of the Shenandoah River over the next three. In anticipation, I slept poorly last night, with a hundred small worries popping into my head. I've grown accustomed to the hiking life, but canoe camping is just different enough to put me off. 

This morning, Neon drove us to Front Royal Outdoors, from whom he had rented the canoe. Most of the outfitter's business seems to be large parties of day boaters and floaters, in canoes, kayaks, rafts, and inner tubes. But they took care of us, too. Eventually, after I had unpacked, reorganized, and repacked my gear a few times, we departed for the put-in. 

With us in the van was a young couple with a large, rambunctious dog. Their itinerary was the same as ours. This was a truly big adventure for them, as they had never been canoe camping, and their dog had never been in a boat. 

The couple and their pet were on the water before we were. The dog seemed to be settled as they pushed away from the boat ramp, but soon it was squirming about and leaning over the side. Just as Neon shoved off, we heard a splash, and the dog was in the river. Their trip was not starting as they had anticipated. 




Neon and I started much more auspiciously. He's a proficient paddler, and we operated smoothly together. The river water was brown, and at one point we saw a cow standing in it. We were glad Neon had brought a five-gallon container of drinking water. 

The weather was ideal, warm and mostly sunny. A few thin clouds prevented it from feeling too hot. The river water is brown, but the scenery is pretty. Low-density development along the banks, mostly cottages, alternates with national forest. The Massanutten Mountains provide a scenic backdrop. The water was still near the put-in, but the current picked up and we enjoyed some class 1 rapids as the day progressed. 

Our map and guide were vague, which caused us to spend time hunting for our intended campsite. We didn't want to overshoot it. The High Cliff Canoe Campground turned out to be less grandiose than its name suggested. We camped on a pretty (and sandy) beach within earshot of a small rapid. There was plenty of time for us to take a dip in the river before supper. 

The flying antics of a dozen or more swallows provided dinnertime entertainment. I was in my tent by 8:00 and asleep soon thereafter.","Bixler boat launch (Shenandoah River)

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652521,"A couple of hikers walked into our campsite at 11:30 last night, shining at least one headlamp onto my tent. They politely decided to move on to another spot 100 yards away. There was nonsign of the couple with the rambunctious dog. 

My sleep was long, sound, and restorative. I awoke to see steam rising from the river and another beautiful day in the forecast. With a short day of paddling ahead of us, we took our time packing up and shoving off. 

 

Herons. Lots of herons. I've seen more herons in the past two days than I can count. Most of them have been great blues, but we also spotted a beautiful green heron this morning. They seem to hang out at the rapids to watch us humans. 

Today's section of river seemed to flow a little more quickly. We certainly paddled less, allowing the current to carry us more often. We also saw a lot more traffic on the river, possibly because it's Saturday. Other canoes, kayaks, a few inner tubes, and rafts carrying adult beverages all appeared in multiples. 

The shoreline remained similar to yesterday's, with the notable addition of private camping areas. Some were small, with only two or three tents. Others were considerably larger, including one huge campground with a hundred or more tents, blaring boom boxes, and loudly partying people. 

At class II-III, Compton Rapid is the most challenging of our three-day trip, but there's a way to avoid most of the whitewater. I made a rookie mistake: I misread the hand-drawn map and instructions, and I didn't pull ashore to look at the rapid before shooting it. As a result, we descended a section of whitewater that wasn't suitable for an open canoe. We maintained control, and it was fun, but we shipped a lot of water from the bug waves. If the rapid had been much longer, we'd have swamped or capsized. Neon told me this trip was his first whitewater experience in a canoe. That may be a good thing: he doesn't notice my mistakes in the stern. 

Finding Hazard Mill Canoe Campground was a challenge. It's hidden in the woods, only big enough for three or four tents, and not precisely indicated on our hand-drawn map. After some scouting, we located it at 1:30. We would have preferred paddling farther today, but there's no availability at any of the camping options downstream. (When Neon and I called Front Royal Outdoors several times before the trip, nobody mentioned that we should consider reserving a site at one of the campgrounds downstream from here. By the time we arrived yesterday, they were all booked.) We whiled away the afternoon watching river traffic, doing camp chores, and talking.","High Cliff Canoe Campground

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652584,"Another beautiful day on the river! We've been very lucky to have had three warm, sunny days on the South Fork Shenandoah River. 
Today went much as the previous two days of paddling. We let the river push us from time to time. There was little boat traffic, and it was a very quiet morning until we arrived at Shenandoah River State Park. 
There, a loud and animated Pentacostal preacher was shouting his sermon in Spanish. We ate lunch at a picnic table near the canoe and as far as we could get from the preaching. As we were finishing our meals, we noticed the entire congregation walking toward the canoe launch site. We rushed to the boat so we could launch without interrupting the proceedings. Exchanging a few words with the preacher, who seemed appreciative, we slipped the boat back into the water and paddled away as a man was being led into deep water for a full-immersion baptism. 
Just before Karo Landing, we met Droplet and Suspenders, thru-hikers who were were aqua-blazing the entire way from Waynesboro to beyond Front Royal. Other than the couple with the dog, who may have aborted their trip on the first day, Droplet and Suspenders are the only other canoe campers we've seen on the river. 
Karo Landing, at mile 37, was packed with people preparing to float down the river on inner tubes. In the few minutes we spent there, three school buses unloaded passengers. We stayed only long enough to get some beta on the class II Karo Rapids, just ahead. 
Neon was itching for some excitement, so after watching a few others descend, we rode the wave train down the most intense rapids. We took a little water, but not enough to threaten the stability of the boat. The ride from the bottom of the rapids to the take-out was smooth, and before we knew it, this part of the adventure was over. Aqua blaze video: Neon produced a 15-minute video of our aqua blaze.

My top priority in Front Royal was to replace my trekking poles. Both poles (Leki Micro-Vario Carbon) failed as we broke camp yesterday morning. One was stuck in the folded position, the other extended. I suspect that sand got into the locking mechanism. The timing was incredibly fortunate because my tent requires both poles for support, and there's an outfitter in Front Royal. Mountain Trails, the outfitter, didn't have the necessary parts for a repair, so I bought a new pair. 

Neon started his long drive to South Carolina just before noon. Soon after he left, Yardsale and Rambo, part of my instant tramily in April, joined me for lunch. Support from friends, both tangible and emotional, continues to make this hike a terrific experience. 

I also ran into Cheeseball, Groceries, Fox, and Roadrunner today. That was a surprise because I thought they'd be ahead of me by now. They zeroed here today, too. We'll undoubtedly see each other again on trail soon. 

The transition from hiking to paddling caused me some anxiety. Now I'm feeling a similar unease about returning to the trail tomorrow. The forecast of wet weather isn't helping. I find it interesting that my little side adventure on the water has caused uncomfortable feelings. I'm sure I'll be fine once I've been back on trail for a day or two...or perhaps when the nice weather returns.","Front Royal, VA

I called last evening and left a voicemail message asking for a pickup this morning. I got a confirmation text message late last night, but no taxi showed up this morning and nobody answered my repeated phone calls. Chris, the maintenance guy at the Baymont, noticed me waiting outside this morning. He very kindly drove me to the trailhead. I started out in warm, filtered sun, but it soon clouded over.
For the most part today, the trail was mostly moderately graded and very well maintained. At VA 638, I saw and thanked three volunteer trail maintainers who had cleared a section of trail. They were the first people I'd seen in several hours. 
At mid-day, I crossed I-66. The traffic noise, audible for five miles on either side of the highway, isn't pleasant. But crossing another interstate highway feels like a milestone. 

 
It started to sprinkle just before I reached Manassas Gap Shelter. I stopped at the shelter for a few minutes to get out of the rain and eat the second half of my lunch. La Familia, a family of four from Oklahoma City, was hunkered down there. When the rain abated for a few minutes, I headed out. It rained again, but my umbrella kept me comfortable. 
Whiskey Hollow Shelter was my destination for the night. I usually prefer to sleep in my tent, but there aren't any flat spots near the shelter or for the next several miles. Whiskey Hollow Shelter is a spacious, new, double-decker. I grabbed a spot at the edge of the second level. Siesta and Spooky, whom I had met separately before, were there when I arrived. La Familia and two other hikers arrived later. The eight of us ate dinner together, with two or more simultaneous conversations often happening. 
The others caught me up on trail news. Tabasco and Brazil have left the trail. A Lotta and Maggie are a day behind, slowed by A Lotta's knee injury. Aqua is a few days ahead.

It was warm and humid as the sun rose above the hills. My prescription sunglasses were steamed up, so I put them on my hat for a few minutes. When I reached for them, they weren't there. I spent more than an hour looking for them in the dense underbrush, but to no avail. I have a spare pair at home, but I'm annoyed with myself for being careless with them. 
There were a few SOBO section hikers today. Roadrunner & Co. leapfrogged with me, but I didn't see many other thru-hikers. I suspect most got an early start and headed for Bear's Den Hostel, some four miles beyond my campsite at Sam Moore Shelter. 
We're definitely in the green tunnel. At these lower elevations below 2,000', the spring wildflowers have given way to all-green foliage. The trail was moderate until the start of the infamous Roller Coaster. The Roller Coaster consists of about ten 500-foot climbs over 14 miles. None of the climbs is especially difficult on its own for a fit hiker, but put together they can be exhausting. Think of wind sprints for endurance athletes. 
After the second bump on the Roller Coaster comes an exciting milestone: the 1,000-mile mark of the Appalachian Trail. And the shelter appeared after the fifth bump, about halfway through. Splitting the Roller Coaster into two roughly equal pieces will make it easier than doing the whole thing in a single day. 
It started to rain hard just as Roadrunner, Fox, Cheeseball, Groceries, and I sat down to dinner at the covered (sheltered) picnic table. I stuck around after they left, and two section hikers joined me. As I write this at 8:30 PM, nobody is in the shelter: we're all tenting or hammocking.

Back on the Roller Coaster, I tried to approach the terrain with patience and humility. Having a break overnight helped, as did a stop this morning for a pint of ice cream at Bear's Den Hostel. Still, by the end of the day I was tired and my left Achilles was painfully inflamed. I was glad to see the side trail to the shelter.

The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) is headquartered in Harpers Ferry. Thru-hikers traditionally register their arrival at the ATC Visitors Center and have their photos added to a record book. (I was number 714 to arrive this year.) 
For me, reaching Harpers Ferry carries personal meaning as well. It's where I ended my first really long hike (https://www.trailjournals.com/...). I was overcome with emotion at the accomplishment in 2017. That hike made me realize that, if I wanted it strongly enough, an AT thru-hike was possible.

The forecast and the weather radar both suggested that the rain would taper off in the next hour or so, so I had another cup of coffee and stayed dry for another hour.

At Gathland State Park, Friendship Baptist Church congregants had set up a huge trail magic hiker feed in a big picnic shelter. Church members made a point of mingling and chatting with hikers, which doesn't always happen when a group of friends hosts a big hiker feed. I ate a big cheeseburger, raw veggies, fresh strawberries, an apple, grapes, and some cookies. There were plenty of other choices, too, including resupply items and hiker essentials (ibuprofen, hand sanitizer, etc.). I had overcounted the days to my next resupply, so I'm already carrying significantly more food weight than necessary. I didn't add any more than I was able to carry in my stomach. 

Just five miles later, at Lamb's Knoll access road, was another trail magic setup. At a much smaller scale, this one was hosted by a couple. I appreciated fresh fruit along with homemade cookies and apple bread. It was just a mile on a full stomach from there to Rocky Run Shelter, where I set up my tent. I joined the shelter dwellers at the picnic table to socialize, but I ate only a few nibbles before brushing my teeth and bedding down for the night.

The trail passed some pivotal Civil War sites and memorials. The highlight of the day, however, was the original Washington Monument, where you can still climb the stairs. In a history twofer, I caught a hazy view of Antietam Battlefield from the top of the Washington Monument. Back on the ground, a young woman approached me with a smile and a big greeting.

It was warmer today than it has been in a while, and quite humid. Lots of day hikers and weekend backpackers were out. It's good to see so many people enjoying the outdoors, but selfishly I miss the solitude that I sometimes took for granted earlier in this adventure.

In addition to packaged salty and sweet snacks, he was cooking hot dogs over charcoal...perfectly. Young thru-hiker TBD had passed me and arrived a few minutes before I did. We chatted while we ate and then headed out with full bellies. 
A few rocky patches and one big climb added some spice to what otherwise was easy going. I had planned to stop for the night at Rocky Mountain Shelters, but I quickly realized I'd get there early. 
Looking ahead, I picked Caledonia State Park, at 18 miles, as my destination for the night. The park was reported to have a swimming pool, showers, and a picnic pavilion. In reality, the park is set up exclusively for visitors who arrive by car. The ranger station / camping check-in was closed for the day, and the after-hours self-service system would have required at least another mile of walking. Making the park even less appealing,  the pool was closed (empty), the picnic pavilion was far from the campsites, and I couldn't find any bear boxes in the camping area.  
After eating my leftover lunch and some snacks, I headed back to the trail. It was after 7:00 when I arrived at Quarry Gap Shelters. The shelter area is truly delightful, looking more like an upscale cabin in the woods than a typical AT shelter. There was space for one more in one of the two tiny shelters. I was tempted by the idea of not having to set up my tent, but gnats were swarming, it was hot with not a breath of wind, and the shelters looked stuffy. I found a smooth, flat spot for my tent less than 100 yards up the trail from the shelters. 

 
Tired after a longer day than I had anticipated, I nibbled a few snacks rather than cooking a dinner. I chatted with Phantom at the picnic table while I ate hastily. Then I headed for my tent, hoping I'll be able to sleep through the sticky heat and the noisy whippoorwills.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653132,"Today, I passed the halfway point of the Appalachian Trail. The math is a little off for my personal hike because of my BMT start and recent aqua blaze. However, crossing the ""official"" threshold stirred up some thoughts and emotions. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I look back on what it took to get here. I'm no longer afraid of anything the trail can throw at me: some things will be more pleasurable than others, but I feel confident I can handle the tough stuff, barring illness or injury, of course. I've been out here for three months and eleven days, a long time to be hiking, but only a short span of my life. Passing the halfway mark reminded me that this part of my life will have to end...not long from now. It's a reminder to spend every day on trail as if it's my last, because all too soon, it will be my last trail day. I know I'll miss the trail after I leave it. 
The forecasted overnight thunderstorms didn't occur. I appreciated the mostly quiet (except whippoorwills) night and the dry pack-up this morning.

I lollygagged at the fairytale shelter, chatting with Thumbs. She started a thru-hike last year and abandoned in Harpers Ferry. She recently resumed where she left off. Our paths crossed a couple of times today. 

Stopped for early lunch at Birch Run Shelter, I was surprised to see Roadrunner and Co. walk up. At the next shelter, Toms Run, TBD appeared.

Pine Grove Furnace General Store, just past the halfway point, is the location of the infamous half-gallon challenge. The challenge is to eat a half-gallon of ice cream (that's a 1 1/2-quart tub plus a pint) in less than an hour. The prize? A wooden spoon. I settled for a pint, but Cheeseball and Groceries went for the challenge, which they both met. Cheeseball looked considerably more comfortable than Groceries afterwards. Perhaps it was the practice she got the day she ate the barrel of Chese Balls. 

Tonight I'm staying at Ironmasters Mansion Hostel in Pine Grove Furnace State Park. Built by the ironmaster in 1823, the size and grandeur of the mansion are still apparent, although its former elegance has certainly faded. It's probably the most spacious, least crowded hostel I've experienced. 

Notable encounters: - Shadow, who is hiking the ECT, joined me for a meal and ice cream - Hikin' Mama and her daughter Trouper camped at Quarry Gap Shelters and are in bunks next to mine at Ironmasters. 

Clarification: In haste, I didn't adequately explain the Siesta-Potato Chip story. Back when I met them--in Tennessee, I think--Potato Chip was hiking with Brazil. Siesta was hiking with Tabasco. They were all hiking at a similar pace, so the four frequently found themselves together. Since then, Brazil and Tabaco left the trail. When I next met Siesta in northern Virginia, she was hiking alone, doing low-mileage days, waiting for Potato Chip to catch up. Siesta and Potato Chip connected in Harpers Ferry, before I saw them in Waynesboro, PA.

A couple hours into my hike, Roadrunner passed me. With her were Hiking Mama and her 18-year-old daughter Trouper. The latter two have impressed me with their hiking speed and stamina, given that they started ""off the couch"" in Harpers Ferry the same day I did. 

Those three, and a few others, were eating lunch at Green Mountain General Store when I arrived. Cheeseball and Focs joined us, as did Groceries a while later. The food was just ordinary, but it still tasted better than anything in my pack. 

The trail became more varied and interesting in the afternoon. First was a fun little rock scramble on the appropriately-named Rocky Ridge. Later, the trail came down from South Mountain and out of Michaux State Forest into the farmland of Cumberland Valley. It meandered through a mile of cornfields before transiting a park into the center of Boiling Springs. 

After dinner at a pizza place, I texted Red Cardinal B&B. Bill drove me the two miles to the house, I showered, and Joanne washed the few clothes that I wore today.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653237,"Cooler temperatures and a stiff breeze made hiking much more comfortable today. The trail continued through Cumberland Valley farm country. North of Boiling Springs, it ran mostly through a narrow strip of woods between corn fields. The woods provided a break from the wind, some shade, and a haven for songbirds. The terrain was also remarkably flat. Cumberland Valley has provided the easiest continuous 17 miles I've hiked on the AT. 

Features that added interest were a tidy 19th century cemetery and the first fence stiles I've seen since central Virginia. Also noteworthy, the trail crossed I-76, another noisy landmark. Since I had a relatively short day, I detoured a mile or so down the road into Carlisle for lunch at Middlesex Diner. The waitress seemed a little surprised that I kept ordering more food.
Soon after finishing lunch, I came across Trail View Market, a small farm stand tended by 13-year-old Samuel. He's the second of ten children in his family. After graduating from eighth grade this year, he's finished with school: he'll be working full-time on the family farm from now on. The broccoli looked nice, and there was fresh milk in half-gallon glass bottles, but I settled for a cup of their home-made ice cream. 

 

A short climb at the end of the day led to Darlington Shelter. It had been windy all day, so I chose my tent site carefully. Magic Jim arrived, bearing trail magic in his day pack. Later, Droplet and Suspenders (fellow aqua blazers) and Root Beer (from Luray) showed up. After dinner, Droplet and Suspenders taught the rest of us how to play the dice game farkle. Beginner's luck was with me, and I won. 

The social dynamics this evening were fascinating. Almost instinctively, the thru-hikers gathered at the picnic table for dinner and socializing. Some of the weekenders (there were nearly a dozen) joined in for a while, but not for long. The five of us settled into comfortable conversation that would have been improbable in the ""civilized"" world. Differences in age, gender, race, and background seemed irrelevant. 
At this point, well into the second half of the trail, conversations have shifted noticeably. I hear less about what gear people are using or how many miles they're walking, and more about the cool things they've experienced. That shift suits me: my conversation with Samuel at the farm stand is far more meaningful and relevant to my hike than what brand of socks somebody is wearing.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653274,"A temperature of 50 degrees F and a brisk wind combined to make it feel chilly this morning. The wind kept up all day, but sun warmed things up nicely. In all, it was good hiking weather. 

The trail started mostly downhill on packed dirt, making the walking easy. A couple of farm fields added variety to the forest views. Then the last couple miles into Duncannon were down a long series of steep stone steps. The trail goes through the middle of town on city sidewalks for a mile or two. 

I had been looking forward to having lunch at the newly remodeled Doyle Hotel, a legendary hiker institution in Duncannon. But it was closed. So was the pizza place. Root Beer, who had been just ahead of me, intercepted me to deliver this bad news. We retraced our steps to the Sunoco gas station, where we found heatlamp-warmed cheeseburgers and potato wedges. I must be turning into hiker trash because it felt totally normal to eat lunch sitting on the sidewalk just outside the gas station door, facing the pumps. I celebrated Father's Day and Juneteenth with a pint of Ben and Jerry's. 

After lunch, I followed the trail through town, chatting for a while as I walked with Gandolph until he sped up and I elected to hold my pace. Other than the gas station, the only places that seemed to be open were the volunteer fire department and the Duncannon Assembly of God ""hiker"" church. After crossing the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers, the trail headed back into the woods. That's when I realized that I'm indeed in Rocksylvania. It took me nearly two hours to cover the 2.5 miles to the shelter. My Achilles complained insistently about the sudden, repeated pulling and stretching in different directions. I was happy to see the shelter and happier still to unload my feet. 
I found a reasonably flat spot near the trail to pitch my tent, and then I wandered down to the shelter. Root Beer and a newbie section hiker were at the picnic table. Root Beer and I worked together to teach the section hiker some leave-no-trace principles. (No, it's not OK to wash your dishes in the water source, it's not OK to litter the ground with your orange peels, and your trash won't burn completely in the campfire.)

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653358,"Shoelace has driven down from northern Maine to perform trail magic and drive me around on my zero day tomorrow. His plan was to drive overnight and arrive at the PA 225 road crossing, about four miles from Clarks Ferry Shelter, by 10:00 AM. I lollygagged this morning to time my arrival with his. 

As I was sauntering down the trail after breakfast, Yardsale (an ""instant tramily"" member from TN/VA) came running up toward me. He had driven from Alexandria to spend his day off with Shoelace and me. I knew he was coming for the day, but I didn't expect to see him on trail! We walked and talked the remaining three miles or so to the road crossing. 

Shoelace was finishing his trail magic setup when Yardsale and I arrived. As a hiker, Shoelace knew what to offer: burgers, chili, mix-your-own salad, and sweets. Even better than the food was enjoying the company of my ""off trail"" friends. I ate and lingered, put most of my gear in Shoelace's truck, and slackpacked to the next road crossing. 

Trail maintenance improved dramatically immediately after I started. The thorns and poison ivy were cut back, Stone steps had been built, rocks had been cleared. Blowdowns had been cleared. Wow! Different trail clubs are responsible for their respective sections of trail. I had just moved from one of the worst to one of the best I've seen. 

At Table Rocks, I came across some kids rock climbing with two adult leaders. At the top of one route, I took some pictures for the kids. One big shared my fear of heights, and I coached him on how to lean back into a rappel. Then I noticed a friction problem on another rope, which I pointed out to the leaders. (FYI for climbers: a long anchor was built from what appeared to be dynamic rope. The knot was rubbing up and down on the cliff edge when the rope was weighted/unweighted.) 

At Peters Mountain Shelter, there was a group of girls engaged in a deep Bible study conversation. Not having anything to contribute on that subject, I collected water and moved on. 

Not far beyond that, I came across two volunteer trail maintainers from Susquehanna A.T. Club. They were digging out water bars and clearing branches. We had a long chat, and I thanked them for their work. Trail maintainers are the unsung trail angels. They do the hard physical labor that makes the trail such a joy for those of us who hike it. 

Shoelace picked me up at the designated spot. We checked into the Quality Inn and drove to dinner. The first place we picked from Trip Advisor turned out to be in a golf course clubhouse. Not being dressed or showered appropriately for that, we doubled back and stopped at a seedy bar we had passed earlier. I'm getting the impression that Pennsylvania doesn't have many mid-priced restaurants where you can get a beer or glass of wine with your meal. 

Back at the hotel, I showered and went to bed. Laundry can wait until tomorrow.

We stopped at the post office and the gas station, and finally at the trailhead. He's driving straight through to his home in Exeter, Maine. I've enjoyed his company and his support over the past 48 hours. 

There was solitude on the trail today. Margaritaville passed me early in the day, two SOBOs crossed me, and a trail runner jogged by as I was preparing supper. Those are the only people I've seen since the trailhead. It being a cloudy Wednesday was surely a factor. 

Rocks are becoming a little more prevalent, but the worst is yet to come. The trail didn't climb or descend much (by AT standards), and there weren't any views. The scenery was mostly mountain laurel and balsam forest. The only notable ""feature"" was the crossing of an old beaver dam. It required careful foot placement and trekking poles for balance. I was pleased with myself for making it across with dry feet. 

The gnats are out in force. With nearly no wind to deal with, they had no trouble harassing me. I noticed a few mosquitoes, too, but they were concentrated around a few wet areas. I spray my legs with insect repellent every morning (for ticks). If mosquitoes become more prevalent, I'll need to cover more than just my legs.

It took a long time to get to sleep. I'm pretty sure it rained all night, and it was still raining at dawn. My tent kept me dry, but I had to roll it up very wet and muddy. Some of the stakes were very loose this morning: I should routinely reinforce them with rocks when there's overnight rain in the forecast. 

The weather ranged from rain and drizzle to mist moat of the day. The sun came through faintly for an hour this afternoon, but it disappeared. Overall, it's been a very damp, but not completely wet, day. I forded two small creeks early this morning. My feet didn't dry much as I hiked. 

 

Late this morning, I met Caboose. He had hit it off with Shoelace at Shoelace's trail magic. We leapfrogged through the day. 

I stopped for late lunch at William Penn Shelter. As I arrived, Spider and Guam were leaving. I'm a little disappointed I didn't see them after that. Three section hikers were at the shelter for lunch, as were thru-hikers Shaggy and Switch. Shaggy started his thru the day before I did, Switch started the day after. After a slow start, they're doing big miles now.

The hiking was mostly unremarkable except for the increasing rockyness. My feet are sore, and my Achilles tendinitis is in full flare. I plan to take some extra zero days as the trail gets even rockier between here and Delaware Water Gap. 

Yesterday's solitude disappeared today. I saw several hikers in addition to the ones I mentioned, and I've seen about a dozen tents spread around the large Hertline Campsite. I found a spot by myself beside the creek with both creek and waterfall noise to block out any whippoorwills tonight.

Seeing the early morning sun touching the treetops above gave me a boost. The sun disappeared by mid-morning, which kept the temperature pleasant for hiking until late in the day. No complaints. 

For the third time on this hike, I had to dig a cathole in the Pennsylvania rocks. That's not an easy task! Sometimes it requires starting over in a different place. This morning, the first site I chose was a winner. A small victory to start the day! 

Shaggy and I leapfrogged a couple times until he pulled far ahead of me in the rocky terrain this afternoon. Speaking of terrain, it consisted of a reasonable mix of dirt and rocks this morning, growing rockier as it approached Port Clinton. It didn't help that I was getting tired. Any misstep could cause acute pain in my left Achilles, so my pace slowed to about 1 mph in the rocks. I still yelped from time to time. 

Today didn't feature any pretty views, even in the sunny afternoon. Instead, I passed hundreds of acres of ferns that created textured green carpeting under the high tree canopy. (Prescribed burns probably account for at least some this.) 

While my head was down and my eyes looking for the next foot placement, I didn't notice the timber rattler just ahead until I almost stepped on it. Fortunately, it warned me as I was just a step away. We both recoiled at the same time. It slithered just inches off the trail as I took a step back. Neither of us moved for a minute or so. Finally, I stepped past, hugging the far side of the trail and planting my pole between us. The snake rattled its displeasure one more time, but it remained otherwise motionless. The incident rattled me [pun intended] and reminded me that I should look a little farther ahead, even if that requires me to slow down even more in the rockiest areas.

It's next to the largest Cabela's in the world and close to a Walmart for convenient resupply. It was booked tonight, so I looked for a nearby alternative. It wasn't easy. The only reference to the Bismarck B&B was in a comment on FarOut, but the poster had incorrectly called it the Bristol. 

I'm glad I did the sleuthing. The Bismarck B&B is a beautifully-preserved house built in 1910. The owners are a high-school teacher and the mayor of Hamburg, who also happens to be the county coroner. As charming as the house is the town of Hamburg itself. It boasts a busy, vibrant downtown with a walkable mix of residential and commercial properties. Within a quarter-mile of the B&B are a supermarket, a laundromat, a movie theater, offices, tourist shops, a micro-brewery, a half-dozen places to eat, and hundreds of single-family homes. I'm immensely impressed that the development around the nearby Cabela's and Walmart haven't gutted the historic downtown. 

 

My one concern is more personal. This evening, my Achilles is still sore from the last few days of walking on sharp rocks. I'm heading back to the trail tomorrow morning with trepidation.

From the grapevine, I expected the trail north from Hamburg to be nothing but rocks. In reality, it was highly varied. The initial climb was thoughtfully designed and well maintained, mostly on stone steps. Later, the trail crossed a few rock fields, but there were also long stretches of smooth dirt. My Achilles was sore by day's end, but not achingly so. 

 
I enjoyed lunch with a view at Pulpit Rock, the first worthwhile overlook in several days. Second lunch with an equally pretty view came a few miles later at The Pinnacle. I wasn't alone, though: the pretty weekend weather attracted groups of day hikers and thru-hikers. At The Pinnacle, thru-hiker Burning Man offered me some champagne-flavored jelly beans. 
With overnight thunderstorms predicted, my destination for the night was Eckville Shelter. An unusual design, it's a shed-like building with a door at each end. The floor was crumbling concrete, and even with both doors open the air smelled like hiker funk. There were only six bunks, and I arrived just in time to claim the last one. A nearby building housed a couple of luxuries: a flush toilet and a cold-water shower. I took full advantage of both.

Some changes in the natural world remind me that I'm no longer in the South. The grey squirrels have given way to (much cuter) chipmunks. For some time, there haven't been rhododendrons in damp areas. I miss them. Apart from the ambiance they provide, rhododendrons have nice, firm leaves for directing weak-flowing water into a container.

The trail today varied from smooth dirt to rock jumbles to scrambles. The most challenging of the latter is Knife's Edge (not to be confused with the Knife Edge on Mount Katahdin). The scrambling wasn't technically difficult, but it was hazardous. Even a small slip could have resulted in serious injury. Fortunately, the rocks were mostly dry by the time I got there in the afternoon. I took my time. 

My hiking buddy Anhaga drove to the Bake Oven Road crossing to do some trail magic and meet me when I walked by this afternoon. He had planned something modest, and he was surprised to see Mountain Goat (class of 2016) and Mary had set up a huge spread with tents, carpets, a grill, and dozens of food options. I enjoyed the food offerings and catching up a little with Anhaga. All too soon, however, it was time for them to go home and for me to push on. Meeting friends along the way has been part of what has made this hike so enjoyable. 

Achilles tendinitis: I awoke with my left Achilles tendon still inflamed from yesterday's rocks. For the first time in several months, I took an Aleve before hitting the trail this morning. It helped through the morning. Late this afternoon, especially during the last mile over Bake Oven Knob to my campsite, the inflammation was back at full strength. I'm planning to take another zero after tomorrow. All these recovery days are slowing me down more than I'd like. I promised myself before I started that I'd listen to my body.

I've been careful not to have any food in the tent, but I've slopped some onto my clothes, and I'm sure my pack (which I keep inside the tent at night) emits all kinds of interesting odors. 

The wind, which was completely still at dusk, picked up overnight. I bundled up more this morning than I have in a while. The weather was delightful once the sun rose and I started moving. Mild temperatures, low humidity, and a breeze made for ideal hiking conditions. 

I passed a tent and, later, a hammock, but I didn't see any occupants. Late this morning, I met day hiker Pierre. An enthusiastic hiker himself, he recommended the GR-10 in the Pyrenees as a spectacular but little-known alternative to the Camino de Santiago. 

Much of the area around Palmerton was decimated by zinc mining and lead contamination. Groundwater across several miles of trail is still unsafe to drink. A forest fire and hydrochloric acid used in zinc processing burned thousands of acres of mountain woodland. The replanted ""forest"" is young and sparse. The one positive is that the thin vegetation offered more views than are common on the heavily-wooded AT. 

There was only a short section of feet-don't-touch-dirt rockfield on the trail today, a pleasant surprise. This being Pennsylvania, there were still plenty of rocks to punishba careless foot placement. My left Achilles tendon continues to take a beating, so I'm planning another zero day tomorrow.

The towns of Slatington, Walnutport, and Palmerton were candidates for a zero, but none seemed to offer overnight accommodations. Sunny Rest was listed in AWOL but not in FarOut. At first, I dismissed it as being too far out of town and, to be honest, out of my comfort zone. I'd never been to a nudist resort. 
The resort, I learned, offers pick-up/drop-off service and discounted rates for hikers. The weather forecast was favorable. So why not? It would be an interesting new experience, and that's what this adventure has been all about. 
Yesterday, I got driven to Sunny Rest in a dump truck--surprising, but appropriate for a hiker. I checked in and walked to my  room. The room is actually half of a single-wide manufactured home with a full-width front porch on the end. A table and two chairs are not in the small room, but on the large, covered porch. I eased into nudity, first in my room, then unpacking my gear on the porch, and finally carrying my clothes to the laundromat. I felt self-conscious at first, as it seemed that many people in the residential area were dressed. Donning a practical mindset, I reminded myself of how convenient it was to launder all my clothes at once while I took a shower and a dip in the pool. 
The pool and hot tub area is the center of activity and social life. The bars and eateries all face the pool area. Some people congregated there in clique-ish groups of regulars who knew each other well and hung out together. Many others seemed to be occasional visitors who were more open to conversations with strangers. Some, like me, were more shy or reserved. 
It was chilly this morning, so I covered up until it got warm. Once it warmed up, I got naked and stayed that way. I struggled not to feel a little self-conscious walking around the grounds unclothed. Playing a five-game volleyball match in the pool helped me focus on something other than my, and others', nudity. On a positive note, being able to putter around my room naked with the shades open and the lights on has felt liberating.  
The vibe on this Wednesday was very relaxed and laid-back. The resort was perhaps at a quarter of its capacity, and there wasn't much going on. It's apparently very different on the weekends, when working folks from mearby cities congregate here to party. On weekends, there are massages and yoga lessons, the nightclub and full-service restaurant are open, and special activities are scheduled (beer fest, body painting, and foreworks this coming weekend). 
Spending a zero day here was a great decision. Because I resupplied and laundered yesterday, today has been an unusually restful break from the trail. I'm glad I chose to go almost exclusively clothes-free today,  even when I didn't feel entirely at ease. 

 
Would I return? Perhaps. I'll be less likely in future to rule out staying at a clothing-optional resort just because of the nudity. On the other hand, being fully exposed to the sun all day isn't good for my cancer-prone skin. And now that I've done the dare, there wouldn't be the same thrill in repeating it.  Casual observations on things I had wondered about before arriving:- Overwhelmingly white guests and staff, very few people of color- Predominantly M-F couples, some unaccompanied men, very few unaccompanied women- Mostly aged 40s and 50s; some retired; a few families with young kids; very few young adults- All body types, from skinny to buff to obese- Mostly lightly-tanned skin; a few leathery, sun-baked hides- Nearly all women, and about half the men, devoid of pubic hair- Almost all natural breasts--noticed only one woman who had had obvious surgical enhancement- Absolutely no sexual contact in public beyond a brief hug or a chaste kiss...at least before I went to bed at hiker midnight - Strict prohibition of photography; phones in use around the pool had the backs (cameras) pointed down","Palmerton, PA

The climb is a legitimate scramble. A couple places had enough exposure to scare me, but it was mostly fun. The trail leveled out after the climb. The trail club did an exemplary job on the trail relocation. Big rocks had been pulverized into small chunks, which were used to fill in the gaps. Overall, it created a pleasant walking experience, and I made good time while having a good time. 

 

That all changed when the trail passed into the domain of a different trail maintenance club. Trail building, to them, seemed to consist of painting a few blazes. The rocks were sharp and plentiful. I had to watch each foot placement carefully. Even so, my Achilles started aching by mid-afternoon, and I yelped a few times when my attention slipped and I misjudged a foot placement. Progress was slow, and I was glad to see the side trail to the campsite. 

The water source here is a long 0.4 mile (each way) trek downhill. Opah was climbing up as I headed down to the spring. We tented in the same area, and we chatted for a short while before he headed to his tent and I started preparing dinner. 

Despite the warm (80s) sunny weather, I saw few other hikers on the trail. Captain BG was taking a break at the top of the scramble. Two other hikers passed me while I was slowed by the rocks this afternoon. That was it until I saw Opah. After being around so many people at Sunny Rest, the solitude was refreshing.

The last several days have been hard to take, both physically and psychologically. I know there are more rocks to come, but getting to Delaware Water Gap makes me feel as if I've accomplished something significant. 

The heat was on: my shirt was wet with perspiration most of the day. That, combined with the scarcity of water on this section of trail, required some careful decision-making. I carried 3 L from camp. I figured that would be plenty to get me to a spring some ten miles away. (Papa Bear reported two days ago that there was ""cold, extremely clean water"" at the spring.) At Wind Gap, not quite halfway to the spring, a trail angel had left a water cache. I replaced the liter I had consumed and continued on with 3 L, thinking I was carrying too much. By the time I got to the spring, I had consumed more than two of the three liters. And the spring wasn't flowing: there was nothing but mud where the pool of clean water had been just two days ago. Very grateful for the trail angel's generosity and my decision to carry more water than I thought necessary, I continued with enough to quench my thirst for the remaining 3.4 miles to Kirkridge Shelter. 

My Achilles was very sore this morning. The short walk to the privy was slow and painful. Facing another day of rocks, I took an Aleve before setting out. It helped. I felt much better on the rocks today than I did yesterday. 

Opa left before I did, and we leapfrogged a few times. Switchfoot caught up with me and slowed his pace so we could chat for a while we walked. A New Jersey resident, he told me to expect easier walking beyond my intended destination of Kirkwood Shelter. 

It was only 3:30 when I reached Kirkwood Shelter. Opa had just arrived and was preparing to spend the night. The shelter looked inviting, and there was a nice tentsite behind it. Best of all, a nearby retreat center had installed a well water spigot nearby for use by hikers. But it was early, I still had legs, and the NSAID was doing its magic. Relying on the beta from Switchfoot, I decided to walk the remaining 6+ miles to Delaware Water Gap. (The trail goes through the town.) 

My hiking buddy White Lightnin' had offered to host me at his nearby home for a couple nights and help me resupply. But he wasn't expecting me until tomorrow, so I booked a room in DWG. When I texted him my plans, he insisted on picking me up tonight despite the last-minute notice. The owner of Deer Head Inn in DWG kindly refunded my room deposit, and White Lightnin' drove me to his farmhouse in Asbury, NJ. 

Wildlife sighting: For the first time on this hike, I saw a buck. Just three points, but a buck nonetheless. He didn't run away, but he was careful to keep some vegetation between us.

They hosted me for a zero today, giving me the opportunity to do while I do a thorough gear cleaning and permethrin application. Later, White Lightnin' drove me to a supermarket for resupply. After a yummy dinner, I accompanied them as they fed and watered their animals. Holding a young lamb was soothing, at least until its mom insisted that I give back her offspring.

Just a mile from the start stands Catfish Fire Tower, which is celebrating its centennial this year. Volunteer firefighter Bob from the NJ Forest Fire Service was there when I arrived. He invited me to follow him up the stairs into the cab at the top. Thanks to my fear of heights, I needed to stop once on the way up to control my breathing. Eventually, I made it to the top as he was checking in. He pointed out some sights, including the Catskills in the far distance, and he talked about some fires he had worked on. 

 
Bob had a sense of humor, so I decided to have some fun with him. I crossed many hikers, mostly day hikers, in the next few hours. I said to each one, ""If you tell Bob that KJ sent you, he might invite you up into the cab at the top of the tower."" Most hikers seemed to take it seriously, making sure they got my trail name correctly. I can imagine Bob rolling his eyes and smiling when the fifth or sixth one told him the same thing.
Walking ""backwards"" (SOBO) today, I met several hikers I know. Switchfoot, who had taken a zero yesterday, is doing big miles and will be ahead of me tomorrow. Opa is moving just a bit faster than I. Guam is pretty much on my pace. Black Hole was off the trail for an eye condition--I may see him again, but he'll probably move ahead of me. 

Sunfish Pond was postcard-perfect today. The weather was ideal, and the setting was idyllic. A group of day hikers at the south end of the pond treated me like a celebrity, complete with video interview, group photo, and handshakes all around. 

White Lightnin' and Shauna had set up their trail magic near the end of my walk, at the north end of the bridge over the Delaware River. Having lollygagged along the way, I didn't arrive until late afternoon, as they were preparing to pack up. The last hikers to arrive were Moonwalker from Massachusetts and Fitbit, a fellow Québecois. They're doing big miles, and I'm zeroing tomorrow, so I probably won't see them again. I finished my walk across the bridge into Delaware Water Gap while White Lightnin' drove. We arrived at Sycamore Grille for dinner at about the same time. 

Curious cases of mistaken identity: A weekend backpacker mistook me for a ranger. A trio of thru-hikers mistook me for a ridgerunner. I must have appeared official today.

I saw surprisingly few people on trail today, perhaps four groups total. I did see a porcupine for the first time on the AT. And I noticed a couple of wild turkeys watching over 7 or 8 chicks as they foraged in the undergrowth. 

About three miles before Gren Anderson Shelter, the AT crosses NJ 206. I walked a quarter mile down the highway to Gyp's Tavern, where I enjoyed some beer and a food truck dinner. The tavern has a large lawn on the shore of Kittatinny Lake. A fairly large crowd was celebrating Independence Day. I mingled with some hikers and a few normies. The uphill walk to the shelter was tough with a belly full of food and beer.

Today dawned warm and humid. It stayed that way throughout the day. Morning sunshine gave way to afternoon clouds, which kept it from getting unbearably hot. 

What is it about BBC Newshour that compels hikers to play it at high volume in the backcountry? Early on today's hike, the trail crested Sunrise Mountain, on which stands a large stone pavilion with benches and a great view. Two hikers were there, one reading quietly while taking in the view, the other listening to BBC Newshour at high volume while he ate breakfast. The noise detracted immensely from what otherwise would have been a peaceful spot. This was the second time on this hike that I've encountered somebody playing a newscast in the wilderness. Both times, it was the BBC Newshour. 

The rest of the morning was more peaceful. There were numerous overlooks, but the views weren't great because of the high humidity. As in Pennsylvania, there were plenty of rocks, but somehow they didn't feel as punishing. On a positive note, there was plenty of solitude. After the pavilion, I saw only one group of people before lunch. 

High Point State Park HQ was the logical spot to take a lunch break. In addition to flush toilets and a water spigot, there's a trash can specifically for hikers. Fitbit and Moonwalker were getting ready to leave as I arrived. I've enjoyed talking with then, but they're averaging nearly 50% more miles per day than I am, so they'll soon be far ahead. After they left, I went inside to buy some salty snacks and a 50-cent root beer. 

The seven-mile stretch from the park office began with a short climb. I caught up with Black Hole near the top, and he followed me closely the rest of the afternoon. The conversation was fine, but I generally prefer to be alone while hiking and yet have company at the end of the day. 

Today's destination was the ""secret"" shelter, so named because it doesn't appear in some trail guides. It's an unofficial, privately-owned shelter a quarter mile off the trail. Former thru-hiker Jim Murray invites AT hikers to enjoy his property, which includes the shelter, a large tenting field, a well-water spigot, a (cold) outdoor shower, a privy, and even electrical outlets for charging devices. Jake the donkey acts as host and greeter. 

 

After setting up my tent and throwing a bear line, it felt good to rinse off some of the sweat and grime in the shower. At dinner on the shelter's front porch, I chatted with Bebop, Nashvegas, and Houdini before heading to my tent early.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654240,"The predicted overnight rain didn't fall, but my tent was still wet from dew this morning. The air was warm, still, and humid. I was sweating heavily almost as soon as I started walking. 

Walking today was easier than it has been in a couple weeks. I started across a half-mile series of bog bridges followed by a short wooded section and some freshly-cut pastures. Nice variety! The feature of the day was a long walk around the perimeter of Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge provides wetland habitat for migratory birds and the endangered bog turtle. (I didn't see any of either.) After a short, steep climb up and over Pochuck Mountain, the trail crossed the mile-long Pochuck Boardwalk across another wetland. 

 

With some guilty feelings, I decided to end the day early after the easiest walk in a couple weeks. I stopped at Heaven Hill Farm, a farm ""stand"" as big as a small supermarket. After eating lunch and hanging out with other hikers for a while, I discreetly took an Uber to the Quality Inn in Vernon, NJ. Most of my trail buds are going on to Wawayanda Shelter or the hiker-friendly drive-in theater in Warwick, NY. I was sorely tempted when Moonwalker and Fitbit encouraged me to meet them at the drive-in. (The drive-in has a tenting area for hikers.) For reasons I don't quite understand, I've connected with this couple who are almost young enough to be my grandkids.

Much as I don't like to admit it, my body is struggling. I had the energy to go on today, but my Achilles needed a break. I've been managing with minimal use of NSAIDs, but the pain has been increasing. I know that surgery is in my future, but finishing this hike is important to me.

It took more than an hour after that to get a ride to the trailhead. My Uber driver Dargelis treated me like a celebrity, insisting on taking a selfie with me. 

The hike itself began with the Stairway to Heaven. With 900 feet elevation gain, it was the first notable climb since Virginia. As the name suggests, much of consists of irregular stone steps placed by trail builders. While progress was slow, this type of climb is much easier and more enjoyable than a random rock jumble. Today was also the first time in a several weeks that I've climbed more than 3,000 feet in a day. 

Wildlife sighting: After more than four months on the trail, I finally saw a bear today. Within an hour, I saw a second one. Both were some distance away, and both ran off when I yelled at them. ""Go away, bear!"" usually does the trick.

 

I crossed the border into New York just after 2:00. I was happy with the accomplishment, but the terrain immediately got more difficult. I had taken a naproxen this morning. It seemed to work...at first. But by 3:00, my Achilles was sore, and I was dreading every rocky footstep. I've been taking a lot of zeros, and the terrain isn't getting any easier. I don't want this to end my hike. To be honest, I haven't been stretching as much as I should. I'm resolving to get back to my daily stretching routine. 

Encounters of note: I met and leapfrogged with Grillmaster today. He was at Bellevale Creamery when I arrived there around 5:00, and he wasn't far behind when I got to Wildcat Shelter at 7:00. Also at Wildcat Shelter were Black Hole and, to my surprise, Root Beer. I sat at the picnic table for a few minutes to eat and socialize, where I met Press, from New Orleans.

Today continued a string of sunny, warm, and humid days. The bugs were bad in still areas, less bothersome in the ridgeline breezes. 

Lake Tiorati, I thought, would be the highlight of the day. I envisioned eating my lunch on the beach, swimming in the lake, and enjoying a shower before resuming my hike. But it was Sunday. A sunny Sunday in July. When I arrived at 11:00, the parking lot was full, the small beach and swimming area were packed almost shoulder-to-shoulder, every picnic table had a crowd, and loud music seemed to be coming from everywhere. In short, it was overwhelming. 

I was trying to stay out of the crowd as I started to make my way back to the trail. That's when I noticed U-Turn was sitting on a shaded rock away from the beach. I joined him for lunch. In spite of my general disappointment, I appreciated the opportunity to fill my water bottles and to wash my hands with soap and water. 

Rogue and Bird leapfrogged me a couple times, but we didn't interact much. I saw perhaps three other thru-hikers, a few weekenders, and a dozen day hikers over the course of the day. I had expected to see far more. 

A special treat this afternoon were the views from Black Mountain. Seeing the New York City skyline from a backcountry vantage point is mind-boggling. Just a few minutes later, fine views of the Hudson River appeared. It looks gorgeous from up here.

 

The Appalachian Trail crosses Palisades Parkway. There's no bridge, not even a crosswalk. It's essentially jaywalking across an interstate highway. It's been that way for years, but after a hiker was killed while attempting the crossing, the ATC instituted a temporary detour that crosses the highway on a bridge. The detour adds 1.2 miles, not a big deal on a 2,200-mile hike. The big deal is that it bypasses a reliable water source, one if only two on today's itinerary. I chose to follow the original AT, as do, I suspect, most thru-hikers. Having lived and worked in Montréal, I've had some experience jaywalking in heavy traffic. 😉

The obvious place for me to camp was West Mountain Shelter. But it's 0.6 mile off trail, has no privy and no bear box. More importantly, its water source is dry. Instead, I chose to stealth camp a little farther up the trail. I'm glad I did. My tent is on a flat spot in a light breeze that keeps most of the bugs away. Nobody else is nearby. And just a few yards away is a rock outcrop with a spectacular view that takes in Bear Mountain and a slice of the Hudson. What a great place for dinner!

The trail up the back side was redesigned and rebuilt a few years ago. It's impressively well done, leaving natural features in place where it made sense and building new, durable features where necessary to reduce erosion--and, incidentally, rolled ankles. It's the most pleasurable 700-foot climb I've done in a long time. 

 

There weren't many tourists at the Bear Mountain summit on a Monday morning, but sitting on a bench looking out over the Hudson River was Guam. He's going off trail for a few days, and he was ahead of his ride. We chatted for a while and ambled down the steps on the front side of the mountain. He was planning to visit the big outdoor swimming pool at the foot of the mountain. It looked inviting, with only a few people in it on a sunny morning, but I opted to continue hiking. 

The next milestone on my trek was crossing the Hudson River. The trail does so on the sidewalk of the Bear Mountain Bridge. Unlike some other big bridges, it doesn't shake perceptibly when trucks pass. But it's long, it's high, and I needed to muster some courage to walk across. A work crew was doing maintenance on the outside and underside of the bridge. I stopped and exchanged a few words with a worker who was standing on a tiny ledge outside the railing. I smiled at the irony when he told me to stay safe on the rest of my hike. 

A few miles later, the Appalachian Deli is a must-stop for thru-hikers. It's located directly on the trail at a road crossing. In addition to the usual deli menu, they offer cafeteria-style meals (orange-ginger chicken with steamed veggies for me). Their convenience store section is well-stocked with hiker resupply items. Thru-hiker Dan, with whom I shared a picnic table while we ate, resupplied everything he needed for the next four days. 

I had initially thought of camping at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center. For decades, the Franciscans have welcomed hikers to tent on their ballfield. It's become a hiker favorite, with porta-potties, trash cans, a (cold) outdoor shower, and even electrical outlets. I got there early in the afternoon, I still had legs, and I had heard of an appealing-sounding stealth site ahead, so I kept going for a few more miles. 

My campsite is a true stealth site, not visible from the trail. It's flat, it seems to be quiet, and a breeze has kept most of the pesky insects at bay. I'm happy with my choice to hike a little farther today.

Soon after I arrived, I found Bebop and Nashvegas chatting with Goat Roper. I ate a burger and fries from the grill and then went down to the beach with Bebop and Nashvegas. The water was delightfully cool and refreshing on what is turning out to be the hottest hiking day so far. 

After swimming, I showered off the sand from the beach, ate a couple of ice cream treats, and got back on trail. The clothes that I had rinsed in the lake and dried in the sun were soaked through with perspiration within an hour. At least they don't stink as much as they did. 

A highlight of the afternoon was seeing electrical workers doing maintenance work on a tower supporting high-voltage transmission lines. They sounded remarkably nonchalant about the dangerous work they were doing.

Camping and hiking in the rain aren't always fun, but it's been so dry that water sources have become scarce. I'll need to carry 4 liters (8 lbs) of water the last three miles to tonight's campsite. 

We're in a congested part of the country. I heard traffic noise for the first four hours of hiking today. Traffic sounds came and went after that. The upside is that I passed another milestone: Interstate 84. Those Interstate numbers keep getting higher as I move north. 

Wrangler was sitting on a rock outcrop when I arrived at noon. I joined him for lunch while taking in the hazy view. Mapquest and Almost There came along and chatted with us for a while. Almost There likes to talk about how many miles Mapquest and he are walking, usually some number in the upper twenties. Funny thing is, I met them nine days ago and they still hadn't pulled ahead of me as of this morning. 

This afternoon, I arrived at Nuclear Lake. There was once a plutonium research facility on the shore, hence the name. Wrangler and I went for a swim, hoping we'd gain superpowers and not grow extra limbs. We also collected water, our last opportunity before Telephone Pioneers Shelter. 

The area surrounding Telephone Pioneers Shelter is poor for tenting. The tentsites are all sloped. I started to set up my tent on the least sloped spot. It was near the privy, and the odor prompted me to change my mind about tenting there. I packed up and hiked 300 yards back up the hill I had just descended.

I awoke with the birds around 5:00, but I still felt tired, so I went back to sleep for another hour and a half. The delayed start put me behind an ideal timeline for today's mileage and elevation gain. I like to arrive at the night's destination between 5:00 and 6:00. 

Given how sore my Achilles was yesterday and this morning, I took an Aleve just before setting out. The first few miles were flat and easy. The ""terrain"" consisted mostly of soft dirt, bog bridges, and boardwalks. 

After passing the Dover Oak (largest tree on the AT) and the Appalachian Trail train platform, I stopped into the Native Landscaping garden center. In addition to the usual plants, tools, and soil amendments, this garden center sells ice cream, freeze-dried meals, and other hiker essentials. I partook. 

Just before lunch, at Leather Hill Road, trail angel Chris had left a cooler full of ice-cold Gatorade. With the building heat and humidity, I welcomed the refreshment. Arriving at Wiley Shelter for lunch and a privy visit, I found Beebop and Nashvegas taking a break. We chatted for a while until they left. 

Shortly after lunch, I crossed into Connecticut. And just a few dozen yards beyond the state line, trail angel Jack was performing trail magic. I joined Beebop and Nashvegas for a beer and a hot dog. Also at the trail magic stop was trail maintainer Julia. She shared a wealth of information about the trail in CT, including recent updates on the status of upcoming water sources. 

Later in the afternoon, I caught up with Hillflower and Honey, whom I had last seen about two weeks ago. 

Schaghticoke Campsite is quite large and dispersed. That's fortunate because there were 10-12 tents set up by the time I arrived. Beebop and Nashvegas arrived later and set up near my tent. (They had detoured to a deli.) We enjoyed a companionable dinner together with only a few mosquitoes.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654760,"A hint of chill was in the air this morning. Bebop and Nashvegas will get ahead of me today. I've enjoyed their company, and I'm a little sad to see them go. 

Today was hero day for me. I took an Uber into Kent for a shower, laundry, and resupply. And then... I got back on trail. (Zero is a day with no trail miles. Nearo is is going into town for the night with ""nearly zero"" miles. Hero is going into town and getting back on trail the same day--it's more difficult than it sounds.) 

There were quite a few hikers around town, although I don't think many will stay the night. Prices here are geared toward visitors from NYC. 

After a restaurant lunch and a smoothie, I walked back to the trail. The total off-trail time was 3 1/2 hours. 

This afternoon's terrain didn't lack for variety. After some climbing and routine up-and-down, the trail dropped suddenly down a rugged scramble. It came as a bit of a shock after the mostly moderate climbs and descents since Lehigh Gap. The scramble was followed immediately by nearly five miles of flat, straight trail along the Housatonic River. A final, short climb (carrying water) took me to Silver Hill Campsite. The flat, open spot is pleasant, even more so because there aren't many mosquitoes. 

Notable encounters: - Chad is from Weaverville, NC and his sister lives just a few blocks from me. - Mapquest and Almost There were starting their day's hike when I met them at 9:30. ""Thirty-five today,"" he said. - Blackbeard seemed friendly, helpful, and smart. I'd like to get to know him better, but he's hiking significantly faster than I. - Sam and I ate dinner together. He's a sound engineer in the film industry. - Sunny Side and Mother Hen chatted with me for a few minutes after dinner. They're a not-quite-as-old-as-I-am pair who met on trail and have been hiking together for a while.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654822,"After an uneventful start to the morning, I came upon lunchtime trail magic from Whitecap and his daughter Zhuzha at West Cornwall Road. They had thru-hiked together last year, and they shared some valuable information in addition to the food. There, I had a chance to talk with Hummingbird (from Raleigh), who also shared some helpful camping info. 

The food and fellowship energized me. My pace increased after lunch. Mid-afternoon, I caught up with Rebecca, who is section hiking Connecticut. We stopped at a rock outcrop that overlooks part of Lime Rock Speedway. We saw a parking lot full of spectators' cars and heard a few engines revving occasionally in the distance, but there was no action on the track, of which we could see two corners. We walked on. Less than five minutes later, the race started. Although none of it was visible from the trail beyond the overlook, the sound carried for miles. 

Later, as I approached Falls Village, I encountered trail maintainer Julia, whom I had met the day before yesterday. Once again, she was full of helpful information. I learned from her where I could get a shower, fill my water bottles, and charge my phone. 

Tonight I'm camped on the lawn behind the former Toymakers Cafe in Falls Village. The cafe closed last year, but owners Anne and Greg still live in the building and welcome hikers to camp in their back yard. 

Mother Hen and Sunnyside are also camping here. We enjoyed dinner together at the nearby Falls Village Cafe.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654898,"Fireflies put on a spectacular display last night. Eight tents were crowded into a  limited section of Anne and Greg's back yard. I hadn't aligned my tent properly for the slope it was on, making for an uncomfortable night. I didn't sleep well. When I emerged to pee at 1:00 AM, I was treated to a light show in wooded area behind the tents. It seemed as if there was a flashing light on every square inch. I'd never seen such an intense firefly display!
There was no privy or portapotty on the property, and the small wooded area didn't offer much privacy for more than a quick pee. Knowing that I wouldn't get into a truly wooded area for a few miles, I packed up early this morning and started walking as quickly as I could, without breakfast or coffee. (When my bowels decide to move, they don't like to be kept waiting.)
A trash can beside Falls Village Cafe has been ransacked. I didn't see the crime, but I'm quite certain I saw the culprit. A large black bear was nonchalantly strolling across Main Street. Two hours later, in the woods, I saw another bear. They've been appearing in twos on this hike. 
I stopped for breakfast at a pleasant spot in the woods. Mother Hen and Sunnyside passed me while I was eating, and I haven't seen them since. Hummingbird and Cricket leapfrogged with me, and eventually they pulled ahead. At Cobble Road, I stopped and talked with Beebop and Nashvegas; I hadn't expected to catch up with them. They were waiting for a ride into Salisbury, where they're zeroing tomorrow. 
The trail turned in all directions  today. At one point I was walking south-southwest instead of north-northeast. The twists and turns did seem to have purpose. Rand's View offered a stunning picture of mountaintops emerging above a fog bank. Giant's thumb is a rock formation that looks like a--well, you know. On the highest point of the day, Bear Mountain, a huge pile of rocks provided a vantage point for a 360-degree view. While on the rock pile, I yogied a Lara Bar and some dried mango from three day hikers.

 
Late this afternoon, I realized I had pushed myself too hard today. I felt as if I had run out of energy as soon as I crossed into Massachusetts. The terrain got rocky, I got tired, and I went into defensive mode: watching every step, trying to protect my left Achilles tendon. The last couple miles were no fun. I was exhausted. It didn't help that the trail passed very close to the edge of a cliff: my acrophobia kicked in, which didn't help my breathing. I was glad to see Race Brook Falls Campsite.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654902,"What a difference attitude makes! After a good night's sleep (I was alone at the campsite), I awoke with a much-improved outlook. The rain predicted for 2:00 PM started at 7:00 AM. And the terrain was just as tough as yesterday's, with the added problem of slippery footing on wet rocks. Yet I felt great. (Full disclosure: a shorter day, coffee with breakfast, and Aleve before hiking may have contributed to my attitude shift.)
The hiking began with a tough climb up Mount Everett. The steep, slippery rocks required more time and attention than usual, but I felt I had plenty of both to offer. I reached the Guilder Pond trailhead after 9:00. Cato, Out'n About, Grillmaster, and a couple others were there, ""getting a slow start"" with the help of a friend with a car. It was good to catch up with them, however briefly. They offered me Gatorade, and I filled my water bottles from their jug. That's the kind of trail magic I find is truly magical: there's nothing planned about it; it just happens as if by magic.

Drizzle fell all morning, but I didn't unfurl my umbrella. The coolness of the rain just about perfectly offset the warm temperature. The rain seemed to end at about the time I entered a big bog filled with hemlocks. The bog was eerie with high topiary and mist among the tree trunks. I would have lingered to take it all in, but it was swarming with aggressive mosquitoes, so I stopped only to apply more insect repellent. 

 

I had made arrangements with shuttle driver Joe to pick me up at the trailhead and drive me to the Quality Inn in Great Barrington. When I gave him an ETA, he texted me that I might find trail magic about a mile before the trailhead. Instead of asking me to set a precise time, he told me to text him as I was leaving. Very nice guy! The trail magic was a huge affair under an awning that stays up all season. Two church groups take turns running the trail magic six days a week. I appreciated the food, fellowship, and dryness of the shelter for a half hour before texting Joe and hiking to where he was waiting. 

Once in town, I checked in, napped, strolled around downtown, and ate dinner. It was soon hiker midnight.

He has a masters degree in environmental engineering, specializing in air quality and climate change. I've enjoyed our few brief conversations. His target finish date suggests that he'll pull ahead of me in the coming days. 

At lunch, I ran into Out and About, Kado, and Grillmaster. They'll be back on trail this afternoon, a half day ahead of me. They're fun and funny, so I hope to see them again. 

Great Barrington, in the heart of the Berkshires, is a fairly large, touristy town. There are lots of chickens shops and expensive restaurants, but not much geared toward hikers. The ""outfitter"" sells only outfits, no gear. It's probably worth mentioning that two recreational cannabis dispensaries are located downtown. 

The rest of my day was filled with the mundane chores of a zero day: planning, resupply, and laundry. The latter was washed in the bathtub and dried in front of the air conditioner, as the only laundromat in Great Barrington went out of business during the height of the pandemic. 
My body appreciated the break. I have appreciably fewer aches and pains than I did a day ago. * * * PHOTOS REMINDER * * *There is, or will be, a photo for each day in this journal.

Just over a mile after starting, trail angel Steady Stream was setting up trail magic in the woods near a road crossing. I sat and chatted with him while enjoying a fresh croissant and a Pepsi. He's a regular section hiker. He's also a violin maker and repairer. It was interesting to learn just a little about his vocation. 
The terrain was varied, including farm fields, beaver ponds, bogs, and a few climbs. The vegetation has changed noticeably in the past week or so. Hemlocks, birches, and maples have become more prevalent. Even the smells seem different. 
Another, somewhat bigger, trail magic awaited at MA 23. Paul and his son were hosting. Several other hikers were there, including Wrangler. Cold Gatorade, cold fruit, and cold beer hit the spot. It was tough to leave. 
I'm tenting tonight at North Mt. Wilcox Shelter. The shelter itself appears to have suffered the effects of some decades of deferred maintenance. That's not a problem for me when I'm tenting. The site has a few flat tent spaces, a bear box, a privy, and a water source close by. Oh, and mosquitoes. Lots of mosquitoes. 
Nobody else was here when I arrived at 6:00. I was prepared for, even looking forward to, a night alone in the woods. Sometime after 7:00, Sunnyside and Mother Hen arrived. We didn't talk much since they wanted to set up for the night and I wanted to get into the protection that my tent provides from mosquitoes.

Before leaving, I put baskets on my poles to make them more effective in mud. The mud has started before Vermont! 

A little before noon, I reached Jerusalem Road. Just a few yards down the road was an unattended ""trail stand."" In addition to shelves of snack items, the tiny stand contained a fridge and freezer with drinks and ice cream sandwiches. All was sold on the honor system. There were also trash cans and a power strip for charging mobile devices. I joined Mother Hen, Sunnyside, Zen, and Jetski at the picnic table for early lunch. 

 

My destination for the day was Upper Goose Pond Cabin. The cabin is owned by the National Park Service and operated as a shelter by the Appalachian Mountain Club. It's located on a picture-perfect pond. I arrived early so I could enjoy the place. I swam for about twenty minutes in the clear water. Shepherd and I then paddled around the pond in one of two canoes on the property. Later, a dozen of us gathered around the picnic table for a leisurely dinner and conversation. One of the hikers played mandolin in the background. It was the largest gathering of thru-hikers I'd witnessed since southern Virginia. It was also one of the most social. Only about a third of those who start in Georgia make it this far, so there's some mutual respect and camaraderie among thru-hikers at this point.

As the second hiker in, I chose an upper bunk next to a large screened window. Even so, I found it very hot and stuffy...especially when the wind died after the storm had passed. 
I was out of my bunk shortly after 5:00. Nobody else was stirring, so I headed down to the dock. The surface of the pond was as smooth as glass. I admired the view for a few minutes before going in for a swim. Since the dock was out of sight from the cabin, I peeled off my clothes and skinnydipped. The water was at that perfect temperature: refreshing without being cold. 
The caretakers serve coffee and pancakes at 6:00. The easy, convivial vibe from last night was rekindled at community breakfast this morning. It felt good to be part of the thru-hiking community, especially in such a beautiful setting. Eventually, and with some regret, I said farewell to caretakes Kathy and John, and I started walking. 
Another significant milestone passed when I crossed the Mass Pike (I-90) on a footbridge. A car horn tooted, and I waved back. The driver probably didn't see my wave, but it felt fun to do.
The Cookie Lady was a fixture on the AT. Her house on Blueberry Hill near Washington, MA was only a few yards off the trail. Trail legend has it that when she died a few years ago, her will stipulated that her house be sold to someone who would carry on the tradition of baking cookies for hikers. Today, sure enough, there is a Cookie Lady 2.0. I enjoyed a couple of homemade chocolate chip cookies, a glass of ice-cold hibiscus lemonade, and a serving of blueberries that I picked from her bushes. (She also runs a self-pick blueberry business.) The place is extremely hiker-friendly with a relaxed, hippy feel. There's well water to fill water bottles, outlets and chargers for phones, lawn chairs, and even a portapotty. I left a few bucks in the donation box and headed on. 
I reached Kay Wood Shelter at 6:00, just early enough to secure a premium tent spot. (There aren't many tent here, and most are significantly sloped.) Five more hikers rolled in not long after I did. Once again, Sunnyside and Mother Hen are tenting close to me.

My decision to nearo and overnight here feels like a mistake. I'm staying out of town to be near shopping, but I realize now that with only two on-trail nights before Bennington, VT, I could have resupplied adequately at Cumberland Farms and continued on today. The Econo Lodge is a dump, and the shopping center that looked close on the map is nearly a mile walk away because the roads detour around a river. I was looking forward to a shower and clean clothes, but I'd rather be dirty in the woods right now. On a positive note, the short hiking distance today will give my Achilles a chance to recover.

Yesterday, I wasn't able to retrieve the box until after I shopped for food. As a result, I seem to have enough food for a week even though I'm planning to spend only two nights on trail before my next resupply. My food bags are bulging and my pack is heavy. 
There were no Uber or Lyft drivers available this morning. Hitching to the trailhead wasn't practical, either. So I walked the 2.2 miles through town. It was hot. A heat advisory is in effect for the day, and the heat index was already 89 degrees when I reached the trailhead. It felt good to get into the woods. Although it remained hot and humid, an increasing breeze made it a little more bearable. 
Just before lunch, I met an engaging young couple at Gore Pond. Will, from Boston, and Shay, from Toronto, met on a backpacking trip in Guatemala. We chatted for a while, and they took the photo accompanying this journal entry. They're leaving the trail today. 
After climbing up and over North Mountain, the trail dropped down into the small town of Cheshire. It felt much more welcoming to hikers than Dalton was. An AT notice board sits prominently on Main Street. I took a short break to quaff a Gatorade that a trail angel had left in a cooler beside the notice board. Just two blocks farther, I saw tents, chairs, and people at the far end of a parking lot. Somebody called, ""Hey, KJ! C'mon! It's hiker picture time!"" I dropped my pack and slid into the group of smelly thru-hikers.  Pacemaker's mom Holly introduced herself after the photo shoot. She had produced the large-scale trail magic. It looked as if she had also made it a large family gathering to welcome Pacemaker. I ate and drank like a hiker while appreciating the shade of the three big gazebo-style tents. 

 
Beebop was at the trail magic, while Nashvegas was visiting a nearby outfitter. They, along with Sprinkles and several others, are tenting tonight at the town camping field. (There's no town camping field in Dalton.) The heat and humidity didn't make the town camping field seem appealing. Besides, it was still early after I had eaten my fill. I thanked the hosts and headed up the trail toward Mark Noepel Shelter. 
About a mile and a half from the shelter, I heard voices approaching from behind. I wanted to sleep in my tent rather than in the shelter, and I knew there were only four tent spots available. I accelerated so they wouldn't pass me. They still seemed to be gaining on me, so I picked up my pace even more. By the time I reached the shelter, I was drained. Nine young campers were talking around a smoldering fire. Happily, though, there were still two nice-looking tent pads available. I picked one and set up. The two hikers behind me came in, took a quick look, and decided to hike on. I chatted with the campers over a light dinner, and then later with SOBO hiker Jedediah when he arrived.

Jedediah, who thought he'd be alone in the shelter, had his night interrupted. He was grumpy in the morning. I was more fortunate: the interior of my tent stayed completely dry, and I was far enough from the excitement that I didn't hear it. 
This morning, it didn't start raining until I'd been walking for an hour. Up went the umbrella. I crossed the summit of Mount Greylock and then dropped into the Thunderbolt ski run warming hut. (The hut is a fairly large building constructed by the CCC.) Pacemaker, Jaywalking Jesus, and another hiker were inside. A ranger had granted them specual permission to sleep there last night because the thunderstorm constituted an emergency. After snacking and chatting for a few minutes, I headed back out. 

 
The rain intensified. My umbrella made it bearable. I crossed a Ridgerunner who was out doing trail maintenance in the rain: that's dedication!
The rain let up around noon. Thousands of tiny toads covered the trail. Some were perhaps a quarter-inch long, others even smaller. They were skittish and moved too quickly for still photos. 
The trail cuts though a suburban residential section of North Adams. At an AT information kiosk, there were coolers full of drinks, snacks, and miscellaneous supplies. And, timed perfectly, the sun appeared. I supplemented the lunch in my backpack with some of the trail magic.

For better or worse, I had a relatively short and easy day into Bennington for my weekly scheduled zero day tomorrow. My Achilles appreciated the lighter effort. 

Unusually, I was one of the first to leave camp this morning. By ones and twos, the other NOBOs passed me this morning. Being the slowest hiker in a group is something I have difficulty accepting. I'm accustomed to being the fastest, or among the fastest, without really trying. I need to get my head around the idea that I'm no longer hiking with average hikers. After 1,600+ miles, most thru-hikers are approaching the limit of what their bodies can do. And my body is much older than most. Perhaps that limit is what bothers me the most. I don't like facing the fact that my aging body is no longer capable of what it once was. 

Congdon Shelter sits right on the trail, across from a big stream.

Some hypotheses: The Long Trail, which the AT follows for the southernmost 105 miles in Vermont, is older than the AT, and much of it was built before modern trail design techniques had been developed. But I've also noticed that there aren't as many bog bridges in VT as there were in CT and MA. There's not as much signage, nor as many blazes, either. And there are fewer signs of recent trail maintenance, including removal of blowdowns. All these differences probably contribute in varying degrees to the Vermud moniker. That said, the trail somehow feels more wild and natural here than it does in some other states. I'll try to keep that in mind the next time my foot sinks in ankle-deep.

It was 9:00 when I started walking, somewhat disappointed that I wasn't going to make my stretch target for the day. That all changed later. 
The trail started with a thousand-foot climb, which felt relatively easy after my day off. My energy level stayed high, and I made good time through Glastenbury Wilderness and up Glastenbury Mountain. I even mustered the courage to climb the lookout tower on Glastenbury Mountain. 
Not seeing any nice-looking lunch spots on the way, I stopped at Goddard Shelter for a late lunch. While I was eating, resting, and chatting with SOBOs, a fifteen-minute rainshower passed over. Sunshine soon returned, and I continued on my way. 
I reached Kid Gore Shelter at 4:30. Tent sites were few and mostly uninviting: rocky and sloped. I was tempted to go on, but it would have meant arriving quite late. Another consideration was the weather: although it was sunny when I arrived, the forecast was calling for severe thunderstorms after 4:00. I finally settled on a spot near the shelter. I set up for the night and walked up to the picnic table for dinner with a couple of Lomg Trail hikers. Thunder, which had been rumbling in the distance, intensified. Within minutes, rain started to fall, and we moved inside. It rained heavily for nearly an hour. Nashvegas and Beebop arrived with Longhorn, and we caught up on each other's adventures the last few days. Later, after the rain stopped, Mother Hen and Sunnyside showed up, looking bedraggled.

At lunch, I noticed what looked liked a small tick attached to my leg. I extracted it with tweezers and dropped it into a clean baggie. From all sides, it looked to me like a black splinter or thorn. Longhorn, with younger and sharper eyes, examined it and agreed that it wasn't a tick. Relief! 

Summiting Stratton Mountain was the highlight of the afternoon. It wasn't so much the climb or the view from the fire lookout tower, but the historical significance. It was at this summit that Benton MacKaye conceived of what has become the Appalachian Trail. That thought merited a few minutes of reflection. 

From the mountain, it was a rocky but easy descent to Stratton Pond Shelter. The shelter itself is huge, with a capacity of 20 on many bunks and an oversized loft over the picnic table. Nearby were at least a dozen tent spots. I arrived early enough to find a flat one. 

Beebop and Nashvegas joined me for dinner. OG, a SOBO joined in. He was so talkative and so loud that conversation became nearly impossible until he left. A pleasant caretaker came by, introduced the facilities and the rules, and collected $5 per person. She said that NOBO thru-hikers have a certain look that makes them easy for her to identify. (She didn't elaborate on what that look is.) 

Many other hikers are here tonight, including NOBOs, SOBOs, Long Trail hikers, and weekenders. Mother Hen and Sunnyside also arrived quite late.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655659,"One of the pleasures of long-distance hiking is not having a set wake-up time. Today, for me, was an exception. I had a lot to cram into the day. I woke to the alarm at 4:30, took down my tent, retrieved my food from the bear box, and walked a quarter-mile to Stratton Pond. 

I had an ideal vantage point to watch dawn come over the pond. As I ate breakfast and drank my coffee, I heard the call of a loon. It's an almost haunting sound, one that I hadn't heard in a long time. It was hard to tear myself away. 

About ten miles into the hike, not too far from the Manchester Center trailhead, I met Neon and his wife LJ. They had parked and started walking toward me so we'd meet on the trail. This is the third time Neon has joined me during this adventure. He's going to hike with me for the next four days. 

With generosity and patience, Neon and LJ helped me get through my in-town activities: shower, eat pizza, buy socks, launder clothes, buy food, repackage food, repack, change into hiking clothes, and eat ice cream. 

The three of us hiked the two miles up to Bromley Shelter. The only good tenting options near the shelter were on platforms. A tent platform is usually an 8-foot by 8-foot wooden deck with no railings. Neon and I are both using trekking pole tents, which are tricky to set up on wooden platforms. 

LJ. Neon, and I enjoyed dinner together at the smallest shelter picnic table I've seen. Then, while Neon walked LJ back to the car, I hung a bear line (on the first throw!) and collected water for both of us. It was nearly 9:00, and well past dark, when Neon got back to the shelter area.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655719,"Perhaps it was the excitement of meeting and hiking with Neon again. The pressure of quickly heroing through town probably contributed, too. Whatever the cause, I slept until 6:40 this morning. That's the latest I've slept in a long time. 
Today, the trail took us over the summit of Bromley Mountain, through Peru Peak Wilderness, past Griffith Lake, and through Big Branch Wilderness, all within Green Mountain National Forest. Under a sunny sky, Bromley Mountain provided 360-degree views, which have been rare recently. 

 
By the time I reached Peru Peak Shelter for lunch, Neon had already eaten. Sunnyside and Mother Hen ate with me at the picnic table, and I chatted with two young caretakers who were taking a break nearby. (The Green Mountain Club employs caretakers to manage some of the heavily-used shelters and campsites in Vermont.) 
Our next stop was Griffith Lake, just a half mile later. I enjoyed swimming in the cool, clear water for fifteen minutes or so. Neon took a quick dip, too. Sunnyside and Mother Hen rinsed some clothing but didn't get in the water. 
The last stretch of hiking was through Big Branch Wilderness. There, I met, leapfrogged, and chatted with fellow NOBO thru-hiker Fancy Feast. She was a line cook turned CPA, certainly an unusual career path. 
For dinner tonight, Neon treated me to a yummy meal of shrimp and grits that he had prepared and dehydrated at home. I've enjoyed his dehydrated veggies quite often on the trail; this was the first full entrée. It was a nice change from my usual trail fare. It was especially nice that he had carried it in his pack!
Because Neon has commitments beyond the trail, we're hiking to a schedule, albeit a flexible one. I realized early this evening that I'd planned an excessively long day for tomorrow. During dinner rehydration time, we came up with a better plan. We both feel better that we don't need to hike 19+ miles tomorrow!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655718,"Even experienced hikers make mistakes. At least this one does. Today's was costly. Hiking along a wide, heavily-used trail this afternoon, I missed a turn and continued down a steep grade until I reached a big parking area and picnic ground. That's when I realized my error, and I climbed back up the slope I had descended, looking for the turn I had missed. When I got back to the trail junction, I found it clearly marked with a sign and appropriate blazes. My lack of attention cost me nearly a mile, a steep climb back up, and some pride. (Note: Distances recorded above are trail miles, not miles walked, so the additional mile today isn't counted in the total.) 

The day had started on a good note. Unusually, there were almost no bird calls at dawn. Perhaps mating season is over in this area. Neon and I both woke up early anyway. Not unusually, he left camp before I did. 

I caught up with him at Little Rock Pond, where he had stopped. It was a pleasant place to take a break and eat a snack. The temperature was in the sixties, a breeze was blowing, and the beach area was still shaded at 10:00 AM, so I wasn't tempted to swim. I did see some salamanders going about their business in the shallows. 

 

Later, on White Rocks Mountain, the trail passed two ""rock gardens"", each consisting of dozens of piles of balanced stones. Trail legend has it that they were built by gnomes. Occasionally, somebody knocks them down, but the gnomes soon go about rebuilding them. 

I had been ahead of Neon since the pond, but thanks to my navigation error, he arrived at our planned lunch stop beside Bully Brook before I did. Being very patient and knowing that I sometimes take blue-blaze detours, he waited for me. I had to swallow some pride and tell him about my ""unintentional"" blue blaze. Since he finished lunch before I did, he started out with plans to stop for the night at Minerva Hinchey Shelter. Following a few minutes behind Neon, I came upon a big trail magic spread by Spineless Cougar. By the time I arrived, all the other hikers there seemed to know about my goof. (My mistake deserved the attention it got.)

The day's hike ended with a long, hot climb from the parking lot to the shelter. Neon impressed me with his stamina. After we arrived, he threw a bear line and collected water for both of us. 

Hiker news: - At trail magic, I met Barista and Blue Pack, a young couple from Montreal - Beebop and Nashvegas camped with us tonight - Mother Hen and Sunnyside are one shelter ahead - Root Beer is about two days ahead.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655815,"Today's learning: I can still climb. 
Neon left the campsite about 20 minutes before I did. Furthering the delay, I stopped to take in a view of the Rutland airport. Because the overlook is some distance away, what I heard was out if sync with what I saw. A plane landed. Once it had slowed and turned onto a taxiway, I heard the reverse thrusters roar. A porcupine nearby provided another distraction. 
Neon was waiting patiently in Clarenton Gorge. I swam briefly in the cold water of a swimming hole. I didn't stay in very long, but it was nice to rinse off some of the grime. The climb out of the gorge was steep but not too long. 
At a Upper Cold River Road, a trail angel had left a cooler of fresh garden vegetables. As I was eating a handful of snap peas, Koneho, Sunnyside, and Mother Hen walked up. Koneho and I walked and talked together for several miles. 
The climb up Killington amounted to 2,400 vertical feet. It was the tallest climb since Three Ridges in Virginia. Koneho and I talked as we climbed. Around 3,000 feet, the forest changed to evergreens, predominantly hemlock. We fell into a comfortable silence to appreciate the sights, sounds, and smells that surrounded us. 
Arriving at the shelter clearing, I saw three tent platforms, none occupied. I started to set up on one and spread a bunch of gear on another to ""hold"" it for Neon. (Holding or reserving a space for someone else is frowned upon in the hiking community, where the rule is first come, first served. ) Fortunately, Neon was next to arrive. He's been hiking strongly. 
We ate at a picnic table inside the shelter with Mother Hen, Sunnyside, Koneho, Hill Flower, Honey, and a couple others. It's hard to believe that tomorrow will be the last day of Neon's section hike.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655814,"After an early breakfast, several of us hiked the steep quarter-mile from the campsite to the summit of Killington. The sky was clear, and the view was breathtaking. To the north, the Green Mountains stretched seemingly to infinity. But more imposing, in the far distance to the east, stood the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The thought of scaling those was daunting. 
The day's hike was mostly downhill, but this being the AT, there was some climbing, too. The trail, although steep and rocky in sections, offered a pretty transition from conifers near the summit to birches and maples at lower elevations. 
Just before lunch came a real treat and the highlight of my day. I heard something large rustling in the woods. It sounded too big to be a deer, and it didn't sound like a bear. I'm not sure who was more startled: me or the bull moose. He immediately ran a few yards farther away, and then he paused to look back at me. We stared at each other through the trees for a few seconds before he ambled away. What a treat!
I caught up with Neon soon after the moose sighting. We stopped for lunch at Maine Junction, where the Appalachian Trail splits from the Long Trail. The LT continues north to the Quebec border, whereas the AT turns (more or less) east into New Hampshire and, eventually, Maine. The two trails are blazed identically, so there are lots of stories of hikers who took the wrong trail. We didn't. 

 
We reached the trailhead at VT Route 100 early this afternoon. This marks the end of Neon's hike with me. It also marks the completion of a major AT accomplishment for him: with this hike, he has backpacked in each of the 14 states that the Appalachian Trail traverses!
We reached the trailhead just after Sunnyside and Mother Hen. Mother Hen's husband Seven is visiting in a rented conversion van, supporting her hike. He drove us into downtown Rutland from the trailhead. LJ met us there and then drove Neon and me to the Hampton Inn, on the other side of town. After showers and laundry, the three of us (Neon, LJ, and I) went out for dinner and ice cream to celebrate Neon's accomplishment. It was well past hiker midnight when I got back to my room.

Adding insult to injury, my ride to the trailhead (Kemp's Rideshare) arrived 30 minutes late with the lame excuse that he needed to buy gas. My hike started at Gifford Woods State Park, where I took advantage of the last flush toilet I'd see in a few days. The boldness of a resident chipmunk convinced me not to leave my pack unattended outdoors, even for a minute. 
 
At Maine Junction, the AT made a sharp right turn from north to east. That generally eastward direction continued today, as it will for the next several days. The walk started on flat, heavily-used trail around Kent Pond and Thundering Falls (which were spilling, not thundering, today). Some day users were out walking in thisbarea, many with their dogs. The easy part ended with the traverse of a wetland on a really nice boardwalk. After that, it was up and down for the rest of the day--no long climbs, but always going up or down, much like the Roller Coaster in northern Virginia. 
I didn't see many other hikers beyond the flat, easy area. Six or eight SOBOs crossed me during the day, but I didn't see any other NOBOs or weekenders. 
I tented at Winturri Shelter. Yak, age 33, arrived shortly after I did. He's the first yo-yo hiker I've met. He started at Springer in January, hiked NOBO to Katahdin, and is now hiking back to Springer.  ""I just love this trail,"" he said.

Perspiration had soaked through the sleeping bag liner, so even my sleeping bag was wet from my sweat. I have some stuff to dry out! I've experienced night sweats occasionally, but this was probably the worst instance I've ever had. I wonder what caused it. Today was a hot one, with heat index values above 90 degrees, even at trail elevations. Given the predicted heat and the spacing of potential campsites, I decided to hike a relatively short day. Not long after a late start, I made a short detour on VT Route 12 to On the Edge Farmstand. There, I ate carrots, tomatoes, a huge muffin, and of course, a pint of ice cream. It was hard to pull my body off the chair on the shady porch to resume hiking in the heat.

The terrain for the last couple days has been reminiscent of the Roller Coaster in northern Virginia: a few hundred feet up, followed by a few hundred feet down, over and over. It's tougher than it sounds, a bit like interval training. 

It rained twice this afternoon. The first downpour was heavy and long-lasting. The trail became a stream, and Vermud lived up to its moniker. The second rainfall, although heavy, was shorter and less intense than the first. Even with my umbrella deployed, I was soaked by the time I reached Thistle Hill Shelter. Fortunately, the rain had stopped when I reached the campsite, so the interior of my tent stayed dry as I set up.  Thru-hiker Not Bob is tenting nearby. Two weekenders and a SOBO are in the shelter.

Soon after starting, I came to an open area full of wild blackberry bushes. I gathered and ate a few handfuls of sweet, tart, juicy fruit. What a treat! 

The trail dropped down to cross the White River. Jumping into the river from the thirty-foot-high bridge is a popular dare for thru-hikers. I managed to walk across the bridge safely without falling off. (In other words, I chickened out.) 

With no afternoon rain to cool things down, today turned out to be hotter than yesterday. I was sweating heavily by 10:00. The last three miles were roadwalk through Norwich, VT and Hanover, NH. The trail bypassed the commercial section of Norwich. Hanover is an Ivy League college (Dartmouth) town. The trail skirts the campus and goes through the center of town. Commencement took place yesterday, and the town was packed with people. Most of the shops and restaurants were upscale and busy. I was nearing exhaustion, not in the mood for a slow, table-service meal or gourmet food shopping.

I was looking forward to a short hike on such a hot day, especially as my Achilles flared up painfully almost as soon as I started. Unfortunately, the water source at that shelter was dry, as were several others. Given my water-carrying capacity of four liters, I couldn't figure out how to get to the next source with an overnight at Moose Mountain Shelter. The next best option was to press on to Trapper John Shelter. 
Thru-hikers Honey, Hill Flower, and Fudge Stripe leapfrogged with me for a while. Honey, who hikes in sandals, got a nasty cut in his foot early in the day. He and Hill Flower decided to stop very early to give the cut a chance to heal. 

At Goose Pond Road, just before a final 1,100' climb, trail angel Chuck was waiting with comfy chairs, cold Cokes, and plenty of water. I was overheated, drenched in sweat, and exhausted. I sat for twenty minutes, resting and cooling off. The final climb was tough, and I'm hugely grateful that Chuck had been at the right place at the right time.

Better still, the yellow jackets left me alone this morning. Last evening, on the side trail to Moose Mountain Shelter, I was stung by a yellow jacket. Two others at the shelter also got stings. I watched carefully for them on my way back to the trail this morning, but I didn't see, hear, or feel any. 

Just over an hour after I started, not long after the rain ended, I stepped off the trail to visit the Ice Cream Man. Like the Cookie Lady, the original Ice Cream Man passed away, but the owners of the house have continued the tradition of offering ice cream and a place to sit on the side porch. 

Most of the day I spent hiking up, along and down Smarts Mountain. After eating lunch at the summit, I climbed to the penultimate level of the fire tower atop the mountain. The hazy 360-degree views were inspiring. 

Early this afternoon, I realized I'd need to cut back my planned mileage for the day. The tendinitis in my left Achilles has been growing increasingly painful. Even after talking an Aleve this morning, every step on my left foot was unpleasant, ranging from mild discomfort to acute pain. As in the rocky section of Pennsylvania, I needed to watch every foot placement. Inattention or misjudgement was punished by soreness.

On the north slope of Mount Cube, I encountered a trail crew from the Dartmouth Outing Club (DOC) who were building three sets of stone steps. It was informative (and impressive) to see the work involved in building stone steps. I thanked them for their work and told then how much I've appreciated stone steps over the past five months. 

 

Taking a lunch break at Ore Hill Campsite, I met Hodge and Podge from Charleston, SC. The young couple is hiking a 300-plus-mile LASH, including the Whites and Southern Maine.

And although it wasn't noisy, a skunk sprayed nearby, which didn't help getting back to sleep. I started the day with a little extra coffee and little excitement about starting into the White Mountains. 

For $5, the Hikers Welcome Hostel transported a bag of my heavy gear (tent, sleeping bag, etc.) to the Inn 32 motel in North Woodstock, where I'm staying tonight.

The climb up the south side of Moosilauke was long and unrelenting, but it wasn't especially difficult. I babied my Achilles by careful foot placement, and it rewarded me by not complaining too much. 

The forest thinned to balsam firs, and eventually petered out completely. The views, even with some clouds, were stunning. Part of me wanted to stay longer, but it was chilly (mid-50s and windy), and I didn't want to miss my ride by not keeping up.

To the hikers finishing up their thru-hikes I speak directly to you. As much as you want to get to Katahdin. As much as you’re ready for this to be over. As much as you miss your bed and your family. Savor. Every. Moment. This trail has changed you. You might not realize it but it has, in many ways. Once you get off and return home everything is great. Home cooked meals, time with your pet and significant other. Weeks goes by and you start to miss it. Miss what exactly? It’s hard to say. The simplicity, the beauty, the difficulty and the struggles. sure walking in the rain sucks but you’ll miss it. Walking up a mountain isn’t always something you’ll want to do. you’ll miss it. You’ll miss walking 10 miles by noon. Getting to camp at the end of a day and setting up your home, cooking dinner and filtering water. All while dirt and mud cake your legs, you smell and you’re exhausted. You’ll miss it and want it back. I’ve been off the AT for 11 months now and not a day goes by where I don’t think of it. Not a morning goes by where I stand in front of my closet and I have to decide what to wear. I’m forever grateful for my time on the AT but I miss it more than I ever missed something. A part of me is missing and I’m different since I returned home. I see people for what they are. I see what matters and doesn’t. I see myself longing to be back out there. I’m depressed. It happens. I thought I was prepared for off trail life and I’m not. This trail has caused me harm. It’s fucked me up in some ways. I just want you all to be prepared for it. It’s not easy.

Nashvegas and Beebop arrived at about the same time as I did. We chatted for a while before setting out. They hike faster than I do, and I didn't see them the rest of the day. 

Kinsman Mountain was the main feature of the day. The trail was much more rugged than the elevation gain alone would suggest. The footing was tricky and there were several challenging scrambles.

That kept me awake longer than I would have liked, but once they settled, I fell asleep quickly and slept soundly. 

Two miles after starting, I arrived at Lonesome Lake Hut. My thru-hiker pass entitled me to a pastry (left over from last night) and washing my hands in a sink with soap. It was hard to tear myself away from the hat's dock/deck on the shore of Lonesome Lake. 

 

Today, as the numbers show, was a short hiking day. The only other option was to cross notoriously difficult Franconia Ridge at the end of a 15-mile day. Given the ruggedness of the terrain, that would have put me in camp very late, exhausted, and possibly in pain from tendinitis. I'm happy with what I did. I'm still adjusting to my new shoes, and it felt good to arrive in camp with time to tend to some gear issues without feeling rushed. Setting up my trekking-pole tent on a wooden platform platform is a skill I'm still developing. 

Holy Roller, Red Panda, and Lookout are on the next platform. They seem to be on pace with me. I saw Honey, Hill Flower, Nashvegas, and Beebop today, but they've gone ahead.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656522,"Today, when I really needed it, my Achilles came through for me. The hiking was as tough as it was spectacular. The ascents were strenuous, sometimes technical. The descents, often on slick, wet rocks, verged on dangerous. I move well on rock, even by thru-hiker standards. Yet several times today, I needed to stash my trekking poles so I could use both hands for climbing. 
Franconia Ridge was the day's highlight, with above-treeline scrambling and gorgeous long-distance views. It felt as if I was looking down on the world. The summit of ""lofty"" Cannon Mountain was far below. The weather, with dry air, light winds, and temperatures in the 50s, was ideal for hiking and viewing from mounts Liberty, Haystack, Lincoln, and Lafayette. 
Next up after Franconia Ridge--and it was up--came Garfield Ridge. While not as high or imposing as Franconia, Garfield was gorgeous, too, offering great views of the mountains I had just climbed.
  

I took a late-afternoon break at Galehead Hut. It was fun to see the thru-hiker Sparkles, a high school band director, get so excited when he landed a work-for-stay (WFS) spot at the hut. Each hut has a nightly maximum of two WFS slots available for thru-hikers. Getting one can be tricky. Walk in the door before 4:00 PM, and you'll be sent on your way. After 4:00 PM, the available WFS slots may be taken. 
From my seat on the hut's porch, South Twin Mountain looked daunting. The late-day climb turned out to be arduous but not dangerous. Looking back to the west from the summit, I got a great view of Franconia Ridge silhouetted against the clouds obscuring the setting sun. It looked mystical.

The next and final challenge of the day was finding a place to sleep. The summit of South Twin Mountain, above treeline, wasn't an option. I had carried enough water to stealth camp, but I didn't see an appealing spot. While scanning, I spotted Beebop and Nashvegas hunkered down in the woods. I wandered over and chatted for a while, but there was no open ground nearby to pitch a tent. 

Shortly after resuming my search for a campsite, thru-hikers G-Unit (a couple) and Smiles passed me, all of us vying for a stealth spot. The time was getting late, and I was feeling tired. The chances finding suitable places for all of us to tent within the next mile or two seemed slim. I opted to walk nearly a mile off-trail to Guyot Shelter and its associated campground, knowing that I'd find room in the large shelter if all the tent spots were full. Fortunately, I landed the last unoccupied tent platform, set up as quickly as I could, ate supper, and got to bed around 9:00. 

It had taken me 12 hours to hike 13 miles (14 miles counting the off-trail mile to the shelter). That's slow going. Yes, there were a few short breaks during the day, but no more than usual. In fact, I thought I had kept up a strong pace most of the day. The terrain has been that difficult.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656571,"I awoke just before dawn. My tent platform and the campsite ""dining area"" provided a beautiful view of the sun rising through the trees. I intended to get started early, but no matter how much I try to be efficient, it still takes me two-plus hours from waking to walking. It's a little frustrating to be among the first to rise yet among the last to leave camp. 
It was chilly overnight above 4,000 feet, but the sun warmed things quickly. For the first time in four days, I started in shorts. The sun gave me a boost of energy for the first climb of the day, to Mount Guyot. On the long blue-blaze from the campsite, an open view above tree line provided my first glimpse of Mount Washington. It was clear enough to see the antennas on the summit. 
After Mount Guyot, the hiking was more downhill than up. By the time I reached Zealand Falls Hut a little before 11:00, clouds had rolled in. As usual, a few day hikers and overnight hut guests were lingering near the hut. Inside the hut, my AMC thru-hiker pass entitled me to a generous piece of delicious coffee cake. I washed it down with two small cups of coffee and continued on my way. The view of nearby Zealand Falls was underwhelming due to the lack of recent rain. I stayed only long enough to visualize how pretty the falls would have looked had the flow been heavier. 
Beyond the hut and the falls, the trail became very easy. For a several miles, there was smooth dirt underfoot. The path followed a contour line rather than going up, over, and down every nearby peak. It felt more like Shenandoah National Park than White Mountain National Forest. It was as if the builders of this section hadn't gone to AMC trail design school. What a welcome break before the Presidentials!
Since I was making good time, I blue blazed into Pemigewasset Wilderness for lunch at Thoreau Falls. Here again the water level was low. There wasn't much falling water, but the smooth, dry rocks made a great spot to take a break. The sun peaked out from behind the clouds occasionally, warming the air and rocks to a near-perfect temperature. For dessert, I picked a couple handfuls of wild blueberries that were growing on the riverbank. Nobody else was around, and I felt at one with nature. With some reluctance, I shouldered my pack for the rest of the day's walk, not knowing what the trail ahead would be like. 

 
The trail wasn't quite as smooth for the next few miles, but it was still much faster and easier than what I had become accustomed to in the Whites. I saw a few SOBO thru-hikers along the way. One, carrying a guitar in his pack, invited me to stop for a safety meeting in the middle of the trail. (I politely declined.) Nearing the trailhead early for my appointed ride to town, I climbed down the bank to the Saco River and lingered there for a while. 
Even with the breaks I had taken, I reached the parking lot at Crawford Notch well before my scheduled shuttle time. A woman setting up a folding chair behind her car said hello, and then she asked if I was KJ. It was Julie, trail angel and shuttle driver, who had also arrived more than an hour early! She's a convivial thru-hiker herself (class of 2013), so we had an enjoyable conversation on the drive to and through busy North Conway to the Quality Inn. 
The Whites have been daunting, and I've let myself feel pressured to make miles. Today, I didn't feel any need to maintain a pace. It was refreshing to have the time and energy to blue blaze and linger in a special spot, even to sit on the hut porch and eat coffee cake without thinking about moving on. This is good for me, and it's important to consider as I plan the days to my next resupply.

My Sawyer filter is clogged to the point that backwashing is ineffective. My CNOC catch bag/bladder leaks. My trekking pole tips are badly worn. Nobody here seems to have heard of the most popular bladder on the trail, and Leki pole tips are out of stock. I did find a Sawyer Squeeze ""system"" that includes two small bags. That'll do until I can order a CNOC online. The trekking pole tips are worn and less effective than I'd like, but replacements aren't critical. (I've fallen only twice in 1900 miles, neither time due to worn trekking pole tips.)

It being too breezy for my umbrella, I wore my rain jacket and pants over shorts and my sun shirt. Half an hour after starting, I was warm and sweaty, almost ready to take off the rain pants. That didn't last. As I gained elevation, the wind picked up and the temperature dropped. An hour later, I was shivering. I stopped to put on my fleece, which helped me feel more comfortable. 

The highlight of the day should have been the views from Mount Webster and Webster Cliffs. But with near-zero visibility and wind-driven rain, they were places to get past rather than to enjoy. It was hard even to stand on the open rocks in the gusty winds. At the next summit, Mount Jackson, I lost the trail in the limited visibility. After following several dead-ends, I eventually retraced my steps and started again. After making some lucky choices, I managed to find the right path. 

I reached Mizpah Hut in the early afternoon without having eaten. My jacket and gloves had wetted through, and I was colder than I had realized. I had planned to tent in the adjacent camping area, but the prospect of spending the night in wind-driven rain and mist wasn't at all appealing. I entered the hut to find a large crowd inside. From across the room, Nashvegas, Beebop, and Fudge Stripe called out and waved with big smiles. They're staying in the hut tonight. When I asked a croo member, she told me there were still bunks available for walk-ins. It was an easy decision to pull out my credit card and secure a dry place to eat and sleep. I'm in a half-filled bunkroom with Nashvegas, Beebop, and thru-hiker Stardust.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656691,"The rain stopped some time after midnight, and the sun was peeking through the clouds periodically by morning. However, the forecast for Mount Washington predicted sustained winds of 45-60 mph with gusts to 70 mph. That cemented my plan to stop for the night at Lakes of the Clouds Hut, on the flank of Mount Washington. 

After a leisurely breakfast, I got started around 8:30. As predicted, the wind picked up as I climbed Mount Pierce, and it was difficult to stand on the cloud-engulfed summit. The AT usually crosses every summit, but it fortuitously bypasses the summit of Mount Eisenhower, sparing me from some of the wind. 
 Just before the climb up Mount Franklin, Nashvegas, Beebop, and Moss caught up with me. I was pleased to be able to keep up with them for the remaining two miles to Lakes of the Clouds Hut. After a snack and rest break, they continued across Mount Washington and the Presidential Traverse. I was sad to see them go. Nashvegas tried to assure me that I'd catch up with them somewhere down the trail, but I wasn't so certain that I'd see them again.
After they left, I checked in to the hut, set up my bunk, and changed into dry socks and camp shoes. The summit of Mount Washington, just over a mile from the hut, didn't come into view until an hour or two later. The cloud cover eventually dispersed later in the afternoon. Feeling antsy, I put my hiking shoes back on and climbed a side trail to the summit of nearby Mount Munroe. The wind was still strong and gusty, but the 360-degree views were terrific. It was a far more enjoyable activity than sitting inside, reading my book.
After dinner, the hundred or so people at the hut (paying guests, work-for-stays, croo, and denizens of the Dungeon bunkroom in the basement) gathered on the rocks to watch the sunset. It occurs to me that I haven't seen many unobstructed sunsets on this hike.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656746,"The scary monster is no longer under my bed. I'd been looking forward to Mount Washington and the Presidential traverse with both anticipation and fear. In retrospect, today's miles were tough but rewarding. I'm glad I had the opportunity to do it, and I'm equally glad that it's over. 

My planning combined with some luck to produce the perfect weather window for hiking the notorious eight miles above treeline. Temperatures were in the forties and fifties. The day dawned clear, and a few clouds moved in later in the day to provide some cover from the warm sun. Moat importantly, we were treated to gentle breezes all day. A sign in the Mount Washington visitor center stated that the mountaintop is enveloped in fog 300 days of the year. Today was one of the lucky 65! 

The day started with a short climb from Lakes of the Clouds Hut to the summit of Mount Washington. The summit was less crowded than usual for a sunny Saturday. I arrived just before the first finishers of a bicycle race up the Auto Road. Because the Auto Road was closed for the race, the only visitors to the summit were the race supporters, hikers, and cog railway passengers. 

The trails were busy with day hikers and backpackers. Many were taking advantage of the AMC huts, either climbing up for an overnight visit or doing a hut-to-hut hike. 

The terrain was rugged, almost entirely rock with virtually no dirt. The elevation gain was modest but the 5,500 feet of descent were tough. Quads, knees, feet are all feeling it. I'm glad the previous four days were easy because my Achilles tendon also took a beating today. It was sore by mid-day and I favored it through the afternoon. 

 

I was tired even before I reached Osgood Tentsite. I slipped and fell (very gently, not even bruised), a rarity for me, half a mile from the finish. Thru-hiker Lobster caught up with me a few yards before the tentsite turnoff. Very generously, he told me to go ahead and have first choice of tenting spot. Normally, I would have declined the offer, but I really didn't want to walk any farther. There turned out to be two roughly equivalent platform spots left. 

It took me much longer than usual to set up my tent, and it was dusk when I sat down to eat. Most of the other campers were in their tents. That's when I got a special treat: a pine marten came around to investigate what I was eating. Very inquisitive, it played peekaboo with me for a few minutes. It was the first time I had seen a pine marten in the wild. The sighting made for a sweet end to a tough day.

The tentsites at Osgood are on large wooden platforms, each large enough to accommodate two or three tents. The tent next to mine was unoccupied, and there was a pantry's worth of food and packaging in the nearby bear box. I figured the owners would come back in the next day or so. Not so. I was startled awake at midnight by heavy footsteps and bright headlamps on the platform. It took the couple an hour and a half to set up, eat dinner, and settle in for the night. It took me another hour to get back to sleep. 

I awoke tired and grumpy. I was tempted to be loud and obnoxious myself in the morning, but I refrained. The couple were still in their tent when I left, and I think one of them was still asleep. [Pet peeve: If you get to camp late, use the red light on your headlamp and point it down at your feet.] 

It was a short five miles to Pinkham Notch, where thru-hiker Moegli and his wife had set up a big trail magic spread. A few slices of cold watermelon and a hard seltzer in the convivial company of other hikers put me in a better mood. 

 

I had a smile on my face by the time Shoelace's truck pulled in to the parking lot at noon. Yes, the Shoelace who hiked with me in Tennessee/Virginia and did trail magic in Pennsylvania. He drove down from Maine to spend this afternoon with me. It's always good to see him, and I needed a break from the trail after yesterday, so the timing worked out perfectly. 

In addition to spending time with a friend, I was able to clean up, do laundry, and do a major resupply--the latter thanks to Shoelace chauffeuring me. I plan to be back in Gorham, from a different trailhead, the day after tomorrow.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656870,"Twelve hours of hiking, with only a half-hour lunch break: that's a long day! In more gentle terrain, that effort would have yielded well over twenty miles. Not so in the Whites. Total elevation change (ascent plus descent) of more than 10,000 feet is part of the story. Adding to the difficulty was the steepness of some sections. Climbing up to Wildcat Ridge involved two miles of class 3 scrambling: poles in the pack and both hands on the rocks. The final descent from North Carter Mountain to Imp Shelter was almost as steep. 

My lunch break was at Carter Notch Hut, the smallest and most remote of the New Hampshire huts. It felt strikingly cozy and intimate after the huge facility and crowds at Lakes of the Clouds Hut. I arrived just in time to get the last bowl and a half of piping hot, tasty, split pea soup. I changed into long pants as the temperature had dropped and clouds had descended onto the mountaintops. 

 

A fine mist started about an hour after I left the hut and continued all afternoon. It wasn't cold, so I let my clothes get wet. Of course, the rocks got wet, too. The final descent to the shelter wasn't just steep, it was now wet, too. 

Normally I much prefer sleeping in my tent, but I was exhausted by the time I got to Imp Shelter at 7:00. It was already starting to get dark, and the mist had strengthened into light rain. I opted for the speed and convenience of unrolling my sleeping bag in the shelter. It was dark by the time I finished eating, and I was happy with the choice I had made. 

An earlier incident is worth mentioning. Stopping to pee just off the trail this afternoon, I noticed a black rectangular object partially covered in leaves and dirt. It looked as if it had been there for days, perhaps longer. It turned out to be an iPhone. I carried it to the shelter and asked the caretaker whether anyone had reported losing a phone. Nobody had. Thru-hiker Take 3, an iPhone user, changed the phone from her power brick. Unfortunately, there was no owner information on the startup screen. A SOBO hiker will take the phone to the lost-and-found at Pinkham Notch visitor center.

What didn't make me smile were the sore throat and other cold symptoms that had developed overnight. I suppose I picked it up in one of the crowded huts.

The trail took me up and over Mount Moriah, then down nearly 4,000 feet to US Route 2 just outside Gorham. Some steep rocks near the summit, made slippery by the overnight rain, slowed me down at first. The slope eventually moderated, and I made good time without pushing the pace.

I selected a spot for my tent and headed down the path to collect water. Collecting water from the slow flow took a while, and it was getting ominously dark by the time I returned to the tentsite. Thunderclaps, far away at first, were growing closer. The timing was perfect: I had just finished setting up my tent and stowing my gear when it started to pour.

During the upcoming weeks, I'll try to stay focused on the moment, or my next resupply, rather than on Katahdin or on ""finishing."" I appreciate the encouragement that's intended with comments like, ""Almost done!"" But this hike, to me, has never been about getting it done. It's about having an adventure along the way. So, the encouragement I value most right now is along the lines of, ""Savor every minute,"" or, ""May new adventures come your way in Maine."" 

Back to the present.... I was alone at Ttident Col Tentsite last night. I still enjoy the solitude at night in the wilderness. The timing was fortuitous, too, because I coughed, sneezed, and blew my nose a lot. 

There were no more thunderstorms overnight, but it rained at dusk. Fog and mist persisted until dawn. The forecast for today missed the mark. Instead of mostly sunny skies, there were showers in the morning and variably cloudy skies in the afternoon. 

Although not as continously difficult as it has been on some days, I found the going tough, averaging only 1.1 mph for the day. Wet conditions made scrambling and traversing rock faces treacherous. Stepping carefully to keep my feet (mostly) out of the extensive mud slowed me down. And having a cold contributed to the slow pace overall. 

Late this afternoon, I skipped a blue blaze to a passenger aircraft crash site. Thru-hikers Gumby and Fearomere, who are much faster hikers, arrived in camp almost two hours later than I after making the detour. Although I had been curious about the wreckage, I'm glad I didn't expend the extra effort and time.

On another day I might have considered sleeping in the shelter, but I didn't want to spread my cold germs.

Damp overnight and a little foggy at dawn, it soon became a perfect weather day. I was treated to long-distance views from along the Mahoosuc Range, notably Goose Eye Mountain. I glimpsed what was probably my last sighting of Mount Washington. It felt great to be hiking in Maine. 

 
I reached Full Goose Shelter at noon feeling tired, the kind of tired I usually feel at the end of a long day hiking. The 100-yard uphill walk from the water source took a big effort. After lunch, I realized that even weekend hikers were passing me. 
Finally, I reached the start of Mahoosuc Notch, the most difficult/fun mile of the Appalachian Trail. I'd been looking forward to this mile for a long time, and I wasn't going to let it be a pity party. A switch inside me flipped. My energy and my smile returned, and I started in with enthusiasm.

Immediately after the Notch is the steep climb up Mahoosuc Arm. After dallying for a while with thru-hikers Summertime and Curious George at the end of the Notch, I heard the voices of Jeff and Elizabeth, a couple of fast-moving weekenders I had passed in the Notch, coming up from behind. For reasons that aren't important in retrospect, I wanted to reach Speck Pond campsite before they did. I set out at a moderate pace. They seemed to be gaining on me, so I accelerated. And so it went, all the way up the climb. Whenever I eased my pace, they'd get within earshot. So I pushed hard all the way up and along the Arm to the shelter.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657235,"The effects of yesterday's effort stayed with me today. After sleeping nearly ten hours, I awoke still feeling tired and sore. Before starting out, I lollygagged and chatted for a while with thru-hikers General and Road Show; they had worked as counselors at a wilderness therapy organization in Old Fort, NC. 

Hiking began with a short but steep climb up Old Spec. Some steep, wet slabs made the climb ""interesting"" in places. The sun was starting to break through, but clouds and fog lingered for a long time. I didn't make the half-mile detour (round trip) to the lookout tower at the summit. Instead, I made my way slowly and gingerly down toward Grafton Notch. Still, my Achilles flared up and I rolled both ankles on the 2,600-foot descent. 

An unusual situation emerged when I encountered weekender Yves from Quebec and two Brazilian section hikers. Two of us couldn't speak Portuguese, two couldn't speak French, and one couldn't speak English. After trying unsuccessfully to converse in different languages, we eventually figured out that we all spoke at least a little Spanish. It was interesting to observe, even as a participant, how we found a way to communicate. 

A few days ago, I reserved a room at Bethel Village Motel, planning to resupply, shower, launder, and overnight. As instructed, I called the motel from Old Spec. When I reached the Grafton Notch trailhead nearly three hours later, co-owner Kevin was waiting to drive me 20 miles to the motel. Talk about hiker-friendly!

As yesterday, by lunchtime I felt as tired as if I had put in a full day's hiking. Not knowing what to expect, I was charmed by the town, by the motel, and even by the room I was assigned (corner room on the second floor with a quasi-private outdoor sitting area). I decided to stay a second night to give myself a full day's rest. With no pressure to resupply this afternoon, I napped and dozed while motel owner Ruthie laundered my clothes. 

Two doors away from the motel is a small supermarket. I ventured over to buy some breakfast items and scope out the selection for my resupply shopping tomorrow. As I was about to step into the store, a voice from a car window called, ""Hey, KJ!"" It was Hillflower and Honey. They had also come to shop, so we chatted as we cruised the food aisles. It was great to see them. They're staying in the smaller town of Andover, a couple days of hiking beyond Bethel. The unfortunate consequence of my slowdown is that I'm falling behind people I've enjoyed hiking with for the past couple months.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657250,"My decision to stay put for another day turned out to be the right one. My cold symptoms, especially the cough and runny nose, are still with me. My energy level matched the not-quite-full day of easy activities. Kevin drove me to True North Adventureware outfitter so I could buy a fuel canister and a couple of freeze-dried meals. I revised my hiking itinerary to my next resupply in Rangeley, aired out my sleeping bag, rinsed some of the mud out of my shoes, shopped for groceries, repackaged food for hiking, and read for an hour or so. 
As I was leaving the supermarket with my purchases, Roadrunner and Groceries walked in. I hadn't seen them since Boiling Springs, PA in June. It was a fun surprise to reconnect. Roadrunner told me that Focs and Cheeseball were behind, taking lots of zeros. It's reassuring to know that somebody is taking even more zeros than I! 

There are plenty of restaurants in Bethel, but most are closed Tuesdays. Other than the golf club and fast food places, Butcher Burger was the only restaurant open. Unsurprisingly, it was packed when I arrived at six. The only open table was a five-top, and the waitress wasn't keen on seating only one or two there. But two hikers were right behind me: a quick mutual recognition and negotiation got us seated together. (They spotted my muddy shoes, and it didn't take me long to catch the implication of an ""I poop in the woods"" T-shirt.) 

As hiker midnight approaches, I'm writing this from the chair on the balcony outside my room. It's unseasonably--and pleasantly--warm for the end of August.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657331,"In spite of three days off in the past week, the chest congestion, cough, and runny nose continued unabated today. It's frustrating that the cold symptoms have lingered so long. The bright side is that I felt more energetic than I have in more than a week. 

As predicted, it was raining steadily when I awoke. But it tapered off during the half-hour that it took Kevin to drive me to the trailhead. As I started hiking, I was treated to that wonderful smell of the forest after it rains. 

It didn't take me long to goof. An hour after I started, I realized I was passing blue blazes, not white ones. I had completely missed a trail junction. A signed trail junction. Fortunately, I was only a quarter-mile off trail. 

The climb up Baldpate Mountain started smoothly and gradually became steeper. The summits--there are three--were covered in fog. East Baldpate, the second, required climbing several hundred yards of wet, slippery rock slabs. Trekking poles weren't much help, and one slip could have had severe consequences. I found it nerve-wracking. 

Immediately after the Baldpates, I stopped at Frye Notch Lean-to for a late lunch. It was fun to catch up briefly with Roadrunner and Groceries, who had arrived earlier. They're planning a longer, later day than I, so I didn't expect to see them later. The hiking got easier (not easy) After that, and I enjoyed the afternoon's walk. 

Comments in the FarOut app led me to a campsite a couple hundred yards down a side trail. It was idyllic, with flat ground, a small waterfall, and food-hanging trees nearby. Thru-hiker Inspector was setting up when I arrived. He welcomed me, and we conversed easily. He has just graduated with a degree in environmental science, and he aspires to be a forest ranger. Nice guy, smart and companionable. I crawled into my tent at 7:30 feeling tired but not exhausted. I'm grateful that my body held up.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657363,"It's September, and right on cue, a cold front came through. I opted to wear long pants this morning, and I'm glad I did. Early morning sunshine felt warm, but the wind soon picked up and clouds rolled in. There was even a brief sprinkle of rain. Through the day, the sun appeared and disappeared. Wind gusted all day. The temperature didn't get out of the 50s. Exposure to, and shelter from, wind and sun caused big swings in apparent temperature. 

This morning's hike over Wyman Mountain was pleasant and enjoyable. There were plenty of rocks and roots, and there was no lack of climbing. But there was also dirt underfoot, and it felt like a hiking trail rather than another one of the obstacle courses that have characterized the trail in recent days. 

 

I stopped for lunch at Hall Mountain Lean-to. As I was packing up, Not Dead Yet appeared, followed by Melissa and Ally. They're all slackpacking SOBO today, and they plan to start NOBO tomorrow from the same place as I. It's reassuring to see familiar faces and to know that at least a few others are hiking at my pace. 

Speaking of hiking at my pace, where did my fitness go? It feels as if I was hiking stronger 1,000 miles ago. As I started this morning, 14 miles seemed to be a reasonable target for the day. By lunchtime, just six miles in, I felt as if I'd expended a full day's effort. My pace slowed appreciably after lunch, and it soon became apparent that I wouldn't make it beyond Black Brook Campsite at 10 miles. I'm hoping that the lingering cough and runny nose are contributing to the slowdown so I'll be able to accelerate once I get over the cold. 

Stopping at ten miles turned out to be OK for several reasons. Located in a notch, Black Brook Campsite was sheltered from the worst of the increasingly strong wind. On the map, the stealth spots over the next few miles look more exposed. I pitched my tent on a flat spot near the water. As a bonus, there was trail magic just across the brook, only 100 yards away. Thanks to trail angel Will, who offered me a beer, a cheeseburger, and an apple, I didn't need to cook and eat backpacker food. I stayed until dusk. Thru-hikers Rogue and Yes-Man had been there for a while when I arrived and didn't seem to be any hurry to leave as darkness approached.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657402,"Twelve miles was too much. I pushed myself too hard today, even though the trail was moderate (by Maine standards). The good news is that I didn't feel depleted by lunchtime. That feeling didn't come until 3:00 PM when I stopped at Bemis Mountain Lean-to. My pace had slowed considerably, and even walking on nearly-flat ground took effort. Soon after that, the Achilles tendinitis broke through the Aleve. By 4:30 I was stumbling like a drunk. At 5:30, I fell. It wasn't just a slip, but a total wipeout. Fortunately, it resulted in nothing more than scrapes and bruises. I got to the tentsite at 6:00, exhausted and a bit dazed. 

The day's hike lasted 10 1/2 hours, and I had to dig deep into my reserves to complete it. What's puzzling, and more than a little frustrating, is that the same hike a month ago would have taken about 7 hours and would have left me with the energy and inclination to do something else once I got to camp. 

I should mention that the weather was terrific. It was crisp and cool this morning, warming into the 60s this afternoon. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. It was so clear, in fact, that the summit of Old Blue offered one more surprise peek at Mount Washington, now quite far away. 

Melissa, Ally, and Not Dead Yet started just before I did. I caught up with Melissa and Ally a couple times early, but they got ahead and stayed ahead. I leapfrogged Not Dead Yet, but eventually he also pulled away. 

One surprise that made me smile this afternoon was coming across a clutch of spruce grouse. As happened a couple days ago, they allowed me to approach quite closely without showing signs of fear. I slowly followed one down the trail for about 20 yards before it ducked into the undergrowth. Cute!

Flip-flopper Slug, who started in Harpers Ferry, leapfrogged me and ended his day at the same place as I. 
I stopped for early lunch on the small beach at Long Pond. It felt wonderful to be barefoot on the sand. The warm sun combined with a light breeze and whispy cloud formations. I waded in to my knees. It was just a bit too cold for full immersion, so i settled for a splash bath. Those 45 minutes added some much-needed improvement to my attitude. 
Once again, by 3:00 I was dragging. I was happy to see Little Swift River Pond at 4:00. I took my time setting up, luxuriating in the absence of any time pressure. The best part was taking a canoe out on the pond, courtesy of the MATC. 
Today's water activities, combined with nice weather and low mileage, helped me remember why I'm here: to have an adventure on the way to Katahdin. I can make that happen regardless of how many miles I hike each day or whether I make it to Katahdin. I need to keep reminding myself of that.

[Pet peeve: I understand the need to set an alarm, but hitting the snooze button when others are sleeping nearby is inconsiderate.] 

Having scheduled a shuttle pickup for 11:00 and knowing it was a short walk to the trailhead, I took my time breaking camp and eating breakfast. As a treat, I launched a canoe and paddled around the pond for a half hour before setting out on foot. 

The short section of trail wasn't especially remarkable, but it did pass by South Pond, where I stopped to sit and snack. It was nice, for the second day in a row, to not worry about making miles. 

Shuttle driver Dad (no, not my dad!) took me to the Town and Lake Motel in Rangeley. I showered, napped, and did laundry. I also collected packages that Joanne and Neon sent me. They both have my thanks for their continued support.

Speaking of support, I appreciate the supportive comments that readers have written in the Guest Book. I had a couple of rough days, and the encouragement helps. 

I noticed a small sailboat at the dock in front of the motel. It was half-filled with water and in need of some TLC. When I enquired about it, the motel owner told me it belonged to him. He offered to let me use it if I was willing to do the necessary work. Work-for-stay is common among hikers; work-for-sail is a bit unusual! It had been quite breezy at mid-day, but the wind was dying by the time I got out. I sailed back and forth in the bay, staying within a mile or so from the dock so I wouldn't have a long paddle back if the wind died completely. It felt good to get out on the water, and I was grateful for what might be my only opportunity to sail this year.

It rained nearly all day, making me grateful that this happened to be a zero day rather than a hiking day. 

There isn't much to the touristy town of Rangeley. Development doesn't extend far off Main Street, which follows the shore of Rangeley Lake. Commerce and development center around the lake and nearby ATV trails. Many license plates are from Massachusetts. 

I spent my zero day engaged in the usual way. The walk to the nearest grocery store is nearly 2 1/2 miles round-trip from the motel. Joanne sent me several food items, which the nearby convenience store was able to supplement into a full resupply. I got a little extra sleep, trying to shake this cold. I also took a second COVID test since I'm still coughing. Once again, I was relieved to get a negative result. 

Sometimes it pays to be nice. I ordered an imperial sour (beer) at dinner tonight. It was remarkably good, and I told the restaurant's beer buyer so. A little later, a glass of saison appeared on my table, on the house. I tipped accordingly, hoping that the staff shares their tips.","Rangeley, ME

More importantly, when I arrived at my planned overnight stop at 4:00, I felt an urge to go on. Having legs at 4:00 is huge progress. I'm also pleased that today was my longest mileage day in nearly a month. When I arrived at tonight's actual campsite, I was tired but not exhausted. It's a huge relief to know that I'm no lomger stuck at ten miles per day. 

The day started with mist and fog. Below tree line, the mist condenses on tree leaves and falls in drops as ""tree rain."" Above tree line, it hits you directly, driven by the wind. My umbrella worked effectively for the tree rain, but I stashed it above tree line. The mist continued until mid-afternoon. It was a little uncomfortable, and of course there were no views from the Saddlebacks, but the fog creates an ethereal atmosphere that can be beautiful in its own way. 

The unpleasant weather seems to have kept a lot of people off the trail. Over the course of the day, I saw three section hikers and perhaps a hf dozen thru-hikers. Late this afternoon, I was surprised to encounter Melissa and Ally. They were hiking SOBO. We stopped and talked for a few minutes. They've been hiking a patchwork of sections, bouncing ahead and coming back later to fill in the ""missed"" sections. It was good to see them. 

 

Sluice Brook Logging Road merits an explanation. The AT crosses the disused logging road, which runs along a grade that formerly supported a logging railway. I found a nice flat spot near a rushing brook. It's still very humid, and everything uncovered is wet. But the setting is nice enough to appreciate despite the weather and its effects.

The productive cough and dripping sinuses resumed as soon as I got up, and they continued all day. 
This is day 15 of the cold symptoms, with no end in sight. They're sapping my energy, both physical and psychological. I was more tired upon reaching camp today than I was yesterday, in spite of a shorter hike with less elevation gain at a slower pace. 
On a positive note, the weather changed for the better. The sun came out, and the temperature hovered in the fifties and sixties...perfect for hiking. 
The trail remained below tree line, opening up for a couple views late this afternoon. Most notable is that a few maple leaves are starting to change color. The days are getting considerably shorter, most noticeably in the evening. Fall is most definitely in the air. 
The trail was mostly moderate today (by Maine standards, of course). The one exception was a very steep, somewhat technical, descent near the campsite. After my tumble the other day, the descent slowed me almost to a stop. Yet I still managed to lose my footing and land on my butt. I don't understand why these late-in-the-day falls have been happening so frequently lately. Do I need to limit myself to fewer than ten miles per day from now on? It's frustrating that my hiking ability has regressed so much.

Interesting encounter: Bird Man arrived at Spaulding Mountain Lean-to as I was eating lunch there. He's carrying a big directional microphone to capture bird calls. I commented that I've been hearing far fewer birds as I've walked north. He explained that there aren't necessarily fewer birds here, it's that the breeding season is over.

The owners, Jen and Jen, arrived a few minutes later. I was assigned to a separate vehicle from the others because someone had reported that I was coughing and might have COVID. Jen took me aside and asked whether I'd be willing to take a COVID test. I told her I'd taken two since symptoms began and had no problem taking a third.

In retrospect, I'm happy with that decision. 
After a hearty breakfast (eggs, frittata, waffles, cantaloupe), the Jenns drove three of us to the trailhead on the 8:00 AM shuttle. I felt a tinge of emotion saying goodbye. The Maine Roadhouse had been an ideal place to rest and recover for a couple days.

It was warm and windless, so I pulled out my mat and sat for a while at Avery Peak, taking in the lakes, ponds, forests, and mountains that stretched as far as I could see.

A Lotta has a new trail name: Slinky. Her mom Maggie summited a few days ago. Aqua, who had been hiking with them when I met them, summited nearly three weeks ago.

Logically, there's nothing especially noteworthy about someone painting rectangles on tree trunks, but the white blaze is such an iconic symbol of the trail that seeing one being painted felt meaningful. 
What's an adventure without an occasional challenge? This afternoon, I was walking down a gradual slope strewn with rocks and tree roots. As I was swinging my trekking pole forward, the tip bounced off a rock and got lodged directly in front of my advancing right leg. I could feel more than hear the carbon fiber splintering. Unlike metal, which usually bends, carbon fiber splinters and cracks. It can't be bent back into shape. 

 
I stashed the broken pole in my pack and walked with one pole for the rest of the day. Although I absolutely prefer to hike with two poles, I was ae to make do with just one. The real problem was setting up my tent. It requires two rigid trekking poles, and one of mine was anything but rigid. I taped the cracked section tightly with Leukotape; that held the pole together, but it was still wobbly. No good. After some fiddling, I realized that an MSR Groundhog tent stake might be the right shape to make an effective splint. While thru-hiker Manatee lent a hand, I taped the stake tightly to the pole with Tenacious Tape. I'm now lying in my tent under it.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658000,"The day dawned windy and chilly. The thermometer read mid-40s, but the wind made it feel colder. It was by far the chilliest morning I've experienced since last spring. The good news is that my field-repaired trekking pole held up overnight. 
Uncharacteristically, I was the first one out of camp this morning. At 7:20, there may not have been anyone else awake. The first order of business was to climb up and over Bald Mountain, often called Moxie Bald Mountain. The wind made it feel especially chilly on the open summit, so I didn't linger. 
I stopped before lunch at Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to, mostly to look at the eponymous pond. While I was there with my pack off, I stepped into a wooded area to pee. Almost as soon as I started to relieve myself, I heard some wood cracking noises. Where had I heard those sounds before? At the Telephone Pioneers Shelter in New York, just before a huge tree came down! I looked up and saw a big birch tree slowly, and then more quickly, falling toward me. I very quickly stopped what I was doing and dodged the now-falling tree. It crashed to the ground just a few feet from where I'd been standing a few seconds before. Although it wouldn't have hit me if I had stayed in place, it would have scared more than urine out of me. 

 
The afternoon, the trail mostly followed Bald Mountain Stream and West Branch Piscataquis River without any long climbs. The trail did forded ford each of those waterways. They were the first fords I've done since Lick Creek in southern Virginia. 
There didn't seem to be many hikers on trail. I leapfrogged thru-hikers Quantum and Tangled. Another group of three NOBOs was also in the mix. I saw perhaps six or eight SOBOs.
I had been planning to end my day at Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to. It was still early when I arrived, and the tentsites looked unappealing. I pushed on, and I'm glad I did. Less than a mile farther up the trail, I found a nice, level stealth tentsite near the bank of the Piscataquis. I'll sleep tonight to the sound of rushing water. Hiking in the mountains has its benefits!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658044,"Complete! I have now hiked the entire Appalachian Trail. (In 2018, I hiked SOBO from Katahdin to Monson. See https://www.trailjournals.com/...) It's a significant milestone, and I'm proud of the accomplishment. But my celebration is muted because it's not the end of this adventure. There are still more than 100 miles to go, including two of the trail's highlights: the 100-Mile Wilderness and Mount Katahdin. 
My mini thermometer read 41°F this morning. It felt colder than that, and it was hard to get out of my warm sleeping bag. As I was finishing breakfast at 6:00, I saw a hiker running up the trail. It was Slinky (A Lotta), in shorts, but still wearing a puffy, trying to get warm. She slowed for a few seconds to tell me that she and Rain Man had camped a couple miles south of me.
Once on the trail, the only significant challenge for me was another crossing of West Branch Piscataquis River early this morning. Neither the temperature nor I had warmed up much by the time I got there. I wasn't enthusiastic about getting my feet wet while I was still cold. The rock-hop was tricky, especially with a single trekking pole, but I managed to keep my feet dry while crossing on logs, branches, and some wobbly rocks. I felt almost as good about my rock-hopping skill as I did about keeping my feet dry!
Eight thru-hikers passed me in the eight miles to the trailhead. I did manage to pass a day hiker. I still find it hard to accept that I'm one of the slowest (and oldest) thru-hikers on trail. It helps somewhat to remind myself that 80% of would-be thru-hikers don't make it this far. A more effective, albeit difficult, mental strategy is to focus on my hike, my adventure, my accomplishments, and to shut out thoughts of what others are doing. 
Rain Man arrived at the Monson trailhead shortly after I did. We chatted for a while, and ten minutes before the scheduled noon shuttle to Shaw's Hiker Hostel, a couple offered us a ride into town. At Shaw's Hiker Hostel, owner Hippie Chick showed me around and checked me into my room very quickly and efficiently with no more formality than asking for my trail name. She and husband Poet run their complex business with remarkably laid-back effectiveness. In addition to managing the overflowing hostel (a dozen tents on the lawn), they serve breakfast, run a shuttle and slackpacking service, provide food drops in the 100-Mile Wilderness, operate a full-service outfitter, and dispense huge amounts of trail wisdom. Today, they were also hosting a birthday party for their young daughter!
Shaw's is the unofficial launching point for the 100-Mile Wilderness and Katahdin beyond. It's also the last point on the trail that such a large group of thru-hikers will be together. It's sweet to have the opportunity to rub shoulders and catch up with my trail peeps. But underlying the celebratory mood is the unavoidable thought that our adventures are coming to an end. Hikers who've made it this far have the resupply, shuttling, and slackpacking routines down pat. But most of us aren't accustomed to the emotions that surface as we realize that this stage of our lives will soon be over. The feelings are both intense and conflicted.
On that note, Beebop and Nashvegas summited today in sub-freezing temperatures. I'm glad I had the opportunity to hike with them as long as I did.

 
Shoelace showed up once again. He arrived in time for dinner with a bag full of groceries from the shopping list I sent him yesterday. More importantly, he brought a pair of replacement trekking poles. Joanne and he were able to get the replacement set from my gear stash at home to my room in Monson in barely more than 48 hours. They're true friends!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658070,"Weather luck has been with me. On my final planned zero, it rained all day. Tomorrow I head into the 100-Mile Wilderness. For the next eight days or so, there won't be any towns or services. So it was a real treat to have a warm, dry refuge at the hostel today. 
I stopped into the ATC Visitors Center to learn the convoluted and strict rules that apply to thru-hikers aspiring to summit Katahdin. 

 
Resupply in Monson required more thought than usual. To help hikers reduce their pack weight, Shaw's Hiker Hostel provides food drops near the mid-point of the 100-Mile Wilderness. Based on my pace and what I know of the terrain, I calculated that it will take me seven or eight days to transit the Wilderness. I divided my food into what I'll eat before and after the food drop. The ""dropped"" food went into a five-gallon plastic bucket labeled with my name plus the location, date, and time that a driver will meet me on a logging road. That took more time and thought than the usual resupply.
For dinner this evening, I wandered in the rain to The Lakeshore House. It was packed, but Slinky and Rain Man welcomed me to their table. I enjoyed their company in what may be the last restaurant meal of my hike. 
It's exciting to be so close to the completion of a difficult endeavor. At the same time, the thought of the adventure ending looms in the background. It's an understatement to say that my emotions are conflicted. I think most thru-hikers at Shaw's tonight are dealing with similar feelings.","Monson, ME

It's the start of the 100-Mile Wilderness, which, although I've hiked it before, still holds a mystique for me. And, for provisioning reasons, I've had to plan out my days to Katahdin. It's certainly not the end of my AT thru-hike, but it's the beginning of the end. (I'm conscious that before I started long-distance hiking, a 115-mile backpacking trip would have seemed like a grand adventure, not an ""it's almost over"" portion.)
Sunnyside had been staying at Shaw's while Mother Hen and her husband Seven attended their son's wedding in Florida. The latter two flew back to Bangor last night and drove to the hostel to pick up Sunnyside this morning. They're picking up their hike where they left off, at Katahdin Ironworks Road, some 30 miles ahead if me. It was nice to have an opportunity to say goodbye and wish them well. 
Poet drove six of us to the trailhead this morning and sent us on our way with words of advice and encouragement. I almost teared up at one point. 
It was 9:00 by the time I started walking. (The late start dictated a relatively short day of hiking.) The sky was overcast, the light was dull, and the temperature hovered just above 50 degrees. The ground was wet and the air was damp from 24 hours of light rain. So although the weather wasn't uncomfortable, it wasn't uplifting, either. 
The terrain was mostly moderate with lots of rocks and roots. It felt as if I could make good time until I slipped on some wet slate. After a second slide and near-fall, I slowed my pace. I passed three pretty ponds and vistas from a lomg ridge, but the dull light didn't make for good photo opportunities. 
It started raining at 2:00. My umbrella kept me mostly dry and comfortable. I did get wet up to my knees when I forded surprisingly cold Big Wilson Stream. I elected to wade in my hiking shoes, which was a good decision since the stream bottom was strewn with slippery rocks.
When I arrived at Wilson Valley Lean-to, I didn't see any good, or even mediocre, tent sites. Thru-hiker Baguira was the only other person in the shelter, so I set up in there instead of tenting in the rain on sloped, rocky soil. Magic Hat, another thru-hiker, came in a while later.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658132,"I passed a notable milestone today: Katahdin is now less than 100 miles away. 
But river crossings stole the day's spotlight from the distance milestone. It had rained steadily all night and into this morning, turning what are normally easy rock hops into deep fords. The first, at Wilber Brook, was a routine knee-deep ford. A quarter-mile beyond that, Vaughn Stream was thigh-deep with a swift current. I aborted my first attempt and tried a different crossing that proved manageable, if scary. I needed the grip of my hiking shoes and both poles tobstay on my feet. A half-mile later, Long Pond Stream was the most dangerous of all. There was a stout rope across this one. I stashed my poles and held the rope tightly with both hands, shuffling my hands and feet sideways as I faced upstream. The water at one point was almost to my crotch, with faster current. I lost my balance at least twice, using the rope to keep me from being swept downstream. I've forded many rivers, and I can say unequivocally that Long Pond Stream today was the most difficult. 
I caught my breath on the far bank. I had unfastened my hip belt and loosened my shoulder straps in case I needed to free myself from my pack. For the same reason, I had transferred my phone from an open sleeve on my pack to a zippered jacket pocket. In retrospect, I should also have transferred my InReach emergency satellite communicator from my pack to my clothing. 
The rest of the day was more mundane. The rain tapered off around 10:00, but a fine mist kept everything wet through the day. By the time I approached Barren Mountain in the afternoon, much of the trail was either submerged or a stream bed. My pace slowed substantially. I stopped at a stealth campsite several miles short of my intended destination for the day, not because I was too tired to continue but because I was running out of daylight. It was dark by the time I finished eating at 7:00. I needed my headlamp to find the bear line I had thrown earlier.

The morning began with fog and fine mist. The penetrating dampness and temperatures in the upper 40s made me feel as I ate breakfast and broke camp.  The trail got to business immediately once I started hiking. The Chairbacks are four (or five, depending on how you count) successive peaks with steep faces. They present an obvious aerobic challenge not unlike the Roller Coaster in Virginia. They also ""feature"" wet, slippery rocks and talus. I took my time, yet I still managed to fall twice. 
  
An interesting sight today was a crashed single-engine aircraft on a steep, wooded slope. Nobody died in the crash, so I gawked without any feelings other than curiosity. It was difficult to imagine anybody surviving a crash that strewed so much wreckage.
As I approached Gulf Hagas, a natural preserve, in the afternoon, the trail moderated and the sun appeared. West Branch Pleasant River required an easy, shin-deep ford, a pleasant [pun intended] contrast to yesterday's river crossings. Camping is prohibited in and around Gulf Hagas, so I pressed on. At 5:00, I found a vacant stealth campsite beside a small brook. A few hikers have passed by, but nobody else has stopped. It's now dark, so I expect to be lulled to solitary sleep by the gentle sounds of moving water. That suits me.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658269,"A lightning flash woke me a precisely 5:00 AM. The rain started within minutes, and it fell continuously for the next twelve hours. It was tough to get and stay motivated. 
Instead of a regular breakfast and coffee, I ate a couple of Pro Meal bars leaning into the vestibule of my tent. I thought that perhaps without coffee I might make it 1.7 miles up the trail to use the privy at the shelter. My bowels overruled my plans, so I had to dig and squat during a thundersquall. It wasn't a great way to start the morning, but it did serve to get me wet, making it a little easier to start hiking in the rain. 
The rain intensity lessened for a while, but it picked up again as I neared Carl Newhall Lean-to. I made coffee there while I waited for the rain to let up. Freshly caffeinated, I headed up Gulf Hagas Mountain, followed by West Peak, Hay Mountain, and White Cap Mountain. The latter has an open summit above tree line. It's usually a memorable spot for thru-hikers as it's usually the first viewpoint from which Katahdin is visible. That first glimpse of Mam K will need to wait, as visibility in the rain was limited to about 100 yards. 
My feet got soaked early this morning and stayed that way all day. Ironically, that was helpful because I was less hesitant to tromp through puddles instead of trying to avoid them. And there were puddles! Many flat sections of the trail were submerged, and the inclines had become streams. 
I took another very short break at Logan Brook Lean-to, just long enough to eat a snack out of the rain. I arrived at my destination for the day, Logan Brook Lean-to, at 5:00 with some energy still in reserve.

Two river crossings bookended the day's hike. The first was just a quarter mile from East Branch Lean-to. The seriousness of the crossing became clear when thru-hiker Tenacity walked back into the shelter clearing from East Branch Pleasant River. As her trail name suggests, she must have found it daunting if she turned back. 
By consensus, the dozen or so hikers in and around the shelter decided to cross in groups. Nobody felt confident or foolhardy enough to go it alone. I grouped with three others who were ready to leave at the same time. The morning air was still chilly, even with layers of clothes on. Stripping down to underwear and T-shirts for the crossing added shivers to our jitters. Treble, the most experienced river crosser among us, crossed first. The first three-quarters of his way across looked straightforward, but then he sank into a deep channel with a swift current. The water was nearly to his waist, and he struggled to keep his balance. 
We agreed that it would probably be easier a few yards downstream, where the current looked slower. I went next, picking my way across, not seeing the bottom or knowing whether there might be a sudden drop-off. The current was slower, and the ford turned out to be uniformly deep all the way across. Blossom, the shortest of our group, was last to cross. Upon exiting the water, she exclaimed, ""My pussy got wet!"" And after a moment, she added, ""Not in a good way!"" That line got some mileage through the day. 
I was grateful for the short climb that followed the cold water. I welcomed the effort as a way to warm myself. The temperature remained in the 40s all day, with a strong wind blowing. After the climb, the temperature felt comfortable for hiking, but not for sitting around. 
At 11:00 AM, as scheduled, I met a pickup truck on Johnson Pond Road, a private, unpaved, logging road. Driven by Poet from Shaw's, the truck bed held about 15 five-gallon plastic buckets. Printed on each was a trail name, date, time, and place. Part of Shaw's business is delivering food drops to hikers in the 100-Mile Wilderness. I was happy to retrieve what I had packed during my zero day in Monson. It saved me from carrying an extra ten or twelve pounds for several days. 
This afternoon, Slinky (A Lotta) and Rain Man passed me. We chatted as we walked until I fell behind. They expect to reach Katahdin before I do, so I may not see them again. 
As I neared Antlers Campsite, my thoughts went to my feet. My socks and shoes were drying out nicely. But there it was, a mile from my destination, another ford at Mud Brook. It was only fifteen feet across and a foot deep with no significantcurrent, but it was annoying to get my feet wet again. 
Although quite a few hikers had arrived before I did, I found a lovely site for my tent, within feet of Lower Jo-Mary Lake yet protected from most of the wind. I've enjoyed sleeping in a few choice spots in recent days.

For the second day in a row, I hiked most of the morning in my windbreaker (rain jacket). The sky cleared quickly, the temperature rose gradually, and the wind gusted all day. Nahmakanta Lake looked especially impressive, covered in whitecaps. 
Mid-morning, I took a short side trail to the shore of Pemadumcook Lake. I stepped out of the woods onto rocks at the lakeshore, looked to my left, and there it was: Mount Katahdin. Mama K. There are no other mountains of any consequence nearby, so it looks huge and imposing. 
The emotions came later, as I walked: excitement at being so close, pride in myself for getting this far, sadness that my grand adventure will end soon. Seeing the big mountain so clearly also stirred up some nervousness: it's the toughest climb on the AT, and weather conditions near the summit can rival those on Mount Washington. I'm trying to stay focused on the present moment, acknowledging the powerful feelings while taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of the 100-Mile Wilderness. 
Early this afternoon, I saw two familiar figures heading SOBO. I was astounded to see Melissa and Ally! They had taken advantage of a weather window to skip ahead and summit Katahdin under good conditions. Now they're headed SOBO to complete the 40 miles they missed. They'll finish at Jo-Mary Road, near the half-way point of the 100-Mile Wilderness. That's not how I'd choose to finish my hike, but I was happy that their decision allowed me to see them once more.
It was just after 3:00 when I arrived at Wadleigh Stream Lean-to. A no-camping zone extends for the next eight miles, so my choice was to end the day either early or late. I chose early, in part to align with my anticipated weather window for summiting Katahdin.

I'm hoping it will do the job for the few hiking days that are left. 
The day started with a short climb up Nesuntabunt Mountain, where I got a second look at Katahdin...and a cellular signal. Three different weather forecasts told me that my intended summit day, 28 September, would be wet and windy. The next promising weather window will open two days later. The simplest solution is to spend two and half rainy days in my tent at Abol Bridge Campground, a traditional car camping place. That doesn't sound appealing, and Baxter State Park (home of Mama K) regulations make anything else complicated. I spent too much time today thinking about alternatives instead of savoring a pretty day on the trail. 
As if to remind me that I'm in northern Maine, a float plane flew low overhead near Crescent Pond. The leaves are changing color, and the creeks are still swollen with runoff from recent rains. It really is enchanting. 

 
Knowing that tomorrow is almost certainly going to be rainy, I walked a little farther than I had anticipated. I'm glad I did. I'm camped at a stealth site on the shore of Rainbow Lake. I'm alone here, which seems fitting for my last night in the 100-Mile Wilderness.

Fog and mist obscured all views on Rainbow Ledges from which, on a clear day, you can see both Katahdin to the north and White Cap to the south. But a few minutes into the descent from Rainbow Ledges, I was treated to a different kind of view. I had just cleared my throat loudly, when I heard a similar sound behind me. I turned to see a young bull moose trotting toward me. He stopped as soon as I faced him. We stared at each other for a while, both fascinated by the other, before I continued on my way.

This afternoon, I ""helped"" Skipper and Potato work on a devilishly complicated jigsaw puzzle. 
The difficulty has been twofold. The weather has been much nicer than predicted, so the rocks on Katahdin have dried. Perhaps more emotionally difficult has been seeing the thru-hikers who have summited in the last couple of days. It's great to be reunited with people who pulled ahead of me near the end, but I feel as if I should be out there, climbing Mama K myself.

The air felt mild and pleasant this morning, but the sky clouded over and the temperature dropped through the day. 

 
Park rules required me to check in to The Birches with at the nearby ranger station. There, I learned that early this morning, a ranger had taken down the sign-up list with my name on it and replaced it with a blank sign-up sheet. Several hikers had signed both sheets, but some, like me, had signed only one. Unsurprisingly, there were now more than 12 people signed up for the dozen spaces at The Birches. Ranger Jesse told me he'd allocate one of the dozen spaces to me and deal with the overlooking when others showed up. On the premise that possession is nine tenths if the law, I didn't waste any time getting to the campsite and pitching my tent.

I remarked that I'll miss the camaraderie of the trail, where a dozen people, most of whom haven't met before, will spontaneously gather around a fire, join in easily-flowing conversation of common interest, and enjoy each other's company for a few hours.
The weather forecast still looks good for summiting tomorrow, but a frost warning is in effect for tonight and tomorrow morning. My water filter is inside my tent, and I'm wearing more layers of clothing to bed than I have since March or early April.
Beyond the weather, a flotilla of thoughts and feelings is sailing through my head as I bed down tonight. This will be my last night on trail. Tomorrow will be one of the most physically demanding days of hiking, capped by the exhilaration of summiting Mama K, having earned the right to stand proudly on the famous sign on Baxter Peak. It will also be the last day of my thru-hike, which mixes a dash of uncertainty and sadness into my intense anticipation about what's in store.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658412,"Sleep was in short supply at The Birches last night. I was awake for a good part of the night, and so were others. By 5:15 this morning, almost everyone was up, with headlamp beams criss-crossing the campsite as we prepared for our big day. Under a starry sky, the temperature had dropped into the upper 30s, but there was no evidence of the predicted frost. 
We carried our packs to nearby Katahdin Stream Campground, where we left all but the day's essentials in a designated lean-to. Food bags were hoisted on nearby bear cables. I signed the trail register at 6:55 and started up the mountain with a light load as dawn was transforming to daylight. 
The trail began on a smooth gravel path, becoming steeper and more rugged as it progressed up the mountain. Apart from a group of dayhikers I passed as they took a break, I was alone for the first hour. 
A transformation took place above treeline, about a third of the way up the mountain. The trail became a challenging class 4 scramble. Spectacular views opened up. The sun started to warm the rocks. And more hikers materialized. The excitement among thru-hikers was palpable. Over the shoulder of the mountain, on the Tablelands, a procession of day hikers merged who had climbed the Abol Trail merged with those of us who had come up the AT. 

 
From a mile away, I could see people on the summit. My pace quickened as my excitement grew. This was it! Only a short climb separated me from the capstone of a nearly seven-month adventure. My heart pounded from the combination of excitement and exertion as I rushed up the last steep section. 
Under a cloudless sky, I took the last few steps more deliberately, touched the famous sign marking the end of the trail, and rested my head against it for a few moments. I couldn't imagine a more appropriate way to end such a long, difficult, and rewarding journey. It took a few minutes to compose myself before I climbed up on the sign for the traditional summit photo. 
I lingered at the summit for an hour, savoring the emotions, congratulating other thru-hikers, enjoying the perfect weather, and taking in the gorgeous views in all directions. 
It took a little more than three hours to climb down the mountain, on the Abol Trail this time. Less technically difficult than the AT/Hunt Trail, the Abol was nonetheless steep and exposed. It was made more challenging by the loose rocks underfoot. My acrophobia kicked in, taking my mind off the summit for a while. During the descent, I learned that a day hiker just a few minutes behind me had taken a serious tumble and fractured his wrist. 
I rode a shuttle with nine other thru-hikers to the AT Lodge in Millinocket. Being a returning guest, I was able to check in quickly, grab the same loaner clothes I had worn before, shower, and get my laundry started before the rest of the crowd. 
Castor, a LASHer who had also camped at The Birches last night and summited today, joined me for dinner at the Scootic Inn. Hikers mingled among different tables, sharing the celebrations. 
THANKS:Although I carried the pack and walked the five million steps, it wouldn't have been possible without the help of others. I'm grateful to all who helped and supported me in ways big and small. My friends have been unanimously supportive.  Uplifting messages, both direct and here in the Guest Book, frequently buoyed my mood when I was feeling down. Innumerable people I met along the trail were generous with their time, and often their money. Healthcare providers helped prepare my body for what was to come. Most importantly, I thank my core support team, Joanne, Dustin, Shoelace, Neon, and Richard for being there for me throughout this adventure. They stepped up whenever I asked...and frequently when I didn't. 
REFLECTIONS:In the coming days and weeks, I'll add post-hike reflections to this journal.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658528,"Thru-hiking the AT is anything but easy. A completion rate of 18% attests to that. But not everybody who wants to thru-hike is able to make the attempt. It takes money and time, a lot of both. Support from family and friends can make a difference, too. I'm indescribably grateful to have had the opportunity to attempt it. I'm also grateful that my body held up as well as it did. I'm proud of my own perseverance. This adventure has been an experience of a lifetime. 
""Thru-hiker"" became part of my identity. It's what I did. My world was divided into hikers and muggles. I'll miss having that instant rapport with people I had never met before. I'll miss the hardships and the rewards, too. I think military vets have similar challenges returning to civilian life. 
The morning after we summited, I visited a barbershop to have my hair and beard reduced to their pre-hike length (shortness). I joked that I might not be permitted to reenter the hostel with my new look. I had debated keeping my shaggy dog look for a couple weeks, but I decided to make the transition to post-hike life as quickly as possible, to rip off the Band-Aid. I'll forever carry precious memories of life on the trail, but there's no sense living in the past.
Later that morning, Shoelace drove Slug and me to his home in Exeter, ME. He and his wife Jenn fed us a lobster dinner and hosted us overnight. The following day, he took me to the Bangor airport for my flight home. My carry-on got tagged for manual inspection. The TSA officer, when he pulled out my food bag, asked me whether it was an Ursack, which led to a short, friendly conversation about hiking. After that, I was in a different world, where strangers rarely make eye contact, let alone talk to one another. Changing planes in Newark, I saw more people than I had typically seen in a month. All this I observed from a distance, as if it wasn't real.
Now that I've been home for 24 hours, it's reassuring that things are pretty much as I remembered them, with a few exceptions. I have some new neighbors. My morning routine wasn't very routine; even getting dressed seemed like a chore because I had to decide what to wear. A few times today, I had to pause and think about where things in my kitchen were stored. I drove for the first time in nearly seven months, getting to and from the supermarket without incident. I was also reminded that minivan drivers still drive like minivan drivers.
Thoughts and emotions are still swirling around my head. It'll take a while for them to settle into recognizable patterns, so I'll continue to post here from time to time.",,View Entry,"Oct 03, Mon",0
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658540,"A thru-hike exerts a toll not only on the body but also on gear and clothing. I'm grateful for the many friends who acted as my supply chain.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658850,"It's been a little more than two weeks since I summited. As my life transitions back to pre-hike ""normal"", some adjustments have been easier than others. 
Sleep has been tricky. It took about a week to adjust to sleeping in a bedroom rather than a tent. My activity level has declined, so I haven't felt as tired as I did at the end of every day on the trail. Perhaps most significantly, I haven't had the consistent daily routine of going to bed when it gets dark. I need to muster the self-discipline to start a bedtime routine at the same time every night.
Hiker hunger hasn't been as difficult to control as I expected. I've found it fairly easy to bypass the calorie-rich processed foods in the supermarket, and I haven't eaten ice cream since I left Maine. At an event a couple days ago, I had no trouble declining the fresh donuts that were offered. Ditto for the snack foods on the table at a meeting I attended. Portion control has been a bit more challenging, and I've had cravings for after-dinner snacks. But overall, my diet is approaching what it was pre-hike.
I'm still adjusting to being called by my government name instead of my trail name. A couple times when introducing myself, I've had to pause for a beat to think of which name to use. 
It's been interesting to notice physical and muscular changes. Most notably, my right leg is significantly stronger than my left. It's also tighter, less flexible. That's a result of subconsciously relying on my right leg to protect my left Achilles tendon, which bothered me for the duration of the hike. 
My flexibility and mobility have declined overall. Aggressive use of trekking poles kept my triceps strong. My biceps, chest, back, and shoulders have weakened a lot. Push-ups are really difficult, and I've found pull-ups to be nearly impossible. My core muscles have weakened, too, but only a little. 
One change puzzles me: my resting heart rate has increased about 5 bpm. Perhaps it's because I was mostly operating well below max VO2, even though the climbs made me breathe hard. 
An area of notable improvement has been balance. I sensed the change while I was on trail, and I've confirmed it at home: balancing exercises that were challenging pre-hike are noticeably easier to perform now. I chuckled last week as I completed the pre-visit questionnaire for my annual physical exam; it asked whether I had fallen in the past 30 days. I lied.",,View Entry,"Oct 17, Mon",0
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659455,"It’s been nearly two months since I summited Katahdin, yet it feels as if it was just a few days ago. I miss the simplicity of trail life, having a challenging, tangible goal, and the camaraderie I found on the trail. I’ve been treated like a rock star since I’ve been home. The congratulations keep coming, and people want to hear about it. I know, however, that the novelty will wear off soon, and the same people will eventually tire of my trail stories. I’m beginning to feel an urge to do something else adventurous. It’s too easy to slip into a comfortable existence. Indoor plumbing, central HVAC, and fresh food can be seductive.
To recapture some of the trail experience, I celebrated Thanksgiving yesterday with some of the AT hiker community. Miss Janet, trail angel extraordinaire (see https://www.trailjournals.com/...), hosts an annual Hiker Family Thanksgiving dinner in Hot Springs, NC for current and former AT hikers. I picked up SOBO thru-hiker Greenleaf at the Dennis Cove traihead near Hampton, TN, and drove him to Laughing Heart Lodge and Hostel in Hot Springs. 
We were treated to a beautiful sunny day, with temperatures reaching into the sixties. Some 70 hikers attended. I joined a spirited wiffle ball game and socialized around the all-day bonfire. Among the hikers I met was a flip-flopper who had summited Katahdin the same day I did; he has two more days of hiking to complete his thru. I was also reacquainted with the hiking goat and her human (see https://www.trailjournals.com/...). Later, I helped carry food from the kitchen to the ""dining room"" in the chapel next door. Just before dinner, it was fun to watch heavily-bearded thru-hikers compete in a pie-eating contest. 
Dinner was laid out in a huge buffet-style spread in the chapel. In addition to the usual Thanksgiving staples, there were dozens of side items to choose from. I made three trips to the buffet. Although I tried to eat like a thru-hiker, I learned that my stomach has shrunk. After helping with post-meal cleanup, I still needed to go for a walk to settle my stomach. I eventually found my way back to the bonfire for some more conversation until well after dark. I finally made my way back to the lodge, where I slept in the same room I occupied in early April (see https://www.trailjournals.com/...). 

 
In marked contrast to yesterday, it was chilly, damp, and breezy this morning. It misted on and off while I drove Greenleaf back to the trailhead, where the temperature was 42° F. I miss trail life, but I don’t miss hiking on cold, wet mornings.
Some final observations:
My appetite, although still strong, has subsided. My weight seems to have stabilized at 150 pounds, somewhere between my starting and finishing weight. I’ve regained a little of my upper-body strength.I’ve been doing short, easy, day hikes a couple times a week. My left Achilles tendon still gets sore after a few miles. It’s annoying but not debilitating. I’m leaning toward living with it until it gets worse. After all, it didn’t stop me from hiking the AT.
This will probably be the last entry in this journal. The hike has been the adventure of a lifetime, and I’ve enjoyed sharing with others through these pages. Now, it's time to move on. Happy trails, y’all!",,View Entry,"Nov 25, Fri",0
