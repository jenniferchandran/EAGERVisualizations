Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598762,"In January 2017 my wife and I hiked a small spur trail out to the AT near Cherokee NC. Along the way we took a break in one of the shelters and talked about how cool it would be to hike some of the AT. Since I was a boy I had always dreamed of backpack hiking. 

As life would have it I got married very young (18), had three kids, got involved in a family business (that I now run), got a divorce, got married again but this time to a wonderful woman, life had put those dreams on hold. Here I was at 48 years old, never hiked much more than a 1 mile, that dream was just that, a dream. My wife also suffers MS which I thought made that dream all but impossible. But as we walked and hiked more I could see her get stronger as the weeks went by. So that one day as we rested at that shelter the seed was planted, all be it an impossible one looking at the overall picture.

As we drove home we talked about hiking some short trails closer to home to see if long distance hiking was even possible. As luck would have it we drove past a brown ""Palmetto Trail"" sign and said hey let's find out about it. With some research we found out it was a cross state trail that could be hiked sea to mountains or vice versa. So we set out to see just what we could do with no experience at all. You can read about our PT and Foothills adventures by selecting the 2017 link in the menu to the left.

What we did discover is that dream is no longer a dream. We might just be able to do it!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Mon",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598764,Our plans to maybe try the AT in sections in 2019 are now out the door. After a rough start to our 3rd PT thru hike and with work issues building we had to pull off the PT. So we are still just stuck with talking about that AT dream as we now realize being gone for 6 to 8 months is going to be a huge challenge.We will have to make some difficult choices to realize this dream.,,View Entry,"Apr 10, Tue",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598765,"So after 4 months off the PT and a lot happening over the past 4 months (full story under our 2018 PT hike in the link to the left) we now have committed to the AT, not a section hike but a full thru hike!To make it happen we have just over a year to get the business ready for us to take a 6 to 8 month leave of absence. We've already done alot but have more to do. That will handle our business life. Our personal lives will take a even bigger sacrifice. With both of us gone we have decided to sale our home, put all our belongings in storage and well be homeless during our hike!We are going to use the final PT hike this year and then the Long Trail, Foothills trail and Art Lobe trails in 2019 as our gear run down and final preps for the AT 2020. The dream is finally coming true!",,View Entry,"Jul 30, Mon",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600191,"Even with these crazy hot days and monsoon conditions we've be having here in the south we had to get out and start putting in some miles. We live in a community that never fully developed so we are the only house on our street and there are only 8 other homes in our neighborhood. 2 weeks ago we started out just doing several loops around our street and cul-de-sac getting in around 2 or 3 miles depending on the rain and this kept us close to home in case it stormed after taking 4 months off from the almost half completed PT hike and putting in a ton of hours at work. We also use the stairs in our home going up and down them 10 to 20 times taking 2 steps at a time, it does wonders getting you ready for steep trails. So up until this past Sunday that was our routine weather permitting for 2 weeks. Sunday we decided to go for bigger miles. At the back of our neighborhood there is over 300 acres that was never completed and allows us to push our mileage up to 5 to 10 depending if we want to make loops. So off we go as the weather finally looks like we will have time to do it without storms. By mile 3 my thigh area was starting to burn a little, to far from home to do anything about it so we push on. At mile 4 it's really hurting and if you've read our other journals you know this has been an issue for me and was part of the reason we slowed down, took zero's and ultimately pulled off the PT in April so this is a bigger bummer to say the least. So we cut the hike to 5 miles and head back home. By the time we are there and I can give it a look the chafed areas look like raw meat with a huge red area around it. So to make a long story short I've gotta figure this out as I've had issues with it on every hike and it seems to be getting worst!

Throughout last week we could not hike and I could hardly walk due to the pain but I researched and researched knowing I only have 8 weeks to get this figured out until we return to finish the PT. All answers seem to keep pointing me back to compression shorts. So thanks to Amazon the pairs I ordered arrived on Thursday just as we were leaving for a week longs trip to our land. By Saturday I had healed enough to try hiking and testing the new compression shorts. Lucky I order a few different sizes and after trying them on settled on a large. The fit and feel was a big improvement. So Saturday we put in a 8 mile day hiking our trails and even got caught in the rain and I'm so happy to report no more chafing issues!!!

We also are testing out several different shoes and have been rethinking a lot of our gear as well as food, cooking, etc. We are going to change things up a lot as we are using this final PT hike in 7 weeks and the hikes next year to prep for our AT thru hike in 2020 just 19 months away. Still working on a start date and really wish we could go next year but things just are not in place yet.

I think our next post will be on all the gear changes, choices and so forth. Until then we are back out getting in some miles.",,View Entry,"Aug 12, Sun",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601169,"So after listing our house for sale and starting the prep to finish our Palmetto Trail hike we decided to add the 77 mile Foothills trail thru hike on to the PT hike since they both have terminus in Oconee State Park. In the meantime we've been watching AT videos and reading. All this has motivated us to ramp up the preparations for the AT and in doing so we really started to think, Why wait until 2020? So after really mulling it over we have decided to shoot for 2019!Stay tuned as we will be updating a lot over the next few weeks on our gear, gear choices (we've learned a alot from our 3 thru hikes) and the changes we are making. We will be testing these changes on our PT and FT thru hikes in October.We are both super excited and nervous knowing in just 7 months our AT hike will start!",,View Entry,"Aug 23, Thu",0

Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607122,"So having to get off the PT in October also caused us to miss our Foothills Trail thru hike we had lined up for when we finished the PT but we had no choice. Back home the doctors gave us some bad news, Inchworm had Iliotibial Band Syndrome and should give it 6 months to heal. On the bright side it wasn't anything that needed surgery but was going to derail our AT start in March of this year. So we are now rethinking a lot of things and juggling our plans. At first we were thinking about a flip flop AT starting at the mid point in May and going north then dropping back to go south and finish in Georgia hopefully by early November. The undertaking of the AT would give us no chance to really test Inchworms knee as due to jobs and so forth we would have no time to do any other hikes. We started to realize taking on that big a hike everything needs to be just about perfect when we head out. So now we have shifted gears with plans to finish the PT first, then get the FT hike done. After that we plan to hit the Art Lobe trail and then in the fall thru hike the Benton Mackaye trail.
So that's where we are at now, once we have solid plans in place we will update everyone.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Mon",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614023,Today we officially registered our north bound flip flop hike with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy!

Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624083,"Sorry we have not updated in a while. We have been in full speed mode trying to get everything here ready for our hike next year. Back in March we finished up the hike of the PT and then went right on to the foothills trail thru hike. From there we took a break and in late May took a trip up to Harper's Ferry, visited the AT headquarters and planned to do the Art Loeb on our way back. As things would have it our trip was cut short due to the early arrival of our granddaughter in Florida. By the time we were able to think about the Art Loeb again it was mid summer and we had to start getting things done here at home. We are going all in on this hike! In the last 8 weeks we sold off both of our cars and all our properties closing on the last one this past Monday. We had to find someone willing to rent to us for just 7 months, then get packed and moved. It has been chaos these past few weeks. So now we are asset free (our only car is my company car) and completely focused on this hike. Pretty sure everyone around us thinks we are crazy but if you've ever done a long distance hike you'd understand. It is so much better to not have the worries about all our stuff back home, bills getting paid, etc and to know you have all the funds needed to do the hike. Our only worries will be family and work (I will be working remotely as I can while on the trail). Like I said we are ALL IN on this hike. Right now we are looking at trying to get the Art Loeb trail done sometime in the next few weeks before it gets too cold. Will be updated more often now as we get ready for the hike over the next 7 months. Super excited but it all feels so surreal that this is actually finally happening!",,View Entry,"Oct 11, Fri",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625549,"Hope everyone had a great holiday and a even better new year ahead! I know ours is going to be a very exciting one! 
The last few weeks has kept us busy as we host all the holidays for our families. We have not posted in a while so hopefully this post won't duplicate info from our past entries. 
So we did not get the Art Loeb trail in before the holidays and it looks like we won't get it before the AT hike. Hoping to get a final shake down hike in before April, most likely somewhere on the PT since it is fairly close by. We've been focused on the gym (Inchworm killed in on the climber look at the stats in the picture), work (getting everyone trained for me not to be available for days on end) and planning.
The craziest thing happened to me in early November. I was awoken with pain and a cracking sound in my front side tooth around 4 in the morning. I go to the bathroom and it is loose and very painful. By 8 am I'm calling every dentist in our town only to find out none of them are open on a Friday. To top it all off we are the guest speakers at the PCF's (Palmetto Conservation Foundation) Trail Talk Tuesday in just 5 days. I finally find a dentist able to see me in a larger city over an hour away. To make a long story short I suffer from bruxism (grinding your teeth in your sleep) and some how I broke my tooth in half just below the gum line. After a 45 minute extraction, bone graft and stitches I was in no shape to be a guest speaker. I had to go 3 weeks missing the front tooth and finally had a temporary maryland bridge put in while I have to wait until Feb to get a implant put in. The wait is so the bone graft can cure and I can heal. This whole crazy experience will end up costing us over $6,000 for just this one tooth. But the dentist doing the final work has assured me he will have everything done and I'll be healed before May. Sometime you just never know what the next day will bring you. On the bright side it did not happen while we were hiking.
So looking forward need to start getting our supply drop boxes ready. We plan to make around 10 boxes for the first part of our hike, Harpers Ferry to Katahdin. My office will ship them as we need them. Still need to work through all our gear and clothes to get our final base weights. We also have to pack everything back up for the movers. We are really starting to feel how fast time is moving. Our count down start at 346 days and today it sits at 129!",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Thu",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625596,"On our first ever long distance hike, one that eventually turned into a thru hike of the PT (Palmetto Trail) we just winged it since it was supported. When we did our 2nd thru hike of the PT it was unsupported. So we made a hike plan. We did this to kind of get an idea of how long it should take, where supplies would be needed, etc. As it always is when long distance hiking you can't really follow a schedule, you have no idea of what the weather will bring, how you will feel every day and so forth. But what a hike plan does do is it gives you a better understanding of your hike, about where you need to be at certain intervals and most importantly if your falling too far behind. We use a simple google spreadsheet to do it. When doing the PT we used the passage maps they provided on their website and google maps. 
It has taken just over a month to finally finish off the first part of our hike, Harpers Ferry to Katahdin using the Guthook Guide, The A.T. Guide and google maps. We take into account places that we can camp, the topo of each day of hiking, etc. What we learned was that starting May 11th left us very little margin for error or time off the trail if it is needed. So today we made one of the first big decision of this hike! We moved our start date up 7 days to May 4th. So we re-registered our hike with the AT and made reservations at the Quality Inn in Harpers Ferry, it's just .2 miles off the trail. Now keep in mind once we are on the trail all this hard work won't amount to a lot each day as we will rarely be inline with the mileage and planned camping/sleeping plans. But it already has made us look really hard at our timelines and make adjustments. Then once we are out there it will help us kind of keep track of whether we are ahead or behind our time line. Ahead then we may want to take some extra zeros or neros, behind then we know we gotta pick up some extra miles when and where we can.
Next week we will start planning out our supply drops, where we may need them (another place our hiking plan will help) and creating them. With the changed timeline we are now exactly 4 months from our start date!",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Sat",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625629,"If you've followed our past hikes then you will most likely remember that in 2018 for our 3rd PT hike and our 2nd Foothills Trail thru hike we opted to go stove less. We did create a way to get warm food via heating water from a camp fire. What we learned was it worked pretty well and allowed us to cut over 1.5 pounds off my base weight by eliminating the stove, gas tank and pot, dropping our total camp cooking weight to 3.7 ounces. All this just takes a little extra planning as most freeze dried foods will need about and hour to re-hydrate with cold water and most others that you add water too will work as well. It takes a little getting use to but for the most part we had warm meals when we wanted using the modified titanium cup to heat the water. So after reviewing all the options again yesterday, the pros & cons, weights, ability to visit towns we have decided to again just carry the modified cup, the msr folding spork which we share and a light oven mitt with a total weight coming in at 3.7 ounce.

Going 2,200 miles we've learned from our past hikes that every ounce is going to count!",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Tue",0

Taking that first step on the trail will be so exciting, maybe our paths will cross on the trail but if not Happy New Year and best wishes on completing the trail!On that thought there are many approaches to hiking long distance, some just wing it, some are just there spiritually, some are business like and analytical. We are kinda of all of these. Before we hit the trail we are business like and analytical. Once out there we both start feeling spiritual, on some days we just wing it and others we go back to being business like. What we are saying is there is no right or wrong way to do this. For us our way seems to work and we share it, for others it might seem too much business like right now. The point is we are sharing our hikes so family, friends and anyone interested in following along can. If your doing a hike remember your way is the best way, HYOH!",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Wed",0

It's gone from just wanting to try doing the AT, to talking about it, to starting to plan it, to having to delay it and now OMG we are about to do it. As each day passes by we get all kinds of emotions hitting us with it this close. The anxiousness is crazy sometimes! It's not like we don't know what we are getting into, I'm pretty sure we do, it's more about wanting to get it started and waiting for May 4th to get here.

Last night we searched for AT thru hiking videos on you tube, something we have not done it a while and came across one that we both really enjoyed watching. It's very well put together and narrated. The entire 2019 thru hike is in one video and its just over 50 minutes long. It's titled ""Into The Wild, My Journey on the Appalachian Trail"" by Julia Sheehan.

Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626167,"So we've started boxing up everything but the basics. One room is nothing but boxes. Over the past two weeks we have went through our gear 3 times, double checking, figuring out what we can eliminate, making sure everything is still working properly and trying to squeeze ounces off the base weights. I think we are there and plan to put out a gear video this weekend showing our base gear, explaining why we choose it, the items weights, our approach to the gear and giving what should be our final base weights.

Right now our plan is to have 5 or 6 drop resupplies for an as needed basis. I still believe once we are out there we will be able to get everything we need from the trail resupplies so the drop boxed are really a just in case option. Well not all of them, some will have replacement items in them if we need them.

Another bit of exciting news is we had a conference call with some production executives from the Meredith Corp (https://www.meredith.com/) and they have expressed interest in our hike. Everything is preliminary right now but they may send a film crew to us before we head out and then follow us to Harpers Ferry and film the start of our hike. I think the plan would then be to document the hike and completion. Right now we don't know exactly what the full plan is but are really excited about this!

Well I've always had back problems but this time its moved into my hip. I think I over worked it and oh boy did it let me know it this weekend. So now I'm in the heating pad and cold pack rotation trying to get the pain in check. Thankfully its feeling better today but now we have to take things pretty easy until we head out.

From the moment the lock downs started to the ATC basically closing the trail indefinitely (a decision we respect and agree with). Inchworms MS puts her at high risk so she's really been limited these past 8 weeks.

Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647438,"So after 4 years and so many disappointing things happening we are finally starting our hike,  but not without hiccups. After reserving our one-way rental car 4 months ago with the only place we could find within an hours drive we show up to a massively long line. After 30 minutes we start asking folks further up how long have you been here and they say almost 2 hours. We are like wholly cow and there are at least 100 folks ahead of us. Our reservation was at the Savannah GA Airport and as more planes land the line grows. Finally someone comes out and say they have the cars but are backed way up as they are without car cleaners. We are like at this pace we will be here all day. We did notice the Avis Preffered line had like 10 folks in it so we are like how do we get to be an Avis Preffered customer. So we go sign up to be one and then jump over to that line and are 9th in line. We finally get up to the counter after an hour and the rep says your reservation wasn't on your preffered status and we are like we forgot. She says be sure to do it next time and hands us our rental agreement and say just wait for your car. 30 minutes later we have our car... so happy that worked out! So tonight we are halfway to the trail hanging in Augusta GA chilling in a hotel. Tomorrow we leave at 6 am to meet our shuttle driver Dave for the ride to Amicalola Falls State Park vistor office for our hiker tags and the first 1 mile of the approach trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Mon",0
Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647459,"The day started super early as we had to get the rental car turned in by 11am in Roswell, Ga and AT Dave was shuttling us to Amicalola Falls park for us to start the hike. Most of the shorter routes took us near Atlanta and traffic backups making a 2 hour and 45 min drive we'll over 3 hours plus. So we knew we had to get on the road early to make sure we make it on time. 

We are up at 6 am and on the road by 6:40 am. The GPS rerouted us several times due to traffic and accidents, but we ended up making it there by 10:15 am. After a very quick hour drive Dave got us to the hiker registration area in the park. Inchworm ended up with hiker number 1382 and I with 1381. Inchworms weighed in at 13.1 poinds but accidentally left her trekking poles on it (she never stows them on her pack and is awlays using them) so she was more like 12.4 pounds. I came in at 24.7 pounds and was very happy with that. After a short hiker briefing we were almost off. As we were leaving a fellow thru hiker wandered in, she was no more than 5 foot 2 and maybe 110 pounds. Her pack engulfed her. She struggled to take it off as it plummeted to the floor. Both ATC volunteers helped her with it. They both said your packs is way to heavy. The one that gave us our breifing came over and said wow look at that pack while the other weighted it. The heaviest pack they have ever weighted was just over 75 pounds and this poor girls pack was over 65 pounds! We left but sure hope they were able to help her get it down in weight. The park was full of day hikers and tourists making the hike up to the lodge a little difficult and very crowded. Still don't understand why in that environment they constantly will not give way to someone with a big pack trying to get by them.

We started with some pretty good ascends but they were mostly paved. Although it was a lot of steps (690 plus) up the falls it was way easier than heartbreak ridge on the Foothills Trail. We were so ahead of schedule we had to wait 2 hours to get our room at the lodge.

So now we stage until Thursday and then finish off the approach trail.","Amicalola Vistor Center

Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647532,"We started today in a damp 49 degree fog at 7:45 am. Our plan was to hike to either Black Gap Shelter about 6 miles to get ourselves acclimated to hike again and see how we feel. The first 3 miles were pretty much a breeze with a a lot rest stops. Not a single hiker past us. The next 3 really kicked Inchworms butt. We reached Black Gap Shalter at 4:15 pm and rested at the shelter. We also started to cold soak our chicken and rice dinner. At 4:45 pm we decided to push on and Summit Springer Mountain and see our 1st AT white blaze and did .3 miles of the AT.

It was another extremely tough 2 miles but we finally submitted Springer at 6:45 pm. It was such an overwhelming feeling after those tough miles.

Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647672,"Today started with an early pre-dawn packup and tent take down. We start hiking as daylight appears. We were not sure what today held as the weather was calling for rain around 1pm and maybe thunderstorms. We will hike through the rain but when lightning starts we hunker down.

We have 3 miles in by 11:30 am, however Inchworm had taken 3 falls already, one crossing a stream and she fell into it. It was small but she got pretty wet. We started to hear thunder after those 3 miles and then the rain began. We decided to put up the tent. The last weather forecast a saw said once started it would last until 2 am or so. So we figured we might be in the tent until tomorrow morning, a whooping 17 or 18 hours, ugh. So we pulled out our sleeping gear to nap for a bit. With it being around 50 degrees it felt good in our warm bags. The lightning and thunder made it a little hard to fall asleep but we did.

We wake to quiet with very little rain hitting the tent. We have no cell service so I use the inreach to get a weather report. It looks like there is a break for until around 8 pm or so. So we pack up and start hiking again at 4:30 pm. By 6:30 pm we have another 3 miles done but the rain is starting up again. This time it is way colder and the wind is really picking up. So a quick check on Far Out and we see there is a church Cemetery ahead that has bathrooms (composting ones), a covered pavilion and is hiker friendly just .1 miles off trail. We get there and find 7 other thru hikers already there. We start cold soaking our dinner under the pavilion meeting the other hikers but the wind is unrelenting and the temperatures dropping. I set up the tent and we retreat to it for warmth. It is so cold our dinner is not rehydrating well and we added too much water. It's not very good but we eat what we can. It's gonna be a cold, rainy and windy night. Inchworm ended the day a little beat up with 5 total falls and sore ankle when going up and down steep parts of the trail. So fingers crossed 🤞 it doesn't become a problem.","Just past Springer Mountain

Mule and Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647696,"After a windy, rainy, cold night we got a late start at 9 am with the cold morning, the goal was to make Gooche Gap. We cruised the first part to Hightower Gap. There we met up with Bulldog, Someday, Michael and Lamson. Everyone but Micheal and us were heading to Dahlonega to regroup.

The next 3.5 miles were pretty brutal and took a toll on Inchworm. The climb up Sassafras Mountain was no joke and we hit our first traffic jam with over 15 hikers bunched up inching our way up. It also had Inchworms ankle hurting on every climb and descent. By the time we reached Cooper's Gap at 7 pm Inchworm had matched the past 2 days fall count at 5. We also hit our first trail magic with hotdogs, sodas, chips and little Debbie fudge cakes.

We decided to make a tough decision and take a few days off to rest, soak and nurse Inchworms ankle before it gets bad. So we got a shuttle over to Dahlonega and are staying in the heart of the town with plenty of places to eat, doordash and instacart for all our needs. We will hit the trail again on Wednesday if we can find a shuttle back, working on that right now. Fingers crossed we can get a ride back.","Hickory Flats Cemetery

It was tough packing up our packs and beyond hard getting the tent down. We could only get it halfway into its stuff sack with frozen fingers and the wind. Luckily our shuttle showed up just as we were getting the tent down. Couldn't imagine having to wait up there at that elevation with those temps and wind.

Once in Dahlonega our hotel room wasn't gonna be ready till 3 pm so we went to Starbucks for coffee and to get our videos out. Then to a local outdoor shop to resupply called Woodlands Edge, it surprisingly had some real thru hiker stuff. From there we hit the town park to dry out our tent and get it back into its stuff sack properly. We have became hiker trash super fast.

We were like well we are arriving back on the trail in a limo soooooo. Lol.

We arrive 1:30 pm back on the trail at Cooper's Gap. It was windy, misty and cold.

We've had strong winds almost every day we have been on trail. Today's goal is to get as close to Neels Gap as the trail allows. There is a 5.4 mile section before Neels Gap that requires a bear canister due to heavy bear activity. So our stopping point will be close to Jarrard Gap but not all the way there. It is a pinch point where all thru hikers will be staging tonight, and there is a lot of them.Not long after Woody Gap the trail climbs steeply and takes a turn for the rocky. Next we are greeted with Preacher Rock and outstanding views. The last few days have provided some great views. Even after Preacher Rock the trail stays challenging but we arrive at our spot .3 miles before Jarrard Gap at 4:30 pm. We still have over 3 hours of daylight but we have to stop here. We have been cold soaking our food but the cold temperatures are making it hard to rehydrate it.

All that with the weather turning super cold and the wind picking up as the afternoon was fading. We hit Neels Gap at 3:30 pm and it was flooded with thru hikers. They only had cheese pizzas left and the wait for it was about an hour. We destroyed it. Almost everyone was getting off trail due to the dropping temperatures and 50 mph winds forecast for the high elevations.

Inchworms jumps to the offer with a bold Yes! All the hotels in Blairsville were booked so we ended back here in Dahlonega Ga taking a Zero while this cold front passes. Hotel rooms are almost double their normal rate due to hiker demand. Shout out to Cardinal Trail Shuttle 912-713-8601 for getting us off before the bad weather.

Regardless we set out and climb almost 800 ft to 4,000 ft of elevation now the temps are 28 degrees with winds at 30 to 40 mph giving us a windchill of around the low teens.

 By noon the trail is shifting from one side of the mountain to the other giving us some relief from the wind. We are able to eatucnh at Wolf Laurel Top without wind and shed some warm layers. After that we dive to lower elevations only to climb to look back at our lunch break spot and also see downtown  Atlanta since the cold front cleared out the skies.

The day is filled with big climbs and ascends. Giving us trail magic at both Tasneetae and Hogpen Gaps.

Turns out the trail is still as easy as yesterday and we make it to Rock Gap by 10:45 am. Before we get there we reach out to our shuttle and get it moved up to 12:30 pm.

We meet Crocks, anothe AT thr hiker, he is trying to do the AT in 100 days. But with the bad weather he is wanting to get off the trail. We tell him he can join our shuttle and he agrees. Not longer after someone pulls over and ask if anyone needs a ride to Franklin. He only has room for one so we encourage Crocks to take the ride and he does. As we are waiting for the shuttle the rain begins and the temps drop. We take shelter under a tree but still get pretty wet. Our shuttle arrives early and we are off to Franklin.

Bobbie the Greek, our shuttle driver takes us to Ingles first so we can grab some supplies for the hotel room which helped a lot since we won't have a way around. Also we had Beth reach out, trail name Layers, she works at Mountain Crossings where we lost on inreach mini to let us know she has it and offers to drive it the 1 hour and 15 minutes to us tomorrow. How awesome is that! We settle into the Comfort Inn,  but as soon as I see the bed I'm concern. It's as soft as a cotton ball, soft saggy beds wreak havoc on my back. 

Wednesday we meet Layers for the inreach and though we still have chores to do all agree to meet up later for dinner. After dinner Layers takes Nikki, another thru hiker we've been passing back and forth every day, to walmart for a resupply. We all have a great time at dinner and walmart.

Thursday I wake up to severe back pain that progressively gets worst throught out the day. By the afternoon I can hardly walk. I decide to sleep on the floor that night and also extend our zeros until Monday April 11th. So we rent a car off the Turo app since no car rental companies have any cars these days and find a small house to rent that has firm memory mattress. I also go to urgent care for a steroid shot. 

We decide since we are off trail to do trail magic on Saturday and Sunday. However it turns out a winter storm was setting in Friday evening. Saturday morning we are up early and head to MCD's to get a bunch of sausage biscuits, we also have a ton of chips and drinks. We find the snow and temps dropping at the higher elevations and serve up warm biscuits to many at Winding Stairs Gap and also shuttle several to town. Our next run was up to Wayah Bald at 5,337 ft of elevation. The drive up was almost all white roads and slow. We weren't sure we would find any hikers up there as the temp had dropped to 24 degrees and the snow was steadly falling.

Not long after arriving we were able to feed 4 thru hikers with warm burgers and coffee. None wanted a shuttle off but we were glad to not be out there in that.

So even with the issues we are having we turned lemons into lemonade and had a good time doing it. It really helped me get over the anger over my back which had improved from the shot.Sunday, we spent the morning finishing off videos, repacking gear and the resupply while also going over our plan. The place we are staying does not have good wifi so we have to find a place to get the video uploaded. My back is still an issue but hopefully manageable as we head back out tomorrow. Fingers crossed we can keep things going. Too much pain equals very little fun. We also did some more trail magic today delivering Burger King burgers, beer, chips, candy and an assortment of drinks, then shuttled 2 hikers to Gooder Grove Hostel and donating all the goodies we had left as well the cooler, can't take it with us.So back at it tomorrow......... and see what the trail delivers and my body can handle...","1.7 miles past Albert Mountain
