BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646205,"I'm gonna start planning my spring section. After looking hard at my target area (Smoky Mtns. to Hot Springs), resupply and shuttle options, I''ll make a few different crude plans so I can adjust as time nears and more variables are known (work schedule, family schedule, Covid and weather - not neccesarily in that order) 
The photo included is my brother-in-law Luis and I at Pulpit Rock in PA in November of 2021.
It is here, more than a decade ago, that I first set foot on the AT.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sat",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646210,"I pulled out my most recent copy of Awol’s “The AT Guide” (2021) last night and did some pregame. I am thinking I would optimally like to start at the NOC and hike north to Hot Springs. This would nearly split in half the 274-ish miles I have remaining in the south and leave me with one (hopefully) more section hike on the southern end to finish that end in 2023, and I can then start to attack the northern end with a longer section hike each year.

     I’m thinking I’ll spot my car in Hot Springs, and get a shuttle to the NOC. Do two or three easy days, stay a night at a Fontana area establishment, resupply, and hit the Smoky’s. Do another five easy days to Gatlinburg – shower, eat, sleep, resupply, then pick up the pace a bit and finish the Smoky’s in another fivie-ish days, after which I’ll hope to do a light resupply at Standing Bear, (maybe a shower- I really try to not do more than five days without when on trail), and finish the rest in two or three days.

     This, of course, is tentative, but it’s a plan I can work with. I’ll keep you (and myself) updated. 
     I also found a good deal this morning on my favorite freeze dried meal: Mountain House Biscuits and Gravy. I bought six. I will have nine when Amazon delivers them. I’ll probably only use four or five for my section – I like them to be a special breakfast so I have oatmeal or a bar(or nothing) for breakfast the majority of the mornings – but I do like to keep a few around so I have them.

     New Year’s weekend is now over -tomorrow I have to go back to work (if the snow isn’t too bad – the weather guessers are calling for 4-5 inches here in southern New Jersey) and pretend to buy in to the rat race, so I may not journal – but I’ll try and get one or two a week in until I leave (late April – early May)


The photo includes people I care much for - at the rehearsal dinner for my daughter's wedding this past October. Please allow me to introduce them to you. 2nd row, L to R: Daniella, Christian (son), Michele (wife) Alicia (daughter/bride), and Trevor (fiance/ now son-in-law). That's me in the first row. I'll post hiking pics when I hike.",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Sun",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646224,"Been eating way too much - I'm eating like I'm on trail and burning 6k calories a day - I am not. My work can sometimes be quite physical - but a day at work is no hike on the AT!My photo today features the first vittles I ate on a recent visit to Branson, Missouri. Damn, the BBQ was sooo good out there. I want to share with you the gravity of my ""situation"" with food. Certainly, one can derive an inkling of what I struggle with, but, in this case, a picture is not worth a thousand taste buds....
To have a more enjoyable section hike in a few months, my near-term focus needs to be on eating appropriate foods in appropriate amounts at appropriate times. Gotta lay off the homemade Christmas cookies, among other things! (We have about ten types of delicious cookies that number in the hundreds, here in the house, within reach at all times...)
I have been walking a few miles a few times a week, but I gotta up the effort.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Mon",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646229,"Although winter is settling in here in the Mid-Atlantic region, and we have had snow and cold these past few days, the sun came out this afternoon, and gave us comparatively (at least for the past day or so) enjoyable weather. Whenever an awesome sky view (typically a sunrise or sunset), presents itself, I feel blessed. It has an essence all its own. Taking a moment to enjoy a sky view often has a positive effect on my perspective, and I make an effort to enjoy them. Oftentimes (but not often enough), I can capture a photo to remind me of my experience. Funny how, although a picture rarely gives a view justice, it often can assist me in remembering how I felt when I was there....
     The picture for today is a great example. I cannot remember exactly which shelter I woke up in when I experienced that sunrise, but I remember how I felt - All was good in my world. I was on trail for a night or two, had a fire the night before - in which I heated up some homemade (leftover) pizza in foil I had packed in, and I had shed the cares of day to day living for a couple of days. T'was a slice of serenity.
     So, you see, for me, the picture is more than just a shot of a sunrise, I see the picture, and I remember how I felt cooking and eating my pizza after a great day hiking on the trail. I remember how warm I felt in my bag eating breakfast, drinking my coffee and watching the sun rise. I remember, for a short while, NOT remembering the hundreds of things that badger me most regular days, and feeling I was right where I was supposed to be. Ahh. Life on the trail increases the likelihood of these type experiences.",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Tue",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646248,"Yup. Gonna yo-yo the AT after I finish section hiking it.
Gonna tackle the Eastern Continental Trail too, but I may be ok with road walking and do The American Discovery Trail first.
After all that road walking, I'll notch the PCT, and since I'll only need one more for the triple, I'll do the CDT.
After that, I'll see what Nimblewill has done and I haven't, and try and do some of that. Anyone ever hiked the Eastern Greenway yet?
Damn, I think as my eyes focus and my dog Lola barks to go out and pee......(That's Lola in the picture - No she didn't have to pee when that shot was taken....)",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Wed",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646273,"Disappointed with the entry I submitted yesterday. The posting was not even an outline of the entry I prepared, then somehow lost when I tried to submit. I spent some time writing what I thought was good hiker fodder. I had explained, with detailed examples, some of the long-distance hikes I sometimes daydream about doing. Oh well, lesson learned.
     Spent some time looking at national Geographic map of the Smokies. Looked up the route I took on a highpointing hike to the summit of Guyot and Black some years back. That was an epic bushwhack near the summit, and the hike included a gnarly stream crossing in the early evening on the return leg. I also learned that the northern terminus of the Benton Mackaye Trail is located in the Smokies - as is the (western?) terminus of the Mountains to Sea Trail.
     I am making progress on the eating front. Portions eaten have been slightly more reasonable, and I am making use of one of my Christmas gifts - a variety pack of hot sauces - I am dashing tortilla chips with the hot sauce. Lots of carbs, but I tend to not overeat due to the heat factor - and it has successfully kept me from digging into the Christmas cookies that are always nearby and calling my name...(see photo).",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Thu",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646274,"The weekend has arrived. Yipee! On my way home from work on this last workday of the week, I lamented working and the fact that I am probably going to have to continue to work for quite a few more years. I was really hoping to retire a little early and maybe thru-hike a trail or two - maybe become a semi-serious golfer and a more than part time gardener. But then my ruminations became a bit more positive. I thought: Ya' know, the weekend wouldn't be so special if it wasn't for work. I wouldn't be as excited for the weekend if I didn't have the work experience and its various difficulties and challenges.
     It's easy for me to have and maintain a positive outlook when I am off work and doing something I enjoy. Its' often not so easy when my time is not my own - typically at work. Sometimes I feel I work so I can do what I want - but I don't want to work cause it takes up my time to do what I want. Indeed, one of my silly sayings is ""You either have the time and not the money, or you have the money and not the time"". 
     We had some heavy snow here for my morning drive. I woke early (4:30 am) to clear the cars, driveway, front steps and walks of snow. I drove to work and spent the very cold day seven stories in the air on a scaffold - welding steel clips and plumbing up the curtain wall framing we are installing at work. It was on my way home I had the ruminations and the subsequent change of perspective. That change of perspective was partly due to the realization and anticipation that the weekend was beginning. I was looking forward to the weekend - having time to do some of the things I wanted to do. 
      For similar reasons, it's good to have a section hike to anticipate. My section-hike is like my springend. I am so looking forward. Enough rambling for today.
     Just so you know, my job doesn't totally suck. Check out the photo for a memorable sunrise (skview) I shot from the top of a building in Philadelphia in March 2014.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Fri",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646310,"The weekend was busy. Christian's girlfriend was with us since Thursday and made the drive home to Long Island NY this afternoon while I was at work. It was good having her, she's a great girl. While she was here, we talked, played a few games and shared a dinner out together Saturday night, along with my daughter Alicia (who had driven down from Northern New Jersey to meet us at our nephew's high school wrestling match in the morning), and new son-in-law Trevor who came over after working Saturday (he never misses a meal - nor have I).
      My wife Michele and I (and dog Lola) squeezed a few miles in Sunday morning after breakfast before the heavier rains came. I was also able to get a good stretch in during the afternoon. I am convinced (for the 197th time) I would benefit greatly from a regular deep stretching routine. I can add that to the other routines/habits I really need to implement: regular exercise, better diet, more walking, along with the numerous tasks needing to be performed to finish a major home remodel (and oh, yeah, I am trying to journal regularly also). There are many more things I am trying to juggle, in addition to a full-time job and regular home maintenance, but you get the idea. In an effort to have more time to devote to these now higher priority endeavors, I have ceased umpiring baseball and softball games from April through October and officiating wrestling matches from December through March. I also reduced the size of my vegetable garden by 800 square feet this fall for next year. (I do believe I previously mentioned I did many different things for work and for fun...)     Today was a cold day at work. Took a portion of our Christmas light display down after work. Got a walk on the treadmill in tonight. Tomorrow is going to be the coldest day in a while - wind chills in the single digits all day - (good acclimation for winter hiking...)
     Hoping motivation supersedes procrastination, and we have some success. In lieu of another food photo, I chose to post something more motivational and symbolic today - a photo snapped while the wife and I were on a day hike on our recent trip to Missouri.",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Mon",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646316,"Really cold today - temps this am in the teens with single digit wind chills. We should build a monument to those responsible for creating the disposable hand warmers. They really help make the workday more bearable for those of us who must work outside (or hike...) in these conditions.     While thawing out enroute home from work, I tried to work out over the phone with my cousin Jay what to do, as it seemed our plans for the weekend were in jeopardy. We (Michele, Alicia and I) had had a tentative plan to visit with Jay and his family (Kate, Reilly and Evan) in NY and watch both of his sons wrestle. Unfortunately, the host school where Reilly was to wrestle Saturday declared spectators verboten (forbidden). Sad how our society has changed. After dinner tonight and some more phone calls and discussion amongst us, we decided to still go - we'd watch Evan wrestle Friday night, then spend the day together Saturday - there is a possibility a stream on the internet may be available to watch Reilly wrestle. I am super stoked to spend some quality family time with them.     I began preparations after a quick (for me) mile and a half on the treadmill. I worked the logistics on our drive and checked the weather for our time in NY, as I became aware just today of a possible snowstorm arriving Sunday night here in South Jersey. I was dismayed to discover that we may experience the coldest temps I ever have while visiting with Jay. The forecast low on Saturday in Oneonta is negative 5 degrees F! I hope I do not have trouble starting my car...     Thoughts of cold weather go hand in hand with thoughts of warmed baked goods (or hot chocolate, or soup - but I don't have any pics of those). I do have a pic of Clara Belle's World-Famous Cinnamon Bread, though. Folks wait in line throughout the day for almost an hour on average while visiting Silver Dollar City to get this stuff. Our curiosity (and love of baked goods) had us wait about an hour for ours. It was worth it.",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Tue",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646336,"Prepping for road trip tomorrow. Just got bags together and assembled my clothes and a cold weather gear outfit - Jay suggested taking a hike Saturday ""...up the hill behind the house"". I haven't visited him at his new house, so I'm not really sure what that involves. I do know the forecast high on Saturday in Oneonta is 7 degrees.      Michele and I were both able to arrange an early departure from work tomorrow, and we'll pick up Alicia on our way north. Wrestling starts at 6 - if we depart by 2 pm, we have a chance of getting there right about then if we don't have any travel delays. Anticipating some quality time with really quality people.     Jay also mentioned he had a hot tub. But 7 degrees? Momentarily feeling adventurous, I packed a suit. It will probably stay in my bag.     Probably no entries for a few days. Stay warm and comfortable.",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Thu",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646439,"Been quite a week - very busy around the house for the winter ""off season"".      Plans went awry last weekend before we even left the house - Jay called me about the time I arrived home (this was about an hour before we were shooting to leave) to inform me Kate had tested positive for Covid. Of course, a few things were set into motion and the brakes had to be applied. The excitement and anticipation we all shared disappeared almost instantly - We were bummed here in South Jersey, and they were bummed and redirected with a whole list of unanticipated (and unwanted) Covid responsibilities up in New York. We will reschedule.     I have had consistent success this week with my diet, and I believe more positive changes are probable as good habits are established - I even shed a couple pounds. I've upped the walking some, even jogged a few times during my walks. I'm hoping to increase my time spent walking as the winter wears on.     Winter is getting old already.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Fri",0
BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646458,"Just watched the very end of the San Fran - Green Bay game.  Watched San Fran finish with a difficult-to-accomplish playoff win at Lambeau that included a blocked punt for a touchdown. Kudos to them. I haven't watched much football these past few years, but the last few minutes of that game had me riveted. My brand-new son in law Trevor stopped here this afternoon after work to pick up my son, Christian. He took him to his place in North Jersey where Christian can spend some time with his sister Alicia before they drop him off at school in Scranton, Pa. tomorrow. His junior year spring semester begins Monday. It was nice having our son home with us these past five weeks.
     It's almost midnight here, and I'm well rested and a tad over caffeinated, so I'm wide awake and on the computer. Walked outside in the very cold (sub-20) this morning with Michele and Lola (dog) for about 2 miles, and then jumped on the treadmill for a short jog when we returned home. (Really trying to walk more - the hike is only 3 months away now). 
    Although I'm not big on football (this past decade and a half - I used to be a rabid fan), my sister-in-law Denise (and her longtime boyfriend Dom) invited Michele and I to a get together tomorrow to watch the remaining playoff games. Since my wife's family is 100 percent Italian, there will be some awesome grub there, and it will be plentiful. Michele is baking a pumpkin cake (mmm) to bring. I've decided to attend, but I'm gonna have to pay attention to what I allow myself to inhale, cause I'm trying to reduce my pack weight!

BOBL,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657578,"Went for a short overnighter - REALLY needed to get out. Had to test my Achilles that I injured playing softball, check and see of my legs still worked, and give my gear a run through, so I can somewhat confidently prepare for a stint in New England in the next couple weeks...
Made the 1 hour 50 minute drive from home to the Rte 501 parking area in PA on Sunday, the 4th. Arrived aorund 6:30, and was on trial by 6:45. It was still almost 90 degrees... Hiked the just over 4 miles southbound to the two story William Penn shelter, about half in the dark. It was good to be back on the AT. I saw a handful of visitors and a few locals near the trailhead, at, and around the Kimmel lookout - which is very near the road. In passing, I briefly spoke with a young woman who was from Burlington NJ about a half mile in - she, of course, was familiar with J&B Bakery and their cream filled donuts! She warned me of the lack of water, and I (luckily) was able to inform her I had anticipated water scarcity as we have had such little rain this season, and packed in my water. (Thank God!) Other than her, I saw no other hikers the rest of the evening.
The trail was a bit rocky in the early going, (and paralleled Rte 501 for good bit) but the terrain overall was forgiving for the most part. Darkness and threatening lightning (never came my way, but lit up the sky for the last forty minutes of my hike) were my biggest challenge. Passed two stealth sites - one about a mile in from 501, and another almost 2 miles later - maybe 3/4 mile from Wagonner Rd. 
Startled a deer in the darkness (and myself, a bit - luckily I spotted its eyes in my headlamp glare prior to it crashing through the woods nearby), and that was my only real wildlife encounter, aside from the occasional winged insect.
Set up shop in the shelter, as there was a threat of rain - the shelter was empty and very clean, and I abhor packing up a wet tent,,,, I ate my dinner - cheese and crackers and a PB&J. I had a cup of hot tea, brushed my chops, hung my food and crashed. Slept restless the first few hours - I heard some mice skittering about, but they left me alone. Slept well for the last five hours or so.

I woke to on and off showers. I Grabbed my food bag and made my favorite for breakfast - Mountain House Biscuits and Gravy. Yum. Packed up while drinking a cup of coffee - I was looking to get back to the car before the predicted heavy rain. Made a quick entry in the shelter log and hit the very clean privy on the way back to the trail.
Did some ruminating while walking, and experienced more traffic in the am on the way out than I did on the way in. Passed a young family of four or five who were friendly in passing and had overnight gear, an older fellow who appeared to be a distance hiker, and who warned me that the 501 shelter caretaker was gone and there was no water there, and then a younger fellow who attended St Joe's University, was a teacher In Durham, NC (WAS, but would not be a teacher in Durham  go forward - he was looking to relocate and teach somewhere else after he hiked the remaining 1200 miles of the AT...) Again, I failed to get anyone's name, but, such was my experience.
I experienced some light showers, but avoided the heavy rains. Great short overnight hike. Took a ride into Pine Grove to check it out and get a cup of coffee, then drove home in Labor Day traffic. Grateful for the time on the trail, even if it was short.",,View Entry,"Sep 05, Mon",0
