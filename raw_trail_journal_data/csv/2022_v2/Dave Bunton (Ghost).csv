Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646376,"I may or may not have committed my first crime as a thru-hiker. I know that I am not technically a thru-hiker, heck I’m not even technically a hiker, however I was checking in at a place that rhymes with Castle Rock State Park when I used their very nice bathroom. Right there in front of me was about 5 rolls of tp. I felt like I was well prepared for my 18 mile out and back overnight hike butt, see what I I did there, I just couldn’t resist the urge to procure several squares of the vaulted material. Never used it and I apologize to the great state of California for my alleged discretion.
Here are some things that I learned from my hike:
I absolutely love my Hyperlite Mountain Gear Southwest 3400 pack. It is very light, I was able to comfortably fit all of my gear into it and it felt great on my back. Thanks Skip!  I used trekking poles for the very first time and I was pleasantly surprised. I was convinced that I didn’t want to have things in my hands while hiking but these things were game changers. Loved having them on the uphills and the downhills. I do have to remember not to grip them too hard all the time. Made my left elbow sore. Thanks again Skip!! I listened to music for the first time while hiking. I normally listen to music, one earbud as recommended, when I run but I have not done the same with hiking. Enjoyed the music as well as the outside world. I learned that it is difficult to enjoy a view while hiking so it’s ok to stop for a moment and take it all in. I had a brain freeze when I first got to Waterman Gap Campground and could not remember how to hang my hammock. Thankfully I figured it out and was able to set everything up. I need to get better with the correct hang of my hammock since I spent most of the night sliding down towards my feet. I also need to get the doors to my tarp secured so I don’t think a mountain lion is sneaking up on me because the doors are rattling. I also need to work on my water management. I did not drink any water on the way to the campground because I knew there would be no water at the site. I carried two 1-liter Smart water bottles with me and my Sawyer squeeze filter. I drank water when I got to camp, used water for my Ramen Bomb, which was very good and then had a little for the evening and morning. Need to get better with that. Note to self, when screwing your stove onto the fuel canister, just be aware that it will begin to spit out propane before you fully tighten. I got up early the next morning, before daylight and did some hiking in the dark. Not as difficult as I would have thought. Hiked for about two hours, stopped at a creek, got some water, had some coffee and breakfast and continued on my trip.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Mon",0
Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646761,"So I believe that I have put the proverbial cart before the horse. My previous entry talked about my first shakedown hike. Doesn’t really make any sense if you don’t know why I am doing shakedown hikes in the first place. Starting on March 30th, 2022, I will be attempting to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. Currently, the Appalachian Trail is around 2,193 miles, goes through 14 states and usually takes hikers somewhere between 5-7 months. The success rate is right around 25% so should make for some fun and exciting times. I will be using Trail Journals to keep my family and friends in the loop as to where I am and how things are going with the hike. I am looking forward to this challenge and I hope that if you are reading this that you will come along with me, figuratively speaking of course.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Sun",0
Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648020,"I flew into Atlanta this morning, jumped onto the MARTA train and headed to North Springs Station where I met Roland from Switzerland who is starting tomorrow and Waffles, my shuttle driver. I’m not going to lie, I was surprised that Waffles was a woman. We had only communicated via text. Waffles hiked the Appalachian Trail after graduating from UCLA studying International Affairs and Arabic. She started at Katahdin heading southbound. Some would say that’s more difficult because you start with the Whites and the 100 mile wilderness. I know all of this information because I peppered her with questions for the whole 1 hour ride to Dahlonega. She said was going to come back and get me tomorrow to take me too Amicalola Falls but I’m not too sure. I checked into my room, walked over to Walmart to get food for 3 days on the trail, bought a Subway sandwich and am now getting my pack ready for tomorrow.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648114,"So first a disclaimer. Some times I won’t be able to post on the actual day that I am hiking. Sometimes I do not have cell service or a low battery on the phone. This was the case last night. Hopefully not all the post will be this long either. The day started with Waffles picking me up at 0700. We stopped for coffee and then headed to the Visitor Center. Got there early but was able to get the required arch photo. Registered, I was hiker 2169 since January 1st, picked up my tag, weighed my pack, more on that later, and listened to Chelsea as she talked about how we can minimize our impact on the trail. I walked under the arch at 8:30 and headed to a campsite that Waffles had recommended. Now, if you have ever walked with me you know that I tend to walk quickly. Right now my friends are laughing at me. One goal for me today was to slow down and try not to push too hard. I was not more than 5 minutes into the hike and this large bird flew towards me and landed by the creek. It was absolutely beautiful with a blue grey color, long curved beaked and a massive wingspan. It looked at me and then took off heading down the trail. I took this as a sign but it was probably just scared of me. The Falls were beautiful and the stairs were not as bad as others have said. Along the approach trail I stopped and talked with M-80 and his dog Wilbur. M-80 got his trail name from tossing an M-80 near a bear that was trying to steal his food bag. I had a great talk with him and I appreciated his encouragement. I made it up to Springer and the official start of the AT, had some lunch and headed to 3 Forks where I was camping the first night. On the way down Springer I ran into Fry Pan. His pack weighed in at 65 pounds! To give you some perspective, mine weighed in at 28! He was heading to the parking lot to get some different gear. I also ran into Randy, Trawler and Tinker. We interacted for a while. I made it to 3 Forks around 1400, set up camp, had dinner, hung up my food bag which was an experience all in its self, watched the Army Rangers do some exercises and then laid in my hammock. Had a hard time falling asleep after a busy day. 13.2 miles today.","Amicalola Falls Vistor Center

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648123,"I woke up this morning at 0530 and listened to the rain pounding on the tarp and assessed my slightly wet hammock and sleeping bag. Apparently the tarp, due to the wind gusts, had been pushing up against  aforementioned hammock. Not a big deal but I would have to be aware of that in the future. Listening to the rain, at times, sounded like you were in a popcorn maker and other times like a jet getting ready to take off of an aircraft carrier. At exactly 0600 the rain stopped. It was still dark but I jumped out of the hammock and using my headlamp starting breaking down camp. There were branches strewn all over the campsite so I felt fortunate that none had landed on me. I loaded up on water and started my second day. It was dark, cool and misty but perfect hiking weather. I wanted to hike for a while and then stop to have breakfast. Walking through the woods was right out of an Edgar Allen Poe novel. My legs felt a little tired but no soreness. A lot of ups and downs and eventually the sun came out and you could see the clouds hugging the mountains, very cool. Came across a can of Miller Lite and had an internal question of drink or not drink. Decided to not drink. I know, crazy huh! Had a long uphill and I was struggling. Stopped at the top with a beautiful view and had breakfast. Felt like a different person afterwards. Made it to Gooch Mountain Shelter just after 1200. Decided to set up camp to let things dry. Big push tomorrow to Neels Gap.","3 Forks

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648165,"Up at 0530 and on the trail by 0600. The Shelter was packed and I was the only one up so I had to be super quiet. I used the red light on my headlamp, which apparently is the proper thing to do when at shelters. I remembered to grab my food bag out of the bear box and turned onto the trail. I looked down the trail and this huge bear was running right at me. She got about 10 feet from me, snarling she raised up on her two hind legs and yelled “April Fools!” And then ran into the woods. Sorry, I couldn’t resist. Today was a beautiful day for views. I woke and saw the stars for the first time since being on trail. I love looking at the stars. Getting up early has it’s advantages also since there was an amazing sunrise. Beautiful orange colors that contrasted with the darkness of the mountains. There is only one thing that I don’t like about sunrises…they make the stars disappear. Great views from both Ramrock mountain and Big Cedar Ledges which is were I stopped for breakfast. I was all by myself and the view was outstanding. I climbed up to Blood Mountain and the views there were  just as amazing. The 2.4 mile downhill hike into Neels Gap was nice with more great views and a lot of bouldering. Neels Gap is where Mountain Crossing is located. A place well know for pizza, resupply and a tree that is full of the shoes worn by people who quit at Neels Gap. I ate a whole pizza, bought some food and water and a Powerade. So good. I might have re-thought the pizza if I had known about the climb out of Neels Gap. It was a butt kicker. I hiked another 2.2 miles to a campsite recommended by Waffles, who also happens to work at Mountain Crossing. Got to the camp and happy to be there after 17.8 miles. Big day.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648193,"Up at 0515 and on trail by 0600. The wind was howling last night. I had to get up 3 different times to adjust my tarp since it was flapping in the wind. Also woke up and listened to something screeching at around 2300. Maybe an owl but I’m not an expert. I shared the campsite with 6 other hikers. All a lot younger than me. Jack, who graduated from UMaine two years ago, where my youngest goes to school. Jeff, who I met at Gooch Mountain Shelter. He lent me his charging cable and I gave him some food. Pickles and Ben who are both from Maine, Mike, who is from the LA area. Mike does 30 push-ups every time he takes off his pack. I no-repped all of them. There was another young gentleman but I never got his name. My morning routine now is get up, breakdown camp and get moving on trail. I give myself 3 hours to find a place to stop and have breakfast which consists of coffee mixed with chocolate flavored Instant Breakfast and a bar of some kind. The mornings are usually my low time. It’s dark, everything is a little sore and I don’t listen to any music. I look forward to my breakfast and always feel better afterwards. I got to the top of Green Cliff Top and the view was amazing. I was going to stop there but the wind was blowing and I didn’t want to get cold. The toughest part of the day was climbing out of Tesnatee Gap. I walked for a little bit with Purple Haze and Cricket and then got to camp at 1200. Setup camp and got my food bag line hung. Supposed to get a beautiful sunset here tonight. Can’t wait!","Swaim Gap

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648277,"Shared the campsite with Walt, his wife and and a hiker called Tortoise. Walt is his trail name because he is a big fan of Disney. Tortoise is a 66 year old man who takes his time on the trail. I talked with them a little bit about water since the closest source was .3 miles down trail. Doesn’t seem like a big deal but miles are miles. We decided to get water and talked the whole time. Tortoise told us how he has colon cancer and has had an operation to remove part of his colon. He just wanted to be on the trail. I carried his water back. I figured it was the least I could do. The wind was howling again last night. I woke up just before midnight and listened to it roaring up the the mountain. Sounds like a freight train coming at you. I fell back to sleep and woke up at 0615. I must have missed my alarm. Jumped out of the hammock and broke down camp. I hiked past Blue Mountain Shelter and counted 18 tents. Glad I stopped earlier. Got to the top of Rocky Mountain, elevation 3992 feet, and the views were amazing. I decided to stop and have breakfast even though the wind was still howling. Ate quickly and headed down. The next big climb was Tray Mountain, elevation 4398 feet, and again great views. I got to Addis Gap early and found a group of hikers having lunch. I said hi and headed up a small hill. I got to the top and checked where I was on the trail. Turns out that where the hikers were was where I was staying tonight. I walked back down and dropped my pack. The hikers told me that the water source was .5 miles down a side trail. I ate some lunch with Someday, a woman who had shown up after me, and headed down to the water source. There was a beautiful campsite right next to the creek so I hiked back up the hill, grabbed my pack, which I had left with Someday, and headed back down. I set up camp, soaked my feet in the cold creek several times, had dinner and climbed into my hammock. Another great day! 14.6 miles.","Tentsite mile 49.1

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648354,"I woke up this morning freezing! I was so cold I was starting to shiver. I couldn’t figure why I was so cold until I got out of my hammock. My under quilt, which attaches to the bottom of my hammock, and keeps my body-heat in the hammock had shifted off of my hammock. I fixed it and climbed back in to warm up. I laid there for about 5 minutes and my alarm went off. Other than being cold, it had been a great night of sleeping. Yesterday the hikers I talked to were discussing the difficulty of the climb up Kelly Knob so I was anticipating a tough morning. I picked up my gear and headed .5 miles back to the AT. Kelly Knob was tough, 800 feet of elevation gain in 1 mile. However the view at the top was outstanding. I got there just before sunrise and decided to have breakfast. The temperature was around 34 degrees and the wind was blowing across the mountain. I was trying to heat up my water, take pictures of the sunrise and keep my fingers from freezing. I was so cold that when I sat down I knocked over my stove! I had just enough water left to make some coffee and start down the mountain to warm up. Short hike down to Dicks Creek Gap and then a .6 mile walk to Hostel Around the Bend. I had planned on walking in and seeing what they had available but my buddy Rick texted me and told me he had booked me a room. Thanks Rick! 5.5 miles total for the day and a chance to take a nice hot shower, resupply and let my body rest. Hostel Around the Bend is outstanding. Lisa and Gordon run the place and they do a great job. If you are ever in the area look them up. A shuttle take hikers into Hiawassee and the Ingles store to resupply. I went to the salad bar and made myself an enormous salad. So good. Back to the hostel to rest up and get ready for a big day tomorrow.","Addis Gap

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648363,"A great night of sleep. Thanks again Rick! I was up at 0500 and back on trail just before 0600. Today the weather forecast was for rain to start some time after noon. My plan was to see how far I could get and then try to get to one of the shelters before the rain got too heavy. As is usually the case on the AT, I started with a climb. My body was feeling good after almost a full day of rest so I was making good time. I hit another climb at As Knob climbing up to 3427 feet. Still no rain but the surrounding mountains were covered in mist. At mile 78.1 on the AT I crossed over the Georgia/North Carolina border. I took a picture of the sign and then moved along. I was still trying to beat the rain. I made it to Bly Gap which has an iconic tree that sits in the middle of the AT. Another picture and off I went again. The climb out of Bly Gap and up to Top Mountain was brutal. A big climb and then a short section of flat and then another big climb. I started a decent to Sassafras Gap and had breakfast. I got to Muskrat Creek Shelter at 1030 and decided to push on to Standing Indian Shelter which was another 4.8 miles. At 1030 it started to rain. I had switched to my light sun hoodie and placed my rain jacket on top of my pack. When the rain started I put my rain jacket on and started on another decent. As I got halfway down the mountain there was a flash of lightning and a loud crackle of thunder. I was glad I wasn’t at the top of the mountain. The rain was steady but nothing too hard. I got to Standing Indian Shelter just after 1200 and there were already 8 hikers there. As the rain increased hikers continued to arrive. Some in more stages of wetness than others. At one time we had 19 hikers in a shelter for 8. Discussion on where everyone was going to sleep abounded. Some talked about pushing on while others braved the rain and set there tents up outside. Around 1700 the rain stopped and hikers began to set up tents. I set up my hammock and climbed in to relax. 16.6 miles today and the body felt good. Some more big climbs tomorrow. So far North Carolina has not been very friendly.","Hostel Around the Bend

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648384,"So apparently I need to do a better job of selecting the site to hang my hammock. Last night when the sun went down the wind picked up, which is the norm since I have been on trail. My hammock was center stage for the wind. Tarp vibrating and shaking so hard it was making the hammock move. I readjusted some lines but to no avail. By 2300 I was still awake listening to the tarp and the wind. So I said fudge it! Except I didn’t say fudge. I packed up my stuff and got back on the trail at 2335 Now, probably not the best decision I have ever made but it was better than laying in the hammock. I figured I could hike through the night and get to Rock Gap to take the bus into Franklin. I got to the top of Standing Indian Mountain and as soon as I started down the other side the wind died down and the temperature went up. It was a gradual descent with some flat trail down the mountain which was disconcerting because I knew that Albert Mountain, elevation 5213, feet was looming. I stopped at a creek to drink some water. I was tripping over roots a lot more and I stubbed my big toe several times. I hate when that happens. When I got to Carter Gap Shelter my headlamp died. I grabbed my phone and used that light to get my battery pack out and started charging the headlamp while hiking with my phone light. I got to Betty Gap and started up. Switched back to the headlamp. Not too bad until about a mile from the summit and then straight up and boulders. I made it to the top of Albert Mountain where there is a fire tower. I climbed up but the top is locked. I had a view of the town lights since it was still dark. The stars finally came out and were spectacular. Mostly descents and some flat terrain after Albert. I finally got to Rock Gap around 0745. I’ve been up now for about 28 hours and logged 36.6 miles. I’m going to take the bus into town, get some breakfast, get a hotel, take a nice, long, hot shower and give my feet and knees a little tlc. Back on the trail bright and early tomorrow morning.","Standing Indian Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648456,"This is going to be a long post so you might want to get some food and maybe a drink. I got a ride into town from a gentleman who shuttles hikers. He had thru-hiked in 2007. He gave me the tour of the town and dropped me off at Kountry Kitchen. The coffee and breakfast were outstanding. I walked over to the Hilltop Inn and asked for a room. They only had rooms with two beds so I got one. I went to my room and took a nice long hot shower. Afterwards, I did some laundry, put some stuff outside to dry off and cleaned some cooking items. Reality Check, a hiker whom I met 2 days ago at Hostel Around the Bend and ran into at Standing Indian Shelter showed up and asked if I spare room. Looks like I have a roommate. I walked over to Outdoor 76, a hiker supply store, and took a  look around the place. I then walked over to The Lazy Hiker Brewery. After 1 beer I was ready to fall asleep so I had 2 more! I then walked over to Ingles, the local grocery store, to resupply. Word of advice, don’t buy things after you have had 3 beers and are sleep deprived. I walked back to the hotel, nuked 4 pizza breads and watch the original version of Ocean Eleven with Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr.. Good flick. Reality Check had left earlier to get some food and I never heard her come back. I was up at 0700 and at 0830 a van picked us up to take us to the Baptist church for free breakfast. Eggs, pancakes, bacon etc.. They treated us well and it was much appreciated. We got a van ride back and by 1030 I was back on trail. Thanks to Bobby the Greek for the ride out. I was really looking forward to this section of the trail due to Siler and Wayah Balds. Both very popular places due to their 360 degree views. I got to Winding Stair Gap and then it was pretty much up the rest of the day. The trail is going to have some great views but you’re going to have to pay. I got to Siler Bald, 5207 feet, and it was spectacular. I had lunch and headed for Wayah Bald. A gentle decline for a while because you are going to have to pay for the second view. I finally made it to Wayah Bald, 5337 feet, and it has a stone observation tower where the views were just as amazing. While I was there, i checked my phone and realized that I had walked past the campsite I wanted to stay at tonight. I must have been really excited to see Wayah Bald. I walked down to another site about 2 miles. Got some water, set up camp and cooked dinner. I’m getting better at my bear hang. Now in my hammock writing this entry and getting ready to go to sleep. 16 miles today.","Rock Gap-Franklin

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648481,"Today was definitely a roller coaster ride both mentally and physically. I woke up this morning after a great night of sleep at 0545 and could feel the cold. I looked at my phone to check the weather and saw that it was 31 degrees with a chance of rain and snow. I didn’t want to get out of my cozy and warm hammock but by 0630 it was time to get moving. This has been my favorite campsite so far especially with a beautiful sunrise. I packed up and got on trail. Weather was not looking good so I was anxious about getting to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, about 15 miles, to see if they had a room. I was thinking that I would take tomorrow off because the weather did not look good and the temperature was going to be in the 20’s. The hike started with a little uphill and the views were spectacular. About 2 hours into the hike I got to the top of Copper Ridge Lookout. Sunny with a beautiful view, it was the perfect place to have breakfast. With breakfast over, the trail took me on a descent and I was still thinking about where I was staying tonight. I got to the bottom of Tellico Gap at 3859 feet and then climbed to Wesser Bald at 4618 in 1.4 miles. Oh and it began to snow. Made me laugh out loud. Wesser Bald was awesome with the snow and the clouds hugging the mountains. Then the big decline into the NOC. As I was hiking down, I called my buddy Rick and asked him to check for openings at the NOC. There were none. Obviously everyone was getting off trail. I figured I would get there and see if anyone had room for me. Not more than 100 yards after I hung up with Rick, I ran into a hiker named Rick who had booked a room with 4 bunk beds and was looking for 3 other people. They say the trail provides and in this case it certainly did for me. The decline to the NOC is a knee crusher. Very steep with wet boulders and places where a slip would end the hike. I finally made it to the NOC, went to the restaurant and had 2 beers and a protein pizza with bacon, ham, pepperoni and ham. Checked into the room and took off my shoes. The blisters are trying to take over my feet. I have one on the ball of my right foot, two on the heel of my right foot, one on the ball of my left foot and one the size of Rhode Island on the heal of my left foot.

We have had snow showers, on and off, most of the day. Tonight the temperature is supposed to be in the high 20’s so looks like we picked a good day for a zero. The rest of the day consisted of exploring the outfitter’s store, getting my Smokey Mountains permit, taking another shower, getting some food for resupply, taking care of my blisters, texting and making some phone calls, laying in my bunk reading a book and getting some dinner.

I was up at 0530 and tried to be quiet but it just didn’t happen. By the time I left, all 3 of my roommates were awake. Sorry guys but I enjoyed our time together. I walked down to the kitchen and drank a liter of water, got my snickers bar out and headed onto the trail. I was excited to get back on trail especially with the forecast of a beautiful day. It was 32 degrees when I got on trail but the high for today was going to be around 68. I anticipated a lot of climbs today with The Jump Up at 3773 feet, Cheoah Bald at 5052 feet and then a view at 3719 feet. I did not time my sunrise well so I was down in a gap when the sun came up but the sky was clear and views were amazing. I climbed up to The Jump Up and had the whole place to myself. I stopped, had my breakfast and then headed down to get prepared for the climb to Cheoah Bald. I started to walk in snow from yesterday and at times wasn’t even sure if I was still on the trail. Fortunately I had passed a hiker going the other way so I was able to follow his footprints. I stopped on the trail, made a snowball and threw it at a tree. Missed, almost threw my arm out but I giggled like a young kid. They say that the trail will change you in some ways and that you will have moments. Today was one for me. I got up to the top of Cheoah Bald and it was absolutely breathtaking. I had been listening to a song by Mazzy Star, kind of deep, it was warm with no wind and I started thinking about my Mom. I started to cry and when I say cry I mean sobbing. At first I tried to stop but I figured I was on top of a mountain with no one around so I just let it go. Even writing this right now makes me a little teary eyed. Don’t know why but that’s what happened. Once I got myself composed, I headed down the most difficult section of the trail so far. Imagine that you are at your local park and you are going down the slide. Not one of those plastic ones but the metal kind. Now imagine that the slide is covered in ice and you have to get down the slide standing up with trekking poles. Oh, and you’re wearing roller skates. It was terrifying. So in a matter of a few minutes I went from sobbing to being terrified. Awesome day! Made it safely down. The rest of the day was some downs and some serious ups.

The plan for the day was to get to Fontana Marina, resupply and then go just a little further to get to Fontana Dam Shelter. I wanted to do a shorter hike to line up some miles through the Great Smokey Mountains. I climbed up to the ridge line and then followed that parallel to Fontana Lake. It was a beautiful day and occasionally I would get views of the water and the Dam. I stopped at Walker Gap to have breakfast. Blue, a chef from Knoxville as well as French Fry and her dog Rosie past by as I drank my coffee and ate a Cliff Bar. I headed down from Walker Gap and caught up with Blue. I knew it was going to be a short day so I just hiked behind Blue and asked him a bunch of questions. The hour down the mountain went quickly and was the longest I had hiked with anyone on the trail. Blue was going into Fontana Village so we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways. I went down to the marina, did my resupply and enjoyed a breakfast beer and a free popsicle. All thru-hikers get one. I headed over to Fontana Dam Shelter, did not see a good spot for a hammock so I decided to push onward. The trail goes over the Dam and then I hiked uphill for a while along a paved road. A hard left turn and you get to the permit box for the Smokey’s. I met Tennessee Pickle and now up. The Marina is at 1706 feet and I was heading to a fire tower on Shuckstack Mountain at 3993 feet.

I decided it was time to get up. My tarp is the first thing I put up and also the last thing I take down so that if raining I have something to keep me dry. The rain stopped just as I was ready to take it down so I took it down quickly and headed on trail around 0610. When you are hiking in the Smokey’s you are required to stay at the shelters. If they are full, then you have to tent or hammock near the shelters. This means you have to plan your hikes and the mileage. I was looking to get to Derrick Knob Shelter which would put me at 17.3 for the day. As soon as I got on trail it began to rain and it continued to rain on and off all day. The trail, due to the rain was either a river, a lake or a mud pit. My feet were wet by the first mile and stayed that way all day. If you walked in the middle of the trail you walked in water and if you tried to walk on the side you slipped back to the middle. The climbs were brutal and the descents were steep and treacherous. I can’t even begin to count how many times I slipped and started windmilling my arms. I was fortunate and never went down but I was close numerous times. I stopped at Thunderhead Mountain at 5520 feet to have breakfast. Not a big view but awesome nonetheless. When I got to the shelter it was packed. I continued on and accidentally walked down the trail to the water. I climbed back up and followed another trail to the water. I came back and followed the trail to the bear hangs. Finally I walked over and asked someone where was the trail. Obviously I was a little tired but I was starting to get mad so we all know what happens when I get mad. I went to the next shelter. I got to Siler’s Bald Shelter around 1500 physically and mentally drained. It was too windy to set up my hammock so it looked like I was in the shelter tonight. I took off all my wet clothes, got into some dry clothes, made dinner and crawled into my sleeping bag.","Birch Spring Tentsite

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648790,"My alarm woke me and probably everyone around me in the shelter at 0530. I did not have a lot to pack since my sleeping bag was all I needed last night. Clingmans Dome was only 4.5 miles away so if the weather cooperated I might get some stellar views. I grabbed a Snickers bar and headed on trail. First a climb, which always seems the case, and my legs were not happy at all. They were still feeling the miles from yesterday. I slowed down the pace and got to Clingman’s Dome around 0730. The wind was howling and it was blowing the clouds up and over the mountains. It was a very cool scene. I met a day hiker at the road to get to the Dome and he pointed me in the right direction. I got to the top, took some pictures and headed back down. The view was awesome. I hiked for a while and checked my trail app. I was .5 miles off the trail. Maybe my mind was a little tired from yesterday too. I climbed back up, scared a family of 3 when I popped out of the woods and finally got back on trail. Clingmans Dome is the highest point on the trail at 6612 feet. I guess that means it’s all downhill from there. Definitely not the case. There were some small ups and a lot of downs. At on of the ups I stopped for breakfast. I only had one coffee packet so I grabbed a grape Propel packet and added that to the coffee. Grape coffee! The first couple of sips were good. Afterwards not so much. However it seemed to do the trick. My legs felt a lot better. The trail had dried out but still some spots with mud. When I got to Indian Grave Gap there were 4 ladies giving out food and drinks. Not counting the two beers that I passed up on trail, the guy offering me an ice cream sandwich out the window of his camper(My parents use to warn me about people like that!) and my buddy Rick getting me a room at Hostel Around the Bend, this was the first time I had it actually on the trail. I had an orange, two strawberry pop tarts and chugged a water. I probably could have eaten more but I felt badly since I was the only one there. I headed out and caught up to a hiker named Josiah. I asked him what his plan was for tonight and tomorrow. I had gotten a text from my buddy Skip who said the weather could get bad. Most of my stuff was wet so I wasn’t too excited about more bad weather. We got to Newfound Gap and we were checking our phones when a white van pulled up to us. The driver got out and asked if we needed a ride into Gatlinburg. I asked him how much and he said free. I guess I’m going into Gatlinburg! Got into Gatlinburg, found the Motel 6, took a long hot shower, dried out my stuff, went to the all you can eat pizza buffet and went to get a resupply. Rain tomorrow in the morning but I’m getting back on trail. 207.7 miles on trail.","Siler’s Bald Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648899,"I slept through my 0630 alarm and woke up at 0725. I had originally planned on going to a breakfast place to get some coffee and a big breakfast. Not going to happen now. So I got up, packed up my gear and went down to the lobby to grab a little styrofoam cup of coffee. I had taken out a Almond Snickers bar so that looked like breakfast for the day. When I got to the pickup place for the shuttle there were already 4 other hikers waiting. Two vans showed up, one for the gear and one for us. We got back up to Newfound Gap and the van with our gear was also carrying trail magic. So I was able to grab a banana, a honey bun, some Oreo cookies and peanut butter crackers. Breakfast of Champions. I visited the restroom and headed on my way, just a little after 0900. The trail started on a long uphill. There were going to be a lot of views today and in hiker talk that meant elevation gain. The weather was not cooperating due to the clouds hugging the mountains but the climbing was still there. The Smokey Mountains have an incredible terrain. The trees are so dense and everything is covered in moss. It reminded me of the Enchanted Forest. I almost expected the dwarfs to come whistling down the trail. I got to Charlies Bunion, one of the favorites for both day and thru hikers. Unfortunately the clouds were hogging the view but I did meet Rachel and John who were waiting to see if the view would improve. I hope they got there view. My original plan was to get to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter and see if there was a place to hang my hammock. I got there around 1400 and it was a little busy so I decided to push onward. Best decision I made today! The sun came out and the clouds gave way to some stellar views. I came around the side of a mountain at mile 225.8 and the view was next level. You could see the mountains across the valley and then the flat land beyond. It was awesome. I stopped a couple of times to soak in the sun and to enjoy the views. Also I dropped almost 1100 feet to get to Cosby Knob Shelter around 1745. I put up my hammock next to a nice running stream, made my dinner and hung my food bag. Another good mileage day and out of the Smokey’s tomorrow!","Gatlinburg, Tennessee - Newfound Gap

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648904,"Today was an absolutely beautiful day! I woke up late again, my body telling me it needed some more rest, packed up camp and made it out on the trail around 0715. The sun was just coming up and the temperature was rising. I started the morning with a little climb but the day was going to consist of a long descent followed by a grueling climb. I made it to the Mt. Cammerer Trail which was .6 miles off the AT but led to a fire tower and great views. I had to go check it out. The views there were amazing and the trip was well worth the extra mileage. Down I went from 4885 feet to 1454 feet. I got to the box that officially marked the end of the Smokey’s and ran into Minute Man. He and I had met on trail 2 days ago. We discussed campsites for the night and moved onward. This part of the trail was very soothing. There was a large flowing creek that the trail crossed over several times. The trail took me to Interstate 40 where there was trail magic! Pac Man, who had thru-hiked last year, had an enormous spread of food and resupplies. I had and not necessarily in this order, 3 sausages, a muffin, a bag of Fritos, 4 Gatorades and 2 strawberries. I also grabbed some resupply stuff. It was awesome. I said my thanks and went on my way. I had to do some road hiking and actually walked under Interstate 40. I h climbed a little and then came back to the creek. I decided to soak my feet. I’m glad I did because now I was going from 1836 feet to Snowbird Peak at 4527 feet. At the top was an FAA building and another great view. I then descended down to Groundhog Creek Shelter. I set up camp, cooked some dinner and crawled into the hammock. Minute Man wants to get to Hot Springs tomorrow which is 26.3 miles away. I am contemplating but I may do a shorter day then do a nero into Hot Springs on Sunday. We’ll see how the body feels tomorrow especially with Max Patch in the future.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648989,"Today was an awesome day! I woke up around 0430 and listened to the rain on my tarp. Fell back asleep and got out of my hammock at 0535. Still raining but it was time to go. I got back on trail around 0615 and immediately started climbing. Max Patch, at 4615 feet, was in the future so I was going to be climbing for a while. The rain stopped sometime after 0700. 3 brutal climbs followed by 3 descents put me at a dirt road at the bottom of Max Patch. There was a creek so I got just enough water for breakfast maybe on the other side of Max Patch out of the wind. The final climb was not too bad but the stairs at the top were legit. The view was unbelievable and the wind was not blowing too hard. I stopped for a while, took a bunch of pictures and headed down the other side where I ran into Judy and Steve. Judy was from North Carolina and Steve was from Kentucky. We had a great conversation and they were headed to a brewery later to listen to a band from Kentucky. They told me they were going to have one for me. I hope they did! I stopped to have my coffee and instant breakfast and headed down. This part of the trail was smooth and soft. My legs felt great. I got to Walnut Mountain Shelter, 13.1 miles, at 1130 so I decided I would push for Hot Springs and take a zero tomorrow. I had one more big climb up Bluff Mountain and then down into Hot Springs. I checked into my hotel, thanks again Rick, that is right next to the trail and went just down the trail to get a pizza and a beer. 26.3 miles for the day. My first hiking marathon and I’m glad I have the day off tomorrow.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649016,"I was up at 0700. I tried to sleep longer but it just didn’t happen with me. I walked across the street and got a coffee and a blueberry danish. Back at the motel, I made a list of supplies that I needed and headed over to the Dollar General. They were a little limited so I went to the store next door and they had a better selection. I went back to the motel and met Kevin. Kevin had met a buddy of his, who was hiking the AT, and was just getting ready to head out. Kevin is from Alabama so we had a discussion about SEC football and then he gave me a beer before he headed out. I got my food organized and then walked over to the Iron Horse Station for lunch. Last night while at the Tavern for dinner, I met Ben and Reahnen. We talked about the trail and the views from Max Patch. Reahnen works at the Iron Horse Station and suggested it for lunch. I had a great burger and headed back to the motel for another shower and more relaxing. I went back to the Tavern for dinner, a pizza and 2 beers, and then back to the motel to get things ready for tomorrow. Not sure where I am heading to tomorrow but the forecast is for rain and cold temperatures. Should be exciting!","Hot Springs, North Carolina

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649059,"So I was tossing and turning all night. Woke up at 2335, then 0135, then my favorite at 0345 when the train went by with a toot toot of its horn and then again at 0450. I just laid in bed after that and listened to the rain. I got up at 0530, packed up and was back out on trail/street at 0600. The rain was steady but not too bad. The temperature was 56 degrees so that helped. The trail goes right through the middle of Hot Springs so I walked on the street for a while, crossed over the French Broad  river and then made a hard right turn back onto the dirt. The river was flowing hard and it was loud. At times you could see the white water as the river flowed over rocks. The trail followed the river for about half a mile and then went up. The elevation change went from 1307 feet to 1908 feet in just over a mile. It was still dark but I could see the lights of Hot Springs, the white water from the river and the outline of the mountain I had come down off of two days ago. The trail was a steady climb for most of the day with some small descents. I came to a dam with a pond. It was a very cool area and there were benches. If the weather had been nicer I might have stopped and had breakfast. At Tanyard Gap, I passed a camper that looked a lot like the one where the guy was offering me an ice cream sandwich back in Georgia. I got about 20 yards away when the same guy leaned out the window and told me the rain should stop around 1300. I thanked him for the information and then he said the magic words…..”Would you like a cup of coffee?” I turned around and climbed into the camper. He had a place for me to sit and a little heater going next to me. For the next half hour I drank coffee and we talked about religion, politics and the trail. He was an Army veteran and had been in Special Ops for 30 years. I could have stayed longer but I had to get back on trail. I thanked him for the coffee and went back out in the rain. Another climb got me up to 3544 feet and I decided to have some food. My hands were so cold I couldn’t open my tuna packet. I had to use my teeth. I was also struggling with the use of my spoon. I managed to get some food in me and continued on my way. The rain stopped and I was able to dry off a little while I walked. I got to Little Laurel Shelter and set up my hammock just as it started to rain again. I went and got water, put some dry clothes on and climbed into my sleeping bag to warm up. Going to cook dinner and relax. Going to be cold tonight with a possible low of 29 degrees!","Hot Springs, North Carolina

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649190,"Today was a challenging day. When I went to sleep last night I had on a pair of wool socks, tights and a pair of shorts, a long sleeve merino wool shirt, a wool hat and gloves. I was warm all night but I didn’t sleep well because I was worried about having to put on wet clothes in the morning and I seem to have developed a sore throat, cough and runny nose. Anyway, I woke up around 0500 to use the little boys room and it was very cold outside especially with the wind blowing. I jumped back into the hammock to warm up and prepare myself for getting up. At 0530 I grabbed a short sleeve wicking shirt and put that on instead of the wool shirt. I didn’t want to get that shirt sweaty. I tried to put my FROZEN fleece hoodie on but the sleeves had frozen closed. I managed to get my arms through and then went to put on my pants. They too were frozen and I had to force my feet through the pant legs. By this time I was pretty cold so I climbed back into my hammock. I fell back asleep and woke up around 0700. Shoes next. They were also frozen and it took me 5 minutes to get on my right shoe. The shoes were so cold that my feet felt like they were on fire. Speaking of fire, they had a fire going at the shelter so I walked over to try to warm up. Everyone at the fire was in some state of coldness. After a few minutes I decided it was time to breakdown camp. I finally got on trail around 0900. The climb out of the shelter was brutal. My legs were still a little chilly and they wanted nothing to do with climbing. I got to the top of the climb and I came to a blue blaze. These are views or waterfalls that are side trails and not part of the AT. I decided to take a look, I know, crazy right! Not a spectacular view but the sun came out and I found a good spot to have breakfast. With the sun out, my body started to warm up but my legs were still under protest. I reached the 300 mile mark, had great views along a ridge line and finally started a long descent down to Flint Mountain Shelter…except that the last .8 miles were straight uphill. Set up camp, soaked in the sun, had lunch and then dinner and now heading to bed. 29 degrees again tonight but I have dry clothes and no rain.","Little Laurel Shelter

The temperature was nice and no rain. I knew that there was going to be a big climb today since the shelter was at 3571 feet and I had to get up over Big Bald which stood at 5504 feet. Of course, as is usually the case with the trail, I descended down to a road at 2955 feet. Then began a long and grueling climb interspersed with an occasional decline. My body felt much better today and the weather was perfect. Sunny and a cool temperature. About two-thirds of the way up to Big Bald was trail magic. A cooler by the side of the trail that contained small cans of Coke, Oreo cookies, small apples and hard boiled eggs. I drank the first Coke that I have probably had in 20 years and it was amazing. I ate the Oreo cookies and stashed the apple for when I got to the top of Big Bald. More climbing and then the best view of the day! Total 360 degree view. Never gets old! After Big Bald there was a small decline followed by another incline up to Little Bald. Then a decline down to Whistling Gap where there is a campsite for several tents and hammocks. I set up camp, had dinner and climbed into my hammock. 13.4 miles to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel tomorrow where I plan to stay the night and get a resupply.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649363,"I was up at 0525 and on the trail by 0600. Not a great night of sleep due to the wind but good enough. A big climb right off the bat up to High Rocks. It was still dark so limited views but it was starting to get lighter earlier which is nice. I made it down to Spivey Gap where I ran into Pappa Bear who had camped at that location. We had run into each other several times. Sounded like he was shooting for Uncle Johnny’s too. I made it to No Business Knob Shelter and saw a deer just hanging out and grazing. Definitely not afraid of me. The rest of the hike was a gentle downhill into Erwin. I made it to Uncle Johnny’s, around 1130, checked in and went to hang my hammock. They have a hammock pavilion in the back which was perfect. After setting up my hammock, I did some laundry, took a shower and met NashVegas and Crow sitting around the fire. I weighed myself, 168.8, yikes, grabbed one of the loaner bikes and headed down to the local Mexican restaurant for lunch. Afterwards, NashVegas and I walked across the street to soak our feet in the Nolichucky River. NashVegas had spent 23 years in the Air Force so we talked about that and family. We headed back to the hostel where I ran into Not Him and Question Mark. They were section hiking from Hot Springs to Erwin. We had met before at Big Bald and then at Whistling Gap. We had talked about grabbing dinner since Not Him’s car was parked at the hostel. They got settled in and then the 3 of us, plus Crow, headed out to The Taproom. We had a couple beers and popcorn at The Taproom and then moved on to another local Mexican restaurant and had a great dinner. Not Him and Question Mark picked up the tab at both locations and it was much appreciated. We had a great time and a lot of laughs.

I headed over to the lounge area and made some coffee and then talked with some of the other hikers as they mingled around getting ready to head back out on trail. I said a final goodbye to Not Him and Question Mark as they climbed into their car and headed home. I had decided to take a zero today but watching the other hikers getting ready made me feel a little anxious. We said our goodbyes and then they headed back out. I took the 9:00 shuttle into Erwin and had breakfast at Bojangles. I had never been to a Bojangles so I just ordered the same as Minute Man before me. I ate my breakfast and went over to Food City to get a resupply. I also bought some potato salad as well as a Chef salad to eat during the day. I needed to get some weight back on my body. The shuttle picked us up at 1040 and took us back to the hostel. The rest of the day consisted of me soaking my feet in the river, twice, organizing my food bag and talking to some of the hikers who showed up during the day.

Minute Man was up charging his phone so we said our goodbyes and I headed out. I crossed over the Holichucky River and then entered back into the forest and followed along the river. After about 30 minutes of walking the trail started to head upward. The area was very cool. The trail crossed over a small creek at least six times and each time you walked over a little bridge. Kind of neat. The trail continued to climb and after 2.5 hours of hiking I stopped for breakfast.  I continued on the trail and at one point it brought me out where there were power lines going up and down the mountain. The view was nice especially with the great weather. Sunny and 75 degrees! After the power lines, there was more climbing which brought me up to Beauty Spot which was a bald at 4436 feet. 360 degree view and a couple had tented up on top of the bald.  They must have had a great sunrise! The trail stayed up at that elevation for a little while with just little ups and downs. I made it to Cherry Gap Shelter around 1300 which gave me 17.2 miles for the day. There was a campsite on top of Iron Mountain which was 6.5 miles further so I had a quick lunch and decided to push onward. I got to Iron Mountain around 1530 and set up camp. I put my tarp up but kept it in the sleeve. It’s supposed to be a beautiful night so I don’t think I will need it. I cooked dinner, hung my food bag and climbed into my hammock to write the journal entry. While I was doing that, Minute Man showed up and he is setting up his tent for the night.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649653,"This was an awesome but most definitely a challenging day. I was out on the trail at 0600 with Minute Man still sound asleep in his tent. The trail actually went down for a little bit but that was not good because there were going to be a lot of big climbs today. I passed through Greasy Creek Gap and then started a little climb up to Clyde Smith Shelter. The climb continued up to Little Rock Knob at 4823 feet. Nice view but nothing compared to what was coming up in a little while. I started another descent and ran into NashVegas and Pappa Bear at Roan High Knob Shelter. We talked for a little bit and then I headed onward. A little further I ran into Night Owl and we chatted for awhile. There were a lot of day hikers out due to the great weather and I stopped to talk to several of them too. On the way down to Carver Gap there was a sign that said there would be trail magic at the parking lot. I picked up my pace. When I got there, I ate two blueberry bagels with cream cheese, a plate of scrambled eggs with cheese, an apple and some oat bars. I also had a beer. All much appreciated. There were 3 Balds in my future so I needed the fuel. I also packed out a beer…they offered and I didn’t want to be rude. The first two Balds were not that bad but the last was challenging to say the least. It just kept going up. Needless to say the views were spectacular and well worth the effort. Grassy Ridge Bald won the highest elevation of the day reward at 6164 feet. The climbing was not done for the day with several more mountains to climb. I finally got to Doll Flats, my stop for the night, and chugged the warm beer that I had carried up many mountains. So good! NashVegas, Pappa Bear, Ben and Jerry, Wrangler and Chaos all showed up and set up their sites. NashVegas started a fire and we discussed plans for tomorrow. My plan was to get up early and get to Station 19E, 3.5 miles away, to get breakfast and then try to get a few miles in on the trail. They have a short window, 0800-0830.

Get a small resupply and then head back out on trail for a little while until I found a spot to set up camp. Well…..I was up at 0520 and on the trail just before 0600. A little bit of a climb and then down the mountain to highway 19E. I had .5 miles of road hiking and made it to Station 19E around 0715. There were two hikers, one that I had met on trail before, sitting in the common room and drinking coffee. I grabbed myself a cup and sat down. Crow and Tom, hikers I had met at Uncle Johnny’s, came in and we talked about our plans for the day. 0800 came around and I was the first person to be served. Scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, potatoes that had a great seasoning on them as well as a pancake the size of the plate were served and I devoured everything quickly. Breakfast is only from 0800-0830 so I went back for seconds and enjoyed that plate too. They ran out of food so I grabbed an apple and went and checked the resupply. I grabbed some stuff, organized my food bag and packed up my pack. Karen, the same woman who served breakfast, gave me a ride back to the trail and I started up again at 0930. The trail had several climbs early that warmed me back up. Along the way I passed the 400 mile mark and took a picture by the blaze.  I got to Jones Falls and took the blue blaze to check it out. Very cool and well worth the detour. On my way out I met Crow and Tom and gave them the scoop on the falls. They headed in to check it out. I got to Mountaineer Falls and it was not as exciting as Jones Falls. I still had not seen a place that looked good so I continued onward. Hardcore Cascades was a cool place so I grabbed some water and hiked about 2 more miles to a campsite at mile 411.2. I set up my camp, had some dinner, talked with Crow and Tom who were going about two more miles to Moreland Gap Shelter, talked with Croc who came by and Books who decided to set up across the trail from me.

It looked like we were going to get some rain today but you couldn’t tell by the weather. I was able to get a little bit of a sunrise coming up from behind a mountain and it was outstanding. Just after 0700 I made it to Moreland Gap Shelter. Crow, Tom(Tight tights), Devon and Low Key were all getting ready to start so we discussed plans for the day. I continued on and about an hour later I came to a nice meadow with some stone and log seats. I stopped for breakfast. While I was eating, Low Key, and just a little later, Devon walked past me. I finished breakfast and a little later I passed Devon and then Low Key. That’s kind of how it works on the trail. Around 0900 it began to rain. Nothing too drastic but a steady rain. This area was very pretty with a river and several small rock canyons that you pass through. I made it to Laurel Forks Falls. I had talked with some hikers and they had said this was a must see. When I got to the trail leading down, there were two young women hikers who were just starting down the wet and rocky decline. They stopped to let me pass. The trail down was all rock and the rocks were all wet from the rain. Very slippery. All I could think on the way down was how tough the hike back up was going to be later. When I was almost to the bottom I saw two other hikers partaking in some green stuff. When I got down to them, I commented on how much fun the hike back up was going to be. They looked at me like I had three heads. I get that a lot so I wasn’t sure if was me or the pot! The falls were spectacular and if the weather had been nicer I would have stayed for lunch. I saw the two other hikers stop, take a picture, and then take a side trail along the river. I started back up the trail. When I got to the top, I realized that the side trail the two hikers were taking was actually the AT. So back down I went, after laughing at myself, and continued on the trail. I walked along the river for a awhile and then the big climb of the day. A lot of switchbacks, which is good, and then a short two mile descent to Boots Off Hostel.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649792,"While at the hostel yesterday, I took a shower, had my laundry done and went to the local store with 14 other hikers. We rummaged through the store like locusts and then went to Subway or McDonalds. On the way to the store I was sitting next to a young woman. Someone asked where she was from and she said Massachusetts and California….if you know then you know. I asked her where in Massachusetts and she said Cambridge…wow. Her trail name is Toasty and she had spent a couple of days at the hostel due to food poisoning. She is a  Junior at UC Davis studying Environmental Science. We talked about both California and Massachusetts until we got to the store. I got a few things at the store and then to Subway. When we got back, Toasty, Crow, Tight tights and I sat at a picnic table and ate our food. We discussed the trail for tomorrow and Toasty said that it was flat. I was good with that. My plan for today was to push to a shelter 23.7 miles from the hostel, then do a short day the next day and then get into Damascus on Friday and take a zero on Saturday. I woke up at 0530 and was back on trail just before 0600. The trail was flat as it took you along Lake Watauga. It was still a little dark but the scenery was cool. The traiI took you along Wilbur Dam and then up a steep road. As you got about halfway around the lake the trail made a sharp left turn and started climbing. Definitely not flat. The trail went up the mountain and then followed along the ridge. The views to the East were amazing. You could see the lake and other bodies of water tucked in between lush green mountains. I stopped for breakfast but had just a little bit of water so I ate ham and turkey slices as well as a whole bag of Pecan Chocolate Chip cookies. If that company needs a spokesperson I’m their guy. The rest of the day was ups and downs along the ridge line until you crossed highway 91 and walked through a huge pasture. The shelter was just a little way past the pasture. I ate lunch, set up camp, made dinner, hung my food bag and climbed into my hammock. Another long day. A short day tomorrow then Damascus.","Boots Off Hostel

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649794,"Yesterday Crow and Tight tights showed up at the shelter so we discussed plans for today. My legs were feeling a little sluggish so I wanted to do a short mileage day followed by getting into Damascus on Friday early and then a zero day on Saturday. Crow and Tight tights were going to push into Damascus today and then take a zero on Friday. The hike was supposed to be mostly flat with a lot of descent getting into Damascus. I decided to sleep in a little and got up just before 0700. Broke down camp and headed out on trail. It was a perfect weather day, not too hot not too cold. The trail was pretty much the same as yesterday without the lake views. A lot of ridge hiking with some ups and downs. A friend of mine was trying to book me a room at Crazy Larry’s for Friday and Saturday but nothing was available for Saturday. They could fit me in for today and tomorrow. Looked like I was going to Damascus. My legs were definitely a little tired but we chugged along on the trail. The highlight of the day was that I crossed into Virginia. 3 states down and only 11 left to go. I was on my final decent into Damascus and one of my favorite views is when you see green fields down below and a house and farm. Very idyllic! I also can neither confirm nor deny that I may have played a little trekking pole guitar and danced a little bit when Hall & Oates, You Make My Dreams Come True came on my phone. So glad there was no one to see that !! I got into Damascus around 1400. Checked into my room, thank you Kim, and headed down to the local diner for lunch. Stuffed my face with a double bacon cheeseburger and fries and two beers. Headed back to my room to soak in the tub and now I’m trying to figure out where I’m having dinner.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649880,"I woke up this morning after a great night sleep around 0700. My body was starting to recover after a couple of big mileage days. This hostel was very cool. I had my own private room with a bathroom and shower tub combo. There was a very nice common kitchen with all of the amenities. There was also a common bathroom with a washer and dryer and a common room with two big couches, a big screen tv and a huge bookshelf with videos and books. Everything you could ask for and more. The diner opened up at 0800 so I laid in bed until around 0740 and headed over for breakfast. There were a bunch of people waiting outside for the diner to open and then Crow, Tight tights and Bugs arrived. We piled into the diner and sat together for breakfast. Breakfast was great and we discussed plans for the day and tomorrow. Afterwards we headed over to one of the 3 outfitter stores in town. Crow and I were both looking for some new shoes since the ones we had were coming up on 500 miles. The first place did not have what we were looking for so we headed to the Dollar General to see if we could get some resupply. I grabbed most of the stuff I needed and then headed across the street to outfitter number two. I purchased some new shoes, a brand new pair of socks, some Cliff bars and some Nuun tablets which are electrolyte tablets that you mix with water. I headed back to my room to organize my food bag, take another shower, do some laundry, eat some lunch and soak in the tub for a while. My feet are feeling better and I can actually touch them without them hurting. I went over to 7 Trails for dinner. It was karaoke night and there were several hikers there singing songs. A lot of fun and good atmosphere as well as food. Back on the trail tomorrow.","Damascus

I got up at 0530 and was back on the trail/street by 0600. My plan for the day was to hike to a campsite at mile 488. So just under 18 miles. I was thinking three days and a morning to get to Marion for a resupply. They have a free bus that will take you into town and then back to the trail. I walked along the road for about a half mile and then climbed back into the woods. A slight climb out of town and then the trail followed along a river that was flowing very well. I love the sound of a river. There were several river crossings and then the Appalachian Trail was joined by the Virginia Creeper Trail. This trail is used by companies that take people to the top of the Mountain and then they bike down. Today is Saturday so there were a lot of bikes. I almost got taken out by a young kid who swerved towards me. All good in the end. The trails separated after crossing a long wooden bridge and the AT headed back into the woods. I followed along the river again and then started another climb. The trail crossed through a pasture and then another climb. Once at the top, the views were spectacular. Mountains everywhere. Virginia is definitely not flat. I got to the campsite around noon and decided to push onward. The ponies of Grayson Highlands were coming up so that was going to be cool. One more big climb up Mt. Rogers, the highest point in Virginia, and then to Thomas Knob Shelter. I went and got water, set up camp, made dinner, watched the sunset and climbed into my hammock.

I knew there were going to be some great views early and I wanted to make sure I could see them. I was also 1 mile away from the 500 mile mark and I didn’t want to miss that either. I was up at 0600 and on the trail by 0630. I reached the 500 mile mark in about 20 minutes, took some pictures and headed onward. 500 miles seemed more impressive than the earlier marks and I was excited about getting to this point. One quarter of the way! I continued on and the terrain was very rocky. I enjoyed this part both for the views and because you had to pay close attention to the location of the trail. The white blazes were painted on the rocks because there were no trees. And there were some very big rocks. I climbed up onto one and got a great picture of the sunrise. The trail started on a descent and continued to be very rocky. Now there are supposed to be ponies in the area that help with the vegetation. You are strictly advised to not feed or touch them. They will kick and bite. I saw several yesterday but none today. They do add a degree of difficulty to the trail since there is pony poop all over the place. Tough to check the views and watch for pony poop. I made it through Grayson Highlands and the trail followed along a river. I crossed over and stopped for breakfast. A Cliff bar, my coffee concoction and a mini cinnamon bun. I finished breakfast and headed out. There are a lot of gates in this area and it was fun once I figured out how they worked. Around noon I came to another river crossing and stopped for lunch. I ate two tuna Frito burritos. Very good. Drank some water and began another climb. I came to one section where there was a sign informing hikers that an unsafe bridge had been taken down. If there was high water you should go this way but if it was low water you could follow the AT. Not sure how you’re suppose to whether it’s high or low water but I stuck with the AT. A steep climb and the to the water crossing. All good. I was able to cross over on some rocks. I had another little climb then a gradual descent to the shelter. There are four other people here and all are staying in the shelter. I set up my hammock, got some water, made dinner, hung out with Determined, Jeff, Bubbles and Beebop and climbed into my hammock. Another big day, 25.2 miles. Tomorrow, 10 miles to Mt. Rodgers Recreational Center where I can take a free bus into Marion.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650123,"Today was an interesting day. It all started with me getting rained on last night. Since we had scattered cell service at the shelter, I asked Jeff if she, yes Jeff is a female, her trail name is Jeff, if she knew what the forecast was for the night. She had saved the forecast on her phone. It called for a 30 percent chance of rain. I decided to leave my tarp in its snake skin. At around 0015 I felt rain drops on my face so I jumped out of the hammock to open up the tarp. As I started to make that happen, I accidentally pulled the line to release the tarp from the tree. So now it’s starting to rain harder and I’m trying to retie the tarp back onto the tree. I finally get the tarp back on the tree and the snake skin off the tarp. I attached the tarp lines, Beebop who had been returning from the privy offered to help…so nice, and checked on the hammock and my sleeping bag. Both were slightly wet but things could have been a lot worse. I climbed back into the hammock and promptly fell back to sleep. I got up at 0515 and I am back on the trail by 0545. Jeff and Bubbles were up and they were planning on catching the 1115 bus. The first bus was at 0845 and that meant I had 3 hours to do 10.1 miles. I figured I would push the first hour and see how many miles I had covered. I walked through a gate and then into this very cool pasture. It reminded me of Little House on the Prairie. It was slightly dark but you could see how cool it looked. After an hour I had gone 3.5 miles. I could still make it. I continued on but then had a couple climbs. I started to think this could be the deal breaker. After 2 hours I had gone 7.1 miles. It was going to be close. The terrain started to descend and I was thinking I still had a chance. I got to Mt. Rodgers Visitor Center at 0830. 10.1 miles in under 3 hours. There were 3 other hikers waiting for the bus into town. They were going to a hotel and I was going to the Walmart. On the way into town, we stopped and picked up a gentleman who was going for a doctors visit. He asked us a bunch of questions but I was having a hard time understanding him due to his accent. I got dropped off at Walmart and walked across the street to McDonald’s. I ordered the big man’s breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage, a biscuit, 3 pancakes and a large coffee. Afterwards i walked back over to Walmart, sat down on the sidewalk and talked with another hiker. During the conversation I was taking stuff out of my food bag and trying to get things organized. He suggested going to Ingles, the food store next door, instead of Walmart. So I went into Ingles and got my resupply. When I got back outside Ernest, the gentleman we picked up, was out front and he bought sodas for all the hikers sitting outside. I sat outside, organized my food bag and talked with the other hikers. Around lunch time I went back into Ingles and got some sandwiches, chips, some blueberries and an apple. I shared the sandwiches with Ernest and watched the world go by out front. The bus came back to take Ernest and the other hikers back to where they needed to go. Me and 3 other hikers were dropped at the trail and it was time to get back to hiking. There was a Mexican restaurant about 10 miles down the trail in Atkins so I figured I would hike to the restaurant, eat dinner and then find a site to set up camp. There were 2 big climbs during this stretch and they were challenging. Especially after stuffing my face in Marion. There were a couple of really nice views and the weather was perfect. A nice descent into Atkins and then to the Mexican restaurant that is CLOSED on Monday’s. There was a restaurant across the street known for it’s sweetwater, hence the name Sweetwater Venue. A BBQ place so not too bad. The sweetwater was outstanding which was great because their tap water was terrible. It was getting late so I called the Relaxed Inn down the street to see if they had any rooms available. I was in luck so a shower was in my future.

I had taken both my hammock and sleeping bag out of my pack to air them out and let them dry overnight. I packed everything up and I was back on trail by 0600. By 0610 I was off trail but luckily I had checked my phone and turned around. I had missed a turn that took me under highway 81 and then a sharp right turn into the woods. I did not have to use my headlamp because it has been getting lighter earlier. I ended up walking through a pasture and was getting the stink eye from one of the cows. I didn’t really care because there was an awesome sunrise. The trail was pretty mellow the first hour of the hike and I passed the 1/4 mark for northbound hikers. Very cool. Then the climbs began. These climbs were long and steep. The second hour felt like the whole time was a climb. Legs were getting tired and the lungs were burning. I stopped at the top of the mountain and had breakfast. The trail smoothed out and I walked along a river and then crossed the river on a very low bridge with a ruler on it that let drivers know how deep the water was over the bridge. I also encountered a new obstacle. In order to get over the barb wire fences we now had to climb these A frame structures with slats on them. Each time I came to one it appeared to be bigger. I felt like these were obstacles from one of those Ruck Sack races. Next was another climb. A repeat of the previous climb. Long and grueling. I got to the top of the climb and then the descent down to Lick Creek with no bridge and no stepping stones. I took off my shoes and socks, put my camp shoes on and waded across shin high water. Felt nice and refreshing. I decided to have lunch to let my feet dry and then continued onward. Pretty smooth for a short period and then the toughest climb of the day. Lick Creek is at 2254 feet and Chestnut Knob Shelter is at 4407 feet. The climb just kept going up and up and up. There was a pond and a spring at 3902 feet where I stopped to hydrate and then continued onward. The view at the top was amazing. A clearing in the trees looks down on Burke’s Garden which was created by a limestone sinkhole. It was a great reward for a brutal climb. Down I went and finally reached Walker Gap. There were a few campsites which quickly were filled by hikers. I put up my hammock, got water and cooked dinner. I talked with Lil Chap, Flipper and JD. Flipper and JD were cooking sausages over a campfire and they offered one to me. I did not decline and it was outstanding. I climbed into my hammock and worked on the journal.

I did have to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom which was lucky for me because there was a lightning show going on and I love lightning. I went back to sleep and got up at 0530. I was back on trail just after 0600. If you’ve been paying attention then you know that if I stay in a gap there is always a climb. This one was a doozy. The trail started up and brought me back onto the ridge line. The trail continued along the ridge line for about 4 miles with a lot of boulders and ups and downs. The trail finally started a long gradual descent with nice soft dirt covered with pine needles. No rocks, no roots and my knees were happy. Water sources have been a little sparse the last couple of days so when I came to a bridge crossing over a good flowing creek. I stopped for breakfast. A little over my 3 hour mandate but I didn’t have any water. I finished breakfast and then started another climb. Once I got to the top, the trail started another slow descent to the Brushy Mountain Outpost. This was my target spot for the day. I went inside and ordered some chicken nuggets and a chicken fillet sandwich….however no beer, so I had some lemonades. I talked with some of the other hikers. I even got to meet Mischief who I had watched on YouTube. I also got to meet a woman who was hiking with a goat. I think she wanted my food. The goat, not the woman, even though I did give her one nugget. The woman not the goat. I got back on trail and headed to the Helvey’s Mill shelter that was two miles away. I walked down a road, across Interstate 77 and then down another road…..just so I could walk up a nice long climb. The trail leveled out and I got to the trail to the shelter. The shelter was .3 miles down and the water source was another .2 down a steep hill. I was trying to figure if I wanted to do that or if I wanted to hike another 4.4 miles to a campsite. I had a liter of water so I could cook dinner with that amount. Black Hole, a hiker, was coming down the trail from the shelter so I asked him about the water. He told me that there was water at the shelter. A guy named Bill brings two 10 gallon jugs to the shelter every day. I was sold.

My plan was to push to Wapiti Shelter, which was 24.2 miles away, and then an 18 mile day on Friday to set up a nero into Pearisburg on Saturday and possibly a zero on Sunday. My legs have been a little tired and a rest would definitely help. I hike up to a ridge line and ran into Potato Chip. She had camped on top of the ridge line and had a great sunset and sunrise. She also told me that she had seen two bears yesterday. She said they saw her and ran the other way. I continued my hike and ran into Oz. She was on her way to Trent’s Gocery, which was a favorite place for thru hikers. I told her I was heading there too. I had the song from the movie stuck in my head for a while. I then ran into Arc and Local Guy. Arc offered me some seasoned corn nobs and I gratefully accepted. I asked them where they were headed and they said Trent’s Grocery too. The trail was smooth most of the way and I was getting hungry. I stopped to eat a Cliff bar and drink some water and enjoy a nice view. Ironically enough the trees are hiding some of the views. I continued a decline and then crossed over a suspension bridge. When I got to the road, I took a left and walked .5 miles to  Trent’s Grocery. I grabbed a Yoohoo, a Gatorade and ordered a ham and turkey sandwich and some chicken fillets. There were several other hikers there eating and then Oz showed up too. I finished my food and drink and headed .5 miles back to the trail. There was a slight climb and I ran into Shamrock. She was having some issues with her knee and was deciding whether to get off trail. We talked for a while and then I headed out. Dismal Falls was next on my list and that was about two miles away on a .3 side trail. I got to the side trail and headed down. The Falls were awesome. It was a beautiful day and the falls even had a swimming hole. Junior and another hiker were the only two people there so it was perfect. I took off my shoes and shirt and walked into the swimming hole and then dunked under the water. The water was very cold but felt great. I got out, dried on the rocks and then headed back up the trail. I headed to Wapiti Shelter and got there around 1600. I set up camp, ate some dinner and had a great conversation with Wawa Tapi. He was from Quebec and was section hiking and heading south. Ranger Randy, who was at the shelter with me last night, showed up along with four other hikers.

I was back on trail just before 0600 and it was still raining. Early in the hike was a long and steep climb but after that the trail was mostly little ups and downs.

I decided that I would go into town today, zero tomorrow and then back on trail on Sunday. My body was feeling tired and I had done some big miles lately. I had my buddy Rick check on availability and it seemed like everyone had the same idea. Nothing available. I decided that I would go into town and see if I could find a place to stay.

I went up to the common room and got some coffee, took a seat and listened to the hikers that were getting back on trail today. I finished my coffee and went to grab my food bag. I wanted to do an inventory before I went to the Food Lion for a resupply. I talked with another hiker about food selection while on trail and then made a list of what I felt I needed when I left tomorrow. Daleville looked like the next resupply which was about 45.5 miles so I was thinking about 2.5 days of food. Sounded good to me since more food meant more pack weight. The all you could eat Chinese buffet restaurant opened up at 1100 so I headed over and ate lunch. Afterwards I went next door to the Food Lion and got what I needed for the trail plus a Cobb salad and Ruffles potato chips for dinner. Oh, and a six pack of beer. I usually end up handing out most of the beers since I’m not drinking six of them the night before I get on trail. Most hikers have a difficult time turning down free cold beer so it’s not too difficult to get rid of them.

I got to the trail at 0615 and immediately headed downhill. I crossed over route 100 which is the other way to get to Pearisburg.

They had a ton of questions for both of us and wished us luck. Toad and I walked together for a while We started a long descent to the shelter and Toad let me go ahead.

Also coming up were three iconic sights on the AT: Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. I would probably get those tomorrow and Wednesday and then into Daleville for a resupply and some breakfast. There were three big climbs this morning and then a walk through a farm pasture. I walked through the pasture for about four miles and it was a nice change of pace. Along the way I passed Keffer Oak which is the largest oak on the AT in the south. It is estimated to be 300 years old. Pretty cool. The trail was busy today. I probably passed 10 hikers. I also ran into Strider who was at the shelter last night. We hiked together until we got to Niday Shelter for lunch. I left before Strider and immediately hit two large climbs. One took me to the Audie Murphy Memorial which was very interesting. I had a descent and then ran into trail magic. A cooler full of sodas. I grabbed some orange soda drink and it had zero chance. Not more than half a mile later, I crossed over a bridge and ran into Jason who was talking to three other hikers. They told me this was the last water source before the shelter and the shelter water was down a steep hill. I filled up my water and Jason asked me if I wanted a beer. Uh, yes? He gave me a beer and we talked for a while. He asked if I wanted another beer and I declined….I know…really? I said thanks and headed up the last climb of the day.

I scared 3 deer that were feeding on a hill and as I got close to where they had been I could smell them too. Not sure if that was my hiker nose working or the fact that they really smelled. Finally someone who stunk more than me. I got to Dragon’s Tooth just before 0800. Strider was already there enjoying the view and I checked it out myself.

I had some more pasture hiking and then I came to route 311. There was a bag hanging on a tree with bags of chips and oranges. I grabbed an orange, put it in my pocket and began another long climb. I don’t know what it was but my legs felt great and I flew up the mountain. McAfee Knob did not disappoint. The views were outstanding and I stayed there for a while drinking my beer and eating lunch along with my orange. I talked with some section and day hikers and then headed back down the mountain. It was just after 1400 and Tinker Cliffs was just over 6 miles away so I decided to push to a campsite just past there. They say that if you hit all three sights in one day that you have completed the triple crown. Looks like that was going to happen for me. As fresh as my legs felt earlier, they were starting to get a little tired. After another big climb I got to Tinker Cliffs. Once again the views were awesome. I met a day hiker by the name of JD and we talked for a while. He offered me an apple and two mini Kind bars. I did not refuse and I thanked him profusely. I decided that I would take a nero, low mileage and a hotel bed, tomorrow heading into Daleville so I booked a hotel for tomorrow night. I need to get a new headlamp and also a new bear hang line that apparently I left at Pickle Branch Shelter this morning. I got to the campsite, set up camp, watched two deer eat as I was cooking dinner and then climbed into my hammock. Only 9 miles into Daleville tomorrow so some food and supplies. They have a great bbq place so I’m looking forward to that. Great day. 23.1 miles.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650768,"My campsite was awesome. I slept about 5 yards from a creek. I fell asleep to the sound of the water flowing downstream. I was up at 0530 and on trail by 0600. I knew that I only had about 9 miles to get into Daleville but I wanted to get there early enough to have breakfast somewhere. The trail was pretty smooth to start and then the climb began. Every time I thought I was heading down into Daleville, I would start to climb again. After about a mile of climb, I came to a ledge that overlooked Tinker Creek Valley. The views the last two days have been amazing. I then continued to climb until I got to a place called Hay Rock. The view looking out to Carvin Cove Reservoir was stunning. I ran into a couple that I have seen the last three days going the other way and I still can’t figure it out. They must be section hiking. I also ran into two other hikers that were slack packing. I finally began the descent into Daleville. My legs were feeling a little tired and maybe because they knew they were going to get some rest. I got to US Route 220 right around 0930. I ran into another hiker and asked him where the Super 8 was located. He pointed across the highway and it was right there. He told me where the outfitters and the bbq place was and I thanked him for the info. I walked over to the hotel and they let me check in right away. I was informed that the bbq place was closed on Wednesdays…..really? I went up to my room, took a shower, got my clothes that needed to be washed and did laundry. I did an inventory of food and walked over to the outfitters to get a new headlamp as well as new cord for my food bag. Next door was the grocery store and I did my resupply. I walked back to the hotel and then walked next door to the Mexican restaurant for lunch. Good food and good beer. I went back to my room and took a nice hot bath. I organized my food bag and looked at what is coming up on trail. I’m just hanging out now and planning on going back to the Mexican place for dinner. I have decided that Ghost is going to be my trail name so that is one thing that I don’t have to worry about anymore. Ghost came from me being at a shelter or campsite when it got dark and then being gone in the morning. 9.3 miles today and my body is loving it. I’m thinking some big miles coming up in the next couple of days. We shall see.","Lamberts Meadow Campsite

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650953,"I was up at 0500 today and took my time getting packed up. I went down to the lobby and got some coffee and ate a honeybun and a snickers bar. The trail is about 100 yards from the hotel and it was still a little dark so I used my new headlamp. About 20 minutes into the hike, I came around a bend and spooked five deer that had been eating in the meadow. They bounced away and I moved along. About 10 minutes later I spooked another deer and it sprinted away. I came out onto a road and saw the 1/3 of the way sign. Very cool. The trail took me out to a pasture and the surrounding scenery was very pretty. The pasture led into the woods and a long climb. While climbing, I ran into two hikers who I had passed three times in three days. They are hiking the AT for the second time but they are using two cars and hiking sections southbound. They have cycled across the US and up and down the Pacific coast. Deja Vu and Ibuprofen were their names. We talked for a while and then moved on. The climb brought me up to the ridge line and the Blue Ridge Parkway. The views were awesome and the trail crossed over the Parkway numerous times. At one point I came to a viewing area and there were several people checking out the views. We talked for about 20 minutes and I answered a lot of questions about thru-hiking. One of the women was supporting her husband while he thru-hiked. She drove a van and met him along the way. Very nice. Later on, at one of the viewing areas, I stopped for lunch and enjoyed the view. I also enjoyed the trash can that was available. The trail finally left the Parkway and started a descent that ended at a road and a creek. Four Pack and James were there eating and loading up on water. I drank a liter of water and decided to push on to the second shelter since the first one did not have water. Two big climbs and a descent led me to the Bryant Ridge Shelter. There were not any spots to hang my hammock so I hiked back .2 miles to a campsite along the creek. 31.8 miles today and now in my hammock listening to the rain on my tarp. Big day and my right knee was a little finicky so I took some Aleve for the first time and stretched. We’ll see how it feels tomorrow.","Daleville

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650959,"So just to be clear, I did not stay at the shelter though I did go to the shelter. There was no place to hang my hammock so I walked .2 miles back to a campsite next to the creek. It was an awesome spot and I slept very well. Today was two different days. The beginning of the day was basically one long climb. Every time I thought that the climb was leveling off I would begin to climb again. I once did a Tough Mudder race in Vermont. One of the obstacles was called WTF. It was a hill that just kept going up. That’s what I thought about today and I actually said WTF! The rain was on and off most of the day. It would start to sprinkle, you could hear it through the trees, maybe last five minutes and then stop. This went on most of the day. Most of the views today were of clouds. I went to check one side trail and ran into Stomps. He was just taking a break for breakfast. We talked a little about the view and Trail Days which was taking place in Damascus this weekend. I moved on and continued with the climb. I finally made it to the top, at least I was above the clouds. I stopped for lunch and then started a long decline. On the way down I came to the Guillotine which is a section of rock that you pass through with a large rock hanging above you! It was cool and I was glad the rock stayed in place. I crossed over the Blue Ridge Parkway and ran into Pyro and Go Go. Go Go looked like she was ready to get off trail so I helped Pyro figure out where they were so that they could call a friend to come pick them up. The trail continued to be either flat or on a decline. I was able to make some good time and eventually made it to the James River Bridge, which at 1000 feet long,  is the longest foot bridge on the AT. They apparently have had issues with hikers jumping from the bridge so there are signs promising fines if you decide to do so. I declined and started the last climb of the day to the shelter. I got to the shelter, set up camp and made dinner. Quitter, Last Call and Buck showed up and we discussed resupply plans, shuttles and the fact that Buck knew the dad of my roommate my first year at Springfield. Small world. My knee felt great today so that was good. 26.7 miles today and possibly more rain tonight and tomorrow.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651021,"Today was an interesting day with a lot of changes. I was up just after 0500 and on the trail by 0545. If I had known what was coming up I might have stayed in my hammock. The shelter is at 1008 feet and as soon as I got on trail I was climbing. Same weather as yesterday except it wasn’t raining. A lot of mist and the trees were still dripping from the rain. In three miles I had climbed to 2911 feet and I wasn’t done. I had a little decline then another climb up Bluff Mountain which stood at 3351 feet. It was a tough climb and my legs were not happy. I started down the mountain and stopped at Punchbowl Shelter to have some breakfast. Fever Pitch, who I had met yesterday at John’s Hollow Shelter and a Boston anything fan, was there and we talked about the early climb. I finished breakfast and Fever Pitch and I headed out. It was the best thing that happened to me. I followed behind him and he talked about the Pats, Celtics, Bruins and especially the Red Sox. The miles seemed to just melt away. About two miles from the Brown Mountain Shelter, where I was planning to stop, we ran into Sawyer and Sean. We all hiked the last two miles and sat down for lunch. I was planning on staying at this shelter, meeting up with Quitter and getting a shuttle into Buena Vista tomorrow for a resupply. We heard that there was trail magic at the road two miles further on so I decided I would go there and see if I could find a place to camp. I ate lunch and headed onward. I got to the road crossing and no trail magic. Richiedanger, a hiker who had grown up in Connecticut, was waiting for a shuttle into town. He asked if I wanted to join him. I texted Quitter and told him I was going to resupply today, get a shuttle ride back and get to the next shelter that was three miles further. The shuttle arrived and took us to the dollar store. Richiedanger and I talked about our meals, where to resupply next and some other logistics. As we were shopping, it started to thunder and then rain. I decided I’d stay in town and catch the shuttle out tomorrow morning with Richiedanger. I got a room at the Budget Inn, organized my food, ordered a pizza and took a shower. Body feels better now and looking forward to getting back on trail tomorrow. 20.1 miles today.","Johns Hollow Shelter

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651205,"I was up around 0600. I packed everything up and then walked across the street to the gas station to grab a coffee, a calorie laden breakfast bun and a bag of mini chocolate donuts. I sat on a bench outside my room eating my food and drinking my coffee. Richiedanger, another hiker and I had a 0730 shuttle with our driver, Leonard, back up to the trailhead. We arrived just before 0800 and Richiedanger and I said our goodbyes. The morning climbs were starting to become a thing and this morning was no different. Bald Knob sat at 4045 feet and I was at 2059. Once at the top the views were amazing. I stayed at elevation for a while and I was spoiled by all the views. Cole Mountain and Cole Mountain Bald were outstanding.  Somewhere along this stretch I ran into three women who were section hiking. They told me of some trail magic at the bottom of the mountain after Priest Shelter. That was about 14 miles from me so I was pretty sure they would be long gone by the time I got there. The trail leveled out and I made good time. I got to Crabtree Falls Trailhead and ran into Sawyer and Sean. I was coming up on them and I tripped and fell on the trail. I jumped back up and told them I was ok! Pretty funny. We talked about the trail magic and agreed we weren’t going to make it. Then another big climb up to The Ledges at 4018 feet. My legs felt good but it was definitely a challenging climb. Then a huge descent down to Tye River where there were some campsites and I was planning on staying. When I got to Tye River there was a sign that said there was trail magic across the footbridge. It was just after 1600 on a Sunday and I couldn’t believe they were still there. Cactus, Not a Bear, Morning Laurie and Gunni had a set up that was amazing. They had theu-hiked in 2016 and they new what hikers wanted while on trail. I had two cheeseburgers, three hot dogs, three bags of chips, four Dr. Peppers, two beers, a bag of peanuts, countless protein bars and some other snacks. Swayer and Sean along with Fever Pitch showed up about an hour later and we just hung out and ate. The campsite was just on the other side of the bridge and right along the creek so I set up camp and went back to just hang out around the fire. A little later it started to thunder so I climbed into my hammock and went to sleep. A good day. 25.4 miles","Buena Vista, Virginia

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651211,"The plan for today was to hike 25 miles to the Paul Wolfe Shelter. That would put me 4.8 miles from Waynesboro and I could do a nero on Tuesday. Waynesboro is known as the friendliest hiker town on the AT. It also has Ming Garden, a Chinese restaurant, which has an all you can eat buffet. I was planning on staying at the Parks and Rec campsite where thru-hikers get to stay for free. Well, that was the plan. Stick to the plan, the plan is fluid. So, as has been the norm the last couple of days, I got up, packed up camp and started a long and steep climb. My legs are never happy with me when we start uphill right away. They need a little time to warm up. Tye River is at 901 feet. Three Ridges is at 3965. 6 miles of uphill climbing. However, the weather was perfect for hiking and the views were great. I was a little slow early so I was definitely thinking of stopping at the shelter. After Three Ridges, there was Hanging Rock Overlook and Bee Mountain. I came to a meadow which is always a nice change of pace and then headed down to the Three Ridges Overlook. The trail started to mellow out a little so I was able to pick up the pace. Breakfast had a great view and lunch was at Cedar Cliffs with another great view. Near the end of the day, or so I thought, there was another climb up to Humpback Rocks. The trail started to descend and I got to the Paul Wolfe Shelter just around 1600. I drank a liter of water next to Mill Creek which was flowing heavily. I then decided I would push on to Rockfish Gap, 4.8 miles, and get a ride into Waynesboro. That just changed tomorrow into a zero instead of a nero. If I only knew…First of all, it was a climb from the shelter. Then the trail leveled out and then it climbed again. Not too drastic but since I was going to a Gap I figured I would be going down. Not the case. I called a shuttle to see if I could get a ride to town but no answer so I left a message. It has been said that there is a list of numbers for trail angels who will give you a ride into town. I have yet to see that list. Anyway, I got to Rockfish Gap right around 1745. According to the FarOut app, there is a list on the food truck located near the Gap. I found the food truck but no list. So, I started walking towards town, 4.5 miles, and hoped for a ride. After about 5 minutes of walking, a car pulled up in front of me. I was so excited except for the fact that it was just a guy trying to figure out where he was going. I plugged the Parks and Rec address into my phone and hoped for the best. I got into town and stopped at the first gas station that I saw to get something to drink. I started to take my pack off before I went into the store and a guy shook his head and said, “You’re in the hood, take it inside with you or it will be gone when you come out.” Waynesboro, the hood, who knew? Anyway, I went inside, bought two large Gatorades and drank them outside next to my pack. I continued my walk and believe it or not came to the park for thru-hikers. I was the only one there and the park was a little off the beaten path but I had my own Porta-Potty. So I had that going for me. Now you are required to have a permit, which is free, to camp at the park. I had tried to call all three places that give the permit and they were all closed. So it looked like I was going rogue. I had hiked a total of 34.3 miles and my legs were feeling it so I wasn’t going anywhere. While I was setting up camp, a woman from across the street came out of a house yelling at someone in the house. This continued with some door slamming for a while and then silence. I also had an older gentleman who was walking his three chihuahuas. One of them came up to me barking so I stopped setting up my hammock and talked to the dog. Every time I would turn around to work on my hammock, the dog would start barking at me again. The man said nothing to the dog and eventually they walked away. I felt safer in the woods. There was no water available at the park so I ate tortillas, chicken packets, bacon bits and protein bars for dinner. It was getting late so I climbed into my hammock and kept my fingers crossed that the police would not be raiding the park later. Officially 29.8 miles today and a big breakfast on my mind for tomorrow.","Tye River

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651285,"I tried to sleep in but breakfast was awaiting. I was up at 0600 and packed up camp. I didn’t feel comfortable leaving my stuff at the park. I walked the .7 miles to Weasie’s Kitchen and ordered the hungry hiker breakfast. It was amazing and I kept the waitress busy refilling my water and coffee. I worked on my journal entries while I ate so I wouldn’t eat too fast. After breakfast, I walked across the street to the laundry place and washed my clothes. I wore my rain jacket so I could wash my shirts. After laundry, my next task was to get to the YMCA so that I could get the permit for camping at the park. I walked into the YMCA and Lisa, behind the counter, was incredible. She set me up with a permit, gave me a towel so that I could take a shower and also worked on getting me a ride back to the trail tomorrow. I went down to the locker room, weighed myself(165lbs, yikes!) and took a shower, which was amazing. I then spent some time talking with Lisa about her son, who was graduating from high school. He is Autistic and she was so excited about him getting his high school diploma. Lisa allowed me to leave my pack behind the counter, which was great, and I headed towards Ming Garden. I wasn’t really hungry yet so I walked around Krogers, the grocery store, to see what they had for my resupply. While wandering around, I got a call from Yellow Truck who told me he would be at the park tomorrow at 0730 to take me back to Rockfish Gap. I was so happy I didn’t have to walk back. Thanks to Lisa. I ran into Sawyer, Sean and his girlfriend, Kaitlin who were doing their resupply. We talked for a while and I told them about getting a permit from the Y. I decided it was time for lunch so I walked across the parking lot to Ming Garden. I had four plates of food and drank more water. Feeling full, I went back to Krogers and did my resupply. Afterwards, I walked back to the Y and organized my food bag. I charged my battery and my phone, said goodbye to Lisa and headed to the River Burger Bar for an early dinner. I got to the place, sat at the bar and had a couple beers and their Potachos!Nachos except with thick potato chips and pulled pork. Very tasty. I walked over to Krogers, grabbed a bag of Ruffles and a water and headed back to the park. I set up camp, talked with Press, who was also staying at the park and ate my bag of chips and drank my water. I climbed into my hammock, read a little and went to sleep.

I broke down camp and talked with Sawyer for a while. He, Sean and Kaitlin had cowboy camped last night, which means they put a tarp down on the ground with an air mattress, put their sleeping bag down, climbed in and went to sleep. Apparently Sean was not a fan. For breakfast I ate a snickers bar, a honeybun and some other pastry that was 450 calories. Yellow Truck showed up right on time and the four of us climbed into the vehicle. He drove us to Rockfish Gap, wished us luck and sent us on our way. No charge. We thanked him and headed up the trail to the kiosk to fill out our permits. You must have a permit when hiking in  Shenandoah National Park. The permits are free. Sawyer, Sean and Kaitlin were hiking together so we said our goodbyes and off I went. The day was not as difficult as some other days. The weather was perfect, the climbs were not as challenging as other days and the trail was smooth most of the day. The Shenandoah section of the AT has waysides which are stores/restaurants/bars that offer various resupply options as well as food. None today but I’m looking forward to seeing what these waysides are all about. One climb took me to Bear Den Mountain which had a weather radar station at the summit. Another climb took me to Little Calf Mountain which had some nice views. I stopped at a creek to have breakfast and Never Better walked by and said hi. We have run into each other several times the last couple of days and we would probably be leap frogging each other most of the day. I finished breakfast and eventually passed Never Better when he stopped for lunch. I stopped for lunch at the Riprap Trailhead. I had not made very good time in the morning but my legs were feeling good now and the trail was smooth. The miles melted away. I met up again with Never Better about .3 miles from the Blackrock Hut. We hiked in together and began setting up camp. We have the same hammock so we talked about our setups and what the weather was going to be tonight. Several other hikers showed up and it looked like this was going to be a popular place tonight. I got water, made dinner and climbed into my hammock.

He came over to my hammock and asked if I was interested in getting up early and hiking .7 miles to Blackrock to see the sunrise. I was definitely up for a sunrise. Sawyer talked to Never Better and he was in too. So I was up at 0415 with Sawyer. It had been raining on and off all night so we weren’t sure if we would be able to see the sunrise but we decided to give it a shot. Never Better was a hard no and went back to sleep. Using our headlamps, Sawyer and I got up to Blackrock around  0515. It was a rock scramble to the top but we found a place out of the wind where we could make some breakfast before the show. The clouds were whipping across the top of the mountain so we weren’t sure if we would see the sunrise. We saw a little bit of sunlight East of us but it was blocked by another mountain. Just as we were ready to call it quits, the sun started to peek out from the top of another mountain. With the mountain, the clouds and the sun we were presented an awesome sunrise. I couldn’t decide whether to take pictures or just enjoy the views. Never Better showed up just as the sun snuck behind some clouds. I let him look at my pictures. Never Better headed out and I said my goodbye to Sawyer. He was going to wait for Sean and Kaitlin. I wanted to make it to Hightop Hut which was a total of 21.4 miles from Blackrock Hut. I caught up with Never Better and we hiked for a little bit until he needed to stop for a minute. I continued on and had my mind on a wayside that was coming up in a few miles. I had to stop for a minute and Never Better caught up to me. We were both heading to the wayside so we hiked together on our way there. We got to Loft Mountain Camp Store just before it was to open at 0900. Never Better and I bought some food to eat, a Gatorade and a beer. The beer was $1.50! We went outside, ate our food and drank our beer. I went back and bought Never Better and myself another beer. This one was $1.69. Christian, who was working behind the counter, was from Boston and was going to UMass Lowell. We talked for a little bit and I went back outside. Never Better and I drank our beers and headed out. I was heading to the Hut and he was heading another 5 miles US 33 to catch a shuttle to a hostel in Elkton. He was planning on taking a zero tomorrow. We hiked together for the rest of the day. We talked about our lives and how our hikes had been going so far. The miles seemed to go by quickly and we arrived at the 900 mile mark. Seemed like a big deal to us. We then stopped at a rocky area with a nice view for lunch. We had a little climb, for me, up to the Hut and Never Better stopped to get some water there. We arrived just after 1500. I set up camp and we exchanged phone numbers so we could stay in touch. We said our goodbyes and he continued his climb up and over Hightop Mountain.

I knew I had a little climb left to get to the top of Hightop Mountain so I was prepared for it but it was only for about a half mile. Up and over and no big deal. It is getting lighter earlier every day so I did not have to use my headlamp. The weather was supposed to be warm today which was fine for me. I just needed to be a little more aware of the water sources. There were a couple of early ups which resulted in some early downs. I would be passing two waysides today so I was excited about visiting them. I stopped near the top of Saddleback Mountain around 0900 to eat a Cliff bar and drink my coffee concoction. I continued down the mountain and the trail leveled off quite a bit. Around 1130 I got to Lewis Mountain Campground, the first wayside of the day. I went into the store and bought a Jumbo Honey Bun, which accounted for 590 calories, a Gatorade, a packet of Spam, a snickers bar, a Cliff protein bar, a Jimmy Dean sausage egg and cheese sandwich, a ham and cheese hoagie and a beer. Ken, who was working behind the counter was super friendly and super helpful. I ate the honey bun, the Jimmy Dean sandwich and drank the Gatorade and the beer. The other stuff I packed into my food bag for later. While eating I talked with a section hiker who had started with two of his friends but they had dropped out. I also talked with Turtle who had started on the trail on March 1st and was getting off trail today because of his foot. I went back inside and bought a bag of trail mix and another beer. I finished both and headed back on trail. I started another climb and got to the top of Bearfence Mountain where a little view of the valley could be seen between the trees. The trail leveled out again and I ran into Chef. He was thru hiking and he had the same shoes as me. We talked a little about them, that’s a whole different story, and I continued onward. Around 1330 I arrived at Big Meadows Wayside. I went inside and got a Gatorade, another hoagie, a bag of Fritos and another beer. I found a picnic table and had lunch. I ate the ham and cheese hoagie, the bag of chips and drank the beer. A couple next to me asked if I wanted some cooked sausages. Uh….yes. So they gave me some and a bottle of water. I went back inside and got another beer, a bag of trail mix and a fuel canister. I said hi to Chef who was also grabbing some stuff and then I got back on trail. I had just a little over four miles to the hut that I was staying at tonight and it was just past 1400. I was not in a hurry. Along the way, I met Muck. Muck lives in Georgetown, Massachusetts.He had been section hiking with his brother, Vinegar who had finished earlier in the week. Muck was heading to the next shelter too so we hiked together. He was going to continue on to Harpers Ferry where he was going to be getting off trail. We talked during the last couple of miles until we hit a big climb up to the shelter. Then not a lot of talking. We got to Rock Spring Hut and set up our stuff. I got some water, ate my hoagie, my bag of trail mix and three of the sausages. I also drank my beer that I had carried from the wayside. Chef had shown up along with four other hikers and everyone did their own routines. I donated my last two sausages to one of the other hikers and said my good nights, climbed into my hammock and worked on my journal.

It was dark so I grabbed my headlamp and saw a deer walking down the hill towards my hammock. He obviously did not seem bothered by me being there and walked right past me. A few minutes later I hear the deer coming back towards me. The deer stood right next to one of the trees I was using for my hammock. The deer even looked right at me and just continued to eat. The deer was there for more than 10 minutes just eating something near the tree. I finally heard it run away. Amazing. I was up and out on trail by 0545. I wanted to make it to Gravel Springs Hut which was just over 28 miles from Rock Spring Hut. I also wanted to make it to the Elkwallow Wayside which was just over 22 miles. The waysides were spoiling me and it was cool to be able to go in and grab food and drinks. The day looked to be pretty nice but also pretty hot. There were going to be a lot of good views today which meant a lot of big climbs and the water situation was a little iffy too with a couple long stretches with no water. An early climb took me up to the top of Stony Man Mountain elevation 3972 feet. The views were outstanding. The trail made a slight descent and then followed along the roadway. I made it to Pinnacle Picnic Grounds and stopped for breakfast. I then continued on to another climb up to the Pinnacle which had more great views. The next big view was at the top of Mary’s Rock. Very cool and then a long descent. It is Saturday and I probably saw more day hikers on the way down then I had seen on the whole trip combined. I crossed over US Route 211 and started another climb. On the backside, I ran into two men who had been working on the trail. We talked for a while about the trail, one gentleman had worked in Woburn, and then I continued on to Elkwallow Wayside. I made it there just after 1400. I bought a Gatorade, a Pepsi, a beer, a package of pop tarts and a beef stick. I drank all of the drinks and ate the food plus two tuna frito burritos that I made from the food in my food bag. I then went back inside and bought two hoagies, a super honey bun, a Cliff bar, a small can of sour cream and onion Pringles and a large bag of peanut M&M’s. I ate the M&M’s and packed the rest for dinner tonight and food in the morning. With my stomach full, I started on the last part of my hike. I had 5.7 miles to the hut. I passed a couple of hikers and ran into Old School. I asked him about his shoes because they were different from any I had seen on trail. He made them which I thought was very cool. He was from Portland, Oregon so we talked about the West coast for a while. We also talked about the trail and what we were eating. We got to the side trail for the hut and he continued onward while I headed to the Hut. It was around 1600 and there were a lot of hikers there. I found a spot to put my hammock, got my water and then ate my two hoagie sandwiches and my chips. I’m a little tired but I have a shorter day planned for tomorrow. 28.4 miles today.","Rock Spring Hut

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651714,"Last night I didn’t put out my tarp. I had it ready to go just in case. Around 2230 I woke up and saw lightning off in the distance. Light thunder so I wasn’t too worried. Around 2345 I woke up and the thunder and lightning were directly over me. I got out of my hammock and had my tarp set up in about five minutes. It started to rain just as I got back into my hammock. I was back asleep in about three minutes. Today was a perfect example of how quickly things can change on the AT. I was up early and on trail by 0530. Word on the trail was that there is a trolley that will pick you up at the trailhead and shuttle you into Front Royal where Vibrissa Brewing offers free showers and laundry. They also give you one free beer with an order of a beer. One time only deal. The trailhead was 13.4 miles from the hut and the first trolley was at 0945. I wasn’t sure I could do 13.4 miles in four hours and 15 minutes but I thought I would give it a try. It would be nice to get into town, take a shower, do a quick laundry, resupply and eat some food. After an hour I had done 3.2 miles so I figured I had a chance. I passed Lightfoot, who I had met at the hut last night and he told me that the trolley may not run on Sunday. That kind of put a damper on things but I was still making good time.  There were a couple of little hills but mostly flat ground. Then I started a descent and ended up in a neighborhood. Apparently I missed a turn back up the hill. Not good. It was 0845 and I had 3.8 miles to go. Not looking good. I wasn’t happy with myself for going the wrong way but I figured I’d get the next trolley at 1145, that is if it was running. There was a big climb and then a big descent to the trailhead and I got there just after 1000. I was looking for information on the board about the trolley when a day hiker came from the other direction. I asked him about the trolley. He didn’t know but he asked me where I was going. I said Front Royal and he said he could give me a ride. The trail provides. Chris dropped me off in front of the brewery and I thanked him. There were four other hikers waiting for the brewery to open at 1100  including Old School who I had hiked with yesterday. There was a bakery next door so I went in and bought a cinnamon pecan bun and a coffee. When the brewery opened we all went to the room where the shower and laundry were located. One shower, one washer and one dryer in a very compact room. Other hikers showed up and I decided to head to the brewery. I charged my battery, my phone and ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries and a beer. I got my one free beer, talked with Old School for a while and then headed to the outfitter for some new shoes. I wear the Altra Lone Peaks. I loved the 5’s, that I had originally but were unavailable in Damascus and was  absolutely disappointed with the 6’s which are the new model. So I bought a pair of 5’s that were 30% off. Kathy, who worked there, asked if she could keep my old shoes to show her boss. They were that bad. I hustled over to the grocery store to resupply and then to the visitor center where the Trolley picked me up and took me to the trailhead. I had originally planned on hiking to the next hut, which had a solar shower, but I had heard that a lot of hikers were planning on stopping there. So I hiked to a campsite just 2.5 miles further down the trail where I am by myself. I ate a Caesar salad and a whole container of peanut butter fudge cookies that I had carried out for 
dinner. A thunderstorm moved in so I jumped into my hammock and listened to the wind, rain and thunder. Interesting day.","Gravel Spring Hut

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651720,"Last night I was reading in my hammock when I started to itch from the waist down. I didn’t know if it was from all the sweat during the day or if I was having an allergic reaction to something. I looked at my legs and they had little red dots on them. I had some Benadryl however it was up in a tree with my food. I scratched a lot and tried to go to sleep. There is a movie called Trains Planes and Automobiles. That should have been the name of this campsite. There were railroad tracks .5 miles away and several trains came by during the night. I think the engineers are actually trying to wake people up with the train horn. The campsite also appeared to be right under the approach to Dulles or Reagan International. I could hear planes flying over on a regular basis. The train tracks ran right along Interstate 66 which had a lot of truck traffic that liked to use their clutch brakes. Anyway, back to the itching. I woke up around 2330 having to itch. I grabbed my phone and started to read some more while I intermittently scratched. The itchiness started to subside and I was finally able to fall asleep to the symphony of the outside world. I continue to sleep through my 0500 alarm but also continue to wake up sometime between 0500 and 0530. Today I was up at 0515. My itching had stopped though I still had little red dots. Interesting. My plan for today was to hike to a campsite right around 23 miles. Then tomorrow do the same and then go into Harpers Ferry on Wednesday and take a zero on Thursday. My body and mind could use a day off. Today I would be passing the 1000 mile mark and I was kind of excited about that feat. The day did not have any big views however I would be entering the Roller Coaster which is a 14 mile stretch of steep climbs and descents. Should be fun. The trail today switched from hiking through a tunnel of trees and long grass to hiking on dirt and grass roads. I entered the Roller Coaster and immediately started a long climb which then turned into a long descent. This continued for a while and I passed a couple of hikers going the other way. I hiked for about 20 more minutes and then ran into the same two hikers who were taking a break. We looked at each other for a moment and then they informed me I was going the wrong way. Like I said earlier, by body and mind need a rest. I have no idea how I got turned around but luckily for me they had stopped for a break or I might still be heading South. I headed back in the correct direction and about a half-hour later I came upon trail magic. Lady Diva had hot dogs, chips, soda, bananas and cookies. I ate two dogs, drank 5 cups of Dr. Pepper, chips and a banana. Perfect timing. I thanked her and moved along. I hit the 1000 mile mark and took a picture. Kind of hard to wrap my mind around the fact that I have hiked 1000 miles. Seems far. I moved along and stopped at a creek about .5 miles from the campsite to load up on water. I then climbed up to the site. I set up camp, made dinner, hung my food bag and climbed into my hammock. Slight rain at the moment but nothing like yesterday. Good day.","Campsite 979.9

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651834,"Today was a struggle fest. I was up at 0501 and it was still raining. By 0515 the rain had stopped and I was on the trail by 0545. I had slept very well but the body felt tired. It had rained most of the night and the trail looked like it. Puddles, mud and wet rocks.  My right knee was still a little finicky and I knew I had about 23 miles for today. The trail was very rocky and with the rain the rocks were very slippery. I was heading down the trail almost to VA Route 7 when I stepped on a rock that had a little slant. I went down landing on my left butt cheek and left shin. My butt cheek does not have as much cushion as it used to have but I survived the fall. I scraped up my shin and the fall made me mad more than anything. I knew my body was tired so I tried to slow myself down a little to avoid any more falls. I crossed over VA Route 7, taking my life into my own hands, as cars flew by on the road. Originally, my goal for today was to hike to a campsite outside of Harpers Ferry and then go to the Visitors Center, get my picture taken and get my new tag number the following day. Last night I decided my body needed a rest so I decided to try to get to the Visitors Center before they closed at 1600. I had my buddy Rick get me a room at the Quality Inn, thanks Rick, and my brother, Brian, thank you, got me two nights at the same hotel. So I knew I would get two full days of rest. So excited. I had a couple of ups and downs left with the Roller Coaster including two big climbs and then the trail leveled out. I started a gradual descent into Harpers Ferry and the rain was mostly light. There was a view point looking out at the Shenandoah River so I decided to check it out. I had to go down a steep hill with wet rocks and promptly fell again. All good but I was definitely ready to get into town. I crossed over the Shenandoah River and made my way over to the Visitors Center. It was just after 1400. They took my picture and gave me my new tag number. When I left Amicalola Falls my number was 2169 and my new number is 364. Wow. I met Sock Monkey who was also heading to the Quality Inn so we walked over to the hotel and checked in. After a shower and laundry, Sock Monkey and I ordered pizza to be delivered. A large pizza each. We sat in the lobby talking about the trail waiting for our pizzas when Scott, a motorcycle rider who was riding along the coast, asked if we needed anything at 7-11. Beer please. He returned with some beer and a Dr. Pepper for Sock Monkey and then he proceeded to watch us chow down on pizza. We sat in the lobby for a while, watching other hikers check in, talking about our lives and then headed to our rooms. I jumped into the tub, watched a little tv and went to sleep. 23 miles today and excited about the two days of rest.","Campsite at mile 1003.1

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651883,"Breakfast at the hotel started at 0630. I was up at 0615 and walked down the hallway to the breakfast area. Coffee, waffles, breakfast sandwiches, muffins, fruit, orange juice and oatmeal. All you could ask for…..except maybe some bacon. I sat with Sock Monkey and we talked about the day. We wanted to walk to the outfitters which would also take us through the historical area of Harpers Ferry. Viking had been at the outfitters yesterday so we talked with him and he said we could do our resupply there. So the three of us walked through the historical area taking copious amounts of pictures and made it to the outfitters. We did our resupply and immediately began thinking about lunch. We passed by the Visitors Center and went inside so Viking could get his picture and new tag number. Lightfoot was there and he had just finished all the sections of the AT! I gave him a fist bump and asked him what was next for him. He smiled and said take a shower every day. We laughed and then he left with his buddy. We walked back to the hotel and agreed to meet later for a trip to Walmart. Viking got us a shuttle and we were just getting ready to head out when Reality Check showed up. She climbed in with us and we headed to Walmart. I grabbed a meat and cheese platter for lunch as well as a few other little items that I probably didn’t need plus some beer. We headed back to the hotel and everyone went to their rooms. I climbed into the tub and ate half of the meat and cheese platter. Afterwards I hung up my tarp outside, which was still wet, to let it dry and then hung out in the lobby with Sock Monkey, Viking and Ice. We talked about different things, while I iced my knee, and then decided it was time for dinner. We ordered food, pizza and calzones, ate in the lobby then went our separate ways. I got into the tub, again, read a book on my phone and then climbed into bed. I watched a little of the Celtics game and then off to sleep.

Then I went back to my room and organized some of my gear. Sock Monkey needed to go to the Post Office and also the outfitters because he cracked his filter. So we walked to the post office and I sent some clothes that I wasn’t wearing to my buddy Rick’s place. Ice, who was tagging along, got us a ride to the outfitters with Bonzo who had done the AT in 1995. We got to the outfitters early so we went and got some coffee. Back to the outfitters and then back to the hotel. I went to my room, jumped into the bathtub and ate the rest of my meat and cheese platter as well as the rest of my calzone. I hung out in my room for a while and then it was time for dinner. Ice, Sock Monkey, Reality Check and I ordered delivery and ate out in the lobby. I got a medium meat lovers pizza. Outstanding.

Sock Monkey was up too so we ate breakfast and listened to the weather. Possible thunderstorms during the day. Nice. I went back to my room, checked to make sure I had everything, said my goodbyes and headed out to the trail. It was a great stay at the hotel and the staff there was amazing. Everyone was very nice. I got on the trail just after 0600 and after about 15 minutes in the woods, the trail takes you right through historic Harpers Ferry. Even though I had walked through the area twice I still spent time taking pictures. I got on the foot bridge that takes you over the Potomac River and just like that I was in Maryland. This section of the trail was very flat and very smooth. My body felt rested but it still took a little time for everything to warm up. I saw two deer go running through the woods and also some animal, maybe a groundhog, running along some rocks. I came to the end of the smooth trail, crossed over US Route 340 and started a little climb. The climb ended at Weverton Cliffs where there was a view of the Potomac River. As I continued on, I started to hear some thunder off in the distance. I was hoping it stayed off in the distance. A few minutes later the wind started to pick up so I stopped and put on my rain jacket. Five minutes later it started to rain heavily. Five minutes after that I was soaked and the trail had turned into a river and occasional lake. I was resigned to being wet so I just kept hiking. I saw some lightning and heard some cool thunder but nothing too close to me. After about an hour of continuous rain, the thunderstorms moved off to the northeast. Around 1300 I got to Washington Monument State Park and stopped for lunch. I tried to eat quickly because I was still a little wet and I didn’t want to start getting cold. The park has the original Washington Monument, which was cool to see, and there was a great view from the site. I continued on and the rest of the hike consisted of some mild climbs as well as some long descents. I stopped at a creek about .2 miles from the campsite to fill up my bottles and then headed to the site. I got to Pogo Memorial Campsite around 1600 and spent some time looking for a place to hang my hammock. I found a site, put up my hammock, made some dinner and then hung my food bag.

I was determined not to rush myself so I took my time packing up and ate a honey bun, a Snickers bar and a Cliff bar. I was on the trail just before 0700. The sun was out and the sunlight was filtering through the trees. It was going to be a beautiful day. Today I was going to cross over the Mason-Dixon Line and enter Pennsylvania. After being in Virginia for so long, it feels weird being in West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania so quickly. The trail was very rocky, at times, but at least most of them weren’t wet. I got to Little Antietam Creek and stopped for breakfast. Then a little climb up to High Rock Ledges. An interesting spot. A great view up on top of a huge rock that was covered in graffiti. It seemed like a popular spot for the locals. I then started a descent that took me to Pen Mar Park with more outstanding views. I stopped to sit on a bench and have lunch. There was a trash can so I tossed my trash. I also noticed that around the corner they were having trail magic. So I walked over and ate a couple sandwiches, a couple bags of chips, some fruit and two beers. Feeling full, I grabbed some water from a water fountain and headed out. Not shortly afterwards, I crossed over into Pennsylvania. The trail followed a gentle descent and I came to PA Route 16 which had more trail magic. Viking, who I met in Harpers Ferry was there and I was happy to see him. Kim, a former loadmaster for the Air Force, made me two hot dogs and we talked about the airplanes. I drank two sodas and then Viking and I headed out. He had about an hour to the next shelter and I had about two and a half. Viking has two young men so we talked about our boys, that are no longer boys, and got to the shelter in no time. We exchanged cell numbers and I continued to the next shelter.

I was a little bummed because if I had gotten up earlier i would have seen a sunrise. The trail descended, crossed a couple of roads and then I came out to trail magic. Chris and Marie had just arrived so I helped them set up and then ate almost one of everything they had plus some orange juice. I thanked them and continued up trail. More climbs and then a descent to US Route 30. I needed to resupply and there was a Dollar General 2.5 miles away so I headed down the road and tried my hand, see what I did there, at hitchhiking. No luck.  I passed a church and an older woman waved me over to her car. She handed me two pieces of paper with some scripture on them and then drove away. I got about 200 yards from the Dollar General and a car pulled over with a couple in it offering me a ride. I thanked them but told them where I was going. They wished me luck and drove away. I got my resupply. Ate some food outside the store in the shade and then headed back down the road. It was just after 1100 and there was a new BBQ place called 65 South BBQ about .8 of a mile from the trailhead. They opened at noon so I thought I would stop there for lunch. They were open when I got there around 1145 so I went in, ordered a pulled pork sandwich and some baked beans with a Gatorade. The food was outstanding and I almost ordered more but I wanted to get back on trail. I talked with the owner for a minute. They had only been open for three weeks and were continuously running out of food. Sounded like a good problem. I thanked him and headed to the trail. About .5 miles down the trail I entered Caledonia State Park. It was a madhouse with people all over the place due to Memorial Day Weekend and strangely uncomfortable. I crossed over a bridge and started another climb. The rest of the day was some climbs and descents with little views. I crossed over the halfway point and now the miles to go are now lower than the miles completed. Very cool. I passed by the tentsite that I was planning on staying at but luckily checked my phone since I knew I was close. I backed up and found the side trail leading to the site.

The trail was pretty mellow to start off and I passed another halfway marker. There are several on the trail since the distance changes frequently. Around 0800 I came to a blue blaze for Sunset Cliffs. There was no information on the FarOut app but I figured I’d give it a try. A huge climb led to a sign that said “View.” The view was of trees. I climbed some rocks and was able to see some more trees through a opening in the trees. Oh well, it was worth a try. I got back on trail and got to Pine Grove Furnace Store around 0845. Apparently they open at 0800 on Memorial Day. I went in, ordered two breakfast sandwiches and grabbed a coffee. I ate breakfast while listening to a hiker talk about the trail. He had some good information. I wished him luck and headed out. The trail took me through the park, filled with people, and then led me to a wide and flat trail. I passed some day hikers and then started a climb. My next stop was going to be Green Mountain General Store about 8.6 miles away for lunch. The trail continued to be pretty mellow and I got to the store around 1230. I ordered a Club sub and bought two Gatorades, a large bag of chips and a bag of M&M’s. I sat outside and ate my lunch while talking with Chef who was just getting ready to leave. I went back inside and got a Dr. Pepper, drank that and got back on trail. That’s when I got smacked in the face. The trail started a big climb and then I was climbing over, under and around massive rocks. I think that Pennsylvania was trying to show off a little bit. After the rock scramble, the trail continued with some impressive climbs followed by big descents. My final stop of the day was going to be at Backpacker Camp which was .1 mile outside of Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania. That was the plan if I survived this last part of the trail. Water in this stretch of the trail is scarce so I stopped at a well flowing creek and filled up my bottles. I talked with a section hiker who had stayed at the campsite I was heading too and he told me that it is right next to the train tracks. So be prepared. Should be exciting. Along the way I found a phone sitting on a log. I grabbed it and then tried to figure out what to do with it. I got to the top of Center Point Knob, another halfway marker, and ran into three day hikers. I gave the phone to them and they were going to drop it off in town at the ATC center. I got to the camp around 1715, set up camp and walked into town. Several restaurants were closed but I found a pizza place. I ate a meat lovers pizza and then headed back to camp. Skol and Hot Tea, who I had met in Front Royal, were going to walk to a gas station to get some beer and asked if I wanted to join them. So out we went for a four mile round trip walk to get beer. The trip there was uneventful however the walk back in the dark next to a busy road was exciting. Several times I thought we were going to have to dive over the rail to avoid being hit. We made it safely back and exchanged some beers and then I climbed into my hammock. There is supposed to be a meteor shower tonight sometime around 1145 so we’re going to get up/wait for that event.

I went to the gas station across the street and got a breakfast sandwich and a coffee. Just before 0700 I got back on trail. I had about a .5 mile road walk and then a sharp left turn into the woods. Immediately it looked like there was a deer on the trail about 75 yards from me. It ran off into the woods but left it’s fawn struggling on the trail. It walked off the trail and then just stood there. I walked along the trail and was about two feet from the fawn. I took a picture and moved along. Kinda cool. The trail today had a lot of farm hiking which is hiking in big fields with tall grass and a little trail. Then it would go back into the woods. I saw something up ahead and it moved off trail but I could still see it. It was black and had a long tail. I slowed down and when I got closer I realized it was a cat. No collar but looked well fed and very friendly. I petted it for a while and moved along. Then I came upon a turtle in the middle of the trail. It had some beautiful red, green and yellow colors. I hiked along and then came to a road with some trail magic. A cooler with peanut butter cookies, waters, Gatorade and some peanut butter containers. I ate some cookies and drank a Gatorade. Very nice. The trail came along some more farm field hiking then into the woods and along a river. I ran into EF Hutton who I had seen at the cooler earlier and we talked for a bit. He set off and I followed. He was slack packing which meant he had a lighter pack on for the day. He set a quick pace and I had to really push to keep up. He was 70 years old and had a great history. He has currently run half-marathons in 43 states. He also ran the 100, 200 and 400 meter races for the Senior Olympics. He is a stud and I enjoyed listening to his stories.

I was heading to Duncannon to stay at the famous Doyle Hotel for the night. I had a little over eight miles to go. The trail had a couple of good climbs and started to become very rocky. I came to Hawk Rock which had a beautiful view of Duncannon and started the descent into town. I had a little bit of a road walk and got to the Doyle just before 1600. I got a room, ate some lunch, took a shower and I am now heading back down for another meal. Body was a little tired today probably from four hours of sleep and not a lot of food during the day.

Coach, a section hiker from Wales who I met on the trail yesterday, was sitting at the bar with Bimble, a gentleman from England. It was interesting listening to them talk. We shared some of our experiences on the trail and then I went up to my room. This morning when I woke up, I packed everything up and walked down the stairs from the third floor. At the bottom of the stairs was a door that was locked. Hummmm, I went back up to the second floor to see if there was another way to exit. I opened a door that took you out to a balcony. It wrapped around the hotel so I propped the door open with a chair and checked to see if I could get out from the side of the building. When you followed the balcony around the corner there were stairs that led to the backyard. I went back, closed the door and made it down to the street. Interesting. The trail went right through the residential area of Duncannon and then brought me out to a bridge that crossed over the Juniata River and then you cross over the Susquehanna River. There is a term called silver blazing. This refers to, usually the first hiker of the morning, who walks through all of the spider webs. Since I am up early this usually happens to me. I’m constantly wiping my face and shaking out my hat because of the webs. Today was next level. I don’t know what kind of spiders live on that bridge but the webs were impressive. Once I wiped my face and shook out my hat, I hiked into the woods and started a long climb. Once at the top there was some rock scrambles which definitely woke me up and a couple of nice views of the Susquehanna River. The trail stayed along the ridge line but remained relatively flat. I came to a spot with a nice view of Duncannon so I stopped for breakfast. It was going to be another hot day so keeping an eye on water sources would be important. I finished breakfast and continued on the trail. Pennsylvania is called Rocksylvania due to the large amount of rocks on the trail. It was definitely that way today. The trail was mellow but the rocks made you really pay attention. After a while, I came to Kinter View, which was a view to the south of a mountain with trees on it. Not overly impressive. It was in the shade so I stopped and had lunch. Afterwards, I back on trail and in need of water. There was a creek 3.4 miles further on so I kept my fingers crossed. Sometimes a water source can be dried up. I read in the comments on FarOut that there was a flowing brook just past the road crossing so that was where I was headed. I made it to the brook and ran into East Wind. He is an 83 year old man who I met yesterday and he is section hiking. He had had some heat issues yesterday and some other hikers had given him water. Coach ran into him on the descent into Duncannon and carried his pack down to the parking lot. Today he had hiked up the mountain, stopped to rest and proceeded to hike back down the wrong way. He was waiting for a friend of his to pick him up. After I told him I had hiked the wrong way for 20 minutes I asked him if he had enough water. He said he was fine so after I drank a liter of water I headed up the mountain. I knew I had another water source coming up so I planned on filling up all my bottles then. The app said there was water at the campsite but I wasn’t convinced. After a long but not too steep climb the trail leveled out and I got to the water source. I filled up my bottles and moved onward. I passed two hikers, one who said he was going to the same site as me. I got to the campsite just after 1600. I set up camp and started to cook dinner. By the way, there was no water around the site. Smooth, who was the hiker staying here tonight showed up with no water. He was not very happy when I told him. I offered him a liter and he took most of it, thanked me and then headed down trail to a shelter 4.6 miles away. I ate dinner, hung my food bag and climbed into my hammock.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652390,"Last night I hung up my tarp but did not set it up. Lightning and thunder woke me up around 2315. I climbed out of my hammock, set up my tarp and climbed back into my hammock. About 15 minutes later it began to pour. All good. I feel right back to sleep but for the first time on trail I did not sleep well due to dreams. From what I can remember, they were all about food. Too funny. The rain stopped right around 0515 and I broke down camp and got back on trail. Other than all of the rocks, the trail has been pretty mellow in regards to big climbs. I read something in the app that we will not get above 2000 feet until Connecticut. The first big challenge of the day was trying to hike through Stoney Creek which has been flooded due to beaver activity. It was a very cool area but there were some sections that you got your feet wet. I stepped on a log that sank and I almost went into the water. I managed to maintain my balance but my right foot did get wet. After that experience, I caught up with Roller who I had met yesterday. I had to yell to him because he was headed down the wrong trail. Happens to me all the time. The trail started a long climb and then there was some ridge hiking. I crossed a road and Booray was at the parking lot giving out drinks. I had a Powerade and we talked about disc golf. He had recently retired and couldn’t play golf every day so he picked up disc golf. I thanked him for the drink and he told me about a water source coming up and also a trash can! I got to the trash can and Macho Man, who I also met yesterday was having lunch. He walked by me earlier when I was having breakfast. Roller showed up and we discussed our love for the trash can. There was a big climb coming up but first we passed under Interstate 81. 936 feet in .8 miles and the trail leveled off. There was a nice lookout with a big view so I stopped and had lunch. Macho Man showed up just as I was packing up and he told me that rain was expected later. The trail was smooth and flat and I was able to get a good pace. Right around 1500 it began to pour. It rained for about 20 minutes and during that time I had to take a side trail to load up on water since there was none at the campsite. Immediately afterwards the trail turned into a rock scramble. Wet rocks are not fun and there were a lot of them. I stepped on 3 different rocks that were twice the size of me and they all moved. My pace had slowed down considerably. I was slipping a lot and I was trying to focus on the rocks, follow the trail, watch out for the branches and climb over massive tree trunks that had blown down earlier. This was probably the hardest section I have been on so far. Rockslyvania was definitely representing. I finally made it to the campsite but it had started to rain again. I started to set up my tarp and it started to rain harder. I was laughing because my hands were cold, making it difficult to set up the tarp, and the more I worked on the tarp the harder it rained. With the tarp finally set up, I changed into some dry clothes and then set up the rest of my gear. I cooked dinner under my tarp and then it stopped raining. I hung my food bag and climbed into my hammock. A great day. 25 miles. I am planning on getting to Port Clinton tomorrow.","Yellow Springs Campsite

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652500,"Today was a great day! I got up at my usual time and was on the trail around 0600. I had gone about 20 minutes, scrambling on some rocks when I met up with a hiker going the opposite way. We talked for a while and then he said, “I’m going to Port Clinton!” I asked him which way he was going and he said North. I then realized I had been hiking the wrong way for 20 minutes. Seeing that I was not too happy, Matt let me go ahead. I am my worst critic and I stewed on my mistake for a while. I passed the campsite that I had stayed at the night before and I was still thinking about my mistake. I tried to take a couple of deep breaths and then about 20 minutes later I got to a nice view. I took some time to calm down and then headed down the trail. The trail has not been too difficult lately with some climbs and a lot of flat. There have definitely been sections with a lot of rocks but not too long. I made my way to a road crossing and still a little bummed about the start of the day when I met up with Booray and Crunch. Booray had given out trail magic the day before and Crunch was a thru-hiker I had met in Harpers Ferry. We talked for a while as I guzzled a Gatorade and then Crunch and I headed out. Crunch, from Switzerland, has done the PCT and the CDT. He left from Amicalola Falls on April 11th. We hiked at about the same pace so we stuck together during the day. I let him lead and I was able to keep up v with his pace. My plan had been to get to Port Clinton, do a resupply and maybe stay the night. However, everything was booked and we were moving pretty well. We got to Port Clinton just before 1400 and headed to the Walmart. After going the wrong way two times, with Crunch leading, we had to make a one mile road walk on a very busy highway. I had to keep my head down as the 18 wheelers went by so my hat wouldn’t blow off. We made it to Walmart and we spent the next four hours shopping, eating and reorganizing our packs. During that time I ate a bag of chicken tenders, a bag of potato wedges, a 12 inch meat and cheese hoagie, a container of potato salad, a container of fruit and a large bag of peanut M&M’s. I also drank a Powerade and two Gatorades. Not to mention the drink I had while shopping. We hung out outside the Walmart and several people stopped to talk to us. It was very cool. I even had a woman stop and ask if I needed a ride into town. I declined because Booray had shown up and was shuttling hikers in and out of town. Both Crunch and I had bought way too much food but that’s what happens when you resupply when you are hungry. After four hours at Walmart, Booray gave us a ride back to the trail head and Crunch and I headed up the mountain. When we got to the top there was a guy, Doug, who was barefooted and wearing a life vest. Apparently he jumps into the river and then runs up the mountain to dry off. You can’t make this stuff up. I had just a little bit of mileage left before I got to my campsite. We stopped at a creek to grab some water and then I got to my site. Crunch was heading onto another site so we talked about meeting the next day since I get up earlier. A long day but a good one. 25.3 miles","Campsite at mile 1199.3

I climbed out of the hammock around 0530 and was back on trail around 0600. I had slept great and made sure I was heading in the right direction. About three miles into the hike I made it to Pulpit Rock with great views to the East. After another two miles I made it to The Pinnacle. Booray had told us that there would be a big pile of rocks that started when a trail maintenance person had put up a sign that asked people to leave a rock in honor of all the people working on the trail. The pile was massive. There was a great view to the East so I stopped for breakfast. There have been a lot of comments on the FarOut app talking about snakes so I made sure I picked a good spot to sit. As I was eating breakfast Crunch showed up. We talked for a while and then he headed down trail to get to a water source. I finished my breakfast and got back on trail after adding a rock to the pile. I got to the water source and Crunch was hanging out with Costco. I went and got some water and then gave Costco a bad time because he had lost his water filter. Not good. Crunch lent him his filter so he could get some water. Crunch and I headed out together, with him leading the way, and we had pretty much the same terrain. Some flat areas with some climbs and some areas with rocks. We stopped at a shelter for lunch and met a section hiker named Ireland. A German named Ireland. Very interesting. Crunch and I headed on with the goal of getting to Thunderhead Lodge to have some beers….and dinner. We made it to the Lodge around 1600 and proceeded to drink many beers and water. I ordered Wings and a Cobb Salad, which were outstanding. While we were eating and drinking, Reality Check showed up. Amazing. She ordered some food and we talked about the trail. Crunch and Reality Check talked a lot about the PCT and the CDT and I listened to their adventures. We paid our bills, which was expensive but worth it, and headed back on trail. Reality Check lead the way and I stayed at her pace for about 20 minutes and then I dropped out. The trail became very rocky and after the beers I was trying to stay focused on not killing myself. I got to a section of the trail called Knifes Edge and I really had to focus on not falling. I made it through the section and had about .7 miles to my campsite. I got to Bear Rocks, .1 miles from my campsite, and Crunch was hanging out enjoying the view. Apparently he got left in Reality Check’s dust too. We hung out for a while and then moved up the trail. We got to my site and I was so happy to be there. Crunch moved on and I set up camp. Another great day and going to try to get another big day in tomorrow.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652547,"My campsite was very cool and I slept well. I was on trail by 0600 and ready for a big day. I wanted to get to a campsite 30 miles away which would give me just under 17 miles to get into Delaware Water Gap on Monday.  I was on trail for about 30 minutes when I got to Bake Oven Knob. Great view but the rocks had graffiti on them. I moved on and then about two hours later I crossed a road a found trail magic. Someone had left a cooler with water. I filled up a bottle and continued up the trail. Speaking of trail, it was full of rocks most of the day. Ok, I lied, the whole day. It was pretty tough to keep looking down and also try to stay on the trail. Sometimes there would be soft dirt but that was the exception. Large rocks, medium rocks and small rocks. It was not fun. Around 1100 I was on trail and it looked like the trail hadn’t been used so I checked FarOut and it showed me off trail. So I turned around and walked about 50 yards and then saw a white blaze for someone heading South. I turned back around and headed back. About that time I ran into two day hikers who said that they had talked to two other hikers having the same issue. Apparently today was the first day that a new route was being used and obviously had not been changed on FarOut. I continued on and ran into another hiker who said that there was trail magic about two miles ahead at the road crossing. I got there quickly and had two hotdogs, three Dr. Pepper, a bag of chips, two bags of cookies, and a cupcake like item. Thanks to Frank and Mark for their kindness. Crunch was there and he headed out before me. When I left, I started a big climb. The trail leveled out but remained rocky. Not my favorite. I came to another road and crossed over the Lehigh River. Then came a big climb that included some serious rock scrambling that forced me climb over large rocks. Kinda cool. I made it to the top of Blue Mountain Ridge and continued with the rock hiking. I got to the campsite just before 1700. Thomas was there who I had met at one of the waysides in the Shenandoahs. James, from NY, was also there. We talked while Thomas and I made dinner. Crunch showed up and took a break. He was planning on going a little further to lessen his miles into town. Big day today with 30 miles and my feet are a little sore.

The plan was to hike into Delaware Water Gap and stay the night at The Deer Head Inn. Counting today, I have been on trail 11 days. I think it’s time for a rest. Rick got me a room for the night, thanks Rick, and I’m going to see if I can stay another night and take a zero on Tuesday. The trail has been absolutely brutal the last two days and my feet need a rest. The trail did not change from the last two days. I had to laugh because otherwise I would start crying. It was just a trail full of rocks. To make matters worse, the water sources were all dried up and the only place to get water was at the shelters. I had maybe a quarter of a liter of water and the next shelter was 10.3 miles away. Not a big deal but I had been rationing my water since yesterday. The trail descended to Wind Gap and then started a climb up to Wolf Rocks which was a large boulder scramble. It was actually kind of fun and a lot better than the small rocks on the trail. I made it to Kirkridge Shelter where there were four section hikers hanging out. I got directions to the water, which was a spigot, and that was nice. The section hikers headed out and I had breakfast. I had gone 10 miles in three hours so I took my time. Thomas showed up and he went to get water. We talked for a while and I asked him if he was fine with me hiking the 6.7 miles into town with him. All good. I let him set the pace and we got into town, after a pretty mellow trail, around 1230. The trail went right by the Deer Head Inn so I said goodbye to Thomas and called Mary, the owner, to see if I could check in early. She called me right back and checked me into my room. The room was available for tomorrow night so it looks like I’m taking a zero. I went up to my room and took a shower. When I got out there was a text from Crunch saying he was at the bakery. I walked down, ordered lunch and sat with Crunch and James, from last night. Songbird and Bushwack joined us and they talked about Pennsylvania. Not big fans. Thomas came by and grabbed an apple pie. Crunch and I walked over to the Sycamore Grill, had some more food and a couple of beers. Kat, behind the bar, was great and told us about happy hour and music later.

I hustled out of the room excited since I hadn’t had Dunks for a while. My feet were still super sore so I sort of waddled to Dunks. I ordered a large coffee and two sausage egg and cheese sandwiches on an everything bagel. They were outstanding. I was still hungry so I ordered a small box of Munchkins and ate those. So good. I still needed to do a resupply so I walked over to the gas station next door and looked around. I wasn’t too impressed with the selections so I went to the gas station across the street. They had a much better selection so I grabbed enough stuff for about two and a half days. There were going to be some places to stop to get food on trail and that seemed sufficient. I then went to the outfitter store and hung out outside, called my Dad, and waited until they opened at 1000. I needed a new fuel canister and a couple tent stakes. The fuel canister at the gas station was $12.99. At the outfitter store, the same canister,  was $6.99. Hummmmm. I made my way back to the room and started organizing my stuff. Crunch swung by my room to say goodbye as he was heading out. I may see him later but he does some big miles so maybe not for a while. I enjoyed hanging out with him. I was starting to get hungry again so I headed down to the pizza place and ordered a meat lovers and some beer.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652690,"What an incredible day! My alarm went off at 0500 but it was still a little dark outside so I reset for 0530. Up at 0530 and out the door at 0600. The hotel is right on the AT so as soon as I stepped off the porch I was back on the AT. There were three other hikers that were walking by so we all headed down the road. This section took us along Interstate 80 and across the Delaware River. Halfway across I entered New Jersey. My feet were still a little sore and I was worried that it would be an issue as I hiked during the day. After crossing over the river the trail took me along the Kittatinney Point Visitors Center and then I passed under Interstate 80 to the Dunnfield Creek Trailhead. Then a little climb to get me back into the woods. The trail was already better than the last two days I was on trail. Still some rocks but not as bad. I had a blister on the ball of my right foot and a blister on the ball of my left foot that reached between my big toe and the toe next to it. As I hiked, I tried not to let the rocks hit those areas. At one point during a climb I felt a huge pain on my left foot. The blister had broken which actually made it feel better afterwards. I came to Sunfish Pond, a 41 acre glacial pond and one of the seven natural wonders of New Jersey. It has an acidic composition and only a few types of fish can survive in the water. It was very cool and the path around the pond had a little bit of rock scrambles. I continued on and came to a water source. Smokey Joe was there and we talked as I grabbed some water. I knew a big view was coming up so I planned on having breakfast there. I climbed to Raccoon Ridge where there 360 degree views. It was the first big view in a while and a great place to stop and eat. While I was hanging out, String Bean and Stick, two young and skinny men stopped and we talked for a while. I finished and headed down the trail. I stayed on the ridge and the views were awesome. I came to the Catfish Fire Tower and once again had a great view. I had been on trail for almost four hours and New Jersey already had more big views than all of Pennsylvania. I came to Beaver Pond which was really cool due to the beaver dam and all the different noises. I passed by Crater Lake and then Hemlock Lake. My feet were finally starting to warm up and the trail was mostly smooth. I found a short trail that led to some rocks and another view to the Northwest. I stopped and ate lunch. Heading back down the trail afterwards, I came to a stream and met Cider, who was flip flopping. He started in Harpers Ferry hiking North to Katahdin and then he will get back to Harpers Ferry and hike South to Springer. He mentioned a place called Gyp’s that was only .1 miles off trail and there would be good food and beer. I had originally planned on hiking to the Brink Road Shelter but I was making good time, despite my feet, so I figured I’d give it a shot. I got to Brink Road Shelter, 24.9 miles from Delaware Water Gap, around 1500 so I figured I had plenty of time. I made it to Gyp’s just after 1600 and they were having issues with their propane so the only option for food was pizza. I was a little disappointed but ordered a pepperoni pizza and a beer. There was a deck out back that looked out over a lake. It was very cool and a place I could have easily gotten stuck. I finished my pizza, talked with Cider a little bit who had shown up after me and headed back on trail. My feet were a little sore after the rest but the trail wasn’t too bad and I had just over four miles to the shelter. Along the way I stopped and talked to Strut and Iron Heart, a couple that was also flip flopping, and enjoyed another big view at the Culver Fire Tower. I got to Green Anderson Shelter just after 1800, talked to James, who I met the night before Delaware Water Gap, and set up camp. I put my food bag in the bear box and climbed into my hammock.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652731,"My plan leaving Delaware Water Gap was to get to Bear Mountain State Park early on Sunday morning. That means I need to average 25 miles the next four days and then have a little over nine miles on Sunday morning. I was planning on doing 25 miles yesterday but ended up doing over 31 miles. So today I planned on getting to the “Secret Shelter” which was just over 18 miles. It started raining during the night and I woke up around 0520 with it still raining. I broke down camp under my tarp and just before taking down the tarp the rain stopped. I got on trail right at 0600. My feet were still feeling a little sore so I started out slowly. The trail had some rocks which didn’t help but It did smooth out on occasion. I had a little climb that took me to the top of Sunrise Mountain. Unfortunately not a very good view due to the fog. There was a little pavilion there with benches so I stopped for breakfast. Afterwards the trail stayed along the ridge line but would occasionally drop down into the valley and then climb back out. I got to some rock slabs along the ridge and proceeded to slip about five times in less than 30 feet. The rocks were wet and slippery. Two out of the five times I landed on my butt. One time I slid down the rock and my right knee got caught in a crack in the rock. Luckily I had stopped sliding so no damage done. I finally made it off the rock and continued down the trail. The weather was improving and so were the views. I ran into James who I had been seeing on the trail a lot recently. We talked for a moment and then moved onward. We both got to the High Point State Park Headquarters about the same time and got some water from the spigot. James went inside, looked around and came back saying they had some good snacks. I grabbed my money and went inside to check it out. All the snacks were 50% off so I grabbed a soda, a bag of pretzels, two bags of gummy bears and a bag of M&M’s. I told James about the deal and he went inside to get some stuff too. James headed out saying he was going to the observation tower a mile away, on trail, to have lunch. I told him I would see him there. I drank my soda, ate the pretzels and M&M’s and headed for the tower. I got there and joined James for lunch. A great view of the surrounding area and an awesome view of the 220 foot obelisk built in 1930 as a war memorial and observation tower. James and I were headed to the same shelter so we talked about that and then he headed out. I stayed a little while longer and then headed to the shelter. I arrived at the shelter just after 1400. The “Secret Shelter” is not an official AT shelter but a cabin on private land that is owned by a former thru-hiker. There is a spigot with potable water as well as a donkey, Jake, who keeps an eye on things. I took off my shoes to let my feet breathe a little and ate some more snacks. A couple other hikers showed up and Jake was loving life. I made dinner and then climbed into my hammock.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel, a large cinnamon bun, a chocolate covered donut and a large coffee. So good. Pretty soon afterwards Ken and James both arrived to grab breakfast. We ate our breakfasts and then I grabbed a little resupply. The owner was super nice and I thanked him for everything as I headed out. James was leaving too so we walked together along the road and got back on trail. The trail was pretty mellow to start as we walked through some pastures and then through Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. Very level ground and a very cool area. I found out that last night James officially received his trail name. He is now officially called Yams due to his love of sweet potatoes. So Yams and I crossed over the Pochuck Creek Bridge and entered the Pochuck Boardwalk which was a long walk on boards built to allow hikers to get over the wetlands. Very nice and easy on my feet. We came to a road crossing and left the trail to get to the hot dog stand. I went to the stand and Yams went across the street to the Creamery. I ordered two hot dogs, a bag of chips and a Coke. Mitch, the owner, came out and talked with me while I ate. The food was good and the conversation was interesting. I finished and headed over to the Creamery. I got a large walnut danish and a Gatorade and went to sit with Yams. Thomas, who I hadn’t seen for a few days showed up. He ate some food and then he and I headed out. Yams was not going as far as us so he stayed for a while longer. Thomas and I picked up the pace because we wanted to get to another hot dog stand and creamery before 1800. My feet were now starting to protest a little bit but I was able to keep up with Thomas. As easy as the morning was, the afternoon was tougher. However we did run into Jersey who did the AT last year and he was giving out breakfast sandwiches to thru-hikers. We both grabbed one, thanked him, placed the sandwiches in our pockets for later and got moving. We had some serious climbs with a lot of rock scrambles and we continued to keep a good pace. We also crossed into NY. Unbelievable. We got to the hot dog stand around 1730. We ordered three hot dogs apiece and a couple of sodas and ate while talking with Top, the owner.

My feet were being a little finicky so it was slow going to start. I came to Fitzgerald Falls where I stopped to grab some water. Lucky, who I had meet yesterday at the Creamery, came by and I started to hike behind him. He set a good pace and it helped to warm up my feet. The trail today was full of a lot of climbs and descents as well as some big rock scrambles. Lucky is from East Tennessee, been married almost 40 years and has two boys. We talked a lot, at least on the descents, and that made the miles go quickly. By 1000 we had done ten miles. We came to Elk Park and there was trail magic. We met Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal who had done the AT in 2020. Lucky and I had two hot dogs, two Dr. Peppers and various other treats. We sat for about an hour and headed out. We had a big climb right after that and started to run into a lot of day hikers. We stopped and talked to several of them. We had some more climbs, saw some cool views and then the Lemon Squeezer. You had to pass through a crevasse between two very large boulders with barely enough room for you and your pack and then climb up a very steep boulder. Afterward, we had to cross over the Palisades Interstate Parkway. The ATC encourages that you take the detour trail since last year a hiker was killed while attempting to cross this very busy Parkway. Lucky and I decided to bypass the detour. We made it safely and moved on to more climbs and descents. We then passed the 1400 mile mark. Amazing. We made it to the trail for the West Mountain Shelter but according to the app, the shelter was 1.3 miles down the side trail. We both agreed we were not doing that. We continued to hike and found a nice spot to set up camp for the night. We set up our stuff, cooked dinner and hung our food bags. We found a rock to sit on and watch the sunset.

We were able to see the tower on top of Bear Mountain and knew that was where we were heading. We had a couple more climbs with some stone stairs and a little bit of dirt road walking and then we arrived at the Bear Mountain Recreation Area. There were some great views and we stopped at a vending machine to drink a Coke. Then we started a long descent down to the Bear Mountain Inn. It was a very pretty area with the Inn right next to Hessian Lake. Being a Sunday, there were a lot of people setting up their bbq’s and bringing in large amounts of food. We got to the Inn just after 0800 and made our way to the Hiker Cafe. We ran into Reality Check, grabbed some breakfast and made ourselves comfortable. Ryan would be showing up around 1100 so we had time to charge our phones and battery packs. Reality Check headed out and Lucky decided he was going to stay in town. Ryan got there just after 1100 and it was great to see him. Ryan, Lucky and I jumped into the Jeep and we headed into town for lunch. We ate at the Hacienda restaurant and then took Lucky to his hotel. They offered free laundry so we all hung out in the lobby and watched the College World Series while our clothes were being washed. After the clothes were clean, Ryan and I went to Walgreens for some foot care items and beer. We also stopped at the local pizza place and got two large pizzas. Back to the Inn and I took a shower and worked on my feet. Ryan and I enjoyed hanging out and Lucky and I will be back on trail tomorrow morning. Great day! 5.3 miles","Campsite at mile 1401.3

The room we had was great and it was awesome to hang out with Ryan. I got up around 0500 and packed up my stuff. I told Lucky that I would pick him up at his hotel at 0630. I planned on stopping at Dunkin Donuts for coffee and a breakfast sandwich however due to traffic laws and the police officer sitting in his car I was unable to make that happen. I was able to get something to eat at Lucky’s hotel so all was good. We got back to the Inn and I went back up to the room to grab my pack and say goodbye to Ryan. That was tough. I gave him a big hug and headed out. Lucky and I were not able to walk through the zoo, which has the lowest point on the AT, because it is not open during the week. We walked around the zoo and headed for the bridge which took us over the Hudson River. We saw Yams and his dad who had decided to hike with him for a while. The bridge walk was very cool with some fog and a tugboat pushing a ship up the Hudson. After we passed over the bridge we got back into the woods and had an immediate climb. Lucky and I wanted to get to the Appalachian Market where we planned to eat and grab a resupply. We made it to the market and I had a bowl of fruit, a large danish and a Gatorade. Lucky and I also ordered subs to take with us to eat for lunch. The rest of the day was mostly big climbs with some descents. We actually joked about how the trail was set up today. A lot of ups and downs. Our goal was to get to Canopus Lake Beach Shelter so that we could soak our feet and knees in the water. We got there just after 1600 and took off our shoes to wade into the lake. Blue Gill fish were coming up to our feet and nibbling on them. Kind of neat. We got out, dried our feet and unfortunately put our shoes back on our feet. We walked to the shelter, set up camp, made dinner, hung our food bags and climbed into our tent/hammock. We were both tired from the day and ready to relax. A good mileage day and we are starting to talk more about finishing this hike. 21.1 miles today and another deli tomorrow.","Bear Mountain Inn

Our first planned stop was the Mountaintop Deli where we were planning on having some breakfast sandwiches. We got to the deli just before 1000, celebrating our 10 miles before ten o’clock, and ordered a couple of breakfast wraps along with a couple of deli sandwiches to pack out. We sat outside the store and drank some sodas and Gatorades while we ate some Drake pastries just filled with calories. The one I had was 520 calories. We grabbed our sandwiches, thanked our server and got back on trail. Along the way, we ran into Reality Check who was also heading to the deli. We talked for a little bit and went our separate ways. The rest of the day we were mostly in the forest with small climbs and small descents. We stopped at the Morgan Stewart Shelter for a snack and then made our final push to the Telephone Pioneers Shelter. We actually stopped .1 mile from the shelter at a campsite that was right next to a creek. We ate our deli sandwiches, talked about our plan for tomorrow, which included another deli, hung our food bags and climbed into our tent/hammock. 21.7 miles today and I was a little tired.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653050,"Lucky and I both like to get up early, which is one of the many reasons we hike together. By 0515 we were breaking down camp and boiling some water for coffee. We got back on trail around 0545 and set our sites on  The Country Market which was 14 miles from us. We figured we could grab lunch and resupply if needed. Right away, we came to the Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the AT. The tree is estimated at over 300 years old and has a diameter of approximately 6 feet. Very cool. We descended into the valley and then hiked through some farm pastures. The grass was not that tall but the grass was wet which had our shoes soaked in a matter of a few minutes. The soaking actually made my feet feel better so I was pleased. After the pastures, we entered into the woods and then we began the Swamp River Boardwalk. The grass here was taller than both of us and at times I couldn’t even see Lucky in front of me. Now our shorts and shirts were getting a good soak. We were also navigating the boards that we were walking on to keep out of the wetlands. Some boards would sink when you walked on them so you had to be ready. It was a quarter of a mile walk but exciting. After the wetlands we were back into a cow pasture making sure we weren’t stepping into any cow pies. We hit 10 miles before ten o’clock and then crossed over into Connecticut. We also came across a several coolers at a road crossing. One had Gatorades in them and another had various snacks. Trail magic at its best. Thank you Chris! We got to the market just before 1200. We grabbed some food and drinks and ate lunch outside at a picnic table. We both grabbed food with high calories for lunch and then went back inside to grab Ben and Jerrys. My pint of ice cream was 1400 calories. Nice. Acoup, the owner, was very nice and she let us grab some water from the spigot. We had just over 7 miles left to the shelter and we headed out. It was a little toasty today and it was nice to get back into the shade of the woods. We came to a detour due to a bridge being out however comments on the app told us we could cross on rocks. We decided to push forward and the river crossing was uneventful. We got to a footbridge which took us over the Ten Mile River. The water was flowing very strongly and we stopped several times to check out the rapids. We then ran into a day hiker who told us we had a big climb ahead of us and then the trail would get “cushy”. Good scouting report and we got a nice view after the climb. We ran into Julia, who was a trail maintainer. We talked about the Gypsy Moths that were all over the trees. They were everywhere and you could actually hear them chewing on the leaves. She was not a big fan. We thanked her for all of her work and headed to the shelter. We got to the Mt. Algo Shelter just before 1600 and set up camp. We talked about the next couple of days and then cooked dinner. Hammock time. Good day. 21.6 miles today.","Campsite at mile 1449.4

We actually had to eat out of our food bags all day. Amazing. We had our usual early wake up and we both made some coffee. We got on trail around 0545. The weather looked like we could get some rain so we were trying to get as many miles in beforehand. About an hour into our hike, the rain began. Lucky and I had put our rain jackets on about five minutes beforehand so we were good to go. The rain only lasted for about 20 minutes but it did make the trail a little more difficult. We had some serious climbs today but we also had some very dangerous descents. We had one descent that went straight down and was mostly rocks. Due to the rain, the rocks were very slippery. I slipped several times where I thought I was going down. We were moving very slowly and cautiously. We finally made it down and the trail took us across a road and then another climb. We met a lot of day hikers that were going South and we stopped to talk to most of them. A lot of them were working on getting their legs in shape for the summer hiking season and some of them talked about doing the AT. We highly recommended they take the plunge. We came to a campsite and had lunch. The trail was starting to dry so hiking became a little easier. We made it to our campsite just after 1500 and set up camp. Lucky has a resupply box waiting for him at the post office in Falls Village so we are planning on getting breakfast in town before the post office opens. So excited!!

Rude, a flip flopper was sitting on one of the chairs in front of the restaurant and told us they were opening soon. We took off our packs and took a seat on the chairs outside. A few minutes later the door opened and in we went. All three of us ordered the breakfast burrito and I got myself a large coffee. The burrito was outstanding. Lucky left to get his supply box at the post office and I ordered French toast and a muffin. Lucky had a lot of stuff in his resupply box so he generously donated food to me. We loaded up our food bags and got back on trail. Rude left at the same time so for a while we were a party of three. We met Vince, a ridge runner, and spent some time talking about the trail. Very cool guy. The miles seemed to fly by today and before you knew it we were crossing a road and getting some trail magic. Ron was awesome and it was tough to leave all the food and the great conversation. We immediately started a long climb and then it started to rain. Not a big deal except we then had to go down St. John’s Ledges. Noted by some as the most difficult descent on the trail, it was made even worse by the rain. Lucky came upon another flip flopper who was sliding down some rocks. Lucky checked to make sure he was ok and we continued our descent. It was nerve racking and I was glad to get to the bottom. We passed into Massachusetts, which for me was a big deal. I have spent a lot of my life in this state and it is almost like a second home. We traveled through Sage’s Ravine where we followed along Sawmill Brook which was absolutely beautiful and had some impressive swimming holes.

Not a lot of miles.  We wanted to get to Great Barrington and see if we could find somewhere to stay for the night. We had some great views at Mt. Race Ledges but nothing when we got to the top of Mt. Race. Just trees. We had another long climb up Mt. Everet which took us to 2605 feet. First time we had been above 2000 feet in a long time. While we were on trail, we came upon a porcupine. He did not know we were there right away but when he did he swelled up and his quills were easy to see. He headed up a tree and we moved along. After we started another climb we came to a brutal descent called Jug End. Rocks were not wet but just as challenging as St. John’s. At the bottom we met some day hikers including Taters who had left some trail magic further down the trail. Beers and sodas with some snacks. When we got to the cooler, Lucky and I both enjoyed our breakfast beer. We hiked through a couple of pastures and then came out onto the road heading into Great Barrington. Lucky called Joe, a shuttle driver, and we got a ride to the community center where we were able to set up camp on the lawn for free. I had to go into the woods for a couple trees. Joe was great and gave us a tour of the town. He was strictly donation based and we appreciated his kindness. Lucky and I set up camp and then headed over to the Barrington Brewery. We both had burgers and fries with a beer. We were talking to two gentleman who were sitting next to me when their order of nachos came out. Lucky and I took one look at each other and ordered the nachos. The gentleman did not finish theirs but we sure finished ours! They were so impressed they bought Lucky and me a beer. Thank you! We walked over to the Price Chopper so that I could grab a resupply and then went back to camp to grab our dirty clothes. I had bought some banana bread slices so Lucky and I made short order of that. We spoke to the owner of the Travel Lodge next to us and he was ok with us using the laundry machines. A first for me was switching my dirty shorts for clean shorts right in the laundry room. While our clothes were in the washer we went over to the McDonald’s and ordered more food. I had the Double Quarter Pounder with cheese, a large order of fries, a ten piece chicken McNuggets and a large Dr. Pepper. We made our way back to the laundry room and put the clothes in the dryer. We sat in the lobby until our clothes were dry and headed back to our respective campsites. A good day of hiking and a great day of eating. The Center opens at 0700 and Lucky and I will be there so we can take a shower! We will eat breakfast and then get Joe to take us back to the trailhead.

I tried to sleep in but woke up just after 0500. I broke down camp and met Lucky by the pavilion. He was talking to Long Story who was the hiker that had been sliding down the descent at St. John’s. He was a little sore and thought he would go to one of the six dispensaries in Great Barrington to get some cream to rub on his lower back. Lucky and I headed to the McDonald’s to grab a coffee and a breakfast sandwich. Lucky had also bought a bag of chocolate donuts at Price Chopper so we made short order of them. The Community Center allows hikers to take a shower and use the facilities for an eight dollar fee so Lucky and I headed over to be there when they opened. A young woman opened the doors at 0700 and told us the staff had not arrived yet so she let us in for free and even gave each of us a towel. The hot shower was awesome and my feet were feeling great. We finished our showers and gave Joe a call to come pick us up. We made it back on trail by 0800. Massachusetts has a rule that you must camp at designated spots on the AT so due to our later start, we planned on hiking to the Shaker Campsite today, 17.7 miles, and then hike to the October Mountain Shelter tomorrow, 18.8, which would leave us just over 12 miles to Dalton and another day to relax and calorie up with my buddy, Rick. Today, as so eloquently put by Lucky, was a day of cruisie or grindy. We started with cruisie as the trail was pretty flat and very soft with a nice carpet of pine needles. Then it became grindy as we climbed up to the Ledges at an elevation of 1718 feet. Not very high but the climb was mostly straight up. I took a moment to call my Dad and wish him a Happy Father’s Day and Lucky called his wife, Missy. This is how most of the day went. The trail would be smooth and then we would have a climb straight up. Massachusetts has brought out a new variable on the trail. Roots. There are a lot of tree roots on the trail and it’s almost like the little rock’s from the state that will not be named. The weather today was a little cool. We had some very gusty winds and it was hard to believe it is mid June in Massachusetts. We also heard a lot of creaky trees with the gusty winds. We kept our heads on a swivel. We arrived at Shakers Campsite just after 1500 and set up camp. A lot of hikers here and we hung out as we cooked dinner. Two Braids is contemplating doing a blog so she interviewed Lucky and me about our advice for new hikers. We had fun with it and then it was time to climb into the hammock.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653366,"Today was a grind, not because of the mileage but because we had some arduous climbs. I counted 5 but I could be wrong. Every climb seemed to go straight up and none of them resulted in a big view. We did pass over the Mass Pike which was kind of cool. The trail was also a little rocky with a lot of roots. We both spent a lot of time looking at the ground. I’m glad that Lucky is leading so that all I have to do is follow his feet. He’s the one who has to look up for the white blazes. We did have one section where we entered a wetland and had to use a boardwalk to stay above the wetlands. We were laughing because the boardwalk was moving like the floor at a carnival funhouse. We survived and crossed over a road. In Massachusetts there have been times when we are hiking South. We continue to joke that the ATC is messing with us. We spend more time talking about finishing our hike and we continue to be amazed that we have hiked this far. We are also getting excited about the big climbs and views to come in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. We got to the October Mountain Shelter around 1400 and set up camp. We were both so tired we took naps. That’s a first for me on the trail. We got up, cooked and ate dinner and I climbed into my hammock.

Temperatures have been in the low 40’s which is unusual since it is mid June in Massachusetts. However, once you get moving it has been nice. We had a very eventful morning! About 20 minutes into our hike and right after crossing over a road, I had my weight on my left foot and my right foot got caught on a stick. Nowhere to go but down. I face planted and slammed my shin against a root. No real damage, just a little loss of skin. Lucky checked to see if I was ok and we moved along. About 15 minutes later we came out onto a dirt road. There was a man walking his dog behind us as we entered a parking area. I stopped to take a picture of a sign and I heard Lucky yell. I turned around and Lucky was holding his arm against his side because the dog had bit him. Yes, you read that correctly. Lucky had gotten bit by this dog. Luck had a bite mark on the side of his stomach and on the inside of his arm by his elbow. Luckily it looked like the dog had not broken the skin. The owner was very apologetic and gave us all the information on the dog including that fact that he was current on his rabies shots. We made sure Lucky was good and then we continued on our hike. We joked that if you made a list of 100 things that could happen to you on the AT, getting bit by a dog would not be on it! Lucky set a good pace as I continued to check on him. We arrived into Dalton just after 1000, as the trail took us right through the town, and called Rick. He showed up about 15 minutes later and it was great to see him. A quick note about Rick. He is possibly the kindest human being I have ever met and that’s saying something. We have know each other for almost 37 years and he has been there for me in some difficult times. So I really mean it when I say it was great to see him. Rick took us back to the hotel while Lucky and I ate all of the cookies that his Aunt had made for us. Both Lucky and I took showers while we ate the cookies that Marianne had made for us. Thanks Marianne! We headed out for lunch and made it to Patrick’s Pub.

We walked back to the hotel and went to sleep. Lucky and I were up at 0600. We packed up and then tried to figure out how we were going to get back to where we left the trail. Lucky tried Lyft but apparently there aren’t too many Lyft drivers up at 0600. So we did what hikers do and we walked. 2.6 miles later we were back where Rick picked us up. We had about a one mile road walk before we actually got back into the woods. We knew that we had two big climbs for the day but I don’t think we were ready for the other climbs during the day. It seemed like the whole day was about climbs. Of course, you can’t have climbs without some descents. We came to the road that had the Dollar General and the outfitters that we had gone to yesterday with Rick. The road also had a Dunkin Donuts which Lucky and I immediately veered towards. We both got breakfast sandwiches as well as donuts, munchkins and large coffees. Fortunately we did because immediately after we got back on trail we started our climb up to Mt. Greylock. Mt. Greylock is the highest peak in Massachusetts at an elevation of 3489 feet. We were not going to have the great views one would have on a nice day but we did stop at the Bascom Lodge when we got to the top. Momma Bird, who hiked the AT last year had trail magic set up in the lobby area. She had bananas and a variety of fruit bars. Very tasty. We grabbed a couple of beers to wash down the bars and then started our descent down off Mt. Greylock. We made it to Wilbur Clearing Shelter just after 1500 and set up camp.

We were excited about a nice hot breakfast when we popped out of the woods and began a half mile road walk to Route 2. Just before we got to Route 2 we found some trail magic. Someone had left a cooler with some sodas, hohos and such. We would have eaten more but we were saving our appetite for breakfast. We were almost there when I realized they didn’t open until 0800. It was just past 0700 and we weren’t going to wait an hour. We wished we had eaten more trail magic. We crossed over Route 2, then over a river and then walked right through someone’s driveway into the woods.

We had a couple of climbs and a couple of descents. The trail was, at times, very rocky and rooty. We had some wet rocks due to the rain but nothing too drastic.

There is a fire tower at the top which gave us a 360 degree view and allowed us to see four states. One of the best views we have had in a long time. We came down from the tower and started our descent through the Lye Brook Wilderness. We had a little bit of a dirt road walk and then another great view looking down onto Manchester Center.

The market did not have good resupply options so Danielle gave us the number for a shuttle into Rutland where there is a Price Chopper and a Walmart. Flipakey gave Lucky, me and Captain Jack a ride into town where we did our resupply. We ate a couple of chocolate eclairs, filled our food bags, discussed the weight of our food bags and then walked over to the bus station to see if we could take the bus back to the trailhead. No bus until later so we called Tom Plans Too Much to shuttle us back. When he dropped us off he told us we had a climb, then some flat, followed by another climb with a long flat and then a big climb up Mt. Killington. He couldn’t have been more accurate though he did forget to tell us we would be passing by the 500 miles to Katahdin sign. All of the climbs were very tough especially Mt. Killington which seemed to go on forever. When we got near the top it seemed like we were just going around and around like those soft ice cream cones. Killington topped out at 4235 feet. We finally started down to the shelter and due to our market and Price Chopper visits got into camp around 1930. We set up camp, got water and ate our Kerwin sandwiches which were outstanding. Into my hammock and sound asleep after a long day! 22.8 tough miles.","Bully Brook

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653833,Today was probably one of the most challenging days on the AT that Lucky and I have had in a long time. We were up and on trail at our usual time and started a small descent. After that we had probably seven or eight climbs throughout the day that were arduous at the least. It felt as if we were climbing up and then headed down every mountain in Vermont. Even getting to the shelter involved a big climb. We did have a bright spot when we got to Giffords Woods State Park. Lucky had to use the restroom and when he came out he asked if I had any quarters. Apparently there was a quarter operated shower in the restroom. 10 minutes for $1.00. We both took a shower and it was awesome. That lifted our spirits until we got to the next big climb and proceeded to sweat profusely. We came down off a mountain and crossed over Route 100 which was cool because I have run a race with friends called the 100 on 100. Brought back great memories. We finally made it to the Winturri Shelter. We were both beat so we quickly ate dinner and headed to bed. A tough day! 21.8 miles,"Churchill Scott Shelter

Lucky and I planned on doing just over 24 miles so that we could meet up with my friends, Drew and Bartlett in Norwich, Vermont. We were up earlier than usual and on trail by 0530. We had about the same amount of climbs today but the difference was that they weren’t so high in elevation. Still steep but not as long. We passed through several open fields and we had great weather. One field had about 12 cows on it and they looked at us like we were lunch or that we had lunch for them. Lucky has done a great job of keeping us on trail and I’ve told him that if he were to walk off a cliff I’d probably go right off with him. He has to hike and keep an eye out for the blazes. I just have to keep an eye on his shoes. We crossed over several roads which usually indicates a climb. After one road crossing we had trail magic. A cooler full of sodas. Lucky and I grabbed a Coke and chugged them down. Then a big climb. We passed a day hiker with his two very young boys, who were both holding their noses. Apparently he had told them how stinky thru-hikers can be on trail. He had hiked the AT in 2016 so he knew from experience. We got to the top and sat on a bench and enjoyed the view of several ski resorts and the peak of Mt. Killington. We had several more climbs then a descent down to Elm Street where Bartlett came to pick us up. It was great to see Drew and Bartlett and they treated us like kings. We had snacks and then pizza and beer. We stayed up later than we have since Mt. Bromley and then went to bed. A long day but well worth it.

I walked out back and down to the dock where I put my feet into the Connecticut River. I listened to some music from my playlist and soaked my feet for about 30 minutes. When I got back inside, Drew and Bartlett were in the process of cooking breakfast. Slow cooked scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, toast and coffee. Lucky came down and we enjoyed an awesome breakfast. Afterwards, Drew gave us a tour of the grounds and it was simply amazing. A very beautiful place and we were fortunate to have them let us be here with them. Drew lent us the truck and Lucky and I drove over to Stateline Sports to get our last pair of new shoes and some socks. We then headed over to Hanafords for a quick resupply and then back to the house to organize things and relax. We both took another shower and spent time napping and soaking our feet in Epsom salts. This has been a very relaxing and well needed rest for us both as we prepare for the final push. We could be done in around three more weeks and we are both amazed at the possibility. More relaxing for the rest of the day and then a nice surf and turf dinner before we get back on trail tomorrow.

We made it to Lou’s just before 0700 and sat down with Band Aid to eat breakfast. I had the hash with poached eggs, baked beans, a blueberry muffin and coffee. Lou’s also offers a free muffin or donut to thru-hikers so I had a maple cruller. We continued our road walk and eventually made a left turn behind the Dartmouth College Athletic fields and up into the woods. We started a climb, of course, up to Velvet Rocks which did not have a spectacular view but did have a scenic forest. We ran into several other hikers today including Punchline and Wild Flower. Punchline was heading South and he was looking forward to getting to Hanover. We continued on and came to a marsh with a boardwalk. Lucky stepped up on the stairs and then I stepped up on the stairs. I felt a sting on my knee and looked down. I immediately said two words! BEES and RUN! A swarm of bees was coming out from underneath the boardwalk. Lucky took off running and I followed suit as I was stung a couple of more times on my legs. We out ran the bee hoard and took sting inventory. Lucky, true to his name, had zero bee stings. Me, on the other hand, had one sting on my right knee and several others on my left leg. I felt like I was going to be ok, but just to be safe I took a Benadryl. Lucky checked on me several times as we moved on but no allergic reaction so all was well. We ran into Wild Flower and warned her about the bees and she told us about some trail magic up ahead in a cooler at a trailhead. We got there and each of us had a Coke. We began another climb up Moose Mountain South then a slight descent and then another climb up Moose Mountain North. Then the biggest climb of the day up to Holt’s Ledge. It was mostly straight up and lasted for about an hour. We finally made it to the top. Wiped our noses and began a descent to Trapper John Shelter. We arrived there around 1500 and set up camp.

Nothing more motivating during the day than knowing it would be ending with hot food and a couple of beers. Our first big climb was Lambert Ridge. New Hampshire was flexing it’s muscles by making us climb straight up. No switchbacks and no rest. It had rained earlier in the morning so we were not rewarded with any big views. The next big climb was Smarts Mountain. We met Flatlander who was from North Dakota. He had stopped, at the bottom of the mountain, to eat some breakfast before starting his climb. We talked for a while and then moved on. Once again, no switchbacks and we climbed up to 3237 feet. We finally got to the top where there is a fire lookout tower. Nothing to see but fog so we kept moving down the trail. We stopped at the Hexacuba Shelter to have some lunch and met Patience. We finished lunch and moved on to our last big climb of the day. Mt. Cube was not as high as Smarts Mountain but it was just as difficult. We got to the summit and met Boots. He was from Texas and was enjoying the amazing views. The weather had finally cleared up and you could see for miles in every direction. These were the views that made the climbs worthwhile. We started our long and steep climb down the mountain. We stopped at Brackett Brook to get some water and started back up the trail. Lucky was climbing up the bank when he slipped on a wet root. He started to fall backwards and I was right behind him. I grabbed his pack and he was able to get back on his feet. He leads and I’m his wingman. Crisis averted. We moved on and reached NH Route 25C. We made a left turn on the road and in .2 miles reached The Greenhouse. We were deciding what to do with our packs when Gary, the bartender, came out and told us that hikers weren’t allowed in the front door and that we had to go to the side door. He continued to yell at us as we moved to the side door telling us what food was not available. Lucky and I sat at the bar, with Flatlander, ordered two beers and an appetizer of jalapeño poppers which were outstanding. We both ordered the Deluxe burger with fries and another beer. Gary was great. He told us jokes and was very kind to the thru-hikers. He even told us we could camp out back on the lawn. Patience showed up and joined us at the bar. As is usually our tradition, Lucky and I ordered the nachos and another beer. We met Light Year, who was thru-hiking, but stopped to work at the Greenhouse for a week or so to earn some money. Lucky and I finished our food and as we were leaving, Gary yelled at us again. Something that sounded like “You stink”! We walked back down the road and to a campsite .1 miles off the road.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654055,"Lucky and I knew today that we had some really big climbs ahead of us. The warm up climb was Mt. Mist which had a sign at the summit that said, “You almost missed Mt. Mist.” Very clever. The weather today was nice and cool with clear skies so we were excited about some really nice views. First up for the day was Mt. Moosilauke at an elevation of 4802 feet. This would be the first 4000 foot peak that we climb since Virginia. Before we started our climb we had trail magic. A cooler full of apples and chocolate. We met Chef Decker there and she told us a little about the hike coming up as well as the next challenge which was Mt. Wolf. Lucky and I started our climb and it was everything that people had told us. Mostly straight up with rocks, roots and mud. We climbed for a very long time and when we got to the top there were people everywhere. The views were amazing. You could see the mountains from where we had been and the mountains where we were going. Very cool. We started our climb down and met many day hikers that were coming up a very steep and rocky trail. Some were struggling a little and Lucky and I did our best to tell them it would be worth it. The trail down followed a water fall, which was cool, but tells you how steep it was for us. We finally made it down the mountain to Kinsman Notch and had more trail magic. Wamba, who had done the trail last year Southbound, was cooking hot dogs and had other food to eat. I had two hot dogs, two brownies, potato salad, cole slaw, a snickers bar, two pieces of pizza, a cupcake and two Cokes. We talked to a hiker who had just hiked the section we were heading too and he told us we had a pretty easy section ahead. We started our hike, crossed the road and proceeded to go straight up. Apparently the hiker thought we were doing a different section. We climbed and climbed and finally made it to the summit of Mt. Wolf. On the way down we had to navigate through rocks, mud pits the looked like they could swallow you whole, blow downs and running water. We met up with Monkey and Fern and we talked about how hikers at this point are a little run down. We all agreed but we were also excited about being so close to the finish. We passed the 1800 mile mark and that just made things so much more exciting. Lucky and I got to the Eliza Brook Shelter after a 13 hour day.

We followed along Eliza Brook for about a mile. I love the sound of the water so it was nice to hear as we started our day. We began our climb up South Kinsman Mountain at an elevation of 4358 feet and about 1300 feet in a mile and a half. We made our way over to North Kinsman Mountain at 4293 feet and then started down to the Lonesome Lake Hut. Lucky and I went in and ate some pastries and drank some coffee and apple juice. The place is a little expensive so we didn’t stay long. Joe was very helpful with information about the terrain coming up. She suggested we have a bail out plan if we got too tired. Lucky and I were determined to make it to the campsite so we headed back on trail. The stop helped our energy levels and we had a pretty smooth trail for about two miles. Then we began our hike up to the Franconia Ridge Trail. We went from 1416 feet to 4250 feet in three miles. To say it was difficult would be an understatement. We climbed straight up for three miles. It took us one hour to go one mile. We stopped to have lunch, still on our climb, and then got to the top. We began walking along the ridge and headed for Mt. Haystack at 4780, then Mt. Lincoln at 5089, then Mt. Lafayette at 5260 and finally Mt. Garfield at 4500 feet. The views were amazing, spectacular, outstanding and next level.

Words can not even begin to describe how beautiful the colors of the sky. Simply amazing. We knew that we were not going to have as many climbs as yesterday and we also knew that we would need to get somewhere to resupply. We did have one big climb but after that the trail leveled out a little and not as many ups and downs. We met Paya who was from the Czech Republic and was finishing his triple crown with the AT. We are also running into more SOBO’s. We climbed three 4000 footers and then stopped at the Zealand Hut. They had leftover scrambled eggs and oatmeal for thru-hikers. Lucky and I ate some of the food and then got back on trail. The trail leveled out and we pushed to US Route 302. We had not had cell service all day so we could not call for a shuttle. We stuck  out our thumbs and hoped for the best. After about 15 minutes a car stopped for us. The passenger in the car was a woman who had just finished the AT. She had just dropped off some trail magic at the trailhead and was heading up to Montreal with her boyfriend. They gave us a ride to the Crawford Notch General Store and Campground. Lucky and I went inside to do a small resupply. Final cost for me was $90.07. You read that correctly. I went outside to pack the stuff in my pack and a man, David, started talking to me about the trail. He was from Massachusetts and had a lot of questions. A woman walked by and David told her what Lucky and I were doing. Another couple walked by and they started talking to Lucky and me. Lucky went back inside to see how much it would cost for us camp and we walked over to check out the site. The woman and her husband were at one of the sites and asked if we wanted dinner. Uh yeah. She made us spaghetti with bison meatballs and also gave us a couple of beers. Outstanding. David was going into town and asked if we wanted him to grab a pizza. Heck yeah! I gave him some money and he headed out. While we were waiting for the dinner to be ready, a woman from the next site brought over two steaks for Lucky and me. Unbelievable. We ate the steak and then we sat and ate our dinner while talking to Karinin and Sean. They were awesome and we were so appreciative of their kindness. David returned with a pizza and we ate several slices before we went to take showers and do laundry. We ended up getting a Yurt and with the rain coming tonight it was perfect.

When he dropped us off he said, “You’re not climbing up that are you?” We laughed and said, “Yep.” It had been raining most of the night so we knew that this hike, with the climb and the rocks, was going to be challenging. We got to the top of Webster Cliffs, the wind was howling and you could not see much due to the clouds. Then we continued to the summit of Mt. Webster at 3910 feet. We had to use our hands for a lot of the climb and we spent some time slipping and sliding. Then over the top of Mt. Jackson at 4052 feet. A lot of wind and no big views. We got to the Mizpah Spring Hut around 1100 and got some coffee and bakery items. The talk at the hut was that the weather was not good at the top of Mt. Washington. Clouds and wind gusts of 70 mph.

We would be gone before breakfast would be served but we were excited about dinner. To stay at the hut cost $178 so we were very fortunate. Lucky had to sweep the main floor and I was responsible for cleaning and reorganizing the library. For dinner we had pulled pork, mashed potatoes, peas, white bean soup, bread and cake. All we could eat too. Very tasty. Sleeping arrangements were that we slept on the floor of the main seating area. We got to sleep around 2100 and we were up around 0500.

Lucky and I have enjoyed New Hampshire but it has definitely been difficult. During our day, we met Shaka and Hanalei. They are section hikers from New Jersey and they are finishing up their last section. We congratulated them and wished them the best of luck.

We were up at our usual time and on trail right around 0530. We had a big climb right away up Moody Mountain. There were a lot of stone steps and it was straight up the mountain. Nothing that we haven’t done before but it definitely taxed the lungs and legs. We immediately lost all the elevation that we had gained and then we started up Old Blue Mountain at an elevation of 3600 feet. During our climb we stopped to put on our rain jackets as it started to pour on us. It rained for about 20 minutes but it was long enough to wet all of the rocks. Not a big deal going up but definitely an issue going down. Our next and last big climb of the day was up Bemis Mountain at 3564 feet. The descent involved all three of us slipping, sliding or falling down wet rocks. At one time, I slid down a rock, Beaver Chew slid down a different rock and Lucky fell/slid down a rock in a matter of 30 seconds. Needless to say, it took us a while to get down off the mountain. We got to the bottom and we had trail magic. It was awesome! We ate hot dogs, bacon cheeseburgers, chips, potato salad, macaroni salad, banana bread with cream frosting and chocolate chip cookies. We could have stayed longer but we had just under five miles to the Lean-to and it was supposed to rain with possible thunderstorms.

We have started to take more breaks and take our time a little more since the end is in sight. We met some Flip Floppers at the summit that knew Lucky and we talked for a little while. We left the summit and had just over two miles left to the Lean-to. We arrived around 1700 and set up camp. We ate dinner and enjoyed our view by the pond. Early wake up tomorrow so we can get to Shaw’s early. Another good day! 18.8 miles.","US Route 21

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655080,"We were up at 0400 and on trail by 0500. We wanted to get to ME Route 15 by 1200 to get the first shuttle to Shaw’s. It was almost 18 miles but we had done that before and we figured the terrain was in our favor. Lucky set a great pace and we were making good time when we came to a water crossing that had we were going to have to take off our shoes and get wet. While Lucky and I started to get our shoes off, Beaver Chew worked on building his own bridge with branches and logs. We all got across, some wetter than others, and put our shoes back on our feet. Bad idea. Lucky walked around the bend and there was another water crossing. We all had to take our shoes off again and walk across a huge pond of water that had been made possible by a beaver dam. Needless to say we were not too happy and Beaver Chew even considered changing his name. We had another water crossing about two miles further down the trail but we were able to make it across by walking on tree stumps and some rocks. The rest of the trail was pretty smooth with some gradual climbs and descents. We still had to deal with some rocks and roots but we had a schedule to meet. We made it to the road at 1145 making it 17.9 miles in 6 hours and 45 minutes. We got a ride to Shaw’s with 40 ounce, piling five hikers into a truck. We got to Shaw’s and had the tour. We walked over to the general store and had lunch and then back to Shaw’s for a shower and a resupply. We hung out for a while and then headed over to the local gas station for pizza. Back to Shaw’s and now getting ready for bed. Big breakfast tomorrow at 0700 so we get to sleep for a little bit. Great day today. 17.9 miles","Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655081,"Shaw’s was an awesome place to stay. They serve breakfast at 0700 and it consisted of bacon, eggs, potatoes, blueberry pancakes and orange juice and coffee. We all ate well and then got our stuff ready to go. We piled into the shuttle and Poet gave us a great pep talk at the trailhead. Lucky, Beaver Chew and I started down the trail not really sure where we were going to stay tonight. It had rained all night and part of the morning so the trail was a little difficult with wet rocks and roots. There were several other hikers around since they had all stayed at Shaw’s. The talk now is about the weather at Katahdin, when you were going to summit and how much food you were carrying for the 100 mile wilderness. Both Beaver Chew’s and my pack weighed in at 32 and 30 pounds respectively while Lucky’s weighed in at a slim 25 pounds. We came to another river crossing and had to take off our shoes. Sometimes we spend a couple of minutes seeing if we can rock hop and that can be an event all in itself. Fortunately none of us have fallen all the way into the water. We had a couple of small climbs and then to another water crossing. We decided to sit at the river and soak our feet. While soaking our feet we talked with some other hikers and decided to stop at the next lean-to. It fit in well with our plans to summit Katahdin on Monday so that’s where we set up camp. On our way to the lean-to we passed the 100 miles to go sign. We are now in double digit mileage. We made our dinner and talked about the trail and some of our memories. We are excited about the end and we can not believe that we will be summiting Katahdin in six days. Great day today. 15.1 miles","ME Route 15

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655082,"Today kicked our butts! We had a bunch of climbs with few descents which made it feel like we were climbing all day. And who would have thought that the warmest weather we would have the whole trail would be the last week in Maine. We started the day with a climb up Barren Mountain. The views were awesome and we stopped to take a little break. Our next climb was up Chairback Third Mountain and then on to Columbus Mountain and then on to Chairback Mountain. By this time we were all sweating and wondering when the climbs would end. We came upon a plane wreck where apparently a father and son had crashed several years ago. They both survived, camped the night and then hiked done the mountain. We finally started our descent which at this point is just as bad as the climbs. This is mostly because our knees have taken such a pounding they are screaming at us with every step. We made it down and then came to the W Branch Pleasant River where we had to do another river crossing. We all made it across successfully and decided to take a break. We are taking more breaks to try to enjoy the experience a little more now that the end is so close. We continued through the Hermitage, which is a stand of 100 foot high old growth white pines, and then made it to the Carl Newhall Lean-to. We were all tired both mentally and physically. Each of us has our own bumps and bruises and we are trying to make it to the end. Good day today. We have a climb early tomorrow and then possibly some flat trail. 20.8 miles","Long Pond Stream Lean-to

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655083,"Well, we wanted to put some miles in today so that we could have some options in regards to when we summit Katahdin. We think Monday, but the weather is calling for rain. So we decided to push to Antlers Campsite which was about 27 miles away. We knew we had a big climb up White Cap Mountain but we felt that the trail would be a little less challenging after that climb. We started the morning climbing Gulf Hagas Mountain which warmed us up for West Peak and Hay Mountain. Then up White Cap Mountain where we were able to sit and look at Katahdin in the distance. It had a little cloud hanging out at the top so we were wondering if thru-hikers were getting any views on their summit today. We climbed down the mountain and then had a pretty flat trail. There were times that we had rocks and roots mixed in with occasional mud but for most of the time we had some cruisie trail. Maine has been awesome with ponds and rivers. Lots of water and lots of places to stop and take a swim. We have yet to take advantage of them but tomorrow may be the day. We were hiking at a pretty good pace because we wanted to get to the site before the rain that was forecasted to start at around 1700. We got to the site just after 1700. Quickly set up camp, ate dinner and climb under our tents/hammock just as it started to rain. We are currently at 51.7 miles from the summit of Katahdin and it is amazing to me that this adventure is almost at its end. We have talked about how we will feel when we get there but nobody knows how they are going to react. Time will tell. Good day today at 26.9 miles.","Carl Newhall Lean-to

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655319,"A beautiful sunrise this morning. The colors reflected right off the pond as the sun rose from behind a mountain. It was absolutely beautiful. Our goal today was to make it to Rainbow Stream Shelter at 21.6 miles so that we could do 15 fairly easy miles tomorrow and eat lunch and resupply at the Abol Bridge Store and Restaurant. The trail in the 100 mile wilderness has not been as desolate as we had thought. We have run into two women with kindergarten aged children, numerous day hikers and a scout group. Not exactly the wilderness we expected. Lucky led the way as he always does as we left around the same time. The trail has been beautiful with a lot of ponds and streams. Today our big climb was over Nesuntabunt Mountain. It was only 1522 feet but there were some steep sections. The best part was that we were able to see Katahdin again only 16 miles away. Unfortunately the AT takes 35 miles to get to Katahdin. We did stop at the top and have lunch. We then climbed down and on the way we stopped to eat some wild blueberries. So good and made me crave some fresh fruit. We arrived at the lean-to just after 1730. A very cool place. Right on a roaring stream and we soaked our feet before dinner. We talked with some SOBO hikers and they were asking a lot of questions about the trail. We have three more days until we summit Katahdin and we are very excited.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655320,A pretty smooth day for us today. We had a nice easy climb up to Rainbow Ledges where we took a break to make some final phone calls and text since cell service is limited from here on out. We also spent some time eating more blueberries. We arrived at Abol Bridge just before noon and we got an up close view of Katahdin. We crossed the bridge had some lunch. We got a camp site right on the Penobscot River. A couple gave us some PBR’s to drink as we soaked in the river. We got a small resupply and cooked some hot dogs and drank some beer.

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655324,"We had a nice campsite right next to the Penobscot River. We were able to site at the picnic table and watch the rafters, tubers and Sup’ers float down the river. It was a relaxing setting with Katahdin off in the distance. We were up around 0530 and then sat around for two hours waiting for the buffet breakfast. It has been interesting for us as we  cut down on our mileage and try to slow ourselves down as we near Katahdin. We left the campground after breakfast and arrived at the kiosk where we had to sign up for the Birches  campground where thru-hikers stay the night before the summit of Katahdin. We were the only ones on the list so things looked good for us. The rest of the hike was uneventful. We got to the Ranger station where we had to sign up again and went to the campsite to set up our stuff. We were there just after noon so a nap was in order. We enjoyed our free time and spent it talking about the trail, the weather tomorrow, the summit tomorrow and how much food we needed for the next day. A ranger showed up to collect our 10 dollar fee for the campsite and to fill out some more paperwork. We had dinner and then went to bed. Big day for all of us and we were excited about getting up the mountain tomorrow and keeping our fingers crossed for good weather.","Abol Bridge Campground

Dave Bunton (Ghost),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655440,"So today was the big day. After 117 days on the trail, today was the day that we were going to climb Katahdin. I had heard from several people who had done the AT before that Katahdin would be the most difficult climb on the trail. So, after hiking for almost 4 months, I was a little nervous about the day. We had gotten some rain during the night so I was worried that the rocks would be a little slippery and would make for a more difficult ascent. The three of us were up at our usual times and we had our usual breakfasts. Not a lot of conversation but the occasional comment on this all being over soon. We packed everything up and headed down to the Ranger Station where we had gotten off the AT. The Ranger Station will lend you day packs so that thru-hikers do not have to take all of their stuff up the mountain. Lucky and I took most of our stuff out of our packs except for some water and snacks and Beaver Chew chose to take all of his stuff with him. We got back on trail just after 0530 and began the last 5.3 miles. The first two miles were pretty smooth and flat. Once again, not a lot of conversation, just the three of us lost in our thoughts. We followed a stream and then crossed over at Katahdin Stream Falls. A very beautiful spot. Then the trail started the big climb. We made it to O Joy Brook where we drank some water and filled up our bottles with just enough water for any emergencies. The trail continued up and we finally rose above the tree line. From this point on to the top of the Gateway, the trail climbs steeply on an exposed ridge that can be very close to technical climbing at times. Lucky led the way and we all seemed to have an easy time maneuvering through the rocks. We did not have any rain however the wind was blowing the clouds onto Katahdin and we had no views other than the clouds. We made it to the Hunt Spur which starts as a flat space on a shoulder of Katahdin and gave us a little rest from the climb. It is also considered the most difficult section. We were still socked in so we were limited to views mostly of the trail which was fine since most of our time was spent on where we were going to put our hands to climb up the rocks. Then we reached The Gateway. This is where the trail transitions from incredibly steep to a flatter, rocky walk. The clouds were still hanging around and the wind was blowing pretty well but I just kept looking forward to see if I could see the sign. Still slightly shrouded in clouds, the sign finally came into view. Lucky touched it first, then me and then Beaver Chew. There were no tears, at least from what I could see, but we did fist bump and congratulate each other on a great achievement. We took some pictures and then snuck down behind a rock outcropping to get out of the wind and to see if the clouds would move out. We may or may not have had a toast with a liquid that rhymes with after all and then the clouds started to blow away. The views were incredible and we stayed long enough to take more pictures and text or talk to family on the phone. The hike down seemed so much longer than the hike up Katahdin. We ran into a lot of day hikers that were not sure if they could or wanted to continue the hike due to the wind and clouds. We tried to encourage them to continue but some decided to turn around and head back. We finally made it down the mountain around 1220 and my friend, Rick, was there to give us a ride. We jumped into the car and headed down to Boston. Four months on trail and the adventure was finally over. It all seemed anticlimactic however I’m sure that it will take some time to process. Lucky and Beaver Chew stayed in Boston for two days and then they both made their way home. My body is still recovering but it has only been two days so I am hoping that it will continue to recuperate. I will post a final journal entry in the next couple of days. Another great day on the AT! 2,194.3 miles","The Birches Campsite
