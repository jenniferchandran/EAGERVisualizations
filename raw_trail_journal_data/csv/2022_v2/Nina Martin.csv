Nina Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631895,"Gear list for upcoming hike. My gear has been tweaked a bit from when I attempted in 2019. Gone is the Plexamid, replaced by a Duplex.
Instead of hiking in convertible pants, hiking in Fjallraven Tights and will also bring pair of hiking shorts.

Nina Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631920,"I know that for a lot of people, registering my hike with ATC is just a formality. I registered for three reasons:
1. Coming from Canada, I have to clear US Customs. The piece of paper with registration with a start and end date is proof of why I'm in the US.
2. Allows me to get updates via email from the ATC
3. Gives me a date to look forward to.",,View Entry,"Nov 18, Thu",0
Nina Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631921,"Super jealous of those who live near the AT, or any trail. You have the opportunity to do shakedowns and overnight hikes. Me, not so much.
Where I live, we have -10C temperatures and a foot of snow. My husband and I live off grid, so we're tucked away in the bush, on a lake. We are nowhere near a gym, hills or mountains, trails etc.
As we are off grid, and solar power is hard to generate right now with lack of sun, I stumbled upon a non electric recumbent bike. So far, my workout is biking 15-20 miles a day, will be increasing in distance as time goes on. And, as soon as our lake freezes, I'll strap on the snowshoes and hike on the lake if temperatures are no colder than -20C. And when it's not too cold, I'll ride my fat bike a few miles
I've attempted the AT back in 2019. My gear is pretty dialed in, having made a few minor changes.",,View Entry,"Nov 18, Thu",0
Nina Martin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646353,"Coming to the US from Canada, I'm allowed 180 days without a visa. It is said that the 180 days is not per calendar year, but during a 12 month rolling period. Because I was in the US in 2021 and departed May 3 back to Canada, I could technically only get six months beginning May 4.That now is the challenge I face. If I still want to NOBO, I'd be starting late and with Baxter closing mid October, probably only get a good 5 months hiking. Having attempted the AT before, I know I need the full six months. Starting on say April 4, I'd only be allowed to stay 5 months.Now, I could flip flop from HF NOBO early May. I read that there are a lot of advantages of flip flopping...but I really want to NOBO from Springer.One other twist is I emailed CBP - and they said when I enter the US, it is up to the officer to allow you in and any other issues. The way I read it, the office could, having believed that I am not a threat to taking a job, or not going back to Canada...could grant me six months. I understand I need to be very upfront that a) I'm retired b) can financially support myself and have insurance and c) I have a home that I need to get back to.So many decisions. Ugh!",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Sun",0
