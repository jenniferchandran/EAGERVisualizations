croczilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660375,"     The following is an original work of fiction created by crocz.  She adjusted the hat and examined her image in the airscreens displaying around her. 
     ""Hmm..."" she said, ""It's just not quite right."" After a bit more fussing and several permutations, she dropped the hat onto the ground and switched her feeds to ""live"" mode.
     ""Good evening, watchers, it's your favorite show girl coming to you live from the top of Goose Eye Mountain, where I have been just LOVING the view!"" 
     Actually it was quite dark and cloudy, but the VR enhancement made it look like a beautiful sunset over a valley of fall foliage.
     ""Just look at that! Gorgeous!"" she exclaimed and many of her followers gasped appropriately and applauded politely from the airscreens.
     ""I know, right? Does it get any better?"" Of course there was no way to answer that question, and that was Victoria's favorite kind of question to ask.
     Victoria was the kind of person who could take hold of any situation and maintain control by making it all about her, while somehow still remaining relatable to her audience.      
      That is how she became a famous media star and earned her spot in the Race. It helped that she was quite beautiful and strong, with thick dark hair and incredible violet eyes.
      And right now, she was in her element. She was outside. On the Trace. Surrounded by airscreens and support drones, protected by robodogs and watched by millions of viewers, but nevertheless outside. A place where few dared to go anymore. Few of the Leets anyhow. Most Leets were content to stay indoors, living on filtered air, filtered water and filtered information regarding the larger world.  When they wanted to experience nature, they could just turn their smartwalls into a forest and have the house play some nature sounds and gently mist them with the smells of an old growth forest. Or if they wanted something more exciting, they could tune into The Race.
      But Victoria was different. She WAS The Race. She lived it and breathed it. 
      The Race was all she had wanted to do from as long ago as she could remember. Back when you could only watch on one wall, or through goggles.         
     And she pursued this desire without exception, every choice she made in her life was informed by one question: Will this help me become a star? Will this help me get a spot in The Race?
     And so it is no surprise that she was where she was right now. In the forefront. In the lead. Favored to win and way ahead on points. In fact she had all but won this season's competition, and little could stop her now. 
     Of course, there were others competing; Junker, Pablo Verde, Cloudpuncher, Stitches, all the old favorites, plus a few newcomers, but none were even close on points or anywhere near as far along as Victoria, whose nombre de camino was Purple Girl, or PrplGrl on the vids.
     ""I am loving this view so much, I think I will camp right here tonight."" After a quick check on the weather, she seemed satisfied enough to deploy the shelter.               
     A few hand gestures, and one of the larger drones split from the group that was hovering over her  and began a quick topo diagnostic before dropping a wrinkly plastic material from its underside. Very quickly the plastic material expanded and took shape as the drone pumped its warm exhaust air into it. A large dome formed, and within a matter of seconds, the habitat was completed and ready for occupancy. 
    ""Welcome to my house!"" 
     Victoria flung off her shoes, climbed in through the portdoor, dropped her small pack on the floor and collapsed onto the inflatable couch. She waved her hand in the air and most of the remaining drones sped off in different directions, while the drone that deployed the habitat stayed attached at the top, providing fresh air and warmth for the interior while also keeping the double walled structure pressurized. In addition to climate control and structure maintenance, the drone was also responsible for keeping communications links and position information while the other drones were off on various tasks; resupply, finding water, scouting the route ahead, spying on the competition, etc. A second, smaller drone collected her shoes and the hat she had dropped earlier and began reprocessing them so she would have a fresh, new pair of shoes in the morning. And maybe a different hat.
      Unwilling to move from the couch, Victoria used her toes to rummage around in her pack for something. After a few seconds, she extracted a holopak which when activated, produced a simulated fire. One that ""burned"" without consuming oxygen, but did provide a bit of warmth and a kind of tingling sensation that was pleasing for sore muscles. Another package morphed into dinner. Pasta Alfredo and a salad, complete with plate, cutlery and a tray.  She quickly attacked the meal in as polite a manner as possible, as her adoring fans looked on. They were enthralled. 
""Hiking big miles builds quite an appetite,"" she said between mouthfuls, ""as well as these,"" she finished, flexing her bare, muscular legs out over the fire, ""Ahhh, that feels good. Tomorrow we will be headed into the Mahoosuc Notch. By the way, Mahoosuc is an old word that means, 'abode of the hungry animals' so I should feel right at home! But for now I am content with that wonderful dinner, and all I need now is a good night's sleep, so good night y'all!"" And with another wave, she polarized the skin of the habitat and signed off. Exhausted after a long day of hiking, she dropped the remains of her dinner into the recycler, followed by her sweaty clothes, then stretched out on the couch and was soon fast asleep. 
Not far away, two pairs of eyes watched from just beyond the edge of  visibility. 
""Is she dead?"" Sandra asked.
""No, silly. She is sleeping."" said Jake.
""What means 'sleeping?' asked Sandra
""It's like when we rem, but it takes longer, and your brain tells you funny stories.""
""It sounds like fun!"" said Sandra.
""You can do it, if you want. Just turn your resonance way down,"" replied Jake. ""I find it quite boring and time consuming. Better to just rem for a few seconds and then you are good to go.""
""I'm going to try it!,"" answered Sandra, both excited and a bit irritated with Jake. He always acted like a know-it-all, even though Sandra was much younger and faster than he was.
Slowly, slowly Sandra dropped her resonance, lowering her heart rate and respiration, becoming more ""solid"". Soon she was operating at a much lower frequency. Something akin to the Leet's normal level of functioning. Very body aware and less connected to the shadow realm. She closed her eyes and gently experienced sleep for the first time in her young life.
Jake smiled to himself. He knew Sandra would have to try sleeping. She had to try every new thing she saw. It was in the nature of Shadow Children to do so, and it afforded Jake an opportunity to get closer to the Leet without Sandra watching.
Now Jake upped his resonance a bit so as to be completely undetectable by Leets, and he walked over to the darkened habitat. He could easily see through the polarization, and spent a few seconds just looking at Victoria. At this frequency, a few seconds of Leet time felt more like an hour to Jake, but he didn't mind. He was quite captivated by Victoria's appearance. 
Jake was considered old by shadow children standards. He was almost ten in Leet years, but because of the time dilation that shadow children experienced, he felt much older and wiser. The trade off of being ""old"" was that he felt that he was already losing touch with the shadow realm. Every day he felt less and less of the ephemeral magic associated with the shadow world, and more and more attracted to the material. Soon he might undergo the rites that would solidify him as part of the Wizzen, joining the stonelike being and becoming one with the  mountains.
But for now, he lived in between worlds, still capable of seeing and hearing the shadow realm, but also connected to, distracted by and even tempted, by the material world.
And so it was that he walked through the wall of the habitat as if it wasn't there,  picked up the holopak that was generating the simulated fire. Deactivating it with a simple press on the side, he slipped it into his pocket and walked right straight through the opposite wall. He wasn't sure why he did what he just did. He only knew that he wanted something, he felt a longing. He wanted to take, and so he grabbed something that he knew was valuable.
Victoria kept right on in her deep and dreamless sleep, completely unaware of Jake's presence.
      Meanwhile Sandra was dreaming. She was floating in a sea of bodies; hands that were holding her up and passing her along the surface . The sun was rising or setting, she couldn't say, but it was glowing orange and very pretty. The hands were busy passing her along toward the sun. Somehow she knew she had to get there and soon. There was something important she needed to do there.
Jake grabbed her shoulder and shook her. The sea of hands dissolved and she was back on top of the big granite mountain in the dark.
""Why did you wake me up? I was having a dream!""
""It's time for us to go,"" Jake responded. ""The Wizzen are calling.""
Sandra took a moment to spin back up to her usual resonance and Jake watched as her body became noticeably less solid, more transparent and fuzzy, and finally nearly completely invisible. He could still ""see"" Sandra, but only through his mind's eye. 
""Okay, let's go!"" He said, and they started walking, but because of their high resonance, they were travelling at such a great speed, that they would have been almost completely undetectable, even if they were visible. This was the time dilation effect again, and soon Jake and Sandra were back with the Wizzen at Tinker Cliff as easily and quickly as walking across the room is for you and me.

Gruntsalot was plugging along through the mud and drizzle. It seemed like he had been hiking in the mud and drizzle for his entire life, which was a considerably long time. He had no idea where he was, really, as navs and comms were both glitchy due to the poor weather, and now the daylight was dwindling. He stopped his trudging for a moment to look up and around. ""Fudge it."" he said, to no one in particular, and trudged onward. He was doing quite well on points and position, despite his soggy attitude. If his nav program had been working correctly, then he would know that he had hiked over thirty miles in the last twenty four hours and was nearing the Vermud/New Hampster border; currently in third place. This might have given him a bit of a lift, mentally, but probably not. Nevertheless he squished onward against the dying of the light.
---------
    Victoria halfwoke sometime in the middle of the night.
 ""All the tech in the world and I am still getting up in the middle of the night to pee. And why is it so dark? I'm sure I left the fire going."" 
She gazed upward, but the clouds obscured any stars that might be shining and the moon was nowhere to be seen. Just then she stumbled on a small rock and fell and hit her head. She tried to get up, but the force of the blow had been too great and she lost consciousness. She fell back and lay there in the dark on the cold stone, slowly bleeding from a small wound on her forehead.
------
Cloudpuncher was nearer to Prplgrl than any of the other competitors, and yet, he still lagged by at least a week. He was currently entering the White Mountains, and he knew from her feed that Victoria was well into the Main. He shrugged his shoulders and kept walking. There might still be time to catch up. It would require some sort of miracle or catastrophe, nothing he would wish on anyone, let alone Prplgrl. Nevertheless, he could not help but imagine a scenario where Victoria found herself in some sort of trouble, and Cloudpuncher was there, just in time, to save her from the terrible fate and win over her admiration and love. Because that's the kinda guy he was.
He had a rich internal life, so to speak, and spent a lot of time fantasizing about various epic feats of heroism. He had earned his nombre de camino on such a day. He was standing on a ridgeline somewhere,  spinning, kicking and punching at imaginary foes when a small group of Racers, Stitches among them, saw what he was doing and said, ""It looks like he is punching the clouds... Cloudpuncher!"" Despite his attempts to deny and ignore their attentions, somehow the name stuck and he eventually surrendered to it.
He shrugged his shoulders again and kept walking. No matter. He was who he was and not who he wasn't. Still...he indulged himself in a few swings and kicks...and then he shrugged his shoulders and kept walking. Turning up his airscreens, he cleared his throat and prepared to address his public.
""Afternoon, my good people. Cloudpuncher here and I am well clear of the good city of Hangover, and now I approach the first of the Whites Only Mountains! Mount Monadnock which is an old word that means ""I'm not a dead white guy"" or something like that. And then it's onward to Mount Liberty-for-White-Folks, and then a bunch of mountains named after dead white guys! Thank you Aryan Mountain Corporation for your racial sensitivity and cultural diversity. Whatever. I'll stomp on the heads of those dead white guys, and it will give me some sweet satisfaction! Meanwhile, I thought you should know that I am feeling pretty good about currently being in second place. It took a lot of effort to get here, and I am pretty happy about it. Of course, first place would be even nicer, but hey, it is what it is. And take a look around, I am representing here. There ain't nobody else like me even IN this racist Race, let alone running in second place!"" That drew a round of applause from his admirers and he bowed before them to acknowledge their enthusiasm.
---------
""Your girl has fallen."" These were the first words that Jake heard upon returning to the cliffs. 
""How do you know that?"" he asked, but immediately regretted it.
""We know what we know"" said the Wizzen. Somehow despite being old and slow, the Wizzen were attuned to things in a way that Jake didn't fully understand yet. They were solid creatures, in fact they almost never moved. They were like the stone of the cliffs itself, but somehow they knew many things. Even things that were yet to happen. Jake knew it had something to do with the A-chain. The Wizzen were tuned not so much to the shadow realm as to the very mountains themselves, and they could somehow ""see"" great distances through the crystal structure of the stone, or something like that.
""When?"" Jake asked.
""Soon"" said the Wizzen.
Jake startled and shifted his weight from foot to foot. 
""Eyrie and Sam will see to her. You can relax."" 
Sandra was already sitting in the lap of one of the Wizzen, having dialed down her resonance enough to be visible again. She was laughing and cuddling with the old stonelike creatures as if nothing mattered but this moment. Jake envied her detachment. Envy, another sign that I am getting old. First lust and now envy. What a day it's been. 
Jake couldn't relax. He wanted to be back in the Main attending to the pretty woman.
""I want to go back"" he said.
""Don't we all?"" replied the Wizzen. 
Jake frowned and paced. His brow furrowed.
""Go then, if she means that much to you.""
He was about to speak but thought better of it. The Wizzen always had the last word, and they had already revealed more than he wanted. And so he was off and gone in an instant. He travelled quickly, surprising himself that he could be so fast and light. 
-------
Pablo Verde was on a quest. For him, The Race was not so much about winning as it was about the side quests. He would never win the Race, but he would enjoy himself immensely in the process of hiking the thirty five hundred kilometers from Southland to the Main.
He adjusted his clothing and checked his bigote in the airscreen. Perfecto. 
""Hello, my children,"" he said, addressing the airscreen in front of him. ""I am talking to you live from The Make a Fee Knob. It is a glorious evening! The stars are out, and I am one of them!"" This created some laughter of appreciation among his fans. ""And yes, it is time for another evening of hiking."" Pablo preferred to hike at night, using the drones and airscreens to navigate his way along the trace. He was a romantic at heart and always had a great fondness of the evening, as he could use his imagination to fill in the visual gaps left by the lack of sunlight. Of course the drones could see in ultra low light, infra red and even millimeter band radar and relay this information to Pablo wirelessly via his stylish shades, so navigating the rocks and roots was an easy matter.
""The stars, the moon, the creatures of the night! Ah! Bueno! Perfecto!"" Pablo had artificially created a night sky that held both a perpetual full moon and all the stars, even an augmented milky way. An impossible sky in real life, but anything is possible with augmented reality.
Just then he heard a noise on the trail ahead of him. ""It sounds as though I have company."" And as if on cue, a robodog appeared on the trail ahead of him, but traveling southward, slowly and methodically, with its nose to the ground, sniffing for residual dna left by unauthorized users of the Trace.
""Ah, hello my little friend, you seek the mojados, yes?"" Pablo was somewhat neutrally curious about the dogs and the peeps that they searched for, even though his own ancestry was one of oppression and injustice, he himself was raised in an environment of wealth and privilege. 
""I have nothing for you, perro máchina,"" he said as the dog checked Pablo's clothing and gear for traces of the peeps, ""I have not seen those for whom you seek."" After a few moments the dog seemed satisfied and moved on southward continuing its ever vigilant search.
""Ah the dogs, the dogs, siempre los perros...when will the A chain Traffic Control abandon its paranoid delusion about these 'shadow children'?"" he mused, ""Claro, there is no such thing. We might as well look for Señor Santa or the Easter Bunny! Anyhow, it will not spoil my beautiful evening! I know that the Stitches and the Splat are not far ahead, and if I am lucky, I may catch up to them this evening."" He paused only for a moment to take a deep breath of the cool air before continuing onward along the spine of rock that was the A chain, the Trace that, unbeknownst to Pablo was quite literally made from the countless shadow children turned Wizzen turned ultimately into the very stone of the mountains themselves.
--------------------
While Victoria lay unconscious, a visitor approached. She was an older woman in baggy clothes and carrying a sack on her shoulder. She had a wooden cane and was wearing a pair of canvas sneakers. The visitor stopped and stooped down to inspect the fallen media star. Rummaging through her bag she found some comfrey and  a spare bandanna. First she gently rinsed the wound with water from an old army canteen, to remove what trace of grit remained. Then she made a poultice of comfrey and applied it to the wound, folding it into the bandanna and then wrapping and tying the bandanna around the younger woman's head.
Victoria stirred slightly at this, and began to regain consciousness. The older woman rose up and walked onward, but not before saying a quick prayer, and leaving a small pile of blueberries on a grape leaf.
As the older woman walked on, she grew fainter, just as Sandra and Jake had, and eventually disappeared into the night.
Jake arrived soon after and found Eyrie and Sam in the woods nearby.
""You'll never believe what just happened,"" Eyrie said. 
""We saw the Abuela,"" added Sam.
""She tended to the Leet!"" Eyrie exclaimed.
""Psshh"" Jake said.
""No, really!"" Eyrie pleaded.
""It's true."" added Sam. His tone implied that they were serious, and not just joking with Jake. 
What does it mean?, thought Jake. The Abuela was rarely ever seen, and yet, she appeared here to tend to a Leet? Unheard of! 
""I will ask the Wizzen what to do."" He bent down to touch the bare rock of the mountain with his hands and he closed his eyes. Using his mind to touch the mind of the Wizzen, he communed with them for a moment. His brow furrowed and then lifted, and he opened his eyes and stood up too quickly, staggering for a moment. He turned to Eyrie and Sam. 
""The Wizzen would have us bring this Leet to them,"" he said. ""Call in some more children to help.""
But even as he was finishing his last words, Victoria was no longer lying on the ground. She was gone. The drone was retracting the shelter back into itself and then it too was gone in a flash, heading roughly north northeast, apparently tracking its owner. The smaller shoemaker drone tagged alongside.
Jake could only stand there, unblinking, until the arrival of more shadow children pulled him out of his shock of disbelief. The children slowly appeared in a circle around him, holding hands as they do when they are focusing as a group. Jake crouched and closed his eyes again as he placed his hands on the cold stone of the mountain.
 'What should we do?' he asked of the Wizzen.
'Follow her' came the response, 'She is still in trouble. The abode of the hungry animals is not yet done with her.'
And so Jake and the shadow children followed into the night. Into the forest. Into the Mahoosuc Notch.
-------------------------------------
""He's only two clicks back,"" Stitches said as she glanced at the small airscreen she was using to navigate. She had hacked into the ATC command signal used by the robodogs and located Pablo Verde.
""I know,"" replied Splat,"" I have the same data you have.""
""Only because I share,"" quipped Stitches.
""Ask me if I care,"" answered Splat.
""You will care if he catches up to us. He will never leave you alone.""
""And you do?"" asked Splat with some disbelief in his voice.
""Is that what you want? You want me to leave you alone?"" asked Stitches, a bit of stress showing through in her tone. ""I can do that, you know, I can just walk my normal speed and leave you in the dust.""
""Can you?"" asked Splat, ""I would like to see you try.""
Stitches said nothing, but her face softened a bit.
""I enjoy you company,"" offered Splat, ""most of the time. And I agree that staying ahead of ol' Pabs is desirable enough to push a bit harder. At least until we can sneak down into Tinker Cliff and let him pass. I am tired and have no desire to walk all night. I'd rather pull up and get some well deserved rest. And lasagna."" This last bit made Stitches smile. Splat knew how much she loved lasagna. So, okay, Stitches realized the logic here, and it was also Splat's way of giving her a bit of acknowledgment and support. He was a quirky person, painfully sarcastic sometimes but also caring and generous as well. The sarcasm was no doubt a coping mechanism for dealing with the disparity that Splat saw in society. He himself was one of the privileged, able to go wherever he wanted whenever he wanted, but at the same time, Splat seemed almost completely dissatisfied with the world of luxury and comfort that his wealth and privilege had afforded him. He would rather be out here on the Trace, Race or no Race. He enjoyed being out here in what was left of the natural world, and often eschewed the technology which made life for the Leets so easy. At home in the city, Splat would often cook his own food on antiquated machines with vegetables that he grew on his small patio in buckets rather than using prepak. Even out here, Splat would often sleep outside on the ground rather than in a habitat, and he rarely used drones for resupply or media connection. He actually drank water from streams and occasionally ate food that he would find growing along the Trace. Of course, there were no rules when it came to lasagna, and prepak lasagna was among the best things going.
""Okay,"" said Stitches, ""nav says its two clicks to Tinker. Lets see if we can get there by 030."" 
""No hay problema!"" Splat said in his best impersonation of Pablo Verde. Stitches recoiled in mock fear as they both chuckled and pushed onward.
------------------------------------
Victoria aka Prplgrl was just entering the Notch. It was cold and cloudy and everything was wet. 'I must be careful,' she thought to herself, 'despite these fancy shoes that seem to stick to everything, I could still get hurt in here.' 
The Notch was unlike any other place on the Trace. A steep gorge filled with house sized boulders that concealed a layer of ice that kept everything cold and damp even in the middle of the hottest summer. Negotiating your way through here meant either groveling along the bottom or scaling dangerously wet and exposed rocks with potential falls of ten meters or more, or some of both. 
Victoria was never one to grovel, and so she mostly took the high route, leaping from rock to rock and sometimes nearly missing and finding herself clinging by her fingertips, scrabbling frantically with her fancy shoes.
""Ummpphh!"" she declared, afrer a particularly difficult leap and grab. Of course, the drones were capturing all of this in high def and broadcasting it in real time. Her fans were no doubt gripping their seats and biting their nails at the same time. Now we'll never know for certain how much of her struggle was real and how much was made up for her audience,  but isn't that always the case? Let's just say that although the Notch is tough and many have met with serious injury there, Victoria was at least equal to the task.
At least she thought so. 
Even the best of us is capable of error, and it only takes one small misstep...
""Catch her!"" Jake thought to his group of shadows. And they all pooled there energy to halt Victoria's fall. A fall that would have left her body crumpled in a heap on the lumpy floor of the ravine, but instead, she slowed and hovered to the ground as if on an invisible cable.
""What?!"" was all she could manage. Unfortunately, her drones had caught the whole thing on video, and right now, millions of viewers were uttering exactly the same word and wondering what was happening.
Jake understood instantly what the implications of their intervention might be. ""Glitch it!"" he though to his group, and instantly the drones went beserk, losing control, flying erratically and eventually falling from the sky to crash against the rocks and into ruin. 
Jake and the children climbed down to where Victoria now stood unharmed but wondering why. Jake looked around. None of the drones seemed to be functioning well enough to be recording or relaying information, so he made a spot decision. 
""Encircle,"" he said, ""enhance, elevate, extract"" the words resulted in a ball of energy that surrounded Victoria. The children floated around her like so many invisible electrons, and together the entire group dissolved into invisibility and floated away.
Junker and Snotter we an unlikely team, even less likely than Stitches and Splat. Somehow Junker and Snotter make it work. They were nearly always at each other's throats but that's what made their audience tune in. You never knew what might happen. Junker got his name because he was always looking for salvageable equipment and materials which he would use to build and repair his drones, and also the communications and navigation displays or airscreens, as they were known generally. Snotter, well, you can take a good guess how he got his name. He had chronically overactive nasal mucus glands and was always launching boogers out of his nose, farmer style, by closing one nostril with his finger and blowing forcibly through the other. ""Phwiee!""
""Must you?"" Junker would ask wearily.
""I must"" Snotter would answer, ""It's who I am."" And their audience loved it. They were rolling on the floor most of the time.
""Ahem, ahem, are we on? Okay folks, we are here in ..where the  heck...oh yeah, we are here in East Tennessee, what they call the Tennessee Highway, a beautiful stretch of the Trace that you could almost land a plane on. Look at it! It is some truly bullwinkle trail. We have a legendary trailbuilder to thank for all this beautiful trail, uh, whatsisname?""
""Robert A. Person"" injected Snotter.
""That's right, Snotter, Robert A. Person built this trail singlehandedly in one day.""
""That's not quite true,"" objected Snotter.
""Well, two or three days tops, folks  I'm telling ya, the guy is a beast, and he is still building trail, this guy, I think he's been at it for, uh, how long has he been at it for, Snotter?""
""One hundred and seventy three years"" lied Snotter.
""That's right, a hundred and seventy five years this guys been building trail, in fact, I hear that right now he's workin on a trail from the Earth to the Moon.""
""That's right"" lied Snotter again.
""And he's almost done with it too, just needs to build a bridge over the sea of tranquility, right Snotter?""
""Yep""
""And then it'll be done. Man, I can't wait to hike that one."" Junker said wistfully.
""Me too,"" added Snotter with pure deadpan. 
""Anyhow, we're here in east Tennessee where the air is clear as moonshine and that's a good thing.""
""Yep""
""And we're hiking the Trace and still in the Race and havin a grand old time, right Snotter?""
""Yep""
""An we only got, uh, let's see, uh, one thousand six hundred and, uh, forty two miles left to go. Is that right?""
""That's right,"" answered Snotter.
""So yeah, hmm, that's a ways yet to go, but look at this cool drone I built outta scrap!"" And with that, Junker held up his new drone. It was quite a piece of work. It had six props, each of which was suspended in a cylinder with no shaft or gears. The props were round and magnetic and held in place by electric fields,  so no parts wore against each other and there was  no friction either.
Junker pulled out a prop and then let it snap back into place. ""Pretty slick huh? It also runs on the new gamma pile.  I got out of a mil tech communicator that I found in one of them robodogs what got crunched by a rockfall back in the southland.""
""Very cool"" admitted Snotter.
""Watch this"" Junker flung the drone like a frisbee out over the edge of the ridge they were on, and it immediately powered up and hovered despite the strong draft coming up the ridge.
""And check this out"" Junker pointed at the drone, which had changed subtly. Four of its fans had slowed noticeably. 
""Its using the updraft to hold position, while also using some of its fans for power generation. Like the brakes on them old electric cars everybody used to drive around in.""
""That's one solid piece,"" admired Snotter.
""Actually, it's a lot of little pieces that...""
""I mean, that is one finely crafted and robust bit of machinery you got there."" 
""Oh...thanks Snotter...I'm right proud of it, you know.""
""As well you should be, Junker. Next year, everybodies' gonna want one of those.""
""And I'll be knockin' them out in the shop this winter, so if you want one, let me know. Meanwhile, let's see just what this little guy can do."" Junker fidgeted a bit with the dials on his wristpad and the drone took off at impressive speed.
""Where'd it go?"" asked Snotter.
""I sent it off to Trent's for a six pack."" answered Junker.
""Nice."" Snotter said with a smile.
    
--------------------------------
News about Victoria's experience and subsequent disappearance in the Notch was traveling quickly. There was a great deal of speculation about what actually happened. Some people were saying it was just some kind of glitch in the video or the signal. Others suspected a deeper conspiracy; that somehow the entire Race was faked and there was no way that Victoria could leap from boulder to boulder with such ease and grace and that somehow she must have been suspended by invisible cables. How else could she have decelerated and landed so softly? 
As for the frantic buzz on all over the webs, Victoria was oblivious. She was suspended in some sort of temporal spacial ellipsis and time and information as she normally understood it we're not available to her. She was unaware of where, when or even who she was. 
Despite her lack of information from outside, and a complete lack of sense of time, or perhaps because of it, Victoria was experiencing something that Leets never got to experience. Even the adventurous Leets who participated in the Race never got to experience a space outside of space time, which was exactly what Victoria was experiencing. Not something that is easy to describe. If you could ask one of the shadow children what it was like, they would likely just laugh and shrug their shoulders, equally curious about what it was like to be a Leet. Imagine the best moment of your life. A time when you felt so happy and alive, like anything was possible. You may have felt a lightness of being so unbearable that you might dissolve into nothingness. You might just float away if you didn't hold onto something or someone. Imagine what it might be like to experience quantum nonlocality, a place that wasn't a place but every place and no place. Everything connected in a way that could not be separated or even really understood, only experienced. Experienced so fully and profoundly, that you become the experience. There is nothing else. That was what was happening for Prplgrl. If she survived, she would never be the same again.
----------------------
""So what's taking those beers so long?"" asked Snotter.
""Darned if I know,"" answered Junker.
""maybe that drone just didn't have the right stuff"" suggested Snotter.
This last earned him a look from Junker that he rarely saw. A combination of homicidal rage and ""I want my mommy.""
Junker fiddled with a wrist pad and looked at his air screens to see if he could locate the missing drone. After a few seconds, his face lit up.
""There it is!"" he said. ""just down over that ridge there.""
""Hmm, want me to send a recov?""
""No, I got it."" And with that, Junker executed his own recovery program that allowed the drone to extricate itself from the trees and return to their position without the aid of a recovery drone. ""There we go."" He smiled broadly as the drone returned.
""And it's got the beers!"" added Snotter excitedly.
---------------
It is hard to say how long it took to journey from Mahoosuc Notch back to Tinker Cliff. Time is relative. If you were Junker or Pablo Verde, then perhaps several minutes might have passed from when Victoria left the Notch and appeared again at Tinker. For Victoria, it was a timeless eternity during which she felt like she had experienced every thing, every where, and all the time. If you had asked one of the shadow children how much time had passed, they might have asked you, ""What means 'time'""?
Regardless of your frame of reference, Victoria did survive the journey and she was changed. Profoundly. When she finally regained her sense of self enough to be aware of her surroundings, she found herself in the presence of the Wizzen. 
""Welcome, Victoria. It is good to finally meet you."" The voice, or voices, as it always seems that many were speaking at once but using the same words, was a bit unnerving. Like some sort of mild psychotic hallucination. Almost unbearable especially considering Victoria's highly sensitized state of being.
""Uh, thank you? Um, who am I talking to?"" she managed.
""We are the Wizzen. We are all those who have been.""
""Uh, okay, uh, well, you know my name already. What is this place?""
""You have been here before,  many times but maybe never down so deep before? The Leets call this place Tinker Cliff.""
""The Leets? Who are the Leets?""
""You are the Leets. Those who travel the Trace, those who watch on screens.""
""Oh, okay. I get it. Elites, right? As in the privileged?""
""Yes, that's right. The privileged. And we are the peeps, or the people. Those who came before and who will be here after.""
""After what?""
""After everything is gone and only nothing is left.""
""Oh, okay. So why am I here?""
""Yes. That is the question, isn't it? We are not quite certain about that. It could go any number of ways really. It largely depends on what you think.""
""What I think?""
""Yes,. And how you breathe, of course.""
""Of course. Hmm, this is a bit much for me, even after...I mean, I sort of know who you are and what this all means ...""
""Good. There is going to be a test later.""
At this, Victoria burst out laughing. It was involuntary, and she was crying too, at the same time. A complete emotional catharsis, in fact. Understandable for someone who had just experienced eternity in a grain of sand, so to speak. Or maybe a better analogy was a full day at the beach where each grain of sand is an eternity. When the emotional wave had broken, she spoke.
""I'm sorry. It's been quite a day. First I was leaping through the boulders in the abode of hungry animals and then...""
""And then, what?""
""And then I was...I don't know. It felt like I was the whole universe for...ever?""
""Interesting.""
""Interesting?!""
""Yes, interesting. You see, you have experienced something that we have not. Not even the shadow children have not experienced what you have been through.""
""The shadow children?""
""Those who brought you here.""
Victoria was vaguely aware of the children hovering around her, but she thought it was part of the hallucination that she must be having as a result of hitting her head on that rock, wait, did that happen? Or did she fall in the Notch? Was she dead? 
""You are not dead.""
""What?""
""You are alive and awake and this is real.""
""And the children?""
""They are real too.""
""But who are they? Where did they come from?""
""Originally they were the offspring of many generations of pilgrims, hiking the Trace, meditating, experiencing nature as fully as possible. Opening themselves to the boundless energy of the universe channeled here in the lines of the Trace. The children were born into this world as beings of almost pure energy, with only a casual interest in the material component of existence. They can move through time and space with such ease because they have never known that they couldn't, and the physical world is only of minor inportance to them.""
Victoria was speechless, but on some level, she understood  that what the Wizzen were saying was the truth. She had seen it while in that other state of being. An entire culture, older than anything that she and her people has ever known, living without technology, but with something much greater. A connection to the energy of the Trace that was so profound, it was unclear where the Trace ended and the people began. They were in fact one and the same. The Wizzen were the mountain chain. The children were the Trace. The fact that the Leets...her people had any interest in the Trace at all was the result of these people being here doing what they do for...how long? Too long to count. Countless generations walking this same path again and again. The pilgrim's meditation in action, until time itself had little meaning except as another medium of travel. 
""And what about you? The Wizzen?""
""What about us?""
""Where did you come from?""
""We have always been here.""
-------------
Cloudpuncher was relaxing in his habitat, enjoying a pleasant meal and watching the video of Victoria in the Notch. It had gone completely viral and had somehow even been pushed past the protocol filter that prevented contestants in the Race from viewing each other's feeds. He watched it over and over while chewing his food. 
""Amazing. I cannot believe...""
He wasn't even sure what it was that he could not believe. Was it Victoria's incredible leaps and bounds? Was it the impossible deceleration right before the whole thing glitched into total noise? The most incredible thing had to be that HE wasn't there to save her! The thing he wanted most in life, the opportunity he had been hoping for forever...missed. He shrugged his shoulders and kept eating. 
---------------
""I didn't mean when did you come from, I was wondering how you came to be."" stated Victoria.
""When the children reach a certain age, they come to us and sit.""
""They become like you?""
""Yes. They visit with us all the time, sit with us, we tell the stories, they laugh, but eventually all the children come home to us. To stay.""
""And eventually...you become part of the mountain.""
""Yes. We are the mountains. You Leets are just a remnant. An echo of what was. We walked here thousands of years ago. And now we are what you walk along.""
""But how...how did it get so...""
""Everything changes. Everything that is alive grows and changes, but not always in the ways you might expect and not always for the better. The Leets represent divergence, if you will, or maybe deviation? derivation? dead end? Instead of simply following the Trace, some of the people started following the followers. They experienced something similar to communing with the Trace, the novelty, the excitement,  the sweat and blisters, but without the spirit. Without the connection. It must have seemed like a reasonable tradeoff. But  merely following the Trace is not communion. And watching those who walk is not walking. How many followers do you have, Purple Girl?""
At this Virginia grimaced slightly, ""ahh, well, yes I see now.""
""It wasn't a rhetorical question. We really want to know. How many followers do you have?""
""Several million, I think, I don't know exactly. Why do you want to know?""
""We are wondering. Wondering why the Abuela chose you. What is it about you that is so important."" There was no question there, only statements.
""I have no idea,"" replied Victoria.
""Neither do we. And that, is very interesting.""
""How so?"" asked Victoria.
""Well, we usually can see nearly everything, both here and now and also the infinite possibilities of the past and the future. You see, for us, time is a construct that we dismantled ages ago. Or rather, it is a cyclic dynamic that we walked away from. By meditating for countless generations and focusing our attention on the Trace and Nature, we acheived a separation from the spinning wheels of time and fate. We see everything, and yet, we did not see this coming, which means that you are somehow different. You are not subject to the laws of causation in the same way that Leets generally are. You are somehow apart from that, and yet, not really a part of the web that resonates with us, or we would have been aware of this potentiality. This is interesting.
""When I was...travelling...from the Abode to here, I had a...dream?""
""Yes?""
""Yes. I was...it was...I don't know how to describe it. It was not like an ordinary dream. Much too vivid and complex. But not at first. First there was just a single point of light. Bluish white in color, shining like a star. Very intense and deep, as if you could fall into it if you were willing to let go of...of... whatever was holding me...together? Then it became a line. A straight, bluish line, ver short at first, but growing in length from both ends. Still the same bluish white color. The line extended outwards into the darkness seemingly forever. Again I felt that there was a depth to it that I didn't quite understand, like there was more to it than I could discern. Then the line became a plane, narrow at first, but eventually extending outwards until it filled half of the darkness. Not completely, you could still see the darkness as a... background maybe? that just made the patterns of the plane that much more interesting. Then the plane became a...matrix? A patterned three dimensional...crystal, maybe? I don't know, but it filled all of the darkness with its lines of interconnected nodes, and I was a part of it. And then I became aware that it was changing again, and me with it. It kept unfolding and revealing new complexity that was hidden before, but only by how you looked at it. Each time it grew or expanded, I felt like my perspective was shifting, like I was moving away from it at a right angle but really I was still inside it. This kept happening until there was so much...information? that the entire darkness was filled with this bluish light. No more patterns, only the light. At that moment, I realized that this was not the shadow realm. This was far too complex and interesting to call a shadow. By comparison, my 'normal' reality was but a shadow of this. And then, suddenly it collapsed into itself, following the exact sequence of expansion, but in reverse, until it was just a point again. And I was no longer a part of it, but apart from it. It was so bright and deep, but dimming slowly, slowly until it faded completely and I...fell?... back into myself. And I was here."" Victoria sniffed and rubbed here eyes.
""Wow.""
Did the Wizzen just say 'wow'?
""It seems to be how we thought"" said the Wizzen, ""Somehow, you achieved a state that took us thousands of years to achieve.""
Victoria looked skeptical, ""How could that be?"" 
""We don't know. Something about how so many children surrounding you, and your...special...nature? How is maybe unanswerable for now. Funny, 'why' is always the unanswerable question, and yet we persist in wondering exactly that. Why?""
""I know why."" It was Sandra. She had been sitting in the lap of the Wizzen this whole time. She seemed almost bored and had spoken only now and very much without interest, as if she had been listening to a story that she had heard a thousand times and was only waiting to reveal the ending.
""Do tell, child."" said the Wizzen.
""I had a dream, too,"" said Sandra, ""The Sun has asked us to return.
""The sun?""
""Not that sun, silly."" said Sandra. ""The sun in my dream was...different...than the sun in the sky. It was more reddish, and it spoke.""
""And what did it say, child?""
""It said, 'It's time to come home.'""
And with that, all of the children seemed to appear at once. Had they been there all along? They were all there, Sam, Eyrie, Jake and many more, glowing with a radiance that was of the highest resonance that had ever been seen by the Wizzen. The light of their resonance began to engulf the entire space until the Wizzen were beginning to become more defined, more present, more mobile. They began to stand up, slowly at first, as if they had been sitting for a long time. In truth, they had been. How long? Nobody knows, but now it was time to stand, and join hands with the children, and to walk away into the light. It took some time, as more and more Wizzen appeared out of the stone of the cliffs and joined the procession into the light. Each of them glanced at Victoria, as if asking a silent question, 'will you join us?' Victoria felt as if her heart was being pulled into the stream of people walking into...somewhere else. And then, her face changed. It became more stoic, as if she was listening to a voice of importance. She nodded her head, as if in agreement. And then with one last wave of her hand, she turned away from the stream of light and people, and walked away.

Stitches and Splat had just made it to Tinker Cliff.
""Whew! That was close!"" Stitches said exhaustedly. 
""Yeah,"" added Splat as he dropped a holopak and slumped into a chair-like stone seat at the edge of one of the seemingly endless maze of outcroppings that made up Tinker. ""He almost caught up with us. Good thing I jammed his prox sensors.""
""Thanks for that."" Said Stitches.
""No hay..."" started Splat.
The ground began to shake and rumble.
""What the..?""
""""Earthquake! Hang on!"" Splat had experienced this before, and he was bracing for catastrophe. But it subsided as quickly as it came.
""Whew! That was...""
""Ssshhh...I hear someone...""
And out of the dark, into the light of the simulated fire, walked a slightly dazed, slightly rumpled, but nonetheless thoroughly recognizable Victoria Purplegirl. 
""What the...?!"" started Stitches again, but was suddenly silenced by her own confusion.
""Hello there,"" said Victoria with a mysterious smile on her face. 
""Where did you come from?"" managed Stitches after a few seconds 
""Where indeed."" answered Victoria.
""How about you tell us over a nice plate of Lasagna?"" said Splat, holding out one of his opened meal paks.
""Sure"" said Victoria, taking the offered tray into her hands, but still wearing that mysterious smile. ""Lasagna sounds pretty good right about now. I have had a day, and I could use the calories.""
""We want to hear all about it."" said Splat.
""Okay,"" replied Victoria, ""but you are never going to believe it.""
""Never is a long, long time."" said Splat.
""Tell me about it."" replied Victoria.-crocz",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Thu",0
