Guinness,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649969,"Springer Mountain (AT start) to Hawk Mountain Campsite, mile 7.4Hiked a few miles with 3 guys from Memphis. Nice to pass the time chatting with people while hiking. Made it to the campsite by around 330pm. The water source was at the end of the side trail (.4 miles). Note to self, set up camp first then get water. No sense in jumping the pack only to turn around. My sawyer mini isn’t working. I suspect I damaged it while we we traveling. It was I the brain of my pack. Luckily, I have my backup sawyer micro squeeze. Nothing quit like spring-fed water. Both Ann Marie and I cried a bit while saying our goodbyes. Guinness was disinterested. I think she just wanted to get home. Nothing like the last time I tried the trail in 2020. It was a cold, rainy, windy day on Feb 29 and both of us were crying buckets. One of the hardest moments of my life.","Springer Mountain

There isn’t a decent campsite, so hostel won out. I did 13.2 miles, more miles than intended this early on. I needed to put in these miles to make tomorrow easier. I have to make it earlier to Mountain Crossings to pick up a resupply and try and get a new sleeping pad. My current pad isn’t cutting it. I toss and turn a lot and I’m a side sleeper.

Guinness,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650038,"Day 3Woody Gap to Neels Gap: 10.7 milesSpent the night at Above the Clouds Hostel in the Woody Gap area. Great experience to dine with strangers who have similar interests. Talk often revolved around sights, aches and pains and gear. Last nights sleep was better, save the snoring of an adjacent bunk mate. Overcast all day, with lots of haze. There was an overlook that could have been great, but a blanket of clouds and fog covered the vista.  The highlight of today’s hike was Blood Mountain. Not a tranquil name. To the Cherokee tribe, this mountain holds a place in their mythology. In an historical context, they fought a bloody battle with the Creek tribe in the area. 
It was a steady uphill climb to the top of Blood Mountain, with a stone hiking shelter on the top. The top and the north side of the mountain reminded me of our hikes in Acadia National Park—walking on stone at a difficult pitch. Incredible green foliage along the trail. I took a few photos of the plants, but a camera can’t do it justice. 
I came upon a privy that overlooked a valley. After later looking at the picture, I realized I should have gotten a closer shot to see an occupant’s vantage. 
The day ended at Neels Gap. Roughly translated, “gap” means to a hiker, “damn it, another freakin’ steep decent and climb to worry about”. On a positive note, though, there’s a nice outfitter store (Mountain Crossings) at this location. The trail goes right thru the property. My sleeping pad just wasn’t working for me. In my waining years, I find I toss and turn a lot in bed. My pad is conducive to narrowly built people who sleep like a corpse. Imagine sleeping on an inflatable popsicle stick that 20 inches across and crinkles like a potato chip bag when you dare to move.  Now I have a much wider (a whole five inches) pad. Last highlight of this stop. There are potentially hundreds of hiking boots on a tree at this establishment. Apparently, they were left my those who have had enough of the hike, or of their boots (replaced by another pair in the store).I have photos available on Facebook","Woody Gap

Got an early start to the day, waking up at 5am. It’s virtually impossible to be quiet (for the sake of fellow campers) when trying to pack up. I got on-trail by 610am and was blessed with a great sunrise. The ups and downs weren’t as extreme, nor was the heat. If you are one of the first out, you are considered a silk blazer, as you are the one blazing a trail thru the spider webs that crisscross the path.
I have met a few people while on trail, not as many if I had started sooner. I believe we are some of the last northern-bound thru hikers on the AT. If you start much later, you have to contend with potential colder weather in Maine months later. I have meet people in their twenties all the way thru their seventies. Most are section hiking, out for a few days or weeks. 
Today was my first experience with a trail angel. They are volunteers who meet hikers, usually at road junctions, and provide food and drink. What they provide varies. Some go all out and provide full breakfast, lunch or dinner. Others provide fruit and water. Whatever their level of support, it is greatly appreciated. I received the best banana ever today. 
Ann Marie and Guinness picked me up today, with the primary purpose of fixing the Garmin. The Garmin’s days have passed. Firmware updates and a call to the support center couldn’t revive it. Ordered a new one. Despite this setback, it was great seeing them again. 
After they left, I went to a grocery store and was overwhelmed with the cool temperature inside and the variety of food. I didn’t think it would hit me this fast.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Guinness,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650441,"Day 8 Taking a zero. That is a thru hiking term for taking a day off from hiking. Initially, the plan was to spend the night in town and get back on trail around mid day to get some miles in. However, the weather still isn’t looking good throughout the day. Plus, only God knows why, I didn’t get the restful sleep I anticipated last night. So, with all this said, I’ll hole up here and get back on trail tomorrow. I don’t like the idea of losing a day (keeping moving foreword) but sometimes you gotta see the bigger picture—that’s what I’m trying to convince myself. I borrowed some disinfectant spray and rubbed down the more sweat-prone areas of my pack. Try to reduce the inevitable funk that shall arrive.

Cloudy and foggy all day while ascending in altitude. I’m guessing the temps were in the mid-50s. I’m not a fan of wearing rain jackets while hiking, as I sweat profusely. So, I walked in the mist and rain with my t-shirt. The minute I stopped, the moisture caught up with me. I suspect it’ll be a long, chilly night in my tent. Views were nada today, unless you include clouds and fog. I ran into very few hikers. Only after arriving at the shelter did I talk at length with others. The shelter fits only six. Not that’ it matters because I opted to tent. I think I’ll stay warmer enclosed in my tent. First milestone today—made it thru Georgia. One state (78 miles) down. The next psychological milestone in two days—100 miles. I will slowly increase my miles per day. I’m time, my minimum should be 15 miles. Once in Virginia, I hope to be able to regularly do 20 mile days.  Off and on today, self-doubt creeped into my mind. The old game of compromise reared its ugly head. You don’t have to do the whole thing. Just get thru Virginia and you can go home to your girls (Ann Marie & Guinness). Better yet, do a quarter of the trail (500 miles, ish). Then I’d do a reset and remind myself how I felt the last time. Remember, give it time. All things will pass—tired, hungry, hot, cold, wet,,sweaty, lonely. These are all temporary. Visualize getting to the top and finishing and how it will feel.

However, recent bear activity at my planned stop and areas around it required a changed. Bears were stealing hikers food that was secured on tree limbs (hang bags). Once they find a spot with food, odds are they will return. 
Though I have yet to see a bear, I did see a boar momentarily on the trail. It bolted into the woods once it saw me. I have seen what I believe to be bear scat/pooh. My sleep so far has been terrible. My sleeping quilt/bag isn’t keeping me warm enough. Surprising since it takes a lot for me to get cold.

We (myself and two other hikers) were fortunate that a lady was dropping off her granddaughter back on to the trail. She offered us a ride into town. She’s a retired teacher and runs an alpaca ranch. Got an invitation to visit. 
First order of business was a new sleeping back at a local outfitter. Great people. Ran into other hikers I’ve met over the last few days there. They have a basement where they let us secure our packs while we shopped, and while we had lunch. Burger and fries. So simple, yet so delicious after eating dehydrated food and tuna/chicken packets. A gentleman offered to buy beers after he asked if we were thru hikers. I was very tempted, but I am abstaining for a while from alcohol. 
Back on trail for another few miles to the latest shelter. The worst one yet. I don’t think the mice would want it. The privy is in better shape. I’ve seen better shacks in the 3rd world. 
Good to reconnect with hikers. We seem to cross paths off and on, often seeing one another at shelters. 
Before closing, the name Siler Bald is misleading. There’s no bald here, except my head. I’m giddy with excitement with the new sleeping bag. I haven’t had a decent night on trail yet.","Long Branch Shelter

I crossed paths, for the last time, with a fellow hiker. We ran into each other off and on since the start. She is section hiking and should be done soon. 
The new sleeping bag was a game changer. I wasn’t nearly as cold, though I still need to find the sweet spot with the sleeping pad (volume of air). 
Walked by another fire tower today (Wayah Bald). The views were great, though the haze didn’t help with the photos.

Great views today. Highly motivated to get to my destination. Hotel room with a king bed, shower and laundry. A bit overpriced, but worth it. 
Got on trail at 7am and was rewarded with cool temperatures. Apparently, the night before, campers downhill from necnay have had a bear visitor. I thought I had one, as well, but it was a nearby hiker’s snoring. 
All things considered, my body seems to be holding up. No recurring back problems, though I have had intermittent tingling in my left quad when first get up or when I stop walking.
I am very grateful for the support and encouragement that I’ve received since I started the hike. I haven’t answered all questions to have come up. It’s only because of time on trail and good connections to the internet. 
Tomorrow looks to be a bit of a longer hiking day to the next shelter. It’s a long climb out of this valley first thing. Those climbs are draining (energy and time).

Setting myself up to arrive at the Fontana Dam Lodge on the afternoon. The plan is to take what we call a zero, meaning a full day off trail, no hiking. Unfortunately, I need to go to an urgent care facility to have something checked out. Without going into too much detail on social media, it’s something that happens to long distance runners and cyclists—and apparently, hikers.  The next section to hike is the Smoky Mountain National Park and given its relative remoteness, I’d rather make I’m good to go. 
Another good weather day for hiking. Most of the views were obscured by trees, but I did pass another bald, which had great views (and a lot of flies swirling about). 
During my downtime, I may post broader observations. If anyone has questions, that would be a good time. I don’t have much time while on trail with making posts.

Guinness,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650949,"Day 15 Brown Fork Gap Shelter to Fontana Dam Lodge: 11.4 miles As views/vistas go, this was an uneventful hike. Most of the day was spent in the tree-covered trail. No big views. I could see Fontana lake in the distance. Weather was good. I beat the rain by about two hours. 
Very early in the morning, I heard some strange animal noises near the shelter area. Definitely not birds. My guess is a mammal of some sort. I am going to research tonight to see if I can identify the source. At some point today, I lost my ball cap. I backtracked about 5 minutes to find it with no luck. It was a matter of time. It wasn’t properly secured. I need a more colorful cap . 
I am at the Urgent Care facility in Robbinsville, NC, waiting on my ride back to the lodge. As I suspected, nothing to worry about. I’ve had varying degrees of blood in my urine the last few days. This can happen with long distance activities like running, bicycling and hiking. Out of an abundance of caution, I wanted to have it checked out, especially going into the Smokies. So, I can relax today and tomorrow. Looking forward to a shower and real food.
Late add to this post. I’m a bit of a history buff and like to understand the past of places I’ve passed through. Here’s a quick synopsis of the dam, courtesy of the lodge. The lodge is part of Fontana Village. It was originally built to support workers who came here to build Fontana Dam. The dam was built by the Tennessee Valley Authority from 1942-1944. Entire families came with the workers. Homes, schools, churches, a hospital, theater and more facilities erect constructed. With the completion of the dam and the war’s end, workers left, but were replaced with tourist. 
The story didn’t mention the families displaced by the flooding of the valley behind the dam. The resort has many pictures today homes and families during this period. There’s no context/explanation of the photos. I can only assume they were homesteads lost to the lake—victims lost to progress and imminent domain.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

That being said, I did feel the pull, the desire to take advantage of a good weather day to put in some miles. Two hikers who I’ve crossed paths with the last few days got back on trail this morning. I could never keep up with them, not that I should even try. One is a undergrad student and the other is 35. It’s not a race. Plod along at my own pace. 
I took a shuttle van over to Fontana dam this morning to check it and the lake out. While on the dam, I chatted with a couple guys on a bass boat next to the dam. Their fish finder indicated a depth of 380 feet. Not sure how that compares to the dams back in my hometown area. 
Tomorrow, I go back on trail. The trail in the Smokies is 72 miles. I plan on getting thru in six days. Chances of rain for the next two or three days.

Most of today’s hike was surprisingly easy. Based on the elevation graph, I was expecting a more difficult grind uphill. With a couple exceptions, the views were no different than those outside the Smokies—ups and downs, twists and turns, lots of green vegetation. A notable exception was the view from a fire tower. Most of the views were obscured by clouds. I got lucky at the tower. 


I lost count of the bear Pooh along the trail. I did see two actual bears. One saw me first and took off. The other I saw first. I made noise (banging my hiking sticks together) and l yelling at the bear. He eventually took off.

With the exception of a turkey, no wildlife observations. Very little bear scat on trail. Lots of views into the valleys and adjacent mountains, but tree coverage obscured it too much for good photos. 


Tomorrow, I begin my descent out of the park. I should be at Clingmans Dome (the highest  part in the park and highest peak on the AT) in the morning. Hopefully, the fog will no be present. I also hope there’s a soda machine. Since starting this trip, I’ve craved coke. I would really be great to get some trail magic. This is a trail term for volunteers who provide food and/or drink for hikers. Since it’s late in the AT hiking season for this area, it is unlikely. I came across a trail angel back in the Franklin  area and he gave me some water and a banana. The best damn banana, ever.

Made it to Clingmans Dome. Was really hoping for some kind of snack at the store. Alas, they don’t sell food or drink. So, I hiked up to the Dome and took many pictures. Lots of great views today. Unfortunately, my feet are killing me. I believe the width of my feet have increased. I’ve heard it happens, but I thought I compensated for that by getting shoes 1/2 size larger than my normal size.

Icewater Spring Shelter to Cosby Knob Shelter: 20.3 miles


One of the hikers last night actually brought a pint of Wild Turkey. Who thinks of weighing themselves down with such a thing? 


Difficult night of sleep. My tent neighbor snores like no other. It was brutal. No pattern whatsoever. I brought earplugs, but they were no match for Capt Naval Passage. I put my spare buff around my ears. That, too, failed the onslaught. I think my teeth rattled. Then, I took a pair of my socks and put them over my ears and under the buff. Still no luck. Eventually, I fell asleep from exhaustion. 


On to today’s travels. My toes felt somewhat better today and the terrain was more forgiving. I stopped by Charlie’s Bunion, a favorite site for hikers in the park. The last time Ann Marie and I were here, the views were obscured by heavy clouds. Not today. Stunning views. I had a few more great vistas for some time. But then the path took me into more densely forested areas. 


I wasn’t planning on hiking so far, but my legs felt strong and my toes weren’t screaming as much.  This extra mileage set me up for a mid day arrival at a nearby hostel where I hope to sleep in a real bed, take a shower and eat non-trail food. 


Another side note on yesterday. I met two hikers who are diehard fans of smoking pot and experimenting with hallucinogens. One worked on a pot farm in Oregon for a time. 


 When I hiked thru Newfound Gap the other day, I had to pass by a large number of tourists in the parking lot. I was surprised by my sense of smell—perfumes, soaps, etc. The smell of clean people.

Icewater Spring Shelter to Standing Bear Farm Hostel: 10 miles
Today was race to get to the hostel and relax a bit (shower, laundry, food, real bed). Unfortunately, this place didn’t hit all the markers. The bunk room looked like something out of Stalag 17. No washer, per se, but I was able to use a centrifuge dryer to get my clothes mostly dry. It was sunny outside, so I fashioned a clothesline and got the job done. The frozen pizza satiated my hunger. It was an outdoor shower, which is fine. The hot water came and went and came again. I opted to sleep on the lawn in my tent. It’s a hostel, so the bar isn’t high. 


As for the hike, it was a blur. Not a lot of views. After going thru the park, it seems the highlights can be found in the central park region. The southernmost is hiking thru a lot of valleys (views similar to the region outside of the park to the south) . 


Around 430am, I was awake and hear a thundering crash. My first thought was lightning or thunder. Actually, it was the crash of a tree in the distance. The entire night was quite windy. Throughout the park, you can see where trees get uprooted. They aren’t on a solid base, as the ground beneath is quite rocky. I took a few photos as an example. 


 We, the others, prefer to get our chores done, relax and go to bed early. 


It took me almost exactly 5 days to get thru the Smokies (5 days and one hour). A milestone completed. My next objective is the town of Hot Springs,NC. The trail goes right thru town.

As usual, it’s a race to get to the next R&R location. I put it in overdrive and now paying the price. I may be having some shin splint problems, probably caused by the breakneck speeds going downhill. Luckily, I am off trail for a day and a half. I have a private room in the hostel, which is far better than the bunks in steerage. The room is quite small, but it’s mine for two nights.


Last night was unbelievably windy. It woke me up repeatedly. However, it was not cold and my tent held up to the winds. I camped near five guys who were related by blood and marriage. It was nice to converse with people in my age group. Speaking of which, a young lady came by and was setting up her hammock while I was describing the bunkhouse at the last hostel. For some reason, she felt compelled to interject-oh is wasn’t that bad. Regardless of one’s opinion, it’s a bit rude to step into a conversation right off the bat. A similar instance happened two or three days prior with a 20-something deciding he needed to correct me on something. When I am tired, my civility sometimes wains. It took a bit of self control not to go Senior NCO (or senior citizen) on him. 


 The scenery was lackluster today. That, or my warp speed in the heat and humidity blurred my observations. 


Imagine you are hiking and a bit tired and sweaty. By a bit, I mean your shirt is drenched. You feel like every pore from top to bottom, stem to stern are wide open to keep you cool. You are going up an incline and that is all that you see..a continuous up ramp . As you get closer to a blind turn, you think, “ok, around the bend, it’ll flatten out or go down.” Nay. Nay. It’s another climb. Oh, the humanity! You stop on your tracks, bend down so that your upper body is parallel to the ground. Take a few deep breaths. Repeat a chant you’ve been saying since day one and press on, looking for a distant point as your next stopping point. Rinse and repeat. 


Did I fail to mention my room has an A/C that I alone control. 


After a long, hot shower that was almost religious, I put on my least dirty clothes and CROCS and made for the outfitter to find new hiking shoes. They did not disappoint. I had a lengthy and enlightening discussion with one of the employees—the guru of hiking footwear. He didn’t vomit or wretch at the site of my feet. I’m the proud owner of Altra Lone Peak 6 trail runners. It’s like floating on air in comparison to my boots. While they are not waterproof, they are oh so light and dry fast. I was advised to keep the mileage down a bit for the first few days to get use to the shoes. It’s getting hotter here and chances of more rain thru the next few days are high. I spent about and hour in the store, long enough for the sky to open up and give us a deluge. After waiting a while, I decided to head by, regardless of the rain. I bought a cheap plastic poncho (my rain jacket and umbrella being back at the hostel). Despite this covering, I was getting a serious chill. One more store stop for some food resupply (and a cheap umbrella..that I will donate to the hostel) and back to my lair. Laundry is finished. So, I can try and relax. Tomorrow, I’m off to a local diner for breakfast—eggs, bacon, toast, waffles/pancakes, coffee, OJ. 


Like food cravings, I’ve come to appreciate little things—running hot and cold water, a bed, indoor plumbing, climate controls, restaurants/grocery stores, electricity. Magical.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Laughing Heart Hostel to Spring Mountain Shelter: 11 miles


I’m currently at a diner waiting on my breakfast. 


I haven’t had a real breakfast in several days. The local diner was closed yesterday and I arrived too late on Saturday. Today is the day. I also get back on trail. Unfortunately, it’s a steady drizzle outside. I’ve been lucky. I have yet to have to hike in the rain. I have a rain jacket, rain pants and a lightweight umbrella that clips on to my pack. My new shoes are not waterproof, but that’s the price you pay for lightweight trail runners. 


As you know from previous posts, my previous shoes were no longer wide enough in the toe box. Seems my feet have gotten wider. After conversations with different hikers, not only do your feet get bigger (which I knew—my boots were a gang size larger than normal to accommodate this reality), but they often don’t go back to their original size. That, I did not expect, nor did it think they would get wider. 


I have to check out of the hostel by 11am and with the rain, my improving shin splint issue, my comparatively shorter hike today (about 11 miles) and the new shoes, I’m not in a particular rush to get out the door. I need to slow down a bit anyway. I have been like a gerbil on a wheel from time to time—in a rush to the day’s destination.


I left the hostel at 11am. I wasn’t looking forward to hiking in the rain. It didn’t disappoint. The rain was (and is, as I type this) relentless. If you have ever hiked (or strenuously walkway) in the rain , you know rain jackets retain your body heat (even with the armpit zippers. So, I opted to just hike in the rain in my t-shirt. Good idea for a while. Then the wind kicks up and cools off. I am soaked. Set up my tent and sitting in it now. Ate some food to help generate some heat.


I discovered that my sleeping bag somehow got wet- not drenched, thank God. Not sure how since I used my backpack rain cover. Perhaps when I sat it down to set up the tent. Guess I’ll have to get a contractor bag to put my sleep system (sleeping bag , blow up air pad, small blow up pillow, sleeping bag liner) in to be sure.
 No photos today, folks. There were some photo-worthy vistas coming out of Hot Springs, but the downpours negated that, plus I don’t want to ruin my phone.


Hoping for a rain free day tomorrow. A wet tent is a heavy tent. I’ll be hiking in the same clothes tomorrow and there is no way they will dry out tonight..at least not the pants. My boxers and t-shirt, I’ve kept on to use my body heat to dry them. The pants, though quick dry material, are soaked. Not looking forward to putting those on in the morning. If the sun comes out (big IF), they will dry out relatively quick.","Laughing Heart Hostel

My alarm went off at 5am, as it always does, yet I couldn’t bring myself to get up . The knowledge that almost everything was drenched didn’t motivate me.  Back to sleep. Six am came and I finally got up the drive to move. It took until around  830 to get back on trail. Wet shorts, shoes and somewhat dry socks (I squeezed as much water out as possible and put them in my shirt to use my body heat to dry them out. 


In some parts, the trail was a small creek or shallow pool. The previous day’s rain had over saturated the area. There were a couple vistas, but heavy fog hid everything at one location.

More rain last night, though it was as biblical as the other night. Another morning of “get out of bed..but I don’t want to..I’m perfectly fine being slightly uncomfortable here”. 


 By the way, antibiotic cream and toothpaste do not taste the same, despite the similarity in the tubes when brushing after sunset.




I had carnation instant breakfast with instant coffee added. Not too bad. 


Like many mornings, heavy fog treated my hike. It started off rather leisurely—not too steep in the ups or downs. I didn’t rush myself. I hiked across the largest field of blackberry bushes I have never seen.  If we lived close by, I’d camp out here for a couple days and lay waste. Sorry, bears. I love blackberries, especially in a pie, with vanilla ice cream. When I was young , we had a berry patch (I believe we called them dewberries, similar in taste, but smaller). 
I would go out and pick a bunch and eat a bunch on the spot. If there were enough, I would take them over to my grandmother’s (she lived next door) and she would make a pie. 


Later in the day, I came upon a ice cooler and it was full of soda and some sweets (aka trail magic). The sweets didn’t hold my interest, but I did down a soda. Further down the trail I saw a sign for a hostel 100 yards away. It mentioned snacks. My hunger wasn’t satiated, so off I went. It was the worst excuse for a hostel I’ve seen, but they did have a few snacks. Off go the shoes while I down another soda and a small (very) bag of chips. Cravings satisfied, back to the trail. As always, the last couple miles to the shelter seem to take forever. Once there, made another attempt to dry out my tent. It was windy, but I really need some sunshine for a few hours. The evening concluded with ramen noodles, with some leftover jerky mixed in for flavor. When available, I use the bear hang cables to secure my food bag (mine is called an Ursack, made of Kevlar…bear proof, they say). I hung my bag and noticed an adjacent cable had bananas. A first. Apparently, the trail angels struck again. Hopefully, I’ll get one in the morning.

My initial plan last night was 15 miles to set me up for a shorter hike to the next hostel.   I was completely prepared to hike in the rain. However, not only did the rain increase (as did the wind), but it cooled off. I was at over 5100 ft on the top of a bald, wind so high it was pushing me over, cold raining pelting me incessantly. Soaked completely. I could feel my core temps dropping and decided to get to the next shelter ASAP. I fell on the muddy trail as I was almost out of the bald.

Bald Mountain Shelter to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel (Erwin,Tn) 16.8 miles


It took quite a while to warm last night in the shelter. That being said, it was fun in a group misery fashion. The shelter was a double decker and my sleep mates on my deck were entertaining. We had quite a few laughs at each other’s expense. I learned within five minutes of meeting the guy next to me that he was a diagnosed schizophrenic. Comforting thought with a person within six feet of you in the middle of the night. 
It rained pretty much nonstop the entire evening and into the morning. I packed my gear and headed off around 7am, hoping the rays of sun meant a respite from the rain.

Plenty of water flowing down old and new streams. 


I arrived just in time to get my resupply box before the store of the hostel closed. I also caught the last shuttle into town (they returned two hours later to pick us up). I wanted some more food to supplement and wanted some non trail food for dinner. 


Laundry and setting my tent up in hopes it would dry were my chores next. I got a very small one room to myself. The tent has been wet for over four days and a wet tent is a heavy tent. Right now it’s Saturday, 28 May, at 3am—can’t get back to sleep. I’m hoping my tent will miraculously dry some by the time I depart later today.

I had two dinners last night, neither of which was particularly healthy. However, they were filling. The hostel’s shuttle dropped a few of us off in a part of Erwin that had a grocery store and a handful of fast food establishments. I picked Bojangles for dinner one. Dinner two was pizza from Dominos at around 930pm.  I haven’t had Dominos in years and it wasn’t too bad. I’ve come to realize that I’m not eating enough and it shows with my energy levels on the trail. As a result of my glutinous eating , my hike today was better. 
I’ve noticed over time that many hikers take an actual lunch break during the day. They will stop by a shelter or find a place alongside the trail and break out their food bags. It probably doesn’t strike some as something noteworthy, but it’s not my strategy…so far. I have snacks in a small chest bag. I eat while hiking. I may stop and chat with hikers, but seldom for more than 5 minutes. I’m not a fast hiker. To cover my desired distances, I make up for my slower pace by continual movement. Others are like jack rabbits. I said “so far” because as the heat and humidity arrive, it may be necessary to change things up a bit. 
As for the hike itself, my initial plan wasn’t to go so far. But I was feeling strong, the terrain wasn’t too bad and the weather was good. Not even a drop of rain. With a few exceptions, views were limited. One great area was simply called Beautiful Spot. I took a photo. It’s on top of another large bald and has spectacular views. The bonus is that there’s a gravel road and parking lot nearby. Since it’s near Erwin, I plan on coming back some day (we live in the area). I’d like  l do an overnight camp at this one vista that has views of the mountains and a nice fire pit. A bonus to this bald is a large area of blackberry bushes. Another great area was the area near the top of Unaka Mountain. A small evergreen forest covered the area. Just beautiful. Mature pine trees (maybe spruce) were so plentiful that the area was darker and cooler, with a great vibe. Tent camping on a duff of evergreen needles is soft. 
I got a late start to the hike (after 11am), getting out of the hostel because I wanted to give my tent more time to dry out and because I got caught up in two lengthy conversations with the hostel owner (whose name is not Johnny). Johnny died and I guess his family had no interest in running a hostel. The new proprietor is a retired navy guy. He spent many years in the DC area, while on active duty and as a contractor. We have similar views on government bureaucracy. We also discussed the state of repair of the hostel infrastructure. It needs some work, some of which has been done. I casually mentioned the showers which are run down, to say the least. It’s on his to do list and finding a contractor willing to do the work in this area seems to be part of the challenge. 
While I’m writing this, I am eating by headlamp. I got my tent set up by 845pm. Tomorrow’s plan. Another long day of hiking. I’m trying to set myself up for a short hike for the day Ann Marie picks me up on Tuesday,  at a hostel relatively close to home (about and hour away).","Uncle Johnny’s Hostel-Erwin TN

Like many nights, sleep last night was fitful. I don’t recall the last time I had a full, uninterrupted sleep. Even at the last hostel, I woke up around 2am and got back to sleep around 3. I toss and turn repeatedly. 
I got on trail by about 730am and made good time. I made myself eat more for dinner last night to have the energy during the day.. My pack is heavier with additional food, but it seems to work. I need to tweak my diet to try and get more carbs. With this resupply, I added flour tortillas, more peanut butter and a little cheese. Perhaps adding mac & cheese would help. Increase carbs without adding too much weight. Any suggestions?
Since I have stopped cooking for breakfast (to save time), I will drop oatmeal and add more carnation instant breakfast. During my short R&R at home, I’m going to experiment and add whey isolate protein powder and dehydrated whole milk to the breakfast drink and see (1) how it tastes , (2) added nutritional value and (3) weight. I will also add the protein powder to my granola cereal. 
For dinners, I’m still trying to work the problem. I have a combo of dehydrated beef (survival meal online), dehydrated pinto beans (homemade) and instant potatoes. It tastes good and is filling. I’ve been eating some packaged chicken cubes for dinner, as well. It tastes good, but it weighs a bit for the number of calories. Although it’s not a favorite, I’ve eaten ramen (minus the flavor packs). Lots of calories, but not tasty. Maybe I need to add something to enhance the flavor. 
Snacks during the hike consists of bars, various nuts (almonds, pistachios, sunflowers, peanuts, cashews and walnuts)— nut heavy hitters, stinger waffles and jerky. I recently added peanut butter laden flour tortillas to add to the calories. 
The reality is that I can’t realistically get enough calories for this level of prolonged exertion. So, I’m going to have to do what other hikers do when they are in a town—pig out every chance. I definitely won’t be getting overweight. 
On trail today, I met two ladies. One was 71 and the other was 76. That is amazing. Both are thru hiking. They aren’t fast, but they’re moving. 
A observation made by many hikers related to privies. The AT crosses back and forth into TN and NC. You can tell which state you are in by the privy. TN shelters have no privies. 
Soon after I set up my tent, a lady arrived asking about the 76 year old hiker. She read about her on Facebook and knew she is supposed to be at this shelter. She said she regularly provides trail magic and brought some. She had homemade cranberry flavored moonshine and snickers bars. Tasty. I haven’t experienced very much trail magic to date, probably because we are at the tail end of hikers heading north and those who provide this usually this free service focus on the hiker bubble.","Cherry Gap Shelter

One of best hiking days I’ve had. The weather was perfect—partly sunny (except when first starting off), slight cool breeze—and the terrain was relatively easy (save a couple straight up sections at bales). The views were just spectacular. If you get a chance and are so inclined, go to Carver’s Gap parking lot, near Roan Mountain. Take the AT north from the parking lot. You can hike a short distance and see stellar landscapes. Since it was a holiday weekend, weekend day hikers and overnighters were out in force. 
The Roan Mountain Shelter is the highest one on the AT, at 6270 feet. As such, it’s a bit cooler than most. It was also very foggy when I broke camp. 
Despite my 35 degree sleeping bag, I am often still a bit chilly at night. On several nights I feel a bit clammy, particularly from the waist down. Maybe I am actually getting too warm while asleep, sweating a bit and then cooling off. My sleeping bag has remained a bit damp, as well. I believe that’s a result of the humidity and last week’s constant rain. A good solid day of sunshine, airing the bag out, may help.

Mountain Harbour Hostel to Mountaineer Falls Shelter: 8.6 miles
Back on the trail. Ann Marie dropped me off once again, to be separated for an extended period, to tackle a challenge that has been on my mind for literally years.  Like she said earlier today, I will have to come up with a new hobby(s) afterwards. I will also need a part time job. There’s an outfitter in a neighboring town that might work. There’s also a general store that has a large assortment of hiking gear. 


I’ve given a bit of thought (had a lot of time to think) to hobbies/activities to occupy my time. Still love photography.  I could dust off my higher end camera and gear. There are a few landscaping ideas bouncing around my head for our property. Gardening (flowers and vegetables) are always a passion. I wouldn’t mind trying pottery, if I can find a local class. I would like to do some volunteer work…poll watcher during elections would be interesting. Helping out with trail maintenance would be satisfying and a way to give back. Fishing and hunting have been in my post retirement agenda for a long time. With the addition of another dog in a few months, a good bit of time will be consumed.


I didn’t get on trail until around 1230 today, so mileage would be low. My legs felt great and the terrain was like a walk in the park.  Very few steep changes and relatively flat. Looking at the map for tomorrow, looks the same. I hope to knock out some miles (about 18) to the next shelter. I don’t want to be necessarily tied to shelter locations, but they do have the advantage of an actual structure and a water source. Earlier today on the hike, when I knew I would be getting to the shelter early (about 430), I looked at the map and my App and was leaning towards going an additional 4 miles to a tent area near a creek. However, darkening clouds and thunder convinced me otherwise. Within a mile of the shelter, it started raining. Luckily, I have quick dry clothes and little hair. I have a backpacking umbrella and I deployed it a little too late to make much of difference. It works well if (1) there aren’t too many bushes to bump against and (2) you get it out before the downpour. 


Given my late start on the trail due to my back injury and the most recent week off, the chances of getting to Katahdin, Maine, before they shut down access to the mountain for the winter are dwindling. This assessment is for a traditional south to north trek. Faster hikers would probably have fewer concerns. What I may have to do is leapfrog ahead to get up to Maine in time, and then go back to unfinished areas. Ann Marie suggested, and I think it’s a great idea, to skip Shenandoah National Park, and continue on. It’s only a little over 100 miles of trail, but it could be one of several options. Then I could back to the park in October/November and hike when it’s cooler and the leaves are turning. I may have to take similar actions on other areas to accelerate trek to Maine. Maybe skip New York and Connecticut, begin again in Massachusetts northward. Go back to NY and CT afterwards. I have time to consider my options and perhaps my pace will be sufficient. 


Someone asked about meals/diet. It had evolved a little over time. Breakfast now consists of either carnation instant breakfast with a little whey protein powder added and a coffee packet, or granola cereal with the same additions. I had oatmeal, but I decided that heating up the oatmeal was time consuming in the morning. It is even more important to get on trail sooner in the summer heat. I don’t have a lunch, per se. I snack on various nuts (pistachios, almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds, cashews and walnuts) and bars (Kind, RX, Bobos, Stinger waffles, fig bars, snickers). For hydration, I’ve been using Propel. A little more variety with dinner. Ramen noodles, tuna or chicken packets, instant rice with dehydrated beef, couscous with dehydrated pinto beans, or dehydrated beef mixed with dehydrated pinto beans and instant potatoes. Other snacks and items to compliment dinner include beef sticks and nut butter (almond or peanut) with honey. When I am in town or at a hostel, I try to eat more non trail food. I generally crave pizza, burgers, pasta, Cape Cod chips, bagels, sandwiches, salads, coke, orange juice, hot coffee, lots of ice cold ice water. 


It’s after 8pm and getting dark. This is only my 2nd night actually spent in a shelter.The first was during the biblical, multi-day deluge of rain. Still too early  l sleep, not that I’m a solid sleeper anyway. By the way, I slept great at home. I did wake up on the middle of the night some times, but getting back to sleep was easy. I enjoyed not being on get on trail mode and getting up for coffee and taking Guinness out and feeding her. Like I said earlier, tomorrow is an 18 mile day. My plan for the next few days is to keep doing 17 mile+ days.","Mountain Harbour B&B/Hostel

My longest hike to date. It wasn’t exactly planned. My initial intent was a shelter at about 18 miles. However, I got on trail at 7am and got to the shelter at around 3pm. Spending five hours or so waiting for sunset wasn’t appealing. My legs felt good, the weather was ideal, the terrain wasn’t too hard and I was motivated. The plan was to get to this hostel tomorrow by mid day, pick up my resupply, charge my devices, have lunch and get back on trail and do a few more miles. Instead, I had a pizza for dinner and a soda, took a very long, refreshing shower, and now I’m comfy in my tiny bunk. They serve a continental breakfast as part of the charge—coffee, donuts, cereal, milk and fruit. I’d rather have a pound of scrambled eggs and an equal amount of bacon, but for $30, can’t be choosy.

Despite the nice bunk, I woke up in the wee hours of the morning and remained awake for almost two hours. I think it has less to do with the trail life and more to do with simply getting older. 
The trail started out with views of Watauga Lake. Nice lake nestled in the mountains. Its less than 40 miles away from Boone. Will have to come back. A shortage of views once I got up in elevation. I was hoping for vistas of the lake, but trees blocked it out . 
Another night sleeping in a shelter. There’s plenty of room (three others) and there’s a chance of rain. I don’t feel like packing up a wet tent.

I’ve mentioned the phrase trail magic before, but the definition merits repeating. It’s when an individual or group decide to provide free food and/or drink to hikers. It’s usually where the trail crosses a road. Today I experienced such a nice gesture twice. That doubles the number of times I’ve received trail magic since I started. With the first, I got a pan cooked tortilla with pepperoni, mozzarella and sauce; a soda and some candy. I sat for 30 minutes (in a chair) and chatted. The 2nd was six miles later and consisted of two grilled hot dogs and ice cold water. In both cases, the individuals were there from a church.  One couple have a daughter who is in the USAF and she was stationed at Beale AFB. She said she worked with the U-2 spy plane doing intel work. She got there two years after we had left. At the other location, their presence was primarily to offer food and drink to motorcyclists who were part of their  church and were riding this section of the road. They said they had more hikers stop than bikers. I showed them the App I use for hiking and they are going to start using it to let hikers know when they will be there to provide food and drink. Very nice. 
Two other backpackers told me that in Virginia I’ll probably see more trail magic on the weekends near trail towns. Some go all out, grilling food for hikers. Can’t wait! Amazing how much I think about food while on the trail. I have had many a conversation with a fellow hiker about food. 
I plan on performing such magic next year for hikers. I need to select a location where there is a bit of a dead zone for resources (town not too close) where the trail intersects a road. If anyone is interested in contributing to my fund to feed the hikers, let me know. I’ve been mulling over what food and drink to provide and how long to stay. 
I came upon this beautiful bit of rolling pasture land right after the first  trail magic stop. The owners allowed the trail to go right thru. I took a number of photos. There’s a wooden bench that overlooks a fantastic view. 
I saw a fawn this morning soon after getting on trail. It was right alongside the trail.Before sunset last night, another hiker saw a fawn a short distance behind the shelter. 
I’m tenting tonight. Less than 200 yards before I got to the shelter, I saw a rattlesnake adjacent to the trail. Stopped me in my tracks. It was tough to see, hidden amongst the weeds. It wasn’t too happy to look see me. See if you can see it in the photo.

Abingdon Gap Shelter to Damascus: 7 miles 
Milestone day. Left Tennessee behind and now in Virginia, the longest state on the trail, over 530 miles of trail. 
No photo ops, except for the border sign. I made sure I didn’t turn on the afterburners to get into town. That’s how I got my shin splints—rushing downhill at a fast clip is a recipe for shin splints. 
I tented last night as the shelter didn’t look appealing. The temps were great, though I still woke up a bit humid. At one point, I got out of my sleeping bag and slept in the sleeping bag liner, a thin cocoon of silk. Feels like buttah’. I had a heart stopping moment in the morning while packing up. I thought I lost my Garmin. I went back to the privy, thinking it dropped out of my pocket. Just kidding. It’s Tennessee—they don’t have privies. It was a tree. A fellow hiker saw it hanging from my umbrella. Unfortunately, he is a former Marine. I know. There are no former Marines. I think he said he served 8 years, but you would have thought he was a lifer. He had the persona, but the physique of a navy chief. Inside baseball jab. 
I made to town by and Ann Marie scored me a great B&B.  The proprietor completed the hike in 2019 and decided to leave Minneapolis and open a B&B, catering to hikers. I walked into the smell of brownies. I share a bathroom with others (though it’s not even close to being full), but have my own room (queen bed). I used one of her bicycles to putz around town—lunch, outfitter, grocery. While I was out, she did my laundry. Breakfast is included in the price. 
Tomorrow I am slackpacking. I believe this may be a new term for everyone. Essentially, you leave most of your gear behind (usually including your pack) and use a day pack (provided by the hostel owner or shuttle service) and load up the essentials for a day hike. The shuttle will pick me up at the B&B and take me north of town, about 20 miles on a Forest Service road. I’ll hike south back to town to spend another night at the hostel. Longer miles with less effort. The following day, shuttle back to where I started, and head north again. Winner. Winner. Chicken dinner. Rather than trail food tomorrow on the slack, I think I’ll stop at Subway tonight, get a sandwich and have them wrap it up good. Leave it in the fridge at the B&B and take it with for lunch/brunch. If I were to hike out of Damascus heading north, the trail makes a steady climb for several miles.

Ordinarily, when I am at a location for two days, the plan is to take a zero. However, I kept to the plan I described previously. I didn’t rush on trail, nor did I linger. With the except of the views from the drop off location and river views, views were the normal trees and …..trees.
I ran into over probably over 50 hikers on the trail. I talked to a few, most of who section hiking. There was a large contingent of teenage boys with adults resting at one area. All the hikers were taking the death March north.  So glad I went south. That and the day pack made it easier. Not easy, as it was still over 20 miles and quite humid. 
The infection in my toe is coming back to life. It’s not as widespread as before, but it still hurts. I tried draining it last night but the needle I have isn’t sharp enough. There is a pharmacy close by that opens at 9am. I’ll see if I can find something there before I get back on trail. There isn’t an urgent care facility nearby, but there is a family health center in town. I may call them. My guess is that I may need more antibiotics. I want to get back on trail today, but I also need to fix this problem. On the same problem foot, I also developed a corn on the inside of my fourth toe. I seldom get these. The timing could be better. 
I mentioned in a previous post my frustration with getting dinner last night. For a trail and tourist-dependent town, they aren’t very accommodating. If you want to open a mediocre restaurant, this town has potential. You will be successful if you do one thing—stay open past 8pm. And for the love of god, don’t run out of food. How do you let that happen?
It’s 3am as I write this entry. I woke up around 2am the previous night. Progress. 
A thru hiker who I have crossed paths with before showed up here today. She’s the one lugging a 45lb pack. I want to ask what’s in it, but they would be rude. It’s not a tent, because she is a hammock person and they are comparatively light. She told me the night before she stayed on trail, at a campsite (not a shelter area) and a bear paid a visit. Nothing happened, but I always think “bear burrito” when I see a hammock. 
The plan (if I can get it together, and find some resolution to the toe issue) is to get on trail by noon at the latest and do about 12 miles to a shelter just north of Grayson Highlands State Park. It’s famous for its views and the wild ponies. 
I’m going to try and get back to sleep now. Cheers","Damascus

Delay this morning getting back on trail. The toe infection is coming back. I went to the local clinic on Damascus, but with the nasty thunderstorm we had, their computers are down and power is interrupted. So, I had to get a shuttle to Abingdon..about a 15 minute drive. Waiting in a patient room right now for a physician to have a look. I don’t want to have to do this again, but letting it go, while on trail, in less than sterile conditions, could be a recipe for an even worse outcome. It was hurting yesterday on trail and last night in bed. 
I thought I had a solution to my watch issues—dead battery. I found the appropriate battery and the B@B owner had the small screwdriver. After taking it apart twice (first time, no power) , I had to surrender. The contact leads to one of the buttons no longer works, no matter what I do. The cheap Timex Ironman lasted a long time.
Update: saw the doctor. More antibiotics, and something for the immediate pain. The clinic sent the script to my pharmacy in Boone. Another delay. On the upside, I got a great deal on a watch. A $40 watch rang up for $10. I let them know and they couldn’t figure it out. Maybe someone is telling me to relax, slow down.
While waiting on my shuttle ride back to town, I decided to skip the dash to get to the trail. The B&B had an open bed in a hostel room (call it steerage class; this room has 5 single beds). The last two nights I had the only single room. No problem. Clean sheets, electricity, a/c, indoor plumbing, a great breakfast. The shuttle is scheduled to pick me up at 830. 
Shooting for about 18 miles tomorrow. That’ll take me thru Grayson Highlands State Park and the ponies. Looking forward to seeing them and the supposed stellar views. The weather up in the mountains looks good—high of 80 degrees, partly cloudy. Here in Damascus for tomorrow, a high of 92. The elevation here is about 1900 ft. Grayson is over 4,400 ft. My next resupply is about 50 miles from where I left off and is an alpaca farm and hostel. My arrival time and how I feel will dictate whether I stay or push on. Regardless, I want to see the alpacas. 
I really felt like a drink tonight—cold beer, cocktails. Closed. Back to Subway. I stopped at a gas station to consider getting beer, but their selection was not to my liking. Not a Bud, PBR, Coors fan. Oh well. Close out the day. Tomorrow is a new day…clean slate. Good night.","Damascus

The day started off with my last breakfast at Lady Di’s B&B. She made restaurant quality breakfast. The shuttle driver dropped me off at the trail, where I left off previously. The trail took me through Grayson Highland State Park, the highlight being the wild ponies. The views didn’t disappoint either. 
I’m undecided on how far I plan to hike tomorrow.  I have have a four supply of food and about 32 miles to my next resupply. I don’t plan on slowing down to burn through/eat my food. I have to keep a long daily trek (17+ miles) if I want to get this done.","Whitetop Road

Put in some long miles today. The planets aligned: got a relatively early start (7am), the terrain was favorable, the  weather was mostly good (a short mid-morning and early afternoon shower), I had the energy to try and I was willing to do it. The showers worked out for two reasons. First, it did cool things off for a while. Second, while it was raining, the gnats (or whatever they are) didn’t assault my ears and eyes. They attempted several suicide runs directly into my eyes. 
I remembered an encounter several days ago (it’s becoming a blur) back in the Laurel Falls area. A woman who was out of her car asked me if I had an ice. I was dumbfounded by her question. I said I was backpacking, as of the thing on my back didn’t give it away. She had insulin and a small ice chest and it appeared that her ice had melted. Then she asked if I thought putting the insulin in the nearby creek would help. I have no idea. 
Waterfalls were the dominant feature today. 
Partnership shelter should be one of the best ones in Virginia. It might actually get top prize, except for one thing. You see, they have an actual shower and wash basin. The shelter is very close to the road and a US Forest Service building. However, they’ve disabled both. Someone told me that it’s a COVID thing. Makes no sense, but it’s the federal government. On the plus side, they do have a toilet (pit type) with a door. The nearby building has an outdoor spigot and a water fountain. You can also do food deliver with a local pizza joint, which I did. The pizza was meh, but hey, it’s pizza in the woods. They messed up my salad order, so I picked at it. I’m a coke guy and they are Pepsi. Again, in the woods. 
Last night it was a bit warm for a while, so I slept on top of my liner and sleeping bag, just in my boxers. Eventually, it cooled off and I added my shirt and slipped into the silk sleeping bag liner (oh so soft). Tonight looks to be the same. Before I forget. Tonight is the first night I’ve seen lightning bugs. 
Good night.","Old Orchard Shelter

It’s currently 430am. One of the most restless nights of sleep to date. I am staying in the shelter, not tenting. It’s one of nicest shelters I’ve seen. Part of the problem may be the noise. This close to civilization and the sounds of nature could be disturbing my rest. I think there is a pond close by, as I heard the almost incessant noise of frogs. Ordinarily, I would find it relaxing, but not now. At times, I’d hear an owl hooting. Very nice. Earlier, there was the sound of distant thunder. 
Had the shelter to myself. There were three other thru hikers at my last shelter, but they didn’t plan on getting here until Friday. They seemed nice enough, but relating was hard. They were 20-something gamer-types. They were discussing a game in gamer lingo and I asked about the game—Dungeons & Dragons. I never got into such things. 
I have a food resupply pickup today at a hostel about 11 miles north of here. I thought it was closer.  The plan is to get the food, and if I can take a shower, have a snack, and recharge my electronics. Some hostels will let you use their facilities for a small fee if you don’t intend to stay. I looked at my camping options for the evening and see a potential issue. For a few miles after the hostel, there are water sources. However, there are also cow pastures. I read some comments on my App about the the water and a few mentioned the cow smell and expressed concerns about the water being tainted. I have a water filter that should work, but it still gives me concerns. Intestinal issues on trail would be brutal. I could hike beyond this area, but i don’t want back to back marathon-ish hikes. Plus the time at the hostel is time clicking away at daylight . I may have to play it by ear. See how long I am there and ask the hostel owners about the water. I don’t see me making it to the next shelter.  It’s another 15 from the hostel. That would be a 26 mile day. 
I decided to stay the night at the hostel. I made it to the hostel in decent time, but getting to town to mail some stuff back home and going to the outfitter took more time. The outfitter was necessary because my cook system was having problems with a good seal between the burner and the fuel canister. Too much gas was coming out while I was screwing it on.  I got a new fuel canister and viola, problem solved. 
On the way back to town at around 4pm, the sky opened up, reinforcing my decision to end today’s hike. It was a hard, cold rain at that. I have the bunk room with one other person. Nice person to talk to. 
Today’s highlight on trail was an old one-room school room that dates back to 1894.Off trail, the alpacas at the hostel. Strange looking creatures.
The next resupply stop is in Pearisburg, VA, about 80 miles. I’m giving myself 5 days to do this—5 days of food. My food bag is the heaviest item in my bag and I’m trying to somehow reduce the weight while still feeding myself enough.

This was one long day of hiking. Passed thru a couple of fields/meadows that were beautiful. Some had cattle grazing, or as I might say, “future trail magic burgers.” 
Near the end of the day, I began to get a bit depressed, missing home and family. For the first time, I listened to some music on my iPhone. That did the trick.
Chestnut Knob Shelter’s views were spectacular. It overlooks a valley with stellar views. The shelter itself was completely enclosed (four walls) and a door. There were multiple bunks within. Good thing, as it was a bit cold last night.","Long Neck Lair Hostel

Today’s goal was much less ambitious—under 16 miles. I was tempted to go to a more distant shelter, but that would have been almost 26 miles and I did 24 yesterday. Plus, this stop sets me up for a 20 mile tomorrow at a shelter. 
Around 11am today, at a road crossing, I (really we, as I was hiking in the vicinity of the group of people I sheltered with last night) came across trail magic. Homemade BBQ in homemade bread with chips and a coke. So goody. I so much appreciate this service.
I made it to the camp site with     plenty of time to spare. I soaked my feet in an ice cold stream for quite a while. Had a comparatively early dinner and talked for a while with my fellow hikers. A new term for you—tramily. It means trail family. Some people hike together in groups. The bonds may be loose or very tight, meaning they wait for each other if one falls behind, or they may go at their own paces and meet at a shelter or camp spot. I am not in such a group. I prefer to go at my pace and make decisions that are best for me. The people I am currently around are a tramily.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Three  noteworthy things on today’s episode. First, I hit the 600 mile mark. Largely symbolic when you put it in context. Second, one of my hiking sticks bought the farm, meaning broke. Not literally, mind you. It’s the kind that fold down into three segments. An inner shaft section piece that connects the pole segments no longer works. Regardless, I was fortunate that this didn’t happen further from civilization. That relates to number three…a diner/resupply right off trail (mere steps) in Bland, VA, near I-77.
At the diner, I had a burger, fries and coke, followed up by a sizable portion of ice cream.    From the outside, you wouldn’t think good food, but the food was great. I had great cell reception and called a shuttle service for a ride to a outfitter to get a new set of poles. Before you ask, one can hike with one pole, but I wouldn’t recommend it. You’ll be off balance when they are needed, and out here, that is often. Plus, you’ll put a disproportionate amount of pressure on one side of your body. Ok for a day hike, but try that for weeks. The closest outfitter is back in Marion, a 45 minute ride ($$$). Luck or God looked out for me, as the shuttle I called was a former owner of an outfitter who got rid of his brick and mortar,  still sells to hikers at lower rates. He sold me a pair and delivered them to me, at a discount. I didn’t have to spend the time and money traveling back south.","Campsite VA615

This is both summer solstice and hike naked day. Fortunately, I saw no such hiking. 
I got an early start to the day—7am. However, it didn’t seem to help with the feeling that it would ever end. After about 7miles, I took a slight 1/2 mile detour up a road to a gas station/store/diner and got yet another burger and soda. Not many options at such places. Then onward and very much upward. I made another 1/3 mile to Dismal Falls. So nice to watch the water cascade down the rocks. Even better was a liberal dousing of cold water on my face and head. From there, it was a brutal death march up a steep hill for at least 2 miles. The hill was strewn with rocks and roots, which so added to the comfort of my newly acquired shin splints on my left leg, sore right big toe and fourth right toe with a corn. I hope I am drawing a good enough picture to characterize how my mood devolved. Oh, let’s not forget the no-see-ums flying around my ears and into my eyes. The joys of stubbing my toes against roots and rocks! Psychology, I was spent, as well. I miss my family and I don’t recall the last time I had a decent night sleep. Physically, mentally and emotionally drained. I’m not ashamed to say I cried for a bit. 
I made it to the hostel by 7pm..a 12 hour day. They provided dinner—salad, pasta, and bread.Bless you. I was supposed to sleep in the bunkhouse, but I am so worn out (see above comments) that the thought of interacting with another person turned me off. I got a single room in the main house. Take a kidney if you want in exchange. I am currently soaking my feet in hot water to ease the discomfort. No epsom salt available. I am going to bed, with hopes of a restful night.

I also bought another small battery bank just for the phone. I have  found that in the later half of the day I sometimes get melancholy. Music seems to be a good distraction, but it also drains the phone battery faster. The additional weight  penalty for the battery bank is worth it. 
My sleep was better last night, but I woke up at 5am and couldn’t get back to sleep. I took some Tylenol PM to assist. I don’t want to make a habit of it, but my own battery needs a recharge.

Today’s hike was a bit on the brutal side. The distance was manageable, but the rocks were unrelenting. Two significant climbs and descents. If you were to look at the elevation profile you would think that the level plateaus would be a nice break. Wrong. An endless sea of rocks that are dying to trip you up and stub you toes. For one climb, it was a half mile of rock-strewn steep incline with no break. 
An odd sight today were several goats on the trail. I suspect they managed to find their freedom and have made a home. 
I got to the shelter at 630pm. Enough time to eat and prepare for bed. Tomorrow will be a longer day…about 22 miles. Please keep the rocks to a minimum.

I had what one might  call a religious experience. My shin splints and feet have been killing me, and today was no exception. I was a mile or so south of Dragon’s Tooth, an iconic location. A few minutes before I slipped and fell on all fours. It had started sprinkling, getting the never ending sea of rocks slippery. I let out a loud  curse word in frustration. I approached this steep climb and stopped, staring at it for what seemed like an eternity. At that moment,  looking at the collection of rocks I had to navigate, I simply said “I need help. Please help me.” Then I cried. I middle-aged man staring up at rocks and, I hoped, God. I can’t recall too many times in my life when  I felt so …..I still can’t come up with words to accurately articulate the moment. I did get up there and continued on, occasionally crying, asking for help, sometimes out loud. When I saw day hikers approaching, I would turn my back like I was looking at the view. I couldn’t let anyone see me in this state. I know if someone asked if I was ok, I would simply melt into a heap of tears and snot. 
I made it to a local gas station/eatery and had two burgers and a coke. The cashier was  kind enough to give me a ziplock bag so I could fill it with ice for my feet. I talked with a fellow thru hiker who was also there for a break. We talked about the self doubt that creeps in and the need to talk to someone who is going thru this, as well. Neither of us are a part of a tramily. They can lean on each other.  I bought some water (the water from their sink was disgusting) and charms blow pops.  He had warned me about the water but got it anyway. I filled up my bottles and gave him the rest…and a blow pop. They seem to simply things, somehow. I wished him well and took off. Like me, he was trying to get energy to move.
Later on the trail, I looked on the App to discover that the water source at the shelter had dried up. What to do? I was coming to a road intersection. I could try and hitch a ride (about a mile) back to the store and hitch back. But, it was about 530pm and who knows my chances. Maybe there will finally be some trail magic at the parking lot of the junction. I got to the junction. No magic to be found. But there are cars, and an RV. The back of the RV was open. I hate asking for help. I always have. But I needed water. The lady gladly gave me cold water to take with me. Grateful is an understatement.

The day started off with hiking a mile back to the road to give the shuttle driver my backpack (minus a few items for the day) and borrow a day pack. The two major views along the route were McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliff’s. Though there were some more rugged sections, overall the trail was forgiving. My feet appreciated that, though I did manage to jam my toes against rocks and roots. That’s a special kind of pain. One of the reasons I’m chucking my shoes for something sturdier—another task that requires a car. 
It’s so much easier hiking with a lighter load. Early on, I crossed paths with a couple day hikers, one of whom had thru hiked last year. He gave me a soda for the hike. So tasty when I stopped at McAfee. 
Luckily, I decided to bring my poncho, despite the shuttle driver’s weather prediction of no rain. A steady rain for a few hours. 
McAfee was just incredible. I’ll let the photos speak for me.  Side note: Though it’s a bit early, I found some blackberries on the trail to eat. I hope to continue seeing these tasty treats
I failed to mention previously that I hit the 700 mile mark yesterday . 
My plans for the remainder of the day were a bit ambitious and were predicated on getting the rental car. The shuttle driver arrived shortly after I reached the road intersection. Alas, the rental agency has closed by the time I got there. My plan was car then urgent care followed by shopping for miscellaneous items (foot care, food, cleaning supplies for gear,etc).
