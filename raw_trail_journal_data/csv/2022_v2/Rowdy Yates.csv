Rowdy Yates,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647451,"It has been a long time since I have been able to step foot onto the A.T. due to physical reasons and family responsibilities. About 5 years ago I had a partial knee re[lacement, and it did really well, as a matter of fact, a friend and I went to the Nantahala Mountains in N.C. to do an overnight hike but by the time we got to the top of the mountain, we found ourselves in a blizzard (snow and blowing wind). Neither of us were prepared for this, so we turned back and returned home. Then, not long after that, my precious wife had a bad fall, severely injuring her pelvis, and now she has progressive dementia. Hopefully, I can get this knee repaired early this year.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Tue",0
Rowdy Yates,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647482,"For anyone who has followed my previous Journals, you may remember that I had a partial knee replacement in 2017. This surgery was so successful that in 2019, a friend and I went into the backwoods of the Nantahala Mountains and began a hike up to the A.T. via Timber Ridge Trail. It was very windy the day that we set out from the start point on Nantahala Creek, and the more we climbed, the windier it got and the heavier the snow. Just a mile or so before connecting with the A.T. we determined that we really wasn't prepared for this severe weather, so we turned back and returned home to Tennessee. The knee performed superbly until this year when I slipped on the first snowfall, twisted the knee or something, now I am having constant pain. My health care is provided by the VA, and they will be making x-rays and determining what needs to be repaired, so I can hopefully return to do another section or two of this Wonderful Journey.   Have a blessed and safe day, and if you are on The Trail, hike on!",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Wed",0
Rowdy Yates,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647543,"The last time I was privileged to walk on the A.T. I had to abort my hike due to a bad fall. My ankle turned under me when I stepped over a log and threw me off to my left and down a steep grade toward a roaring creek below. I managed to crawl back up the grade onto the Trail and get to my feet, but back and hip were in much pain. I had left the Vanderventer Shelter ahead of my hiking companions with the intent of meeting them at the next shelter before descending into Damascus. It was raining really hard as I was hiking and there was sign of any let up, so when I got to Low Gap, VA., I called for a shuttle and aborted. That leaves me the section between Low Gap and Damascus to do, then skip ahead to Johns Creek Valley for a continued effort North.
   Enough of my ramblings. Enjoy your hike, but be careful and safe! Rowdy Yates",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Fri",0
