James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648723,"Sup everyone.  What's it been days, weeks, months, I can't tell anymore?  Hope to type more in detail tomorrow at the hostel on a keyboard but wanted to give everyone an update.  
I went really hard and pushed long miles my first 5 days.
1 - Approach to Stover shelter 12 miles
2 - Stover to Gooch shelter 13 miles
3 - Gooch to Neel gap 15 miles
4 - Neel to Low gap shelter 12 miles
5 - Low to Cheese factory tenting 14 miles
I thought this would be the hardest thing I have attempted and it turns out it's even harder than I imagined.  But its also very rewarding.  Climbing up and down mountains all day with 30lbs on your back takes everything out of you.  
Right now my left knee is really sore and I am using my trecking poles to take most of the weight off it.  The trail taught me a valuable lesson - You need to slow down and appreciate this or you'll never make it.  It's a much younger demo out here than I thought which I'm not thrilled about.  I've tried to post more pics but ther are larger than the site allows.  I'll change to a lower rez and post some.  Happy trails my friends.","

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649177,"Sup friends, family and neighbors.  I am now 109 miles left GA and now in NC.  The weather was really cold the last 2 days so I am taking my first day off to relax and refresh.  Yesterday was really rainy and I almost fell on my ass several times.  The tread on my Nikes was about all wore out and I picked up a new pair of Hokas at the outfitter.  They said they were the most similar to what I was wearing.  Probably gonna try the Altra lone peaks after I wear these out.  They are much flatter and less cushion so I need to strengthen my feet first.
I was telling the story about putting in my 2 week notice at work and I said ""duces I am going backpacking for around six months"" and then Duces became my trail name.  My football # was 22, I like calling duces wild in poker, 22/24 oz cans over 12 and we are the AT class of 20""22"" so I think I'll keep it.
It's crazy to think I am only 1/20th into this adventure.  I just try to plan 5 days into the future and keep my food supplied.  Planning an doing 40 miles to Stecoah gap and resupplying then so I really only need 4 days of food.  
If I am sore I might stay at Wolf Creek hostle.  It's only like $30 for a bed, shower, laundry and shuttle to/from Stecoah gap.  Plus the comments on FarOut give it good reviews.  So I'll be going from mile 109 to 150 with a total ascent of 12,566 ft and descent of 13,064 and that averages 502 feet per mile.  
After I resupply there it's only 15 miles until I enter the Great Smokey Mt National Part.  I am pretty excited for that.  The trail is starting to turn more green with the recent rain.  No cool animal sightings to report.  Actually slept in a shelter for the first time because I knew it was going to rain and didn't want to pack a wet tent in the rain.  Heard mice scurrying around the shelter and chewing on stuff the whole night.  One little bastard chewed a little whole in my hip pocket looking for snacks but it was empty.  Now I leave the pockets unzipped to save them the trouble of chewing their way in.  I'll try to upload some pics and will try to post again on Saturday.","Chika and Sunsets

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649465,"So I randomly have signal from Locus cove gap where I am tenting so I figured I'd give an update.  Today was the hardest and warmed day so far.  Had a 4k ascent over a 9 mile period I took so many breaks to stop the legs from burning.  
My knee had been slowly getting better over a couple day period so I decided to walk a couple miles without the brace.  BIG MISTAKE.  I probably only went 2 miles and put it right back on.  It's gonna stay on at least until I'm through the smokies before I even consider taking it off.  
So do yall want pics of the ugly or just the awesome views, people and sights?  Do you also want the blisters, calluses, bug bites, rashes, privys (outhouses)?  I can't let you guys go thinking this is some walk in the park so maybe I'll give you a taste.  
Hiker hunger hasnt fully kicked in yet but I am eating so much more than before.  I am hungry from like 9am to 7pm.  Typically ill wake up at 630 with the birds.  Stretch a lil in the tent and force myself out of my warm quilt and into the cool morning with the sunrise.  Right now it takes me around 1 hour from flat on my back with gear everywhere to completely broke down camp and everything organized and in my pack.  Think I can cut that in half with practice.  It's way quicker sleeping in the shelter because I don't have the tent and most of my gear out.  
Going to do 11.8 to Cable gap tomorrow and a short 5.1 to Fontana dam road on Monday.  I'll either have to hitch to town or stay at the Hostel for the free shuttle from the road plus a ride to town to resupply.  I'm almost out of snacks and this will be my last resupply to get all the way through the Smokies.  This will be my longest stretch before I can get food (76 miles) so it will be my heaviest pack yet with 7 days worth of food.  
Pretty exciting!  This will be the first time I switch section of the trail map on Guthook (FarOut) app.  Plus 50% of thruhikers quit before completing the Smokies.  Ive meet a bunch of great people on trail and just a couple that annoy me.  
Well it's 8:30pm which is close to hiker midnight so goodnight yall.  Type ya later.","NOC

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650380,"So next up we are going from Hot Springs NC to Erwin TN.  It's about 70miles so I'm taking 5 days of food but hoping yo get there in 4 but that would be 17.5 miles/day.  Having a really lovely stay th the hostle and was the only guest last night.  Going to head up the street to Smokey Mt Diner for breakfast.  
Back in the Smokies you were only allowed to stay in the shelters or put up a tent/hammock close by.  This forced everyone to sleep at limited places and got to know many hikers.  Some shelters had like 40 people at them.  
Curious to see if this will change now that we are able to tent many places between shelters.  Personally I prefer to sleep in my tent at the shelter locations.  It's nice having access to water, the privy, table to eat on, people to chat with then a quiet place of my own to sleep.  I have slept in a handful of shelters when it's rainy or super cold.  It sucks trying to pack up your gear and break down camp and your tent in the rain.  
Can't wait to hit my first 20mile day.  The first day leaving town is typically the hardest.  Your pack will be at its heaviest full of food and towns are at low elevations so its always a big climb getting back into the mountains.  Leaving Hot Springs it's 11.3 miles to the first shelter with 3,793 feet of ascent.  
I broke the tip off one of my trecking poles a couple days ago and was able to replace them at the outfitter.  They sell replacement tips and it was a pain to get the old ones off but eventually I was successful.  So as I mentioned previously if anyone wants to make donations I'll actually include the info.

Trail days is in Damascus VA from May 13 - 15 and is 195 miles away.  I'd need to average 21 miles per day with no zeros so I don't think I'll make that unless I shuttle in for a day.  
Got rain today and tomorrow then it looks pretty clear for a while.  We'll that's all for now.  I'll post a couple pics and be back when I hit Erwin.","Appalachian Trail-er

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651797,"What up yo!  It's been a while but I have been pushing longer mile days.  15 has become the standard and I hit my first 20!  Which leads to longer hours hiking and fewer time/energy for typing.  
I'm currently (5/24) at mile 470 in Damascus VA.  Taking my first zero since I was here 2 weeks ago for Trail Days.  Had no plans on attending but Roadrunner asked if I would be interested in trying to hitch in which sounded like an adventure.  Had a great time and glad I went.  Watched some cool talks and witnessed trail magic at a scale that was crazy.  
One question I get a lot from non hikers - Is it fun/are you having fun?  The short answer is No, it's really challenging.  However when I decided to thruhike the AT walking 2200 miles with 30lbs on my back over every Mt from Georgia to Maine I didn't think it would be fun.  I thought it sounded like a crazy challenge and I wanted to find out if I was capable.  
I haven't joined a trail family because I'm constantly around groups of people and am cool with many of them.  Some of my closer hikers are Roadrunner, Deluxe, Free Flow, Lone Wolf, ShoPack, Blue, Tucker his dog Dreadbeard, Driftwood, Holiday, Mother Duck, Trashman, Caughdrop and Dragonfly.  
Now that we are +470 miles it's all dedicated thruhikers mixed in with section hikers.  Anyone who wasn't committed to physicl and mental endurance have called it quits.  The majority of us are all doing between 15-20 miles a day.  We play leap frog depending on what time you start hiking, when you take breaks, lunch and fill up water.  On average there around 10+ people at every shelter, several at the tent spots between.  
Next stop is Marion VA to grab a package at the post office and resupply.  Mile 470 - 534 so I'm taking 4 days worth of food but probably have way more than I need.  Gonna hit the Graceland Highlands soon where there are wild ponies.  Hope the weather is nice.  
We've got rain almost everyday for a week but it's cool with me.  I'll take 60° and rain over 85 and sunny all day.  I'm not afraid of the animals or the miles but the sun scares me.  It's the next challenge I'll face.  I'll post some pics for ya.
Oh last and not least.  SPECIAL thanks to those that made a donation.  It meant more to me than just financially.  I'll keep you updated with pics and updates between posting here.  Later yall","Lady D

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652332,"Sup.  Bout to crash in my tent at mile 570.  Did another +20 mile day and doing pretty good.  Have some bluster issues I am treating with leucko tape during the day and tetree oil at night.  Definitely have some chafing on the inner thighs from hiking long sweaty hours.  At some points in the day I just get sticky from sweat coming out of every pour mixing with the dirt and smashed dead bug body parts on my body.  Between the bugs, flies and spiders I'm pretty much covered from my knees down and forearms.  And it's only going to get hotter and more buggy.  Sorry for not posting more but you try coming out here and see how much energy you have at the end of the day.  New stratagie is to do 100 miles per week.  This would have me finishing the week of Sept 18th.  Plus it allows you to walk big miles when weather/ascent are good and less when not ideal.  You could do 5 20mile days and zero for the last 2 while staying on schedule.  This is such an amazing experience.  Without the constant overstimulation of TV, news, commercials, radio, billboards, social media for  55 days my brain feels more calm.  Anyway.  I'm tired and need to sleep.  Type ya later.  Night...","

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652570,"Good morning everyone.  It's 6am and I'm trying you before I get moving.  Stayed at Woods last night.  Super chill place with some amazing vegetarian food.  Dinner/Breakfast are served communal for an extra 15 & 8$ but very worth it.Gonna be a super busy day.  Trying to hike 11 miles then hitch into Pearisburg, hit grocery, eat lunch, hitch back to trail and do another 8 miles.  Might end up doing some night hiking to make the miles.  Other than some blisters I'm in a really good place.  Body feeling good despite not sleeping well on trail.  But I typically get 8+ hours laying in the tent with my eyes closed resting.  Got the clothes and body clean they just didn't have much (all vegetarian) for resupply here.  That's why we have to take a pit stop in town today.  Been tenting with King Kong and Holiday for a several days.  Its kinda nice having a really small trail fam but don't want much/any more.  Just makes things more complicated and limits places you can camp.  They both talk way more than me (shocking right) so I do more listening and laughing.  Yooo I woke up at 5:50 yesterday because we were very close to a rad view from a mountain peak.  I was out there sunning myself on a rock like a snake till 930.  It's Monday June 6th and I'm currently at mile 625!  King Kong and I sat on the 600 mile marker having a safety meeting and cheering hikers as they got to the rocks.  It was super fun and Def gonna do that again.  Next time it would be great to hit the liquor store just prior to the 700 and pass out airplane bottles of liquor to hikers and celebrate.  I'll snap some pics if I do and post a couple while I am here.  Hope you all are enjoying the read and it's entertaining.  The AT is its own universe and I'm just happy to be a part of it.  The further we go the more familiar everyone is becoming.  There is more of a community feeling among hikers out here still pushing miles.  I don't know a single hiker who isn't in some pain or discomfort and all of them feel fortunate to be here.  These first 2 months have FLEW by.  Happy with my progress and can't wait to push even harder.  Plan on hitting my first marathon and 30 mile day this month.  Gonna get hot so looking forward to jumping in more lakes, ponds, rivers.  And I plan on doing more night/evening hiking as the temperature increases.  Well....  Thanks for listening...  That's all for now...  type ya later","

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653118,Hey yall.  Currently 787 miles in Glaslow VA.  The heat has been brutal the past few days.  Which sucks even more because it kills the appatite and I know I need to be eating way more than I am.  I spend most of the day just wet from sweat and sticky.  But there has been so little breeze everything is still damp in the morning.  Did some night hiking 8pm -12 trying to keep making miles.  Its preety fun but you have to go slower then in daylight.  Hit a 25 the other day.  Think I'm ready for a 30 either Sat or Sun.  Now that I'm a couple months in its reached the point of routine.  It's crazy because it feels both like I just started a week ago and I've been out here for months.  Adding night hiking has also added a new tool in my toolbox.  Did a short 4 mile day into town for the usual food laundry shower.  This town has a hiker pavilion with showers electricity and tenting for free.  Hitchhiking is really fun lol.  It was one of the things i was least looking forward to on trail and quickly becoming one of my favorite things.  Ive had the most amazimg luck hutching.  Twice i caught a ride from someone going to the same place and also dropped me back at the same spot after.  Id hitch in and back out of town and some of the hikers were in the same place.  I piged out on town food today trying to make up for lack of appetite on trail.  Laying in my tent at 730 in a food coma.  But at the same time I still want to eat ice cream.  I'm finally capable of consuming so much food.  60 miles until Devils Backbone brewery.  A hiker friendly brewpub that let's you camp on the property.  Then after that it's into Shenandoah national park.  Heard the elevation isn't too bad and frequent places for food so you don't have to carry as much on your back.  That's all for now.  Hope you all are enjoying the journey with me.  Going to post some pics.  Till next time.....,"

Happy to report I'm out of PA and also tenting on the NJ/NY boarder.  The next several states NY CT MA are short and should breeze through then which is great because I want to spend the most time Vermont, NH and Maine.  I am so looking forward those states.  They are unanimously regarded as the most beautiful places to hike.

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656184,"time is a funny concept out here.  We only pay attention to dates other than to hit a post office for sending/receiving packages.  We don't pay attention to time other than make sure I am hiking 12 hours a day.  I can put my pack on and just kinda zone out for 10 hours while trying to cover 20 miles.  You can just get so focused on landing each step softly and on flat ground it takes such focus it helps pass the time quicker.Despite how it seams there is never enough time out here.  Every day i walk for 12 hours, sleep for 8 (well lay down with my eyes closed anyway) and simple math says I have a total of 4 hours left for everything else.  I alternate what time I hike depending on weather and soreness.  But I'll give you a typical day on a 10a-10p schedule.12a - 8am Sleep8am - 9am Wake up, break down camp, deflate mattress, roll up sleeping bags, change out of night clothes and back into hiking gear.  Take down tent.  Organize all gear and put into backpack.  9am - 930am Breakfast.  Get out food bag and cook pot.  Grab 3 cups of filtered water and boil.  Add 3 packets of instant coffee and stir.  Grab instant oatmeal pack and dump in a small amount of water, mix and eat.  Sip coffee while I locate a pop tart in my food bag.  Eat that while I choose what snacks to pull out of my food bag and store in my hip belt pockets for the day.  Clean my spoon, cook pot, food bag and put in backpack.  930am - 10am Maintance.  Brush teeth.  Grab TP and hit privy or go dig a hole.  Purell hands.  Check feet for blisters to see if you need tape or bluster pads.  10am - 10pm Hike.  Get water.  Lunch.  Walk 20 miles.10p - 11p setup camp.  Unload pack.  Setup tent.  Blow up air mattress.  Get out sleeping bag, pillow, setup sleeping.  Change out of wet hiking clothes and into camp clothes.  Setup clothesline to air wet hiking clothes.  11p - 1130p Dinner.  Find dehydrated meal in food bag.  Boil 2 cups water.  Dump into meal.  Stir and wait 15 minutes.  Eat MnMs, jerky and trailmix while you wait.  Eat dinner.1130p - 12a maintance.  Grab TP and privy4 or dig.  Get in tent and check body for ticks. Do a quick wipedown with a baby wipe. Check your feet and put Tea Tree oil on all blisters.  Throw a shot of cortisone on all the new bug bites.  Put a squeeze of neosporin on any new cuts/scrapes.  Gold bond on any sensitive areas that are chafed.  Then massage some prep H into your feet that are both going numb and also burning.  Take a peak on the Farout app to see how bad tomorrow is and how far till water.  Try and sleep 12a - 8a then start again.  It sounds crazy but I barely have any free time.  So while I try to post more I'm always doing something or tired.  Update for everyone.  I'm tenting at mile 1531 leaving a tiny 663 miles left.  Divided by # of days until end of Sept (52) puts me at 12.75 miles per day which is around  where I want to be.  Only 3 out of 14 states left when I leave MA.  70 miles left in MA151 in VT161 in NH 282 in MENight","

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657353,this is the section I have been looking forward to most and the section that is most difficult.  Going from averaging 2 mph to 1 cuts your miles in half.  The ascents are longer taller and rockier than previous.  Some of the descents are sketchy and difficult.  I took a fall on the first Mt and lost a croc I had carabiner'd to my pack.  Didn't notice until setting up camp later that night.  Did Mt Kinsman the other day at night in the rain.  It started raining an hour before sunset when I was close to the top.  Had to climb wet boulders holding trees and roots for balance.  While reaching the peak there were a couple lightning strikes but not super close.  The fog was so bad you could only see like 10 feet with your headlamp.  I was with Holiday who was talking constantly to keep distracted.  We heard a noise in the distance and it ended up being an old dude that lost the trail in the fog.  We got him back on track and firmed a soggy parade to the shelter.  The shelter only had wood tent platforms opposed to dirt.  This makes things way more difficult setting up a non free standing tent.  Later that night setup on one my trekking pole slipped and my tent partially collapsed.  Tired and wet from the hike I said screw it and just went back to sleep.  Dumb move because it rained and my sleeping bag and all my gear was soaked.  Had to get off trail and spend the next day just drying out gear and clothes.  Tomorrow is Franconia ridge.  Pretty excited.  Google it if you want.  Night,"

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658510,"Yo Maine is beautiful.  You should visit here.  It's gorgeous and looks like an enchanted Forrest in the woods.  There are so many colors and variety of mushrooms.  Everything is covered in moss and looks like you should see Nomes living in tree trucks.  
The 100 mile wilderness was the most amazing part of the trail.  It was both the remote and gorgeous.  The stars were amazing and the weather was perfect.
In Maine they just leave kayaks and row boats laying around lakes and ponds for public use.  Had the pleasure of floating around on one.  I did finish the trail submitting Mt Katadin 10/1.  It was one of the most difficult climbs of the trail with several times you needed to pull yourself up using steel bars drilled into rocks.  I camped at the Birches campsite which is around 6 miles from the summit then you have to hike back down.  It took around 7 hours round trip then would have needed to walk an additional 6 to where I was staying but got a hitch from another hikers BF.  
Still collecting my thoughts about the whole experience and I might post about them later.  Might spend a day or 2 in Acadia national park because I havnt been camping in a while and the weather is perfect.  But everything is so expensive it's gonna be difficult.  
I'll post some pics of Maine and my Summit while I let the whole journey settle.

James Speigal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658886,"Now that I finished weeks ago I doubt anyone will be back here looking for updates so I feel free to be very open.  There are a couple philosophies everyone goes by on trail.
Embrace the suck -  its gonna be too cold, too hot, too much rain, too many bugs, not enough water, very difficult.  Your toes, feet, ankles, knees, hips and back are gonna be sore.  You will be miserable, sad, tired, dehydrated, malnourished and exhausted.  The sooner you Embrace the suck and accept it the better your chances of succeeding.
Hike your own hike -  Everyone is out their for their own reasons.  You can be a ""purist"" and hit every single white blaze.  You can skip some miles if it's too difficult of a section or for deadlines.  You can go the whole way or quit whenever you want.  It's your hike, do it the way you want.
You get the hike you need not the hike you want - you can plan all you want but the trail and weather will have the last word.  
I knew that when I finished the trail I would not be the same person who started the trail.  I did not know the exact specifics and still figuring them out.  I thought the trail would make me more of a morning person and more social.  But I ended up night hiking a good portion of the trail and stealth camping.  The trail didn't make me into a person I'm not, it confirmed what I already knew while exposing things I wasn't seeing.
Life without tv, radio, internet and constant stimulation was so peaceful and calming.  Its something we are all so used to we don't even realize how the endless overstimulation is affecting us.  But upon reentry into real life its very overwhelming.  
Transitioning back isn't easy and I'm still adjusting.  People would ask if I was glad to be back and I would say no.  Sure I was happy to see my family and friends but it felt like I entered a tornado.  Without a car, job, income or white blazes and beaten path to guide me I was lost.  My first day back in Ohio I pitched my rent in my brother's back yard and didn't even go home.  I was desperately clinging to how I had been living not ready for the journey to be over.
I missed hiking, being outside, Holiday, my tent, climbing mountains, the calm and the life I had been living on trail.  I needed time to process and space to let it sink in.  
The trail has made me more confidant in myself and taking on inconceivable tasks.  I basically started with zero backpacking experience and figured it out on the way.  We are all more capable than we think.  The trail opened up a desire to explore, to experience, to wander, to see the world and the courage to take chances.  
I have endless thanks to the strangers who helped with trail magic and my family and friends who are supporting my return.  I have debt to pay off, people to thank and favors to return and a giant world to continue exploring.  I'll post one final ""before and after"" pic of a person i barely recognize.
