    It's definitely going to happen. Tomorrow morning I leave for Harper's ferry West Virginia.  I'm going to go through Columbus and pick up my daughter Mary and  Drop her off in Canton Ohio . I'm feeling very fortunate to be able to take this trip  And I'm very excited.
   Quick shout out to my buddy fiddy in West Carrollton.He got very good news today from his oncologist and he is  remaining very optimistic. Awesome..
    So the pack weight came out to be 27 lbs.
 This seems to be too good to be true. That includes 4 days of food and 2 liters water . I guess the differences is in this heat I'm not really carrying much  In the way of clothes.
   So the next time you hear from me I will be headed for the trail actually on Thursday morning . I'll try to make an entry tomorrow night from the road ode if I have a signa

Got into the National Park at 9 o'clock did my paperwork and strings pick me up 9 15 and I hit the trail  at 10:30.  He's a very interesting character and had a good ride . We talk the whole way. Seem to have a lot in common. He remembered me from past shuttles and also remembered Bob when he was a ridge runner.
So the walking today was pretty slow going I stopped quite a bitAs soon as I would get going I had the issues with where my next water was going to be. So I wasn't sure how far I was gonna go where I was gonna get water anyway I stopped and stealth camped at 4:30 took a nice nap and here I am it's been an awesome day it's beautiful Out here.
   I did receive a call while I was having a snack it was from Hannah in Sheffield England.She was over at her Nonnie ,and I also got to tell her hello. She look great and next time I'm there I definitely look forward to that spaghetti.  Hannah is pretty excited about going to University of Liverpool in September. I can't say that I blame her .  It will be awesome.
        Well I've had my dinner I had my coffee I've got my food bag hung up in the tree and It's about time to wrap things up here I plan on getting up very early 430 to be exact and get some miles in before it gets too hot out here. So that's all for now thank you folks.

   No Internet there last night . morning got up at 4:45 start walking at 5:30 there was 7 miles to Caledonia state park. Although water was not marked on the guide I walked into town town to a church 3/4 of a mile and got water out of a hose garden hose. I do remember that taste from childhood days. So I got up to Cal doing a state park and there was a Creek running right through it that the trail went right over so whatever the lesson May be there I'm not sur. All just the same I still got my water. Got some miles done early so the afternoon was slow and easy. So I was Able to enjoy the day actually A-day dream. Met some folks here at the shelter and one of them was an Oh Hell player. Too bad we didn't have any cards. So it was off to the tent to get an early start.

Somewhat of a vortex there I will stay there 2 and a 1/2 hours when in the store twice bought more junk than I needed but it Was good it was there with 3 true hikers. I finally decided to leave there I went through the museum signed in there and saw that but the heat was the element of the afternoon of the afternoon so I took my time coming down to the shelter or another 7 miles. Had dinner I'm set up and It's acting like we're going to have a little bit of a shower which made a welcome thing. Have a strong signal here tonight so I'm gonna make a couple of phone calls.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655235,"So once again I left this morning at  At 5:20. Was prepared for a 12 mile walk into Boiling Springs. I wanted to get there before started boiling. The other hikers I was with had ideas of going on North I or I do to the mileage to Duncan and whi'll call you when the  Through hikers opted out because I've got 2 days to do 25 more miles. So we had a really nice afternoon here at the P ATC office headquarters on the front porch lounging about for the afternoon also there's an outfitter here. A shout out today to one of the 3 hikers named shoothere's named shooter yesterday when I told him I was short 1 of my cables to recharge my phone hes live that cables and sure enough he pulled 1 out of his pack that was exactly what I needed USB to see. Then today when I showed him my hiking calls my hiking pulls a broken tip and the outfitter did not have what I wanted he said oh I've got a set those in my pack sure enough he pulled it set out of his pack. While I was in the outfitter I was also looking for very small pump spray of deep which they did not have so while he was looking for the tips in his pack he pulled out 2 different bottles of bug spray and asked me if I wanted one of them which was awesome it was a very small bottle which was exactly what I was looking for. Figured I at least owed him lunch so we went over to the deli and bought him lunch and I had a pretty good time over there. So tonight it's off to the campsite that they have set aside for hikers which is next to the railroad tracks road tracks pretty noisy . Although I'm not sure how many trains will run through the night. Anyway that's about it for now hope everybody's well

We .. being Shooter and I.. went across the street to little diner and had breakfast.. met Spark in there who was very much into letting us know all his adventures from the past 55 years.  Pretty much a one way conversation.. meeting people out here is one of the best perks.. all good..
 So with full packs of resupply we walked out of town..2 miles road walk..to find the trail blocked a parked train. After a wait l walked over and talked to conductor to see how long wait. He said quite a while but we could walk around the front and down the side to get to the trail..looked a little sketchy but we went for it. The train was parked bout 5 ft from a very high rock wall.
    Made fairly short day out of it after having a late start waiting on the train I don't know pretty good day any days a good day on the trail.  That's about all for now we'll catch you tomorrow.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655523,"Slap in a bit today knowing that I was gonna have a shorter day. And right off the bed I knew there was a detour around a beaver dam and pond. So I took this detour and  There was a girl's high school cross country team having their cross country camp that went running by with their morning warm up.  The tread was an old road even grade covered in cinders I would have loved to have run it myself but not with a 30 pound pack. Anyway I guess the theme of the day was where's the water so once again I just kept on walking. I did stop and take some pretty nice pictures today. 
    Also I got to talk to mom today she sounds really great shout out to you mom hello she talked about her visit from Gwen and Peter come you're coming through going to Denver I guess they had a nice launch Bob and I assumed Jeannie was there. It's always good to cross paths with the cousin when you can so shout out to them. 
    Pretty much seemed like it was gonna rain all afternoon You never really did But just the same I kept pushing to the shelter probably staying here tonight stay dry just me and shooter and a couple of mice got to play store ourselves  Found water here it's really not much more than a puddle but I was able to scoop up 3 l out of it see how it tastes after I filter it.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655583,"Had ideas this morning of getting up early and then workout so well Start a walking at 8 o'clock Wasn't sure where there was going to be water so I had to pretty much check everywhere. There was trail magic at about 4 miles in with 6 jugs of water so I topped off there there but as the rest of the day wasn't sure where there was going to be water. 
   Talked with Craig this morning on WhatsApp and hes getting ready to go with guy on a hike for 2 days oh age over in England I didn't recognize the place she said where they were goingI have to find out from him again just where it is They're going
. They'll be going by train somewhere and then hiking 10 miles and staying at a hostel some sort of being deep and then hiking 10 miles more get back on a train apparently and going back to Sheffield. There's a lot of great hiking over there and you've just shout out to Guy for taking Craig out there on these adventures it's awesome.
   The story of the day also probably more than the water is the rocks I think we are officially in the section of Pennsylvania better known as rockSylvania. You walk about half speed pretty much afraid that every step you're gonna break your ankle twisted it all different directions. So it's supposed to be plenty more of it tomorrow not sure if we're gonna make it into Port Clinton or not 15 miles. I'll sat there for tonight that dinner remember 10th that's food bag tied up all set to go holet's go hopefully I'll get an early start tomorrow and take my time over the rocks .

At 1st I told him some of the short sweet answers such asuch as because it's here or dear or because I can or or to see if I can do it . But really I think the answer is a little more in depth than. I think everybody in some way or other does whatever they need to do to get some peace of mind. So for me walking in the woods is pretty good  Way to clear the mind. There are probably as many ways to clear the mind or to find peace of mind as there are people. It seems as if we're all chasing something.  This isn't going to make the world go away but it's certainly going to help me deal with it in a better way. Maybe more on this later
     So unfortunately I am starting to Figure out how I'm going to get back to my car and Harper's ferry. Through all my section hikes over the years there have been a lot of logistics, planes trains busses cars rides shuttles. So I did get an offer today that possibly Bob and Jeanine be in DC and I can train down to  Meet  Them and get a ride to Harper's ferry from DC. Sounds awesome to me.
   So tomorrow the club's another 13 or 15 miles to a shelter same game plan I'll be up with the sun.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656267,"Upper early hacked quick done early . I guess the story of the day might be that I saw another bear here in Jersey. That is the 2nd one  This trip for me. As with most bear encounters all you're really gonna see is the back end of that bear running away from you.  This one was definitely spooked by me I've never seen a bear move that fastOne time down in Florida with Bob I saw a wild boar charged through the Marsh With complete disregard for what it was running over. This bear today was the same way
      So as I do this voice to memo I'm eating my dinner of mashed potatoes with a fish pack stirredfish pack stir in also some cheese. I'm sitting By my tent some distance from the shelter and apparently some boy scouts have showed up over there. There is quite the racket. But I am remembering the kind of racket we used to make as boy scouts so maybe I should tolerate At least until hiker midnight

But yesterday was spent at The Secret shelter which is not so secret anymore since it's on the far out appThere is a small cabin with electric there's well water there are several buildings many areas for tents and also also a mule. Or a donkey or not quite sure his name is name is Jake mushroof Jake is a Jack or Jacob Eck or Jake is a mule so there was much discussion about jack's Jenny's mules and donkeys I'm not sure if I know any more about them now than I did before. Anyway Jake was kind of pesky when you got your food out so I tried to stay away.. Very nice day there are very convenient so thanks to the owner who used to be a thru he was a thru hiker. And this place is on his property
   Also I went past the monument which is the highest point in the State of New Jersey . I've included a picture of it apparently a side trail went write past it but I did not catch that.
     I got to talk to Craig today on WhatsApp hes doing well and apparently guy and Cathy have gone South which made me London or Bristol . But at the house instead road is Hannah and tash. Tasha's fresh back from a couple years in New Zealand and Hannah is getting ready to go to uni in Liverpool.

They did a fun job I didn't need to buy anything extra thank you very much. Being that we were only going about 7 miles we were in no hurry whatsoever went very much however went through a wildlife preserve or shooter got lots of pictures of the birds. Took time and talk to some other hikers and and gotta appear to the poach Chuck mountain shelter shelter at 3 o'clock I believe.

     So walk to cross the road to Mitchell's hot dog stand who I realized was a veteran and I just wanted to pay him a visit it wasn't really about the hot dog he was crazy was like the soup nazi on like the soup naughty on sign filledHe waited all minute and said OK thank you could you step aside there's a paying customer behind youAnyhow like I said it wasn't that true it wasn't about the hot dog and also he had some AAA signs hanging around 1 says 1 said still crazy after all these years of sobriety.  He aint wrong it's just a little bit different
