Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648279,"Lots to do before our start date of April 14! Need to waterproof the tent and then spray the tent, packs, and clothes with Permethrin to fend off the lovely bugs that try to accompany us along the way.",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Mon",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648661,"So we've finally had a day above 50 degrees and no wind where I can finish waterproofing the tent and rain cover. I can also debug my outer clothing and gear. I had started the waterproofing in the garage, but getting into a cold car, that had to sit outside the garage, on Sunday morning was no fun. I missed my warm car!To debug I spray it with Permethrin. Yes, I know. Bad chemicals!, but I don't want any insect travelers (mainly ticks and mosquitos) hanging onto me for a free ride and sharing whatever lovely diseases they might be carrying.We printed out our gear lists yesterday and began laying out gear and re-weighing things. An ounce doesn't sound like much but you sure think about it when you are dragging it up 4000 or more feet of mountain!",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Mon",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648794,"So today has been spent packing, weighing, and adjusting. We laid out each day's meals. David determines his by calorie count. I determine mine by looking at the food and saying ""Hm. That looks good. I'll eat that.""  We were able to split the meals out into our 3 waterproof Sea to Summit bags and keep each bag between 5-6 pounds. The first couple days on the trail are always murder when you have full food bags. Trying to hang them in the trees, to discourage the bears, is hard too. There have been a number of times where David had to push the bags up into the air while I pulled on the rope (slung over a high tree branch) to get them high enough. Knock on wood, we haven't lost a food bag to bears yet. Let's hope we can keep that record going.I weighed my pack and was thrilled when it came in at only 26.6 pounds! Then I realized that I didn't have my water bottles in it. Fully loaded it comes in at 29.7 pounds. Those uphill climbs tomorrow are going to be fun. (Note sarcasm) Will have to put David's pack weight in tomorrow. He is getting in his last fix of the old TV show ""Dallas"" before we hit the trail. Good thing I was able to finish ""Bridgerton"" before we left! :)",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Wed",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649243,"Mackenzie came over to pick us up at the house about 9:45am, surprising us with Starbucks. The drive to Pearisburg was busy, being mostly highway. 
We stopped at Wendy’s just outside of Pearisburg for a fuel-up lunch then headed to our dropoff point off Johnson Street just on the outskirts of the town. As we drove to the dropoff Mackenzie said “OK. Here’s your trail song!” and then turned on “Wagon Wheel” by Darius Rucker. (When we went to Trail Days in 2019 in Damascus, a group of hikers with guitars were playing that song. It reminds David of the AT every time he hears it.) 


After pictures, we got on the trail about 1:15pm. (I looked at the pictures and didn’t realize that we are dressed like twins. The Goober Twins!) We hope to make Rice Field Shelter. It’s 8 miles and mostly uphill so we will see. 


We hadn’t been hiking long when we saw a sign for the Pearisburg Cemetery. The graves date back to the mid-1860’s. Many are very small and unreadable. There were stone benches to sit on. 


I took the lead for a bit and accidentally stepped on a snake’s head. I said “Oh I’m so sorry little guy!” He shook his head as though saying “What the heck was that?!” and then quickly slithered into the underbrush. He was so pretty. Green with parallel yellow stripes down his back. 


We came upon 2 trail magics. One was a small cooler with 2 Cokes in it. (Right by a noxious chemical plant. Nice smell.) The other was a bag of pecans by a tree. We took one of the Cokes to share at dinner and marveled that the squirrels hadn’t found and eaten the pecans. 


We met a lovely couple in their late 70’s hiking down trail. They said that they had never completely hiked the AT but, in their younger days, had bicycled across America three times!


So we made it to the Rice Field Shelter! It is in a meadow with a stunning view! We met Bandaid at the shelter. He started his thru-hike February 24th. (He told us a group of 9 of them were stuck in a shelter in the Smokey Mtns for 3 days due to snow and 45 mile an hour winds. They were finally able to hike out the 4th day. They built a snowman their third day there.)


We ate a dinner of this mango sticky rice dessert thing. It was bad! Bland and mushy. Blah! We then walked to the top of the ridge (Rice Field Shelter is down a small slope from the view.) to watch the sunset. Another couple had walked in with their 8 week old border collie puppy named Dusty Rose. (That puppy’s fur felt like velvet!) The woman told us that we were actually looking down on Petersburg, WV. We are kind of hiking along the border of Va and WV. 


Once the sun went down a chilly breeze started up so we said our goodbyes and went back to the shelter to hunker down for the night. It’s cold already! The cell service peters out at the shelter. The best service is at the top of the ridge and it’s too cold to stand there and blog. Love you guys but not so much I’ll freeze to death blogging. :)


We hiked 8.1 miles at 40 minute miles, per Coffeebean.","Pearisburg, VA
",Rice Field Shelter,"Apr 14, Thu",8.10
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649245,"What a night!! The wind blew into the shelter so it was cold! I normally sleep very warm so don’t pack alot of warm gear. But i switched into my camp pants but kept everything else on. I also wore my fleece shirt, socks, gloves and a Buff on my head. I slept on my side most of the night so I could pull the sleeping bag around my face. If I switched to my back, the wind would blow over my face and down into the sleeping bag. I also don’t know why I was still so keyed up even after hiking all day. I couldn’t fall asleep. It was a miserable night all around. I only slept 2 hours at the most. Coffeebean didn’t fair much better.


My alarm went off at six and I got up to use the privy. When I came back, Bandaid was coming down from the ridge and said the moon was setting. We walked back up and the moon was this huge orange ball and it just seemed to slide right down to the horizon. It was beautiful! First time I had ever seen a moon setting. Just a few minutes later we were treated to a spectacular sunrise! Just breathtaking!


Coffeebean asked if I wanted hot or cold breakfast. “Hot!!” I said. “As hot as possible!” We had oatmeal and hot chocolate. Coffeebean added coffee to his hot chocolate. 


We left about 7:30. Bandaid left about 7:15. He is going to the Bailey Gap Shelter. About 16 miles. We are shooting for the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter, about 12.5 miles.
The day was a killer uphill and then a killer downhill. It started out nice and cool and then warmed up as the day went on.
At one point I was leading. We had just come across a clearing with those giant electric towers and there was a utility road leading up to them. Part of the trail was on the rood so I was just bee-bopping along. I hear Coffeebean say “So I’ll meet you at the shelter?” I asked “Why? Where are you going?” and he grinned and said “I’m following the AT.” I was so intent in following the road that I walked right past the white blaze. I just gotta pay closer attention or I’ll end up God-knows-where. :)


I’m wearing my Keen hiking boots, which I wear for all our day hikes. I’m getting concerned that I have misjudged these boots for long distance. The little toes on both feet are really painful. I have wrapped them but I think they are rubbing against the boots. When we stopped for lunch I took off my boots and socks and rewrapped them completely. 


We got to the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter! A beautiful stone shelter with the river running across the trail. We are tenting tonight! I need warmth and sleep!


We hiked 12.5 miles (or 13.1 if you count the backtrack for water) :) in 9-1/2 hours. There is no cell service so, once again, I cannot post. Hopefully you haven’t given up on us. I’m also going to try and upload more pictures. I can only put one with the blog entry but you can check the picture gallery for others.","Rice Field Shelter
",Pine Swamp Branch Shelter ,"Apr 15, Fri",12.50
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649317,"We had a great night’s sleep! We stayed in our tent and had the sound of the river to lull us to sleep. 


We slept in until 6:30 then I got up to use the privy. Bricks was just finishing up packing and I said good morning and asked how he was doing. He said he was glad to have been able to pack up dry and I asked what that meant. He said “Oh, it’s supposed to start raining at 7am until about 9am.” It was 6:50! Well, I hightailed it up to the privy and then ran back down and told Coffeebean to get up and pack quick before the rain started. I think we broke a camp breakdown record. 


We took everything up to the shelter and made breakfast and waited for the rain. Two other hikers, Smooth and Snooky, waited too but no rain. Yay!
Snooky told us a funny story about his encounter with a bear. He was hiking up the trail and there was a huge rock. Around the rock came a good size adolescent bear. The wind was blowing towards Snooky so the bear didn’t smell him. So he didn’t frighten the bear he started yelling “Hey Bear! Hey Bear!”  Suddenly he saw 2 women’s heads pop up on the top of the rock, looking at him like he was nuts. They couldn’t see the bear from their angle. The bear ran off and when Snooky approached he told them he was trying to scare away a bear. One of the women said “We wondered why you were yelling that. That’s my trail name!” Smooth, Coffeebean and I laughed. “I think she needs to change her trail name.” I said. 


We left the shelter about 8:35. And headed towards Bailey Gap shelter, about 3.9 miles. Doesn’t sound like much but over a mile of it was uphill with no switchbacks! Argh! We stopped to rest numerous times and took a good break at the shelter. One of our hiker friends from 2019, Crusher, told us to try laying on our backs and putting our feet up on the shelter wall. It helps with blood circulation and feels good on the feet. 


One of the nice things about the shelters we come across so far this trip is that they have all been right on the trail. No walking .1 or .2 or .3 miles in. That is soo nice! At the end of the day you just want to  set up camp and relax without having to walk anymore. 


Once we left Bailey Gap shelter, we were transported to Pennsylvania!! The entire trail was rocks!! We were having PTSD flashbacks! Big rocks, little rocks! That went on for at least 2 hours. It was the pits! 



The rocks eventually thinned out and the trail wasn’t bad. We were just so tired. Achy and sore. We really wanted to reach Warspur shelter and catch up with Smooth and Snooky but we have to “hike our own hike”. We ended up stopping around 3:45pm after only hiking 7.78 miles. We are whipped and need some recovery time.
Dinner was a Mountain House beef stroganoff for Coffeebean and instant potatoes for me. (If I eat too much Mountain House I blow up like a pufferfish.) It was great to have a good hot meal. We ended up going to bed about 7pm.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter 
",Stealth campsite ,"Apr 16, Sat",7.78
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649338,"Woke up to 20-25mph winds with the temps in the 30’s. This is a guess because we still don’t have cell service. We haven’t had service since we left on Thursday!


We decided to just pack up, eat a protein bar, and then eat a hot breakfast at the Warspur shelter. The hike there was fairly level and the shelter was beautiful with lots of tent sites. Coffeebean made oatmeal and hot chocolate. Warmed us right up. We had already hiked 4.9 miles in only 2-1/2 hours. 



The next big climb was Kelly Knob. The first 3/4 of the climb was nice with switchbacks. The last 1/4 was straight up! The view at Kelly Knob was disappointing. It had huge flat rocks to climb on (like building blocks) but no view because of the trees.
Hiked 10.7 miles today and finished up at the Laurel Creek Shelter around 3:30. No one else was here but we knew it would fill up because of the bad weather due tomorrow (rain all day). We shared the shelter with Cool Whip, Lightening, KG, Runaway, and GGnome (Garden Gnome). 


A couple came in later (Lovin’ It and Livin’ It). We told them we would move over for room in the shelter but they said they never shelter, only tent. GGnome showed them a nice site out behind the shelter. 


And still no cell service!! (I am sending “check ins” home to the girls via the Guthook app so they know where we are.)","Stealth campsite 
",Laurel Creek Shelter ,"Apr 17, Sun",10.70
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649339,"The rain started early, early morning and was sometimes heavy and then would taper off a bit, and then start up hard again. You can see your breath, it’s so cold.
Lightening, Four Pack, and KG got up and left probably about 7:30. Cool Whip stayed around a bit and then packed his tent up and left too. GGnome and Runaway decided to zero here too with us. The rain was supposed to stop around 4pm and we thought about hiking the 6 miles to the next shelter. It would include a climb up to 3600 feet and over. Then Pipes came in, with ICE on his pack!, and said the hiking was bad. He stayed at Warspur shelter last night and had to hike up Kelly Knob to get here. He said there was ice on the trees and it made the branches hang low so he was getting hit in the head with ice-laden branches. Before he left he checked the weather for us (only folks with AT&T have been able to get service) and said that it would stop sleeting/raining until 2:00 and then rain would start again at 4:30. Another reason to stay.


GGnome just came back from the privy and said that just walking there and back made him glad they weren’t hiking. It’s muddy and wet and cold. 


About 10:30am it began sleeting. I took a picture of the picnic table with ice chips on it. Then it began to snow. 


A solo female hiker named Katie came in covered in ice and soaked through. She talked about hiking to the next shelter but ended up staying because she was so cold and wet. She had tented last night and her tent was soaked too. She had stayed at Warspur with Pipes last night.


Papa Bear came in mid-afternoon. He was also cold and wet and talked about the branches of ice hitting him. He asked if anyone had lost a red alpaca hat. He found it in a shelter and figured he might run into the owner. GGnome yelled “No way! I lost my hat 100 miles ago. I didn’t think I’d see it again!” He was so happy!


At 4:30 it began to rain, right on cue, but then stopped about 10 minutes later. Oh well. 


So our wimpy butts will be spending the day hunkered in our sleeping bags and resting. Zero miles today. 


We shared some great stories. GGnome told us of a hiker on the trail now called Mischief. He is a double amputee. He had been doing a thru hike a few years before and when going to get water, fell and was knocked unconscious. His feet were in the water and he had to have them both amputated. He is back thru hiking now with prosthetics. Later, along the trail, one of his titanium prosthetics broke. He stopped at Boots Off Hostel and the hiker sleeping next to him, Coasty, said that in his job he works on titanium and was able to temporarily fix it for him to get to a place off-trail. Like they say “The trail will provide.”


Speaking of that, Coffeebean broke open the toe of his boot. I brought along Shoe Goop for just that reason. He tried to squeeze out some goop and the opening was sealed shut. He said he needed a sharp point to break the seal but we didn’t have anything. Yesterday we were hiking along and I looked down and there was a diaper safety pin laying on the trail. Now he has a way to open the shoe goop. “The trail will provide.”","Laurel Creek Shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649340,"It was SOOOO COLD last night!! I had all my clothes on and I cinched up my sleeping bag around my face but I was still cold and so didn’t sleep much. I had picked a spot by the wall thinking it would give me a little more protection fro the wind but not much. I could hear the rain start and stop but the wind never quit. GGnome got up at 4:30am and it was snowing. 


I got up at 6:15am for my morning privy walk and the path was covered in snow! Privy path hidden by snow??!! Ahhhh!


Papa Bear left first and early. Katie followed a while later. For once we weren’t the last to leave!



The trail was covered with snow and ice. We had to cross Laurel Creek twice. Didn’t fall in though. The sun was trying to break through but that wicked wind!
We hiked through some beautiful pastures. We came to the Keffer Oak Tree It’s estimated to be 300 years old and is the largest oak tree on the AT in the south. Once we hit the woods the climb was a tough up but there were nice switchbacks and lots of stone steps. Finally reached the ridge and ridge-walked pretty much the rest of the day. That would have been a fantastic day except the day high was supposed to be 48 degrees. It never got anywhere near that because of the wind chill. I wore my Buff snd hat on my head, 3 layers from the waist up, 2 layers from the waist down and gloves on my hands and was still cold. The sun finally started to come out so we stopped and took off layers. Started walking again and didn’t the sun go behind the clouds and the wind kick up again. Put layers back on!!


We were finally able to walk just below the ridge and had some big rock scrambles to climb. That was fun!


We made it to the Niday Shelter about 4:15pm. Professor and Jasper showed up a few minutes later. Jasper is from Canada. The first foreign hiker we’ve met. Then Fish and Chips came in. They are from the UK. 


We had soup and then a chicken and broccoli side for dinner. We were hungry not having eaten anything hot or filling yesterday. 


Did 12.61 miles today.","Laurel Creek Shelter 
",Niday Shelter ,"Apr 19, Tue",12.61
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649343,"Another cold, cell service-less night. I woke about 6:00 and got up about 6:15 for my daily “walk”. The privy at this shelter is new so the paths are not super obvious. Needless to say I got lost several times and walked through underbrush trying to find a path in the not-quite-light. 


We were the last ones out of the shelter. Professor and Jasper left very early. We never even heard them. Fish and Chips were next. We headed out about 8:30, our latest time yet. 


We crossed at least half a dozen cute little bridges crossing over Craig Creek. 



The up today was very big but wonderful switchbacks. (They make such a difference!) When we got to the ridge there was a bench! We took a little break and were able to actually get cell service!! I uploaded 2 entries before we left. (I tried to upload a picture but it says they are too big. I will have to check into that.)
We ridge-walked a short ways to the Audie Murphy Monument. He died near there in a plane crash. He was the most decorated serviceman in WWII, receiving 24 decorations! The local Boy Scout troop maintains the flag that flies there. Alot of people have left items there such as dog tags, patches, flags, military caps, etc. It was a a very moving place. There were 2 benches there to sit too. We sat and just talked about the heroics of people that served in that war. 


We continued on and the day was really good. Great temps, sunny, but not too warm. Much of the paths were thick with dried leaves like you see in the fall time. It was fun to kick through them like a little kid. We just had to be sure there weren’t any rocks or roots underneath to send us flying down the mountain. 


Finally came to a road crossing along side a beautiful river. We watered up and even took an extra liter each because there is no water for about 10 miles. I’m telling you. Carrying a liter of water up a mountain feels like you are carrying a ton of bricks! You really feel the weight difference on your back.



The next shelter, Pickle Branch, was only a mile away but the reviews on Guthook were terrible. It was also .3 in the water was down a long steep path. We hiked past about another .3 and found a gorgeous, grassy stealth site that could easily hold 5 or 6 tents. It was only 4pm and the next stealth site we knew of was straight up and we also didn’t know if it would be as good as this one, so we decided to stay. Dug my cathole tonight so I don’t have to do it in the morning. :)


We are getting up at 6 am tomorrow to tackle the Dragon’s Tooth. It is the first of what is called the Virginia Triple Crown (Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tink’s Cliffs). I can’t wait!!


Hiked 10.3 miles today.","Niday Shelter 
",Stealth campsite ,"Apr 20, Wed",10.30
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649429,"Last night we slept warmer than we have this whole trip. We were up by 6am because today we climb the Dragon’s Tooth, a monolithic rock formation on the top of the mountain (sorry, I don’t know which mountain.)!! It is the first in the Virginia Triple Crown. 


It was a great hike up and there was no one there when we got there. You’re supposed to be able to see McAfee Knob from up on the tooth but we forgot to look. We were just so impressed with the rocks!!



The hike down was even more impressive. If you want a day hike that includes rock scrambles, this is the one! A couple of times I had to sit down and slide down the rock. There was also a place where you had to climb a couple of rungs to get down.
At the bottom was VA rt 620 and .4 was a small grocery for us to resupply to get us into Daleville. As we walked in a guy and his dog stopped to see if we needed a ride. We told him we were going in to eat. He couldn’t stay as he was on his way to McAfee Knob but said that maybe he would see us there. We got to the store and ordered a hamburger each and a fry to share plus 2 Pepsis. While waiting for our food we talked to a SOBO (southbound) hiker named The Machine. He started February 24 at Mt Katahdin, Maine and was already in southern Virginia! He said when he started he hiked 50-75 miles a day!! That’s how he got the name The Machine. We wolfed down our lunch like we hadn’t eaten in a week and then bought our resupply. We wished Machine well and started back to the trailhead. 


A great part of hiking, especially in the spring, is watching the forest come alive. So many spring flowers are coming out and the trees are budding. We saw our first blooming azalea today. 


We got to the McAfee Knob parking area and wasted no time going up the trail. We were only a short ways up and saw the guy and his dog coming down. We chatted for a bit and then parted ways. A few minutes later I saw an airpod case laying on the trail. I told Coffeebean that I remember that the guy had earbuds in and maybe the case was his. I decided to leave the case at the shelter we were going to stay at as it was only a mile up. 


We got to Johns Spring Shelter and began setting up when another hiker came in. He introduced himself as Gorby, which is a kind of bird and also Scottish-Gaelic for “glutton”, so he told us. We watched this raccoon come down the shelter towards us. It went under the shelter, with its tail wagging the whole time. That didn’t seem normal so we scared it off. Thank goodness, it didn’t come back.  


We were both tired after a long day and still fairly full from our townie food so we didn’t feel like a big dinner. We shared a snack size bag of Lay’s BBQ chips and a small bag of M&M’s. Dinner of champions!


I was getting ready to head to our tent and remembered the airpods  case in my pocket. I pulled it out and mentioned to Gorby that I found them and hoped the owner would come back looking for them. Gorby jumped up and yelled “That’s what we were looking for!” He had met the guy and his dog on the trail looking for the case. Gorby told the guy if he found it he would leave it at the Johns Spring Shelter and put a note in the log. He kept saying “I can’t believe I found it.” 


Hiked 13.4 today, got in about 6:10pm.","Stealth campsite 
",Johns Spring Shelter,"Apr 21, Thu",13.40
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649535,"I slept warm again last night. It felt so good! Hopefully we are done with brass monkey weather!


I woke up a pufferfish this morning with swollen eyes. Ugh!


We left about 7:35 this morning to hopefully get up to McAfee Knob before it got crowded. We had already heard folks walk by earlier. The hike up wasn’t bad, with steps in many places and it was only 2.6 miles from where we were at the shelter. There was only us and another couple when we got there. McAfee Knob is known as the most photographed spot on the AT and it truly is beautiful. We got lots of pictures and enjoyed the beautiful view and weather before moving on. 



The last of the Virginia Triple Crown awaited us - Tinker Cliffs. We met a group of 3 men and their dog, Ray, hiking to Lambert Meadow Shelter for the weekend. (It is on the other side of Tinker Cliffs.) We would leap frog with them throughout the day. Ray would always come running over to us to be petted whenever we met up with them. At one spot, Ray started to walk off with us and I had to tell him to go back. :)
When we arrived at the bottom of the mountain of Tinker Cliffs and looked up, the trail was straight up. No turns, no switchbacks. Just straight up. There were about 5 sections of this. Straight up for 20-30 minutes, a very short flat walk, and then another straight up for 20-30 minutes. It was really grueling. I personally feel this was our toughest climb. 


We finally reached the top and the view was beautiful with a slight breeze. The cliffs stretched along the mountain for maybe .3 of a mile. 


Once down the mountain it was a nice walk to Lambert Meadows shelter. What a beautiful shelter right along the river with lots of flat campsites. There was a huge stealth campsite for at least a dozen tents just down from the shelter. A hiker at the shelter said that he had seen a 350 lb bear earlier that day as he was walking SOBO to the shelter. He said a ranger said that a mama bear with 2 cubs had also been seen in the area. We weren’t staying at Lambert because we wanted to get within 5-6 miles of Daleville so we kept walking but kept a close eye out. 


We were walking down the mountain so the terrain was steep, nothing flat to camp on. It was getting close to 6pm and still nothing flat in sight. We were getting so tired. I said a couple prayers asking for help and doesn’t the trail go down and end at a flat stealth site! God is good!


We hiked 12.64 miles, 6.2 miles from Daleville.","Johns Spring Shelter
",Stealth campsite ,"Apr 22, Fri",12.64
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649538,"We woke at 5am (another warm night!), excited to go into town for a shower, clean laundry, and a bed that isn’t on the ground!


As we were dressing I heard crashing coming from the back of the tent. I knew the trail was in front of the tent so I couldn’t imagine what was coming from the other direction. But it did sound human. David looked out and said hello to a hunter passing by. Whew!


We finished what we had left for breakfasts. The bugs were already out in force - gnats and flies! Annoying!


We finally left at 7:15 with the plan to be in town by 10:30-ish. The climb kept going up, which surprised us because it should have been going down. We did pass by some giant rocks (another monolith but nowhere near as impressive as Dragon’s Tooth!). We also met the most interesting pair of hikers! Feathers and her little goat, Little Leaf! Little Leaf was so adorable! He liked to hike behind her (she had a little rope lead on him) so he was wearing this vest covered in sharp studs. At first I thought he looked very goth but Feathers explained that it was called a coyote vest. It wasn’t uncommon for coyotes and even dogs to attack him so the vest covered in spikes deterred them.


Got to Daleville about 10:45. Just before the trailhead I stopped and changed into my camp shirt so I didn’t smell too bad. 


We didn’t have to walk far, about .4 of a mile to get to a small shopping center with numerous food places, an outfitter, and a Kroger. We stopped and got coffee (I got a chai tea latte) and a muffin and sat outside the shop and relaxed. We saw GGnome, Runaway, and Cool Whip and they came over and sat with us. They were leaving that day. 


After a while we decided to get lunch and chose The Three Li’l Pigs BBQ restaurant.  We had the special of a burrito stuffed with pulled pork, bacon, and coleslaw.  It came with a side and I got brunswick stew and CoffeeBean got baked beans. IT WAS FABULOUS!! Hikers also got a banana pudding for dessert for free. We walked away there as 2 li’l pigs for sure. As we were waiting for our food, we saw a hiker walk into the shopping center carrying a huge log. Every head in the restaurant turned and I heard numerous people say “Is that guy carrying a log??”


After lunch we went over to Kroger to resupply. It was out of many of the things we were looking for. When we came out of the store, there was the guy with the log! We stopped and talked to him and found out his name is, wait for it, Logman. He carries the 20 lb log (someone named the log Larry) everywhere with him and he had a QR code on the log where you could donate money. Every penny he raises goes to veterans groups. He stated several times that he does not keep one penny. He was fascinating to talk to and I can’t wait to check out his site when we get home. He said that he has hiked all 15 of the 4000 ft peaks in New Hampshire and Connecticut and all the Adirondack Mountains. We wished him luck and said goodbye and headed to the Super 8 Hotel down the road. 


So glad we had called 2 days before and reserved a room because a big sign on the door said “SOLD OUT”. We got to our room, stripped, and CoffeeBean put on his rain pants and took our stuff to the laundry room. There was only one washer and one dryer so we had to wait in line but it all worked out. 


Mackenzie is working as a travel nurse in Roanoke so when she got off at 7:15pm she drove the 20 minutes over to our hotel and visited with us for a little over an hour. It was great to see her and hear about her day. 


We hiked 6.2 miles into Daleville, a nero day (near zero).","Stealth campsite

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649739,"We checked out of the Super 8 in Daleville about 9:30. It wasn’t a bad hike uphill out of town. (We love resupply! We hate resupply! But the weight!) The smell of the honeysuckle was amazing. We came upon a pasture that we had to hike through and when we got to the top of it we had a 360 degree view of mountains snd blooming trees and blue sky. It was just gorgeous and so peaceful. 


We got to the Fullhardt Shelter and found Cool Whip, Smooth, and Tin Man taking a break. We sat and talked with them a while. We ended up leap frogging with them all day. 


It was so hot! High 80’s. On the ridge we would occasionally get a breeze snd would just stand snd revel in it. But those weren’t too often. The heat is so exhausting!


I was not having a good day. Between the heat snd my feet killing me, I really wanted to sit and have s good cry. I texted that to Kenz snd she said “Do it, Mom. Sometimes you just need s good cry to make you feel better. Like cleaning out a wound and then it can heal.” Ever the nurse. :)


Late afternoon we stopped at Wilson Creek. Coffeebean suggested I take my shoes snd socks off snd soak my feet. That and a little cry snd I was feeling better. 


We finally arrived at the Wilson Creek shelter about 5:25pm. Cool Whip, Smooth, and Tin Man were already there in addition to a couple section hikers. 


It was my turn to get water. .2 miles downhill. Ugh! I told Coffeebean he had the next TWO times to get water. 


So we ended up doing 11.26 miles but they were horrible, uphill, downhill miles.","Daleville 
",Wilson Creek Shelter ,"Apr 24, Sun",11.26
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649779,"It was so windy last night! I have never had Coffeebean hang my shirt outside before but I asked him last night (he hangs his shirt out every night). Then hearing those hurricane-like winds made me worry that all our clothes had blown away. 


We had oatmeal, hot chocolate, and mini powdered donuts for breakfast. We left about 7:20 and it was already getting hot. Today is supposed to be a high of 87 degrees! We had decided that around 2 or 3 we would stop and set up the tent and siesta for several hours until the worst of the heat was over. 



The trail was not very bad initially. We stopped for water .2 down the trail. It was right on the trail so that was nice. The next water is not until Bobblets Gap shelter, 7.4 miles away.
We made it to Bobblets Gap shelter and it was a beautiful shelter but it was .25 down the trail with about 4 switchbacks to get there. The water was right there by the shelter and the privy was close by too. After collecting water. I went down and soaked my feet. That felt wonderful! Cool Whip, Tin Man, and Smooth were there too. The 2 section hikers that were at the shelter last night showed up too. 


After a lunch of pita crackers and cheese on spinach tortillas, we started out again, about 1pm. The 3 guys are hiking to Middlecreek Campground (17 miles)so we probably won’t be seeing them again. Too bad. They are so much fun!


Except for the horrible heat, the trail was bad. A lot of ridge-like walking. We were walking along a flat section and there was a log across the trail. This is not uncommon at all and the log was not big (some you have to sit on and swing your legs and poles over). So my one leg and the piles went over but the other decided it didn’t want to and I literally face-planted. I was worried I had broken my glasses by they sprang right back. My face. Not so much. I ended up with a gash over my right eye, a couple small bruises on my left knee, and the fatty part under my left thumb bruised badly. Coffeebean patched me up but I felt achy as the day went on.


It was getting to be mid-afternoon so we started looking for a stealth site to siesta. We got to Bearwallow Gap and MADE a stealth site a little ways up from the stream. We just set up the tent (without the rain tarp) and climbed in. As soon as I laid down, I was out like a light!  We slept for at least an hour. 


Across the road was our next climb so we decided to call it a day and just camp there. We staked out the tent and put on the rain cover. We figured with a water source right here we could heat up a dinner and a breakfast and have plenty of water. The next water source is 6 miles. 


We still put in a 10.4 mile day even stopping short.","Wilson Creek Shelter 
",Bearwallow Gap,"Apr 25, Mon",10.40
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649780,"After our night by Bearwallow Gap we broke camp about 7:20 and headed straight up the mountain. The rain tarp over the tent was damp with condensation so I wrapped it separately in a plastic bag and will dry it when we stop for lunch. At first it wasn’t bad but then the farther up you went, the steeper. The weather calls for scattered showers of 50% at noon and 60% at 1pm. 


At noon we could see dark clouds and hear thunder over the mountains to our left but it was still pretty over us. Then the wind started to kick up and the clouds began moving our way. We had about 45 minutes to get to the shelter. I asked the Good Lord to give is that time so we could get there and stay dry. Ten minutes after we got to the shelter it began raining! God is listening to this poor, aching hiker. :)


And who should we meet at the shelter but Cool Whip, Tin Man, Smooth, GGnome, and Runaway! Didn’t think we’d see them again after yesterday and their plans for 17 mile days. They had stopped there waiting for the rain to pass and had been there about 2 hours. They were just pack ing u to leave when the rain started. They dropped their packs and climbed back into the shelter. 


Speaking of the shelter, it is called the Bryant Ridge Shelter and is one of the biggest on the AT. It can hold 20 people (most hold 6-8) and is 2 stories high with an upper loft. The water source is a stream right near the shelter and the privy is a short walk down a little path. 


Everyone was just laying quietly resting when a young hiker came in. She was quiet and wrote in the shelter log for the longest time. Then more came straggling in. The first girl and another hiker began LOUDLY talking about a smurf riddle they had come up with or heard. They went back and forth yakking and yakking like a couple of crows. It was really annoying! After about 8 of them had showed up, they decided to walk on to the next shelter (which is where we had planned to end our day). After they left, we just talked about how loud and annoying those girls were. (Cool Whip nicknamed them Chip and Dale.) We all decided to just stay here for the night rather than go to the next shelter with the annoying kids. GGnome and Runaway decided to move on and find a stealth camp because they had only done a nero yesterday and so far today. It rained for a couple hours before finally tapering off. Tomorrow is supposed to be really nice and only in the 70’s. It’s supposed to be nice for the next 4 days or so. 


After the rain stopped the guys went around and collected firewood and Tin Man made a fabulous fire. It took care of the bothersome bugs for sure. 


I forgot to mention that last night at the campground store Tin Man tried on a raccoon tailed hat. GGnome said if he didn’t buy that hat he was gonna buy it for him! So Tin Man bought it and it hasn’t left his head. :)


We told the guys that when they get to Rockfish Gap in Waynesboro to call us and we will come get them for resupply and a place to stay. They were grateful for the offer. I hope we get home before they get there.


Hiked 10.4 miles until 1:20pm","Bearwallow Gap
",Bryant Ridge Shelter ,"Apr 26, Tue",10.40
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649965,"Woke up to a cold, cold morning. A day ago we were dying of the heat and today we are freezing. 


We “slept in” till 6am and enjoyed breakfast together at the picnic table with the guys. They are so funny and conversations are always lively. 


We were actually the first to leave at 8am. Began the day with “fresh horses”, as Coffeebean says, to begin the big climb up to 4200 feet. It was cool below so I wore my fleece over my shirt. About 1/4 of the way up I stopped to take it off and realized that the water bottle that I have attached to my shoulder strap was missing. I’d left it at the shelter! I said a prayer that one of the guys would see it and bring it along. 



The higher we climbed the worse the winds became. So I stopped again and put my fleece back on. We kept hiking up and up. The winds were just unbelievably brutal and cold. Hurricanic winds! (A new word I have just created to describe the winds we are experiencing.) We finally got to the top and over and the winds calmed down so I stopped and took my fleece off for the second time.
We came down quite a drop and then began our second (3000’) climb of the day. I know I bitch a lot about the ups and downs of these mountains. But until you are out here with a 25-30 pack on your back and climbing up an incline with anywhere from a 35-45 degree angle with strong/gusting winds trying to knock you over, it can be hard for you to relate. I wish I could find the words (other than my current whining ones) that really paint a true picture. 


We finally got to the Harrison Spring tent site. Coffeebean walked right past it and I only caught it because of the sign that said “water not tested”. After checking Guthook I called Coffeebean back and we went down a picked a site. There was already a thru-hiker set up. The guys came in about 10 minutes later. The water source is not exactly the way it’s described on Guthook. The stream was very small, not easy to find, and the water had to be scooped out with a cup. 


Tonight it’s supposed to get down to 35 degrees. Brrr!


Tomorrow we head into Glasgow and the hostel Stanimals for a shower, laundry, town food, and a bed off the ground. Can’t wait. We’ll also walk over the James River Foot Bridge, the longest foot bridge on the AT. 


We hiked 13.6 miles today.","Bryant Ridge Shelter 
",Stealth campsite at Harrison Spring ,"Apr 27, Wed",13.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650129,"It was cold, cold this morning. I asked Cool Whip where he got his water and he said to go back on AT and look for a flat spot and then go down to the water. I couldn’t find it so I came back to camp and tried to find a different path but couldn’t. Then I saw Smooth getting water and I asked him  how he got to the stream. So I followed Smooth’s directions and finally found water. Cool Whip laughed at me and said “You’ve already put in 2 miles today!” I was able to get 2 liters for breakfast and to start the day. We can water up at the stream in 3.3 miles. 


Talking of Cool Whip. We were in our tent the other night and they were all out around the firepit cooking dinner and I heard Cool Whip say “Aren’t the kids going to come out for dinner?”  We are older than all of them, but we are “the kids”. :) I yelled out that we were waiting for DoorDash to deliver our dinner. 



The water source, 3.3 miles later, was a beautiful grassy area with room for a number of tents. Wish we had known about this place last might when we stopped.
We had a 3000’ climb before going down to the James River and Glasgow. The hike down was pretty steep at times and then finally leveled off. It seemed to take forever to get down to the river though. Four miles out, up the mountain where we still had service, I texted Stanimals and asked for a shuttle to pick up “5 well-behaved hikers”. I then threatened Cool Whip to behave and we all laughed.


Now let me tell you a story. Back when we first started the trail in 2019, we stopped at a hostel called Top of Georgia. There we met Braveheart and a bunch of her tramily. We have kept in close contact with Braveheart and consider her a very dear friend. At Top of Georgia, Braveheart met, and has stayed in close touch, with a hiker named Pilgrim. After his hike, Pilgrim took over running the Stanimals hostel in Glasgow. 
Now back to today: So Braveheart had been visiting a friend in VA and had texted Pilgrim several times about coming to see him. She had just turned onto the highway to head home to CT when Pilgrim texted her to come down and visit. He could use some help. So she turned around and drove to Glasgow. Minutes after she arrived he got our text and told her that he needed to go pick up some hikers named Happy Feet, Coffeebean, Cool Whip, Smooth, and Tin Man. Braveheart yelled “Wait! Happy Feet and Coffeebean? I know them!”


Meanwhile the guys and us hurried down to river level because we knew the shuttle would be there at 4pm. We took pictures of each other crossing the James River Foot Bridge. A group of kids were jumping off  the bridge, even though there is a sign saying it’s illegal and you will be fined. 


We crossed the bridge and there stood Pilgrim (Charlie) waiting for us. He told the guys to put their packs in his car. He told us to put ours in the car down a ways in the parking lot. Then he said “Do you know her?” Out from behind the car comes Braveheart!  Coffeebean had spotted her first and thought “Why do I think I know her?” She ran up to him and hugged him. I knew her instantly! I screamed and ran to her and we were screaming and jumping up and down. It was the best surprise!! And for the timing of everything to have just fallen in place so perfectly!


We drove back to the hostel chattering all the way. As we hit Glasgow she pointed out all the hot spots: grocery/gas station, Dollar Store, and Scotto’s Italian restaurant. That’s it. 


We got to the hostel and we took off our boots (no boots in the house, only camp shoes). Charlie gave us the spiel on using the washer, who sleeps where, showers,  shuttles to trailhead in  the morning, and evening dessert.  


We took showers and Braveheart put our clothes in the washer for us. She is doing a  work-for-stay so she sleeps in the upstairs bedroom that has a double and a king bed. She told us to sleep in the king and she would take the double. 



Then she drove Tin Man, Rock Steady, and us over to Scottos to eat dinner. (This is not related to the Scottos in Waynesboro. I asked.) Coffeebean and I had calzones. I also had a vanilla milkshake and CoffeeBean had a salad. The food was good and filling. Then we hit the Dollar Store and grocery for resupply. Back to the hostel to settle accounts, arrange shuttle times, and have dessert. Hot apple cobbler with ice cream and whipped cream!
Later when we were up in our room Braveheart said she wanted to give us some trail magic. She wanted to slackpack us tomorrow through the Punchbowl (killer ups!) She invited the guys too and they were so excited. Tin Man wants to carry his pack so the rest of us will slackpack. We will leave tomorrow at 8am from the trailhead and then she will bring our packs and meet us at the Punchbowl Overlook. 


Braveheart is our hero!!


We hiked 11.3 miles today.","Stealth campsite at Harrison Spring 
",Stanimals - Glasgow ,"Apr 28, Thu",11.30
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650132,"We had a wonderful sleep in a soft warm bed. After stripping the bed we went down for a delicious breakfast of homemade blueberry pancakes. I had a bottle of water for breakfast. Coffeebean had coffee with his 6 pancakes. 


We then packed our packs and prepared to leave with the 8am ride. 


I had Braveheart look at my pack(she has one like it) to see if she could adjust the vertical stays to arch correctly. She couldn’t either and told me to call zpacks when we got home and tell them that something is wrong with the pack. 


Braveheart then gave us great trail magic. She had us pack our packs and leave them in the corner of the living room. We took day packs with just what we needed for the day and then she drove us back to the trailhead and promised to meet us in 6 hours at the top of the mountain with our packs. This is called slackpacking. (TinMan is a purist and wanted to carry his pack.) Usually you have to return to the hostel and stay another night but this is her trail magic. She would meet us and we could continue on without having to pay for another night. She is the best!!



There were several really steep parts but the switchbacks were amazing and the views were breathtaking! At the top of Bluff Mtn was a view down to Glasgow and the James River. The trees were all dark green and the mountains looked like giant rolling waves across the landscape.
Braveheart met us at the Pumchbowl Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. She cheered us as we came out of the woods. She also brought several jugs of water and frozen icy pops. It was so wonderful!


Braveheart said she needed to leave to pick up a hiker so we emptied our day packs and went to the back of her car to get our big packs. She pulled out 3 packs and said “Wait a minute. I have 3 packs but there are 4 of you. Did everyone leave their pack in the living room?” Coffeebean said that he had but his pack was the one missing. Then he looked in the back seat and saw it there. Braveheart burst out laughing and then we all started laughing and CoffeeBean said “You little shit you!” And we laughed again!


We hugged again and took some more pictures and thanked Braveheart profusely before waving goodbye. 


We were still waiting on Tin Man. We all still felt pretty energetic so we decided to put in another 4.2 miles to a campsite. Coffeebean and I took off first. After a hellacious down we came to a dirt road and a cool suspension bridge for hikers to cross the river. A short ways down the trail was an offshoot trail with a group of tent sites right by the river. It was really nice!


After setting up our tents, the guys built a great fire. Smooth came over and pulled a pack of hotdogs out of his pack! With hotdog buns! He had put the dogs in the freezer at the hostel and they were still cold! The guys had whittled sticks to cook them on. Then we all cooked hotdogs over the open fire! If you had offered me a steak or those hotdogs. The hotdogs would have won hands down! They tasted amazing! Next time we need to bring catsup and mustard packets. 


We hiked 15.2 miles today. Woo hoo! Our new record for this trip.","Stanimals - Glasgow 
",Stealth campsite by the river,"Apr 29, Fri",15.20
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650135,"Today is the last day of April and we should be home in 4 days or so. 


We woke up to the beautiful sound of the river below us. Tin Man is wanting to do a 20 mile day so he left pretty quickly. We wished him well and I gave him my number so he could call us when he reached Rockfish Gap and we would give him a free place to stay and shuttle him around for resupply. 


Coffeebean left next and I followed about 8:15. Smooth is meeting his wife at VA 60 which is only 6 miles from where we are. He told her 1pm so he has plenty of time to get there. 



The trail was pretty and ran along the river. We stopped at a couple informational signs. It seems that back in the early 1900’s there had been a small community of freed slaves that had lived and worked there. As we walked we could see stones fences or maybe they were the walls of homes on the other side of the river.
We had to cross back and forth across the river several times. It was so calming to walk along and see the small cascades and listen to the rushing water. 


It started to drizzle (Rain isn’t due till tomorrow!) so we had to stop and cover our packs and put on raincoats. It picked up a little and then would go back to spitting. We stopped at the Brown Mountain Creek Shelter for a snack and met “Mother Nature”. She is 80 years old (I thought she was in her early 70’s/late 60’s!) and has been driving a school bus for 48 years and hopes to go to 50. She and her husband (who 93 and finally stopped hiking at 90) have section hiked the whole AT and then went back and did a thru-hike too. She said hiking the AT was her passion and she took her grandkids hiking on it too. 


We continued on and knew when we were getting close to VA 60 because the trail started to ascend. 


We got up to the road and met “Mrs Smooth”. :) She brought us trail magic of drinks. Cool Whip had a beer. Coffeebean and I had a Coke. Smooth gave Cool Whip a beer to give to Tin Man when he saw him. 



Then we started our 4200’ ascent! It was tough, very tough. We finished that, walked down a bit, and then started Cole Mountain. It wasn’t a bad climb and there were two balds at the top. It was really beautiful and serene. Just a short 1.2 mile walk from there to Hog Camp Gap where we planned to stop for the night. We thought it would be crowded with hikers but we were the only ones there. It’s a beautiful grassy field with a firepit. Cool Whip was going to do a fire but it has gotten cold and we need to get to the shelter 8.4 miles away before the predicted thunderstorms at 2pm tomorrow.
Hiked 13.1 miles today.","Stealth campsite by the river
",Hog Camp Gap,"Apr 30, Sat",13.10
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650156,"It was pretty cool this morning and we noticed that a couple other hikers had come in later in the evening. Coffeebean walked the supposed .3 miles to get water (both he and Cool Whip swear it was longer). When he got back he said that I had to get the next 3 waters!


We ate breakfast and left about 7:30. We were trying to get to The Priest shelter before the rain started at 3pm. 


We went to the next shelter, Seeley-Woodworth Shelter, for a quick break. We met the infamous Leafblower hiker at the shelter. This is the hiker that is carrying a full-sized leafblower from Georgia to Maine. If you ask him why, he just responds “I just gotta get it to Maine.” He won’t say anything more about it. He’s just gotta get it to Maine. He agreed to let me take his picture!



The hiking to this point was not bad. Little ups and downs and lots of flat areas but once we left the last shelter and headed towards The Priest shelter we ran into 3 different ascents that went straight up. One was up to Spy Rock. You had to go off trail to see it once you got to the top. Coffeebean said “Do you want to walk over and see it?” I said “We live near here. We will drive our car over here to see it. Right now I just want to get to the shelter.” We had to stop because the pinkie toe on my right foot was causing me such pain. I pulled off my boot and sock and my poor little toe was red and the skin was rubbed raw. We covered it with a bandaid and put a piece of moleskin on the adjacent toe to cushion the sore one. It definitely helped.
So we pushed on and came to a sign that said “The Priest Shelter 1 mile”. I looked up and the trail was straight up. The words I said next were not very nice.


After walking and walking we saw a big group of rocks and heard Cool Whip say “You kids made it!”  Tin Man, GGnome snd Runaway were there too. Not far from the rocks was the shelter sign but turning right we saw a firepit and tent sites. Picked our site, set up the tent, and went over and sat with the group on the rocks and talked. Cool Whip and Tin Man told about a couple of the hikers in the shelter and they were kind of rude. After a bit GGnome and Runaway brought their stuff up and decided to camp where we were too. 


Coffeebean, bless him, went and got water. I filtered it while he made dinner of Lipton chicken noodle soup with 2 packages of Ramen noodles. I had had a craving for a chicken salad pack on a tortilla so I made that and ate it. Then I ate some of the soup and Ramen mix along with a small handful of Wheat Thin crackers and 6 strawberry sugar wafers. Not to mention guzzling 2 water bottles of Orange Crush mixed in water. Is “hiker hunger” hitting me now? Now, when we’re getting ready to get off trail? Oh, great! Now I’ll go home and eat like a pig and put back on the weight I just spent 210 miles trying to get rid of. :(



The little cell reception that we could get up here is very weird. Coffeebean was sitting on a log making dinner and had one bar. I was right next to him and had none. Frustrating.As for the threatened rain, it never really came about. During the day we would have sprinkles for about 10 minutes and then it would stop and then an hour later would happen again. Nothing soaking though. Yay!
We hiked 14.3 miles and are 15.5 miles from Reed’s Gap, where we get off! Coffeebean’s best friend is picking us up. Can’t wait but will really miss the friends we have made on this hike. We have invited Smooth, Tin Man, and Cool Whip to stay at our place when they get to Rockfish Gap.","Hog Camp Gap

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650206,"We thought we had heard it rain during the night but the tent rain cover only had a slight morning dew on it.  It was cool and pretty windy. I couldn’t find the damn cathole I dug last night so I had to cross my legs while I dug a new one! Argh! 


We decided to just eat a power bar and make breakfast a little later. We left camp before 7am, our earliest departure yet. Are we excited about getting home to sleep in our own bed??!


Speaking of sleeping in our own bed. Coffeebean has a long body pillow that he sleeps with at home. We named the pillow “Polly”. The first thing he said this morning when he woke up was “I can’t wait to see Polly.” What a goofball!


It took several hours to hike down the Priest mountain. We walked across VA 56 and down the path to the Tye River. There is a cool suspension bridge to cross it but instead we took the little side trail down to the river’s edge. It was sandy with big rocks to sit on and the sound of the river flowing by. It was a beautiful place and we talked about coming back here sometime with a picnic lunch. 


I had to go to the bathroom again and I was seeing poison ivy everywhere. It would be just my luck to hike all this time and miles to end up with poison ivy all over my butt 15 miles from home!




The hike up the first leg of Three Ridges Mountain wasn’t too bad. We rolled into the Harper’s Creek Shelter. The river literally flows right in front of it. You cross over the river on some rocks to get to the shelter. A few minutes later the riff-raff came in. Haha! Cool Whip, Tin Man, GGnome, Runaway, and 2 new hikers to us, Piñata and Platinum. Cool Whip made Coffeebean a cup of drip coffee. We sat and chilled and laughed till about 1pm and then Coffeebean and I took off.
The big climb was up to 4200’ and it was a BEAST!! The temps were in the high 80’s and we were dying. About 3/4 of the way up we ran out of water. Coffeebean was on his hands and knees trying to scoop drips of water off this little trickle coming down a rock. He got about 2 mouthfuls to hold him.
It was another mile when we finally reached the top. We had to rest! We were exhausted! Tin Man was there too and completely out of water. GGnome had a little. A short walk after that and we came to Hanging Rock. We knew we were near home now. We come up to Hanging Rock often to just sit and read and enjoy the view. Seeing this familiar site energized us enough to hurry down the mountain. We knew there was a good water source not showing on Guthook. And sure enough, there was Tin Man filling up right where we told him it would be. He wondered if his headache was from dehydration. We filled up too and then continued on to Maupin Field Shelter. New Shoes was there waiting for a couple of his buddies. We sat and rested for about 10 minutes but knew our ride home was waiting.


I have to say that in our previous trips I was always kicking butt when it came to downhills, ridge, and late day uphills. Coffeebean just couldn’t keep up with me. At home, when we would walk the neighborhood, he would always walk faster than me. He would say “How come I can walk faster than you on a neighborhood walk but put 30 pounds on your back and send you up a mountain and I can’t keep up.” This trip, however, he kicked my butt. I didn’t mind though because when I looked up and saw him walking with his poles in hand I knew the trail was level. If he was walking holding his poles loosely I knew it wasn’t a hard ascent. 


We left Maupin Field Shelter and one more small climb and then a nice level walk to Reed’s Gap. 


Jerry was waiting for us and had even talked a bit with Cool Whip before Cool Whip and GGnome and Runaway got a ride to Devil’s Backbone Brewery (and free camping for thru-hikers!)


We got home about 7:30-ish, stripped all stinky stuff off in the garage and hit the showers!

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652549,"We’re baaack! We drove up to my brother, Tom’s, house in Maine and spent a zero with him. The weather was very cool (in the 50’s) and rainy. (Good thing I packed my fleece on top of my pack for easy access. I was cold!) It was just a misty rain, less than a 1/4”. Tom said they really need rain here. 


We sat around and talked and watched a couple movies. We also took Tom out and had him drive our car a few times to get used to it. (Tom’s youngest car is a 2002 so a car with a fob and everything being electronic is new to him. The “lane assist” feature, that beeps when you go too close to the painted lane lines, drove him crazy at first. He said when he was taught to drive, the Driver’s Ed teacher said that if no one else was on the road with you you should “use the whole road”.) Just an easy day to relax and rest up after the long drive to Maine. 


We got up Sunday a little after 6am. When getting dressed we put on our gaiters. (For those not familiar, a gaiter cinches around your ankle and covers over the opening of your boot to keep trail trash out of your boots as you hike.) The bottom of the gaiter fastens to your boots with velcro. We realized that we hadn’t glued the matching pieces of Velcro to our new boots! Without it the gaiter doesn’t stay in place. Luckily Tom had Velcro and epoxy to fasten it! I knew I kept him as my brother for a good reason! He had us fixed up in no time!


After a breakfast of scrambled eggs and cereal (oatmeal for Tom, always 😁) and we were on our way to Warwick, NY. 



The trip wasn’t too bad. We ran into a bit of traffic which put us behind. We finally found the Burger King in the town of Warwick and had a meal to power us for the walk ahead. (By the way, Warwick is a cute little town with large, beautiful old homes and cute little restaurants.)
We drove to the parking area on 17-A, where we had come off trail before. We loaded up our packs and waved Tom off and then turned to find the trail. 



The next couple hours were nice trail with a couple awesome rock scrambles. The first rocks were at a point called Eastern Pinnacles. The breeze and view were wonderful.
We made it to the Wildcat Shelter, but Schnickles, a thru-hiker, said that Boy Scouts were staying at the shelter. We like Scouts but unfortunately they don’t understand what “hiker midnight” is so we decided to walk on. Schnickles mentioned a tent site at the Fitzgerald Falls, coming up, so we decided to head there. 


After hiking a bit more and then crossing a road, we came to a beautiful cleared woods with lots of tent sites and a stream right next to it. The falls are only .2 away but we don’t know how many sites are there and we know of at least 2 hikers stopping there so we pitched our tent in the woods. The road noise is a bit much but hopefully will quiet down at nightfall. After a dinner of Instant Breakfast and 3 of Tom’s famous chocolate chip cookies (Yes, siblings of mine, eat your hearts out!), we filtered some water for breakfast tomorrow and then hit the sack early. 


Today was a beautiful trail and weather day. We really only hiked a nero (near zero) of 3.8 miles. We didn’t sleep well last night - nerves and anxious about the hike ahead. Megan and Mackenzie sent us encouraging texts and gifs this morning like “You got this!” and Star Wars “The force is with you. Always”. They are so goofy!","17-A parking area

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652596,"We woke at 5:30 am feeling much better than last night. The air was cool but with my fleece on I was fine. Breakfast was 2 instant oatmeal and a cup of hot chocolate for me and cereal with powdered milk and hot chocolate for Coffeebean. We also had mini powdered donuts. Our splurge. After breakfast we finished packing up the tent and left at 6:50am. 


We walked the short distance to Fitzgerald Falls. It was really pretty. We started following a trail to the right but after 5 minutes couldn’t find any blazes so we circled back to the falls. There, right next to the falls, were steep steps running up along side it. 


When checking the maps for the day’s trail, if we saw any elevation we knew it was going to be tough. NY does not like switchbacks. Instead it loves rock scrambles. When we would see a huge mountain of rock we would think “I wonder if the trail goes around?” Then we would say “Oh wait! We are in NY. You only go straight up the rocks and over the top! None of this mamsy-pamsy going around!” 😂


We came down to West Mombasha Road to the most wonderful sight! Trail magic! Trail Angel Cindy had a spread like I haven’t seen in a long time. She had everything from cold drinks to fresh fruit to snacks. AND THEN! She had resupply! Everything a hiker needs on the trail. From food packets to medical supplies to jugs of water! And chairs to sit in! It was amazing! And she knew all the scoop about what was ahead of us. We stayed for a while and enjoyed the food and company. Her husband is going to thru-hike next year. We gave her all our contact info for him to call when he gets close to Waynesboro. 


We also met a section hiker name Hey You There in the Bushes. He is from Asheville, NC and gave us all his contact info and told us to please stop if we are in the area. 


We hated to leave but we were hoping to reach the Fingerboard Shelter tonight.  We hiked on and after an agonizing climb down a section called the Agony Grind we hit highway 17 and more trail magic!


Trail Angel Fred had Gatorade and brownies and homemade banana bread. And chairs! He also offered us handmade zipper pulls. We each took one, if not to use, than as a momento. We were getting ready to enter Harriman State Park and Fred knew all the dope about it. It seems Harriman Sr had been the governor of NY when Fred was a boy (He had to be in his 70-80’s now.). Harriman Jr grew up to be a foreign diplomat and went over to England. He met a married woman, had an affair with her and broke up her marriage. Her name was Pamela Churchill. She was married to Winston Churchill’s son, Randolph! It caused quite a scandal! Eventually she came here and married Averell Harriman. He had a boatload of money and created this state park. Fred told us other interesting things but I’ve gone on long enough. 


We waved goodbye to Fred and headed into the park. There is no stealth camping but Cindy said the rangers go home at 5pm so as long as you don’t go around advertising it, you can stealth camp. 


We came to a beautiful lake called Island Pond. We watered up. We wanted to get to the Fingerboard Shelter but we were getting tired. 


We were excited about getting to a rock formation called the Lemon Squeezer. We came to some rocks, kind of like an arch. It had the AT symbol so we knew we were in the right place. Just above the symbol, however, climbing straight up the rock face was a big black snake. We scooted past it quickly! Then we came to the Lemon Squeezer, a very narrow rock canyon! We had to take off our packs. Coffeebean went through first with his poles and water. My pack was so bulky to try and carry but I got it part way through and then was able to throw it up on a ledge. That was fun. 


Once it hit 5pm we started looking for a place to camp and found one a little after the Lemon Squeezer. We ate lunch for dinner (tuna packs with tortillas and water) and went to bed about 7:30. 


We hiked 10.6 miles today and had great trail magic so that was a successful day.","Stealth campsite 
",Stealth campsite ,"Jun 05, Sun",10.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652632,"We were up at 5:20 and out of our stealth camp by 6:05. We just ate a protein bar and decided to do breakfast at Fingerboard Shelter, just a couple miles away. We didn’t want to get caught by the rangers at Harriman State Park for camping where we shouldn’t. We are such outlaws!!


We rolled into Fingerboard and woke up Hey You There in the Woods. He is a very, very slow hiker. (I thought we were the slowest on the trail but he has us beat.) He said that he didn’t get into the shelter till midnight. He had seen 2 good sized bears by Pond Island so he kept walking. We asked if he had coughed several times going through the Lemon Squeezer and he said yes. We heard him and weren’t sure what made that noise :) He said night hiking was interesting and that the white AT blazes on the trees glow in the dark. 


After breakfast we said our goodbyes and talked about possibly meeting at the West Mountain Shelter. 


We stopped for lunch at the William Brien Memorial Shelter. It was built in the 1930’s by the CCC. It was made of huge stones and was  just beautiful. It had a bunkbed on each side and floor space for at least 5 more. After another exciting lunch of tuna (for me, SPAM for Coffeebean 🤮) and tortillas we headed out. Something we’ve noticed with the NY shelters, other than NO PRIVIES, is they have no logbooks. Any shelter we have been to up to NY had a logbook for hikers to leave notes and thoughts. (Before we got to the Fingerboard Shelter we came across an AT “mailbox “ along the trail with a logbook in it. I left a note for Cool Whip, Smooth, and Tin Man to hurry up and catch up. 


Leaving the shelter we had a heck of a time finding the AT blaze. We walked around everywhere and found it going up along side the shelter. You know, up the mountain of boulders that the shelter was built into. Of course!


We climbed up Black Mountain and at the top you could see all the way to the NYC skyline! It was a bit hazy but you could definitely see the skyline. It was so cool! (There is actually a 52 mile trail called the Long Path that will take you from Black Mountain right to the George Washington Bridge in NYC.) We came down the mountain and there was a big sign showing the detour around the Palisades Interstate Parkway. (A thru-hiker was killed in 2018 trying to cross this 6 lane highway.) The detour was obviously devised by a non-hiker because it was a 5 MILE DETOUR! No hiker in their right mind is going to add 5 miles and 2-3 hours onto their day to cross a road! 


We walked down to the highway. It was about 3:20pm. Not too busy a time of day. We cinched all our straps down so we could run without our packs flapping against our backs. Now it was time to play Frogger with AT hikers as the frogs! We held hands and ran across 3 lanes when the traffic cleared. Then there was a wide forested area to walk across (probably 3 car lanes wide) before you got to the other side and 3 lanes going in the other direction. All we could think was that maybe the hiker tried to cross at dusk, evening or rush hour. We had no problem. We won the Frogger game!


On the other side of the highway we came to a bridge and a great water source. Speaking of water, the damn BeFree filter is plugging up again. We are having to squeeze as hard as we can to get water through it and it’s a new filter! It has less than 250 miles on it. We are done with BeFree. Going back to Sawyer filter. (We mentioned our filter frustrations to Hey You and he gave us a Sawyer Mini that he was carrying as a backup. We were so happy and he said it helped lighten his load.) We have to get a connector and CNOC bag at the next outfitter and we are good to use the Sawyer and ditch the BeFree. 


We really wanted to get to the West Mountain shelter and give ourself a 10+ day. The last 1.5 miles were straight up a stone mountain!! It was brutal and we were really dragging. We had to stop and rest several times. Then we got to the shelter sign and remembered that it’s .6 into the shelter. Oh hell no! Usually there is a grassy area before you turn into a shelter but not here. Shelter path on the right. Down the cliff on the mountain on the left. We decided to hike on. Guthook said there were a couple stealth sites within .7 of a mile. 


We found a really nice site. Coffeebean found a great bear bag tree and a large snake skin too. I hope we don’t see either of those critters tonight. 


Dinner was chicken noodle soup (dry soup) with two packages of Ramen noodles, all cooked together. Coffeebean then hung the food bags. I worried about bears at the Harriman State Park stealth site. Hope we are lucky 2 nights in a row. 


We were in the tent before 7pm. Late in the night we could hear music playing LOUDLY from below. (A hiker in Guthook had made the following note: “A big shoutout to the person playing LOUD reggae music from midnight to 3am so we had to nighthike out.”)


Well we heard it too but it wasn’t constant and with the sound of the wind blowing it didn’t disturb us enough to get up and leave. We were surprised how loud it was and how clearly we could hear it at times on top of a mountain. 


We hiked 11.4 miles today and saw lots of cute toads too.","Stealth campsite 
",Just past West Mountain Shelter,"Jun 06, Mon",11.40
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652686,"We woke at 6am. We are worried about finding water. Sources are getting slim and by July a lot of them will be dry. I feel sorry for the bubble of hikers coming behind us. Breakfast was the last 2 mini powdered donuts for each of us. We need water before we can cook anything. 


Then wa-la! We found a small stream. We had to cup out water but at least we had water!



The next several minutes on the trail was spent walking though huge bushes of flowering mountain laurel on either side of the trail. The laurel doesn’t have a smell but it sure is pretty.
A while later we stopped for a mid-morning snack. We sat on a log and, as always, Coffeebean put his gum on the log. (Note: if you ever do any hiking between here and Georgia, be sure to check any logs before you sit down on one. You will probably find his gum. He has left more pieces of gum on logs!) Then he said “Where is my gum?” We found it. Stuck to the butt of his pants! I pulled off as much as I could and then used duct tape to get the rest off. I am a master gum-remover!
Our next big climb was up Bear Mountain. It had beautiful stone steps in many of the places but an escalator would have been even nicer. :) At the top of one of the views was a beautiful wooden bench dedicated to the memory of the chief forest ranger. We sat and enjoyed the view, sun, and lovely breeze. We called Mackenzie to wish her well on her plane trip. She has a carry-on plus a bag to check. Why so many clothes? She answered “Because “a girl has to have options!” That girl! There were a number of benches along the hike up. We texted Cool Whip about them. He once said that he always stops and sits when he sees a bench. 


When we reached the summit of Bear Mountain there was a beautiful stone tower - Perkins Memorial Tower. Even better! There were vending machines with cold drinks and ice cream! We bought some iced tea and loved the taste. (Somehow we ended up with 4! We’ll find out if we bought that many or it was a fluke when the credit card statement comes.) We’ll get ice cream next time. No flush toilets so I had to use a port-a-potty. Better than digging a cathole!  




The tower was really beautiful and you could climb to the top. On each level there were big pictures made from tiles showing the construction of the tower. The tiles were so beautiful. We really enjoyed that and it was a popular place. Very busy, even on a Tuesday.
The walk down to Bear Mountain Recreation Area was a mile but it was made for the public so the path was crushed stone with beautiful steps between. At the bottom were informational signs showing how workers built the steps and the cribbing wall along the path. No mortar was used, only gravity and pressure keeps everything in place. 



The recreation area was really crowded with school groups everywhere. The area had picnic tables and a beautiful “lake” with paddle boats and the old Bear Inn. We didn’t eat there but there was a restaurant. There were big grassy fields to run around on. Some of the kids were playing volleyball. There was a building that housed a stunning old merry-go-round. It was only open on the weekend too. (The schools in NY don’t get out until late June so I’m thinking that’s why most things aren’t open till the weekend.) There is also a small zoo called the Trailside Zoo and Museum. It is closed now during the week due to construction (but open on weekends!). The AT trail actually goes right through the zoo and thru-hikers get in for free. (The bear cage in the zoo is the lowest point on the AT.) The concession stand was closed because the zoo was closed so no hot hamburgers for lunch. Just our usual. We filled up our water bottles in the bathroom because the outdoor spigots were turned off too. We were so disappointed about the zoo. We took the path under the road and were then to follow a blue blaze around the zoo. The first blaze was by an open gate so we went through it but couldn’t find anymore blazes until a zoo worker told us we were in the zoo and it was closed. She was very nice and showed us where we could get put that would put us by the bridge we needed to cross. Opps. Well we got to see a few animals anyways.
We walked across the Hudson River over the Bear Mountain Bridge. It was quite a view and pretty windy. 


Once across the bridge we turned left and had to walk on the road for a bit. Then we crossed to the other side of the road and looked up. That was one tall mountain! And, yup, we had to climb it. No beautiful stone steps or crushed gravel this time. Ugh! Straight up over rocks and tree roots and no switchbacks. Today was more humid than the last few and it was mid afternoon so it was a killer! 


We finally got to the top and found a stream for water. Just above that was the Hemlock Springs Campsite. Rain was due at 5pm so we wanted to be setting up camp by 4. It was only 3:15 but we called it a day. Set up camp, ate dinner, and hung out in the tent. 



The rain has come in little spits here and there. It is supposed to rain until 7 am tomorrow then clear up for the day. We’ll see. It finally started to rain consistently about 6pm so we had to cook dinner under the foyer flap, carefully, so we didn’t burn the tent down. That would have sucked. We ate a Mountain House (dehydrated meal) for dinner (I didn’t eat much. Didn’t want to start tomorrow looking like a blowfish.)
Hiked 8.6 miles.","Stealth camp past West Mountain Shelter 
",Hemlock Springs Campsite,"Jun 07, Tue",8.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652733,"Another hiker had come in last night about an hour after us. We just chilled in the tent so we really didn’t get to meet him. This morning I heard him moving around about 4:15 am. He left about 5:15. The rain had stopped before 4 am. 


After packing up a wet tent, we were on the trail about 7:10 having only eaten a power bar for breakfast. The Appalachian Deli is only 3.6 miles and it has an egg, cheese, and bacon sandwich calling my name! I ended up getting it on a roll and the roll was big! Coffeebean got the same thing in a hero sandwich. We expected a 6” sandwich. It was a foot long. First he said “Gee, if I had known it was this big we could have shared it.” Yeah, right! He ate the whole thing himself with no problem! We did share a quart of milk. Coffeebean had his first real cup of coffee since getting on trail. I had a nice cup of Lipton tea. 


We used this time too to dry out our tent by laying it out on the lawn and holding it down with our poles. Between the sun and the traffic whooshing by, the tent and canopy dried pretty quickly. The deli also had great resupply so we got enough to hold us for the next 48 miles, into Connecticut. We also bought a SmartWater so we could finally use the Sawyer filter that Hey You gave us.The trail, for a good part of the day, was muddy and we spent alot of time jumping from rock to rock to logs that had been put in the mud to help get through without ending up with shoes covered in mud. The humid weather and previous night’s rain had also brought the mosquitoes out in full force.
A fun part of the afternoon was when we came upon a family of hikers. The daughter, trail name Cheeto because she loves Cheetos and was wearing alot of orange, mom (a teacher), trail name Clever Girl, and dad, who was still looking for a trail name. They hiked 100 miles last summer in the Shenandoah National Park. They are doing a 125 mile section this summer. They had just gotten on trail today. Cheeto was 8 years old and said that none of her friends believed that she walked 100 miles last summer. She carried her own pack (but mom said it only had her sleeping bag and clothes) Cheeto said it still felt like she was carrying 30 pounds. She was so cute!! We wished them luck and happy trails. 


Water filtering is so much easier and faster with the Sawyer filter. We are happy campers!


We came to a road crossing and just up the way was a roadside historical sign. It told about the Continental Army from Hempstead NY camping nearby here in 1779-1780 and an inoculation hut that had been built nearby. We crossed the road and found the rock remains of the foundation of a colonial barn that had been used as an inoculation hut. When a smallpox epidemic broke out in the winter of 1776, George Washington ordered that all his troops be inoculated. The remains of a barn could also be seen on the other side of the trail. So cool! The 1700’s and the foundations are still there!


We finally arrived at the Dennytown Road Campsite. The sign showed where the hiker trash was allowed to camp. Not in the nice field with the picnic tables and port-a-potties (with TP!) but right next to the busy road. There is a small building with a water spigot so we are happy. I walked up to check out the other nice camping area (for groups who make reservations at the Clarence Fahnestock State Park). It was very nice! A sunny area with 2 picnic tables, a grill, 3 port-a-potties, and a campfire ring. Then a small shady area with the same except the potties. I was walking back to tell Coffeebean about it and discuss moving to this site and claiming ignorance if someone questioned why we were there, when I heard this LOUD BOOM! Then I heard Coffeebean yell my name. I was terrified that something had happened to him! Then I heard him yell ”Call 911!” (He had given me his phone because he had taken a picture of the camping areas.) You should have heard me trying to tell the 911 operator where the accident was. I was able to remember the name of the road at least and just said “It’s where the AT crosses Dennytown Road at the parking area. I’m a thru-hiker.” Luckily another woman had stopped too and was calling at the same time. 


I ran down the road toward Coffeebean and saw him leaning into a car that was flipped upside down in the middle of the road! It was a mom and her 2 sons. The boys were in their late teens. The one son was out of the car by the time Coffeebean got there. He didn’t have a scratch on him. The two of them helped unbuckle the mom and got her out. She will have a really nasty bruise on her left arm. The other son was hanging by his belt and yelling loudly and groaning. He kept asking what had happened. He was so scared. We finally got him unbuckled but didn’t want to move him until the ambulance came. We waited at least 20 minutes until the police and fire crews arrived followed by the EMT squad, staying with the family until then. 


Coffeebean said he saw big pieces of rock in the road and wondered if the mom had hit it and that caused her to spin out. It also looked like she bounced off a tree up on the side of the road because a huge section of bark was torn off. What got me was how high up on the side of the road the tree was. She had to have flown up the side of the road, hit the tree and then overturned on the way down. It was a frightening scene. We worried about the condition of the other son all night. 


Coffeebean helped with traffic, telling people the road was blocked and they would have to turn around. One woman had the nerve to say “But I just live right there!” Coffeebean told her the car was in the middle of the road and debris was everywhere. What an idiot she was. Never asked if anyone was hurt. Just concerned about the inconvenience to her. 


After all the excitement died down, we made dinner (mashed potatoes and a chicken alfredo side), got water, and hit the sack. Rain is due tomorrow morning about 2am and supposed to run until about 9 or 10am, so tomorrow may be a short mileage day. 


We hiked 12.38 miles today though!","Hemlock Springs Campsite
",Dennytown Road Campsite,"Jun 08, Wed",12.38
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652798,"We were supposed to get .9 inches of rain but the rain that battered our tent was heavier than that. It was supposed to stop around 9 or 10am but it must have stopped sooner because it was clear when I got up at 8. I spoiled myself and walked over to the group camping area and used a port-a-potty and THEIR TP. 


I came back and woke Coffeebean. We packed up and walked over to the group camping and laid the wet tent and canopy on one picnic table and we ate breakfast at the other. Everything was dry by the time we were ready to leave at 10:10am. Late start but that’s ok. 



The trail was a challenge today. A good part of it was puddles, some going down the trail for yards and some just enough to jump over. We walked carefully over the rocks and tree roots. Those are so slippery when wet or even damp.
Water isn’t going to be an issue today. The small streams were flowing well and the larger ones were torrents of rushing water. More than once we stopped to put our phones in waterproof bags and cinch up our straps to cross a river with strong flowing water. 


Today has been tough. We didn’t sleep well with the rain and traffic so we struggled. 


Just before hitting the NY 301 road, we came across a beautiful shrine to those who are grieving a loss. It was an old fashioned rotary dial telephone attached to an exhibit board with the title “Telephone of the Wind”. It was put there by a local grief therapist in honor of the first one created in Japan. (In 2010 a garden designer in Japan built a telephone booth in his garden so he could “talk” to his late cousin. Coffeebean said he had seen this on the CBS Sunday Morning program once.) Next to the phone were instructions to “use it to connect to the ones you have lost. To feel the comfort of their memory. May you hear their voices in the wind.” I dialed my beloved mom and dad and told them I missed them. 


Stopped at a picnic table at Canopus Lake Beach. The breeze was wonderful and so was the sun. It’s a beautiful little lake with a nice sandy beach. After eating we walked up to the concession stand. Of course it is only open on WEEKENDS right now. Our dreams of hot hamburgers are getting dimmer and dimmer! But the bathrooms and water fountains were open so we got to use a flush toilet and not have to filter our water. Silver lining, I guess. We also spoke to a gentleman that was working there. He is a member of the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Club. His trail name is Bascom Grillmaster. He told me about the meeting in October of the ALDHC at Williams College in Massachusetts and encouraged us to come. 


We then followed the blue blaze to the new shelter built in 2021. It’s very nice but spartan. No water, no privy, but a huge field for tents. After a short discussion we decide to stop here. Like I said, we struggled some today and had a late start. Tomorrow we will get up at usual at 5:30am and plan to get to the shelter 13 miles from here. 


Even on a short day of 4 hours hiking we still did 6.2 miles. Slowly but surely we will get better.","Dennytown Road Campsite
",Canopus Lake Beach Shelter (Raymond Torrey Memorial Shelter),"Jun 09, Thu",6.20
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652857,"We woke at 5:30am. I was up first and let Coffeebean sleep a few more minutes. The traffic noise from the Tatonic State Parkway was horrible. It sounded like the road was right next to us! Coffeebean had trouble sleeping again. 



The canopy was dewy but the sun was out so we knew it would dry soon. We ate breakfast first (I had chocolate Instant Breakfast and a strawberry oatmeal pkt. Coffeebean had his 3 oatmeal and a cup of instant coffee.) and then walked the short way to the concession stand hoping that the bathrooms would still be open. They were! No catholes for us this morning!! We filled our water bottles at the drinking fountain. As we turned to leave we noticed food wrappers all over the patio area. A hiker (We could tell by the food.) had put his garbage in one of the trash cans but didn’t tie the bag closed. The cans are upside down until the weekend when everything opens and he/she just turned it right-side up and dumped their trash. Coffeebean and I spent about 15 minutes picking up all the trash and then tying the bag closed. I know the birds weren’t happy but at least the folks there wouldn’t be cussing out thru-hikers.
By 7:35 we had a packed dry canopy, full water bottles, and were on the trail. 



The trail was a little drier today compared to yesterday. And the weather was beautiful! Not humid and not too hot. Even a nice breeze. Why can’t every day be like this?
I believe we were at the top of Shenandoah Mountain, on a rocky summit. The view was amazing. Green mountains all around. Also, there was an American flag painted onto the rocks with the words “In memory of Sept 11”. It was beautifully drawn. 



Then it was time to go down the mountain after climbing up it. I walked right past a turtle hiking the trail. Coffeebean called me back to look at it and then he carefully put it in the bushes on the side so he wouldn’t get squished by an unobservant hiker (like me!)
I would also like to give a shoutout to my awesome niece, Kaitlyn, for the great socks she gave me for Christmas. I was afraid they might be a bit too heavy and crowd the little toes on each foot, but I put them on today and had my most comfortable foot day yet. My socks were nice and soft and cushy on my poor feet. (Speaking of little toes. Lost the toenail on my left pinky toe. Haven’t had a long distance hike yet that I didn’t lose both of them. Just a matter of time before the right pinky toe follows suit. 😞)


Another shoutout to our youngest, Megan, starting her first professional job. Welcome to the grind, Meg!


Yesterday we had planned to stop at the Shenandoah Campsite. I’m glad we didn’t because we would have been mad at ourselves for not pushing a little further to the RPH Shelter. 


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> not be an elevator but it was a fallout shelter and first aid station! 😂 And it was right on the AT! There was also a sign showing that we are 26.8 miles from the Connecticut border!


After oohing and ahhing about the RPH Shelter, we moved onward and, of course, upward. Coffeebean has had an upset stomach since yesterday and I am worried that he may have gotten some bad water. We always filter but the filter is only 99%. He is struggling on the ups and I don’t think we are going to do 13 today, which is fine. I would rather have him feeling better. 


Another thing that amazes us on our hikes through the woods are when we come across handmade stone walls or fences. You can tell they are not random because they are put together like puzzle pieces. Some are only 3-4 feet high and others are 15-20 feet. Some only stretch for 50 yards or so and others go farther than we can see. Yesterday we were walking on a trail that was about 5 feet wide but nothing on either side, just straight down. We looked over the side and realized that we were actually walking along the top of a 15 foot high stone wall! It was beautiful wall and we walked for several minutes on it. That’s how long it was. The work that was put into making these walls, with some of the rocks being heavy enough that 2 men at least would be needed to move them. And why were they created where they were? Were farms here at one time or we they used during a war? I would love to talk to an historian about them. 


We hit NY 52 and went down the road 1/2 a mile to Cornnado’s Pizzeria. It is widely touted on Guthook as being delicious and having super hiker friendly owners. We ordered spaghetti for Coffeebean and I had the baked ziti. They came with side salads too. Then they brought out complimentary garlic knots with marinara sauce!  We ate every bite and washed it down with Pepsi. We sat there just chilling for a bit and they brought us cups of complimentary lemon sorbet. How awesome is that?! We were told there was a shady grassy area out back to put up our tents. There was water and an outlet to charge your phones too!


We got the tent up and CoffeeBean laid down. I went to buy him a bottle of cold water and the lady in the pizzeria waved my money away and said not to worry about it! This place totally rocks!!


Coffeebean is laying next to me now asleep but is totally zipped up in his bag and complaining that it is cold and he is shivering. I am sitting here in shorts and a t-shirt. It is not cold out. I have turned off the alarm. We will see what what tomorrow brings. I wish there was a hotel near but I think we are 2-3 days out.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652953,"OMG!! What is it with noise and camping in New York!! We have not stayed anywhere yet where we couldn’t hear traffic of some kind. We camped behind a restaurant last night so we knew we would have some traffic noise till about 10pm or so. We did have a couple walk in about 9:15pm, talking in normal voices and then shining their flashlights all over including towards our tent. I asked them to Shhh once and they quieted down but at 10pm they were still shining their lights back and forth and lighting up our tent like a search light looking for an escaped convict. I went out to talk to them and they were holding these little lantern-like lights. The reason I came out went totally out of my head. All I could think was “Holy crap! How heavy are those lights! They look like they weigh a ton!” Then I remembered why I was really there. I explained about their lights flashing through our tent. They apologized and said they were having trouble getting the lower half of their tent to stay up. Their tent was shaped kind of like a cocoon with a big arch over your heads and a smaller arch over the feet. The arch at the feet kept collapsing flat. I didn’t know how that type of tent worked so I was no help. 


So just before sunrise, the business across the road started up. I believe it is a cement plant but the racket was unbelievable! It sounded like stones being poured into trucks and hammering and banging. Just unbelievable!!


Coffeebean was feeling a little better. The chills were gone (Our on-call nurse said that he could have been running a low-grade fever.) We’ll see how he does as the day progresses. 


When we got out of the tent the canopy was dewy. (I noticed the couple must have given up on the foot arch because it was laying flat.) Coffeebean went into the little market store and bought a breakfast wrap and a half gallon of milk. (The milk cost $5.98!). We shared the wrap and milk for breakfast but I only ate a little of the wrap, preferring an Instant Breakfast instead. 


We were on our way by 7:35. The day was already feeling warm and you could feel the humidity in the air. They are calling for rain again tomorrow morning. 



The trail is getting drier (just in time for more rain) but there are still spots that get no sun so they are still really muddy.
Hiking wasn’t bad today. A few ups but nothing horrible. I think we are getting close to having our trail legs and lungs. Yay!


Coffeebean and I have been talking about our lunch diet and about how much we hate it (tortillas and tuna packets!). When we resupply tomorrow we are going to get regular size Snickers bars (high in calorie), nuts, and protein bars. We will try those for lunch for a while and see how that works. We will get more calories from those than the tuna and tortilla. 


Today we saw more stone walls/fences. They were about 4 feet high and ran in both directions. One way we could see the end. The other way just went on and on. I take pictures every time I see them. I think they are just a marvel of workmanship. 


We really wanted to do 12 miles today, if Coffeebean was up to it. He felt fairly well during the day but as it got later he began feeling queasy again and then started having gastrointestinal problems too. 


We made it to the Telephone Pioneers Shelter. It has a privy! When we worked at Nortel Networks, we were members of the Telephone Pioneers. They are a group of people that work in the telephony industry and do community work. One year Coffeebean helped repaint the United States on a children’s playground. (There was a hiker at the shelter and she said that no one she met could explain the name of this shelter. Now she knows.)



The tent sites here are pretty slopey but we found one that wasn’t too too bad and it’s close to the privy. The rain forecast changed and it was supposed to be 100% at 4pm but we got nothing. Now they are talking 50% at 11am tomorrow and going upwards till 3pm. Hope it stays out long enough for us to run in for resupply and then find a stealth site before the rain really starts. Or maybe it will just move out of the area all together!
Well we hoped this would be a quieter shelter because we heard no traffic. Then doesn’t someone crank up their lawnmower! We can’t win!


Hiked 12.2 miles today.","Corrnado’s Pizzeria in Stormville, NY
",Telephone Pioneers Shelter ,"Jun 11, Sat",12.20
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652954,"Stayed at Telephone Pioneers shelter last night on a very slopey site. It was the least slopiest. I spent a good part of the night leaning towards Coffeebean and falling off my sleeping pad. About 9pm we heard this huge boom (i jumped in my sleeping bag!) and then continual explosions for the next 40 minutes. After a bit we decided it was fireworks.


We didn’t get up till a little after 6am. Coffeebean’s stomach is starting to feel a little better. We really think the SPAM, that I vacuum packed into separate bags, was the culprit. For two days he has felt miserable, between nausea and gastrointestinal problems. You know how bad that makes you feel. Now put yourself out on the trail carrying 30+ pounds and walking all day up and down mountains. Yeah, now that’s sick. 


But today he feels better and we think the worst is past. We ate breakfast and got on our way about 8:35am.


We got down to the road crossing at Leather Hill Road and there was trail magic!  Fully stocked drinks and snacks! From Chris, the Trail Angel. It’s the same Chris that is touted in Guthook. We had Gatorade and some crackers. Met another hiker named Crunch, from Switzerland. He does 30-35 miles a day!! He showed us his picture of the NYC skyline at night! The sky was black and the buildings were alight with different colors. It was gorgeous! We were so jealous. We never thought of taking a picture at night. We would have had to hike back a bit but it would have been worth it. 


We ended up at Wiley Shelter, the last NY shelter NOBO on the AT, and ate lunch. Connecticut is calling us!! We saw a bird’s nest over the entrance to the shelter (and lots of bird droppings on the ground) and saw 4 baby birds sticking their heads out. Coffeebean watched one climb out of the nest so he could poop. Nice kid. 


I called Chris, the local Trail Angel, and asked if she was available to take us in for resupply. She answered within minutes and said she could meet us at the road in 10 minutes. We packed up and hurried down. It was only .2 to the road. It gave us time to put on our camp shirts so we didn’t  gag people in the grocery store. (Haven’t showered in 9 days so we are a little rank.)


Chris is super nice and said that a better resupply would be the Hannaford in Pawling. So she drove us there and told us to take our time. I grabbed a couple of my Walmart bags, that I use to cover my boots at night when it calls for rain, because NY does not use plastic. You have to bring your own bags or they will give you paper. We did our resupply and then took everything out of the boxes and gave the boxes to Chris to recycle. She brought us back to the trail and off we went. (Chris has been hiking the trail sections at a time. She said she was hiking from Daleville, VA for a month in mid-Sept. We told her that is where we live and we would love to host her when she comes through.)


Once on trail we walked to the river. There was once a foot bridge but it had deteriorated and was no longer passable. There was a 1.5 road walk detour but the comments on Guthook said it was easy to hop across the rocks to cross the river. So we did that and kept following the blazes. I pulled my app out to check how far we had gone and it showed that we were way off trail! I was pissed and cussing like a sailor! I hiked back the way we had come and was still not showing on trail. We finally called it quits and set up a stealth camp by the river. It’s due to rain around 9 or 10 tonight and finish by 4am. Then sunny for the next 4 days. After we got in the tent, Coffeebean was looking through his AWOL book, think printed Guthook, and found a note that the bridge was out and there was a 1.5 mile road walk detour until further notice. We think Guthook put the detour in the app and that’s why it appeared like we were off trail. I calmed down after that. 


Hiked 9.5 miles today not counting the mile that we walked twice! 😤","Telephone Pioneers Shelter 
",Stealth camp by river down from Duell Rd,"Jun 12, Sun",9.50
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653055,"We had no service last night by the river. The rain came in the middle of the night but was gone by the time we awoke at 5:30am. We could see blue sky breaking through the clouds. Today is supposed to be sunny. 


After breakfast and packing the wet stuff into plastic bags (Coffeebean carries the canopy when it is wet because a wet tent and canopy weigh alot more.) we were still able to cross the river rock hopping. We eventually came to the Ten Mile River. It was really wide and had a nice foot bridge to cross by. Just before it was an open field. The sun was out so we decided to stop and dry everything. We could hold up the canopy and the wind would catch it like a parachute. Everything dried quickly. While we were drying out Teddybear passed us. 



The day was incredibly hot and humid. I hike with a kerchief tied to my shoulder strap to wipe sweat, I mean perspiration. (I can hear my mother now “Animals sweat. Ladies glisten.”) Well I “glistened” all day long, by the bucketfuls! There wasn’t a dry spot on my kerchief! Add to that that this is day 10 without a shower. We do admit that we are tired of being sweaty and wearing wet clothes.
We got just about to the top of a hellacious mountain and we decided to stop for lunch. There was another couple there that were section hiking. They would drive farther north and then hike SOBO. His name is Eric and he is a high school computer science teacher and she (we didn’t get her name) is an RN at the children’s hospital near Akron, Ohio. They were so fun to talk to. They said they would take their kids backpacking when the kids were younger. He said they knew they were doing it right (parenting) when one day one of the kids yelled from the bathroom “It sure is nice to have a flush toilet!” He said that was a sign that their kids weren’t taking things for granted. We all laughed at that. He mentioned that the one thing he misses most on trail is ice. He told us if he saw us tomorrow he would bring a Gatorade. We said our goodbyes and a minute later Teddybear showed up. He told us about the dad and son that he met in one of the shelters a few shelters back. We said we had stopped there to use the privy and the dad suggested that I wash my hands after using it because he had been sick the previous night. They had only been on trail a couple days. Well Teddybear said the boy was now throwing up and he told the dad they had norovirus. The dad didn’t believe him because he was only sick a day but noro runs 1-3 days. And when I say “run” I mean it literally, out both ends. A nasty business is noro. Teddybear said he hightailed it out of there!


I forgot to mention that Eric had also warned us of a tree covered in bees that we would be coming up to shortly. He said there was supposed to be a warning sign but they never saw one. We saw the sign! Someone had taken sticks and made out the word “BEES” in a square right on the trail about 20 feet from the tree. You could see the bees all over this tree! So what did we do? We made a “beeline” down the trail as far from the tree as possible. Pun intended! Haha!


We continued the killer climb then went downhill and then another smaller climb and downhill to the Mt Algo Shelter. There was a beautiful big stream in front for water. You crossed the stream walking across 2 big logs. It had beautiful pine-needled tent sites and a privy. There was a gentleman there, with no trail name, that had tried to leave the day before, had slipped crossing a stream nearby, and soaked everything including his phone. He was planning to head into Kent tomorrow to see about his phone. 


A couple from Pennsylvania, named Thurston (a teacher) and Shauna (a college athletic trainer), were also there. They are section hiking and will have 1400 miles done. I told Shauna that my oldest daughter’s name is also Shauna. She said “With a W or a U?” I said with a U and she said “Good, you spelled correctly.” We all laughed. 


Teddybear came in a while after and then, when I was down getting water, Clydesdale came in. She is a 20-ish solo flip-flopper from Pennsylvania. She started in Delaware Water Gap on the PA/NJ border. We all sat at the picnic table and ate dinner and had great conversation! We talked until 8:30!! Almost unheard of for hikers! I will miss chatting with these folks for sure! Clydesdale, Shauna, and Thurston will be doing big miles tomorrow and Teddybear is going into Kent, CT to resupply, shower, and laundry and then hiking 6 miles to the shelter so we probably won’t be seeing any of them again. 😭 One of the great things about the trail is the people you meet.


Oh another thing we talked about were all the caterpillars! Teddybear asked if we had heard the caterpillars chewing. He said when he stopped for a break he could hear the noise. On the trail you can see leaf pieces that look like green confetti. The trail is loaded with them! These are gypsy moth caterpillars and last year CT had an infestation of these horrible things. They are everywhere! They fall on you when you’re sitting. Coffeebean had clothes hanging off his pack to dry (he looks like a walking clothesline) and I had to pick the nasty little things off his clothes. Shauna said when she was a child she remembered her mother coming to pick her up at the bus stop because the ground was so littered with caterpillars that your shoes would be black by the time she got home.  


So we ended a tough day with lots of laughs and stories and hiked 12.6 miles to boot! (Oh! Another pun! 😂)","Stealth camp by river down from Duell Rd
",Mt Algo Shelter,"Jun 13, Mon",12.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653053,"I had a good night’s sleep listening to the soft sounds of the nearby river. Shauna and Thurston left before I could say goodbye or get their picture for our hiker photo album. Darn it! I was able to get pictures of Clydesdale and Teddybear before they headed out. 


We started out and the day was already getting warm even at 8:00 in the morning. The humidity is going to be bad again today. 


We hiked down a gigantic rock scramble called St. John’s Ledges (I would love to know where some of these names come from.). It was really steep coming down and many times I put my pole straps on my wrist so I could use my hands to climb down. At one point I put my foot on the ground and it went straight down into a hole about 6” deep. The other thing too were the caterpillars. They were all over the rocks! It was so gross. Day hikers we pass just say “The season is almost over.”  Caterpillars have a season?


A really nice part of today’s hike was walking along the Housatonic River. A flat trail ran along side the river with a lovely breeze. We walked like that for over 4 miles. It was great. 


Of course we knew it couldn’t last forever. Just after we turned off the riverside trail and started up the mountain we had to stop and get water from a pipe spring. There is no water at the Silver Hill Campsite where we are spending the night so we had to fill up here. We also each carried an extra liter so we would have enough to cook dinner and breakfast. 


On our way up to the campsite, we met Eric (trail name Rock Steady) and his wife (we learned her name is Elaine) again. Coffeebean saw them first and yelled “Hey, you’re late!” and they laughed. We talked for a few minutes and Eric admitted that he forgot the Gatorade that he promised but hopefully would see us again tomorrow and bring it. 


We hiked upward to the Silver Hill Campsite. It had a number of tent sites, a privy, a pavilion with 2 picnic tables (the tables were in sad shape though), a deck with benches, and a swing. After we got the tent up Coffeebean stretched out on the deck and I sat on the swing. The swing was a little tall so I had to sit on the edge of the seat for my stubby legs to reach the ground. I love swings! I also pulled the netting out of my hat and wore it over my head because the gnats and no-seeums were really annoying. 


Later we had a dinner of Mountain House beef stroganoff. We hit the sack about 7pm. This is a nice campsite. Very quiet. 


We hiked 10.54 miles today.","Mt Algo Shelter
",Silver Hill Campsite ,"Jun 14, Tue",10.54
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653133,"No one else camped at the Silver Hill Campsite so we had the place to ourselves. We ate a breakfast of powdered milk and Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds and packed our pants side pockets with snacks for the day. Before packing up the tent we had to wash caterpillar goo off the canopy. It’s a black goo that comes out of dead caterpillars. It’s gross. Everything about them is gross, as I’m sure I have mentioned before. Before we hike out we always look back to make sure we haven’t left anything. 


Today is day 12 without a shower. We can now smell each other. Coffeebean always says that skunks can’t smell each other. Well, we can. 



The hiking was hot and so many of the trees are dead that we had no canopy to hike under, no relief from the sun. We’re guessing that the caterpillars are the cause. Last year’s infestation just decimated the trees.
One positive thing is the wonderful smell of pine as we walk. And walking on pine needles is so soft. 


We went through another rock formation similar to the Lemon Squeezer in New York. Connecticut’s version of the Lemon Squeezer. It was a little easier than the NY version but still fun!


We stopped at Pine Swamp Branch Shelter for lunch. We finished up the last of the cheese. Coffeebean took a short nap. He didn’t sleep well again last night. Merit, a section hiker, stopped and set up her hammock (even though it was only about 12:30). She said she had promised herself 7 miles and then she would stop, so she did. She is section hiking southern MASS, CT, NY, and NJ.



The trail in the afternoon wasn’t too, too bad. A few minor ups but alot of fairly level trail too. Coffeebean’s right knee has been buckling on him when he goes up or down.We finally got to Belter’s Campsite about 5:00pm. There is poison ivy everywhere so I am trying to be really careful where I walk. 


We were both exhausted so Coffeebean didn’t feel like making dinner and I didn’t feel like eating. We just ate some granola bars and mixed nuts. We laid in the tent snoozing and I checked the local weather. Sunny for the next several days…Then it started raining. What?!


So Guthook, which I use, said we hiked 13.74 miles. AWOL, which Coffeebean uses, said we hiked 12.0 miles. I like my number better. 😁","Silver Hill Campsite

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653136,"Because I ate nuts and a granola bar for dinner, I HAD to use the privy first thing. I
couldn’t find the privy anywhere! I went back to the front of the trail, that leads into the campsite, to check the map. It was supposed to be behind campsite #4. I couldn’t find that site either! So I had to dig a cathole and try not to get poison ivy on my butt.


Even though it had rained for a short bit last night, the tent was completely dry. (Just had to clean off the caterpillar goo, of course.) No oatmeal today! We are hitting the Mountainside Cafe for breakfast!


We started down to the road and after about 2 minutes it started raining good so we stopped and put on our pack covers. Didn’t bother putting on rain gear because our clothes were still damp and clammy from yesterday’s sweaty hike. 


We got down to the road and had to wander around a bit before we found it. (I updated Guthook for the next hiker.) We put our packs and poles on the little front porch and then went around the back to switch out our hiking shirts for less stinky camp shirts. Then we went in and were seated. I ordered the Streusel French Toast and hot tea. Coffeebean ordered the Spinach Skillet and coffee, of course. (The spinach skillet had toast and mushrooms, onions, potatoes, eggs, and tomato jam.) The food was absolutely amazing! Best french toast I’ve ever had! And the food is all farm to table. It is fresh and comes from local farmers, growers and producers.


I also read that the “Mountainside Cafe is affiliated with Mountainside Treatment Center, offering a vocational work program for extended care clients of the treatment center. They  teach real life “sober” work skills for the clients in preparation to continue a sober life once graduated.” What a great cause. 


After that amazing breakfast we watched to see if the rain would continue but it didn’t so we started out. The hike for the next hour or so was so nice. Once again we walked a trail along the Housatonic River. At one point it widened to make it wheelchair accessible. How great is that?! Once we crossed into the cute little town of Amesbury (a hamlet of Falls Village) we saw the prettiest waterfalls. We took the steep little trail down to the river’s edge so we could get better pictures of the falls. It was so pretty.
We then began the biggest up of the day, Mt Prospect. And it actually was not bad. The temperature was cool. There was a wonderful breeze which kept us cool. And the smell of the pine needles was intoxicating. And we finally had a canopy to walk under! I guess the caterpillars hadn’t hit Mt Prospect yet. At the top of the mountain was a beautiful view of the valley below. 



Then we met Eric (trail name Rock Steady) and Elaine AGAIN! Had a fun conversation. I told her about a cup that I had seen on Instagram that let’s you make your own slushies. (She said yesterday she kept thinking about how much she wanted a slushie.) I told Eric “Christmas gift!”
On the way down the mountain, I was breathing through my nose and somehow sniffed a bug up my nose! I’m sure it wasn’t a fun time for the bug either but I couldn’t stop blowing my nose or sneezing. This went on for an hour! Ow!


As we reached the road that would take us into Salisbury, CT, we met the family that Eric and Elaine kept telling us about. A mom, dad, and their 3 sons. They started May 31st and are doing a flop-flop. We walked and talked with them all the way into town. We then continued on to the home where we are getting a shower, doing laundry, and spending the night.


We got to the home of Maria McCabe. She will be 93 years old in August and has been opening her home to hikers for 20 years. For $40 each we got a private room in her beautiful old home. She is so interesting to talk to. She told us she met her husband when he was stationed in Italy during WWII. They married in Piza, Italy and moved to the States. Her grandson, Eddie, watches over her and cooks her meals. 


We walked to the local grocery store and bought a sandwich of turkey, coleslaw, and thousand Island dressing. (We changed our minds about walking the 1.5 miles to the laundromat. I just hand-washed some clothes in the sink at the house.) Also chips, milk, and Hostess cupcakes. Really nutritious, right? But great town food!
