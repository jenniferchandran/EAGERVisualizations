Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649232,"I live in Enterprise, Kansas with my wife Beth of 36 years. Enterprise is 6 miles east of Abilene, the birthplace of President Eisenhower. His presidential library, museum, and boyhood home are all on the Eisenhower complex. Eisenhower was the commanding general of the European theater in WW2. There are lots of interesting exhibits related to WW2, and his 8 years as president of our country from 1952-1960. The prairies of Kansas are a great place for quail and pheasant hunting, something that my dogs and I love to do. Though not mountainous, the Flint Hills of Kansas are certainly not flat. We don't have the trees that exist on the AT, but God certainly made a diverse and beautiful country that we call home.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Wed",0
Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649233,"Today is our last day at home. Beth will drive myself, Pat, Brian Cook, and his wife Terri to Georgia beginning tomorrow afternoon. Myself, Pat (pictured pointing a covey of quail) and Brian intend on being successful thru-hikers of the AT. Brian and I each have backpacks that weigh in at about 32 pounds each. Pat has her own backpack, and her's will weigh 6 pounds at the maximum and decrease as she eats her food.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Wed",0
Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649886,"Well it has been a very humbling experience in the first week of our thru hike. Brian and I thought that we would cruise right through the trail at the very start. Boy was I and he ever wrong! For starters we didn't start the Approach Trail hike until 5:30 pm on Friday the 22nd. There is somewhere between 700 and 740 stairs that you climb at the early portion of that trek. That was probably the most brutal part of our first 8 days. It was hot, sweaty, and hard. The approach trail is 8.8 miles. In Kansas when Pat and Maggie and I would hike 7.5 miles with my backpack on it would take about 2 hours and 10 minutes. On those hikes my backpack weighed generally 27 pounds. My actual total backpack weight hiking the trail ranges from 32 to 37 pounds depending on how much food and water I'm packing.Kansas is flat as a pancake compared to the AT. You are usually either going uphill or downhill, with lots of rocks to navigate. Our long day was 15 miles. A gentlemen I talked to on Preacher's Mount from Florida said his workout regimen was the same as mine. Using a stair stepper, and hiking the flatlands of Florida. I believe he successfuly thru-hiked, but it takes persistence and fortitude. Brian Cook has been invaluable to me. His army experience and general knowledge of camping exceeds my experience, which prior to this was zero.3 days ago I fell 2 times in the rocks in the last half mile of our day. I finally realized that the long canvas type pants were causing me trouble trying to step up on high rocks as well as on long steps down rocks. I bought a pair of lightweight Patagonia shorts at Neels Gap and now wear those. No falls since then.One thing that disappoints me is that I determined that it's probably in Pat's best interest to send her home to Kansas. The mantra on the trail is Hike Your Own Hike. But when you have your dog it becomes Hike Your Dog's Hike. I'm afraid with the warm temperatures that we've experienced it would be detrimental to her health to make her go the miles that we're going. At nighttime we have had some cold nights though. I believe that it was Tuesday night we were camping at a tent site high on a mountain. The wind was blowing hard and a cold front moved in that put the temperature in the low 30's. I woke up at 3 am and poor Pat was shivering badly from the cold. I have a mummy sleeping pad that isn't conducive to having a dog be in it with you, but I got her in and she was very grateful. Every night since she has gotten in to my bag at some point in the night.What else was new to me? Going 8 days without a shower. I knew going in that you had to embrace the stink as part of the process. But I can tell you when you""re working up sweats all day without bathing for 8 days you do smell! Finally today on Friday the 29th we are spending the night at a hostel in Hiawassee, Georgia. It was a real pleasure to be able to shower and get a great lunch with real food at a restaurant. It seemed like my sandwich was the best thing I ever ate. Tomorrow we will be in North Carolina.I have pictures to add, but since it's already 11:15 pm I need to get to our cabin (I'm typing this in the hostel's living quarters). Anyway, I pray every day for the Lord's guidance and that I might not depart from Him, because boy it's hard to do it on your own. I might also ask for prayers for my son's brother-in law who is probably only 27 years old and has been stricken with cancer. His first name is Daniel. Goodnight!","

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650127,"May 2, 2022Yesterday, Sunday May 1st was our longest mileage day, a bit over 17 miles. We would possibly have stopped at Carter's Gap at 13 miles except that reports were that the previous night of 27 bear bags hung, 23 were successfully taken by bears. When we passed Carter's Gap we were surprised at the number of hikers that were staying there in spite of the bear issue. Our camp was Betty Creek Gap which was at mile marker 97.2. There initially were 6 of us there being Brian, myself, my 4 legged girl Pat, a trio of campers hiking together who are very nice guys: Achilles - who is a very accomplished doctor as well as hiker, Hitman from Michigan though that's not what he does for a living, and Debris from Connecticut. They are all about our age (though I have only met one thru hiker older than myself), approximately 60. Bill had some bad luck that morning. He lost his cell phone, though it has since been found and will be returned to him in Franklin, North Carolina which is where I am typing this. He had further bad luck that evening. But first, another gentlemen, a retired Marine arrived when we were eating dinner, a vey nice guy. Achilles helped him throw his bear bag after dinner. So each of the hiking trio hung bear bags, the Marine hung a bear bag, and Brian hung a bear bag. Understand after you've been hiking all day up and down hills covered with rocks and roots after your tent is up and you've eaten, bed is a welcome site. So Pat and I keep our food in an odor-proof bag and were in bed by 7 pm. Sometime around 10 pm we were wakened by the sound of 3 guys chasing a 500 pound bear away from their campsite. He managed to get 2 of their 3 bear bags, and was actively working on number 3 (Brian heard him working on that one, but thunder caused him to leave). My belief is that even though the food in the bear bags are generally in odor proof bags the bears have long ago learned that bear bags = dinner. I also understand that bears prefer to stay away from dogs, thank you Pat since we keep all of our food in our tent.Unfortunately, although Pat handles the hiking really well, I'm concerned about how she will hold up in hot weather. She pretty much turns her nose up at dogfood, but she has enjoyed eating soft tortillas with Spanish rice, and tortillas with tuna. Tonight she happily consumed a delicious hamburger that I brought back from the diner where I ate (I had a great double cheeseburger with fries and 2 glasses of coke). On a typical hiking and camping day its hard to consume more than 1000 calories for me at this point.You will hopefully see some pictures taken recently, including the 100 mile picture taken today if I successfully uploaded them. Until again (pobably 3 or 4 days from now).",,View Entry,"May 02, Mon",0
Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650466,"Thursday May 5th was a sad
day for me. My 4 legged companion Pat was picked up at the NOC by one
of Brian's old army buddies, Tony Miller from Knoxville to begin her
trip back to Kansas. I will sure miss her but as I probably
previously mentioned I was concerned about her eating enough food, as
she continually turned her nose up at quality dog food. She did like
Spanish Rice and/or Starkist tuna wrapped up in a tortilla, and
seemed to prefer being fed by hand. She also liked Brian's cheese,
and he also was generous to her with his tuna. Over the long haul I
was concerned with how she would handle the heat when we got further
into the hike. My brother will pick her up on Friday, and Beth
(my much better half) will drive to Kentucky beginning Friday
afternoon to get her home.
Tony is a heckuva nice guy. He stocked
us up with all sorts of food for the trail. And though I was no
longer carrying some of Pat's food I thought my pack probably weighed
even more than before. We have plenty to eat. I really appreciate
Tony's kindness.
The NOC is a very nice resort on a
river. I bought a new ultralight tent for 1 person there, reducing my
tent weight by nearly 3 pounds. On the trail as you walk and walk
your feet tend to flatten out a bit and by the NOC my feet were
feeling pretty cramped in hiking shoes that I had worn for about 5
months counting our trail time. Brian and I each bought a shower for
$3.21. A towel cost an additional $3.21 and being frugal neither of
us bought towels. You find the more time that you spend on the trail
the more that your modesty disappears. Ther were several used towels
that had plenty of drying power yet (which I didn't expect) so I used
one of those! I bought a larger pair of shoes along with toe socks
(something I had never used before) and my feet sure thanked me.I did
however take one spill, so I need to start another cycle of days with
no falls. The rocks and the roots can sure bite if you're not
careful. We finished the day at Sassafras Gap, mile marker 143.8. If
my internet connection is fast enough to upload you should see more
photos.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650455,"We left Wine Spring Camp at 8 am this morning. It's mile 117.6 on the AT. Tuesday night was stormy, lots of thunder and lightning coupled with heavy rain. Pat wasn't happy, and in the morning my tent floor was wet as I didn't have my ground sheet completely unde4r my tent which allows water to seep in from the ground sheet.
We finished up today at 3:30 at Wesser Bald Shelter. Although we stay at campgrounds and shelters we always tent. There's no mice issues in our tents, and in the shelters multiple people could keep you awake with their snoring. 
Forthe record I am told that I also snore. Today was Pat's next to last day before she heads home to Kansas. I'll miss her happy tail as she runs down the trail, and the happy way she wakes you up in morning with her tail and face licking, but shw is difficult to keep fed as she refuses to eat dog food. She is very attentive to my progress. Brian leads the hike 90% of the time and on the steep uphills I take a slow and steady pace. I couldn't make 3 consecutive days without a spill; at the 10 mile mark I tripped on a rock and went down. Within 3 or 4 seconds Pat came to my side to lick my face and make sure that I was okay.","Wine Spring Camp

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650465,"Friday May 6th was an
eventful day. Thursday night it rained and thundered. Unfortunately
our tent sight wasn't close to level and as my air mattress slid
downhill I was left with a shortage of leg space, and the downhill
end of my tent had some water, and the end of my sleeping bag was
also wet. Our goal for the day was Cable Gap Shelter, 15.4 miles down
the trail. Though we had experienced a certain amount of rain during
the previous days today was much different. It began raining early
and pretty darned steady. We had a few short breaks in the rain
during the morning. But later in the afternoon it poured. We decided
to take a break at the Brown Fork Gap Shelter and to possibly go
ahead and spend the night there. But when we arrived the shelter was
pretty full of mostly younger people, not exactly in the demographic
identity of Brian and myself. After we got there we had a pretty good
downpour, along with 3 more hikers who came in. One was a gentlemen
who was a southbounder about our age. The discussion of the younger
set wasn't exactly of the sort of language that we normally employ,
and sleeping in the shelter itself would have been very
uncomfortable. When a break in the rain came, the Southbound
gentleman and Brian and I headed out.
We made 2.0 miles before the clouds let
loose. And I do mean let loose. The temperature was a balmy 50
degrees, the trail was a muddy mess with water 3-5 inches deep in
places and the wind blowing a small gale. It was 3 pm when we left
the shelter. At about 6 pm we made it to the blacktop road about 1
mile from our original destination. There was a hiker hostel about 2
miles down the road from us, but the cell coverage was nonexistent
and we never heard from them. Brian went searching for a level place
to pitch our tents and I stayed by the road hoping to hitch a ride. A
UPS van drove south of us, and about 10 minutes later he headed
north, stopped and said he was sorry but UPS rules prevented him from
giving us a ride. He did go to the hostel for us but on his return
back told us that the hostel was full up. He suggested that we might
walk 2 miles south to the stop sign and turn left and see if a hiker
motel there had space which didn't seem real appealing but I was
getting concerned about hypothermia. We both had been praying
earnestly for a ride to somewhere, anywhere dry and warm and the Lord
answered our prayers more abundantly than we could ever have
expected.
A gentlemen heading north saw us
standing around (I was really right on the edge of the road) and he
stopped, backed up, and asked if we needed a ride somewhere. To quote
him as near as I can, he said “You guys don't look very happy right
now. Can I help?” Did he ever help. He drove us to the motel where
the owner said I'm sorry but my family is coming from out of town and
they will use all of the rooms. Chip was our angel. He is an
electrical engineer who works in Atlanta (about 3 days a week) but
lives in this very remote area of the North Carolina AT. He said well
the first thing we better do is get you to my house and feed you guys
dinner. Believe it or not his Atlanta church has a serious ministry
in Guatemala and they buy something like 40,000 pounds of green
coffee beans that they roast and resell, much of it to churches. His
wife Jeanne does taxes during the tax season and today was her last
day of doing taxes. Chip walked in his house and said he was bringing
in 2 dinner guests, cold and wet. She was also a jewel and said you
guys are welcome to taker showers to warm up before dinner. WE DID!
Her dinner was superb, and they called a neighbor down the road who
happened to have an AirBnb, which by God's providence was available
for tonight, which is where I am typing this. Chip and Jeanne's son
is in the Navy stationed at the Paris consulate. Jeanne and the owner
of the tax firm where she works are flying there in 1 or 2 days to
spend time with him before he is redeployed to Japan. There are just
very, very fine people.
Tomorrow morning Chip will pick us up
and deliver us back to the trail where we will have a very short 6
mile hike to get to the Fontana Dam Hilton as we begin our trek
through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.","Sassafras Gap

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651174,"Today is the first zero day that we have taken. Though there’s not a lot to do in Hot Springs, North Carolina it was nice to get a hot breakfast at a nice little diner, get laundry done, and prepare for the next 5 days. Right now on the trail we have logged 274.9 miles. When you add the approach trail that puts us at 283.7 miles actually hiked, not including trips down to water sources. We have durable, flexible plastic bags by Sawyer to capture water to drink. After the bag is full you screw on the Sawyer water filter and squeeze the water through it into your clean container for drinking and cooking. Sometimes you might have to walk an extra .3 miles one way to get water. You drink a whole lot more water when you’re hiking up hills than when you’re sitting at a desk!   Over the next 5 days we want to cover 94 miles to reach our next resupply point at a hostel called Greasy Creek Friendly. Over that mileage our uphills will average 260 feet per mile while the average downhill per mile will be 230 feet. Until we hike it we don’t know if it will be rocky or relatively smoother; though there are always plenty of roots looking to grab you. Brian still has yet to take a complete fall. Me not so much. I made 6 days in a row, then took 1 spill on 2 consecutive days. Tomorrow I will be looking to continue a new tripping-free record at 2 consecutive days.The hostel where we’ve spent the last 2 nights was built in 1840. We’re told that it is the only building in town left standing that predates the Civil War. The owner, Elmer Hall thru hiked the AT 44 years ago and spent a night here on that trek. Two years later the building owners asked him if he would like to buy the house; he did, and he’s now operated it for the last 42 years. Today he is 85 years old.This house seems to be a hidden gem. He has several rooms but is pretty selective about who he lets stay here. At 85 he doesn’t use a cell phone, only a land line. And when you call and he answers he has a battery of questions that you have to pass to get in. He wants to know that you have had a covid vaccine. You must have an Appalachian Trail name, and you must be a thru hiker. Though he has about 8 rooms available he seems to limit his occupancy to about 4 or 5 hikers. The place is quite pleasant. Because of all of the trees you can’t really get a good picture of the exterior, but I’ve attached a picture of my bedroom. It has a very convenient working desk, 2 comfortable wingback chairs, a full sized bed and a twin bed. Brian’s room is similar. All for the price of $30 a night.","

When you leave Hot Springs, you cross the bridge over the French Broad River, hike parallel to it for 800 yards of so and then go up a steep uphill for what seems like a long time.

Brian and I had originally planned to go 22.5 miles this day as we have gotten in pretty good hiking shape. The terrain going over Big Butt Mountain was treacherous and difficult. After that knee issue I knew that I was going to have to have it get evaluated by someone in the medical profession. The views were stunning, the weather beautiful, the knee bad.","Little Laurel Shelter

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651466,"Thursday, May 19thWe had a pretty easy hike this day. From Flint Mountain Shelter to Sam’s Gap was only 11.2 miles. The intent was to end up at Nature’s Inn Hostel where I could get a shuttle driver to take me to Mission Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina to get my left knee evaluated. There wasn’t a single stretch of rocky terrain where you were constantly either taking high steps up or long steps down on rocks, so my knee didn’t rebel. Nature’s Inn is probably 4 or 5 miles off of the trail. At Sam’s Gap you’re  on a state highway, you call the hostel and they pick you up pretty promptly. It was (is) a very nice place. Brian and I had a 2 bed cabin right next to a loudly babbling stream with a screened in porch, plenty of electrical outlets, and their shower and laundry facilities were top notch.My shuttle driver picked me up Friday morning at 5:30 am and had me dropped off at Mission Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina at 6 am. They took my vitals, manipulated my knee, and took 3 or 4 x-rays of it. The nurse taking my vitals said something like “I can tell you have always been an athlete because your heart rate and blood pressure is so low.”  Fortunately their readings didn’t mean that I was close to death. Their analysis of my knee was what I hoped to hear. No damage was shown on the x-rays and their diagnosis was 2 days of rest, ice packs, usage of a knee brace, and Vitamin I (ibuprofen). They suggested that I would have knee discomfort throughout the hike but that there was no reason to stop.I’m looking forward to resuming the hike with Brian Sunday morning. Going home this early would have seemed like failure to me. Not only that but I believe that Beth and Terry (Brian’s wife) encouraged him to go under the theory that I, being a complete novice hiker probably needed him to educate me at the beginning. If that was their theory, they were absolutely correct. Brian also is using the hike to raise funds for his and Terry’s missionary work in Guatemala. Anyone who wishes to contribute a penny a mile ($22 for the whole hike) could message me and I will gladly get his detail posted on a future update.I seem to have had some good pictures get deleted on my cell phone, but there are 2 new photos attached today. One is actually a plaque just south of Hot Springs, North Carolina and the other a picture taken this past Wednesday.

My shuttle driver, Nate picked me up at the Asheville, NC Econolodge and dropped me off at Sam’s Gap where Brian and I began our hike.As what seems to be per usual, we immediately began an uphill trek. At 8:40 am. About noon we reached the summit of Little Bald with a beautiful view of the surrounding country in every direction. We ate lunch there and visited with a married couple, Pyro and Chef who we had been seeing off and on. That day was their one year anniversary. They were celebrating by slack-packing. They are a very nice couple from Michigan and attached you can see a picture of them. They also took a picture of Brian and I at the same spot, also hopefully attached! Our intent for that day was to go 15.6 miles. Unfortunately the weather had other plans for us and the forecasted ran began at 4:30 pm so we quit at Spivey Gap then just before the rain came. As it turned out, it rained all night.

As a matter of fact at 10:03 pm when I’m writing this it’s still raining, and the forecast for tomorrow calls for..., you guessed it, more rain! We won’t complain. I’ve concluded on this hike that the best attitude is one of acceptance and even temperment. If God didn’t give us rain we wouldn’t be here so rain is really a blessing. This was the first day in my 67 plus years on earth where I got to hike in rain all day. I did get a bit irritated though when I took a spill on a muddy spot.Due to the weather our intent today was to hike to Johnny’s Hostel in Erwin, Tennessee and get a cabin for the night. That plan was foiled after we arrived when the owner told me that the cabins were all booked for the next 3 nights but that we could set up our tents if we chose to stay there. We didn’t choose to stay there. A very nice shuttle driver by the name of Doug picked us up at the Freewill Baptist Church 400 yards up the road towards Erwin (I gathered that he wasn’t fond of the proprietor). He drove us to the Super 8 in Erwin, and will pick us up at 7:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.There wasn’t hardly a soul on the trail outside of Brian and myself. At the road on Spivey Gap there was a van parked. On our hike north we met a young lady who was finishing her southbound thru hike that she started last year as well as the section hiker going south to his van. About 5 miles up the trail we saw a bear bag hanging, and about 1 mile before Erwin the young man who had camped there passed us while we were taking pictures of the Nolichucky River way below us.

When we hit the Roan Balds, which seemed to go on and uphill forever the wind was blowing a steady 40 mph. Because it was a bald that meant there were no trees. The wind was strong enough that you had to fight to not get blown off the trail. The rain changed to a mixture of rain and sleet. The temperature up high was about 45 degrees. The wind and precipitation were so strong that I could not see through my glasses. Since you wouldn't want me driving without my glasses on it was disappointing to walk without them on. Up there I actually took 2 spills, as the trail was basically just a muddy creek.Just before we got into the final long bald I saw that I finally had a cell signal and tried to get in to a hostel just off the highway. They were booked, but reluctantly gave me the phone number for Black Bear Resort about 25 miles up the road. When we were making that call 2 other hikers caught up to us, and they eagerly wanted rooms there as well. It did happen, and when we got to the highway and the shuttle van had just arrived we were sure pleased. My Kelty internal frame backpack proved to not be sewn together very well. My right load lifter strap had broken, and the left load lifter was about to break as well. Load lifters are important because they take the weight off of your shoulders and put it on your hips. The purchase was made on Amazon through a seller called Enwild in Pennsylvania. I called Enwild first, and they were sympathetic but said that they had to operate strictly according to Amazon's rules, which had a 30 day return privilege. The nice lady there told me to call Amazon and tell them that I had an A to Z claim (I had the backpack for about 60 days). Amazon agreed to take the pack back, Beth shipped me my external frame Kelty backpack to Damascus, Virginia where I am typing this. Black Bear shuttled me here, and Saturday morning they will come pick me up and drop me off where we quit on Thursday. They took Brian to that trailhead Friday morning; he will get to Black Bear (it's north on the trail, the direction that we're hiking) and he will arrive there Saturday, then take a zero on Sunday.

That 3 miles had a beautiful waterfall and lots of scenery. Prior to that in the morning we got some really nice sunny views of the mountains. Pictures are attached.","Stealth campsite 412

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652537,"May 30thOn May 30th we went from the Boots Off Hostel to the Rabbit Hole Hostel in Shady Valley. Our intent was not to stay in hostels 2 days in a row, but Far Out, my online map of the AT mentioned in the comment section that the owner whose AT trail name was Rabbit took them to the town of Shady Valley to Burger King and Dollar General. It turned out when I called Rabbit that there was no Burger King in Shady Valley (probably population 400) but that there was a diner and a Dollar General. I made that phone call at 4:30 at the point where there was still about 5.5 miles to get to the pickup point.We hustled and got there by 6:20 pm, and the diner was open. We had the best double cheeseburgers cooked outside on a grill where you put your own sides on the burger yourself. It was a great meal. The hostel itself was satisfactory. Rabbit had an issue with the county where you couldn't take a shower until he had a septic tank installed for his showers. He had an outside sink complete with hot and cold water, and since we were the only 2 hikers there it was no different than taking a bath as there was no one who was going to watch you take an outdoor bath. His business was down significantly due to the shower issue. We paid him more than his fee because he worked hard to keep us satisfied and we like to see people be successful. He had thru hiked the trail 6 or 7 years earlier gooing from Maine to Georgia. In his former life he was a pastry chef in New York City. It's a long way from NYC to Shady Valley, Tennessee and just as far as a cultural difference.For the day we covered 20.6 miles.","Boots Off Hostel

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652538,"May 31stRabbit got us to the trailhead at 8:45 a.m. After 2 miles of hiking we stopped for a quick water break where I realized that my tent poles were no longer attached to the bottom of my backpack.It's pretty hard to set up a tent without poles, so I took of jogging back to the trailhead in search of my poles. Shortly after starting my jog I met Alex, who we had met on multiple occasions and told him why I was jogging back to our trailhead. He told me that he found a Smart Water bottle, showed it to me, and indeed it was mine. It was clipped to my backpack and had fallen off the day before. I continued my jog to the trailhead, and alas there were no poles that I could find.That prompted me to call Beth to let her know that she might need to be sending me my other tent in a highly expedited fashion. It would be a bit of an understatement to say that she was justifiably quite unhappy with me! Anyway, I jogged back to Brian, and lo and behold Alex had rescued me. He found my poles not nore than a quarter mile from where we had stopped for our water break. Brian had told me on more than one occasion that I shouldn't strap my poles to the bottom of my backpack, that I should instead use a long vertical pocket intended for poles. Because I didn't have the stuff sack for the poles and my previous backpack was falling apart due to poor stitching I was concerned that the poles might ultimately poke a hole in the bottom of the pocket. Sometimes it pays to listen to one who has more experience. Now I use the pocket for my poles.The hiking goal for the day was to get to the Virginia border. Because of the time lost looking for poles we ended up about 4 miles from Virginia and 6 miles from Damascus. Brian had been having a great deal of back pain from sciatica at night and had a pretty sore back and numbness in one leg every morning. His intention was to take 2 days off in Damascus to see if his back would improve. I had to continue on because I needed to make Troutdale, Virginia by Friday night (population about 70) to get a pickup at their post office. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to get the pickup until Monday.","The Rabbit Hole Hostel

Brian couldn't check in to the Methodist church hiker hostel until 3 p.m. I left about noon to resume my path towards Troutdale.

I thought that if I made mile 503 on the trail I would make Troutdale Friday afternoon, and if it was Friday evening the post office was open on Saturday morning until 10 a.m.When I got to Elk Garden at Virginia highway 600 I would be getting close to the Grayson Highlands. That part of the trail is famous for the herd of wild ponies that live up there. Just inside the pasture, no more than a half mile off of the road I took my backpack off to take pictures of a few ponies that were not actually in the highlands. When I tried to put the backpack on, it didn't go as a pin that held the left shoulder strap bolt on was gone and I had no spare parts to replace it with. I was blessed with 2 ladies who had been hiking that day and were on their way back to the parking lot. They offered to take me back to Damascus where a couple of hiking supply stores were open. I gladly accepted, and before we arrived in Damascus a very healthy rain storm developed. The store had what I needed, and since Brian was there and is a lot handier than I he get the part replaced. A hiker shuttle service then came and drove me to Troutdale where I spent the night in a Baptist hiker hostel. It was nice to get another shower and clean some clothes.As it turned out, even if the weather had been favorable and I had no backpack issue I seriously doubt that I would have made Troutdale until Saturday well after the post office closing time. If you haven't hiked a section you can be surprised by the trail. The portion of the trail going through the Grayson Highlands, while beautiful, was excessively rocky. Troutdale itself is a good 3 or 4 miles off of the trail, and there was virtually no cell phone service.The disappointing part of the day was that Brian was told by a neurologist at the Wichita, Kansas VA hospital that despite the sciatica he shouldn't be suffering from numbness in his leg. They want to see him in Wichita on Friday, June 10th. Words can't express how grateful I am for Brian's experience and teaching me what I really needed to know to successfully complete this adventure.

It seems like no rural  place in southern Virginia has internet access. I needed a shuttle ride after picking up my package from Beth at the post office. My room actually had a walkie talkie. A sign on the wall said to use Channel 12 to call Cole, a shuttle driver who fortunately was one of the very few residents of Troutland. The walkie talkie didn't work real well for me, although I was able to visit with him for a moment or two but couldn't get a pickup time arranged. Next to the post office was a bank, and a lady there tried about 4 times unsuccessfully to contact Cole, but after he saw the missed calls he called the bank and was told he had a customer that was ready for a shuttle ride. Cole was nice to deal with and got me back to the Elk Garden trailhead to resume my hike I ended up at Old Orchard Shelter at mile marker 510.2. It was a bit of a late start since the post office didn't have my package until 9:30 and it took time to get my shuttle, and more time to drive to the trailhead. It worked out to be a 15.3 mile rock filled hike. For just the 3rd time since April 22nd I stayed in the shelter so that I wouldn't have to break down my tent in the morning.There were lots of tents set up there, and 4 of us sleeping in the shelter.

That seems to be the consensus of all the hikers that I met today, and in one shelter logbook that I viewed before getting to my final destination for the night. Each shelter has a logbook where hikers can note their presence and any thoughts they have about the day's hike. I will post some pictures of the ponies, some of the really pretty views, and the 500 mile marker that I passed.Today was my longest hike of the trek to date. I actually hiked 25 miles today, although I will report it as 24 miles. When I am hiking I don't spend all of my time looking for white blazes that markthe trail. I could be singing hymns in my head, praying, having imaginary conversations or thinking about all of the tasks that I ordinarily do that Beth must do in my absence. And on a bright sunny day, parts of the trail will have sunlight, and adjoining trail will be in shade. If I don't watch where I'm putting my feet the result can be a spill. On the 4th I was going for my sixth consecutive day of not taking a spill. But because I was intent on making tracks I went too fast on one downhill piece of trail and ended up taking a fall. But the reason for the mile that doesn't count was due to inattention. I was on well defined trail so I wasn't looking for blazes. When I hit a gravel road and there was no double or single blaze indicating what way I should turn it was time to turn my AT cell phone app on. It uses GPS and doesn't require a cell phone signal. Anyway, much to my dismay I discovered that the gravel road that I entered was not part of the AT; rather it was running parallel to the AT never to actually intersect it.I was 4/10ths of a mile north of the AT. I saw that if I hiked east a half mile I would nevver the gap to a little over a quarter mile. The unfortunate thing (besides the wasted mile) was that I was on the low side of the tree and brush covered mountain. It was a really slow hike uphill because of the steep grade. It turns out that I wasn't the only one who missed the turn. A guy at the Partnership Shelter (the ending point of my day's hike) did the same thingThe Partnership Shelter is part of a federal tourist facility. They have a phone on the outside of the building that hikers can use to order pizza and shuttle service. Again, not surprisingly, cell phones were worthless there. I was in a hurry to get there because the thought of having a pizza delivered was great motivation to make tracks. Unfortunately since I didn't arrive until 6:30 pm a pizza was going to cost $35 delivered because that was the firm's minimum order size to deliver out there. I passed on the $35 pizza, but 4 hikers generously shared a piece of their pizzas so I didn't have to cook Knorr's Spanish Rice on my isobutane stove.I needed to resupply, and a shuttle provider said that they would pick me up in 15 minutes. I finished my pizza just in time. The gentleman who picked me up was very gracious. He refused to take any money for picking me up. You meet a lot of nice people on the trail!","

My plan for this day was 18.3 miles, 20.8 miles for the 13th, and 21.8 miles for the 14th.I made my 18.3 miles, though it took longer than I had intended, mostly because a very nice young lady with the trail name of Harmony from Crested Butte, Colorado provided trail magic at the 14 mile mark. She got off the trail at Pearisburg and was providing food and beverages to thru hikers. I gratefully ate 2 McDonalds sandwiches, 2 bags of chips, and drank 2 Mountain Dews during my nearly 60 minute stay with her. When I first got to the road there there was another vehicle parked there that was just preparing to leave.

Her son had passed through earlier in an effort to break his record of 41 days and 6 hours.Having hiked after this day a total of 669.4 miles I surely don't see a lot of benefit in that. He would be averaging more than 53.16 miles per day to break his record; and it would seem to me to be a good way to break bones rather than records. I probably had previously mentioned that a Philadelphia physician with a trail name of Achilles had told me that he had seen thru hikers intent on setting AT speed records with broken bones rather than new speed records. Considering that a marathon is 26.5 miles (approximately) and you aren't climbing up and stepping down on high steps, boulders, and navigating other obstacles on a marathon to cover the equivalent of 82.7 marathons in 41 days seems unhealthy. My 67 year old legs surely couldn't even come close to that! My perception is that when you are doing that you might carry water and a snack, but you are being supported by someone else with most all of your supplies, bedding, and etc. I spent the night in a shelter for a change - I was the only one there other than a large black snake laying underneath the shelter.

This was perhaps the most difficult hike of all of my days on the trail. Brian and I sure had some tough days getting started and in the hills of North Carolina, but it started out with uphill climbs and hot, humid temperatures from the start. Navigating the boulders, climbing both up and down using your hands to help secure your safe passage for progress was sure wearing on my psyche. The rocks seemed to go on forever. But it could have been worse. By the time I hit them at Dragon's Tooth they were dry instead of wet and slippery. Thank you Lord that I didn't take any spills on this day! I failed to take any pictures of the Dragon's Tooth and related boulders because I was only concerned about keeping myself in one unbroken 67 year old piece!When I reached the point where I was going to descend from Dragon's Tooth (I actually keep thinking of it as Devil's Tooth) there was a young lady from Pennsylvania ahead of me. Before I got to the gravel road I did pass her. Her father was providing car transportation for her (he was smart enough to not hike this portion of the trail with her) and she offered that they could provide transportation to me for the last half mile that was not part of the AT to 4 Pines Hostel where I was spending the night. That was also a blessing, even though a half mile might not seem like much.At the hostel I called a convenience store about getting pizza delivered to me for dinner. The young lady who answered my call said that they were done cooking for the night, that they had 3 big pieces of pizza left but that they did not deliver. The hostel manager drove myself and another hiker to the store. The young lady gave me the pizza at no charge, and I bought 2 20 ounce bottles of Pepsi to go along with it. I shared my pizza with one of the hikers, shared some of my crust with a hostel dog, and drank both of the Pepsis myself.The mileage for the day was just 14.3, but it seemed like the longest hike of my AT hike to date.

There was no one else at the top, and a selfie doesn't really give you the flavor of what it's like, but nonetheless I have attached 2 pictures at that site. I didn't try to get to close to the edge - in May an individual fell to their death there, which I personally didn't care to replicate! At the time of the picture (probably about 1 pm) it was a bright, sunny day. A few hours later the weather changed drastically. I was hiking on top of a ridgeline for about 4 miles when clouds poured in, the temperature dropped, and the wind really blew hard. The trail was very close to the edge of the mountains so I was glad that the wind was blowing you away from the precipice rather than towards off of the mountains. I heard 2 trees get blown over. I passed an older gentleman from Syracuse, New York when the wind was blowing ferociously and I made the Lamberts Meadow Shelter by 5 pm. About 1 mile before that I came upon 2 ladies who were section hiking south standing on the trail. They wondered what the weather was like on top of the ridgeline. My advice to them was to forget about it until the storm blew over and head to the shelter that became my night's destination. Happily they took my advice. When I made the shelter a forest service ranger and an Appalachian Trail employee were there also waiting out the storm. An hour and a half after I arrived the man from Syracuse got there. He said that one tree blew over on his hike and narrowly missed him. Surprisingly with all of the cloud cover no rain came, and after 2 hours at the shelter the storm had passed. The next day would be shorter. For this day, my mileage was 16.4.","4 Pines Hostel

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653760,"June 18thSaturday the 18th I was back in Daleville, Virginia at the Beech Hill hostel. It was only a 9.4 mile hike to there, and the first order of business was to get, I hoped, a Wendy's double cheeseburger and milk shake. Unfortunately it didn't happen. That Wendy's couldn't hire enough people to be fully staffed and dining in was not offered. I settled for BoJangles next door, but it wasn't my first choice. Now about 2 days earlier Beth had asked me if it was time to send me my new boots to replace the ones that I had worn for the last 550 miles. I told her no, that I thought I still had another 150 miles left on what I was wearing. However on Friday the 17th my right trail boot decided to fall apart. I used Leukotape to put it together, so the second order of business on this day was to buy another pair of trail boots. In the same shopping center there was an outdoor outfitter so new boots were bought, and after that, still in the same center was Krogers. Sure I had a sandwich, fries, and 2 Pepsis at BoJangles but hikers eat a lot of food and still lose weight. So I bought and ate lunch at Krogers, as well as purchased a spinach dish and a carton of ice cream for that evening's dinner. Until that day I had never consumed an entire carton of ice cream in one sitting.","Lamberts Meadow Shelter

My plan for this day was get to a campsite at mile marker 752.6. All seemed to be going well, although at approximately mile marker 740 my left foot was on the downhill side of the trail, and was maybe too close to the edge of the trail as the ground gave way and I took a fall. By the time I got to mile marker 751 my right ankle had gotten very, very uncomfortable in my new trail boots. I made the campsite and was sure happy to get the boots off (in particular the right one) and my camp shoes on.There ended up being 3 other hikers camping there that night, one of whom was from New York City.

Taxman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653762,"June 20thI expected to cover about 20 miles this day. I was mistaken. From the very first step in my new trail boots my right ankle rebelled. It was no fault of the boot, rather it was the high ankle swelling that couldn't stand contact with the upper portion of the boot. After 3 miles I took the right boot off and put on my cheap, right rubber camp shoe. I made arrangements for a shuttle service to pick me up at the first road crossing which happened to be at mile marker 758.5 for an unimpressive 5.9 mile day. Cindy (the shuttle driver) dropped me off at the Glasgow Dollar General where I intended to buy a cheap pair of tennis shoes to hike in until the swelling on my right ankle subsided.Dollar General is probably the most popular hiker resupply store on the entire AT so I was sure that I would find what I needed there. Wrong. The store manager said that they had no shoes for sale, only a highly limited selection of flip flops. Since there was no other retail store in Glasgow I was deeply saddened, wondering how I could ever in a short time get footwear that would allow me to continue my hike. There is a saying on the AT that the trail provides. I prefer to think that the Lord provides. I picked up some tuna fish and candy, and got in line to pay behind a young man who was also thru hiking. I noticed that he had a brand new pair of trail runner shoes on the floor next to him and that he had on a pair of old trail runners. I asked him what he was going to do with his old shoes. His response was ""I'm going to throw them away."" My rejoinder was, ""Hey, I'll take them from you!"" They fit, and the right shoe didn't hurt my foot in the least. The question would be will they make it to Waynesboro, Virginia where there is a trail outfitter at mile marker 864 on the trail.So I needed to spend a few days in Glasgow not hiking to allow my ankle to recover. The city of Glasgow is hiker friendly. They have a free shelter with bunk beds, a shower, and porta potties for hikers to use. My first night in Glasgow I stayed there. On Monday night the local Episcopal church, with all of 14 members provides a free dinner for hikers. It was a great dinner. All you could eat of salad, lasagna, macaroni and cheese, rolls, cookies, ice cream, and probably something else that I'm forgetting.  For the next two nights I stayed at Stanamil's Hostel in Glasgow. The manager there, Charlie, fixes blueberry pancakes every morning for breakfast, and prepares a great desert at the end of the day.","Stealth Campsite

That saved me starting a 500 foot uphill in the first 2 miles on the 26th. My used shoes, though well worn were still getting me down the trail. For the day I covered 20.9 miles.At Route 60 there was a really nice flat, mowed grassy area to pitch my tent. The night was warm so I didn't use the rainfly on my tent.

To start the morning though I did have a long uphill. As I've said before, anytime you start from a road you are guaranteed an immediate uphill. On this morning I was hiking by 6:30 a.m. So in the first 1.8 miles the uphill climb was 2000 feet. At the end of the day, in the last mile the uphill climb was 550 feet.I passed a middle-aged couple in the first mile and a half, and never saw another northbound hiker for the duration of my hiking time. I did see a 60 something lady who was thru hiking in what seemed like a random manner. She had already hiked through Shenandoah National Park and was making up several miles that she had skipped south of Shenandoah. The good news that she gave me is that Shenandoah had well manicured trails without 5 million rocks. I also saw 3 southbound section hikers, but the trail has become kind of a solitary place.From the time that the rain began at 2:30 it didn't stop until after I reached my destination for the night: Priest Shelter. That last uphill was difficult because it was straight up, no switchbacks, and lots of small rocks that made footing difficult because of slippage (of the rocks). When I reached the shelter at 5 p.m. no one else was there, which I appreciated because it gave me the opportunity to take all of my wet clothes off, use my body wipes to give myself a bath of sorts, and to then get dry clothes on. You feel a lot better getting in a sleeping bag when you aren't sweaty and dirty. Anyway after that I ate my gourmet dinner of Knorr's Spanish Rice topped of with 2 small Payday candy bars, inflated my mattress and unrolled my sleeping bag. About then the married couple that I had passed early in the morning arrived and by then the rain had quit so they set up their tent and cooked.Around 9 p.m. 2 younger thru hikers in their twenties arrived, and woke me up from my sleep. One of them had done 32 miles that day, a really high number. After they settled in their sleeping bags in the shelter and went to sleep one of them abruptly woke up and shouted ""I just got bit and it hurts!"" I told him that there were mice in the shelter, and my guess was that he may have had some food trace on his face. When I woke up in the morning he was no longer in the shelter. He set up his tent I guessed to avoid other mouse confrontations! Beth and I had watched a You Tube Appalachian Trail video where a lady had a mouse chew on her lips that she had applied chapstick.

Throughout the hike a consistent prayer of mine was to maintain an even temperament regardless of circumstances. For the previous 350 miles I would probably average one fall for every 4 or 5 hiking days. On this day I didn't fall once, twice, three times, but rather four times and I must confess that by the end of the day I was spent and uttering various profanities at all of the rocks. I don't believe that even in the Smokies I had to navigate through as many rock piles as I did on this day. I started at mile marker 829.7 and finished at mile marker 850.I began the hike at 6:30 a.m. Typically I would cover that distance in just a bit under 10 hours including breaks. On this day I reached my destination at 5:50 p.m. or 11 hours and 20 minutes. Once again there was lots of uphill, but rocks were pervasive throughout the whole day. I probably had no more than 1.5 miles of smooth, rock-free hiking. There were some pretty views, a few pictures of which are attached but I was grateful for the end of this day's hike. My gifted used trail runners (shoes) had multiple fabric tears, and the the left shoe sole had been pierced by one of the thousands of rocks that it had stepped on. I took a shuttle ride to Waynesboro, Virginia to an AirBnb owned by the same individual who owns the hostel in Glasgow, as well as one just across the street from me here in Waynesboro. I actually have 14 miles to make up as Waynesboro is at mile marker 864; but as I told the shuttle driver I pretty intensely disliked this day's hike, and I might wait until next year to make this 14 mile section up.

I began the day at mile marker 987.3 and finished at mile marker1005.5! An accountant With the trail name of Ninja Turtle who I met at Mountain Home got to the 1000 mile mark a bit before me and we each took pictures of the other to commemorate the accomplishments. He told me that he was carrying one can of beer in his backpack to celebrate that night at an Appalachian Trail Conservancy hostel that he would share with me. It would undoubtedly have been wrong for me to refuse his generosity so I acquiesed! The hostel was Bears Den. It seems like a lot of places on the AT have 'bear' in their names.
This hostel provides beds, showers, laundry, pizza, and ice cream for $35. A satisfying end to what was another hot and humid day. This portion of the hike had most of what is known as the Roller Coaster aka PUDS or pointless ups and downs. They aren't switch backed but are rocky and long; pretty tiring on 67 year old legs. Scott from Mountain Home told me that a good way to get youngsters to never want to backpack was to make the Roller Coaster their first backpacking experience. I believe him!
An additional note, the young man who arrived at Whiskey Hollow on the 6th arrived at Bear's Den an hour or two after me. He said that he was tired because he hiked 21.5 miles frm Whiskey Hollow.

There is a church operated hostel called twelve tribes where I spent the night. They operate their hostel on a donation basis and provided a very nice fresh salmon dinner but their interpretation of the Bible doesn't align with mine. They say that they operate as a book of Acts community. They all live in common housing together and operate a farm, natural foods store, and tree service. They have multiple locations in the US and elsewhere, but God ordained the family and I wouldn't be comfortable with a family in a communal setting. In their sharing time before dinner they spoke of God the Father extensively but never mentioned Jesus.
