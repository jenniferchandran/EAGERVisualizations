The seed of hiking the Appalachian Trail was planted ten years ago, without any conscious effort on my part. It happened during a family vacation in Tennessee in February of 2011, when we visited  the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and hiked the mile or so up to Clingman‘s Dome. An avid camper, I was NOT a hiker, and the seed lay dormant. I didn’t actually know it planted itself! But…in the intervening years since, retirement, a vintage travel trailer, and a good friend happened. Along with those, came walking, and then hiking. I loved it. But the problem with wanting to do something, and being actually able to do it reared up it’s ugly head.  
I’m old…well, not in my head, but the calendar and my body say I’m 68. I ache at times. My shoulder, especially, and sometimes my hips. The shoulder is a rotator cuff issue, but physical therapy is upcoming. Ibuprofen is my friend.

I’m overweight. Until a month ago I was considered “obese” according to the weight and height charts. So yeah, there’s that. Short and fat. I’ve slowly shed almost 30 pounds over two years. But I’m still far (30 pounds) from my goal weight. Short and fat=slow. 

So, for now, I’m penciling in the thru-hike for 2022. The start date TBD. I’m researching, reading, planning, and slowly assembling my wish list of gear and clothing at the lowest possible cost. My biggest fear to overcome is not hiking alone, wildlife ( well, maybe snakes!), or the weather…it’s the fear that I will not be physically able to climb. 
I’ll never know if I don’t try is where my head is now.",,View Entry,"Nov 11, Thu",0
Searcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645842,"I am a planner…generally an obsessed, compulsive planner. I lie to myself and say I do it because I love planning. In reality, I make myself crazy. Although I’m a camper, I had few things suited to hiking, especially the AT. I’m reading everything. Journals, blogs, Backpacker Magazine, forums, reviews. Ultralight, base layers, pack weight, cooking systems, what to bring, what not to bring, pack shakedowns, bear canisters… I’m a newbie. I’ll buy too much, and bring too much. I will not, I told myself, pay full retail for anything! Which led me to buying first the item I was supposed to purchase last: a backpack. I had decided on an Osprey. And there it was. On EBay. A used Osprey Aura AG Silver Streak 50. It looked like it was in great condition. I made an offer. It’s in my closet. How did that happen? Am I truly going to do this?I was going to post a picture, but I haven’t figured that out yet.It’s not the lightest pack out there, but the fit, size and price were right. I love it!My second purchase, one of the big three, was a tent. It’s also in my closet, in the backpack. A Big Agnes Blacktail 2. It was on sale, but my guess is that it will be further reduced sooner than later, but it’s also out of stock at most places, so there’s that. I think it’s too heavy. I may return it, but I’ve yet to find anything else that isn’t way more money and as sturdy. I’m  hard on things I own. I say I won’t be, this time, but I know that isn’t true. Next up, a sleeping bag. I’ve changed my mind a half dozen times. With a too heavy backpack, and a too heavy tent, I need to be very careful here on out. Weight matters.",,View Entry,"Nov 21, Sun",0
Searcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645901,"I thought my next purchase would be a sleeping bag, but other items on my wish list popped up on sale, so…Sleeping pad - I knew all the rest of my items needed to be light, because of the tent, and because I’ll carry too much. The Therma-Rest NeoAir XLite was on my list as a possibility, but after watching review videos, the potato chip bag crinkle sound was just too much. Also, I’m a side sleeper, so I went with the Sea to Summit Ether Light XT Insulated women’s pad, at a 20% discount. I’m seriously amazed at how small it packs down and how light it is. It also comes with a PumpSack. MSR PocketRocket Deluxe Stove Kit. I’d decided on this, and was watching for a sale, which happened. Everything nests together and it’s really light. I’m happy. I hope I’m still happy after I’ve used it.I’ve gone back and forth on sleeping bags. Feathered Friends seems to be the one…but they are soooo expensive. I don’t think they have sales. 😢 The last bigger dollar purchase, besides some hiking specific  clothing, will be trekking poles. Many choices. I did return the Big Agnes Blacktail 2 tent that I purchased as it didn’t come with the Footprint and bought the same tent that had the Footprint included for a little more money, but less than a separately purchased one. It’s heavy. Shoulder physical therapy starts next week. I hope it goes well.",,View Entry,"Nov 26, Fri",0
Searcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647166,"Well, here it is, unbelievably March. I continued to read and research, but slowed down with Christmas and physical therapy. My shoulder is “better”, but not 💯. I’m not certain how that will impact my hike. It certainly leads me to question whether I can hang a bear bag…well, let me be honest…that was always a ? without a shoulder issue. But, now, do I carry a hard sided bear box? That will take up much space in my 50L backpack. After a great deal of back and forth, I finally purchased the Feathered Friends sleeping bag. So here’s where my gear stands:Osprey Aura 50L backpack - purchased usedBig Agnes Blacktail 2 Tent w/ footprint (on sale)Sea to Summit Ether Light Sleeping Pad w/ stuff sack and integrated pump (on sale)Feathered Friends Egret YF 20 short sleeping bagMSR Pocket Rocket Deluxe cook stove (on sale)I’m still deciding on water filtration. Most everything else, clothes, misc. items I have from years of camping. I had a tent and sleeping bags as well, but not meant for carrying! I’ll buy some stuff sacks. I purchased the new 2022 AT Guide. At some point, I WILL be on the AT!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Thu",0
