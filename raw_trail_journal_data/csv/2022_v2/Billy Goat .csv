Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646011,"With less than 90 day's until I start, I've been getting everything checked and ready. Gear tested, treated clothes with permethrin, washed my noisy piece of Tyvek ground sheet...etc. I will be doing some mail drops for certain foods and meal supplements that can't be found on trail so I need to get those boxes ready.Now to get out and do some hiking and exercising! Been busy trying to finish building custom cabinets for my brother's house which has taken up a lot of my time. Hopefully they will be pretty much finished before I leave for Georgia. Really looking forward to getting back on trail and meeting my fellow 2022 class of thru hikers. Good luck to all of you on your journey!",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Thu",0
Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647204,"Finally the time has come to get hiking! The past couple weeks of waiting were killing me. I wasn't able to get out and do much training but I did do some laps around my property. Has some good ups and downs so I was able to at least get my pack settled in and give my legs a decent workout. Arrived in Georgia, met up with my hiking partner, Tabasco, and went and officially checked in at Amicalola Falls. I'm hiker # 882 which I figured would be higher considering the number of people listed to hike this year. Did the approach trail to the top of the falls and felt pretty good afterwards so I think I'll be ok. The plan is to take my time and not rush the first couple of weeks. Once I feel confident that my body is acclimated I'll slowly start increasing mileage. Soooo looking forward to this hike!!",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Sat",0
Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647354,"Never thought this day would get here!After waking up at Your Home in the Woods B&B, Tabasco asked me if I'd be willing to skip the rest of the approach trail. Since I already hiked it in 2020 I was all for it! Ate an awesome breakfast, loaded our packs into Paul's truck and off we went.The drive up to the Springer parking lot was nice since it was a clear morning and warm. At the parking lot, we put our backpacks on, Paul took our picture and off we went to the southern AT terminus. You have to hike 1 mile south on the AT to get there so in reality you add 1 more mile to the total trail miles. It felt great to be back on the AT hiking. The temperature was pretty warm and the going was good. Almost at the summit, we came across Devil Dog and his wife Mama Seal. They were obviously carrying heavy packs since they struggled up the trail. Wished them good luck and continued to the summit. Once at the summit, did the usual picture taking and signed the log book then headed north for the official start of my thru hike! Came upon Devil Dog & Mama Seal and stopped to talk. Not 15 seconds into the conversation, Mama Seal stumbled and fell of the side of the trail!! For a split second we were frozen then threw of our packs to help her.Luckily she was stopped by a small tree about 7 feet down from the trail. I don't want to think what would have happened if that tree wasn't there! After a bit of a struggle, Devil Dog had her pack off and Tabasco handed it to me. I'm guessing that it weighed around 50+ lbs. We finally got her back up on the trail and made sure she was okay. Thankfully she was just a bit shaken up and had no major injuries. Tabasco in a polite way that they both needed a complete pack shakedown to get rid of a bunch of weight. After making sure they were going to be okay, we continued up the trail. The rest of the day went smoothly, if not warm since the temperature got up to 76! Arrived at Hawk Mt shelter, set up tents, ate dinner then sat around for a bit before turning in. Since this section of the AT is also the training area for the Army rangers school, you never know when gunshots will suddenly ring out in the surrounding mountains. Sure enough, around 9:30pm & 12:15am they did some of their training ambushes. Pretty wild to be sleeping and being woken up by yelling and machine gun fire. Welcome to the AT!","Springer Mt

Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647564,"After all the shooting from the Army Rangers training, I slept on and off till 7:15. It usually takes about 2 weeks for me to get used to sleeping in my tent...probably because every little sounds make you jump awake. After crawling out of my comfy sleeping bag I did the usual morning chores; brush teeth, privy call, make coffee and eat something. After that it's time to break down camp and stuff everything back into my backpack. Surprisingly it only takes me about 15 - 20 minutes to get everything packed away and do a last check for anything left out, then it's time to hit the trail. The morning was a bit cooler which is great for hiking. I usually don't start to sweat until it's 60+ degrees so I'll take the cool morning's. For the most part the day was uneventful except for a few decent views and then hiking in the clouds. Love the clouds and misty forest, and how the trees come and go from view.Made it to Gooch Gap where Bonnie picked Tabasco and I up to stay at their house again. After taking a shower and while sitting on the back porch, the sky opened up with rain and thunder. Didn't even realize there was a chance of storms! 3 other hikers were also staying for the night...2.0, Getty and Larissa, a great bunch of hikers to hang out with. After another excellent dinner, everyone sat around bs'ng and having a good time. Then off to bed. Another good day on trail.","Hawk Mt shelter

Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647588,"After another awesome breakfast at Your Home in the Woods B&B, Bonnie dropped Tabasco and myself off at Gooch Gap. A bit cooler and overcast...perfect hiking weather!Pretty much a standard day of hiking with fairly decent trail and a quick climb out of Woody Gap. Got to Preaching Rock and had the best views so far of the hike. On and off rain showers the rest of the day.From Jarred Gap to Neel Gap bear canisters are required to camp in this area. Since we are both using bear cans for our food, decided to head to Woods Hole Shelter due to the weather going down hill. Got to the .4 mile side trail to the shelter and the skies opened up. Long, cold and wet slog to the shelter. Got settled in, ate dinner and spread our gear out in the shelter. We were the 2 hikers there so had plenty of space! Crawled into sleeping bags early to keep warm. Rain poured down all night long. Was kinda hard sleeping with the rain pounding on the tin roof but did manage to get some sleep after awhile.","Gooch Gap

Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647589,"Woke up around 7:30 to a lite rain still falling and colder temps. Ate breakfast, packed up and headed back up the .4 miles to the trail. Was really foggy and the trail was swamped with water from all the rain. Day was going to be wet and muddy.Since Woods Hole is close to Blood Mt, it didn't take too long to reach the summit. Of course no views since it was still cloudy. Spent 15 minutes there and started the decent down towards Neel Gap. The first part going down crosses big flat sections of rock that can be hard to follow the trail...need more white trail markers painted on the rock. After the flat rock areas, the trail is really rough that can tear your knees up. Took it slow until the trail got smoother and made it to Neel Gap and Mountain Crossings outfitters. The night before, we made provisions for Bonnie to pick up our backpacks so we could slack pack to Tesnatee Gap. This section has some quick accent and descents so it was nice not carrying backpacks! Mad it to Tesnatee Gap around 4:00, called Paul to pick us up and headed back to the B&B for the last stay with them.","Woods Hole Shelter

Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648134,"Today was the last day seeing Bonnie and Paul...really gonna miss them. Gave Bonnie a big hug, loaded up into Paul's truck and headed out. Got to Tesnatee Gap around 8:00am and gave Paul an emotional good bye.The worst thing about Tesnatee Gap is the climb up...what a butt kicker first thing in the morning! Was kinda foggy so it seems to give the trees a whole new life.After Tesnatee the hiking is fairly normal ups and downs and not to bad. Just past Low Gap Shelter there is a really cool spring/waterfall. Cameled up with water and head up to Poplar Stamp Gap for a lunch break. There is a really nice camp spot here that Tabasco and I stayed at in 2020.From Poplar Stamp the accent to Blue Mt Shelter is long and gradual. Right after lunch, the sky cleared up and we had some nice views the rest of the day. Haven't really been seeing many hikers during day but upon getting to Blue Mt, it was packed with hikers! Kinda weird, they just seem to pop up at the end of the day. Set up my tent and did normal camp chores before turning in. Still trying to get used to hiker midnight (7:30 - 8:00) since I'm used to going to bed around 11 -12! Woke up around 10pm to about 4 owls hooting like crazy right over the shelter area...totally awesome!","Tesnatee Gap

Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649066,"Woke up a bit later and started getting stuff packed up. Today was going to be a short day since deciding to go into Helen GA for the cold weather that was forecast to move in. After packing up, headed out for Unicoi Gap and a hitch to town. The descent into Unicoi was a bit slick because of the fog moving in. Made good time tho and was soon at the gap trying to hitch a ride. As all hikers know, it's always better to put the girls out to get a hitch since people will stop far faster for them! With just Tabasco and myself it took almost 20 - 25 minutes for someone to stop, lol! A gentleman finally stopped and we threw our packs in and were quickly off to Helen and a warm bed.We got dropped off at the Hotel and went in to get a room for 2 nights. The lady asked if we had a reservation but ofcourse we didn't. After telling her we were just getting into town she finally got everything straightened out and before we knew it, we were in the room...before 10:30am! Pretty much gave us a double zero, sa'weeeeet. Once in the room, the usual gear explosion happened and we soon had our crap spread out all over the room, lol!!After getting cleaned up we decided to head out and get some lunch. Helen is a German style touristy type of town and has a bunch of different restaurants, all of which have excellent food and beer! After lunch I wandered around town and headed back to the room. Once there I decided to do my laundry in the rooms trashcan since I didn't feel like walking back across town to the laundry mat. Gotta do what ya gotta do!! The rest of the time spent in town was relaxing and eating food and drinking beer. When good food is available one must pig out! The cold weather finally moved in and the temperature dropped like a rock and snow showers soon followed along with strong winds. Stepping out of the room I noticed foot long icicles hanging from the lights outside...brrr! Headed back inside for the rest of the day and decided to get a pizza from a place just around the corner. No sense wandering around in the cold for long periods if you don't have to. After eating pizza, started repacking and cleaning up the messy room. Heading back out the next morning so want to be ready to go. Side note: lost my hat either at the hotel, one of the restaurants we ate at or the persons truck we got a ride in...bummer","Blue Mt Shelter

Billy Goat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649075,"Got up around 8:30am, gathered up our packs and headed out the door to check-out and hopefully score a ride. As I was coming out the room, I heard Tabasco talking to someone down in the parking lot. Turns out it was a gut getting ready to take his mother and sister back to the trail. After a few minutes asking if we could get a ride, his mother said to take us up first since she still had a few things to do...score!!!Ran to the office, checked out, pitched our packs into his truck and were soon at Unicoi Gap. Profusely gave our thanks, shouldered our packs and started the long climb out of Unicoi. Boy was it cold! Soon my hands got cold holding my hiking sticks so I had to keep swapping them to 1 hand while the other got jammed into my coat pocket. Then the feet started getting cold, lol! Not much I could do for them but keep moving and hoped thy would warm up, which they finally did thankfully. Didn't have any hand or toe warmers yet so had too make do.Temperatures finally started climbing and the day turned out gorgeous. Had great views from Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain. We were going to stay at Tray Mt shelter but decided to push on to Sassafras Gap since it was nice out. Got to Sassafras Gap and found some really nice tent spots. Got settled in for the evening and while eating dinner a persistent little mouse decided to pay a visit. Could not chase the little bugger off!! After trying to chew through Tabasco's trash from dinner, it finally went off across the trail, possibly to see what the other hikers had for dinner, lol!!!Off to bed after sunset and climbed into my sleeping bag and soon fell asleep, comfy and warm.","Unicoi Gap
