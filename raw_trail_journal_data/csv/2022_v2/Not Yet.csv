Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649418,"I'm a little less than two months from the start of my LASH. I've got from June 18 to August 25ish to complete the stretch of the AT between the Bear Mountain Bridge in New York and Katahdin, sandwiched between two family events. It's a hard stop at August 25th, so I'm prepared to cut things short if I arrive at Monson (or Caratunk if I'm truly slow) without enough time to complete. I'm planning to break the trail into thirds, doing the middle next fall and the southern third the fall after that. I'm pretty confident that I will enjoy it - not my first rodeo at this point, I really enjoyed doing the Long Trail. I'm going to be retiring on June 17, going to my nephew's wedding that night and then in the morning, my wife Kate and I will be driving from the Boston area to New York to drop me off.I have what's in my pack pretty much nailed down at this point. The one thing I'm debating is whether it's going to be warm enough to start out with just a sleeping bag liner or whether to bring the whole sleeping bag. It's a pound difference, I can always just wear a lot of clothes to bed and I'm OK with sleeping a little cold. It would be an experiment and I'd probably switch to the sleeping bag before I hit Vermont. I'm not going to be ultra-light - I am switching to a Gossamer Gear Mariposa pack, but I am also carrying a bear canister instead of hanging my food - that's going to be a big part of my base weight. There was a bear incident in Vermont a couple years ago and they had to shoot the bear. GMC is advising using canisters, so I'm going to comply. Other than that, I have a nice Big Agnes tent - it's free standing which I like and double-walled which I like, but surely more weight than something from ZPacks or similar. I'll probably have a base weight of somewhere between 15 and 20.I've been trying to prepare physically for the hike. I'm doing the hard third first because I'm not getting any younger (will turn 65 on the trail). I go out daily for a simulated hike with a 30 pound ruckweight in a day pack and that's helped. My son and I went up to Bond and the Guyot campsite in New Hampshire overnight last fall and the physical aspect was no big deal, so I think I'll do well in Connecticut and Massachusetts, hopefully get trail legs by the time I hit the Whites. I think I have enough time to take it slow through there, assuming not so many zeros and I should make it to Monson before mid August.It'll be fun meeting people on the trail. I'm looking forward to making friends, hopefully I'll catch on with a group and get a trail family. The Long Trail worked out great that way; I have really fond memories of Wa, Brightside, Ian and Arden who hiked along with me there and I'm hoping that I will find a similarly compatible group. Maybe some older folks, although I may be out at the front of the bubble with the speedsters and get bypassed by all of them. Time will tell. ",,View Entry,"Apr 23, Sat",0
Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652142,"So, less than three weeks until I am starting my trip. I suppose it would be something to worry about if I didn't have butterflies. I'm not worried about bears, not worried about bugs, not worried about the physical exertion or sleeping outside. It's more the logistics that I stew over:* Is the country store going to be closed by the time I get there?* Will I be able to get a hitch / get a shuttle to town?* Will I be able to get a reservation at the hostel - will I be in cell phone range to do so?* Am I going to be able to find a place to charge my electronics?I guess I'm not a go-with-the-flow, the-trail-will-provide type of person. I expect the universe not to co-operate or to be friendly, at least the part outside of the woods. So everything has to be well-planned, has to be buttressed against whatever could go wrong. Reminding myself:* You're not the first to have done this* There are others along, you'll find a tramily like last time and all work together to figure out the logistics* The Bulls Bridge Country Store is open from 6 am to 8 pm at mile 1463. So pack 5 days worth of food.The other thing that worries me is my tent. It's a Big Agnes free standing single person. It has these poles. You have to bend the poles to get the tent shape. I've snapped one of the poles (I did get a replacement). What about the metal fatigue? Are the poles going to hold up, being bent 60 or so more times? Should I have a backup tent? It's a nice tent. There's lots of room inside, double walls so no condensation, bugproof, with a good bathtub so I don't get soaked in the rain. The times I've been out in it in the rain, it's held up well, no worry that it's going to leak, your stuff will be wet and you'll freeze to death. But the poles freak me out, every time I bend them into position.Trying to get away from all this sort of anxiety. Hopefully I will learn to live with it.",,View Entry,"May 29, Sun",0

We got there a little after one, Kate dropped me off, we took photos and suddenly, I was off. Bear Mtn. is an odd place to start the trail. You're among all these families and picnics, people on an outing from New York City on a weekend day. The trail is marked with plastic blazes, you go through the zoo, past the bears (brown bears), then out onto the highway and over the Bear Mountain Bridge. You're over the Hudson, I think it's the only river that is tidal at the place you cross over it. It's brackish up here, still salt water. You go down the road a bit, crossing over from Westchester to Putnam county and then into the woods.I had decided to climb the ridge and take the blue blaze side trail to Anthony's Nose. It is a popular trail, especially on the weekend, lots of couples and friends. You end up on a ledge that overlooks the Hudson and bridge dramatically. It was very windy up there.The trail here is nice enough. There are enough ups and downs but you're often on a ridge, the understory is blueberries (not ripe), fern and mountain Laurel, some still in bloom. The trees are mostly oak.I ended the day at the Appalachian Deli, which is a gas station at one of the road crossings. You can get a sandwich there and something to drink. After that, a short walk to Graymoor Spiritual Center which let's you tent on their ballfield and has some facilities too. They're apparently holding an AA meeting right now with a fire in their fire pit.Who would have thunk? There is a saxophonist too who is pretty good but it is going to be hard to sleep if he continues past hikers midnight.","Bear mtn inn

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653251,"I woke up before 5 AM this morning to a blue sky, gloaming and a waning gibbous moon. My mind was exceptionally clear and calm, I'd had a good sleep. Last night, I dreamt that I was working ( I have just retired) and my boss asked me why I was back. Oh I guess dreams of unfinished work are now going to replace dreams of unfinished classes at school.Yesterday evening, Starbucks, who is here with her husband, Pakka asked me ""Do you have a trail name?"" I replied ""not yet"" and I realized that reply could be taken two ways. So now my trail name is ""Not Yet"". It is not the worst name, I think I will hold onto it.I was out and hiking by 6:30, a nice early start. It was cool but not cold and when I reached the first lookout, there was most on the hills across from me still.There is a story related to the lookout. I had lost my hat. It might have fallen out of my pocket. I might have reacted in any number of ways, been mad, been despondent, but instead, I had ill will to the hat. I cursed at the hat, said it was a stupid hat anyway and it was a good thing that it was lost. So I am hiking and turning a corner to go downhill and there in the middle of the trail, hanging from a branch was the hat. Some hiker must have found it, gotten ahead of me and then hung the hat up for me to find. It was right next to the overlook, so stopping made ne notice the view. It was a twofer. Hat came back like a bad penny. The day was a lot of ups and downs which the AT is famous for. Nonetheless the hiking was nice, dramatic ledges, more unripe blueberries and giant millipedes. There is a placque in the woods marking it as the site of George Washington's inoculation of his troops for smallpox. The cowpox vaccine had not been invented. Washington used a less virulent strain, Variola, to inoculate the troops, protecting them from an outbreak.I ended the day at Canopus Lake where there are lots of families picnicking and swimming. They have a snack bar, all day I was hoping they would have veggie burgers and they did. I had fries and a lemonade to go with them. They also had a shower, cold water only but I took one anyway. I am now in the campground for AT hikers. A group of women are here as is Cooper. It is still early so maybe more later. There is no water source and no privy. I guess we are supposed to go back to the lake to take care of that.","Graymoor spiritual center

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653322,"Don't expect 20 miles from me every day. I ran into a logistical problem where I would have to do an 18 mile tomorrow unless I did the mileage today-there just aren't a lot of shelters.
The day started out with breakfast at the picnic tables at Canopus Lake. The crows were foraging, maybe for a half-eaten hot dog or the bun that went with it. The crows here make this disturbing noise - they say Wow Wow instead of Caw Caw. I guess it is the local dialect.
I climbed out of camp, there is a nice overlook of the lake. The trail goes down, then under the Taconic Parkway, then up to a ridge. That is often the way it goes, a saddle point where the height of the pass for the cars is the hike's low point. There were great views west, some big mountains, too far south to be the Adirondacks I think, maybe the Catskills. If I looked hard, I could make out Camp Kuchalen.
I saw a lot of wildlife today. There was a baby bird, right on the trail. There was nothing I could do to help it-you are not supposed to feed any type of wild animal. I wished it well, wished it as comfortable a life as it could have. Maybe the pathos of the scene, the mind creates a metaphor and maybe, a person could have some tenderness to someone equally frail and helpless.
I also saw two garter snakes, a doe and her faun, and a pile of bear poop. Oh and there, right now is a hermit thrush singing its incredibly beautiful song.
I spent the day walking on schist which is a metamorphic rock. That surprised me. I could really use someone with a scientific bent to do some geology research for me.","Canopus Lake

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653369,"Today was an easy day after yesterday's 20. I made up my mind to take my time. Nevertheless, I felt good and well-rested and in no pain. The terrain was mostly flat, with more downs than ups as I descended into the Housatonic watershed. The trail went through farms (they have these odd half fence half ladder things to get you over the electric fence) and marshes. The trail maintainers had built this impressive walkway across one of the marshes, others were traversed by two 2x4 s put side to side. By the way, the crows today were saying Caw Caw. Maybe crows say Wow only when they get a hot dog.
I received my third trail magic today, an ice cold Gatorade in a cooler left by a trail angel. Thank you Chris and all the other trail angels out there, that sort of refreshment is indescribable after a hot day.
Other things seen, another big oak tree. I may or may not have seen the Dover Oak yesterday, I am not sure, but this one was almost as massive with a crown that might have been 100 feet in diameter and a trunk that may have been six or eight feet thick. I went through a grove of trees, the understory completely covered in mountain Laurel, some in bloom, some not. I saw these fake strawberries. They look almost like real strawberries, there is a picture of one in the photos section. I also saw another doe, looking straight at me from down the trail. So all in all, a good day.
I am set up for what's called a Nero tomorrow, which stands for a near zero day, a day with few miles. I will be walking into Kent where I will recharge, resupply, shower and do my laundry. Will let you all know how it goes tomorrow.","Telephone Pioneer Shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653439,"Today was a short day, a near zero or Nero. The goal was to resupply at Kent, get my clothes cleaned and get in a shower, then go back up into the woods again. But there was a walk, a bit of a climb on a foggy day. Today, I saw what I think was marble although it could have been quartz. I need a geologist badly. Marble is metamorphosized limestone I believe, which means it was once shells and that surely dates the rock.
The climb went up through an understory of ferns, reached a ridge with scant view because of the clouds, then went along a ridge. There were blueberries. All but five were ripe. I may or may not have eaten them. I also saw my first and second red eft. They are salamanders and they are all over the Appalachian Trail.
I went down to the road and Nomad was there. He is a guy my age, retired Navy, He has sold his house and is doing part of the trail before settling down again. His knee was sore, after only four miles of walking, it is the ups and downs that kill the knees, especially the downs, although this is thankfully hearsay to me because my knees have never bothered me. We walked into town together, a short, flat walk, so it was ok for him. We stopped for burgers (they had a beyond veggie burger for me) and sweet potato fries. There is something that happens to you on a through hike, food never tastes as good. The first bite of that sweet potato fry was worth all the miles I have walked so far. The burger was excellent too.
We did our laundry together splitting a machine. He had more socks, three pair, unless my toe socks count in which case we are even. I resupplied at the grocery store, we went and had smoothies (again, heaven) and then I went and had a shower, coin operated, four minutes of bliss.
We parted ways. I had to get to a shelter with someplace flat for my tent, he has a hammock so he could move forward rather than retreat like I did. I had to go south half a mile to get here.
That is all for now, tomorrow a big day, 16 miles.
I forgot. I saw a birch tree with a blue ribbon around it. There were a million caterpillars on it and they were all dead. Do they die when they see the color, blue? Did someone come up here to spray that tree? I don't know. While I was writing this, a dead caterpillar fell out of a tree go figure.","10 mile shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653492,"Today was a day of intertwined stories, flowers, walking and fellow hikers.Flowers first. I saw the most beautiful spray of purple aster growing between two boulders. Walking along the banks of the Housatonic, I saw day lilies, black eyed susan and more asters. I passed a field with asters, black eyed susan and two kinds of clover, one white, one purple. I walked through a mountain Laurel understory and they were all in bloom.The highlight of the hike was St. Paul's Ledges. This is a rock dome, about 500 feet in height. The trail maintainers have artfully woven the descent of it in a seam of the rock where it is split. It was challenging and fun. That was followed by five miles of flat walking along the Housatonic. Then came the ups and downs, with some views, eight miles of them.Wait, there's a story I have to interject. That tree I saw a couple days ago was the borderline of the caterpillar army. I had been seeing comments online, ""hung my tent to dry here, beware of the caterpillar army"". I am in occupied territory now, they have stripped the trees, a gypsy moth infestation.But, the army has been defeated. On tree after tree hang dead caterpillars. I don't know if a parasitid wasp or a fungus got them, but all of what they did seems to have been in vain.Finally, my compatriots. Nomad rallied and made it here with me. Dirty Brad just left after eating a sequestered piece of town pizza. I am here with Penguin, Mushroom and Hot Dog, all of whom I had heard about. I saw Flatpick, who carries a backpack Martin guitar with him. I spent a lot of time talking with Rocker on the Housatonic walk and Rock Steady and I were flip flopping each other throughout the day. All this was on a day where I saw no one for the first several hours of my hike.","My Algo Shelter

Family from Salisbury. I was given three Gatorades by Chris and a Mountain Dew by the others. I signed up for whatever hardships the trail brings, but a cold drink is such a welcome pick me up.
Today was à day of views. I am on the mountains bordering the Housatonic and there are so many views of the farms and towns below and of the mountains on the other side. I ended the day at Lion's Head and Riga Shelter which have spectacular views East. Trotter, Little Bear and I are getting up before dawn to see the sun rise, hopefully I will have pictures.
Hiker hunger has definitely struck me. You get this legendary appetite hiking, two dinners and three dessert appetite. This morning was all about food. Nomad and I made this plan to go to the Mountain Cafe in Cornwall.It was all I could think about. We got there and I had this breakfast burrito, fluffy egg, black beans, refried rice and some kind of hot pepper aoli, finished on a panini press. The first bite, it was as delicious as anything you could get. I savored it. I could easily have eaten two more.
One of my daydreams is to open a restaurant at the top of a mountain that everyone has to hike to, the food will be so delicious.
Long day, I am going to end here, it is past hikers midnight.
Adding a couple more things:
Yesterday, I was coming to crest one of the things I had been climbing and as I got near the top, I could hear ""Raw, Raw"" again, a disturbing crow noise. I got to the top and there were two of them, one making the noise. Once I passed, they stopped. Five minutes later, I hear it again, ""Raw, Raw"". Ten minutes later, Rock Steady passes me. So now I know two words of crow. ""Wow, Wow"" means got a hot dog and ""Raw, Raw"" means ""Human coming"".","Pine swamp shelter

I went up to the shelter to watch the sunrise. A crescent Moon and Venus were out, describing the plane of the Ecliptic. Down below, clouds covered the farms and towns.The trail today started off on the ridge between Lion's Head and Bear Mountain. Mountain Laurels, all in bloom, were on both sides of the trail, to a height of eight or ten feet. Bear Mountain is the highest point in Connecticut, another beautiful view. On top is a monument, built of metamorphic stone by Owen Taylor if I remember right in 1889 if I remember right. Anyway, Owen is probably no longer with us but his big pile of schist is the highest thing in all of Connecticut.I then went through Sages Ravine, all these cool, tall hemlocks shading the gorge with a free flowing brook running through it. On the other side of the brook was Massachusetts so I crossed in. Then up Mt Everett which has dramatic ledges. The ridge on top is covered in pitch pine and blueberries, some ripe.I am at camp tonight, staying with Little Bear and Slow Chef who is from England.","Riga shelter

I am sitting at the trailhead waiting for Kate to pick me up and take me to get cleaned up and fed, not necessarily in that order. The first part of the day was spent descending from the hills into Great Barrington. The descent is a little treacherous, climbing down schist outcroppings and walking on ledges. I leapfrogged with Little Bear a bit, but she soon outdistanced me and I don't know if I will see her again. I have been leapfrogging Slow Chef too. The ridge is mostly pitch pine and there are intermittent views. Today, there was no water between camp and the road, there was a gentleman at the first road crossing, sitting in a chair, handing out gatoraides and pop tarts. Slow Chef, Flatpick and I took the trail magic and chatted a bit.The trail flattens out, fern understory and hemlocks. It is a little boggy but because it has been dry it isn't too bad with mosquitoes. I went through cornfields and fallow fields full of milkweed, over some railroad tracks. I saw a turtle, big snapping turtle bigger than a dinner plate. And here I am.","Glen brook

I know that there will be days where I walk through this, and truthfully, the rain is welcome, it will replenish our water sources, but today I am going to cocoon with Kate and we can do things together before we part ways tomorrow morning.We are staying at the Fairfield Inn, which is relatively upscale for a hiker destination, but that is nice.

She drove all the way out here, found us a nice hotel, stayed the extra day. The thing you should know about Kate is that she always puts me first, no matter what.The day started out walking along the Housatonic. I passed by farms with cornfields, raspberries growing in the margins. I had just eaten breakfast so I left them for the small animals.Leaving the Housatonic, the trail made the first ascent of the day. There are two kinds of lichen on the rocks, a small turquoise one and a large blackish one with the appearance of tree ear. It had rained the night before and that had transformed the larger lichens; they were now olive in color. I guess the moisture activates the algae to produce chlorophyll.I am walking today on a translucent white and orange rock. If I had to make a guess, I would say it is limestone, but I am not a geologist. There is a picture of one in the photos if someone wants to confirm.The trail went through white pine, maple, birch and a few oak with an understory of unripe blueberry. There are caterpillars here but the oaks aren't stripped like before, maybe because of their sparseness.Near the top of Mt. Wilcox is Beckett Pond. My sister, Gina, left me a dollar under a rock here a few months ago with directions on how to find it. I located the signpost and bridge and found the rock, but no dollar underneath. It did look a little green under, maybe the dollar rotted. I called Gina, confessed to the misfortune and we had a nice chat.The day ended near a beaver bog. These are my favorite habitats up here I think, so full of life and so beautifully quiet. Some underwater animal was scooting along, leaving little v wakes and you could see the lodge, tucked under a boulder on the shore.","Great Barrington

I turned on tracking on my Garmin, but something went wrong with my GPS and it did not track the first few miles. I was in a cell dead spot (am again tonight) so I couldn't post my journal, sorry if all that caused anyone panic.
Ok, onto the good stuff. I came down off of Mt. Wilcox, mostly gradual descent, a soft trail today, Hemlock needles and dirt. The understory today was small white flowers with red berries in places, others, it was fern, sometimes shoulder-high. The trail is well-maintained through here and well thought out too, more than just for thru hikers. One section, Cobble Hill Trail, consists of a gentle climb to views of farmland below with benches at the viewpoints and a picnic table. The trail descends from there, intersecting a farm.

Then the trail goes through a marsh with a nice boardwalk laid through it.The second part of the day was the climb to Goose pond, mostly through Hemlock. You go around the pond to a blue blaze trail and then there you are. There is a two story cabin, swimming, canoeing and, best of all, pancakes for breakfast.

When you think of a mountain, the picture is usually of something like Mt. Fuji, pretty much the same on all sides. Not so the Appalachians. They are like the ribs of some giant latent beast, the ridge on top and valley, brook, river at the bottom. Climbing one has a rhythm to it. First, you relentlessly climb until you get to the shoulder and from that point on, the trail continues generally upward, but it will be level for a while or even down. Eventually you see blue sky and when you feel a breeze, you are at the top.Today's only climb was at the start. We have left the caterpillar army behind and entered a world of birch, maple and hemlock. The trail passed hree beaver ponds and a regular one, but up until the end, other than that, we were in the green tunnel, light barely penetrating to the forest floor. Without the sun, it is cool and pleasant.One of the highlights of the day was the cookie lady. By coincidence, her son was the caretaker at Upper Goose Pond. The cookie lady is more of a tradition than a person. The owner of this blueberry farm, next to the trail, gives out cookies, lemonade and other kinds of hospitality. This is the second cookie lady, she took over the farm and the job two years ago. I had a rhubarb lemonade and a cookie, thanked her and was on my way.There was one vjew at the top of a hill, cleared of trees, full of ferns with blueberries and raspberries on top. You could see what I think is Mt Greylock. It looks far away, but I should be halfway up it by tomorrow's end.I am here in camp with only Slow Chef. He reminds me of the Credence Clearwater song, ""Jeremiah was a bullfrog a very good friend of mine.

The first goal of the day was to have second breakfast in Dalton at Juice and Java. I had heard that their breakfast burritos were good.
It was an easy downill cruise into Dalton. The Housatonic is there, you go over a bridge by a mill building. Juice and Java is just a hundred yards off trail and I was there by 7:30. I had a mango smoothie and a bean breakfast burrito, two soft eggs, beans and salsa in a tortilla finished in the panini maker. It was so delicious.Dalton is much like many New England towns. There is a main drag and then houses radiating outwards. I saw Old School at one of them. He had camped in the back yard of a gentleman who hosts hikers as a trail angel. They were eating breakfast at a picnic table and I stopped to chat, but did not get anything to eat. I knew I had that burrito in my future.You wend your way through Dalton, past houses and ballfields before reenteringn the forest. The trail was soft today, hemlock needles, birch leaves or just dirt. I saw more of what I am calling Limestone, radiating its inner light softly.  I also saw a conglomerate, river stones in some sort of substrate like Roxbury Puddingstone but subtler. At one point, I walked on grey sand, weathered from rocks nearby.Eventually, I got to Cheshire. The AT intersects a rail trail bike path and at the crossroads is a quirky ice cream place run by a nice 80 year old woman. Ketchup was there, he is nicknamed that because he starts the day late, then catches up. We both had pineapple milkshakes and I had a vegetable sandwich. You order at one door, then pick up at the window on the opposite side, no explanation of why. The pineapple shake was refreshing, the sandwich, it was like something your grandmother would make you, delightfully amateurish.The four miles after Cheshire were the ones I was dreading. There is a climb up one of those dinosaur ribs to a ridge, but the ridge connects to Greylock and there is only a four hundred foot climb after that to the shelter.Sunfish, who I have been leapfrogging with stopped by. He has a package to pick up tomorrow so he had to make time and go further so I am here with one other person, a ridge runner named Sam who is a teacher in the off season.Kate is picking me up tomorrow and we will see friends.

Everything up to this point has been hemlock, white pine, birch, maple and oak. We will be seeing more fir in Vermont as well as spruce.

My time there was so restorative. We watched the Sox play the Cubs, a big ask of Peter because the Yankees were playing.
You walk across Route 2 in North Adams, go over the Housatonic and some train tracks at and then disappear into the cool woods. The trail parallels a brook as it ascends.

I got to a road crossing and a trail angel, Care Bear, had set up an impressive spread, cokes, snacks, hamburgers and hot dogs. He had a dog with him, something like a small collie with its tail clipped so that when it was happy, the whole rear wagggled back and forth. That dog hiked the entire Appalachian Trail.

The trail ascends to Harmon Hill which has a perfect view of Bennington, which has the monument to the battle in the center, tall stone oblesk. From there, the trail drops precipitously, a series of stone steps that lead to the highway to Bennington. On the other side, the trail does the opposite, a steep ascent.It has been a cool day which is great hiking weather. Part of this is the increase in altitude and maybe part being North. It gives you energy to have cool weather and today was an easy day even though it was almost all up.So, there was this Trix Treats that must have fallen out of someone's pack, littering the trail. There were three possibilities, to leave it there, to pick it up and discard it two days later in Manchester or to eat it. It was hermetically sealed, I checked. I ate it. I make no apologies. It was delicious. Trix is not for kids, I ate it anyway. I stopped today at Goddard Shelter. There are two ways to split this section up, a fourteen mile day today and a twenty tomorrow, or vice versa. Most of the people I started out with said they would stop at Goddard, but have continued onto Kid Gore. I climbed to the top of Glastonbury Mountain, where there is a fire tower with Justin and Rock Steady. The view from the top was amazing. You could see the cirque of what I think is Stratton Mountain, all the lakes and ponds and so many mountains in the distance. There was nothing but green forest to the North, no sign of civilization. I almost forgot. I saw a King Rat Birch tree today. A King Rat is a legendary animal that happens when a bunch of rats get their tails entangled   The same thing happened to maybe four or five birch trees. Their roots and trunks were entangled together.  Unfortunately the picture of it is too big to upload.","Cogdon Shelter

It is a quarter mile from the shelter and I made it there in the gloaming light.I don't know why I bother taking pictures. They don't describe it. At the top of the fire tower, the firs below, from the top you see their spring green new growth, shadows of the mountains in the gloaming. The hermit thrush is singing its flute like morning sun, the sky to the east, orange and red and it is reflected in the pond in the valley. And then there she is, our dear friend, source of everything, under the clouds rising silently and roundly to bring to today whatever comes.The adventure gave me a bit of a late start, 7:00, but the story of the day is I took a shortcut. There are different rules for different trails. If you do the continental divide trail, you almost certainly wouldn't take the official route if there is one. There are many alternates, some of them celebrated. The only rule is touching the north and south border markers with a set of connected footsteps in between. The Appalachian is different. The trail is marked by white blazes, vertical rectangles painted on trees and rocks. A purist will pass every single one. Others willl blue blaze, taking side trails that aren't on the official route. There is orange blazing, which means taking a car to skip a section and even aqua blazing, where you take a boat. Different rules apply to me because I am a section hiker. If I blue blaze a section that I have covered the right way, I still get to wear the crown at the end, even if mine is tin and the thru's, gold  So, it was a rainy day and I decided to take the alternative instead of going up and down Stratton Mountain.It was an interesting day nonetheless. I don't mind the rain as long as I don't slip. Most of the day after Glastonbury was flat, through birch forest. I am getting an appreciation for birch. I always thought of them as flimsy, rotting easily, leaving their white bark which you can use to start a fire, even when wet. But I have been seeing some determined trees, past the stage where the bark is white and smooth. They attain great height and persist at it. I saw one today, it went up, took a right turn, then went up again.The other notable thing that happened was that I met a family through hiking, three boys between the ages of eight and twelve or so, mom and dad. The kids were in high spirits despite the rain and hiked vigorously, easily passing me. I chatted briefly with the father. The grandparents are following with a support camper which takes some of their burden off.Just forgot, one more thing, we are seeing southbounders, our first and second. They started April 30 and May 1. At that time of year, Katahdin is closed to hiking because of weather and snow so they started at the base. One of them has the trail name, Waist Deep, because that is how high the snow was.I am now in Stratton Shelter. Rock Steady and Justin are here.

The goal today was to get to town, get some resupply done and stay someplace comfortable and dry. Last night it rained, it poured and whatever else can happen. The shelter at Stratton Pond is a big one, but all the bunks were full and people were sleeping on the floor. Vermont's section of the AT has both AT hikers and Long Trail hikers on it. There are a lot of people just starting their Long Trail thru hike, so it is a little crowded.

It started out with Rocket Man and I getting a shuttle from the econolodge to the trail at 8:15, a late start for me. It is only a three mile climb to Bromley from a trailhead with a lot of parking. This would make a great day hike, a little strenuous, but short enough. There is marble mixed into the regular rock, white and green. Almost to the top, you break out of the woods onto the ski trail. Some people regard the ski trails as a blight on the mountain, but here, in the summer, the trails are covered in wildflowers with the Queen Anne's lace up to six feet high. The view from the top is 360 because of the ski trails and you can see all the mountains, the ones that you've passed, the ones that you are going to and the ones you are never going to climb.After Bromley, the trail descends a bit and follows a ridge. There are spruce, tightly packed together. If the maple form a massive vault, the spruce form a more intimate space, with the crown starting as low as ten feet and the numerous trunks obscuring any view past a few tens of yards. The dead spruce make a substrate for lush moss. It is my favorite type of forest.We went past Griffith Lake which was pretty enough and the day ended with a 200 foot climb up an exposed ledge. I am so grateful, on the eve of my 65th birthday to not only have the fortitude to do it but the strength to enjoy it too.
A couple of notes: the toads keep playing frogger on the trail. As I approach, they jump in front of me and I have to watch my feet and poles to avoid them. Sometimes if the trail has a lip, the toad will forlornly hop hop hop trying to get over.
Passing the beaver ponds, I often find that the top of the water is chest-level to me because I am below the dam. Something feels very wrong about that as if the laws of physics do not apply.","Manchester

I saw a lot, let's see if I can remember...The first stop of the day was the Big Branch River. I  think it's not big enough really to be a river, but it is bigger than a brook. It runs fast and there are some good places to take a dip. That is one of the threads for today, places to go swimming. There is a suspension bridge over Big Branch, another thread. The cables are anchored by massive concrete blocks and this is deep in the wilderness. I have no idea how it was done, helicopter? Cement mixer? All possibilities are unlikely. It is a beautiful river and you get to go by it for a bit.The next stop is Little Rock Pond, guessing it was named for the boulder at the far end of the pond. The mountain behind has exposed ledges, so the view is dramatic.Next stop was White Rocks. As the name says, there are lots of white rocks all over the place and people have built cairns and sculptures out of them. On the way down, I passed by a grove of firs with the understory completely covered by baby firs. A little way further down, firs with an understory covered by moss, further down, first with their blow down detrus covering the forest floor.I had about eight miles left in the day at that point, the last two highlights at the end. There is an overlook above an airport but the highlight of the day is Clarendon Gorge. A brook runs through the gorge, cutting the limestone walls into sinuous forms. I took my shoes off and put my feet in the water, they've done so much for me and they deserve all the care I can give them.The last bit was a climb up the cleft in a ledge up to the shelter where I am staying with a great group of thru hikers including Rock Steady and Rocket Man.","Lost pond shelter

I have less of that V shape and more of that scrawny box shape. Oh well.
So I made a strategic error, planning a 17 mile trip for a town day. This would normally mean getting to town at four or so and not being able to resupply. I made the tactical decision to wake up at 4:00, break camp in the dark, and I was off walking before sunrise.Today started going up, past Beacon Hill, which is named that because there is an airport beacon light at the top. The trail went between two swiftly flowing streams that cut ravines on either side. I went past a farm with that spicy scent of milkweed in the fallow fields. The last time I was there, it was in the middle of a thunderstorm. Today is a cloudless blue sky day, what a difference.Now I have two feet, Lefty and Righty. Righty is always the one giving me trouble. The ball of the foot hurts at the end of the day and I am going to lose the toenail off the fourth toe, no biggie it happens to most hikers. Even Righty's shoe is in worse shape. Well, today, I was crossing a stream and Lefty was on a rock and it slipped and Lefty submarined pretty seriously.

I felt wistful at the junction, like I was getting kicked out of Vermont. I went past Kent Lake and the car camper site nearby. Lots of families, kayaks, people out for short hikes. There is a waterfall by the trail, reasonably close to the road so there were a lot of people in white socks and tennis shoes taking pictures.After that, well, it is a lot of ups and downs, nameless, viewless peaks. This day had over a mile of elevation gain and pretty much as much descent. Truthfully it was a bit of a slog. But, at one point, just at the start of one of the ups, Fletch was sitting making conversation and it turns out, handing out ""mobile trail magic"". He gave me two Jolly Ranchers, a pineapple and a strawberry. I unwrapped and ate the pineapple. ""Wow that tastes good!"", ""I am so happy!"". I powered up the hill.

The ridges go north and south without a break in them and since we are going East, there is nothing to be done but to go over every one of them. Today was a short day, but there were a lot of ups and downs.
Because it was a short day, I made up my mind to catalog the ferns and conifers in the understory. There should be pictures of them in that section When you walk, you have to watch your feet, so the understory is mostly what you look at. There are two types of miniature conifers. The first has just the one stem with the needles off of the sides. The second has its greens spread out umbrella style.I cataloged five types of ferns. The first one has dark green leaves without much serration branching out directly from the stem. The second is a lighter green branching out from the stem, with coarse serrations. The third is the common one, what you probably think of when you say fern. It is light green with the leaves branching from the stem, but with finer, more fractal serrations. The fourth is like the third, but larger and more upright. The fifth has a fine thin black stem that spirals helically upward and other similar black stems branch off of that and coarsely serrated light green leaves coming off of the secondary stem.I went on a side jaunt today to Teago General Store. This is something we do, walk three quarters of a mile out and another three quarters of a mile back for town food. When I got there, Cinderella, Chef and Big Dipper were there.

In front of me sinuous schist which takes on a metallic sheen in the sun and one square piece of marble. The Connecticut roughly marks the geological dividing line and tomorrow I may be on Granite. Kate and I have wedding rings, maybe fashioned out of the same stone, a brownish, black speckled granite. The stone unites us and granite is what we are. I will see her tomorrow.I have been travelling increasingly through white pine and here tonight, I am in a white pine forest, the five-needle bunches covering the ground. White Pine is five, pitch pine is three. White Pine is big and straight and tall, Pitch Pine is short and twisted.White Pines suffer from the tragedy of the commons. There is only so much sun and if one white pine grows taller than the rest, that one prospers. So there is a competition. The tree must grow up straight as fast as it can and as tall as it can to have it's crown take in the light. The trees here are tall, perhaps 100 feet or more, and when they are in groves with their like, they are straight.In my family, there is a saying, ""fiction and fact from Lee's Almanac"" and without the internet, I can't fact check myself so some of this is from memory and some conjecture. When the British colonists came to New England, the forest was white pine, it being the apex tree. They wanted to reshape the land to their agrarian lifestyle unlike the Original People, who lived with the forest. The trees were tall and straight and tall and straight trees were needed for masts on ships. Ones of a certain diameter or larger were the King's trees, marked as such and destined for the navy which would soon be the force of British Imperialism around the globe. Undoubtedly others became the  masts of slave ships, a fourfold misery, for the trees, for those who were here before, for those who fell under British rule and for those who were captured and had their labor brutally taken from them.Yet, here some stand still, reclaiming at least some of the forest and I have the privilege to be with them.
Notes for the day: I have crossed over the White River. The trail passes through West Hartford there and passes by The Barn, a building with a big AT emblem on it. The owner, a kindly woman if there ever was one, was on the side porch with regular and decaf coffee urns and cold drinks for hikers. I saw her, waved, made my way to the porch and took a seat. I told her I didn't need anything but a bit of a rest and we had a nice chat, the shelter ahead and it's lack of water, who had passed through, even where to shop on the coast of Maine. It was nice to make her brief acquaintance.
White blazes have a different feel when you are walking through town. They are inconspicuous hobo marks, quietly and inconspicuously painted on telephone poles and on the backs of traffic signs good secretly left there for those of us who walk through.There have been a lot of sugar maples and the setup to harvest their sap.

He was a good conversationalist and we talked about our kids, our past professions (we share an alma mater coincidentally), the trail ahead and the people we have seen.A lot of the talk among people the last several days has been about the logistics of getting through the Whites. There are a limited number of tent sites and spots at shelters and huts and there are a lot of people who are out for just a day or two, also wanting to tent. The campsites appear near enough to each other but we don't yet know how difficult the miles are. The knot of the puzzle seems to be Mount Washington. Do you stay in the Dungeon at Lake of the Clouds or beg them for work for stay? Do you bypass it and make your way to the campsites off the ridge at Mt. Madison? Do you take the shuttle off of the top of Mt. Washington one day and then take the shuttle up the next morning? Or, since different rules apply to section hikers, do I put off the traverse for some other time when I can schedule hut to hut?

Cardigan is a great mountain, bald granite at the top and not that hard to climb with 360 views at the top.Other than that, I am adapting to the new flora, more weedy and there were cattails in the beaver pond. The forest floor is very different from Vermont, sparse cover if any.","Hanover NH

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654807,"Short day, lots of nice views again. There are pleasures to be had in New Hampshire. The second noble truth is that suffering is caused by attachment to that which is impermanent. Well, being in Vermont was impermanent, so it is time to move on  Let the eye adjust to what beauty there is to be had. Here, a lot of it is found in the white granite. The granite ledges make a nice contrast to the firs and spruces and when the granite weather's, it makes this fine gray sand which is actually pretty handsome as you walk down a path.
Today could be divided in two, the ascent up Smarts Mountain and what followed. You go up an adjacent peak, with fine views off of ledges of what will follow. You can see how the ridge winds to the base of Smarts Mountain and you can see the fire tower on top. You walk the ridge in between, which is spruce and fir and surely pretty enough and then begin the ascent. Today, a trail crew from the Dartmouth Outing Club was building steps out of whatever rocks were at hand. They had tools for breaking rock, moving rock and making beds for the rock to lie on. I was perhaps the first hiker to try some of the steps, it beats walking on steeply inclined rock, but it is still tiring. I thanked them for their work.Above them, there was a section of rebar anchored in the stone to make steps. I am not sure why they picked that one spot, but it is the first rebar I have seen so far. After that, the trail levels off and you soon reach the fire tower which of course has fantastic 360 views if you climb it.The trail winds downward much less steeply and travels through spruce groves before you reach the bottom. There is a 500 foot or so climb up to Hexacuba where I am now, a hexagonal shaped shelter with a pentagonal shaped privy. I have hung my second bear bag, this one only took three throws and is a pretty good job. There is no water up here and there are only two tent sites, not ideal but here I am anyway.I thought I was going to be the only one here tonight, but people are showing up including the swedish couple, Trekker and Pilgrim.","Trapper John Shelter

From Hexacuba shelter, the trail ascends to granite ledges with 50 mile views. The ledges are fun to climb and beautiful, white, massive translucent and vaguely crystalline, like if you tapped a diamond with a hammer,.shattering it's crystalline structure. Just like yesterday with Smarts, it is a false summit with a ridge to the base of the mountain. The climb up was not so bad and the views were to the West from the bald granite summit. The moon was still visible, gibbous waning as it was when I started. It has been a lunar month on trail for me. I could barely make out the fire tower on Smarts from My Cube, that was a half day walk away for me. I can judge distances now somewhat from what I have walked, 10, 20 and 50 mile.The second half of the day was mostly about getting to the hikers welcome hostel and the base of Moosilauke which I will hike tomorrow, my first white mountain of this hike. In the middle, though, I stopped in the Green House Restaurant. It had just opened for the day, but there were ten hikers there ahead of me, mostly people who I stayed with at Hexacuba. It was fun, some of us ordered beers, we pretty much all ordered too much pizza and then we ate it all. The bartender put on Van Morrison which was nice. We talked about it, he said he had seen Van Morrison in concert and he played the entire set with his back to the crowd.
It was another five miles to the hostel which is close to the trail. After Mt. Cube, the trail was tame, like some reservation trail starting in your back yard, which I suppose it is, it just happens to coincide with the AT at this point.That is it for today, except for hanging out with friends here.","Hexacuba sheltet

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654871,"Today was my first day in the Whites and the culmination of many good choices. I have walked for years now with a thirty pound ruck weight in a backpack. I picked starting in New York so I would have trail legs by the Whites and would not yet be worn out. And today, I made a great choice, with the help of the caretakers at Hikers Welcome Hostel, to have them drive me to Kinsman Notch to do Moosilauke North to South, slack packing. I left my tent, sleeping bag, clothes and cooking stuff at the hostel. I weighed my pack. It was 12 pounds with water. The second part of the decision was to do the north face going up. The north face is steeper and more treacherous and humans are built so much better for going up than going down. So even though it is more physically strenuous to do it this way, it is far safer and more pleasant.
The climb started out along the Beaver Brook waterfalls which parallel the trail. The trail is all steps, wooden steps anchored by rebar, stone steps, and steps carved out of solid rock. Without the extra 15 pounds, I flew up. It has been a humid day, and I was quickly drenched in sweat. My secret superpower is my buff*, despite the way it looks on me, the buff drenched in water cools my head down which makes an incredible difference.
You have heard this before, the trail levels off to a ridge, in this case, all spruce and all of them growing vigorously. You can see the main peak at this point, then you start the ascent, which is not that rough. You break treeline about a quarter mile from the top and are in an alpine field with orange and green grass, a narrow path marked on either side with stones keeping hikers from trampling the delicate environment.The top, of course, was epic. Moosilauke is 4800 feet tall and from the top, you can see all the Whites with Mt. Washington towering in the distance. Today was hazy, the details indistinct. Alpine wildflowers grew between the crevices of rock, not just surviving, but being beautiful in doing so.The trail down does have a nice cruise section through the spruce and is very handsome, but you soon exit the ridge. It is a long way down, compared to the early part of the day, a long, unremarkable way down. And, it started to rain, after so many clear days. Yup, I got wet, but I had dry clothes in the hostel and I am comfortable.
I am getting shuttled to the Notch Hostel in a bit and will slack pack again tomorrow.* I was reminded that you all may not know what a buff is. It is a tube of fabric, a long one, a little less in diameter than your head, which is the key to it's use. Depending on how you tie or configure it, it can be a headband, a hat, a neck warmer, some sort of hair scrunchie maybe. Mine has pemathrin which keeps off the.bugs, I wear it over my ears and dangling down the back of my neck which gives the mosquitoes one less target.","Hikers Welcome Hostel

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654949,"Today was a long but good day. I had arranged to go on a shuttle to Kinsman's Notch, then slack pack over the Kinsman mountains to route 93 where I would be picked up. It is 16 miles in the Whites, it takes between eight and 12 hours to do it, so it is a long day, but one without a full pack.
The day started with our short shuttle ride at 7:00 to the trailhead. It had rained yesterday afternoon and through the night, but the sky had started to clear. The day started going up Mt. Wolf. There was water everywhere and after we made the first ascent, there was a bog with puncheon. Puncheon are like a simple causeway generally above mud or boggy water. The trail maintainers find a tree, cut two short sections and lay them perpendicular to the trail, then lay two longer sections parallel to the trail on top of the other logs. When puncheon get old, things happen and on this still wet day, things happened. The puncheon in the bog had sunken, or the water had risen to the point where they were completely submerged and there was nothing to it but to take the ""freedom step"". Once you have taken your first step into water and gotten your feet wet, you have the freedom to walk straight through any water you encounter because your feet are already as wet as can be.I ran into some other water problems. The puncheon, once submerged can get a layer of silt on top of them and are then indistinguishable from the surrounding mud. You can probe for them with your trekking poles, but I went straight through, missed the puncheon and ended up in mud to my knees. I wasn't the only one.Sometimes the water is good. We reached Eliza Brook Falls about midway through the hike. The water was clear and the falls were powerful unlike the ones at Moosilauke yesterday. The water from them was good, cold and pure.There are a series of connecting ridges and climbs on the way up Kinsman, some of them a bit technical and arduous. I had to use my upper body to pull myself up at many locations today. At one point, you reach a small pond, with cliffs behind, that was quite striking. But there are more climbs from there until you reach South Kinsman which has a view of Franconia Ridge where we will be tomorrow. Today was pretty dramatic, low, dark clouds scudding over the mountain, but the air was clear and the visibility good. There is a bowl on the west side, a cirque which if I remember right happens to northern mountains because of the erosion caused by melting ice. 
From South Ninsman, you go down a saddle and then up to North Kinsman. Neither peak seems to be marked by a sign and the peak of North Kinsman is in the spruce trees with no view, but there is a ledge nearby with more views of Franconia Ridge.
On the way down, things are a bit more civilized. There are steps, both wood anchored with rebar and others where the rock was broken to make a horizontal surface. There was one spot where there were three steps, then 20 feet of featureless, slippery rock, then some more steps, as if someone hadn't finished it, oh well, thankful for what you have.
At the bottom is Lonesome Lake Hut, run by the AMC. There seemed to be some youth group there, it is a nice spot, the lake is good for swimming and the peaks tower handsomely over the lake.
That is it for tonight, well past hikers midnight already.","Notch Hostel

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655031,"First of all, a shout-out to the Notch Hostel. It is a large farmhouse in perfect condition, two kitchens for us to cook in, comfortable beds, laundry. But more than that, the staff were relentlessly cheerful and helpful. Their gardener even planted raspberries and blueberries in the back yard for the hikers to pick.
So today was Franconia Ridge, which is really special for me. About 10 years ago, I day hiked it and the view as you come above treeline was so breathtaking that I said to myself, ""this is where you belong"". The second time I climbed it, it was with my son and that is one of my favorite memories. Today, the joy was somewhat tempered though, I had a four day food supply in my pack and that kind of wore me out a bit. But I am so grateful to have the opportunity anyway.
You all know the drill. The trail starts out with a relentless five mile climb up just past Liberty Springs Campsite, then you start on the saddle between Mt.Liberty and the first of the haystacks (I think). It is a nice ridge with the smell of the spruce. Then you reach the mountain, then you climb the mountain and enter into the alpine zone. To the east is the Pemiwegansett wilderness, the Bonds, Owls Head and more, to the West is the bald face of Cannon. The cloud ceiling was just above us. You go from peak to peak until you reach Lafayette on an exposed ridge. There are a lot of hikers, so it looks like a pilgrimage which I guess it is. It all is very dramatic.
The Appalachian trail leaves most of the hikers behind after Lafayette. You hike on the exposed ridge alone, it is just as spectacular as Franconia Ridge but you get to be alone. Then the trail descends again into the forest. On the way to Mt. Garfield, you pass a nice beaver pond with the beaver lodge at the back, and then there is another arduous climb up the mountain.
For me, the best view of the day was from the summit of Garfield. The afternoon light was soft and the mountains cast long shadows. I was with many of the people I have been hiking with including Ketchup, who I had last seen around Great Barrington.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655115,"I was dreading today but I needen't have. It was a 14 miler, I was going over Twin Mountain which I had heard was tough, it was going to rain, a thunderstorm. We all got up early with the intent to get to the part of today's hike that was at low altitude. It was fun to watch how efficiently everyone can do things after 1800 miles and a hundred repitiotions. Tents quickly came down, camp stoves emerged from packs and we're put together. People are with a sense of purpose and speed and we were all out before 6:00.
The day started out a little scary-disappointing. The water source for the Garfield shelter runs down the trail and over a steep hand over hand section which you have to navigate amidst a small stream. The trail flattened out though and went into the Galehead Hut. Unfortunately, breakfast hadn't happened - there is a tradition where through hikers get the leftovers. We then had to climb Twin. I don't know why I thought it would be so bad. It is less than a mile to the top and although it has a couple hand over hand sections, it wasn't bad at all. Of course there is a view at the top but I have run out of superlatives.
There is some going down, but you quickly end up among the short spruce. There are two plants in the spruce understory that I haven't described. The first has two or three long leaves (depending on wheter the moose ate one or not) with a single crease running up the middle. It has a single stalk which might have small, indistinct flowers, maybe three green berries or if ripe, these are a handsome blue black. The second has four fat leaves with five creases running from the leaf stem to the tip. It has a single white flower or a clutch of small orange berries (until the moose eats them). I love them both.There is an alpine area before you reach the Zeeland Hut, with dwarf spruce and a field of grass, all at low altitude, I have no idea why. When we reached the Zeeland Hut breakfast was over and there were leftover pancakes and oatmeal. Clean Machine, who I have been travelling with the last few days took the oatmeal and I looked at the pancakes, small things, and took only four because I didn't want to be greedy and eat all of them.We were racing the storm at this point. You could hear the thunder. Luckily, the Zeeland Hut is the start of the low part, a cruisy trail with a crushed rock surface. The trail goes by some cliffs. There were lots of blueberries, ripe ones (can you detect a theme?). I guess the rock that was there before the cliffs became cliffs has to go somewhere, it had all fallen into the ravine beneath the trail, big grey refrigerator size pieces. But I was racing the rain and successfully. I did get minor wet, but made it to the shelter before the storm hit... but it didn't, it fiizzled out.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655156,"Today was a short day. It was only 10 miles, but it went down to Crawford Notch, up the Webster Cliffs and onto Mt. Jackson before stopping at the Mitzpah Spring hut and Naumann tent site.
The descent into Crawford Notch is easy and gradual. I must not have been that high up to start with. Then the climb to the Webster Cliffs begins. In the Whites, you rarely see switchbacks, trails that zig zag up a mountain to make the ascent more gradual and to reduce erosion, but here, the trail maintainers had made an attempt and there were only a couple hand over hands. I was hiking for a while with a section hiker, out for the day to complete the stretch up Webster to Jackson. It turns out that her husband studies high elevation fir and spruce environments and was at Killington recently taking soil samples to determine the microbial environment. My favorite trees in my favorite place, what a coincidence and what a great job to have.Eventually, you get to the Webster Cliffs. Now anything that has the word ""cliff"" or even worse, ""knife edge"" fills me with apprehension. These however, there are viewpoints where you might get close to the edge if you wanted to, but nothing truly dangerous, at least the cliff part. There are however seams you have to climb, hand over hand, some thirty feet or more. It is challenging for me, I have to plan it out and often it requires some upper body strength which is not my strong suit. The views make it worth it, route 302 below with the train track running next to it, cliffs across the way and in the distance, the mountains that we climbed yesterday and the day before. I stopped at one of these outlooks for quite a while. Lefty and Righty have wet socks and shoes on after the rain, so I took a break to air them out and set the socks to dry on warm rocks. I meditated for 10 minutes. Good move! Socks were dry and warm when I finished. My feet deserve the best even if they often don't get that.After you summit Mt Webster, there is a ridge of spruce alternating with steep ups and downs until you reach Jackson. The AT is pretty empty, mostly you see some southbounders or your friends pass you, but as you summit Jackson, it is an entirely different scene. There is a short trail up to Jackson from a parking lot and apparently, it is easily doable for small kids because quite a number of them were up on top with their parents enjoying the view. You can see Crawford Notch in one direction and in the other, Washington and you can make out all the antennas and such on its summit. It is now less than a day's walk away.On the way down, there is a bog with puncheon and a muddy, possibly jumpable gap in between. I chose not to jump the gap, placed my left foot on a nearby bank and it slipped into the mud up to my thigh. It sure smelled interestingly anerobic and peaty. My left side was a muddy mess. When I got to camp, Blaze Dog had a matching muddy left leg. We had a good laugh about it and I have tried to wash the pants as best I can in the camp stream. They are hanging up to dry now.","Ethan Pond

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655205,"Yes, that is right. I was facing logistical problems regarding where I would stay tonight. Plan A was to go to the hut and ask if they had any late cancellations. Plan B was to push three tough miles past the hut and get a space at Osgood Tent Site on a crowded Saturday. Plan C was to stealth in the woods, ideally, you go 200 feet off trail and look for a flat spot that can't be seen from the trail, practically, what I had heard was that there were spots that people use right off the trail. Well, plan A worked and I am platinum blazing it tonight.
The day began as many have recently, an early start gives you more options. I was up before dawn, the waning crescent moon followed by Mars then Jupiter (I believe). I was off at dawn up Pierce. I am doing the presidential today, so you will hear some presidents. Pierce has a bit of steep ups, but the other thread through the day will be that the presidential never rise much off of the ridge, so the ups were brief and they ended up in the alpine zone above tree line. There is a lot of mica in the rock, shiny and some of it large. My father and I used to look for mica in beach rocks. It has a two dimensional crystal structure, so you can peel off thin sheets which is what we used to do together. I passed a small clearing with two different kinds of lichen and other alpine plants, it is the picture of the day. That is for a reason, this hike is for beauty and not for glory, and to me, with all the indescribable views I had, this small diorama so poignant because it is both fragile and tough, was the most beautiful thing I saw today. So the next presidential after Pierce is Eisenhower. You don't actually go up all the presidentials, you go on Crawford Path to Washington and Gulfside Trail from Washington and there are blue blaze (actually yellow blaze) trails to the presidential peaks. I was on Crawford when I was passed by a trail runner trying to do the Presidential Traverse which is when you complete all of the Presidentials in one day. We exchange pleasantries. A couple minutes later he came running the other way because he had missed the side trail to Eisenhower.The day started partly cloudy, with Washington's summit barely visible under ominously dark clouds. Very Transylvania like with all of the buildings and towers on top. The trail was mostly flat and well groomed and I was able to make good time to Lake of the Clouds hut where they were just finishing breakfast. Most of them seemed to be on their way up to Washington, a big crowd. The trail becomes even more gentle and groomed with switchbacks and everything. A hut croo (one of the workers at the Lake of the Clouds) passed me carrying one of the wooden pack frames that they traditionally use to lug everything to and from the huts.The clouds began to settle in as I made my way up.   I couldn't see any rain and they weren't thunderheads, so no worry, but as I approached the summit, the visibility dropped precipitously to maybe 50 feet or so. It was cold and damp at the summit, surrealistic with people who had just driven up wandering around, wondering what to do. I had been having views all day down below, alpine moon landscape views, so I decided to move off of the top and out of the weather instead of waiting for it to clear.On the way down, there are cairns marking the trail. I could see maybe one cairn ahead and the rocky landscape of the trail didn't differ much from that off. The trail at this point parallels the cog railway. I had to climb up on it and jump down at the place the trail crosses the railway. Soon afterward, the first of the trains came up the mountain, noisy smelly loathsome things. I did not give them the thru hiker salute though.Ok, more mountains and more cutoff trails. Whoops! I found myself on the cutoff trail for Mt. Clay and instead of turning back, I decided I might as well bag it. There may always be a one mile gap left undone for me, I am not going back to do that section, I figure If you do the harder stretch...At this point, I was tiring noticeably, stumbling more, slowing down. The Gulfside Trail is rougher than Crawford Path with more boulders and sharper ones and it is difficult to maintain a rhythm. The trail partially ascends Jefferson and then Adams. Adams ilooks like someone came along with a giant dump truck and unloaded several a 400 foot tall pipe of rock. It has no solid structure. Finally, you tdescend to Madison Hut. It was only 2:00, but I was bushed. I am so grateful that they had a spot open for me and that I can do easily afford it. So here I am and I guess tonight I will get to see what Hut life is like.","Naumann tent site

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655233,"I had spent the night at Madison Hut. Thank goodness. I got two solid meals, they made me a vegetarian option of tofu, rice and coconut milk for dinner (it was turkey for everyone else). Breakfast was oatmeal, sausage (again they had vegetarian) and a blueberry coconut cake. The croo put on a skit of the Titanic with a gender swap between Jack and Rose, it was funny. I made friends, a couple who had brought their four year old and one year old up to the hut for an adventure.
The other good thing about staying at the hut was that it put a really difficult section of the trail at the start of an easy day instead of at the end of a hard day. Madison is much like Adams, a big rock pile and the AT goes over the top of it. It is 500 feet of vertical over boulders that shift under your feet. Because this was a short day, I was able to take it slow. At the top, you can see the path down, cairn after cairn and col after col until the trail disappears under tree line. I took three hours to summit Madison and make the descent to my friends, the spruces.The trail is slightly less perilous among the trees. The soil anchors the rocks. But still, it was a long way down to Osgood Tent Site. It would have been six or seven in the evening if I had to go for option two yesterday.After Osgood, the trail is more cruisy. There are brooks with and without bridges over them and then you hit Old Jackson Road. I guess it once was a road, now it is a little beat up and too narrow for vehicles, but you can go fast and I did. The horse could smell the barn, Pinkham Notch and my sweet Kate waiting for me there.
I was originally going to spend the night with Kate, then do the Wildcats and Carter, then meet her again, but instead I am going to rejigger my plans. I am taking a double zero with her, skipping the Wildcats and Carters which I will do in September.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655436,"One last time, Kate and I had some time together. Kate rented a nice Airbnb overlooking the mountains and we did a lot of Kate and Lee things for a couple of days. Kate drove me out to the Rattle River Trailhead and we said our goodbyes for the better part of a month.
The first thread of the day is about shoes. One of the reasons I took the double zero was to have time to get shoes. After only 450 miles, my Oboz Sawtooths we're done. The tread on the heel was totally gone and the tread under the ball of my foot wasn't really holding on any sort of incline. Shoes are one of the things being affected by supply chain disruptions and you can't really get what you want. I would have liked another pair of Oboz, but there's nothing close to my size available. I decided to switch to Keens. I had heard that the toe box is big and for me that is a good thing. Righty's fourth and fifth toe we're always getting pinched in the Oboz even though they are wide. I like the low tops because they are less restrictive and like no waterproofing because your feet breathe easier and the shoes dry out faster when they get wet. Unfortunately, again, REI had nothing close to my size, so I have gone with mid length Keens. They are pretty solid shoes, some would say ""foot coffins"", but that is what an old guy needs. Righty and Lefty are negotiating with them right now. I have tried some creative lacing techniques to get the lower part tied down tight while leaving the ankle a little loose (the ankle was biting on Righty). They did great today. I had a lot of confidence in their traction and a lot of stuff that would have been hand over hand with the Oboz I could manage with just the poles with the Keens. So all good so far, I may put on my sandals when I Ford streams, though.So a beautiful day. It started out almost cloudless and at this point, it is about half and half. The trail started out (after the goodbye hugs) with a road walk. You have to cross the Rattle River at a hydro plant, then down a dirt road and then into the woods.This was a day with over 4000 feet of elevation, but at least it was a civilized 4000 feet. Rocks stayed where they were and the climbs were never that bad, with a dry trail and sections with steps.  You do start out with a big climb and then there are a lot of ups and downs. One nice thing about the day was that it was flat open granite at the top of every up today with great partial views south and west. The tops all had as many ripe blueberries as you cared to eat and small lichen gardens, the kind that is all bushy and the lightest shade of pastel green.There had been a fire in the spring that resulted in a temporary closure. You could see the burn on the understory, but it seems like all the trees, except in one spot, survived. There are blueberry bushes in the burnt spots already.This stretch of the trail is a little dry with few water sources. About halfway through the day, I came on my first. Somebody had placed a leaf strategically to make a funnel, with a rock to keep it in place. Unfortunately, the drip off the leaf wasn't much more than from a leaky faucet, but it was enough to fill a small pool underneath. I use a 20 ounce plastic ginger ale bottle to scoop water. I find that it can get just about anything and it did.There were some really nice ponds towards the end of the day. I stopped for a long while at the first one. A warm granite slab extended out from the bank and I just laid down, enjoying that warmth and the relief of the pack of my back. I looked to my left and there was a frog, still except for its throat where you could see it breathing. I looked at my feet and there was another one. Thin blue damsel flies and big fat blue dragonflies hunted, darting over the water. I could have just stayed there forever.I did get up, walked past two more ponds and am now at Lower Gentian Pond where there is a shelter and a view of the Carter range I think.

As I was leaving, the fog was settling in the valley below, covering the town of Gorham and the orange early morning light illuminated the greens of the last of the White Mountains.I spent the day leapfrogging with two really nice people my age, Rude and Legz.

I think Goose Eye must be named so because one rock outcropping at the top looks kind of roundish and eyeish. Anyway, Goose Eye has three peaks and the AT visits all of them. This may have been my first view of what lies ahead, there are some big mountains yet to be climbed. The other thing that Goose Eye has is blueberry bogs. There is a big one between the second and third peak with as many ripe blueberries as you may care to have.

I was ready to go at 6:00, looked at the conditions and decided that an extra hour might dry off the rocks some. That was a good decision, but not in the way you might think. That timed things out so I was leaving at the same time as Rude and Legz who hike at about my pace. It meant that I had compatriots on my adventure and that turned out to be the best part of it all. Rude and Legz have a back and forth banter. Rude will say the first few words of a song and Legz will start singing it. Rude grunts and groans in a good natured way at the obstacles and Legz calls out ""Carry me Wilbur"" in Mr. Ed's voice when she hits a rough patch.So, from the shelter to the notch is that ""different kind of rough"" that I see characterizes Maine. Big steed declined of smooth rock or hand over hand puzzles was the way we got down to the Notch. It started out innocently enough, nice dirt path.That lasted about 100 feet.Then we were into it. The SOBOs we're complaining that it is not well blazed, but I think the blazes are designed for people going North. There are blazes on the best routes through and arrows pointing to what you have to do but never would have considered on your own. Legz does not like caves or tight fits, so she took the over routes which are tougher, but she, truthfully, is more capable than us boys. Rude and I took off our packs no less than four times handing them through the tiny crevices we had to crawl through. If you were looking at your Garmin, you might have wondered why it took us three hours to traverse one mile of level ground. You Tube it if you want to see why.The Notch has its pleasures. The cliffs are dramatic. It is wet so there is moss everywhere and it is very lushly beautiful. The climate is interesting. You can find patches of ice in the deeper caves and the clammy coldness wafts up even on a hot day, but you will suddenly hit patches of hot moist air too.After navigating Mahoosuc Notch, we went up the Arm. This is an ascent of over 1000 feet in a mile, I believe. I let Rude and Legz go, they are faster than me, but I met them at the top having snacks and celebrating their triumph.Sadly, they have a motel stay tonight and have gone a bit ahead of me for that. I bade them farewell with some mutual affection. Today was a great bonding experience with two people I really like. My own plan was to make it a little longer day than if I were to stay in a shelter. I am doing this thing called stealth camping for the first time. It is a misnomer, I am set up right next to the trail, nothing stealth about it but that is what I learned is done after asking around. It will be a quiet night, a cool one up here on the mountain, but I can go to bed at my own hiker's midnight and wake up when I want without disturbing anyone. No one snoring or shifting on a crinkly noisy blow up pad too. I am up in the firs, windy late afternoon and everything is good.","Full Goose Shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655606,"I never expected that today would turn out this good. On the schedule, it was going to be a 14 mile grind, ending in some patch of dirt by the side of the road. I needed the 14 miles to set me up to take the 4:00 shuttle into the Human Nature Hostel tomorrow and the day was organized to make that doable.It started out up on Old Speck Mountain. Being that high up was refreshing, a stiff breeze and temperatures low enough to get a cold night sleep that justified bringing a sleeping bag. I woke up before dawn, the clouds were blue against the orange pre-dawn sky. By the time I had eaten breakfast and packed up, the sun had risen.Today's hike could be broken into three pieces, a cruisy, easy descent to Grafton Notch, the climb up Baldpate and a final cruisy section to my campsite. I will skip the easy sections, for those, I am walking fast with my head down looking for roots and rocks. The highlight was Baldpate.All the trail north of Grafton Notch is maintained by the Maine Appalachian Trail Club and there is a noticeable difference once you cross the road. The climb up Baldpate was stone stairs, little stone stairs that you might take two at a time. That was a lot of work to do. I went into the Baldpate Lean-to campsite to get water and there were some volunteers there, patching the shelter on their Saturday (btw, there were a lot of day hikers out today making their way up Old Speck, that is how you can tell it is Saturday). The climb up the West Baldpate peak is unremarkable other than the stairs, you are in fir or spruce the whole way up. It had me wondering, why did they call a mountain totally covered by trees Baldpate. I found the answer just after I summited. There was the day's first view, there was the other summit and it was all exposed granite.You go down East Baldpate and you are in another alpine bog. In Vermont, these ridges would be all spruce, but here, it is blueberry and other bog plants and a view. Maine is amazing. There are lakes so big I can't believe I don't know the name of them and so many mountains in every direction.The climb up East Baldpate is totally exposed, with cairns telling you where to climb. Unlike some other Maine mountains so far, this one is totally doable, especially because today the rock was dry. The day was ominous and windy, with a cloud ceiling of maybe only 6000 feet, so the views were dramatic.I am now set up at the most lovely spot. There is a small waterfall cascading into a pool of the clearest, coldest water and I am about to eat dinner. I am hungry so I am going to cut this short and chow down.","Old Speck

Two hikers who were camped near me last night, Ketchup and Scramble are going with me to the hostel, two more, Sunshine and Daisy will meet us there. We are headed for Human Nature Hostel which is this giant geodesic dome hostel Most of the day was an easy cruise. The trail goes past Surplus Pond which is a beaver pond, very pretty. Scramble and Ketchup wanted there to be a moose in it, but no dice, no moose. We went past a patch of conifer forest where the understory was neverending moss, three kinds. One kind is light green and almost leafy. The second is spiky and darker green and the third is that smooth dark green moss that grows on your lawn. There were some views, there was a lake below with the morning mist covering it and a small round rock and pine island in the middle. It looked like a wizard's lair in some fantasy movie.I had started at 6:00 and by 11:00 I had reached a sign that said I had 2.7 miles to go. I thought I was pretty much done, but Moody Mountain was in the way. It was a relentless climb, but the MATC which manages the trail has a different idea of ""doable"" than the AMC and there were rebar ladders and steps in areas the ATC would leave you to your own devices.I have a bit of time here by the side of the road so I figured I would give you a description of me breaking camp in the morning. I wake up at 4:45 generally and the first thing I do is put on my socks. I have injinji sock liners, there is one toe on the sock for each one of yours and that keeps your toes from rubbing against each other and getting blisters. It takes a while to put them on. Then the regular socks, then my pants, then my shoes. The next step is food. My bear bag is either in a bear box which is usually a repurposed industrial toolbox with latches that only creatures with thumbs can open or it is  hanging from a tree in a bear hang, hopefully high enough off of the ground for the bears not to get it. You can Google ""PCT hang"" if you want the details. Anyway, I do what I have to to fetch it. I take out my toothbrush, my toothpaste, dental floss and a quart freezer bag that has three or four packets of oatmeal in it as well as an instant coffee. I also get out my peanut butter. Nothing has more calories per pound than peanut butter, so I always add a big scoop to my oatmeal. I get out my camp stove which is a little doodad that weighs a couple ounces and screw it onto a fuel canister, put a pot on top of it with some water in it and light the stove with a Bic lighter. The pot comes with a little cup, so I put the instant coffee in there. When the water boils, I pour half into the bag and half into the coffee cup and that is breakfast. Afterwards, the toothbrush and all are sitting there so I use them. The quart bag and toothbrush go back in the bear bag and I put the camp stove together. Then, it is back into the tent. My sleeping bag and sleeping clothes go in a waterproof compression sack. You pull on these four straps until all the air goes out of your stuff, it saves a lot of space. The compression sack is the first thing to go in the pack followed by my blow up pillow, a bag with bandaids, nail clippers and such, a bag with electronics and a bag with my paper notebook and pen, then the camp stove, my flip flops and raincoat. Then the food bag goes in and I can close the top. I take my sleeping pad out of the tent and strap it to the pack and then disassemble my tent. First I remove the rain fly, then unhook the outside of the tent from the poles that give it form, then fold up the poles and put them in their bag. Then I fold the tent in half, put the rain fly on top and roll the whole thing up and put it in it's bag. I put the two tent bags in a pocket on the side of my pack, turn my Garmin on and I am off. Don't forget the trekking poles!","Stealth site near mile 1938

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655702,"First of all, let me tell you about the Human Nature Hostel and the guy who runs it, White Owl. He is a former Marine who did the trail in 2012 and, while on the trail, had the vision of starting a hostel in Maine in a round building. He researched a bit and found that you could build a geodesic domed structure from a kit, a large one in his case, the hostel must be about 40 feet in diameter and he says it has 3000 square feet of space. Everything that White Owl does is intentional, he really puts a lot of effort and thought into every aspect, sonically, olfactory, the physical layout and appearance and this once-marine has created a space of peace and tranquility. Maybe it sounds new agey to you, but if you come to it with the right attitude, you will find it's healing powers.
Ok, the hike today started late with the shuttle to the AT at 8:30. Old Blue is the next mountain. The day before, I was looking at it. There is a cliff outcropping at the top and the rest of it doesn't look much better. The path up is doable, but relentless and it lands you on top of a tableland that supports today's peaks. Again, some ridge walking to get to the mountain, in spruce and moss forest, then up to the top of Old Blue which is at 3600 feet. That is about the same as the highest we went in Massachusetts and in Vermont too, but in Maine, it is just today's mountain, or one of them. There are partial views west and south.After Old Blue, you descend a bit to a ridge that makes for easy walking and then get to Bemis Mountain which at 3590 feet is just a bit lower. There is no view on Bemis, but just after the peak, things open up to an alpine environment. You know what that means, blueberries and views. The views in this area are amazing. Lake Fallstaff (I think) is spread out in front of you as far as you can see and there are mountains to be climbed to the north.The late day meant that I would run out of time before reaching my stretch goal, Sabbath Day Pond. I could see the pond from Bemis, you get good at judging distances and it was about 7 miles away. It had been a long day, so I called it quits near Bemis Brook. Tomorrow should be a short day mileage wise so I am not worried about making up the three miles I have left.","South Arm Rd

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655759,"So folks, I am having a little problem with my right ankle and it will benefit from a little rest. I planned out a short four mile walk over easy terrain to the shelter at Sabbath Day Lake so I might rest it for most of a day and see if it is better tomorrow.
This is a large lake, there is a red cottage on the lakeside and there is the shelter. Somewhere out there, a loon is calling. I was able to make it here pretty much OK. There is a small climb to Route 17 where there is a scenic view pull off just where the AT crosses the road. You can see all the lakes that surround Rangely, I am sure all the vacationers in the area have many adventures on them. It looks idyllic, a healthy and uniquely Maine experience to be up here.The plan for tomorrow is to do the eight miles to Route 4 and reassess at that point. If things feel good, them I can resupply and continue on. If not, I will ask at the hostel for advice on getting to Augusta and get myself home.The place where I am is so good and so important. This is where your fresh air comes from. The trees give so much to us and the air from your west is their gift to you. I have been breathing this air for 500 miles. It sustains me and heals me and it smells so good. Hopefully I have another 250 miles in me, if not, I am coming home.","Mile 1960

I am missing the mobility I need for the mountains ahead the next 50 miles and Katahdin. It is like Michael Jordan without his ups, he is just not Michael Jordan if he can't dunk. I feel that there may be obstacles I can't tackle without Righty being able to push off correctly. Kate is coming to pick me up. She is so selfless.
Today was a good day. They say, ""don't end your hike on a bad day"" and I didn't. The nine miles between Sabbath Day Lake and Rte 4 we're thankfully easy ones. There are two ponds on the way, the first one has canoes that you can take out. The second one had canoes but it looked like they were locked up. Pretty good trick, to get canoes portaged in like that. There was a single loon on the last pond.I said a lot of goodbyes to my constant friends of the last six weeks. There are the spruces and firs, the frogs and toads, the bunch berries (the ones with the four stubby leaves and orange berries) and the ones with the dark blue berries and shiny long leaves. There were a lot of blueberries today, ripe ones. I passed most of them by, there is a metaphor in there but I will leave it up to you all to think of what it is.Three pieces of wisdom. First, the human animal, being bipedal had to make a choice between walking up stuff or down. Four legged animals, the front legs are good at picking their way down things and cushioning the impact of descent. The back legs are good for powering their way up and the tilt of the hind feet lets them rest flat on an upwardly inclined surface. Humans however only have the hind legs. We are only built for going up and are really bad, sore knees bad, fall on your face bad at going down. My wisdom would be to learn how to go down backwards. It worked really well until it didn't. Spinning around after walking down backwards, I tripped and that is how I hurt the ankle.The second piece of wisdom follows a saying I once heard that goes something like this: ""No cow has ever seen the moon"". One of the things about hiking is that it is absolutely necessary for you to look ten or fifteen feet in front of you at the ground at all times, at least on the rooty and rocky AT. So like a cow, face permanently down, you never see the moon. I am certainly not saying you should look up when you walk or even that you should stop a lot. It is just a part of life that by the nature of what you have to do, there are things, worthwhile ones, that you will miss.Third piece of wisdom. The human animal has instincts and one among them is an innate ability to recognize beauty. The instinct of beauty is how we come to know what is good. When you hear the musical sound of a young woman talking or see the handsome grace of a young man diving off of a precipice, you see them as beautiful and you know the goodness of them through that. The same goes for nature. If you see a frog or a tree or a pond or a mountain and find it beautiful, you are instinctively connecting with the goodness in it and recognize that it is something worthwhile. I experienced so much beauty the last few weeks. It was so wonderful being immersed in it and it is important that I communicate this to you so you will also value what we have here.",,View Entry,"Aug 03, Wed",0
