Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583098,"Good news yesterday!! In getting ready for my hike, I have been having some knee pain.  The doctor thought maybe a torn meniscus.  One MRI later, and I am cleared for PT!  No tears, just some cartilage damage/irritation under my knee cap.  So I am going to see the Physical Therapist on Thursday and find out what I can do to get back to training.  Good thing I have some time.  It looks like a slow start for me.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Thu",0

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585915,"Spring break with my kids was this week.  We had an amazing hike outside of Chattanooga.  It was on the Lula Lake trail.  Nice elevation changes and a beautiful waterfall at the end.  Even a fun rappel down a steep slope to the falls.  Way more than we bargained for, but my knee held up well.  It was abound 4.5 miles. Then we moved on to Bland, Virginia and caught a small section of the AT!  We found it at what we thought was a trail head, but really was just a road crossing.  I was just so excited.  My first white blaze.  The day was amazing and I could have hiked forever, but the girls were only up for 1 mile in and 1 mile out.  That's o.k.  It just steeled my resolve.  I slept poorly last night with visions of new exercise in my head to get me out hiking strong again. I'm loving watching videos and reading journals of the people out this year.  It has been a real challenge with the weather for the early starters.  I came home to more snow in the forecast.  I hope it warms up soon for everyone!",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Mon",0
Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587109,"Today I worked 12 hours with NO knee pain!  After a really tough week with physical therapy last week, yesterday was the first day I thought my knee might get better!Today I worked with no KT tape.  12 hours, no pain.  It was amazing.  I frond some great things to add to my PT homework, from a running channel.  Totally fit my problem.  So I've been working like a lunatic.  It seems to be working!  I'm not even crunching as much as I was.  I hiked 5 miles with 20 pounds the other day and I made it about 3.5 before my knee started talking to me.  I was pretty happy.  Now, as good as I feel, I'm thinking I will hike Thursday and try for 6 miles.  I'm going slow so I don't backslide.  Oh! I also think my new shoes are helping.  I got some Brooks cascadia 12.  They fit my feet as if they were made for me.  I can't even begin to explain how nice they are.  This is going to happen!I am just praying the weather improves for everyone soon!I'll add some hiking pictures as I try some new trails.  Good luck to,the class of 2018!Shelly",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Fri",0

Every time I'm in the shower, I stop just an extra second, to think how nice running water is 😂
My prep table looks about how I feel! Crazy and disorganized!! I know once I start I'll feel better.  I've read walking in the forest is a nature bath for the soul.  I kind of like that thought 😊

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647206,"The adventure has begun!  I have walked 50 miles!  The longest continuous hike I have completed so far.  I was lucky enough to have my sweetie with me for the first bit, from Amicalola to Neels Gap.  We started at the Lodge at Amicalola State Park.  It's a great place to stay and am iconic start to the trip.  I met Shelby, my first thru hiker! I was nervous and excited!! 
We attended the hiker orientation and I got my hang tag!!! It is Magenta this year so it's super visible.  I'm number 416.  I feel like I'm a little ahead of the crowd.  We went to the Hike Inn and had a truly wonderful start to this adventure.  It's a great place for a reset.  
Our first days were unseasonably warm. Nothing like I prepared for.  Misty or light rain in the morning followed by sunny afternoons.  We only had one day of real rain and we were coming to town so it didn't really matter.  Blood Mountain at an elevation over 4000 feet, in the rain,  challenged our goal of finding a positive spin on every situation.  But they're was no ice!
When Paul left at Neels Gap, it was pretty awful... Sorry Tori!!! You got all my tears!  It would have been so much easier, if I didn't like him so darn much!
I was blessed with amazing weather the first few days, by myself, which really helped.  Great music has been a huge help on hard up hills.  And I like hiking by myself, so I can sing out loud, or dance like a fool.  
The people out here are truly amazing.  I have met great people every night at shelters or tent sites.  I have had""trail magic"" just when I needed it most and have been able to help others along the way. People really just set up on the side of the road to give you stuff!! And trust you to uphold the honor system!  
The whole world needs to be this way!! Humanity is amazing...
See you down the trail😊","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647537,"Gorgeous views, a new state and amazing people have marked this past section of trail!
Things I knew I would like- gorgeous views!, Great people!, My tent and fresh air.
Things I knew I wouldn't like-shelters, No running water, how I smell with no shower after several days 😂
Surprises-I don't mind privies if I have hand sanitizer to wipe things down with, I'm still not hungry, I sleep great.
Injuries- 0
Things I've lost- One tent stake and one trowel.
This section has been all about learning to go with the flow. I have had to make changes to plans a couple of times which made me crabby. But each time something good has come of it. If I hadn't been open to the changes, I would have missed some really neat things and people.
A wise woman told me recently ""We can do hard things!""
This is one of the hardest things I've ever done and it is truly amazing!","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648703,"The Nantahala Outdoor Center... It looked hard, but I had no idea!
I had a lovely evening off ( a NERO day) that started with lunch with some trail friends and a Jameson toast to my friend Mark, on St. Patrick's Day.  Probably the best chicken sandwich I have ever eaten as well!  I stayed at Gorgeous Stays hostel and had a fun evening chatting with fellow hikers and then a fire with my neighbors and their little people.  Now I have new friends following my hike!! Even taking about it at preschool:)
The hike out of the N.O.C. was everything I heard and more.  The climb was straight up and the terrain was awful. Trail maintenance was awful here. Tons of trees across the trail that you didn't fit under, couldn't get over, and had no way to get around! Loose rocks, slippery mud, and a thunderstorm while ridge walking.  I also had some foot pain that was a first for me.  Luckily, the evening thunderstorm never happened and I met more great people at the shelter.  The next day I was still beat and I hit a low spot. Lots more climbing and more foot pain made me one sad hiker.  
I have found that the bad days don't last! I woke up the next day and felt so much better! Hiked farther and had more energy.  Faster recovery must mean I'm getting stronger!  
I finished this stretch with a full day off to really rest up before heading into the Smoky Mountains.  I enjoyed another hostel and tried to figure out the lightest food I could for 8 days in the mountains.  The next section was what I worried about for 4 years...","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655852,"I hit a low point! My right ankle is swollen on the top now! Maybe it's how I taped it.  It makes my foot hurt enough, I'm not really sure I can do this. I got into camp and set up my tent and I was just sitting there worrying. There was an 18 mile bear closure, where no camping is allowed, in my book. I knew I couldn't hike 18 miles. In walked Christian. We met around Easter and this was the first I had seen him since. He had a different book... No bear closure. He was just unflappable.  ""Damascus Virginia is 60 miles away. We just need to hike 12 miles a day for 5 days and we'll be there,!"". So started my time with a good friend.  We didn't really plan to hike together. But we kind of made a goal of the same places. I stopped a lot to soak my ankle. Christian very rarely stopped, but he hiked really slow. So we ended up at the same place! The last couple days in, we hiked together. He reminds me of a cross between my grandpa and Paul. Quiet, determined, positive... it took him a while to talk, but the longer we were together, the more he did. But low and behold, we made it to Damascus.The trail took us up some steep climbs and we had very little water. The temperature did a180 and we went from 25 to 90.  It was awful! The worst part was we could see water, but we couldn't get to it!! It was beautiful in the canyon and we were in pine trees.  So lots of nice soft needles on the ground.  It is always nice when the scenery changes!  I spend a lot of time thinking of how to make my pack lighter and how to make my foot feel better. I made an appointment with the doctor for when I go home.  I'm really hoping it improves. It feels like the entire focus of my hike right now it overshadows so much!!","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651731,"The Great Smokey Mountains National Park was what drove must of my prep for this trip.  Everyone wondered what I was afraid of. Bears? Snakes? Crazy people? Not really.  I was afraid of freezing to death in the Smokey's! They are notorious for having their own weather systems. Between the elevation and the mountains themselves, the weather can change in a dime. 
I got lucky! It was cold, but dry. Which made staying warm sooo much easier! Everything I prepared,  worked and I was pretty comfortable the whole time! We had some nights in the 20's! When I was on Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT, the wind chill was -10.  I did not stay long!
The views were amazing. We saw some very different trail here. Red Rocks, hemlock forests, and ice! I was a little lonely for the first time at the beginning of this section.  I just had a few days where I was super tired and people didn't really want to talk in the evening.  Thankfully it didn't last long.  I met more nice people and saw them over and over at the shelters.
The rules for camping and the shelter placement made for some really long days and some really short days for me.  We had to camp in the shelter areas. No dispersed camping was allowed.  It took me 8 days to get through! This was my longest stretch with no shower and no resupply.  
The cold had caused me to use a lot of fuel and battery power, so I did come down to New Found Gap and go into Gatlinburg for a few hours.  Some people took a day off here.  But Paul was meeting me at the end of the Smokey's, so I didn't. New Found Gap was fun and a little overwhelming.  It is a beautiful spot you can drive to during a visit to the Smokey's.  So the parking lot was FULL of people.  So many people wanted to help hikers with trail magic. Muffins, fruit, pop, sandwiches, rides into town, all kinds of things! It always amazes m me that there is a whole community that just wants to support us crazy hikers!
The trail in this section was difficult to hike. It was often a deep trough. The trail maintenances was not good, with lots of trees blocking the trail, and with the placement of the shelter dictating how far you could go in a day, I was happy when I finished this section.
I ended with a lovely afternoon at Standing Bear Hostel.  Paul picked me up for a much needed shower and a few days off.  The hostel had a really nice atmosphere.  Very laid back.  There were several hikers there to chat with and frozen pizza! I got to rinse off in the creek and lay in the sun.  After being so cold for so long, 75 and sunny felt amazing!","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655592,"I hiked out of Uncle Johnny's hostel in Erwin, TN.  I had to stay long enough to try a local Pal's burger.  I nice lady saved me from the, drive thru only, line and got my food for me. It reminded me of the Chick Filet line back home.  She really worried I would get run over! :) The burger was good but the soda was better. It is their own and it is like a mix of ginger ale and sprite. Very refreshing!  When we come down into town, it's warm like spring. But it is still cold up in the mountains.  I got to hike through some beautiful balds. A couple were socked in with fog and drizzle. But the ones I went over that were clear were incredible.  You can see for miles in all directions. They have all been windy and super steep climbing which makes them hard.  My ankle and foot have been bothering me quite a bit, so it's hard sometimes to really appreciate the views.  But I try to sit and take it in once I get to the top.I climbed over Roan mountain and passed the highest shelter in the AT. I met a guy named Come Along on the way up.  He hiked with me all the way to the top even though he could have zoomed ahead.  It was nice to chat with him and take my mind off the climb.   I broke my trying pole coming down and had to use a stick! We made them climb in the rain and we knew it was supposed to be windy and cold so we came over the mountain and down to a shelter at lower elevation.  It didn't help much. The temp dropped to 25 and the wind was sustained in the 40's with guests up to 50mph.  It really put my tent to the test.  The extra guy lines and trekking pole support worked just like they were supposed to!! I woke up to everything frozen solid. I had to blow in my tent pole connections to get them apart! So it was a show start for me.  I made my way down to Station 19 and it was so nice to be warm again! The hostel had burgers and beer and line dancing. It was Great! I stayed down there road at Mountain Harbor hostel in the b&b section, because they had a tub.  Trying to soak my ankle and make it feel better. I had some k tape and braces sent. Hopefully that helps!","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652593,"We made it to 500!!! I've been really enjoying my time hiking with Christian.  He is determined and steady and positive! Not fast at all, but perfect for me to follow.  I'm not much faster and by the end of the day, when my ankle is sore, he outpaces me with no trouble.  
He is full of stories and love for his wife and family.  It's been great! He pushes me to keep at 12+ miles and if I take my time, I can get there.  Sometimes we come in late to where we are staying, but we've finished our miles.  I thought that when I left Damascus, I wouldn't see him again for a while, but he ended up at the same shelter and decided the mileage to Marion worked for him and we are together again!
We had more climbing! Up out of Damascus and into Grayson Highlands.  The rain held off and we did great! Lots of boulder scrambles, which are fun and tiring. Mount Rogers was supposed to be our big climb, but White Top mountain was much steeper and made Mount Rogers feel like nothing!  
We had an exciting encounter with our first highland wild pony and enjoyed the rest from a distance.  
We hit a big milestone of 500 miles!! Almost a quarter done.  And had great views to celebrate!!  
After a great zero day in Marion, celebrating my amazing daughter and her doctoral achievement (thanks to zoom), we are back to hiking!

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654950,"Such a great section! I really enjoyed my visit to the Grayson Highlands.  The views are stunning, the rocks here are usually fun boulder scrambles and the wild ponies are so cool!! We had to hurry through the end to get out of a storm.  But Paul came for a visit and we got to come back as tourists and look around with no packs.  We saw ALL the ponies then!
I had a town stop in Marion Virginia so that I could watch Anaya get her white coat in her professional ceremony (thank you zoom). It was a pretty nice town.  They definitely had a great Quality Inn.
Christian and I hiked together until Atkins, Virginia.  We had some long sections with no water and were saved with trail magic! Burgers and sodas and water.  We came into town on Cinco de Mayo.  The hike was through beautiful forest with pine needle paths, then meadows.  We went faster than ever! Finishing with dinner at a Mexican restaurant😊 this is where Paul met me for our hike.  I said goodbye to my friend.  It was hard and sad.  I'll miss him.  Christian was out in my path for a reason.  He helped me when I needed it most.  I hope to catch him again down the trail!
Paul and I had a great visit.  He was determined to hike with me and we over did it his first day. But we scaled back for the rest and had more fun.  We still hiked 11,000 get of climbing in the for days he was here! I only cried on him once!  It was a tough day and I was figuring out my visit home, which was stressful to plan.  In the end, I drove home with him which was much more fun than driving alone.  It was so nice to see my family!
I started with my Great nephew, Isaacs birthday and ended with my niece Amanda's wedding to her love, Bean.

So i can't complain much.  Amy and Paul, friends from home came and braved the flooding. We were all amazed when we're found each other in the middle of the woods! It plan actually worked! They were great sports and we had fun! We hiked 9 miles through lots of water. Knee high in some spots! Luckily it was actually not raining when we were hiking and camping.  
I had a few kinks to work out after being home for almost 2 weeks.  Everything was sore and the rain continued for 4 days.  I came into Pearisburg soaking wet and happy to get a hotel room! I didn't even mind the big climb down into Town😊
It was strange coming back and having all new people around me. Hopefully this is another chance to meet nice people!","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654991,"I'm in a stretch of camp sites and no shelters.  I am missing people.  I came back out here determined to hike 15 miles a day.  I have been doing that, but it puts me at odd points and not at shelters.  Today I had lunch at a shelter and some section hikers were there.  So that was nice.  They had a really great dog too! Always a bonus.  This section it of Pearisburg has some big climbs, which makes me slow. So I got in very late one night.  I put me tent up in the dark and was trying to be quiet, when I heard a little toddler just giggling his head off in the next tent.  It was a nice way to end the day.
Memorial Day was at the end of this stretch. I made it to the Memorial market of a much decorated veteran who died in a plane crash on the trail years ago. He was a huge love of the trail and his family made a memorial for him near the crash site.  It is a beautiful area and a very fitting spot for the day! 
In the evening I had trail magic, food and cold drinks.  I also got to meet the giggling toddler! There is a family thru hiking with them 2 year old.  I camped with them near a creek! They are very sweet.  I also met 2 other hikers who stayed there.  I found more people!! 
One bummer, I dumped my phone and my headphones including the charging case in the river.  The phone is waterproof, so it was ok.  But there headphones are not.  Fingers crossed they will still work when they dry out.  They have been a huge help on the hard days.

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654994,"I found all the hikers!!! Around the Virginia Triple Crown, there are restrictions on where you can camp, so I had an unexpected trip to the Four Pines hostel. So did lots of other people! 
The first part of the triple crown is The Dragons Tooth.  It is a rock formation that you can climb.  The hike up to it was lovely! Very much like walking in a park.  Wide paths that are well shaded. There was some elevation gain, but not super steep.  The Dragons tooth was cool.  I did not climb to the top.  I could appreciate the view from half way up! The climb down from Dragons Tooth, however, was scary! Butt scooting, climbing down narrow ridges, rebar placed into the rock to help in one super steep spot.  Some hikers took their packs off to make their decent.  
It was nice to have other people to decompress with! I also found out that there was a tragedy at MacAfees knob.  A young man fell from there edge of a cliff near the knob.  Sadly he did not survive.  
I came into the day worried.  Paul was nervous for me at home.  As I hiked up, I could not understand what happened.  This whole section was probably the safest area we have hiked.  Other than horrible heat, risking heat exhaustion, it was not dangerous.  It made me even more sad.  The view is amazing and I got wonderful pictures.  But it was definitely overshadowed.
The triple crown's final section was Tinkers Cliffs.  It was beautiful as well and the lovely hiking continued.  Lots of nice new people and shelter hopping again finally! Hoping for a drop in the humidity to help with the heat.  It has been super hot.","

Shelly L.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654990,"I'm 3 miles from 1300, but it's close enough!  The last 100 miles+ have been the most mentally challenging for me.  The rocks of Pennsylvania have made it impossible to plan any mileage.  I have had to try really hard to let go of my expectations and take each day as it comes.  Many days I have only been able to go 10 miles.  It's hard when I was finally making big progress to feel so held back.  My feet simply can only take so much.  Thank goodness for the rock plate in my Brooks Cascadia trail running shoes!! It has literally saved my feet.  I continue to hike alone.  I have met so many nice people.  Talking to people at the end of the day, when I get to the shelter, keeps me connected and having fun.  I have not even been able to go to shelters through here, because my mileage had just not matched up. Add that to the fact that there are simply less people on the trail now and it has made for a lonely stretch.  Lucky for me Chris and Mel came and cheered me up last weekend! It was a great visit and we enjoyed the little town of Jim Thorpe. We had some amazing food and some time to chill on the beach.  They listened to me worry about my first big climb and gave me lots of encouragement as they dropped me back on trail.  I conquered the climb out of Palmerton!!! It was the first real rock climbing section.  I had to put my poles away and use all my mental energy to conquer my fear of heights.  I was blessed to have a family climbing in front of me and one behind as well, so I wasn't alone.  It's the first but not the last!! It's good to have one done. I leave Pennsylvania in 1 mile.  I've never been so glad to see a state done.   Really looking forward to New Jersey!","

One walked right into camp when we were eating dinner.  I pitched my tent in the ridge above the shelter and now there is one outside my door! I stayed at Cornelius Creek shelter and met some nice section hikers. 2 ladies who are staying at the hostel with me in Glasgow. There is a young guy named Brody, who just started with his old scout master (Ryan)  Brody just graduated from high school and is starting in the middle of Ryan's hike.  They are trying to do 15 miles a day right away! I hope he does ok.When I got to Glasgow, I was very pleasantly surprised. Charlie is a further they hiker who runs the hostel. He's funny and kind and almost military in his organization! We have a free dessert with our stay and it turns out that is his planning session for shuttling people out the next day! He also made us blueberry pancakes! This is a super little town. There is one restaurant, one store and one hostel. But they all have everything you need! The store owner had completely catered to thru hikers. He even approached me while I was shopping to ask about things people are eating and why they like them. He's owned the place for 25 years and he just keeps changing for us! It was an awesome stay. Because Charlie ran such a tight ship, I had my first 20 mile day! I got on trail at 7:30! And found some people who were fun to hike with and we just went!! The trail was gorgeous. Only a couple climbs, and lots of trail you could really fly on.

We had dinner and caught up in town.  We went to the movies on my zero day and resupplied. And finished with a nice dinner to to it off! They had to head out to get Brenden to work, so I got an Uber back to trail.

But we got into Deli territory!! I left with 4 days of food and managed to make it 8 days because of all the real food! New Jersey was short, only 72 miles, then on to New York.New York was a big surprise.  Lots of bouldering and big climbs.  I never looked ahead, so I didn't know it was coming.  It was still hot, but now,  no water.  Thank goodness the deli blazing continued. I got most of my water from caches people left, or storesv and restaurants.  It made the days feel long.  I stealth camped through this whole section.  The miles just never added up to staying in shelters.

He came to the deli if the day with me and bought my lunch!! We hiked the next big climb and he made the time fly by. We were solving the problems of the world:). The best kind of trail magic.  I'll be happy to follow his adventures.While every day felt like it took forever, by the time Paul came for his visit, I had somehow made it 100 miles.  New Jersey is so far my favorite state.
