BackScratcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647048,"I had been planning on hiking with my baby girl Rain, she is a ridge less Rhodesian. But a purebred Rhodesian Ridgeback.I knew from my research that there was 3 places that she would not be allowed to hike with me.  Those being Baxter Sate Park, where Katahdin is located,  The Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Bear Mountain Zoo in New York.  Other than those places she was free to accompany me.  Well, I certainly did not have any idea what I was getting her & I into until the day the I climbed and summited Katahdin.  I had no idea that rock scrambles meant that I would have to be climbing and pulling myself up 5'- 6' high rocks.  I thought that these areas where just another name for scree fields.  Boy, was I wrong! After my summit of Katahdin I decided that I needed to return home to reevaluate the thru hike.  This actually ended up being a good choice, due to all the terrible weather that the New England and Northeast state in general experienced that summer and fall.  I was heart broken and very disappointed in myself.And have only recently realized that it was the BEST DECISION to not continue my 2021 hike.  I am in a much better place mentally today than I was then.  A lot of the bad mental shape last year had to do with the injury and long recovery, 6+ months for the broken ankle.  I went back to work inside the post office since I was not released to carry mail on the street and ended up coming down with COVID after being there for 3 days.  I ended up sick with COVID for 3 weeks.  Then dealt with the fatigue and lingering respiratory problems for the next 8 months.  In addition to that my mother had her 2nd stroke on June 3rd, 2021, which also happened to be my 32nd wedding anniversary.  Add to that the strict hospital COVID visiting policies, and the fact that I was in the middle of final prep for my trip I was about to have a major nervous breakdown.  My mom is doing well.  She has been really lucky with the 2 strokes that she has had.  She has not lost any mobility or had to much effect of her speech or cognitive abilities.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Wed",0
BackScratcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647049,"I have decided that I would keep my start date a secret from my Facebook followers until after I have been on the trail for about a week.  You are probably wondering why would you do that.  Well, I have learned that I tend to do much better at following through with something that is not made into a big production.  I like to keep my life low key. And I truly believe that I ended up putting a lot more pressure on myself, trying to live up to what I believe that others expected of me instead of what I was capable of at the moment in time.So with a clean slate I am anxious to start my new adventure on 3-12-2022 at Pen Mar Park, located near the MD/PA line in Maryland and then going south to Georgia.  I have only given my start date and time to a handful of family & friends.This journal is going to be my link to my family, friends & acquaintances that are unable to follow me on Facebook for whatever reason.  I have also registered with Ramdino on his YouTube channel so that there is another avenue available for those wanting to follow my adventure they can.  I will not be doing a YouTube video channel myself.  That is way too much work.  I just want to enjoy the journey.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Wed",0
BackScratcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647050,"Last year when I started, I was using the name that one of my postal customers gave me.  When I was talking to her about trail names and mentioned that I did not have one. She immediately told me that it should naturally be ""The Mail Lady & Rain"".  And so it was.I have recently decided that that persona no longer fits me.  One evening while getting ready for bed, my new trail name became obvious.  I have a ritual of using a backscratcher to scratch my back every night prior to actually going to bed.  And knew that it was one of my must have luxury items from home that I would be taking with me on the trail.  I will be tying it to the outside of my backpack.   So, I would most likely be given that trail name anyway.So, if you see a middle aged woman with a backscratcher attached to her pack it will probably be me.Looking forward to meeting and making new friends on the trail adventure.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Wed",0
