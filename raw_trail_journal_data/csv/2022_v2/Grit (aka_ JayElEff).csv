Beginning 2022
My wife and I began our adventure a bit unconventionally, mostly
due to Covid, but start we did in August 2021. We began at the Delaware Water
Gap on the Penn/NJ line and hiked south through the Shenandoahs’, then flipped
down to Georgia (Springer) and hiked north through the Smokies. We then pulled
out on Green Corner Road, just north of the I-40 underpass north of Davenport
Gap, TN… about ¼ mile south of Standing Bear Farm (Nobo mm 241.5) and came home
for Thanksgiving. 
   We’ve “over-wintered”
here (home) and beside aching to be back on trail and putting on weight, we’re
heading back down to Standing Bear on March 1st to continue our
adventure northbound. “Day One” (2022) will be mostly travel getting there. We
wanted to try to hike a bit longer (than 2-3 miles), but by the time we get
there from the airport (Asheville, NC (AVL)), it will be too late. Camping is
closed at the moment between northbound mile markers 245 and 253 because of
aggressive bear activity. So, we figure we'll get there, hike a bit and set up
camp before the closed section of trail (8 miles of it), get up early on the
Day 2 and hike through it (closed section) and continue on our way. The one
thing we did learn from hiking last fall was you must be flexible... and
flexible we shall be. 
It’s unfortunate that we can't link our 2021 portion of our
thru-hike and need to start a new journal for 2022 but I don't know how else to
do it. Between my wife and I, we've made quite a few entries in 2021 (addresses
above).","

We're home at the moment, gearing up to leave and head back down to North Carolina on March 1st, but let me tell you, we’ve both been very busy. Our kitchen has looked a mess at times while I've spent the past few months cooking, dehydrating, and packaging 214 dinners, 245 breakfasts, 320 ""snacks"" (personal trail mix blend), etc, repairing/replacing gear... and packing/repacking everything, multiple times. My pack weight is down to 28 pounds with 5 days of food which includes 2.5# of water (a little more than 1 liter), and my winter gear, which we’ll need at 5 - 6 thousand feet along the North Carolina / Tennessee mountain ridges in the ice and snow in early March ... Can't wait to leave... 18 days!!! Whoo Hoo!!! 

    We've got 622 miles to hike and we'll be finished with the south, so I suspect we'll be back up to the New Jersey/PA line by the middle of April and to Conn/NY border (PWL) by the beginning of May. (Hopefully) We’ve already done CT over the winter and plan on taking a short break at home to catch up on things that need doing (beehives, lawn care, resupplying, etc) and heading back out pretty soon.
 Perfect timing to avoid mud season in Vermont, as well as black fly season (I hope)... through the Whites (NH) in June and Maine in July... then home, which will be sad. I've been loving this stuff so much... 
       Then again, after thinking all winter, Maybe I’ll just head back out after recuperating a bit and finish the Long Trail in Vermont toward the end of August seeing that I'll already have done about half of it, then the Northville Placid Trail (133 miles) in New York in late September. Then, to be very adventurous, Next spring (2023), maybe it will be either the International Appalachian Trail (IAT) which begins in Ulster, Ireland for 279 miles. That was part of the Appalachian Mountain Range when the land masses were together (Pangea) Longgggg ago ... sounds too interesting not to do it.... OR, and I can't convince Jo-Ann to do this with me (yet), but I'm thinking maybe taking my canoe up to Northern Minnesota and canoeing the Mississippi River down to the Gulf of Mexico (New Orleans). That also sounds like a lot of fun. I've got to get doing this stuff as time is running out for me!!!  :-) I'm getting old!!!  I worked too long!!!!   and raised too many kids!!  haha....
    Also, this past winter, just for fun, I went to volunteer but found out I couldn’t because of “liability”, so instead went got my upgraded drivers’ license, background checks, medical appointments, etc and have been driving the Senior Citizens' bus, taking the seniors who can no longer drive to doctor's appointments, food shopping, general outings, etc. It's been awesome!!! I love it, much more than I knew I would!!! I took a 96 yr old sweetheart for a pedicure this past week!!!! She has living here in my home town before there were telephones and Ma Bell (if youngsters even know who Ma Bell was). Whew... what a lifetime of change she has seen... They have so much information to share it’s mind boggling and It’s been a hoot.
Anyway, I digress… (badly) (sorry) … Bottom line: Our bags are packed, we’re ready to go.. (sounds like a John Denver song 😊). We’ve got our airline tickets and we’re just counting down the days. Excitedly…","

I said I’d update things before we leave and mentioned a
few topics I’d expound upon, especially “post hike depression”. I had never
experienced any sort of depression before so didn’t really know what to expect,
but I was aware it happened frequently to long distance hikers. When we pulled
out last fall, things were great. I had retired from my 39 yr career last
summer and wasn’t “working” any longer, which is fantastic, but after a couple
of weeks home, I noticed I was staying in bed longer, even going to bed
earlier, and eating and snacking too much. I was “snippy”, argumentative,
negative … alienating those around me … etc… I wasn’t even enjoying doing the
normal things I’d always loved doing, and procrastinated doing them … bottom
line: I was pretty tough to live with, to say the least. My wife gave me space
but we finally sat down and discussed things. It took me a bit to come to grips
with it. I did realize something wasn’t right and worked on dealing with it. I
improved over the course of the next couple of weeks. I was NOT expecting how it
“appeared”. So, even though I was aware that many hikers before me had
forewarned about it, I was one of the “it won’t happen to me” group. But, it
did… It IS real and something of which to be aware. That, and I put back on
about half the weight I’d lost when hiking, which by itself was / is
disappointing. I’ll lose it again when I go back out, but that’s not the point
either. 
I mentioned my pack weight is down to around 28# with
winter clothes and a liter of water (2.2#), which is great. I started last
August around 34# without water, and through Pennsylvania in the summer where
water sources were scarce, I was carrying 3-4 liters of water (7-9#),
especially towards the late day when we were thinking of settling up camp for
the night. Brutal… on both the body and mind. This is a major improvement for
me and I know I could probably get it down further but I don’t think I’m willing
to give up my “creature comforts” enough to do it. I like what I like out there
on trail and don’t want to turn it into a “survival course” mentality.
Over the winter I also mentioned I’d been making dinners,
dehydrating and packaging them to rehydrate on trail using the qt size freezer
bag method and a Hyperlite coozy. The dinners made are: Beef Stroganoff,
Bolognese, Jo’s Black Bean Chili (Jo made this), Lasagne, Sausage Stew,
Indonesian Noodles, Chili Mac, Jambalaya, Thanksgiving Dinner, Hamburger gravy
with either rice of mashed potatoes with veggies, and Unstuffed Peppers. I’ve
also put spices for some of the meals in small 1” x 1” “baggies” to go along
with the dinners. For example, I like mine spicy, which Jo does not. So, when I
made the dinners I made them “normally” and will add my chili powder to my
chili (black bean and Mac) on trail. I’ve got crushed pecans, soy sauce, and
powdered lemon for my Indonesian noodles (Jo doesn’t like nuts), small Parmesan
powder packets for the pasta dinners, etc… you get the picture. It’s a few more
grams and a little bit more trash to pack out (and in) but for me, ultimately
worth it. At the end of the day, if I can get a good, tasty dinner and a warm,
dry, comfy bed to sleep (4” thk Big Agnes Q-core SLX air mattress), I can live
through almost anything and feel it’s not just “survival” but enjoyable. It may
sound spartan, but an important distinction for me. We’ve also put together
breakfasts. To get out of camp in the morning, We usually have coffee and a protein
bar. I also start my day with a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter,
sometimes with Nutella and/or jelly. Then, around 11 or so depending on the
hike, weather…  I like granola with whey
powder, Nido powder, dehydrated and/or freeze dried fruit, etc… a few days a
week and Jo likes instant oats with fruit, seeds, protein powder, etc. We “mix
it up” regularly so things don’t get too routine, they get there by themselves
without our help! Haha…  
Like I said, We’re leaving to head back south on March 1st
to continue our journey. It’s been quite the adventure thus far. I have learned
so much about myself. I’m much more appreciative of my time, my wife, my life. The
people we have met, and hope to meet, have been great. Stripped of everything
from “home”, you find yourself talking with people you probably wouldn’t talk
to in your “home situation”. You wouldn’t have, or find the time to do it. On
Trail, it’s what you do when you’re tenting nearby or stopping for lunch and I
have met so many wonderful people this way from all walks of life. We’re all
relatively the same in our wants, needs, loves, etc… It’s been a great “eye
opener” and having met all these people, from hikers (thru, day, weekend, …),
trail angels, trail volunteers, ridge runners, etc… it really has reignited a
fire in me that gives me hope in humanity. Over the years at home, reading the
daily news articles (most horrific and negative) and “direction” of seemingly
everything, it’s easy to lose faith, and I had… until I began this hike. There
are still many, many wonderful, loving, friendly people out there willing to go
well out of their way for you for no other reason than “they can” or want to,
and out there, it’s infectious in a wonderful way. It also “comes home with you”
and changes the way you go about your “at home life”.","

Grit (aka: JayElEff),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647004,"Jo and I are still on track for a March 1st departure back to our November ""pull out spot"" in North Carolina, the ""Green Road"", .2 south of Standing Bear Hostel. ( just North of Davenport Gap, TN ) We leave Conn. from Bradley (BDL) and arrive in Asheville, NC (AVL), arriving in early afternoon.
We're getting picked up by a (now) close friend, Dodger, (real name Larry) (and his wonderful wife Patty), whom we met during his shakedown hike this past October. It was definitely ""karma"" when we met him, as we were just ramping up miles from our issues with Jo's knee, but hadn't started ""kicking it"", and he was just starting out.  We hit it right off (OK, Jo and Dodger hit it right off as they talked incessantly)  :-)   We ended up hiking with him through the Smokies and so thoroughly enjoyed his company, we wanted to stay with him. It was awesome, and we all laughed, joked, and hiked... and became close. (Tramily, forever) He pulled out at Clingman's Dome and went home to Sylva, NC while we stopped in Gatlinburg, TN (talk about a ""cheesy"" place) to dry out and clean up, and then continued on for a couple of more days and pulled out at Standing Bear Hostel. We were ""extracted"" (haha... another long story) by another great hiker friend and his wife, whom we met in Harper's Ferry years before, and they brought us to Asheville and treated us like kings/queens!!! ...  and it was awesome.     I must say, for me, it was hard to adjust being back in ""civilization"". I wasn't used to so many people, and ""sounds"" (of civilization)  (beyond birds, and wind, etc) Jo-Ann got ill from driving in a car because of all the ""quick movement"". It sounds strange, but, it really was a ""thing"". The quiet and serenity of being in the woods is so comforting and peaceful, it was a tough adjustment. Yes, it's grueling (hiking), but that's exactly what makes it so fantastic. Being Back in ""civilization"" is just harder on the senses right off the bat than you're expecting, and can become overwhelming. 
The first few nights in a bedroom, I couldn't sleep because it was so ""quiet"" (and Terry's (our friend) bed was so darn soft/comfortable). What? There's no rock under my pad? Our tent's not on an incline? my hip doesn't hurt? That owl won't shut up and the deer aren't hooting? ... haha... Even after I got home, at one point I got out of bed and layed on the floor so I could ""sleep"". Eventually (didn't take all that long), I got used to being back off trail. 
I feel sorry for those who have never experienced the extreme joy of just ""being"", which is why I have always loved being out in the woods, or on the oceans, rivers, ... outside period. It's what's driven me to go out there for the past 50 plus years. I've never felt this way being anywhere else, and don't get me wrong, Jo and I have the most wonderful home in the world, and I could (probably will) stay there forever (as long as she's there with me) :-) .  You know you're ""there"" (being), when you're hiking along (or whatever you're doing) on a beautiful morning/day, (could be raining, whatever... it's still ""beautiful"")  you're noticing the birds, frogs, lichen, mushrooms, trees, ... the sun ... the sky ... when suddenly you stop and just ""take it all in"", so happy your heart feels like it's going to explode. You're happy for what you have (which at that point isn't much, materially) and even happy for what you don't have. You just feel ""whole"", inside and out, and the world is a beautiful place... and I know I'm extra blessed to have Jo to be experiencing this adventure with, and loving it as much as me. What are the chances of that happening?... through all the eons of time (13 billion years?), that I meet Jo, marry her,  and I get to experience this adventure with my best friend, together?  ... what's the new thing... ""Stat That""!!!    I've never experienced this feeling (being whole) to this extent while at ""home"", as much as I love it there... only outdoors. It's the only place where ""things"" are stripped away and at some point, you realize it boils down to just ""you and the world, and your ""relationships"". You accept what is, and what isn't ... and you're so good with that to the point of just ""being"". It simply doesn't get any better than that, and I do know that sounds pretty cheesy, but if you've never felt it, you wouldn't understand. For those who have, it explains their passions, whatever they may be, and those are the people I feel most comfortable being around. It doesn't seem to matter what those passions, or loves are, it's the people who have them, and feel so strongly about them that do.    It's the experience of being outdoors that brings you together. You and a person, could be sitting near each other in a Starbucks someplace and never talk, because of social norms or whatever.  That doesn't seem to happen in the woods. Out there, you and that same person, as different as you might be, talk. You talk to almost everyone you meet, and normal social barriers/norms that could hinder your ""meeting"", just don't seem to be there. Those imagined barriers drop and you realize you're more alike than different, regardless of your (believed) social standing, background, education, history... It's uncanny, and wonderful. Period. ... and it only seems to happen in the outdoors.  
We've got 16 resupply boxes semi-packed with dinners, breakfasts, snacks, hydration sleeves, coffee, ... and other things that will eventually be shipped to us. I understand this is an ongoing topic among hikers, as it really doesn't save you any money doing it this way. I just like knowing what it is I'm eating and I'll enjoy it, which is why I do it. Everyone is different and that's great. This is just my (our) way of doing it. 
So, here's to heading back out on our adventure. Very much looking forward to it... Whoo Hoo!!!","

Grit (aka: JayElEff),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647357,"It's great being back on trail after taking the winter off. And what luck, on our 2nd day out, on the north side of Max Patch, we came upon the legendary Jennifer Pharr Davis!!! She was soooo nice!!!  She took pictures with us and chatted. She was out with a group from her Blue Ridge Hiking Company!!! What a treat!!!  The week has been great, albeit cold at night. It makes getting started in the morning a bit tougher when you see your fingers but they don't do what you ask of them because you can't feel them.    We've been pretty blessed with nice weather during the day... cold rain one day... until last night when a winter storm moved in. We knew it was coming so we pulled out at Sam's Gap and hooked a ride to Nature's Inn Hostel and Camps where we'll spend 2 nights. Hot showers, clothes washed and a dry comfortable bed!!! We're very glad we did because the Hostel is comfortable, cozy and great. Temps dropped into low 20's, 35-40 mph winds and lots of snow (4-6"" by 11 am.) Very grateful to be inside and not in the mountains.    Next up is hiking into Erwin, TN to resupply and onward! Spring is coming!!! 🤣 Still very happy to be back out here!!! ... and meeting lots of great people!💕😷","

Grit (aka: JayElEff),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647839,"Update: It’s been quite the week. It's been warm, cold, snowy, rainy, windy, foggy, .... you name it, we've hiked through it. Bottom line,  we're out of North Carolina and into Northern Tennessee,  which may be my favorite part of this adventure so far. It’s just stunning in its' beauty. We've surpassed 900 miles and from what I'm told ""spring is coming"", but you couldn't prove it by me. We'll be leaving Tenn in a couple of days and into Southern Virginia soon, where we're planning on stopping for a Zero. (Damascus, VA) We're also meeting more thru-hikers lately, most of which are slack packing, so we still have plenty of tenting options at shelters, etc. Weather is still cold at night and warms up during early afternoon so hiking is nice. It's still a bit early/cold for a lot of bugs and mosquitoes yet, and I haven't seen any ticks yet either,  but check every day. All in all, a great hike thus far and still loving it. ❤️","

Grit (aka: JayElEff),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660146,"This won't be my last entry for this journal, but I felt this picture needed to be added. JoMaMa and I made our first attempt at summiting on the 21st, but the weather was so nasty (over 80 mph winds, with very low vsby), we turned around at treeline and came back down. But today, on the 22nd, the weather was glorious and after over 2100 miles, summited Katahdin on a clear, warm, almost windless day. An adventure like none other. I was 3 weeks shy of 71 when we summited, JoMaMa was 68... and if there was a ""statistic"" they kept, I believe we would be the oldest married couple to have ever completed a thru hike. (If you know of any older, I'd love to know, and offer my congrats as it's no easy task, much less at this age)  Not that that matters... the thrill and fun of just doing it was so awesome. It was definitely a feeling I'd never had before. I wanted to go home to see our family but on the flip side, I loved being out there hiking and meeting so many wonderful people, I didn't ever want it to end. But it did and now that I sit here and peruse the '23 hopefuls I can't help but wish I was going back out, and maybe next year, but this year I'm staying home (for the most part) :-)  I do promise to catch up with the BIG GAP on my trailjournal. By the end of the day, after hiking, setting up camp, eating and cleaning up, and brushing and finally hanging our bear bag... ""journaling"" was about the last thing I felt doing. All I wanted to do was get to sleep because no matter what, tomorrow was bringing more of the same... and it was wonderful.","spent last evening in town
