Ready for my 2022 trail journal to begin.  So here goes.


Rockdawg  (who I hiked briefly with last year) and I have been planning this for some time.  I have admit in the last few weeks I’ve some sleepless nights about whether to go or not.  Was questioning if the fire was as still in the belly.  But, alas, here I am in transit to Vermont.  Maybe this trip will be just the opposite of some of my previous AT  hikes.  Maybe my desire will grow instead of wane as I proceed.  I have trained quite hard for this hike.  Hundreds of miles walked this year including a fair number of them wearing a 20 pound weighted vest and later with my full heavier backpack.


Rockdawg started a few days ago from Hanover,NH going south.  Then I will be traveling a few days later to meet him at Killington and hike south together for 164 miles to Tyringham, MA where we both got off the AT last year. At that point we both will have completed every mile of the AT from the southern end in GA to Hanover, NH a total of about 1,750 miles.  (Actually I have completed about 20 miles further than that but will not mind doing them again with Rockdawg).


So, that is the plan for now.  And, if the fire is still burning.  If the body and mind are still in good shape.  Then catch a ride to Hanover, NH and continue the trek further north. Can’t say that is likely; but, who knows in this crazy world.  One thing for sure, I am getting tired of months of training each year to try to complete the 2,194 miles of the AT.",,View Entry,"Jun 20, Mon",0

Met up with Rockdawg about 4pm today.  He caught a ride (skipped some AT miles) and arrived at Gifford Woods State Park earlier than I expected.  So, we are re-united and ready to head out south tomorrow morning.


Had a nice stay at Yellow Deli Hostel in Rutland,VT last night. Met about 8 other hikers there.  Spend most of the day doing a few chores and just relaxing.  Then rode a free area bus service to near Killington where the state Park is located.  I did walk about 2 miles before locating Rockdawg.


It was a nice weather day although slight rain was forecasted.  May rain tonight and into tomorrow.  Temps are moderate and comfortable.  That is a welcome change after the 90’s and low 100’s the last week at home. So far only a very minimal amount of bugs to deal with.  Some waving at some flying around and no bites.","RutlandVT

It rained overnight.  Woke up at about 1am today to find a small puddle in my tent. Fortunately the tent was situated so that it accumulated in one corner not affecting any of my gear.  Discovered later where I failed to set up stakes with enough tautness to avoid rain getting in.


Before the rain a couple of guys with a large dog were situated in an adjoining campsite.  The guys talked very loudly and the dog’s barks were like a foghorn going off.  Gladly the rain drove them all into their tent and and solitude prevailed.


Started hiking in pleasant temps but with rain covers on our packs.  Leaves were full of moisture from the overnight rain and fell during wind guests.  Had a fairly tough climb early where both of us made frequent rest stops.  Later we reached Manchester Center.  No, not a town, just a point on the woods where the AT and the Long Trail meet.  The Long Trail predates the AT and runs the whole N/S distance of Vermont from MA to Canada(about 270 miles). For the bottom last 100 miles of it the AT shares the same path.


During the hike today I took a reading of my feelings about being out here hiking.  And had discussions with Rockdawg about it.  Long story short, I decided my heart was not in it and it was best to go home.  Will have more comments about that in the next post.


So, when we made it to the highway crossing we waited for the free shuttle bus and made our way back to the Yellow Deli hostel in Rutland.


During the afternoon and evening I made plan of how to get back to Aiken.  Will give details in tomorrow’s post.","Gifford Woods SP, Killington, VT

Woke up in the hostel with no different feelings about going home.  Had breakfast with Rockdawg and we temporarily went different ways.  He had to go to an emergency med center for concerning congestion and other symptoms.  Me to the post office to mail home a box of heavier items to lessen the load in my backpack for travel.  Upon returning to the hostel I took my still wet tent from yesterday morning and set it up on a street corner grassy space with abundant sunshine and wind.  It dried completely in about 20 minutes.  I was waiting for police or someone else to stop and ask what I was doing - but no problems at all.


Near noon it was time to leave for the local AMTRAK station and Rockdawg had not returned from the med center.  I was on the train before he returned to the hostel.  Via texting, learned he had bronchitis, had to go get medicines and had tested negative for COVID.  We said our goodbyes via text.  He is going to spend at least another day at the hostel before proceeding.


My return to Aiken is not going to be easy:Thursday - AMTRAK from Rutland,VT to NYC.  Spend the night in Penn Station.
Friday - AMTRAK from NYC to Raleigh,NC.  Spend the night in the bus station there.


Saturday - Bus from Raleigh to Aiken arriving around noon.


Going to be a fun trip.


Tomorrow’s post will give an update on travel progress and more about decision to go home.",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Thu",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653595,"Todays travel segment done, AMTRAK from NYC to Raleigh, NC and transit to the Raleigh bus station.  It is over 3 miles between the two stations in Raleigh.  There were many passengers getting off the train there.  While standing in the train aisle waiting for the doors to open I was next to an older lady.  I boldly asked if she was driving home from the station.  Her daughter was picking her up and did not know if they would be going near the bus station.  So my plan was to ask others if they would be driving that direction. Before I got to ask anyone else I saw the older lady being picked up. She waved for me to come over.  Met her daughter and grandson and they wanted to give me a ride even though it wasn’t on their way home. Another example of meeting wonderful trail angels.  My plan just to spent the night in the Grayhound bus station was quickly and unexpectedly crushed.  Even though I had spend an overnight in this station several years ago, their policy had changed and no longer allowed it.  The ticket agent told me of a Motel 6 within walking distance.  So off I go with backpack on in upper 80’s heat and high humidity.  It was slightly less than a mile hike along a busy multi-lane street with no sidewalk.  Being more than just a little sweaty and after about 15 minutes waiting to get checked in, I made it to the less than family friendly accommodations.  Although not first class, it turned out better than a night in uncomfortable seating at the bus station.  Had a needed shower, cool air and a comfortable enough bed which was nice.


Last overnight in  NY’s Penn Station was an experience.  At most I got 30 minutes sleep.  I did feel quite safe with a secured ticketed passenger only rest area and police roving around the premises.  Was surprised that there was a steady stream of inbound and outbound NJ Transit trains up to nearly 2am.  And between 4-5am they started up again.  The similar AMTRAK area in the new Moynihan complex completely closed at 1am and reopened at 5am.  Thus the overnight in the old Penn Station on the adjoining block.",,View Entry,"Jun 24, Fri",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653649,"Set my alarm for 3am, hurriedly readied and hiked the mile to the Raleigh bus station.  Arrived at 4am for my 5am bus departure.  Got home around noon yesterday.  Spent the afternoon at home with Wendy and out to a nice dinner in the evening.


So, my 2022 AT hike is history.  Not much of a success at all.  Only hiked 5 miles and in the process spent a significant amount of money on travel and other related items.  But, in a larger sense I think it taught me a lesson on trusting my gut instincts.  As much as I wanted to hike more of the AT and hopefully finish it all, I really knew deep down inside it was not ever going to happen.  But my ”want to”overwhelmed my gut feel and common sense.  Those sleepless hours thinking I should not attempt it, were reversed by daytime irrational hopefulness.


So I say a FINAL farewell to the wonderful experiences of the Appalachian Trail.  It shall always be among my favorite memories.  I do feel humbled by it and it’s challenges.  And I’m glad for all the people I’ve met and friends I’ve gained.  


Maybe when I get to the great beyond, there will be an equivalent of the AT there.  Certainly Benton MacKaye will have accumulated friends and have it completed by now.  Until then, perhaps shorter hikes will suffice as i grow into my golden years. 


In the mean time I will be content with Wendy by my side growing older together and enjoying the leisure life.  We have two grown children we are proud of and have 7 grandchildren to enjoy.  Life is good, very good.


With sincere thanks especially to Wendy and also to all my supporters over the last 9 years……Achin says “over and out”.


HAVE A GREAT LIFE !!!",,View Entry,"Jun 26, Sun",0
