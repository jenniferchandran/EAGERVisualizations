Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647035,"The first time I saw the Appalachian Trail was on a visit to Great Smokey Mountains NP.  I had stopped at Newfound Gap to use the bathroom there and the trail ran practically right in front of it.  There were a few hikers there with backpacks, resting beside the trail and a trail sign that had I don't know how many arrows.  One said Mt Katadyn, ME and I don't remember how many miles....I guess close to 2000 miles away when I look at my guide book now.  I struck up a conversation with one of the hikers and he told me that he was heading to Maine...all the way.  I looked back at the sign and it just blew my mind that this one trail would go all the way to Maine.  I was reminded of a quote from Bilbo Baggins in the Lord of the Rings...as told by Frodo, I believe.  He was talking about comparing roads to rivers and said something to the effect of, 'It's a strange business, Frodo, going out your front door.  You step onto the road and if you don't keep your feet, there's no telling where you might get swept off to.' Roads in middle earth to me looked just like this trail when I looked up at it in the direction of Maine....I could get swept all the way to Maine!  I think I was hooked then and there and didn't even know it yet.  Within a couple years of that, I started doing some small backpacking trips of no more than 2-6 days....Guadalupe Mtns, the Inca Trail, Mt Rainier, Grand Tetons, Glacier, and Grand Canyon...along with a few weekend overnights in the north GA mountains.  Nothing up to the scale of an AT Thru Hike, but it was always in the back of my mind gnawing at me.  Then one night at work a coworker of mine brought a HS friend of his in to tour our company's data center and he introduced me.  The 2 of them were going to hike up to Springer Mtn the next day, camp overnight, and then his friend was going to start a thru hike the day after that.  That was it for me...all I could think of was if this guy could do it, so could I.  Not that he was out of shape or anything, he just wasn't much different from me.  My vision of what I thru hiker was had been influenced severely by the younger hikers I saw that day at Newfound Gap, so until I saw this guy I thought to do something that monumental, you had to have young legs and endurance.  At that point the spark became a burning ember and a thru hike was part of my bucket list every since.
This hike/adventure is dedicated to my mom, who unfortunately passed away last Aug and will be unable to see me attempt this hike.  She had always been my biggest supporter and was excited that I was finally going to attempt this after talking to her about it for so many years.  She was also very excited to be able to follow along remotely and provide any support she could from a distance, but I'll be carrying a part of her with me and she will always be in my thoughts, encouraging me and urging me onward.
I'm keeping this journal (and promise I'll try to be diligent with updating it) for my own posterity and so that friends and family can follow along and know that I'm still alive and kicking, but I welcome anyone that wants to follow along....I'll try not to bore you to death.  ;)
Good luck to all the other thru hikers out there already and who have yet to launch.  Stay safe and let's all look out for each other.
Bilbo out!

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647036,"I decided to do a field test/gear shakedown prior to my start date and chose the AT Approach Trail.  I was going to skip the Approach Trail on my launch date due to the fact that the friends of mine (Mike and Allen) that will be dropping me off had expressed an interest in hiking with me a bit.  I figured going to the Springer Mtn access at USFS 42 and backtracking the 1 mile to the top of Springer was the easiest way to do that and give them a nice hike to accompany me to the start....weather permitting of course.  :)  Soooo, I wanted to be able to say I did the Approach Trail and the AT for all those purists out there that think leaving it off is not a true hike.  ;)  Aimed from Sat, 2/19....hike up to Black Gap shelter to camp and continue on to the top of Springer Mtn and then come all the way back down.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Fri",0
Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647043,"Sat, 2/19 - Started off from the visitors center at approx 1115.  Walked through the arch and headed up to the falls (gradual 400+ ft incline).  From the base of the falls I took the 604 steps up (I only counted 601, but I may have been delirious at some point) to the top of the falls and then on to the lodge.  The outer jacket came off at the first stairs landing.  Was a bit disappointed that it took me over an hour to do that 1.2 miles total.  Missed the turn off and hiked through the parking lot and up to the lodge.  Best way to lose a wilderness trail is when it enters and exits civilization.  LOL  After circling the lodge parking lot and not finding a reentrance of the trail, I had to sheepishly enter the lodge to ask for directions.  Back down the road to second crosswalk and take a right and you're back on the trail...can't miss it. Too Late!  I did already!  Rest of the trail up to Black Gap Shelter was 2 or 3 long sloping inclines, only had to stop to catch my breath 2 or 3 times on each....not like every other landing on the falls stairs.  Also had a couple pretty gnarly downhill sections.  One was very steep and muddy into Nimblewill Gap (mile marker 6.0).  The trail there looked like a kayaking course that had been recently drained of water.  A lot of rock shelves with long step downs to muddy, slick surfaces.  It's a miracle I didn't take a fall here...Thank You trekking poles!!  I stopped to have lunch at mile marker 3.2 (mm3.2) where the trail crosses High Shoals Road.  A small amount of ice on the trail when water crossed a shaded part of the trail during the last mile and a half or so going into Black Gap Shelter.  Overall great weather though...chilly, but sunny.  Didn't need the outer jacket since removing it at the falls.  Slight breeze depending on what side of any particular mountain you were on.  Got to camp around 1630.  Set up my tent...rather pourly....and went down a STEEP side trail across the Approach Trail from the camp site to get water.  Note to self...if there's a convenient water source on the trail close to your camp site for the night....take the time to stop and fill up there!  Unless you KNOW the water source at the camp does not require you to be a mountain goat to get it.  Had a bite to eat after retrieving water and was in my tent crawling into my sleeping bag around 7pm as the sun went down and the temp began dropping.  Had to get up at 9pm, 11pm and again at 4am to pee.  Another side note...pick a tent site on the fringe of the camp area so that if you have to pee, you can get out and do your business away from the rest of the campers.  Mine was right in the middle with either a tent or the shelter on every side of me, so I had to take the full walk to the privy each time.  Didn't sleep all that well.  Wind was really howling up on the mountain tops and sounded like Hartsfield airport at mid day.  Luckily only a slight breeze ever got down into the gap.  Wind let up around 11 and everything go very still...that's when the owl started hooting.  All in all the wild sounds of nature are very soothing though...my problem sleeping was just more being keyed up, in a new environment, and having a sleeping bag that had a draft and a pillow that kept shooting out from under my head any time I tried to roll over.  I finally realized there was a drawstring at the top of the sleeping bag/quilt that once I pulled it in the draft went away.  I also switch to using my jacket in it's stuff sack as my pillow and tossed the inflatable pillow aside.  It will not be accompanying me on the actual hike!  Full moon rose around 11pm also....or came out from behind clouds that blew away, but either way it was just gorgeous!  I found that my tent lets a LOT of light filter in!  Anyway, was finally able to drift off and had a few catnaps through the night, but probably no more than 4 hours sleep.  Will take some getting used to to sleep like that, but when you're tired enough, I can sleep on a boulder.  Legs were also very sore and cramping a bit...a fact I found out each time I got up to go pee.  I didn't pack my ibuprofen, so that will be corrected next time.
Sun, 2/20 - Actually woke up around 0715 and laid in my bag only about 15 mins before deciding to go ahead and get up.  Retrieved my food bag and had a bit of breakfast, then packed up my stuff, took down the tent and stored my pack in the bear locker...no sense in carrying it all the way to the top of Springer if I was just going to turn around and come back by here in an hour or 2.  Black Gap Shelter was at 7.3mm on the Approach Trail and top of Springer is at 8.8mm, so 1.5 miles up with just me and my poles, I was able to do that in about 30-40 mins.  Hung around on top for the departure/start of a gentleman named Ron (Trail name possibly Pap) and Gavin (Trail name possibly Yardsale).  Neither had decided on a name.  Ron said Pap might be his cause that's what his grandkids call him, and Gavin got the Yardsale tag due to his pack items being strewn across the shelter floor like he was having a yardsale.  2 other gentlemen were up there...one named Pat, who was just leaving when I arrived and another guy who's name I never got that just arrived as I was leaving.  Took pics of/for each other in front of the first blazes and plaque signifying the start.  Wished them well and good health and then headed back down.  Retrieved my pack and set off to head back down the 7.3 miles at approx 1145.  Legs really started feeling the affects of the day before and probably lack of enough sleep within the first mile or 2.  Just very leg weary and the mostly downhill pounding took it out of me, but I trudged on...took more rests than the day before and got back to the car at about 6pm.  I DID run out of water with about 4 miles to go, but stopped at a stream and filled my bottle back up with about 1.5 miles left.  I was hoping and praying some kind soul would offer me a ride to the bottom when I crossed the road and parking lots for the lodge and top of the falls, but alas, no...so had to pound my way down the 601 steps (I KNOW I counted them right this time...not 604!).  Low and behold after I had passed the start of the Approach Trail and was heading for my car, THEN someone pulled up beside me and asked if I was ok...presumably to give me lift.  No, my car is just around the corner here now (Where were you a mile ago!?)  
All in all, an endeavor that was well worth the time and effort.  I learned some things about my equipment and myself and what kind of pace I can expect starting off anyway.  It wasn't what I was hoping for, but then the hope is that it will get better as my legs and body get more used to it.  Not going to lie, there were a few discouraging moments coming down with the weary legs that I really was doubting myself.  I needed to get back in the car and then realize that despite weary legs I did 10.3 trail miles on my second day.  7.3 on my first day.  Total elevation gain of 1982 ft in 8.8 miles.  And of course back down the same elevation and 8.8 miles to the bottom.  I was and am still not planning to do more than 8.3 miles per day my first 4 days into Neel Gap for my first resupply.  I also found out this weekend while up here that the hostel at Neel Gap is closed this year as a COVID precaution.  Was hoping to bag one of those bunks on the way, but now will have to seek other means.  Good info to know now.  :)
Now just have to adjust my gear a bit...practice setting up my tent a couple times, get the homefront in order and I should be set to launch on 3/27.  :)

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647393,"Sunday, 3/13:  Official launch date is now 2 weeks away (3/27/2022).  Have made a gear change decision that I think I still need to update in my gear section here.  I've decided to completely forego the bear canister for now.  All the shelters and sounds like most campgrounds in GA at least have bear lockers and cables.  That alone is knocking a little over 2 lbs off my pack wt.  I'm going to carry a bit of extra cord and a zPacks bear bag kit and just store it in lockers or on cables when I can and hang it in a tree when those are not available.  I've also changed my mind on going stoveless.  By the time I figured up about how much the food I'm going to take is going to weigh, it seems like that completely overcomes the wt of carrying a stove, pot, and fuel.  In order to get enough calories in me, it will take a lot of heavier food to carry, that say a dehydrated meal for 2 each night that only needs a cup and a half of boiling water added.  Shouldn't be a lot of cleanup of the pot either since it's going to be used mostly just to boil water.  I may at some point do a lot of ramen noodles in the pot, but again the small hassle of washing out that one pot seems minimal for the wt in food that I'll be cutting out.  Also, got me a better, more durable water bladder for holding dirty water to filter (CNOC 2 liter bladder).  Now might just carry 1 of the Sawyer sqeeze bladders as an emergency backup or to carry a bit of extra water when sources are more scarce.
To all my family and friends....I'm going to issue a bit of a challenge to make this adventure a bit more fun and interactive for you also.  For every 10 miles I hike, you get out and walk at least a mile.  So, at least 10% of what I'm hiking, you all match.  Make it a fun competition between yourselves...heck make it 20 or 25%!  Keep each other honest and accountable.  Put the phone down, log off of facebook or your computer, take the dog with you if you have one, get outside and get a whiff of fresh air, take a break from working to much!  Honestly, it will be good for everyone to get some exercise mixed in and feel like you're walking with me for at least part of every day.  ;)  2,194 miles is what I'll be doing total and looking to avg at least 13.3 miles a day to accomplish that in around 5.5 months.  That's 1.33 miles a day for you 10%ers and 220 miles total over the next 5.5 months.  2.67 miles a day and 440 miles total for you 20%ers, and 3.33 miles a day and 549 miles if you go for 25%.  Why stop there...if you feel up to it, go for more!  This will also keep me motivated a bit more to put the miles out there on avg every day to give you all something to shoot for.  I'm going to be burning anywhere from 4000-6000 calories per day depending on the mileage and elevation gain/loss every day....so I'll be losing some wt.  Might as well join me and use this as an excuse to do the same!  ;)  And for anyone else reading, you're MORE than welcome to join in!
I'll be posting a journal entry for each day on the trail, but I may not be posting them every day.  I'll probably have to wait for the days I get to a town and can get wifi access to post journal entries and recharge my phone.  Part of each entry will be where I started that day, where I finished, and what my mileage was.  I'll try to also include where I am aiming to get to for the next resupply off the trail, so if you want to anticipate what I'll be hiking, feel free or just follow along and do the mileage I've posted that past 3-5 days.  Hoping to make this a bit of fun and better well being for all that are following along and give myself some incentive to keep going when my legs are bone weary and the bed back at home is calling.

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647651,"Hey Everyone!I put my full pack together this week with what I'll be starting the trail out with and decided to make a video of what's in it as I break it back down.  My full pack came in at 33.6 lbs total with 9+ lbs of food and 2-3 liters of water for another 4-5 lbs.  My base pack wt (Total pack wt - wt of food and water) therefore came in right at or a little under my goal of 20 lbs.  Food to me is heavier than I had hoped.  I was trying to get close to the expected calorie burn rate of 5000 calories per day, but still came up short at about 3500 calories of food per day on avg.  Going to have to experiment on getting some food that's high in calories, light weight, and somewhat palatable.  Not sure that exists, but will try.  :)  Now I think I have an appreciation for what 'hiker's hunger' is and why hikers gorge themselves in every town and trail magic encounter they come across.My intent was to do this in one video, but my camera battery was failing and it shut down on me twice.  And then I had to fire the camera up a 4th time cause I forgot to go over the gear/clothes I'll be wearing....so 4 videos instead of 1.  I tried my hand at some video editing software in Windows 10 to combine them into one, and it appeared to work, but the sounds was distorted...sounded like a 33 1/3 record being played at 45.  Let's see how many of you understand that reference.  :)  Anyway, I'll try to brush up on some video editing this week...any tips or crash courses someone can advise would be appreciated.  I know it's going to be tough doing anything but dumping videos from my phone when I get to a town....but if there are easy video editing tools to use in that type of environment, let me know.Hope I don't bore you too much if you this is old hat to any of you, but for those that have never thought about what a hiker has to carry with them, I hope it's at least a tad bit educational.  Keep in mind, I'm in no way an expert or pro at this and will be learning a lot I'm sure as the trip goes along.  It will be fun at the end to look back at this and see what I packed that was not needed and any essentials that I ended up with in the end that I never knew I needed at the start.Hope you all enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/channe...",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Sun",0

Miles 0.0 - 1.0
Officially registered for my thru hike today and got #1965 for Northbound//NOBO hikers this year.  As planned, my buddy, Mike Stephens took me to the Springer Mtn trailhead, one mile down the AT to verify we could get to it.  One lane, gravel and rock road most of the way with lots of bumps and ruts.  Decided to go ahead and hike the mile from the parking lot/trailhead to the top of Springer and knock that mile off.  Officially signed the log book and hiked back down.  1 down, 2193.3 miles to go.  Pretty windy in gusts for the hike up and down, but really wasn't cold except when you stop.  Will start heading north from same trailhead tomorrow.  Intending 7.1 miles to Wolf Mtn Shelter...mile marker 8.1 on the trail.  Also, dropped my first resupply box off at Neel Gap, where I intend to be on day 4.  Talk to you all tomorrow.  🙂

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648062,"Pretty emotional start for me.  Have been planning and looking forward to this day for years. Combine that with the fact that I couldn't call mom to let her know I was starting just hit when it was time to finally begin.  Couldn't have asked for much better weather to start.  Kinda windy and chilly, but warmed up quickly once I got into the green tunnel as the trail is nicknamed. Started at approx 1030 and got to the shelter around 1530. Came across first trail magic at Three Forks from 'Tickle Me Elmo', a 2018 thru hiker from TN. Met 'Minute Man' there and hiked with him a bit until we hit an uphill section which there are few I can keep up with on.  Later found a glove on the trail, which proved to belong to 'Minute Man', whom I met again at Long Creek Falls.  Very pretty and peaceful setting at the base of the falls to stop for lunch and refill on water.  Hard climb before reaching camp at least by my early standards, but managed.  Kind of a restless first night's sleep.  Day one, all in all, a success.  First use of a privy on the AT!

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648076,"Left camp around 0918. Hoping to get more efficient at breaking down and packing to go each morning.  Restless nights sleep combined with sore first day legs made for rubbery legs all day...especially after a near 800 ft climb from Horse Gap up Sassafras Mtn and sharp downhill after that.  A few good views on the way up Sassafras, but then every time I stop, gasping for air, it is of course cause I'm admiring the view. Had lunch on top of Sassafras.  Pretty manageable grade after that to Gooch Gap Shelter.  Cramped designated tent sites at the shelter combined with a LOT of hikers stopping here made for a tight fit. Tent sites pretty rocky and hard to drive stakes into. Better nights sleep than night 1.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648083,"Left camp at 0817...better at breaking down and packing.  Another leg weary day from start to finish.  Right knee began feeling twinges in it, so really slowed me down, especially on the downhills, which I'm usually quite fast at. Nothing to extreme in elevation gain or loss, but 4 good climbs, especially near straight up on the second one, followed by an immediate down and back up.  Came across the first big Trail Magic at the Woody Gap parking lot/trail head. 'Diva Queen' from IN and former thru hiker was serving up Sloppy Joe's, Mac and Cheese, oranges, and numerous drink options. Provided a nice and much needed pick-me-up for the last big climb of the day.   Knee feeling better as the day went on, but still not trusting it.  Was trying very hard to get to Lance Creek campsite as it's the last designated campsite before Bear canisters are required and very few thru hikers carry bear canisters, so a lot were planning to camp there. While the guide books said only 4-6 camp tent sites were there(I think I was about the 8th one to arrive) we managed to squeeze in 34 or 35 tents, including hammocks scattered along the path in and around the campsite. First ever use of bear cables to hang my food.  Due to this run on tent space, I actually called ahead to Blood Mtn cabins to reserve a place for the next night off trail at Neel Gap.  Tomorrow, Blood Mtn...the highest peak in GA on the AT and second highest in the state of GA.Now, back to the title question that I'm sure everyone read to this point just to hear an answer.  It's a vital piece of info the both JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson left out of their books and movies respectfully.  YES THEY DO!!  And this hobbit had to prove it on the morning of day four actually, in the dark.  When you're at a campsite with no privy and the urge begins to set in, you can either try to hold it until the next shelter with a privy(4 miles away) or dig a hole and pray your aim is true. Mine was...believe me you don't want to be redispensing your business into dug hole after the fact...a lesson I learned many years ago, backpacking through the Tetons. So another first on the AT to check off.","Gooch Gap Shelter

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648090,"Blood Mountain! A long, steady, near constant climb from the moment I left camp at 0800 until I got to the top, 4.9 miles later, and followed by a 2.4 mile steep and much more treacherous descent into Neel Gap.  Total ascent for the day - 1965 ft and descent of 1785 ft.  Took it slow and steady due to lack of confidence in the knee still, but arrived at Neel Gap around 1430...decent time considering.  I think my endurance and leg strength is increasing, but hard to tell since it seems like the challenge of the hike increases each day also. Net result is always a tired pair of legs. Picked up my box of resupply food, most of which I don't really need, and bought a knee support/brace along with 2 coke zeros and a pepperoni pizza at Mountain Crossing outfitters.  Trivia note: The Mountain Crossings building is the only building on the AT where the trail goes through the building. Offered space in my cabin to fellow thru hiker 'Big Mike'(may end up as 'Tall Mike' since there's a bigger 'Big Mike' in our grouping.  Also, Offered space to Andy from TX, who's doing this first section as a test to see if he wants to thru hike the AT next year after retirement. Big day and challenge tomorrow...need to do 11.3 miles to Low Gap Shelter with the knee brace.  3 miles more than my highest day so far, but need to start upping my daily miles to get to that 13.3 mile avg to complete in 5.5 months. Oh, and it's also supposed to rain tonight and into tomorrow, so I have that going for me.  Wish me luck!!!

Day started still very windy and raining a bit. Contemplated taking a zero day, which a lot of other hikers did, but weather check showed the wind advisory was clearing up at 8am and the rain would clear out. Donned the rain gear and headed out at 0945. Had to wait for Mtn Crossings to open at 9am to replace my lost Smart Water bottle, so that contributed to a bit later start.  Still foggy when starting up a long climb out of Neel Gap to Levelland Mtn. Fog had cleared out on the way up and sun came out, so shed the rain gear for rest of the day.  Had lunch at a beautiful rock overlook at Wolf Laurel Top.  7 total climbs up and totaling over 2100 ft up and back down over 11.5 miles...longest mileage day to date.  The worst was a long steep descent into Tesnatee (Test the knees) Gap and the just as step up the other side of it. Next Gap over was Hogpen Gap where 'Queen Diva' once again was hosting trail magic along with 'Hopeful'.  Finally trudged into camp at Low Gap Shelter at 1816.  'Big/Tall' Mike, Ashley and James/'Packman' also in camp here.  Met and set up tent next to 'JP'.  Had a quick dinner as the sun was going down and retreated to my tent.  Now back to the title....at some point in the night I ran out of water and needed to pee anyway so, I exited the tent to take care of business and scoop some water from the stream to filter.  Back at my tent, I crawled inside, zipped up the tent, which it should be noted I did not do while I was gone, and began to filter some water.  Suddenly, I see a shadow move to my left and turned my headlamp that way to discover a mouse, scurrying around, frantically trying to find an exit...even climbing up my screen.  I unzipped the tent door and ushered said mouse back to the door where he climbed out and scurried off into the night.  Lesson...even if there are no bugs out to get in your, there are other critters that are just waiting for an opportunity.  ALWAYS zip up when leaving the tent unoccupied!

Cold morning, but turned into beautiful weather. Started from camp at 0830 and got to Unicoi Gap at approx 1400.  Long slow uphill hike most of the day to top of Blue Mtn....1772 total feet uphill and 1877 feet downhill...most of that from Blue Mtn to Unicoi Gap.  Only really one gnarly section of a traverse through mostly boulder hopping. No view at the top, but nice quiet forest up there. Met trail magic at Unicoi from a gentleman, who shall remain nameless...Sloppy Joe's, beer, coke, pork rinds, pickles, and bananas. Wonderful host and the nicest guy you could ever hope to meet, but I have to say after he announced he had thru hiked in 2018, my first impression was...if THAT guy can do it, anyone can!  I know we're not always the same person physically as the years pass, but that was the first impression that stuck with me. I bow to the man regardless after knowing what it's taken me to get this far.  That was my inspiration for the day.  Every day you pass or get passed by people that started the trail maybe a few days to a week before I started and they are still out here.  I can take inspiration from every one of them that are still at it and still trying their best. Maybe few or none of them will make it, but they're still out here slugging it out...how can I do any less.  There's a great life lesson there....you fail 100% of everything you don't have the guts to attempt. Anyway, back to my Trail Magic guy...for those that aren't out here, you have no idea what a lift it is that these people will take time and their own money to provide a morale boost that will get you up and over the next mountain.  My hats off to each and every one of them and I hope I can pay it forward myself some day.Got my shuttle to Hostel Around the Bend for a couple nights stay. Lisa and Gordon are amazing hosts and I highly recommend this place whether you're hiking or not. They personally provide shuttles to and from Unicoi and Dick's Creek Gap, as well as, into Hiawassee twice a day with a pick up an hour and 45 mins later. I stayed in the bunkhouse and had a lower bunk with privacy curtains. Very nice setup. Hot shower with all toiletries provided and self serve laundry facilities on the premises with detergent and loaner clothes provided as well. 2 buildings with common areas and kitchen facilities and several hiker resupply items.

Unicoi Gap to Dick's Creek Gap
Mile marker 52.5 to 69.2
So, sometime during the week or 2 before I started I called up Hostel Around the Bend to reserve 1 night on April 3rd, anticipating I'd be coming through there after a night in Helen with a shuttle from Unicoi Gap and a night tenting at Deep Gap Shelter.  They asked me if I needed a pickup at Unicoi or Dick's Creek Gap? I didn't realize you did pickups at Unicoi I said.  At this point, I didn't yet have a place to stay in Helen, so I told them to go ahead and book me for 2 nights...one on April 1st and 1 on April 3rd and I'd camp between those 2 nights at Deep Gap Shelter.  They responded, you know if you book 2 nights with us, we offer 'slack packing' for free.  'What's slack packing?', I say. Slack packing is where they lend you a small day pack and you then hike from Unicoi to Dick's Creek in one day.  I thought 16.7 miles on my 6th day out!  Are you crazy?  I declined the offer and remained with the 2 nights booked on 1 and 3 of April, with a camp in between.  After hanging up I looked at the profile of the hike, which had several gnarly looking up and downs over Rocky Mtn, Tray Mtn, and Kelly Knob in particular....all 3 of which would be included in my 13.3 mile hike with a full backpack to my planned camp at Deep Gap Shelter.  I thought, it's only 3.4 miles further and I would only need to carry food for the day and water and water filter...PLUS it would knock a day off my total journey!!  I immediately called back and changed my reservation to 2 consecutive nights and I would LOVE to do the slack packing option between.
Got dropped off at Unicoi Gap and started my hike at 0745.  All I could think, as the day went on was, how the hell did I think I could do the 13.3 miles to the camp as originally planned with a full backpack?!  I was dreading the Tray Mtn climb as I'd heard how hard it was, but compared to the climb from Unicoi Gap to Rocky Mtn and the Kelly Knob climb before and after Tray, Tray was a walk in the park!  By the way, I slipped and fell for the first time coming down from Rocky Mtn, so whoever had the under of 8 days before he fell on his ass, see the cashier for your winnings. I had lunch, filtered some water, and used the privy at Tray Mtn Shelter. Took a pic of the view from Tray and would have done the same from Rocky Mtn and Kelly Knob, but they pissed me off with their difficulty that I didn't even want to acknowledge their existence. They both had beautiful views btw, but you'll pay to see them, so don't say I didn't warn you.  Finally, trudged back into the hostel around 1830. 16.7 miles in 10 hrs 45 mins. Total of 4,764' up and 5,059' down. I was exhausted...feet aching...sure didn't feel like I was slacking.  Later, while contemplating my laundry...'should I separate my synthetics from the wools? How about the whites from the light or dark colors?' I snapped to the realization of 'Screw it! They're all going to be brown or black and frazzled to unusability by the time I'm done!'...and dumped them all in together. I considered taking a zero day tomorrow, but the hostel was already booked, so I'll need to move on.  Sometimes you need to be pushed out the door and on down the trail.

Dick's Creek Gap to Muskrat Creek Shelter Mile marker 69.2 to 81.0  11.8 miles
Went to bed the night before, thinking I might check if there's any availability to stay another day since my legs and feet were so sore from the day's mileage, but when I woke up, they felt pretty good...that is until I put my pack on and started up the trail, then they turned to rubber.  I should point out that my newly supplied pack with 4 days of food weighed 31 lbs, where it weighed 33 when I started....so why does it feel heavier than ever?!  And speaking of weight, the last time I weighed at home before leaving, I was at 180 lbs, the scale at the hostel said I was still 180 lbs!? I know I've not been eating enough to keep up with the burned calories daily. I DID splurge on a couple big dinners and a huge breakfast in Dahlonega before starting, so maybe that gave me a cushion that I've now lost again.  I know my pack's hip belt has been slipping more lately...especially today. I began also to have my first hiker hunger pains. Things I could do without like Welch's fruit snacks, I now pop like pez candies and iboprofen.  Anyway, back to the hike.  Trail was mostly a moderate climb...nothing terribly steep, so made decent time...for doing uphill that is.  Came across trail magic at Blue Ridge Gap from 'Bo Peep' (coke, pear, starkist white chicken packet).  Met 'Smokey' on the trail...she passed me on uphill and I passed her on downhills most of the day.  Also met again several hikers I'd been seeing off and on since camping at Lance Creek on day 3...'Mary Poppins' and her dog, Kiko, 'Just Alex', 'Sunshine', Anya from Germany, and a father/son duo from MN (never caught their names. You come across so many different people out here daily and I feel like my capacity to remember names is limited to 3 or 4 a day max...it's much easier to do if they have a trail name.So, I reached the GA/NC border around 1430 at mile marker 78.1. One state down and 13 to go.  I had initially planned to stay at Bly Gap campsite at mm 78.2, but after cameling up on water just before that I figured I had time and felt moderately good enough to press on to the next shelter, 2.9 miles ahead.  I had heard a bit about the first climbs as soon as you cross into NC, but figured I'd rather get it over with today and not have to face it first thing tomorrow.  What an idiot!  Passed a gnarly looking tree that I took a pic of and then rounded a corner to see the start of the first climb to Sharp Top.  It stood there like Gandalf at the Bridge of Kazad-dum facing the Balrog. 'You shall NOT PASS!!'  I should have taken a close up pic of the steps at the start...logs across the trail at about mid thigh for me going straight up.  'Welcome to #@%*ing NC!' as the title states.  The actual ht of each climb wasn't so bad as the actual incline itself...almost 1000 ft up in a little over a mile for the first 2 climbs to Sharp Top and Courthouse Bald with a short level section between them. They were at a rate of about 120 feet up per tenth of a mile.  These two climbs made the 2 I was bitching about the day before feel like rolling hills.  The third climb was more moderate, but coming after the first 2 it felt just as bad.  The 2.9 extra miles to Muskrat Creek Shelter took nearly 3 hours for me.  Sun getting lowwhen I got to camp, I had to scramble to find a flat spot, set up my tent, have dinner, and hang my bear bag.  First time hanging a bear bag in the back country for me and it was an adventure.  On attempted throw #3 I got the rock bag caught and wedged between the trunk of a tree and a broken off branch. Several attempts to loosen it or tug it free were unsuccessful.  Finally resigned to the fact that I'd have to sleep with my food and get eaten by a bear, so I might as well enjoy a last supper at the shelter. While fixing dinner, I was approached by 'Franklin's Mom', who asked how I was doing. 'Not to good', I said. 'I'm going to get eaten by a bear tonight.'  Explained my situation and before you knew it there were 3 of us now putting together resolution to the bear bag puzzle. The guy tenting next to me finally was able to loop the rope up over the broken branch and freed the bag....something I had tried repeatedly, but obviously with not as good technique. I'm amazed at how quickly complete strangers will come to someone's rescue out here.  Anyway, second attempt to hang was successful and I was eating dinner as twilight was upon me.  Got cold, very fast as the sun went down here.  This was probably the highest altitude campsite I have stayed at.  Actually seemed to warm up as the night went on and got some decent sleep, despite my aching legs and feet from the last 3 miles especially.

Decent night's rest.  Woke up and headed to the privy to take care of morning business.  Retrieved my bear bag when I got back to the tent and had breakfast in the tent (Peak Mountain Berries Granola).  Packed up my things and took down my tent in what felt like slow motion.  Had decided after the climb yesterday that I needed to slow down a bit a take a day off...especially considering I just ran out of vitamin I (ibuprofen), and there's an expected thunderstorm coming through tomorrow.  Got on the trail around 0830 after filling up on water and preceded to take a leisurely 4 mile hike to Deep Gap, the first access road that you can get off on to get to Franklin, NC.  Got the number to shuttle driver, Bobby the Greek, from comments in the FarOut app and proceeded to try to text him for the next 3 miles...waiting for just a sliver of a bar of service to get a text through.  Finally, got through to him and he was actually at Deep Gap this very moment waiting on a couple women, who had scheduled with him the night before.  I busted into high gear and did the last, mostly downhill mile in about 25 mins. JP also was there getting a ride from Bobby the Greek, as well as a guy who was in the Hostel I was at 3 nights before. More on him later...   We waited for these women for well past their 11am scheduled pickup time...as a matter of fact 2 hikers that had a scheduled pickup at 1230 arrived and ended up shuttling with us.  Bobby also called hotels for us with his phone that had service so we could book rooms.  Finally, not being able to wait any longer since he had other pickups scheduled through 7pm he had to leave them with messages to others that he'd be back later if they still needed a ride.  If you're calling someone to pick you up in the middle of the woods, YOU should allow yourself plenty of time and get there early, so they don't have to wait on you. You're the one with the leisure time.  The shuttle drivers are committing themselves to picking people from numerous trail heads all day long for a price that may barely cover their gas costs these days.  Bobby charges $60 a shuttle and the more people that can fit in, the cheaper it is. We ended up with 5. Back to the other guy who I'd met at the hostel 3 days before....  For every dozen or so nice, gracious, and fun people you meet out here there's at least one like this guy that you just want to get as much distance between you and them as you can within 5 minutes of meeting them.  Enough said. LOL I booked a room at the Sapphire Inn in Franklin for 2 nights.  Not the worst dive I've ever stayed in, but infinitely far from the best.  It was a bed and shower...that's what matters at this point.  Filled the tub with hot water and had a nice long soak.  Had lunch at a Mexican place across the road and walked in to old downtown Franklin. Dropped by Outdoor 76 outfitters who gave me a free buff for being a thru hiker and signed their Thru Hiker Class of 2022 board.  They didn't have ibuprofen, AAA batteries or a knee support to replace the cheaper Walgreens knock off I currently have, so I mosied on down the road and had a beer at Lazy Hiker Brewery...an Apricot Orange Pilsner...2 thumbs up. Ran into 'Franklin's Mom' here, who had helped me with my bear bag the night before also.  Walked back to hotel, stopping at a Dollar store along the way for my much needed ibuprofen, AAA batteries and, some coke zeros, chips, and summer sausage for the hotel stay. Rest of my evening was making phone calls and catching up on these journal entries.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Slept in this morning and then I stayed in bed some more. Caught up on some logging, rested the legs and feet, and did some soul searching.  Caught up on some phone calls to friends and family.  Kind of feel I've been pushing my pace a bit aggressively for an old hobbit here recently, though 59 yrs old is not considered old for a hobbit. LOL  But I do need to pull back on the throttle a bit until my body tells me it wants more.  Pick a target to get to each day and stick to it and just hope I can ramp the mileage up later to catch up with the goal avg, but the chips will fall where they may.When you start a hike like this, there's a heavy social bond you get with what I'll call your home room group. Everyone hiking this year is considered the Thru-hiking Class of 2022, but the group of people you start with kind of become your homeroom class.  It's usually a group that starts on the same day, like the 3/27 group (the day Istarted), but it could be some that lagged from previous days.  A lot will keep that pace you're advised to do of no more than 7-8 miles a day for the first week or so, which keeps that core group together. As the days pass though, some lag behind and others start to reach out and stretch for more miles and the group begins to disperse. What I felt I was doing was trying to stretch myself out to keep up with some that were starting to push their mileage up.  I was getting there, but it was wearing me out trying to keep a pace my body wasn't ready for yet and I was trudging in to camp later and later each day.  So, I need to reset to what I came out here for, which is to hike, my hike, enjoy it as long as I can and cherish every moment out here, cause you never know when it might have to end.  I wish all those in my homeroom well on their hikes and if it's fated to be, we'll meet again down the trail. I look forward to and hope for everyone of those encounters, but I need to stop chasing after them.  So, I've got a shuttle scheduled to pick me up at 0815 tomorrow morning and drop me off back where I left yesterday. I have resupplied for 3 days and that may be my standard for the foreseeable future.  Planning 3 days and 2 nights out and then get off at Winding Stair Gap and come back to Franklin for a night.  Got some new lightweight waterproof mittens from Outdoor Research at Outdoor 76 this afternoon to keep the hands dry and warm while hiking.  Dinner tonight back at MiCasa across the street.  Catch you all later.

Not much sleep last night.  I believe the AT hiker's drug suppliers was in the room next to me.  Almost constant party going on on the balcony right outside my door.  Had to stick my head out twice through the night to ask for the party to move elsewhere.  All part of the thru hiking experience?  Never heard about this part before.  LOL  Got picked up at the hotel by Bobby the Greek at 0815.  Was out on the trail at Deep Gap around 0920.  Foggy, cool morning.  Actual easy grade up to the top of Standing Indian Mtn, but was a white out...foggy and no views.  Easy grade down off the mtn also, but had to negotiate a lot of blow down from recent storms...maybe the one the blew threw Franklin yesterday.  Passed a work crew that were out clearing the trail from north to south.  What a thankless job...all volunteer workers through the local AT support club.  Thanked them anyway for all the work they do for the hikers.  Trail was MUCH easier to negotiate after passing them.  Calves tightened up today...felt a little tweak in both of them and slowed way down...felt like they were going to snap at any misstep.  Got to Carter Gap and met Franklin's Mom, Nemo, Goat, Gabby, and Rawhide.  Set up camp, got water, cooked dinner, and hung my bear bag successfully.  Time for Prone Hobbit...lack of sleep last night hit me and I was out until the rain came through around 9 or 10.  Some lightning and pretty heavy rain at times, but no hail or high winds, so grateful for that.  Rest of the night, uneventful and QUIET!!!

Rained pretty heavy for a bit overnight, but inside of tent stayed dry.  Had some condensation drip on the quilt, but not to bad...it dried out quickly.  Very messy/muddy pack up of the tent though.  Hit the trail with a goal of Long Branch Shelter at mm 102.2(8.7 miles).  Foggy morning when I started, which cleared off to a beautiful view of cloud filled valley below at the first overlook I came to.  Rest of the trail was a nice easy grade....that is until the climb to Albert Mtn that rivals the first climbs entering NC.  Easier to ditch the poles on this one and climb hand and foot. About 400 ft elevation gain in 3 tenths of a mile. THANKFULLY, there was a reward of a great view at the fire tower and the first marker that 100 miles had been crossed...unofficially.  Passed an official 100 in the trail a short time later pieced together with rocks and maybe sticks...can't remember...I got a pic though. Easy hike to Long Branch Shelter and was it only 2:30pm....legs felt good, so decided to press on to Rock Gap, 3.4 miles further.  Arrived around 4:30 and wished I'd stayed back at Long Branch.  Far and away the worst shelter and tent sites I've encountered, so far.  Set my tent up twice, but never could really find a spot level that it would fit.  Made for a miserable night trying to catch catnaps before I'd begin sliding or rolling downhill in the tent.  In hindsight, the next time I won't bother setting up the tent. There was only 1 person in the shelter and even if it was kinda shabby, at least it had a level floor to sleep on.  Only redeeming qualities for this site were a privy with actually a view and a water source that was right behind the shelter.  Just say NO, to Rock Gap.

Another redeeming quality about Rock Gap Shelter...just 1 tenth of a mile down the trail, you can get picked up by a shuttle in to Franklin for $5. Or, you can also hike just 3.8 more miles and get picked up at Winding Stair Gap by the same shuttle.  Since I had the time and would need to do those 3.8 miles anyway, I opted to get started early and try to make it to Winding Stair Gap for the 0930 shuttle.  I woke up early (or did I ever really sleep) and got to packing before 0630. Hit the privy and retrieved my bearbag and got packed and on the trail by 0732...skipping breakfast!  I'll eat a Cliff Bar on the way as I can't get out of this campsite soon enough.  Fairly easy grade starting off and as soon as I got signal, I called and booked a room at the Microtel Inn, as I envisioned there would be a lot of hikers getting off trail due to the snow and below freezing temperatures forecast the next 2 days. Also, I didn't want to get stuck in the drug dealers hotel again!  This set me back in my rush to catch the 0930 shuttle a bit.  I also hit a pretty steep climb at Wallace Gap and feared I wouldn't make the shuttle.  Once the incline let off a bit I was able to kick into high gear(for me) and was back on track.  At 0921 I was in eyesight of the trailhead parking and could see the shuttle pulling OUT!! SOB!!!  What shuttles in the country EVER run AHEAD of schedule!!  Luckily, it was on its way to Rock Gap, where I had been last night and it passed back by on its way back to town and stopped to pick me up.  Got to my hotel around 1015 and checked in, but was told my room might not be ready until 3pm.  Guess I didn't really need to hurry.  Realized my gloves were missing and called the shuttle service to see if anyone had turned them in...they had them and said they'd be back around 1130 and I could pick them up from the driver then.  Whew!!  Hotel let me leave my pack in the breakfast area at the hotel(with several other packs already) and went to eat next door at FATZ!  Sounds like my kinda place!  Buttermilk breaded fried chicken breaststroke with country gravy, mashed potatoes, creamy grits, cole slaw, and sweet tea.  Got my room around 2pm I think and took a tub soak followed by a shower.  Haven't soaked in a tub in years and now twice in less than a week!  Walked a couple blocks over to Three Eagles Outfitters to pick up a couple backpacker's dinners and a breakfast for resupply. Stopped by Walgreens on the way back to the hotel and picked up some chips and couple cokes.  Rest of the day was resting and journaling.  Slight snow flurries today in Franklin, cold and a bit windy.  Just glad I'm not back at Rock Gap Shelter!","Rock Gap Shelter

Decent night's sleep. Still hard to sleep in a new place so far. At least no drug parties and exchanges outside my door!  Waffles at the hotel for breakfast.  After some extra lounging, I decided I needed to find a place to do some laundry.  Was told there was a place just down the street past the Lowes.  Threw all my clothes, less the shorts, underwear, socks, and tshirt I was wearing into my stuff sack, donned my puffy jacket, knee supports and boots and headed off like a trailer trash Santa Claus.  Snow flurries kicked up but surprisingly kept warm due to a very nice puffy jacket and the knee supports actually providing some warmth to my legs.  I LOVE when I have items that can serve dual purposes when you're packing minimalisticly. Knee supports that also provide insulation...a puffy jacket that's also a great pillow.  And then there's my rain gear....more on that in a bit.  So, the just past Lowes laundromat happened to be at least a mile walk.  Upon arriving, I was told washing was $2/load and drying was $1. 50 cents for a soap pod.  So, I can either wash and dry a load, change clothes and wash and dry a second small load consisting of the clothes I'm wearing, OR I can choose option 2. I  slipped into the bathroom, stripped out of all my clothes and donned my rain pants, puffy jacket and boots only. Every thing else went into the stuff sack and then into the washer.  And that's how I hung out waiting for 1 load to wash and dry. True hiker trash!  Yet another item with a dual purpose...rain gear to also wear on laundry day!! Decided after wash was done to not even bother changing back, so walked the mile plus back in the same jacket, rain pants, and boots only...through heavier snow flurries I might add.  Even stopped at Sonic and ordered lunch on my way back. Freedom!!  Back at the hotel, I took my tent out back and unfurled it to shake/brush off a bunch of the mud and leaves.  Met 'Money Stash' and 'Nug'.  Can't wait to find those name origins if I can.  Resupplied ibuprofen at Walgreens and dinner back at FATZ for baby back ribs. Tomorrow I'm back on the trail and headed to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) where I have a reservation for 1 night. Will take 3 days to get there at mm 136.9.  Tomorrow is A LOT of uphill for 11 miles with a full pack. Another big test...most worried that I won't get started until around 0930, since that's the first shuttle...maybe it's early again!  3 days after that is Fontana Dam and then I enter Smokey Mountain NP.

Up at 0700 and packing at the hotel.  Waffles for breakfast at the hotel and proceeded to wait out front at 0830 for the 0900 shuttle to Winding Stair Gap. By 0915 and no shuttle and several others being picked up in front of me but other shuttle drivers, I went in to check if I needed to call to get a pickup. Hotel receptionist then told me that the shuttle doesn't operate on the weekends! Had to scramble to get a ride and Bobby the Greek bailed me out once again. Whew!!  Wanted to get an early start for a relatively long day with some big climbs, but wasn't able to get out to the trail until 1000.  Legs feeling very good today.  A sharp pain in my back/shoulder blade area had hit me and been bothering me off and on since the day before yesterday seemed to disappear also when I started hiking.  This was the first day that everything felt good for most of it and I, quite honestly, felt for the first time like I could actually finish the hike.  I had always hoped I could, but the realist in me knew that there are many unforseen pitfalls that can happen and that the odds are not in my favor.  For now, I felt like I could conquer anything put in front of me though.  Good thing I felt that way, cause there was still a lot of snow on the ground on and off the trail and as the day warmed up, the snow melt made the trail sloppier and sloppier. A LOT of slick mud and water to slog through all day long....THIS is why I wear heavier waterproof boots!  They ARE heavier and take a toll on the legs because of it, but I also hiked the entire day with dry feet despite all the mud and water I had to trudge through.  Had lunch at an old picnic area between Siler Bald and Wayah Bald at approx 115.2mm.  Absolutely magnificent views from the top of Wayah Bald.  Stone tower here built by the same people that built the Blood Mtn Shelter that I passed by on day 4.  Got to camp a bit before 5pm, but not many places left to set up a tent.  At this point I want to mention one of my first pet peeves I've seen on the trail...that is hammock campers that take up tent sites when all they need is a couple trees to string their hammock between.  They don't need and should NOT be taking up flat tent sites!!  Just my opinion and I'm sure will be rebutted by someone reading this.  Had to go down trail a bit and off into the woods for find a spot fairly flat.  Bright spot is that it was well sheltered from any wind and the ground was very soft and spongy under a lot of discarded nutshells from squirrels feeding.  While setting up tent/camp, my back/shoulder pain returned with a vengeance. Set up, cooked dinner up at the shelter and hit the privy while there.  Back at tent, bearbag hung, and in bed by 8pm.  Popping way to many ibuprofen to try to get the shoulder pain to go away though.  :(

Fairly restless night's sleep cause of my shoulder/back and hard time getting going in the morning to pack and break camp because of it.  On the trail by 0900 though, but was hoping for around 0800 to try to get to Wesser Bald Shelter early and get a good campsite.  Oh well, I didn't do bad last night finding one off the beaten path.  Once again, the pain in my shoulder has kind of gone away while I'm hiking, but any time I stop to sit down and rest it comes back...very demoralizing.  Made pretty good time hiking though...trail a lot less muddy and messy than yesterday...and got to top of Wesser Bald before 2pm at 130.2mm. Decided by this time that I felt my shoulder needed some rest, so I called the NOC to see if I they had vacancies for tonight.  I was in luck and they were wide open apparently, so I booked the extra night to try to get some better rest for my back/shoulder.  I was planning to hike a short day tomorrow anyway into the NOC and spend the night there tomorrow night.  That's what's referred to as a NERO, or near ZERO day.  A zero is of course, no miles on the trail at all.  A NERO is considered to be only a few miles before getting off trail in a town or getting on trail later in the afternoon after leaving a town and camping after only a few miles.  For me a NERO is considered to be anything less that about 5-7 miles on the trail now before getting off.  Anyway, by changing today to a long hike into the NOC, it makes tomorrow a ZERO day instead of a NERO.  Either way, I'd still be getting back on trail on the same day, so I wasn't really losing any time...I'm just hiking an extra 6-7 miles today.  Looking at the topo map, all of the miles appeared to be going downhill also...so easy peasy, right?  HA...Boy was I wrong!  After passing Wesser Bald Shelter(my intended stop for the night), the trail turned into a very narrow knife's edge ridge for about a mile and a half.  Not a big deal except there was a lot of blowdown littered across the trail I assume still from the wind storm that went through the area way back on night 4 of my hike. The fact that it was on a knife's edge ridge, meant there wasn't a lot of room to try to get around the fallen trees and brush across the trail.  A lot of these 1.5 miles was like trying to get through a jungle gym obstacle course.  At the end of this was a feature called the JumpOffs, which was quite literally a cliff.  The trail then wasn't so much of a trail as it was a zigzagging down a cliff face with drops from boulder to boulder of up to 4-5 feet at a time in places.  Combine that with still some slick mud in places for the landing sites from the recent snow melt and it made for quite a nerve racking descent.  Once I got past this section, the rest was just a very steep, knee pounding downhill that never seemed to stop or relent until I got to the NOC finally between 1730 and 1800.  I dropped my pack outside the General Store and proceeded inside to check-in.  The clerk greeted me with, 'You look like you desperately need a place to stay'. I was, I'm sure, quite disheveled looking.  I did ask if the NOC had a chiropractor or massage therapist anywhere on the premises...alas no, not this year.  Apparently there was a massage therapist in the area last year.  Anyway, I checked in, bought 3 bottles of Coke Zero and a bag of chips, slammed down one Coke Zero outside, and crossed the street to get dinner at River's End restaurant before they closed at 7pm...a Wesser Burger and Gorge Fries.  After dinner, crossed the bridge over the Nantahala River and up the hill on the other side to my hotel unit, which I pretty much had to myself.  Very nice place...unfortunately the back/shoulder pain was back and despite the nice bed I could not get to sleep until approx 4am.  Glad I'm not doing anything tomorrow and hoping the back/shoulder resolves itself.

When I started this hike quite honestly I never really thought I'd be able to finish it.  The odds are never in your favor even for a fit middle aged person, which I'm not. LOL  I merely wanted to test my limits and enjoy it as long as I could.  My last stay in Franklin a sharp pain started behind my right shoulder blade that made it even more difficult to lie down, let alone sleep.  When I got on the trail the next day, it had dissipated and I was actually hiking both uphill and down the best I have done so far.  For the first time I actually thought I could complete this thing.  When I got to Wayah Bald Shelter and set up camp the pain had returned with a vengeance though.  Another restless nights sleep. The next day I was planning to only hike 10.6 miles, but the prospect of another sleepless night prompted me to go ahead and push to the NOC at 16.5 miles, in hopes that sleep in a bed would help.  Pain still lingering and couldn't get to sleep until past 4am and 3 more ibuprofen...which I'm taking too much of.  Bottom line, I believe it's time to get off the trail and get my body right. I now know my limits both physically and for enjoyment of backpacking and can say without a doubt that it's about 2 weeks tops. 🙂  I personally have no regrets or sadness at ending my adventure. I really only worry that I might be disappointing others that were following along vicariously.  I tried in my journal entries to always be positive about my experience, but make no mistake, this is a hard trail...rated physically harder than both the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails.  It was/is a lot of steep up and down grind every day that takes a toll on you physically and mentally. There wasn't a day that passed where I didn't ask myself at one point or another, 'What the hell are you doing out here?!'  Feet, knees, ankles, hips, back, shoulders, neck, and hands all took turns barking at me for attention. The mental grind of going to bed cold, waking up cold, worrying about if there was going to be a place to set up my tent at each destination, or room at the hostel or hotel when I went to town, takes a toll also. Would I be able to find a shuttle to get me to town or back to the trailhead? What was the weather going to be?  I managed to miss a very violent wind and thunderstorm on night 4 that I worked through trees and debris that were blown down across the trail all the way to my current location.  I also was lucky enough to miss a snow storm that dumped anywhere from 3-6 inches depending on where you were on the trail. In short the trail had already become a grind without even considering the aches and pains.  Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed the experience as a whole, immensely!  I just feel that I've seen enough to satisfy my curiosity and test my limits.  I do believe I will jump in my car soon after getting home, throw the backpack in and possibly travel up the trail corridor to visit some spots I was looking forward to seeing and maybe enjoying a few abbreviated jaunts on the trail.  I already had the time carved out, so why not utilize it.  My hat goes off to all that even attempt a thru hike, let alone those that complete it, cause I know what it takes just to plan and get started.  I met a lot of great people during my time there and I wish them the best of luck to get everything out of this experience that they hope, whether it's a completed hike or not. Again, I have no regrets in ending my hike now....only fear that I may be letting some of you down in some way.  The mantra out there is always 'Hike YOUR Hike!'  I've done that and mine just happens to have come to an end after 137 miles in 16 days.

Rode with my friend and former coworker, Bobby Farrell, from Atlanta to Roan Mtn, TN and caught a shuttle at The Station Hostel at 19E to Sam's Gap.  This was where Bobby was originally going to meet me for a few days on the trail.  By the time we got to Sam's Gap it was already 3pm.  Good pace on the initial climb. Short day and mileage on the trail, but back/shoulder held up fine. Set up tent, dug a cat hole in the woods, ate a couple energy bars and a PB & Honey wrap, hung my bear bag and in the tent to sleep at 2030.  Back in the saddle again!","Sam's Gap

Not much sleep through the night, so was already awake and ready to start the day when my alarm went off at 0530.  Started the trail a little after 7am.  Three tough climbs to Big Bald, Little Bald, and High Rocks.  Absolutely spectacular views from the top of Big Bald.  A Bald, for those not follicly challenged, is a mountain that has no trees on top of it.  I half expect Julie Andrews to come dancing across the grassy top singing, 'The HILLS are alive, with the Sound of Music!'  Breathtaking! Partly cloudy morning and a lot of Jacob's Ladder sun beams casting onto the mountains and valleys below like spotlights from heaven.  Back to the trail...for something that spectacular, you have to pay for it....the 3 climbs and 2 very steep descents from Little Bald and High Rocks and I felt it was still a bargain.  For a change the AT did not go directly over a peak and there was a side trail to the top of High Rocks.  We were both to exhausted to take it and thankfully another hiker coming down said it really wasn't worth the extra climb....to many trees covering the view on this one.  Visited the Bald Mtn Shelter, as it was advertised as the last shelter with a privy for quite some time. It barely could be called a privy.  As short as my legs are I think my knees stuck out of the doorless....privy?  Thought that word meant private?  Despite my best efforts, I could not take advantage of this privy.  Originally we were planning to stop at Whistling Gap campsite, but Bobby said his legs were feeling good enough to press on another 2.2 miles over High Rocks and down to Spivey Gap.  Filled up on water before we got there from a trickle of a stream and conserved water through the night only to find a gushing creek less than 100 yards down the trail the next morning.  Nice flat tentsites and I gave this campsite a 2 logs down rating based on the number of cat holes I had to dig the next morning.

Got on trail a bit later than hoped...I guess that meant I slept better....or maybe cause I had to dig TWO cat holes!  Filled up water after donning packs and hiking a total of 100 yards and realizing there was a fully flowing stream right there.  Steady, but not to steep of a hike up out of Spivey Gap.  Pretty easy day with the exception of a steep, long downhill into Erwin.  My phone fell off my backpack, where I stupidly set it and hit a rock, face down.  I now have a pierced hole in my screen and some cracks.  I think I got the insurance on it, knowing the perils I was about to take it through, but I'll probably wait until I have the time to check it out and swap it. As long as it's still working, no need in imperiling another one.  Stopped at No Business Knob Shelter for lunch.  Where the hell does that name come from?  The best I could com up with was that the previous shelter was the last one to have a privy, so maybe 'No Business done here'?  Who knows.   Ran into some spotty rain on the descent to Erwin, but cleared up and got sunny for some awesome views of the Nolichucky River.  That's what I  said... Nolichucky ....even I can't make that up.  Arrived in Erwin at Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel at 3pm.  Bought FOUR Cokes and while sitting in front of the hostel, the first trail magic I've come across since GA pulled up in the form of a van and proceeded to unload a full spread of hamburgers, hotdogs, potato salad, slaw....all the fixings and I don't know how many cakes, pies, cupcakes and other desserts...right to the picnic tables I was sitting at, enjoying my cokes.  Met Bobby coming down with a cold coke. Did some food resupply at Uncle Johnny's and caught a shuttle to Mountain Inn and Suites for the night.  Large Mexican dinner near the hotel and called it a night.","Spivey Gap

Up at 7ish for Continental breakfast. Side note...why is it called Continental when it's usually so small?  Was given a number to call for a shuttle by the driver who dropped us off yesterday, but was told the office didn't open until 0830.  Called at 0845 and it was an invalid number.  Called Uncle Johnny's and they said a shuttle wouldn't be available until 1030.  We decided to just hoof it for the approx 1 mile.  About 2/3 way there, a gentleman stopped and offered us a ride...trail magic again!  Got to Uncle Johnny's about 0930 and hit the trail late around 1030 after Bobby did some resupply and bought a new water filter.  Met 'Big Mike', who stayed in my cabin all the way back at Neel Gap...his trail name is now 'Footlong'.  I intended to ask where he got that name...flashbacks to an old Tom Hanks movie called 'Bachelor Party' kept jumping into both Bobby and my minds.  Also, had eun into 'Rawhide' here, who I had met on the trail in early NC. He was working at Uncle Johnny's now while rehabbing a broken foot that he sustained at Clingman's Dome in the Smokies and hiked to Erwin before he got it looked at.  
Back to the hike...we intended to do about a 12 mile avg to get to Roan Mtn in time for Bobby to get home, but the late start did not help and we had to stop at Indian Grave Gap after only 8.4 miles. Camped at a VERY stealth site up the hill from Indian Grave Gap...looked like it might have been a campsite about 10 or more years ago, as it was very overgrown.  Got water down the road at the Gap and met another hiker named Gandalf!  Of course, others had to get a pic of Bilbo and Gandalf.  Back at camp, I think it might have been the best night's sleep on all those leaves.
As far as the title goes, the AT has its own language that is essentially just 'I Am Root'. Everywhere on the trail are roots....sometimes the trail is ONLY on roots.  Sometimes it actually means, 'I am rock' or 'I am mud', but there are always roots just waiting to trip you or grab you hiking poles.  You can converse with the trail every day if you know the language.  'Hey, AT! What do you have in store for me today?'  AT: ""I AM rooT!""  Me: ""Oh, ok...so some early rain making a muddy, sloppy afternoon descent and a few boulder fields to traverse?"" AT: ""I am Root!"", Me: ""Oh yeah, and lots of Roots.""

Got up and broke camp a bit after 0800.  Brief hike down to the Gap and then back to a Relentless uphill. About 15 mins +/-, I heard Bobby calling from behind.  He came up and just admitted that his legs were not going to be able to do 13+ miles today, which is kind of the minimum needed to get him back to his car on time to head home.  Believe me, I get it!  Bobby can and has hiked circles around me on past trips, but unfortunately he didn't have the opportunity to get broken in on the AT as I had.  I honestly had forgotten that the recommended mileage to start an AT hike is 7-9 miles a day avg for at least the first week. It really was never fair to Bobby or anyone coming on the trail to try to keep up with someone that's already had the breaking in period. To top that off, this section we picked has turned out to be about the toughest I've encountered for this length of mileage.  I just always thought...'This is Bobby...he'll hike circles around me and I was actually worried coming in that I'd not be able to keep up with him.  This just proves that this is a tough hike and it needs prep and some low mileage to begin with to ramp up to speed.As it stood, Bobby had to call for a shuttle to pick him up back at Indian Grave Gap.  I hated to see him go....it has been great fun hiking with him again, but I completely understand how he feels...been there and done that my first couple weeks.  Difference is...he had a time deadline where I could have and did just tap the brakes and take a day off.  I greatly appreciate Bobby not only coming to hike with me, but actually providing me a ride from ATL to get me back on the trail....forever grateful!  Back to the hike...I can definitely say, Bobby, it certainly didn't get any easier.  I did 13.2, mostly uphill miles over Beauty Spot and then Unaka Mtn.  The views from Beauty Spot were particularly outstanding!  Long range view down into Erwin.  Not much of a view from Unaka, but the top was a very quiet and peaceful spruce forest.  Only downer here was that my Aquaclip broke when dismounting my pack here for a rest. The Aquaclip is a device from zPacks that clips to the neck of your water bottle and keeps it right in front of your shoulder strap for easy access.  Maybe get another one in Damascus.  Continued on at a trudging pace to a meadow leading to a piped spring and stopped to camp there as planned.  Speaking of a trudging pace, once again, came across a fellow thru hiker that we had been leapfrogging with since she camped with us on our first night on the trail, 4/29.  Asked her her trail name and she said it was 'Trudge'.  I could easily have that name if Bilbo had not already been established.  Legs were beat by the end of the day and my index toe on my right foot is one huge blister.  I will more than likely lose that toenail, as well as, the big toenail on that foot.  The left foot looks like it could eventually have the same fate.  Thunder and dark clouds are threatening as I retreat to my tent for the night.

Woke up to the sound of rain on the tent.  My only blessing is that I didn't have to go to the bathroom. Went back to sleep waiting for the rain to stop and woke up after 8am.  Very little energy today and hard getting motivated with the rain.  Finally caught a break, packed up, and hit the trail around 1100...latest start ever. Lack of energy transferred to the trail.  Rain off and on did not help the attitude and energy level either.  Slogged and trudged through near 5 miles before arriving at Clyde Smith Shelter and stopped to rest....already 1530!  A few other hikers came and went and I finally just decided to rest and stay in the shelter for my first time.  Only 2 other young guys from Atlanta showed to stay in the shelter so it was nice and uncrowded...especially since it had upper bunks.  Hoping a good night's sleep will help my energy level.  Need a longer day tomorrow and have to get over Roan Mtn at over 6200 ft. This was basically a day that I was ready to head home after.  Forgot also that just cause it's a shelter, it does not protect you from mosquitoes.

Woke up early and was able to pack quickly with no tent to break down. Cooked scrambled eggs and put them on a tortilla for a breakfast burrito on Cinco de Mayo. Got started before 8am, with a short climb and downhill to Hughes Gap. Dreading all the while the long climb over Roan Mtn.  As I descended to Hughes Gap I caught sight of a Uhaul and a large tent....TRAIL MAGIC!!!!  Dropped my pack and as I approached the tent a guy asked, how many eggs do you want?  Stunned, I said 3?!  ""Coming right up! How do you want your yokes cooked?""  Break em and cook em hard!  While my eggs were cooking I could help myself to fruit(grapes, oranges, pineapple) and sodas. Beer also available and I WOULD endulge on the trail, but I trip on enough roots and rocks as it is without any impairment. So, 3 Cinco de Mayo breakfast tacos were served to me with the eggs, grilled peppers and onions, avocado, and salsa. Better than the Mexican food I had in Erwin 3 or 4 days ago.  It's amazing what a pickup Trail Magic can give you...I went from dreading the ascent of Roan to tackling it head on.  The energy level pickup is indescribable.  I actually enjoyed the climb up Roan.  It turned into a pine forest that the trail wove its way up through....very pretty climb if not a lot of views.  Beautiful, sunny day climbing in the cool forest....Bad attitude from the day before was gone!  Then I descended the other side...filled up on water at a spring and shortly thereafter I emerged from the pine forest to a road access and stark lack of trees as the trail climbed over 2 bald summits and skirted a third.  Now the sun that filtered through the cool forest, was burning down on the completely exposed trail.  Making matters worse was a more difficult rock scramble up dirt sided gullies for a trail. All more difficult and harder than the climb up Roan.  Maybe my trail magic high was just expended.  Trudged through the last 4 miles of my near 14 mile day to reach a full shelter at Stan Murray shelter.  Thankfully, I got first choice of tent sites. Water source was a brutal downhill to a mere trickle of water.  Took several minutes to fill one 2 liter bladder.  Got pretty cold as the sun went down and very windy, but only a few gusts down in the shelter site...sounds ominous though...something is blowing in.

Something did blow in and boy did it. Rain started during the night with gusts of wind and cooler temps. Got up fairly early and had to practically sprint downhill in off and on rain to do part deux before I dug a cathole....did not have time! Back in the tent, I packed up everything I could inside and waited for a break in the rain.  I actually let most of the kids in the shelter clear out and took my pack there to pack up everything while out of the rain.  Back and forth from tent to shelter with each item, then waited for a bit of a break before breaking down the tent and pulling up the ground cloth.  The wind was blowing a foggy mist through the trees like some kind of Stephen King movie.  Finally got packed, got the rain cover on the pack and donned my rain jacket, pants, and mittens.  One of my favorite items has to be these lightweight rain pants. I rigged the cuff to have a bungy cord in the seam so I can pull the cuff over the ankle of my boots. If nothing else, my feet and socks stay dry since the boots are waterproof from the ankle down.  Pants keep the legs dry and the jacket does also, but no matter how much you open the vent zipper under the arms, you sweat profusely in the jacket while hiking...so you aren't wet from rain, but you are soaked from sweat. The hike was mostly downhill, with the exception of 2 very steep climbs up Little Hump Mtn and Hump Mtn, both of which were balds and making you completely exposed to the elements. As soon as I came out of the trees heading up Little Hump, I was met with extreme winds from my right to left that at times felt like they would blow me over.  This exposure was the conditions I hiked in from that moment until well past getting over the second of the 2 climbs over Hump Mtn.  Wisps of clouds whipped across the balds and I felt like I was hiking on the Scottish Moors.  I was reminded of a scene in Young Frankenstein where Dr Frankenstein and Igor were digging up a body in a grave.  The doctor comments on what a filthy disgusting business it was and Igor comments that it could be worse. ""HOW?"" asks the good Dr. ""It could be raining"" answers Igor, where upon lightning strikes and they are immediately doused by a deluge of rain.  All the way up Little Hump, all I had to deal with was the hurricane winds and I thought...at least it's not raining.  On my way up Hump Mtn I heard thunder in the distance and yes it started raining.  Wind still blowing, rain falling sideways made visibility about 20-30 yards. I could see the trail continuously climbing into the mist. Keep in mind also, the last place you want to be in a lightning storm is on top of a bald mountain where even I am the tallest object.  I picked up my pace from snail to tortoise...sweating profusely, heading up, up up, for God only knows hold long as I could never see a summit.  Eventually, I could tell I'd flattened off and started down at an urgent pace.  What seemed like an eternity later, trees started falling in around me and the wind began being broken up by them.  I foolishly paused at this time to turn around and give the mountain/trail/weather a curtive FU!  Mistake!  I wasn't out of the woods yet, figuratively or literally. Now the trail was a muddy, soupy, slippery slope the rest of the way. I  heard, ""I  AM Root!""  'Yeah, I know...you're also mud, rain, wind....and I'm sorry I cursed at you.'  Roots and rocks, steep downhill slopes, boulder/landslide fields to cross were all that awaited me most of the rest of the way down. Whoever had my first slip and fall of my reentry to the trail at under 8 days, please once again see the lady at the window for your winnings. The sun came out briefly when I reached a place called Doll Flats where I crossed out of NC for the last time. The rest of the trail was fairy uneventful though I still had some rocks to climb down on the way.  I was even able to remove my rain jacket.  Finally, reaching the road, I tempted fate and turned and gave another curse towards the trail Gods. I called the hostel to see if I could be picked up and was told the shuttle was not currently available, but they were only a half mile up the road.  As I hung up and looked uphill in that direction, it started raining again. Donning the rain jacket once again, I began my slow trudge uphill to the hostel.  On the bright side, about an hour after checking in and sitting in the pub downstairs eating a wonderful Reuben sandwich, the skies outside darkened and hail began to rain down.  At least I wasn't out when that happened!  Others, weren't so lucky though and throughout the rest of the day hiker after hiker trudged in having endured more than I had gone through.  At the end of the day, I was really quite grateful and had no business complaining even after all I'd endured.  Rain still forecast for tomorrow, I'm taking a zero day just the same.  No sense tempting fate.

Up early and packed before breakfast at the hostel.  Caught the first shuttle to the trailhead after breakfast and on the trail by 0830.  Fully aware that today was Mother’s Day, mom was in the back of my mind all day long and I only melted down briefly once when the trail passed by a cemetery, 3 miles into the hike.  Took some pictures and some time to recompose myself.  The hike, like life must go on however…Happy Mother’s Day, Mom! 
Met and hiked with Ducky off and on all day and her stuffed mascot, Wilson, who was ironically a stuffed duck.  I’m sure that’s where her trail name came from.  Ducky would take pics of Wilson at various sites, similar to a ‘Flat Stanley’ project.  For those unaware of what a ‘Flat Stanley’ is, it’s a paper cutout of a guy named Stanley, which has been a trendy grade school project for a few decades.  The grade school child colors and cuts out a picture of ‘Stanley’, or ‘Sheila’ or ‘insert name here’, depending on the gender or name preference.  ‘Stanley’ is then mailed to a family member or friend…the more distant this person is, the better.  Said family member’s duty is to then cart ‘Stanley’ around to areas he/she frequents and sites near where they live and take pictures of ‘Stanley’ visiting these sites.  Stanley and the pics are then mailed back to the student so that they can present them to their class in a bit of ‘Show and Tell’.  So, as you can see, the further away that you can have Stanley visit, the more interesting it is for your show and tell.  I believe I got two Stanleys (mine were Flat Maddie and Flat Mahalia) from a couple of my nieces over the years.  I showed them at work, lounging on my deck, and in front of my beer bottle collection!  I'm a great uncle, aren't I?!  :)    
Back to the hike…   Legs and endurance felt pretty strong all day long.  Actually, felt strong enough to take side trails to off trail views and sights…so, took the 0.1 mile side trail to Jones Falls, which was well worth the trip.  Very scenic waterfall.  Enjoyed a snack at the falls and took pictures for Ducky and Wilson.  Crossed the northbound trail marker for 400 miles…my mileage is considerably less than that due to the section I skipped during my shoulder issue.  Stopped for a few more pics at Mountaineer Falls…not near as scenic as Jones Falls, but then this one was right on the trail, so no side trail energy spent to get to it.  Had lunch shortly after at the Mountaineer Shelter trail junction…good campsite at the junction so no need to traverse however long to the shelter itself.  Fairly uneventful rest of the day until reaching the stealth campsite at Upper Laurel Fork stream crossing.  Found a sandy location to pitch the tent right alongside the stream.  Looks like the stream overflows here when raining a lot, however the forecast for the next few days is clear, so I should be safe.  Pitched the tent…had to stab the tent stakes in to quite a few places to find a some solid ground for the stakes to hold.  That’s one trouble with this tent as opposed to a free standing one that comes with poles.  This tent depends on tension to keep it erected….which requires solid ground for the stakes to go in and stay when tension is applied to the stake ropes.  Had a plentiful water source right outside my front door, so cooked my ramen noodles, which require the most water of anything in my food bag….not something I want to be cooking when I have to hike a quarter mile down a steep side trail to get to a water source.  I typically want to get water once when I get to a camp site and have enough to cook dinner, breakfast, fill my hydration bladder, and 2 70ml smart bottles…one to drink through the night to keep hydrated and one to carry with me the following morning when I start the next days hike.  When the water source is right at the campsite, it allows for a bit more luxury.  J  While cooking dinner, I was joined on the other side of the stream by ‘Trudge’.  I first camped with Trudge the very first campsite that Bobby and I stopped at on my reentry to the trail.  Since then we’ve been close to the same pace and have ended up stopping and camping or getting off trail at many of the same locations.  She also overnighted in Erwin and camped at the stealth site that Bobby and I were at Indian Grave Gap, the meadow stealth site the day after that and she took a zero day same as me and stayed at The Station Hostel in Roan Mtn last night.  We’d been discussing our next few days and I had notified her of this camp site and she had told me it was perfect cause it split in half her intentions of staying at Black Bear Resort outside of Hampton the next night.  I had not planned on staying at Black Bear, but after consideration of my other options it seemed perfect, so I booked a night there tomorrow night as well.  J  Overall, today seemed like the best day hiking I’ve had physically since the start of my adventure…I did 12.7 miles today in roughly 7 hours…arriving to camp at 1530, and felt I could easily have gone on further, but I didn’t like the camping options until another 3+ miles.  I thought that might be pushing a bit much and besides, it was going to take at least 1 overnight to reach Hampton anyway…this site as Trudge observed, kinda split those days right in equal mileage portions.  Today was one of the few days since starting that I pretty  much felt all day like I could now complete this thru hike.  :)

Cool and damp/humid morning, which would figure camping right beside a cool, flowing stream.  Got on trail around 0820 and did the 12 miles to Dennis Cove Rd by 1530…just a little over 7 hours total.  The topography of the trail looked fairly easy, but it was really a series of steady small climbs, followed by smaller descents, gradually increasing altitude and ending the day with a long steep downhill to the road leading to Black Bear Resort.  The result was a surprisingly wearying hike.  Nice sunny weather all day probably contributed to the wearying due to increased temps and a bit more sun exposure than the day before.  Saw 3 small snakes on the trail…all harmless garter snakes, but it’s a sign that summer has truly arrived.  Was met at the trailhead at Dennis Cove Rd with 2 separate Trail Magics…one by Marlene in the trailhead parking lot with candy and soft drinks, and the other just past the parking lot in a very nice shaded park area along the Laurel Fork River.  This Trail Magic was offered by ‘Riff Raff’, a fairly notorious group of partying former thru hikers.  They were grilling hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches with plenty of beer, soft drinks, and chips.  For some reason, I’ve just not been craving any beer while on the trail, but fully leaded cokes and other soft drinks I can’t seem to get enough of…no sugar free drinks while hiking!!!  Sat in a lawn chair in the shade here for a good 30 minutes, enjoying the atmosphere and relaxing before heading back out to the parking lot and then up the road to Black Bear Resort, which was about half a mile up the road….at least it was a level walk.  Checked in and got my choice of a private lower bunk in the bunkhouse.  Got laundry going a bit after 1630, then showered and resupplied a few items in their small store.  VERY nice and comfortable atmosphere here right alongside the Laurel Fork River.  Finished laundry and then caught a shuttle ride into town with ‘Trudge’ and a couple other thru hikers.  Shuttle driven by the resort owners’ daughter…a former marine…who was in town for the summer helping her parents run the resort.  Hit Subway for a footlong sandwich, McDs for some fries, and a couple small stores for some cokes and chips for the night, some life savers candy, and a couple Starkist white chicken packets for trail lunches.  Tiring day, but a very nice and rewarding end to it.  Joined in the bunkhouse later in the evening by ‘Mountain Goat’.  Only ended up being 3 of us in the bunkhouse out of a capacity of 8 bunk beds, which is always nice...having plenty of elbow room.  :)

Morning packing revealed that I was missing my fleece pullover.  Scoured the bunkhouse and laundry and shower facilities to no avail.  I usually keep it tied by the sleeves around the outside of my pack so that I have easy access to it if/when it gets chilly…especially early in the morning when just starting to hike.  Figured it must have gotten scraped off my pack by a low hanging branch one of the times I stopped and took the pack off…most likely when I was swinging it over my head and shoulders when redonning the pack.  At about 0830, I headed back to the trailhead where trail magic happened the day before and asked if anyone had seen a stray pullover.  Someone reported that one had been found on the trail and it had been hung it at the trailhead sign.  Apparently, someone else had claimed it though before I got there.  Oh well, thank God the days are warmer and there’s not been as much of a need for it lately.  I had been debating on sending it or my long sleeve base layer home when I got to Damascus anyway.  This really was the only distraction from a spectacular morning of hiking along the Laurel Fork River.  Lots of unique rock formations and cliffs along the river and a few moderate steps on occasion to climb up along cliff faces to view the river from above also.  About a mile and a half into the hike, the trail descended back down to the river and the base of Laurel Fork Falls…far and away the most spectacular falls along the trail to this point.  Trail continued on at river level, even at times skirting around cliff faces that had rock cliff on one side and a drop into the river no more than 2 or 3 feet away from the cliff….albeit only about a 3-5 foot drop before you hit the river…still a fun and exciting feature to navigate on the trail.  This first 3 miles or so of the trail may rival being the most scenic of any 3 miles I’ve been on up to this point.  This euphoria all ended however at 2.8 miles into the hike.  What was a nice scenic trail that actually continued on straight ahead into Hampton, TN, via a side trail, instead turned into 3 miles of 1800 ft elevation gain and 3 miles of 1800 ft elevation loss over a mountain that offered no views at any point on the way up or down and nothing but a flat camp site at the top with again, no views.  On either side of this eventless mountain was a road into Hampton, TN….the town, to which the side trail AROUND the mountain, could take you directly in and out of.  So, WHY does the AT have to deliberately go up and over a featureless climb/descent of 1800 ft when there’s a trail to and through the town?  ‘Because it’s there…’ is the only explanation I could come up with. Thankfully, I had planned a short mileage day and had plenty of time to leisurely navigate this pointless section.  I arrived on the other side at Boots Off Hostel around 1500.  Boots Off gave a very ‘free spirited’ vibe to it.  A bit of a ‘70s’ hippie vibe/culture to the people and place.  Showers were outdoors…private, but open air below the knees and up at the top of the walls.  Two levers on 2 separate pipes (one hot, one cold) that dumped water into a large bucket overhead with holes drilled in the bottom of it…so the pressure was only gravity as the water poured through these holes…more like a rain shower than a conventional one.  Very compact bunkhouse…this time I ended up with an upper bunk that required that I be part trapeze artist and part contortionist to get into and out of my bed. Once in, it was nice.  Privacy curtain and it’s own light and plug in.  Also small shelves at the head and foot of the bed for some gear.  Kitchen/eating area was very ‘communal’ and actually more outdoors than in.  Fridge stocked with milk for anyone to use with several types of cereal provided in large Tupperware bins.  Lots of fruit for anyone to grab and silverware and plates…wash your own dishes when finished.  Like I say, a very communal feeling to everything here.  There was a deck and a stage below where they had live music come in later that evening as they were kicking off their own pre ‘Trail Days’ parties ahead of the event in Damascus.  The deck and picnic table also smelled very much like a rock concert if you know what I mean…  Have I mentioned the whole place had a very 70’s hippyish vibe to it?  There were also a lot of people or residents here that weren’t hikers or thru hikers at least and a few of them had an ‘air’ about them…. All in all though, a very relaxing atmosphere once you settle in.  When I first walked into the place though I felt like the Delta’s in Animal House when they first stepped into the night club to see Odis Day and the Knights…..’We are going to die!’  It was a vibe of every eye upon me and assessing maybe if I was toting a law enforcement badge on or with me.  Definitely a unique experience. :)

Left Boots Off Hostel around 0820 after a communal breakfast of Captain Crunch and Frosted Mini Wheats.  Stuffed some fruit in my pockets (apple, orange, and pear) and headed out to do a 15-16 mile day.  Need to cover almost 42 miles in the next 3 days and 2 nights to get to Damascus on Friday for the start of Trail Days, so I’m hoping to get 15-16 miles the first 2 days at least so that I’ll only have about 10 miles left that final morning.  Topography of this section was also a bit deceptive…with the exception of 2-3 steep uphill miles after crossing Watauga Dam, the rest of the hike looked fairly mild.  However, most of it again was a steady uphill slog that consisted of repeated ascents, each followed by a shorter descent. It wasn’t until about 5 miles into the hike before I consulted my FarOut app and determined that the total ascent for today’s hike was over 4300 ft!  I never should have looked…my legs immediately seemed to grow weary after that.  A few scenic overlooks of Watauga Lake through the first half of the hike as the trail slowly and steadily climbed and skirted around the north of the lake, but after that, not much scenery to look at.  
At some point I started seeing hikers that I had seen hiking towards me the day before also, and I struck up a conversation with one of them while eating lunch on a large fallen tree beside a stream.  Apparently, he was also at Black Bear Resort the same night that I was and he and a friend were taking advantage of slack pack options that were offered by Black Bear Resort.  I had passed him yesterday as I was slogging up the useless mountain and again today during my seemingly endless uphill trudge.  The worst part about it was that they were getting to do this section I’m doing today, but doing it as a gradual downhill instead of uphill…’I could’ve had a V8’!!!  I passed several others that were doing the same thing, but they had camped and partied with ‘Riff Raff’, who had offered to shuttle them and do the same slack packing.  I stumbled across a slackpacking option the one time back in GA when I stayed at Hostel Around the Bend, but I had not thought to actively seek it out since then.  I’m definitely going to have to look into this more in the future!  
I was originally intending to get to Iron Mtn Shelter, but about .2 miles prior to that I passed a very nice flat campsite to the right of the trail and just up the hill from the last reliable water before Iron Mtn Shelter, so I decided close enough!  Two hikers had already set up here and we would be joined by at least 4-6 more before the night was done.  It was close to 6pm when I got to camp, so I had to hustle a bit to get all the chores done (setting up tent, retrieving and filtering water, cooking dinner, hanging the bear bag).  It was starting to get dark when I finished hauling my bear bag up and got back to my tent.  Very worn out from the day.  Had to change into some dry clothes also…the day was warm and sunny and it was quite a workout, so I was pretty much drenched when I got to camp.  At least I slept pretty well!

Thankfully I got there relatively early and there were lots of flat areas to utilize for pitching tents.  Got a nice grassy site and got all my chores done a lot earlier today.  Changed into some dry clothes and hung my wet ones out to hopefully dry.  Rain was supposed to hold off until tomorrow afternoon or evening, but at one point after settling in for the night, I heard a few drops of rain on the tent.  Since my clothes were actually draped on the top of my tent I was easily able to unzip and just reach out and grab them and pull them in.  It actually barely sprinkled, so they probably wouldn’t have gotten too wet.  Nothing out here every fully dries it seems with the humidity anyway, unless you can find a fully sunny patch to lay clothes out over a rock or something.

Up VERY early this morning and on the trail by 0720.  Mostly downhill all day for 10.1 miles to the edge of town.  The other 1.2 miles of the day was following the trail through Damascus.  Thankfully, it was mostly downhill cause my legs were feeling pretty shot from the last 2 days of roughly 16 miles each.  Crossed the Tennessee/Virginia border about 7 miles into the days hike.  Got to the edge of town in just a little over 4 hours, so averaged about 2.5 miles an hour.  Greeting tent at the edge of town where the trail emerges from the woods was offering town info/orientation, a Trail Days program, and most importantly…Gatorade!!!  Slammed down 2 of those quickly and headed into town where Trail Days was already in full swing.  Headed into the park where the vendor and food tents were set up.  Bought a single slice of pizza for $8 and a large, sweet tea for $5!!!  Talk about having a captive audience!  In retrospect I should have turned towards tent city first as I found out later that there were several tents set up for hikers that were doing Trail Magic on the way to tent city.  As it was, I didn’t blink to much at the price of the pizza and tea…such is the needs of a calorie starved hiker!  
Btw, Tent City is a designated park like area that any thru hiker who’s intending to camp in town during Trail Days, must pitch their tent and do so in this area.  Apparently, Damascus has a law that any day other than when Trail Days is going on, it’s illegal to pitch a tent anywhere within the city limits.  I guess you must do that when you have hikers that could be passing through your town any day of the year just looking for any flat spot to pitch a tent.  Such is the curse of having the AT run right through the middle of your town.  From what I saw they sure do bring a lot of business to the town though.  
Back to the pizza and tea.  While waiting in line, I had a woman ask me if she could take a picture of me from behind to get a view of my Crocs hanging from my backpack?  What the….?!  Sure lady!  Apparently, she just LOVES Crocs!!  So, once the pizza and tea were downed, I think the price began to sink in and I’d decided enough of that…so I headed on further into town on the AT…white blazes on the light poles and/or street signs, leading the way.  On the other side of town, I came across a convenience store just as the skies began to darken.  Went inside and bought half a fried chicken and 3 20oz Cherry Cokes and sat in there while the skies opened up outside.  After hanging out there a couple hours, I headed back into town the way I had come and stopped off at the complimentary medical tent with the intention of getting my blistered feet looked at and my blood pressure taken.  Adjacent to the medical tent was a staging area where a local church was offering feet washing (symbolic much?!) and a foot massage.  I guess the feet washing was kind of necessary though if you were going to have blisters looked at.  While waiting I was able to get my blood pressure checked and as I had thought it was a bit low.  I had had a couple episodes of bending over when pitching my tent, the last week or so where I’d get dizzy when standing back up.  I had had this once before when I had lost a lot of weight and was still taking my BP meds.  If your BP normalizes from wt loss and you’re still taking the meds it can make it now dip to low, so that’s what I wanted to see…if that might be the cause of my dizzy spells.  Sure enough it was borderline low, so the doc there advised that maybe I could lay off my diuretic BP med, since I was probably dehydrated a bit and that med contributes even more to dehydration.  So, I’ll set that one aside for a while.  Back to feet washing…you can’t believe how good it feels after the pounding your feet take, that you can dip them in warm soapy water and have someone else wash and massage them with skin lotion.  I could almost fall asleep in the chair.  After removing all my Leukotape from my blisters and callouses and getting my feet actually cleaned up good, I decided my blisters weren’t really that big of a concern, so I passed up seeing the doc again about those.  I did hate having to put my dirty socks back on and stuff my feet back in my boots.  Legs and feet both aching at this point…chaffing between the legs and on my hips and of course the nipples, I trudged back through town to the town library, which was set up as a recharging area for hikers to hang out.  It was here that I first noticed that there were Trail Magic tents along the path/street that ran towards tent city.  Oh well, the chicken and pizza still tasted good.  Took off my pack, found a bench and sat down to rest and await the arrival of my buddies, Mike and Allen from Atlanta.  Mike is the one that shuttled me to the trail head at Springer Mtn way back when I first started the hike on March 27th.  We had originally planned to meet here at Trail Days for the weekend, so he had booked a hotel in nearby Abingdon.  Around 1715, they pulled around the corner and I jumped in after a few comments about my aroma.  LOL.  Headed to Abingdon to get a shower to take care of that aroma and to have a few hot meals over the next couple days!

Bilbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658507,"First off let me apologize to anyone that might have been following my journey here, for this long overdue update.As most of you know or might have surmised by now, I got off the trail in Damascus, VA during Trail Days.  I was having issues with chaffing on the inside of my thighs, on my hips from the pack hipbelt, and on my nipples of all places.  The warming weather was increasing my amount of sweat output and creating a lot more chaffing in several body spots as noted.  I belief it was also causing me to be a bit dehydrated.  I had had a couple of dizzy spells upon reaching campsites after long warm days.  I checked in with the doctors in Damascus and since my blood pressure was being handled more than likely from my wt loss they concurred that I could probably drop one of my BP meds for now that is a diarhetic, which only exacerbates sweating and water loss.  I did find a solution to the nipple chaffing while on the trail....LIP BALM!  LOL  Still didn't stop the fact that they were already chaffed and hurt like hell by the time I got to Damascus, but at least it was no longer getting any worse.  All of these accumulated issues combined with my realization of 'I need to keep this up for another 4-5 months', kinda led me to a conclusion of 'I really just want to go home and recover'.  A couple friends of mine from Atlanta, Mike and Allen (actually the 2 who escorted me to the beginning of the trail at Springer Mountain) had already planned to meet me in Damascus for Trail Days and had gotten a hotel in nearby Abingdon for the weekend, so I spent the weekend touring around with them and enjoying a soft bed and hot shower.  Looking back now in Sept, I really believe that I got off the trail because it was 'convenient' to do so at the time.  Since getting off I discovered a solution for the chaffing...tubes of vaseline, and I had never really given myself the chance to see if cutting the BP med and upping my water intake would alleivate the dizzy spells and dehydration.  The foot and knee issues I really had grown accustom to dealing with and the legs were really shaping up to deal with both of those.  So, again I think the biggest issue was the convergence of being in a bad place mentally, combined with a convenient way to get off the trail.  Who knows if I'd of made it all the way without that convergence, but I'm honestly happy for the experience I had and it's still always in the back of my mind to make another attempt...physical health willing.  I hope you all enjoyed following along through what I did accomplish....a little over 300 miles total in 31 days on the trail.  Note:  I DID go out and day hiked a couple sections south of Fontana Dam, which pushed my total over the 300 miles.  This was part of a section that I had skipped when I had my shoulder issues the second week of April I believe it was.  At any rate, it was an experience I'll always cherish and look back on fondly now...and as I say, who knows if another attempt might be in my future...I'll let you all know if it is.  Thanks!!!","Damascus, VA
