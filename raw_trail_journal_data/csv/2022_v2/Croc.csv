Parked at Liberty Hill lot off Rt. 50 (Ashby Gap).  Monday, 2/21- Hiked South 5 miles to Whiskey Hollow shelter.  The lot was full, and I saw quite a few day hikers out for President’s Day holiday, especially when the trail passed through Sky Meadows State Park. It was a beautiful day in the 60s, the best weather day backpacking since fall.  Camped at Whiskey Hollow shelter.  Remnants of the old, beloved Dick’s Dome shelter was nearby.  That was a weird looking shelter that had some good use for many decades.  A lot of people still refer to this spot as Dick’s Dome. 
Tuesday, 2/22- Hiked a total of about 15 more miles, much in the rain.  Started out heading South for 5 miles to Manassas Gap shelter.  Took a quick break there; ate a snack and filtered some water from the spring.  I then turned around and headed back North, passing the turn off for Whiskey Hollow.  I continued through G. Richard Thompson Wildlife Management Area, past a trail that leads West to a parking lot and camping sites.  The AT then proceeded through the back end of Sky Meadow State Park, where other trails like the Ambassador Whitehouse Trail and the Old Trail intersected the AT.  I continued North a couple of more miles back to the parking lot on Liberty Hill Rd. at Rt. 50 (Ashby Gap).","

Destination- Amicalola Falls State Park
Cheryl dropped me off at Culpeper Amtrak train station Sat night. Train arrived at 8:07pm, then departed heading South. It arrived at GNS Sunday morning at 7:30am. Many thks to Jeff, who was waiting for me. He was so gracious to drive us first to a great breakfast (esp. fresh biscuits), then took me to Amicalola Falls State Park visitor’s center. We had great conversation about our families, scouts, & other experiences, & congrats to those GA Bulldogs! I checked in at visitor’s center, after pics of the “Arch.”  I registered as Thru-Hiker 578 for the year, & my pack weighed 36.5 lbs, incl 8 lbs. food & 4 lbs. water. This is a bit more than I wanted, but also includes extra weight for cold weather gear & Exospikes (in case of snow/ice). Hiked up Approach Trail & up beautiful Waterfalls staircase. Hiked about 1.5 miles total in heavy rain. “Good day for a Duck”, as we used to say with Scouts (Ducks crew).",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Sun",0

Hiked rest of the Approach trail from the lodge (7.6 more miles since completed initial 1.2 up to lodge yesterday) up to Springer Mtn, the official start of the AT.  Springer is in Fannin County, GA, which is where my Ledford/Walden ancestors lived a long time ago.  Cheryl has them in 1850 & 1860 census from genealogy, and they were in area prior to that. 
Hiked 2.8 more miles from Springer to Stover Creek shelter, and camped there for the night.  There were 20+ tents camped there.  Met a lot of nice folks, and enjoyed music (couple guys playing guitar) around the campfire that night.  It was down to about low 30s that night, but was comfortable night sleeping.","Amicalola Lodge (Amicalola State Park)

Hiked up and over Sassafras Mtn, then later arrived at Justus creek, and camped in campsite about 100 yds up past the creek.  Some other guys came in after me, but camped right next to the creek. Not a lot of good tree limbs, but did find one and hung up my bear bag before going to bed.","Stover Creek Shelter

Several of us had a nice lunch at Woody Gap picnic table.  This included Shweddy, who went to Iowa State, like my wonderful daughter in law, Brandi.  It also included Purple Willy, Al, and others.
Continued on to Lance Creek campsite.  I was the 2nd one to arrive after Shweddy.  We pitched our tents in the ""choice spots"" on left as you enter the campsite.

Got to Neel Gap around 1:30pm, and stayed at Blood Mtn Cabins for the night.  Shweddy, DIY, and myself split a cabin.  I slept on the pull out sofa.  Cabins were only about 400 yds from Neel Gap.  I went through a good pack check and Neel, and the fellow doing it was very helpful and suggested some items to send or leave a home.  This included my Exospikes, extra long pants, extra (Prana) long shirt, extra T shirt, camp soap.","Lance Creek campsite

Hiked w/Shweddy, as we had similar pace.  Nice guy named Roy was doing trail magic at Tesnatee Gap road crossing.  Enjoyed cold water, banana, & mandarin oranges.  Left knee felt a little sore coming down rocky Cowrock Mtn to this gap.  Took some Aleve.  Knee felt fine the final 5 1/2 miles to Low Gap shelter.  
Shweddy and I pitched our tents close to shelter and creek.  There was an ATC guy, Barak, from Charlottesville.  He had some good suggestions.  I stepped in creek getting water, and got my hiking sock sopping wet.  Will wear other socks tomorrow...","Neel Gap

Continued on, and came to another road crossing at Indian Grave Gap (USFS 283), after we came down off Rocky Mountain.  We saw Rock & Roll.  More trail magic, as a nice woman gave him a bag of Korean food.  He shared with us.   
Stopped to camp at Cheese Factory campsite.  Shweddy, 53, and Sparkles spent the night there, in nice campsites in the woods out of the wind.  This was about 2 miles South of Tray mountain, which we though might be a very windy spot for tonight.","Low Gap Shelter

Around the Bend was a really good hostel, run by Lisa & Gordon.  However, I had to hike the 1/2 mile from Dick's Gap to the hostel, since they were too busy to pick me up at 4pm and was arranged (and no cell signal at Dick's Creek Gap). 
I was able to take a quick shower.  I then joined our shuttle into Hiawassee, where we resupplied and group of 9 of us went to Monte Alban Mexican restaurant.  It was good, but of course, not as good as Del Rio in Leesburg.  I washed my clothes when I got back, and got a good night's sleep in the bunkhouse (only 6 bunks total).","Cheese Factory Campsite

Was considering hiking to Betty Creek Gap, but stopped at Carter Gap shelter instead.  Arrived at 2:45pm, just as rain started.  Slept in shelter for the 1st time.  The rain was extremely heavy and non-stop from afternoon until morning.  A drencher.

As we passed through Tellico Gap, we saw some trail magic left by the trail that was covered by snow. Oreos were in a box, & cheese crackers (“Nabs” as my in laws call them). We stopped for quick break & thoroughly enjoyed.
The first part of this cold, snowy hike, had some uphill to Wesser Bald.  After that, was almost all downhill. It was a tough hike going down final slippery 7 miles into NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center). 
We passed Rufus Morgan shelter, only about 1 mile from the NOC. We saw several tents that appeared to be abandoned. Hopefully the owners will go back for them later.
It was so nice, & sense of accomplishment, to arrive at the NOC shortly. This is a day we will some day tell our Grandchildren about (in my case, a “Grand Davy” story).

The Fontana TVA Visitor Center was still closed due to COVID.
We entered the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the trail went up a road for about a mile or so.  The trail then turned into the woods, and we saw the through-hiker registration box, where we put our permits.  The Great Smoky Mountain National Park is only place along the trail where a through hiker has to pay to hike through ($20 fee), I think, except for perhaps Baxter State Park in Maine.
It was a tough and muddy 8 mile hike up from Fontana Dam to Gregory Bald, where we ate lunch.  The trail was pretty much a mud pit, which made for slow going.

I had about 1,000 feet elevation gain heading North from Rt. 522 to CCC road and Mosby camp.  This camp was named after Confederate Colonel John S. Mosby, commander of 43rd Battalion Virginia Calvary.  
Continued on another 2 miles until I reached the Jim & Molly Denton shelter.  This is a beautiful shelter that even has a solar shower.  I was camped near this shelter in early February.  I signed the journal again today before eating lunch there.  No NOBO thru-hikers through here, yet, but there will be a lot in a couple of months.
After lunch, I turned around and headed back South to Rt. 522, with about another 1,000 feet of elevation gain.  This was a relatively easy hike compared to going up and down mountains in the Smokies.  Still, it was good to get out and work the legs.
This year, I have now backpacked the AT North from Rt. 522 (outside of Front Royal) all the way to Rt. 7 (just past Bear’s Den).  I have done a couple of the areas, especially the “roller coaster,” multiple times.","Rt. 522/Front Royal (972.0)

It was unusually cold for end of March (highs only in 30s & lows in 20s at night), and extremely windy (not unusual).  The trail was exposed to the wind most of the way there and back.  
Some thru-hikers, like Microbirst, say they much prefer to hike in cold weather rather than hot weather.  Definitely not me.  I will take 90 degrees any day over a 20 degree wind chill day…  My legs (and joints) don’t seem to warm up well in cold weather, and although I sweat a lot (high metabolism), as long as I stay hydrated, I am pretty comfortable in hot weather.  I actually wore shorts today, and this was the low end (perhaps beyond) of my comfort range for hiking in shorts.  I had not worn shorts to date on my thru-hike.  I know of some thru-hikers, like Half Mile, who hike in shorts even in extreme cold (like the snow storm in the Smokies). 
I wore my Appalachian Gear All-Paca Fleece Hoodie over my Smartwool base layer T-shirt.  This blocked the wind pretty well even w/heavy gusts, although it felt cold.  I should have worn my Smart Wool Merino 250 Quarter Zip Long Sleeve Top Base Layer instead of the T-shirt, and/or put on my insulated jacked on the way back.

I had not hiked this stretch since December 2012 with my Dad.  We had a nice day together that day, but after starting out heading North, turned around part way to Raven Rocks.  We then went to Bear’s Den.  My Dad was in good cardio shape & loved to hike, but sadly, this was the 1st time that I could see the effects of cancer causing him to get a bit winded.  I still miss him, and not being able to hike with him.  However, it is comforting knowing that I will see him again one day in heaven, which will be far better than any hike on even the best day here.  (btw- I guess even the average person w/o cancer would get winded trying to do this hike…)
Anyway, today I hiked 2.7 miles to Raven Rocks, and stopped briefly.  It was a beautiful view.  I then hiked another 4.7 miles to the Blackburn Trail Center trail turnoff, passing Wilson Gap about a mile before it.  I then turned around and headed back the 7.4 miles to the car, with snow flurries along the way as I got closer.

Quite a bit of hiking on & over boulders early on. Trail became easier as it went farther North. 
Met OHDI (Out Here Doing It, from Wisconsin) where trail crossed creek shortly before Alec Kennedy shelter.  She is a fellow believer in Christ, & we had a good conversation.

I hiked through town, over bridge, across railroad tracks. There was a train blocking where trail went across tracks, so I had to go around it. Continued on trail into woods & up the mountain.

A bit of a rocky ascent from the road. Good hiking whether with no rain, although forecast had possibility of. The trail today was about 1/2 rocky, sometimes quite so with boulder fields. The other half of time, trail was good, including some stretches of walking road beds.
I only saw a couple other Thru-Hikers today, including Dirty Noodles this morning. Very quiet day hiking.
I got to Pulpit Rock then The Pinnacle a couple miles after that. Both had nice views, but certainly not on par with some others on the trail, like McAfee Knob & Tinkers Cliff.

This hike included a pretty intense boulder field that seemed like a mile long from before Knife's Edge to Bear rocks.  Then more at Bake Oven Knob.  The Knife's Edge boulder scramble was most challenging on the AT thus far, for me.
Along the way, there was good trail magic from Jelly at Blue Mountain Road crossing.  She is from Southern Florida, but originally from Eastern KY.  I told her my Mom was from Pruden, TN, across from Middlesboro, KY.  She knew that area.

Hiked up Bear Mountain. Perkins Memorial tower was very impressive. Lots of people in the park for Independence day weekend. I then hiked down the mountain  which was very well maintained trail with steps on the way down. Kind of surprised to see so many people hiking up, & some did not seem to have water. 
I eventually arrived down along Hessian Lake, which was absolutely packed with people. Passed by Bear Mtn Inn. It was so crowded on trail entering the Trailside Museum & Zoo. Eventually, we got in, bypassing crowds waiting for swimming pool. Zoo did not have a lot of exhibits, but did see 1st bears on AT, 2 Grizzly Bears on exhibit. Interesting that the AT runs right through the zoo. Zoo is now only open on weekends, or would have to had to bypass it. We continued hike through the zoo, & came out next to the Bear Mountain bridge along the Hudson river.
I then called the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel. Grandpa came a few minutes later & picked us up in parking lot near the circle. His motel was nice, clean place, & Grandpa seemed like a good guy with sense of humor . Plus, he was born same year as me, 1961. He reminded me that we were 61 & born in 61, which I had actually thought before. It was good that they had laundry service here.
Ate dinner across the road at Barnstormer BBQ. It was ok, but thought overpriced ( like many places up North). Went to Dunkin Donuts later, & got 1/2 dozen donuts. It was nice to get a shower & sleep in nice bed.  It has been pretty strenuous week hiking.
Taking a zero day tomorrow, but will probably hike back to the bridge & over the Hudson river.","Fingerboard Shelter (1392.1)

Croc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654089,"Today was intended to be a zero day, but put my backpack back on & hiked from Bear Mountain Bridge Motel back to Bear Mountain Bridge next to Zoo (where left off yesterday). 
I hiked 1 mile, from there across the bridge, then followed trail to left along road, then to right into woods some
It was a beautiful Independence Day, especially looking up & down the Hudson river & up to mountains. I also went by Fort Montgomery center, although closed. I went back into the Trailside Zoo for a bit. Most animal exhibits were closed but there was an interesting Revolutionary War exhibit about Forts Montgomery & Clinton. A lot of important Revolutionary War history here, as Hudson Rivet was very strategically important.","Bear Mountain Bridge after Zoo (1407.3)
",North of Bear Mountain Bridge (1408.3),"Jul 04, Mon",1
Croc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654479,"I decided to exit the Appalachian Trail just North of where Bear Mountain Bridge crosses the Hudson River (mile 1408.3).
My main reason for this decision is that this long Thru-Hike has been very lonely for me, as I have missed my family, especially my wife Cheryl.  Even though I did temporarily leave the trail when my father-in-law passed, and was with my family for 3 weeks at that time, I have been lonely ever since resuming.  This has been an ongoing feeling, and I made sure not to leave the trail on my worst day.  I have experienced a loneliness on the trail that I had never experienced before, despite being around other hikers.  I think that it was God’s will for me to experience this, and gain a better appreciation for how precious life is, how precious time with family is, and to become more empathetic towards others.  I realize how blessed I am with my family, and my desire to spend time with them overcame my desire to complete the rest of the hike this year.  I was away when my FIL was dying, and I missed that extra time with  him.  It was also difficult to miss out on a family vacation with my adult children.

Being in such a mindset makes the hardships of the trail even worse, such as walking on rocks day after day.  Doing this for another 8-10 lonely weeks was not something I looked forward to.

I have felt good physically, other than losing a lot of weight (about 35 lbs.).  My knees, feet, ankles, and rest of my body felt good.  I did not have any problem at all with my right knee that had surgery last November.  So, thanks to Dr. David Johnson for excellent job he did, as well as the rest of the staff at NMSI (National Sports Medicine Institute) who helped with my PT. 
My trail legs were good, and cardio very strong.  Even though I do not like hiking on rocks (practically every day), I have been able to do that without any pain or injury.  I enjoyed the physical demands and challenges of the rock scrambles, climbing and pulling myself up.  Some examples, Lehigh Gap, Lemon Squeezer, …  I thank the Lord for protecting me, and for all of those people who have been praying for me.  The Lord does hear prayers, although He does not always answer them the way we would like. 
I have seen quite a few people out there who were injured, or had nagging injuries, who have carried on.  As a matter of fact, at Bear Mountain Bridge Motel, I saw a couple folks come in with sore knees, feet/blisters, who were going to take a couple days off.  It may seem ironic that I came off the trail even though I was perhaps better off physically than most others.  Hats off to those folks carrying on, and I wish them well.  I know I could have completed my Thru-Hike physically, if not for the loneliness.  
I have hiked over 1,500 miles on the AT.  This includes Thru-Hiking over 1,400 miles this year, along with another 100 in the 100 Mile Wilderness to Katahdin with Justin 10 years ago.  This has been a great experience and blessing.  I have seen a lot of God’s wonderful creation from Georgia to NY.  I have met many wonderful people, from various walks of life.  I have seen quite a few small towns along the trail that were a glimpse of America, and what is still good about America.  Lots of kind, caring people.  I have also seen how Thru-Hikers look out for one another, and that common bond we share no matter what our life background might be.  I have prayed with and for many people I have met on the trail.  The Holy Spirit was with me as I hiked, and there were some occasions where I could intensely feel His presence.

Cheryl picked me at Bear Mountain Bridge Motel.  She met Grandpa, a really great guy who runs the place and truly cares for Thru-Hikers.  I have been praying for his wife, given her medical issues, and will continue to do so.  As I departed, I shook hands and hugged my new friend.  May God’s blessings be upon them. 
Although I am at peace with my decision to come off the trail when I did, I am sorry if I have disappointed any of you all by coming off the trail before Katahdin.  I am definitely not done with hiking for good, so maybe I will see you out on the trail sometime in future years.  If you are considering a future Thru-Hike, it is a wonderful experience and would encourage you to plan for and pursue that.  If you would like to talk, please let me know and I can share more of my experiences.  
Be safe, and may God bless you all!
