Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646052,"I seem to be doing everything unconventionally in my preparations for the AT this coming April 15th, 2022.
Most hikers start in Georgia and head North - I will be a Flip-Flopper. Starting in the middle of VA and heading NOBO, then I will return to VA and head South.
Most hikers take a tent with them - I will be using a hammock even though I have never slept in one but from what I hear I want to give it a try. I know there is a steep learning curve but hey, I have 2 weeks to learn.
That brings me to another unconventional way of hiking the AT, I am currently working in China and I will have 2 weeks from when my plane lands in the USA and my proposed start date. 
I am slowly going through my gear options and trying to make sure I don’t forget something or end up taking too much. I do have sufficient funds set aside so I plan on getting good quality, light equipment from the start and hope it works for me. I am a planner so I will do the best I can virtually until I get state-side. My thought is that along with my online planning, is to hit the many REIs and other outfitters outside of Atlanta nearest the Southern terminus of the trail to augment my online research with real-world AT experience. Then I will start camping and hiking and put everything to the test in the little time I have before I hit the trail for real. I love that I can return items to REI if they don’t work out.",,View Entry,"Dec 13, Mon",0
Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646111,"With my newfound freedom, this is the perfect time to take on hiking the AT. I have no mortgage or rent payments, no car loan, insurance, or utilities that I must pay. I am nearly debt-free and have money in the bank. 
But as I embark on my new existence as a digital nomad, I am finding that I am dealing with a steep learning curve for both the hike of my dreams and my life as a nomad.
Part of my new life is about rebuilding my way of life as a digital nomad - a digital nomad is one who can work from anywhere. They are geographically non-specific, meaning they can work from a coffee shop in Bali as easily as an apartment in Des Moines. 
I have a head start as I have worked hard to create my Travel Agency in a way that I could run it from anywhere in the world. That idea was theoretical until I moved to China to live and work for 1 year. 
I am now trying to figure out how I can run my Travel Agency business while hiking the AT. I am also launching a blog soon that will contain articles about my travel here in China plus will also chronicle my time as a thru-hiker of the AT plus my projects I have after I complete the AT. 
Many people take the extra time and effort to blog or vlog their AT hike and do an amazing job. I will have to learn their ways and how to deal with limited connectivity on the trail and in trail towns. 
Also, I work best on my laptop, but I can’t take that on the trail. Do I bounce box it to myself every couple of weeks?",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Sat",0
Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646162,"I am still here in China till March 31st, 2022. My flight lands in Houston on April 1st. 
I left Houston back in April of 2021. Houston is very flat. Not a good place to train for the AT. I am now living and working as an actor in Beijing at the Universal Beijing Resort which recently opened here. Beijing is also very flat. 
Luckily there are mountains in the Northern part of the city (about 1-2 hours away) and include the Great Wall of China. Due to Covid restrictions in place to make sure the upcoming Olympics go well, we can NOT leave Beijing. But Beijing is huge! There are many locations to hike in the mountains and on the Great Wall while staying within Beijing. I go as often as I am able. It is the best I can do to get some training in. I simply do not like ‘hiking’ on a treadmill. I want to be outside!",,View Entry,"Dec 27, Mon",0
Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646225,"Doing research for hiking the AT, I came across a book that at first did not thrill me, but I ended up loving it and got a tremendous amount of knowledge and insight by having read it. The book is called, “Thru-Hiking the Appalachian Trail: 100 Tips, Tricks, Traps, and Facts” by Jen Beck Seymour & Greg Seymour. 
I would highly recommend this book. In it, Jen recommends a book she read called “Fixing Your Feet: Injury Prevention and Treatment for Athletes” by John Vonhof. Jen had remarked how taking care of her feet with her newfound knowledge had kept both she and Greg from getting any blisters on the entire AT. This, in my opinion, is knowledge worth having - especially since many would-be AT hikers leave the trail due to problems with their feet.
John Vonhof discusses, in great detail, how and why you should take care of your feet. Your feet are the “Main Thing” you need to think about on an AT hike! Some suffer from knee issues and other problems with the leg or hips, but some of these stem from a change of gait due to painful feet according to Vonhof. 
The book covers footwear, socks, blister prevention & treatment. All in great detail which may be a bit much for some, but in Jen & Greg’s book, they cover some of the self-care they used to keep from getting blisters and that may prove to be enough to help you.
Most of the issues with your feet on the AT can be avoided as long as you are regularly taking care of your feet and being on the lookout should any new issues arise. In other words, Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing.
This is what I plan to do and my being excited to share what I learned from these two books should not be taken as me telling you what to do. HYOH.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Mon",0
Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646904,"I am not sure if this has ever been done before, but I am acquiring my hiking gear list virtually from over 7,000 miles away. I won’t be able to put a finger on any of it till about 10 days before I hit the trail. If you have read my previous post about training on The Great Wall of China, you will know where I am - in Beijing, China.
I have only purchased a few of the items below either because 1) it was on sale and I couldn’t pass on the savings or 2) I needed to pre-order the item since it was custom or mail order only.
Please, please tell me where I’ve gone wrong with my hiking gear list before I purchase the rest of my gear. I will end up getting most of my gear from REI mostly because of their incredible return policy. I will be flying into Atlanta, so my thought was to hit up some REIs in that area and possibly some other outfitters thinking that they should be VERY familiar with what it takes to tackle the AT. I also plan 1-2 shakedown hikes before I hit the trail for real.
The order in which I am tackling my gear list below is in the same order as the Gear List from The Trek’s Appalachian Trail Thru-Hiker Gear List.
My Virtual Hiking Gear List
Hammock (already purchased)
First of all, I am NOT getting a tent because this old back just can’t handle sleeping on the hard ground, even with a fluffy pad. I have never slept in a hammock, so this will be a huge leap of faith. That and what I understand, a pretty steep learning curve. But hey, I have many miles to get it just right.
I have read the many reviews from those that have purchased various hammocks and I have decided to go with the Kammock Mantis Ultralight all-in-one hammock which weighs 2 pounds 3 oz. The all-in-one aspect of this system is a major reason for me to pick the Kammock.
I think the one thing that scares many would-be hammock buyers is the vast variety of choices. Choices of a hammock, strap system, tarp, etc… Just give me everything in one bag and give me a video on how to hang it.
Then down the road, we can talk whoopie slings and shit. A tent is enticing because it’s all included and simple. Make more hammocks with all-in-one options and you’d have more people using them.
Check back in with me later and see if I am singing a different tune. Will I like hammock camping? Will I like the Kammock?
The Kammock Ridgeline organizer (2.5 oz) and the Joey Gear Sling (5.5 oz) were some other Kammock items I purchased. I am not sure I will take either on the trail but wanted to test them out on my shakedown hikes.
Backpack (already purchased)
The Osprey Exos 48 (2 lbs 9.1 oz) is the pack for me. I think!  Based on the many reviews, and articles I’ve read, it is great for a beginner backpacker and should take me to completion of the AT. I like that it is an internal frame and while it is not ultralight, it is light and sturdy for the long haul. 
I am choosing the 48L pack to limit my load. I have read too many times that if you have the space, you will fill it. I don’t need all that on my back. I will have to make 48L work for what I plan to carry.
The ULA pack is also a strong contender. (Update: going with the Exos 48)
Quilt - top quilt/ under quilt (already purchased)
I have always used a regular sleeping bag and then I learned about quilts. Did you know that all that insulation under you as you sleep is compacted and therefore useless? So why carry it with you? It makes no sense.
Again I am making a leap of faith with a quilt for my top quilt. I chose the Enlightened Equipment Revelation, regular, wide, 850 down, 30-degree bag with a 10D lining inside and out. Boy, did I just sound like I knew what I was talking about or what? I did learn what all that meant but boy that is a lot to wrap your head around.
I wish hikers could have a hiking concierge that would help with gear choices and be ready on the trail with alternatives should their current choice not work. But that would make it all too easy and take all the fun out of gear selection.
Because I am a hammock camper, I also need an underquilt. There are so many quilts that fall in this category it quickly becomes overwhelming. I ended up doing some research on the Hammock Gear Incubator and was very impressed. My selection is currently being custom made with the standard full length, a 10D lining inside and out and 850 down at a 20-degree rating.
Bag liner (already purchased)
Is this piece of equipment even necessary? If not, then if you decide to take one, does that make it a luxury item?  I do like the idea of keeping my quilt clean and I can use it by itself in the dead of summer. The Cocoon silk mummy liner looks to be light and has the necessary addition of warmth I may need early on and in the high mountains.
Sleeping Pad (not yet purchased)
Do I even need a sleeping pad with a hammock setup and an underquilt in tow? If I do end up getting one, which I could pick up along the way, I am looking at the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir UberLite Sleeping Pad coming in at 8.8 oz for the regular size. But over $200?!? WTF?  If I want to sleep in a shelter or in the huts in the Whites, I will need one, right? I am really looking for feedback here from those of you who know the AT. (Update: starting without a pad)
Footwear (already purchased)
Here I am waffling between the Altra Lone Peak 6 and the Altra Olympus 4. Since I am a Flip-flopper with a start in VA, I will be hitting the rocks in PA early on. I have heard the Olympus is more sturdy than the Lone Peak 5, but the LP 6 got an upgrade, so I am not sure.
I will be trying these at a local REI soon before my hike but would appreciate some feedback you may have with the LP 6 vs the Olympus 4. Also, I am planning on using the Superfeet Trailblazer inserts. (Update: I am going with the LP 6)
Base Layers (already purchased)
No idea. It will NOT be cotton, I know that much but am lost beyond that.
I will need to work with what REI has when I show up there before my hike. I know I do want something to keep me warm while I sleep when it’s cold. What works for you that takes you from colder temps at the start and end of your hike and in the higher altitudes and during storms? But can also carry you into the hot days of summer and not weigh your pack down. Boy, that IS asking a lot!
Hiking Fleece (already purchased)
Superior Fleece’s Cascade Hoodie (size large is 9.3 oz). I really wanted to get that hoodie Frozen has, but that was simply not happening for me. The Superior Fleece was reviewed as being about the same, but easier to get.
Insulating Jacket (already purchased)
Enlightened Equipment Torrid Jacket (size large is 8.4 oz). I went with the EE on this due to a couple of youtube video reviews I saw. Plus the fact that the EE Torrid with a Visp of the same size is designed to fit well together. Again, give me a package made to work together and I’m sold.
Rain/ Wind Jacket (already purchased)
Enlightened Equipment Visp Rain Jacket (size large is 4.93 oz). See above.
Umbrella (already purchased)
Guilty pleasure - that’s what an umbrella seems to me. I grew up in Oregon and I LOVE the rain, I just don’t love rain with the wind or the cold or both. But I do want to take one with me. I feel so much better that The Trek did not list ‘Umbrella’ under luxury items, plus that Frozen and others also used one on the trail. Zpack Lotus UL Umbrella (6.8 oz) is my choice.
Socks and underwear (already purchased)
Your feet are your foundation. Try very hard to prevent blisters and you will be a happier hiker, or so I hear. Towards this end, I am sold on the Injinji sock liners which separate the toes from one another. As a marathon runner, I know how painful blisters can be. But after a marathon, I can rest up for the next week or so. I can’t do so with a thru-hike. I have some Injinjis now but am getting the liners for use on the AT. Over these, I plan on using the Darn Tough socks. Their lifetime warranty speaks for itself (and their many reviews).
Underwear will probably be ExOfficio due to reviews and very little competition in this category.
Hiking Bottoms (not yet purchased)
Shorts of some kind during warmer weather. Maybe pants that zip for other times of the year? It seems I have really put off the whole clothing category - I will probably narrow these choices down once I hit the REI stores just before my hike.
Camp bottoms (not yet purchased)
Same as above. Not a clue.
Gloves and hats (already purchased)
Reading and watching many blogs, hikers seem to get very cold fingers when caught in the rain and wind and find it hard to climb, etc. Their fingers are so cold. A waterproof glove seems to be the answer but I am not sure there is such a thing. REI has a highly rated Outdoor Research Waterproof Glove Liner which may not be fully waterproof. What are your thoughts on this? I would love to hear about your experience.
As for a hat, I will get a good quality Balaclava to sleep in and wear when it is cold. I also may need a cap to keep the bug net from my face when I get up north?
Also, the wool buff that I already own. I have no idea of the brand.
Camp shoe (already purchased)
Xero shoes Z-trails (10.8 oz) - I know some may see these as a luxury item but having a pair to wear in camp and air my feet out is so important for foot care. Plus being able to use these in showers that may have foot funk all over, is worth it. I think you may also be able to wear these when fording rivers. 
Stuff sacks (not yet purchased)
Yes - No idea what or which. I can pick some up at REI and more on the trail as or if needed. Not too worried about this yet.
Cooking gear (already purchased)
I had and love the Jetboil system but I think I will go with the MSR Windburner (15.5 oz). I plan to only heat water in the pot and use dehydrated meals. I will also clean and reuse the Mountain House pouch for hydrating other off-the-shelf ingredients like mashed potato and other food items like that. This way I can continue to keep my pot from needing to be cleaned while on the trail. 
I already have the Sea-to-Summit short-handled spork, otherwise, I would have gotten the longer handle spoon but I can’t see buying another one.
The other item that I already have is the Toaks Titanium Cup which I will use for coffee, cocoa, and miscellaneous.
Trekking poles (already purchased)
I don’t have this narrowed down to a specific brand but I am looking for a pair of trekking poles with cork handles, flick lock, and made from aluminum, based on general reviews.
Headlamp (not yet purchased)
Nitecore NU25 Ultra Lightweight Headlamp (1.9 oz with strap) is my choice in this category. I like the way it operates and that it is rechargeable.
Water purification (already purchased)
The Katadyn BeFree looks very good but I am going to go with the Sawyer Squeeze (3 oz). I like that it lasts longer and works with a standard Smart Water bottle. (update: I am going with the Katadyn BeFree to start out) 
First Aid (not yet purchased)
First Aid Kit - 4 adhesive bandages, ½ roll medical tape, a ½-ounce tube of antibiotic treatment, three small packages of pills: ibuprofen, Benadryl, and an antidiarrheal, 2-3 antiseptic wipes, 2-3 butterfly bandages, Tweezers, Safety pins, One sheet of moleskin, Water treatment tablets, Baby Powder, Pain Medication, Bandaids, Duct Tape - 2 feet wrapped around of pen shaft, Anti Diarrhea Meds.
Toiletries (not yet purchased)
Toothbrush, 1 oz toothpaste, toilet paper, hand wipes. I plan on purchasing a collapsible travel toothbrush at Walmart. Also to better clean my bottom and use less TP, I am getting a hiker’s bidet.
Guidebooks (already purchased)
AWOL’s guide on my iPhone. Guthook (FarOut) on my iPhone.
Luxury Items (not yet purchased)
No pillow to start, but I may add it if needed.
I am getting the NITECORE NB10000 Ultra-Slim 10000mAh (9.2 oz) for my battery backup.
I may get a small sit pad but I have not made up my mind on this item. I may rationalize getting it and use it also as a doormat of sorts for my hammock.
Trowels (not yet purchased)
Yes, titanium to keep it light but I am flexible on brand. (update - I am going to skip this for now)
GPS (not yet purchased)
NO. Just the one on my iPhone.
Misc. (not yet purchased)
Permethrin insect spray for my clothes and other things. And speaking of bugs, a bug net may get this along the trail as needed. PackTowl is another item that I will need to add and I have no idea on brand but I want it light and on the small side. A very small Swiss Army pocket knife that has a knife, scissors and tweezers, and little else. It is the perfect size and weight and I already own that as well. Plus a Nylofume pack liner.
That's my hiking gear list. I feel like there is way too much stuff that I am planning on taking but at the same time, I can't seem to think of anything that I can leave behind. So that's it. What did I miss? Where did I mess up? I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks in advance.
