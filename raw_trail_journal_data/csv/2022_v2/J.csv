I am currently sitting at my kichen table and just want toÂ leave for the trail and start my hike.Â  Â I have so many thoughts going on in head, I dont know what to write.Â  Do I talk about all the training I have be doing, my plans for arriving at the park, starting the hike, what my friends and family thinks of me doing this hike, my gear (I dont want to talk gear), pack weight (No), do I really think i complete this hike (yes), do I have any spelling mistakes in all my babaling?Â  Hold on let me go spell check that word.Â Â

J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646797,"So, I turned 50 years old back in November.Â  Â One of my friends ask me how I wanted to celebrate and I told her i wanted to go hiking.Â  So a group of us (10) rented a VRBO house, went to north GA, and went hiking.Â  Well some of us went hiking, some of them went to wineries and told us to have fun, lol.Â  Â 
It was such a great trip!Â  Thank you Ladies...",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Wed",0
J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647139,"What does someone do before starting thier hike of a life time on the Appalachian Trail?Â 
They fly to Tucson, AZ to see their youngest daughter and go hiking in the mountains in the the middle of a desert.Â  It was an amazing trip.Â  We all drove to Mt. Lemmon, went to the Tucson Rodeo, drove to Tombstone,Â  and hiked in the Saguaro Nation Park.Â  Then American Airlines cancelled all the flights between Tucson and Dallas/Ft Worth due to weather.Â  That meant we were stuck in Tucson 3 more days.Â  So I did more hiking, went to the Tucson Rodeo Parade, and went to Sonora Desert Museum (Amazing) andÂ Saguaro National Park (again), and the Reid Zoo.Â Â 
We Finally made it back to Florida just in time to drive to GA this coming Friday.Â  My backpack is packed and I am ready to to get started!

J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647202,"What a day!Â 
I registered my hike and picked up my hang tag, I got number 850.Â  That happens to be the area code for Tallahassee ;) Also met Wing-Heart from ALDHA.
We then took a short 2.5 mile hike and then went to Dahlonega for lunch and some sight seeing.Â Â 
There were a lot of vendors setup at the lodge for the Official ATKO.Â  Talked to Jamie from Zpacks.Â  They are based out of Melbourne, FL.Â  Attended 2 speaking sessions with Miss Janet and Nimblewilll Nomad.Â  They are amazing, so happy I was able to meet them.
Finished the day watching the sunset over the mountains at the lodge.Â  Start my hike in the morning.",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Sat",0
