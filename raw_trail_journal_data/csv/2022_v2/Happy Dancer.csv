Happy Dancer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625303,"Got my visa, booked all flights and shuttles, have all my gear complete, did many shakedown hikes and tested them all. Some overnight shakedowns should be done before hiting the trail. Best choise ever was my new back pack, OSPREY EXOS 48+10.
Just waiting for the time to pass and to do my first step on the AT.

Happy X-mas and Happy trails to anybody :-)",,View Entry,"Dec 16, Mon",0
Happy Dancer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625605,"Did a shakedown hike during X-Mas, was a very educational lesson. Love my backpack and my sleeping system. All that gear works great, just some fine tuning to be done. Very excited, can´t wait to let the adventure begin :-)",,View Entry,"Dec 24, Tue",0
Happy Dancer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625835,"I complete this 3rd entry to activate my account ;-)
Did an exhausting 8.1 (13 km) walk with a pack loaded 29 lbs (ca. 13 kg). It was a cold but sunny day. Had lots of steep decents and ascents, which I do love more. To climb up a hill is much more easier for me, cause I am able to control the pace, stop whenever I have to, to take a couple of deep breaths. But walking down is tricky sometimes, the heavy pack pushes and than I am faster than I want to, which could cause any injuries. Thankx God nothing really bad has happend yet.
Can´t wait to let the adventure of my life beginn, counting the days: 63 days to departure, 68 days to take the first step on the Approach trail.
See You there, Happy Trails to everybody and (for my friends at home) enjoy my entries.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Thu",0
Happy Dancer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646380,"Right now I saw my last entry was 2 yrs ago 63 days before my flight to the States. As all of You know Covid hit the world and I postponed my thru hike with the hope to hit the trail in 2021. But in 2021 it was again not supposed to come true :-(
Today 59 days from now to my flight to Atlanta I am praying things won´t change again I can do it this year. Can´t wait to get there, soooo excited, well prepared and ready to go :-)",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Tue",0
