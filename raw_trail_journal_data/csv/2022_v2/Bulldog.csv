Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646298,"Now that I'm beginning journal entries, it's starting to feel real!  Like a John Denver song, except my backpack is packed, and I'm leaving on a mountain trail.  In a little over 2 months I will be on my way to Katahdin.  Not going to use the word maybe.  I WILL make it.  You got it - still trying to convince myself.  But I believe in the power of positive thinking.  😉.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0
Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646299,"As I continue my preparations for this hike, I have to thank friends and family for their support and encouragement!  Thanks to cousin Ken (Mailman, 2014) for all his words of advice.  I've read thru all his journal entries (again).  I have made a few alterations to my plans regarding points on where to stay and/or avoid based on Information in his journals. Heartfelt thanks to my husband Ron!  He has been so supportive and encouraging!  Looking forward to our planned meeting points where we can do some exploring together.  Last but not least, I'm so thankful for my sister Katie!  Excitedly planning this adventure, REI gift cards, and unending enthusiasm!  We've decided I am doing the recon now in preparation for her and I to do a thru hike together in a few years - right Katie?!  But for now, I'm looking forward to her joining me at various locations along the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0
Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646300,"I've got nearly all my gear and successfully gotten it all into my backpack.  Just a few odds and ends to get.  I have gotten familiar with everything, and pretty happy with it all.  Still wondering if I want to switch my sleeping bag for a quilt.  I am going to go thru several more 'drills' putting up and taking down my tent.  I don't want to be stumbling thru the process when it's raining.  I've planned out my whole trek -  every site I plan to pitch my tent, every hostel to spend a night (or 2), every place to resupply.  May be a bit overkill, as I know it will definitely change, but I feel better having a plan.  Plus it's good to give my family an idea of where I will be on any given day.  I wanted to start my hike a year ago, but with COVID, I delayed my start and continued working.  But now I'm retired and ready to go.  I started accumulating my equipment over a year ago.  But I didn't really work on my fitness until about 7 months ago.  I'm sure the trail would whip me into shape eventually, but that's probably a good way to end a thru hike quickly.  I would be setting myself up to injury.  So I started resistance training this past June as well as running - all 5 - 6 days per week.  (Thanks to my husband for getting us outside for the runs each morning!!).  I was nervous that my 65 yr old knees were going to be a problem - they had been hurting and feeling somewhat unstable.  The daily workouts with weights have truly turned things around.  (thank you Fitness with PJ on YouTube!). To anyone who is planning on a journey like this, I would encourage you to physically train as best as you can.  It doesn't have to be Olympics level training.  Do some hikes locally.  Do some lunges and squats.  😁.   Make it a habit to exercise.  Have faith in yourself.  Bulldog",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0
Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647682,"Enjoyed breakfast with my husband Ron and sister Katie.  We walked around the visitor center, sat in on a quick hiker briefing, took a few pictures, and now the adventure begins.  The 8.8 miles approach trail to the AT southern terminus is no joke!  I’d have to look it up but there were over 650 steps just walking to the top of the falls!  And it didn’t get any easier after that!  Fortunately Ron and Katie took my big backpack (45lbs -yikes) and I slack packed, just carrying water, snack, and rain gear.  The hike up to the start point was much more difficult than I had imagined.  I departed the visitor center and arrived at the southern terminus on Springer Mountain at around 4:15.  To add to the glory of this day, there was a young magician at the terminus doing magic tricks for the kids (old and young) who had hiked there.  His name was Ethan (aka Rain).  He was amazing!! I watched so closely but have no idea how he did it.  The only explanation is it was truly magic!  I’ve heard hikers talk about trail angels and trail magic (food and other items for hikers). Trail Angel Ethan provided spiritual trail magic!  He lifted the spirits of so many after a grueling day of hiking.  Walked another mile to meet Ron and Katie to my backpack.  I was too tired and anxious to get to my campsite to take the time to repack my small day pack into my big backpack, do I front loaded the day pack to my front and my big pack on the back.  I must have been quite a sight!  Haha!  Made it to Stover Creek at 6:50 pm, set up my tent and cooked a disappointing dinner of pasta alfredo.  But the hot cocoa was a nice treat.  Best part of the day:  Ron and Katie being here to start this adventure, the people I’ve met, the magic show, and an apple I ate while hiking.  Worst part of day:  pack too heavy, feet hurt, and I miss my hubby!","Amicalola Falls visitor center

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647683,"I had planned to hike 12.9 miles to Gooch Mountain shelter.  Easy, right?  When I started planning for this hike I was either waaaay to optimistic, or ridiculously over confident in my abilities!  🥴. Got up at 7:30, had breakfast, packed up, and got on the trail at 9:30.  I need to get faster at packing up.  The forecasted rain storm rolled in just before 11:00, first as a light sprinkle for a while.  The canopy of trees seemed to keep me dry.  By noon it was a steady downpour.  And I committed my first bad decision of the hike - I chose not to put on my rain suit because I was sure my campsite was ‘just a little further’.  Wrong!  I finally came to Hawk Mountain shelter at 1:00 and stopped for the day.  For the past hour the trail was like walking down the middle of a mountain stream.  The wind and rain made it a challenge to set up the tent.  Maybe it was due to hysteria but now I’m laughing at this point as I must have looked ridiculous trying to wrangle the rain fly over the frame to hook to the footprint so I can erect my tent under cover and at least keep that dry.  Glad I had rehearsed this at home - just wish I wouldn’t have had to do it so soon into the journey.  Got into dry clothes, hung the wet ones up in the shelter, and quickly got back into my tent.  Spent the rest of the day napping and reading the guidebook.  Later in the evening went from being comfy to running a fever.  Talk about being miserable.  Apparently the sore throat I had  on Thursday before leaving home was something more than allergies.  Had peanut butter on a tortilla with ibuprofen as my side dish.  Praying for sun tomorrow.","Stover Creek shelter

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647684,"Considering my intermittent fever, snot factory, and cough, I called for a shuttle into Dahlonega GA.  Two other hikers (Someday and Lomson) rode into town with me to make adjustments, resupply, and dry out.  Went to see a physician, and was given antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection.  Hung my tent up to dry, enjoyed a long hot shower, and did laundry.  So nice to have dry, warm clothes on!  Not much choice for restaurants - McDonald’s pretty much it.  Tried to eat something but just felt too rotten.  Had a midnight snack of ramen that did hit the spot.  Planning to stay a second day to conquer this infection with antibiotics and NyQuil.  Best part of day enjoying company of fellow hikers; warm bed, room, shower, and ramen.  Worst part:  having to get off trail, and missing my hubby!","Hawk Mountain shelter

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647685,"No plans for today.  Only medications, fluids, and rest.  I have reassessed and reorganized my backpack.  Talked with hubby, sister, and a friend back home.  It was so nice to hear their voices.  Frustrating to be stalled so early into the hike.  But I am still looking forward to getting back out there.  I am truly blessed.","

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647782,"Continue to fight this URI.  Frustrated that it seems to be taking longer than I'd hoped.  NyQuil - you are failing me!  I hate missing out on hiking on such a beautiful, sunny day.  But all is not lost - here comes my knight in shining armor (aka Honda CR-V)!  My husband has driven to Dahlonega to take me home to recover!  What a wonderful surprise!  Plan is to return to trail Friday morning.  I will resume my journal then.  Stay safe hikers!","

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648052,"Feeling much better, thanks to antibiotics, steroid shot, fluids, rest, and TLC from my wonderful husband!  Hopefully the fresh mountain air will help me recover completely.  The weather is cold, with harsh, cold wind.  I started out wearing every layer I had!  The mountains that I crossed certainly helped me warn up.  Sassafras Mountain was a challenge, but certainly wasn't bad enough to discourage me.  I stopped at Gooch Moyntain shelter for the night.  The gusty winds made tent set up like wrangling cats!!  But I'm getting pretty proficient.  First time experience of collecting and filtering my mountain water.  Delicious and refreshing.  My dinner was a PB&J bagel and juicy apple I brought from home this morning.  Nice treat!  looking forward to tomorrow with both excitement and a little dread.  I hear Blood Mountain is pretty brutal.  I'll just keep going - one foot in front of the other!","Hightower Gap

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648053,"Becoming more proficient at getting packed up and out of camp now.  Down from 2 hours to 1 hour.  Headed out at 0830. The chilly temps helped me move quickly too.  Anxious to get hiking and warm up.  There were beautiful views (Preaching Rock). Lots of day hikers to visit with.  Got to Jarrard Gap around 1730.  Lots of gusty cold wind on the gap, but several of us hikers set up our tents on the side of a hill that blocked the winds.  Thank goodness because it was cold enough!  Tomorrow will be the challenge of Blood Mountain - highest elevation so far at 4459 ft.","Gooch Mountain shelter

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648054,"Up and out of camp in 50 minutes.  Blood Mountain was pretty brutal, but I think coming down was more difficult, tricky boulders to navigate at times.  I have felt lucky so far to have had no blisters, cuts, etc.  However, by the time I got to Neel Gap, I couldn't bear weight on my knee.  So frustrating - there was no specific point of injury.  I would say it's a combination of downhill hiking and a backpack that is way too heavy.  So, my husband, being the saint that he is, came to my rescue.  Heading home again.","Jarrard Gap

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649748,"Update:  Good news is I don't need surgery!  Woohoo!  Bad news is MRI shows subcondylar (?) stress fracture which means no running or hiking/backpacking until end of June.  Given my sloth-like pace, I know I can't make it all the way to Katahdin this year.  Sooo, guess I'm resigned to maybe doing section hikes this summer when I'm able, and then finishing next summer.  Not how I had planned it, but just have to be flexible.  And, my backpack will be MUCH lighter when I return to the trail.  (smile)Best wishes of calm breezes and sunny skies for all the hikers still out there!To be continued..........","
