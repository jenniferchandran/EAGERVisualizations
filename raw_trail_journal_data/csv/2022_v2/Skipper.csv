Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652497,"What a great day to start a hike! We woke up in Stroudsburg Hampton Inn and loaded up for the hour drive to High Point. We spent about 30 minutes at the car shaking down and saying goodbyes to Jordan and Susan. It was hot and sunny (high 92F) but breezy and easy trail. Arrived at the Secret Shelter about 4:00 and met Swollen, Hanky, and the resident donkey, Jake. We set up tents and made dinner (chili Mac). Jasper and I took a shower at the outdoor shower head. This shelter is on private land and is made available to hikers on the trail. The AT crosses the driveway and the shelter is a short walk from the trail. 
All in all the day was a great start. Everyone is in high spirits.","High Point State Park Headquarters. New Jersey

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652550,"Left secret shelter last this morning and slow-walked about 2 miles into Unionville NY. Horlers General Store had much to offer for breakfast: bagels with cream cheese, gatorades, coffee, candy. We hung out on the front porch eating and charging phones for about 30 minutes.
Today was much cooler than yesterday. We hiked through some pastures, did some road walking (saw a huge gopher tortoise!) and circumnavigated the Wallkill Nature Preserve. We detoured to a vacant house to refill water bottles from the spigot before arriving at the shelter around 3:00. 
Swollen, the section hiker we met at the secret shelter, was already set up when we got to the shelter. We set up inside the shelter just before two other hikers-Margaritaville and Lightyear- rolled in. They are campus ministers at Virginia Tech. Dinner was Mountain House flavors around the picnic table with the three others. The rain started and we climbed into the shelter with M & L - We scooched over and made room for 7 people in the 6 person shelter. They offered some great advice and we traded riddles until the sun went down. 
The shelter was mice-free and kept us dry in some hard rain.","Secret Shelter 
",Pochuck Mountain Shelter,"Jun 01, Wed",7.10
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652628,"We got into the Pochuck Valley boardwalks today. The trail crosses a wetland for about a mile on an elevated boardwalk with a suspension bridge. Lots of Redwinged Blackbirds in the marsh. Walking on hard surface felt strange! 
Heaven Hills Farm was at mile 6.5. It was a bakery/farmers market/ nursery. We raided the ice cream stand and got drinks, too. Had lunch outside with Swollen and met a NOBO doing 35 mile days. His pack was smaller than what kids at school carry down the halls. He had started way before us and was ending way after us. All kinds are out here. 
A steep climb up The Stairway to Heaven followed. It was a “Georgia Mountain” and we took a long break at the top watching a rain storm to the west cover successively closer ridges. We packed up as the temperature dropped and started walking. The forest got remarkably dark just before the rain started. It turned the trail into a river in short order and we were walking with wet socks and shoes. Everyone stayed in high spirits. 
Mile 9.6 was Trail Magic! Our first. The boys came on a blue cooler sitting about 30 yards into the woods from the Barrett Road crossing. A journal on top wishes us well while sodas, gatorades, and candy bars boosted morale after the downpour. We hiked on glad to know trail magic was alive!
We pushed on to Wawayanda Shelter where we saw Swollen again. I tossed several water bottles in an empty pack to go get water from the park office. It was an easy 0.3 mile walk to a spigot. When I got back Swollen had called a shuttle to take him to the Warwick Drive In movie theater. While he was on the phone with the driver he asked if there was room for 6.  The guy (Mike) said he’d make two trips! So we hoofed it to the road and spent 30 minutes getting all of us into Warwick by 5:30. On the walk from the road to the shelter I call Jim in Greenwod Lakes - proprietor of Lake Lodging - and arranged for a room the following night. Greenwood Lake is 10 trail miles north. He also agreed to meet us at the theater at 9 in the morning tomorrow to pick up our stuff and shuttle us back to the trail. So we’re slackpacking tomorrow to ice cream and a stay indoors!Upon arrival at the Warwick Drive In we got tents set up on the hill overlooking the 3 movie screens. Then the 6 of us left out gear and walked across the road to the burger place for $15 hamburgers. They lived up to the price! A candy resupply at Shoprite and a walk back to the theater followed. We got back at 8:30 just before Top Gun Maverick started. The drive in has loaner radios for hikers so we could hear the audio. The boys stayed up and watched the whole movie. Joni and I fell asleep to the sounds of afterburners.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652660,"There was uncertainty this morning about how we would get back to the trail. Mike had brought us from 17 A to the Warwick drive-in but I had not arranged a way to get us from the Drive in back to the trail. Jim was scheduled to meet us at 9 o’clock at the Warwick theater to pick our stuff up and take it to Greenwood Lake so that we could slack pack today. When he arrived he was in a pick up truck but told us that he could shuttle the six of us back to the trail in two trips. Joni and Baxter had gone to the nearby bagel shop to get breakfast. So I sent Jasper to meet them before getting in the truck with Swollen and Grayson. Jasper, Joni, and Baxter followed shortly behind.
The map has the following warning for this section of trail: “despite the unimposing profile, rocks and abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging.” The profile map is fairly flat but the warning proved true. The ridge we hiked most of the day overlooking Greenwood lake was sharp and rocky. When the trail gets more difficult the boys seem to lean in to it. The weather was hot and breezy and made for pleasant hiking sans packs. 
We spent much of the day counting Eastern Newts on the trail. In their juvenile stages they are small and bright red. They are slow and harmless (unless eaten) but they are fun to spot! 
We officially crossed into New York today!
Bellvale Creamery was at the road crossing where Jim was meeting us. Double scoop waffle cones for everyone and a chocolate milk for me. Joni had gone inside with the boys while I watched our stuff. Baxter come out with a mass of dairy in-hand. I asked, “How much did that cost!?” He shrugged and said “Idunno” to the amusement of the onlookers. Joni followed shortly behind. I asked her the same question. “Six-fifty”, to which Baxter exclaimed “What a deal!”  
Jim arrived in a Subaru Impreza. We said goodbye to Swollen before Joni and the boys piled into the backseat. 
We arrived in Greenwood Lake in less than 10 minutes. Jim gave us a short driving tour of the town before heading to Lake Lodging, his 8-room motel just outside town. Showers and YouTube on the TV occupied the next hour. Joni and I left the boys to go to the CVS for candy and drinks, then on to Planet Pizza. Walking back, Joni said “we’ve become those people on the side of the road walking with bags.” For better or for worse…
Joni got a banging taco salad from the nearby food truck and we enjoyed our drinks and hot meals together on the porch of the motel. The slackpack and the motel worked out so well today that we arranged with Jim to do it all again tomorrow!","NJ 17A - Warwick Turnpike

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652548,"Ate some killer breakfast sandwiches from the food truck in Greenwood Lake. Crammed 5 packs and 6 people into a small Subaru Impreza and headed to the trail at NY 17 where Fred doled out his Trail Magic yesterday. We spent the 10-mile walk today through a beautiful forest in incredible weather. Hardwoods and poplars were spaced widely across boulder strewn knolls and hollows. Ferns and grass filled in the undergrowth. Songbirds we’re everywhere. We passed many trail runners and day hikers sharing the morning with us.
We had hoped to swim at Tiorati Lake but learned after the 0.3 mile detour that the lake was closed. We ate lunch at the picnic tables, availed ourselves of the bathrooms and water bottle station, and headed back to the AT. 
Mountain House for dinner. Hung our food bags. Laid down in the tents at 6:45. My third attempt at mattress repair has failed. I’ll try again sometime tomorrow. I’m glad I opted to bring an extra foam pad!
We’re camping without a rain fly tonight and enjoying the cool weather.","NY 17
",William Brien Shelter,"Jun 05, Sun",9.90
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652606,"Woke up slowly this morning and left camp just before 9:00. This was our first morning trying hot drinks for breakfast so that slowed us down some.
We came to Black Mountain pretty soon and got our first view of the NYC skyline. We took a break there for awhile in the shade. 
The Palisades Parkway is a busy 4 lane that the trail crosses. The AT has been rerouted to the north so that hikers can cross the parkway on a bridge. It added about a mile to the walk today and took some careful attention (lots of intersecting trails) but we got through it fine. 
We climbed Bear Mountain, got water from the vending machine (sob in dollars) and checked out the view of the Hudson River from the observation tower.
I spent a lot of the day thinking about what’s in my pack and what I could get rid of or trade for lighter options. My pack isn’t getting as light as I had hoped (as it usually does after eating food and burning fuel). We planned every piece of gear we’re carrying (right down to the frisbee) but actually carrying it all for a week helps bring focus to what’s really important. Pounds are about to get shaved!
A steep downhill got us to Bear Mountain Recreation area. Grayson and I still want to swim but the lake there is closed (like yesterday!) and we didn’t have time for the public pool. We cooked dinner there and ate about 4:00. I attempted another Fox of the leaky sleeping pad - I think this is number 4.
This would have been a good place to stop but there was no camping and we didn’t want to spend money on another hotel room in nearby Fort Montgomery. So we pushed on another 3 miles to Hemlock Springs Campsite.
Getting across the Hudson was a little dicey. We crossed Bear Mountain Bridge on foot. It’s a two lane suspension bridge over the river with sidewalks on both sides. As we neared the far shore we realized we’d need to cross the road. The crossing was not standard and traffic was busy but tailing off for the day. We made it across with the help of a heads-up driver who stopped a lane of traffic for us. 
Just before getting to the campsite, Margaritaville and Lightyear caught up with us. They had gotten off trail for a wedding and spent two days catching up with us. They’ll pass us for the last time in the morning. We picked their brains again on food, clothing, tents, and budget. We haven’t had a chance to talk it over together yet but it’s good to get another perspective on how to do this hike. 
Hung a bear bag. Dunked my salty shirt in the creek. Laid down on the sleeping pad to see if my patch attempt works. So far so good…","William Brien Shelter
",Hemlock Springs Campsite,"Jun 06, Mon",12.30
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652638,"I awoke this morning to the sound of our bear hang hitting the ground. It’s a sound like your own baby crying in a room full of crying babies. It was about 6:45 - not typically bear raiding time. I asked Joni if she heard it and she said Baxter had gone to get the food. He pulled the slip knot securing the hang and the whole lot - 5 bags together - fell about 25 feet out of the tree. Thankfully nothing was damaged except a breakfast essentials packet (exploded) and thankfully Baxter wasn’t standing under it. No single one of the bags is very heavy but the group of them is probably close to 15 pounds. Breakfast was delivered!
We left camp around 8:00 headed for the Appalachian Market 3.8 miles away. There were rumors of a short-order grill on premises. 
The 3.8 miles was nearly certainly our fastest stretch so far. We covers that ground in about an hour and a half. Appalachian Market did not disappoint! Though really just a fancy convenience store, it had everything we could have possibly wanted. We resupplied for the next three days (bars, honeybuns, cookies, oatmeal, candy, tuna packs, Knorr sides, cereal, pop tarts, etc). They offered a full menu for breakfast. Jasper got a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. I got the same with “double everything “.  The others went for the baked goods. There was a big TV in the bathroom viewable from the commode. 
We keep saying “goodbye” to Margaritaville and Lightyear - they left camp before us this morning- but they were wrapping up their Appalachian Market experience about the time we got there. It was fun to compare notes again. 
We spent close to $170 in that convenience store! The boys were giddy at the amount of “treats” we loaded onto the counter at checkout in 2 full baskets. It was a fun stop and a good lesson on the savings of buying in bulk.
The rule-of-thumb for trail budget is $1000 per person per month.  This rule is typically applied to groups of 1 (?) or 2. A group of 5 gets some economy-of-scale when it comes to the $1000 rule. The room at Greenwood Lake, for example, was $120 for 5 people. The price for the same room for 2 people was $80.  That’s a per-person price of $20 vs $40!  I think we’ll benefit from this “phenomenon” in many places. The Appalachian Market is not one of those places.
The rumor on the trail today was burger trail magic at Dennytown road. That was a 12 mile day for us right on the heels of a 13er. Burgers worked like a magnet, though, and we arrived at Dennytown Road at 4:30 just as the crew was packing up to leave. Rain was moving in and they were moving out! They had left 5 burgers (all-the-way) together with a box of chips, oranges, sodas, and beer (& real stroopwaffles!) and were just about to pull away when we arrived. Honeybag and Digits are two Dutch brothers we met briefly at Pochuck Mountain Shelter. Their parents and sister were here in the states to meet up with them. They decided to do some trail magic while here. Lightyear and Margaritaville had let them know we were pushing hard to get there and expected to arrive before 5. I’m glad they passed on the message! Dinner is easy when someone else cooks!
We inhaled the trail magic, said our thank-yous and goodbyes, and headed into the nearby campsite to set up camp before the rain. We’re in a large field that gets regular maintenance. Porta potties, picnic tables, and fire rings. The tents were set up quickly while I went to hang the bear line. 
I’ve got bear bag hanging pretty well scienced-out. I’ve never had one taken (though I don’t know how many “attempts” have been made) and I’ve never lost a line in a tree. My streak is over. The rock sack I threw to carry the line over the high limb landed exactly on the limb in a fork. I thought pulling it down would be easy but it was stuck fast. A quad-advantage pulling-rig didn’t budge it. I tied a second rock to the loose end and threw it over in hopes that pulling from a different direction would help. That rock flew amiss and started a series of over-and-backs that ended with both ends in the tree (rock sack attached). It was a good bear line. We have 2 more in our inventory. I chose a lower-less challenging branch and got the kitty hing just before the rain began. 
It’s raining now though not particularly strong. Forecast says rain all night. Bring it on! It makes a great sound machine!","Hemlock Springs Campsite
",Dennytown Road Campsite,"Jun 07, Tue",12.30
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652688,"Said goodbye to the bear line this morning (see yesterday’s entry) and stopped by the park spigot on the way out to refill bottles. The school bus was poised in the parking lot ready to make its morning run. School runs Sept thru June here. 
Canopus Lake was about 6 miles in. It has a public beach with all the amenities (concession stand, outdoor showers, electrical outlets, shady picnic tables) but is closed to car traffic on weekdays until summer begins. This means that we would have the beach and lake to ourselves!
The first six miles was a blur. I did develop a “hotspot” under my left heel. Instead of stopping to doctor it properly, I traded the shoe for a Croc and walked the last mile-and-a-half with mismatched shoes. It worked out better than expected. I can’t decide if Crocs are on the weight-savings chopping block or not. 
The lake lived up to the hype we created for it. The water was perfect, sun was hot, and breeze was strong (to dry our stuff out)! There was no one else on the lake or at the beach. On a busy day I’m sure there are several hundred people here. We spent two hours soaking it all in. We filled water bottles on the way out and headed to RPH Shelter. 
RPH is in a suburban area. Even now I can hear the road. Houses are viewable from the “back porch”.  There is a 45 gallon trash can inside - unseen anywhere else in a shelter for fear of critters big and small. Three bunks and a large back porch will keep the incoming rain off of us. 
RPH is maintained by a dedicated group of volunteers. They’ve really done it up right here! The privy has a dozen signs sporting all shades of bathroom humor. There are maybe 40 one gallon jugs of water here for refills. The yard has recently been cut. There are me yes in the table for about 5 different delivery restaurants. 
We chose Chinese! Forty five minutes (and 75 dollars!) later we had all the chickens: orange, sweet & sour, General Tsaos, and sesame. Rice and sauces rounded out the feast. The broccoli was a nice surprise! 
We’re settling in our bunks now. Baxter is in the floor and Jasper on a laid-back lounge chair on the back porch. It looks like rain tonight and throughout the morning tomorrow. Here’s to good sleep!","Dennytown Road Campsite
",Ralph’s Peak Hiker Shelter,"Jun 08, Wed",10.70
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652734,"The rain was hard and steady last night starting around 2:00. I know it was around 2:00 because that was also the time that the sleeping pad lost enough air   to be considered “flat”. I thought I had solved it! The forecast had the rain continuing through noon. We were all pleasantly surprised when the rain abated with the sunrise. Forecasts changed and the day looked like it would be dry.We shared the shelter with The Nomads (a married couple flip-flopping from Harper’s Ferry), Smiles (a fifty-something guy on his second attempt - first was in ‘99), Wings (late in, first out), and Trouble (came in at 11:30 with a screaming bright red headlamp).We packed up dry gear into dry packs, let the Frisbee - not thrown in 9 days - in the hiker box, used the privy one last time, and headed out. Destination: Corrado’s Pizza and Mountaintop Deli 5 miles away. The boys have found their stride and really have only one gear. We have a standing rule that all regroup at road crossings or trail junctions. They’ve started leaving one as a “lookout” for Joni or me coming who relays our approach to the leaders who continue on. The definition of a “short stretch” has gotten longer over the past few days. Three miles was a chore last week and is now becoming an easy chunk. So the 5 miles from RPH to pizza was another blur. Corrado’s and The Mountaintop Deli are separate ventures sharing a biking about a 10 minute road walk from the trail. They’ve got picnic tables out back with outlets & a spigot. The pizza is respectable and the resupply options (at the deli) are adequate. We stayed for about 2 hours dillying and dallying. Joni called our Camp Glisson friend and Roadtrip ‘99 comrade Ashley G in Milford CT. They hatched a plan for Ashley to pick us up in Kent CT on Sunday afternoon and take us an hour east to her house. We’ll stay with her & her family Sunday AND Monday night and get back to the trail on Tuesday. This will be our first “zero”!  We’ll put together a 13-miler tomorrow filled by two 8s and be in Kent Sunday mid-afternoon. We’re all looking forward to that!The Nomads were at the pizzeria when we arrived. They left and soon after were replaced by “Grasshopper” and “Around the Corner”. We met this father-son duo first on day 2 at the Wallkill Nature Preserve. We saw them again at Bear Mountain near the bridge as they headed for a hotel room. They caught us again at the pizzeria. These two pairs of hikers have been on trail since Harper’s Ferry but have had to take time off for injury and recuperation. They are near their 400 -mile mark and are about 40 days into their hike. We may be falling in with them over the next several days. We’ll see if our mileages line up. We left Corrado’s and hiked back up the hill. We hadn’t been a mile before Joni struck up a conversation with a lady from Lilburn who knows Jordan (Joni’s dad). Small world. We took pics together and walked with them for a bit until we got our 100 mile mark! Making it there felt like a bigger milestone than I thought it would. The boys said “now we do that 21 more times. Doesn’t seem that hard!”  Hopefully they’re correct. Joni and I talked lightweight tents for a piece today. Our two tents are palatial and double-walled. They are head-turners on the trail since everyone else is pretty minimalist. We love these tents and chose them carefully with the thru hike and road-trip camping in mind. (For the gear nerds they are the 3- and 4-man Copper Spur tents by Big Agnes. Five stars). The bummer is their weight. Together with their ground cloths they might tip 10 pounds. That’s on-par with per-person weights out here if not a little high. More to come on this topic I’m sure. We arrived at the shelter and did shelter things. No rain tonight so we’re headed n tents. Dinner, bear hangs, hygiene, and relaxation. I’m sharing the 4-man tent with Jasper and Grayson. Baxter is in the 3-man with Texas Pete. Day 10 done. We’re doing it!","Ralph’s Peak Hiker Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652804,"Late Evening. Stealth Tenting about a mile north of NY22. Sharing a tent with Baxter and Jasper. Day 11.
Almost as soon as we started hiking at High Point SP we started passing stone walls in the woods. They are all made with rocks as big as could be carried by a man, are no more than 3 feet high, and are most often haphazardly stacked. Their lines have been carefully planned and we’ve passed only a very few that have been laid by a craftsman - stacked with care creating vertical sides, sharp corners, and flat tops. 
These walls, which must have taken days, weeks, months of labor are now being reclaimed by the forest within the AT corridor. We’ve passed several dozen of these walls and there are certainly many more to e trail doesn’t pass within view of. 
Robert Frost wrote a poem called “The Woodpile” about a split cord of maple cut and stacked deep in the woods. It’s last lines:
 I thought that only
 Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
 Could so forget his handiwork on which
 He spent himself, the labor of his ax,
 And leave it there far from a useful fireplace
  To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
 With the slow smokeless burning of decay.
It is a welcome distraction to imagine the men working to build these walls, perhaps carrying one rock at a time while the plow runs through a newly cleared patch of forest.The Appalachian Trail is sometimes derisively called “the green tunnel” - a moniker that is a sideways dig at the lack of views and the abundance of forest hiking. Other long distance trails in the US cross peaks twice as high as the AT and spend days of miles above tree line.  Even those who love the AT must nod in agreement since the name is an apt description of the trail.The miles of is morning and those of this afternoon are all a mash of trail and trees. It is a great season for leaf identification. Today was one of our longer days and the first 5 miles took an effort. We stopped before noon for a short lunch break about 6 miles from our dinner destination - NY 22, where there was a rumor of food truck and a “hiker friendly” plant nursery.  Word of the food truck set the boys alight and we did the next 6 miles in under 3 hours (quite a feat for us). We crossed railroad tracks and set up in the gazebo of the nursery. They sell refreshments so we bought 9 Klondike Bars in various flavors and 5 gatorades. Joni walked to the food truck with Baxter and Grayson and ordered a chicken dish from the Malaysian food truck.The railroad track ran right by the nursery. Grayson and Joni collet “pressed pennies” from the souvenir machines on our road-trips. So we laid several coins on the railroad tracks and waited. I have done this before with slow-moving freight trains in Oakwood. The train that came by our coins was doing 60+ mph! The coins took awhile to find afterwards and some are still there for future discovery.We cooked dinner (Knorr sides and tuna) about 4:00 and were walking back to the trail at 5:00. A mile or more through fresh cut hay pastures and up the mountainside brought us to two tent sites. We threw down, set up, brushes teeth, hung bear bags, and are sailing down for the night.Two short days to Kent. We need graph paper and ziploc bags.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652861,"“You won’t get your trial legs until you’ve hiked three weeks.”
Or six weeks. Or a month. Or 100 miles. Or. Or. Or. This saying is thrown around with all the different permutations. The idea is that eventually a thru hiker’s body will optimize itself to hike. Joni and I have been careful to try to keep the mileages around 10 per day for these first two weeks. Todays plan was 8 miles after doing 12+ yesterday. We woke up and the boys got into the flow. I was just keeping up. The Diesel and the Dirtbikes. The trail legs seems to be getting under us.
We arrived at the planned destination (Ten Mile Shelter) at 12:15 feeling good. Bulls Bridge Country Store was a short 1.5 miles ahead a little off the trail. So we ate a snack lunch and rolled on. We crossed the Ten Mile River at its confluence with the Housatonic - I’m a fan of confluences. BBCS was down a blue-blazed side trail. The boys blasted past it and Joni - guessing what had happened when she arrived at the junction and the boys weren’t there - continued white-blazing in pursuit. I got to the junction and no one was there. I, too, guessed what had happened but headed to the store. The white blazes would hit a road very soon, the boys would wait, Joni would catch them and turn everyone down the road to the store. All’s well that ends well. It was an easy mistake with an easy fix this time and a good opportunity to talk about the dangers of “autopilot”.
BBCS had all the hiker vices. We raided the electrolyte drinks and the ice cream cooler and sat outside at the picnic tables for about 30 minutes. We took inventory of our food keeping in mind we’ll be leaving the trail (temporarily) tomorrow morning. We added two Jumbo honeybuns and a bag of Jolly Ranchers to the stock, refilled water bottles, and set out for a campsite (this one) 5 miles away. 
There was a “Georgia Climb” right off the bat. Georgia really is a stout stretch of trail. I’m sure we’ll get into more “vert” in places and we have, admittedly, started in a relatively easy section of trail. It is nice that the boys can look at an imposing section of profile map and say “We’re from Georgia. Bring it on.”
Surprises so far:
Joni eats honeybuns. The boys really are pros at camping. We’re with a scout troop tonight and Grayson can camp circles around these guys. Restaurant food abundance. The amont of FUN we’re having in the weeks that are typically some of the hardest. 
Our plan is the hike to the Kent welcome center in the morning. Hopefully we can dodge the morning rain. (We’ve gotten hard rain 5 times and have been in shelter or tent for 4 of those. A veritable AT miracle). Ashley will meet us mid afternoon and return us the trail Tuesday morning. We’re shooting for Great Barrington MA where we’ll meet Neil and Karen Denowitz. We’ve sent food and gear to them via Jordan and Susan and have also shipped a few orders to them. We’ll zero in Great Barrington and are trying to concoct a way to not be there on a weekend. Hotel rates are higher and more so in the “resort” town. 
We crossed into Connecticut today! Goodbye to New York. We loved it! There were several spots in NY that were idyllic. Harriman State Park in June will be a favorite of mine. Greenwood Lake was a gem. The boulders-in-ferns dotted with maples - home to the Vireo, midday songbird - are the hallmark here.","Stealth Site NY22

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652890,"We passed Bulls Bridge Country Store this afternoon doing 60 miles per hour headed to Milford CT. What had been 16 trail miles and a day-plus-a-morning of hiking was rewound in the span of 10 minutes. 
We were out of camp this morning before the scouts were out of their tents. The threat of rain had abated so our need to press hard into Kent had diminished as well. We still made the 3.2 miles to the road in about an hour and a half. The welcome center was on the north side of town 0.9 miles from the trail. The outskirts of town were sleepy on this Sunday morning but Kent itself was a bustle. Coffee shops and Knick knack stores were already catering to the weekenders. We, ourselves were a bit of a curiosity - real AT backpackers walking into town. We were greeted on the sidewalk by a thirties-something dad who chatted us up and pointed us to the welcome center. On meeting him & his family a second time later that morning we got an invite to their Lake Winnipesaukee lake house in July. We’ll see if that pans out. 
The welcome center was a very small building built with the hiker in mind. Public Restrooms, porch, outlets, bottle filler, and a coin operated shower in the back made this a great base of operations for the next 3 hours. We hit up the coffee shop for lattes and milkshakes and bought a roll of quarters. Then went back to the welcome center and took shower shifts. The other flip-flippers arrived after their in-town brunch and joined the shower queue. 
I took the boys to IGA for lunch (to save money) and we walked out with $55 of food. We spent some time in the bookstore and lazed in the grass. Ashley arrived at about 2:00 with brownies and chips wearing her homemade “Trail Magic” shirt. Old friends are great to meet again. 
We’ve overtaken the basement room with gear and mattresses. The boys got in some video gaming with the Grant-Ekhart crew. We ate a great dinner and caught up with Ashley and Adam. Their kids are off to school tomorrow while we plan on making some big box store runs for gear and food. For want of a comfortable sleep pad I’ve settled for quantity of sleep since the quality has been poor.

We woke up slowly after a great nights sleep. The Grant-Eckhart kids were all headed to school at different times before 8:30. We cooked sausage and pancakes for breakfast. Ashley had church duties for much of the morning but Adam was around all day - he’s on sabbatical. Joni and I borrowed the minivan and left the boys playing Switch to go run errands. We hit the first three on the list above before coming back home. We put the boys in the van early afternoon and did the Dicks/Staples/Walmart stop before settling down at Barnes and Noble for an hour or so. Pizza for dinner. Fortnite ad nauseum. Phone calls home. Video editing. Repacking food and gear. Laundry. Showers. “Where’s my <<whatever>>?!?”. And then lights out in the basement. Joni is finishing this past weeks video and the boys are making fart noises in the dark. They are fun friends. Adam recently did the “Maryland Challenge” for the 7th time. He runs/hikes the 42 miles of AT in MD in a 24 hour span. Could Jasper and I do this on our southbound hike? Adam and I discussed the possibility. We’ll head back to the trail in the morning.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652992,"We’re back up in the woods behind an old homestead within view of the Housatonic River. It feels good to be back in trail though the rest at the Grant-Eckhart’s was exquisite. I won’t say it was past due but we probably won’t do another 13-day stretch on trail for quite awhile. We got out of the door this morning at about 8:40 after a hearty breakfast and goodbyes to the kids. Adam drove us back to Kent and parked at 341. We all “suited up” and hit the trail again. Adam planned to walk the three miles with us to Caleb’s Peak. The boys set a good pace and rolled about 2 miles before stopping for water at a brook. We pressed on another mile to the summit - really just a ridgetop - and threw down packs for a lunch break at about 12:30. Adam didn’t take any time to cool down before heading back to the car. He enjoys moving!The ridge-top had several 10+ foot boulders on it. Boulders this size get to ridge-tops riding glaciers. The ridge-top we were on was matched by another, equally high ridge to the east across the Housatonic River Valley. We soon found out how steep-sided the valley was as the trail dove off the slope to the river. It was pretty dicey downhill though boulder strewn alleys as we descended 600 feet in about three-quarters of a mile.The trail dumped out next to the river and spent the rest of the day in a broad, level, forested floodplain rising with the river as we walked up-stream. After arriving at camp Grayson and I set out on an adventure. Google Maps showed a creamery across the river and about a half-mile upstream from our campsite. So Grayson and I donned Crocs and headed for the creamery. The Housatonic is a wide, shallow river (mostly) so finding a spot to ford was easy. We crossed the river onto railroad tracks and walked to the lower field of the creamery. We would have been a strange site had we been spotted. We came though the fields and cattle runs to the back of the operation. We found a gate leading to the front and we were there. It was a self-serve, honor system gig. We got 4 cold drinks and some creamed honey and headed back. We counted 2 foxes, 2 cats, 12 cows (up close!), and a dead tree that had been run over by the train. Very interesting!  Mashed potatoes with bacon bits and cheese for dinner. Candy for dessert (thanks Doug!). It feels good to be back out.","CT 341 - Kent

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653057,"Late evening.  Day 16.The man who has one clock always knows what time it is. The man with two clocks is never quite sure. 
I belong to a small sliver of the population born as early as 1975 and as late as 1983. We lived all of our formative years without cell phones. I had graduated college and taught school for a year before getting a phone. I was old enough to “grow up” without. But I was also young enough to be comfortable with the technology and it’s possibilities. A cell phone in 2003 might still be considered “early adoption”. In short - I was old enough to live without while young enough that “diving in” was natural. As a result, I have a very take-it-or-leave-it attitude about digital connection. I feel this dichotomy daily, especially as I teach teens about digital tech and the benefits and unintended consequences it brings. I was looking forward to walking away from the digital tether. I supposed that being on the trail would eliminate the need for a device and it’s connectedness. 
Instead, we have an astonishing amount of information about the trail at our fingertips. We have two paper resources: AWOL’s guide and Anti Gravity Gear’s pocket maps. Then we’ve got digital resources: Far Out, Gaia GPS, Google Maps, atforecast, and search engines. Just the convenience of being able to make a phone call from the trail is hard to overstate whether for a shuttle or hotel reservation. 
Today, all four of the resources we have for trail data gave conflicting information on how long our hike was. We could see at lunchtime that there were discrepancies - between 3 and 6.6 miles of discrepancies. That makes planning difficult! 
Then I think of Shackleton, the Corps of Discovery, the Apollo missions, John Wesley Powell, George Mallory, my friend Josh - thru hiker in 1996. These people had astonishingly small amounts of information with which to plan. “Is the next shelter in 0.2 miles or 8? Dunno. I’ll keep walking.” What a different experience that must have been. I am envious. 
I do think this wealth of information is one of the reasons we can bring our kids along. It allows us to make good decisions on weather, carry less weight since we can anticipate resupply options, and save money by comparing our shopping location possibilities. 
A solar EMP would cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people but I wonder if we wouldn’t enjoy a simpler life for awhile. (Please don’t ostracize me for this opinion if a solar EMP were to happen…)
We cranked out what we think is about 12.8 miles today. It was a humid day with temps in the high 70s. We’ve been walking through an “outbreak” of gypsy moth caterpillars for the past 3 days. They destroy the canopy, poop on our heads as we walk, stain our shirts and skin if they get smashed, and occasionally sting. I count 4 on our tent now. There are millions on the ground and in the trees. We thought, early on, that we could hear them munching leaves but later realized that it’s their little poop pellets raining from the trees. It’s as unpleasant as it sounds. We hope to hike out of them soon but who knows? Not even Google.
The picture at the beginning of the post was from the three-ish miles of riverwalk we did this morning. It was cool, flat, and invigorating. The river was waking up. A birder would have been giddy - Great Blue Heron, swallows on the hunt, kingfisher, and many more I could hear and see but can’t yet identify. If there was a long distance trail of just river walking I’d sign up! Foothills Trail is close!
We’re battened down for rain tonight and tomorrow morning. Maybe a posh deli for lunch in Falls Village?","Stony Brook Campsite

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653129,"We walked 16+ miles today - a long haul for us and our longest day ever. Here’s the story of how it went down. 
I awoke this morning at 5:40. Joni was awake too. She said, “The rain begins at 7:00.” 
“Can I lay here for 10 more minutes?”  But I didn’t. I knew getting out before the rain would be better than trying to pack up in it. So we set to stuffing all the big things into their small bags. As we were about finished inside the tent we heard Baxter awake in the other. He got tent #2 moving. We were walking trail north at 6:20 with a breakfast in our bellies. We often leave camp after 8:30. On a good day we’ll get out at 8. We’ve never come close to 6:20. 
With easy terrain, cool temps, and the threat of rain hanging over us like the sword of Damocles. The forecast pushed the rain back to 8:00 with 96% chance. Eight came and went and still all we got was a spitting. We kept hiking. 
At 9:20 we reached Falls Village and the Falls Village Cafe. We had covered more than 5 miles in 3 hours and it could still be considered “breakfast”. Here’s a breakdown of the credit card statement generated during our hour there:

Muffins, coffees, hot chocolate, breakfast sandwiches, breakfast burritos, and sodas. Bathrooms and Wi-Fi to boot. It was glorious. 
I called a lady in Salisbury - the next town north and our mile 12 for the day - to see if she had room to fit us into her house. She charges $40 per person and I admit I was hoping for a “buy four get one free” deal or something. She tried to accommodate us but the price was $200. Salisbury is on a stretch of trail between shelters and devoid of “official” campsites. The next shelter after Salisbury was 4 miles and I was skeptical of our ability (or need) to make it that far.
Two-hundred dollars was too much. We all agreed on dinner in Salisbury and that we would talk out the evening possibilities then.
We left town before 11:00 heading north again, past the impressive waterfalls and accompanying power-generating infrastructure. Easy trails, high spirits, full bellies, and cold root beers made the next six miles roll. 
We met Coffeebean and Happy Feet at the road and walked the 0.6 into town with them. They aim to finish a thru hike they started in 2019. They’ve been on the trail about a month and have walked from Warwick. We’ve been a day or two behind them for two weeks.
We landed at LaBonne’s market and spent another $58.08 on chicken salad, fried chicken, Chex mix, chicken tenders, cracklin oat bran, sourdough bread, avocado-cucumber-tomato salad, Belgian waffle to go, and 5 drinks. We sat in the “hiker square” and partook. 
I fixed twin blisters on Grayson’s big toes. 
We all agreed we could do the last 4 miles. The first 1.5 out of town were smooth sailing past a cemetery and trough a remarkable hemlock forest. Then up 900 feet to Lion’s Head and down to the shelter. Grayson and I nearly walked by the side trail talking about friends back home. 
So we’re here tucked into the shelter with Hoosier waiting on the “occasional thunderstorms before midnight”. Grayson is reading The Hobbit, Baxter got a book from the free library in Salisbury, and Jasper is reading “Hell in the Pacific”. 
So early start, cool temps, rolling terrain, two food stops, and $9.32 per mile (spent on GOOD food) all just 2 days after a restful zero made for smiles at the shelter. 
I hiked this section of trail alone in April 2003. I have frustratingly not remembered anything we have walked past: Housatonic Valley Regional High School, Falls Village and it’s infrastructure, a beautiful cemetery, Lion’s Head… Nothing makes the light come on. I musta been thinking about some deep stuff.","Sharon Mountain Campsite

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653182,"We woke up slowly at the fogged-in Riga shelter looking forward to a short 10 mile day. We all needed to recover from yesterday’s trek and Grayson nor Joni slept well. (Trail Pro Tip: don’t encourage 11-year-olds to chug a 12oz A&W Root Beer one-third of the way into 16 miles)
Three tall peaks were in the profile: Bear Mountain, Mt Race, and then Mount Everett. We didn’t pay the profile much respect since hills haven’t really bothered us. These three hills ate us up. 
Bear Mountain was our first peak over 2000 feet. The ascent was vanilla. The descent would have been comical in its choice of line (rock clefts & ledges) if there hadn’t been 3 eager boys and 2 creaky adults on wet rock. It was steep and sharp. Lots of butt-scooting. We were all pretty exhausted (mentally) after the three-quarter mile descent. 
We met Rock Steady headed south on his 4th day hike in the last week. He’s been a recurring character. He’s a Computer Science teacher from Ohio who raised 2 boys on adventure. He’s hiked all the trail south of us in sections. He and his wife have been out exploring CT and MA. He’s been a neat guy to talk with. He’s a big swimming-hole guy and gave us the heads-up on Sages Ravine and it’s many swimming possibilities. 
Many folks, when they see a beautiful lake, river, pond, stream, or the like in the wilderness are content to look or maybe soak their feet. I feel like I haven’t truly experienced the thing until I’m submerged in it. Grayson has always been all about it and Baxter & Jasper have gotten in on the fun. We’ve swam the Merced, Chattooga, Firehole, and Madison Rivers and dunked in Iceberg, Josephine, and ShangriLa Lakes in Glacier NP. We swam in the headwaters of the Mississippi and have swam 4 of the 5 Great Lakes (why not Erie!?). We forded the Housatonic earlier this week. Lake Canopus was a highlight last week.
So when Rock Steady mention swimming holes, it was on. Twenty minutes later Grayson and I were thigh deep in a 5-foot hole in Sages Gulch giggling about how cold it was and daring each other to dunk first. Baxter came to the water’s edge and in one smooth motion - never breaking eye contact - walked right in to the deep part without hesitation! Grayson and I laughed and high-fived him. Jasper played it cool - he’s not really up for cold water - and asked from the riverbank about the temp, the depth - standard stuff. Then, without warning and to all’s amazement, leapt from the bank into the deep! We all went bonkers. For the win! It was great to wash off the salt, wring out shirts, and soak dirty socks. We were only 3 miles in at 12:00 (abysmal progress) but spent about an hour there. The rain chased us out and down the trail.
Next climb was Mt Race. Awesome, awesome views.  The horizon was 80 miles or more on a 180-degree unobstructed panorama. New Jersey nor New York had views like this one. Then down again.
The difficult part of today was the trail bed itself. The rock strata had been turned up on its side creating “fins” of rock that the trail followed. Feet today were never heel-to-toe in the step. Always rolling, rocking, sliding, slipping. Yesterday’s mileage plus today’s profile was manageable but the trail conditions made a brutal difference. It was the longest 10 miles we’ve covered so far. (Veteran thru-hikers nod in Pennsylvani-ish)  
Mt Everett was last. They opted for wooden 8x8s fastened to the rock for stairways. Sheesh. It was a backslash on the profile map.  Like this: /.  Down a mile to camp. We’re in a Hemlock forest tonight which means no caterpillars. It was becoming psychological warfare. Rehydrated caterpillar poop pellets are…nevermind.
Tonight’s temps will get into the high forties. That’s good sleeping!
We crossed into Massachusetts today! Goodbye Connecticut! Goodbye to the Housatonic “Beyond the Mountains”. Goodbye to friends in Milford. Goodbye to overpriced-yet-convenient-and-quaint mountain towns (looking at you Kent). We  heard Veery and Ovenbird here. The Barred Owl guards the night and the Great Blue Heron is the river sentry of the morning. Red Efts still color the trail.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653232,"I show you. We do it together. You show me. Last night was the coldest yet. It was certainly in the 50s and may have been cooler than that. I do not have a sleeping bag but have been sleeping in a down jacket and a bag liner. It’s been a good combo for the warm nights. Last night I borrowed some down jackets from the boys and stayed toasty. 
Early in the day we came to a rock face that overlooked a wide valley. Jasper asked “are we about to hike through that?”  We checked the map and he was right. We could see the whole day’s walk laid out before us - our path down the mountain, river and road crossings, and the return to higher ground across the valley. Great Barrington was in view to the northeast. 
We descended quickly to the valley floor and found where the mountain met the flat. It was nearly a crease. We crossed a gravel road and started down the trail on the other side and found a trail magic cooler! We enjoyed the treats and emptied trash. The cool temps, good sleep, cloudy skies, trail magic, and profile convinced us a good day was ahead. 
We stepped into several miles of hemlock forest. Hemlock is a beautiful tree. It lays down a carpet of fine needles and softens the step. The wind through its needles is a whisper instead of the rustle that an oak will give. It smells healthy. Caterpillars hate it. It’s feathery branch-ends start a fire more readily than anything else in the woods. They are so delicate that the heat from the match can dry them out when wet, starting a fire in a storm. This forest was a welcome contrast to the torturous trail from yesterday. 
Just before lunch we passed the site of the last battle of Shays Rebellion. The trail skits the battlefield. I won’t recount the particulars here but it made for a good history lesson.
We lunched in a mowed field. Our emptying food bags tell the time left to the next resupply like sand in an hourglass. 
Soon after lunch the land began to rise. We could look back to the south and see Mt Race and Mt Everett, could spot where on that ridge Glen Brook must be, and could even spy the morning’s rock face from where we previewed the day. It was a rare experience, especially in the late Spring, to be able to see the trail so clearly for miles ahead and behind. 
As we climbed towards camp we were all feeling strong. We started contemplating the possibility of hiking out to the road that evening. Karen and Neal Denowitz plan on meeting us tomorrow morning at the road and shuttling us 5 miles into Great Barrington. They have gear and food for us. We thought we could instead get a shuttle to free camping in town tonight. This means hamburgers and a full zero day tomorrow (instead of a nero). 
I started texting and calling shuttle drivers. Unsurprisingly, no one was keen on picking up 5 hikers ant 5:30 on Friday evening on short notice. Uber is “not yet available in my area.” So we settled for the shelter site, Mexican Rice & tuna, and another night on the trail. Disappointment was felt on varying degrees. There is a large group of camp counselors here on a training trip. They are having authentic stir-fry for dinner. Skillet, rice pot, fresh veggies, soy sauce - they don’t know what they’re doing to the 10 thru hikers here and none of us are talking about it.
The rain is starting. I’m tenting with Baxter and Grayson tonight. The strong wind and cloud cover today ensure a chilly night tonight.

He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower, there is no more; in the leafless root, there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. There is no time to it. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.-Ralph Waldo EmersonWe were met at the road today by Karen and Neil Denowitz, friends first of Joni’s parents and now friends of ours, too! They live in nearby Granby and we’ve been planning on meeting up with them for a month or more. They had a food resupply along with some gear we’ve ordered and had sent to them. I am especially excited about Joni’s new sleeping pad! I would write an ode to my Ridge Rest foam pad if I were a poet. It came through in a pinch and I was learning to sleep well on it. I will not, however, miss it. Neil had leveraged his REI discount to get us some last minute necessities including fuel and sock liners. Clutch move.Neil shuttled us to the community center in two trips. Karen & Neil had brought along a great lunch - deli sandwiches (with lettuce & tomato), grapes, chips, prime watermelon, and quality lemonade. We sheltered from the cutting wind inside the community center and enjoyed the lunch and the company backed by the blaring soundtrack of the nearby aerobics class. I didn’t realize how loud it really was until they turned it off. We walked to the Travel Lodge next door and our room was ready several hours early. In no time there was gear all over every flat surface. Chores beckoned: laundry, showers, shopping, gear repair, dishwashing, water filter cleaning, and more. The proximity of a Price Chopper, Dollar General, and several restaurants made today easy to do on foot. Before leaving, the Denowitz’s drove me several miles south to the CVS. I improved my foot-care resources and we stopped for coffee on the way back. Karen snuck in a box of muffins and brownies that the boys quickly dispatched soon after our return to the motel. We said goodbye around noon. They were genuinely excited to help us and spend time with us to make sure we were squared away. So many people have sent texts, called, commented on posts, or even sent us some food money. We feel very blessed and encouraged to have a crowd cheering us on!As a school teacher, I have always felt fortunate to have what amounts to a yearly, 2-month sabbatical from work. It is refreshing and restful. Life is frenetic, often because we make it so. Twenty days on trail is still only the beginning- we’re shooting to finish in 170 - but it has taken us off the calendars, the timelines, the schedules, the checklists, and the like in a way I hadn’t anticipated. It’s turning into a deep sabbatical for all 5 of us. Many folks think backpacking is a fool’s sport. There are so many things not to like about it. But I understand a new allure backpacking brings when outside on a timescale of months. There isn’t much in the past to worry about. There isn’t much to do about the future, not in the sense that it is inevitable, but rather in the sense that it doesn’t really need to be changed much. Is everyone healthy? happy? is there food in our bags? water in our bottles? Yes! Then let’s walk and talk and listen to nature’s soundtrack. There is much to be heard. It is truly restful.We were walking the road back to the trail from Bulls Bridge Country Store last week. We had the “road sandwich” formation going (adult, kid, kid, kid, adult) in the left lane with Joni in the back. A lady driving a high-end SUV had pulled up in the right lane, matched Joni’s pace, and rolled her window down, slowing the cars behind her. “Is this your family!?” she asked excitedly  ”Yes.”“How long are you out for?”“Six months.”“SIX MONTHS!?! That’s all the stuff you need for SIX MONTHS?!?” pointing at our packs. “That’s all of it”, Joni nodded.Indeed.","Tom Leonard Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653387,"I had my best night of sleep yet at the Travel Lodge. I woke up first around 5:30 and laid in the soft bed for about an hour until Baxter woke up. Everyone else began stirring soon after. 
Papa Joe - shuttle driver - was due to meet us at 9:00 in the parking lot. We knew 9 would come quickly. I snuck out of the room and walked to the McDonalds for biscuits and coffee. I brought 8 biscuits back. Before they were done I knew we’d need more so I went back for 2 more. 
We had packed up the previous evening so our biggest task was moving out. As we transported stuff to the picnic table and gathered trash I reworked Grayson’s toe blisters. Neil had brought both Grayson and me sock liners. Rest plus liners plus foot care made for good walking today. 
Joe arrived at 9 and we piled into his Ford Explorer. He collected some information from us and put it in his notebook. He lives in Great Barrington and spends much of his time bringing hikers to and from the trail. The town is close to the trail - only 5 miles - so it’s a short shuttle. We were at the trailhead in no time. 
We disembarked and lines all our stuff up at the kiosk. I shook Joes hand and handed over the $50. He held up a had and said “Keep it. I’ve had some generous hikers lately. Happy Father’s Day. Buy the boys something special.” What a generous blessing. We all thanked him two times and again. 
I talked it through with the boys as we walked away. Back at the Travel Lodge, as we were shouldering packs to take them to the Explorer, I said to them “shake his hand and introduce yourself”.  On the short car ride they were all a part of the conversation and answered his questions thoughtfully. I told them, as we hit the trail, that I don’t know if Joe took notice of those little things but they sure go a long way towards being winsome. Being a blessing to others prompts them to want to do the same for you. Thank you Papa Joe!


Grayson and I, hiking in the back, misunderstood the plan for lunch today. The other three stopped at Wilcox Mountain South Shelter. We, instead, pressed on another 1.8 miles to Wilcox Mountain North Shelter before realizing our mistake. My phone had been on airplane mode and so I had missed Joni’s texts. Grayson and I were blissfully ignorant but the kerfluffle did cause some angst for Joni, Jasper, and Baxter. Another lesson learned. 


We got to Shaker campsite and walked into a packed site. The camp counselor group from 2 nights ago was here along with a couple and group of 3 siblings. We made 5 more. It’s turned into a great night. 

We plan to get out early in the morning and head to Upper Goose Pond Cabin. We hear there is swimming and morning pancakes.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653388,"It’s early evening and we are relaxing at Upper Goose Pond Cabin. UGPC is a two-story, wood and stone building with 14 bunks upstairs and a sitting room, kitchen, and large front porch downstairs. There is no power or running water. Tenting spots surround the cabin for those who prefer to tent or for overflow. 
We were the first to arrive here today about 1:00. We hiked the 9.5 miles from Shaker Campsites stopping only once about 9:00 at a roadside shed-market for hikers. Inside the small shed was a fridge stocked full of drinks and freezer full of ice cream. The shelves in the shed held all the hiker vices. Prices were posted and a cash box was nailed to the wall. We spent about $10 on ice cream sandwiches and sodas and enjoyed three at the picnic table. Then hiked on. 
Rain threatened at noon. We hoped to make it to the cabin before getting wet but the distance was too far. We hiked through lunch listening to the rain in the tree canopy, never really getting wet. 
Eating was on everyone’s mind followed closely by swimming (despite the breeze and drizzle). We learned at our “orientation” that canoes were available. We enjoyed a late lunch with Stomps, a NOBO from Jackson MS, and headed to the boat dock. 

Joni and I took a turn, too, navigating the narrow waterway separating Upper Goose Pond from Goose Pond proper. Goose Pond has some swanky real estate surrounding it - more like Lake Lanier without the pontoon boats.
It will be an afternoon remembered for a long time. 
Grayson and I took our turns swimming. The water was not as cold as Sages Ravine but the breeze was chilly! A regular dip in clean water goes a long way towards keeping the stinky-hiker smell away.

Joni injured her left leg low in her shin yesterday, probably due (in part) to the weight in her pack we picked up in Great Barrington. She made it through today and we are thankful for the long rest we can get here. We’re rubbing it down with Biofreeze gel and popping ibuprofen. If it’s shin splints then the only remedy is layer weight and lower miles. Tomorrow’s profile is friendly and the weather will again be cool. 
The caretaker here at the cabin starts cooking pancakes and pouring coffee at 6:00. We’ll be at the table, forks in hand. We hope to pull out before seven and take advantage of full bellies, early start, good terrain, and cool weather.

We awoke with the rustling of other hikers in the bunk room at UGPC about 5:45 this morning. The room proved to be dark and remarkably quiet throughout the night. We all got an excellent night’s sleep. I was downstairs at about 6:05 in time to see Baxter forking over two of the first pancakes onto his plate. The caretaker spent the next hour-and-a-half at the griddle cranking them out 6 at a time. It took 8 kettles of coffee before, at last, one sat only half-emptied on the table. It was a hungry crowd and large to boot. 
We spent time after breakfast reallocating gear in an effort to get weight from Joni’s pack. We were able to get her load below 20 pounds without burdening Baxter or Jasper too much.

>span class=""s1"">Today was predominately rain, moderate at times but never steady. The canopy does much to even out the “flow” of rain to the trail below so that the heavier rain is heard but not immediately felt. The trade off is that water is dripping all day - even when none is falling high above. 
We all hiked with pack covers but rarely wore rain gear. Once the engine gets running the internal heat doesn’t mind the rain. Stopping is when the cold catches up. It creeps into the family quickly, lightweights first. Body mass makes a big difference in heat retention. The boys get cold quickly after stopping in these circumstances. I’ve learned to bear with the on-again off-again nature of the mid layer or rain jacket. I can set out from a shelter in the cold rain in only a tee shirt knowing I’ll be heated up in only several hundred yards. The boys wear a layer out and then, in about that same distance need to stop to take it off. We get along down the trail just fine like this. 
I’ve written out a 10-day plan for our goal of 300 miles in June. AWOLs guide has no mention of camping in this stretch of trail we’re in. I wrote “STEALTH” on the plan sheet. “Stealth camping” is hiker speak for camping in a non-designated site. It can mean an unofficial spot on the trail previously used buy hikers, a place in the woods away from the trail, or sometimes a concealed spot behind the local Circle K convenience store. We don’t mind stealthing if needed - I actually prefer it. 
We started hearing rumors 2 or 3 days ago of “cookie lady” at mile 1563. This is the same mile I had written the “stealth” note on the plan. We got to the rumored road crossing today after lunch and there was indeed a sign - in the style of the roadside boiled-peanuts stand - with an image of a cookie next to the women’s-restroom-figure cutout. Then an arrow. We followed the road for 100 yards and met Ruth: Fourth-grade teacher, berry farmer, mother of 3, road tipper (in a converted mini bus)! 
Ruth served up cookies and hibiscus lemonade. We stood outside talking in the rain like it was all normal. She paid it no mind. I didn’t realize it was raining on us until later. 
She asked if we were looking to stay the night (it was only 3:00). We said we’d love to. “The bus won’t fit all of you but I can show you the hangar.” “Okay!”
She bought the property from a Mr Wiley who built his own grass landing strip and hangar here. The strip is being overtaken by the weeds and the hangar has no airplane in it but it makes a palatial hiker shelter for 5! So we’re bedded down on sleeping mats in a giant 50-foot-on-a-side room. No rain on us!
“NOBO” and “SOBO” are hiker lingo for “northbound” and “southbound”. I’ve only recently realized their phonetic and cultural proximity to “hobo”.  We’ve spent the last 5 nights in tent, hotel, tent, cabin, hangar. Do hobos live any differently? I’m digging it.


Dalton MA or lunch tomorrow. Ten mile before noon? We’ll see.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653520,"We woke in an airplane hangar this morning. It was perhaps the coldest morning of our hike. I was glad to be out of the wind. We all slept warm and soundly despite the strange sounds made by a sheet-metal building in the wind at night. 
I had hoped to catch cookie lady this morning as we left and ask if anyone in her house was willing and able to slackpack us to Dalton today. Crystal Campsite (13 miles) was our ultimate destination but I knew Joni’s leg would be helped along without weight and the logistics of slackpacking us seemed pretty straightforward. 
So I was mentally rehearsing my spiel as I walked from the hangar to the porch of the house. We were met by a hiker-looking guy, conspicuous because of his flannel shirt (not “hiker garb”). I introduced myself and he told us he was Baked Potato. He thru hiked last year and was back this year for trail magic. He was crawling north with the tip of the bubble hopping to road crossings in his Honda Fit. “Is there a way I can help you guys out?”, he asked. 
“Funny you should ask…”
Soon after we were loading $5000 of gear and personal effects into a complete strangers car. We traded phone numbers, arranged a meeting spot (Angelina’s Sun Shop), and waved goodbye. Surreal. I joked with the boys yesterday that the rules of the trail are a little different: When a strange lady offers you cookies if you’ll sleep in her blue bus you say…? That’s right! You say “yes!”
So we shouldered our daypacks with water, snacks, first aid, and TP and set off for Dalton - 10 miles before 1:00. 
Joni’s leg, despite improving yesterday, did not cooperate today. In the last mile before town we decided we’d stay the night in Dalton instead of pushing on to Crystal Campsite. Today’s short day plus the zero we will take tomorrow will put our 300-miles-in-June goal out of reach. Pushing ahead, on the other hand, is foolish and irresponsible. 
Tom Levardi is a legendary AT Trail Angel. The sidewalk in front of his house is the footbed of the AT. “I’ve been doing this for 43 years” he told me. “I was out for a day hike in 1979 and a hiker asked where he could stay in town. He didn’t have money for the motel. I gave him directions to my backyard and told him he could tent here. I’ve been helping hikers ever since.”
We’re in that same backyard now. Our two tents bring the total to 13. It’s not a big yard. “It’s a pretty normal Thursday in June” he tells me. 
As the boys and I sat at the picnic table in the shade of an oak tree, Tom chatted us up. The boys are interesting to people and they’re willing to talk. “Are you guys up for some ice cream?” Sure thing! He went inside. We were expecting icy pops or fudge bars. Tom walks out the door 10 minutes later with 3 ice cream bowls and a diner-style glass, all with decked-out strawberry ice cream sundaes! Each topped with whipped cream and a strawberry, they were a surprise on top of a surprise! What a guy - legendary. 
We’ve been hiking along with the Mass Walking Tour traveling band for the last week or so. They hike from town to town and perform concerts. Dalton was on their calendar tonight. I walked about a mile into town with the boys for the 6:00 show. We stayed for an hour before slipping out the back. We saw some trail friends and learned what a hammer-dulcimer was. It was a fun show but not exactly exciting for young boys. Also there was a lot of talking about green space, land trusts, “visions”, and “master plans.” Meh. The boys enjoyed it enough. “Better than laying around in the tent,” they said. It rained for our whole walk there and most of the way back. No one was bothered.
We ate at Angelina’s Sub Shop for lunch after meeting BP there. Great sandwiches. 
We somehow missed the State Lacrosse Champions parade through downtown. It was just behind us as we walked to the concert. Joni texted and asked if we had seen it. No. We did see candy on the sidewalk on our way back - a sure sign of recent parading. 
Joni spent much of today after we arrived not walking. Baked Potato did give her a ride to Dicks Sporting Goods to get compression socks and KT Tape. She walked with us on our way the the concert and stopped at the Cumberland Market convenience store to get some dinner - she skipped the concert. We’ll update the plan tomorrow. Hotel? More camping in Tom’s yard? We’ll see. 
I don’t want to forget the train. Grayson and I were lagging coming in to town. A train horn sounded very near just at the bottom of the hill. We jogged about 200 yards to see it. Standing next to a moving train is unnerving and exhilarating. We both had to look away to suppress a feeling of vertigo. Jasper and Baxter were on the other side of the tracks and had similar sensations. What a huge and powerful force! The train was maybe 100 cars long. After it passed we put our ears to the rails and listened to it grind away for a long after the sound was imperceptible to a passerby.
I have a favorite web comic that claims a train is just a machine that grabs the earth by a set of rails and turns the globe beneath it until the desired location is nearby. Maybe  hiking the AT is a similar phenomenon. Each step pushes the globe a little bit beneath us, pulling Katahdin a little closer bit-by-bit. 
It seems like an awfully big globe tonight.","Cookie Lady

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653570,"With much help from Tom, we did all the zero day things today: showers at the community center, laundromat, grocery, and WalMart. We walked to Juice n Java for an afternoon diversion. Joni spent most of the day off her leg. We iced, taped, Tiger Balmed, and got good advice from friends back home. We’re going to try another 10 mile stretch tomorrow with some slackpack help from Baked Potato again. On the way to the grocery Tom asked what I needed there. “Lunch and dinner for today and one dinner for the trail” I answered. “Do you guys do pasta?”, he asked. “Let me fix you dinner tonight.”So we had a grand meal with pasta, chicken & veggies, sausages and pork chops, with bread and butter. Incredible. Half the fun was inviting other hikers walking by to sit and eat with us.The tents in the yard did a full turnover today. Sucre - a guy who’s been here since day-before-yesterday - is the only person in addition to us who has stayed. There are about 10 tents here tonight. We got some good advice from Tom about the towns ahead, the resupply options, and meeting southbounders. He says not to talk to the SOBOs we see on the trail since every NOBO wants to stop and chat. They are our best source of info about the trail ahead (and we, theirs). But SOBOs get held up all day by the overwhelming number of NOBOs that want to chat. I hadn’t thought of this before. Talk to other hikers in camp at night. That way everyone can keep moving. We’re all looking forward to tomorrow. Being in e trail seems right. Here’s hoping Joni’s leg gets what it needs. We’re willing to stop again in Cheshire if needed.","Tom Lavardi

We are laying in tents next to ten-or-so other hikers listening to this song playing through the stereo at the yard party across the street. The volume dial goes to eleven. It’s 9:02, uncomfortably past thru hiker bedtime. I made a pact with Shweaty, Stealth, and Jolly Lobster that we’d go over at 10:30 and break up the party unless the beer was good. So we’re waiting it out. We made plans with Tom this morning to slackpack Joni to Cheshire, about 10 miles north on the trail. We broke camp and we’re ready to roll about 7:30. We said our goodbyes to the regulars at Tom’s house. Joni and I thanked Tom. I offered him $100 for the camping, ice cream, shuttles, dinner, two breakfasts, and the shared trail wisdom. He snorted and shook his head.  “I don’t do it that way.” Joni started crying. He started crying and gathered us both in a hug. “It all works out.”
As we left Dalton the five of us talked through what had happened. Tom had done everything we needed, including some things we didn’t know we needed, along with some things thrown in for fun. He did it for no other reason than we needed it and he could do it for us. We are helpless to repay him. We are not special to him - we’re only 5 hikers he’s seen in 43 years - but, at the same time, he made sure we knew we were very special to him, even if only for a little more than a day. It was an awesome picture of selflessness. It makes us want to go and do the same. 
We saw Tom again at the end of our hike when he drove to Cheshire (after we called) and delivered our gear. What a saint. We thanked him again and said goodbye.
Joni’s leg is feeling better, even after our hike today. To rest? To zero? To push on? To slackpack? For how long? Whose advice is best? These are questions that we ask 5 times per minute. We are emotionally invested. We have a goal and we’re not moving fast enough to make that goal. What to do? 
Then, when other hikers weigh in with their advice - their emotionally detached advice - it has always been to slow down. To stop. To listen to your body. Does it need to stop? Then you stop. Easy. 
Shepherd told us at dinner last night that the first 3rd of the trail is physical. All the people around us were here, not because they haven't had problems but because they did what needed to be done to take care of it. “There are many hikers” he said “that started with us but aren’t here with us now because they didn’t do what was needed to take care of their bodies.” Having seasoned hikers around who have, at this point, put in 1500 miles, is a big help. Mentors on all sides. Mentors are best when they can think through your problem without emotion. 
Housic River runs clear and cold behind the campsite. We set up tents and went straight into the water. “River” is a generous name but it was plenty deep to submerge and wash off the day. Then across the street to Diane’s Twist for ice cream. Grayson and I took two loaner bikes and rode around town, then down the rails-to-trails trail to Cheshire Reservoir. Tuna Mac and Cheese failed for dinner so we went in with Spotter and ordered pizza delivered. We got a large for the 5 of us. She got a large for herself (she’s little). Stealth was eating a half-gallon of ice cream. <<heavy Quebec City (French) accent>> “It’s not a challenge anymore. It’s 2500 calories with good fat. I do it every time I go into town.”
Played Pokémon. Talked gear with the crowd. Answered hiking-with-five-people questions (“It’s hard enough planning for one!”). Read some books. Now trying to go to sleep.
Tomorrow we’ll split gear and effectively slackpack Joni across Mt Greylock. Shelter tomorrow night. Nero next day into Williamston. Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?And if you doWell then don't be afraid to take me by the handIf you want toI think this is how love goes, check yes or noCheck yes or noCheck yes or noCheck yes or noCheck yes or no","Tom Lavardi 
",Father Tom Campsite - Cheshire MA,"Jun 25, Sat",8.90
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653730,"Last Night:
I finished my journal entry with the music still blaring. The mumble rap started at 10 and I decided I couldn’t listen any longer. I got out of the tent and walked up the street. A dozen guys around a bonfire 20 yards from the speaker greeted me. “It’s ten-o-clock already!? We’d have turned it down earlier had we known.”
Whatever
We rolled out of camp around 8:00. It was to be a hot day - high eighties - and the climb ahead was the longest since we started. Mount Greylock is the highest point in Massachusetts. We had first spotted it on Mt Race 6 or 7 days ago. We got a good look at it from The Cobbles and could make a good guess at the line we would take tot the summit. It was a high peak but the boys didn’t seem to give it much count. We’ve climbed worse. 
Joni had a light pack and we rolled slowly. We had three options for stopping today: Mark Nopel shelter south of the summit, Bascom Lodge at the summit, and Wilbur’s Clearing shelter afterwards. We had decided to take a break at each spot, evaluate, and make a call about hiking on. 
The first part of the climb went well. We arrived a Mark Nopel in high spirits and feeling strong. Filled water bottles and continued up after about 15 minutes of break. 
Several times today (three?) we were stopped by the sound “cheeping”. The first time I heard it I knew it was birds. I stopped to see if I could spy the cheaper. A sapsucker flew to its hole in the tree and stuck it’s head in. The volume doubled. She flew off again and the noise subsided. I watched for many cycles of this. She was spending a lot of energy and giving it away. How many calories are in a bug?
At the second nest I stopped Joni to show her. As she was filming a male flew onto a nearby branch and loudly protested our presence. He resorted to dive bombing when his call went unheeded. We moved along. 
The summit push was steep but we knew we were close by the appearance of fresh-looking day hikers. We made it to the Bascom Lodge and threw down packs in the sunny grass. It was about 1:00. We had come 7 miles. We decided to take a long rest until 4:00. 
Inside was a lunch counter with light snacks and cold drinks. We put our squeeze peanut butter and ritz together with some beef jerky, blueberry torte, and cold cokes and had a great lunch inside sitting by a window with views of our gear. 
The summit was a meeting pit of day hikers, second-home-owner weekenders, and fellow thru hikers. We are an object of curiosity to all types and Baxter is our de facto PR man. He’ll strike up a conversation with anyone. We met several new thru hikers and a family (mom, dad, 2 sons, grandfather, aunt) fascinated with the thought that we were doing this for 6 months. They had so many questions. Their boys weren’t having any of it.
We sat with Sandals inside who we had met on Tom Lavardi’s porch two nights ago. I nearly followed him into town on his way to the pub then (it was 8:00, too close to bedtime). He was an interesting guy with a neat story, interested in ours. I hope we meet again. 
Joni was able to ice her leg. The boys climbed the war memorial on top for some great views of the surrounding states. The day was hit a so the horizon was hazy about 50 miles out. We could see dimly to perhaps 80. We were able to trace our path back to The Cobbles, Dalton, Great Barrington area, and Mounts Everett and Race. Solitary Mount Monadnock was far to the east - close to 60 miles. It is not on the AT but is a huge hill standing alone, not unlike Katahdin or Moosilauke. 
We prepared to leave the summit and hike the 4 miles to Wilbur’s Clearing. The downhill to that point would be steep and then become fairly extreme afterwards for the three miles into Williamstown & North Adams. Downhills are the worst for Joni’s leg. We set off slowly with plenty of time to make the shelter before night.
It was a tough 4 miles for her. We did get to the shelter and it was empty. We were a little uneasy hiking in so late to a shelter in an evening with rain in the forecast. Shelters can fill quickly in those circumstances. We spread our ground cloths inside to claim our spots. And prepared to bed down for the night. Mountain House for dinner. Tyler (thru hiker) showed up and climbed in with us. 
I had no service at the shelter so Grayson and I hiked about half-a-mile up the hill to get a signal. I arranged a shuttle to the nearby road crossing for the morning so Joni could avoid the steepest downhill. We got a room at The Willows Motel for tomorrow night. I think we’ll stay in Williamston for several days and give Joni’s leg a fair chance to heal. 
Grayson and I discovered new trail in the way back to the shelter. It looks like a short reroute to descend the hill (Mt Prospect) on a switchback. It was neat walking this flagged and benched rough draft of trail. It dumped us back out on the AT proper.
The wind is picking up. We’re tucked into the shelter along with a Winter Wren who’s made her nest in the beams. I learned this bird’s evening song today soon after spotting it. It is fantastically complex and beautiful. Maybe we’ll get a morning serenade (though she looks as if she’d rather we left now).","Father Tom Campsite - Cheshire MA

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653747,"I did not rain last night. It waited until about 8:30 am and rained until just after we got picked up by the shuttle. It is nice to be sitting in a shelter, warm and dry, while it pours rain outside. I had arranged for the shuttle to pick us up on Notch Road towards Greylock’s summit where the AT makes it’s last northbound crossing. The 3 trail miles to the highway in Williamstown proper were very steep downhill - not good for Joni’s leg. Shuttle guy (the Willows Motel proprietor) agreed pickup would be beteeen 10:30 & 11:00. We arrived at the road in a driving rain at 10:15. Joni and the boys sheltered under a kiosk 500 feet up the road. I stood at the crossing (where there was cell service) and waited. We kept waiting. I called at 11:00. Drama ensued - he did not know how to find us. We finally loaded up in his car at noon, all of us cold & wet & too tired to really be frustrated. A body trying to stay warm burns a lot of energy.We got to our room a bit after lunch. Boys crawled under sheets (before showering- gross) and the sun promptly came out. I was proud of their resolve in the rain and cold. No one’s spirit broke. All we’re patient. I like to imagine “comfort” is a region on the slider of bodily and mental sensation. Each time we’ve headed out in a road-trip or a walk in the backcountry each person’s “comfort boundaries” quickly become obvious. Those boundaries are tested in the outdoors. The boys have gotten good at moving the low boundary lower when we’re outside. Proper gear helps but winning the mental game is something that can only be done inside. I walked to Subway and Dollar General for lunch about 1:30. The Phineas & Ferb marathon began as I left. Showers, laundry, and gear-drying began. Grayson, Baxter, & I went for a swim at the pool. Will Smith is the guy who helps with housekeeping here. “The pool is perfect!”, he told me. “I’m a CPO.”“Chief Pool Officer?” I asked.“No. Certified Pool Operator.” Who knew?We hit up Subway again for dinner - fresh veggies and leavened bread are divine - and raided the Cumberland Market for cold drinks. I didn’t realize how thirsty I was until Jasper put a cold vitamin water on the counter at Subway. It’s strange how the mind can identify what body needs when it sees the thing - sugar, salt, butter, water, fruit. The mind doesn’t see the Coke, it sees the sugar; not a Ritz cracker, but the salt; not peanuts, but the fat.Jasper discovered the game Polytopia in the App Store. Command & Conquer meets Civilization. It’s a multiplayer pass-and-play game we’ve been playing more than necessary. We’re here at the Willows for at least two nights. We’ll likely stay in Williamstown or nearby North Adams for 4 nights. I just got a text from Lightyear who’s near Rutland (about 100 miles north), asking how we were doing. He heard about the shin splints. They just took 3 zeros for his tendinitis. That makes us feel better about taking 4.","Wilbur’s Clearing Shelter

I read these paragraphs this evening. I’ll be working on them in my mind as we walk again. These paragraphs speak a lot of truth about why we’re living this adventure now. I’m a creature of habit to a fault: still living where I grew up, taught at the same school for 20 years, dabbler in many hobbies but master of none. I’m as comfortable in my skin as my feet are in my leather moccasins - why mess with what’s working? I have a hard time imagining we’d be here on my gumption alone. Now that we are here, I feel in my element. Life is simple & straightforward. The choices are black & white with limited shades of gray. I’m thriving. Thanks for getting us here, Joni. 

Thanks, too, to Eric for some PT advice, to Peggy from Ohio (a mystery friend who called Joni today at the motel to share a shin solution from her own thru-hiking days), to Skogmoopers for prayers & encouragement, to Jordan, Susan, my own parents, my sister. All these people have acted today to affect our trip for the better. We continue to meet new friends daily.
We all slept last night like an old bear hibernates. The boys headed to continental breakfast at 7:30. While there wasn’t a make-your-own-waffle machine (we need this?) there was a fabulous breakfast of fresh fruit, muffins, and coffee. We all laid around reading & journaling until about 9:30.

The boys and I loaded up daypacks with the essentials - Pokémon, snacks, water bottles, current book - and headed west into Williamstown. First stop: Where’d You Get That toy store. We burned an hour there before quick. Then we walked Spring Street to the far end searching for lunch. 

Years ago we backpacked with our friends. Jennifer and her kids Daniel, Abigail, and Lydia did a stretch of trail with us just north of their home in Franklin NC. We played a round of “It’s your birthday. What’s for dinner.” A good get-to-know-you game made better by trail hunger. Toby couldn’t hike with us so we ask Jennifer what he would say. “Oh. That’s tough. He likes anything.” After a long thought she said “He’d probably choose Indian buffet.”
When we later put the question to Toby. his style and manner of reply were shockingly similar to Jennifer’s. He landed on “I’d probably have to say Indian buffet.” The room cheered. 

That moment has stuck with the boys for 4 years. Spice Root - Indian Cusine - was just across Spring Street from us. Mom was back at the hotel, we’re on budget, we have gads of time - so we went in. It was a fabulous lunch. Chicken Tikka Masala with lots of sides and that Naan bread. All on hungry stomachs. Delicious.
We next went to the campus bookstore and burned another hour reading books. Then to the game store - underwhelming. We headed back to the motel about 2:00. 

Grayson and I set out soon after for the Stop & Shop about a mile-and-a-half walk east. We were shopping for meals for the next two days as well as food for the 3 trail days in front of us. Jasper and Baxter started The Hobbit movie a bit after we left.
On our walk back from the Stop and Shop Grayson and I swung in to Walgreens for athletic tape (Peggy’s orders!). I had a full pack of groceries on with a daypack of drinks riding in my chest. We met some hikers in the parking lot headed in with us. “Is it weird to wear a full pack into the Walgreens?”, I asked as we walked in behind them. 

“That’s Jay” Grayson said. 

Jay is the star of “Jay Wanders Out” - his YouTube channel (updated daily) documenting his 2022 AT thru hike. Joni is an avid watcher and had been keeping tabs on Jay & his girlfriend, Pocket Rocket. Grayson recognized him right away so I went and asked “Are you Jay?” Sure enough. We’re hanging out tomorrow night. Good eye, Grayson.
We came back to the hotel and called my friend, Eric, a physical therapist back home. He gave us some food for thought about Joni’s injury. I went to Walgreens again and bought some Voltaren cream on his recommendation. 

We made sandwiches for dinner and watched some TV. Pepper into the day some book reading, calls to home, good conversations with friends, and showers and you get a pretty good zero. 

We’re moving motels tomorrow. We’re headed across the street. I had some free nights with travel points. The boys and I will go hike the three miles from Wilbur’s Clearing into town tomorrow afternoon. Joni’s going to sit them out.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653843,"Today was a true day of rest both mentally & physically. Joni’s leg is healing and we’ve run all the errands we need. 
We woke this morning after another great nights sleep and prepared to move hotels. The Willows was great but I was able to get 2 nights paid for with traveler points at a nearby motel. We packed our packs and made the move in a few trips. Checkout was at 11am and check in at the new place wasn’t until 2pm. 
We hauled all our gear into the backyard of our new motel and unpacked EVERYTHING into the grass. I was interested to reevaluate what everyone was carrying again and see if we could “bounce” some of our gear north. Lighter packs is the aim. We started a pile of bounce gear and collected almost 8 pounds of stuff to mail ahead. 
The biggest chunk of that weight is the three-man tent. At 4.25ish pounds, it is more than half of the pile by weight. We pitched the 4 man tent and all 5 of us crawled in to test the fit. By alternating heads and feet we were able to fit us all cozily. So we’re going to give it a try for the next week - send the three man ahead and sleep 5 in the four man tent. Shelters will help spread us out when possible.
We included some clothing, a pair of crocs, some first aid gear, and other minor miscellany. By managing our food in addition to the weight we’ve ditched I hope we can meaningfully reduce pack weight for everyone. 
Grayson, Baxter, & I snuck back over to the Willows after lunch for a swim at their pool. We weren’t sure whose idea it was but it was a good one. On our way back Mr Ding-A-Ling, ice cream truck, was parked in the Cumberland Market lot.  He had all the stuff we had on our truck. We all three got our favorites and walked on, eating as we went down the sidewalk.
Joni spent the afternoon reading, I was studying the AT through the White Mountains, the boys were watching Jurassic Park.
We joined Tina and Jay at the Mexican restaurant for dinner. Trail folks have really interesting stories and these two were no different. Living on the trail requires some non-traditional lifestyle choices: creative work scheduling, quitting jobs, selling stuff. Everyone has made some unique choices to be out here.
We’re back in the room, showered, brushed, combed, and dialing down. Shuttle driver Bill will meet us here in the morning at 9:00 to take us back to Notch Road. We’ll slackpack the three miles of trail back to town. Joni will sit those miles out. We plan on tomorrow being our last town night. We’ll head north again on Friday morning.","Williamstown

Today was another relaxing zero, with good food and lots of much-needed rest for Joni’s leg and a little bit of hiking. We woke up in the Williamstown Motel and had a good continental breakfast of honey buns, cereal, and toasted bagels, courtesy of the motel’s owner, Rocky. A guy named Bill came at 9:00 to pick us up and take us to Wilbur’s Clearing while Joni rested at the motel. We hiked 3 miles back into Williamstown via the AT and found some trail magic at a kiosk. We walked to the Stop & Shop to buy a lunch of fried chicken, more fried chicken, chips, salsa, cookies, and Body Armors, which we attempted to flip for about half an hour, successfully landing them on their caps a few times, too. 
We heard that the man attempting the fastest known time (FKT) for the AT would be  passing through shortly (or so we thought), and we waited for Kristian for 4 hours at a stoplight while climbing trees, eating a little more than our share of trail magic, and flipping bottles. When Kristian came by, we fist- bumped him, pushed the pedestrian traffic light cross button (“wait”), and watched him slow jog across the road. We walked 2 miles back to the motel, which had some really cool houses along the way, and got back around 5:00. We enjoyed a dinner of pizza from Doug Moore. Thank you Doug! We watched Phineas & Ferb until bedtime. This would be our last zero day before we hopped back on trail and continued our journey.

Joni got a great, one-hour massage while the boys & Darrell we’re waiting on Kristian.


As a result of our gear shakedown yesterday we were able to ship 10.1 pounds of gear ahead to the Bomoseen KOA in Rutland. The three man tent is most of that weight. Darrell’s Crocs are in the box. Several articles of clothing are included. 


We spent an hour or more in the evening repacking packs and divvying up food, making sure that most of the saved weight came out of Joni’s pack.","Williamstown

I just can’t wait to get on the road again. 
I find love is making music with my friends 
And I can’t wait to get on the road again. 
On the road again. 
Going places that I’ve never been. 
Seeing things that I may never see again. 
I can’t wait to get on the road again. 
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway 
We’re the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way. 
And our way is on the road again. 
We woke this morning to a small emergency. Joni’s cork massage ball was missing. No luck in the room or in packs. I walked back to the willows to ask of it had been found but the housekeeper would not be in until 11:00. Dollar General did not carry tennis balls. Walgreens was sold out but did have pre-cut tennis balls for the bottom of walker legs. I got them. Then left one in the room - no unnecessary weight. 
We load up Rocky’s van at about 9:00 and he drives us the 2 miles out to the trail. We unload, wave goodbye, cross the road (then a river, then railroad tracks, then another road) and are back in the woods. 
We planned a short day today (as well as the next several) in order to give Joni’s leg a chance to heal and strengthen. It still felt good after we finished our planned stretch and we briefly considered pushing on. We had several hours before dinner but elected to go easy and rest.
Grayson started a game where he builds a miniature model of the shelter area using twigs and leaves and such. Then he hides a peanut somewhere in the scene and places a second peanut in the corresponding location in the model. It’s my job to find the hidden peanut using the model as a clue. Pretty fun diversion. 
I taught Jasper solitaire. 

We filtered lots of water (the day was hotter than average). 
Ramen for dinner (add oil, tuna, crushed red pepper). 
We are four in the tent now as evening approaches. Jasper is reading outside. He’ll be in later. Then we get to see how this setup really works. 

It feels good to be back out in the woods. 


One month down. 


We crossed into Vermont today and started walking The Long Trail. The AT and The Long Trail are concurrent for 105+ miles. Then the AT turns east at Rutland while The Long Trail heads north to Canada. 


Goodbye to Massachusetts! We’ve spent a lot of time with you. Goodbye to Sages Ravine, to the Hoosic River at Father Tom’s Campsite, to The Willows pool. Goodbye Great Barrington, Dalton, Cheshire, Williamstown. Goodbye Race, Everett, Greylock. Goodbye Tom Lavardi, Cookie Lady, Papa Joe - and thank you.","Williamstown

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654108,"Our first night sleeping all of us in the 4-man tent gets mixed reviews. Kudos for even doing it at all (right?). Getting to sleep was challenging. Rain was forecasted for the night so we had the rain fly on and all zippers closed. It was pretty hot inside. I opened the tent I up about 9:00 and it cooled off enough to go to sleep. The rain began at 10:30. I zipped it all up again and the temperature dropped to “comfortable”. It rained constantly until we walked out of camp at about 9:00am. We were all dry and asleep at sunrise.
We were able to use the shelter this morning to pack up most of our gear dry. We had breakfast inside the shelter. Then we donned rain gear and walked into the rain. The sun got to work on the clouds and the rain let up within the first mile or two. By the  time we reached a power line right-of-way the wind had gotten up to clean the clouds out. The grassy right-of-way was on a ridge top and channeled the wind down the wide hallway of trees. Cloud wraiths rode the gusts quickly to the east as we sat resting and drying out.


Vermont is infamous for its mud. Heavy snow, later spring, and the shady canopy make it difficult for the trail to dry. For most of the miles today the understory was close-in over the trail: Wood Nettle, Hobble Bush, ferns, and young maple. It’s a perfect setup for mud. Trail maintainers have done a great job building boardwalks and setting stepping stones through the worst parts. We got through fairly unscathed.


We passed very close by two beaver dams today. What an incredible phenomenon! The trail in many places is a foot or two below the level of the pond and sometimes as close as arms-reach to the water behind. The tops of the earthen works curve and wind in the shallower parts, keeping a level top for hundreds of feet across the top of the dike. The front of these dams are steep, sometimes vertical, while there backs (underwater on the pond-side) are smooth, gently sloped mud.  Hornets nests are a marvel, ant hills are a wonder, even the sapsucker nests we’ve passed, bored high into the dead trunks of trees, are interesting to contemplate. But the beaver dam, it’s impounded waters, and the lodge-mound in the middle borders on unbelievable. Ostentatious even. Isn’t there an easier way?!
We’re working on a plan to modify the hike a bit. My parents are on the road now, pulling their camper north to meet us near Rutland, VT. They are going to play the role of “support team” for the month of July following us north in the camper as we hike. We carefully planned their stops earlier this year so they would be close to us on the trail. Our last 10 days have put us about 70 miles behind schedule. In order to use their help while they are in Vermont & New Hampshire, we want to skip north to trail that’s closer to them. Right now, we’re planning on Dad meeting us mid afternoon on Tuesday and taking us to Rutland for a zero on Wednesday. We’ll use that day to inventory gear and food (they have a lot of stuff for us). We’ll look over maps of the trail and the road crossings. We’ll study true Whites together. We’ll put a rough plan together for the coming weeks. Then, on Thursday, Dad will take us to Killington VT and we’ll start north from there. By the end of July, when they head back to Georgia, we’ll be through the Whites and almost 300 miles closer to Katahdin.Baxter and I are in the shelter tonight to make room in the tent. This shelter has no bear box so I threw a bear bag for the first time in two weeks. There are more than 20 people around the shelter tonight - some NOBOs, some section hikers, and some Long Trail hikers.
Naomi told us before we left that the trail was going to be one big obstacle course, some small, some big. What a great analogy! There is wisdom in that view: an obstacle course is designed for fun but it is also quite a challenge. We can look back and see several obstacles behind us, conquered. We can also see several big obstacles ahead, imposing. But there are also all those people on the sides cheering us on. The encouragement is awesome.","Seth Warner Shelter
",Congdon Shelter,"Jul 02, Sat",7.20
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654159,"We left Congdon after a questionable night’s sleep. Breakfast at the shelter again. We needed to go to Bennigton to resupply our food. Harmon Hill overlooks the city and is the last cell signal before the trail dives down to the road. I called a guy named Steve to see if he could come and get us. Joni found him on Far Out. He was happy to meet us at 11 at the road. 
We walked the 1.8 miles (the last very steeply downhill) and arrived exactly at 11:00. We watched Steve pull in to the lot as we were descending. 
Steve turned out to be a bona fide trail angel. He served up cold drinks right away from a cooler in the back. Then we headed to WalMart. We picked his brain a bit on the ride and decided we might try to make the 40 miles to Manchester Center before meeting my parents. So we resupplied for 4 days in WalMart and walked out with two boxes of food. Steve, who had waited on us, loaded us all back into the Subaru Outback and took us to Ramuntos - a pizza-and-burger restaurant with outdoor seating that’s close to downtown. We said we’d hang out until 5:00 and he was willing to come back then and return us to the trail. 
We ordered 4 cheeseburgers and an order of buffalo wings. The cheeseburgers were spectacular. The buffalo wings were mediocre. We enjoyed all of it.

After we finished eating we took all the food from the boxes and divvied it up into food bags. Smarter shopping kept the weight manageable even with Joni carrying only her snacks. 
We repacked everything and walked a block west to the game store where we set up for the next 3 hours. The boys played video games, Joni worked on video, I looked at maps. Bookstores, coffee shops, and other storefronts were nearby. We each spent some time walking the streets of Bennington taking in the town. I helped a guy carry a mini fridge to his upstairs apartment where he had a book & vinyl shop.
Steve was back at Ramuntos at 5. He drove us back out to the trail and wouldn’t even take gas money.


We hiked a steep uphill out of the gap. I left the gap feeling strong and gained the ridge feeling winded with two tweaked knees. We pulled into the shelter about 6:00. It was pretty full with tents set up all around. We walked south, retracing our steps, to a stealth site about a quarter mile from the shelter. 
We returned to the shelter to fix dinner and meet some fellow hikers.
We’d heard of a guy on trail hiking northbound who was from Dahlonega. We finally crossed paths with Tin Man. He graduated from LCHS last year and hit the trail in March. It was fun to meet (and hear!) someone from home. 
We all climbed into the tent (minus Tin Man) about dark. I’m sitting just outside now typing in the dark, listening to the night noises and far-off fireworks, an early July 4th celebration.","Congdon Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654348,"I’m a little behind on journal entries so I’m going to catch them all up here.
We woke up on July 4 at Melville Nauheim Shelter. We got an early start so we could give Joni a good, long rest at lunch. We arrived at Goddard Shelter at high noon after a steep climb up Glastonbury Mountain. It sleeps 12 with a porch and a good privy. We all spread out and kicked back for an hour and a half. Another 0.3 miles up the trail is an observation tower. We could spot Greylock to the south and Stratton off to the northeast.
We pressed on to Kid Gore Shelter and arrived about 4:00.
Just before I got there I passed a trail runner headed south. Jasper met me at the side trail and said that he was the guy attempting a southbound FKT. Jasper talked with him briefly and got a selfie with him. Cool!
Baxter and I shared a bunk in the shelter while G, J, and J slept nearby in the tent. 
Mom & Dad set up their camper in Rutland today. I talked with him in the phone at the shelter and we made a plan to meet in Manchester Center on Thursday (3 more days). We’d zero with them on Friday. 


We set out on July 5th with only a vague plan of what we’d do that night. Stratton Mountain summit was 10 miles away - a good length. Unfortunately, there is no designated camping on Stratton & rolling the dice in a stealth site didn’t seem wise to me. If we arrived and there were no sites (or none available), we’d be faced with 4 more miles, all downhill, to the next shelter. This wouldn’t fare well considering Joni’s leg. Downhill and tired are the worst. Rain was forecasted for the evening. If we stopped early after 8 miles, we’d save the hike over Stratton but we’d be tenting in a rain that started about 1:00. Setting up in rain and the FIVE of us crawling in for a 15-hour stretch didn’t seem “fun”.  So I texted with Dad and he agrees to come and meet us for pickup at 2:00 at Stratton-Arlington Road. 
He arrived about 35 minutes before we got there. He was greeted by each as they came out of the woods. It was fun to see him. He brought cold gatorades and chocolate. We piled gear in the back of e truck and all climbed in for the hour ride to their KOA campsite. 
We got to the campsite after 3:00. Showers, laundry, drying gear, flushing filters, emptying trash, and other zero-day miscellany ensued. They had also brought with them LOTS of gear, food, clothes, food, shoes, and food. We spent much of the afternoon sorting, taking inventory, and study the Delorme Road Atlas for Vermont & New Hampshire. We made a plan for the next several weeks. Here is the final word:
Dad will drop us off at Stratton Arlington on Thursday the 7th. We’ll hike <20 miles to Manchester Center where he’ll meet us to resupply. Then 4- or 5 days to Rutland (speed depending on Joni’s leg) with another resupply in the middle. He’ll meet us again in Rutland in the 12th and shuttle us 60 trail-miles north to Hanover, New Hampshire where we will begin to tackle the White Mountains with their help. The Whites are one of the most difficult parts of the trail. Exposure is the main challenge. The trail remains above tree line for thirty miles at a stretch. If the sun is out you get baked. If it’s not out then bad weather is probably moving in. Wind blowing at 20 or 30 miles an hour is common. Gusts of 50 are regular fare. Along with exposure, the terrain is a beast. Never flat, always climbing or descending, the trail picks it’s way through scree and boulder. The views are stunning and the alpine landscape unequaled on the east coast. Throw in a dearth of road crossings and you get a trekkers obstacle course. These factors slow experienced thru hikers to half-pace for daily miles. We are very thankful to have mom & dad’s help. Trailhead meals and resupplys can keep us moving in good weather instead of having to shuttle to town for food and fuel. We can also “customize” or loads a bit to cut weight. We can leave things like camp shoes, extra clothes, and charging blocks at the truck if they won’t be needed for the next stretch. There are even some possibilities for slackpacking. 
We’ll hike from Hanover north to Katahdin (still a 500 mile walk). Then return to Rutland and complete the 60 miles to Hanover. Then back to High Point SP for the southbound leg. Confused? Sorry. It’s messy but it counts!
Spaghetti and Garlic Toast for dinner. Then Joni and I pitched our 3-man tent (that arrived UPS from Williamstown at 4:00) and crawled in. The boys slept in the camper with mom and dad. 


A whole POT of coffee greeted us on Wednesday the 6th. Joni and I left in the truck at 8:00 and headed into Rutland to find an urgent care. They xrayed Joni’s leg and could see no signs of a stress fracture. The doctor concurred with other folks we’ve talked with that it’s either shin splints, tendinitis, or muscle strain. The cure: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevaton. This isn’t new news. Bummer is we can’t really do the first two on the list and make progress. 
We made a grocery run at Hannafords. Aisle numbers in northern grocery stores start on the left and go to the right. Produce and deli on the left side of the store, milk and ice cream on the right. This is not correct. Ritz crackers are in an approximately normal location but you’re 12 aisles away from bread before you realize it’s on the other (wrong) end of the store!
Back at camp we laid out 3 day’s worth of food and showed Dad what a resupply looked like. We packed food bags and two resupply boxes for this week. We created a resupply bin for gear and clothes that would come to every trailhead with him. Then we shared Google Map pins and marked up the road atlas with trail/road crossings of interest. 
Dinner was pot roast and cold drinks. More showers. Tetherball. 
Joni and I crawled into the tent about 9:00. The neighbors were noisy - a feature of hard-sided camper sections of KOAs. So I did some nighttime investigation and found an empty tent loop 100 yards from our tent. We picked up everything and moved. We stealth camped in the KOA. Darker than the inside of a cow. Quieter than the middle of a mattress pile.","Stratton Arlington Road

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654350,"We passed the 300 mile mark today. Back on June 20 we had a plan to make 300 miles before the end of that month. We were still hopeful that could happen as late as the 25th. Today is July 7 - 12 days later - and we have finally realized that goal. It has been a short season of patience, frustration, speculation, and uncertainty. The list of treatments we’ve done to Joni’s leg is long but it’s making progress towards healing.Josh Bennett - college roommate, family friend, 1996 thru hiker - drove from his home in upstate Mew York to hike with us for 2 days. We left the KOA at 8:00am loaded for bear after a killer breakfast of eggs, bacon, pancakes. We drove about an hour to the Green Mountain Hiker Hostel and met Josh. He and I got in the bed of the truck (still legal in Vermont) and rode another 40 minutes back to the trail. We set out to cross Stratton Mountain and stay the night at the fairly massive Stratton Pond Shelter. Josh brought a goody bag of food that he treated us with at meal times and snack times (ting-a-ling): bagels & pepperjack, movie theater popcorn, fruit by the foot, brownies, marshmallows, stroopwaffles. He marveled at the lightweight gear, the connectivity, the clothes people wore while hiking, the small size of the packs. He regaled the dozen other hikers in the shelter with trail stories from a different era. He was like a time traveler. We dunked in Stratton Pond. It’s a beautiful pond reminiscent of Upper Goose Pond but twice the size. We came back for the sunset, our best yet on the trail. Josh, Baxter, and Jasper slept in the shelter while Joni, Grayson, and I squeezed into the 3 man tent. Joni is carrying the bare minimum now: snacks, water, and her pack. Her leg is on the mend. We feel encouraged.","Stratton Arlington Road
",Stratton Pond Shelter,"Jul 07, Thu",7
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654444,"We made the largest batch of coffee yet this morning. Josh, Joni, Darrell, & Baxter partook. As we were rolling onto the trail at about 8:15 we spied Porky’s fanny pack loaded with his snacks hanging in a peg. He had left about 5 minutes before. Baxter took the pack and ran it down the trail to him. Porky had turned around and was headed back and was grateful for the effort!
We passed Stratton Pond and started down a 6-mile tabletop-flat stretch of trail in beautiful sun dapples and breezes. We rolled along easily to Prospect Rock for lunch. Josh revealed his last surprise: a gallon ziplock of marshmallows. We ate the crumbs out of our food bag and set out towards VT 11 to meet Mom & Dad. 
We made a stop at Spruce Peak Shelter for water and reconnected with Tin Man (from Dahlonega)! He’s taking the trail very slowly now, soaking it all in. He heard about this shelters 4 walls, sliding barn-style door, and working wood stove so he decided to stop in and check it out. I hope our paths continue to cross. 
Joni & I arrived at VT 11 several minutes behind the boys. They had already crossed over with Josh & were taking with Dad. The busy road was 3 lanes on a steep downhill and we were on the inside of a sweeping turn. It was a dangerous crossing. Cars were really moving fast. After we made it to the far shoulder we tried to decide if this was worse than Bear Mountain Bridge crossing. We didn’t decide but I’m glad we don’t have to do either again. The NASCAR pit stop of trail magic began here.
Josh & I climbed back into the bed of the truck as everyone ease took their seats and we headed to Depot Street Burgers in Manchester Center to meet mom and Danny. Danny is a middle-school friend of Dad’s who heard about their New England adventure and decided to join in. He’s got reservations at the same campgrounds that they do. I last saw Danny in the early 90s. 
Depot Street Burgers was jammin! Burgers, Fries, Drinks, more burgers for some, and Milkshakes. We got a 2 day resupply of food and fuel and repacked packs. Dad returned Josh to Green Mountain Hiker Hostel after farewells from everyone. His visit really lifted our spirits.
Dad retuned us to the trail at about 6:00 and we hiked the last 2 miles of the day to the shelter. We talked on the walk up about how we had just done in 2 hours what sometimes takes 6! We set up on a tent platform: 4 in the tent and me outside on the platform deck. No rain. Crisp evening. 
Joni’s leg really does seem to be on the mend. Less weight is the biggest factor. We’re looking at sub 2-pound tents to replace the 4-man. Joni and I would move into the new tent and the boys would move into the 3-person. We’d leave the 4-person on the sidelines. This may happen in the coming week. 
Today is day 39. I’ve often thought about how Jesus & the prophets felt coming out of the wilderness after 40 days. Were they pumped up, wearing sunglasses, staring at the camera while they swagger out from the trees? Did they sort out some stuff? Were they ravenously hungry? 
I know our experience differs from theirs in many ways but, unless I get some giant revelations on day 40 I anticipate being nearly as clueless after day 40 as I was on day 1! I need another 40! Thankfully, I think we might get it.","Stratton Pond Shelter

Day 40. We got our first glimpse of Mount Washington today. It’s still 200 trail miles ahead. The view we had was 110 miles away!


We climbed 1 mile out of the shelter this morning to the peak of Bromley Mountain. Bromley is a ski resort and the last quarter mile of trail was up a ski slope. The top had ski lifts and snowy pictures of the ski runs around the resort map. It was sunny and near 70 degrees. The views were awesome. No haze, no shimmer. The ridge line of Mount Washington, far to the north, was sharp and clear. I thought I might be able to make out the observatory on top - nonsense. 

We hiked down to Mad Tom Notch and then up and over Styles and Peru Peaks.
We met Compass Rose on Styles peak. She is the caretaker at Griffith Lake - still 3.5 miles ahead. She was up on Styles peak “doing paperwork.” It’s the closest place with cell service!


As Joni and I took in the view (the boys & Compass Rose were long gone) our friend Morten “Great Dane” came up the hill behind us. Joni met Morten on Facebook in February. He was looking for a ride from Cumming, GA to Amicalola to start his thru hike. He spent a night at our house and I drove him to Amicalola on March 26th. We thought there was a chance he’d catch up with us. He’s been doing some serious miles! He was planning on a 20-miler today but ended up spending all day with us. We caught to boys near Peru Peak and sat down for lunch.
We got to Griffith Lake early afternoon. Compass Rose was there having just finished a swim. We followed suit. The boys played and fished with ziploc bags (successfully!) while Morten, CR, Joni, me, and several other thru hikers talked about the caretaker job and trail news. TMI walked up and introduced himself - he’s a teacher In Pennsylvania section hiking the trail. He posed the question at the top of this entry to the group and to the boys in particular. What a great question with a stunning answer!
We finished off the last 4.3 miles to the shelter and arrived right about 5:00. Morten set up next to us. Ramen and freeze dried chicken with olive oil and crushed red pepper for dinner. WOW.

Morten woke at 5:30 this morning and started packing up. He had shortened his planned day yesterday from 20 to 15 miles so he could camp with us. That put home in a spot today needing 25 miles before dinner so he could catch a shuttle into Rutland. 
I had cowboy camped next to the two tents. It was a cold morning (42 degrees) so I was happy to get up with him and move around a bit. I walked up the trail to where our bear bags were hung and brought them back to camp. Morten ate his pop tart, we traded phone numbers, and said goodbye for now. I expect we’ll meet him again. 
A bit about the bear bag situation out here: In most stretches of the AT, bears taking food is not a problem at all. In nearly every stretch, the smaller furry woodland creatures are the nuisance - raccoon, skunk, mice, porcupine. Consequently, people hang pretty lazy bags on the trail. They are frequently low, poorly supported, and the tie-off is obvious. Raccoons are intelligent animals and, I believe, could defeat most hangs I see. If a coon couldn’t get it then mice would often be able to. A bear, if it was on the prowl, could make an easy meal of nearly every hang I’ve seen - I can think of 2 exceptions. To be fair, food theft is pretty rare out here. Mice are a problem but they are pretty easy to keep good from and don’t get much news of they manage a heist.
I spend way more time than average hanging a bag. I have wandered the woods and trails around a shelter for 30+ minutes looking for the right place. I’m often hanging 2 lines since we have the equivalent of 15 days of food for a single hiker after a 3-day resupply. Other hikers think the bags I hang are pretty overkill. Often high in a tree and far from camp, I’ve gotten a few comments and several sideways glances. Some of the hangs have been pretty rad. 
After saying goodbye to Morten I crawled into the tent. It was only 6:00 and we had a short, 10 mile day planned. We all laid in the tent until 7:00 waiting on the morning to warm up. 
We were on the trail by 8:00. Less than an hour and a half later, at our 2.8 mile mark for the day, we came to Big Branch and a suspension bridge over it. It was a clear creek in a wide, rocky basin indicative of frequent (probably seasonal) intense flooding. The boys were already playing in the rocks when I got there and Grayson was preparing to swim. He was underwater before 9:30am. The other boys and I opted out (being 9:30am on a chilly morning) and held out for Little Rock Pond. Grayson dunked several more times before we rolled on. 
As Grayson and I approached a road crossing, a southbound day hiker said, “hurry up! They’ll run out!”
“What?” we asked, quizzically. 
“Ice cream!”, he said. 
“Don’t do that to us.” I deadpanned. 
But he was right! Onesimus, who we had first met yesterday as we talked with Compass Rose at Griffith Lake, had handed the leaders in our crew a box of 5 ice cream sandwiches. There were two left. Onesimus is a man in his 60s, jacked, with a white ponytail. He lives in his RV and drives north on the trail each year doing trail magic. He’d had bananas in his pack at Griffith Lake - another one of those foods you don’t know you need until you see it. 
As we headed up the trail towards Little Rock Pond, leaving the parking area behind us, we were passed by nearly a dozen groups of people in the short 2 miles before getting there. It had been a booming Saturday night at the shelter and tenting area.
Little Rock Pond was our lunch stop. It was a real gem. As big as Stratton Pond but with prettier surroundings, and as cool as Griffith Lake but with a bottom that was easier on the feet. The shelter was a work of art with a picnic table surrounded by rail seating on the covered porch. We stopped there for more than an hour to lunch, nap, and swim. 
We set out on our last stretch about 3:00. Grayson found a wood-grain Corkcicle water bottle laying in the trail. It looked exactly like a piece of wood - not the best idea for a day hike in the woods. He packed it out since we see Grandpa in the morning. 
As we were headed downhill to camp for the night we passed a very cool rock cairn “garden”. The boys stopped and built mini dwarven fortresses on the larger boulders. Jasper and Joni left for camp. I discovered rare cell service here so I stayed wi the Grayson and Baxter. They built rock creations while I ordered a new tent.
We’ve realized the only way to pull this hike is to cut weight now. As we get stronger we can add weight back in later but we need lighter packs now. Joni is still sub-10 pounds and the current tent situation - 125% capacity - is untenable. So I ordered a sub 2–pound ZPacks Triplex tent for Joni and I. The boys will move into the 3-man Copper Spur tent we have. This saves us 3.5 pound total since we’re effectively trading the 4-man tent for this featherweight alternative. We should have it next week. 
Resuming our march downhill, we passed the last shelter before the road (unreliable water and off-trail) and headed for Bully Brook falls and it’s stealth site (Josh called it “ninja camping”). 
We found a spot next to the brook and above a waterfall, upstream from the trail crossing. It had a “jacuzzi” in the creek that we could all sit around and cool our feet and wash (“rinse out”) our shirts and socks in. It was refreshing! Dinner was Knorr side broccoli cheddar with freeze dried chicken, olive oil, and red pepper flakes. The cheese powder does a lot for the flavor. We strung a clothesline, hung the bear bags. Joni edited video, the boys started a new D&D adventure, I piddeled with the 10x10 silnylon tarp, trying out different pitches. I’ve ended up cowboy camping again. The cool night (not cold) with the brook as a sound machine in this stealthy site will make this a great night of sleep.","Lost Pond Shelter

We woke up from a great stealth site at Bully Brook around 7:00 we packed up on no rush, as Grandpa was resupplying us and bringing us breakfast at 8:30. We hiked 1.4 to Sugar Hill Road where we got in the back of Grandpa’s truck and rode to a back road to eat because we didn’t want to eat biscuits in the middle of a path full of hungry hikers. We spent a short while at the back road resupplying, talking, and eating the delicious Dunkin’ Donuts biscuits. We were dropped back off on the trail around 9:00,  half full, ready, and happy. We hiked for around 0.2 before coming upon a full-blown setup of trail magic. They had a plethora of food, ranging from store bought donuts to hot dogs and fresh watermelon. It was amazing, and we stayed there for another half hour before dragging our three-pounds heavier bodies and slung our packs on, grudgingly hiking away from the haven of food and drink. Me and dad were in the back, and turned a corner to find Jasper using the Merlin bird app to play vireo songs to a Red-Eyed Vireo. We gathered that that particular song was used to mark territories of the Vireo. The bird was livid and trying to find the ‘rival’ Vireo that was calling. It was a cool moment. We climbed yet another “Bear Mountain” (our third!) and then my stomach ache kicked in. Me, Dad, and Mom all had aches because of the pre-packaged donuts. Dad’s and Mom’s were fleeting, but mine stayed all day and well into the night. On top of that, I was cramping up from all of the digestion. It was an unpleasant, almost painful sensation for the first hour, and then settled to a dull throb for the rest of the day. We plummeted into Clarendon Gorge, a pretty gorge with a river in the bottom. We had to keep moving, so we only stayed for 30 minutes or so of swimming. We reluctantly climbed out of the lukewarm water and put on our packs to begin the massive climb up. We still had seven miles until the shelter, but Far Out had comments on a stealth site that was a manageable distance of 6, plus the climb out to add to the effort. 
The site was next to a brook and a road with a bridge. When we finally made it to the top of the rock scramble/steep hike out of the gorge, we were disappointed to find Beacon Hill ahead. This was a not-as-hard climb, but still very difficult. Beacon Hill had no view, except a cut opening down to the airport so the FAA ( Federal Air Association.) beacon could shine to the port. We arrived at the stealth site around 6:00, where we quickly ate Chili Mac and went to bed, after Dad hung an ingenious bear hang from a bridge. We checked out for the night late but ready for tomorrow.","Bully Brook

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654624,"We had decided as we laid down last night that we’d get moving at 6:00am. There were afternoon rain & thunderstorms in the forecast. Killington Peak was the next hill. 
Killington, at 4229 feet, is the tallest peak since Apple Orchard Mountain south of Shenandoah National Park, almost 900 miles behind us. It’s rocky summit isn’t the place to be in a thunderstorm. We knew an early start could get us over the summit before 10am - well ahead of the forecasted storm.
I set my alarm for 5:30. I was cowboy camping & had agreed to get the water boiling, bear bags retrieved, and rain fly off of tent (a natural “alarm clock”) before 6:00. I woke at 5:25, checked my watch, turned off the alarm, and promptly fell back asleep. Ten minutes later, a Winter Wren lit on a nearby branch and let off her melody. I reached for my watch to turn of the “alarm” and realized what had happened! Thanks, friend!
We were on the trail by 6:40 and got a spitting rain straightway. We pressed on after again checking the forecast. As we climbed, we could tell that the cloud cover above the thick canopy was moving fast - now very dark, now light, now sun dappled, now dim. The changes were a clue about the winds at altitude. Blowing from the west, it was a confirmation of changing weather.
As we got higher on the mountain, the forest changed from deciduous to boreal. Spruce and fir replaced birch and maple. The forest floor was covered in moss and small fern, both hiding rock and boulder beneath. The trail bed became littered with short needle and small pinecone making footfalls nearly silent. The smell was like Christmas Tree. Despite the elevation, now nearing four-thousand feet, the temperature stayed pleasant. The trail was on the leeward side of the ridge for most of the climb and the thick forest provided a good barrier when we gained the southern shoulder of the mountain.
We arrived at the Cooper Lodge Shelter at about 9:30. The boys had been there for 15 minutes and had talked with the recently departed Tin Man who had been in the peak for the morning sunset. The boys stashed packs in the shelter and we started up the blue-blazed side trail to the summit with rain gear in hand (I had decided it would probably be easier carrying my pack than having to put it back on again later - a decision I regretted in the next sentence). The trail quickly got steep, then very rocky, then hand-over-hand climbing in spots as it climbed 300 feet in 0.2 miles!

>span class=""s2"">We took a different path off the summit, one that led to the Killington Ski Resort. We had read that the Lodge was closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays (it was Tuesday) but hoped it would be opened at 10:00 as advertised. It was not. We took Tin Man’s advice and found a boardwalk, ski path, social trail that skirted around the mountaintop and back to Cooper Lodge. The forecast had put the storm at 3:00. We had 4.5 miles to go to our evening destination. We started north again before 11:00 with plenty of time to make it, feeling good about the days progress.


Vermont - The Green Mountain State. It’s name comes from Vert Mont; literally “Green Mountain.” (how am I 43 years old and hadn’t realized this until walking 50+ miles in the state itself?). Vermont has been a return to the woods after the business of New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Cell service is terrible (that’s refreshing), roads are gravel, nights are dark and quiet. The literal trail here is quiet. I mentioned before how the needles and cones muffle the hikers footfalls but the same happens at lower elevations. The rich soil - a key ingredient in the infamous mud - is malleable when damp. The leaves from the thick canopy, trodden by dozens of hikers a day, create a soft underfoot landing. Even the rocks, laid as level step stones in the trail, are easy to roll heel-to-toe on. All these together allow a 200lb guy with a 30-plus pound pack wearing size 14 waffle stompers to cruise nearly silently through the forest. It’s made for some interesting wildlife interactions. 
Yesterday, after the epic trail magic, I was a good 10 minutes behind 4th place in the marching order, alone with my thoughts, and rounded a switchback going up Bear Mountain. A chipmunk, facing me in the middle of the trail, was intently working over a new snack, turning it with his front paws as he shaved off the outer husk with his teeth. Another step from me would have made contact. I froze. He didn’t notice me at all. So engrossing was his morsel that we faced each other like this for nearly a minute. He finished his task, tucking the fern in his cheek, and turned 90 degrees to his left. I saw him see me at that moment; saw his body tense and flinch a millimeter lower, crouching. Sure that he had been spied but unsure of the best course of action (freeze or flight?) he became a statue. Another minute passed. Then two. Neither of us moved. Then shifting my weight ever so slightly, he detected my movement and was off like a rocket. A combination of quiet trail and an excellent chipmunk snack brought about that unlikely meeting. 
Two days ago, Joni and I were hiking together over similar trail when a Bluejay, close in on the trail to the right, let out a warning call, intimidating and insistent. A second, like a dog unsure of what he’s barking at, let out a similar call to the left of the trail. The second then flew across the trail in front of us and, I think, dove 10 feet on to the ground about 30 feet to the right of the trail. I’m not sure if it’s possible for a Bluejay to mimic an injured woodland creature but I think that second Jay gave it a shot. Joni and I had stopped and were intently listening for clues about what was going on. The first Jay continued to insist that we leave, repeating his original call at regular intervals. 
Had we come near a Bluejay nest? Were these the parents, trying to draw us away from the chicks? Had we startled them with our quiet approach? I wanted to go investigate the sound to our right but the trail beckoned us north. We moved along on Vermont’s quiet trail. 
Back on Killington, we were headed downhill, boys far in front, Mom and Dad bringing up the rear. Joni and I agreed that, while the day up to now had been difficult physically, we were both mentally tired. The race up to and over the summit together with a sprucing number of small decisions we were making on the summit had left us weary. We caught the boys at the trail junction to Pico and decided to eat lunch then. We had originally thought we’d get to the shelter first and then have a late lunch. Beef jerky, sharp cheddar, and Fritos made a terrific and satisfying lunch. We ate all of all of it.
Two more miles and 50 minutes later we pulled into Churchill Scott shelter. It was 2:30. There were 2 hikers there trying to decide if they should wait for the storm or leave and push on northward. She read the new forecast: “Severe thunderstorms before 5:00 with the potential for hail and damaging winds.” The radar showed a serious front moving in. That should settle any stay-or-go decision, shouldn’t it? They left.
We elected to keep the tent stowed for now but did lay out a ground cloth to claim our spot. We had decided that Baxter & I would do the shelter while the other three would tent. If the storm cleared out after 5 like the forecast and radar seemed to indicate then we could pitch (and later pack) a dry tent. 
Another hiker arrived not sure if she was staying but, aware of the forecast, relieved that she was under a roof. We waited. 

>span class=""s2""
>span class=""s2"">It was over as fast as it started. The sun was making shadows on the ground before ten minutes was up. The whole thing was fascinating. 
Mountain Man, a southbound section hiker, walked up, soaking wet. He was less than 2 mile into his hike having started at US 4, the paved road we’re headed to tomorrow. “I wanted to ask the shuttle driver to wait” he said. Less than 30 minutes after shouldering his pack he got hit with the storm.
About 20 minutes later Neo, Professor, and Gumby arrived. We had met them at Stratton Pond Shelter. They are NOBOs and were on the trail down from Killington when the maelstrom hit. Gumby sheltered under a tree. Professor ran. “I don’t know why”, she said. “Just excited.” They were wet to the core and their legs were filthy from ankle to waistline. “Looks like they’ve been four-wheelin’”, said Mountain Man, nodding at their legs. All were glad there hadn’t been lightning as the forecast had predicted.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654691,"Baxter has become our de facto Public Relations Officer on the trail. He talks with everyone we meet. I don’t say that as hyperbole. He’ll strike up a conversation with every person in the shelter, the SOBOs on the trail, day hikers, people at the outdoor cafes, store proprietors, and NOBOs passing us. He remembers everyone’s trail name, reads every shelter log, and frequently asks where other hikers we’ve met might be and when we might see them again.
I talked with the boys before we came about people on the trail. Yes, we’ll meet some winners but the trail has its share of losers and weirdos. I wanted them to have at least a small, if not generous, dose of skepticism about strangers. 
Baxter got none of that. If anyone here invited him into their van to see the puppies he’d be all about it. Thankfully there are no vans and few puppies.
So I struck up a conversation with him a few days ago about “sizing people up.” About listening to what people are saying, asking questions, watching behaviors, and noticing details in order to make a rough call about the person’s character. We’ve met several hikers over r past month that I reminded him of one by one and we talked about each of them. We’re not at homeschool-group day anymore. Not everyone can be your friend.

>span class=""s2"">Rich, a mid-sixty-year-old car mechanic, spent the next 20 minutes regaling me and the boys with stories of martial arts and archery, air-drew me a map of the road we were on and where it went in both directions, and continually tried to get Coco to swim or drink from the creek. He was a character. 
After he pulled off and we all went back to our evening doings I said to Baxter, “Let’s size Rich up. What do you know about him?” Interestingly, there is very little we actually knew about him. Was he from the area? He said he was. Was he a black belt martial artist? Did he compete in the world longbow championship? Was he just out driving backroads with his dog? Was he a mechanic? Did he own the car he was in? Was that his dog? Was his name Rich? The list went on and on. 
I think Baxter learned that we don’t really know much about Rich at all and that a 20-minute talk does not a friend make. We did decide he was probably a mechanic (he dressed like one), and that Coco was a kind dog, probably attached to a kind owner. Rich was also pretty entertaining. 
None of these talks have really dampened Baxter’s outgoingness - it’s who he is. It’s fun to watch. 
He has soaked up our afternoon and evening at Hanover Adventure Tours. It’s the first hostel we’ve stayed at. Grandpa dropped us off here about 12:00 and we’ve been enjoying our nero ever since. There are several new people here to meet and greet and Baxter has been all about it. They are all hikers or staff and all are up for swapping stories. 


Dad met us at US 4 just east of Rutland at 9:30 this morning. The 2 mile hike out was uneventful until within site of the road. I was, as usual, in the rear and came upon two treetops in the trail within 50 yards of each other. They were still green and completely blocking the trail with no sign of hikers walking through or around them. They had fallen in the storm yesterday. The hail and rain had been heavy, but not dangerous. These treetops were another deal altogether. These were deadly. Mountain Man (who arrived just as the storm ended) and the two hikers who had left the shelter headed north before the storm hit, all walked by this place within minutes of these tops coming out of the trees. It was a sobering lesson in the dangers out here that often go unthought of. I am, again, thankful we were inside a shelter. 
After we climbed into the truck we headed east for almost 2 hours. Hanover Walmart was the destination. We loaded mom & dad up with lunch and breakfast resupply food. Joni found a Moe’s restaurant within a mile and we headed over. The boys were insistent that I pull into the McDonalds for burgers and were vocally unhappy with me for instead turning left into a low-slung shopping center. “WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE. GO TO MCDONALDS. there’s a moe’s. THERES A MOES!”
My kids like Moe’s. We ate our fill of burritos and queso. Grandpa treated.  
We left Moe’s and drove to Hanover Adventure Tours (HAT). We gear-exploded under the circus tent outside and repacked with a 3-day resupply. Then we borrowed tubes from the nearby shed, crossed the road and the railroad tracks, and jumped into the Connecticut River. Thirty minutes of swimming in the wide & lake-like river was a blast for the boys.
We have 2 rooms at the hostel. Five people in the bunk room is almost as expensive as 2 private rooms. The boys got their own room and love it. (The parents love it too.)
We moved in and then headed downstairs for our $1 pint of ice cream (subsequent pints are $4.50). Reading, chess, naps, guitar, conversation, and more all filled the afternoon and early evening. We bought 2 frozen pizzas and soda from the fridge for dinner. We met Hot Rod and got her story. Laundry and showers did everyone good. 
Our bodies appreciated the day off but still let us know when 8:00 rolled around. That’s about hiker bedtime, if not a little late. Clean clothes in clean sheets with a window unit AC blasting in both rooms now. 
Goodnight.","Churchill Scott Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655063,"Woke up @ 6:20 in a bed after a killer nights sleep. The room was getting light Joni was already gone to the shower. I went downstairs and found Grayson ready to slay some pancakes. He’s usually last out of bed at 8:00 (Baxter is the early riser). The hostel was still quiet. 

Back in our rooms we repacked packs and brought them downstairs for the 9am shuttle circuit to Norwich and Hanover. We loaded the sprinter van with 3 other hikers who were headed to town for diversion & groceries. After a short ride we disembarked at Dan & Whits General Store in Norwich. We picked Norwich (instead of nearby Hanover) so that we’d walk into New Hampshire. No sense in leaving 2 states unfinished when we cross into Maine!

We turned north and downhill out towards the athletic complex and fields and came to the Hanover Food Co-op. We dropped packs and went in for drinks. We considered buying another trail meal in case the upcoming stretch of trail took longer than planned but opted to leave with only the drinks.
We were back in the woods shortly, climbing back into the mountains.
After 2 or 3 miles we came to a bridge/boardwalk over a marshy area. “HORNETS” read the sign on the bridge. Far Out confirmed that there had been several people stung over the course of the last two weeks. There was no way around. We backtracked and made a plan. Everyone giggled nervously as if someways about to run out of the woods and pie-in-the-face one of us. Who would be “chosen”? Or were all of us about to get it? We donned all rain gear and head nets. Socks were stretched to the max. We agreed to walk quietly with purpose but not to run. Grayson went first - he’s the kid that always gets stung. The first spot is the safest. Then Baxter right after. Then Jasper, Joni, and finally me. Te bridge was about 20 yards long and we were over it pretty quickly without incident. We regrouped 30 yards past the opposite side to debrief and eat lunch (and take off all that rain gear!). Disaster averted. 
We arrived at Moose Mountain Shelter about 5:00. We had been a little nervous about making the 12+ miles after a late start but it was a breeze. Dinner was cheesy mashed potatoes with heavy bacon bits.

Here we are, New Hampshire!
We’ll be back, Vermont! If we must choose a place to do a “victory lap” before finally turning south, you’re a great choice. Deli Blazing was fun but these Georgians have enjoyed being back in the  green mountains.","Norwich, VT

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655069,"My watch alarm beeped at 4:42 this morning. We had agreed with Morten to be on the trail by 5:30 so that we’d have a chance of beating the rain and catching the shuttle from The Flume Visitor Center to The Notch Hostel. Both the rain and the shuttle were due to Franconia Notch at 11:20. We had 8.8 miles of trail and another 1 mile blue-blaze to the visitors center. Our work was cut out for us. 
We got everyone up, packed, and fed fairly silently. The tenting area and shelter both were full with hikers.
Nine-point-eight miles in the nearly 6 hours of time we had seemed to be doable. We typically can consistently hike just under 2 miles per hour on good trail. Terrain will slow us down. Yesterday’s experience taught is that this is might not be “good trail” in front of us. 
We were on top of South Kinsman Peak at 7:30. It had taken us 2 hours to cover that 2.5 miles - you do the math. Also, to clarify, the pronouns “we” and “us” in the previous sentences refer to Joni and me. The boys, along with Morten, had smoked those first 2.5 miles and had cooled down by the time we arrived at the view. 
It was obvious to Joni and me that we wouldn’t make the shuttle. That wasn’t a huge deal since Mom & Dad could help get us to the hostel. I told Morten he should go ahead and hoof it the remaining 6.5 miles so he could get a ride - there wouldn’t be room in Dad’s truck for all of us. The boys we disappointed in the change of plans. 
We came to Lonesome Lake Hut at 9:30 - 3 miles to go. With the prospects of getting wet becoming real, we resigned ourselves to it. We went inside and ate baked goods and leftover eggs and sausage from the morning’s breakfast.
We shouldered packs and walked down to the pond itself. What followed was our first “lost child” story (happy ending…). 

We chose a path a started up it for 30 feet, saw a blue blaze, and came back. The correct option was obvious now. On we went; Grayson in front, then me, Joni, Jasper. After about 500 yards or more I realized Texas Pete was missing. “Where’s Baxter?” I asked. Grayson pointed to the rear. Jasper pointed to the front. I knew exactly what had happened. 
Baxter, who had been studying the minnows and tadpoles, heard us make our first decision - maybe had even watched us start down the (wrong) path. Then we four had switched our course and headed down another path. He hadn’t watched any of it. So when he stood up to follow, we were gone (not unusual). He set off down the first path. 
I took off my pack and began jogging back up the hill, knowing he’d be hiking fast away from me trying to catch the group. 
About halfway back the the junction I heard him “whoop” - a little bit of panic in his voice. I whooped back to let him know I was there. He had stopped a group of oncoming hikers on path 1 to ask of they’d seen us (smart kid). They said they didn’t think they had - not a terribly helpful answer. He had hiked on another several yards before deciding he was probably on the wrong trail.  
It was a good lesson for all of us. I’m sure this will happen again. We’ve talked with the boys several times about what to do if they’re lost both on and off the trail. Baxter played it perfectly. Being lost is scary. 

The rain began to settle into the canopy as we neared. We made it inside the building at 12:00 just as we were getting damp. We had missed the shuttle, we learned later, by only 15 minutes! We had also, thankfully, beat the rain. It was the successful culmination of a plan we had hatched coming down Moosilauke yesterday.","Eliza Brook Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655071,"Got walking this morning at 8:00. We had a big climb (South Twin) and two huts today.
We took a left onto the AT from the campsite blue-blaze and the trail got into a creekbed. I haven’t seen this many times but there are blazes on the trees lining the bank. “Creek” may be a tad generous but there isn’t a better word. We made it down the hill where the creek was forced off the trail by a monster waterbar. 
We made our first stop at Galehead Hut around 10:15. Chess, Banannagrams, and snacking filled the 30 minute break there. 
Straight after the hut was the ascent of South Twin Mountain. The profile looked daunting and the other hikers on the trail had hyped it up. It was steep but only 0.8 miles. Other, less steep climbs have been more difficult but South Twin’s southern slope had good places for the foot to land. It makes a huge difference in the mental and physical load.
We had a lunch of bagels, cheese, & beef jerky atop the peak and watched the morning clouds being pushed out by the stiff breeze. By the time we got up to leave at 12:15 the whole day was laid out before us: Mt Guyot, Zeacliff Rodge, Zealamd Falls Hut (hiding behind the ridge), and Ethan Pond, 6.5 miles as the crow flies but over 11 by trail. Another big afternoon ahead. 
About an hour later as we created the ridge of Guyot I was pointing out the direction of Mt Washington with my right-hand hiking pole when I took my first real fall. I rolled my left ankle hard and could do nothing but hit my knees. It really stinks to fall forward with a pack on your back. I stood up slowly and shook it off. I feel lucky it wasn’t worse. The boys have each had a pretty good fall or two. Joni has avoided a hard fall so far. 
We cruised into busy Zealand Falls hut about 4:30. Grayson and I took a dip in the nearby falls. We considered stealth camping nearby but we got in to son east, flat, trail and started making time. Maybe the trail was an old road here but the rocks, roots, and rivulets were gone. It was a cakewalk. We made the 4.5 miles to Ethan Pond by 6:45. 
We had dinner with Rocketman, Lazarus, and Great Dane. Jasper discovered a trail magic comment in Far Out for tomorrow morning in Crawford Notch. 
We started to talk about slowing things down some. Our mileage over the last 6 days has been 12, 16, 17, 16, 10, 10, and today’s 15. Why are we doing such big miles on such hard trail!?

I was rounding a corner coming downhill off of South Twin peak several days ago. Below me about 10 yards ahead, in the middle of the trail, a Grey Jay was washing himself in a puddle. I was able to stand and watch him for several minutes. He looked very clean to begin with but, nevertheless, spent some worm-energy and daylight time to stop and clean himself. Our cats at home do this too; lick themselves incessantly despite looking always clean. I’ve never seen a dirty snake, rabbit, fox, bear, or bird. Fur coats are always smooth and shiny, feathers are always arranged orderly, scales are shiny.
Hikers, on the other hand, are typically pretty filthy. It takes a lot of work to keep yourself clean outdoors. I’m a pretty sweaty guy and my boys come by it honestly. One of the reasons I enjoy swimming in the wilderness is that it gets the salt off, un-mats the hair, exorcises the pores (if only there was a sauna!). 
Hygiene is made more difficult by the lack of routine out here. Brushing teeth, hand sanitizing, tick checks, and the like don’t come naturally. I did, early on, set my watch alarm to sound every night at 7:42. I make an announcement: “The time is 7:42. Check your body for ticks. When you’re done, check pets of your neighbor’s body too. The alarm went off at Stratton Pond Shelter in the middle of dinner time. I made the announcement a bit louder than usual and 20 hikers, without batting an eye, got right to it like it was completely normal.)
We’re still working in a hygiene routine. It seems like the hikers with the best tooth-brushing routine brush immediately after eating. Hand sanitizer is in the poop kit as well as on the shoulder strap. Baby wipes are on quick draw. We still have a hard time even finding the toothbrush some days!
I awoke around 6:30 this morning in our dark bunk room. I’d been feeling pretty bad yesterday and had gone to bed about 7:30. I made my way downstairs and started navigating the kitchen, cooking breakfast among 5 other hikers doing the same. One of the girls said “I feel like we’re in a musical! We just need a song to sing.” Six cooks in the small kitchen was pretty comical. Not much was said but everyone was polite, trying to be as small as possible. I got 5 “Uncle Buck” sized pancakes, 2 pounds of bacon, and a dozen eggs cooked as the boys and Joni appeared in their usual order: Baxter, Joni, Jasper, and finally Grayson. 
Grandpa was at the hostel at 8:15 to shuttle us back to Crawford Notch. We stopped for some cash in Lincoln on the way.
We got back to the trailhead and we’re shouldering packs when Grayson started crying. He wasn’t feeling good at all. He said his throat was sore and he had a headache. I asked if we should take a zero - we had mentioned the possibility to the group yesterday. He said he thought he’d be fine, that he just wanted to sleep a little longer. Joni and I looked at each other and had the conversation-with-eyes-only that spouses do occasionally. We decided to go ahead. 
Webster Cliffs was first. We could see the overlook high above us from the road. About halfway up I have Grayson an aspirin, a Benadryl, and an inhaler puff. Those did their work shortly, even the Benadryl and it’s “sleepy” side effect. We found a pretty sweet stealth site way back in the Hemlocks where we could eat lunch out of the wind. Bagels, cheese, and beef jerky were on the menu. Joni and I decided that Grayson and I would nap there for an hour and a half while she hiked in with Jasper and Baxter. We were only 4 miles from Mizpah Hut and it’s nearby tent sites. I gave Joni the stove kit and they headed onward. Grayson and I got out puffy jackets and sleeping mats and both promptly fell asleep. What a great nap! We awoke at 2:40 and packed up. Grayson was feeling much better. Hopefully that trend continues.
We hiked on. As I walked down the trail a dark blue bird, maybe a Junco, flew over my left shoulder at speed, dropped 2 feet in the trailway, and banked into the thick fir forest. I watched him for the split-second possible navigate his way through the branches and trunks with irregular wing flaps, short dives, and banks to the left and right. As I walked forward and aligned my line-of-sight with his direction of flight I was astonished at the density of the forest he had just slipped through. I have a similar appreciation for the 3-D mapping of the forest that a squirrel must have - the exact negative of the Junco’s mapping! Then I pull out my simpleton’s foldable, 2-D map to see where we’re going next (or worse, the dumbed-down 1-D profile map so popular with thru hikers). 
Over Webster, over Jackson, and down to the hut. We arrived about 5:30. Many of our NOBO friends are here: Trash, Frodo, Samwise, Grass, Zipper, Catch-up, Snoopy, Clean Machine, and Yogi. 
Mountain House for dinner. A hiker was giving an impromptu lecture to the group on the “kitchen” on the importance of breakfast calories. It was like a sermon in church that you’re sure the pastor wrote after hearing about your most recent sins. We need to up our breakfast game. 
We’re set up in a tent platform. Joni and Grayson in the Copper Spur, the other 3 of us in the Triplex.
We’ve got several options for tomorrow night’s tenting. Washington’s summit is just over 6 miles from here. Getting on the north side of that is priority. There are some options for renting off the north side of the ridge. Osgood tent site is 15 miles from here and down Madison’s notoriously steep NOBO descent. We’ll let tomorrow write itself…","US 302

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655257,"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.   from Luke 16
We set out from Nauman Tentsite just north of Mount Jackson at 7:00. Mizpah Hut is directly next to the tent sites. Joni had gone inside, poured a cup of coffee, and was looking for the cash box so she could pay. “Coffee is only for the hut guests.” She was told. Oh well. She came outside with a free mug of coffee. Baxter and I wished we had done the same. 
Less than a mile in we were on top of Mount Pierce and got our first view of Mount Washington’s summit almost 2000 feet higher and 6 trail miles away. It was cloaked in a robe of clouds that showed signs of a strong northeasterly wind. The surrounding sky was blue and the sun was rising clear and strong. I felt like it was the makings of a good summit day. Anything can happen on Washington, though, so we just nodded and got back to work. 
We came next to Mount Eisenhower, “Ike”. Years ago the AMC moved the AT off the summits of the high peaks (excepting Washington and Madison) and rerouted the trail using the “bad weather” bypass. Too many hikers were making poor decisions to stay in the trail despite bad weather. Here was the first time the AT would skirt a peak instead of going over it. We elected for the summit and set out for the top. It added a quarter mile and 500 feet of total elevation change to the day; not a big deal when you’re fresh. 
I had the Presidential Traverse on my mind. The Traverse is completed when a hiker bags the summits of the 11 peaks in the range over 4000 feet. I figured (with Jasper) that as long as we were here we should just knock it out! 
Grayson and I later took the short side trail to the open summit of Franklin. The summit of Washington was still trying to sort out the clouds. We started to hear the first trains pulling out of the cog railway station in the northern valley below. 
At the 4-mile mark we came to the summit trail for Monroe. The distance was roughly equal to the side trail but the summit would add another 500 feet of total elevation change to the day. Joni decided here that she wasn’t going to pursue the presidential traverse. She knew the mileage and now was familiar with the trailbed. She wanted to save her energy for the descent of Osgood Ridge at the end of the day. She took the side trail and said she’d meet us at The Lakes if the Clouds hut just 0.8 miles ahead. (This was, it turned out, the smartest move any of us made that day.) 
As we topped Monroe the hut and it’s namesake lakes came into view below nestled into a high saddle 1.5 miles south of and 1300 feet below the summit of Washington. Baxter and Grayson had gone ahead and left Jasper and I to take in the view. As we watched, the sun finally burned off the last wisps of Washington’s clouds. The observation tower and the many antaenna atop the mountain were now clearly visible! We could see, too, 3 guys in the largest lake below taking a morning swim. Our minds became singularly focused - we must swim!
We bombed off Monroe, met up with the three others, and were all soaking in the lake in no time. We spent only a brief break there since it was now 11:00 and we were only 5 miles in. 

We headed back outside to wait in line for a summit picture with dozens of other people - some we knew from the trail, others had their yippie dogs dressed in sweaters.
We hit up bathrooms and refilled water. Then faced north to study the second half of the day: close at hand lay a sharp descent to the Gulfside Trail, then Mounts Clay,  Jefferson, Adams, and Madison. It was also the first view of the Great Gulf Wilderness, the bottom not visible from our summit vantage point.
Less than a half mile down the trail we came to the cog railway tracks. Baxter saved the molar he lost last night to see if he could get the cog rail train car to crush it. Success! 
Another half mile brought us 800 feet below the summit to the first view into the bottom of the Great Gulf. I was almost more impressed with the depths of the Gulf than with the heights of the mountains around it. The relief between the two is stunning. 
Upon arriving at Mount Clay’s summit trail, we learned that it sometimes isnt counted as it’s own peak in the peak-bagging world but rather is a sub-peak of Washington. Tired, and having just seen the “menu” for the day, we all elected to skip the summit of Clay. Also, Henry Clay was not a president and so, by the loosest definition, isn’t included in a presidential traverse. 

We took a short “packs-off” afternoon break in the sun at breezy Edmonds Col. The wind, while sometimes pushy and gusting into the 30s, had been fresh and steady through the day. The sun was hot but a 15 mph wind cooled the body. We ate a mid afternoon snack. 
From here, the trail rises for the next mile over a low bump (Adam’s V) and skirts Mount Sam Adams. The wind was strong here and the 2:30 sun was very hot. We pulled into Thunderstorm Junction about 3:00. Mount Adams loomed high to our right. One of the six trails leading out of this junction headed to the summit. We were all pretty beat.  Another 500 foot of vertical wasn’t appealing to any of us. We were still more than 5 miles from camp with Madison to climb and Osgood Ridge to descend. We all took the side trail. We’ll leave the Presidential Traverse for a different trip.
We arrived at Madison Springs Hut at 5:00. ‘Twas a hopping place. We decided to do dinner here since there was plentiful water and since we all needed a good long break. A meal in bellies would help fuel the miles ahead. We boiled water and had Mountain House entrees. Snickers for dessert. Snoopy was here and scored a “work for stay” deal. Hikers get dinner leftovers and can sleep on the floor of the dining room. They help with breakfast, strip bunks, and get the breakfast leftovers. Most huts take only 2 workers per night. Clean Machine and Not Yet were also hanging around. I met Timber, a SOBO who seemed to be taking his time towards Springer. 
We shouldered packs and climbed 500 feet to the summit of Madison. The sun was on its descent now. The second half of our day’s hike was in full view back to Washington’s summit 4.5 trail miles across the Great Gulf fixed. We could see, too, for the first time today, the descent down Osgood Ridge to Pinkham Notch. 
As the shadows of the western ridge swallowed the Great Gulf we gingerly picked our way amongst boulders down to the tree line. 
At this point, now out of the alpine zone, we were searching for a suitable campsite for the night. The light was still favorable and we came across several sites that would fit one or two people. Finding a place for 2 three-man tents, however, is a challenge. After several hopeful prospects, none of which panned out we resigned ourselves to the Osgood Tentsite a mile ahead and downhill, hoping it wouldn’t t be full when we arrived. We donned headlamps when the forest became too thick for the twilight to pass through the hemlock canopy. 
We found Osgood in the dark. We were all very tired having hiked 14.5 miles above tree line though rocky terrain across a toothy profile. Joni found an open tent platform in the back of the area. We were set up and supine in record time. 
What a day! Great weather! Alpine views of terrain unmatched this side of the western mountains! Chili Dogs for lunch! We’ll have about 180 days of walking when we finish this journey. Many are like the day before and the day after, blurring together into a green tunnel. Only a handful will stand out from the others like I’m sure today will.

‘Well, I suppose there’s no place like home,’ she said.
‘No,’ said Granny Weatherwax, still looking thoughtful.  ‘No.  There’s a billion places like home.  But only one of ‘em’s where you live.’
‘So, we’re going back?’ said Magrat.
‘Yes.’
But they went the long way, and saw the elephant
I’ve asked each of the boys if they miss home. We’re on day 55 today and it seems reasonable that home would be missed by now. “Not really,” they’ve replied. They miss the cats. They miss their friends. But no one has mentioned missing home. Joni feels the same way. Me, too. 
I’m sure the day will come when we just want to be home. The adventure, however, is alive and well. We are seeing the elephant for sure. 
Our goal today was Pinkham Notch. Dad would pick us up there and take us back to the camper. He couldn’t be at the notch until 2:00 so we had ages of time to manage. 
We didn’t get packed up until 8:30. Sleeping in felt great for everyone. The hike out was gentle and well worn. Several of the miles followed an old roadbed. 
Roadtrip 2018 took us to New England with the Moores and the Harpers. We have fin memories from the White Mountains with them. Mt Washington auto road was one of the highlights. The At crosses the auto road low on the mountain. We had pulled the vans over at one of the several pullouts on the road. It happened that the AT ran through the pullout. I gathered some kids (Jasper, Grayson, Emma, & Clare I think) and we hiked the 1.8 miles to the visitors center at Pinkham Notch. 
Today was the day we recalled that same section in the same direction. Grayson nor I remembered many particulars about the path but the forest, with paper birch and hemlock sharing the fern-and-moss covered forest floor was what impressed us on both hikes. We crossed two larger creeks and many smaller rivulets all emptying out the western slopes of Osgood Ridge. 
We soon found the notch and its visitor’s center. Joe Dodge Lodge is here along with a cafeteria. We bought Thru hiker cards from the caretaker at Garfield Mountain last week. One of the perks is $2 soup and bread at the Pinkham Notch Cafeteria. Grayson wasn’t sure he wanted soup so I took his card with me to the lunch counter. The two choices were Tomato and Cold Gazpacho. I didn’t understand what he said for the second option so I replied “one of each.”  Cold Gazpacho is my new favorite. I got my share of tomato soup as well. 
We checked out the gear shop, talked with the other hikers, and napped under the hemlocks outside. 
Dad showed up at 2:15 to haul us all back to their new campground close to Crawford Notch. We piled in for the 40 minute ride that essentially “unwound” our hike. The presidential range is a horseshoe with the low end to the south. Washington is on the bottom left (southeast) with Pinkham Notch on the bottom right. We had hiked the horseshoe clockwise. Now we were driving the road widdershins very nearly back to our starting point. We replayed the hike out the drivers side windows for the full 40 minutes. 
Rain was in the forecast for the evening. We set up tents underneath a tarp I slung to hep shed the rain. Mom and Dad have a collapsible screened in gazebo that we use as a “pack room”. We were all showered within the hour. 
Tomorrow’s plan is to zero here. That let us relax a bit through the evening knowing that most of the chores could be left for tomorrow. 
Bacon Cheeseburgers were for dinner - awesome.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655704,"Zero days can be a bit of a bummer. Not because they are “bad” days but because we have high expectations for them that usually go unmet. What’s not to like about a day with zero miles hiked!? Well, I’ll tell you. 
A zero day isn’t about lounging around by the pool with paper umbrellas in your mai tai(s). There are the zero day chores. And while I’m sure that solo hikers have their chaired, too, chores for five take it to a new level. 
We ate breakfast off the griddle at 8:00 - bacon, eggs, and pancakes - and got right to the list. Joni, Jasper, and I got into the truck and drove about 45 minutes to North Conway, the nearest metropolis. We were gear hunting. Shoes for me and Grayson, sleeping mat & poles for Jasper, a new cook system, and other flotsam. We left REI with most of what we were looking for (I passed on the new cook system - I’d rather have the $270). 
Laundry, Walgreens, and Walmart we’re also our list. North Conway is the type of town you’d like to walk around and check out the shops but we weren’t done with our chores until 1:00 and were ready to get back to the campsite.
Joni had ordered 3 packages in the weeks previous to be delivered to Twin Mountains Campground. We learned on the way back that only two had arrived. She had learned about Injinji compression socks from Lotus and ordered a pair. Twin Mountains hadn’t seen them despite the tracking information saying they’d been delivered. “Sometimes packages get delivered to the town hall”, the manager told us. So we drove to the town hall. 
“We’ve never had a package for the campground delivered here. I do t know what she’s talking about. You should check the post office.”
So we went to the post office. It turns out that the campground gets packages delivered here! The socks were waiting to be picked up. Joni was a little miffed that the manager had said nothing about the post office! Crisis averted.

If Mirkwood was a Christmas tree farm, the northern whites match that description exactly. At least Mirkwood was flat for Bilbo and company. We seem to be in the Mountains of Mirkwood. Not nearly as flat. The smell of fir and spruce is no longer alluring, sadly. Maybe on the flip my soft spot for pine scent will return from the mountains in which I lost it.


Everyone ran around chaotically as usual as we prepared to leave the campsite and hit the trail once more. A foreboding, unspoken feeling of resignation permeated Swiss Family Robinson. The topography was to blame. Grandpa dropped us off at Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, a narrow gap in between the southern presidentals and Wildcat ridge. 
     Wildcat Mountain has a ski lift and ‘spaceship’ ski control room at the top. A few outbuildings stand on the summit, and the beginnings of ski runs disappear off the sides of the mountain. Wildcat’s ancillary peaks, conveniently label B through E, lay between us and the summit proper. We classified the peaks as we traversed them. 
     Wildcat B: Beginner
     Wildcat C: Copacetic 
     Wildcat D: Difficult 
     Wildcat E: Easy
     The original ascent to Wildcat E rises 2000+ feet in two miles, meeting our steep equation.
     If:
     Miles x 1000 = Elevation gain
     Then:
     Steep


     This occurs often in the whites, though the steep formula being met for two straight miles is unusual. Not to mention extremely difficult. We set out, the first half mile flat across a forest to the base of the Wildcats. 


                 WARNING
A deceased and decaying moose lays near the first overlook to Lost Pond. The .2 side trail is still open and safe to traverse.
Unfortunately, no moosey corpse was anywhere to be seen. A large grey heron was spotted (it lazily flew away to the opposite shore as I stealthily approached) and rumors of otters on the far shore abounded. I did not see any otters. I otter look closer next time.
     The ascent up Wildcat E was not as tough as previously thought; the trail had stone or even wooden stairs in some places, and despite the steepness it was not all that difficult. It did take at least two hours to ascend the Wildcats, because it was noon by the time we reached the ski area. A sign said that you could see the Atlantic Ocean from the top, ninety miles away. The horizon in that direction was unusually flat, but no ocean was to be seen. 
      The clouds parted, and we were rewarded with magnificent views of Mount Washington and the northern Presidentals, as well as the Great Gulf Wilderness. As it turns out, the base of Washington forms the southern portion of Pinkham Notch, and we had no idea it was that close. 
     After lunch we descended into Carter Notch, in which the Carter Notch Hut lies, the northernmost AMC hut. It’s also the smallest hut, but it was also my favorite. Their chess set was decent (wooden!) and the bathrooms were nice. We were also able to redeem the last of our thru hiker passports for bread and cake. Noice. 
     The slog up Carter Dome took awhile, but it wasn’t unduly challenging. We walked along the ridge to Mount Hight, looking for stealth spots. One presented itself, but the rocks and roots compelled us to seek a better spot. 
     We camped at Zeta Gap, a reforestation area with no camping allowed. I did, however, find a nice spot with a fire ring and two even pads for tents. (It was well outside the ‘no camping’ area. I didn’t even see a sign, although there was a board nailed to a tree in front of the site we were in. It might have once held a sign that might have read ‘no camping.’ Had the sign been up, we might not have camped here. But that’s a lot of mights.)

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655706,"Joni had one of the best nights of sleep yet. The woods in Zeta Gap were dark, quiet, and we were far away from the footpath. It was one of the coldest nights, too; probably in the mid forties. 
We had 13 miles of trail to cover before meeting Mom & Dad in Gorham. Joni and I got moving at 6:00 and had our bags packed in about 20 minutes. We got the boys moving as I started water boiling. 
We haven’t done hot breakfasts on the trail. I’ve boiled water for coffee on occasion but we’ve relied on bagels, bars, pop tarts, and honeybuns for our morning calories. We’ve overheard and participated in several conversations over the past week where seasoned NOBOs say they’re getting 1000 calories at breakfast. That’s bonkers. I can do that at Reid’s cafe with a plateful of food but getting it on the trail is not easy. Hot breakfast is one way to get those calories in. It comes at the expense of time and fuel. 
I brought along instant oatmeal and instant grits packets. We carefully poured the hot water into the packets themselves. Grits got bacon bits poured in them. I’d like to get cheese in there, too, in the future. Everyone had two of these packets for breakfast. I added a bar and a “cup” of vanilla coffee (protein powder and instant coffee made in doubled up grits packets). I’m not sure if I hit 1000 calories but I must have come close. I did feel much better than usual walking out of camp. A breakfast like that keeps the fire burning longer. 
Mount Moriah is the last of the peaks in the Whites. As we made our way towards the summit throughout the morning we got some impressive views of the presidential range. The clouds and light made them a new sight each time they came into view. The range is a pretty imposing spectacle. We were glad to be northbound with the memories instead of southbound with the unanswered questions.
We ate an early lunch at Imp campsite. Jasper and I walked the 0.3 of a mile to the shelter and campsite to get water. It was stunningly quiet. It made me want to set up camp there at 10:30 and listen to the forest for the rest of the day. The shelter was a newly built, log cabin style structure. The water was flowing down a rock slab next to a rock wall for 20 yards. 
Moriah came and went with little pomp or circumstance. The White Mountains are behind us! The White Mountain National Forest continues north of Gorham for another 10 miles but it has no more major peaks. 

Dad was waiting for us on the south side of US 2. He had left Mom on a park bench in town so there would be room in the truck. As we passed the park on the way to the pizza joint Dad dropped me off to hang out with her. The pizza joint didn’t have Wi-Fi - a deal breaker since Joni was uploading videos. We all eventually ended up at the BBQ place. We toasted July and our successes. 
Mom and Dad have been a huge help to us. I’m writing this after they’ve left us. We have 5 days of food on our bags - more than we’ve ever had. Having them here in Vermont and New Hampshire has allowed us to carry only two or three days at a time. They slackpacked us twice - once on a key stretch of trail over Moosilauke. We spent several nights at the camper complete with dinners and breakfasts. Grandies sandwich lunch in Clarendon Gorge was a Vermont highlight. We had dinner with them in Manchester and again in Gorham. Dad was with us at Moe’s on the ride from Rutland to Hanover. The truck came in handy for Rutland X-rays and the North Conway REI run. 
We seemed to have timed the “boost” pretty well. Skipping a section of trail was a tough decision but lining up their help with our trail was worth the extra logistics. 
Grandie says it was like a mission trip - you’re just out there helping other people. We feel honored to have been helped. 
After dinner we distributed the resupply food. Mom & Sad made one more run to dollar general for us. We packed packs and said goodbye to Grandie. She waited at the Dunkin Donuts next door while we all loaded up the truck. Dad drove us back to the trail and we hauled our stuff 100 yards into the woods where we set up camp for the night. After meeting us at Stratton-Arlington road on July 4 two hundred trail miles ago, we said goodbye on Hogan Road in Gorham, New Hampshire. Thank you, Mom & Dad.","Zeta Pass

I nervously walk into the classroom as the other students are milling around and taking seats. I choose a desk down the first row, near the door. I’m not sure I’m in the right place. I don’t know any of these characters.
Ms White walks into the room as the clock strikes the hour. Everyone takes a desk and the talking quiets down. Ms White is old. I’m not sure if she’s ninety or nine hundred. Her hair is a mess as if it’s been in the wind for awhile.
“Hello, class. You’re in room 13. I’m Ms White. This is Backpacking 3302: Advanced Trailblazing and Strength Training.”
I’m in the wrong place! I reach down for my pack, aiming to sneak out. 
“Ahem. You’re leaving?” she asks me.
“I’m sorry. I’m on the wrong classroom. I’m registered for Backpacking 1102: Intro to Thru Hiking.” I hear some snickers from the back of the room. 
“Oh, yes.” she smiles. “This is the right place. This class is double-rostered. You’re in with the graduate level students. You’ll be just fine. You can take your desk back.” More snickers from the back. 
I move back to my desk. These are all stand-up desks. There’s nowhere comfortable to sit anywhere in this room. The floor is covered with variously-sized boulders, all unstable.
“We’ll start today with a warm-up hike. You can leave your packs here today.”
We go to Mount Moosilauke and slackpack northbound. It was a beautiful day. We finished in Kinsman Notch at 3:00, just about the time school was to let out for the day. We grouped up in the parking lot, prepared for Ms White to wrap up the day. I felt accomplished.
“Is everyone warmed up now?”
I’m confused. “Warmed up?” I’m done. Everyone else nods. A nice man hands me a root beer and a tomato & cheese sandwich. 
She continues, “Now take your packs and we’ll all head to Eliza Brook Shelter.”
“Isn’t that seven more miles?”, I ask. 
I get hit with a paper airplane from behind. She doesn’t answer. Everyone picks up packs. We head out. I don’t belong here  I’m out of my league  



The morning alarm rings at 4:45.“Good morning class! Hurry along now! Rain is coming and it’s 11 miles to the busses. They run early today at 11:30am. Good luck!”
Everyone else at the shelter sleeps another hour or more. I’ve got to get going if I’m going to make the bus. 
I missed the bus. I barely missed the rain. Everyone who was sleeping at the shelter passed me today. I had to call my dad to come and pick me up. 


Days pass like this - Franconia Ridge, Mt Garfield, Crawford Notch, Webster Cliffs, the Presidentials, and finally down into Pinkham Notch. I was exhausted.

I get held back for a day. I only just squeaked out the Carter peaks.


Ms White congratulated me on finishing. “You’ll do great in the next class,” she says as she escorts me to room 14.

He caused problems, disrupted plans, and wasn’t as cooperative as would have been nice. He’s got lots of friends - students and other teaches included. You like him - really - but more so at the beginning of class or on half days. You know, as you say goodbye, that it’ll be best just seeing each other in the hallways or at the Friday night football game; just not everyday. 


Saying goodbye to New Hampshire is like saying goodbye to your first car after it gets totaled by a minor fender bender. You’ve got some great memories from that car despite the fact that it was breaking down at inopportune times, smelled like the old cologne that the former owner spilled, and was 10 years past its prime. You were stunned when the insurance company totaled it. Then you realize, after a day or two, that while it was a great car, there are lots of other cars around that suite you better. You’ll keep some great memories and stories about that car but it’s time to move on. 


Saying goodbye to New Hampshire is like finishing that helping of side dish that gets served at Thanksgiving. It gets lots of hype from the crowd and it does taste pretty good but you decide you like it best once a year (or less) and only on special occasions.

It’s 6:45, the sun pokes through the trees, Baxter’s already awake, packed and ready to go. The water is about one-hundred yards to our left, large stacks of lumber are stacked around the shelter. I’m thinking about our cats, sleeping, probably. Mahoosuc notch starts 1.6 miles north of here. I slide out of my sleeping bag and unzip the tent door, and start packing up my pad and pillow, I’ll pack my sleeping bag after breakfast. Breakfast consists of instant oatmeal, not the worst. Pop tarts are the worst, too sweet. As we leave I look back at the shelter the words PRIME are etched into the wall some Roman numerals under it, I take a good look at it and wonder what number it is. It’s 2022: MMXXII, I pass the Full goose shelter sign and adjust my poles as we walk away from the shelter.


Around 7:15 we reach the south end of the notch. Dad starts a stopwatch as we enter the notch and start the 1 mile trudge through the notch. This mile is known as the hardest mile of the AT, in the end it takes us two hours to traverse it. In the notch there are three caves that the trail winds through, on your left there’s always a game trail or a social trail that leads around the obstacle. At the start and end of the notch there’s campsites; no water at either of them, but there’s a cold stream that winds through the notch. Clean machine ,Blaze Dog and Wick were in the notch, too. After the notch there’s Mahoosuc arm, a 2000 foot climb in 1.6 miles. At the top no view can be seen except for a fire tower on top of old speck mountain. We hike around another mile to Speck Pond Shelter. On the way we meet a NOBO named Journeyman. He has some cool cat shorts and a mug with Christmas trees on it. Journeyman is hiking with two friends named Tennessee Pickles and Fuel Can. We have lunch at a rock on outcropping. There’s tortillas, cookies, beef jerky and tuna. After that we climb Old Speck Mountain while reciting poems and ranting about how weak Old Speck is to get our minds of of the rock face in front of us. A long downhill leads to water. Everyone is tired and disappointed that we’ve only been 10.6 but on Monday we’ll be sleeping in a bed.
We’re all joking about how there will be burgers and hotdogs at the bottom but there are none. I turn to look at the message board and something on my left catches my eye, a cooler about thirty feet down the trail I run toward it and open its piece of paper reads,

We walk back into the woods and find a stealth site, hang a bear bag and set up tents. As I write this I think of me writing this and that version of me thinking about writing this.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655907,"Breakfast was on the table at 7:00. Pancakes, sausage, eggs, potatoes, and fruit. Coffee, OJ, & apple juice to drink. Five stars!
Hopper loaded 10 people and their gear into the minivan. We pulled out at 8:00 headed to ME 17 trailhead. I sat in the floor facing the rear of the van behind the front passenger. The drive took about 45 minutes. I was glad when we arrived!
We planned on slackpacking the 13 miles back to South Arm Road where Hopper had met us yesterday. Both the morning and the afternoon shuttles would work better if we headed south. 
We set out from ME 17 overlooking Mooselookmeguntik at 9:15. The trail crossed a dirt road after a quick mile. “MEATMAN” was pulling into a parking space there with a truck loaded down for trail magic. He was ready to cook bacon cheeseburgers all day. We were, unfortunately, too early for the burgers but we did snag some drinks and bananas as we helped him and his wife set up their wayside stand. We hiked on. 
We came across Journeyman shortly. We chatted for a minute and told of cheeseburgers ahead. Next was Tennessee Pickle. Then Blue. We realized we were about to see everyone we’ve been hiking with for the last 2 weeks. Scrambles & Catchup, Catch Up, Amelia Earhart, Sunshine, Jay & Tina, Clean Machine, Blaze Dog, Wick, and I’m sure several more that I’m forgetting. We stopped telling about the trail magic about 1:00 since MEATMAN was leaving at 5:00. 
Stretch and Lotus came across us as we were eating hot lunches on the trail. We had thrown down next to water and we’re relaxing for a short break. We did tell them about MEATMAN since they can really cover some ground but they were stopping short at nearby Beamis Mountain Shelter.
Old Blue was our last (and only major) climb of the day. Rain began to threaten just after lunch and seemed close to showers throughout the afternoon. 
We met Jay and Tina on the summit of Old Blue. We chatted about their recent misadventures. I called Hopper, who was back at The Cabin, to let her know we’d be at the road at 5:21. As I hung up, a load peal of thunder rolled in from the south. We cut the conversation short and went our separate ways!
It was the only thunder we heard. It never rained. We made the 2 miles down Old Blue and got to the road at 5:11. Hopper was waiting for us with icee pops. We ate all 12 of them!
Back at The Cabin, shepherds pie was on the table. We walked into dinner with little time to spare and ate heartily. Moose Tracks and brownies for dessert.
Showers and laundry have been nice. The meals here are fantastic. I’m looking forward to getting back into the woods!","South Arm Road

We’re told Travis won’t last - The Crockers and the Bigelowa are only a few days ahead. The 100 mile wilderness is no cake walk. But for now we’re enjoying this trail.We arrived at Piazza Rock Lean To with daylight left. “The Caves” are nearby and the boys and I went to explore.

It’s got another 200 before Katahdin. It is easy to take the continuity and length of this trail for granted. It’s difficult for the mind to comprehend 2194 miles. 

We rattled off another 11+ miles today over 3 stern peaks replete with steep ascents and descents. We pressed on past the shelter, despite the high chance of rain in the morning, and are camped on an abandoned (but surprisingly well-maintained) logging road next to a fresh cascade.
We arrived at 4:30 and have enjoyed the evening bathing, cooking & eating, and giggling. 
I kindled my first fire on the trail here - a small blaze that lasted only 20 minutes - mainly because I had the time.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655973,"We’ve had a fun week and are setting ourselves up for a good one ahead. The weather has been hot (in the 90s) and has threatened rain for the past several days. Tomorrow is the last day of heat before a front moves in bringing lots of rain and cooler temps (highs in the 60s). 


We spent last night at Crocker Cirque Campground. There were a dozen or more hikers around a campfire that Jasper and Baxter built: The trio of Gumby, Professor, & Neo (NOBOS we met way back at Stratton Pond Shelter); Stretch & Lotus (flip- floppers we met at a burger joint the day before Moosilauke), Leg (section hiker we met at The Cabin); Greta & Mom (SOBOS we met at the fire - check out “AT for Parkinson’s Disease”). The five of us added to the group made for fun (and loud!) conversation for an hour or two. 
We’ve spent two months building these acquaintances. Thru hikers are a tough community to get into for several reasons. The biggest is that the hiker and their community move 15 miles north every day. If you’re not ready to move along with them you’re not getting in. Also, thru hikers and long-distance section hikers require some “cred” from you before they’ll spend time chatting. Day hikers and weekend backpackers don’t carry much cred, and so, don’t get much thought from thru hikers. A family of 5 with kids in their teens is pretty far away from thru-hiker friend material. Knowing all that about the hiker community made last night all the more sweet. These “real hikers” see us not as “a family trying something impossible with kids”, but instead as “real hikers.”  
We woke up this morning after all these people and met South Crocker’s climb  straightway. A steep 1.3 mile pull for us to the top. North Crocker followed. We were on top of our day at 9:30. 
Stratton, ME was at the bottom of a 3.5 mile descent. We had a lot of options for the next several days.
The Crockers and the Bigelows are the last two peak groups before crossing the Kennebec River and entering northern Maine. The northern half of the state is generally lower and flatter than the southern half. Stratton sits between these two peak groups and is, therefore, a good place for resupply, hostels, and slackpacking operations (like private shuttle drivers). Far Out and AWOL are full of information and phone numbers. 
I’ll spare the stories of the deliberations on permutations of possibilities and tell the plan we’ve settled on.
We got to the road at about 11:30 along with Leg. He was headed to The Hosrel of Maine via shuttle. I’d packed two boxes of food and asked mom & dad to mail them to H.O.ME. We got into the shuttle when they arrived at 12:00 and rode to the hostel. We couldn’t stay the night - they were booked along with every other joint in town due to the mountain biker convention in town. We did spend 5 hours there eating lunch, resupplying, showering, laundrying, and planning. 
John shuttled us back to the trailhead at 5:00 where we set up camp (for free!) and ate dinner. 
Tomorrow John will pick us up at 7:30 and shuttle us north with several other hikers. We’ll slackpack the 15 miles over the Bigelows back to this trailhead where John will, again, take us back to the hostel. We’ll have a private room there tomorrow night. 
Monday rains all day. We’ll get a shuttle from H.O.ME to the Mountain View Motel and Campground where we’ll stay in the much-more-affordable but far-less-luxurious shed cabins and take a zero (I’m actually really looking forward to that. The MVM was a top choice for tonight but hiker bedtime come long before mountain biker party time is over.). 
Finally, we’ll get one last shuttle Tuesday morning back to the north end of the Bigelows and continue our March north. 
We plan to stay at Shaws Hostel in Monson about this same time next week. We’ll resupply there and make plans for the 100 mile wilderness. Then it’ll be 115 miles in 6 or 7 days to Katahdin. Maybe we’ll be there about August 20.


Grayson was hiking in front of me today, both of us in the back of the line. “I’ve always thought that if I could have a superpower it would be shapeshifting or something like that. But now I think I’d like to be able to conjure any food I wanted. What if I could conjure orange chicken right now!?”


Jasper woke up last night at 2:30am and walked alone 200 yards through the dark Maine woods. We were camping at Crocker Cirque which held the remnants of a glacial lake, now a buggy pond. “I wanted to see if there was a moose and, if not, just check out the stars.”","Crocker Cirque Campground
",ME 27,"Aug 06, Sat",7.40
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656367,"We slackpacked the Bigelows today. The Bigelows are the last of the 4000 foot peaks (until Katahdin) that started with Killington in Vermont.
The shuttle from our camping spot in the woods to the northern trailhead took almost an hour. In recent years the Native American tribe took back control of a road between Stratton and East Flagstaff. Depending on who’s telling the story, the road has been closed for different reasons. Whatever the cause, it changes the shuttle from a 20 minute ride into a 55 minute one! The price goes up accordingly!
Shawn was our shuttle driver. He was a local who moved away and then came back to the area several years ago. I was recounting my haircut story to Leg on the ride to the trailhead. 
“I thought I’d ask the lady at the General Store if there was a place in town I could get my hair cut.”
“See that green door across the street? Go see if she’s there. She doesn’t usually do walk-ins, though.”
“So I walked in and she sat me down and shaved my head. Fifteen minutes tops.”, I said to Leg.
“Adrianne cut your hair!?” Shawn asked. “I’ve know her for 20 years  I’ve called a half dozen times and left messages. She’s never called back. She’s never cut my hair!”
“I guess you should just walk in!”, I suggested. 


Because of the long distance, we didn’t get started hiking until 9:15. That’s a late start for a 16 mile day. Water was scarce (Maine is in a drought) and the climb to Little Bigelow started when we stepped into the woods. It wasn’t “steep” by our definition but it was a 2 mile climb.
Avery Peak (4049) was a bit less than halfway into our day. It’s peak is above tree line and has clear views to the horizon on all points of the compass. Flagstaff Lake was below us to the north. Route 27 and Carabassett Valley stretched out to the south hemmed in by the Crocker Peaks and Sugarloaf Mountain beyond. Moxie Bald, 55 trail miles north, stood proud. The mountains to the far north retreated into the haze. I spent several minutes trying to discern Katahdin in vain. 
Most of the hike between Mount Bigelow and the descent after The Horns was a high ridge walk through evergreen forest. Ferns and Mayflower grew among the thick moss on the ground while the canopy above filtered the sunlight through leaf and needle. The spruce and fir here, with the occasional paper birch, create a forest of fractals; trunks to limbs to branches, then twigs and needles. The sound gets combed out of the wind as it moves over the ridge. The forest here seems old, slow moving, yet ever-changing. It is a quiet forest and, despite my best efforts to tread through silently, I could not match the forest’s stillness. I felt clumsy, felt like an imposter.


————————-Perhaps I most fully realized that this was primeval, untamed, and forever untamable Nature, or whatever else men call it, while coming down this part of the mountain. We were passing over “Burnt Lands,” burnt by lightning, perchance, though they showed no recent marks of fire, hardly so much as a charred stump, but looked rather like a natural pasture for the moose and deer, exceedingly wild and desolate, with occasional strips of timber crossing them, and low poplars springing up, and patches of blueberries here and there. I found myself traversing them familiarly, like some pasture run to waste, or partially reclaimed by man; but when I reflected what man, what brother or sister or kinsman of our race made it and claimed it, I expected the proprietor to rise up and dispute my passage. It is difficult to conceive of a region uninhabited by man. We habitually presume his presence and influence everywhere. And yet we have not seen pure Nature, unless we have seen her thus vast, and drear, and drear and inhuman, though in the midst of cities. Nature was here something savage and awful, though beautiful. I looked with awe at the ground I trod on, to see what the Powers had made there, the form and fashion and material of their work. This was that Earth of which we have heard, made out of Chaos and Old Night. Here was no man’s garden, but the unhandselled globe. It was not lawn, nor pasture, nor mead, nor woodland, nor lea, nor arable, nor waste-land. It was the fresh and natural surface of the planet Earth, as it was made forever and ever,—to be the dwelling of man, we say,so Nature made it, and man may use it if he can. Man was not to be associated with it. It was Matter, vast, terrific,—not his Mother Earth that we have heard of, not for him to tread on, or be buried in,—no, it were being too familiar even to let his bones lie therethe home this of Necessity and Fate. There was there felt the presence of a force not bound to be kind to man. It was a place for heathenism and superstitious rites - to be inhabited by men nearer of kin to the rocks and to wild animals than we. We walked over it with a certain awe, stopping from time to time to pick the blueberries which grew there, and had a smart and spicy taste. Perchance where our wild pines stand, and leaves lie on their forest floor in Concord, there were once reapers, and husbandmen planted grain; but here not even the surface had been scarred by man, but it was a specimen of what God saw fit to make this world. What is it to be admitted to a museum, to see a myriad of particular things, compared with being shown some star’s surface, some hard matter in its home! I stand in awe of my body, this matter to which I am bound has become so strange to me. I fear not spirits, ghosts, of which I am one,—that my body might,—but I fear bodies, I tremble to meet them. What is this Titan that has possession of me? Talk of mysteries!—Think of our life in nature daily to be shown matter, to come in contact with it,—rocks, trees, wind on our cheeks! the solid earth! the actual world! the common sense! Contact! Contact! Who are we? where are we?


Excerpt from: ""The Maine Woods"" by Henry David Thoreau.———————————


We found our campsite from last night close to 7:30 as the day’s light was failing. Leg, who had been hiking around us all day, called to let me know he was about 15 minutes to the road. We waited on him before getting back on the shuttle and heading H.O.ME. 
We arrived at the hostel about 8:00. Three DiGiorno’s Pizzas were for dinner. We yogied some chocolate and cheesecake for dessert. Showers. And glorious, dark, mattressey, silky bed.","ME 27

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656344,"We needed an hour and forty minutes to leave camp this morning. Joni and I were both silently frustrated. In August, when the days are still long and we’re planning only 13 miles, it’s not really a big deal. But we’re both thinking about November when the days will get painfully short. It will take us about 12 hours to hike 20 miles on the trail home (hopefully!). Add breaking camp and pitching it in the other end and running out of daylight gets real. We’re behind schedule and know faster, bigger-mile days are ahead, but we’re skeptical we’ll be able to get the machine oiled enough to maximize daylight. We still have much to learn. 
Rain was in the forecast today and seemed to be imminent for most of the morning. The canopy dropped on our tents for the whole night last night. It had abated by the time we were rolling out at 6:00 but the threat of rain remained. 

We climbed Moxie Bald Mountain just before 3:00 and got to survey the weather situation for ourselves. The sun was out and breaking through a thick cloud ceiling high above. We had views nearly to the horizon in all directions. There was no rain within 40 miles of us and the clouds didn’t look ready for it anytime soon. We could retrace the day’s walk over Pleasant Pond Mountian, through 2 powerline right-of-ways, across the rock hop at the inlet of Moxie Pond, and could almost see where we had eaten lunch near Bald Mountain Brook Lean To. 

The Bigelows were 4 tall peaks 25 miles to our east southeast. The light and shadows wouldn’t allow them to be resolved into their separate contours but we knew which were which - Avery, Bigelow, and the South and North peaks of the Horns. 

Sixty miles to the north, not visible when we were on Avery Peak, but now unmistakable on the horizon, was Mount Katahdin. I was thrilled. No one else seemed struck by it. I know that it’s not our ultimate goal but that didn’t take much away from the feeling of awe I had. We’ve walked over 670 miles now and Katahdin, still 130 trail miles north, is in sight! 

A note on Moxie Bald Mountain: it seems that our apps and trail guides, along with perhaps some trail signage, has misnamed this mountain. We’re confused. There is a Moxie Pond nearby. The mountain is bald. But mapping apps call this mountain “Bald Mountain” with “Moxie Mountain” south and west of us. It seems there is a cartographical conundrum here. 

A short 2 miles downhill brought us to the shelter for the night. We arrived about 4:30. Great Dane is here along with some riff-raff (SOBOS?) and a couple from the shelter last night that we haven’t met. 

We’ve done all our chores for the morning in an effort to beat our abysmal performance this morning. Water is filtered, breakfast will be cold. 

Shoes News (why not?) 

Joni is in her second pair of Altra Olympus. Her first piar of 3.5s had afew 100 miles in them already. She spent several days in a pair of Topo Hydroventures but ditched those in favor of a gently used pair of Olympus 4s. She’s got a pair of Olympus 4s coming to the next mail drop. 

Darrell started in Altra Olympus 4s that had 200 miles on them already. While Grandie and Grandpa were nearby, he swapped between a pair of Topo Ultraventures and a new pair of (too big) Olympus 4s. The Presidentials shredded the bottoms of the Ultraventures. He’s now in Brooks Cascadia 16s that he bought at the North Conway REI. 

Jasper and Baxter started in a used pair of Altra Lone Peak 4s. They both needed the new pair Grandie and Grandpa brought along. 

Grayson started in a new pair of Hoka Speedgoat 4s. We bought him a new pair of 5s in North Conway because we could. The 4s still have some miles on them and will probably get back on the trail closer to home. 

The Dirt on Shirts 

Seven of our 10 shirts are wool, either Icebreaker or WoolX. They don’t stink at all. The trade off is that wool is expensive and doesn’t last as long as other tee shirt fabrics. 

Joni has 1 SS and 1 LS, both wool. 

Baxter has 2 SS. One got chewed up by a mouse at the ME 27 campsite the day before our Bigelow slackpack. He’s still got it and it’s wearable but it’s now his camp shirt. 

Darrell has a SS and a sun hoodie (thanks Karen!). The SS is threadbare in the shoulders after 73 days of daily wear. The shirt is 4 years old. A replacement has been ordered and awaits at the next mail drop! 

Grayson is same as Darrell. Both of his shirts are in great condition. 

Jasper has a SS camp shirt and a LS Columbia button up that he hikes in. He looks suave in it. It’s his second LS. His first was white until the end of the first week. It was also a size too small. G & G brought a new one with them. 

Socks 

Joni: Injinji over-calf compression socks. 

Darrell: Darn Tough 

Jasper: Darn Tough Tall 

Baxter: Ankle-High Injinji. We found these drying in a tree at TL logging road campsite the night before Crocker Cirque. We laundered them at H.O.ME and put them in rotation. 

Grayson: Injinji liners, compression sleeves (to ward off bug bites that get scratched and then infected), and Darn Toughs. 

All socks are color coded to the owner. Everyone has 2 pairs to hike in (rotated occasionally) and some have 1 pair to sleep in. 



The Tent Situation. 

We started the hike with a Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL 3 for Joni and Darrell and the same tent in 4-person version for the boys. Total weight: 10 pounds. The setup had served us well on 150+ miles of pre-trip hiking but quickly proved too heavy for daily carry. We sent the 3 man nor the in the mail from Williamston MA to Rutland VT. 

We spent about 2 weeks with just the 4 man tent. Total weight: 6 pounds. Way better in weight but also pretty crowded. We only had to spend 2 nights with a full house. The others were able to afford cowboy camping for some (usually Darrell) or there was shelter space for some (usually Darrell and Baxter). 

We ordered a ZPacks Triplex to be sent to Rutland VT. We swapped the 4 man Copper Spur for the 3 man and added in the Triplex. Total weight (with new CS ground cloth): 5.5 pounds. We’re pretty satisfied with this setup. The standard arrangement is: Joni & Darrell in the Triplex, boys in the CS. We mix it up pretty frequently to keep it fresh.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656301,"The trail had both sugar and spice today! It started spicy, less than 200 yards from camp. We packed up slowly to let the crowd who camped with us get on down the trail. We had the Kennebec to ferry across today and there was going to be a queue on the near shore. 

The AT fords Pierce Pond Creek less than 100 yards from the shelter. There are no rocks to be hopped. This is a true ford. Shoes will get wet. 

A sign nearer the shelter had an arrow to the left “Old AT High and Dry”, and one to the right “New AT Ford the River”. Easy choice, right? 

We soon discovered the reason for the reroute. The old AT crosses Pierce Pond Dam. “Dam” is a generous word. A grid work of log pilings across the wide mouth of the pond outlet had been filled with rock and gravel. Vertical wood plank slatting had been nailed to the pond-side of the dam to create a barrier. The whole structure, 3 to 4 feet tall and 80 feet or more across, was like a giant sieve that water was gushing through. Years ago, linoleum sheeting had been laid underwater on the pond side and against the slatting to improve the damminess. It only added to the mess. The old AT footpath apparently crossed the top of this structure. 

I understand now, after crossing that sketchiness, why the MATC chose a new path. We made it across with no issues but I wouldn’t want to be the guy who “okays” 4000 hikers crossing it this season. 

Bumblebeast, Rolo, and Leg spotted a moose within the first few miles. We missed it by a few minutes (or, more likely, it heard us coming and got lost fast). 

The Kennebec River splits the state of Maine in two, slicing south-southeast through the state and cutting the bottom third off from the north. The river is about 400 feet wide and gets waist-deep at normal flow. The ATC provides a free guided canoe ferry to hikers so the river doesn’t need to be forded - that would be a dicey undertaking. 

We crossed in 3 loads: Joni & Leg, Grayson and me, and then Jasper and Baxter. 

Three-tenths of a mile further brought us to trail magic! Pancakes, eggs, sausage, OJ, and sodas were enjoyed by all. 

We needed a lunch-and-breakfasts resupply. Caratunk is a community dating from the mid 1800s but had no services near the trail. We walked 1.4 miles east to The Sterling Inn for food and charging. We saw Great Dane and Fish there. Lunch on the porch. Then we got a shuttle back to the trailhead from the guys at the inn. 

Five miles later we pitched tents at Pleasant Pond Shelter. It was 3:30 but rain was threatening and we wanted to save the climb over Pleasant Pond Mountain for the morning. 

Grayson, Joni, and I walked down to the pond where we skipped some rocks and Grayson swam in a steady drizzle. 

Dinner was cooked back at the campsite under a hemlock canopy (relatively rain-free). We were all in tents by 7:00. It’s raining now, not hard but steady. It’s the kind of rain that seems ready to stay for awhile. 

I think today will be a memorable one. The Kennebec crossing is unique on the trail. The dam crossing is another, hopefully unique experience.","Pierce Pond Lean To

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656377,"Determined not to repeat the mistakes of yesterday morning, and knowing Monson was within a days walking distance, Joni and I got moving at 5:00am. The sun had not yet risen over Bald Mountian Pond when our packs were ready to go. The boys got going about 5:15 and, despite silent objections, we got walking by six o’clock. We ate our breakfast waking in the trail.
Monson was 17.9 miles from our campsite. The shuttles to town ran at 2, 4, and 6 o’clock. The profile was stunningly flat. Over the course of the first 12 miles the trail dropped only 600 feet! The morning walk today was along the East Fork of the Piscataquis River. 
Morning miles are the fastest and easiest. By 7:40 (the time we left camp yesterday) we had covered just over 4 miles. We all felt good to get some early miles behind us.

There were 2 true fords on the map today - the East and West forks of the Piscataquis. At the 6 mile mark we came to the first of them, or so we thought. We realized pretty quickly that the obstacle before is wasn’t a river but a beaver-dammed creek. The flood had created a 2-pronged crossing that was as much mud as it was water. We slogged in and out (nearly losing some Crocs to the mud) and checked the map. The East Fork ford was still three tenths ahead! We kept our river shoes on (for some, just regular shoes without socks or insoles) and walked to the riverbank ahead. This was a river for sure, 20 yards across with a fresh current and clear water. The legs of our shorts were wet when we reached the other side. We dried off and got our feet back into hiking gear.We repeated all this 5 miles later when we got to the West fork (sans mud). It was refreshing, both physically and mentally, to walk through the cool water.

We made the road (ME 15) at 3:10. Our longest day to date was in the books! I called Shaws to let them know we were there and we waited for Hippy Chick to show up with the van at 4:00. 
Shaws is a legendary hostel on the trail. It sits at the southern end of the 100-mile wilderness. It is the NOBOs last stop before Baxter State Park and Mount Katahdin. It is the SOBOs first introduction to civilization. There is history here. 
We arrived in the bustle of the afternoon. There were, perhaps, 40 hikers at the hostel showering, shuttling, returning from slackpacking, drying stuff out in the lawn, drying themselves out on the lawn, shopping the gear store, heading to town. It was a busy place. 
We got right after the chores: showers, laundry, gear explosion and pack clean up, charging, and the like. We’ll save the food resupply until tomorrow. 
At about 6:00 we walked to the nearby General Store with Great Dane to get deli sandwiches. The boys and I each got a quart of chocolate milk - divine. 

We all got back to the private room (number 6) after moves and chess for a good nights sleep. The famous Shaws breakfast is tomorrow. We’ll take a zero and get rested for the next 8 days of hiking to Baxter Peak!","Bald Mountain Pond Lean To

We’re close to Katahdin but the hundred mile wilderness is in the way so let’s shove that out of the way then climb Katahdin. Although we’re not done, the hardest parts are out of the way. In the wilderness there are lots of ponds and roots. 
About six miles in we hit the 700 hundred mile mark. We’re one third of the way through. 
We stop at Wilson Falls for lunch. About three miles after that there’s a large brook that we have to ford. After the brook we meet hodding who has followed Benedict Arnold’s steps through the Maine wilderness and he also followed Lewis and Clark’s path across the United States. In 1779 Benedict Arnold and 1,000 troops crossed the Maine Wilderness to Quebec and attack. Although the attack failed, Benedict Arnold is still told as a hero for his quest to Quebec, but overall he betrayed the American cause and was a friend of the British.

Some side notes: 
Grayson’s waist has slimmed down on the course of the hike and his hip belt no longer cinches tight around his waist. I spent some time at Shaws with a discarded foam sleeping mat and a roll of duct tape doing “surgery” on the belt to improve the cinch. Today, not 2 miles in, the fixit job failed. Grayson and Poet had tried in some packs during our zero day so I called back to Shaws and got a Hyperlite 2400 put into the food drop packout for tomorrow. 
“Cliff” is a generous word for the next story but I’m going to use it. “Very, very steep and smooth rock drop-off” is closer to the truth but tricky to type. 
Jasper stepped off a cliff today and was stopped by the mat of ferns that began to bunch up underneath his feet as he slid. The rock from which the fern mat had been peeled back from was now wet, slick rock. The cliff met the forest floor another 40 feet below. He kept his cool and was able to relax and stay composed. I was able to climb down in the dry parts and situate my sitting parts into a cleft and extend an arm down to him. I was able to pull him up to me. Hodding was up and behind me to help Jasper the last few steps to the top. Extra spicy. 
Jasper later scored us a sweet campsite by the river. I think it’ll turn out to be one of our best sites.","ME 17
",Long Pond Stream,"Aug 14, Sun",14.40
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656622,"Jasper found our campsite after fording the creek last night. It was next to the loud creek on a flat bench near an easily accessible swimming hole. It hit nearly all the bullet points on our “best campsites” criteria. I only recall one site better than this one on Bully Brook way back in Vermont. Zeta Pass can get an honorable mention. 
The night was cold next to the creek and I had neglected to commandeer down jackets from then boys before going to bed. I managed the early morning hours with my down jacket, bag liner, socks, and my rain poncho as a blanket. 
We crossed The Chairback peaks today: Fourth Peak, Three-and-a-half, Third, Columbus, and Chairback. The miles weren’t difficult and the day was pleasant. 
We me Hodding Carter on the trail yesterday. He’s hiking the 100 mile NOBO with no resupplys. He’s an interesting character for sure. He had a replica of Leif Erikson’s ship built and sailed it from Greenland to Nova Scotia. He retraced the path of the Corps of Doscovery up the Mississippi in an inflatable boat, then hiked over the Rockies to the Columbia River watershed on the western side to continue downstream to the site of Fort Clatsop. He commissioned a boat maker in Maine to recreate the “too-small and leaky” bateau boats used by Benedict Arnold in the failed Quebec campaign of 1775. Then paddled and portaged the boat up the Kennebec River and through Maine wilderness 350 miles to Quebec, retracing the I’ll fated expeditions path. 
Needless to say Hodding Carter has some cool stories. He regaled us much of the day as we hiked. The boys would ask about other adventures and the plausibility of retracing the route. We discussed John Wesley Powell, Roald Amundsen, Hannibal, Marco Polo, the Crusades, John Coulter, Ernest Shakleton’s walk across South Georgia Island, Dr Livingston, the Overmountain Boys, Hernando DeSoto, and the Kon Tiki trip. I wish I had mic’d everyone up and recorded the conversation. It would make a killer podcast. 
We pushed on past Chairback Gap Lean To since water was scarce there and came 2 miles further to East Chairback Pond. We are a bit off trail down a blue blaze. We have the whole basin to ourselves. The sunset behind us left a soft light on the trees 400 yards away on the far shore. The two loons on the pond did a paddle past us to check us out. I heard a moose clear his nostrils across the pond and we watched as he stepped out of the woods and enjoyed an evening soak in the pond until the light failed and he melted in with the shadows. Now the loons are singing their mournful night songs to one another. These Georgia folks mistook the first calls on Pierce Pond for a coyote howl. Unlike the coyote, the loon gets no answer except an occasional call back from her partner. It is not the “where are you all?” call of a coyote. It is, instead, a call that says to anything listening in the Maine woods, “I am here. This is my pond. You are no welcomed here but you will be tolerated for a night.” If she’s like the loon at Pierce Pond, she’ll remind us several times throughout the night.","Long Pond Stream
",East Chairback Pond,"Aug 15, Mon",14.30
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656545,"We left East Chairback Pond at 8:00 after sleeping hard until 7. It felt good to roll over and cover my face at 5:30 to sneak in another hour and a half of sleep. We had a short 2 miles downhill to Katahdin Ironworks Road where our first food drop was arriving at 9:30. 
The drop came off without a hitch. Cold Gatorades were in the truck - wow. This treat was followed by a passing car handing us 2 Granny Smith apples. It was, objectively, one of the best apples I’ve eaten. 

Grayson donned a new pack - a Hyperlite Southwest 2400. We emptied his Osprey Exos 48 and repacked. The Wxos went back to Shaws in the truck. Hopefully it can help another hiker. The Hyperlite proved to be a primo pack on day 1. It looks sharp and has a lot to like about it. 

We climbed a series of small hills before Whitecap Mountain today. We were shooting to get over the peak today to avoid the summit during a rainstorm tomorrow. We got our first true view of Katahdin today just over the summit of this final peak in the 100-mile. 

The north side of Whitecap drops into a broad, flat, forested valley dotted with lakes and ponds. The view sweeps from west to east with nothing in sight except forest, lakes, and mountains. There are no roads, power lines, towns, or buildings to be seen. No sign of man. It is wilderness every direction for as far as can be seen. 

Katahdin stood proud and massive as the westering light gave a depth and texture to it that it wouldn’t have in a noonday sun. Pamola Peak stood in the shadows off the eastern flank, connected to tall Baxter Peak by The Knife Edge. The Peak anchors the eastern edge of a descending ridge that ends on the tablelands at Thoreau Springs. The Abol Trail meets the high ridge here after it’s climb up the clearly visible Abol Rock slide on the south face. The Hunt Trail - used by AT NOBOS - continues it’s descent across the tablelands and down a steep southerly curving ridge, now clearly cut by the setting sunlight, before turning east into the tree line at The Gateway. All this was plainly visible thirty miles across the valley. 

Over the mountain hovered 4 clouds at the compass points like seraphim guarding the throne room. I’ve had this feeling, starting when we entered Maine and growing ever stronger, that we flip-floppers don’t belong here. Like the tabernacle of the Jews, this 100-mile wilderness is holy in its own way, reserved for the traveler who has earned the entry through asceticism and perseverance. Now, to look on the mountain, and to see the peak itself - the Holy of Holies - is awe inspiring, overwhelming, and humbling. But I cannot shake the feeling that we do not belong here. We are passing through. Our pilgrimage does not culminate at this place. The NOBOs I’ve said this too heartily agree with a laugh that says “Yep! We (NOBOs) think exactly what you’re saying about you flip-floppers. I’m impressed that you realize it.” 

I want to share with them that our pilgrimage is to a much better place. Our walk is not towards a cold, barren, and distant mountain but rather to the familiar, rolling hills of Georgia. To the Chattahoochee and the Nantahala Forests. To the headwaters of the Toccoa, the Etowah, and the Chestatee Rivers. To mountains that have been lived in and loved. Ours is a pilgrimage to our friends and to our family, to our cats, to our house, to our home. 

My boys will be able to visit our final destination on an afternoon. They’ll be able to take their friends and perhaps their kids to Springer Mountain, or to walk across Blood Mountain, Preachers Rock, Raven Cliffs Wilderness, and will tell the story of our adventure. Our drives to the friends and towns on the north side of the Blue Ridge will take us through Neel, Unicoi, Woody, and Dicks Creek Gaps - the final road crossings on our walk. We get to end our hike at home. 

I am still envious of the NOBO here, just 70 trail miles from the end. But I dare not share with them what ending awaits the five of us - I don’t want to diminish what I know they are feeling in these final days.","East Chairback Pond

I’m writing this entry a week late: Wednesday, August 24 after dinner. We are camped in Vermont about a half-mile north of Barnard Brook. 
The rain at Cooper Brook Shelter began to ease as the sun rose. It had rained for 14 hours or more. We all stayed mostly dry but the tents, ground-cloths, rain gear, and yesterday’s wet clothes were all now thoroughly wet. Grayson had to put wet shorts and briefs back in to start the day. 
Cooper Cteek was raging. Like a Best Buy crowd trying to get in the store on Black Friday, the water in the brook could not get downhill fast enough. It was mayhem. I knew that it was not unique among the brooks in the 100-mile. The wide valley we had seen from Whitecap was filled with brooks, ponds, and lakes and we had several creek fords in front of us. Any one of them, if too swollen, would stop us for the day. We would be forced to camp and wait in the water to find the lake. 
We were scheduled to meet Buddy for a second food drop at Jo Mary Road at 9:30. We were 4 trail miles from the road. We left camp a bit before 8:00. 
The going was slow. Morale was low and the trail was wet. Slick rocks held our attention. Several small rivulets now required each of us to stop and strategize our rock hop. Our feet were wet though the socks within three first mile. 
Buddy was at Jo Mary when we arrived at 9:35. He had a big Tupperware bin of food in the backseat. “You lift that out of there. I gave myself a hernia this morning getting it in there!”
We divvied up the food into bags while the rain threatened to douse us again. Joni had called Shawn’s and had a water bottle holder for Grayson’s pack strap added to the packout. We all got moving again close to 10:00.
The water crossings were so frequent we all gave up trying to keep our feet dry. 
Antlers lunch? P-shelter dinner?
The first of 2 dicey river crossings came after lunch. The brook, probably benign in normal times, had now become a two-pronged crossing with some deep and fast-moving water. Flowing water is a stunningly powerful force. Even if I could navigate the ford in thigh-deep water, no other member of our crew would be able to do it. Thankfully, Jasper seems to have an appreciation for the danger and was able to scout dozens of yards up- and down stream until he discovered a submerged rock hop. All the stepping stones were 6-inches or more beneath the water but made a way for all of us to navigate the freshet. 
The second ford, however, was a different story. I remember seeing it for the first time. We have video of my first reaction to it. I was amazed at what the rain had done to this unnamed stream. It was a torrent, 15 yards across, with submerged boulders downstream of the trail. A very large boulder in midstream, supporting several trees, split the flow into two forks that converged just upstream of the crossing. The blaze on the opposite bank was clearly visible and the path on each side showed where the crossing should be. There was no transition between the dry bank and the angry current; no eddy or shallow bench afforded a test-step. Figuring I should at least try the “standard” route I unclipped my hip belt (so I could ditch the pack if I fell) and stepped into the torrent with my right foot. It found the bottom about a foot down. I stepped in with my left foot and steadied myself. Another step out with my right foot went a bit deeper. The third step was the deal-breaker. I was quickly in well above my knees. I retreated to the bank.
We searched up and down the bank for a solution. We were fairly certain that several of our northbound comrades must have successfully crossed this today. There was nothing to be found. We returned to the trail. 
We finally gathered the nerve and found the solution at the large boulder. The near bank was separated from the boulder by a fast moving flow about 8-inches deep and 10 feet across. What had, at first, appeared to be a mass of sticks and debris underneath the flow turned out to be live, stable roots of the nearby trees. This flow was out of the banks. On a normal day, the 10 feet between the bank and the boulder would have been dry. I was able to use these roots as a “bridge” to get from the near bank to the boulder-island. The boulder was separated from the far bank by 20 feet. There water there was the true channel. It was deep, quiet, and fast. A tree trunk, fallen from the far bank and still anchored there by the root ball had it’s other end in the boulder. This was to be our bridge to the far bank. It was directly in the water, stable, with acceptable grip. We had crossed big bridges for the last 500 miles and often joked about lava or alligators or deep canyons underneath. “Could you cross this if there was a 400-foot drop underneath?”, we would joke. Now we got to find out! I made it across fairly easily with careful steps and by keeping my wits. 
I dropped my pack on the far bank and retraced my steps back across the stream. I took Joni’s pack and offers to shoulder Grayson’s as well but he wanted to keep his. I helped him across and dropped Joni’s pack to make another trip. Baxter and Joni were next - champs. Jasper came last and never hesitated. 
All’s well that ends well, I suppose, but I get a little squirmy watching that video. 
Joni found a sweet camping spot outside the trail corridor on the banks of Nahmakanta Lake just as we were pulling out headlamps to hike by. We were crossing the 20-mile mark for the first time this trip and needed all the day’s light to do it. We watched a campfire far across the lake as we set up camp just inside the trees. The loons were having their nightly dialogue as the lakes waves lapped the shore. We crawled onto wet tents but thankfully had dry sleeping bags to keep us cozy.","Cooper Brook Lean To

3:57, Saturday morning, august 20th, 2022


Brrrrrrring! The alarm broke the silence, sleep was now impossible, it was pitch black. Red lights illuminated the campsite as I roll over to my flashlight, I fumble around for a second and finally I turn the light on. Jasper close’s his eyes tight. 
“Red lights” he hissed then added a please after a second. I switch to red and sit up trying to get the last of warmth from my sleeping bag. Pillow, sleeping bag, pad, and electrical devices are removed from the tent In five minutes, the light is still very dim,
And we leave breakfast waiting for another hour. Once we pass the shelter we switched to white lights and start down the AT.  


1 hr 15 min after the shelter, we reach the golden road at 5:48, the end of the hundred mile wilderness. Abol bridge is half a mile down the golden road where we wait for a spot at the birches. The birches is a shelter at the base of Katahdin, twelve thru hikers are aloud to stay at it, it’s a first come first serve type of thing. After we get spots at the birches then we walk to the store and buy drinks and donuts. The hike to Katahdin stream campground was pretty uneventful but about halfway through me, dad and Baxter stopped at Daicey pond for an hour and use a canoe and swam. At KSC we set up tents and saw hey squirrel, Jay, Tina and tomato had finished yesterday and were leaving today. 
 Now the tent is bright the stream is quiet and we are discussing what the past in the last few days.

I’m sure if a Baxter State Park ranger was asked about the guiding principles of the park they’d have a better answer than mine. To me it seems like a “Wilderness first, people third” type of place. There are strict rules on the number and type of guests allowed into the park each day. Many drive to the park gates only to be turned away when the day’s guest quota is met. 
There is a daily quota on NOBO thru hikers, too. Twelve hikers per day are allowed to stay at The Birches Lean To. The Birches is near Katahdin Stream Campground and is for NOBOs only. It can only be reserved at a kiosk where the AT enters the park about a quarter-mile north of Abol Bridge on the Golden Road. A ranger arrives there at 7:00 in the morning and takes the names of the first 12 hikers. He radios those names to Katahdin Stream Campground and allows those hikers into the park. The others left off the list have limited options on getting into the park that day. Waiting for the next day’s signup is the worst-case scenario. 
We wanted to avoid that scenario! Ensuring our place on the list meant getting there early. We got ourselves within 4 miles of there kiosk last night. This morning’s job was to wake up as early as possible and cover those miles as quickly as possible. Hopefully the effort would pay off. At the worst, we’d be behind person 12 but would get to talk to the ranger face to face if we could be there at 7:00.
That’s how 4am found us packing up camp t is morning. We were underneath our packs and behind read headlamps by 4:35 headed north towards the kiosk. Jasper, Baxter, and I found an extra gear and fell into a 3.5 mph pace. Joni and Grayson were never too far behind. We each had a PopTart pack and a Big Texas Cinnamon Roll close at hand for breakfast. Twilight","Hurd Brook Lean To

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656819,"We finished Maine today on top of Mt Katahdin! After 8 days in the wilderness and 115 miles of trail I’m now laying in a bed wearing clean clothes after taking a hot shower and eating a large pizza. Glorious. The boys smashed it. Joni rocked it. 


We hiked Katahdin in 2018 with the Skogmooper crowd. Six adults set out from Katahdin Stream Campground (KSC) with 9 kids ages 2 - 14. Our boys were 7, 9, and 11 years old. That crew left KSC at 6 am. After several turned back on the 5-mile climb up, we summitted around 12:00. It took another 6 hours to get back down to the campground.


We were fairly certain that we could do it faster this time. We knew that Katahdin was difficult but also knew that we were in much better condition mentally and physically. We planned, in the days leading up to the hike, to leave KSC around 7:00 and meet the afternoon shuttle at 4:00. 


After arriving early at the campground yesterday and talking with Jay, Pocket Rocket, and Hey Squirrel who had all summited that same day, we decided to leave much earlier than 7am. All three said it was a difficult climb. They had left before 5:00 for their day. Ours would be a clear day, full sun with highs in the 80s and a 10-15 mph breeze from the southeast. We settled on a 5:30 leave time hoping to be at the summit before 10 and well down the mountain before the afternoon heat. 


We slept well and woke up to a campground doing the same. The light was just starting to give color to the forest. Several campers, including Great Dane, Hot Sauce, and Mark Trail were already passing our camp headed north. We packed up camp and stowed all but the days essentials in a lean-to near the ranger station reserved for that purpose. Coffee, oatmeal, and pop tarts were breakfast fare. We walked out of camp with nearly empty packs about 5:45 and started north. 


Katahdin Stream is as cold a creek as nearly any I’ve been in. The air temperature is a full 10 degrees cooler at its surface than it is 15 feet up the bank. It keeps the forest cool and fresh and helped the first mile roll off quickly. We started the 4000 foot climb almost immediately. We passed Katahdin Steam Falls and soon gained a view of the Owl and Barren Mountain to the west. The shadow of the former was creeping down the face of the latter as the sun rose. We passed the last water for the day at mile 2.2 and drank our fill before topping off and continuing upward. We gained the tree line in a jumbled maze of boulders. 


Most of the morning fun was recalling this hike from 2018. The boys remembered much of what was said or done at certain places. We talked about our friends and wondered what they were all up to in this Sunday morning. The sun finally caught the tops of our heads at 8:20. We were climbing a ridge headed northwest and there was no looking up towards the next blaze for 10 or 15 minutes; the sun was right in our eyes. We had views to the northwest of Barren Mountain and of the South- and North Brother peaks now rising behind The Owl. Distinctive Doubletop was to the west northwest. Some sleuthing with the map allowed us to pick Daicey Pond out of a group of 5 to the west. To the south we could see the 4 Chairback Peaks with Whitecap just in front of them. Moxie Bald Mountian, from which we got our first glimpse of Katahdin, was out there somewhere. The Bigelows, The Crockers, The Mahoosucs- they were beyond view. We have walked from beyond the horizon to get here. We gained the tablelands about 9:00. Thoreau writes this about his visit to this same place, a short 180 years ago:



The mountain seemed a vast aggregation of loose rocks, as if sometime it had rained rocks, and they lay as they fell on the mountain sides, nowhere fairly at rest, but leaning on each other, all rockingstones, with cavities between, but scarcely any soil or smoother shelf. They were the raw materials of a planet dropped from an unseen quarry, which the vast chemistry of nature would anon work up, or work down, into the smiling and verdant plains and valleys of the earth. From the point at which the trail gains the tablelands, the summit cairn can be seen 1.3 straight-line miles away. There is nothing between but these knee-high boulders everywhere.


We met Great Dane and Hot Sauce on their way down from the summit. I fist bumped Great Dane. With a grin he said, “I’m not Great Dane anymore. I’m Morten now, and I’m going home.” We said goodbyes for now knowing that we’d probably meet again waiting on shuttles at KSC. The Summit cairn and it’s accompanying sign are visible from a long ways off. We finally stood before them just before 10:00. Maine was finished! We took pictures and enjoyed the views of The Knife Edge to the east and Chimney Pond to the South, 2000 feet below us in the South Basin. The vast wilderness - true wilderness - of Baxter State Park stretched out 20 miles to the north and beyond into the “crown” of Maine.
Rolo and Bumblebeast finished their NOBO thru hike, started in February, while we were there. We gave them “the tunnel” welcome. Their raw reactions at finishing such a huge task were a reminder that we have a lot to experience and learn. “I nearly quit so many times! …so many times.”, said Rolo loudly, to no one in particular. 


We ate a strange combination of food for lunch: tuna, chicken, SPAM packets; leftover tortillas; Nutter Butters, Builder’s Bars, Great Value brand pulled pork packets (a widely-acknowledged delicacy on the trail this year), pop tarts, Pro Meal Bars, and Moon Pies. Water to drink. 


We left the summit close to 11:00 and headed back to Thoreau Spring on the tablelands. The Abol slide trail meets the AT here. We had decided to return to KSC by way of Abol as a change of scenery. Abol descends the same 4000 feet that the Hunt Trail does but uses 2 less miles to do it. It is an ancient rock slide that makes a natural path between valley and summit. It was brutally steep. The trail drops 1600 feet before the first mile - this far exceeds our “steep” definition. There is no easy way down from the summit but we were all pretty wiped out when we finally got back to tree line and out of the slide proper.



The trail meets the tire road after 2.3 miles. KSC is another 2 mile walk west on the road. We were hoping for a hitchhike that would save us the walk. We were on pace to arrive at 3:30 but we all had relaxation in mind before the shuttle ride to Millinocket. As Baxter and I approached the road, he noticed a familiar car parked across the street. “Buddy!”, he yelled to the now-familiar character (we met 3 times in the 100-mile while crossing roads). “Hello, friends!”, he smiled. He was here from Monson fetching some hikers off Abol Trail. When he heard that we hadn’t seen them on the trail and that we needed a ride to KSC he jumped at the chance to drive us. Grayson was more relieved than any of us. Katahdin Stream was still ice cold when Baxter and I laid down in it at 3:00. Joni and Grayson lounged in the shade. Jasper sat at a picnic table - a hiker luxury. We repacked all our gear at 3:45 just before Gail, from the 100-mile Wilderness Inn, arrived in the shuttle van. We all piled in and headed to Millinocket.


Gail let our family have the whole bunkhouse for the private room price - a very generous offer. She is a Maine-ah from her roots. Her father was the district ranger at Baxter State Park. She grew up in the ranger cabin at Katahdin Stream Campground where she met us. “There are trees on that forest I’ve known longer than any of my friends.”


We finalized plans to get to Lebanon NH tomorrow, showered, laundry-ed, talked with the grandparents, and then walked into town to Angelo’s Pizza. Now we’re all in bunks reading and looking forward to rolling over in the morning and going back to sleep!

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657048,"Gail agreed to drive us to Medway this morning at 8:30. We all woke up slowly around 7:00 and enjoyed lounging in bed. When I looked over at Grayson just before 7 he had his headlamp on reading a book he found in the bunk room. 
We found the kitchen in the house and quietly fixed coffee, oatmeal, cereal, and toasted the pop tarts. Repacking packs and turning over the beds in the bunk room took the rest of our morning. 
Gail dropped us off at a convenience store around 9:15. The bus to Bangor makes a stop at the store at 10:00. We bought tickets, Sour Patch Kids, and chocolate milk and waited in the shade. The AT Lodge shuttle arrives at 9:45 with Great Dane, Hot Sauce, and Governor. We loaded the bus upon arrival and rode the 45 minutes to Bangor. I rode with Governor who was flying back to San Francisco today.
We were dropped off at a bus station near the airport. We said our final goodbyes to Great Dane and Hot Sauce. Joni, Jasper, and Grayson stayed in the shade at the bus station while Baxter and I walked about a mile to the airport with Governor. We rented a Subaru Ascent SUV from a nice lady at the Avis counter and drove back over to pick up the other 3. 
Lunch was Chick-Fil-A. REAL sweet tea was a treat. 
Our destination was Dan and Whit’s General Store in Norwich, VT. It was a six-hour drive that we all enjoyed. My legs needed more action than sitting around but the rest of my body appreciated the break. 
After wrestling with the rental car arrangement - drop off, pickup, timing, locations - we settled on hiking our Vermont gap southbound. Joni spent a big chunk of the drive working to get us from Rutland (on the south side of the gap) to High Point. We finally hired a shuttle driver to meet us at VT Route 4 on Saturday morning. 
We arrived in West Lebanon, NH about dinner time. After an Indian Restaurant was unexpectedly closed, we landed at Wendy’s. Baconators and Frostees all around! We resupplied at Hannafords and headed to the Super 8 motel. We exploded gear and food resupply in the hotel room and began to repack packs while some took showers.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657091,"I soaked my feet in Stoney Brook tonight after dinner and camp chores. They were remarkably dirty for having been in shoes for the past several days. Vermont’s deciduous trees drop their leaves into the trail where innumerably many hikers passing by quickly work them into a soft, dusty duff. That dust works it’s way into shoe and sock and, given a day a two left alone, binds fast to the toes and heel. New Hampshire and Maine don’t give these problems (what with all the ROCKS EVERYWHERE). 
Joni and I had a “numbers” talk in the tent last night and decided to have a family conclave around the fire ring tonight (sans fire) to discuss our findings. Today is day 87 since May 31. There are also 87 hiking days until Thanksgiving (we left out tomorrow and Saturday for easier calculations). We have spent half of our time already. Unfortunately, we are still a ways off from the mileage halfway point. We have, so far, walked 843 miles in our 87 days. That’s an average pace of 9.7 miles per day. To cover the 1350 miles on the southern leg of our journey we’ll need to average 15.5 miles per day.
That seems a little daunting to us. So we made a plan.
1. Cut Weight. I found 2 pounds of “extra” gear in my pack that I displayed for the boys. We’ve all got to examine our kit and try to decide what can go. Light Packs equal More Miles. 
2. Seventeen. That’s how many miles we need to average per day if there are to be zeros or neros. (It should actually be more like 18). 
3. 12 before 12. This hiker philosophy, which I first heard about from my mom, is about getting 12 miles in before noon. The boys seem to have bought in. Early wake up and no stops are the key. Walking at 6:00 leaves plenty of time to hit the goal. 
4. Neros not Zeros. Keep the streak going! Can we do 9 days before a Zero? 15? 24? Let’s try! The body does need a zero occasionally to get stronger and repair but a zero on the trail is one more December day that we’ll be in the woods. We’d like to keep moving and try the occasional 5 miles day instead of a 0 mile day. 
The boys seemed excited about all this. They bought in. Joni is relieved that we have a plan. Baxter and Joni will love that we’re ALL getting up early. Grayson suggested trying five 20-mile days right out of the gates at High Point. Maybe we will!
We’re going to make some gear changes to cut more weight. We’re going to trade Grayson’s sleeping bag for a quilt. This will save him almost a pound of pack weight. We’re also going to trade the Copper Spur tent for a 2-person trekking pole tent like the Triplex. That will save 2.5 pounds. We may take on equal amounts of weight in winter gear soon (sleeves, pants, fleece, hat, gloves) but at least we’ll be adding it to packs we’ve made lighter!
Today was pleasant but unremarkable. The 15 miles we did rolled off easily. We’re camped next to Stoney Brook with a hill or two between us and Killington VT. We’d like to take showers at the state park tomorrow so we’re not too smelly for the shuttle ride to NJ on Saturday. 
We’re loving this Vermont trail!","Stream Before Bernard Brook
",Stoney Brook,"Aug 25, Thu",15.90
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657097,"We woke to rain this morning. It had been spitting on and off all night and rained steadily for about an hour before sunrise. Joni and I packed up everything inside our tent. I donned a poncho to get breakwater started as the rain began to abate. By the time the water had boiled, the rain had all but stopped.
We had a hot breakfast by Stoney Brook as we packed up camp slowly. We planned on doing only another 10 miles today with a stop at the state park to take showers. We got rolling about 7:45 and had gotten within a mile of the park when we got cell service again. Thunderstorms at 11:30 was the report. We could see them coming on the radar. We had about a half hour to get to the park before the rain came again. We hoofed it across a boardwalk laden with day hikers, past Thundering Falls, around the south edge of Kent Pond (where we stopped to admire a beautiful blue dory afloat on the water), and under the park pavilion just before deluge. 
We got covered up by some red dots on the radar. Heavy rain lasted only 10 minutes while less serious stuff continues for another half hour. We were glad to have made it to a roof! We snacked and rehydrated at the water spigot and I decided I’d walk to the nearby deli for lunch. I removed my dry socks, donned a poncho, and opened an umbrella. The deli was seven-tenths of a mile away and I covered the distance in 20 minutes. I bagged some sandwiches, salsa, chips, and a broccoli salad, ate a banana, and headed back to the park. Joni was in e shower when I arrived so the boys and I laid into the sandwiches and set her portion aside. 
As the rain continued we started to think we might rather just stay at the state park and walk the 3 miles to Route 4 in the morning. Hudson, our shuttle driver to New Jersey, would meet us there at 9:00 in the morning. “We’ve got a lean-to that’s still not raked,” the park ranger told me. 
“A lean-to?”, I asked, thinking it was too good to be true. 
“Yeah.” He chuckled. “Three sides. A roof.” He mimed it all with his hands. 
“Yes! I think we’d like to sleep in that tonight!” 
So we rented the lean to for the evening. We moved in about 2:30 and took full advantage of the nearby coin operated showers.
The boys lounged at the lean to and played Polytopia, Join sat at the pavilion and charged her phone, uploaded video, studied New Jersey Trail. I decided to walk back to “town” and check out the gear store.
On my way to Killington, still only 0.7 miles away, I called a friend and caught up on news from home. The gear store was mainly ski and bike. The camping section wasn’t aimed at the Thru hiker. I crossed the street and found a pair of Darn Tough socks to replace the pair that ripped yesterday as I was walking (the stick I kicked with my right foot left a gash on my left ankle and a hole in the sock). Then I walked back to the deli and bought a half gallon of chocolate milk to take back. I ate another banana.
Back at the park nothing had changed. We heated water for dinner and let everyone do their own thing: freeze dried, clif bars, leftover sandwiches, grits and bacon bits.
Hikers started “sneaking” into the park after dark and claiming the empty camping spaces. I’m fairly sure I heard some approach out lean to after 9:00 only to stealthily slip away when they discovers it was occupied. I imagine the park knows about this shenaniganary and chooses to overlook it. The trail goes right through the campground at the park. 
The rain returned softly after 8:30 to “shush” us to sleep. It’s good to be dry in the rain.","Stoney Brook
",Gifford Woods State Park,"Aug 26, Fri",7.30
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657307,"We got moving around 6:30 this morning. We were 3 miles from our pickup spot in Route 4 and had to be there at 9:30. We slowly packed stuff and ate breakfast, enjoying the shelter and the picnic table. 
All of the hikers that were stealth camping in the campground were long gone by the time we started walking at 8:00. 
Not far down the trail we met Obie Wan who was camped on the flat next to the trail. We had first met him in Maine just before our climb up to Crocker Cirque. Grayson, Leg, and I had stopped at the river to cook off. Obie Wan came along as Grayson and I were sitting in the cold current. It was fun to see him again. We told him we were leaving Vermont for parts south at 9:30. Maybe we’ll meet again.  
Hudson arrived at the trailhead parking area on Route 4 at 9:15 just after we walked up. Our first shuttle driver was forced to cancel. I called Hudson only 3 days before we needed him. “That’s going to be an expensive shuttle!”, he texted in reply to my inquiry. “You ought to look at some other options.” We had looked deep into other options! After some text ping-pong he agreed to do it. 
Hudson lives near Falls Village, CT. He’s hiked the trail twice, had loads of adventure stores from Alaska, and is a guy that tells it like it is. He mentors groups of hikers like us at his house-turned-hostel near the trail. We didn’t get to visit his house but he did offer some good advice and perspective about our hike as we drove. He put our minds at peace a bit about the task and the timeline before us. 
We chose Dunkin Donuts for a “second breakfast” stop. Picnic Pizza was our lunch - maybe the best we’ve had on our adventure (rivaled only by the pizza in Greenwood Lakes on our 4th night out). 
Hudson got us to Mosey’s Place in Port Jervis about 2:30. He’d been in the car for 8 hours and had another two-and-a-half to get back home. We shook hands with him and thanked him as we unloaded gear into the driveway. Thank you, Hudson!
We turned from one trail character, now, to face another - Mosey.
Mosey is a retired mail carrier who has also thru-hiked the trail. Her eyes and smile are energetic and youthful while her face, worn by 25 years of walking her mail route, exudes wisdom and comfort. She is the quintessential storybook mail carrier just as Tom Levardi is the grocer - Richard Scary’s “Busytown” come to life. 
Mosey invited us in and showed us around her home. We shared the 6-bed bunk room with Gwen, who is coming close to completing the AT in sections. 
Baxter and Grayson both had packages waiting for them. Baxter had ordered himself a Kindle e-reader. Grayson had a new watch in his envelope. 
Grayson started the hike with a Garmin Vivofit Jr watch. He’s certain he lost it at Green Mountain Hiker Hostel the day we met Josh Bennett there. Grayson is the “are we there yet” kid. I realized that he doesn’t really mind the miles, but the time it takes us is important for him to know. With a watch and a knowledge of our pace, he can tell pretty well how far we’ve been and how much more trail we have to go. I, myself, far prefer this method to the phone apps and guidebooks. The latter are good for beginning- and end-of-day review. I enjoy putting them away while I hike and take the day in long chunks of trail.  
We lounged around Mosey’s house for the afternoon reading, chore-ing, and resting. Jasper has a lingering infection on his big toe we were able to soak. It seems to be on the mend. We ordered Chinese delivery with Gwen and ate around the large dining room table. 
I got in the car with Mosey about 7:30 and we headed to Walmart for resupply. What a joy, Walmart. An American phenomenon. EVERYTHING you need under one roof. FAMILY SIZE packaging! We needed minimal resupply for the days ahead because of the many restaurant-stops along the next 60 miles of trail. I did buy 100+ snack bars in 3 boxes. You can’t do that in Maine!
Packs are packed and beds are full. Breakfast is served tomorrow at 6:30. We’ll be back at High Point State Park tomorrow before 8:00.","Gifford Woods State Park
",Mosey’s Place,"Aug 27, Sat",0
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657351,"Mosey drove us to High Point SP Headquarters in 2 loads starting at 7:00. 
The headquarters building sits on the south side of a large field. The field is bisected by the east-west road with a small pond between the road and the building. The Appalachian Trail runs across the road headed north away from the building and south to its rear. I’ve had an image of this large field many times in our trip. I’ve seen it like a room with 4 doors. We’ve entered this “room” through the western door - by car - both times we’ve been here. In May, we waved goodbye to Joni’s parents and stepped through the northern door. The last 90 days have been an exploration of what lies behind it- rock, tree, stream for starters. But also places that will live in our memories: the Warwick Drive In, Harriman State Park, the terrible road crossing at Bear Mountain Bridge, the Stairway to Heaven rainstorm, friends in Milford, Sages Ravine, friends in Great Barrington, injury, Williamston, Clarendon Gorge, Spineless Cougar’s trail magic, Grandie & Grandpa, the White Mountains, the Notch Hostel, Gorham Bar-B-Que, southern Maine mountains, The Cabin, The Flagstaff General Store, The Kennebec, Shaw’s, the 100-mile wilderness, Herd Brook Shelter at 4:30am, Baxter State Park, summit day. 
There are also people we’ve met that have made being out here new everyday: Lightyear & Margaritaville, The Nomads, Around the Corner & Grasshopper, shuttle driver Joe, Tom Lavardi, Great Dane, Tin Man, Bennington Steve, Trash, Professor, Gumby, Neo, Leg, Honey, Stretch & Lotus, Coastie, Jay & Tina, Poet & Hippie Chick, Hodding, Hudson, Mosey. 
If the lists seem long know that they are far from exhaustive. 
As we shouldered our packs I pointed out the southern “door” to Joni & the Boys. “More adventure and people than we met that way,” I said pointing north, “awaits us that way.” Southbound. Homeward Bound.” We stepped into the woods with strong legs and light spirits. 
Somewhere in Connecticut mid-June we met Poison, Ivy, and Firecracker on the trail. They were finishing their 7-year section hike this summer. They offered to help us when we got to their piece of the trail near Wind Gap, PA. Poison and Joni traded numbers. Just this week we made plans with them to stay at their house on Tuesday. Wind Gap is 60 miles south of High Point. Tuesday is 3 days away. Pickup time is to be 3:30 on Tuesday. So we’ve got our work cut out for us! As we stepped into the woods we had a 20+ mile day on our minds. 
Now that we’re back in New Jersey we’re back to the delis and restaurants! We’ve got plans to eat 4 meals at places close to the trail. We’re able to light our pack significantly when 4 meals get left out! We planned to pass The Mountain House Inn and Tavern about 3:00 and eat an early dinner today. 
We ate lunch at Sunrise Mountain pavilion. It’s trail-side pillar was full of yellow jackets. Thankfully ,Grayson’s sharp eye picked them out before anyone walked into the cloud.  
The Mountain House Tavern was excellent. Burgers all around except Baxter, who had seafood cakes. We ordered a piece of peanut butter pie for an appetizer. We drank all the lemonade they had. 
Water on this long section of trail is dangerously scarce. We filled bottles at High Point and had our first on-trail water at the restaurant 15-miles away. The trail through the next 200 miles is like this, crossing a high, dry ridge with more wind gaps than water gaps. Keeping an ye on the next water is crucial. 
Late in the day, about mile 20, we got a view north back to High Point State Park. The high point itself is marked by an 80-foot tall obelisk, easily visible on the high hill behind us. Twenty miles is a long way!
We found a camping spot in the woods that we made our home for the night. Someone had lost their car key there. 
I employed the PCT hang tonight for the first time in months. We’re back in active bear country. 
D we lay in our tent the night insects are booming in the forest around us. It sounds like home in the summer. The northern states have none of these sounds. The woods there are stunningly quiet at night, far from the sounds of a Georgia forest. It’s good to hear their raucous serenade. We are headed towards home, indeed.","High Point State Park
",Woods at SOBO Mile 875.2,"Aug 28, Sun",20.70
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657404,"We met the sunrise on our feet bombing down a fast trail, wide and soft to quieter our footsteps. Baxter and I were in front with eyes peeled for bear, deer, turkey, and the like. We did manage to spy 2 groups of deer as they bounded away from our approach. 
Crater Lake was our first stop, about 3 miles in, for water. It was six-tenths of a mile off trail. That distance is usually an easy one to “pass” on for a Thru hiker but the water was the last for ten more miles. We filled all our bottles and continued southbound. 
Mohican Outdoor Center was our lunch goal. They have a deli and a gear store that we planned on stopping at. MOC was to be our first night’s stop on our hike before “aggressive” bear reports prompted us to change our start point to a more northerly locale. Granddaddy & Gigi had sent money for lunch so a stop at MIC was a sure bet. 
We got in our 12 miles before 12:00 and enjoyed sandwiches and drinks in the air conditioned great room at the center. 
We drank our fill and topped off our water bottles. The afternoon was very hot and humid. We were walking a long ridge (and will continue to die the next 100 miles). The crest alternated between sun and shade and left us all hot and sweaty. We were walking south with the Delaware River on our right flowing south with us, searching for a way through the ridge we were in to continue its run to the ocean. 
The Water Gap is where the river finds its way through. The ridge, unbroken for more than 90 miles to the north, drops here into the gap to allow the river to pass. Man has co-opted this pass for his rail line and interstate right-of-way. It was the interstate bridge that was to be our river crossing. 
The road walk to the bridge and across it proved hotter than the ridge had been. Interstate traffic beside us (separated by a concrete wall) and river boaters below us kept our attention for the two miles on pavement. We left New Jersey on the bridge and stepped into Pennsylvania. State number 8!
Our first stop in PA was Zoe’s Ice Cream Emporium. Then on to Marty’s yard, a local that allows free tenting in his yard. We dropped packs and the boys and I went to explore the Village Bakery. 
Baxter developed a bad heat rash that his pack cages today. Marty graciously let him shower to cool the rash off. Figuring out the solution will be a necessity these next few days - the heat shows no signs of abating. Baxter can’t carry his pack if the chafing continues. We all have our minor aches: swollen toe, small blisters, sore muscles. Two 20 mile days have taken their toll. We’ll hopefully be able to adapt and keep cranking out some miles! 
We’re all in tents in the grass in Marty’s backyard. The grass is comfortable. The cricket chorus has begun.","Woods at SOBO Mile 875.2
",Delaware Water Gap,"Aug 29, Mon",22.10
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657478,"The night was hot and humid. We woke to the sounds of the “heat insects” singing their morning songs. 
We ate bagels and cream cheese on Marty’s front step while the twilight broke around us. Then we set out to climb out of the water gap. 
We hit the 900 mile mark just after gaining the ridge again. Our “hundred mile” checkpoints have all been in odd places because we started at an odd mileage post (1349). We realized, after we flipped back to NJ, that mileages we’re so much easier now - our mileage from Katahdin and mileage to Springer are both in all our guidebooks and apps. We did not anticipate the hundred-mile checkpoints also lining up. Joni and Jasper walked up on a pre-made “900” on the r side of the trail - 900 miles from Katahdin. We’ve made the other 8 markers for the 800 miles behind us. 
As we stood at the 900 mile marker we met some SOBOs coming up the hill behind us. Apparently we’ve stepped into the middle of a little southbound “bubble” of hikers. They told us that there were about a dozen hikers at the church hostel last night. It’s fun to know we may be meeting some new folks. 
Both Baxter and Grayson began chasing again today. Baxter’s back is bad and Grayson’s is threatening the same. I took everything out of Baxter’s pack and moved it into mine. We pit snacks and water into a daypack and he slung it over his shoulder. I rolled his pack up and stowed it atop my own pack. We walked that way for 15 miles today to give his back time to heal. I took some weight out of Grayson’s pack, too and divided it between Joni and Jasper to help minimize his chafing. We’ll see if that works. It’s not a permanent solution  but it will get us to Wind Gap where we can look into different shirts or some other remedy. Hopefully the heat will back off a bit. 
We walked through lunch to get in 15 miles by 2:30. Cindy met us at the trailhead at 3:00 and we all loaded up into her F150. Cindy is a school nurse at the local high school so she got to hear about all our maladies on the ride to her house. When we got there she took a look. Baxter and Grayson’s chafing looked minor to her. She made some suggestions and then went on to Jasper’s toe.
“A doctor needs to look at this,” she said right away. I’m surprised he can walk on it. It has been bothering Jasper just a bit but has not been painful. 
Jasper and I loaded up in Cindy’s truck (she offered it to us for the whole evening). We drove to the urgent care where they prescribed antibiotics and told us to keep a close eye on it. 
We drove to the grocery store to resupply, got a haircut, and filled the prescription. 
When we got back to Cindy’s place we enjoyed taco salads and ice cream for dinner. Cindy, Mike, and Quay had gone to a gender reveal party all evening so the house was all ours. Baxter had been reading while Jasper and I were gone. Grayson watched Rogue One. Joni supervised laundry and edited video. 
We laid down in real beds with air conditioning! Quay will take us to the trail in her way to school in the morning. We’ll be up early at 5:30am. What great hiker hospitality! Thanks Cindy, Mike, & Quay!","Delaware Water Gap
",Wind Gap,"Aug 30, Tue",15.60
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657479,"The climb out of Wind Gap this morning was surprisingly cool and breezy. Broken fog hung in them trees as the rising sun’s beams began to pierce though to the forest floor. We had another long day on our minds - hopefully past Lehigh Gap, 21 miles ahead. The water is scarce but we continue to get good info on where the reliable springs and creeks are.
As we left the gap I decided to tape up the chafing spots on Baxter and Grayson’s backs. I had waffled on the best course of action but finally decided to protect at the risk of holding heat in. We cut up KT Tape and patched up the red spots. Baxter looked like a well-loved stuffed animal when I was finished. 
We hiked hard until 11:00. It was an early stop but the trail was rocky and not particularly exciting. We threw down trail side and broke out the bagels, cheese, & jerky - this has become a trail lunch favorite. 
We met Sandworm as we packed up and walked off. He had first met us in the Whites on the NOBO leg and here we were again. His pace is faster but I suspect we’ll see more of him. 
The trail has continued down Blue Mountain, a long ridge, for the last 30 miles. Blue Mountain Ski Resort  would be on our west-hand this afternoon. We cut though the woods and found the lift. We followed the ski signs to the “Summit House” where we heard we could refill bottles and perhaps score some ice cream. 
We were able to do both! Some of the staff approached me and asked, “can we help you.” The tone and posture meant “you shouldn’t be here. Can we help you on your way?”  
“We’ve walked from Maine on the AT to get some ice cream from here. Can you help?” They we’re excited to hear our story and opened the gift shop up so we could raid the freezer. Forty dollars later we were all double-fisting ice cream treats. 
We filled water bottles from the cold water fountain and walked the resort road back out to the trail. Baxter lost a water bottle (while rolling around in the grass) and realized it when we got to the bottom of the driveway. He walked back up and was able to find it. 
Blue Mountain was e sore if a Zinc mining operation for nearly 100 years. It’s been defunct for the past 40 and the mountain is struggling to return to forest. The rocks here were loose and unnatural and the forest was very young and sparse. In places there were huge piles of stacked rock all the same size and shape as crushed cars. This unstable rock and unsettled nature went in for 4 miles or more before we got to the infamous Lehigh Gap descent. 
This three-quarter mile section of trail gets a lot of hype. Many people adamantly suggest skipping it using the “winter bypass” trail. I’ve heard of two hikes that ended in injury here and a torn Achilles. No one has had anything good to say about it until we met a ridge runner today. “I think it’s kind of fun,” she said, when I asked her about it. “You guys have done Katahdin and the Whites. You’ll be fine.”
And while the descent wasn’t “fun” exactly, it wasn’t too bad either. We made it down into the gap in 30 minutes with no injury. I’m glad we weren’t going up. 
We stopped in the parking lot and cooked mashed potatoes for dinner. Then crossed the road, crossed the bridge over the Lehigh River, and headed to the shelter a half mile uphill. 
We filled up all our bottles at the spring just before the shelter. We could hear a crowd up there. I went to find out if there was tenting and found out about some empty tent sites 100 yards south. I yelled the rest of the group up and headed on to scout it out. 
We found our spot, did all the evening chores, and were able to soak Jasper’s toe. Brothers’ backs did well with the tape on them. We left it on - it’ll last for days. The night is warm and not cooling off much. Our tents are in grass and make the CCF pad extra comfy!","Wind Gap
",George W Outerbridge Shelter,"Aug 31, Wed",21.50
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657480,"I woke up early in the morning, maybe around 2:00. I laid there for a bit trying to decide what had awakened me. A boy? An animal? A night hiker? I heard nothing. As I laid there, it was my mind that spoke to me. “The Chili Mac, you fool!” 
At our Lehigh Gap dinner spot last night I had added some freeze dried Chili Mac to my mug before the mashed potatoes, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese. The chili Mac had joined us back in the 100-mile wilderness at one of the food drops. I had opened it at Katahdin Stream campground and eaten half of it. I carefully rewrapped the remaining freeze dried portion and sealed it in a ziplock bag (double bagged!).  Ten days later (twelve?) I poured a half cup into my dinner mug and ate it with relish. Big mistake. 
Freeze dried food will last a century or more when sealed properly. The companies themselves pit 50-year expiration dates on them. But after the seal is broken tree food is only good for a day or maybe two. Certainly not 10. I knew all this. 
So I knew. At 2:30 am, that September first might shape up to be a tough day for me. I didn’t yet feel sick at all but I knew, without a doubt, that my body was about to fight a fight. 
We woke at 5:30 and started packing up camp. I still felt fine. Breakfast was oatmeal, breakfast essentials, and coffee. I started a pack of oatmeal but couldn’t finish it. My body didn’t want food. 
We got moving about 6:45 and climbed back up into the ridge. The sun was behind us as we climbed and the views to the southwest were expansive. The Lehigh River was winding it’s way towards the gap while the roads, rail lines, and power lines converged towards the same destination. Pennsylvania was waking up. 
We continued an easy hike along the ridge. As we walked I started to feel weaker and more lethargic. I stopped for water as everyone passed and asked Jasper to hang back with me. “If I pass out just splash some water on my face.” 
“What!?”
“I feel terrible.”
We cranked out 5 miles before getting to a gravel road. 
“I’ve got to lay down,” I told Joni. 
I got out my Switchback and laid down at a campsite. As I got the chills I put on my puffy and Joni’s quilt. She gave me a pill of activated charcoal. I fell asleep for 2 hours. 
I woke up feeling a little better. My body had shivered it out. I never got explosive but I was still very tired. I drank a quart of water, took another pill, and fell asleep for another hour. 
“We really enjoyed that three hour break,” Jasper said later. Brothers agreed. I was able to eat a snack and start walking again about 1:00. 
The next 8 miles we’re rocky and unremarkable. I was tired but could push on. The boys and Joni were fresh after the long rest. 
We made it to Thunderhead Lodge and Tavern about 5:00. We put packs on the deck out back in view of our indoor table. Everyone ordered a cheeseburger except Baxter, who ordered a bowl of Macaroni and cheese. Lemonade all around. I ate half of my burger and all of my fries. I was past the worst of the sick. 
We shouldered packs after dinner, refilled bottles at the spigot out back and hit the trail again. 
Three tenths of a mile later I found a site for two tents. We threw down, pitched tents, hung beat bags and settled in for some sleep.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657576,"I was up at 5:30 feeling much better than to is time yesterday. Baxter is always first to get packed for the day. Everyone else seems to be waiting on everyone else. Despite leaving at 6:30 (later than ideal) we blazed though the morning miles. The day was cool and the trail was still flat. The rocks come and go. 
Eckville Shelter was our lunch destination. We wouldn’t be able to get in 12 miles before then but 11.5 is good enough. Eckville is a property owned by the local hiking club. A caretaker lives on site. There is running water, charging, flush toilet and solar showers. We made it to the shelter about 11:30. 
Just before we got there we came across a hornets nest hanging in a tree directly over the trail about 6 feet high. It was the size of a football. As I stood I could look directly into the entrance hole. It had been flagged with orange tape and had a trail skirting around to the west side of the trail. Baxter warned Jasper about it and went on ahead. Jasper stayed to warm me, then, he too headed south. I waited on Joni and Grayson. It was a longer-than-normal wait. I found out at lunch that Grayson had taken the butt end of a sawn off tree trunk to the face as he walked down the trail. He’s got some cuts to show for it. 
After Grayson and Joni passed I set to work on the hornets nest. It bothered me that it had men in this tree on the trail for so long. I found a 12 foot long tree trunk about as big around as my arm and swung at the hornets nest as one would a baseball. It did the trick, knocking the nest onto the ground east of the trail. I waited for 20 minutes to warn other hikers about the nest but mon came by. As I left the swarm had chilled out and moved on. 
We enjoyed a long snack lunch break at Eckville before hitting the trail again. The 5 - mile walk to The Pinnacle was all on woods road. It was easy walking. Pennsylvania has had it’s sections of rock but much of the walking is pleasant and flat. “Rocksylvania” seems like an overdone nickname to me. “The State That ShallNot Be Named” is over-the-top. Pennsylvania has been kinder than New Hampshire on the body. It does get monotonous on the eyes. 
We filled water from a flowing stream before heading up into the woods to find a site for the night. We had come down off the ridge after The Pinnacle view and now had to do the work to regain the ridge line. After topping out we came to a great campsite on the trail about 6:00. We threw down for the night and got to it. Ramen with chicken and saltines for dinner. We had plenty of time to relax and enjoy the evening. 
We’ll sleep in tomorrow morning since we’re headed to Port Clinton for a shuttle at 10:00. The walk is a short one so we won’t need to wake up at 5:30. No 12 before 12 tomorrow. We’re looking forward to Cracker Barrel and resupplys!","PA 309

“Not at all.”
We people-watched silently for awhile before starting a conversation. Calvin is a long-distance truck driver. We discovered that truckers and long-distance hikers have a lot in common: small storage space for personal gear, limited wardrobe options, lots of time to think, and the privilege to see the country in a way that few experience. 
“How are you guys doing school with the kids,” he asked. 
“It’s a lot of P.E. this semester, Calvin.” We laughed. “But there’s a lot to learn from the world.”
Calvin lit up. “I tell people all the time, ‘Look at the world around you! Look at the signs. The world is trying to have a conversation with you!”
The world is trying to have a conversation with you. 
We had arrived at the Cabelas in Hamburg from Port Clinton via a shuttle that they run at 10am each day. We hiked about 5 miles into town by 9:00. Port Clinton is a small hamlet with limited everything. Hamburg is a regular commercial metropolis. We checked out the 7 acres of floor space at the store. We found a JetBoil Sumo that we’d been considering buying for weeks (they’ve been out of stock everywhere). We left Cabelas with the JetBoil, fuel, a spoon, and a new hat for Grayson.  
Next stop: Cracker Barrel. We walked about a mile across town to get there. The guy at Cabelas said we could leave our packs in the lobby area there but we didn’t feel comfortable leaving our gear unattended with the Labor Day weekend crowd walking through. We found a bench on the porch at Cracker Barrel and requested a table in view of our cache. Then we began to order. We all ate until we felt uncomfortable and then ate a little more. The next hour passed on the front porch rockers trying to recover some sense of normalcy. 
From CB we walked to Walmart and did our grocery shopping. We filled our packs with food for 3 days to Duncannon. Then headed back to the Cabelas. The shuttle brought us back to Port Clinton at 5:30 and we got back on the trail again. 
The climb out of Port Clinton is no joke. Steep and steep, it’s mainly steep with sections of steep. The ridge line was about a mile in. Camp was a 3 mile walk ahead. We cheated a little and traded the rocky trail for the parallel gravel road. A short bushwhack at a well chosen spot got us to the campsite we were searching for just as the sun was setting.","SOBO Mile 969.5
",Near Phillips Canyon Spring,"Sep 03, Sat",9.50
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657666,"I was leading the way down the trail after lunch when I heard a hiker coming towards me on the trail. She was talking loudly and we hadn’t yet seen each other. 
“My crotch is sweaty
I’m covered in bug bites
I smell absolutely terrible
But I’m having a damn good time. “
She and her partner behind her were out for a holiday weekend overnighter. Her words pretty much sum up how we’re all feeling about our trip, too. Pennsylvania has been warm and humid with sparse water and few swimming opportunities. It’s left us feeling “sticky” for the first time on the trail. 
We came upon what will, perhaps, go down as the best swimming hole in the trail. Hertline Campsite is at the side of an old, dammed pond. It was difficult to tell what the original purpose of the dam was but it’s created a wide, deep pool full of cool, fresh water. Two or three rope swings ringed the edge of the water. We each took hold of the biggest of the three and put it to the test. What great fun! A hot day cooled off in the best way possible. 
After the swim we were drying out and eating lunch next to the water’s edge. I was trying to diagnose the problem with the new JetBoil stove we bought yesterday in Hamburg. The fuel would not flow to the burner. 
As I was tinkering a group of dads and their teenaged sons walked into the campsite. The dads were brothers who had brought the cousins out for a weekend overnighter. They were very interested in our trip and I was interested in their advice on JetBoil stoves after they pulled out 3 or 4 to do lunch with. They didn’t have any insight on a quick fix but they did have a multitool that I used to disassemble the burner and regulator in hopes of finding the problem. No luck. 
“Let me take it back to Cabelas for you,” one of the dads offered. “I’ll see if they can exchange or return it and bring you back a working one. Worst case, Ill just being back your old one.”
So I handed over my new purchase to Tim - a total stranger - exchanged phone numbers, and hoped for the best. He’s going to take it to Cabelas tomorrow after they get off the trail and then come and meet us somewhere on the trail south of here. What a great help!
We made it to the 501 shelter about 5:00. Rerun was already at the table inside. The 501 is a bunk room with 12 beds and a giant skylight. We ordered three large pizzas, two 2-liter sodas, and 10 pints of cold water. Rerun split the bill with us and got in on the food party. Delivery was quick and dinner was over soon after it arrived. We were able to pack out 4 pieces for tomorrow. 
Homework showed up about 6:30 and ordered again. The pizza guy comes out here often, I suppose. 
It may rain tonight but will almost certainly do so starting tomorrow.","Near Phillips Canyon Spring
",501 Shelter,"Sep 04, Sun",19.90
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657668,"We got out of the 501 shelter quietly this morning. Rerun was already awake and Homework was sleeping late as he said he would. 
Joni and Jasper walked back to Pilger Ruh spring for water and the other boys and I finished up breakfast and packed up. 
Rain was in the forecast today. We would have liked to have done 20+ miles today but the Rausch Gap Shelter is 17.5 away and a good place to stop after getting rained on all day and maybe getting it all night tonight. 
We passed the 1000 mile mark just uphill from the shelter this morning. “One thousand miles” sounds like it would be a long way to walk. I was proud of the boys and Joni and was pumped up to be there. “Only 1200 more to go”, Jasper said. We were all thinking it. But 1000 is still cool. 
The rain did start about 10:00. When you’re about to get rained on all day rain gear doesn’t matter too much. Rain gear can only do so much for so long. After 10 hours of walking in the rain you’re just going to be wet. Staying warm is what becomes important. 
We stopped underneath Interstate 81 for lunch. It was a good shelter from the deluge. Bagels and beef jerky with leftover pizza made a great meal. 
We crossed Swatara Creek on a much older bridge than the ones I-81are using. I wonder what the Berlin Iron Bridge Company would think if they could see the two modern interstate bridges towering over their own structure. Will future bridges, yet larger than those, tower higher here for generations of traffic yet unimagined?
The rain really set in on our walk out of the gap. We were all in wet-hiker mode, resigned to our fate, spirits undampened, but dreaming of drier days behind and ahead. 
Tim texted with news that Cabelas wouldn’t help with the JetBoil. I’m thankful that he tried but am generally frustrated about the situation. I sat down to fix Grayson’s toe hot-spot and, after I got the toe taped up, emailed JetBoil to see if they could help. We’ll see. Tim wants to meet to get the JetBoil back to me. Probably not until tomorrow. 
We detoured around a messy beaver dam crossing and rejoined the AT at Rausch Gap. Cool history here. We had followed and old railroad grade as part of the reroute. We arrived ate the shelter about 4:00. Homework was about an hour behind us. Mashed potatoes for dinner. I used the alcohol stoves for fun. We’re all six in the shelter behind a sagging clothesline. I’ve got dry everything on. The sun hoodie I’m wearing smells strongly of clean laundry.","501 Shelter
",Rausch Gap Shelter,"Sep 05, Mon",17.50
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657672,"We had to put in miles today! We stopped short of a full day yesterday to get out of the rain. Rausch Gap Shelter was a great place to stop and stay dry. Homework was a fun shelter mate. We started the day just shy of 30 miles away from Duncannon and have bunks at the hostel there tomorrow night. Our original plan was to be at Clark’s Ferry Shelter tonight so that we’d have a short 4-mile walk into town. With the short day yesterday we’ll have to camp somewhere short of Clark’s Ferry. We don’t have the 25 miles needed to get there in us yet, certainly not in the rain. 
We fixed a hot breakfast and rolled out of camp slowly. I started texting with Tim last night on the Garmin to make a meet-up plan with him for today. We were out of cell service and under thick cloud cover (not good for satellite texting) but we were able to make a plan to meet about lunch time at PA 325. He offered to bring lunch, too! I spent the morning keeping us on track to make the 12:30 meeting time but didn’t tell the boys that Tim would be there (Joni needed a mid-morning pick-me-up so I let her in on the secret). 
We arrived at Clark’s Creek on PA 325 at 12:35. Tim was unloading his SUV setting up for a tailgate party! A table and chairs awaited. He had brought Wendy’s bacon cheeseburgers, Body Armor to drink, and Hershey’s candy bars for dessert. We sat at the table and relished the burgers while it rained steadily. We traded stories of National Park adventures as he talked us through his family’s sticker collection on the SUV windows. Tim returned the JetBoil, sorry he couldn’t help more. I let him know that JetBoil did return my email and it looks like they’re going to help me out. 
What a great treat! We were all thrilled and very thankful for the help Tim gave us. 
We waved goodbye as we walked off in the rain and headed south. 
Homework caught up with us and we had a fun afternoon walking and talking with him. He’s a southbounder with a similar pace and mileage to ours. 
We all pulled in to the Peter’s Mountain Shelter about 4:30. Homework planned on staying here for the night. We needed water. “0.2 miles - 300 steps” read the sign. “Steps” is a squirrelly word. Does it mean “footsteps” or does it mean “stairs”. Turns out this one means 279 rock steps off the ridge and way down to the water. I found out after carrying 5 empty quarts down to the spring. This one was rivaled only by the descent into Ice Gulch for water way back at Tom Leonard Shelter in MA. 
We cooked dinner when I got back up using the JetBoil kettle on the Pocket Rocket stove. Tim had given the boys Ramen Soup Cups. Joni and I shared a Knorr side with pouch chicken. 
We were still more than 12 miles out from Duncannon and wanted to get closer before camping so we said goodbye to Homework and newly-arrived Dodo Bird (who brought news of Stretch and Lotus close behind) and headed out. 
As night was falling we found an abandoned road south of a powerline right of way and set up tents for the night. We expect to be dry tonight but looks like we won’t be able to beat the rain to Duncannon in the morning. We’re about 10 miles away and can probably make it there by 10 if we’re up early and keep walking. We’re all looking forward to packages and showers.","Rausch Gap Shelter
",Powerline at SOBO 1036,"Sep 06, Tue",20.30
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657695,"We were walking this morning at 6:10, twenty minutes before color came into the forest. We left with breakfast in our hands, hopeful we could cover the 9 miles to Duncannon before 10:00. We all wanted the rest and comforts a hostel affords. 
The rain found us just before 8:00. This was not a casual rain, not a hobby rain, we could tell in the first minutes that this rain was here to stay for awhile. We donned ponchos & unsheathed umbrellas and pressed on. 
Duncannon is a small town on the southern banks of the wide Susquehanna River, just downstream of the confluence with the Juniata. US Route 22 follows the left bank of the Juniata for 30 or more miles before being squeezed out by the encroaching Susquehanna at Duncannon. There, the highway makes its crossing of the Susquehanna on the Ferry Bridge, a wide, four-lane, divided highway bridge with strong interstate vibes. We could hear the traffic and trains from several miles away despite the rain and terrain. 
The trail dumps out on the railroad tracks and starts a 2 mile road walk to downtown Duncannon. The rain was driving as we stepped onto the Ferry Bridge and did not let up for our long walk down High Street. We arrived at the front door of Kind of Outdoorsy at about 10:30. I dropped my pack and wiped feet before stepping inside to scout it out. Betsy, the owner, invited us all in right away and showed us to our bunk room. 
Thirty minutes later we had all showered and donned loaner clothes. Jasper and I headed to the laundromat 3 doors down. We agreed to meet the other three at The Pub in 20 minutes. 
Jasper and I separated the socks from the rest of the laundry. Socks stink and make the laundry stink so I took to washing them all separately several weeks ago. Socks also get two passes through the wash. After the first, they each get turned inside-out and washed a second time. The dirt that appears as they are turned inside-out - fresh out of the first cycle - is impressive.
Burgers all around at The Pub. “World Famous” was the description and I’ll vouch for it. They were great. 
Back to the hostel for package opening. We had 8 packages at the hostel waiting for us. Several were new gear: a second Triplex, new bear line, 2 new sleeping pads for Joni and Jasper (1 each), new shoes for all 3 boys (thanks Aunt Liz!). Jasper’s CC class sent a care package full of candy and other goodies. The Harper’s sent an assortment of Japanese candy/snacks that generated lots of interest. It was a little slice of Christmas in September. 
We all put a mind on mailing a box home and started organizing gear, drying stuff out as we got to gear that needed it. Betsy let us know that we were the only ones in the hostel for the evening so we hung a tent up in the lounge. 
YouTube played on the TV, video got edited, devices charged, Kindles got read, snacks got snacked. 
When dinner time came around Baxter wasn’t hungry. We locked him in the hostel and gave him Joni’s phone. Jasper, Grayson, Joni, and I returned to The Pub for round 2. 
As we walked in, Dodo Bird was sitting by herself, having just ordered. We invited her over and enjoyed getting to know her story. The boys headed back to the hostel after dinner while the 3 adults headed to the ice cream stand. Cones, cups, and milkshakes were enjoyed.
Back at the hostel, we did our best to mostly pack up. We don’t intend to leave before 10am tomorrow but we’d like to have most of the bunk room clean when we wake up in the morning. 
There are no windows in this room, the doors are barred, the AC is blasting. Goodnight.","Powerline at SOBO 1036

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657779,"I awoke from a dead sleep, having no idea what time it was. I checked my watch: seven AM. What a great night’s sleep! Hostel rooms are the best. 
We spent the next two hours packing and getting trail-ready. Today is day 101. We have completed 100 days on the trail, living mostly outdoors, carrying what we need, traveling by the light of day, sleeping when the sun goes down. We’ve figured out they-hiking. That’s not to say that we have nothing else to learn, but we certainly have a lot we could teach. 
We crossed Main Street at 9:00 and walked into Goodie’s restaurant for breakfast provender. After pancakes, omelets, and biscuits we returned to the hostel. Joni and I took the gear to be mailed home and headed to the Post Office. We mailed 15 pounds of gear home. We’ve taken on a bit more than 5 pounds of new gear - a savings of almost 10 pounds!
We all thanked Betsy as we walked out of the hostel. Another three-quarters of a mile of road walking got us back into the woods. We climbed to Hawk Rock. 
As we checked out the view and studied the town of Duncannon below, we struck up a conversation with a dayhiker, J.Z.  He is a triple crowner who’s hiked the AT twice, the PCT 4 times, and the CDT once-and-a-half. He seemed as interested in our story as we were of his. He lives near the trail about 20 miles further north and was out for a morning stroll. We swapped trail stories and went on our ways. 
We pulled into Darlington Shelter about 4:30 and found some good tenting sites. We pitched tents and started dinner. The shelter has bear boxes so we didn’t need to hang a bag. 
About the time we had started eating our Mountain House meals, J.Z. rolls into camp from the south carrying pizzas! “Am I too late for dinner?”, he asked. We all freaked out! He had slyly found out what our evening destination was, run some errands while we hiked, grabbed 2 large pizzas, and hiked them in a mile and a half to our tents. We put down the Mountain House and laid into the pizzas! The next 45 minutes were spent  swapping pictures and more stories. J.Z. thru hiked the AT in 1986 and has done several long distance trail thru hikes since then. He’s seen a lot of changes in gear and methods. He had a perspective on the evolution of backpacking that few have. J.Z. will go down as some of the best trail magic, just 2 days after Tim’s Wendy’s tailgate. Pennsylvania’s people score high on the trail magic scale. 
The trail has afforded some great challenges and adventures but the people we meet continue to be the real gold.","Duncannon
",Darlington Shelter,"Sep 08, Thu",11.30
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657843,"We left Darlington Shelter and began a mile-long, gentle descent into the Cumberland Valley as the sun started its roll over the eastern horizon. A southerly view opened up to show the valley, hemmed in by the South Mountain ridge 15 miles away, covered in a thin layer of low clouds settling like soft butter spread across rough toast. 
The Kittatinny and South Mountian ridges run parallel to in another roughly east-west. They are two of many ridges like this in Pennsylvania. Between these two ridges is the long, wide, fertile Cumberland Valley. We would descend Kittatinny, cross the soybean and cornfields of the valley, and return to the woods and hills of South Mountain at day’s end. 
Joni had met a trail angel, Natalie, who contacted us on Instagram and offered her help to us however we needed it. I took the chance to order a new pair of shoes from the local REI. Natalie picked them up for me and agreed to deliver them to the trail today. We had to make 10 miles before 10:30 to meet her. That’s a bit larger “bite” than our normal “12 before 12”. 
We cruised across the valley, skirting cornfields, crossing streams, and dodging school busses on their morning routes, and arrived at the meeting place (PA 641) with 15 minutes to spare. Natalie arrived with shoes, drinks, watermelon, and homemade cookies. She sat out lawn chairs for us and had us all sit for a spell. I swapped shoes out, she took the old ones, we snapped some pictures, and headed on our way. What a great favor! Thank you Natalie! Pennsylvania’s trail magic has been personal!
Boiling Springs is situated towards the south side of the valley. We rolled into town about 1:00, having covered 14 miles for the day. We found a table on the patio at Cafe 101 and ordered a hearty lunch. 
The trail out of town passed a pond, covered in Canada geese, and then wound past an old iron blast furnace in what is now a city park ringed with giant sycamore trees. Boiling Springs was, for over 100 years, a center for iron smelting. Railroads, rivers, and ore-rich mountains all converge here around this once-booming industrial town, now a peaceful and quaint weekend destination. 
We spent the two miles south of town cutting through cornfields under the hot afternoon sun. We made it back into the woods (after dodging an afternoon school bus) and headed up the ridge to find our campsite for the evening.
Our first site prospect had been taken already. Though we don’t mind sharing a site with someone lease (there was room for us) our 5:30 wake-up time makes us bad neighbors. We pressed on to a second site shown on our map but couldn’t find it - I suspect it was a duplicate entry of the first site but it created much consternation among the young scouts. We were in our own now! I found what seemed like a flat area on the topo map and we took an abandoned woods road to get to it. It proved adequate for our needs and was well-hidden to boot. We pitched our tents, hung our bear lines, cooked dinner (few were hungry after our Cafe 101 lunch) and settled into our sleeping spots for the evening. 
Tomorrow: the Half-Gallon Challenge at Pine Grove Furnace State Park!","Darlington Shelter
",Stealth South of Little Dogwood Run,"Sep 09, Fri",18.30
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657844,"A half gallon of chocolate ice cream was not intended to be eaten by one person in one sitting. Jasper and I conquered the half-gallon challenge at Pine Grove Furnace State Park today. We questioned our life decisions afterwards. Joni, Baxter, and Grayson wisely bowed out at earlier stages in the contest and walked away with their continence intact. Some quotes from the challenge table: 
“My stomach isn’t even physically big enough to fit that much,” said Baxter, staring at the container that still was more than half full of ice cream. 
“I legitimately thought I was gonna throw up. I’m surprised I’ve not yet,” said a pale Grayson, 30 minutes after throwing in the towel. It took him an hour to recover but he packed away a cheeseburger and fries before we left. 
Today was a long day of unremarkable trail. Pine Grove Furnace State Park was 14 miles ahead of us. We all got a pretty slow start out of camp. Joni and Jasper traded comfort for weight savings and traded in their long sleeping pads for short, 48 inch versions. Since both of them are taller than 48 inches there’s lots of body hanging off the pad. Joni has slept poorly for the past two nights since KOO hostel. 
Fourteen miles is also an awkward distance to shoot for. “Twelve before twelve” is a tough but attainable goal. A long break has been earned after 12 miles. Fourteen miles seems close enough to skip the break and push on but that’s a very long stretch to stay in feet. 
The trail itself was relatively easy today, mostly old gravel roads. We dumped out onto a park bike path still about a mile from the general store. It was a pleasant walk next to a creek that we shared with the weekenders who were also out enjoying the weather. 
As we neared the store we met Dirty and Hash who had recently finished the challenge. They were still in the throes of recovery. 
Twenty more yards down the way, a lady in a gaggle of folk around a fire ring asked, “Do you guys want some free food and drinks?”
“Yes,” I replied quickly. 
The boys, usually readily accepting of free food, had the upcoming ice cream gorging in mind. 
It was “Girl Scout Saturday” at the park. A ranger there had prepared a presentation on campfire cooking including beef stew, roasted veggies, pizza dough breadsticks, and apple dump cake prepared in Dutch ovens. One Girl Scout had shown up. The stew was in a 12 quart Dutch oven. It was delicious. I had two bowls. Then I had a bowl of dump cake. I considered skipping the challenge altogether and finishing the Dutch oven full of beef stew.
We spent the next 3 hours eating ice cream, lounging, resupplying, touring the museum, and chatting up the other Thru hikers. Grayson and I walked to the hostel next door and picked up his new quilt. We had had it shipped to KOO but it only arrived yesterday, after we had left. Betsy, who owns KOO and lives in nearby Boiling Springs, delivered it to PHFSP for us. Thank you, Betsy! Grayson has been sleeping under puffy jackets for the past two nights since we mailed his sleeping bag home in Duncannon (it was a heavy, bulky synthetic bag that we swapped for a down quilt). 
We walked out of PHFSP at 4:15 and blazed through the 3.5 miles to Tom’s Run shelter, arriving a bit before 6:00. We claimed the small 4-person shelter and prepared for the 2 A.M. rain forecast. It looks like it will rain all day tomorrow and Monday. 
Jasper built a fire. Baxter, Jasper, and Joni ate dinner. We set up sleeping pallets in the shelter and filtered water for tomorrow. We’re bracing for another 2 or 3 days of rain. We’ve reserved a hotel in Waynesboro for Monday night to get a break from the deluge. We are as ready as we can be.","Stealth South of Little Dogwood Run

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657859,"We tried our best to pack up quietly in the shelter this morning. There were many weekenders in the tenting sites around us. Five people in a shelter are bound to make noise. We stayed fairly quiet and we’re able to start walking by 6:30.
It had rained steadily throughout the night and continued to rain for most of the morning. The trail was easy and the morning was chilly. We were able to make great time. We passed mile 1097.7, the AT midpoint, at about 8:15. We, again, had the feeling of accomplishment mixed with the feeling of much work to be done. Just an hour later we crossed 1100 miles. They’re really starting to add up!
We cruised through the morning, snacking as we went, and rolled into Quarry Gap Shelters at 11:30, 13.7 miles from our morning start. That’s 2.75 mph on 5 hours! We felt great to be there. 
Quarry Gap Shelters has 2 shelters, each sleeping about 4, separated by a dog run and surrounded by a large covered patio. Covered picnic tables, a bench swing, and an outdoor fireplace made us wish we had planned a zero here. We spent about an hour and a half eating lunch and napping. 
A short 3 miles further was Caledonia State Park. We stopped for trash and bathrooms. I arranged a shuttle driver for tomorrow’s hotel after hearing that the road walk was dicey. Then we rolled on headed for Rocky Mountain Shelters. 
We got to the shelters about 4:00 having put in 19.2 miles for the day! We claimed one of the two small shelters. Joni and Lotus have been texting and we were hopeful they would catch up to us here. 
No Kidding rolled in just behind some section hikers. Then Stretch and Lotus showed up about 5:30. 
We first met them at NH 25 before the Whites at a burger and pizza joint. They started 100 miles north of us in New York and then summitted Katahdin 2 days before us. While we were doing Vermont and the car rides between. they were headed south, closing the 100-mile gap between us. When we got back on trail they were 35 miles north of (behind) us. It took them 2 weeks to close the gap but they did it tonight! It was fun to see them and catch up on the stories since we last talked. Crocker Cirque was the last night we spent with them and we saw them once more while slackpacking the Bigelows 2 days later. We’ll be leapfrogging with them for the foreseeable future. 
We’re all 5 in the shelter now. Baxter and I unsuccessfully tried to sleuth out where the mouse poop on Joni’s sleeping pad just fell from. We’re ready for rain but not for falling mouse poop. We’ll see how it goes tonight.","Tom’s Run Sheter

I have become accustomed enough to dirtiness, uncomfortableness, and hunger but I haven’t yet figured out how to sleep soundly in the woods. I don’t think it’s possible. I do, typically, get good sleep in the woods, the kind of sleep that fuels the next 20 mile day; but I don’t ever sleep soundly like I can behind a closed and locked door.
We are at the Cobblestone Motel in Waynesboro, PA after a 12.4 mile morning from Rocky Mountain Shelters. I had arranged with Linda, a local shuttle driver, to meet us at 11:30 at PA 16.  We were on track all morning to make the meeting until we walked in to Old Forge Picnic Area, 5 miles before PA 16. Jasper had hiked ahead and the rest of us walked into the picnic area, unknowingly missing a sharp left turn just as we exited the woods. We threw away trash and all of us unknowingly started following everyone else! None of us knew where we were going. We caught our mistake about 200 yards up the road and turned around. When we got back to the trail we mistakenly went back the same way we had come (Jasper, meanwhile, was patiently waiting for us in the woods to the south). I was on the phone with a friend, not paying any attention. It took Joni about a quarter of a mile to stop and check the map. We all felt pretty sheepish. We ended up hiking that piece of trail 3 times! Kit later said that we could skip that section on our next 2 thru-hikes. Ha!
We got to the road at 11:45. Linda took Baxter and Joni to the Walmart next door to the hotel and returned to get me, Jasper, and Grayson. We went to the hotel and checked in about the same time Joni and Baxter arrived with lunch, shampoo & conditioner, and laundry detergent. We all sunk into chairs in the adjoining hotel rooms and enjoyed sandwiches and lemonade. Showers, laundry, filter cleaning, and charging were all started right away. Much lounging was done by all. 
We left about 4:30 and walked past Walmart to the Chinese restaurant for dinner. We hit up Walmart for “desserts” and resupply. Then back to the hotel for bedtime.

It was too far off to have spotted us yet but I sat up between Jasper and Baxter and studied the beam. We had heard reports of drifters frequenting the shelters on this stretch of trail and we were close for the road. I had hung bear lines instead of using the bear boxes in case someone came late snooping for food. Now this flashlight in the woods...
It was not from the direction of the road, nor from someone approaching by the AT, but rather high up the hill behind our camp. As I studied it, I decided it could be a car’s headlights parked at a roadside pullout up the hill. I took out my phone to compare our location to nearby roads - I didn’t know of a road up there - but I had no service. The light seemed to move slowly in the trees for about the next 5 minutes. I listened for voices or footfalls in vain. Then the light disappeared. I unzipped the tent and climbed out over Baxter, intent on resolving the mystery. As I stood up I saw the moon though the trees. “Brother!”, I thought to myself. I’d been awake and intently studying this “flashlight” for the last 7 or 8 minutes! It was the rising moon the whole time.
This morning on the trail, I began to retell the story to Joni and the boys. “Last night I saw a flashlight pointed at us through the woods,” I began. 
“Oh, yes”, replied Joni, “the moon!”
Shagrinned, I relayed the whole story to everyone’s amusement.
We slept in this morning until 7:00. A friend of Joni’s from Camp Glisson days was set to meet us this morning at the road with breakfast. Emily and her boys did not disappoint! We walked into the parking lot at 8:00 to watermelon, strawberries, juice, milk, and sausage biscuits. We spent an hour together, talking about the trail and Maryland while the boys (ages 4, 7, 11, 13, 15) waged a small war around us complete with mobile artillery, sticks of dynamite, Molotov cocktails, air strikes, and six-shooters. We loved the company and the breakfast. 
We set out on the trail at 9:00 for our latest start of the trip. We still had our minds set in a 20 mile day in hopes of getting into Harper’s Ferry before lunch tomorrow. The trail today was a cruise occasionally broken by some misplaced Pennsylvanian rock. We arrived at Washington Monument State Park about 2:00 and ate a late lunch. We stepped back into the woods about 3:00 to finish up 8.5 miles to Crampton Gap Shelter. We arrived at 7:00 as the light began to fade and set to work pitching camp. 
Jasper wanted to give the new tarp a try so we pitched it along with the two triplex tents. Ramen for dinner. Bear bags up after dark. We’re all in tents. A cricket invasion of the tarp drove Jasper into the tent with me and Grayson. 
We’re up at 5:30 tomorrow for a morning cruise into Harper’s Ferry!","Ensign Cowell Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658095,"She did a double-take as she walked in the door when she saw Baxter and I, preparing to shoulder packs in the lobby of the Weis grocery store. Then she came full-stop mid-stride, her hands still on her buggy “Are you hiking the Appalachian Trail?”
“Yes we are.”
“Thru hiking?”
“Yes. My wife and two other sons are waiting for us in Harper’s Ferry.”
Baxter and I had split from the other 3 as we arrived at the old tow path three miles downstream of Harper’s Ferry. There is no good resupply in the town so Baxter and I had volunteered to turn away from Harper’s Ferry and follow the railroad further downstream towards Brunswick and the Weis Grocery Store there. Our 2 mile walk found us train dodging (not nearly as exciting as it sounds) and country-road walking. Fifty minutes later we were eating boneless wings and drinking chocolate milk in the breezy, yet air-conditioned lobby of the store, sitting in the carpet next to our packs as the morning customers pushed their carts into the store to be filled. After finishing our second breakfast I left Baxter to guard the packs while I went in a second time to get our food for the next 3 days. 
As we were unpackaging everything and throwing away unnecessary boxes and wrappers (there’s a lot of this in grocery stores) we were each silently dreading the 2 mile walk back to the AT followed by 3 miles of trail before our rendezvous with the rest of the fam who were now enjoying coffee and sweets at Battle Grounds Coffee Shop 5 miles away. 
That’s when Lovey walked in and did her double-take.
“Do you mind if I ask you guys some questions? Thru hiking is a dream of mine.”
We told her we had all morning. Ask away!
“Do you need a ride to Harper’s Ferry? I could take you there and pepper you with questions as we drive.”
Baxter’s face said it all. Absolutely she could drive is to HF! We were loading packs on no time. We all three really enjoyed the 20 minutes we had together, mostly stuck in traffic. We swapped stories and questions and answers for the length of the trip. Joni was sitting in a bench in the sun as another unfamiliar car pulled up to the curb. She didn’t notice me in the passenger window until o was directly in front of her. We piled out, said our “thank yous” and “goodbyes” and joined Grayson and Jasper who were lounging at shades picnic tables on the deck nearby. 
We sampled the culinary and confectionery offerings for the better part of 3 hours as we let the late morning and early afternoon drift by. 
I ran an errand to the nearby outfitters to swap out our defective JetBoil for the new one that the company had sent to us on Harper’s Ferry. We are now the proud owners of a working JetBoil Sumo 1.8 liter cooking system.
We satisfied all the cravings that Harper’s Ferry could satisfy before climbing the hill on the AT south and heading for the ATC headquarters. We recorded our presence in all the logs there and got our picture taken - a thru hiker rite of passage. As we were headed out of town for good I realized I didn’t have my hiking poles. I left my pack at the ATC building and walked the road back down to the coffee shop (maybe half a mile?), retrieved the poles, and walked the steep hill back to the ATC headquarters building. The rest of the fam had left town while I dallied so it was “catch up” time now. I found my fast gear and set out to catch the crew, now probably a mile or more ahead of me. 
I passed Jasper first, waiting on a rock inside the woods for me. He had watched as I crossed the Shenandoah River on the long road bridge. Then we came in Baxter, making his way up the hill with a hitch in his step. He’s been nursing a hurting calf muscle for the last 40ish miles. The rest in HF had left it stiff. I took out KT tape and spent 20 minutes taping him up. We later put a compression sleeve on it. I’m afraid the leg is getting worse instead of better. We’ll start rest, ice, compression, elevation as often as we can. Rest generally means slackpacking which the 4 of us can do for the 5th.
We gained the ridge called “Loudon Heights” and soon crossed into Virginia. We’ll be here for awhile! VA has 550+ miles of trail and will take a month plus several days to finish. 
We camped next to the trail at 4-mile campsite. We’ll start chewing through Virginia tomorrow. We set a goal to be in Damascus by October 20. That’s about 16.5 miles daily for the next 35 days. We think we’ve got it in us when we’re all healthy!","Crampton Gap Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658098,"We rolled out early again this morning, beating the sun onto the trail by a half-hour or more. We hike with headlamps until around 6:35 when the light becomes strong enough to see the footpath by. In the 10 minutes between then and 6:45, the color comes into the leaves and the dirt and the sun’s rays in the treetops aren’t far behind. 
We made a short walk to Keys Gap where a convenience store three-tenths of a mile east beckoned. We had breakfast on the mind but also wanted to ice Baxter’s leg. We walked next to the morning rush-hour traffic and, after arriving at the building, set up our base-of-operations with a view of the gas pumps. 
Coffee, breakfast sandwiches, and prepackaged donuts were had by all while Baxter laid his leg on a 10-pound bag of ice (nothing smaller could be provided :/  ). 
Our next stop was for water at the Blackburn AT Center. More rest and elevation for Baxter. Bagels, Jerky, Cheese for everyone. 
The Roller Coaster is a section of trail that has almost a dozen low peaks in a 13-mile stretch. Kit told us each hill was “too easy to be hard but too hard to be easy.”  It felt good to get back into some hills. It was work but there was a long rhythm to it. Hitting the top of a climb is a good feeling. Coming into a gap after a downhill brings the sense of a challenge ahead. Our bodies are hiking machines now. The hills don’t slow us down. They are work, to be sure, but our legs, feet, lungs, and even our psyches are tuned to eat hills. It’s a great feeling. Socrates is credited with these words: “It is a disgrace to grow old through carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit. But you cannot see that, if you are careless; for it will not come of its own accord.” I’m not sure if my strength has been developed “to it’s highest limit” but it feels good to feel this good. (I’ll leave a discussion about my developing beauty for another day)
Just before dinner we made a dicey road crossing at VA 679, a busy, 4-lane divided highway. Then up the hill to Bears Den Rocks and it’s nearby hostel. We took in the view at the rocks for a time waiting on the five-o’clock hour when the hostel store would open. We planned on camping a short distance south on the AT but did avail ourselves of showers, running water, pizza, and ice cream at the stone-castle hostel. The pizza was a dessert to a dinner of mac & cheese featuring ham chunks and crushed Cheez Its. The boys love this meal and, while it still seems appetizing to me even as I type it, neither Joni nor I have really loved it either of the two times we’ve prepared it. 
We left Bear’s Den Hostel with about 45 minutes of daylight left and made camp at the bottom of the hill. 
Baxter’s leg is still nagging him. We’ve lightened the pack and are taking more frequent rest breaks. Tomorrow will tell much about our future course of action. 
Jasper’s toe isn’t 100% but the infection is gone and it seems to be healing. 
Joni’s leg always responds to management and she takes good care of it. 
Grayson may be developing an infection in the cuticle of his big toe (Paronychia?). We’re soaking it.
I tweaked my left knee twice today while stumble-catching a bad footfall on two different occasions. I haven’t felt knee pain since we stopped the crazy hill climbs (and descents) in NH and ME. I haven’t damaged anything but I’m reminded that my knees are a weak spot in an otherwise strong (feeling) system. 
So we may be heading towards a needed break. Spirits are high. We finish The Roller Coaster tomorrow and are making plans to meet Mallory - a Camp Glisson friend - near Front Royal on Sunday afternoon.","4-Mile Tentsite

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658112,"It was lunchtime when I started making phone calls into a front Royal to start plans for a zero day. Baxter’s leg has gotten progressively worse over the last several days. We can’t give it what it needs while walking 16 miles each day. We’re going to take a day or two off to give it some real rest and to get real ice in it.
We stopped near Rod Hollow Shelter for a lunch of tortillas stuffed with peanut butter, Nutella, trail mix, and dry instant oatmeal (water to drink). My calls to Front Royal hostels went unanswered so I left some voicemails. Manassas Gap shelter was a possible exit point, 12.9 miles ahead. We’d need a night in the woods before then so we set our sights on Whiskey Hollow Shelter. 
We spent the warm afternoon under beautiful skies and are thankful for the weather of the last several days as well as the forecast for the coming week. Audiobooks passed the time - Phil Dragash’s reading of The Lord of the Rings has kept Baxter, Grayson, and I hooked for many hours.
We arrived at Whiskey Hollow Shelter around 5:15. A group of over 20 young boys scouts and dads had overrun the shelter and the surrounding tent sites. We were able to find purchase for our tents on a nearby roadbed. Water was plentiful at a slow-flowing stream nearby. The bear pole at the shelter looked like a Christmas Tree ornamented with food bags so we threw our own bear line near our tents. 
Cell reception was strong enough to get a call out to Mallory. She’s camping with friends in Front Royal this weekend. We called to see if she could meet us tomorrow at the Tucker’s Lane parking area and drive us into town. She agreed to be there at 9:30. So we’ve got our work cut out for us in the morning. Six-point-eight miles before 9:30 is doable with another early start. We’ll land in a Front Royal hotel for Sunday and Monday nights and re-evaluate Baxter’s leg after the nero/zero combo.","South of Bears Den Rocks

We stealthed our way out of Whiskey Hollow this morning before the sun began it’s morning revelation. The 6.8 miles to Tucker’s Lane passed quickly on easy trail and we arrived at the parking area just after 9:00. Mallory arrived to great fanfare just after 9:30. She had left Eliana with friends at her campsite so our time together this morning had to be short. They were packing up this morning and, as a parent who has packed up a campsite while simultaneously supervising young children, I was doubly-thankful for making us a side-errand this morning. 
She gave us a quick tour of downtown Front Royal. Our plan was to do showers and laundry at The Basecamp on Main Street (a hiker space in the backroom of the local outfitter) before checking in to the Baymont hotel at 3:00.
The Basecamp didn’t open until noon (it’s Sunday) so she dropped us off at the nearby McDonalds. We took over the back corner with all of our gear and put in our first order. We’ve learned to do an “appetizer” round at fast food joints instead of ordering everything that we think we can eat up front. Getting a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit into the tummy helps gauge if it’s possible to eat 2 more or if just 1 more will do. The next 2 hours were passed refilling drinks and people watching in the surprisingly busy McDonalds. Grayson and I walked across the street to the Rural King to see what was there (baby chicks, spears & tomahawks, guns & pistols, free popcorn, UTVs). 
We shouldered packs and headed to Main Street just after noon. The Basecamp is a back room in a multi-storefront property downtown. It’s got showers and laundry reserved for thru hikers. We spent about an hour there.
Jasper and I took lightened packs and walked back past the McDonalds to the grocery store. Mallory returned to shuttle the other 3 to the Baymont Hotel. The town is walkable but having a car to help with the gear and the injured leg is a real luxury.
Jasper and I bought food for the next several meals. Our hotel room is a suite with a stovetop and refrigerator. We’re planning on cooking several real meals.
We all met back at the Baymont about 3:00 and settled in for a good rest. We had only hiked 7 miles in trail today but we’ve been moving since 5:30am. 
Dinner was beef skillet on Fritos with sour cream and shredded cheese topping. Feet got soaked, leg got iced and elevated, and Joni’s pack got soaked in a vinegar bath - she’s trying to fight the stink.
We’re sleeping in tomorrow morning before a breakfast of sausage, eggs, and blueberry pancakes.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658301,"Joni and I awoke simultaneously to the sound of falling water. It was 1:30am. Someone in room 318, just above us, had started the shower and water was cascading into the sink area of our room. 
Joni called the front desk while I mitigated the situation at the sink. A hotel manager could anon be heard knocking on the upstairs door. Next he was at our room’s door. He took a look at the situation and decided to move us to a new room. 
We had settled into a 2-room suite with a kitchen. The boys were still blissfully unaware of what was conspiring in our room. The manager led me, toting my pack and whatever I could carry, around the building to our new room, number 231. He accidentally opened door 230 first and quickly backed out of the doorway and closed the door - hilarious. I don’t know if anyone was in the room or not. 
I headed back to 218 to wake the boys and make the move. They were awake when I got back. “Are you guys ready for a night hike?”, I joked. We made two or three trips but we’re able to move all our gear and food to the new suite. We all settled down into our new beds, adjusted alarms for 7:30, and got back to sleep. 
Sausage and pancakes with bottomless coffee and chocolate milk filled the morning. I enjoy cooking and have missed a real stove and cookware. Blueberries, chocolate chips, and nerds clusters were mixed into the skillet batter.
We watched TV and lounged around until about 11:00 when the boys and I headed down to the outfitters about a quarter mile down Main Street. Mallory and Eliana returned to Front Royal at noon with Chick Fil A sandwiches and sweet tea! We met at the visitors center and enjoyed the afternoon at the picnic tables. Off to ice cream and the game store afterwards. The kids played in the arcade for an hour while the moms went to Walmart for a trail resupply. 
I took the kids next door to a Rural King when the game time ran out. We enjoyed free popcorn, chicks and rabbits, and tactical weaponry. Eliana played along for all of it.
Mallory and Joni came back and took Baxter & Jasper back to the hotel (the car can only hold 5). Grayson and I walked back but took 2 detours. First we went back to the game store and bought an escape room game. We will play this tomorrow- we’re likely going to take another zero day. Then Grayson and I went back to the ice cream stand and got another round. A Strawberry Cheesecake Special Sundae for me and a cookies and cream milkshake for him. Then we walked back to the motel.  
Our PT friend Seth face timed with Baxter and Joni and have some good advice on the leg. We’ll see how it helps.
I cooked beef skillet - a home favorite - for dinner. We enjoyed the rest of the evening inside. We suspect we’ll take another day off tomorrow since Baxter’s leg is still bothering him. We’ll see how it feels in the morning and make a call.","Tucker’s Lane Parking

It is 7:37pm. We are all in tents at Gravel Springs Hut in Shenandoah National Park. The fading light paints a grey backdrop to a forest of black silhouettes. From today onward we will have more dark each day than light. We have 960 miles to go and 63 days to do it. 
Baxter walked the 13 miles today and felt good doing it. “I’m at eighty seven percent”, he said. We all felt great after two and a half days of rest. The trail today was a climb uphill into Shenandoah National Park. It was a gradual climb, easy on both feet and legs, but the climbing took eleven miles of the walk today. We passed several westerly views, crossed Skyline Drive 5 times, and met several day hikers out for their equinoxial stroll.
The day started at the hotel with continental breakfast. We divvied up the food and repacked packs before walking out the door and down Main Street to the Visitors Center where Mallory had met us for lunch in Monday. The town trolley arrived about 9:30 and we boarded for what turned out to be a wild ride to the trailhead on VA 522. I glanced behind us more than once to see if we were, perhaps, being chased by police cars. We got in the trail about 10:20 and met Kung Fu Kitty at the trailhead, a southbounder that we hadn’t yet met and didn’t see all day despite our slower-than-normal pace. 
We stopped after 3.5 miles at the National Park boundary and had a tortilla-peanut butter-Nutella lunch. Nerds Gummy Clusters are our new vice. Five bags were bought at Walmart so we don’t have to share. I ate all of mine before we left the hotel.
We met Hurricane Dave and First Time Fred here at the shelter. They are friends from way back who met in corporate jobs. Dave needed a buddy to hike SNP with so he called Fred. This is their 3rd night out after starting at 522 (where we were for brunch today). Too bad our paces are so different. I’m sure we’d love to hang out another night. 
Dave was here at this shelter in 1979 during a hurricane (also named Dave). He relayed some wild stories about the experience. 
We’re going to sleep in until 6:00 tomorrow morning and roll out at 7. We’ll take another “short” day, maybe 13 miles, to give Baxter’s leg another day of rest. Then we’ll hopefully be able to start back to our 16+ routine.","VA 522

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658307,"I am 43 years old and, after 116 days of sustained exercise, am in the best physical condition of my life (at least for walking). Jasper is 15 and still has some years to go before his physical prime. Yet it is undeniable that he could smoke me on an extended day of backpacking. We are very evenly matched but a keen observer would be able to pick out the laggard.
Today was a day of climbing. No steep climbs nor any that were particularly long. They were steep and long enough to begin to feel their pull. Several times today I fell in behind Jasper, him in front and me behind. It was a cold morning with the warm sun on the lee side of the ridge battling the breezy shade on the western side. The temps spurred us both to a brisk pace. He would fall into an uphill pace that I estimate was over 3.5 mph and could, perhaps, have topped 4 mph. We would walk like that for a mile and a half or two, gain the top, and then slacken the pace as we headed downhill. Those last few hundred feet of climb would see him slowly begin to pull away, never out of conversation range, but he only needed another half mile of the same terrain to put 50 yards on me. When the roles were reversed and I was leading, he could match me step for step. 
Last night was a sleepless one. It was a cold night in the low 40s but the wind, forecasted as 12-15 mph, was freight-training through the treetops in shifts all night long. Falling trees and limbs were at the forefront of my mind throughout the night. A stick did fall on the boys (new) tent and punctured the roof before sliding off the top. I was able to patch it when we got to camp this evening.
I imagine that every treetop and limb in the forest could be assigned a number: the speed, in mph, that it would take to break that part of the tree off. I imagine there wouldn’t be as many 3s since a 3 mph wind is so common; all those limbs get cleaned out nearly daily. Branches with a 15 seem like they would be much more common. A 15 mph wind comes along much less frequently and so, leaves time in between windstorms for limbs to weaken and become vulnerable. Also, a 15 mph wind takes down all limbs with a score of 15 or lower. 
I’ve thought a bit more about this today and I’m not sure if my logic is airtight*. But it was what drove my sleeplessness last night. There were more limbs falling than I was comfortable with. 
The path today was an old one in many places with the fingerprints of the 1930s CCC all over it. On the slopes of the mountains it climbed it had been painstakingly benched, graded, and switchbacked so as to be always 3 feet wide, level sided-to-side, and gently graded even over the course of winding, 2 mile climbs of 1000 feet. This workmanship is evident on the profile maps. The easy, engineered grades have a distinctly different profile than the ones that take a more direct line to the top or to the gap. To engineer trail like this often requires stone walls on the downhill side to shore up the trail and leave it level. Culverts, water bars, and thoughtful lines through the terrain have made the last 40 miles of trail very enjoyable.
We left Pass Mountain Hut after a nerve-wracking night into a cold and still breezy trail. The sun was throwing weak rays through the trees as we descended to Thornton Gap. A trailhead parking lot with bathrooms offered warmth, hot water for sink baths, and drinking water.
We climbed to Mary’s rock and onward to The Pinnacle and then to Stony Man. The view to the west remains the same for much of the walk though the park. The view to the east is exceedingly rare.
Downhill from Stony Man is the Skyland Resort. We arrived around 1:00 and took seats in the dining room. An overpriced hamburger is still a hamburger. Joni, Baxter, and I ordered the Angus Burger. Grayson did the kids grilled cheese sandwich. Jasper made the pro move and ordered 2 kids cheeseburgers, each 4 ounces. For the same price as our 6oz Angus Burgers he got 8oz of burger, double fries, and none of the veggies he didn’t want. Grayson ordered a second grilled cheese before he was done with the first.
We spent 2 hours at Skyland drinking coffee, eating treats, and relaxing. Joni called Jaspers doctor and got more antibiotics prescribed for his toe. It’s not hurting him but we are keenly aware that it hasn’t yet healed. It looks gnarly on the worst days and painful in the best. I do think it’s moving towards healing as the toenail continues to grow. 
I attempted to snag a room at the resort but could only get the clerk down to $303 - way too rich for our type. It’s a Friday night on the first weekend of fall; I wasn’t expecting much. 
We headed south again about 3:00 and walked 7 easy miles to Rock Spring Hut. We set up in a small meadow just north of the side trail to the hut. Baxter and I walked down to Rock Spring and discovered a steady flow coming from under a giant boulder. It was the freshest and clearest water we’ve seen since the Sidney Tappan campsite in the 100 mile wilderness. 
We had ramen and chicken for dinner. A spike buck visited us in our meadow campsite as we were doing our evening chores. He sneaked up on us and skirted the edge of thee meadow, all the while checking us out. He walked from his usual path into the meadow, around the eastern half of it just inside the wood line, and continues in his routine path on the other side. We cinched up camp and settled down for what we expect to be the coldest night we’ve had on the trail.  
*my intuition says that there would likely be a pretty even distribution of numbers throughout the forest. While smaller limbs with a label of 3 are “created” more often they are also “cleaned out” more often. Contrawise, limbs with a 15 get created less often but are cleaned out less often, giving more time for 15s to get created. Is the distribution of limb scores in a forest uniformly distributed or is the distribution skewed towards one end?","Pass Mountain Hut

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658515,"I was awake early in the morning, about 4:30, when I heard something near one of the bear hangs. It was in the sticks and the grass, not in the tree. I keep my headlamp on quickdraw for times like this but I wanted to listen for a bit before I lit it up. Jasper heard it too. 
“Dad!?”, he said loudly. Not scared but urgent. 
“I hear it, too,” I answered. 
I unzipped my tent and pulled back the vestibule flap. Three clicks on the headlamp bathed the half-meadow in light. The spike buck was back, browsing in the grass close by the bear hang. He was unfazed by the light. I turned it off and laid back down. He browsed his way around the perimeter in the opposite direction from last night. 
The night, nor the morning, were as cold as we expected though it was a chilly dawn. We all walked out of camp after breakfast in multiple layers of clothing. Big Meadows Wayside was our goal. 
Big Meadows is one of the largest areas I. The park for services, camping, lodging, and day hiking. The wayside is on Skyline Drive about halfway between Thornton and Rockfish Gaps on the north and south ends of the park, respectively. It was a 4-mile walk for us we did in about an hour and a half, arriving about 9:30. 
We did the normal wayside stuff: food, restrooms, resupply. 
Joni bought a 6-pack of bagels and a block of crème cheese. The lady at the register asked if she’d like them toasted. Yes! With butter? Yes! On the griddle? Yes! They were divine. I boiled water outside for coffee (why didn’t they have coffee inside?). We ate donuts, sausage biscuits, fudge, honeybuns, pop tarts, and YooHoos. Jasper took care of the resupply for the next 3 days. 
My parents, fresh off the plane from western adventures, are readying the camper to shadow us down the Blue Ridge Parkway for several days. We will see them on Monday or Tuesday (today is Saturday). Jasper was buying food to tide us over. 
We left the wayside around 11:00 and carried on. 
About 5 miles later, somewhere just past Bootens Gap, the boys whooped at Joni and I through the woods. They were behind us. I whooped back. Usually, the whoop is a question: “Where are you?”. We often use it at trail splits or junctions to make sure everyone, in front and behind, has gone the right way. An answering whoop means “Here I am,” and the “conversation” usually ends there. This time there was a third set of whoops. “Come back”, we heard one yell. Joni and I turned back. “I tweaked my knee,” Baxter yelled.
He was sitting in the trail, in no obvious pain. We got him up and walked him up the trail to a place we could sit down for our late lunch (the wayside had done it’s brunch time job). He seemed to be managing and didn’t seem to be injured significantly. “Tweak” was looking like a good word for it. We ate lunch on the side of the trail. I took off his ill-fitting knee brace and wrapped his knee in KT tape for full support. I basically created a custom knee brace (with the help of some internet pictures). We divvied up all his gear among the 4 of us and, after a rest and a pep talk, headed south again. Slow going on top of slow going. 
We have had a Thanksgiving end date in mind since long before we started the hike. Thanksgiving would give us 175 days in the trail - a smidge shy of 6 months. Early on, there were days none of us thought we would make it (July 2 comes to mind). There were days in New Hampshire and Maine when we weren’t sure when we could finish but we knew it was possible. There were a few days in Pennsylvania when I thought finishing by Veterans Day weekend (November 12) was a possibility. Now, I have resigned myself to not knowing and, even better, not speculating. Baxter’s injury has taken the “knowing” out again. This has been a really hard truth for the boys to digest. We kick around mileages, averages, and dates several times a day, always with THE GOAL - Springer Mountain - in mind.  But when there is an injury, the goal changes along with the actions needed to achieve the goal. Namely, we change from “get miles!”, to “get this injury better.” In our experience, getting the injury better has involved fewer miles, less weight, and more days off. 
Fish and I were hiking in the back today when we passed by Bearfence Mountain. The view and the rock scramble across its summit are both missed by the AT, though the AT parallels a trail connecting those two features. Fish and I got to the second of two access trails  “Cam we do the rock scramble?”, he asked. The others were ahead, Texas Pete having recently been injured, and it would be a 0.4 mile loop back to where we were standing. 
“Sure”, I said. 
We dropped packs and took off up the trail, doubling back across the ridge. We were going true “wrong direction” on the loop and passed 3 dozen or more day hikers picking their way along the jumble of boulders. It was great fun. I remember, after finishing Mahoosuc Notch, looking at Texas Pete and wondering if he wanted to go back and do it again. Rock scrambling is fun. 
Lewis Mountain Campground was our next stop. We considered staying the night there with its camp store and showers but decided, despite Texas Pete’s knee tweak, we’d push on a bit further today and get more than just 12 miles out of it. He was making good progress without gear in his back and was feeling good. 
We were shooting for a site in a fire road beyond Baldface Mountain. We weren’t sure if it’s soar or it’s condition. When we got to the top of the climb up Baldface, there were some adequate sites near the trail. Not quite smooth or level, they nonetheless gave us enough pause to explore further. Ninja Squirrel and I pressed into the undergrowth behind the campsites and waded onto the broad, round, forested summit of the mountain. We found some level ground among ferns and oaks that we chose as our home for the evening. Bear bags are hung, bodies are in tents, and we’re all settle down for a good night’s sleep.","Rock Spring Hut

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658532,"We woke before dawn again and found our way back onto the trail by headlamp. Water was scarce so we had decided to hold off on breakfast for a mile and a half until South River picnic area where there was a spigot. 
I was last in line coming down the trail in the pre-dawn dimness when I perceived a man standing directly to my left less than 8 feet away. He was in jeans and a camo jacket and was watching me as I passed him. I startled and stopped short. “Did they see you!?”, I asked, motioning to the boys ahead. 
“I think they did, but your wife never looked up,” he said, smiling. 
The man explained he owns land adjacent to the national park and comes out to the AT to scout deer and turkey before the seasons open. I asked the boys and they assured me that they had, indeed, seen the man.
We had grits and coffee when we arrived at the picnic area. Nat Geo & Sunset arrived soon after us with the same plan. We discussed the possibility of rain but none of us had a recent forecast. 
Just after noon we crossed over Hightop Mountain and came to a boxed spring in the side of the trail. We’ve seen water pouring from the rock less than half-a-dozen times on our trip but here was a beautiful spring doing just that. Cold, pure water. We lunched at Hightop Hut hoping to eat under cover if the rain began. It did not. 
The rain didn’t catch us until we can to came to Simmons Gap about 3:00. Thunder rumbled on the nearby mountaintop. I was with Texas Pete and Ninja Squirrel at the road. North Star and Fish were far behind. A ranger station was 0.2 miles east down the road. I took all the empty bottles that the boys had and told them to take North Star & Fish to the shelter 2.1 miles ahead. Is meet them there. I hoped they might be able to beat the rain or at least get out of the worst of it. 
I started down the road with 7 empty quart bottles. I hadn’t gotten halfway to the buildings when the sky opened up. It was a downpour. I was able to fill the quarts and get them into my pack without getting too wet. I was headed back up the road less than 15 minutes since leaving. 
As I started walking the road a pickup truck appeared and began a three-point turn to head back the way he’d come. I looked and pointed at his side mirror so he’d see me as he pulled off. Sure enough, he rolled his window down and asked if I needed a ride. Yes!
I was back to the trail just as North Star and Fish were arriving. The rain had abated after wetting the canopy above. 
We arrived at Pinefield Hut about 4:00. The rain had stopped and we were able to set up camp slowly. Ramen for dinner. Nat Geo and Sunset pitched camp on a tent pad nearby.","Baldface Mountain
",Pinefield Hut,"Sep 25, Sun",16.10
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658549,"We repeated our leave-early routine this morning and left Pinefield Hut without breakfast. There was no water at the shelter so we hiked 3.1 to Ivy Creek before sitting down for a half-hour breakfast break. 
Loft Mountain Campground store was only 3.4 ahead. We knew we’d get a second breakfast there so we weren’t real serious about the Ivy Creek meal. 
Far Out had comments about epic trail magic at Loft Mountain Campground tonight. Steaks, fruit, pizza, alcohol, etc were advertised. The magician lives in the area and puts on this treat for hikers about twice a month. We were, unfortunately, not going to be able to stay since, fortunately, my parents were meeting us in Blackrock Gap to take us to their camper. 
When we arrived at Loft Mountain Campground around 10:00 the thru hiker crowd was already forming. Several hikers were planning on hanging out all day for the trail magic that night. We met some new characters - Podcast and Tang - and recognized some familiar faces - Kung Fu Kitty, Nat Geo, Sunset. 
We spent about 45 minutes at the store enjoying the wares and the incredible weather outside. Fall is here but the day has been warm in the sun. The air is crisp but the sky is a stunning shade of blue and is clear as a sky has ever been. 
We heard news today of hurricane Ian, about to hit Florida. The remnants of the storm will undoubtedly make it to Virginia late this week. We’ll enjoy the stunning weather until then. 
My parents are bringing their camper to meet us in the trail again. Their timing might be serendipitous if Ian does pay us a visit. There are worse places to ride out some rain than Grandie and Grandpas camper!
The 7 miles from the campground to Blackrock Gap were unremarkable. The weather was glorious and the trail was easy underfoot. 
We arrived at Blackrock Gap just before 3:00. Dad arrived in the truck at 3:00 to great fanfare. We loaded up and drove the 40 minutes to Misty Mountain Campground where we greeted a teary-eyed Grandie with hugs and cheers. 
We began the chores with a gear dump in the screened gazebo. Showers, laundry, and bacon cheeseburgers followed. Ninja Squirrel pitched the tarp and prepared to sleep on the lawn. Texas Pete and Fish each took a bunk in the camper. 
I made a late (8:00) run to Charlottesville for KT tape to wrap Baxter’s leg with but was home before 9:00 - a very late night for a thru hiker!","Pinefield Hut

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658590,"We met Grandpa at the camper at 6:00. Coffee was brewing and Grandpa was getting the griddle fired up for breakfast sandwiches. The boys were still asleep and the sun was still an hour from rising.
We were at Rockfish Gap by 7:10 with full bellies and empty packs. Our plan was to head 
Early 6:00 start with breakfast sandwiches. Our plan was to hike northbound back to a Blackrock Gap. It would be nearly 20 miles but we felt up for it. 
The fall colors have begun to show in the treetops. The Tupelo seem to be the first to change from green, then briefly to yellow, and then to a bright red. These yellows and reds fort the green canopy behind and make the trees easy to spot. Their cousin, the dogwood, does a similar stunt in the Georgia spring, blooming white in a forest that’s just beginning to push out green leaves. Spring dogwoods and fall tupelos are easy to spot. The weather was beautiful a crisp but not cold, breezy but not windy, sunny but not hot. 
We stopped for second breakfast about 3.4 miles in at McCormick Gap. Grandie had packed a loaf of blueberry bread that lasted about 3 minutes. 
We continued up Bears Den Mountain to radio towers and the tractor seats. This is a conspicuous summit and will be fun to look back on in e coming days as we hike south. 
Our only water for e day was at the 8 mile mark. We filled up at Calf Mountain Shelter for the next 12 miles. Everyone took 2 quarts  
Lunch was at Sawmill Overlook. Deli sandwiches with lettuce and tomato were on point. We ate a bag of corn chips along with the sandwiches. 
We were back to Blackrock Gap about 4:00 and all took yesterday’s same seats on the concrete parking space bumpers. Grandpa arrived about 4:10 and we repeated the gear-and-body pile in that we did yesterday and headed back to the campground.
The Shennies are finished! I can’t imagine having hit the park at a better time of year. The weather is just beginning to turn cool. There were several cold nights in a row that our gear was just adequate enough for. The trail itself was a joy to walk. The waysides and campgrounds provided enjoyable diversions and destinations. We’ve heard that the real beauty of Shenandoah is found in the valley, on and near the river. I’d love to come back sometime and explore that part but for now, Shenandoah National Park gets high praise from us!
We arrived back at the campground about 5:00. North Star and I promptly got back into the truck to run 3 errands in Waynesboro. 
First, we wanted to stop by Rockfish Outfitters and see if they have the fleece jackets the boys will need for the upcoming weeks. The outfitters was unexpectedly closed so we continued in towards Waynesboro. 
Stop number 2 was Stanimal’s Hostel. Texas Pete’s food bag had delaminated weeks earlier. We thew it into the trash in Duncannon after Hilltop Packs agreed to send us a replacement. Stanimal’s was far enough ahead to be a good candidate for a shipping location. After a hunt around the block twice for the correct address we found the building and I walked in. The package from Hilltop was there and so was a care package from our Classical Conversations homeschool group. The latter was full of candy, coffee, and a large package of Nutter Butters. 
Stop number 3 was Kroger for some light resupply and campground food. We anticipate that we’ll do an overnight trip while G & G are here (more on this later) and so we got some breakfast and lunch foods. 
While we were in Kroger, Podcast texted to see if we could give them a ride into Waynesboro. I had told him and Tang that I could help them out if they needed it. So, despite the late hour (6:15) I agreed to go meet them and bring them back to town. North Star was not as excited to help as I was. It was late, we had hiked 20 miles and she was tired, and worst of all, we hadn’t eaten dinner before we left the campground.
Despite all this, we drove to Rockfish Gap and met Podcast, Tang, and Kung Fu Kitty around 6:45. We delivered them to the YMCA via Cookout and headed back to the campground, finally arriving around 7:30. We are our bacon cheeseburgers fresh off the griddle (that’s two nights in a row of bacon cheeseburgers), set up a tent next to Ninja Squirrel’s tarp, and promptly fell asleep. 
Alarms are set for 7:00 in the morning- we’re “sleeping in”!","Rockfish Gap

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658616,"We got a later start this morning because of our late night last night.
Today’s plan was to hike from Rockfish Gap south to Reid’s Gap, another long day of 19.2 miles. Texas Pete elected to take a zero day to rest his leg. He’s been trucking along since Front Royal and needs a break. Hurricane Ian is coming into VA on Saturday so we’re planning on taking a zero day then (maybe Sunday, too). 
We passed a couple headed northbound who were finishing their thru hike in Rockfish Gap today. They live in nearby Richmond and had started in Rockfish Gap headed north. Then traveled from Katahdin to Springer and continued north. This is called a “wraparound” hike. It was fun to see and talk with them less than 5 miles from their destination.
We had second breakfast at Paul C Wolfe shelter - banana bread loaf. 
Lunch was atop Humpback Mountain Rocks. 
Watered up at Dripping Rock. 
Met Grandpa and Texas Pete at Reeds Gap. 
Went to Rockfish Outfitters straightaway and bought fleece jackets for Texas Pete and Fish. Ninja Squirrel needed a large that they didn’t have so we ordered it online to be shipped to Daleville. 
Resupplied at Kroger.

",Reeds Gap,"Sep 28, Wed",19.20
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658637,"We packed up our camp at Misty Mountain Campground this morning. Mom and Dad will stay another night but will move the camper further south tomorrow. We planned on spending the night at The Priest Shelter. The dearth of road crossings on this stretch of trail made an overnight the best course of action. 
Dad dropped us off in Reed’s Gap after sunrise. It was a very cold morning. North Star, Fish, and Ninja Squirrel headed into the woods while Texas Pete and I hung back with Dad to tape his knee. The 8 strips of tape took about 10 minutes to get set but the “knee brace” lasts for three or four days. 
The hike today was a doozy on the profile map. Shortly after Reeds Gap was a 1000 for climb over Three Ridges Mountain. Then a 3000 foot descent )with some “up” peppered in) to the Tye River, then immediately back up 3000 feet in 4 miles. 
Since it’s downhill that bothers Texas Pete’s leg, North Star agreed to blue-blaze with him around Three Ridges Mountain using the Mar-Har Trail. It bypasses the mountain and lessens the downhill while also cutting out 4 miles of trail. Fish joined the Mar-Har expedition while Ninja Squirrel and I set off over the peak. 
We met 2.5 hours later and had lunch at a windy trail junction. 
The climb up The Priest was cold and windy and impressively graded. The trail climbs this 3000 foot hill on a winding path that stays a 15% grade for 4 miles. It is a marvel of trail planning. 
We arrived at the shelter at 4:00 and claimed it for ourselves. There was a troop of dads of former Boy Scouts camping together in the sites in front of the shelter. The approaching hurricane had cut their numbers drastically. There were still 5 of them with plenty of booze. “Are you quiet drunks or loud drunks?”, I asked. “We’re going to bed early,” they replied. I was skeptical but they were true to their word. 
The water is great here. Clear running from the ground and very close to the shelter. 
It will be a cold night. Hurricane Ian will arrive tomorrow afternoon with lots of rain and not a little wind.","Reeds Gap

We woke up at mile marker 1364.5 putting us 62% of the way through the mileage. Obviously, it would be ideal if we were ahead in mileage instead of a bit behind, but we are happy with our progress. If worse comes to worst, we can be on the trail until Christmas. Barring an unexpected injury or extended illness, we have no doubt we’ll finish the trail.We were up before the sun at 6:00. The morning was cold and we donned all of our warm layers along with rain gear to keep the wind out. We boiled water for a hot breakfast and sat at the picnic table to eat. We were walking before 7:00, stepping out onto a trail ready for rain. The remnants of hurricane Ian reach us in the Blue Ridge of Virginia today. The wind was up and blustery, the air was humid and chilly, and the sky was overcast. Some forecasts put the rain at 11:00 while others say 3:00. We planned to meet Dad in Hog Camp Gap at 2:30. Morale was low, temperatures were dropping, and the rain was a near certainty.As we walked and got the ""engines"" churning we began to warm up. Trail snacks on the move helped fortify spirits. We began making good time. I passed out bagels/beef jerky/cheese lunch about 11:30 and we ate it while we walked. The rain seemed imminent and stopping for lunch in a cold rain is not something we want to do.We continued to walk and it continued to not rain!We reached an opening on the ridge that afforded a wide view of the east and north and could see that the blustery weather would probably remain for awhile but that rain wasn't yet developing.  As I stepped onto the road in Hog Camp Gap and looked to the left, I could see the roof of Dad's truck coming into view. Perfect timing! We loaded up and started back down the gravel road dry and happy. We made a stop by the Food Lion for fruit, ice cream, and gatorades and then went on to the KOA in Lexington.We have planned on spending at least 3 nights here.

The weather looks adequate - little rain, low winds, low 50s temps. The boys nor the mom want to hike today. So we're taking an unplanned zero!There was oatmeal for breakfast. The boys were settling in for a day in the camper.
Joni wanted a coffee shop where she could get wifi and a real coffee. She and I borrowed the truck and headed to Lexington where I dropped her off in front of a coffee shop there. 
If we're skipping today then that puts us 10 miles behind schedule to meet Jordan. I checked out the map to see if there was a place 10 miles closer to us that would be a suitable meet-up location. Bryant Ridge Shelter has a side trail that leads 0.5 miles to a gravel road. I decided to drive the truck out to that spot to see if the van, which Jordan and Susan are driving to VA, would make it up the road, too.The drive to Bryant Shelter along Virginia backroads was an enjoyable one. Much of the drive followed Jennings Creek and reminded me of the drive into Tate City, GA up the Tallulah River. The green forest, some of it shading into yellow, was close in on the road. At times the road was hemmed in on one side by the creek and the other by rock. The truck made the trip with no problems and the van will be able to do the same. 
I headed back to Lexington to pick up Joni. Washington and Lee University's Parents Weekend was just letting out as I rolled into town the second time. The streets were packed with pedestrians and cars.I found a parking space near the coffee shop and then found Joni far in the back room. She needed a little more time so I walked to the nearby outfitters to see if they had any gear we needed (they didn't). I walked through an art gallery near the coffee house that made me wish I had the money and interest to get into art (I have little of either). Then Joni and I ran some errands while we were in Lexington: Kroger, CVS, KFC, WalMart.Back at the KOA it was chicken and waffles for dinner. We ate in the camper once more while watching the Alabama/Arkansas football game on the TV.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658807,"Time and the winds will sooner or later bury the Seven Cities of Cibola—Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, all of them under dunes of glowing sand, over which blue-eyed Navajo bedouin will herd their sheep and horses, following the river in winter, the mountains in summer, and sometimes striking off across the desert toward the red canyons of Utah where great waterfalls plunge over silt-filled, ancient, mysterious dams.-Edward Abbey, from Desert SolitaireWe walked along Brown Mountain Creek for about a mile and a half today. The dell through which it ran was never wider than 300 yards but was flat and gentle with the creek choosing a path down one side or the other. It left a broad valley floor that sharecroppers had settled in the early 1800s. They were freed slave farming tobacco, cotton, and corn for income, along with potatoes and vegetables for sustenance. These farmers sold their land to the forest service in 1920 and it has lain fallow since. One hundred years of idleness has taken the timbers of the houses, the water furrows, and the split rail fences. It has not been able to erase the stone foundations, chimneys, rock walls along the creek and lining old fields, now forested. The roadbed is still plain and passable (helped by 90 years of hikers on it). I think about the interstates, concrete bridges, power line towers, and dams that are commonplace now. What will 100 years of idleness do them? If a century could hardly hide this community of people living off the land, it will likely have little effect on a 4-lane interstate 100 yards wide and 1000 miles long. I don’t think the Navajo bedouin will need to “strike off across the deserts” of Utah, they can just follow the interstates. We got a late start today after spending the morning packing up our stuff at the campground. We will not be going back since Grandie and Grandpa leave tomorrow. We ate waffles and pancakes before loading up the truck about 7:30. We were walking south about an hour later with slackpacks. G & G will meet us at the end of the day with our full kits. We climbed Cole Mountain under a cold, rain-washed sky. Lenticular clouds high above showed the wind cleaning out the last of the storm. The forest we climbed though was fresh and clean. We gained an open ridge of meadows and sweeping views showing a wide expanse of Virginia on both sides. The breeze cut though our jacket zippers and necklines chilling the skin, quickly rewarmed by the engine within. It felt good to be back on the trail after a double zero. Ninja Squirrel had read of the wreckage of an A6 Intruder aircraft close to the trail. He saved a waypoint on his GPS and managed to locate the debris. It was a neat find in the middle of the woods. The small gathering of scraps of twisted metal was all that was left of the large fighter plane that crashed here. We don’t know many other details. Maybe it’ll still be here for the bedouins - they’re going to have a lot of questions. As we descended the southerly ridge of Bald Knob we began to encounter serious storm damage in the forest. We didn’t experience high winds or hard rain in Lexington but this part of the forest got lashed. It seemed like the oaks had it worse than most other trees. Many had broken off high in the canopy and crashed to the forest floor - several times into the trail itself - leaving massive impact indentations in the soft dirt. We did our share of trail maintenance as we passed though. I was glad we weren’t here on Saturday!We lunched at VA 60 where many SOBOs we’re getting back onto the trail after their night(s) in town. Camp & Crumbs left just before we arrived. Lennon & Grazer were hanging out when we arrived. We walked away with them after sandwiches and Pringles and followed them to the north end of the Brown Mountain Creek valley. The trail was very quiet through the valley. The leaves in the trail were green or wet (or both) and silenced our footsteps. Those steps that were louder than others got washed out by the creek. The breeze was in our faces. I was walking in front and was very aware that the forest I was looking ahead into couldn’t yet see me. “Seeing” is one of the last senses animals detect us with. If they can’t smell you (because you’re downwind) and they can’t hear you (because your steps are silent) then they won’t be looking for you. It’s a stalkers dream. Alas, no fauna were spotted. Texas Pete’s leg continues to get along. We got a better knee brace for it in Lexington and spent some of the morning ironing out the kinks. We’re trying to strike a balance between progress down the trail and rest for his leg. Slackpacking has been a help but his leg hasn’t gotten better with slackpacking. It hasn’t gotten worse, either, but we’d rather not accept the status quo if we can avoid it. As we climbed the last pitch today I thought we might try swapping the Lone Peaks (shoes) Texas Pete is wearing for the Speedgoats that Fish wears. They are on opposite ends of the “cushion” continuum and Texas Pete currently wears the “no cushion” shoe with zero drop. The Speedgoat is all cushion with a 4mm drop. The difference in his knee might be noticeable. We’ll try that tomorrow. Grandie and Grandpa met us at the Punchbowl overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway for a farewell dinner of subway sandwiches, cheese its, and Powerade. “This is a moment in time!”, Grandie told us. It has been a week to remember! We enjoyed the slackpacking, the real food, and the zeros at the KOA with them. We’re now looking forward to a Thanksgiving dinner together. We ate our sandwiches, shouldered our packs now loaded out with winter gear, and headed across the road and back into the woods, waving goodbye from just inside the wood line.","Hog Camp Gap

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658808,"Due to a mix-up in my brain that Joni graciously agreed to, we set alarms last night for 6:30. That is a relatively late hour for us when we’ve got a day like today planned. We had the James River Valley before us which meant a long downhill to the river (2500 feet in 3 miles) followed by an equally long uphill in the south side of the river. 
We got camp packed by 7:00 and had a hot breakfast before leaving camp a little before 8:00. The morning was especially cold and Texas Pete’s leg was slow to warm up. The whole day was slow progress for us. A late start together with slow walking and frequent breaks made for a long day. It was, however, a beautiful day with the James River as the centerpiece. Views from Big Rocky Row cliffs on the north side of the river have us views for the upcoming 5 miles of trail. We could see the river, the railroad trestle we’d cross close by, and the far bank that the trail followed upstream for more than a mile. We passed by (and got passed by) Camp and Crumbs, Lennon & Grazer, and met Indy - a new character- and Hidden, who we had met last night for the first time at Punchbowl Shelter. On the way down to the river, Jordan (North Star’s dad) texted and suggested that I might try to find a physical therapist for Texas Pete in Roanoke. He and Susan are planning on meeting us near Daleville on Thursday (10/6) to spend some time with us and help us along down the trail. I didn’t realize we were so close to Roanoke. I texted a Physical Therapy friend of mine in Dahlonega, Eric, who knew a PT in Roanoke. After some phone call ping-pong, Texas Pete has an appointment Thursday at 4:00. We are thankful for that and hopeful that we can get some answers about the pain in his leg.We took a break under the long railroad trestle that spans the James River. Lennon and Grazer were there. Lennon had just run south to the road here for the past hour in order to meet a shuttle driver who was bringing him a replacement for his Thermarest mattress. He made it in time and had a new mattress to finish the hike on. As we waited under the trestle, a CSX freight train passed overhead. We stood directly underneath the train while is lumbered along no more than 20 feet above us. The trestle doesn’t have a solid roadbed like a bridge so we could see right into the undercarriage of the train. It was awesome and unnerving at the same time.After the train passed we walked to the nearby James River Foot Bridge. It’s a footbridge 1000 feet long dedicated to AT foot traffic. It’s named after a guy whose last name was “Foot”. So it’s a Foot Bridge footbridge.The next mile and a half was along the river heading upstream. It was a pleasant walk between the river and the rock cliffs to our left. The trail turned up a tributary - Matt Creek - and started climbing just after the Matt Creek Shelter. We gained 1100 feet (about halfway up) before stopping at Big Cove Branch stream for dinner. It was about 4:30 and we had 3.2 more miles to cover. Sometimes, when it’s late in the day and we’ve got miles to cover, it’s best to stop for a long break and get dinner in the bellies. It fuels the last miles and saves a camp chore from happening at a late hour. Mountain House for dinner - we’re back into them. The last 3 miles were memorable. We met Ratatouille and Lily as we gained the lip of the ridge. They had set up camp on the side of the trail. We’ve heard of these guys but this was our first face-to-face.  Just after leaving Ratatouille and Lily, as we were side-hilling underneath the ridge it began to rain on us. Not a hard rain but an unexpected one. I suspected it wouldn’t last long but I did don a pack cover in case it decided to intensify. A wind began, coming out of the west, soon after the rain started and pushed the shower further east, beyond the ridge to our left. About the time the wind freshened and the rain stopped, the evening light began to change. The “golden hour” was upon us! The low ceiling of clouds still stretched far to the west. A narrow band of clear sky between the clouds and the far ridges had waxed into a fiery red and orange, casting the same hues into the forest around us. As we watched, the sun slipped below the clouds, still above the horizon, and shone a rich beam of golden light onto the forested hills to our west. The clouds above, lit with colors both known and novel, became an inverted ocean of white-capped breakers rolling to some distant shore. The scene changed continually as we watched. New reds, greens, oranges, lavenders, and colors unnamed took their place on the stage and then melted into their neighbor. The sun jumped the gap between cloud and horizon in a short 5 minutes. As it set, the sky beyond the clouds appeared as a far-off lake or ocean, clear and calm. As sunsets on my life go, I can’t remember one more beautiful.We finally reached our destination at Marble Spring shortly after the sunset. We were disappointed to find all the best tenting spots underneath dead branches - “widowmakers” they’re sometimes called. The wind was growing in intensity. We found two places safe from falling debris and pitched tents. Fishand I threw two lines for bear hangs and hung them PCT-style. We all nestled into our warm bags and prepared for a cold night in this very windy gap. I talked with Jordan on the phone before crawling into the tent and we laid off our rendezvous until Thursday lunchtime. That will allow us to get in about 10 miles Thursday morning and make it to Texas Pete’s PT appointment at 4:00. We’re excited about seeing them, eating out, slackpacking, and the Super 8!","Punchbowl Shelter

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658809,"As I began to retrieve our bear hangs this morning, that which I have feared each time I hang a bag finally came to pass: the bear hang became hung in the tree. Three bags of food hung about 10 feet above the ground and could not be pulled down by the rope.
The simplest hang is a rope thrown over a high branch and then, after the bag is pulled up, the rope is tied off to a nearby tree. This is a pretty easy hang for a bear to defeat (bears are pretty smart) and so I don't really like to use it in bear country. This hang is also nearly impossible to get stuck in a tree. Since we started back southbound, I have made more frequent use of the PCT-style hang. This hang leaves the tensioned parts of the rope well out of reach of any critter on the ground. It is a more difficult hang to hang, but it is more resistant to bears. Without going into too much detail about the details, the hang that I tried to pull down this morning didn't come down. Through a twist of the rope and a careless tug on the same, I effectively locked the bag in place, 10 feet above the ground and well clear of any climbing aids that could be used.I never really panicked. There were 2 days of food for all three boys in the tree but I knew that we weren't leaving that campsite without those bags. Plan A: lash a knife to the end of a sturdy branch and see if I could cut the bags down by slicing through the rope above the bags. My Plan As rarely work but, after about 10 minutes of fiddling, I was able to cut the rope in the most ideal spot. Any spot would have worked but the one I ended up getting couldn't have been chosen better if I'd have climbed a 10 foot stepladder. A little luck always helps Plan A.We moved out of camp not much later than scheduled but it was windy and cold. We skipped a hot breakfast to save time and had Pop Tarts and snacks instead.We passed by The Guillotine and Apple Orchard Mountain today. The former is a novel rock formation - a boulder wedged high between two others the trail passes between. It appears that the high boulder is ready to fall on an unlucky passerby. Apple Orchard Mountain is the northernmost 4000 foot peak in the south. No other peak rises as high until Killington Peak in the Green Mountains of Vermont. It was a climb but one for which we had the mettle.We spent most of the day ""listening"" to Texas Pete's leg and deciding where we should stop. We finally did make it to Bryant Ridge Shelter where Ratatouille had already kindled a fire. North Star set up a tent in which Ninja Squirrel and Fish joined her.

It warmed us up and got the blood flowing. We filled water in Jennings Creek before starting into the woods again.

We loaded up the van and headed into Daleville where we'll spend the next several nights at the Super 8 motel with them.After showers and laundry started, Texas Pete and I got in the van with Granddaddy and headed to the physical therapy appointment in Roanoke. Paige, the therapist, spent over an hour with us checking out TPs leg and offering some suggestions on taping, exercises, and stretches that might help heal his leg as we continue down the trail. We said goodbye after closing time and forgot to pay before we left! I'll call tomorrow.Dinner was at Cracker Barrel where we all ate more calories than should be allowed.

Jasper is listening to Robinson Crusoe for his literature requirements. Crusoe has forsaken his fathers advice, gone to sea, abandoned ship & been saved, and now considers returning home. He writes this:As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately occur’d to me how I should be laugh’d at among the neighbours, and should be asham’d to see, not my father and mother only, but even every body else; from whence I have since often observed, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases, viz. that they are not asham’d to sin, and yet are asham’d to repent; not asham’d of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are asham’d of the returning, which only can make them be esteem’d wise men.We all talked over that quote.

A typical breakfast consists of 3 mugs of hot drink (2 bfast essentials + 1 instant coffee each for Texas Pete, North Star, and me) and 15 packets of grits or oatmeal. Karen and Jackson brought oatmeal cups.
We filtered water for the day and set out in the trail at 8:00. 
The meadow was full of tents last night, probably 10 or more. Tomorrow is Columbus Day so there is a holiday weekend crowd out. We heard a rumor in the trail later in the day that a volunteer counted 58 overnight backpackers leaving the trailhead at VA 311 last night headed north (towards us) to McAffee Knob. 
The trail today crossed Tinker Cliffs and McAffee Knob, 2 of the features on the “Virginia Triple Crown”. We’ll pass the 3rd, Dragons Tooth, fairly early in the day tomorrow.

It was a real treat to spend these past several days with them after being away for 4 months. They are generous people and the hotel rooms and restaurant-eating were real treats. Traveling around in our own van was a special luxury made possible by Jordan’s willingness to get it running again after the battery had died from disuse.
We planned a short day today that would afford a late start and an early finish. Gracie and Ivan, friends from Chestatee, came to meet us this evening and brought dinner. They have been vacationing in southwest VA near Grayson Highlands and drove up to meet us.
We crossed over Dragon’s Tooth today. Baxter lost his own tooth and climbed to the top of this granite spire to cast his small tooth off of this large one. The climb up was surprisingly technical made a little trickier with a full pack. I was glad to be climbing up instead of coming down. “No one ever died falling uphill,” says Bill Irwin, first blind guy to hike the AT.
Gracie and Ivan were at the gravel lot in VA 620 when we arrived about 3:30. Here were more friends after friends. It was good to see them and catch up on our adventures and news from home. They brought a piñata that we spent some time cracking open. Which Wich was dinner. We talked until after dark. 
Several other hikers arrived and camped near us at the road: Two Turtles, Maizey, Nat Geo, Sunset, and Sparrow (formerly Model) who we spent a night with at Gentian Pond Shelter in Maine.

He’s been walking in it for about 400 miles (since the Cobblestone Motel in Waynesboro PA). We’ve taken weight from his pack, cut our miles down, and slowed our pace. The physical therapy exercises have helped warm it up when it gets stiff. We had hoped that we’d see it improve with time and, while it hasn’t really gotten worse, it certainly hasn’t improved.
We’ve decided to take several days off in Pearisburg and get Texas Pete’s leg X-rayed to rule out stress- or avulsion fractures. We’ve stopped for rest twice for 2 days each (Front Royal and Lexington). Neither of those breaks provided lasting relief in his leg.  We’ll stop this time for a longer stretch - maybe as long as 5 days - to see if his body can mend the injury in a meaningful way  
Over the course of the last week I’ve developed a pain in the bottom of my left foot, certainly due to the added weight of the winter gear and my aging shoes. Several days of rest and a new pair should fix that issue speedily.

We were walking just as the dawn was breaking.We met Mantis on the trail this morning. She and Goldie had been with us between Stratton and Monson and then pulled ahead in the 100-mile wilderness. They were planning a wraparound hike from Harper’s Ferry. Goldie ran out of money but Mantis is still on trail. She started the southern part of the hike at Springer in late August.We passed a landfill, crossed the New River on a highway bridge, and arrived at the Pearis Cemetery about 2:15. A call to the hostel had a shuttle to meet us in less than 10 minutes. Dr Pippa “Doc” Chapman owns and runs the Angels Rest Hikers Haven on a rise of land on the north side of town. The view to the southwest is dominated by nearby Pearis Mountain while the ridge that we hiked over to the north can be traded from Rice Field in its southern end nearly to last night’s campsite on the northern. The hostel is a cobbled-together group of house, mobile home, bathhouse, bunkhouse (old garage), various camper trailers and RVs, and a shed - “The Relax Shack” - that will be our home for at least tonight and tomorrow night. Fish and I walked to Food Lion and bought Body Armor drinks. Then we bought pints of Gelato, then bought drinks and snacks for the rest of the crew  Shortly after arriving Doc wrote us a prescript for an X-Ray at the nearby community hospital. Sharon drove Texas Pete and I there and brought us back to the hostel less than an hour later. We’ll have to wait in a radiologist to read the scans and send a report. It’s Friday evening so there’s no telling how long that will take.We all showered and got into loaner clothes. We started a load of laundry and headed to La Barranca for dinner. We stopped by Food Lion on the walk back to the hostel and got some sausage, eggs, and sandwich fixings for tomorrow. The Two Turtles are here in the bunkhouse. “Did you guys lose some clothes on the trail?”, Mr Turtle asked as soon as he saw me. We had, in fact, just started to miss Fish’s zip off pant leg and his new merino wool beanie. I was sure that the beanie was long gone and that the pant leg was stuffed in a brothers pack. “Ms Turtle found a pant leg and a beanie in the trail. We’ve got them in the laundry now.” Incredible. Apparently, each had fallen from Fish’s pack onto the trail. The pant leg had been found yesterday and the beanie today.

I saw you walk out earlier.”“We're here”“I'm at the bus, spoke with Dr. Helvey.”“On my way.”Joni and I headed to the bus.Dr Helvey is a orthopedist-friend of Doc’s. Doc had reached out to him after seeing the X-rays and the radiologist report, curious what his thoughts about our situation were.“Dr Helvey says, based on the X-rays and the symptoms Texas Pete is describing, that he has a hairline fracture in his tibia. He shouldn’t put weight on it for 4 to 6 weeks. Hiking is out of the question.”Joni and I, naturally, had a lot of questions about the leg and the recovery process. Doc had good answers for everything.“What’s your Plan B?”, she asked.Joni and I have thought at length about Plan B. We’ve heard that as few as 1 in 5 aspiring hikers complete a thru hike. Many are forced to quit because of injury. I’ve jokingly said, before we left, that we need a Plan B in case someone breaks a leg.Here we are.Because Joni I and have thought so much about this possibility, the news wasn’t overwhelming or “doomsday” to us. We’ll get the van, put me and Baxter in it, and shadow the “trail-crew” south while they keep logging the miles. In 4(ish) weeks, we’ll try weight on Baxter’s leg and hopefully get back on the trail. Baxter and I will do “van life” for a month.Why me in the van and not Joni? She feels more comfortable - safer - camping in the woods than she does sleeping in the van at a trailhead. Though we will never be far apart, and many nights, I’m sure, will be spent together at road crossings, it’s true that the norm will likely be her in a tent in the trail while I’m in the van at trailhead parking somewhere.Baxter and I both want to come back to Pearisburg next summer and head south, completing the miles we’re missing this fall.

Jasper was as disappointed as he’s ever been, unsure what “success” even looks like anymore. It’s tough talking a team through the hard losses, especially a young team.

Jasper came up with his packet of Maple & Brown Sugar oatmeal, grabbed the covered kettle, and promptly poured coffee into his packet. We had a pot of boiling water for the oatmeal in which you would dip a car camping mug on the other burner. Jasper thought the kettle had the water because you could pour easily from that like we used to before the JetBoil era. I took his packet and ate it. Delicious! It tasted like tiramisu.

We were in our old Copper Spur 3 person. We packed up and had sausage and eggs for breakfast. The trail crew started hiking while me and dad drove down into Burke’s Garden to see the Varmint of Burke’s Garden, a piece of history from that area. The story was that there was this beast that was killing sheep in 1952. It was only killing them though, not eating them like a normal animal would. After around 410 sheep had been killed, the farmers got together and hired a professional hunter, who tracked and killed the beast. It turned out to be a larger-than-normal coyote. We pulled into the museum in Tazewell that held the animal, which had been stuffed. It was disappointingly small, but still interesting. It was on display with a plethora of other animals, most of which looked a little smaller than they should be. There was the hide of a massive black bear named Old Hitler, who had done much the same thing as the Varmint. After buying a few necessities at the Grant’s grocery we toured Tazewell for a while. We drove around Burke’s Garden to the south end to Bear Garden Hostel. It had a nice bunkhouse/lounge where dad planned our next week or so of camping while I drew and FaceTimed some of my friends.

We enjoy each other’s company and are fueled by one another’s energy. The idea to at we’d split into 2 different teams is way out of the norm.Baxter and I really do enjoy one another. I’m sure the trail crew would say the same about each other. But it is hard for he and I to not miss our trail friends.Thankfully, I think we are as prepared as we could possibly be for this new adventure. We have spent hundreds of summer road-trip days living out of our van. We’ve also spent hundreds of nights camping and backpacking in the backcountry. We have (very recently) spent 140 nights thru hiking the AT together. All this “practice” has left us well prepared for this most-unlikely adventure.I am thankful for all that “practice”.Joni is the hero of all this - the MVP. I know many families in which the father could, and would,live the van life with his kid for 6 weeks. I know many boys who would eagerly leave life and try the thru-hiking adventure. By contrast, I know only 1 or 2 moms who might be willing to hike 30+ days through 450 miles of mountainous forest with 2 of her sons. “No thanks”, would be an understandable answer to the proposition. But, instead of folding, or finding an “easier” way to do this, she went all in and is really killing it. We are living reversed roles during these weeks and I’m playing keep-up to her pacesetting.All in all, we are still having a great time. This is still a fun adventure with valuable lessons and lasting memories for all of us. The time we’ve been able to spend as a family can’t be matched in “normal” life. We’ll keep to the plan and see this through to the end.Baxter and I, perhaps Grayson, too, get to come back next summer and do a long-distance hike again.The trail crew got off around 7:40 after what turned out to be a harried morning trying to get out of our little house. I squared up with Birdie in the bunkhouse at 8:00 and got directions to her church. Baxter and I planned on joining them in Bland for Sunday school and worship. He and I pulled out early in the van headed east on 42 towards Bland.As we got to town, Little Calves texted:“Hey skipper, I have gotten some sort of tonsil infection that has progressed to the point that I can’t eat solid foods, so I’m heading to the nearest highway at Dickey Gap, VA650. Is there any chance you are close by, and could help me get to an urgent care?”I called Birdie to let her know we wouldn’t be at church and Baxter and I pointed the van south towards Dickey Gap - a 40ish minute drive east and south.We spent much of the day in Abingdon - after discovering the urgent care in Marion had closed - waiting for LC to be seen and diagnosed. Walmart, Subway, and a shady bench at Abingdon High School passed the time. We tried our hand at whittling using bars of Ivory soap and butter knives with satisfying results.LC got a prescription and elected to stay with us for the night at Lindamood School House. The pain in his mouth is getting worse and he’s like to see if the antibiotics are able to make any progress in the coming hours before getting back in trail. The AT between Dickey Gap and Damascus turns south, away from the interstate and the towns of Marion and Abingdon. It would be a tough place to be stuck with an infection for 3 days.We arrived at Lindamood Schoolhouse about 4:45. The trail crew was there along with Twiglet. The schoolhouse is part of The Settlers Museum, a collection of farm buildings from the 1890s. The community of volunteers allows hikers to stay in the schoolhouse and camp in the adjacent yard. We set up tents and I started a pot of soup on the Coleman stove. We whittled, map-checked, and relaxed until the sun set and the stars shone brightly.","VA 42, Bear Garden Hostel

After a breakfast of sausage, eggs, and grits the hikers left about 7:40. The morning was very cold and, having camped in a grassy field under open skies, our tents were very wet inside and out. Baxter, LC, and I hung out for awhile to allow the tents to dry out a bit before packing them away in the van.LC is headed to Marion today. The Merry Inn is a new hostel there that he’ll stay at tonight. We dropped him off, played a game of chess at the cafe next door, visited Verizon, ate at Subway, and filled the right rear tire with air. I couldn’t spot the puncture but there must be one. I’ve resolved to take the wheel off tomorrow to investigate. After finishing our business in Marion, we headed south towards a rendezvous with the trail crew.We chose a campground for our next two nights that is convenient to 2 days’ trailheads. Slabtown Road is today’s endpoint and Fox Creek will be tomorrow’s. Raccoon Branch is a campground about 20 minutes from both if these trailheads. We’ll only have to set up camp once for 2 nights.We met the hikers at VA 670, one mile before the day’s end. Bulldog and Mango Mamba showed up just before Ninja Squirrel. We passed out beverages, took everyone’s pack into the van, and drove around to meet them on Slabtown Road. Bulldog and MM continued to the shelter while we headed to Raccoon Branch.

I do think that our spot here on the lee side of the mountain was a better choice that staying in Elk Garden last night. The wind was funneling through there yesterday afternoon and probably continued through the night.
Our camping spot was 2.5 trail miles south of Elk Garden. North Star and Fish were content with skipping those miles and setting off south from the campsite. Ninja Squirrel wanted to do the miles. I agreed to pick him up at the bottom of the hill and deliver him back to our camp spot. He'd then be chasing NS and Fish who would have about an hour head start on him.
We packed up the van and got a hot breakfast into everyone's tummies. The trail crew set off in their different directions as the clouds began to burn off above us. Baxter and I drove higher up the mountain to see the sunrise. We were not disappointed! The clouds were racing south, riding the wind coming through the gap at Elk Garden. As we watched, the earth dipped it's eastern horizon to reveal the glowing eye of the sun, at first only a slit of brilliant orange through a rent in the clouds. As we watched, the full sphere cleared the distant low ceiling and shed a warm glow over the cloud-sea below us. This happens every morning somewhere! I could become a sunrise chaser and live happily.
We pulled into Elk Garden just as NS was walking into the gap. We delivered him back to the campsite and set him on his way south. ""If you break your ankle,"" I counseled, ""just lay there and enjoy the view. Someone will be along soon.""

Baxter and I left Elk Garden headed north back to Damascus. We spent the morning at the coffee shop playing chess. I adopted a ""stop losing"" strategy that seems to be working. We visited Damascus Outfitters, ate lunch at Pizza Plus, and spent some time at the public library using the internet.
We headed out to meet the trail crew just after 2:00. Through some miscommunication, we ended up waiting on them about a quarter mile away from them. They had taken the Virginia Creeper Trail, a blue blaze, to a parking area. After we didn't show up (and knowing neither of us had cell service) North Star made a new plan. She knew we could spot their location on the Garmin. Since they had plenty of daylight left and the Creeper Trail leading to Damascus was an easy walk, she decided they'd walk the 4 miles into town. Ninja Squirrel elected to stick to the AT, a longer route with more elevation change. Everything worked out in the end and we were all back in the van around 5:30 headed into Abingdon for a zero day tomorrow.
We ate dinner at a El Bigote (The Mustache) and checked into the Quality Inn for a killer night's sleep.","Elk Garden, VA 600

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659290,"Today began month number 6 on the trail. We are all feeling it. I met a hiker who told me they had come out here for a mental break and instead they got a mental challenge. We have all had a good, long mental break but we are certainly in the mental challenge stage now. Ninja Squirrel is frustrated at our slow pace. Fish has slowed down dramatically without Texas Pete and I on the trail. North Star is tired physically and mentally. Texas Pete is teetering on boredom (and doing it like a champ!). I miss the trail and the rhythm of the thru hike.  Van Life is going great but it’s not the same as the woods. 
“I went to the van because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life.” No. 
“At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of van life.” No. 
“Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the van is going home; that van life is a necessity.”  No.
“A van is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit, and as vital to our lives as water and good bread.” No. 
I welcome this challenge, though. While I envy hikers like Tin Man, who slowed his pace intentionally once he reached Vermont in order to stretch out his experience, I would feel cheated, in a way, if we arrived at Springer having never really faced the mental challenge of the trail. The funk we now face isn’t a rejection of the trail but, instead, a desire to return to the New York spring, the Vermont Mountains, the Maine wilderness, the Pennsylvania ridges. As the days get shorter, the temperatures colder, and the miles skinnier, we daydream of home ahead and the miles behind. This seems to be the paradox that all thru hikers face: The desire to either be finished or to be just starting, but to somehow skip the last push of the trail. 
As we stepped into the 100 mile wilderness, Poet left us with a haiku. I’ve written about how I felt like an intruder in that wilderness and so, at the time, I tucked this away for later. Now is later. 
Drink your deepest now. 
For the sweetest stuff settles

There is wisdom here. There will be a lot of sweetness in this final stint. 
We awoke to a killer continental breakfast at the Hampton Inn. The boys are big fans of a continental breakfast. There may have been some baked goods and fruit in pockets when we left. 
We drove 40 minutes back out to Wilbur Dam Road and put the trail crew back on the trail. 
Then we slow-rolled through Hampton and southward to Dennis Cove Road. 
We had camp set up by 10:30 and brewed some coffee and hot chocolate for any SOBOs that came through. The first of the day came through at 12:00. 
Stoneage had stayed at Boots Off Hostel last night for Halloween. He had 2 cups of hot chocolate and packed out a Mountain Dew. Shortly behind him was Soups, then, after he left, Last Minute. Roots arrived at 2:30, just before the trail crew showed up. He hiked on while we stayed. 
The two turtles joined us for dinner while they debated whether or not to go to Bob People’s Kinkorra hostel just up the road. The reviews on Far Out made the prospect of staying there seem like a gamble. 
I invited them to ride with me to his hostel so I could fill up our 4 gallon jugs with water. We met Bob - a character from a trail era gone by - and got our water filled. In the end, they were glad to camp with us at Dennis Cove.

When we were cranking out miles this past summer the color would hit the forest before 6:30. Now it’s well after 7:30 before hiking without a headlamp is a sure bet. 
We packed up personal gear and went inside The Refuge for coffee and breakfast. There were many options in the freezer including waffles and breakfast sandwiches. After eating and packing up tents we rolled out about 8:00 and headed back up to Walnut Mountain Road for the morning drop off. 
Baxter and I set out on a scouting mission. We drove through Roan Mountain State Park and up to Carvers Gap, the next major road crossing after US 19 (today’s pickup point). Our hometown chiropractor and family cheerleader Dr Todd is meeting us on Saturday afternoon. Baxter and I were looking for a good meet up spot and a place to camp that night. Unfortunately, Carvers Gap is a “no camping” area. We were able to find a roadside picnic spot that could work. We drove down to the State Park Campground to scout the possibilities there but all the camping was filled up for the weekend.
We returned to Roan Mountain and settled into a booth at Bobs Dairyland again. We enjoyed coffee for about an hour while drawing maps of the AT states. We headed out to the trailhead about 1:00 in time to shuttle a northbound section hiker to Mountain Harbor. Grayson was walking to the road just as we returned.

The day was dreary but not raining or cold at the trailhead. They planned on hiking 14.5 miles to Carvers Gap where we'd pick them up and take them to a camping spot. Camping isn't permitted in the gap itself. Baxter and I headed back through Roan Mountain, TN and started up Carvers Gap Road. We had settled on hanging out at the gap for the day passing out trail magic and seeing if we could help anyone. On the way past the state park, I swung in to see if there was an off chance they'd have a camping spot for Saturday night on short notice. When I had driven through here Thursday they had none available. Due to the less-than-ideal weather, there was one spot open! I paid $17 for it and left the office pumped up! This was only 8 miles south of the trail and we could set up tents here before going to the gap. Baxter and I headed over to site 23 and put up our two tents. We returned to the office in the van to send Joni a text letting her know the plan.
As I was writing the text message she called. It was 10:59am.There was loud wind in the background. ""We can't make it to Carvers Gap. The wind is gusting over 40 miles per hour. We can't walk through it in some places. We need to turn around and go back to 19.""
""How far from 19 are you?""
""Six-and-a-half miles.""
""Are you safe where you are right now?""
""Yes. Just getting a little cold in the wind. We're better when we're moving.""
""Let me check the map for a minute or two and see what the best plan is for getting you guys out. I'll call right back.""
I hung up and studied the road atlas and the AT Guide. I had heard Ninja Squirrel in the background of the call suggest Yellow Mountain Gap. It was 2.5 miles ahead of them. The atlas and my digital maps showed roads almost all the way to the gap on both sides of the ridge. I called back.
""I'll meet you in Yellow Gap. I'll be there before 12:00. Can you make it there?""
""We can.""
Baxter and I set off for the gap. The weather in the valley was fine but we could see the ridge above us covered in clouds. It looked calm enough but the phone call told a different story. The mountains were getting raked by strong winds from Hump Mountain to perhaps past Big Bald, 30 miles south. Our first attempt was to drive to the gap from the west side of the trail (compass north). We got to within about three-quarters of a mile before being stopped by a gate, ostentatiously overdone with signs warning of the dangers of trespassing. We turned around and started the 30-minute drive to the other side of the ridge. We passed the put-in spot for the day on 19 and headed up Roaring Creek Road to the Overmountain Victory Trailhead. It was raining and windy in the trees at the end of the road. I left Baxter in the car and jogged the half-mile uphill past the gate. I came out in the field around the Overmountain Shelter. The shelter is an old, red barn used by hikers for years as a shelter. It sleeps perhaps 40 people and looked old and rugged in the foggy field. I turned up the blue-blazed trail there towards the AT and came into Yellow Mountain Gap. I expected the trail crew there by now and, after some up-and-down nearby trails, found Joni waiting for me at the gap. She and the trail crew had taken a side-trail from the gap to the parking lot and had missed me as I went up the gravel road. No harm done. Everyone was safe in the van.
We cranked the defrosters and rolled slowly back down Roaring Creek Road. The pictures and videos they brought back were nuts. We saw some video taken by friends of our just a few miles ahead that was equally awesome. She made a good call to get out.
Back at the State Park the weather was fine. No wind. No rain. No sunshine. It was quiet. 
Our friend, Dr Todd, from Dahlonega was there at the state park to meet us. He had his two boys with him. We hung out in the pavilion with them for the dinner hour. The rain started in and we were glad to have a cover over our heads. Dr Todd is a chiropractor and came to dole out massages and adjustments to everyone. They also brought chocolate from Paul Thomas and The Fudge Factory - Dahlonega establishments. He had good advice about Baxter's leg and offered to help however he could. It was great to get time with a friend from home!
We enjoyed a trail dinner. We checked the forecast for tomorrow and decided to pick up where we left off today. It was a good end to a day with a rough morning. We were all excited to have conquered it.","US 19

They had Unaka Mountain and Beauty Spot on the map today. The walk is again above clouds along a high ridge and, unfortunately, looks like it will be cloud-covered most of the day. Thankfully the winds that pushed them off the trail two days ago aren't forecasted to return soon.
Baxter and I left Greasy Creek and headed to Erwin via Iron Mountain Gap on NC 226. We crossed into Tennessee and soon found ourselves through Unicoi and into Erwin. We scouted Erwin for only a short time before heading back up the road to Indian Grave Gap, where the trail crew was planning on ending the day. We turned left onto Beauty Spot Road and drove the gravel to Beauty Spot. The high knob has a parking lot less than 100 yards from the grassy bald. We parked and took chairs and entertainment up the short trail, making a place in the fog where we'd sit for the next several hours. We read, whittled, talked with hikers, made hot chocolate, and caught fleeting glimpses of the forest around us and the views beyond.

A rain settled in just before lunch and we gather up our things and hurried back to the car. We pointed the van further up the road towards Unaka Mountain with an aim to cut off the trail crew as they came through Beauty Spot Gap. We met Miss Janet in her van as we were going down the road and chatted for a bit. She invited us to her hostel for the evening and we exchanged phone numbers. We parked in Beauty Spot Gap and waited for the crew to arrive. We were able to track their hike over Unaka on the GPS. ""Unaka"" is pronouced YOO-nuh-kuh by folks from afar, yoo-NAH-kah by Erwin city-folk, and yoo-NAH-ker by Erwin country-folk. 
As we waited we were passed several times in both directions by bear hunters in their pickup trucks. These trucks were all smaller model Tacomas and Rangers and had high-end dog kennels in the beds. Each kennel held from 3 to 6 dogs, all hanging out doggy portholes in the sides. These dogs each wear a radio tracking collar and are turned loose into the woods in packs ranging in size from 4 up to more than a dozen. They find a bear's scent in the woods and track it over many miles. The hunters follow along in trucks on woods roads. When the dogs find a bear they give chase. The bear ""trees"" and the dogs surround the base of the tree. The hunters wade into the woods to where the dogs are and finish the hunt with a rifle. We saw one bad-luck-bear on the top of one of these kennels.
The trail crew arrived in great spirits about 1:30. We chatted for a bit (as we drove the 2 miles back to Beauty Spot on the road that parallels) and arrived at the top of Beauty Spot together with views in all directions. I took Fish's pack in the van and they headed south on the trail towards Indian Grave Gap. Baxter and I drove.
While walking through the 100 mile wilderness in August, I met Farther Along on the trail as she walked south towards Jo Mary Road. She would finish a 24 year section hike of the Appalachian Trail that day! We were all  excited for her and traded stories as we rested. We later spent the night with her at the 100-Mile Wilderness Inn. She offered to meet us on our way through North Carolina and bring us dinner on the trail if we kept her posted on our progress. Tonight was the night that we'd be closest to her home near Pigeonroost, NC. We planned on meeting her at Indian Grave Gap at 4:00.
Farther Along met Baxter and I at 3:30. As the trail crew arrived in the predictable order (NinjaSquirrel, North Star, Fish), she pulled out a table and set a spread worthy of a Free Will Baptist Covered Dinner. Meatballs, Pasta, Salad, Sodas, and Dessert were a real treat. As we talked she showed us pictures of the shed she's been converting to a bunk room. In the end, we all decided to follow her back to her place in Pigeonroost and stay the night. A short 20 minutes in the car brought us through another beautiful nook of the Appalachians, down to the North Toe River just above it's confluence with the Cane River. We turned up Pigeonroost Creek and were at Farther Along's mountain home in no time. The boys took up residence in the ""bunk room"" while Joni and I pitched a tent on the grass outside. We talked around a campfire that Ninja Squirrel built until the late hour of 8:00 pm.

We got our package and headed into town about 9:00. We visited the leather & saddle store looking for a whetstone. Then we went to the gear store downtown where we talked with Chris about the prospects of camping at Spivey Gap.We returned to Uncle Johnnys at 11:00 with Pal’s hamburgers and fries and ate lunch with the trail crew. It was a good hour break together. They headed back out for another 10 miles just after 1:00. Baxter and I sat around a little longer talking with the hikers there (Back Track, Chef Boyardee, owner Terry) and waited in Lennon and Grazer to show up. We didn’t see the latter until we were driving out across the bridge. We stopped to say hello. They are planning on staying the night at Uncle Johnnys.  After lunch we headed to the town post office to meet its resident cat. Then to the library where there was another resident cat. We spent about an hour there. Baxter and I have been passing the time with some different hobbies. I’ve taken to whittling while he reads on his Kindle. We’re studying for our Technician Class Amateur Radio license. We’re perfecting our drawing of the AT States Map showing the trail and major trail towns. We set up at trailheads and pass out hot and cold drinks to hikers coming through. We tour the small towns. We bought a bullwhip at the leather store today. We hope to have some newfound skills to show for our time spent together in the van.We went by Uncle Johnnys one last time as we were leaving town to fill our gallon water jugs and then pointed the headlights towards Spivey Gap. We cooked dinner at the roadside parking in Spivey Gap. There was suitable camping there about 100 yards from the van. I’m uneasy camping near the paved road with the van in plain sight. Catalytic converter thefts are a thing and, while none of the locals seem worried about it, I’d rather not have to deal with that. So we loaded up the van and drove about a mile back into the woods towards Devils Fork Gap where the trail crew had been less than an hour before coming out of the woods. We parked the van on the side of the road and set up a tent on either side of the road. I’d much rather sleep next to the van on a disused road like this than sleep 100 yards away while the van is parked on a paved lot. The sun sets before 5:30 nowadays.

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659386,"After the sun set last night the wind picked up. We were in a fairly sheltered gap but the noise in the trees overhead all night is unnerving. Thankfully, the forest seemed stronger here than it did in Shenandoah, where we spent a very windy, sleepless night in late September.When we awoke this morning the wind had not abated. It was chilly and the wind was a biting, heat-stealing wind. We packed up our things inside the tents and started getting them to the van. Properly stowing the tents was near impossible in the gusts so I gently rolled them and got them into the box-top on the van. I'd later get them correctly rolled and stuffed in Spivey Gap. We loaded the van in short order and drove the 10 minutes back down to Spivey Gap where the wind was non-existent and we could eat breakfast in peace. The trail crew headed out after the normal grits/oatmeal/coffee regimen.Baxter and I left Spivey Gap and drove to the bottom of the hill where we were able to get cell service. Interstate 26 was in the valley and the cell providers blanket the interstate corridors with strong signal. We sat at an abandoned roadside market and, using trail book and road atlas, laid out a plan for the next 10 days or so. If all goes according to our plan (HA!) we can be in Davenport Gap, northern doorstep of the Smokey Mountains, by Wednesday the 19th. The Smokies are a pretty dicey section of trail that requires careful planning and smart decisions. Not only are we required to carry permits through this section (necessitating a plan), the natural features of the park create an obstacle unique to the trail in the south and, in my opinion, unmatched anywhere on the trail outside of the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Both the White Mountains and the Smoky Mountains are high peaks, rising several thousand feet above their neighboring ranges. This makes them both prone to quick and unpredictable changes in weather. The Smokies have the added hazard to hikers of being an especially remote section of trail, and of wilderness more generally. Tricorner Knob Shelter, where we plan on spending the night in the Smokies, is in the middle of a 75-square mile swath of true wilderness, accessible only by foot and horseback. It's not the kind of trail that a hiker can just ""wing it"" through.We left our roadside planning session and drove to Sam's Gap where I-26 crosses the trail. Miss Janet had dropped off a hiker this morning at Spivey Gap while we ate breakfast and recommended the cemetery here as a good camping spot for the evening. Sure enough, high on the hill next to the interstate is a family cemetery. Hidden from the view of the road and the interstate is a small-but-flat spot where we could park the van and pitch two tents. The AT is just a stone's throw down the hill. Baxter and I hung out in the gap for awhile at the trailhead parking studying ham radio test questions and trying to crack our new bullwhip. We decided, about 11:00, that we needed to go to Hot Springs. We have two packages at the Hot Springs post office waiting for us. Today is Thursday. Tomorrow is Veterans Day. Then the weekend. Our next chance to get the packages will be Monday. So we decided, since we weren't doing anything important here, we'd head towards Hot Springs to see what we could see there. The packages were at the post office, both from Granddaddy and Gigi: a resupply box of food and an ""entertainment box"" for Baxter and me. More books and magazines to pass the time. Gold.We spent some time at the Hot Springs Library surfing the internet.We drove back to Sam's Gap just about the time the trail crew was arriving. They knocked out the 13 miles in short time and we were all at the cemetery before 3:00, enjoying a hot midafternoon snack. We set up tents and relaxed for the rest of the day.

The movie documents the 18-month story drawing from his journal entries and an on-camera interview with him. I love to see people get really nerdy about the things they love. This guy out-nerds everyone except maybe Jane Goodall when it comes to wildlife biology. He made it personal about two-thirds of the way through the hour-long film. He looked at the interviewer and said:
We do not have a privileged access to reality. So many of us live either in the past or in the future - and betray the moment. And in some sense we forget to live our lives - and the wild turkeys were always reminding me to live my life. I think as humans we have this peculiar predisposition to be always thinking ahead - living a little bit in the future - anticipating the next minute, the next hour, the next day - and we betray the moment. Wild turkeys don’t do that. They are convinced that everything that they need, all their needs, will be met only in the present moment and in this space. The world is not better half mile through the woods, it’s not better an hour from now, and it’s not better tomorrow - that this is as good as it gets. So they constantly reminded me to do better, and to not live in this abstraction of the future, which by definition will never exist. And so we sort of betray our lives in the moment and the wild turkeys reminded me to be present, to be here.
I was taken aback. Here was real wisdom about our own experience delivered by an unlikely source at nearly the perfect time. We. all five (except maybe Grayson - he's loving every minute), are living in this strange limbo of not wanting to finish the trail but wanting to be home. Some of us may put it into words differently than this but that characterization of our feeling isn't too far off the mark. We are, in a sense, betraying the moment. While Joe's insight here leaves a great deal to be said about hope, about future expectations for positive change, it touches me in a spot that needed a reminder. My world won't be appreciably better in an hour, in a day, or even in several months. This is pretty close to ""as good as it gets"". These last few weeks have put us all thinking about the future - an abstraction. There is a strong tendency, among most of the thru hikers we've met, to betray the moments so close to the end. 
The boys were only half paying attention and Joni was in a separate room. As we all six were sitting in Nancy's small common room that evening getting ready for lights out, I read this quote again to the group. This one will stick with me. Thank you Joe Hutto, Florida man.
Back to the trail tomorrow. It's about to get cold.","Right Here

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659389,"Rained all day until nightfall. I cooked dinner under a tarp slung up over the opened tailgate of the van. We considered heading into town for accommodations but decided against because we are so far away from anywhere here. We are at the end of Viking Mountain Road. It's 8 graveled miles back to the highway and even then, we're halfway between Marshall, NC and Greenville, TN. That description even sounds like the middle of nowhere. So we hunkered down. We're camped at the edge of a large meadow with a strip of paved road running between a high point to the east and Camp Creek Bald to our west. 
The forecast says 21 degrees for the morning. We're at elevation so I won't be surprised if it turns our colder than forecast. I'm not worried about being cold tonight since we've all got the right gear but I'm thinking about the morning - getting out of the tent to ice and chill isn't ever the funnest part of the trip.","Devil's Fork Gap
",Jones Meadow,"Nov 12, Sat",13.90
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659390,"We awoke to a meadow encased in rime ice and cloud. The temperature was 21 degrees. 
The temperature had dropped below freezing last night before the rain 
turned to sleet and snow and had created a layer of ice on both tents. I
was worried that the weight of the ice along with the gusty wind might 
pull a stake out of the ground and leave the tent on top of us. The 
Triplex depends on 6 well-placed stakes to hold it up. With all this on my mind, I had gotten out of the tent about 2:00 to scrape ice from the Triplex. A light, dry sleet was falling and I was able - with the help of the plastic top from the snack bin - to get the ice off the tent and re-tighten the guy lines. When I tried to do the same to the Copper Spur, Fish and North Star protested that I was knocking ice on the inside of the tent onto them. I left their tent ""unscraped"". When I got out of the tent this morning at 6:30, the the Copper Spur was frozen closed with a thick sheet of ice.
I started the van and got into the backseat where I set up the JetBoil. I had water boiling in 10 minutes and had started to line breakfast choices up inside the van. I helped Fish out of the ice-domed tent and he joined me in the van. By 7:30, all 5 of us were inside the van enjoying the warmth. The sun rose a little after 7:00 but was hidden behind the thick veil of clouds. The trail crew got packs ready and we drove them down the gravel road about 200 yards to a side-trail that led back to the AT. They would head for Tanyard Gap today.
Baxter and I returned to the campsite and packed up: sleeping bags, sleeping pads, pillows, errant clothes, tents, and poles. Dante never mentions frozen tent poles when describing the 3rd circle of hell but I'm certain it's because their presence is an obvious fact. The aluminum tent poles to the Copper Spur were murder on my hands. I returned to the van twice to rewarm them in the short time it took to strike the tent and collapse the poles. The rain fly, still encased in ice, was another challenge. Baxter and I ended up making a pile of groundsheets, rainfly, and tent bodies in the back of the van.
We left Jones Meadow and headed for lower ground. After a short drive down the mountainside the ice disappeared though the temperature remained in the low 20s. Baxter and I parked the van on Log Cabin Road, 6 miles south on the trail and 2000 feet lower. I spread out all of the tent fabrics and broke up most of the ice still caked on the rain fly. Baxter and I talked with a local out walking his dog who was interested in our ice-covered van. The trail crew showed up about 11:00 and took a warm break in the van for a moment. The temperature still had not gotten into the 30s.
We parted ways with the trail crew and headed towards Hot Springs. I had called Laughing Heart Hostel and gotten us 2 rooms for the night. We checked in at the hostel and lounged for awhile. The trail crew wasn't due into Tanyard Gap until about 4:30. The Moore family was planning on arriving in Hot Springs around 2:00. 
The 5 Moores came to the hostel right on time. We have only a handful of families where everyone is friends with everyone. The Moores are one of our favorites! Emma, Clare, Gus, and Baxter got into a game of Uno while Doug, Naomi, and I walked into town to visit the outfitter and the post office. I was expecting a package in both places. It was good to catch up with friends and debrief our trail experience with them a bit. The outfitter had a letter for us and Joni's down pants were waiting at the Hot Springs post office (thanks Mr Nomad!).
We all loaded up the vehicles about 4:00 and headed to Tanyard Gap to meet the trail crew. They had hiked a long day through tough terrain and in temperatures that may never have gotten above freezing. The greeting of friends put much of the day's troubles to rest. We returned to the hostel and dumped packs and gear and headed into town to Vinyl Pies, a pizza place on main street.
We got a visit at Vinyl Pies from a second family from the group of ""families where everyone is friends with everyone"". The four of the five Schnitzers arrived for dinner making our group 14 strong. We all laughed and cut up until it got late (8:00pm) and we all said our goodbyes and headed home.","Jones Meadow

Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659440,"Baxter stayed at the hostel this morning while I dropped the trail crew off at Tanyard Gap. They hiked south back to the hostel (which is practically on the trail). After lunch, I drove them to Garenflo Gap, south of Hot Springs, and they hiked north back to the hostel again. We ate dinner at Smoky Mountain Diner. Baxter and I spent some time at the library today. He fiddled around with Scratch, a programming website, while I printed out Smoky Mountain permits and caught up on the journal.","Tanyard Gap
",Garenflo Gap,"Nov 14, Mon",12.50
Skipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659441,"I had to sneak into the bunkroom at Laughing Heart this morning to retrieve our tents. I had hung them on bunks and chairs last night so they could dry out overnight. After we had gone to bed, several more hikers arrived. One had taken a bunk in the bunkroom along with my tents. In retrospect, I shouldn't have assumed we would be the only hikers at the hostel. Bad form.
The crew started the day in the rain and cold at Garenflo Gap. We met them along the way at Lemon Gap, 8.8 miles in. Just before the crew arrived, I pitched a tarp across the back of the van and made a pot of instant soup. The rain set in as they arrived for an early lunch. They lingered at the van for awhile, hoping the rain would abate but, in the end, set out again in a moderate drizzle. Baxter and I waited a little longer before breaking down ""camp"" hoping the rain would let up but it didn't. I shook off the wet tarp, wrapped it up, and put it in the back of the van before heading to Max Patch.
Baxter and I started our study of Morse Code.
I hiked up to the summit of socked-in Max Patch - another great view and epic trail location that the trail crew would miss due to soupy weather.
When the trail crew arrived at Max Patch around 2:30 they were done. They stopped about 3 miles early today, wet, cold, and tired. We headed to the Best Western in Newport TN.
Everyone ordered their dinner of choice and I went to fetch them: Ninja Squirrel and Fish ordered Chinese, Texas Pete ordered Papa John's pizza, and North Star ordered salad and sandwich from WalMart. I settled for leftovers (of which there were plenty). We did laundry and settled into warm beds.","Garenflo Gap

He came to help us crack into the Smoky Mountain National Park. We left the van at the hostel and headed to Pigeon Forge Hampton Inn for the night. In the morning, he and Baxter will drop the four of us off at Newfound Gap and we'll hike NORTH towards the van. The two of them will go home to Gainesville. We won't see Baxter again until Thanksgiving Day (seven days from now).","Brown Gap
