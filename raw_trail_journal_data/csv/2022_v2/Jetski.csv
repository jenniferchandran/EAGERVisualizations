Jetski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646190,"I am finally retiring after 50 years of working, man it feels good to say goodbye.  As for the AT, I started a section hike with my son's Boy Scout troop back in 1994.  We backpacked a 60 mile section in the Nantahala National Forest and I fell in love with it.  I had backpacked a lot in college, mostly in the Rockies, but did one trip in the Smokies.  Also, my friends and I canoed many of the North Carolina whitewater rivers in the Smokies each summer during college.
After a second trip with the Boy Scouts, I wondered why I couldn't venture out to other sections of the trail, so I purchased the AT trail guide that included the Smoky Mountain National Park.  So, my two sons and I started our journey of continuing north on the AT.  We hiked north from the Nantahala river into Smoky Mountain National Park and ended at Clingman's Dome.  Then we hiked from Clingman's Dome to the other end of the park.  Finally, after two more sections, my second son wound up at Georgia Tech.  This set us up to do the beginning section of the AT.  A few more sections, and I was in Harper's Ferry, WV, where the AT office is located.  Each section had to be well planned along with shuttles coordinated, daily mileages made, resupply points and such.  All this was done without knowing much about the area I was hiking.  After doing a section or two of planning, the other sections got easier to plan and execute.
Finally, my son went to grad school at MIT, so now new areas were within reach.  So we did the Presidential Range in New Hampshire.  Later, I went back and did all of Vermont and southern New Hampshire.  This left two big chunks of trail unexplored, Pennsylvania and Maine.  Time got scarce in the last five years for hiking since I was now coaching a high school cross country team.  But, all of that will come to an end when I start my AT journey in March, 2022.",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Thu",0
Jetski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646203,"I didn't realize how much work it was going to take just to start this hike.  Getting the gear ready is a no brainer, but setting up a journal page takes a lot of work.  First, you have to pick a site to host your journal.  Once that is done, all the details of entering your gear list, double checking your weights, then second guessing if what you have is the right thing for the trail.  So, after all of that, then you figure out, just go with what you have always used and if you are not happy with it, you can change mid stream.  There are several points along the trail where you can get gear, good gear.  For example, just your second day brings you to a gear shop right on the trail.  If that's not good enough, in about a week you will be at NOC, another good gear shop.  By the time you get to the middle of the GSMNP, you can hitch a ride into Gatlinburg and check out some other gear shops.  And just a few days more and you end up in Hot Springs,TN. and guess what, more gear.  So, don't overthink what you have and what works unless you are really not happy with it.  Because there are lots of opportunities to change your gear.  Just don't change your mind about this trail thing.  You know,  it's going to be work, lots of work to move yourself up this trail.  Just enjoy what you have and see if it gets the job done for you.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sat",0
Jetski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646421,"Ok, so I have been telling my friends that when I retire, I plan to take a hike, a really long hike.  About a 2200 mile hike to be exact.  I plan to start a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail at the end of March.  And the number one question I have been asked is ""Am I going alone?"".  So, my usual answer is yes, I am going alone, but I will not be alone.  There will be about 40 other hikers that start the AT each day, so I won't be alone.  Then they ask ""How long is that going to take?""  So, it should take between 4 and 6 months.  At this point, they think I am off my rocker and you can see that look in their eyes, like they are talking to a total stranger.  So, I have to calm then down and reassure them that I have at least done this before and everything is going to be all right.  Some of the other questions are ""How do you carry that much food?  or ""How do you cook?"" or ""Are you going to carry a gun for protection?"".  So, I am sure many of the other would-be thru hikers are getting the same questions, and many more.  But, don't worry, it's a new beginning and we all face questions about that.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Thu",0
