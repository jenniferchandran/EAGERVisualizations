Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649228,"The last day has been a rush of checklists, bubble wrap, and duffel bags.  Made it to the airport and checked the bag.  Hopefully my pack arrives in Wash DC in one piece.  No bent trekking poles or a broken umbrella.  Or even worse…pulverized biscottis. From DC, I catch a trail to Harpers Ferry. The photo is the dome ceiling of the DC Union Station.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Wed",0
Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649333,Stayed at Towns Inn in Harpers Ferry last night. Picked up a thru-hikers tag at the ATC headquarters this morning.  Funny that they are there to serve hikers but don’t open until 10 am. Got on the trail at 11 am. It rained lightly off and on all afternoon. No wind so good weather for a trekking umbrella.,"Harpers Ferry, WV

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649399,"If I had been a history major you would now be looking at a photo of the original Washington Monument near Boonesboro, MD. But instead, you get a photo of the moldering privy at the Rocky Run Shelter. Because the ground is rock, they can’t dig a pit toilet. So human waste is “deposited” into an above-ground bin where red worms aerobically transform your poop into their poop, which is essentially dirt. And it doesn’t even smell bad. Much cooler than a monument.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649470,"Arrived at Raven Rock Shelter late afternoon. A group of Boy Scouts were there learning survival strategies. Fallout showed up later. Fallout got his name by falling from the upper loft of a shelter a few nights ago. He’s fortunate he wasn’t injured.  We’ll be the only ones staying in the shelter at Raven Rock. On the lower level.
I was explaining to Fallout about how Scouting just wasn’t the same because they weren’t fixing s’mores, when three weekend hikers from DC showed up with their leftover s’mores. Trail magic!","Annapolis Rocks

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649543,"Short hiking day due to need for resupply. The photo is the group of scouts and two of their leaders from Raven Rock Shelter last night. As you can see from the sign, I’m not quite to the AT halfway point. One of the scout masters gave me a lift from PenMar Park to a small hotel just outside Waynesboro, PA.  There’s a WalMart next door, which is paradise for backpacking resupply. Food, stove fuel, clothing, you name it. Plus it had all the bizarre sights typically associated with a rural Walmart.  Since it was too early to check into my hotel room and shower, I’m sure I smelled worse than anyone there.","Raven Rock Shelter

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649730,"Today reminded how different everyone’s pace is. It’s rare that I hike with anyone, but over a given day I meet the same general group for lunch or at the end of the day.  Started this long day with Ash, Updog, Sweetfoot, and Gila Monster. Ended the day with Gila Monster.  Also crossed the Mason-Dixon Line today. Maryland was nice, with extremely varied terrain. But now it’s on to Rocksylvania.","Pen Mar Park

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649752,"The story on the trail is that there’s a friendly competition between the shelter caretakers to have the most “best”shelter.  For example, the Tumbling Run Shelter site has two shelters, one labeled snoring and one labeled non-snoring. But I think the Quarry Gap Shelter wins the competition hands down with a porch swing, selection of games, magazines, and a babbling brook.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649753,"Crossed the midpoint of the 2022 AT today.  At least it’s the midpoint for hikers that started at one end or the other.  The midpoint is adjusted a few miles each year due to trail re-routes to control erosion, accommodate forest management activities, etc. Tonight will be my first stay in a hiker hostel, the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel. So far it’s given me some time to catch up on journal entries.  Played a game of Yahtzee with Taps, Pyro, and Maybe.","Birch Run Shelters

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649809,"Spent the day hiking from Ironmasters Hostel to Mt. Holly Spring, PA with Taps and Pyro. Took Uber to Mountain Creek Tavern, which is actually a cheep hotel. Had a huge dinner at a local cafe.  Taps is hiking the trail as a fund raiser for the Wounded Warrior Project.  He carries a bugle and plays taps at sunset every evening. Tomorrow I go into Boiling Springs to pick up my bounce box and resupply for the two days it takes to get into Duncannon, PA.","Ironmasters Mansion Hostel

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650040,"Relatively short hiking day into the quaint little town of Boiling Springs.  Picked up my bounce box at the post office and replenished a few items such as hand sanitizer, toothpaste, and vitamins.  Then forwarded the box a couple weeks down the trail to Delaware Water Gap.  Stayed at Lisa’s Hostel with Gila Monster and a few NOBOs (north-bounders) that started in GA. These guys have been on the trail since early February, so they were a great resource.","Mt. Holly Springs, PA

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650043,"The first 12 miles or so of this day was gentle trail through farm pastures and forests in the Cumberland Valley, so I was able to move along quickly.  Had to carry extra water over the stretch due to lack of springs and farm/highway runoff into streams.  Then back to the hills and rocks, so the hiking slowed considerably.  Managed nearly 22 miles over about 10 hrs on the trail. Red efts are a frequent sight on the trail. After a rain there are so many that you have to avoid stepping on them.","Boiling Springs

I chose to stay in the bunkhouse at Kind of Outdoorsy hiker hostel. Fallout passed through town and we went to the pizza shop. Tomorrow I’ll start out with 5 days of food to get me 70 miles down the trail to Port Clinton.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650347,"Left Duncannon around 8:00 am. It’s an old town without much going on. A big sled factory used to be here. There’s a train station but the train doesn’t stop any longer.  Many of the buildings along the Main Street are empty.  There’s a few restaurants, a convenience store, a laundromat, and two hiker hostels.

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650349,Rausch Gap Shelter was unique in that a piped spring flowed right in front of it. Closest you’ll get to running water at a shelter. Plus it had a fire pit with a thick metal plate behind it that reflected heat towards the shelter. This was the first time I’ve built a campfire on the trip. Stayed there with Fallout and Terrapin.,"Campsite at mile 1165.9

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650350,"The 501 shelter had a previous life as a potters studio.  Now it’s a bunkhouse for AT hikers. Because the shelter is close to a parking lot on highway 501 just outside Pine Grove, PA, it’s a special place. A local Italian restaurant can deliver pizza. Or spaghetti. Or sub sandwiches.

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650351,"When the trail isn’t taking you over a rocky ridge or forested area, it’s taking you through bottom land or a swamp. I’m surprised at the number of beaver dams. Sometimes the trail goes right across the dam and you have to balance on logs to avoid dunking your feet.","501 Shelter

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650589,"The descent into Port Clinton was steep, following a staircase the trail builders made from huge stones. Hikers emerge from the woods to a busy rail yard, and then scramble across six sets of tracks.  Fallout, Terrapin, and I went to the Port Clinton Hotel and had a hamburger and beer for lunch. The basket of fries was big enough for a family of six.  Fallout’s dad, Steve, met us there.  Fallout invited me to his parents home in Lancaster, PA, for the night to resupply and clean up.","Eagle’s Nest Shelter

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650590,"Fallout delivered me back to the trail the next morning, while he was going back to Lancaster to spend Mother’s Day at his parents house. It had been raining for 24 hours already and was forecast to rain all day today with temperatures dropping into the mid 40s. When I got to the climb up Pulpit Rock, gusty winds forced me to put my umbrella away and cinch down my rain parka hood. The trail was a flowing stream on the hills and a pond on flat sections. I came across Straps at a shelter. He was waiting out the rain in his hammock. I put on a fleece under my rain jacket to keep my core warm. By the end of the day I was having difficulties opening my water bottles because of cold hands, even though I was wearing rain mitts.  The rain stopped shortly after I reached Eckville Shelter.  ","Port Clinton

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650591,"Where the trail crosses PA 309 is the Thunderhead Lodge. We couldn’t remember the name of the place, so it kept changing to Thunderbolt, Thunderbird, Thunderstorm, and finally we settled on Thunderdome. Terrapin got there ahead of me and went to a hostel “steps away” from the trail. I went inside and had a beer and a snack with Keystone and another hiker whose name I can’t recall. My ride came to deliver me to the Shanty at Blue Mountain B&B.  Great place. For $60 it included pu/do from trail, shuttle into town to get carry out, laundry, shower, and a very nice room. ","Eckville Shelter

Cosmo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650815,"The Gateway Motel has mixed reviews in Guthooks. Some other hikers warned that if you stay there be sure to see the room before paying. And avoid room numbers 1 and 5. The elderly gentleman from India is said to be hiker friendly.  And he was. When I arrived, Mr Satish immediately handed me a bottle of cold water and invited me to sit in a comfy chair in the cramped office area. Terrapin showed up and got the same treatment.  “You pee water, you pee water” he asked pointing to the restroom.  “No thanks, Satish, I’m fine.” Then he handed me a book The Mother - Prayers and Meditations. I was told to open the book to a random page and take a photo of the prayer on that page. That was to be the prayer that would help down the rest of the trail.  Then Satish took me to see my room. Apparently he’s asked to do this so often that it’s become automatic.  Room #1. Oops.  The only problem was that I had to put toilet paper in the trash can to avoid clogging the drain. I’d been using privies and cat holes up to this time, so no problem. Terrapin got room #3 with fully functional plumbing.","Little Gap (Danielsville, PA)

Delaware Water Gap is where the trail crosses into New Jersey and the relentless rocks come to an end. I don’t mean the piles of car and house sized boulders that you get to climb over; those are sort of fun. I mean the smaller rocks that cover the trail with sharp jagged edges sticking out of the ground at all angles. They bruise your feet and eat your shoes. And they can go on for miles and miles.

Yesterday I saw my first bear just outside Unionville. Today I came upon a group of four bears. They ran off as soon as they saw me. The afternoon was a long rock scramble. Throw your hiking poles up on a ledge and climb up to them. And a rebar ladder up a rock face. It stormed mid afternoon making the rocks slick and progress was very slow. When the rain stopped the gnats were thick. Overall a very exciting day.","Vernon, NJ
