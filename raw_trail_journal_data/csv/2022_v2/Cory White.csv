Cory White,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/368338,"(03/2012)Hello my wife, family, friends, and strangers,My name is Cory and I am now a NICU RN in WI with a long-standing dream to thru-hike the AT. As of very recently (see 3/30 journal entry) I have a tentative start date of March 1, 2013. I will try to keep this intro page updated since if you're reading through my prep entries you will notice they span years at various points in my life.I am not a seasoned hiker; in fact, I have never been on an overnight hiking trip. This means I have a lot of learning, testing, and trial and error to get through. If you want to know how to do everything right, find another journal :-p   If nothing else I hope you can learn through my mistakes instead of making them (I know that's how I usually learn best from TJ's).Sorry for all the prep entries, I'm just excited and couldn't wait until I had a date set to start!Hopefully you'll find some of it useful or entertaining. If I am finally hiking you're welcome to skip ahead to my actual entries, those will probably be even more entertaining :-) See you around the bend.",,Hello,"Jan 01, Sat",0
Cory White,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/264497,"Hey everyone, it's that time of year again where hikers start their hike on the Appalachian trail and I live vicariously through them for however long they make it. I'm feeling very restless and it's hard to concentrate on college while I have itchy feet to start my own hike but such is life sometimes. I know it's really early to start a journal now since I probably won't be able to start until at least 2012 but I figured I'd start one anyways...A little about me:I'm a Junior at the University of Wisconsin and almost 21 (Apr 14). I love to hike although as of now I haven't had much experience with backpacking, mostly just day hiking and camping but there's still time to get my feet wet before my big hike. I love spending time out in the woods though and ever since I heard of the Appalachian trail almost exactly a year ago I knew it was something I wanted to do. I even considered taking this spring semester off so I could hike this year if I hadn't gotten into nursing school. I'm really looking forward to challenging myself both physically and mentally and I am hopeful that I'll be one of the 10-20% that make it the whole way. It would have been a hell of a way to spend my 21st b-day if I was able to be on the trail. Either way, I know that some year will come around and I'll be able to start my own adventure because I need to make time for it.I'm journaling so that anyone can follow my journey as I have followed so many others. I will try to provide some helpful information on what works for me as well as what I see working well for other people.This journal is also for my family, friends, and my fiance so they can all keep in contact with me and not be left in the dark until I return home with a million stories. I love all of them and feel lucky that I can count on all of them to support me.Well that's all for now.",,About me,"Mar 23, Mon",0
Cory White,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/281317,"Well, I'm still home, and still very antsy to get on the trail. Still a few years off but it's finally feeling more real.I've been reading up about the trail lately and found a link to ""the Thruhiking Papers"" from a whitblaze forum. This collection of articles has been one of the best resources I've found to date (and I've been looking for over a year now). So for anyone reading this journal that wants to know more about what it is exactly I'm undertaking or if there's other people reading my entries that are future thruhikers, I would strongly encourage looking at the site (http://spiriteaglehome.com/THP%20top.htmlhttp://spiriteaglehome.com/THP%20top.html). As time passes since I started becoming obsessed with the trail, part of me is glad that I have some time before the hike. For awhile I considered starting this year and taking a semester off. Well that obviously didn't happen but now that I think about it, I'm not so sure I would have been ready for it. I definitely held a romanticized version of the trail in my mind and I don't think I really had much of an idea of what the trail was (although sitting here on my laptop at home I still can't say I know what it will be like).And something I saw in the thruhiking papers somewhat intrigued me. In planning for their CDT hike they put together a list of their fears and expectations of the trail so they could find out what they thought about the trail and so I thought I'd do something similar:What I want out of the trail- To be challenged- To be immersed in nature- To live life back to the basics- To grow as a person and learn from the trail- Happiness- Enjoy the smaller things in life- See wildlife and gorgeous views- To be able to say I've done itWhat my fears/concerns are- How will it change me?- Will I be strong enough both physically and mentally?- How can I leave behind my family and especially my wife?- Will I have the perseverance to stick it out through the rain, snow, hail, sleet, etc...?- What if I get sick or injured?- How will I be able to adjust to life after the trail?What I've heard about the trail so far- It's not all sunshine and happy (surprise, surprise) but if you're willing to stick through the tough times it makes up for itself.- It's a loooonnnng trail and at some points I will get bored and probably want to go home.- It's going to be painful, my feet will hurt, my knees will hurt, I'll get blisters, etc...- It's not just going for a ""walk in the woods.""- There are plenty of hikers doing the same as you are every year almost year round.I'm sure this isn't an all inclusive list yet but i think it's a good way to start for now to help me think about what I want to get out of it.",,"Wants, fears, and what I know","Jul 08, Wed",0
Cory White,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/295676,"I want to shout out to my fiance! It really means a lot to me that although she doesn't like the idea of me leaving her for 6 months (can you blame her?) that she understands that it's something I want (or maybe even need) to do in my life. More than anyone else her support is what I will need in order to make it to Katahdin. Although I have yet to be dubbed a trail name we have picked out Roo for her.Kym (Roo) - you are amazing, you are beautiful, and you make me the luckiest guy ever! I don't know what I'm going to have to do to pay you back for this amazing sacrifice for me and my dreams.Alright, enough with the public display of affection; she just means the world to me (sorry last one)On a side note It sounds like for at least parts of the trail I might even be bringing along a furry hiking partner (Kira). Still researching and yearning to start. 789 more days if I make it out in 2012, 1154 days if not until 2013 (both assuming a March 1st start date). Almost time to pick a few favorites to follow for this years AT hike. Good luck to everyone and hopefully I'll be there soon!",,Roo,"Jan 02, Sat",0
Cory White,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/302673,"Tonight I'm just sitting here trying to live through other hikers and learn what I can for my own hike. A hiker from last year wrote something about his mentality of the hike that hit home for me. He said that he was committed only to hiking the first 100 yards of the AT, and after that he would hike as long as it was still what he wanted, it wasn't something that he was going to do just to check it off his list of things to do.What he wanted to know was why he felt so drawn to the trail. I've spent a lot of time trying to think of the answer to that exact question myself.In terms of gear, I'm planning on going with my hammock (currently I have one that I made but I might be switching by the time the trail comes along). I also got an Osprey Aether 70 for a backpack from my wonderful fiance this Christmas. Took it out the other day just for a picnic and loaded it up with some random gear as well. So comfortable, felt like I barely had anything on my back (I'm sure I won't be saying that the 1st day on the trail).Haven't been able to do much hiking yet this spring but hoping after I graduate in May I'll be able to put in some miles and do some serious trial and error.",,Random Thoughts,"Mar 31, Wed",0
Cory White,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/367084,"This has already been an interesting journey for me and I haven't even set foot on the actual trail yet. 2 years ago (when I last updated my journal) I figured I would be on the trail this year. Well that turned out to be not so much the case. In the last 2 years I have graduated college, switched jobs twice, and most importantly got married to my wonderful wife. The reason I find myself here today is recently the trail has been on my mind so I've been reading back over all the prep articles, forums, and ""The Thruhiking Papers"" by Spirit Eagle. I've been thinking about what it means for me to ""hike my own hike and I wanted to start a list of ""ground rules"" for my hike (obviously nothing is set in stone here) so if nothing else I can watch how they change over time. Most of all, I just want to think about these things now so that I don't end up making a decision I regret.My hike:- I will hike as long as I can answer yes to the question: Can I tolerate this for just one more day?- Blue blaze, white blaze - my thruhike is defined by hiking from Georgia to Maine and I will follow whatever blazes I like. One caveat is that I will not take an alternate path/blue blaze to avoid a challenge.- I will walk the whole trail (no ""yellow blazing"" or hitchhiking past sections of trail); taking rides to and from towns is fine.- No slack-packing (this might be rethought after I start as I am somewhat on the fence about this one)- I will not feel pressured to do big milage days before I decide I'm ready- Hiking with others is great but only if we have compatible - Towns will be used as supply points, not to party and stay in for multiple days at a time. I will return to the trail w/in 3 days barring injury, weather, or other unforeseen situations.- On a similar note hostels and motels/hotels will only be used sparingly. I'm carrying my sleeping bag, hammock, and other camping gear for a reason.",,What is my hike?,"Feb 10, Fri",0
Cory White,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/371195,"Exciting news! As of a few days ago I am planning a hike for March 2013!Why now when just a few weeks ago I had absolutely no idea when I would be able to hike it? Short answer to this is because my wife is amazingly supportive of my dreams. We talked the other day about it and she's always known of my dream to hike the AT. We also think it would be best to do this before we have kids of our own. So we're thinking this hike should come sooner rather than later.Some details: Tentative start date is March 1, 2013.I may be hiking with a long-standing friend of mine, Dave, although for him it somewhat depends on if he gets into PT school and it's start time.What I need to figure out still:- Will I be able to take the time off of work and still have a job when I get back? This is somewhat of a deal breaker for me. Not only will it affect the funding of the trail but also my income when I'm finished hiking.- Will I be able to take the full 5-6 months off that I would need? As stated in the first question, if work won't allow me to take off 6 months they may be able to give 2-3 months. So then the questions becomes...- Am I willing to hike the AT in sections? I always pictured my hike as a thru-hike so it's hard to imagine planning to only go out for part of it. I do see a few upsides being that I wouldn't have to leave my wife for so long as well as feeling like I could take my time while hiking and really explore the side trails as the time limit associated with a thru-hike no longer would apply.- How can I afford it? Considering the fact that we have some amount of credit card debt, I still need a fair amount of gear, and we will need to have a good amount of money saved up so that my wife can continue to afford to live in our house for the time I'm gone, it's a lot of pressure to think about all the money that we will need to save in the next 11 months. My wife and I have been thinking of ways to raise money. We may be trying to make and sell t-shirts. She says she might try to sell home-made crafts on Etsy. We'll also be looking at selling things we don't use around the house and have a yard sale/craigslist posts. Other than that I have a feeling I may need to ask family for help. At least in the form of b-day and x-mas gifts but we'll see how it goes.That's all for now. I'm sure I will think of other thing to add later. I still can't believe I have a date!",,Date set!,"Mar 30, Fri",0
