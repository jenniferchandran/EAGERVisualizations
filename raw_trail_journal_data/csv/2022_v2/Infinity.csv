Infinity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632272,"I sure has been a challenge trying to get in some quality hiking when the trails near me are covered in ice!They only way I can make it without falling is to wear my ice cleats the whole time I am hiking.  They are great for traction on the ice, but not for my feet and knees!  I have joined a 2022 Face Book group.   The excitement that is part of the planning is something I really enjoy and FB is a good way to tap into my fellow hikers!  Watching copious YouTube videos to learn as much as possible before I step off from Springer next year.  It is always a challenge to train for hiking in the mountains when you live in a state where the highest elevation is only 1,900 feet!God Bless!",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Fri",0

Infinity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632640,"My friend Steph and I took a trip to a log cabin in Cheyboygan State Park on Lake Huron!  We had a blast snowshoeing and exploring the snow covered forest and lake!This gave me a great avenue to test some of my cold weather clothing for next year's hike.  The windchill was below zero!These cabins are a unique way to experience the cold winter here in Michigan.  They have no running water or electricity.  The park provides the wood to heat the cabin.  It has bunk beds for eight, a large table with chairs, and a counter to work on.  It is a bit cold when you have to head out to the outhouse!We had a sketchy ride home in whiteout conditions at times on the highway, but it was well worth it for a weekend getaway!",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Sat",0

I have continued to hope for a thru-hike next year, but I was thrown a curve ball recently.
I have been having severe pain in both my large toes whenever walking or hiking.  I finally gave in and went to an orthopedic foot specialist.  He let me know I have advanced arthritis in both my large toes with multiple bone spurs.  He said the joints were bone on bone!  The only successful treatment for me if I want to stay active is to have a toe fusion in both large toes.  My first toe will be done in November and he said I would be in a boot for 6 weeks with a possible 3 month recovery.  I won't be able to have my second toe done until 3 months after the surgery on my first.  That puts me into February or March with no way to train.
If it is not possible to hike next year, I will plan on 2023!!",,View Entry,"Oct 06, Wed",0
Infinity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647749,"My plans to hike this year were not meant to be!  I had to have surgery on both my right and left foot.  I now have titanium plates and screws fusing my large toe joints! It felt so good to be able to get out of my surgery boot which I have had on since the beginning of February on my right foot.  My left foot surgery was in November and that boot came off just before my second surgery.When I am cleared to hike again, I will continue section hiking to test out my new feet.  If all goes well this year, I still plan on thru hiking next year!Since I can no longer bend my foot at the joints, it will be a learning process to walk and hike differently.  I will still enjoy following this year's hikers!Happy Trails everyone!",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Wed",0
