Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647209,"My original plan was to hike the PCT this year, however I could not get a permit and decided to hike the AT again. This will be a completely different hike than the one 8 years ago as hostels have opened and closed and my mindset will be completely different. 

Like my previous hike I will be hiking for a charity (MMRF) in the memory of a friend Paula Guerin who lost her battle from this cancer in 2011. 

My start date is approaching and I keep hiking in the White Mountains of New Hampshire until then. Getting excited to do this again.

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648387,"Today is the day the journey starts-although I won’t set foot on the trail until tomorrow. After spending a few days with my daughter and granddaughters and visiting with my sister and brother-in-law it finally has come to my last day at work. 
I had made my decision on July 1st but thought I would be hitting a different trail. As February arrived my task was to train my replacement and to bring several of my projects to a close. I really wasn’t sure how  this was going to work out.  By 4 on Friday my work was as complete as it was ever going to be and I  left the office for vacation- a 24 week vacation!!!
I got together with some of the neighborhood friends and had dinner and drinks and headed home for my last night in my own bed for some time. 
On Saturday morning I was up early tending to the last minute tasks and trying to get laundry done. Just after 8 Hannah - my godchild - came over with her parents to say goodbye. I really was not prepared as to how emotional this was saying goodbye. 
We left my house as Kerry and Christine and kids were outside waving and wishing me luck. We dropped Hannah and Melissa at their house - said goodbye and shed some tears again and then Kevin drove me to airport. 
Casey, Paula’s son picked me up in Charlotte and we headed to his house to meet his 2 sons and Courtney. Later in the afternoon we headed to Blue Blaze where we meet Colin and Maria. Colin took me to get my food supply and then to his house to pack my backpack for tomorrow.",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Sat",0
Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648388,"We were up by three and on the road by 3:30. We stopped first at Neels Gap in Georgia to drop off Colin’s car and Zack picked us up and drove us to the  Springer Mountain parking lot a mile from the summit. 
Our shuttle driver arrived (Scott) and proceeded to drive us down to the trailhead. It was quite similar to a hitchhiking story from 14. At any rate we made it to the park. I registered as 2377 hiker this year. I sat through an LNT talk and then we were on our way. 
We headed up the stairs to the falls and then continued over and up and down until we finally reached Springer Mtn - the start of the Appalachian Trail. 
From there we headed a mile down the mountain to Zacks car where we put on our heavy packs and had one more beer before we headed the 2 miles to Stover shelter where we called it a night going to bed around 7 after hiking just over 10 miles.","Springer Mountain

From Hawk we headed over to the Gooch shelter climbing over some significant bumps such as Sassafras. We arrived at Gooch around 3 and decided to take a break and then push on to Lance Creek campsite.   There are more bumps along the way and they eventually took a toll on me and we decided to stealth camp about a mile prior to Woody Gap. 
We setup camp with “YardSale” (17) and his dad Britt. We got a great sunset and were asleep before 9.","Stover Creek Shelter

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648393,"We were up around 6 and on the trail before 7 using headlamps to light the trail. We caught a beautiful sunrise on the way up to Preacher’s Rock and eventually headed down to Lance Creek campsite. I could feel the effect of the 18 miles we had done yesterday. 
After Lance Creek it starts to go up to Blood Mountain - the highest point in Georgia on the AT. As we got closer to Blood it started to rain - and got heavier as we climbed up with a couple of clashes of thunder. 
Colin was getting cold and I was going slow so I told him to take off and we would meet at Neels Gap. 
I hit the summit of Blood around 12:30, took a couple pics in the rain and started down to Neels Gap. Colin was there waiting for me and drove me down to Blood Mountain cabins where one person had a cabin and was looking for someone to split it with. 
After securing a place to stay, Colin and I went to lunch in Blairsville and then he dropped me back at the cabin and headed back to Charlotte. 
This is the same cabin I stayed in when hiking in 2014. Plan is to take a day off tomorrow and get laundry done and get a few items at Mountain Crossings before hitting the trail again on Thursday","Stealth Campsite near Woody Gap

The internet wasn’t the best so I packed up and walked up the hill to the store at Mountain Crossings. 
I mailed some clothes back to Colin that I grabbed from his car yesterday that I didn’t need.  I spoke with my daughters and was able to update my blog and social media. 
I purchased a few things I needed  - a hat, pillow, donuts, a coke and a pizza - which I ate outside while talking with another hiker. 
Spent the remainder of the afternoon relaxing with John from VA and James from St. Louis  and meeting some of the hikers staying in the other cabins.

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648448,"I was out of the Blood Mountain Cabins around 7:30 on a blustery, foggy and chilly day. I headed back up to Mountain Crossings and through the arch - the only building that the AT goes through. From there it was up and over a few peaks and then down some. The weather had cleared and provided some nice views. 
When we came down into Tesnatee Gap, King Tut was there with trail magic - same place he was 8 years ago. I had  a toasted ham and cheese sandwich, a coke and a couple Oreos before we headed up Wildcat Mountain. I ran into some trail stewards - one who we had already met at Gooch Shelter   I chatted with them for a while and then headed over to Low Gap Shelter for a snack. From there I headed up to my destination of Poplar Stamp Gap Tentsite arriving around 3. Sean setup camp next to me and Caitlin and MO stopped by to eat dinner and chat.

I felt great and the terrain was pretty agreeable. About the only thing that  upset me was the wealth of camp sites along the way. I kind of wished I had hiked for another hour and grabbed one of those. 
When I got to the shelter I stopped to have breakfast. I was out fast as it was windy and cold. When I got to Unicoi Gap Kelly was doing trail magic - making hot dogs and she had beer - my 2nd trail magic beer. At the feed I met Shelly from NH and Beans from Spokane. When I left the hiker feed I started the ascent that would eventually get me to Trey Mountain. Again, when I got there it was cold and windy. I snacked for a few minutes and got out of there - I was freezing. I headed to Sassafras Gap about 5 miles away. Shortly after arriving and setting up my tent it was snowing.  Snow was heavy enough to need to brush it off prior to getting into the tent. 
I met a few more hikers - Miami and Giligan  as well as 2 Section hikers from Florida. Camped nearby was Caitlyn and Mo.","Poplar Stamp Gap

At that point I figured might as well get up and start heading to town. I only had six miles but I was cold and couldn’t wait to warm up. 
Heading down seemed more like I was heading up. Lots of climbing but nothing too terrible but after almost 19 miles yesterday I was a bit sluggish. Add to this was the fact that I didn’t eat dinner last night due to the snow squalls and this morning I was just too cold. I finally came to the last hill and it was 11/2 miles down to the road. Once I arrived at the road I walked down the mile or so to the hostel. James had reserved a room and I was happy to have one. 
I took a shower and charged everything and headed into Hiawasse for an AYCE (all you can eat) buffet and to resupply.  The afternoon was spent doing laundry and visiting with the other hikers staying here. A trail angel stopped by and made burgers for dinner.

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648662,"I got up and got my backpack ready and Gordon- the hostel owner- gave me a ride to the trailhead at 8 am. This hostel is probably one of the nicest on the trail and Gordon appears to be on the right track even though he has never run a hostel before. A couple things to mention - Mulligan sketched a profile of me and I thought it came out real nice. Also, I weighed myself and I was down 14 lbs in a week the AT diet. I also weighed my pack and it was 33 lbs
Leaving Dick’s Creek Gap you immediately start going up - and never stop going up. After 8 miles I crossed the GA/NC border. I took a break shortly after crossing the border with Levi and Brian. 
The afternoon was more of the same. Ups mixed in with snow, ice and some dry patches. I took another break with at Muskrat Creek Shelter with 2 bars and her brother Anthony. We eventually headed out for the last 6 miles to Standing Indian shelter.

Leaving camp I started the hike up to Standing Indian Mountain. I passed Lady Jane along the way. When I finally reached the summit there were dim nice views. The terrain after that was mostly downhill and I continued on for about 8 miles when I arrived at Carter Gap Shelter. I was pretty beat from the hike the previous day and decided to take an hour to rest up. 
I started back up and headed to Betty Creek and ran into ISpy, Miami and Becca. I took another break and really wasn’t looking forward to the climb up Albert Mountain. I eventually got going and the climb up to the fire tower at 5300’ really wasn’t that bad. The fire tower represents 100 miles hiked (only 2100 remaining). 
After the fire tower it was a quick 2.4 miles down to the Long Branch Shelter. It was great with everyone mingling. I really enjoy this crew of hikers.","Standing Indian Shelter

I had remembered this section of the trail from years ago. I recalled a lot of flat and downhill - which is what it was - UNTIL Rock Gap where it went up, up, up!! Once I got to the top, then it was down all the way to the highway. 
While waiting for the town shuttle, a shuttle for a hostel (Chica & Sunset) arrived to pick up a couple hikers and had room for one more. I jumped in and he brought me to the Microtel, where I was staying. 
Since my room wasn’t ready, I changed into cleaner clothes and crocs and took the metro bus to Franklin. My first stop was Lazy Hiker Brewery. I had one beer and decided I really needed food so I walked to a restaurant where I ate a massive burger with bacon and cheese fries. 
I headed over to Outdoor 76 and bought a new pair of hiking shorts and met up with Tropic Thunder (formerly Miami), Gilligan, Becca and Reya, Wes, Anthony and 2 bars. We all caught the 3 bus back to the hotel. 
Later I went across the street to resupply at Ingles. I bought a salad and chicken salad sandwich for dinner and a pint of ice cream for dessert along with a 2 liter bottle of cream soda. 
Tropic Thunder text me around 7:30 to go to dinner but his text had woken me up so I passed.","Long Branch Shelter

I repacked my backpack and took another shower. I took the 2 beers that I didn’t drink and put them outside Miami’s room and then waited for the bus back to the trailhead. 
The bus dropped me off a little pass 9 and I started the ascent of Siler Bald. Once that was done there a brief down and I started the ascent of Wayah Bald which seemed to take forever passing Kelly on the way who had done trail magic at Unicoi Gap. Once I got to the top, a former thruhiker was handing out PBRs I drank mine while I was on the phone with my daughter. 
From Wayah Bald it was a quick 5 miles downhill and a strenuous 1 mile up to the Cold Spring Shelter. I’m camping above the shelter on a ridge with Jeff, Problem Child and a SOBO section Hiker.","Microtel Franklin, NC

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648874,"It rained overnight so everything was quite wet white I was packing up. When I left around 7 it was foggy and drizzling. I had a quick hike up to the top of the hill and then it was down into Telico Gap. Once you cross the dirt road it was a mile plus hike up to Weser  Bald which has a fire tower but unfortunately it was too foggy to see anything. 
From the fire tower it was pretty much down for the remainder of the day however with the ground being wet you had to watch your footing as I took one pretty good fall. 
I arrived at the NOC around 1 and immediately went for lunch. I sat next to Hollywood another hiker and we chatted while eating.  The day had cleared and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. 
After lunch I got my room and headed up to shower and get laundry done.  Once I got in my room I took the tent fly out to dry when the door to my room opens and it’s Hollywood and 2 other hikers- somehow we have been assigned the same room. Turns out they had put me in the incorrect room. 
I headed back down to the office, got the correct key, bought some sock liners, beer, ice cream and a small resupply. I met Jeff and we walked back to the room.   I showered and got laundry going and had a  few beers with the other hikers. 
We headed back to the restaurant for dinner around 6 and returned to hang with the other hikers here.","Cold Spring Shelter

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648928,"Well, some of the hikers were up late last night as I heard them around 2 am. I started moving around 7 after a great sleep in a very comfortable bed I said goodbye to Jeff and hit the trail around 8. 
From the NOC it is an eight mile hike going up about 3K feet in elevation. I was also using my new wicking socks- hoping they would make my feet feel better. Around mile 7 my feet started hurting but I pressed on past the shelter to Cheoah Bald where I stopped for lunch. I took off my shoes and socks and took an hour break. A day hiker who had passed me going up gifted me a Clementine which was delicious. I met hikers Mellow and John and John’s wife. Also , a son and his mother who were thru hiking were there  
After lunch I had quite a bit of downhill getting to Stecoah Gap. About a mile before the Gap my feet starting aching again. This time I took 800mg of vitamin I which seemed to work immediately and lasted for about 20 minutes. I eventually made it to the gap and took my shoes and socks off for another hour break.   I spoke with Budhikes who is hiking the ECT (Eastern Continental Trail) and later with Black Beard. 
After the break it was 2 miles to the Brown Fork Shelter going up Jacob’s Ladder on the way. Staying here are Tyler and Matt. After it was dark, Hollywood came in to stay.","NOC

The trails were wet and slick so I had to take my time going downhill. At about the halfway point the climb started and it seemed to take a lot out of me. 
At one point as I crossed a road there was a van that had the passenger door open and nobody was nearby. I had thought of stopping but just continued on. Within a short distance a hiker was catching up with me. It was James who I stayed with at Blood Mountain Cabins and the Hostel Around The Bend - both back in Georgia. Later on Aja (from Poland) passed me. I eventually made it to the top and that it was all downhill to the Marina. Colin and Maria had a ton of soda, beer, donuts, apples and more. 
Maria and I headed over to the shelter and then we threw everything in the car and headed back to the NOC where I was 2 days ago to get something to eat. It was fun running into some of the hikers I last saw in Franklin. 
Tonight I’m staying at the “Fontana Hilton” -a shelter overlooking Fontana Lake. Tomorrow I start the Smokies.

When he wasn’t snoring his wife was and sometimes they were snoring at the same time. If there was a moment of silence the woman to my left would start snoring. The only time it was quiet was when I got up to pee. 
Finally 6:30 rolled around and I started moving. I brought all my stuff outside so I could pack up there while I was eating breakfast   I FaceTime Kellye and the kids and was on my way just before 8. The day started out foggy but cleared as I was hiking up into the Smokeys. 
At one point I checked for signal and took a few minutes to call Kara and the kids and also called my sister. I continued the slog up the mountain stopping for a break at the fire tower I climbed halfway up and didn’t feel good hiking the rest - heights don’t agree with me. I had a quick lunch and continued on to Mollie’s Ridge Shelter where I got more water and had another sandwich   I made one more call with Kellye and then continued on three miles to the Russell Field Shelter before the rain started.

I gathered my things together and hit the trail around 7:30. 
The trail was a slog fest featuring deep mud and occasional streams running down the trail. It rained lightly off and on throughout the day. After a few miles I stopped at Spence Field Shelter to use the privy - one of the very few shelters that have one. 
After nine miles I reached the Derrick Knob Shelter. Quite a few of the hikers from the night before were there for lunch. I contemplated staying but since it was just after one I decided to push on to the next shelter. 
When I arrived at the Siler Bald Shelter I considered putting up my tent but it had really gotten cold and my tent was wet from the rain during the day. I opted to take a spot in the shelter and quickly rolled out my air mattress and quilt and jumped in to warm up. 
There was a fire going in the fire place and everyone had their shoes and socks in front of it to dry them out.

It was cold so I just rolled for a few more hours of sleep. Around 7 I finally got up and essentially threw everything in my backpack. I checked my water bladder in my backpack and it had frozen along with my ice tea. I put on my frozen boots and headed down to the water source so I could get water before I left. 
The trail that was full of muck and mud was now a frozen skating rink. Every step was planned and fortunately I only fell once although there were many close calls. 
It was a 3 mile hike to Clingmans and as I got closer the skies seemed to clear - only to cloud up again. I had zero views from Clingmans - the highest elevation on the AT. 
While there I took my phone out of airplane mode and received a text from Colin that he would be passing Newshound Gap around 2 - which was perfect - although I thought I would be earlier. It was almost 8 miles and I had forgotten that there were some uphills and ice - lots of ice.  
On the way I ran into hikers PB&J who told me the ice was worse on the other side of the Gap which made my decision easy. I was going to ask Colin to drive me to Gatlinburg and I was going to zero. The past two days had taken a toll on me and I hadn’t had a zero day in 2 weeks. 
I popped out of the woods and into the parking lot and there was Colin with a sub and beer for me. I discussed my plan with him and he suggested staying at his house and doing a double zero and he would drop me off Friday morning to continue on.

Not quite sure what I was thinking when I sent all of that but I have several wardrobe changes available. All this can be sent back as I will never need it. The only thing I might need will be my trail runners but after the slipping in the mud and on the ice the past few days I may just stick with my boots. 
In the afternoon Colin dropped me off at a brewery and then I headed to another brewery and got some great food to go along with some very good beer. Colin located me and we met a friend for more food and more beer (shocking).

Zach and I continued and eventually took a break at Davenport Gap Shelter and refilled on water and had some lunch. After our break we continued and met up with Ridge who Zach had Thru hiked with in 2018. With Ridge leading the way we flew down the trail and crossed  I-40 and up the  hill to Standing Bear Farm.

After we parted ways I had a steep downhill to Deep Gap where I took a break and took my shoes and socks off to dry out. I refilled my water and as I was getting ready to go 8-10 horseback riders came through the path leading back up to the AT. 
From there it was up for most of the afternoon with a few downs mixed in. Around 5 I made it to Max Patch - a huge grassy bald at 4K feet in elevation. There were some people doing trail magic but they had given away all their beer but offered me a White Claw- which hit the spot. 
I left Max Patch and headed for the shelter 2 miles away. I chatted with the hikers here - Can Do, Trip, Low Gear, Red Panda,MC, Fancy and Falk. Then I heard someone say Gandalf?  I turned around to see Aquaman who started the trail southbound on 12/5 who I had missed in January when I did Jefferson and he had hiked Washington.

Leaving the shelter there was a pretty good downhill for three miles and then the up started - first a small one to the Walnut Mountain Shelter. I stopped for a break and took off my shoes. Devil Dog was there and he asked about my trail name. When I said it was Gandalf he asked if I was the Famous Gandalf. Apparently when Scott got to that shelter the night before he had asked if there was a Gandalf there- as he was trying to meet him. There was a Gandalf there but it wasn’t me. 
From there it was a pretty good down and then back up to Bluff Mountain (4680) which was as difficult and long as I had remembered. I took another break for lunch at the summit. From the summit it was another significant downhill and then rolling ups and downs for the remainder of the day. I did run into Kelly again. She’s the hiker that did trail magic at Unicoi Gap in GA and I also ran into her again going up Wayah Bald. 
Eventually I made it to Hot Springs and checked into the Laughing Heart Hostel and got a shower. They informed me that they were doing a hiker feed of burgers and dogs. 
I ate potato salad, a burger and a sausage and drank 2 beers 2 sodas a Gatorade and a water - I was dehydrated.  As I was getting ready for bed Aga and Mountain Doctor stopped me in the hallway to inquire about the section ahead.

After feeding my face I went next door to the Dollar General and got a 4 day resupply. On my way back to the hostel it was raining pretty good. I got my pack and threw out most of the food I had leftover and replaced it with fresh food. 
I went back to town and headed to the outfitter. I decided to purchase a new pair of trail runners and socks. I’m hoping this fixes the issue I’ve been having with my feet sweating. Time will tell. I then went over to the brewery for some lunch.

They had apparently scrambled up on a bushwhack. 
The day was beautiful and the trail gentler than it had been. At one point Falk passed me and told me there was an author looking for me - and I knew who it was - Sarah Jones Decker who had written the book on the AT.  We met  and chatted for a while before we both had to get moving. At mile 11 I came to a shelter and decided to eat lunch. Some of the hikers who I had been with at the hostel decided to stay. I decided I would press on 8 miles to the next shelter. 
There were some long downs and some ups late in the day but I arrived just before 7. If was nice to see Trudge who I had breakfast with yesterday along with Falk, WIC and Captain BeeGee  Big day for miles today 19.93 - most to date. Tomorrow morning I’ll hit 300 miles. 
On a sad note apparently my air mattress has sprung a leak - it might be a long uncomfortable night

Right out of the gate it was a pretty good up and I think I could feel the 20 miles from the day before. Eventually it leveled out and within 5 miles hit Big Firescald Mountain that had fantastic views. I took a break and then headed another 3-4 miles to the Jerry Cabin Shelter where I stopped for an hour for lunch. 
After lunch it was another up to a Big Butt Mountain and then a long down followed by another up to Flint Mountain Shelter. I got here around 4 and my intent was to eat dinner and get water and then continue however Zach, Falk and Thistle convinced me to stay. 
In the shelter using my down jacket again as a mattress. On a side note - passed 300 miles today yay!!

It was sunny and cool and downhill to start but then we hit the up it continued to the Hogback Ridge Shelter. I didn’t stop at the shelter as I was hoping there would be trail magic at Sam’s Gap three miles away. I got to the Gap and sure enough there was trail magic. I had 2 cookies,2 cokes, fruit salad, ham sandwich, hard boiled egg and a salad made with sweet potatoes and cilantro    I saw Sauce, Kaitlyn and MO, Greeter and more at the stop. 
After the break it was uphill for the rest of the day to Big Bald Mountain which had great views. Leaving the mountain it started to rain but I had less than 2 miles to the shelter. At the shelter was WIC, Captain Bee Gee, Falk, Charts and some section hikers.

It was a down for quite a bit and the day was overcast and cool. There was an up to 4280 so i took the side trail to the summit. After that it was all downhill to Spivey Gap. I took a break there with Honey Bee and her dad 6 mil  who were getting picked up there and then started the up to the shelter. At the shelter I met Falk and Captain Bee Gee as they were about to leave. After a half hour break I put my shoes back on and started the last six miles to Erwin. It was not easy as it had gotten hot and there were many little ups and downs. Finally I started the descent into Erwin arriving at the hostel just past 4. 
I found the cabin that we had rented and got a (cold) shower in before the 5 pm shuttle into town. We went to Bojangels for dinner and a resupply at the market. 
Once back at the hostel I hung around with Mike, Giddy Up, Falk and Sauce. Zeroing tomorrow as it’s suppose to rain and I need a day off.

I spent the morning trying to get a ride from the hostel to a hotel in town. As things worked out-I had three offers. One was from the hostel, another from a trail Angel and the one I accepted was from a church group that was holding a church service and then a hiker feed. They took Greater, her husband Glen and myself to hotel where we checked in. The van came back later and picked us up and brought us to the service. 
After the service the cookout started. They had hot dogs, burgers, potato salad, beans, chips, desserts and assorted drinks. There had to be 50 or more hikers chowing down. 
The remainder of the afternoon was spent relaxing. 
This marks the end of four weeks on the trail and 344 miles hiked.

The library didn’t open until 10 so I waited outside. Apparently they took pity on me and allowed me in early. I tried to connect but their firewall was blocking me so I headed back to the hotel. 
When I got to the hotel I texted Miss Janet and she came right over and picked me up and I was hiking by 10:30. The trail was mostly wooded so there were no views but it was much more easier than it had been in several days. 
As I made it near Indian Grave Gap a couple in front of me (Postal and Zena from Franklin MA) stopped to take a break. I told them I was going to take my break at the road - just in case there was trail magic.  Sure enough there was a group with soda and cookies.  Postal and Zena reconsidered and also showed up to get some

From there I continued down to Iron Mountain Gap. I took another break and then started the uphill to the Clyde Smith Shelter. 
Not sure what was going on but yesterday I had a ton of energy and today not so much. I took another break and refilled on water at Greasy Creek Gap. I chatted with Werner from Germany and Anook from the Netherlands. 
After that break I was still lacking the energy so when I got to the Clyde Smith Shelter I took an hour break. It was 3 and I was trying to decide if I wanted to stay at the shelter or push on. Greeter and Glen arrived and they were undecided as to what they were going to do - stay or push on. I told them whatever they decided I would do the same. During my break I filled up on water with MIO and had a Kind bar   
Greeter and Glen decided to push on so I left before they did. Not sure what kicked in but I found the energy that I had been missing all day. I continued on 6.6 miles with quite a bit of up and the last mile in the rain.

It was foggy and threatening rain all morning. I stopped at the Clyde Smith shelter for lunch and it started raining but stopped after a few minutes and then cleared.

Not one to miss a free meal I went for breakfast. It was a pancake, scrambled eggs , home fries and a biscuit with gravy. It hit the spot. 
I was given a ride to the trail head and started hiking around 8:30. It was overcast and cool but chances for heavy rain and thunderstorms in the afternoon. My initial thought was to make it 8 or so miles to Mountaineering Shelter and see what happens. 
I passed Jones Falls which was real nice and then Mountaineering Falls which was OK. I also saw a deer and a rabbit along the trail. I met many slack-packers making their way back to 19E. 
I stopped for lunch at Mountaineering Shelter and was getting ready to head back out when it started raining. The forecast called for heavy rain between 3-4 and I didn’t want to be on the way to the next shelter so I made the decision to stop and spend the night here.

The rain was on and off but it was light. The temps were cool and by the time I reached the next shelter I was pretty soaked and chilled. I debated stopping for lunch but that would mean changing into dry clothes to eat and then back into wet clothes to hike - I skipped lunch. 
Just before 2 I got to Dennis Cove Road and I turned left and headed up to the Kincora hostel where I had stayed in 2014. I was the only one there. I had covered over 16 miles in less than 7 hours. 
Not long after WIC arrived as did Sketch and Thris, Shitshow and Burnt Foot and Johnny Walker. We all changed into dry clothes, got the fire going and ate leftover food. When Bob Peoples arrived we all chatted for a bit and then he drove us to town to resupply.

The trail goes by Laurel Falls and follows the river for a while before it turns uphill for a bit. My legs felt strong and I was well rested so it almost seemed effortless. As soon as you hit the peak it was down hill for a couple miles to Watuga Lake. I took a break for a little bit and then continued along the south side of the lake to the dam. I stopped there and had a bite to eat with WIC and Trip. 
After lunch it was up hill for six miles to the shelter. The day was cloudy and cool which was great conditions to hike.

It was foggy and cool out, so cool that I started hiking in my down jacket. There were a couple ups and then the trail leveled out. I stopped at Iron Mountain Shelter for a snack and a break. While there two hikers stopped by - House and Two Tone and they were heading to Damascus but had started at a hostel near the lake   They were doing a total of 40 miles in one day. 
At one point the trail takes you through a pasture. In the middle of the pasture was a bench so I stopped and had lunch.  The rest of the day was ridge walking and I finally got to the shelter at 6:45 - 22.8 miles in just over 11 hours including breaks.

About 6 miles into the 10 mile hike I came across the sign indicating that I had just crossed out of Tennessee and into Virginia. Giddy Up was there and took my photo. From there it really was pretty much downhill into Damascus. 
I went to The Place which is run by the church. They ask for a $10 donation to camp in the side yard. From there I headed over to the Post Office to mail back my cold weather gear and then went to lunch with Squatch, Rhino and Trip. 
After lunch I headed to the outfitter to buy a mattress for my tent and then back to the Post Office to pick up a package that Beth had sent. The package had a ton of items needed for a resupply. I took what I needed and then shared the test with the other hikers. Thanks Beth- very much appreciated. 
I then went to find a beer but quite a few places were closed. I settled for a foot long sub at Subway and a coke. On the way back I stopped and got a pint of ice cream for dessert.

I got to Subwsy before they opened and waited. I was their first customer of the day. I got a foot long sub thinking I would eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. 
I started the hike out of town and very quickly started going up. I had forgotten how steep this section was and when I did it in 2014 I was slack packing (only had food and water). This time my pack was considerably heavier than before. 
I made it to the Saunders Shelter around 1 and took a break. I ate the first half of the sub but was still hungry so I ate the 2nd half as well. 
After lunch it was pretty much downhill and at one point the trail merged with the Virginia Creeper Trail. Once you turn back onto the AT it was a quick up to the Lost Mountain Shelter. 
At the shelter were Foot Long, WIC, Tree Beard and a couple of hikers who had done the trail last year.

We eventually got to the Knot Maul Shelter and stopped for lunch. I normally take my shoes and socks off when I take a long break but my feet and shoes were soaked so there was no point. 
At one point we came to a river and the bridge had been washed away. Since our shoes were already wet we just walked through the river. Soon after we came to a road and we knew that it marked the start of our biggest climb of the day - over 2k feet in elevation over 4 1/2 miles.

The shuttle to bring us back to the trailhead was scheduled for 8 a.m. but he was running a little bit late. We started hiking at 8:45 with heavy packs as they contained 4 days of food to get us to Daleville. 
Early into our hike we passed “The Captains” a place we had stayed in 2014. Apparently he has passed away and it is no longer open to hikers. From there it was very gentle terrain until we started heading up to the Bailey Gap Shelter and then it was steep. We took a break at the shelter and then continued to Wind Rock where we ate lunch at the road. 
As we headed to War Spur Shelter the skies opened up and rained for about 20 minutes- with 10 minutes of heavy rain. By the time we reached the shelter the sun was out again. 
The next shelter, Laurel Creek was six miles away with a big climb of Kelly Knob. I let Captain BG make the decision of whether we should stay or go. He said let’s go. 
About 1/2 into the climb it started raining again. Not as heavy as before and lasted about 20 minutes. We eventually made it to the summit and then it  was just over a mile to the shelter arriving just after 8. 
My feet felt great although I’m still not convinced that I have this situation resolved. Whenever it rains it helps to dull the pain in my feet. I’m feeling positive as my feet were doing well before the rain with a heavy pack. 
Not sure who is staying here as everyone was in their tents when we arrived. I know that Trip and Can Do are here along with Captain BG.","Peters Mountain Trailhead

The weather didn’t look good with a projected 2 inch rainfall. Captain BG asked me what I thought and I said I wasn’t zeroing at a shelter. I said let’s go to the 2nd shelter and see how the weather was responding. 
We had 2 big hills to climb. One was right after seeing the Keffer Oak tree- the largest oak tree along the AT in the south. It is estimated to be about 300 years old. After that climb there was ridge walking and then down to the Nidday Shelter. While eating lunch it started to rain - and it hasn’t stopped yet as I write this. 
We decided to head to Trout Creek Rd another 9 miles. Along the way you climb Brushy Mountain. At the summit is a monument dedicated to Audy Murphy who crashed his plane nearby. Murphy was the most decorated pilot of WWII. 
From there it was about three miles down to the road. Did I mention it was still raining?

We got going around 7:30 and hiked just over a mile to the first shelter which was .3 of the trail. We got water, had breakfast and used the privy. From there we hiked 3 miles or so to the Dragon’s Tooth-a rock formation. On the way we passed the 700 miles hiked spot.  From Dragon’s Tooth it was a steep 2.4 miles down to the road. Part of the trail had metal footholds to help you down. 
When we got to the road we had six miles to the next road crossing. On the way we stopped at a spot and had lunch. 
We crossed the road and headed up to McAffee Knob but ran into some hikers that were camped at the Catawba tenting site and they told us that the next shelter had a school group staying there so there would be limited space. We decided to stay at the Catawba Shelter so that we wouldn’t have to setup our wet tents.

From McAffee Knob it is down for a while and then you start the ascent to Tinkers Cliffs. Like McAffee it was overcast with little views but still pretty awesome to be up there. 
After Tinkers Cliffs it was down to Lamberts Meadow Shelter where we took a quick break.  After the break we had 10 miles to go to get to Daleville.

First I had to setup my wet tent in the room to try to dry it out. There was so much dirt and leaves that came out of the tent that I needed to get a vacuum from housekeeping to clean it up. I also opened my quilt and laid that out to dry as well.  While this was going on Captain BG was getting the laundry done. 
Once those chores were done we walked to the post office so I could mail my shoes back - did I tell you I got new shoes? After the post office we went to a pizza/sub shop and had a great lunch. After that we stopped at the outfitter and then at the market to resupply and then back to the hotel. 
For dinner we (Falcon, Captain BG and I) went to the Three Little Pigs barbecue. If you’re a Thru-hiker you get a free banana pudding dessert.

During the day it had barely rained in fact there was blue sky - the first blue skies I had seen in 4 days. I was beginning to question the decision of staying the extra day. 
By the time we got out of the movies and were being shuttled back to the hotel the skies opened up and it poured with some lightning. It rained for about an hour before it stopped only to start back up around 7.

On the way the streams that were probably easy to rock hop last week were full and running fast from the rain yesterday. I chose not to remove my shoes since my crocs have little traction. 
At Wilson Creek Shelter Lego said that his cousin who had hiked the trail in 2020 was doing trail magic on Skyline Drive in about 3 miles. I hustled and got there and consumed a beer and 2 Pepsi’s. 
From there it was 3 miles to the shelter that we were going to stay at but we got word that the shelter was full and there was little space for tents. We decided to continue north for about a mile until we found a spot.

The weather was beautiful as was the terrain. We made it to Cove Mountain Shelter and took a break. From there it was 3.2 miles down to Jennings Creek which took us just under an hour. Parked in the parking lot was Camper doing trail magic-again. He cooked up hot dogs and had chips to go with them. I consumed 2 hotdogs, 2 bags of chips and 3 beers. 
When I left it was a steep up and then a steep down to the Bryant Shelter. The shelter probably sleeps 20 and has 2 floors and a big deck. It is probably one of the nicest shelters on the trail. We took another break there and then left to do the final climb of the day to the Cornelius Creek Shelter. The ascent was over 2k feet in five miles. 
Here at the shelter are quite a few other hikers. Trip, Captain BG, House, Two Tone, Atlas, Rainbow, Casserole, Hairnet and more.

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653189,"I was up before 5:30 to get my clothes out of the dryer and to pack up my backpack. I had Raisin Bran with milk (a treat) for breakfast and then Patty’s husband John dropped me off at Caledonia State Park. A special thanks to Patty and John for their help in getting my resupply done and letting me shower, do laundry and giving me a bed to sleep in yesterday. 
I finely hit the trail before 7. The first up was the biggest of the day and it really wasn’t that bad. Around 9 I took a break at a campsite and ate some snacks. Around 11 I arrived at the Birch Run Shelter and had lunch and filtered some more water. Within a mile of leaving I crossed a paved road and Special K was doing trail magic in the parking l lot. I had a Coke and that just seemed to fuel me for the next couple hours. 
I passed the halfway point and shortly after that passed the 1100 miles hiked mark.  I stopped at the Tom’s Run shelter and filtered 2 more liters of water. Although it was warm it wasn’t humid and there was a nice breeze. The trail was mostly flat with some ups and downs but they were minor. The trail was void of rocks - or at least the many rocks that have been present the past few days. 
After the shelter is the original halfway sign but before I got there I had to wait for a rattlesnake to cross the path. He wasn’t happy with hikers on the trail. 
Within four miles I arrived at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. Freedom and I checked out the AT museum and then went to the store to eat. I passed on the half-gallon challenge and instead had a bacon cheeseburger, 4 cokes and a pint of vanilla ice cream. 
At 5 I decided to leave and hike another 7 miles to the James Frye Shelter. The day totaled 27 miles - my biggest day so far on the trail.

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653229,"Another great day hiking. The temps cooled down considerably and there was a breeze to make things perfect. 
Although I was up around 6 I took my time packing up. The Green Mountain Store which was in 1.6 miles didn’t open until 8 so I left at 7:15 to be their first customer. I got a sausage, egg and cheese sub with 2 (cream) sodas - one for now and one to pack out. 
After breakfast there were some ups one of which brought you through a rock maze. I took a break at the Alec Kennedy Shelter where I met Goat Roper- a 78 year old hiker from Minnesota. It was nice talking with him. 
From the shelter it was 4 miles into Boiling Springs. When I walked in front of the outfitter store someone asked if I wanted a beer - a free beer. Apparently it was customer appreciation day. From there I went to a sub shop around the corner and ordered a chicken Cesar salad, a Pepsi and a ham and cheese sub to go (for dinner). 
As I was walking past the outfitter store they again asked if I wanted a beer.  Sure. 
I left Boiling Springs and had a 14 plus mile hike to get to where I wanted to stay and it was after 3. As I was about 9 miles into the 14 the trail comes out of a pasture and takes a left to go over I-81 and what was there - a little farmstand selling ice cream and Gatorade. No one was there so I left money for my purchases and then continued on getting to the shelter before 9.

The weather today was perfect if not a little chilly but the going was tough on Cove Mountain trying to avoid all of the rocks. 
My plan was similar to yesterday. Get to Duncannon and have lunch and then pack a sub out for dinner but that plan failed as all the restaurants in Duncannon were closed. I went to the mini-mart and got a pint of ice cream and two sodas (one to pack out). I ate the ice cream and drank one soda and then headed out of town. 
After you cross the Clarks Ferry Bridge there is a pretty steep up to get on the ridge. I stopped at the Clarks Ferry Shelter and had a late lunch and filtered water and left at 5 to hike another 6+ miles and arrived at Peters Mountain Shelter just after 8.

I stopped by the Kinter view and was less than impressed. I took a short break and had something to eat. 
I ate lunch at a campsite that had rock chairs. That was pretty cool but the views are just not there in PA - or at least they weren’t today. 
I stopped at the Rausch Gap Shelter around 3:30 and filtered water and had an early dinner. From there the trail crosses a flooded  area where beavers have been busy. It really wasn’t that bad.

I took my first break in 5 miles at the William Penn shelter. I had some snacks and as I was leaving it started to rain. The rain did not last long. 
As I approached PA 634 Steve was doing trail magic. I had a coke and a small bag of pretzels. 
When I got to the 501 Shelter I stopped for lunch. Unfortunately they had no water so when I left I hiked the side trail about a mile from the shelter and filtered water for the day. 
Also after the shelter there were more rocks. I eventually made it to the spot marking 1200 miles from Springer. Less than 1000 to go to get to Katahdin.

I was on trail a little after 6 and encountered a fairly smooth trail - little in the way of rocks. That didn’t last too long as I spent time just trying to avoid the ones that were sticking up and killing my feet. 
By 8 am I had covered 5 miles and decided to take a break at the Eagles Nest shelter. I ate what was left of snacks in my backpack and posted my journal since I had a signal. After an hour break I headed out. I covered just under 4 miles in an hour. The trail was rock free and I cruised. 
Then the rocks reappeared and I slowed down to 2 miles in an hour. There is one section where the rocks stop and you end up on a dirt road only to be put back into the woods - and rocks. 
I eventually made it into Port Clinton and stopped at the Post Office to get my new shoes and a package from my daughter. I packed them into my backpack and headed to a restaurant for lunch. 
After lunch I headed back to the trail and under Rt 61. I then walked along Rt 61 about a mile to the Microtel. I checked in and showered and then headed over to Cabella’s, a restaurant for dinner and then to Walmart to resupply. 
I went to the bar in the hotel and met Quarantine and had a few beers with him.

We were hiking by 9:45 and had a steep hill to start with. The rocks weren’t as bad as yesterday or maybe my new shoes handled them better or it was a little of both. 
Also while at the hotel I put new pole tips on both poles. That made quite a difference today as well. 
I took a break at the first shelter and had an early lunch. After lunch it was a climb to Pulpit Rock and then onto the Pinnacle - neither of which had any views. After the Pinnacle it was a 5 mile walk on a dirt road. 
I crossed the paved road that the trail brings you to and then started another up to Dan’s Pulpit. I finally had a view as the skies were beginning to clear. After Dan’s Pulpit and most of the way to the shelter I had to deal with large rocks that moved and were slippery. 
When I got to the shelter there was a Boy Scout group that had taken over the shelter and had their equipment strewn about. Hopefully they are quiet tonight.

As I was going through a rock free area the sun was making beams through the fog. I had never seen it last for such a stretch of the trail. It was beautiful. 
The trail also brought you over some rocky sections including the Knife’s Edge which was challenging. 
As I got to a parking lot I noticed a couple of canopies. Sure enough it was trail magic sponsored by the Allentown Hiking club. They had a ton of food and drinks. It was within a mile of where I was going to stop for lunch. I had 2 hot dogs, 2 cookies, a brownie, some macaroni salad, some cucumber salad and 3 cokes. Needless to say I didn’t need lunch after that. 
After lunch I had 9 miles to get to a parking lot in Lehigh Gap to meet my friend Matt who had driven from CT to meet up with me. He brought soda, beer, snacks and a large sub.

We were up by 6 but didn’t leave until just before 8. The tent fly was wet and we decided to hang them out to dry before packing up the tent. 
The trail was similar to the past few days - annoying rocks sticking up to irritate your feet. Along this 20 mile section there is little water and where there is water it is .6 off the trail on a steep downhill. We got to one road crossing and a trail angel had left a case of water. I downed one bottle and used another to refill my Gatorade bottle. 
We continued to the Clyde Smith Shelter where White Walker and I had lunch. From there it was a 5 mile hike to Wind Gap. When I got to the road TicToc a ‘15 SOBO was doing trail magic with his parents. I filled up on water and had 2 Gatorades. Then they offered to drive us to a restaurant in town - and pick us up. 
When we got back to the trailhead Quarantine and I headed to the Tentsite 3 miles in. TicToc drive White Walker back to his car in Palmerton and then White Walker drove back to the trailhead at Wind Gap and hiked in (with beer) to where we were camping.   We sat around talking until almost 10.

We had one section called Wolf Rocks that was a bit technical and we also had some of those annoying rocks but not as many as in the previous days. 
We made it to Kitterridge Shelter and I stopped to use the privy and have an early lunch. From the shelter it was about 5 miles to DWG. Once I hit the summit it was a fairly steep down to the town. 
I had received a text from Quarantine that he was at the pizza store so I headed their and got a sub and several sodas. I also got a sub to go for dinner. 
We headed out of DWG and walked the sidewalk alongside I-80. About 3/4 of the way we passed the marker indicating that we had crossed into New Jersey. 
We stopped at the visitor center and refilled our water and then headed under I-80 and back into the woods. The climb up takes you around Sunfish Pond. The hike up was gradual but my feet were feeling the effects of the rocks from PA so I took it slow. 
I got to the Mohegan Outdoor Center just before  8.  As I was looking for the bunkhouse I ran into another person staying here. He was with a group that had hiked in 2002 and they were having a reunion. He invited me over for a beer.

I finally stopped - took some Advil and changed my socks. Not sure what worked or if the rocks just subsided but my pace got back to normal. 
I caught up with Quarantine at the High Point State Park office. I got a couple sodas and refilled my water. After the break we continued into the park and hiked up to the highest point in New Jersey.

Most of the hiking today was in the flatlands. We hiked through a National Wildlife Refuge and had a mile walk on a boardwalk. Mix in some bog boards and that was our day. 
Around noon we came in a small river so we decided to eat the subs we packed out. They were very good. 
Around 3 we came to a road crossing and .1 off the trail was a nursery that sold ice cream and soda. I got a pint of ice cream and 3 sodas (one to pack out). We were under the impression that it was only a 3 mile hike to the campsite so we took our time and dried out our tents from the dew that had accumulated on the tent fly.  It turns out that when you are not on the trail the app will misjudge the distance. In this case it was five miles to the campsite and one mile was real steep.

From the cabin to the Wenturri Shelter was all downhill and less than 3 miles. I stopped there to use the privy and then continued on to Rte 12 where there was a farm stand. I ate a blueberry turnover, a pint of ice cream and had two sodas. That should be enough to power me up the big hill that was next as you go north from Rte 12. 
The day was a mix of sun and clouds. Warm but not really humid and the terrain was like a roller coaster. Up, down, repeat. 
I arrived at the Thistle Hill Shelter around 4 and stopped for a late lunch. I didn’t take much time as I decided it was too early to setup camp and I would hike into West Hartford which was five miles away. 
As I came out of the woods and onto the road and started walking into town a pickup truck slowed and asked if I wanted a cookie. Sure, I’m not going to turn down food.

Since I had just resupplied so my pack was heavy and even though it was early it was still humid. I was drenched in sweat in no time. 
Within four miles we hit the 1900 mile mark of the hike. Less than 300 to go to Katahdin. The morning was spent scrambling up and then down peaks. Around 1:30 I arrived at the Genetian Pond Shelter where I ate my lunch. 
As I was packing my backpack to leave after lunch it started to rain. Not really a downpour but just a steady rain. It actually felt refreshing and the temperature cooled and the humidity went away. 
From the shelter there is an up of about 500 feet then a brief down and then you start the climb to Mt Success. The climb was just under 2 miles with 1k feet of vertical climbing. 
When I reached the summit the trail went down steeply in sections some of it through boulder fields. Then I came upon the sign indicating the state line between NH and Maine. I have now crossed into the 14th and final state on this hike. 
From the border it was a half mile to the side trail that leads to the Carlo Col Shelter. Here with 4Runner, TBD, Nuggs, Tips and a few more.

Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656156,"I was hiking by 6:30. I knew it was going to be physically challenging and it was. The weather called for thunderstorms starting around 2 and humid and cloudy otherwise 
I had three Goose Eye mountains to climb. Goose Eye, Goose Eye West Peak and Goose Eye North Peak. They were all relatively brief but steep scrambles. Most had either ladders or rebar stairs drilled into the rock. Where it was flat there were bog boards and deep mud if you go off the board. Add to that a light rain shower to make the rocks a bit slick. 
After the North Peak there is a steep down to the Mahoosuc Notch. The Notch is a mile long section of giant boulders that you need to go over, under or around. It is known as the hardest or most fun mile on the AT. I had to take my pack off three times so I could fit through. It took me over 1 1/2 hours to get through that mile. At one point I slipped and hit my head on a boulder giving me a pretty good bruise on my forehead. I also broke a trekking pole on the same fall. 
After the Notch the AT goes up the Mahoosuc Arm - a steep 1 1/2 mile rock slab. I saw Calico and Hawk at the summit and then I headed down to Old Speck Pond. My friend Chris was going to meet me at Old Speck Mountain but got a late start so I met him on the trail. When we got to the parking lot he brought out the sub, chips, beer and other trail magic.  Our visit was cut short by monsoon rains. Chris left and I hiked another 2+ miles to the shelter.

While they were gone I ate breakfast and packed up my wet tent and headed out around 10. 
It was a steep mile up to West Baldpate and I was going slow. I finally reached the summit and headed over to East Baldpate. There were rock slabs that you had to climb - nothing real steep but they were wet so I took my time and eventually arrived at the summit. 
The hike down from the summit was steep, rock slabs, ladders and wet. Eventually I made my way down and hit a dirt trail.  I made it to the Frye Shelter and stopped for lunch. I ran into Rusty who told me he had canceled his room at the Cabin so when I got signal I called and booked a room. 
The hike from the Shelter to East B Hill road went by fast. I was feeling better and it was mostly downhill. I got to the road by 4:30 and the shuttle was there to pick me up.

I crossed Rt 17 and there was more up but the rest of the day consisted of moderate to small ups and downs. I hiked past several ponds and walked across many bog boards to avoid the mud. 
I stopped at the Sabbath Day Lento for a quick lunch and then continued on. After lunch was more of the same - ups and downs but nothing serious, ponds, bog boards and mud. When I got to Long Pond I sent a text to Chris (someone I had hiked with in ‘14) and we agreed to meet at Rt 4 at 5:30.

The climb up South Crocker was steep at the bottom but then leveled out near the top. My original plan was to skip the town of Stratton but decided that I had enough elevation gain for the day and booked a hotel for the night. 
From South Crocker to North Crocker was a mile. A half mile steep down and a half mile steep up. Once I hit North Crocker it was five (long) miles downhill to Rt 27. 
I asked a hiker in the parking lot if they were going to Stratton and I was able to get a ride from them.  I was able to shower and go to dinner at the White Wolf. Rusty was sitting at the bar after just finishing his dinner.

After Avery Peak it was a significant descent and then multiple ups and downs to get over to Little Bigelow. The descent off Little Bigelow wasn’t bad and in two miles I arrived at the Flagstaff Lean-to. I filled up on water and continued on.

The rain that started at noon yesterday didn’t end until 6 this morning and my guess is that we received a couple inches of water. The weather was cool and damp with some showers as I headed out. It didn’t take long before I needed to cross a stream that was probably dry yesterday and today was overflowing its banks. I had no choice but to walk in the water and get my shoes wet (they were still wet from yesterday when I put them on). 
After about 5 miles I came upon the first river ford of the day. Again, I had no choice I jumped in and the water was almost waist deep. For this one river there are three fords before you get to dry land. A little further was the ford of the West Branch of the Piscataquis River. It wasn’t as deep but was wider. In a few miles there was the last ford of the East Branch.
