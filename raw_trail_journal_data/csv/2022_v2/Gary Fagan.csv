Gary Fagan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639249,I have just received my WOOLX products so I have all clothing for the start.  Only gear i'm awaiting at this point is the CTUG backpack that is a couple months from now due to back orders and a sleeping pad. I've assessed options for getting to the trail and as of now think the best option is to rent a car and drive to Gainesville GA and take a shuttle/uber from there.,,View Entry,"Jun 15, Tue",0
