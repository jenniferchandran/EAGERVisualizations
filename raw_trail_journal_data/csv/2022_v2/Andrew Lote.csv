Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648350,Found a hotel next to a mall with an REI so i could pick up a bear proof bag. Everyrhing was fine appart from the phone which required credit in a different part of the account. When i added credit Nat west sent a text saying it was suspicious and could i please text to say it was me. If they let the payment through i could have replied. Luckily i had wifi and a good friend to add some credit to my account with thier card or my bank would have locked me out of my account in a foriegn country.,,View Entry,"Mar 08, Tue",0
Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648352,Tazzy drove me from Atlanta towards springer mountain which is the offical start of the AT. As it turns out registration at Amacola gets you a tag which helps with hitching and discounts. The usfs service road was rough and we would probably have made it but luckily a 4X4 shuttle came past and offered to take me the rest of the way freeing tazzy and her rental car from the risk of grounding. Walked 9 miles to second shelter. Met a ridge runner who explained the no trace principles including grey water washing up. US army rangers were practicing in the area so went to sleep to sound of heavy weapons fire.,"Atlanta

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648560,good start but pushed too hard. Knees objected to too much downhill. Everyone agreed it was a hard section. Heavy rain comming will be a big test for the shelter repair. May take a zero in camp i have plentu of food and can just sleep in. Shame there's nothing to read. The hostels normally have a collection you can borrow from but reading half a book then moving on is just frustrating.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648353,Some steep ups and downs. I thought 8 miles was nothing but add a 25 to 30 pound pack and oh yeah actual mountains and its a reasonable distance for a day. Theres talk of bad weather coming. Some people are getting off trail already.,"Springer mountain

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648356,was aiming for the gap to dodge the bear canisters required section but the incoming storm looks big and my bivi shelter cant take 80kmh winds. Going to stop short at lance creek and ride it out there.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648357,storm was not too bad down inn the creek but food bag froze and inner tent froze to outer. Had to hot foot it over blood mountain without food. Water was like a slushy and restrained. Couldnt stop for long as was too cold. Made it to kneels gap and into town for a hotel to defrost.,"Lance creek

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648359,shuttled back to gap and did an on trail resupply. Expensive but time was short and was annoyed at spending as much time in hotels as on trail. Tough day heading for cheese factory. Its early days but 25% of thru hikers drop out at this point. Its been challenging but not that hard.,"Kneels gap

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648360,turns out those two tiny pull out patches really did need seam sealing. Im used to rain but not ten hours of constant downpour. It gets in any gap and knocks the condensation off the outer by pure force. Need to get to Hiawasa to dry out and resupply. Resupplied at hostel around the bend instead and solo camped alone in the woods.,,View Entry,"Mar 16, Wed",0
Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648361,met a mother and daughter team and travelled together for a while. At camp a family doing the AT was focal point. They invited everyone to play trivia eith them. It was a nice bit pf normal life. Everyone was happy ar crossing the first state line.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648382,walked through heavy rain to mile 90. Smart people had already hogged the shelter spots for the night by midday. Shoes and socks soaked but the paramo stuff dried quickly,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648383,realised the water was getting into the tarp at the pullout patches which had been overlooked when i did the seam sealing. Trying to keep the down quilt dry is now very difficult. Will get sealant at next town. Should make the first fire tower today.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648394,went to get the bus into franklin not realizing ot was sunday and they don't run. Luckily got a free ride from a shuttle to his next pickup which was one of the dearer hotels in town so mixed luck. Replaced broken treking poles and broke the ebook reader. Not had much time to read so not a big loss but had to pick up a paper AT guide. Outfitter had no silcon sealant for sale but leant me a tube from thier repair kit. Southern hospitality is very real.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648558,carrying too much food which is about half total pack weight. Ebook was broken in a fall so replaced AT guide with a hard copy which is actually proving easier to use than having to flip backwards and forwards between bookmarks. Missing the books to read for pleasure but there really hasnt been time.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648561,rain is coming. 12 people squeezed into a shelter for 8. Everyone was in bed by six o'clock as it was cold so it was like a slumber party. For those who dont know everyone goes to sleep at hiker midnight which is when ever the sun goes down. Its diffetent in the lodges or if there is a fire that needs watching.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648562,the shelter at Fontana is known as the hilton as unlike the normal 3 sided log buliding this one has three floors hot showers and a solo charger. The bad news is its so nice and free that people hang out for too long and you cant get a space. Still showr was nice. Trail magic came to us this time and stayed up till 11.30 which is a major late night for trail life.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648802,ok ive got bored of daily milages and locations so today im going to try ang give you some idea of life on the trail. Days are dawn till dusk and you do enough miles to make sure you reach the next resupply before runing out of food. Food is heavy so you only carry as much as you think you need plus a days saftey margin. Tortias oatmeal romin noodles and freeze dried potatoes are the main carbs with peanut butter meat protiens and pop tarts filling in the rest. Oh and snacks. Lots of snacks. Leave no trace principles mean you cannot use washing up liquid and must swill out and drink whatevers left in the pot. Naturally this leads to coffe and hot chocolate being used to wash out the pot whenever possible. Of course when you get to town you make up for the food with big meals.,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649093,For me this journey was all about the trail and towns were just a place to resupply. For many of the younger hikers in particular the trail is more like a massive pub crawl hiking from town to town and enjoying the pleasures of each. In truth i have been slightly seduced by warm showers laundry beer and pizza not to mention warm dry bed. The issue now is to find the right balance to keep on target and keep up moral with a few modern luxuries like takeaways. Its also a significant budget issue as you can spend a lot very quickly in town although the hiker hostels are not as bad as hotels it still adds up pretty quick,"

Andrew Lote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652422,Had to return a few days early as it was necessary to end at a city with rail links in order to make it to the airport on time.Lastminute.com were most unhelpful changing the flights as they would only talk to someone on the phone number given on the booking and the number provided would not take international calls.The email response was measured in days so effectively useless.My advice. Book your flights direct with an airline.I finished just short of 900 miles in and will be resuming at Haprers ferry cutting off around 200 miles.Â Its a shame but the objective was always the adventure not the thru hiker status.This will be my last entry for some time.,"
