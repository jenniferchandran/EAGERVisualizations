Utogg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657686,"Flew into Bangor from Denver last night! My first flight was delayed but then my second flight was delayed too, so I did not miss my connection. I really do have good luck traveling! I am always a little apprehensive about getting through TSA, ever since I got pulled aside for extra pat downs 3x times in a row. I only took trains for a few years after that. This was back when I had a blog about Green Anarchism, and realized my blog was followed by a guy who worked for homeland security and specialized in “ counter eco terrorism” aka  counter “ tree sitting” etcI could be imagining it, but I really feel like there was a connection between blogging about the unibomber, squatting on public lands, why rent is theft etc. and extra pat downs. Probably though my fbi file is quite tame. Anyway, I got through security without a hitch. After the flight, walked out of the airport in search of a cheap hotel. I saw several possible, “ stealth camping” spots but then started seeing some homeless people and lost my nerve. The homeless people were probably OK but it was dark, and I was in a strange town. Did not want to deal with crack head drama in the middle of the night. After I am more trail hardened and my beard is quite long and unruly everyone will assume I too am homeless and I will blend right in, and be able to forgo the one hundred and thirty (!!!) I had to shell out for a crappy room in a motel 6. Speaking of blending in, the next day, I made my way to the Concord bus station to get a bus to Medway where I will catch a shuttle to the AT Lodge to Millinocket, which will the next day take me to the trail! But anyway when I say “ blending in” what  I mean is that when I saw some young people here, that were not really “ krusty kids” but definitely hippy kids, usually when I see these lost souls, traveling around the country, I strike up a conversation and hang out with them a bit. They would see my big pack and ask me where I am headed and we would relate. But now I am afraid I have this generic  “ old white dude” look and just blend right into the back ground. There was an old guy, probably seventy five, who asked about the bus to Bar Harbor, rather loudly, stating how he was not used to taking the bus etc.Later this young hippy kid approached me and asked if I was waiting for the bus to Bar Harbor and when will it arrive. I said“ I don’t know”He said “oh I thought you were up there asking about it a bit ago, my bad”To a 20 year old hippy kid fifty one and eighty one seem more or less the same age. Never felt so uncool in my life! I guess it’s good to have self awareness. I Will to turn this “ new look” to my advantage somehow. Maybe I will eaves drop in on interesting conversations when everyone assumes I am hard of hearing.",,View Entry,"Sep 09, Fri",0

Utogg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658087,"So it’s been 10 days since I posted on here.A lot has happened! First I over estimated how fast I would be hiking. I thought I would be averaging 20 mile days but 10 is about all I can manage. If I push myself one day and do 19, the next day I crap out and do 6! The terrain is rugged. The trail is mostly roots and rocks and lots of ups and downs over small mountains and across rivers. 
There are many beautiful lakes in Maine.at night I can hear loons calling. Myriads of colorful mushrooms dot the trail, which runs through a mixed forest of Spruce, cedar, birch, white pine and other evergreens. Just a tiny bit of fall color so far.

So let me start from the beginning: 9/10 I summitted Katahdin. The owner of the AT lodge, lit a little fire under my ass so I charged up the mountain in 4 hours. There was a little snafu with the camping reservation.Baxter state park requires you to get a camping permit in order to summit the peak, so that you have a place to stay once you climb down. For most people, it’s a long day. But! …I could not secure one, they were all booked! But!…last time I summitted in 2015 I was down by 3 pm and antsy and to start the trail, so I gave my reservation to a random thru hiker and left the park and set out into the hundred mile wilderness all in one day. 
I told this to “Trash Panda” the nascent owner of the AT lodge. He was very very skeptical. He said “ last time I climbed up and down Katahdin ‘without trail legs’ it took me 11 hours.”
That rankled me! Let me Explain some lingo here: “ trail legs” is a term for thru hikers designating when they have hiked the trail for a month or so and have gotten in shape. You can’t really train to hike the AT because the training is basically to be able to back pack day after day for months on end. So basically the best way to train for it is just to do it because otherwise who has the time? So Trash Panda was basically saying he didn’t think I looked in shape enough to do it. I said some things about living in Colorado and hiking 14ers on weekends but he stayed skeptical. He took me to the trail anyway along with sone other hikers he was dropping off.
The ranger was more amenable to my plan and he wrote me a permit to hike the AT. It was 7:30 am. The sun was shining and I decided to go for it and get up the mountain and back down in 8 hours. 
The rangers let you keep your heavy long distance pack at the Ranger station and swap out with a light day pack. So I did that and charged on. I passed through mature forest and  some crystal clear streams, that were pretty much as beautiful as I remembered. 
After passing a large blueberry patch things got steeper and finally there was a mile long stretch of intense rock scrambling. Basically climbing on all fours over granite. In a few key spots there is rebar drilled into the rock to gain a hand hold. After this stretch you get to the table lands, which is flat and rocky with lots of rare tundra plants. At this point I was really feeling the climb up as I picked my way towards the peak. It was a beautiful clear day and from the summit I felt like I could see the whole state of Maine. Several hikers were gathered around the famous  wooden sign which marks the peak.Some were day hikers but a few, sporting tans and thick beards had hiked 2,200 miles from Georgia and were now finishing their journey in jubilation.
I lingered just a bit. A woman took my picture. I looked at the time stamp. 11:26 Ha! Trash Panda you sonofabitch! I told you I could do it! In another 4 hours I was back down.

Utogg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658127,"The last ten days have been a blur to be honest. So I am going to keep kind of a soft focus and give my primary impressions of the last week and a half, and not a blow by blow. The first day on the trail I stealth camped. Thats basically the term I use for when I run out of day light on may way to a shelter and get tired of walking and just find a flat spot to set up my tent. So thats what I did just outside the park. I have a guide book called “the Awol guide to the Appalachian trail” its pretty handy. It tells you the milage and waypoints along the trail, the elevation and things like that. Through out the AT, spaced roughly ten miles apart there are lean two’s/shelters. Usually a simple three sides log structure. They usually accommodate at least 6 people. There is usually a pit privy and a fire ring near by and also a source of water such as a stream or lake. So every morning I get up and look at my AWOL guide and set a rough goal of making it to such and such shelter (they have names like “cloud pond shelter” “wadleigh stream lean to” etc.) Most people have Apps on their phone now, that has all this info, but I am kind of old school. I carry the Awol guide out nostalgia basically.So as I was making my way south along the trail, I keep coming across all these “Nobos” aka “North bounders.” I was struck by what fine human beings they are! These are men and women who have hiked over 2,100 miles from Georgia, often starting in March, and were just a few miles away from completing the trail. They were tanned and thin with hardened muscles. The men were sporting some fine beards. Most had trekking poles and carried surprisingly light packs. Along all that way there is a natural selection with the gear. People figure out what works and what doesn’t. There is some type of equation: the more inexperienced and out of shape the hiker, the more likely they are to be over loaded with excess gear and huge cumbersome packs. They usually stepped aside on the trail to let me to pass. Impeccable manners, on these proud hikers! (They probably judged me as a day or section hiker by my lack of beard growth)  Some stopped to talk about the trail, a bit nostalgic about their journey. I talked to a couple from New Zealand and a 76 year old woman named “Birthday girl” who once she finishes will be the oldest person to complete the trail this year. A large percentage of thru hikers have just completed college. This experience is definitely something to put on a resume, it shows that they have mental fortitude, grace and determination and probably a good sense of humor as well. I hiked on a bit. My habit is to set an overly ambitious goal and then settle on the closest shelter near where I begin to crap out. The shelters are the social centers of the trail. Even though I tent, I hike toward them and check in and hang out. You usually encounter other hikers there and exchange info, ask each other their trail names, the story about how they got it etc.coming next: characters on the trail.",,View Entry,"Sep 20, Tue",0
Utogg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658504,"So, a couple weeks into my hike, I was feeling a bit bummed out. My Body was getting wrecked from hiking through Maine. I did Pikes Peak in June, up 7,000 feet and back down in a day, but the mountains out here are only 5000 feet tops, so what’s the problem!?!?Doing an inventory of my body: feet: soreAnkles: soreCalves: soreKnees: sore and making weird noisesHips: soreBack: stiff and soreShoulders: soreNeck: you get the picture On the AT in Maine the challenge is not so much the elevation gain but the trail itself. Eroded from nearly 100 years of use, the trail contains virtually no topsoil. It’s basically like hiking a (semi) dry stream bed. It’s all rocks and roots. So you never really get a stride going. You walk very irregular strides for hours at a time, you are always bracing yourself to make a series of little hops. Hop, dip, skip, jump, climb, jump up, jump down. Going down , can feel like a respite from the ascents, but eventually you find that your leg muscles are always flexed as you brace yourself going down, hopping from rock to rock. I seem to have some ability to over ride feedback from my body long enough to reach a pre determined goal, but I found that that’s only so useful. If I do a 20 Mile day, the next day I regret it.I began to be amazed that only 7 years ago I did this hike and was more or less unfazed. Not saying I was some type of stud athlete in 2015, I was hiking with a bunch of fellow knuckleheads and averaging just over 10 miles a day. We hit nearly every town and never passed up and opportunity to drink beer! But I did so some big miles at times to catch back up and I really don’t remember having full body pain. I remember my feet being a little sore after getting through the White mountains of NH and that’s about it.So I decided to take a couple extra days off in Caratunk and then a day off a few days later in Stratton. At the hostel in Stratton after hiking the bigelows, I could barely get up the stairs. I rested, drank a gallon of milk and by the next day the stairs were no problem! Victory!As I hit the trail, I decided to kind of reinvent my hiking style. Instead of tearing straight up every mountain and taking really big steps where I lift my whole body one leg at a time, I decided to take a serious of short continuous steps. What I hate is pausing half way up an ascent and feeling tired and dreading how much further I have to go. I think that’s why I developed a style of pushing really hard on ascents. But instead of tearing up and regretting it later, I decided not to not miss a beat and just keep stepping until I reach the top. Slow, well placed, short steps. I found that I could make very good progress this way and not even get winded. My heart rate probably stayed fairly low.This brought back my confidence, left me feeling that I can handle whatever the trail brings my way! 2 days into this new technique and I find that I am no longer stiff and sore! I think this will do me well as I hike through the whites.",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Sun",0
Utogg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658505,"As I reached the road crossing, Rangely, Maine was 9 miles to the right. I stuck out my thumb at a likely spot and tried my luck on a hitch to town. The funny thing about hitch hiking, is you have no idea if anyone will pick you up! But then they do! But standing by the road, you have no idea when or if it will happen. I get antsy. After 10 cars pass by, I decided to let 5 more cars have a chance and then I will start walking.Car number 4 I got picked up by a nice older couple: Mike and Meg. They asked me about my hike and asked where I was headed and they said they could give me a ride to the IGA.A few minutes into the convo, Mike informed me: “ I am a trail angel.” They bought me next weeks worth of food at the IGA, bought me lunch and a beer and gave me $20 for the shuttle back to the trail the next day.Mike is retired and has a bit of trouble walking around. But he became interested in the Appalachian trail by following thru hikers who post on YouTube. He mentioned a coupe of ones I know, such as “ Dixie” a triple crowner who hiked and made documentaries of the AT, the PCT, and the CDT.Mike realized that he lives close to the AT in Maine and that he could actually meet some of these YouTube “ stars” in person and help them with their hikes. So he did just that, meeting hikers at road crossings, shuttling them to town, bringing them whatever they may need. I have experienced hospitality like this, several times on the trail, and I never want to take it for granted. The best way I can pay them back is just with gratitude and by telling them sone stories and sharing my journey.  That way they can be part of it too. Trail angels are all around. They can be fellow hikers who give you a summer sausage when you are low on food. You meet them in towns, or even back home, when friends and loved ones send you packages in the mail! People have many reasons for hiking the trail. But in many ways it resembles a pilgrimage at times, and trail angels are special people who make it possible for people to complete their journey. One thing hiking the AT does is restore one’s faith in humanity. There are many many beautiful people in towns across this land, just living their lives and doing what they can for others.These best we can do as hikers is be good ambassadors for the trail and be kind to the people we meet, pick up garbage along the trail and in whatever state we end up, just try to be good neighbors. Thanks to all the trail angels out there who make this journey possible for so many people!",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Sun",0
