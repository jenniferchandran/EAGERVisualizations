Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647303,"Well after COVID ruined my AT hiking plans for 2020 and 2021, I'm finally going to do the trail in 2022 (or at least attempt it).  I'm going to do a section hike Mid/Late March from Damascus to Pearisburg, then head home for a few weeks before starting a Flip Flop in late April at Harpers Ferry (I'll skip over the section hike later...I need to be home in August for a couple weeks for my grandson's arrival). 
I have my section hike info loaded in my garmin and have done a first pass of my gear.  I’m getting a little excited about hitting the trail, and this mild weather is making me more anxious.   I'm unsure what pace I'll end up doing.  I'm giving myself up to 6 months to complete the trail.  I want to ensure I soak up the trail and small towns and don't rush through any sections...of course, my old bones need a little rest now and then too.

I was starting to play Pickleball, but after I twisted my ankle last week playing, I'm putting that on hold so I don't mess up my hike this year :)",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647304,"I've treated my clothes and gear with Permethrin, confirmed where I'll need shuttle pickups (and made sure they're still in business).  
I got my base weight down to 16.8 lbs, which is great for me.  It gives me 13 lbs for food/water.  This initial section hike (Damascus to Pearisburg) will help confirm the water and food I'll pack.  I'm starting with 5 days of food, but I'm anticipating 3-4 days before I reach my first resupply point at Partnership shelter (I'll shuttle to Marion), and 3-4 days to reach each subsequent resupply.   
I'm a little light on the calories/day that I've packed for, but I'm anticipating fueling up at resupply points and carrying an extra day's of food in case I bonk (I'll take advantage of trail angels too, when I can).  I'm carrying a few extra lbs of fat (literally, just a few lbs), which I anticipate will be gone after a few days of hiking.
I've also downloaded some episodes of ""Last Kingdom"", got a John Grisham novel, and will be bringing my knife for whittling...so I should have boredom covered, when not running from bears and snakes :)",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Thu",0
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647407,I drove to Abingdon VA today.  It was a long drive (almost 8 hours).  I’m resting in a hotel and doing a final gear check. I will drive to Damascus first thing in the AM and start hiking.  I didn’t get much sleep last night because I was a little anxious (typical for me the night before I travel).  I’m more relaxed now that I’m closer to hitting the trail.  I know I’ll get a good night’s sleep tonight.,,View Entry,"Mar 13, Sun",0
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647523,"I drove to Abingdon today, the day after the “big storm”.  The drive from Indy was uneventful, though I did see a couple cars off the road due to the previous day’s storm.  The roads were clear however.   I did go a little under the speed limit when I hit some of the one lane winding roads….just not used to them….I pulled over a couple times to let folks pass.  


I’m a little anxious to start the hike 😁.",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Sun",0
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647524,"I woke up early at the hotel in abingdon to make sure I was in Damascus on the trail by 8 (I know I should have stayed at a hostel in Damascus).  


It was a very cold start to the hike.  I wore a base layer plus puff jacket along with gloves and a balaclava.  They were all off by noon 😁. 


I wasn’t sure how many miles I was going to do my first day (either stop at Saunders or Lost Mountain shelter) and ended up making it to Lost Mountain.  I did go off the trail (half mile) to Saunders just to check it out.  Met Fancy Pants there and talked a while then headed off.  There was still snot on the trail and a few icy/slick spots, especially north facing slopes.  


When I arrived at List Mountain, Tin Cup and Reboot were already there.  We started talking about snorers and realized i forgot my earplugs…Tin Cup gave me an extra pair.  


Fancy Pants showed up a little later, along with a gentleman “The Breeze”. 


The first night on the trail was a little restless, but managed to get some sleep.","Damascus
",Lost Mountain Shelter,"Mar 14, Mon",16
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647526,"I got up around 7 along with Fancy Pants. The Breeze, who tented, was already gone (I think I know how he got his trail name). The other folks got up soon after. 


My goal was to Wise shelter, but I felt it at the end.  I stopped at Thomas Knob to rest a while.  I saw quite a few hikers by.  There was a young college couple who were backpacking for a few days and one gentleman was hiking across the country picking up various trails along the way.  He was carrying slot of gear (including camera) and was traveling with a short leg dog (just a bit taller than a basset hound).  I’m not sure how he does it, I couldn’t.  


I made it to Wise shelter and found it was packed with 2 families (5 adults, 3 kids) backpacking together. They even put a tent inside the shelter.  There is not tent camping around this shelter, and it was too late (and tired) to find another spot, so we were able to make due. 


I definitely got a much better sleep.","Lost Mountain Shelter
",Wise Shelter,"Mar 15, Tue",17.50
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647527,"I was able to hit the trail by 8. My goal was to hike to Hurricane CG, and when I reached the fork there was still over 4 hours of daylight and my legs felt good.  There was also a sign at the fork saying the bridge at comers creek falls was removed due to being unsafe and offered a detour in case of high water at the falls.  Since there hadn’t been much rain the past several days, and it only trickled today, I decided to risk it.  Glad I did.  The falls were nice.  The water was a little too high to rock jump it without getting wet. Since it wasn’t too deep, not moving too fast, and I could easily see the bottom all the way across, I went across carefully shoeless.  Surprisingly the water wasn’t too cold.  


I hid my stride, and this section wasn’t too rough, and made it to Trimpi shelter with about an hour of daylight left.  


I had the shelter to myself and took a top bunk after sweeping away a dead spider 😁.  I heard some noise at night that I could never tell if it was rain or mice….I did get a good night’s sleep.","Wise Shelter
",Trempi Shelter,"Mar 16, Wed",20.10
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647528,"One of the reasons I hiked 20 miles yesterday is because I knew I was going to resupply and stay overnight in Marion.  


I got to Partnership shelter at 1pm.  It’s a very nice shelter.  The shower hasn’t been turned on yet.  


I couldn’t get cell service, but a ranger directed me to a phone behind the visitor center.  From there I call Marion Transit for a shuttle ride to Marion.  It’s free and we’re willing to drop me off whereever I wanted.  Since I didn’t have cell service until I got to Marion I had the driver drop me off at Red Roof.  There are 3 budget hotels close toegether, so I used expedia to pick the one I wanted (went with the cheapest…Red Roof).  It’s also a short walk to Walmart/grocery store where I resupplied.  Also stopped at a Philly Cheesesteaks in the same shopping center.  It was good, but I think my belly wasn’t ready for it after being on the trail.  I got some snacks to eat tonight and tomorrow morning before I hit the trail.  It’ll probably be 9 before I start since the shuttle doesn’t open until 8.","Trempi Shelter
",Marion,"Mar 17, Thu",8.80
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647677,"With fresh legs and full belly, I got the first shuttle from red roof to My Rogers HQ(partnership shelter). The shuttle starts at 8 and I was able to start hiking by 8:50😁).  


I got to the train tracks and got a slight urge to want and jump on a train…maybe I was hobo in a previous life.  Five minutes after crossing the track a train came thru…missed my chance at sure death 😁. 


I got to the I81 interchange around lunch time and got a sandwich and mountain dew at the Village Truck stop. I ate and relaxed there for a while then started back hiking.  About a mile into the hike I wish I got 2 sandwiches 😁. 


I wanted to hike further than Davis Path Campsite, and found out about Reed Creek CS.  I got there with about an hour of sunlight left. It’s a nice site and got to listen to the water as I slept.  No one else was there.","Partnership Shelter
",Reed Creek campsite,"Mar 18, Fri",18.30
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647678,"I left Reed Creek campsite as early as possible.  I was dreading the slog up to Chestnut knob shelter (plus the ups and downs prior)


I was just trudging the whole day.  I kept my water bladder no more than half full (It’s a 3 liter capacity) to keep my pack weight down. I weighted until I got to the pond and filles my bladder.  I’m not crazy about using pond water (I use a Katady Befree) and had to fill my reservoir twice because there was too much gunk the first time.  There is suppose to be an unreliable spring further up, but I wasn’t going to try and find it (and I couldn’t). There is a small creek about 1-2 miles up the slog to chestnut that I may have used if I knew what to expect ahead of time.  


I got to Chestnut knob shelter and it was nice (it’s enclosed). It was very windy and the wind was blowing the whole time I was there and into the next morning.  I had to tie the door closed so it wouldn’t bang open.  It snowed a little that night.  The latrine has an awesome view (there’s no door).  You can make out the valley below between the leafless trees 😁


It was a good sleep","Reed Creek campsite

Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647679,"As mentioned in previous post, I woke up to snow at Chestnut knob shelter.  I had to wear all my cold gear (it was stripped off 3 hours into the hike as I descended. 


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> After about 45 minutes I felt well rested and hiked the rest of the way to laurel creek campsite.  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> You can’t go wrong with any of them.  I stayed at one that was just across the footbridge.  I had a tough time hanging my food, but got it done after a couple comedic efforts. 😁


While there I decided to make my next day a short one and only hike to Helvy Mills Shelter with a resupply and food intake in Bland. 


Sleep was good","Chestnut Knob Sheltee

Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647791,"Cold morning again. started with all my cold gear on.  started hike before 8
Bubba picked me up around 11:30 and dropped me off at subway.  walked back thru town to find supplies…couldn’t find cliff bars so went with some nature valley crunch bars to tie me over with snacks.  I found out if Bubba cracks his window while shuttling hikers, it means they’re really ripe 😁.  Bubba was very helpful in showing how to navigate a confusing intersection around VA 612.  If you’re NOBO go past the blue trash can and pass on the right.  do not follow the blazes on the opposite side of the road.  they are due SOBO. 


after getting supplies at grant’s, I laid on a bench in front of the courthouse for a quick car nap.  someone from happy feet hostel drove by and said “not going to get any miles that way”.  He mentioned his hostel and I told him that was my goal for the next day.  


I had thought briefly about staying in the motel in bland but decide nah…head to helvy mills.","Laurel Creek
",Helvy Mills Shelter,"Mar 21, Mon",9.10
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647792,"I had three stopping points lined up….hostel at 606,  Walnut Flats CG, or the unofficial campsite located in between.   I set off early (for me) this morning.  DJ, who arrived late on 3/21 was still resting i her tent. Her nephew was driving her to different AT spots to hike.  
When I arrived at 611, there were three folks there.  I didn’t get their names, but later found out one was Left Field.  One of the other ones was the nephew of the DJ and was waiting for her to arrive.  He was in a converted van and we got to taking about van life which I hope to do once done with long distance hiking.  After leaving them I ran into Swivel about a quarter mile later.  He was resting and trying to catch up to Left Field.  He mentioned some of his challleges and I was impressed that he was out here.  Later on I ran into PB and J.  That’s two people.  “PB” and “and J”. they were hiking southbound and we talked briefly.  PB has striking blue eyes.  I almost made a comment about them but realized “and J” could take me out with one swipe 😁. 


I pressed on a eventually passed 606, then passed the unofficial camp site then as I got closer to the Walnut Flats CG decided to take the first decent site i could find.  I found a nice one by the creek. I ended up at 20 miles and was pooped.  I was even too tired to eat dinner and fell asleep quickly after setting up my tent.","Helvy Mills Shelter
",Near Walnut Flats CG,"Mar 22, Tue",20
Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647793,"I started off near walnut flats cg. It started raining at 6am.  I think I’ve come pretty close to breaking camp in the rain while keeping all my critical gear dry. I actually set up my tent and gear the night before to make it easier. 


It rained all day and my progress was slow due to slippery rocks and wet leaves, but I trudged on. I wear a pincho in the rain and drape back over my backpack.  I prefer not to use rain covers and all my critical is already in dry bags in my backpack. One downside to is that my forearms and lower legs get wet, but I hardly notice since my core stays warm. 


I reached Doc’s Knob shelter and there were 2 folks already there. Jerry and Everett.  They were section hiking for a few days.  Thank heaven they were there.  All i had left for dinner was Ramen noodles, but Jerry offered me a polish sausage which i jumped at.  These 2 guys are in their mid 70’s and must have been packing about 50 lbs of gear and provisions.  They awesome. Everett build a fire that night and the next morning while also chopping extra wood for anyong that followed (he had an ax in his gear)  


Everett also brought in a couple mouse traps, but those moutain mice are smart. they ate the bait without setting off the traps. 


I went to bed early, but got up in the middle of the night to check out the stars.","Near Walnut Flats CG

Slippery Pig,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647849,"I woke up this morning to the sounds of mice eating some of Everett's food in his backpack :)   Jerry and Everett are early risers (just a little earlier than me).  Everett already had a fire going when I got out of my sleeping bag.  Jerry offered me a pancake, which I took of course :)  I started hiking before Jerry and Everett started, and was wondering if they would catch up to me...they appeared to be strong hikers.  A few miles into my hike I tripped on some brush which caused me to strain my knee as I went to catch my balance...ouch...I hiked on but felt the knee pain when going down hill.  I reached a scenic spot near power lines with a log to sit on.  I took the opportunity to relax, take some ibuprofen and some pictures.  I also had cell service so I checked messages and sent a few to my brother.  I was sitting for about 10 minutes then started to put my pack back on when I heard Jerry. ""Hey Jon"" (we used real first names).  Sure enough that caught up with me.  They were going to take a break there so we only talked a few minutes... I figured they'd catch me again later.I had to favor the knee the rest of the hike, but it was manageable  (BTW: it was all better the next day).  I took some rest and photos at Angel's Rest as well as another spot before it (I didn't get the name).  I made it to Pearis Cemetery where Honey Bun of HB Shuttles picked me up and drove me back to Damascus.  It was just us two and the conversation was good.  I learned a few things as well.   I will definitely be using him again later this year when I leap frog this section when completing my thru hike.","Doc’s Knob Shelter
