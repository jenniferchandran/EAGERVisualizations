Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646719,"Hike today was great. 14.4 miles. We slack packed so we only carried a day pack. It poured down rain ALL day. We were completely soaked. I learned a lot. One is once your boots and socks get totally soaked it doesn’t matter anymore and your feet will be fine. The other is that slack packing is the way to go when you can do it. 
The trail was like a river. The water was just running down the trail almost ankle deep. I posted a video of a waterfall that went across the trail. The bad part was there no views. Because we were in the clouds all day we could only see about 200 feet. I posted pictures of our “view” from blood mountain. 
It was in the 40s so no ice but was cold in the wind. I know others have had horrible weather so I feel blessed.","Above the Clouds

Rained today and got colder.  Was quite a bit of ups and downs. 
Tomorrow supposed to be in the 40s for the high and 20s for the low.   Planned for 11.2 miles.  I’ll see how it goes. Will send a few pictures in a little bit.","Neel’s Gap

Everything was iced over but it was sunny.  I’ll post a few pictures. Did 12.17 miles today with a full pack. I know it doesn’t sound like much but the extra two miles were really tough. It was a very steep uphill and then I had to walk back down the hill to refill my water. I got a resupply box yesterday that I mailed to myself at the inn.   
Staying at the blue mountain shelter tonight.  Sleeping in my tent outside the shelter because it’s warmer in my tent. Shelters only 3 sides. There is a guy Josh here with me who stayed at above the clouds Hostel. He’s a younger guy says he wants to do 22 miles tomorrow.  He is sleeping in the shelter so he can get an early start tomorrow and doesn’t have to take his tent down. Sounds crazy. He’s a nice guy. Another couple just showed up  they are staying in the shelter too I think 
I have an 8.8 mile day and then an 11 the next two days.  I am going to see if I can make closer to 10 and 10 but changing where I spend tomorrow night.","Hogpen Gap

Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646773,"Good day today.  Stayed at Steeltrap Gap last night. Got very cold and when I got up I was in deep fog. My tent got pretty damp on the outside. I was the only one there and it was little creepy seeing the fog roll in out of the valley.  Anyway the sun came up and I hiked onward for about 9.4 miles and got picked up by a shuttle driver and am now at a Holiday Inn Express in Hiawassee, GA.  
Taking a “zero” day tomorrow, which means no hiking.  I did a load of laundry already and went to a buffet some hikers were talking about. The buffet was terrible, which is unfortunate because it is right across from the HIE.  Going to put my tent up in my room so it will dry out. 
Just a few pictures of views along the way. 
Twp potential trail names. I forgot to mention that there was a second group of UGA students on the trail and they were moving quickly and came up behind me. I let them pass and one jokingly said “we name you “speedbump” because I was slowing them down. We ran into another hiker named speedbump and he told us his name came from similar circumstances. I think it’s a common name. 
I ran into another hiker and we talked for a while. He was pretty cool and said he retired as an agricultural extension agent for the US Department of Agriculture and his name was “professor”. He asked what mine was and I told him I didn’t have one and he looked at my pack and said we should call you “heavy lifter”. He was not a thru-hiker just a day hiker. 
Anyway. I’m exhausted and going to bed.  I need to figure out my nutrition and mileage and sleep.  This reminds me a lot of training for a marathon. There are times I feel like I run out of energy and hit the wall. On the other hand I can tell my back and legs are getting much stronger.  I’ll figure it out and dial it in.","Steeltrap Gap

Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646803,"Very hard day today. 11.52 miles. Made it to muskrat creek shelter.  Was going to stop at 10 miles but realized that tenting site had no water.  5 other people at the shelter here. 2 couples - one from Michigan and the other from DC.  And a young guy named Hollis from Lancaster, PA. He has no tent or stove and is wearing a big fur coat. He is friendly and tried to build a fire to cook but gave up. He stays in shelters. 
My shuttle driver was sick this morning so he sent his wife. She said he has colitis.  She is VERY religious and asked if she could pray for me. I said ok and she said like a 3-4 minute prayer for me. Stuff like “Dear Lord we ask that you watch over Joe and keep him safe on his hike . . “  and how thankful we are for him to have this opportunity to enjoy this wonderful outdoor world You have created . . .   It was very touching and totally unexpected. I thanked her for her prayers. She said she would pray for me on her drive home. 
Finally, I tried to update my Garmin using the computer at the Holiday Inn. It was a Gateway computer!  I think they went out of business in the 1990s. So I was unsuccessful. I will try again asap. 
 Barely one bar of service. Not sure if I can post  pictures tonight. I think I got a few posted. Made it through Georgia!  One state down 13 more to go.  


0.1 mile past the border is this “iconic “ gnarled oak. Two people told that “supposedly” it is the most photographed tree on the AT. I have no idea how anyone would know that.Also a view of the town I stayed in last night, Hiawassee, GA.","Dick’s Creek Gap

Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646856,"Hard day today. 9.42 miles but went over Standing Indian Mountain, the first peak above 5,000 feet for north bound (NOBO) hikers. 
The couple from DC, Rob and Helen, were with me at the tent site. While we were eating dinner we heard an owl hooting loudly close by. Helen said it was a Bard owl. I asked how she knew. She said she only knows one owl and that was it. She then imitated the call almost perfectly. It kept hooting and then we heard another one of the same owls hooting behind us. Then we saw it take off and fly towards where the first owl was. Pretty cool. 
Passed a side trail called the “Chunky Gal” trail. In Guthook someone wrote beneath it “make the rockin’ world go round”.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646857,"Long day today. Today I FINALLY got my pack adjusted properly. I kept thinking it was not tight enough and at the end of the day my lower back was really hurting to the extent that it was hard to hike the pain was so intense. Since tightening wasn’t working I loosened the straps. Immediate relief!  By pulling it tighter, the pack was resting on my lower back. When I loosened it up it slid down and was resting on my hips so the weight was being carried by my hips and legs. Still exhausted but at least no pain. We climbed Albert Mountain today. It was the first mountain you had to “scramble” up. There was lots of rock climbing and you couldn’t use your trekking poles. It also was over 5,000 feet. You could scramble and then rest and then take on the next section. It was at least half a mile. Once at the top the views were amazing!  There is an old fire tower there and you could climb part way up. I have a number of photos and a video I will try to post. Also I took a shot of the elevation profile in Guthook so you can see how steep it is. I must have claimed for 10 minutes and my Garmin watch registered no distance traveled because it was all up in a straight line. Also Albert Mountain is the 100 mile point on the AT north bound.  I took a picture of the scrawling on the fire tower and the geologic marker for the mountain  Ran into Hollis at the shelter. He’s the guy with no tent or stove and a big fur coat. It will be really cold the next couple of nights. He has no money and it sounds like he is estranged from his family. I told him I was worried about him and asked if he would come with us to Franklin and I would pay for his hotel room. He was extremely grateful. To be continued tomorrow.","Beech Gap

He told us he weighed 537 pounds. He lost 200 pounds after moving to Franklin from Chicago. Had lots of stories about his prior life as a social worker  Met up with a couple from WAY northern Michigan. He is a farmer!  His wife works for the local school district. Al and Sandra. He said they are 3 miles from Lake Huron. I have a picture of the three of us at lunch. We decided to slack pack for a few days. How long is indeterminate right now. At least two. Maybe three. Bobby brought us to Franklin to the Hilltop Inn, an old timey motel. It’s clean. Hollis came and I got him a room.  Al and Sandra were also worried about Hollis. He only has a kid size sleeping bag!  We went to 76 Outfitters in town here. Super nice outdoor store. They bought Hollis a sleeping bag and I bought him a stove and a gas canister.  Ate lunch downtown and then walked to Ingles to get stuff for tonight and tomorrow morning.","Long Branch Shelter

Got some pictures of us hiking.  Saw a nice waterfall. Will try to send a video of it. 
No restaurants open in Franklin, NC on Sunday!   We walked to the place that was recommended to us to watch the Super Bowl. It was closed!  We walked to the other end of town and found a Mexican restaurant open.  Ordered pizza from Dominos. Shared mine with Hollis. He is staying with Al and Sandra tonight. 
Slack pack tomorrow. 13+ miles.When you hike a lot with a group of people they are called your “tramily” which is short for trail family.  
Had a really good talk with Hollis today while we were hiking. Talked about books and movies and all kinds of stuff. He just bought the book Siddharta by Herman Hesse.  I told him I just re-read it within the last year. He was raised as a Mennonite on a family farm in PA.","Rock Gap

Was VERY cold this morning. My water tube froze.   I thawed it by putting it under my shirt and then it froze again.  Got picked up 7 AM.  Great views from Wayah Bald.  It’s 5,342 feet high. Don’t know why some are called balds and others mountains. I am sure there is an explanation.

On February 15 we had kind of an easy day. 7.36 miles. We had some very nice views from Wesser Bald. Will send some pictures and a video of the views.  We hiked along the ridge and it dropped straight down on both sides. I tried to take photos showing the steep drop offs. The trail and the ground on both sides was wide - at least 10 feet so I never felt I was going over the edge or anything.  There were sections on the way down where the trail switchbacked and if you weren’t careful you could get in trouble but it was fine if you went slowly. 
We ended at the NOC. Nantahala Outdoor Center. They are all about white water kayaking there.  I did a video so you can see the chutes the kayakers have to go through.  In the video I say it’s the Little Tennessee River but it is the Nantahala River. I also thought this was where the 1996 Olympic event was held but it was on Ocoee River, which flows into the Nantahala. 
We stayed at the Hike Inn. Tom and Nancy were wonderful hosts. They do your laundry and give you scrubs to wear while they are being washed. We all wore them while we went to a Mexican restaurant in nearby Robbinsville, NC.","Tellico Gap

Met two guys slack packing sort of all the way to Maine.  One of the guys and his wife live in an RV  and she was following them.  She only picks them up every 2-3 days but they were getting picked up that night because of the potential rain on Thursday

Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646954,"My longest day so far. 16.48 miles. We got some rain late in the day. We added on 2+ miles at the end to make our day entering the Smokies that much shorter. So now we have an 11+ mile day rather than a 13+ mile day when we do the climb to Mollie’s Ridge shelter. 
The start was almost straight uphill for 1.6 miles. They call that climb Jacob’s Ladder. I had never heard of it but Al and Sandra knew all about it from YouTube videos. 
About 4 miles from the end someone set up a little display of leprechauns or something. I took a picture. 
Today Hollis developed a new skill - reading while hiking. I told him the trail is so rough I can barely stand up using trekking poles and all of my attention. Going down is harder for me than going up. 
Today Hollis also moved on without us. I am taking a zero at Fontana Village and Al and Sandra are zeroing at the Hike Inn. Hollis wanted to stay on the trail and get back to the shelters. We left him at what is supposed to be the nicest shelter on the AT. They call it the Fontana Hilton. It is very nice. Double decker with two shelters connected by a roof. They have a bathroom up the hill that has heat, running water and a shower. Very nice. I think we will run into him again if he is able to stay on the trail.","Stecoah Gap

Today we started in Great Smoky Mountain National Park. I have a picture of me putting the bottom half of my backcountry permit in the box at the trailhead. You have to carry the other half with you through the park. Also got some pictures of the dam and the lake behind it and me on the dam as well as pictures of the lake further up the mountain

Derrick Knob Shelter to Mt Collins Shelter.
Today was a crazy hard hike. 13.43 miles and we went over the top of Clingman’s Dome, the highest point on the AT. The worst part was coming down the other side. There was a lot of  snow and it was thawing and re-freezing. It all flowed down the trail and the trail was a jumble of rocks and ice. It was very treacherous. I made it without falling but got to the shelter just as it was getting dark. Bulldog fell. He said he just laid there and figured out nothing was broken but he continued to just lay there because it felt better than continuing hiking. He made it after me. He is a super nice guy. Retired Navy Seal. He is only 66, so a young guy. 
Got some pictures and videos from Clingman’s Dome. Rain was coming but we still had some good views. 
Slept in the shelter because rain was to start at 2 AM, and it did. It poured!  The shelters have metal roofs and the sound was deafening.","Derrick Knob Shelter

 Mt Collins Shelter to Newfound Gap. 
Today was relatively easy day. Only hiked 5.82 miles down to Newfound Gap. Still had to deal with ice and snow and rocks but it was short. 
All week Al was worried that TN441, the only road through the park would be closed. Sure enough, when we got up in morning our shuttle driver texted that the road was closed because of high winds. Just to prove there is karma and it still works, when we got there we were met by a trail angel named Iceman. He said he was there since yesterday and he saw Hollis when he came through. The two talked and it turns out Iceman is from Lancaster, same as Hollis. Hollis told him we were a day behind him so Iceman decided to wait because he was aware they were closing the road.  He slept overnight in his truck at Newfound Gap to wait for us so he could give us a ride to Gatlinburg!  Whatever kindness we showed to Hollis was paid back immediately because we didn’t have to wait 12 hours in the bathrooms for the road to reopen. Iceman said a ranger asked him what he was up to and he said he was waiting for us so he let Iceman stay. Iceman has the exact same truck I do. A 2021 Toyota Tacoma with a six foot bed and the color was cement, just like mine. He has a cap on the back and he sleeps in the bed. 
We made it safely to Gatlinburg and I stayed at the Hampton Inn. Got laundry done, resupply etc. had a nice dinner with Eric and Mushroom, Al and Sandra, and Pete and I.

Newfound Gap to Peck’s Corner Shelter.  Medium hard day today. 10.69 miles.  It was supposed to rain all day so I put my poncho and pack cover on. It ended up being a beautiful day!  Had to take all that stuff off because I got extremely hot. Was supposed to hit 58 in the mountains.  It was probably the best hiking day so far. After a long steep climb we hiked along the ridge for miles and we had amazing views when the sun came out.  Also hiked through forests of hemlock which were stunning. I tried to take pictures and videos to capture some of the beauty but I am not sure they really portray what we saw today. 
Got passed by two ladies today. It was still very icy today at the beginning and I was standing still trying to figure out how to get around the icy path. Both of them just walked along the side so I followed them.  One of the ladies is thru hiking the AT and the other is driving an RV to support her.  In places where the AT doesn’t cross major roads the thru hiker lady has to sleep in a tent or shelter.  She plans to go from Newfound Gap to Davenport Gap in 2 days, a distance of 35 miles!  This is her 4th attempt to hike the AT.  Later in the week I saw these two again and talked with the lady driving the RV again.  It turns out she went to Centerville High School!  What a small world.  
Hollis is staying in this shelter!  It was good to catch up with him after our brief chat yesterday.  Bulldog is here too, as well as Al and Sandra and Eric, Mushroom and Pete.

Peck’s Corner Shelter to Cosby Knob Shelter.  Very hard today. 13.09 miles. Lots of climbing. Went above 6,000 feet again. As beautiful as yesterday was today was the exact opposite. It was cloudy and misty and raining most of the time. I took some pictures of the views and all you can see is mist. I also took pictures of the hemlock forests. They were still beautiful and kind of spooky.  Near the end we went through  a rhododendron forest. They were different than the ones I saw in Georgia. I tried to take pictures and videos to capture some of sights.  
Can’t believe tomorrow I will be through the Smokies.  They were scary and intimidating, mainly because of weather concerns. But tomorrow they will be behind me. 
Same crew as last night. We are at Crosby Knob Shelter. I am sleeping in the shelter because it supposed to rain again tonight and tomorrow 
Pete got word today that his brother in law passed away. It is a sad story but Pete said he had been sick for decades with MS.  He will leave the trail tomorrow.  Now I will be the oldest in this group.  Pete had me beat by one year. He is 68.  Bulldog is 66.

Cosby Knob Shelter to Standing Bear Farm and then to Newport, TN.  Today was a moderate day. 10.40 miles. We exited the Smokies!  Weather wise it was rainy day. When it rains as hard as it did, the trail becomes a stream. All the water just flows right down it. Was very wet. Not too cold but will be cold tonight and tomorrow. Tried to get pictures of the trail with the water just streaming down it.  The trail really acts as a gutter to collect all the water.  
I learned a lot from hiking the Smokies. One is that if you focus on how hard everyone tells you it will be you psyche your self out. All you can do is put one foot in front of the other and keep going.  Another is to just try to take in the beauty of nature as you pass through.  That can be challenging when it seems you have been hiking uphill for hours in the rain and cold. 
Got picked up near Standing Bear Farm by a shuttle driver whose trail name is Stripper.  It comes from when she was working on a trail crew and she was the fastest tree bark stripper on the crew.  She says she always tell young children her trail name is tree bark stripper.  Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Newport with Al and Sandra and Pete.  We went to Ruby Tuesday for dinner and it was great to have a salad.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Newport, TN to Roaring Fork Shelter.  Very tough day. 15.30 miles. Lots of climbing. Over 5,500 of elevation gain. Nothing hurt and I felt pretty good so I just kept going. Also was really no place to stop. They closed 8 miles of the trail to tenting because of bear activity and then no camping on Max Patch for two years because of overuse. 
Climbed Max Patch. Beautiful views. Have some videos. Rain was freezing on the signs when I summited. 
At Roaring Fork Shelter with 7 others. Pouring down rain. Rained most of the day. Very cold freezing rain. We had some guy come to the shelter at 6:30 or so. The shelter was full. He slept under the shelter. Shocked everyone.   
There was about a 3 foot crawl space in the back and he got in there. Everyone wondered about all the spiders and mice and who knows what else might be under there. 
He was ok and left early this morning. He was a super nice guy and was doing big mileage.  He did 22 miles to get there. His trail name is “Machine”.  I ran into him several times in the next few days, especially around Hot Springs.  He is from Virginia.

Hot Springs to Allen Gap.  Slack packed 15.3 miles. Was still long and hard. Definitely getting warmer.  Wanted to zero today but the lodge was fully booked and didn’t want to zero in the hostel, where I had to move to after one night in the lodge. 
This was my introduction to staying in a hostel. I will say up front that most people that stay in hostels are perfectly normal and you wouldn’t give them a second thought.  However, it always seems there are a few hangers on that just seem like unique individuals.  
When I got back from my hike I walked into the hostel. There was an guy standing by the coffee machine. He had on a mechanics shirt, like the guys wear when they work on cars at gas stations, and it had the name “Mick” on it. He had on purple and yellow bell bottom pants. I assumed they were loaner clothes you can wear while you do your laundry. I’ll refer to him as Mechanic.  
I asked how he was doing. He was all glassy eyed and asked me if I knew “Quadzilla”.  I said no. I have since come to see pictures of Quadzilla on FaceBook, and as Mechanic reported, he is attempting the Triple Crown within one year.  I think there are only 7 or 8 people that have accomplished that to date.  Mechanic immediately launched into this rambling story about how Quadzilla was going to hike the AT, CDT and PCT all in one year. Mechanic told Quadzilla he could keep up with him because he ran marathons. He said they left at 1:30 PM and hiked 19 miles and had to hike in the dark. Mechanic only had a small headlamp not designed for night hiking. Anyway, he made it to the shelter. When he got up the next morning he told Quadzilla he could not keep up so Quadzilla left him there. He said he then started hiking on a red blaze trail for 3 hours. He said he didn’t know why because he knew from YouTube videos he had to hike white blazes. He retreated back to the shelter and then it took him 2 days to make it back to the hostel. I asked if he was going to regroup and start out again and he looked like he didn’t understand my question.  He was starting his hike of the AT from Hot Springs.  Most people start at the beginning or the middle and hike northbound or the northern end and hike southbound.  I asked why he started his thru hike in Hot Springs.  Again, he looked like he didn’t understand my question and then said “Because I am here.”
Just then another hostel resident came in. He had a huge tangled up beard with stuff in it - it looked like food and leaves and I don’t know what else. The most alarming thing about him were his eyes. They were bulging out of his face. He came up to me and half shouted “I haven’t slept in 24 hours”.  He then launched into this rambling story how he can’t sleep on on the trail so he hikes 24 hours. He said he passes all the big mileage guys because they they are sleeping when he is still hiking. I was to going suggest this was likely not a sustainable strategy but he didn’t seem in the mood for unsolicited advice so I asked how he hiked around the ice in the dark. He said in the military they issue lights with 4 colors-white, red, green and blue.  He said he hiked at night with the blue light because it made the ice visible and he could hike around it. He then asked me where I was from. I said Ohio. He asked Mechanic and apparently bearded guy thought Mechanic said Hawaii. He shouts out “I love Hawaii”. Mechanic says not Hawaii, LA. Bearded guy shouts “I hate LA”. 
At that point I said hey guys, I am going into my room and get my pack unpacked. Catch you later. 
Later I went outside to do my laundry. The hostel has the washers and dryers in a wooden cabinet on the side of the building.  As soon as I came around the corner there were several chairs around a kind of coffee table. There was a guy with huge Rasta braids and he had a dog on a leash. The dog lunged at me and started barking. Rasta man said he’s very friendly and is just talking to you. That was not the first thought that came mind. There was another guy sitting there and we started talking - the usual stuff. Are you a thru-hiker, what’s your trail name, when did you start, etc. He thru-hiked the AT in 2016 and was living in a back room in the hostel. He said he did IT work remotely and was saving money so he could go to Oregon to hike the PCT with friends. 
I felt like the guy in an old movie called The King of Hearts. The film is set in a small town in France near the end of World War I. As the Imperial German Army retreats, they booby trap the whole town to explode. The locals flee but there is an asylum on a hill above town. As the locals leave, they open the gates to the asylum and, left to their own devices, a gaggle of cheerful lunatics escape the asylum and take over the town — thoroughly confusing the lone Scottish soldier who has been dispatched to defuse the bomb. 
And that is why I chose not to zero in the hostel and to continue hiking and fall way behind in my trail updates.","Hot Springs, NC.

The first scramble got me to the ridge line and some nice pictures. The second went up a mountain called Big Butt. It was really hard to tell where the trail went and I ended up climbing to a ledge that went nowhere and then had to come back down and search for the trail. Eventually found it and continued on.

Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647830,"First day back on the trail since March 6.  Almost didn’t make it. Yesterday I picked up a rental car to drive to Kingsport, TN. I spoke with the lady at the Herrz counter at Tri-cities airport to confirm they were open until 11 PM. I asked her where I should refill the gas tank. She said Shell was the closest gas station to the airport. I got gas and when I got out I left the keys in the car and the doors locked. My phone was on the front passenger seat. The guy running the convenience store let me borrow his phone and I called Hertz and after evaluating several options, and about 75 minutes, a locksmith called Pop-a-lock came and opened the door. I got the car returned at 10:50 and got about 6 hours of sleep before getting picked up at 7 AM. 


Today was a good but tough day. 13.53 miles and over 4,600 feet of elevation gain. Started at the Nolichucky River by Uncle Johnny’s at about 1,600 feet and ended at a campsite just below the summit of Unaka Mountain at about 4,900 feet. Hiked through Beauty Spot, which is a bald with panoramic views. 


Ran into some trail magic today. Renee and David pulled their truck up a forest service road and set up a kitchen, making grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, heated honey buns, as well as assorted fruit, drinks and other snacks. I had the sandwich and honey bun and they were delicious.  David said they do trail magic as a way to tell people about our Savior, Jesus Christ, and then told a story about when he hiked the Camino de Santiago in Spain. The trail is much busier than when I left. I was passed by at least 8 hikers, although tonight I am in this particular campsite by myself.


Met a thru hiker at trail magic from Wales. His trail name is Taffy, and he said in the UK, Taffy is used to designate someone from Wales. Interesting fellow. Now lives in Colombia, South America. He is doing big miles - he said he just did back to back 22 mile days - so I don’t think I will see him again.

They will be fine when lows are in the 30s and 40s but not low 20s and teens, which is what is forecast for the next couple of days. If I managed to doze off I woke up shivering, mainly because cold from the ground was coming up through my sleeping pad. When I got up there was snow on my tent and the ground. Not a lot but I heard it all night pinging off my tent. I have some pictures. 
It is supposed to be in the teens tonight with a wind of 15-20 mph so around 6 AM I texted my shuttle driver and asked if he could pick me up at the closest gap where the trail crosses a road. He said yes and picked me up at 1 PM. 
I hiked 6.8 miles to get to Iron Mountain gap. I went over Unaka Mountain with pine and spruce forests at the top. Very beautiful especially with a little snow. I have a few other pictures from today’s hike I’ll try to post.

Probably the most scenic or one of the most scenic hikes so far. The Roan Highlands are beautiful!  I think what makes them so unique are the views for such an extended period of time. 


Hiked 14.81 miles today. It was very cold and windy to start. It warmed up a little as the day went on. Also, the ground is still frozen and when the sun came out and the temperature got above freezing, the top layer of mud started to melt and it was slippery in spots. There was still ice on the trail too.  I have some pictures of the ice. 


Got a number of panorama shots and videos to try to capture the day. It was basically a series of balds - mountain tops with no trees - for miles. Because of the lack of trees on the higher elevations, I had 360 degree views all day. I got a picture of a shelter along the way - the Stan Murray shelter and a distant shot of an old barn along a trail that was used during the Revolutionary War times that has been updated and turned into a shelter for AT hikers.  Stan Murray was a forest service employee and leader of the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy. 


Also, I think I am through North Carolina!  I posted a picture of the sign saying leaving North Carolina. So two states down and 12 to go.

Things are getting better!  


Passed the 400 mile mark today!  Someone had a marker made out of sticks to mark 400 miles. It was right on with the FarOut (Guthook) app. I took a picture and video. Only a little less than 1,800 to go!


I passed 2 noteworthy waterfalls today.  Jones Falls and Mountaineer Falls. I took pictures and videos of both. Jones Falls was larger. 


I am camping beside a stream and the sound of the water is very comforting.  There is a sign. On one side it says Laurel Fork and on the other side it says Upper Laurel Fork. 


Met a number of interesting people on the trail today.  I met an older couple who are thru hiking but have two cars and stay in hotels or hostels most nights. The guys trail name is Steamer and the lady’s trail name is Ohdi, which she said stands for “out here doing it”. 


I finally talked to a younger guy I have seen several times whose trail name is Giggles. He is hiking with 3 other guys and they have been slack packing for a couple of days. 


I also ran into Bolt, whom I have talked with before, as well as Reece and Amanda.  I never saw Reece without his hat so when I saw him today I didn’t recognize him. He is bald as a cue ball!  Super nice guy.  Has a ZPack similar to mine.  Amanda wasn’t feeling well and that is why the three of them were slack packing too. 





The breakfast spread this morning at Mountain Harbor B&B was over the top. An egg soufflé, potatoes, tomato pie (I had a piece-it was quite good), as well as pastries and lots of other stuff.I sat with a couple from Poland. They live outside Chicago now. I told them all 4 of my grandparents came from Poland but they didn’t want to talk about Poland.  We talked about hiking instead. I showed the wife the FarOut app and she said she had been looking for it. The husband’s English was not that good. They kept asking me if I was worried about getting eaten by bears. When I finally convinced them bears were not a big concern they switched to snakes. I told them the biggest hazard was ticks.  They were unimpressed.

Weather wise, today was the best day yet.  Today was the first day I could drink water at a water stop and not get the chills. Water is one of the heaviest items to carry in your pack. Three liters weighs more than 6 pounds.  So when you are trying to keep your pack under 30 pounds, or at least under 35 pounds, you don’t want to carry much water. Hikers employ a concept called “cameling up”. The way it works is you stop and filter water along the way and drink as much as you can - something like one to two liters- to get you to the next water stop. Water stops are generally 3-5 miles apart, so you need to drink enough to hold you for the next 1.5 to 2.5 hours, sometimes longer.  When the ambient temperature is cold, the water is freezing cold, and every time I drink it I get chilled and immediately have to start hiking to get warmed up. Today, finally, I was able to sit by a nice clear mountain spring and drink water slowly and not get the chills!  Things are getting better. 



The high was supposed to be 64 today and it was a beautiful day to hike. Sunshine and a blue sky. It was still windy but the wind felt great. It helped cool us down.
Hiked 12.40 miles today to end at the Black Bear hostel. Not a lot of climbing, but still over 2,600 feet in elevation gain. Got some pictures of a stream and water rushing over boulders called Hardcore Cascades. Also got a picture of the white blaze for mile 420. Someone wrote the numbers in the blaze. 420 means something in the stoner culture but I am not sure what. The only reason I know is Outside magazine had a little article about people stealing the sign for mile marker 420 repeatedly in Colorado so they now put up a mile marker that says 419.9. Got some pictures of wildflowers coming up and saw at least two butterflies today. 


Saw the same crew as yesterday. Steamer and Ohdi, Bolt, Reece and Amanda and a woman that passed me yesterday named Annie. Steamer and Ohdi are the people with two cars who stay in hotels every night and Bolt, Reece and Amanda are slack packing out of a hostel up the road called Kinkora. Annie stayed at one of the shelters before my campsite last night so she was not slack packing, but she was still flying, despite a full pack. She started 3 miles behind me and met up with everyone at the Moreland Gap shelter at lunch and then took off again never to be seen for the rest of the day. Steamer and Ohdi were doing 17 miles today, their longest day yet. 


Supposed to rain tonight, all day tomorrow and most of tomorrow night. Then it is supposed to get cold again. In the 20s at night. So I am slack packing tomorrow, doing about 13.4 miles. Then I’ll have to see what’s next. There is a hostel half way between Black Bear and Damascus, but the second day I’d have to do 16.4 miles with a full pack and a 2,000 foot climb at the start.

Today I planned for rain based on the forecast but ended up with a great weather day.  It was in the mid 60s and generally sunny, although it did cloud up at times. Hiked 13.66 miles.  I generally went up and then down one mountain - Pond Mountain, although on Guthook they show it as Pond Flats. I did get a short video showing how flat it is on top of the mountain. 


I saw some very beautiful waterfalls. They are Laurel Falls and maybe the best yet, although Amacalola Falls on the approach trail were pretty spectacular.  Laurel Falls are wider and shorter.  Near Laurel Falls was a second waterfall.  It didn’t have a name.  Guthook just said Laurel Gorge. It reminded me of Clifton Gorge in Ohio, but a lot bigger. I got a video of that too. 


The trail goes around Watauga Lake, which was created when the Tennessee Valley Authority dammed up the Watauga River.  That was a beautiful part of the hike. Very flat and it reminded me of Caesar’s Creek Lake in Ohio.  At one of the places where the trail went around the lake they had picnic tables and since it was a warm, beautiful day I sat there in the sun and had snack. There were geese close by and they were upset at first that I was invading their territory.  


Saw most of the same crew from yesterday.  Got passed by Annie first, then Bolt, Reese and Amanda. They are all staying at the Boots Off Hostel tonight.  Did not see Steamer and Ohdi. I know Steamer was concerned about rain and they were trying to do as short a hike as possible just getting up and over Pond Mountain.  I heard him say they were going to hike between 11 and 3.

The good news was it only lasted about an hour and then there were a few 5-10 minute rain events up until about noon. Around 2 PM the sun came out but the wind was still very cold. 


The trail was in excellent condition. Not too rocky or rooty and I was able to make good time. Got some pictures and videos of views of Lake Watauga and some rhododendron tunnels. 


I saw very few people on the trail, and none of the crew I was used to running into. When I got to the first shelter around 11, there was a guy and his dog there. His trail name is Tennessee Slim. He had just come back from getting water. He said he was going to make coffee and oatmeal and then start hiking and planned to stay at the next shelter. 


I ran into a couple that looked like day hikers and near the end ran into Figs. I have seen him before.

Today was an “easy” day. I always complain that we never have an easy day - even the easy days are hard. Well today was easy. Hiked 11.44 miles and averaged 2.6 mph. I am usually at 2.0 or 2.1 mph. I think the explanation involves a combination of a several things. One is that the elevation is just not as high now. A second is this particular day I was mainly hiking along the ridge line for 5 miles and then downhill for the remaining 6+ miles.  The elevation gain today was “only” 1,375 feet. And the final reason is I feel I am starting to get my trail legs. I hesitate to say that because I don’t want something to start hurting and derail my hike. 


I finished Tennessee today!  So 3 states down now and 11 to go. Virginia will be a LONG state though. Virginia has more miles than any other state - more than 550 miles. 25% of the AT is in Virginia. 


Not a lot of views but I did try to get a few pictures and videos.  


Saw a number of the usual hikers. Saw Ohdi and Steamer at the very beginning. Hadn’t seen them in a couple of days. I saw Tennessee Slim and Annie at the Abington Gap shelter where they stayed last night when I hiked past it this morning. Ran into another couple hiking with two cars and staying in hotels most nights. They are going north but hiking south each day. They have a dog with them. They were planning to spend one night in a shelter between Damascus and the gap where TN 9 is located. They were upset that that section of the trail was closed to camping because of aggressive bear activity. They were not sure what they going to do. 


I got to talk to Annie a little more. She said will only live in her tent for a couple more months and then intends to go to Wyoming for the summer. I asked her what she would do there and she said she would figure it out when she got there. She of course passed me on the trail when I stopped for lunch. When I got to Damascus she had headphones on and was dancing in a park by herself like no one was watching. I took a very short video because it looked really cool. When I passed her she waved and gave me a big smile and kept dancing.  





The trail goes along the park and when I got there a young boy was taking a picture of his dad under the sign welcoming hikers to Damascus. I asked him to take my picture and he was very happy to do so. He had a Cincinnati Reds fanny pack on and I said he had to be a true baseball fan to cheer for the Reds, almost as much of a fan as you have to be to cheer for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  I explained where I was from and his dad said they were from Kentucky and the Reds were the closest team and that his son really loves baseball.I am staying at the Lady Di B&B and will zero here tomorrow. I have been hiking for 10 days straight. I took a picture of the picture outside my room. It is of Princess Diana.

Went to dinner with a guy from Napoleon, Ohio, which is close to Toledo, and an ER doctor from Hampshire in the UK. She is hiking with her husband but he is 100 miles behind her and they intend to catch up in 2 weeks.  


One final point. I asked Rabbit why he stopped wearing shoes. He said when he was doing his southbound thru hike in 2017 he read a book called The Barefoot Sisters Southbound, By Lucy Letcher and Susan Letcher. The book is about two sisters who hiked the AT barefoot!  He said when he got to the last half mile before Springer Mountain he said it’s now or never so he took his shoes off and hobbled the last half mile and gradually stopped wearing shoes after that.

Very hard day today. Not sure why.  12.2 miles with over 3,500 of elevation gain. 


At Thomas Knob Shelter with 4 other guys. 2 from the UK. One is Taffy from Wales.  I expected him to be way ahead of me.  He pushed too hard and strained a tendon and ended up spending 5 days in Damascus waiting for it to get better.  


I am in the upstairs of the shelter by myself. I could have squeezed in on the bottom but it wasn’t worth the effort. Also the upstairs is much cleaner. Supposed to get thunderstorms tonight and then very cold through Monday. Back down in the 20s with sleet and snow. Then Monday it’s in 60s. 


I might stay at the Sufi Lodge during the cold spell. Sufis are the ones that do the whirling dervish. It’s run by a husband and wife. Mixed reviews on Guthook.  All the meals are halal.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Went through the Grayson Highlands.  The rocks were very hard to navigate.  It was not a particularly hard day just very slow going through the rocks. I tried to get pictures of the rocks and roots to give an idea how rough the trail was. 


Slept in the Thomas Knob Shelter upstairs by myself (other people on the lower level) and there was a fantastic thunderstorm at night.  I was about two feet from the metal roof and it was very loud. After a while it just became white noise. I had no problem sleeping and it was probably the best night I had sleeping on the trail. The lighting was spectacular. There were two windows upstairs and at first I thought someone was climbing up the ladder with a headlamp on because it was so bright and lit up the upstairs. 


When I left the shelter two ponies came up and I talked to them for a little bit. There is a herd of wild ponies that live in the Grayson Highlands. 


I crossed over 500 miles today. There were a couple of markers. It’s hard to believe I am over 20% done. Hopefully hit 600 miles next week.

Spent the night at the Sufi Lodge. It is run by a husband and wife team - James and Suzzanne. It was a very nice place to stay. I talked with James to understand the Sufi religion but didn’t get very far. He converted to Sufism when he became very sick and was praying for a return to health. I don’t know how he got pointed to Sufism but he said it answered all his questions and saved his life. His kidneys failed and he has to do dialysis regularly.  His wife Suzzanne cooks and made very good halal meals. She is legally blind and can only see out of the center of her eyes. No peripheral vision. I had two dinners and two breakfasts for the two nights I spent there. 


Hiked 14.44 miles today. Got some pictures of waterfalls. It was a medium day. 2,654 in elevation gain so not bad. The first half of the hike was fine but after noon it started raining and kept up the rest of the day. Just a cold steady rain with lots of wind. Some snow mixed in too. Wore my poncho most of the day. 


I hiked some with Gary, a guy I met in Damascus. I think he is a couple years older than me. Very nice engineer who worked for the NSA. He is in one of the videos I took and also stayed at the Sufi Lodge. Suzzanne took our picture when we were eating dinner. We are both in thobes because that is what the Sufi Lodge uses for loaner clothes when you get your laundry done.","VA 603

Short easy day today. Only 7.86 miles. The reason I stayed at the Sufi Lodge was because the weather turned very cold with lots of rain and snow.  The hike today was a winter wonderland. It was very beautiful as the snow blanketed everything. It was only an inch or two deep but the wind blew it so it stuck to the trees. It snowed most of the time I was hiking. I wore my poncho almost the entire hike. 


Got picked up by James at the Mt Rodgers Recreation Area HQ, which the AT goes right by. Got dropped off at the EconoLodge in Marion, VA, about 6 miles away. Going to zero here tomorrow. It’s ok. It’s old but clean and I can walk to Walmart and Ingles.","VA 670

Good day today. Hiked 13.34 miles. Lots of climbing at the beginning and then a long down hill and then some rolling hills. 2,724 elevation gain.  


Totally different day than Saturday with the snow and wind. Today was very spring like. Got pictures of May flowers coming up already.  Saw other flowers poking through too. 


At a campsite at mile 547.4. Six other tents here. I know most of the guys. Giggles, Shepard, Reece, Ken Again and a few others. 


Giggles and Shepard and their crew are much younger. They have to finish the AT by August so they can go back to college. I think they’ll make it. It’s amazing how much energy they have. After dinner, they organized a game, kind of like corn-hole.  It involves trying to throw a rock into your shoe from about 20 feet away. They developed this elaborate scoring system if it hits the shoe and double points if it goes in and I don’t know what else.  They are also drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and vaping.  I think they are having a good time.

Flowers are starting to blossom. Got a picture of a rhododendron bud. Saw 3 deer.   The trail went through several pastures today.  That always makes it interesting.  Apparently it’s still private land but the AT Conservancy or the US Forest Service has an easement to let us pass through.

Today was the first day I hiked more than 20 miles. 20.04, so just barely over 20, but with a full backpack!  


I started from the shelter around the time the others started so we ended up at Lick Creek around the same time. The bridge at Lick Creek is out so we had to ford the creek.  It was not dangerous but more of an annoyance. We had to change out of our hiking shoes and boots and everyone that had them put on their camp shoes. I have a pair of Xero shoes as my camp shoes. Only one guy, Gandalf, didn’t have camp shoes so he wore his waterproof socks. It wasn’t cold or slippery and was quite refreshing.  I got a video of Squirrel crossing the creek in her crocs. 


There was a lot of elevation gain today. 4,810 in elevation gain. Just as I was getting to the top of the highest climb I saw Trimpi walking towards me. He left earlier than everyone else so he was ahead of me. He asked me how I had gotten ahead of him and why was I hiking south?  As soon as he said it he realized he had gotten turned around and was the one hiking south. His reaction was hilarious and we both had a good laugh and then he took off mad at himself for getting turned around at the shelter at the top of the climb. It is very easy to get on the wrong trail at a shelter because there are typically many trails going to water, a privy, tent sites and the AT. 


Very tough ridge walk near the end. It was very rocky on the ridge line and I had to go very slowly. Someone put up a gnome village on the trail. I got a picture. 


Stayed in my tent at Jenkins Shelter. At least six other tents. No one stayed in the shelter. It was a very clear night and the moonlight was so bright i could see inside my tent without a headlamp.","Knot Mall shelter

Stayed at the Weary Feet Hostel. Run by a very nice lady, Julie.  Met her husband too. One other hiker there, Dale. He is afraid he has developed plantar fasciitis. We talked a lot a about foot problems. 


I was the only one in the house. It was built in 1907 and I think it has no insulation and was quite noisy in the wind. Julie and her husband live in a house next door and Dale was staying in the bunk house.  


An employee, Robert, cooked breakfast for us. He is a super nice guy and is a farrier. He explained that a farrier is a specialist in equine hoof care, including the trimming and balancing of horses' hooves and the placing of shoes on their hooves, if necessary.

Hard day today.  16.25 miles with 3,232 feet of elevation gain. The reason I think it was hard is that I didn’t sleep well the night before. I had dinner at the Weary Feet Hostel and they had iced tea. I haven’t had tea or coffee for a long time so I think the caffeine in even a little bit of tea kept me awake. No more tea before bed!


Took a blue blaze side trail to Dismal Falls. Looks like a cool place to hang out in warm weather but not sure it was worth the 0.6 mile round trip. 


Got a really nice view of the Wilburn Valley. Did a video and some panoramic pictures as well. 


Also went through a number of rhododendron tunnels. I took pictures but the pictures always show it lighter than it is In real life. 


Last two miles were brutal. Just lots of rocks. It is just very slow going in long stretches of big rocks. Had to do some scrambling today too.  People said the first mile out tomorrow going north will be more of the same but then the trail improves.  


At Woods Hole Hostel, one of the oldest and best known hostels on the AT. Saw a number of familiar faces. Ruby, Gary and Justin. Met a couple of section hikers from North Carolina, but they are leaving tomorrow.

Arrived late for dinner but they saved me some. It was delicious!  It was a vegetable stew with rice and a salad. Lots of dogs everywhere. 


Met a hiker named Red Deer. He was a unique character. Said he bought a house in West  Virginia for $7,000.  He said he has hiked the section he was on today three times in the past. He is not a section or thru-hiker as far as I could tell. He is hiking with his dog.","Weary Feet Hostel

Had an interesting breakfast at Woods Hole Hostel this morning, Easter morning. There were about 12 of us. We assembled in the breakfast room and then went around the room and introduced ourselves and mentioned one thing we are grateful for. After breakfast you were asked to take your plates to the sink, brush them off with a brush in a tub of soapy water and put them in the dishwasher. Neville, the owner and granddaughter of the original founders of the hostel, explained that there are laws about serving food to guests and she does not have a restaurant license. The health inspector told her communal meals (hence the introductions) were exempt if the people that ate the meal participated in the preparation or cleaning up of the meal. Since we cleaned up, and a number of the guests helped in the preparation, we met this exemption. She told us a lot about running the hostel. When it was founded in the 1980’s they had outhouses. Virginia passed a law against “gray water” which soaks into the ground and eventually makes its way the water table. Gray water includes water from outhouses.  So she had to install a septic system but had no money, so she did a crowd sourcing effort to raise the $15,000. She was successful.  It was an interesting place - bare bones - but I am glad I stayed there.  Very nice people.  


Hiked 13.04 miles today.  Over 2,600 feet in elevation gain. Very rocky again and slow going. I was tired by the time I got to the Plaza Motel in Pearisburg.  It was cold at the beginning but warmed up to be a beautiful day. Saw some deer and lots of wildflowers blooming. 


Had dinner with Justin, Lucky and Gary. We got to the only restaurant that was open at 6:50 and they closed at 7:00. At first they said we couldn’t order food. Gary and Justin wanted a drink so they asked if we could go to the bar. The guy said yes. They ordered drinks. I got a water. Gary asked the bartender if we could order food and he said yes. So we ate at the bar and didn’t leave until 8:00. There were some locals sitting at the bar too.","Woods Hole Hostel

12.43 miles. Hot today. Really had to manage our water closely. Today we climbed McAfee Knob. Was not super crowded. I got there around mid morning and got some amazing pictures and videos.  It is one of the iconic views on the AT and is supposedly the most photographed spot. We also went past Tinker cliffs. They are cliffs on the other side of the valley from McAfee Knob and have similar spectacular views. 


On the hike between McAfee Knob I passed a hiker going southbound who was hiking with a goat. The hiker’s name was Feathers and her goat’s name was Little Leaf. Feathers said Little Leaf was a rescue animal and is a Pigmy goat, but is a runt. She said she was a smaller by 20 pounds than other goats her age.  They were hiking to Damascus for Trail Days. Feathers said Little Leaf can’t do a lot of miles, so they would have to “yellow blaze”, which is hiker talk for going by car on the road. 


When Rhino left the trail I met two women, Tracey and Kelly, who were doing the Virginia Triple Crown for a 3 day weekend.  They stayed at Johns Springs Shelter.  They gave me a ride to the Super 8 at Daleville at the end of the day.  I got a picture of them.","Johns Springs Shelter

Near the end of today’s hike, the trail followed the Blue Ridge Parkway, often abbreviated as BRP. It ran along side it for several miles and crossed it several times. The views were amazing. You can see way down in the valley and it seemed like it went on forever. 
I had to go further than I wanted too because parts of the BRP were closed to automobiles because the National Park Service was doing a prescribed burn along the road. The burn area was not near the AT. 
Passed a sign that said 1/3 to Kathaden. Not sure it is still in the correct location but I am now definitely passed 1/3 done with the AT.

The first bear was running away from me up a hill and was over the hill before I could get a picture. He was small to medium.  I don’t think it was a cub but it looked like it was maybe a year old. It wasn’t tiny but not big either. 
The second bear was bigger and on the other side of the trail. While the second one was bigger, I am not sure it was full grown either. 
I saw the first one for maybe 3-4 seconds and the second one for maybe 5 seconds.  It ran along side the trail and then went down the hill and into the underbrush and I lost sight of it. Was unable to get a picture of either one but very excited to see them. Amazed at how quiet they were. Sometimes I am hiking and I hear sounds like some huge animal is ahead and when I get there it’s only a bird or chipmunk vigorously churning the leaves.  Both bears made hardly any noise at all. 
Was foggy in the morning and I had some nice forest views. Passed the remains of what was called the Brown Mountain Community. Freed slaves lived there in the early 1900’s. Now all you can see are a few foundations, a partial stone fence and a few cairns.

I stopped at the Priest Shelter and had just told a fellow thru hiker that everything had stopped hurting.  My IT band, my knees, everything!  After that descent the front of my knees hurt. 
At the Priest Shelter I met a hiker with the trail names Lazarus. He lived for 20 years in Pittsburgh and was a trauma MD in the emergency room.  He said he had been hiking the AT for 30 years but never thru hiked. Both he and his wife quit their jobs, sold their house, then bought an Airstream and spent 6 months touring the western US and then he was taking 6 months to hike the AT. He said they owned property in Asheville, NC and were building  a home there. 
He pointed out that the Log book at Priest Shelter was very special. Most log books are pretty mundane. Because this was the Priest Shelter (named after Priest Mountain) every entry starts out “Bless me Father for I have sinned . . . “ and then people confess sins they have committed on the trail. Most are scatological in nature like “I have failed to dig my cat hole 6 inches deep“, but others are otherwise entertaining. One talked about not wanting to talk for 5 minutes with every day hiker that wanted to know about thru hiking (I need to get to Maine!) to evaluating every hikers outfit and whether they were fashionable. It was pretty cool. 
Got picked up by a shuttle driver named Homer (he’s 80!) and dropped off at a Holiday Inn Express in Salem, VA. Pick up rental car tomorrow at 9:00. They have Uber in Salem. Then drive to OH through southern Virginia and West Virginia. Apple Maps says 6 hour drive. 
Homer and his wife and two youngest children (a boy and girl) thru hiked the AT as a family in 2002. They wrote a 3rd grade book about the children’s experience. The book publisher interviewed the children about their experience and then produced a book to be read by third grade students (their age at the time).  Again, pretty cool.  I was shuttled on different rides by Homer, his daughter and his oldest son.  They all very nice people and I am happy I had the chance to meet them.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

Made it to Virginia and dropped off the rental car. That was another story. Hertz closed the drop off location (it was at a airport for private planes and jets) but didn’t take it out of their directory or prohibit you from booking it as a drop off location. The lady I finally ended up talking with said they have notified the “higher ups” several times and have asked them to remove that location but nothing ever happens. Finally was able to leave the car at Freedom Aviation and they sent someone to pick it up. My shuttle driver was not happy. It made him late for his next shuttle. 


Got dropped off where I left off earlier in May and hiked 2.87 miles to the Harper’s Creek shelter. The creek is very nice. Lots of flowing water and babbling brook noises. I am going to set my tent up, make some dinner, filter some water and try to go to sleep early.  Hung my bear bag in a tree.

I met a couple from Solon, OH. Both graduated Kent State in 2016. He is “Flash” (for the Golden Flashes) and she is Pink (because she has pink hair). 


I met an interesting person hiking the trail today. His trail name is Naturist Dave.  I’ll try to post his picture which will explain everything. He said he is “pushing 80”.


I actually talked to Dave for quite a while. He was an “engrosser”. He said I bet you don’t what an engrosser does. I didn’t. He said he designs certificates, like stock certificates or graduation certificates. He said he ran his own business in Washington, DC for over 40 years.  I asked him all the regular questions- what about bugs etc. he answered them all and said don’t knock it til you have tried it.

Yellowjacket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652307,"Calf Mountain Shelter to Sawmill Run Overlook 


Well. I learned a valuable lesson last night about tenting in National Parks and about backpacking in general. In Shenandoah National Park if you stay by a shelter and want to sleep in your tent (or have to because the shelter is full), you have to pitch your tent on one of the tent pads. Generally, these are nice squares where Park Service employees have removed all the grass, leaves, stones, brambles and whatever else would be growing there and then leveled it off so you have a nice flat clean surface on which to pitch your tent. They then put boards on 3 or 4 sides to separate the space from the rest of the shelter area. 


Last night by the time I arrived at the shelter it was full. The people already in the shelter said they would shove over and I could squeeze in but then everyone would have been uncomfortable so I decided to sleep in my tent. There was a guy in a hammock and another person in a tent further away from me. 


Well, it rained all night, not a hard rain but a steady rain, and because of the boards around the tent pad, the water could not flow down hill and it backed up and flooded my tent. The uphill side of the tent pad had no board so the water flowed right down hill.  Because of the boards on the remaining 3 sides the water was essentially funneled to my tent and the board on the downhill side acted as a dam. I woke up about 4:15 AM and put my hand on the tent floor off of my sleeping pad and discovered about a half inch of water. 


Everything got soaked and was very dirty from muddy water. I had some clothes in a trash compactor bag, but they were mainly socks and a hat. My sleeping clothes were basically dry because I was on the sleeping pad but the bottom of my sleeping bag was hanging over the end of the pad and the bottom third was pretty wet. It’s a light down sleeping bag so I knew wet down was not a good thing. I had stretched out the clothes I had the previous day - essentially my one set of hiking clothes - over top of my pack but they were completely soaked. My tent was covered in mud. 


So at 6 AM I started texting shuttle drivers to see if anyone could help me. On the third try I found someone and got picked up around 9:45 after hiking only 2.78 miles and dropped back off at the Holiday Inn in Waynesboro.  I did two loads of laundry and took everything else into the shower with me so I could clean it up. I then put everything up in my hotel room and dried everything off and I am ready to go back to the trail tomorrow.  I put my sleeping bag in the dryer on low after wiping it down and it turned out better than I thought it might. I am getting picked up tomorrow morning between 7 and 8. 


I got some pictures of my tent after everything was removed and of the tent pad. By the time I took the tent pictures the rain had slowed and it doesn’t look as deep as it was earlier. 


I also got some pictures of the flowers blooming along the trail. Even though it is raining it still beautiful on the trail. 


I have slept on these tent pads before and never had a problem. The first time it even rained but it was very light. On Saturday night I stealth camped and there was a big thunderstorm but the water never accumulated, so no problem.  I understand why they have the pads. By forcing everyone to tent in prearranged spots they limit the environmental impact of people tenting all over the place. 


I think I will try to stealth camp when I can. Stealth camping is permitted in Shenandoah National Park but they have conditions about how far you have to be from a water source and 3-4 other requirements, all of which make sense and, in general, are easy to follow.","Calf Mountain Shelter

I saw three groups of Rangers and park service employees along the trail. There were 11 people in total.   One male. Ten females.  The first group of 3 was going through an orientation and were learning about the different trees in the park. The second group of 4 were pulling garlic mustard plants by hand. The team leader explained to me that it is an invasive species that crowds out plants that butterflies like and need. She said the garlic mustard plants came from Europe long ago to be used as an herb in cooking and it got out of hand.

The trails in Shenandoah National Park are some of the best trails I have seen anywhere on the AT. Very few rocky spots. They badly need trimmed back though.  Grass and weeds and other vegetation is overtaking the trail in some spots. 


Went to my first camp store in the park. I was pleasantly surprised at how well stocked it was.  Met a guy from the UK named Guru G. He started asking me questions about my poncho.  Very nice guy from around London.  An older lady was getting off the trail.  She hurt her Achilles’ tendon and tried to hike through it and made it worse.  Her brother was with her and they were heading to Waynesboro and then she was going home to Florida. 


Ate lunch with a guy whose trail name is Blue, because he looks like Blue from Old School.  I had to shout “my boy Blue” and he said that’s the one. I’ll try and post his picture.

Short day today. Hiked 6.51 miles with 2,383 of descent.  Only 600+ feet of ascent. Just had to make it to VA 522 and then get a ride to my hotel. 


When we got up this morning there were several deer eating and hanging around the campsite. They definitely were not afraid of us.  One in particular got very close and hung around for a long time. I got pictures.  


When I was getting near the end of the days hike I came across miles of chain link fence running alongside the trail. I wondered if it was a CIA property because it is northern Virginia. The cab driver said the property is owned by the Smithsonian and is used to breed and raise rare or endangered animals. She said she knew they were trying to breed pandas but wasn’t sure what else. It ran along the road to town for miles as well. 


Had a real problem with getting a ride from the trailhead to my hotel. Contacted 4 shuttle drivers. All were completely booked. Called Front Royal Taxi. The earliest they could pick me up was after 5 PM. Finally, I called Yellow Cab. The lady said they could pick me up around noon but she could not guarantee anything. I got to the trailhead a little before noon and tried to call them but I had a really poor connection and, when it did go through, it kept going to their voicemail. A car drove up and two elderly women dropped off a hiker who was a grandson of one of the women. I asked them if they were going towards Walmart, the direction of my hotel. They said they were not familiar with the area but they would give me a ride. So I loaded my stuff in their trunk and just as we started to leave, the taxi pulled up. I said I would go with the taxi since I called it. The driver could not get the trunk open. She said it was a new car and she didn’t know how to operate everything yet. Fortunately, her grandson came back down the trail and unlocked all the doors and then the trunk opened. 


Had a chance to shower, do laundry, and walk to Walmart and Aldi to resupply. It feels different than when I zeroed before leaving the trail for Texas. When I zeroed then, my legs, my feet, everything just hurt and really needed the rest. I don’t have the growing pains anymore (knock on wood) and hopefully they are gone.Saw some sad news that a thru hiker fell off the cliffs near McAfee Knob and died.

Hiked 10.02 miles. Felt a little better today. 



The trail today was better than it has been the last few days although there were sections that were very steep and required hand over hand climbing. The section once I entered Harpers Ferry National Historic Park was very nice. You could see where the park service removed the rocks from the trail and piled them alongside the trail to make a rock wall. This part of the trail was nice compacted earth. As I got closer to the Shenandoah River the trail became much steeper and very rocky and where the hand over hand climbing was. We basically had to climb down to the river, cross the river on a bridge and then go up the other side.I crossed into West Virginia but was still not done with Virginia. The trail continued to go through both states. I think I was finally done with Virginia when I crossed the Shenandoah River. That took forever!  Got pictures crossing the river. 


I hiked the last section into Harpers Ferry with three people I met at the shelter the night before. They were Sonnyside (his real first name is Sonny), Buoy Critter (he was a retired Navy guy whose job it was to maintain sonar buoys) and Mother Hen, a lady from outside Atlanta. I had planned to get off the trail at the Quality Inn, since that is where we all were staying. They wanted to hike to the end of Harpers Ferry. So I went along with them. We passed some sights in the Park, including Jefferson Rock, as well as remains of buildings from the 1800s. Jefferson Rock apparently is a rock Thomas Jefferson sat on to observe the Shenandoah River. There are a number of restored and reconstructed buildings dating from the time when John Brown launched his attack on the US armory at Harper’s Ferry.  We saw Neil Harper’s house, for whom Harpers Ferry is named. 


We went to the local outfitter because Mother Hen had packages mailed there. She could not locate them. It gave me a chance to check out the place and it was very small with a very limited selection. We had lunch at a place called the Rabbit Hole. I had a salad. We then walked to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters to get our pictures taken. It is a tradition for thru hikers to get their picture taken here and put in a book for the year (2022 in our case). We all got our pictures taken and put in the book for posterity.  I got pictures of the pictures.

I was really slow and physically felt ill and exhausted. I dragged myself into Harpers Ferry thinking I’d bounce back after a couple days of rest. 


I decided to take a double zero (2 days of no hiking) because I had a lot of gear replacements I needed to take care of. The heel fell off my right shoe, so I needed a new pair of shoes. My sleeping pad got a hole in it and I couldn’t find the tiny hole to patch it. One of my tent poles broke and my Leatherman multi tool broke.  There were no local stores where I could walk to and take care of these things so I rented a car and drove to an REI in Rockville, MD. I was able to take care of everything there except the knife. 


My plan was to get back on the trail on Thursday. I started to feel better but my cold symptoms were worse, so I extended my hotel for another day. On Thursday morning, I had trouble catching my breath and was coughing up pink phlegm. I knew that wasn’t good. I called around and ended up at an urgent care facility run by West Virginia University and got tested for Covid.  The result came back positive. That explained a lot about why I was feeling so badly physically.  I was able to get treatment that afternoon. I received a Monoclonal Antibody infusion intravenously. The infusion itself took about one minute and then I had to wait for an hour to be sure I didn’t have any adverse side effects. They told me to rest for 3-5 days or until I felt better. So, I am still at the Quality Inn for another day or two or three. I am feeling much better but I want to be sure I am healthy before I get back on the trail. 


In addition to dealing with the medical issues, I had to rent a car to get around. I rented a car from Enterprise for one day to go to REI. I tried to extend it but they said they were selling the car that afternoon and I had to return it. They had no other cars available. So I had to find another rental car and I had to go to Martinsburg, WV to pick it up. I ended up renting from Hertz. 


Right now I have my hotel room and rental car through Monday morning. If I am feeling up to it I’ll try to get back on the trail on Sunday.","Harpers Ferry.

Got a video after I crossed the Potomac where the Shenandoah and Potomac join.  Lots of water still in what was the C&O Canal. Saw lots of turtles with green flotsam all over them. Got some pictures.

I was hiking up the hill to Pine Knob Shelter and I was stopped by a hiker coming down the hill. It was a lady I hiked with for a few hours near MacAfee Knob.

Hiked 19.1 miles. Feel good now that I am done. About mile 16 I was wishing I was done for the day. Back at Days Inn. I plan to slack pack tomorrow. Hopefully do another 19-20 miles. There were spots today where it was very rocky and I stretched my left hamstring twice taking big steps over big rocks. It was ok but if it acts up I might cut it short. Over 3,600 of elevation gain. Finished Maryland and officially crossed the Mason Dixon line into Pennsylvania. Six states down, eight to go. 


I got a picture of the Mason Dixon line sign. Apparently, they had to put a new one up because someone stole the old one.  I don’t know why there is a mailbox next to the sign. It is filled with letters and someone put a sticker on the mailbox that says “Always be kind”.  That got me. 


Had trail magic around mile 13. Three guys were grilling hot dogs and had drinks and a bunch of Hostess cupcakes snacks. They also had Mountain Dew and Pepsi but I drank their last 2 Gatorades. They said it was ok. Most people preferred the sodas. 


It was very different vibe at this trail magic. It felt like a big city vibe. The guy grilling was from New Jersey and I think the other two guys were too. There was a couple about my age from Connecticut. The guy fromConnecticut said to the griller “Do I detect a Pennsylvania accent?”  The griller said “No. I’m a Jersey boy.”  The wife from Connecticut said “That’s not a Pennsylvania accent.”  Everyone was very nice but it just felt different than trail magic in North Carolina, for example. Oh well. Maybe it was just me.

Hiked 17.5 miles. Today was a perfect hiking day from a weather perspective. It was 70 degrees, sunny with a light breeze. The trail was in great shape too, other than some rocky areas at the beginning. 




The trail was fairly busy with trail runners in the morning. Saw 10 or so.The trail goes through the town of Boiling Springs, Pa. I had to cross a bridge to get into town and there were several people, including a husband and wife team, that were fly fishing for trout. I asked if there were trout and the lady said oh, yes. She seemed like a very serious fisher person. 




The Appalachian Trail Conservancy had a regional headquarters in the town at one point but the building is owned by the city now. We still had access to the water faucet at the back of the building but otherwise it was empty and locked up. There were a number of thru hikers at the picnic table in front and I ate lunch with them.
The trail went through a geographic area called the Cumberland Valley Crossing. It’s a stretch of more than 14 miles that goes through private land and the ATC has an easement to allow hikers to hike through. There is no camping allowed and no water sources. There are several creek crossings but FarOut says the water is not safe to drink because of the runoff from all the farms that drain into the creeks. So in general, you have to carry enough water for 14 miles and don’t stop to camp until you are through the area.However, it is not as dire as it sounds.  I bet I crossed 15 roads.  If you got stuck you can call an Uber to take you to get whatever you want. Also, because today was Saturday, there were at least two Trail Magic locations set up at some of the road crossings with bigger parking lots. 


My shuttle driver is from Dubai and his name is Mezhar. He and I have been talking about everything and I told him about the one time I went to Dubai and how good the food was. He said he doesn’t miss much about Dubai but he misses the food. Then he wanted his wife to cook some Middle Eastern food for me. I tried to say that’s ok and I didn’t want to bother her but he insisted. So tonight he brought me lentils and rice, fried fish and chicken and a bowl of cold mixed vegetables. It was all very tasty but very different too. 


Saw several deer. One just stared at me while I took her picture.","Whiskey Springs Road

Hiked 15.8 miles. A little over 2,500 of elevation gain.  First day of really hitting the rocks of Pennsylvania. Either I have gotten better or the worst is yet to come but all in all, today wasn’t that bad. 


Today’s hike ended with a road walk through the town of Duncannon, PA. I am staying at a Quality Inn in Enola, PA, at the recommendation of a shuttle driver and I am glad I am here. Enola is nothing great, but Duncannon seems to have seen better days. It was pretty run down. I walked about 2.5 miles from one end of town to the other. I knew things were off to a bad start as soon as the trail left the woods and entered town. I was immediately approached by a very large man who was obviously drunk and carrying a can of beer. He asked me if I wanted to stay at the Assembly of God church. They let people sleep for free in their basement and that was where he was staying.  He said he was hiking southbound and that he started at the trail head just north of Duncannon.  Anyway he was looking for a hostel so I showed him where it was in FarOut and we walked past it and he went in. 


I crossed over the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers on very long bridges today. It was a beautiful view looking over the rivers. However, it was hard to ignore the four lanes of traffic buzzing by while I crossed. The bridges span over a mile and I was the only person walking on them. 


Had a few views. One from a place called Hawk Rock. It is not far from town and there were quite a few day hikers on the trail.","Sherwood Drive

Hiked 16.82 miles. Very hard day. Today I got an introduction to the rocks of Pennsylvania. The scary parts are when I have climb. The hardest part is climbing down. I might be on one big rock and there is a 4 foot drop to the rock below.  Sometimes I try to go down backwards if I can get a handhold. Otherwise, I sit on the edge and slide over. Another problem is that there are spaces between the rocks and sometimes I put my trekking pole down and it keeps on going, throwing me off balance. I know two guys that snapped their poles that way. It’s just very slow going. 


I am doing better with the rocks on the trail. Sometimes they are big and you can jump rock to rock like you do when you cross a stream. Other times you need to pick your way through a bunch of rocks standing on end. It’s just one more challenge. 


I will give an update on the guy I saw yesterday on the street in Duncannon.  Today I stopped at a shelter for a morning snack and to camel up on water. There was a guy there, Guam, who I met before. There is a whole side story about him but I am glad he is still on the trail. Anyway, he stayed at the Assembly of God church last night and he said the guy was there. I described him and I am pretty sure it had to be the same guy. I told Guam I thought he was drunk when I saw him. He said that was what he initially thought but changed his mind to mental problems. He said there were 15 people planning to sleep at the church. People were in the basement getting ready for bed. The guy comes in with a duffel bag and dumps it in the middle of the floor. Guam said everyone backed off. Then the guy put everything back in the duffel and set up a tent in the yard. He said everyone went to sleep and the guy came back in basement about 10:30 PM and turned on the lights, which woke everyone up, and started eating. Guam said he just stared at the ceiling while eating. He finished and left. Guam said he came back about 1 AM with a headlamp and started eating again.  He said when he got up the guy and his tent and everything was gone. He packed up in the middle of the night.

Nothing too spectacular today. Saw a bunch of familiar hikers. Spyder, Keto, Willow. Also saw an army guy hiking with his pack. I am very close to Fort Indiantown Gap, PA and he must from there. 


FarOut had several warnings about a beaver dam that was causing Stoney Creek to flood for a mile. I read the comments and most people said they had no problem, so I stayed on the AT and didn’t take the bypass trail. It was kind of a letdown, but I could see it being a problem after heavy rain. Anyway, you have walk across the dam. It’s a bunch of trees piled up to make the dam, so they are unstable but if you have trekking poles you can balance and walk across. I took a short video. 





There were two places where people said porcupines were bothering tenters at night. I didn’t see any porcupines so that was a let down too.There was a old settlement called Yellow Springs, PA and it has a yellow spring, like the yellow spring in Glen Helen Nature Preserve near Yellow Springs, OH.","Clark's Valley Road (PA 325)

Tomorrow will be harder. There is a climb out of Palmerton that is all hand over hand climbing.  Here is one comment in FarOut:
*****
Not a climber. I was terrified half the time, petrified half the time, and calling for my mommy half the time.  In retrospect, I'd have taken the winter bypass. I know, I know, the Whites are coming, but still. . . .
Great panoramic views of the valley.  But given the climb to get to it, if I had it to do over, I'd have taken the winter. trail bypass (off the trail to Palmerton).  And I don't even want to think about going DOWN.

I had to resupply today. I was going to yesterday but I had to get a shuttle so I waited until the next town, where I could walk 1.8 miles into town. So I decided to stay at a hostel. It’s called Bert’s Steak House. It is mainly a restaurant but they have a bunk house in the back.  There are two people here - from Waynesville, OH!  The guys trail name is Brambles. His girlfriend’s trail name is Madame Morrel, because she is getting her PhD in Mycology from Ohio State. They are both very nice. Anyway, they were here 2 days ago but had to come back because he is not feeling well and is being treated for Lyme disease. Tested negative for Covid.  They climbed the above mentioned mountain and said it was “fun”.  I plan to climb the mountain and not take the bypass. I’ll let you know how it goes.  


When I called Bert’s they said Tracey will pick you up for free if she is available. Well. She wasn’t available.  She told me to hike up the hill and hitchhike by the stop light. After about 5 minutes a car pulled over. I hustled down to it and there two Hispanic guys in it covered in tattoos. The guy in the passenger seat had a black balaclava on.   He didn’t speak English. The driver was super nice and shouts out “Hey Bro, where you going?”  I tell him and he said they are going past Palmerton but he would drop me off at the exit. He said I am in a wheelchair so you have to get in behind me (the driver) because my wheelchair is in the seat behind the passenger. Then the driver hops out and opens the door for me. I could tell he needed the wheelchair but could stand if he was holding on to something. He said it was a used cop car and that there was a trick to opening the back doors. Anyway he said he is an artist and a musician and he rides bikes. I didn’t get the chance to ask if he rode hand cycles. They dropped me at the Palmerton exit and I walked the remaining 0.7 miles to Bert’s. Alls well that ends well. I learned another lesson about having an open mind about all people.","Campsite at mile 1248.7

Made it to the top of the climb out of Palmerton. I would agree with Brambles and Madame Morrel that the climb was more fun than frightening. In fact there was not one point where I was worried I wouldn’t make it across. It was very slow going and lots of hand over hand climbing but nothing scary. 


I know everyone is different and everyone has their own challenges to overcome.  When I was over the climb I met a local hiker out for the afternoon. She asked me what I thought about the climb up. I told her I thought it was fine and enjoyed the scramble. She told me the first time she climbed it she had a terrible case of vertigo.  She made it up but it wasn’t fun. She said she has since climbed it several more times and had no more problems with vertigo. 



The biggest issue I had was what to with my trekking poles. Eventually I folded them up and put them in my pack and scrambled along like a spider. Another issue is that it is hot and sunny and you are exposed on the rock. My sun shirt worked fine. Another issue is that this is a Superfund clean up site. It started in 2011 and all of the vegetation must have been removed. When you get to the top there are only short trees and there is no drinking water for the next 20 miles.At a campsite at mile 1270.8. It is at the junction of a blue blaze trail that leads to Delps spring about 0.4 of a mile off the AT (although the sign at the trail junction says the spring is 0.6 away, or 1.2 miles round trip). I wanted to stay here because it is one of the few off trail places to get water for another 10 miles. It was very hot today and I went through all the water I brought. No one else here right now. It is a very large campsite so I wouldn’t be surprised if others arrive soon. 


It was a hard day. After the climb, which was the most enjoyable part, came the steady up and down through the rocky trail.  Had another scramble up Blue Mountain, but it was short compared to this morning. Hiked 9.58 miles with 3,455 of elevation gain. 


Only 27 miles and I am done with PA. Someone said it continues into NJ for 30-40 miles and finally goes through some farms with less rocks. 


Supposed to have thunderstorms Friday and Saturday. I may have to come up with a plan or just get wet. 



The bugs were horrible today. I have been wearing my bug net over my hat and it works amazingly well.Brambles was still feeling ill so they were staying at Bert’s for at least another day. When it’s not crowded it’s not bad. It’s $30 per night, and that includes shower and laundry. It is right in the center of town so easy to walk to stores and restaurants. They got donuts from Dunkin’ this morning. I had breakfast at Bert’s. They open at 7 AM and it was packed. I sat at the counter and had a Philly cheesesteak omelette, home cooked potatoes and two coconut pancakes with vanilla sauce. And of course coffee and water. All of that was less than $15. 


Tracy did drop me off at the trailhead. I guess it’s no longer free and she charged me $6, which was worth it. She had a convertible Mini Cooper and had the top down. It was a beautiful morning, even if the ride was only 1.8 miles.","Palmerton

I don’t usually watch YouTube but I wanted to see what he said about Wolf Rocks and the descent into Delaware Water Gap. This is part of the section I hiked today and will hike tomorrow. You don’t have to watch the whole thing but at the end he summarizes PA and I think he does a good job. During the video he shows the trail and explains why it is so hard. I think today was one of my worst days of hiking I have had. The trail is just awful. Lots of people have posted very negative comments about the trail in FarOut. 


Hiked 11.58 miles today and my feet and knees and legs all ache. It’s was 100% rocks the entire time. Plus I made two water stops - one in the morning and one at lunch -  that were each about 0.6 to 0.8 miles round trip. The lack of water is a real problem when it is so hot. Oh well. Enough complaining. 


Other than the trail, all good here. It started raining so I went to a hotel about 100 yards off the trail. It is called the Gateway Motel.  Looks like it is from the 40’s.

I made it to Delaware Water Gap.  Hiked 15.55 miles.  All I have to do to finish PA is cross the Delaware River into New Jersey. Had two stretches today, one about a mile long and the other about 1.5 miles long, without loads of ankle twisting rocks. Still rocky but at an acceptable level.  Went through Wolf Rocks, which was another long scramble and must have been deemed difficult enough that they have a blue blaze bypass if you wanted to take it. It was fine and I enjoyed the scramble.  This was both up and down. Going down is much harder with a full pack on. There were some views but a lot were blocked by trees. 



The descent into Delaware Water Gap was hard. I thought since there would be a lot of visitors to DWG hiking up to the views the trail might be rock free. There are numerous rock free trails leading to the top from different parking lots but the AT has its own trail which only crosses over the nicer paths. It was rocky as ever.I am staying at the Presbyterian Church of the Mountain Hiker. This is the oldest hostel on the AT. It’s a long story. I have a room at the Clarion for Sunday and Monday night.  I called them last night to extend it to today but wasn’t sure I would make it, mainly because we were supposed to have thunderstorms today. The guy said they had 10 rooms left and to call back when I was sure I would make it. I called about 11 and the lady said they were sold out for tonight. So here I am at the church.  I got the last bunk!  It’s a full house.  Out of food. Getting a shower and then walking to the Bakery with a guy named Governor.  I’ll tell his story later. Nice guy. Probably a little younger than me. 


No air conditioning and they have fans that are very old and noisy and don’t really seem to move the air. Since I got the last bunk I am on the top with a big black pipe about 6 inches above my sleeping bag at my feet.  No mattress or sheets here. Have to use your sleeping pad and bag. It is so hot I am just laying on my pad but I pulled my sleeping bag out in case it cools off overnight. My bag fell on the floor and there was no way I could get it without waking everyone up. It never cooled off so I didn’t need it. The lady below me is from Hamburg, Germany. Her trail name is Hamburg. She picked it about 6 AM and handed it to me when she got up to go to. . . Well. You know where. There is a guy from Hamburg here too and they had never met until they both got to the church. There is a guy here from Düsseldorf whose trail name is Opa (means grandfather, I think) whom I have talked with before. All of them were very nice.  3 of 8 people were German. 



This is the same church the guy in the video I pasted yesterday stayed at.I am giving my feet, knees and legs two days of rest. My left knee has been swelling up late in the day but it is ok by morning and once I get it limbered up it works fine. It’s not super painful during the day but is very sensitive at night when I try to sleep. I am hoping it goes back to normal after I leave the rocks for good.","PA 33

That took a while and I wasn’t able to start hiking until about 10:30. 


A lady I passed on the trail said she saw two bears this morning.  I heard that NJ is the state where you are most likely to see bears.  Apparently they have adjusted to being around people and don’t cause problems so they coexist here. Kind of like big raccoons.  Hopefully I’ll see some tomorrow.  Saw a couple of snakes but they were in underbrush and moving away from me and I didn’t get a good look or pictures.  Supposed to be a lot of rattlesnakes in this area. Since it was raining they were not out sunning themselves on some of the rocks where other people have seen them. 


At the Mohican Outdoor Center at mile 1307.5. It is a shelter on the trail run by the Appalachian Mountain Club. It started raining around 1:00 PM and is supposed to thunderstorm tonight so I wanted a place to stay dry and this is right on the trail.

Had two sessions of trail magic today. The first was by a guy named Moose. He had the most opulent spread I have seen yet. He had three folding tables set up with all kinds of goodies, including a great selection of fresh fruit, which I took advantage of. He had a cooler full of sandwiches and two other coolers with pop and Powerade. He had Girl Scout cookies, every kind of pop tart imaginable and nuts and M&Ms and more. 



The second spread was also awesome. There were two ladies and a man. I couldn’t figure out how they got there. One of the ladies lived in Indianapolis and had Indiana plates on her car. The other lady lived in Illinois, just across the border from Terre Haute. She seemed to be with the guy. The guy was from the state of Washington and had Washington plates on his truck. Why they were doing trail magic in NJ was never made clear. They had fried chicken, potato and macaroni salad, fresh baked cookies (a huge bag of them) and drinks and snickers bars and more. Had some good views from Sunshine Mountain and views of Culver Lake. The trail is very busy right now. I bet I saw 15 new thru hikers today. Most are young people in their mid 20s doing high mileage.  At least 4 older thru hikers too. I think this is the bubble, or what is left of it. 


Water is a hassle. A lot of the streams are dried up or stagnant and unappealing. 


At the Rutherford Shelter tonight. 2 other tenters here so far. I am in my tent. There is a stream here for water, and it is barely flowing. I had to scoop water out from pools.  There are rabbits here that are not afraid of humans.

What a hike!  I read the map wrong and what I thought was a 20 mile hike ended up being 22.21 miles, my longest day yet.  Over 8,000 feet of elevation gain.  From miles 16 to 20 it was nothing but scrambles and ridge walks. I thought thank goodness I am finally done and I made it before it got dark.  I then realized I had another 2.2 to go and I had to hike it in the dark with my headlamp. Fortunately, these last miles were on a relatively rock free trail. After about a mile, my headlamp picked up two green eyes up ahead on the trail. I yelled “hey” several times but they didn’t move. When I got to them it was a deer. It moved maybe 10 feet off the trail and stared at me. 


I think the adrenaline kicked in when I realized I had another 2.2 miles to go.  Back at Lake lodge.


At the beginning I hiked through wetlands on a wooden walkway for 0.9 miles. It was called the Pochuck Boardwalk. It was very nice. Much nicer than the boardwalk through the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. 


Saw four bears today. The first was a large bear by itself. It was just wandering along, looking for something to eat. I got a picture and a video but it’s pretty far away in trees. 


About half a mile further on I saw a mother bear and two cubs. I was about 50-60 feet away, which I thought was plenty of space.  I took some pictures and then started to take a video and the mother bear’s concept of personal space was obviously different. She charged at me but then stopped. After she did that charge, there was a cub behind her that started running away from me. There was another cub in a tree right next to her. It came climbing down and let go when it was about 3-4 feet from the ground and took off behind her. They were super cute with shiny black fur. I thought she might back off when her cubs were behind her but she started “chuffing”.  It’s a sound like coughing and clearing your throat. And she kept staring at me and walking towards me. That was not a good sign so I know she wanted me to leave so I did. I walked down the trail away from her and she turned around and went to her cubs. 


In the video you can hear people yelling in the background. It was a couple behind me. They caught up when I stopped to take pictures and videos. They are locals and had a big dog on a leash. The guy was trying to scare her away. 


My guess is the dog bothered her too. I heard that bears really don’t like dogs. They view them as more of a threat than humans. 


I learned something today. Mother bears are very protective, as they should be, and want a very large safe area for their cubs. I now know to give them more room than I would otherwise expect. 


I did finish New Jersey.  I thought it was a little longer but it’s done. Eight states down, six to go!  Got a picture of the state lines painted on a rock. 


There was another hiker behind me when we saw the bears. I told him I wanted to get pictures for my grandchildren. He passed me and was getting water at a stream and said he caught a leopard frog that they might like to see. He said they are super fast and when he put it down it was gone in two hops. Got the picture.","Liberty Corners Road

Hiked 12.45 miles with over 3,800 feet of elevation gain. The trail was mixed. Started out very rocky. Then as I got close to Bear Mountain they really improved the trail because it gets so much use. It was more crowded than usual. So for 4-5 miles it was very nice. I crossed the Hudson River and thought things would improve after that. Right after the Hudson it was a very hard rocky straight up hill climb. Then it got better.  When I crossed the Hudson I was close to West Point, but I could not see anything that was a part of the military academy. 


I went through a state park that has a zoo that the AT goes through. It’s called the Trail Side Zoo.

She apparently tried to duck under the tree but didn’t go low enough and hit her head and knocked herself out.  I have seen these types of blowdowns before and you really have to duck low.  One I had to crawl under. I asked if there was anything I could do to help and they all thanked me and said they had it under control.

Did a “nero” today, not a zero but a short day. Just 4 miles. 


Tomorrow I’ll hike to the base of Mt Graylock, the highest point in Massachusetts, and then go over the top the next day, which will take me to Vermont and to 1,600 miles.  Very hot and humid today.  Was 88 today and is supposed to be 81 tomorrow.","Grange Hall Road

Very nice day today from a temperature perspective. Warm but not hot and humidity seemed less of an issue. One big climb and a number of smaller climbs. Hiked 8.7 miles with 2,497 of elevation gain. 


Trail went through the town of Cheshire, MA. It’s a quaint little town. It went right past an ice cream stand so I stopped and got a cone around 2:30 in the afternoon, when the heat was building up. It was refreshing.  Had one good view coming down into Cheshire from what is called the Cheshire Cobble, which is simply a ledge overlooking the valley. The wind was blowing quite strongly, which felt good. 


At the 1896 Country Inn in Williamstown, MA.","Gulf Road

Hiked 12.6 miles with 3,356 of elevation gain. Went over Mount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts, at 3,488 feet. There is a war memorial/tower at the top. I climbed to the top. The views were spectacular and you could see 360 degrees but the windows were small and less than clean and clear, so that detracted somewhat from an otherwise excellent experience. The views on the ground were very good, but you couldn’t see 360 degrees because of trees. 




There is also a lodge on the top of Mount Greylock. It was built in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. I am staying there tonight and having dinner there. The trail went past a small pond with a small cabin on its shores. It was very picturesque so I got a picture.Temperature today was pretty good. The average temperature for my hike was 80 degrees, so not as pleasant as it has been but better than the 90s.","Gulf Road
