I was delighted to get down to the business of dehydrating plenty of vegetables, sambhar, ground meat etc. I have quite enjoyed my new dehydrator, and very quickly exhausted the vegetable and fruit stockpile in my fridge. Then bought groceries in bulk & dehydrated them for trail meals. Unless a bear gets my food, I probably won't starve on the trail. I have prepped boxes with food, socks, supplements & toilettries. My friend & neighbor will be mailing these to me upon request. The picture with this entry is one of my rehydrated meals....rice, lentils (sambhar), okra & ground turkey.

Steady,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647463,The temperature last night dropped to 20°F. My fingers soon got numb when I crawled out of my tent in the morning. It was hard taking down the tent with numb fingers. So I got a late start. Started hiking at 10 AM & soon warmed up. I had planned to walk till Gooch Gap but camped 1.5 miles before because I didn't think I could make it before dark. Met a fascinating elderly lady named Stephanie. She seemed to be struggling so I stopped to ask if she was ok. She started at High Tower & made it to Devil's Kitchen. What an inspiring lady!! If she can do it anybody can do it. She said she was going to get a shuttle from Gooch Gap to Mountain Crossings tomorrow because her pack is too heavy. She wants a pack shakedown.,"Stover Creek Shelter

I had some pain on my left foot where the boot top keeps hitting the bone above my ankle. Loosening up my shoe laces & some band-aid helped. Will buy some leukotape when I get to Neels Gap. I am still trying to master the PCT technique to hang food out of reach of bears. It's supposed to rain tonight. I can recharge my phone at Neels Gap tomorrow so I can take my phone out of airplane mode & extravagantly use up the battery. Still have a full power bank. So I'm good.,"Devils Kitchen

The rain made the rocks awfully slippery so it was a difficult day. To make matters worse, I followed a flatlander from Florida. He went the wrong way and got us lost. The views were obscured by clouds but the trail had an ethereal beauty which I enjoyed.Finally I made it to Neels Gap.

The snorers were loud but the complaints were louder. I slept through most of it but there were a lot of grumpy people in the morning. The sun was shining and it was a beautiful hiking day. My knee seems to be mending. I hiked about 30 minutes then stopped for breakfast at a little waterfall. Climbed Blue Mountain today. Lots of big boulders to negotiate. We were rewarded with Trail Magic at Unicoi Gap. Two guys who thru hiked in 2021 were grilling hot dogs. They had fruit, assorted chips & sodas. It tasted so delicious. They gave a lot of advice & information about the trail. They said they had experienced a lot of trail magic last year so they were giving back. 
Some of us stealth camped about a mile after Unicoi Gap. It was a good day.","Low Mountain Shelter

The young people are amazing. They hike so fast & are very sure-footed.Bought a set of hiking poles in Hiawasee which are helping me tremendously on the rocky terrain. Now that I am out of Georgia, I have not seen any bear boxes or bear cables at the shelters. The Georgia trail ambassadors do such a great job!! 
Tomorrow, I climb Mt Albert and hope to get a t- mobile signal at the fire tower. I need to call a hostel & get a reservation at the next trail town Franklin NC.","Standing Indian Shelter

Franklin NC is a very nice hiker friendly trail town.
The Baptist church prepares an awesome pancake breakfast for all hikers. Looking forward to it in the morning.
We are all hitting the Chinese buffet & Lazy Hiker brewery tonight. I was sad to hear that Dingo, a hiker from Australia has dropped out for now. Zen, the hostel owner said it was due to a family emergency.","Betty Creek Gap

We were packed like sardines in his car along with his dog, all our backpacks & hiking poles. I am chalking it all down to the AT experience.It felt like an easy hike today. The sun was shining but there were very strong winds all day. Passed Winding Stair Gap where Mama Goose, a 2013 thru hiker was doing trail magic.

I was warm in 3 layers, 2 pairs of socks, gloves, merino wool buff & a warm beanie, zipped up in my cozy sleeping bag. However, there was no way I was going to crawl out of my tent at night to answer nature's call even if I exploded. Anyways, I survived to walk another day. Summited Wayah Bald today which is marked by a stone observation tower. The 360° view at the top is amazing & worth the climb. Maybe I'll do more miles tomorrow. As I crawled into my tent & settled for the night I checked in with myself....is this enough hiking? Is it time to go home? The answer is NO...not by a long shot. Looking forward to warmer weather & longer daylight hours.","Siler Bald Shelter

He bought a $600 sleeping bag at Neels Gap & was telling everyone about his expensive purchase. Every time he told the story, the price went up so someone named him 100 Grand. They are young & high spirited. Their laughter is infectious.Great views today at Wesser Bald. There is a weird guy walking around with a spear on the trail. He is upsetting some hikers. I think he is just eccentric but not dangerous. He said he was interested in ancient weaponry.","Wayah Bald Shelter

The views were spectacular in this particular part of the trail. After about five miles I emerged from the woods into the busy & bustling NOC. Was greeted with a chorus of 'Hi Steady....you made it'. After high-fiving the other thru hikers there, I went to the store and got myself a well deserved ice cream. Even though I am hiking solo, I never feel alone. Another lady customer at the store asked if I was hiking the Appalachian Trail & told me to be careful. I am definitely very cautious on those rocks. In case of injury, I would not heal as easily as younger hikers.Then I got back on the trail and hiked another 7 miles & 3000 ft elevation to the shelter for the night.

He is from Maine....so homeward bound. Another one from Chicago called Some Dave... short for 'Some day, I'll make it to Katahdin.'Hiking was easier than yesterday. Today climbed a lot of trail stairs. I hear it's called Jacobs Ladder. Dan at the shelter is eating his Ramen noodles with chopsticks he made out of twigs. Ingenuous!!The trail was full of the promise of spring. There were tiny white flowers blooming all along the way today. New leaves budding on leafless trees.Thru-hikers say the best part of the trail is the people… it’s true. Glad I got the last spot at the shelter. It's going to rain tonight.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

At the resort, I ate a delicious giant burger. It tasted sooo good. Then checked into a cabin with 6 other hiker friends. All of us met on the trail. The hiker community is truly awesome.

I can understand why it is affectionately called the Fontana Hilton by thru hikers. It has hot showers & plug points to recharge electronics. Beautiful lake side location.Next, I walked across the dam & entered the Smokies after depositing my permit. After a while, I climbed Shuckstack Tower for my first major view of the Smokies. There were a lot of day hikers around Shuckstack.Another beautiful day for a hike. I was needlessly worried about pack weight. My back did not complain.
