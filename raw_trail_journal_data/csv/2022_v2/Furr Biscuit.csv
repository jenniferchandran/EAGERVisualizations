Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647891,"In Jan 2022, I decided to hike the beginning section of the Appalachian Trail in April.  It would have been better to do it when 10,000 others weren't starting their thru-hikes, but I had an opening in April and beggars can't be choosers.  So I've been training in Florida, doing nice long flat hikes in 85 degree heat because that's what northern Georgia in early April looks like (sigh...).  I felt really terrible doing a training hike today, but then I realized it was because the temp was almost 90 degrees and I'm not likely to endure anything within 30 of that mark in April on the AT.  BUT, I'm pretty nervous about the elevation changes.  My 55-year-old legs will almost certainly revolt.
During the hike today, I saw a stick that looked a little bit like a snake and nearly jumped out of my skin.  Preternatural moans/gasps escaped my body as I reacted to my certain early demise.  Clearly, it's been a while since I've been outdoors for extended periods, and I'm sure much hilarity will ensue from my novice camping and hiking skills.",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Thu",0
Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647894,"I made a personal promise in Jan that I would never EVER mention gear in this journal.  I find espousing on the low weight and durability and R-values of various sleeping bags, tents and packs beyond tedious and boring.  Tell me about the experiences on the trail, that's what I want to hear about!!  Having said that:Frogg Toggs are the greatest rain gear ever made.   I can forgive myself for saying this because Frogg Toggs aren't really hiking gear but rather a state of mind and philosophical ideal.  Buy the Ultra-lite2 jacket and pants for $35 including tax, wear them to church or yoga, and feel good about yourself.   I went out during thunderstorm conditions to give my stuff a good test, and while I struggled to hike at a good pace or sleep due to the wind and thunder, my Frogg Toggs made sure it was only my emotional state that was uncomfortable.  All physical body parts stayed dry and ventilated.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Fri",0

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648225,"My wife and I spent the night at Amicalola Falls Lodge.  I enjoyed the last bed/shower I would have for awhile; she complained about the thread count of the sheets.  Anyway, she joined me for a mile or so on the approach trail to Springer Mountain (AT starts at Springer Mtn) and then returned to drive the 8 hours back to Florida.  I think she had a much tougher first day than me.  
I hiked 7.6 miles from the Lodge to Springer, and then another 2.8 to Stover Creek Shelter.  Very full shelter and tent sites, but a great first day experience.  Most were trying to thru-hike to Maine and full of energy and vigor.  
Along the way I met Richard with Orange Hat.  Richard previously was Richard with White Hat until he was almost shot during whitetail deer hunting season.  Now he is Richard with Orange hat.  Richard was from LA.  I excitedly told him about my son who is going to school in LA and how much I enjoyed visiting California.  After I rambled for a few minutes, Richard indicated that he was from Lower Alabama.  Quite a character, Richard.  Richard was a very experienced hiker, so I was surprised at how slowly he hiked. He said he likes to hike slow and only take breaks at the shelters and seems to enjoy it more that way.  I eventually pulled away (too excited to go slow at Richard's pace), and then he passed me as I was enjoying lunch.  As I pulled into Stover Creek Shelter at around 3pm or so, Richard was just leaving to go on to a campsite down the trail.  Slow and consistent wins this race, I guess is the lesson.  I hate lessons.","Amicalola Falls Lodge

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648230,"Picture doesn't do it justice, but Gooch Mountain Shelter was overrun with hikers.  At a shelter with about 12 shelter spots and tent sites for 24, there were over 75 hikers trying to fit in.  Result: A lot of tents on slopes.  I was out of Stover Creek Shelter by about 8am and covered the 13 miles to Gooch by about 4pm. A young kid I met at Stover made it to Gooch by about 1pm.  He got the first tent site, and I got the last one.  Pretty bad, but at least I had a flat spot.  Many others came in later and had to makeshift their tent setups.Big wind and rain that night, but my stuff stayed relatively dry, so happy about that.I've been surprised at the number of folks at my advanced age on the trail.  I expected 90/10 ratio of young kids to older, but instead it feels more like 60/40.  Tons of retirees who have been wanting to do this for a long time.  One guy from Muncie IN had just retired, big knee wrap, and had hernia surgery 5 weeks ago, and now he's trying to make it to Maine.  Just wasn't going to wait any longer to start.","Stover Creek Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648233,"There's a section from Jarrard Gap to Neel Gap that requires any campers to use bear canisters.  For those starting from Gooch without a canister, it makes for an awkward day.  You can stop short around Lance Creek, but that's only a 9 mile day.  However, trying to make it to a campsite past Neel Gap means you are putting in a 20 mile day.  Most don't use bear canisters because of the 3pounds of additional weight.  Based on a small data sample, I would guess the ratio is 73 out of every 75 hikers don't use bear canisters, or 97%.  Out of the 75 people coming from Gooch, only Robert (in the red hat) and I were using bear canisters, and both of us decided to go to Woods Hole Shelter, which was a do-able and respectable 12 miles from Gooch and right in the middle of the BEAR CANISTER ZONE.  
I had an in-depth conversation with another hiker about bear canisters.  He tried it but didn't like it.  I said, ""I'm using it for convenience, I don't want to deal with finding the right tree for throwing a bear bag 15 feet up when the shelters don't have bear cables or boxes.""  He said, ""And anything we can do for the bears to keep them from accessing people food and and protecting them from becoming too aggressive going after food from humans is a good thing.""  I said, ""Yes, that's what I meant to say as the first reason.""
Robert (red hat) has a recreational therapy degree and has worked with vets in Colorado and with kids with serious medical issues at Victory Junction camps in NC (Richard Petty and the Petty family founded this non profit and donated the 80+ acres of land for it to use).  Robert is a super-interesting guy and very committed to his profession.
Tom is the gentleman in the beard, and he's a ridgerunner for the Appalachian Conservancy.  Tom spends 4 nights each week in the shelters from mid-Feb to end of April educating hikers on proper protocol for preparedness and taking care of the trails and campsites.  I knew Robert was going to be camping at Woody Hole from a discussion earlier in the day when he passed me.  At around 4pm, at a distance I saw Robert in a serious discussion with a very official looking person (Tom).  I thought ""Oh goodness, what have we here?""  As it turns out, Robert is just a serious looking dude.  They were waiting for me to arrive since the shelter is .4 miles from the trail.  Tom is a great guy and gave us a lot of information about the trail. I almost mis-stepped at the start, as I asked Tom what he does about aches and pains given his age (I was suffering from aches and pains).  Then I realized when it was out of my mouth that he might be a lot younger than my 55 years of age, but too late.  Tom said, ""I'm 75, and I just ignore them.""  So in the picture, you're looking at the youngest-looking 75 year old I've ever met. He hikes 10-12 miles between the shelters every day to provide the hiker education and eats and sleeps in the cold with the hikers.  The day before, Tom helped a hiker shave 3 pounds from pack weight just by eliminating a number of ziploc bags.  When I squeezed my coffee bag into my coffee, Tom said, ""Squeeze it a little bit more, no reason to pack out that water weight.""  The #1 thing he works with hikers on is preparedness.  For example, a lot of hikers think, ""I'm going to hike until I'm tired and then camp.""  Tom tries to explain that an appropriate camping site might not be available when you get tired, so try to plan for where the end might be.  Another hiker told him about the hostel he would be staying at that night, and Tom informed him that the hostel is closed.  Things like that.  Pretty cool service provided by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648234,"Tough day today.  I decided I wanted to be in town to see the Final Four basketball games, so that meant I needed to get 15 miles in today, which included summits of Blood Mountain and Wildcat Mountain.  I left Woody Hole at 6am and was on my way in the pre-dawn.  Tough initial climb up to Blood Mountain, which is the highest elevation in GA at 4458 feet.  Not Everest, but a real slap in the face in the pre-dawn hours.  I then proceeded on to Neel Gap, where the Mountain Crossing outfitters have a location on site.  They fixed my chest strap on my pack, and I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh coffee, apples and bananas they sold.  Also re-supplied on Advil...The rest of the day was a series of pointless ups and downs, and Wildcat Mtn was a crazy big incline over a short distance.  My knees really started feeling it at the end.  Probably too many miles for me this early in the hike, but I think the Duke/NC match up is sports history given Coach K's last year, so pushed it a little bit.","Woody Hole Shelter

I asked.  ""Just a lot of MacGyver stuff that you would never really need,"" he said.  His grandmother is intrigued with the AT and taught him a lot about the trail, so now he's hiking the whole thing.  Super-nice guy.","Unicoi Gap

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648501,"I was planning to hike 12 miles today to a campsite a couple of miles north of Dick's Creek Gap, then I realized I could sneak back into town at the Gap and see the NCAA championship game between North Carolina and Kansas (and get a shower, food, clean bed).  ""Good move,"" I think, as I enjoy pizza while watching the game.  Good hiking day today using the hiking poles, I'm sold on them for anyone over the age of 50.  My knees are grateful.  Tomorrow is supposed to rain buckets starting at about 11am, so I'm getting back on the trail at 7:30am to try to hike 4 miles to Plumorchard Gap Shelter before the rain starts. While waiting for my ride at Dick's Creek Gap, Smokey Bear noticed me and provided a much-needed Pepsi.  Smokey hiked the AT during the pandemic in 2020 and did it all except for the Smoky Mountains, which were closed then.  When he saw day hikers, he would tell them (as an expert) about the dreaded Appalachian Trail Spider that poisoned all who came in contact with it.  Quite the character, Smokey.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648502,"I was able to hike the 4.5 miles to Plumorchard Gap Shelter by 11am, and then on cue the rain started and continued through most of the afternoon.  Many chose to adhere to the ""No rain, no pain, no Maine"" mantra and continue on with their hikes.  The wisdom of 55 years held me back in the shelter for the afternoon watching them come and go.  Most who stayed in the shelter that afternoon also decided to stay the night after the rain subsided at 4pm.  I decided to hike a few more miles down the trail given my laziness for the entire afternoon.  Had this picture of my wife asking, ""How was the hiking trip you've been looking forward to for so many years.""  ""Pretty good, really enjoyed sitting in the shelters,"" says I.  Most who were staying were a little confused by my decision to start back up so late in the day.  I didn't ease their fears by: (1) getting lost coming out of camp, doing a complete circle and reappearing before them, and then after a restart (2) forgetting my hiking poles and going back to camp to get them.  ""Now it's a thing, you have to go,"" said one.   I hiked about 2.5 miles out before I became concerned that I would get lost and eaten by any number of predators wandering the trail at dusk.  This was the first time I had camped outside of the shelters.  It was good!  Much easier to relieve oneself in the middle of the night when you're not worried about going on someone else.Speaking of midnight relief, let's talk about one of the things I've learned on the trail.  When I got my cool headlamp, I noticed it had three light settings.  One was a nice broad beam a light - good.  The second was a focused beam of light - OK, but not sure why I would ever use it.  The third was a red light - completely useless.  I took this ignorance with me to Gooch Mountain Shelter, where there were about 75 campers.  In the middle of the night, I went out to use the privy and, given my placement in the camp, I wandered across the entire camp from my tent to the privy.  I couldn't see too well, so I certainly used my headlight with the nice bright broad beam setting.  The next morning, I got up early and noticed others up early as well - all using the red light.  It turns out, the red light is a lot less intrusive to those who are sleeping than the bright beam I had midnight-paraded through the entire camp on my way to the privy.  Lesson learned, forever and always.  To finish the paragraph, the focused beam is very useful when hiking in mist or dark conditions.  There were probably instructions somewhere that informed me of all this, but who has time for instructions?","Dick's Creek Gap

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648506,"Hiked 10 miles today to Standing Indian Shelter.  I crossed into North Carolina today with Matt - notable because I would have missed the sign altogether if he hadn't called out to me for a picture.  I expected much more fanfare than the small sign you see here, but I guess 78 miles on a 2200-mile trail is a bit ho-hum.  Trail: ""Nice job, little guy (patting me on the head), only 2100-ish more miles to complete a real man's (or real woman's) hike.""
North Carolina is definitely a better experience than Georgia, in my opinion.  Georgia had so many pointless ups and downs.  Many times you weren't actually climbing anything with a name, but it hurt all the same.  Even when it was a Prestigious Name Mountain, it seemed to be summit-less.  You'd knew you were at the top because the trail stopped going up, but there was no view or anything else of significance to see.  And the severe downs seemed to all start within 20 feet of the finish of the ups.  The GA trails were designed by sado-machochists who were trying to keep the good Georgia people home on Saturdays to watch Bulldog football.  I guess it worked.
North Carolina trail makers were rolling switchback loving people who wanted severe ups to be for an event.  The rolling switchbacks are beautiful formations, providing relatively flat hiking surfaces over long periods of trail despite the relatively severe up or down landscape. Severe ups certainly exist in NC, but they are interesting ups with a payoff at the end like at Albert Mountain (to come).  North Carolina clearly did not have college or pro sports to attend to in the fall or spring or summer, so there was nothing to thwart smart decisions on trail design.  I would imagine NC's ice skating rinks are poorly constructed given Duke and NC basketball.
I stayed at the shelter rather than tenting tonight.  I arrived early enough to get the last spot, which was a good thing given the heavy rain again that night.  I stayed very dry but got very little sleep - the rain is extremely loud on the roof of this shelter and continued for most of the night.  Even after the rain ended, any time the wind blew strong, we'd have water coming down loud onto the shelter.
This brings me to another item I didn't know.  The wind noise in the Georgia mountains is beautiful and reminds me of ocean waves breaking onto a beach.  It was very windy while in Georgia, and the sound that the wind makes in the Georgia mountains is a constant, beautiful white noise.  I was fearful of it at first, waiting for the gust to hit my tent and blow it over.  It never really happens that way.  It's an accumulation of the sound of the wind across thousands of trees in the mountains that hits your ears without you ever feeling the full brunt of the wind.  I didn't know it existed like this and it's very nice.  I'm sure a lot of this is the placement of the shelters.  So, good job GA on the placement of shelters, it almost makes me forgive you for the pointless up and down trails.","Campsite past Plumorchard Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648507,"I wanted to cover 16 miles to Long Branch Shelter today so I could easily get into town the next day (weather reasons).  I started at 6am and hiked for the first mile in the dark (using the high beam setting on my headlamp).  The first mile was the ascent of Standing Indian Mountain, so I wasn't going to be moving very fast regardless.  After that, the trail opened up to relatively easy hiking and I could cover ground easily.  In fact, I was passed by a running Weezer trying to beat her best mile time on the AT.  She did it, but said it proves that it was a flat section of the trail.  Toward the end of the day, we climbed Albert Mountain, which at times involved throwing the poles up to the next cliff so I could get a handhold to hoist myself up onto the next cliff.  Great summit with amazing views and a fire tower that heralded 100 miles on the AT.  The night's low temps were around 28 or so, the coldest so far.  My sleeping gear is holding up very well to it, but I'm an active sleeper and woke up several times because of body parts exposed to the cold.  Also, unfortunately at some point you have to actually get out of your sleeping bag in the morning.  Very chilly.","Standing Indian Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648508,"As I mentioned, I did higher mileage yesterday due to weather.  A few days ago, I read the following weather report on ATweather.org for the evening of April 8:""Snow showers likely, with a low of around 24. Breezy, with wind of 20 mph and gusts as high as 34 mph. Snow accumulation of 1 to 2 inches possible.""It seemed like a good time to head to town and get out of the weather.  Given the 16 miles yesterday, I had an easy 7 miles today to Winding Stair Gap, and a waiting shuttle ride to get me into Franklin, NC.  No particular plans this evening, other than to do laundry, resupply for next week, and eat at Taco Bell and Dominos.  Might watch a little TV...","Long Branch Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648826,"Weather forecast said it would be clearing in the afternoon, so I arranged for a shuttle at noon back to Winding Stair gap and planned to hike 8 miles to Wine Spring campsite.  It was a good plan, except that the weather never cleared.  I spent the afternoon hiking in snow and ice during a snowstorm as the temps continued to drop.  Wine spring is at an elevation of 5300 feet while the Siler Bald shelter is only 5 miles out at 4800 feet, so I grabbed a spot at around 3pm at Siler Bald shelter (caution vs valor).  I spent the next hour in a sleeping bag getting warm and napping. By the time I got up at 4pm, Jet Ski, Lobster and Dorito (JLD group) had somehow started a fire (cotton balls lathered in vaseline as a fire starter, I was told).  Never one to miss playing with fire, I fended off boredom for the rest of the evening with the JLD group by collecting wet firewood, drying it out next to the fire, feeding it to the flames, and snacking.  Tom later joined us, having hiked 14 miles through the snow from Albert Mountain to our spot at Siler Bald shelter.  It was a nice getting to know this group, not the worst way to spend a snowy, cold evening.  I went to sleep at around 8pm, hunkered down for temps of 27 degrees and wind gusts of around 30 mph.  Sleeping bag did its job well, but I woke up many times throughout the night when my active sleeping resulted in various body parts out of the bag and exposed to the cold.","Winding Stair Gap

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648832,"My sleeping bag was toasty, so it was difficult getting out in the mid-20s temperature to pack up.  The weather forecast was encouraging, though, calling for a clear day, afternoon highs of mid-50s and an evening low of around 40, a big improvement vs the past few days.  Out of camp, Tom convinced me to climb the 0.2 mile steep uphill side trail to Siler Bald to see the 360-degree views of the mountains.  Very cool views, but now it's 8:30am, I'm tired, and I haven't even begun the hiking day. Oh well, as my old boss from the non-PC 1990s would say, ""Kurt, if you want sympathy, you can find it in the dictionary between sh*t and syphilis.""
The trail during the morning was cold and slick, as hikers compacted the snow turning it to ice. The afternoon was warmer and a muddy, slippery mess as the snow and ice melted and left large lakes on the trail.  I fell down 4 times today, and I'm pretty happy I fell only 4 times given the conditions.  Around midday, we came to Wayah Bald stone fire tower.  I was about to ascend the tower when I saw Dorito coming down the steps and then fall the last 5 steps with his feet way above his head (ice on the steps).  He was ok, but I decided to pass on the fire tower views.  Just a big slippery mess of a day everywhere. 
Trail magic today by ""I'm Nobody"", who provided us with fresh fruit, granola bars, pop, a trash can, and a nice warm fire.  He's a really nice guy who enjoys meeting the hikers.  The trash can is the biggest perk for me in this set.  I really enjoy getting rid of my packed trash.  Only a few ounces of weight, but totally useless weight and nice to discard.  
At around 2pm after 11 miles, I met up with JLD group and Tom at Cold Spring Shelter, and we discussed whether to go another 6 miles to Wesser Bald Shelter.  JLD group wanted to spend the next night at a hostel close to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC), so they decided to stay at Cold Spring since the next day's hike was only 11 miles to the NOC.  Tom was section hiking for 2 weeks, so he wanted to get some more miles done, and he convinced me to continue on to Wesser Bald.  Tom's ideas definitely sound easy and reasonable to a naive novice like me, but generally resulted in pain to the novice's feet, legs and back :)
More about Tom: he's an engineer, about my age, incredibly fit, trained by hiking 20 miles and camping in 10-degree weather, enjoys competitive cross-country skiing in the winter and long-distance sailing in the summer, and paddle boards and runs up sand dunes for fitness.  Biggest difference in mindset between Tom and me: I trained by doing 10-mile hikes and thought I could do 12-15 mile days on the AT; Tom trained by doing 20-mile hikes and thought he could do 12-15 mile days on the AT.  Engineers are a different breed of cat, for sure. 
The last 4 miles of the day involved 2.4 miles of steep incline followed by 1.4 miles of steep decline into camp.  I saw this coming on the Far Out app, so I told Tom, ""You're much faster and I'm dying, so go ahead and I'll meet you at camp.""  I think Tom was concerned about the ""I'm dying"" part of my statement, so he slowed way down to keep an eye on me.  I felt bad about slowing him down, but not so bad that I said anything further about him going ahead - the conversation helped take my mind off the steep incline we were hiking.  The incline led to a fire tower (2nd of the day) with more beautiful views.  We arrived in camp at around 5pm.","Siler Bald Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648833,"Tom and I both planned for a 13-mile day to Sassafras shelter.  This involved a 6-mile steep descent into Bryson City and then a steep 7-mile ascent to Sassafras Gap shelter.  The morning descent was hard on the knees and other joints, as it's just relentless downhill pressure for about 3 hours.  The payoff is great though.  Bryson City is on the trail, and its most famous inhabitant is the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  The NOC is a strong outfitter and a good place to print out the pass needed to enter the Smoky Mountain National Park.  In addition to the NOC, there's a restaurant, general store, hostels and hotels, kayaking, and other things helpful for hikers. Tom and I met for lunch at the restaurant - I enjoyed salad, burger, fries and a beer, while Tom opted for salad, pizza and beer.  Quite a treat on the trail.  In the Far Out app, many hikers left comments about their intention to hike to Sassafras but were too buzzed to finish and instead camped short of this goal.  Very understandable.As an aside, I'm finding that my cravings in town are for fresh fruit and salad.  My meals on the trail consist of noodles, peanut butter, and granola/energy bars. When in town, I'm really enjoying the crunch of an apple or garden salad.  When I do more of this in the future, I need to figure out a better trail meal plan - definitely bored with my food selections.The afternoon was a brutal 7-mile ascent, going from Bryson City at 1700 feet elevation to Sassafras Gap Shelter at 4400 feet elevation.  A bit of a struggle for me here, and not helped much by the Stella I had for lunch.So another thing I've learned on the trail is the value of the Far Out app.  I'm embarrassed I didn't use it initially, I just figured my guidebook would suffice.  The Far Out app uses GPS to follow you through the trail and provides very accurate read-outs of how far you are from shelters, camp sites, the next water source, interesting views, roads/parking lots, and it also provides the elevations of the trail. After downloading, it works even without cell phone service and is a great safety tool.  Comments left by other hikers are very helpful as well, and most of my shuttle drivers came from the recommendations of other hikers. Tomorrow is my last day on the trail, so I'm looking forward to getting up early, hiking down to Stecoah Gap, meeting my ride to Knoxville airport, a layover in Atlanta, and, if all goes well, I'll spend tomorrow night in my bed in Sarasota.  Can't imagine anything going wrong with that plan...","Wesser Bald Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651608,"I've got a 10-day stretch where I'm free and have decided to do a bit more on the trail.  I'm going to try to do 100 miles from Stecoah Gap to Max Patch.  This morning, I woke up at 5:30am in Cincinnati and was at Max Patch parking lot by 1pm.  Fred, the greatest shuttle driver ever for the AT, met me there and was able to get me to Stecoah Gap by 3pm.  Fred was the one who took me from Stecoah to Knoxville Airport at the end of my first stint.  His dad started doing a shuttle service for hikers in 1991, and Fred would help out now and then.  Once Fred retired, he took over the service for his dad, and he knows every nook and cranny of the trail for the first 250 miles or so. When he dropped me off, he said, ""If you run into any problems, just give me a call and we'll figure something out.""  It eases your mind for a guy like Fred to have your back.  Fred is an AT institution, and I'm glad to have met him.
I started off from Stecoah GAP at 3pm and had a lot of pent-up energy from traveling, so I went much further than I thought I would, eight miles to Cable Gap Shelter.  I got into camp at around 7pm, which is late for me, but I quickly set up my tent and site and was trying to sleep by about 10pm.  Weather is much warmer than I remember from my stint in April, and I was still sleeping outside my sleeping bag at 10pm.  It turned a little chilly after that, and I eventually ended up in my bag.  This is a big difference from my first stint, where I was always dreading getting out of the sleeping bag at night and in the morning.  When 50 degrees is the low, you can deal with the night and morning chill, as opposed to the 25-35 degrees in early April where I was trying to plan every morning move before I got out of the bag.","Stecoah Gap

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651613,"I was out of camp by 7:30am and hiked the remaining 5 miles to Fontana Dam in the morning.  At the restroom near Fontana Marina, I called the lodge shuttle and was able to get to the shuttle by noon to get my permit for Smoky Mountain National Forest.  I did a mini-resupply at Fontana Marina (extra stove fuel, insect repellant, TP, other things that I had forgotten and didn't have enough of), and also got a deli sandwich for dinner that night.  Other were enjoying beers and sandwiches at the Marina or had gone into town to spend the night at Fontana Lodge. Since I was only in my second day, I continued on.  In the afternoon, I went by Fontana Hilton, which is one of the nicest AT shelters and included showers, electronics charging station, picnic tables, and beautiful views of the lake.  I continued on over Fontana dam.  The dam was closed to car traffic due to construction, but hikers were permitted to cross.  Beautiful views from the dam and kind of a nice change of pace from the normal trail.Shortly after the dam, the trail entered into the Smoky Mountain National Forest and a steep 8 miles uphill to the Birch Spring campsite.  A young guy passed me easily about halfway up - in camp, he told me he saw two bears on the trail, one which immediately went off into the woods and the other stood his ground in a stare down.  What did you do?  ""I said, 'Good bear, nice bear, don't eat me bear,' while backing away very slowly.  The bear eventually left the trail and the young guy continued on to Birch campsite. I camped next to Mockingbird, a 67-year-old who is trying to do 1000 miles on the AT.  He is an experienced hiker, having previously done 500 miles on the AT and extensive hiking in Spain and Ecuador.  Mockingbird entertained us with stories about learning to sail with a girlfriend who lived on a sailboat - she was scared to death of forests/wilderness at night, and Mockingbird was scared to death of the ocean at night.","Cable Gap Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651662,"I had a relatively easy planned day today, trying to do 11 miles to Spence Field Shelter. However, around noon, I received an email that required me to be back home by Wednesday, shortening my planned 10-day trip to 8 days.  No time like the present to start doing the longer miles, so I adjusted my day's goal to try to make 17 miles to Derrick Knob Shelter. As you can see in the picture, there was bear scat of substantial size on the trail today.  I laid out my glasses for perspective (not to try to make a bear scat face, although it seems I had some success with this as well).  There were about 10 of these on the trail today.  Fred, my shuttle driver, noted that the Smoky Mountains National Parks don't allow for bear hunting and, in his opinion, this creates an environment where they are too many aggressive bears as compared to areas outside of the Smokies, where they generally allow 2-4 weeks of bear hunting per year.  My limited experience in the Smokies would indicate Fred is correct, way more bear sign and activity in the Smokies compared to other areas.Around 3pm, it started to rain buckets, and I pulled into Spence Field Shelter about a half hour later, not too wet.  I secured a space in the dry shelter to wait out the rain.  I wanted to hike another 6 miles to the next shelter, but the rain continued so I decided to hold on the longer miles for future days.  As I started to plan out the next several days of hiking, I realized I was in for some pretty big miles - 15, 17 and 19 mile days were in my future, a lot more than the 10-12 mile days I had originally planned.  Also, finding a place to resupply and still make these bigger mile days was going to be an issue.  I looked to see if I could stretch my 5 days of food to 8 days.  My 5 days of food was pretty robust, and I hadn't eaten any of my packed food while in Fontana since food places were available there, so I felt comfortable stretching it to 8 days.  Much more worried about the higher mileage days.   Around 8pm, a Smoky Mountain Parks ridgerunner and several hikers came into camp.  The ridgerunner had shut down Russell Field Shelter, about 3 miles away from Spence, due to bear activity and required all the hikers to go to the next shelter.  Apparently, a hiker had left a food bag open at Russell Field Shelter and then had gone to get water from the nearby spring.  The bear saw this and ran into the shelter to retrieve the food bag.  Once this story was told to the ridgerunner, he consulted with others in the park service and shut down the shelter.  I asked the ridgerunner, what happens now?  He said, ""We'll try to antagonize the bear to get it to move away from the shelter and, if not successful, we'll have to relocate the bear.""  One of the hikers had video of the bear waiting/pacing around the outside of the shelter area.  Also, the ridgerunner saw my bear cannister and asked me to hang it on the bear cables.  Really?  The reason I got the bear cannister was so I wouldn't have to mess with hanging it.  ""The bears are so persistent, if they find your cannister they will stay after it until it is miles away from here,"" said the ridgerunner.  So I learned from the ridgerunner how to hang my bear cannister.  More experienced hikers shook their heads in dismay and said, ""I've never seen a bear cannister hung on a bear cable before...""","Birch Spring Gap tent site

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651665,"Left camp by 6:30am to get a head start on hiking a 19-mile day.  In the morning, I came across a young lady on the ground being attended to by her boyfriend.  There was a huge tree across the trail up about 5.5 feet, and she had hiked face-first into the tree without seeing it.  ""Focused!"" I commented.  They didn't think it was very funny (some jokes are only for me).  She was sitting down and insisting that she was fine, so I continued on.  I ran into a ridgerunner about a half mile later and alerted her to their situation.  I met the couple again at the next shelter - the ridgerunner had stopped and provided some advice on dealing with the injury, which they appreciated.  Although when the young lady said, ""Yeah, I'm still a little dizzy,"" the boyfriend frowned and said, ""You're dizzy?""   I met Notebook at the shelter I stopped at for lunch.  Notebook got his name because he volunteered to carry 13 notebooks to be used as shelter journals to each of the Smokies shelters, adding about 10 pounds to his pack weight.  ""Yeah, I'm having a real hard time finding others to carry even one of these for me,"" he said.  ""Gotta go, Notebook,"" said I. The 19 miles took me through Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT.  When I asked Notebook which part of the trail he likes the most, he said the trail from Double Spring Gap shelter to Clingman's Dome is amazing, which is the part I was getting ready to do.  He was right.  I've read before that there are more species of flora and fauna in the Smokies than anywhere in the US, and this part of the hike is Exhibit A to prove that.  It was beautiful, very mossy and ferny and leafy and all those other scientific adjectives to describe the emeralds and greens of the Smokies.  The park service protecting the Smokies has done an amazing job, and these trails are worth exploring just for the greenery. 19 miles is a lot for me, but I was doing pretty well with it.  Unfortunately, my luck ran out on mile 15 as it began to rain in buckets.  And kept raining for the next two hours.  And turned a bit colder.  This was the first time I started to worry about my rain preparation.  I had my sleeping bag and clothes in a pack liner and I had put on a pack cover when it started raining, but it was really raining hard for two hours and I was getting nervous about whether everything was staying dry.  My hiking shoes, socks and pants were completely soaked and starting to get pretty cold.  It finally stopped raining at about 7pm, and I pulled into camp at about 7:30pm.  I quickly put up my tent and checked my pack contents - everything was dry, thank goodness.  I changed into dry clothes and got into my sleeping bag, foregoing the normal chores of getting water, eating dinner, etc.  The temp had dropped to high 40s, and it took me a while to get warm.  I think I was pretty far from hypothermia but could start to understand the dangers of hypothermia from this experience given how long it took me to get warm.","Spence Field Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651667,"The guy I was tenting next to woke up at 4am to start an early day.  I was initially annoyed but had 15 miles to do today so I quickly realized it was best to get moving. My shoes were still soaked.  My socks were mostly dry but would become soaked as soon as I put on shoes.  My pants were soaked, so I used long underwear and rain pants for my hiking pants.  It was a new experience for me to deal with wet clothing.  I put everything that was wet on my pack's outside pockets to keep them away from my dry clothes and for easy access to dry out later in the day when the sun was shining.  At some point, I realized that I still had dry clothing for my top, but I was wearing the last bit of dry clothing for my bottoms - so I changed into my wet hiking pants to make sure I had something dry to change into at night.  I grimaced as I put on my wet shoes and struggled with them throughout the day. At one particularly annoying point, I decided to take them off for a minute on the trail.  I struggled to get one of them off since they were so wet, but finally, with one final effort, got it off and it flew out of my hands.  As you can see in the picture, the shoe ended up close to the other side of the trail.  What you can't see is that there was a 50-foot drop-off on the other side of the trail.  I was pretty close to donating my hiking shoe to the bears and other wildlife of the Smokies - yikes, that would have created a less-than-convenient obstacle...During the afternoon, I went through Newfound Gap, which is a huge draw for tourists because it is on the AT and close to Gatlinburg.  On this particular Sunday, people were out in abundance on the trail.  I was really happy to see so many people enjoying the trails given all the hard work that goes into maintaining them.  Most through-hikers I had met were going into Gatlinburg for resupply, but I continued on to try to make my Wed deadline.  The weather was unpredictable today.  Some hikers were calling for 0% chance of rain while others said 60%, and each had sources.  It ended up as a low foggy mist that the Smokies are known for throughout most of the day.  Not a soaking rain like yesterday, but too wet to dry out the clothes that had gotten wet yesterday.","Mount Collins Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651669,"Today was a 14-mile day, but the trail was relatively flat for the back half of the day.  This made for an easier day than most.  By the way, it should be noted that I've been taking about 6 advil per day, which does wonders for my knees when hiking. So when I say it was an easier day than most, I'm still doing it with the much-needed Vitamin A.I hiked a bit with Roadblock, who is a travel surgical nurse.  Roadblock is in her late-50s and works on a per diem basis until she has enough money to hike the various trails she wants to hike.  In her own words, Roadblock hikes slow but can go forever.  I pass her on the trail, and then she passes me when I take a break.  This happened several times during the course of the day.  Roadblock had a huge bruise on and above her lip - she had fallen last week and was still recovering.  Fortunate that the injuries didn't require stitches.  The picture shows a stone wall built to support the trail.  Just amazing, I'm still trying to figure out how the park services would hike in the equipment to build this and gather the stones to be used for this long stone wall.  Every once in a while, I'll see something like this and not be able to figure out how the structure got built - incredible efforts.Weather started misty this morning, but cleared off in the afternoon, and we're expecting more good weather tomorrow.","Pecks Corner Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651670,"Last big day today.  Tomorrow, I hope to have a short walk to my car at Max Patch, but today is a big 18 mile day.  The first part of the trail today was either flat or downhill, so I was able to complete 7 miles to Davenport Gap by 10:30am.  Then it became confusing.  The signage was pretty clear that the trail proceeded along the highway (rather than into the woods, as per normal), but it was so different from what the ""normal"" trail looks like that I kept doubting myself.  What should have taken 20 minutes to move over Pigeon River Bridge, along the highway, under I-40 overpass and back onto the trail, instead took about an hour as I kept doubling back to make sure I hadn't missed a sign.  The remainder of the day was mostly steep uphill to an FAA communications tower and then eventually into camp.  Weird.I broke out earphones for the first time given the long day, and it helped to occupy my mind for long stretches.  Definitive 132 playlist was outstanding, as always.In camp, I met Mayor, who was the 2nd traveling nurse I have met in the past week.  He also works until he can afford to do the hikes he wants to do, and then returns back to work.  Also met Palatin, who is a former marine that wants to write a book about the AT after he has through-hiked.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Furr Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651671,"What I thought would be an easy 6 miles to Max Patch was more of an effort than I expected.  I think I'm ready to be done.  Made it to Max Patch at around 11am and started the 6-hour drive back home.  With an appropriate stop at Burger King to refuel.
My trail name of Furr Biscuit was given to me by Fugi, an old high school friend.  Our hikes admittedly were limited to 10-20 feet to beer coolers, but I enjoyed them as much as anything on the AT.  Fugi played tuba in the band, his childhood home was in a wonderfully central location in town so much time was spent at his place, he joined the marines and was in desert storm, and he was a great friend.  He never liked my last name, so he developed many derivatives, such as Fry-your-burgers, Freak-your-biscuits, Furr-burglar, before settling on Furr Biscuit.  Fugi passed about 8 years ago.  Rest in peace, buddy.","Groundhog Creek Shelter
