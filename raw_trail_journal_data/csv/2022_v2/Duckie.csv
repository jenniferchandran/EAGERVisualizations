Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651053,"Sitting in a very nice AirBnb in Waynesboro, VA just outside of the southern entrance to Shenandoah National Park relaxing and enjoying the calm after the whirlwind week getting ready to depart. My wife threw a major cog in the works, needing surgery for a broken bone in her hand earlier this week (really). Some people will pull out all the stop to get you from leaving. In all seriousness, she has been amazingly supportive of me (although I'm pretty sure she things I'm nuts) and I wouldn't be sitting hear about to depart without her support and blessing. Unfortunately this means the final shakedown hike was cancelled and I am now violating one of the prime directives - don't depart with gear you haven't used yet. Fortunately they are summer versions (not as warm) of gear that I have already used.
I think that I have all the gear dialed in (at least until I am out there for a couple weeks) except for the camp shoes. Still wavering on which ones to bring.
Excited, nervous, and ready to start all rolled into one.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651117,"Started my Appalachian Trail Flip Flop Thru Hike today from Rockfish Gap at the southern end of Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. I’ll be hiking north to the end at Mt Katadinnin Maine and then getting picked up and driven back to Rockfish Gap where I’ll hike south to Springer Mt in Georgia. 


With my wife still recovering from surgery to repair a broken bone in here hand my parents came down too so they could drive her back home. We kicked off the morning at the Waffle House next to the hotel for a send off waffle. Afterwards we headed down to the nondescript Rockfish Gap sign I picked as the starting point. 


Moderately rolling terrain today with no big climbs. Not many great views but the ones that I had were beautiful albeit hazy. Not too hot but definitely muggy. No listed water sources today from the start to camp although there was the occasional runoff stream from the weather earlier in the weoo. An afternoon Tstorm rolled through just after I got the tent setup. 


Passed by 5 other Thru Hikers and there are 5 here at the shelter including one that passed me. Beaver Chew had the honor of being the first hiker that passed me. 


Overall was a good first day and I’m glad to finally be out here. Feet are doing fine and generally nothing is sore. I did switch to the sandals at the last minute and that was a good choice. Trying to start slow but looks like maybe limited water again tomorrow.  So might need to go to the next shelter about 13 miles away.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651183,"Slept OK but it was bright all night with the full moon and the sun rises early when you are in a tent. Got about 5 continuous hours then on and off till I got up. Ate breakfast at the shelter as there was convenient water and was second to last one out at 7:50. Water about mile 2 and then dry to the campsite so was carrying 4l to start which feels significantly heavier. 


Overcast morning with the occasional brief drizzle which cleared up min day. Not many views today but the flowers were beautiful. Rhododendron and Mt Laurel are just starting to bloom. There weren’t many yesterday but lots today made up for lack of views. Trail is pretty good with more dirt trails than rocky trails which let’s you look around more. 


Ate better today than yesterday. Was actually a bit hungry today although probably still didn’t eat enough. Body holding up well. Still feeling good despite the heavier pack longer day. Started feeling a hot spot on left heel mid day so now sporting some lukotape. 


Hiked with Sparkles (both), Whoopie and Buckeye a bunch and leapfrogged a trio of section hikers that started same time as me. Site is packed tonight with at least 15 thru hikers and a dozen section hikers. They got hit with some afternoon downpours which I managed to avoid. 


All in all a good day. Looks like another 13 tomorrow

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651293,"There was a loud bird singing as I tried to go to sleep (I think it’s the one same one we’ve had in Wharton forest before) which was super annoying. However once I fell asleep slept pretty good. Had to add a layer around 1. Left camp about 7:30 heading for a picnic area to eat breakfast. Long uphill right out of camp but led to the first of many spectacular views.Couple miles down the trail saw 53, Harmony, Orbitz and Sparkles just as Harmony’s trail mom arrived with birthday goodies for her.  Two donuts and a bunch of clementines rounded out mid morning snack. 


Hiked with them until we stopped for lunch at the Loft Mt Store. I grabbed a freal smoothie and then got some lunch from the trail magic Relish and Play by Play (twin sisters) parents were providing. They had a bunch of outlets at the store so also topped off the phone and power brick. 


Heading out from lunch was a long uphill with limited shade that was a tough climb however the wildflowers were spectacular along the trail for extended portions. Every mile it seemed there was another great view. For me it’s all new and I’ve been doing the touristy pictures while the others walk past. However I caught Harmony’s group stopped and admiring the view at what turned out to be the last one of the day. 


I’m camped at a tent site near the Pinefield shelter listening to the large creek rushing by. No cell service here. 


Not sure yet of the plans for tomorrow. Might hit Elkton for resupply, shower and laundry but I have almost enough food to make Luray which is about 2 days further and there’s a camp store in between to restock.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651295,"Had a nice flat camp site off to the side in the woods so was actually pretty quiet and got a pretty good nights sleep. Waking up about 5:45 but snoozing until 6:15 or so. For having so little stuff it’s amazing how long it takes to get to get packed up, gather water, cook and eat, finish loading the pack and het hiking. 


Started settling into a routine for the day which is basically broken into the need for water stops or how far away is the next water source and trail terrain to determine how much to carry. Once arrive at camp setup tent and then sleeping stuff. Gather all food from pack into bear bag and head down to shelter table to cook dinner and socialize. 


Still at the back of the pack leaving and some fast kids quickly caught me. Only saw a couple of hikers today in total. Caught up to Papi briefly at High Top and Sparkles(2) passed me there while I was eating lunch. 



The wildflowers were really stunning and the Trillium were in full force. Thousands covering Hight Top Mt. A couple of really good views including the lunch spot on High Top.
Was running out of some supplies and certain foods so decided to exit at Swift Run Gap and stay the night in Small Ax Hostel in Elkton VA. Caught up with Sparkles(2) at the gap and got a ride into Elkton with a weekend hiker. Had a stop at the Appalachian Trail outfitter and got some tuna and chicken packets out of the hiker box there and got a shower as well. Grabbed a beer at the Elkton brewery on the way. The hostel is a converted barn on a working farm. There was a big dinner including a massive salad and a fantastic strawberry covered pound cake. Staying here with Orchid and Red (Irish) as well.


Planning to take a zero or two nero (nearly zero) in Lurray which is in 34 miles but the shelters don’t line up well so not sure of the plan yet.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651510,"So stayed in the Small Axe Hostile last night which is a converted barn with Red, Orchid, Sparkles and lots of pigs, goats, and sheep. I got their dinner and breakfast which were huge. Had rice, beans, and sausage for dinner with a massive salad and a strawberry covered poundcake for desert. Eggs , sausage, a chocolate pastry and lots of fruit for breakfast. The Hostel had a very friendly young orange tabby so I got some kitty pets in. Got a ride back to the Swift Run Gap with Wayne the shuttle driver along with Sparkles. 


Today marked the first day when we started entering the green tunnel as everything was emerald green for the first couple of miles. It had rained overnight but the trail was not actually too wet. I did a couple things at the trail head and ended up not catching Sparkles until lunch. Met up with Orchid, Relish, Play-by-play, Big Hunger and couple other hikers at the Louis campground where I had lunch. Other than that I ended up hiking by myself most of the day although I got passed by a couple of hikers after lunch. 


I continued on past the next hut as I’m trying to make it to Luray, VA which is a little over 30 miles away from Swift Run Gap so trying to split the difference.  Climbed Bearface Mt and took the rock scramble to a 360° view of Shenandoah which is just absolutely stunning and well worth the side trail. I did it without the backpack as I left the backpack on side of trail. At Hazeltop mountain there were some very nice sites that would’ve had a view of a sunset but I did not have enough water so I pushed onto the next water source. I camped in a grassy meadow. I was planning to cowboy camp but by the time I got the ground sheet laid out it already had one spider and two Beatles crawling on it so decided to pitch the tent instead. Talked to Sheila a little bit and caught up with some of the news from home. 


Today marked the longest backpacking trip I’ve done in terms of both mileage and days.


Today was also the longest day so far on this trip and I was definitely getting a little bit tired at the end of the day. I was just making slow steady progress but otherwise still feeling pretty good. The left knee was a tiny bit sore at the end of the day but otherwise not too bad and muscles generally feel good.  My feet are holding up well and so far my neuroma toe has not had any kind of problems which is fantastic - shout out to Dr. Cafengiu for the insoles and met pad. About the only issue I’m having is the toenail on my right pinky toe, which I messed up a bit in training, bugs me a little bit if I don’t put the Leuko tape on it. Otherwise I can’t complain.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651512,"Slept OK last night. So far I wouldn’t say I’m sleeping great and probably getting to sleep a bit late. Not feeling that tired but I’m guessing it’s not the best for recovery. Decided I would eat breakfast at the Big Meadows Campground so packed up and left. 


Today was the first day I had any real foot issues. Was wearing the Injinji hiking toe socks and was getting a hot spot on my big toe. Stopped and tried twice to solve the problem before finally switching the right foot sock to the Farm to Feet which had been my sleep socks. 


I hiked with Traipse briefly, a NOBO LASH (Long Ass Section Hiker) but I ended up hiking most of the day by myself. That was similar to yesterday but with the foot problems and the building heat felt like the first day I really had to work hard for the miles. 


I have not had the opportunity to eat at the Shenandoah Waysides yet. Most of the full restaurants open in June but some of the other’s like Big Meadows have lunch and dinner options. Apparently the wayside’s have famous milkshakes. I was looking forward to the Skyland Resort and getting a milkshake but unfortunately they don’t serve them. Ran into Orchid who was getting a shuttle ride back to Small Axe Hostel. 



The original plan was to do another 6ish miles to the next shelter and then nero into Luray, VA. However with the heat and foot issues I was tempted back to the hostel by Orchid promising good food, shower, laundry, and a cold creek to sit in.
Once we got back to Elkton took a shower and did laundry at the outfitter and then headed back to the brewery. Once we were back at the hostel headed down to the creek to cool off some more. Had a really nice dinner on the porch with all the guests and the hostel family. Was quite breezy overnight so temperatures were quite nice.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651516,"We all woke up at 5:10 to get an early start to beat the heat. Got breakfast to go from the hostel (4 hard boiled eggs, sausage, chocolate banana nut bread and fruit) and got picked up at 6 by Wayne our shuttle driver. Orchid and I were dropped off at the Skyland Resort about 7. 



The plan was to do about 10 miles to Thornton Gap before noon when Alison from the Open Arms Hostel was picking up Grass, Sam and Frodo. Orchid was my caboose all day as I have a more consistent up and down pace. We ended up on the windy side of the ridge for much of the day so the heat wasn’t too bad in the morning. There were a number of really nice views looking into the valley and the Massanutten Mountains spaced throughout the day. Not as many wildflowers today. The heat started really building for the last 2-3 miles and we ended up on the wind shadow side of the ridge. Up at elevation there are still one or two species of trees that are not fully leafed out. As a result the top of the ridge is still very exposed to the sun. Took the side trail to Mary’s Rock and then descended into Thornton Gap. That trail was crowded with day hikers and was easily the most people I’ve seen in the park. It was also the longest sustained descent as well. Got to the pickup point about 2 minutes before the shuttle.
Got some Mexican takeout for lunch and dinner and stopped at the local brewery with Orchid. Currently sitting in the Hostel A/C still recovering from the day (definitely feeling the heat) and working on the plan for next week. Looks like if all goes well I’ll be in Harpers Ferry next weekend. Two dogs and three cats at the hostel. 


Currently the plan is to Slackpack 10 miles from Rattlesnake Overlook back to Thornton Gap Sunday before the heat and stay at the Hostel again

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651621,"Slept pretty good last night in a real bed and pillow. Shared a room with 3 others who where pretty quiet. Ate breakfast and then headed out on the shuttle to Rattlesnake Overlook along with Orchid and Pancake. My plan today was to do an easy 10 miles Southbound (SOBO) while making progress northbound (NOBO). Today was my turn to tempt Orchid as she was originally planning to zero but decided to accompany me. I borrowed a day pack from the hostel which was a sparkly unicorn pack which had my Duckie attached to it. 


As it turned out the only view of the day was at the drop off point. The rest of the time we were enclosed in the woods with only the occasional glimpse of the valley through the trees. I did see a turtle and Lady Slipper which are a rarity. The trail was relatively easy and we finished at noon. 


One of the best things about going in the opposite direction is that you run into people that you have lost track of whether they were in front or behind you. Ran into
Water Break and Tick Magnet along with Fire Bug (Bill) who are slacking the park. Then Fancy Pants along with Pumpkin and Dad Joke who are section hiking and got some good jokes. And finally Pilgrim and Ted (who lost Bill from their excellent adventure) from night one. 


I had resupplied last night and spent some of the afternoon going over food and where we are going and getting rid of some extra food. I’m carrying out 9 lbs of food for 4 days but should not need food that last night. 


Big storm rolled through about dinner time and combined with the heat and time I’ve been out was happy for the short day today.  Should hit mile 100 tomorrow and leave Shenandoah park as well. Looks like about 13-14 miles per day again week with possibly a big day into Harpers Ferry.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651732,"Woke up an hour before the alarm this morning and couldn’t get back to sleep. Ended up watching a video on the bear situation in NJ/NY where they have closed some shelters again this year. Finished packing up with a four day resupply of 9+ lbs of food and pack is up over 28lbs again. 


We got a shuttle back to the Rattlesnake Overlook and started NOBO again today. Right off the bat we climbed but today we were rewarded with a lot of views all day long. Despite a bunch of ups and downs the trail tread was really good again today with mostly soft packed dirt most of the day. 


We were passed by Never Better a couple miles into the day and shortly before we had our first interesting trail encounter. Orchid had recently taken over the lead when we turned the corner and saw a tarp camp with American flag setup by the top of South Mt Marshal that was clearly not a hiker camp. Orchid commented that this was the kind of thing that would freak her out if she was by herself. We didn’t see anyone and headed past to the overlook, which had nice really views. Returning to AT from the overlook I saw a woman and did my typical Hey, how are you today greeting which was returned with a spew of coordinates and a endless outburst of stuff involving the supreme court. It was obvious she had problems of some sort so we pushed on and she was still going as we passed out of earshot. We alerted SOBO hikers and they already knew so it looks like Never Better also woke the bear. Apparently the park service is aware and dealing with but supposedly they only have 2 officers in the park today. 


We ate lunch on top if North Mt Marshall and then descended down to the Jenkins Gap Trail where I crossed over 100 miles so far. Made up a little marker and took some pictures to mark the occasion. We ended up taking a detour to a rock formation that was somewhat interesting but probably not worth it. Another couple of miles after that we exited Shenandoah National Park. The park has been an excellent start to the journey. 


On the decent into the Tom Floyd Shelter it started to drizzle however I was able to get the tent setup before it got any heavier. The shelter has a big overhang so easy to cook while dry. Right now it’s still very light drizzle. 


Looking at a 13 or 18 mile day tomorrow. Felt good today so we’ll see. The shelter in 13 miles has bad reviews and the one in 18 miles is relatively new

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652011,"Got more sleep than I have been getting last night. Listened to the rain pattering on the tent all night. With the humidity and moisture you give off everything inside the tent ended up slightly damp. Hopefully that won’t be an issue tonight. Packed up the tent and then headed up to the shelter to cook under the overhang. Again another long pack up although I think a bunch of that was eating. 



There was a steady light rain all morning despite it supposed to stop early morning. It was weather only a duck could love. Was wearing rain pants and jacket but was definitely sweating as well. Trail was sloppy mud in places but otherwise generally was in good condition. Several good climbs today but not really any views although we did end up going through several pretty meadows.
We picked up Pilgrim coming out of Front Royal and hiked with him as well for most of the day. Both Orchid and Pilgrim fell during the day. I slipped on wet boards but didn’t fall. Very glad for the trekking poles al day long. 


Stopped at the Jim and Molly Denton shelter for a respite from the rain and to eat the first half of lunch. Stopped raining shortly after we stopped. 


Took a long rest at the Manassas Gap Shelter and had second half of my lunch. Decided that I’m feeling pretty good and pushed on to the next shelter 4.5 miles away. Started raining again as we rested. 


Whiskey Hollow shelter is relatively new and very nice double decker shelter with an extended overhang covering a picnic table. Catchup was here when we got there and there is now wet muddy gear hanging everywhere. I’m in the shelter tonight. Just the four of us so pretty roomy. 


Current plan is 18 to Bears Den and then 20 to Harpers Ferry.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652012,"Apparently there was a very prolific mouse and maybe squirrel at the shelter. Several people had an acorn in one of their shoes and Orchid had her fleece eaten in several places. Found out the next day from Big Hungry that the same thing happened to him the night before. 


Rain was supposed to stop early in the morning but kept going until lunchtime. The trail was still pretty muddy and as a result either the rain pants, regular pants or your socks and legs get covered in mud. Tactical error in starting out with the convertible legs on as they were wet and muddy and they are one aspect of staying warm on cold nights. 


Got some nice trail magic about 2 hours into the day. Cooler with gatorade and soda and bin full of a big variety of snacks. 


Stopped at two shelters today where I had a first and second lunch. Tried to dry socks at lunch but without sun it doesn’t really work. 


Trail was very lush and forested for most of the day. No real views and not as many wildflowers. 


Entered the area known as the Rollercoaster. It’s an area about 14 miles long with numerous 500ish PUDS (pointless ups and downs). Some weren’t so bad while others were pretty steep and tough. Pilgrim tends to drop back on the climbs and catch back up on the decent but today we dropped him. Orchid had a couple minute head start after a water gather and pee break. Usually I can catch back up in a couple of minutes but the last two climbs into the hostel were tough and it took almost 3.5 miles to catch her. 


Bears Den Hostel is in a converted summer estate now owned by the ATC. $35 for a bunk, shower, laundry, pizza and pint of ice cream. 5 bunk beds are in the basement first come first served and I managed to get the last lower bunk. Big Hungry and Fern were at the hostel, none of whom I expected to meet up with again. Sparkles x2 was also there having finished his aqua blaze (canoe from Luray to near Harpers Ferry) VA. Managed to get the tent drier and most of the other wet and muddy items washed.

One of the first things was a road crossing of a busy 4 lane divided highway. Waited about 4 minutes before making the mad dash across. 


Orchid and I have run through family, favorite’s, etc so to pass the time today we started singing made up songs which soon morphed into me making up limerick’s for most of the day. For example:

There once were some hikers with DuckieWho counted themselves really quite luckyHis lim-ricks were swellAnd went down really wellAnd made the day a little less sucky


Had one view in the morning, some new wildflowers and some extended fields of blooming blackberry. Otherwise today was the first time I felt like I was just pushing miles. The morning climbs weren’t too bad. We caught up with Sunshine and Daisy (Daughter & Mother) and hiked with them for a while until lunch. 


Mid day the trail was really nice with mostly dry packed dirt and we were able to make good time. Towards the end of the day, the last 3ish miles, the trail got significantly more rocky. Ran into Catch-up who is doing the four state challenge (VA, WV, MD, and PA - 42 miles in 24 hours). No views of Harpers Ferry on the way down into town. The overlook was a mile plus on a side trail and there was a bear siting there as well. 


Entered my second state today - WV and will soon be in MD as WV is the shortest state. Orchid hit the 300 mile mark today.

Pack is back up to about 30 lbs with food and water. 


Today Pilgrim left first. We had a short hike until we got to the historic part of Harpers Ferry were the AT actually goes through the town. Once we caught up to Pilgrim on the climb to Weverton Cliff’s we all hiked together for the rest of the day. Took the side trail to the cliffs which overlook the Potomac. Saw Cholula at the cliffs. 


Stopped for a rest break at the Ed Garvey Shelter were we saw Grass who is hiking with his father for a couple of days. Coming down into Gathland State Park we found some trail magic. A church group had burgers, dogs, fruit, snacks, dessert, and a variety of med stuff. Had a burger and a bunch of fruit. There is a downside to trail magic in that you don’t get to lighten the pack. 


Climbed (of course) out of Gathland where we started getting the Mt Laurel again. They were just starting open and should be in full bloom in a day or two. Took a break at the second view today. Most of the day was in the green tunnel. Found some mushrooms today but not many wildflowers. 


Camping in the Rocky Run Shelter tonight with the other Thru hikers. Hopefully no mouse issues. Probably should have figured out a way to bring a good mousing cat. It’s Memorial Day weekend and the campsites are packed with section and overnight campers. A bunch of day hikers have a campfire going and hopefully won’t be up too late.

Walking into the Washington Monument State Park there was breakfast trail magic hosted by a couple from Ohio. Eggs, biscuits and gravy, hash browns, bacon, coffee,and snacks. It was only about 1.5 hours after breakfast but I was able to eat a hash brown and some bacon. Leaving there we climbed the monument and got some nice views down into the valley. 


A bunch of miles later we started the climb up to Annapolis rock and then Black rock cliffs. Got some nice views and believe we could see Hagerstown. Annapolis rock has a Mcafee Knob style outcrop. Ate lunch up at the top. 


Leaving lunch we had about 5 miles to go and about 2.5 miles from camp we caught up with some college kids who were out “just doing the MD miles” of the AT and hiked with them into camp singing songs and telling jokes to pass the time on the rocky trail. 


Homeless person at the Ensign Cowell shelter when we finally arrived but they moved on about 30 minutes after we arrived. Besides the three if us there are a whole slew of Thru Hiker’s here tonight. Relish, Play by Play, Sockmonkey, Cholula, Weebles, Chum, and Grass and his dad. Privy was awarded Shittiest Shitter of 2022 so that will be interesting in the morning. Slept in the shelter last night. 


Tentative plan is Hostel on Tuesday but we might also follow Relish and Play by Play for slightly longer days which may make the Hostel a quick resupply point rather than an overnight.

Climbed up to the High Rock Ledge which was also exactly were I crossed the 200 mile mark. Made my sign and did the photo op and then downed the celebratory Papa John brownie. After that we entered a long period of very rocky trail on our way to Pen Mar Park. We’d heard there was an ice cream truck there on Sunday and were looking forward to having an ice cream but unfortunately no trucks there today. Crushing blow to everyone as the heat was building. 


After the park we had a 1/4 mile walk in the sun to the Mason Dixon line where we crossed into PA, completing my second state. 


After that was pretty much a green tunnel day with ups and downs although the Mt Laurel is still blooming. It seems to grow in clomps so you’ll get nothing and then a ton. 


Got to 86 on trail and we were stopping at every creek to cool off. Coming into Old Forge park was evidence of tons of blow downs and some new bridges from storms a couple of years ago. The PATC actually relocated one of their shelters due to flooding from the storm. 


Tumbling run Shelters (snoring and non snoring) are super well maintained and have a covered picnic table with flowers, privy with TP, and a cold creek to soak your feet in which we absolutely dis. I could only stand about 2 minutes per foot before having to switch. Tenting tonight as looked like the bugs could be an issue. Heat building but should be a short day into the hostel and a needed resupply. 


Relish, Play By Play, and Cholula came into camp late and Cholula reported that Sparky (who left Pen Mar Park 30 minutes before us) had broken his foot somewhere after and was off trail. Not sure how he got off as we didn’t see him.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652294,"Slept pretty good last night. Seemed like there might be mosquitoes out so happy with the tent decision and kept the rain fly open all night for ventilation. Up, eaten, packed up and out of camp by 7. Naturally there was a climb straight out of camp up to Chimney Rock which was the only view of the day although the Mt Laurel is blooming which is really nice. 


Terrain varied from soft dirt to small boulder fields and after the initial climb not to bad with climbs. Short day today to get into the Trail of Hope hostel for a resupply and to beat the heat. This is near Caledonia State Park where we car camped a lot back in the day. 


Got a ride to the Walmart for a resupply, pizza place for lunch, and a chocolate milkshake at DQ from the reverend. Did laundry and shower as well and planned the next couple of days. Sheila tested positive for Covid (she’s doing good) so this weekend’s visit was pushed back a week. 


Hostel is full tonight with several camping outside. Besides Orchid, Pilgrim and Sockmonkey there is Sunshine, Survivor, Gandolph are three older Thru hikers (2 are women). Yogi, Chewy, and the four new Thru hikers that just started at Harpers Ferry Sam, Sean, Hayden, Jason.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652504,"Real beds are nice even if many hostels don’t believe in top sheets. Up at 5:30 and out the door at 6:30. The Reverend was kind enough to give us a ride to the trail head. Apparently God is with him as he doesn’t believe in seatbelts. 


Entered Caledonia State Park where Dad, Jen and I went camping several times when we were young. AT goes through the day use area which is not far from the pool. I really don’t remember much of the park. Figure we probably hiked some of the AT but don’t know. Naturally immediately after the picnic area was a steep climb marked most difficult by the park. 


No views today but the Mt Laurel were very thick in spots throughout the day although in varying state of bloom from fully open to just starting to bud. Walked through the first pine forest of the trip and it smelled amazing. Leapfrogged Sunshine, Survivor, and Gandolph for much of the day. We crossed the official halfway mark 1097.15 at the same time as them. I’d packed in some mint brownies for Pilgrim to mark the occasion and so all four that hit the mark got some trail magic. Less than 3 miles later they also crossed the 1100 mile mark. 


Temperatures were not too bad at this point but it had been mostly shady. However after that the final stretch to the shelter had limited tree covering and it immediately felt way hotter. Was definitely feeling the heat as it was mid afternoon. This shelter is also right by a stream, which is also ice cold, and there are camp chairs here. Spent much of the late afternoon sitting in the creek with the feet in the water. Storm warning but skies are still clear. 


A Potomac AT Club Ridgerunner  named Teflon and her trainer are here tonight. We walked up much of Annapolis Rock trail with her. Captain Crunch, Happy (FlipFlop from HF), and Domino Thunder are here as well. Sockmonkey didn’t make it today so we’re back to the three Duck-keteer’s. Another hiker with a bad reputation, that tented at the hostel, fortunately pushed on so we don’t need to deal with him tonight and hopefully he gets out of sync with us. 


Staying with family Thursday night. Then two nights in a hostel with a Slackpack day on Saturday, to work around an 18 mile no camping stretch due to narrow corridor in urban area. That will get us to Duncannon PA in 2 not 3 days.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652505,"The shelter is about 4 miles away from Pine Grove Furnace State Park which is home to the half gallon ice cream challenge. Only ate a small breakfast at camp and then headed out. We got there before they opened and hung out waiting with Sunshine and Survivor until 9. I’m about 1/10 of the way so I tried the 1/10 gallon challenge which was quickly defeated and had a really good breakfast sandwich. Survivor was working on the her first container when we left. With a scheduled pickup time we didn’t do the museum.
Nice flat trail through the park. Leaving the park we had a long climb up and then we took a side trail up to Pole Steeple, a rocky outcrop which had some nice views. 


Leaving there we headed for the pickup at Rt 94 from my cousin Karen who lives in Carlisle PA and was gracious enough to host the three of us. She has hiked and volunteered at a Camino in Spain and has a daughter in law (Rock Monkey) who hiked the AT several years ago. We were able to help celebrate her Mother Joan’s 90th birthday. They took us out to eat and to the grocery store for resupply. Had a really nice visit and got to catch up with family. An awesome time was had by all - thank you Karen!

Dropped back off at Rt 94. All of the elevation gain for the day was in the first half. Some fun little rock climbs but no views. Saw the original halfway point mt plaque. Nothing remarkable about the trail this morning. The Mt Laurel continued but was not as dense. Leapfrogged Oz for much of the morning. 


Got into Boiling Springs which starts the long section with no camping. Ate lunch at Cafe 101 which was pleasant. Most of the afternoon was hiking through fields, along fields, or in a narrow strip of woods between fields. Pretty flat afternoon and was shady for the most part. The honeysuckle was out in full force - quite strong smell. 


Got a shuttle from Rt 11 overpass into Duncannon, PA where we are at the Kind of Outdoorsy Hostel. Only Joy is here tonight. We’ll get a shuttle back to Rt 11 and Slackpack tomorrow for a break. Tomorrow we’ll also resupply for the next 4 day stretch into Port Clinton. Spent a while trying to figure out where to camp but not settled yet.

Got picked up at 8 by the shuttle driver and was on the trail by about 8:40. Fortunately the trail is much more direct than the roads. About 20 minutes into the day the 3 of us passed a Mennonite farm selling fresh strawberries, veggies, and ice cream. We quickly downed a quart of strawberries- my first of the season. Ice cream was considered but passed up in the end. 


Immediately after crossed over 81 and started the first of several meadow walks. Lots of wildflowers blooming and we saw our first monarch butterflies. We hiked along the Conodoquinet stream for a while and saw a muskrat swimming in the water. 


We got two nice views during the afternoon. One overlooked the Susquhana River as we did the steep decent into town. Orchid and I pushed to get back to the outfitter before they closed. We ran into Relish, Play by Play, and Big Hungry at the outfitter and went out to dinner with them. Also saw Catchup and talked briefly about his successful 4 state challenge. After dinner Pilgrim and I did resupply at the grocery store about 3/4 miles away while Orchid did laundry. Back and started putting away food, foot soak, journal, and shower. 


Fighting WIFI so hopefully get some uploads.  For such a simple lifestyle it’s hard to explain how busy a town day feels. 9:45 and just starting uploads. Plan is four day push into Port Clinton / Hamburg for resupply

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652725,"We had decided on an 8AM start. Most of the hostel was asleep by 8:15 and didn’t wake up until after 7. I was up late journaling and putting away food and spent time in the morning working on my backpack pocket for the vertical stays. The stay wore a hole through the pocket and I was using part if s bottle cap as a temporary field repair. So far seems to be just holding. I ended up leaving about 39 minutes after Orchid and Pilgrim. Forget to mention that Pancakes was also at the hostel- we last saw him at Open Arms hostel. He hiked out with a section hiker Mike that Orchid and i hiked with yesterday and we never caught them. 


Today had a 12 mile water cary to avoid a long steep decent to a spring. Combined with 4 days of food the pack was significantly heavier and it felt like it as well. 


Long walk through town and over the Junita snd Susquehanna Rivers. Fortunately the bridge’s had separated walking paths. Once out of town the trail immediately climbed. Things were good until close to the top when the rocks started, the poison ivy was growing rampant, and there were about a dozen big blowdown’s. Felt like almost as many blowdown’s during this stretch as in all of the past week. Also 2-3 times as many had been removed. I tried to wash legs but if I don’t get PI from today I don’t know how that was possible as it was everywhere today. 


We got some views back into town and over the Susquehanna today which was nice. Trail definitely got bit more rocky today- a preview of what’s to come at the end of PA. After the climb it was mostly a ridge walk. I hit the 300 mile mark a couple of miles outside of camp. 


We’re camped just short of a spring at some existing tent sites. Mostly flat so that’s good and we have water. We’re on the push to Port Clinton/ Hamburg where we’re planning to take the first zero in a long while. The shelter’s didn’t work out well for a four day schedule so we’re primarily looking at tent sites.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652726,"Woke up in the middle of the night slightly cool so added the fleece. Around 4 I woke up and added socks and zipped up the bottom of the sleeping bag. Otherwise it was great sleeping weather getting down to 52 last night. Despite an early wake-up we got out of camp about 7:30, well behind our target. There was not alot of remarkable trail today. Most of the trail was really good with only a few spots of rocks. We know the rocky portion of PA is coming soon but so far it’s not fully here yet. Lots of rhododendron today but it’s not blooming yet. Some Mt Laurel is still blooming. One downside of the thicker understory is you really don’t see much off the trail. We had a partial view on the top of a Mt where there were lots of dead trees. Had a meadow walk again and spent time next to two different streams.
The biggest thing we were hearing about was the flooded trail from the beaver dam which even had a dry feet alternate. However it was a very short 30m section that was flooded and there was a plank and logs to use so didn’t get wet at all
We’re at a tent site again but this time it’s dry. And no water for 8 miles after. So we loaded up on water for replenish the day, dinner, breakfast, and the morning. Total of 13+ liters or 29 extra pounds of water for the three of us. Fortunately only need to carry most of it 0.6 miles. Probably not all will be needed but most will be drunk. 


Capital and Strongarm passed our campsite tonight. They were ahead of us after trail magic at Washington Monument so not sure how we got ahead. Sparkles (non binary), Sunshine and Daisy, Big Hungry, Relish and Play by Play are about 1/2 day ahead of us as we seem to be eating lunch where they are camping.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652727,"Slept pretty good last night even though you could hear I81 from camp. Only one pee break which was good considering I drank almost 2 liters in the evening. Someone came in and camped next to us and was out by 6 - I only noticed as the pee tree was no longer private. We were packed up and on the trail by 7:10 as rain was predicted starting at 2. Passed by Bovi who was camping just down the trail from us. 


Mostly flat to start until we passed the Swatara CreekWater Trail and Rail Trail and passed under I81. Then naturally a long climb and the start of a long ridge walk. We kept getting views throughout the day and we passed through extensive fern forested areas many times during the day. Definitely noticing an uptick in the rocks and I’d say over 1/2 of the trail today was rocky of some sort. The rocks are tiring both on your feet and mentally as you need to constantly focus on every step and therefore spend most of the time staring at the trail while occasionally glancing up. So let’s talk about rocks. I’ll classify them as to one of four types:
Dirt with rocks. Here the rocks tend to be less than volley ball sized and there is about 1/3 to 2/3 dirt. if you place your feet carefully you can pretty much walk in dirt although you will not be walking normally. Small rocks. Here the rocks are softball sized and typically completely cover the trail. Usually not too sharp and relatively uniform in size. They are typically not too bad to walk on. Medium rocks. Soccer ball sized rocks of all shapes and sizes often at an angle with sharp tops l. Typically almost cover the trail. Usually 2/3 of the time can step on a flatish rock. Must also pay attention to where you plant the hiking poles. These tend to be the worst as you are often on an angle or on sharp edge. Big rocks. 2 cubic feet and up of all shapes and sizes. Here it’s more of rock hopping and there is generally no specific path through them. Not all rocks are stable so that’s exciting. These can be fun or challenging depending on how they are shaped and how they stack
I’d say there were some 1/4 to 1/2 mile stretches where I didn’t step on dirt, only rocks. And if you believe the chatter it gets rockier further north in PA. 


Between first and second lunch we ran into trail magic from Tyke and Tagalong. This was the first time they had ever done trail magic and I got some fresh strawberries, other fruit, and some candy. Bovi and Joy showed up while we were there. With the impending rain we then skipped second lunch. This was a bad decision food wise as I was pretty hungry having finished all my snacks and flagging energy as we rolled into camp. 


We managed to get into camp just before the rain so skipping second lunch kept us iff wet rocks. This is the site of an old shelter that is no longer here. Many tent sites that are spread out over 1/4 mile of trail so it took a little time to determine where to setup. Started raining during setup but I had the tent mostly up at that point so the inside and all my stuff is dry. Supposed to stop for a while but only a very brief break in the rain to cook dinner, hang our food, and pee. Raining pretty steady (edit now hard) right now. It’s very humid so everything is sticky- the sleeping pad and bag really aren’t the best to sleep on in humid conditions. Camping by the stream so that’ll be a nice background noise tonight but it doesn’t drown out the road and truck noise . Thunderstorms predicted later tonight. Hopefully the tent stakes hold. 


ATC registered number 600 on June 5th. That’s 185 people in the 9 days since we were there. From what we can tell we are on the leading edge of the bubble.

Sleeping bad foot end was damp where it was pressed up against the tent edge. I think the tent is 84” but at almost 6’ and with the slope of the tent I basically almost touch at the head and feet. Under very humid conditions there is a significant amount of condensation that collects on the inside and potentially gets on the gear. 


We went down and checked out the swimming hole and rope swings ( three total) before we left camp. Water and air temperature was cold or we might have gone in. The three of us got on trail about 7.


Rocks weren’t as bad to start the day and had some good stretches of nice trail. More rocks towards the end of the day though. It’s really hard to predict as you’ll be cruising on nice dirt trail and turn a corner into a boulder field. Several sections of fern forest and many stretches of Mt Laurel again. Still in full bloom so we seem to be somewhat keeping pace with the season. Got a couple of views today although nothing really spectacular. Lots of pretty unremarkable stretches of trail as well. Didn’t see many people on the trail today except when we stopped for lunch.


I had to stop to work on my left big toe with about 2 miles to go. Was hurting but no obvious signs of hot spot or blister. Put on gobs of ointment and seemed to go better. Shortly after that the trail took a steep decent into town. Lots of big steps and many sections of small loose rocks that were super slippery. Slid a couple of times but no falls. Normally my left foot is the tall drop landing foot as my right ankle is definitely weaker. Switched up to the right foot with the toe issue which made the decent feel really weird. Saw a porcupine climbing a tree on the way down. 


At the bottom crossed over multiple railroad tracks. Looks like there is a old style train excursion that leaves from there. Shortly after that got picked up by our shuttle and brought to the hotel via WaWa for some food and a milkshake. Lots of hikers here although don’t know most of them. Oz and Bovi whom we’ve met before and chatted with Bumble Beast as well.Got a shower and laundry done before heading out to dinner.

Also reinforced the temporary repair to my backpack’s vertical load stay which had poked through the pocket.

We weren’t getting picked up until 7:45 so didn’t need to get up very early. I’d gotten French Toast for breakfast instead of the hotel breakfast which was basically oatmeal, cereal and bagels. Pilgrim’s friend was dropping us off at the trail. 


Naturally a pretty steep climb to get started but most of the rest of the day was a ridge walk. We got two nice views today at Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle. The Pinnacle overlooked rolling farms and was one of the best views we’ve had in a while. Unfortunately Pilgrim took a hard fall between the two views, landing hard on his arm. So far it seems that he has escaped serious injury although his upper arm is a bit swollen. 


Not too much noteworthy about the rest of the day. We did get some nice fern areas and Mt Laurel areas. We’re staying at the Eckville shelter which is an unusual one. It has a 6 person shelter and bunch of tenting sites. But there is also a caretaker that lives in a house on the property and a flush toilet and solar shower. Pilgrim’s friends from home Bob and Thornton and one of their friends Randy stopped by bringing WaWa subs and drinks. We had a good time talking about the trail. Pilgrim’s friends are hikers and have been around these parts as well as the Adirondacks. All in all a good visit.

One of the upsides of the hotel and hostel is that they typically have real pillows. So far I haven’t yet found a pillow that I really like for backpacking. Although I am getting pretty good sleep, I’m also definitely waking up every hour or two to flip over - way more than I do at home. It seems like pretty much no matter what time we wake up we seem to get out about 7 these days (well Orchid is ready before us). Pilgrim’s arm is definitely sore today but otherwise doesn’t seem to be badly injured. We got started and after a short warmup we had another climb to start the day although it wasn’t too bad of a climb. This started the ridge walk that we had for much of the day.


We got some nice views from Dan’s Pulpit and Balance rocks which looked back at the Pinnacle from yesterday, so we got to see the same valley from the opposite direction today. Shortly after that we met Ron and Pete (friends of mine I’ve know for decades now) who had bushwhacked and then climbed a pile of rocks to get a view to the other side of the ridge. They brought lunch from WaWa making this day 4 in a row. It was very nice to catch up with them and to share some of my experiences on the trail. We got them some good boulder hopping for sections of the trail, but otherwise the trail was not too bad today. However, more importantly we got them some good views from Knife’s Edge, Bear Rocks, and Bake Oven Knob. They got a copperhead sighting, which is my first poisonous snake this trip so far. Of the things that can kill you, I’m only missing the rattlesnake at this point.


Pete and Ron headed back to their car after Bake Oven Knob while we headed down yet another boulder field to the Bake Oven Knov shelter. This is an older, smaller, and not very tall shelter (I could barely kneel at the back end) which has a cutout in the floor making it almost like a U shape (lying flat part of my head was past the age if I wasn’t on the edge). It also has no privy which makes no sense to us especially given the rocky area that it is situated in. I did some catchup of stuff (non trip related) that has been pending for a while before bed. Spotted a mouse running around so we’ll see what happens overnight.

I never heard him arrive so not sure what that says about me hearing a bear or other animal wandering around outside of the shelter. Never heard the mouse either and no mouse damage to anyone’s stuff. While packing up we got a brief morning shower, fortunately all of our stuff was dry in the shelter but it did make some of the rocks slippery. Didn’t rain on a duck yet again. Today was a planned short day to a meetup point with family. Mrs Duckie and Mrs Pilgrim came for an overnight visit and Orchid is going to stay with Pilgrim’s family


We continued the ridge walk including crossing over the PA Turnpike Northeast extension as it goes through the Leigh tunnel. Unfortunately with the low cloud cover there we no views today and we didn’t even realize that we had passed over it. As with most towns we had a pretty good decent down to the Lehigh Gap and we’ll have a pretty good climb to start the day tomorrow.


Mrs Duckie and I grabbed lunch at a dinner and then checked into the hotel. This hotel has waffles - no oatmeal for me tomorrow!!! She brought up replacement shoes, some new camp shoes, as well as a bunch of other resupply items . I spent the afternoon sorting and trying stuff on to decide what to keep, doing laundry, grocery shopping, and generally not relaxing.

Woke up early but managed to get back to sleep. The hotel had a good breakfast with waffles, eggs, bacon which I took advantage of. While Mrs Duckie finished coffee, I went to drop off trail magic at the trail head. 


As I was crossing the Lehigh bridge I spotted Relish and Play by Play and was just able to give a quick shout before I passed them. Four hikers were there when I dropped off the stuff. Don’t think they believed I was a thru hiker at the time given the situation although I did pass them the next day and they also ran into the twins. I tried to catch the twins at the next parking lit to no avail. 


Back at hotel Mrs Duckie was sitting at a table next to Big Hungry and his son.  He’d been hiking with him for a few days. Very strange how things work on the trail. Also found out that apparently we’re now ahead of Sparkles, 53, and Harmony from my first days on trail. 


Said goodbye to Mrs Duckie and headed across the Lehigh and the most technical climb of far. Ended up being a big climb with great views. We didn’t realize the AT didn’t go over the top as there were some better views possible if you climbed up to the top of Blue Mt Ridge. After that was an exposed ridge walk with many views. This part of the trail was newly relocated to avoid some remediation as part of a superfund cleanup of an old Zinc mining operation. 



This is a long dry section and I was carrying 4 liters but was starting to run low when we came across Philly Cheese (2021 thru hiker) doing trail magic by Blue Mountain Rd. The trail passes very close to the ski resort but we didn’t spot any of the ski trails. Newly rejuvenated I cruised right on past the 400 mile mark so the official 400 mile photo happened a bit later.
We made it to Smith Gap road and the pickup point for the Curly goose tent hostel with plenty of time to spare. It’s a new hostel and they are still working out some kinks. Camping on a narrow strip of grass between a nice creek and field for goats and sheep. Got into camp after 7:30 and it was almost 9:15 before finished everything and got into the tent.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653078,"Slept really well last night. Didn’t hear the animals overnight and the creek was pleasant background noise. Despite late hour was up by 5:20 - downside of tents is that they are absolutely not dark in the morning. Despite the early wake-up was still ready just after 7. Can’t seem to get rolling earlier. We got a ride back to the trail from the hostel owner. 



The rocks started almost immediately and never relented until the last mile. Can’t really tell you much of the terrain as we spent the day looking down. We did get a respite of sorts with a quarter mile of boulder hopping at Wolf Rocks. Got some limited views during the day but many of them were overgrown and not very good.We passed by Wind Gap but decided not to head into town. Scavenger Princess and 3DM were eating pie as we went through and SP caught us and hiked with us for quite a bit. He’s been basically hiking since 2018 (AT, PCT, AZ, FL among others) and started doing the AT again intending to flip to the CDT in June but is now staying on the AT. Ang caught us later at a rest break and we hiked with her for a long while as well. 


About 3/4 mike before camp passed Big Hungry napping and then Relish and Play by Play at the road crossing with family. They’re here tonight as well. We’re tenting and there are tents scattered over a very large area. This is another odd shelter with piped water provided by a private retreat and all sorts of communication towers in close proximity. Also can tell we are getting back into civilization as we’re under the flight path for NY and hearing airplanes most of the afternoon and evening. Wondering if the towers are related to ATC. 


We can basically almost smell the Delaware River and assuming all goes well I’ll be sleeping in NJ tomorrow. Rocks continue in NJ but they do get better.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653079,"Spent the night slowly sliding in the tent due to the slanted tent site. Had a big group that camped on the road above us that had a fire and were pretty loud until 9:30 or so. Found out later that there was a big field we could have camped in. Oh well. Out by 7(naturally) even though trying for earlier. 


PA gave us some views and portions of nice trail for the last couple of miles before the decent into Delaware Water Gap. Once in town we headed to the outfitter but they seem to have switched over to more of a river canoe company. Walked down to the Apple Pie Cafe and got a delicious second breakfast sandwich - sausage and egg on french toast. Popped into a gas station setup for hiker resupply to get food for the next stretch. Back at the cafe grabbed two pastries for later and a scoop of ice cream to go and headed to the I80 bridge and took a hop to the left into NJ. Ran into many of the 8+ Harpers Ferry flip flopers that were at the shelter last night. 


Once in NJ we had s long climb up to the ridge and Sunfish pond were we took a break. Frogs and tadpoles galore and the shoreline was covered in blooming Mt Laurel. Of course walking around the pond was on a boulder field. We got some more views including a 360 two state view. NJ has slightly better terrain than PA in the beginning but there are still rocks… just not quite as many or for as long. Headed to the AMC Mohican camp to spend the night in one of their bunkhouses. Got a shower and did some sink laundry. Another thru hiker and his section hiking wife and three Mennonite (?) young women as well. Probably a shorter day tomorrow but we’ll see.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653498,"Woke up a little bit later today as we anticipated rain overnight ending in the morning. After packing up we headed to the AMC lodge to take advantage of the WIFI and get some updates posted. Looking at the weather seemed like it would end shortly after 8 but didn’t stop until 8:40. At that point it was very close to the store opening at 9 so we stuck around so Orchid and Pilgrim could have an ice cream second breakfast. I ended up eating the sandwich I bought when we checked in. By the time we started it wasn’t raining but the trail and bushes were pretty wet. Gaming the system yet again so it doesn’t rain on a duck. 


We got to the Catfish Fire tower when it was still foggy out. We found out that Smiley, Blondie and Sojourner (the three Amish young ladies that stayed at the AMC with us last night) and are also at the shelter tonight got to the fire tower an hour later and had good views. However we did have some really nice views throughout the day although the best ones were towards PA. Trail continues to improve overall although there are still definitely rocky sections. It’s nice to be able to keep the head up and look around for a change. 


We’re starting to see some summer flowers blooming in places which is a nice change from mostly green although the Mt Laurel is still going strong. Also seeing dozens of the little red/orange newts. I always feel like I am about to step on them and they must feel like all these terrible things are falling from the sky. 


We got to the shelter at 5 and Bozo and Trot (also from AMC last night) were already in the shelter. For a brief period of time the 8 of us from last night were the only ones here but about a half dozen more have arrived. Chatted for a while at dinner with the Amish ladies. We’re doing the shelter to avoid some anticipated overnight rain and packing up wet tents. 


Today and the next couple of days recreate a hike I took with my sons back in 2014. We’re camping at similar shelters as the previous trip. I remember some of the terrain and features but not all. Regardless it feels like coming full circle as that was one of the first longer hikes I had ever done and was in the time frame that the dream of hiking the AT first took hold. 


PS. Forgot to mention that I weighed myself on our scale Sunday and was 167.0 which is down 4.5 lbs since start of trail.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653499,"No rain overnight despite the weather forecast. With the five of us in the shelter was bit crowded and it’s always a bit noisier than the tent. Packed up and on the road shortly after 7. We were aware of planned trail magic midday so had something to look forward to. Day was already starting out very humid and we were all sweating early even though wasn’t too hot yet. 


Coming out to 206 there used to be a Deli right off the trail but it’s closed now. Back in 2014 the boys and I got ice cream here. Instead we grabbed some cold drinks from a sports shop. Shortly after that we climbed to the top of the ridge and the Culver Fire Tower. Orchid and I climbed up for the views which were really good. Blondie passed us while we were at the fire tower but Smiley and Sojourner hadn’t arrived by the time we left. 


At that point Sunrise Mt Pavilion and trail magic was about 3.5 miles away so we started the push there trying to get there by noon which we managed to do. Blondie, Leafblower and Leafblower’s leafblower were there - yes he is carrying a fully functioning leafblower which has its own trail name and entry in shelter logs. Strawberries, veggies, fruit, chips and a drink were quickly consumed. Blondie and Sojourner arrived and we got a group photo with the three Amish ladies. Pizza showed up and was instantly consumed by the dozen people there. As we were leaving fresh bagels arrived and I couldn’t turn that down. 


Heading out, Blondie caught up with us and we ended up hiking with her until we all took a break at the next shelter. Smiley and Sojourner caught up with us and we ended up chatting for a while at the shelter before heading out. We hiked together for a while before we dropped off the end as we were going to Rutherford shelter and they were pushing on to High Point shelter. 


At the Rutherford shelter I scouted out an unofficial tent site at the top of the ridge about .5 miles north which had some great views east and likely nice sunrise. However when Orchid and I went to get water by the shelter it was barely flowing and Orchid was not particularly happy with the quality. We decided then to push on to High Point. Unfortunately for Pilgrim, he had been telling Orchid how much he liked these shorter days where you didn’t have to worry the last mile or so about getting into camp. At this point looking at an 7 PM arrival. Oops. The trail end up being very rocky the whole way to the High Point Office. Just missed the office which sells candy, drinks and some hiker resupply. I grabbed some water and ate some of my dinner before Orchid and I headed out. The three Amish ladies had gone into the office and worked on their pickup for tomorrow so they were still at the office when we left. They caught us at the observation platform looking up at the High Point Monument and we all hiked together the last mile into camp.There is a NJ Ridge Runner named Stretch here tonight and we chatted with her and the ladies for a while after setting up camp. Leafblower is here along with several other hikers we’ve sheltered with before. Ended up finishing dinner after dusk and taking a quick rinse off in the stream after dark. Checked out hotels for Sunday as well so was a late night.The longer day today just means a shorter day tomorrow as the shelter’s don’t line up well.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653501,"Although we were trying to get out this morning about the same time, despite the short day, we ended up delayed to make hotel reservations for Sunday night (shower, laundry and resupply) and an unexpected privy stop. Prior to leaving we said our goodbyes to Smiley, Blondie and Sojourner who finished their 11 day trip and are heading home but not before going to the High Point Beach. It was great to hike with them and hear about their adventures and how their culture impacts them and their travels. 


Almost immediately after starting the trail changed from the rocks that have been prevalent since Duncannon PA to smoother trail. We also started the first of many meadow sections today. After staring at your feet all day long the change of pace is nice and the meadow is a nice change from the same old woods. 


We headed into Unionville, NY for a first lunch and a small resupply at the General Store. Had an egg salad sandwich (and 2 hash browns, muffin, banana and black cherry soda) which was really good. Debated ice cream but it was really windy and cloudy so we were all bundled up on the porch and came to the conclusion it was too cold out. LeafBlower showed up as well as Blood Beard and Beats from the Brink shelter. 


After lunch we went through series of Puncheons (wooden boardwalks ) through various swamps. Nice but they can be slippery when wet. However the longer Pochuck Boardwalk is tomorrow. We also walked around parts of the Wallkill National Wildlife Refugee which had a number of different kinds of birds. 



The shelter has no water so we got some at an abandoned building with a water spigot the National Park Service owns on the climb up to the shelter. Really windy and cold in the late afternoon. Ate dinner in the shelter with pants, fleece and windbreaker. First time I was unhappy I no longer had a stove as a hot meal would have been nice. Sun briefly popped out and winds are dying down this evening. Looks like I will be wearing most of my clothes tonight.
Long day tomorrow but shower, laundry and resupply along with a Mrs. Duckie visit. Tweaked right ankle on a rock today. It’s definitely swollen on the inside ankle but doesn’t hurt. We’ll see what happens tomorrow. Also sounds like someone is shooting off home fireworks for the last 20 minutes.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653503,"Was definitely a cold night last night dropping down to the upper 40s. I had almost everything I have on and was comfortable for the most part but definitely was waking up more if the quilt let in a draft.   However not as bad as NH as Mt Washington got snow and sleet last night. Got out of camp just about at 7 and immediately continued up the mountain. 


After a couple of miles we got to the Pochuck boardwalk which is a long raised boardwalk through a marsh. From what I can tell it has very good birding and is a popular day hike destination. After finishing it wasn’t much longer to a planned stop at Heaven Hill Farm which has a really good bakery. Luckily for us, Mrs Duckie was early and was able to meet the three if us at the farm market where we all enjoyed some ice cream and I got some apple cider donuts. We left the farm and unloaded gear to slackpack the remaining miles for the day. We headed out if the parking lit for the Stairway to Heaven and Pinwheel Vista which is a popular day hike destination and was busy with people. 


Just before we started the climb I spotted a black bear off to the right if the trail about 50m away. He was just minding his business looking for food. Was able to get a picture and start a video. As people started approaching from both directions the bear turned, chuffed at us, charged forward a couple of feet, and then turned and continued moseying around. We beat a hasty retreat up the trail to put some more distance between us. From what we could tell the bear had been there a while as many groups had seen it and there was possibly more than one. We finally made it up to the top and the great views looking back to High Point. 


Mrs Duckie had driven around to Wawayanda State Park and hiked south and we met her shortly before I reached 500 miles so I was able to celebrate that mark with her. We stopped at the shelter for lunch and caught the tail end of some trail magic but they didn’t have much left. 
 
A couple miles further we crossed into NY for the final time completing NJ, my fourth state. Almost immediately we started a challenging ridge walk where we got some views of NYC, some 38 miles away, and Greenwood Lake. Walking between the tall grass on either side of the trail I almost stepped on a snake which then tried to zip away and dropped off the ledge. Fortunately looked like a black snake. 


Today was Orchid and my first 20+ mile day and it felt like it. We got to the trail head about 6:40 where Mrs Duckie was waiting. Did a resupply at the Acme, got takeout pizza, drove to the hotel, ate and it was well after 9 before I even got to the room. Did some gear swap and additions and worked on putting everything away and was close to 11 before I got to bed.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653670,"As I write this I am listening to a Whip-poor-will, probably the loudest most annoying bird known to man. (Edit at 4:20 in the morning there was another very annoying and very loud bird that is a close second. It woke me up but I’m not sure what this one was).
Sheila drove us down to Route 17A and started the hike up to the overlook with us.  She got to the overlook about 1 mile in and then we said our goodbyes and she turned around and headed back to the car. After that It was rather uneventful until we got to Trail Magic hosted by a trio filling in for Glenn who does this every Monday during the hiking season just west of Harriman State Park. He did a thru hike in 2017 and is giving back to the community this way. They had a full kitchen going with hamburgers, hotdogs, sausage and chicken wings. They had served pancakes and eggs for breakfast earlier in the day. Unfortunately they had gotten more people than expected so they had run out of soda and Gatorade. 
We were able to refill our water from the water cash  at the road crossing and then headed out for the push towards Harriman. We came down Agony Grind and then crossed over I87. As we entered the Elk Pen lot we saw more trail magic from Swamp Irish and Sugar Gal, a couple from Louisiana that thru hiked last year. We were running low on water again so we were glad to be able to refill our water bottles as the water sources in Harriman are not great in the summer. I also got some snack food from them as well.
Climbed out of the lot and headed towards the lemon squeezer, which is a tight trail through a gap in the rocks. Immediately after is a fun little rock face climb which we did without packs -we passed the packs up. Then we made the final push towards Fingerboard shelter. The water sources before the shelter were either dry or barely flowing and although we got water it wasn’t the best. Fortunately we have enough for dinner and the plan is to head down to Tiorati Circle for breakfast. 
I have carried out two pints of NJ Blueberries and Orchid and I shared one pint of blueberries. Saw Chum, Weebles and Cholula at the shelter and gave them the 2nd pint of blueberries.  As I was falling asleep I thought I heard something playing with the bear cables. However it’s possible it’s just another hiker that came in late as all the bear bags were still intact in the morning and Orchid’s bear can stashed nearby hadn’t been touched.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653671,"Slept reasonably well last night but the tent was on a distinct slant and I kept sliding towards the foot of the tent. Each time I woke up I had to slide myself back to the other side. The plan was to do a snack in the morning before starting and then head to Tiorati Circle for breakfast and flush toilets. We got started roughly similar to the other days taking into account the detour down to the park.
Not too much notable for the next couple miles until we got to a view of the New York City skyline, although it was very hazy out and the skyline was hard to see. Following that we headed down for a while until we got to the temporary detour that the New York New Jersey trail conference has put in place to avoid a major road crossing of the Palisades Parkway. However since it was about 11 o’clock on a Tuesday we estimated that the traffic would be light and we decided to continue on the AT itself and across the parkway, especially as there was water on the other side of the parkway. As expected traffic was light and it was easy to cross. We didn’t even have to wait to cross.
Following that there were two big climbs with a long descent in between until we were on top of Bear Mountain by the Perkins Memorial Tower. No concession stand, but there was ice cream and soda vending machines. We all had ice cream and drinks. I climbed up the tower, which is probably 50 feet tall, and took a video but I’m sure it’s not gonna come out very well. After a long break we headed down the very popular trail the trail conference redid a number of years ago and put in over 1000 stone steps. Hung out briefly as Mr. Orchid was coming at five and we had a little bit of time to wait. 
When we got to the zoo it was after the posted closing time and we had also seen an alert that said that the zoo was closed Monday through Friday for construction. So rather than heading towards the zoo to see if it was open and then backtracking, we just took the bypass trail around the zoo. However when we got to the other end the gate looked open so maybe we could have gone through the zoo. 
Immediately after the zoo was a treacherous road crossing to get across 202 to the sidewalk side of the Bear Mountain Bridge during rush hour. We had to wait for high-speed traffic on one side to clear and then stop traffic on the other  backup up side to get across. Turned out to be much worse of a road crossing than the Palisades Parkway with much shorter site lines. We then crossed the bridge which spans the Hudson river where we met Mr. Orchid. 
We’re planning to stay in Fahnestock State Park campground for the next three nights. We will be doing a series of slackpack‘s while Orchid‘s husband, sister (and family) all visit. Pilgrim and I have a nice site off the road not too far from the bathroom that we will stay in the whole time. On the way to the campground we stopped at ShopRite and Chipotle for a resupply and dinner. A burrito bowl goes down really quickly even after two apple turnovers and a banana.
By the time we got done eating, setting up camp, and taking a shower it was already 930 and much later than I had hoped to go to bed. I am definitely tired and I had a lot of aches and pains today that I haven’t had yet on trail. Bottoms of both feet are definitely a more sore than usual. However, left knee has given me some pangs during the day, and every now and then I got a twinge in my right hip. So I feel like a little bit of a hot mess right now. Fortunately nothing really appears swollen so I think it’s just the weight of the pack and the big elevation gain compared to the last couple days. Fortunately we will be slackpacking tomorrow so I will have much less weight on the feet and legs and some shorter days ahead.
The last couple days we’ve been getting into camp later than usual and I am definitely behind in journaling and Instagram and uploading files. I also haven’t had a lot of cell service at camp either recently which hasn’t helped. Many times I’m starting a journal entry and then finishing it later the next day. Hopefully I’ll get caught up this weekend when I have a double zero for a family vacation.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653672,"Definitely was a humid night last night with some rain and everything in the tent is slightly damp. Fortunately I get to put on clean clothes this morning. Campground is pretty empty so it’s nice and quiet although we can hear the Taconic Parkway which is very close.  
We got dropped off at the Bear Mountain Bridge to start our day and started a short road walk until we climbed up to the ridge and the intersection to Anthony’s Nose (which appears to be a popular day hike). The morning trail was quite nice and very different from the Bear Mt / Harriman trails. With the fog and humidity everything was wet and the green of the forest seems to really pop.  
Today there was a deli right at the trail as it crossed the road. We stopped and I got a 10” ham, egg and cheese hero. I had intended to only eat half but was unable to stop and finished the whole thing for second breakfast. 
We had one view looking over the valley but it was fairly hazy. We’re seeing all sorts of rock walls in the forests. Some are just piled up rocks, but others are meticulously built walls with near vertical walls that are still in great shape. There have been a surprising number of them today. I’d love to get the history of some of these walls. Otherwise there was not much noteworthy today. Terrain has been better than the beginning of NY though. 
Orchid’s family walked out to meet us as we approached the pickup point. Her nieces were so excited to see her again and we walked back to the road crossing as a group. Everyone cleaned up and we headed out to dinner at a local Brewery. Food was tasty but the service was very slow. On the way home we stopped for the obligatory ice cream. By the time we got back to camp it was already well after 9 and we were all dragging quite a bit.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653673,"Today’s plan was to slackpack south to make the pickup easier as NY 301 is right near the campground. Therefore we we got dropped off at I84 which is the “end” point. It’s also a planned shorter day. 
The terrain to start the day was pretty nice and we made some good time. We ended up with some good views during the day, including an almost 360 degree view from Shenandoah Mountain. Really seems odd to have the same name as the national park. We stopped at the RPH shelter for lunch were we met Weebles, Cholula and Chum heading the other direction. This shelter is in a fairly residential area and you can get food delivered to the shelter.
Orchid’s family came out to meet us again and it was great to be able to hike with them. The trail was much harder in this section than yesterday but her nieces did really well. After cleaning up, we hung out at the campground and Orchid’s family cooked dinner on the grill. I got caught up a tiny bit on journalling but not too much. Towards evening we headed out for ice cream again. Pilgrim got a large ice cream cone, but then indicated he would get another one if he finished it before we were done with ours. So we dawdled and he did get a second large cone. Covid’s neice’s were very jealous, but those are the perks of thru hiking. 
One of the benefits of heading south is that you get to see who is around you. Yesterday we saw four thru hikers total (Rabbit, Bloodbeard, Beats, and Crush (was Ang from several days ago). Today we passed 28, in order: EFHutton, Professor, Gumby, Neo, New Shoes, Bloodbeard, Beats, Pegasus, Crush, Dusk, Danial, Oscar, Patrick, Weebles, Cholula, Chum, Outlook, Flash, Pink, Snag, Mainething, McGyver, Biscuit, Bryan, Brent, Forest Lorest, Rob, Cara.

We’ll be back together Tuesday night if all goes well. We are checking out of the campground this morning so we needed to pack everything up. We’ll all be slackpacking the first part of the day, but then I’ll be pushing on to the next shelter while Orchid and Pilgrim head off to family. I’m using my backpack for the slackpack so packed everything into the waterproof liner.
Shortly after we started hiking we passed Cholula and caught up with Weebles and hiked with Weebles for several miles until the next water source. About an hour before we reached Nuclear Lake we started hearing rapid gunshots from a shooting range that continued for several hours. We stopped for a snack at Nuclear Lake and were met by a family of human adapted geese that were right next to us and a snake to top things off.
We’d noticed mosquitos at Fahnestock and some parts of the trail, but today it really seemed like they got a lot worse, especially when stopped to get water. Our lunch stop was cut short by persistent swarms of mosquitos even through we were all mostly covered up.
After lunch we passed Dover Oak, which is the largest oak tree on the AT. It’s surprising close to a road and I would expect that some of the roots go under the road itself. Immediately after we had some nice meadow walks and then some boardwalks through swampy areas. In one of the thick mud places, I planted a pole and it stuck in the mud and pulled apart where the clamp joins the pole. It will work to support the tent but not sure if will stay together while hiking so I switched to carrying it.
When we got to NY 22, Orchid and Pilgram headed off for their zero days. I stopped at the food truck for a second lunch. While eating I laid out a bunch of stuff in the sun to dry out. After lunch I stopped at the landscape shop which also sells ice cream and cold drinks to hikers before heading back out on the trail solo. Rather uneventful time up to the shelter. There are only 4 people at the shelter tonight and two are section hikers going south. Not sure were everybody is staying. We also not sure that we saw another NOBO hiker other than Weebles and Cholula all day.

A few miles later we pop back into NY for 2 miles but I think they count the first CT crossing as the official one. I didn’t have much breakfast food left so I was planning to go into town and have a sandwich at the Bulls Bridge Country Store which advertise a Deli. Unfortunately the Deli was prepackaged sandwiches only and was subpar compared to my expectations.
After leaving town I came upon a Boy Scout troop that was just starting their trip and hiked with them briefly until l stopped to get water and celebrate my 600 mile mark. After climbing to the top of the mountain I came across a pair of day hikers and stopped to talk with them fro catch my breath and then followed them chatting or a while. We passed the boy scouts and then I went on my way.  I passed a CT ridge runner who was heading south and stopped to chat briefly. I stopped at a nice stream to get water and decided to have a foot soak and lunch to pass the time before the pickup. 
The day hikers and another thru hiker passed me while I was eating, and the scouts also stopped at the stream while I was there. After the cooling off, the trail ended up going up a long climb in an area that had a lot of Gypsy Moth damage, although there was still a little dappled shade. Looking out over the mountains there are a lot of areas that are completely devoid of leaves. However, at this point it was definitely getting into the mid 80’s and with the sun and no breeze it felt really bad. Fortunately after the crest of the hill there was a slight breeze.
I caught up to the thru hiker, named Pie, with about 2 miles left before the road crossing and we ended up chatting as she ended up cabooseing me to the road crossing. The day hikers were still at the road crossing when we got there and we managed to talk ourselves into a ride to the IGA grocery store in Kent, CT without specifically asking for a ride. I grabbed some dinner and ice cream at the IGA while Pie did a resupply and found a picnic table in the shade to wait for Mrs Duckie. While Pie was checking out a trail volunteer she met the day before was behind her and he offered her a ride back to the trail. The three of us ended up chatting for a while as Pie sorted and prepped her food. Just about the time Pie was finished, Mrs Duckie arrived and we all headed out on our separate ways.
I’m taking a zero on the next two days and then a nero to meet back up with Orchid and Pilgrim

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654067,"Continued the vacation in the morning then put together all my stuff and headed back to the trail in the afternoon. Relatively long drive to get back to Kent and didn’t get to the trail until about 5. Short day today so I’ll still get in before dark. 



This part of CT looks like it is suffering from gypsy moth caterpillars. Vast areas of the forest are bare of leaves. This leaves many areas significantly more exposed to the sun than one would normally find. Not sure when we will pass out of this area as I’ve seen comments about the caterpillars at campsites further north.
I got several nice views and many partial views through the bare trees. Walked along the Housatonic River again for the last 3 miles today. 


I didn’t notice any Mt Laurel blooms, actually not even a Mt Laurel bush, for the first time since day 2. It’s been a good run for the Mt Laurel and although I hope to spot more blooming, I’m not hopeful. 



This shelter has a ton of fireflies. Everywhere you look they are blinking.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654068,"Bit hard to get going today after sleeping comparatively late while on “vacation “ and it was also quite chilly. Wasn’t really hungry for breakfast so only had 2/3 of normal. Got out a little bit later than we wanted with a poorly timed privy stop. Body definitely was having a harder time getting into the groove this morning and felt pretty stiff. Fortunately we had a long flat walk along the Housatonic River before we had to climb.


Once we started to climb we entered a region of extensive Spongy Moth (new name for Gypsy Moth) damage. Basically vast areas of the forest are practically defoliated although it looks like some trees are growing back leaves. Apparently they will eat hemlock trees also and we saw a number of them that are probably going to die. Without the shade, the entire day felt really hot despite being in the low 80s. We were sucking down water but all of us were still struggling. We occasionally had a breeze but it was pretty temperamental. The only plus is that there are a number of extra views through the trees. As I write this I hear stuff falling on the tent and surrounding areas, which is probably a mix of poop, leaves, and caterpillars. If you lean on some trees you squish the ones crawling on the trunk. 


Nothing too exciting about today. The Housatonic River is pretty cool but it’s also polluted with PCBs so not sure how safe it is to swim in. Bunch of ups and downs today but nothing terrible. We did see some Mt Laurel blooming today although most bushes are done blooming. 


Applied sunscreen and had the long sleeves down and the hat on all day. Despite that got some sun but hopefully not too bad. Hard to say if splotchy red is sun or still pretty warm. Drank a lot especially as we got to camp so hopefully replenished enough. 


We saw a bunch of hikers today, including Cool Cucumber (was Bart) from last Monday on his first day. We ended up hiking and chatting for a while with Carjack and Cool Whip. Smooth (who could pass for Pilgrim at a distance) who is part of that group caught up here and there. All three are at the same campsite.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654069,"Woke up with the plan to head to the Mountainside Cafe for breakfast so without eating we were able to get out a bit earlier than usual. Had some nice French Toast and ham and we lingered over breakfast letting our power bricks charge. 


We then passed through Falls Village and the Great Falls waterfall on the Housatonic River before climbing up Mt Prospect. Ironically I was just near Lake George which has Prospect Mt. From there we had great views of the three mountains we climb tomorrow: Bear, Race and Everett. Fortunately the Spongy moth was not as bad in this section. Descending the mountain led us into Salsbury CT for lunch and a resupply. 


We walked into town with 2 other hikers and two more came shortly after that. At one point there were seven hikers and their packs lined up in the shade outside the very bougie market affectionately known as Hiker Trash. It’s entirely possible I went into the market with a sweat soaked shirt and pants stinking to high Heaven. One of the hikers that joined us was Grits who Pilgrim’ hiked with for a couple of days over a thousand miles ago. 


Almost 3 hours after we arrived in town we finally dragged ourselves back to the trail with full bellies and food bags. Naturally we have to climb out of town but we came to a nice stream that was somewhat cold and had a long foot soak. Grits pulled up and we convinced her to join us as well and chatted for a while. Finally dragged ourselves away and started the climb up Bear Mt where our campsite is about halfway up. As we’re getting settled in for the night we hear a bunch of coyotes howling. 


Plan is a short day tomorrow with the hills and the heat.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654070,"Woke up at 4:55 this morning to catch the sunrise. By the time I got up there was already a nice orange glow in the sky. The sunrise was pretty nice and worth getting up for. Carjack, Coolwhip, Smooth and Cool Cucumber were also watching and we bid farewell to Carjack as her LASH was coming to an end. We were able to get out before 7 but had to stop for water so got out roughly at the normal time. 


We finished the climb up Bear Mt where we got some good views of the climbs for the rest of the day. The climb really wasn’t too bad and we had a nice stretch of fully blooming Mt Laurel. Coming down you cross into MA about a half mile down. Continuing down you enter Sages Ravine which is a really beautiful stream through an old growth hemlock forest. We stopped for a long time for a foot soak in the really cold water. It was hard to keep your feet in the water for long but was really refreshing. Climbing down it was still cool and we had a pretty nice cooling breeze. We reached the bottom of the ravine and crossed the stream to start the climb up Mt Race. 


Immediately we got the sun and the temperature immediately went up by 10-15 degrees. The climb towards the summit of Mt Race wasn’t too bad but the exposed walk on the ridge was tough in the sun despite the amazing views to the east and north. We were able to see Greylock Mountain (39 miles as the crow flies) which is the first 3000 ft mountain we have since Shenandoah. As we started the decent the temperatures again dropped on the north side of the mountain and we headed down to grab water and cool off in the campsite in the valley before Mt Everett. 


Mt Everett is the highest peak we’ve had in a while, but only has a 700 ft climb given the surrounding area. However you do that in about 3/4 of a mile which makes for a steep ascent. Small views but nothing like earlier in the day. Made the decent into camp and am setup in the shelter tonight with threat of TStorms. Hopefully bugs aren’t too bad. 


Met a couple Tater Tot and Dirty Girl who were also at the shelter last night. They thru hiked in 2019 and on the spur of the moment decided to do their favorite section again. So they quit their jobs and are hiking from NY to Katahdin. 


Plan tomorrow is flexible due to scarce water, a long water carry and uncertain water at the place we’re thinking of stopping. We’ll see how things look when we get to the shelter. Hopefully some rain overnight will help.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654250,"So we got up and got out of camp and had a relatively uneventful morning until we got to trail magic in the late morning. This one had a full camp set up under a huge tent in the middle of a field. They do this six days a week during the summer. They had a grill, water resupply, snacks, fruit and stuff like that along with  , phone chargers and an actual wooden dining room table. We all had a burger or veggie burger and chased it with a hotdog. After early we stayed and chatted for a while. The church group is about 20 minutes away and the people that were running it today had never done the trail magic before. I’m not sure if it’s a big congregation or if there are regulars that typically run it. Just as we were finishing up Cool Whip, Smooth, and Cool Cucumber pulled up as well.


It was a weird day as it felt like we were going every direction but north. At one point we were walking along the Housatonic river with the flow, whereas in Connecticut we were walking against the flow. We were heading towards a bridge over the Housatonic to get to the other side which is why we were heading south. However the entire day felt significantly more twisty and turny. 


In that general area, Pilgrim saw a water moccasin crossing the trail right in front of him. So of course that put checking for snakes back on the radar.


Most of the rest of the afternoon passed uneventfully and we got some views. As we were starting to approach the Tom Leonard Shelter we were getting notifications for severe thunderstorm watches and there definitely were some dark clouds in the sky. When we got to the shelter we decided to push on the 2 miles to trail magic 600 steps west on MA23. Shortly past the shelter we came to Ice Gulch which is a really cool deep ravine between two peaks that is pretty long. Apparently the ice and snow lingers well into the spring as the ravine does not get that much sun. 


With about 1 mile to go the heavens opened and it started to pour. We got rain coats on but not before we already pretty wet. The trail became a pretty nice river very quickly. Shoes and shorts were drenched. So it only took almost 50 days for it to really rain hard on a duck. Didn’t really want to get soaked but we really do need the rain. Hopefully this will help replenish some of the streams and springs that are dry or have a very low flow right now.


When we got to the trail magic camp they had pop-ups set up and the Tornado Memorial Chapel was open. We were drenched from the waist down. My dry bag had a teeny amount water in it so I’m glad I have the second plastic bag inside as well. Although we were inside the chapel, it’s hard to dry off much when it’s humid out. The sun came back out so we hung wet clothes all over a tree. 



This trail magic was run by Sue, who had just purchased the property recently, along with a bunch of other ANC chapter friends. She plans to turn it into a hostel eventually and retire there as well. Once the storms passed we got a ham egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, a cheeseburger, veggies, fruit, and some delicious homemade cookies and blueberry cake. We were able to camp overnight in the chapel so we were able to stay dry all night. In the morning we got breakfast sandwiches again as well as pancakes. This was one of the best trail magic I have come across so far. The group was super friendly and very welcoming and it was a great experience overall. Definitely worth getting wet for.Steps 35100

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654252,"Slept good last night despite some mosquito activity as we were falling asleep. One of the downsides of the chapel is that they have not yet figured out the bathroom problem. So it was either walk far away to the woods or driving to the McDonald’s. So naturally had to take a side trip just as we got started back on the AT in the morning. I then spent much of the morning playing catch-up (like usual).


Early on we passed the south Wilcox shelter which is one of the oldest original shelters on the AT. It’s made out of chestnut logs and built log cabin style. We met a Massachusetts Ridgerunner who gave us a bit of a history lesson and pointed out the areas we’d been yesterday and where the trail used to go. 


For the rest of the day we had a couple of views and we passed a few nice ponds, some natural and some beaver ponds. 


Today was a shorter day as we were aiming for a pick up from friends of Orchid’s - Lauren and Yvonne. They did an awesome job being trail magicians, surprising us with a delicious chicken pizza, cookies, chips and drinks. They even had a sign for Orchid. The pizza was quickly devoured and then we headed for ice cream. Much thanks for the pick up and all the trail magic.


They dropped us of at Orchid’s sister‘s house to pickup Orchid‘s car. We drove to Orchid‘s house, picking up some snacks and dinner on the way. Spent most of the afternoon doing showers, laundry and just generally relaxing. Orchid’s sister and her family came over in the evening for dinner and then we headed out for a second round of ice cream afterwards. 


Overall had a great afternoon and evening socializing with her friends and family but of course did not really get a chance to catch up with things like journaling and social media. Got to bed way too late but can sleep late.

Not too much to report about today. We didn’t get any views and we went past a bunch of ponds but didn’t really have great views of them from the AT. The largest of them was Upper Goose Pond which has a shelter with a caretaker, and you can get pancakes in the morning. 



There ended up being a lot of rocky sections that were reminiscent of PA. Fortunately each section wasn’t too long. We passed through a large section that was full of blowdown’s. Easily 50 trees had fallen across the trail. A lot of work went into clearing all of them. Walking the trail and seeing the work that is put into the trail gives you a new perspective on just how much volunteering and effort goes on behind the scenes.
Despite some sprinkles in the afternoon we made it to the shelter before it really started to rain. The three of us are the only ones here and are dry and snug as a bug in the shelter. Well… except for the bird that is stuck in the shelter and the mosquito’s. Terrible cell service, but that means an early night. 


Plan is stopping at the Cookie Ladies house and then Dalton MA for lunch.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654508,"It rained overnight, but not a lot of rain, which led to a damp and overcast start. One of the upsides of a wet forest is that the woods really pop. It seems like the greens are emphasized by the damp leaves and the overcast day. 


Shortly after we left camp we saw moose tracks in the mud. Later we met a southbound Hiker who said a northbound Hiker was startled by a moose near where we saw the tracks. So there definitely was one in the area around the time that we were there, but unfortunately we didn’t see a moose. A little ways past the tracks are some bog ponds that Orchid says are a prime moose habitat.



The goal for the morning was to make it to the Cookie Lady 2.0 house for chocolate chip cookies. As we were walking up, Relish stuck her head out of a bus on the property that you can camp in. We ended up talking with Big Hungry, Play by Play, and Relish for a while, catching up with what they’ve been doing as well as what we’ve been doing. Turns out they have seen six bears since we saw them last. They had been about half a day behind us for a while but had passed us when we took our zero. They also stayed at Upper Goose Pond and had the pancake breakfast and also canoed on the lake with boats that are at the shelter. Unfortunately due to a family emergency it looks like we’re gonna be a couple days ahead of them now.
We devoured a couple of the delicious homemade cookies. This family bought the house after the previous cookie lady passed away with the promise to continue the cookie tradition. It looks like they’re adding services like the bus and an airplane hanger that you can stay in and they’re definitely supporting the AT community.


About a mile after The Cookie Lady I hit 700 miles and we did the obligatory photo op.


Today was mainly a woods walk and we only had one real view for the day. However the trail did go through the town of Dalton Massachusetts. We were there for lunch and so we stopped at a very nice sub shop. While we were eating, Orchid discovered that one of the couple at the table next to us worked with Orchid‘s mom and sister at the hospital back in her hometown. The couple don’t even live in Dalton anymore. It’s very strange how things work on the trail, as far as seeing and meeting people that are somewhat interconnected through hometowns or other things despite the vast community that we are walking through.


At camp there is a larger number of people that we seen in a while, nine total hikers, some section hikers, one southbound and the rest are northbound.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654509,"The plan for today was to hike about 5 miles to a road crossing where we would meet Orchid‘s husband, sister, and father. They would accompany us on the climb up to Mt Greylock. On the way to the rendezvous point we had a beautiful view down into Cheshire, MA from the Cheshire Cobble. We then proceeded to decend down into town where we ran into Grits who was just heading out for the day via a local outfitters to try to find a fuel canister.


We got to the pickup point just after Orchid‘s family had pulled up. We swapped out our heavier packs for day packs for the climb up to Mount Greylock. Orchid‘s dad started the climb with us while her husband and sister position cars at the top and a trail head that they could take to meet us partially up the mountain. It was a lot of fun hiking up the trail with her family swapping trail stories and family stories. Before we got to the top of the mountain we entered what felt like an alpine zone with a Pine trees and rocks with everything covered in moss.  It was just wonderful. We also came across a small pond that was glass still. We got some amazing photographs with the mountain and sky reflecting in them. It was just absolutely beautiful. Definitely one of my favorite spots on the trail so far.


We finished the climb to the top, took in the views, and climbed up the war Memorial on the top to get 360° views of the surrounding mountains out to Vermont, New Hampshire and New York. We were staying at the lodge at the top of the mountain, Bascom lodge, and we checked in and got a shower before heading  to town with her family for dinner and the obligatory ice cream.


We got back in time to catch the sunset which was nice. Then headed up to the room to finish organizing the resupply her family brought us. We got to bed way too late considering we are waking up to see the sunrise in the morning.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654705,"When we woke up at 4:45 AM and looked out the window to the south it was foggy. However there was some clear sky in the east so we headed out and climbed up to the summit of Mount Greylock to take in the sunrise. It was nice but there were clouds on the horizon and mist blowing over the mountain from the south so unfortunately it was not a great sunrise.


We were hoping to get out early but the “boys” took a while to get ready and so we made it out earlier than usual but not as early as we were originally planning. Orchid will say that she always waits for the boys in the morning (yeah that’s absolutely true).


With eating breakfast, packing up, and the privy it seems like it takes me about an hour and a half to get going in the morning.



The descent from Mount Greylock started pretty steep but it transitioned into a more gradual descent as we went down. We headed out to Mount Prospect ledges overlook and had a great view down to Williamstown and North Adams, MA. At the bottom of the descent we had about a three-quarter mile road walk through town.In town there was an AT community message board with some trail magic including drinks and snacks. We caught up with Grits here and ended up seeing her several more times during the day and at the campsite. Just after passing through town I reach the 1/3 mark of the Appalachian Trail and did the obligatory marker and photo app.


Following that was a long climb ending with a boulder field to navigate through. I felt like we were back in Pennsylvania again. One last hurrah from Massachusetts before we cross the state line. At the top of the mountain was a large burn area from a fire last summer. It’s remarkable how quickly the forest can recover if it is not a super hot fire. A short time later Pilgrim reached his 1600 mile mark and then barely a mile later we reached the Vermont border. For the first 105 miles in VT the Appalachian Trail and the Long Trail overlap before the AT splits off to the east and the LT heads north.


We did get a number of views throughout the day of the surrounding mountains and towns in the valley. One thing we’ve noticed is that there is definitely not as much Spongy Moth damage in the Massachusetts mountains as there was down in Connecticut. There’s some small areas of brown, but they are generally small portion of the mountain and somewhat far apart.


It seem like almost immediately in Vermont there was a change in the mountains, forest and the trail. It just seemed significantly more like a wilderness then Massachusetts did. Not sure if this is because there was more thicker underbrush or trees but I certainly have noticed an increase in the amount of mud for which Vermud is known. 


At that point we still had over 10 miles to get to camp, definitely a long day with a bunch of climbing. I was definitely feeling the longer day today than we’ve done in a while - 20.4 miles with 4000 feet of elevation gain. At camp we also saw Roller who I met on day 1 with Pilgrim and who Pilgrim hiked with for a while. By the time we set up camp, ate dinner, and got the food bags hung it was already well after sunset.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654706,"After yesterday‘s long day and somewhat late night we got a later start than usual. Pilgrim and Roller headed out first and then about 15 minutes later Orchid and I went out. Plan for today is a shorter day to end at the top of Glastenbury mountain for a sunset and sunrise watching party. There’s still quite a lot of climbing on the shorter day. I ended up taking a quick break when we caught up with Pilgrim and Roller at the top of the mountain. There was a good view down into Bennington. This started a relatively steep descent down to Route 9 followed by an equally steep climb back out. 


Was definitely feeling the legs for the climb out of Rt 9. I think I might need to change up the food that I’m carrying as it’s high in carbs and proteins but not so much in fats. I haven’t quite figured out what to do. I know some people carry cheese and others carry things like olive oil and butter. I might have to start adding the hemp seeds to my breakfast, but I’m not sure if there’s a recommended amount of hemp seeds to have per day. Right now I’m doing about 3 tablespoons with dinner.


We had some tree obscured views during the day, but they were definitely getting overgrown. As we started the final climb to the top of the mountain we entered the Glastonbury wilderness area which was created in 2006 along with a bunch of other ones. One thing about these areas is they are supposed to do limited maintenance like cutting out blow downs and marking the trail. There is definitely a noticeable change in the wilderness. Towards the top of the mountain we entered a new environment zone where things change to pine trees and moss everywhere. It’s a distinct difference from the rest of the day. Because of the elevation I don’t think it’s considered an alpine zone but we noticed a similar change as we climbed up Mt Greylock towards the top. It reminds me of the North Shore emergency videos the boys and I were watching a couple years ago which I think were from the west coast of Canada.


Found a camping spot at the summit near the fire tower and set up camp. Then went to check out the views where we were rewarded with a 360° view of the surrounding states. I could see the Catskills and Adirondacks of New York, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, the Green Mountains of Vermont as well as the Berkshires. It was a very clear day and I guess we could easily see probably 50 miles away. 


Around sunset we climbed back up the fire tower along with five other people - definitely exceeding the four person limit posted at the bottom. The three of us and another person hung out on the steps below the cabin and enjoyed the very nice sunset. It’s definitely worth the climb to the top of the mountain passed the shelter with a  water carry up from the shelter and to have to hang your food. Fortunately the fire Tower makes a very good bear hang.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654749,"We woke up at 4:45 to catch the sunrise from the top of Glastenbury fire tower. By the time we got to the top, the sky already had a orange glow. We have found that some of the best views of the sunrise happen about 30 minutes before the actual sunrise. We stayed up in the tower, in the chilly windy 47° air until the sun fully popped over the horizon. Aside from the getting up early aspect I could do this every morning.


Finished packing up and got on the road earlier than usual. Part of the trouble of managing to get out early is that I tend to not do things like packing up or eating while watching the sunrise. We had a long relatively gentle descent coming down from Glastenbury Mountain where passed or were passed by many of the hikers that were at the top of Glastenbury or at the Goddard Shelter just before. Seems like we’re in a little bit of a bubble right now, and recently I’ve seen more AT hikers as well as LT and section hiker‘s. Otherwise while the forest on the descent was beautiful, we didn’t get any views.


After that we had an approximately 3.4 mile 1700 foot climb up to the top of Stratton Mountain. This is actually not as bad a climb as we were anticipating. Much of it was a rather gentle steady uphill and not the super steep climb of some of the other peaks. We’d been told that the top of the mountain can be like Disneyland at times because many tourists ride the gondola and then walk the half mile to the fire tower. However when we got there, the last gondola ride up had already occurred and there were only two people up in the fire tower. We climbed up and got some better views of Mount Moosilauke which I believe we climb as well as Mount Snow and Bromley ski resorts. There’s also a rather large lake between Mount Snow and Stratton Mountain that is quite pretty. Stratton Mountain just misses the 4000 foot mark by 60 feet.




The climb down from Stratton Mountain to the Stratton mountain pond and shelter was very easy and Orchid and I got to the shelter just after 5 o’clock which is earlier than we had originally been expecting. Roller was at the shelter already along with an overnight hiker that lives in Orchid‘s hometown. Two other hikers showed up before dark so the shelter was relatively uncrowded as It can hold 16 people.
The shelter has a caretaker because it’s in an environmentally sensitive area and is heavily used. She told us that 45 people had stayed at the shelter and the campsite the night before. The Green Mountain club has been putting some work into this area along with some of the other shelters - replacing previous pit privy’s with mouldering privy‘s and adding tent platforms.Before bed we headed down to the pond to watch a very nice sunset which was reflecting in the pond. I had a little bit of a headache and a very runny nose. I think I didn’t drink enough in the morning. Although  the temperatures were not that hot I think I sweated a bunch and got a bit dehydrated during the day.


Pond was super warm but by the time we got down there around sunset the air was cold and I still wasn’t feeling all that well, so we ended up not going swimming. Roller had been in the water earlier during the day and said it was absolutely fantastic. Of course the means we were drinking “Roller Water” as the pond is a water source for tomorrow.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654750,"I got in bed about 9 last night and I actually managed to sleep until almost 5 when the birds started chirping and people in the shelter started stirring. I tried to go back to bed but of course I had to pee so that was it for sleep, but fortunately I’m feeling much better today with no headache and my nose is not running.


Plan for the day is a short 10 miles into Manchester where we’re doing a resupply, laundry, shower, and eating town food and ice cream!! I passed by the pond again this morning, but there was a chill in the air and a schedule to get to the pickup point. Also a strong desire to not hike with wet clothes so I passed up the chance for a swim. This morning we staggered out of camp one by one, but a couple miles later we’re all bunched up and talking together Roller, Pilgrim, Orchid and I as we’re all going into Manchester. We’re leapfrogging several other hikers going into Manchester. It’s like having our own little mini bubble going down the trail this morning.


We caught up with Roller on the way to our pick up point and hiked with him for a while until the lunch break. We were ahead of schedule and Pilgrim‘s friend is picking us up from the trail head so we figured we would stay at a place with a table rather than sitting in the parking lot. While we were hanging out at the shelter working on the plan for next week, Roller headed into town to catch a ride to the Hostel. After spending some time looking at the plans for next week we headed down to the parking lot for the pick up. Pilgrims friend was a little late so we hung out talking with some other Hiker‘s waiting for her to arrive.


After she picked us up we headed down to Zoey’s deli for a very nice lunch and then across the street to Ben & Jerry’s for some ice cream. After that we headed to the Price Chopper grocery store to do a resupply for the push into Rutland Vermont. Some of the options at this resupply are definitely limited and they were out of some things we were looking for which is often the case these days. As we were heading to Ben & Jerry’s we saw Grits walking down the sidewalk and then ran into her again at the supermarket during the resupply. Following resupply she dropped us off at the Green Mountain House hostel where we will be spending the night.



The hostel is really nice and the three of us have our own room. They had sodas, ice cream, pizza and various resupplies for purchase. They have a bunch of little odds and ends for restocking as well as things like a razor and clippers. They also have free laundry and free make your own breakfast which is obviously very nice.
Orchid had replacement shoes and a hiking staff for Pilgrim brought up by her dad on his motorcycle. She got to add her shoes to the dozens of shoes hanging on the porch railing. Apparently a lot of people must do a shoe resupply here and they created a shoe railing art. It probably would be interesting to go through all the different brands of shoes and see how they all fail and which models are most popular. 


We cooked some dinner that we had picked up at the store and then we went back to working on the plan for next week. We were also coordinating with my sister (the video editor) as she’s coming up to bring some resupply items and gear changes and Slackpack us for a day. By the time we finished everything it was already long past 9 and I had not caught up with any of the journaling or social media. I spent time doing that and I got to bed at almost 11, which is ridiculously late, although we do get to sleep a little bit later tomorrow morning as the shuttle does not leave until 7:30.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655041,"I woke up around 615 to the smell of cooking sausage. Papa Smurf was making some breakfast burritos with egg, cheese, hashbrowns, sausage and I had two. I also had two waffles as well. Was really craving OJ which I forgot to get at the store.


One of the guys that works at the Hostel dropped the three of us and August off at the trail head a little after 730. As we were getting ready to leave, Never Better walked up who we haven’t seen since Shenandoah. Apparently he got injured and had to take some time off and has since changed his trail name to Continuing On (I believe). Immediately after leaving the parking lot we started the climb up Bromley ski mountain. A small portion of the AT shares one of the ski slopes up at the peak. I had noticed a water jug in the Ski Patrol hut and went in to see if there was a water cache. As I entered I was startled by Grits who was making morning coffee after spending the night at the Bromley mountain shelter. The power was on at the Ski Patrol shack but there was no water.


We descended down to a parking lot where there was supposed to be a water cache. We found 3 gallons of water left and also ran into Crush who we thought was several days ahead of us. Apparently she had gotten off trail for a family event which is how we managed to catch up. We then climbed up and over Styles Peak and also (it looks like) Peru Peak where I hit the 800 mile mark of my journey. We made the obligatory 800 mile marker and did the photo op. 


We went through several wilderness areas today Lye Brook, Peru Peak, Big Branch. These were created in 2006 and it’s not clear how many more there are. 


Following that we headed to the Peru shelter where we ate lunch and talked with a bunch of people about the impending thunderstorms. We were trying to figure out the exact timing of the storms since we were about to go over a peak. It looked like the storms would hit after we got to the next shelter so we decided to head out and wait for the storms to pass in the next shelter. We had one more climb over Baker’s peak which involved a rock scramble. As we’re climbing that, we’re hearing thunder in the distance and I worked hard to make it up and over the peak before any storms appeared. Fortunately we are able to make it over the peak and were on the descent with about 1 mile to go to the shelter before the thunder really started to get close. At that point Orchid and I put on the afterburners and started speedwalking and jogging down the trail to try to get to the shelter before the rain started. We made it to about a quarter mile from the shelter before it started to rain lightly. We got a little wet but managed to get into the shelter just before the heavy rain started.



Inside the shelter we found Scavenger Princess and 3DM who we had hiked with a couple of weeks ago along with a overnight hiker. Even though it happens regularly, I still find it weird/amazing that we keep meeting up with people that we thought were way ahead or way behind us on the trail, but it’s deafly cool to keep seeing them.
We spent some time chatting with the three of them before Grits, Crush, Cap’n Crunch, and finally Pilgrim arrived at the shelter. All of them were pretty wet. After the first two cells passed, everyone else but Grits and Crush pushed on to the next shelter. We were waiting until 5 o’clock to decide whether to stay or go. Another brief squall passed by about 430 and then we made a decision, along with Crush, to stay. Naturally a couple minutes later the sun came out and we saw blue skies. Grits ended up eating dinner at the shelter and then pushing on about an hour later. 


It’s amazing how much space four damp and wet hikers can take up when you’re trying to get set up with wet clothes in a shelter. At one point it wasn’t clear that all four of us could actually fit in the shelter with our stuff, although the shelter was designed for six. Overall we spent a couple of hours chatting with everyone, which is a lot of fun as this is a great group to hike and camp with.


Around 9 o’clock as we were all falling asleep a large Boy Scout troop came into camp and set up in the tenting area. They are actually pretty quiet, but all of them had their headlamps on bright and kept shining light in the shelter. I woke up around 11 to roll over and it look like I saw them all coming back from a moonlight hike. Not sure where they would have gone, but I don’t think there’s any views anywhere nearby other than Baker Peak. They were asleep in the morning so we were not able to ask them.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655042,"For whatever reason I ended up not sleeping well last night, waking up about every hour to flip over to the other side. It also appears that I now have a slow leak in the sleeping pad as I had to blow it back up in the middle of the night. Fortunately for me, only my hip was on the ground after most of a night sleeping on it. Most of my clothes are only a little bit damp from last night, but they certainly didn’t dry any more overnight. Pilgrim and Crush still have very wet clothes.


We continued hiking in the morning in the Big Branch wilderness area and we walked along the Big Branch and Homer Stone Brook for much of the first part of the day. We were serenaded with the sound of water overnight and for the first couple of hours today. This makes for a very pleasant walk in the woods.


We came up to Little Rock Pond, which is a very nice pond with swimming opportunities and a campsite with caretaker nearby. Although it looks very inviting to go for a swim… I was still catching up to Pilgrim and Orchid and decided against the swim. However I was on the lookout for moose as it seems like it has the potential to be a moose habitat. From a mileage standpoint staying here didn’t really fit in the plans, but after looking at it, I wish we had known how nice the pond was ahead of time and maybe tried to make that work. That’s one of those things where there’s very nice places that are close together and we feel like it’s too short of a day to do both. Or they’re far enough apart that it would make for way too long a day or a very odd normal then short to make them happen.


After climbing out of Little Rock Pond we had large sections of pine forests. Not all of them are the “Alpine area” at the top of the mountain. Most of those that weren’t tended to be the dense ones with no understory plants.


After climbing up one of the peaks, we got to the White Rocks overlook, and headed down the long steep .2 mile trail to the overlook. We were rewarded with great views of the valley all the way out to Rutland Vermont, Where we will be staying tomorrow night. What goes up must come down and we descended down to Bully Brook and had a break for lunch and a foot soak. 


After lunch we had a 1000 foot climb followed by a long decent into Clarendon Gorge. The gorge is crossed by a very bouncy suspension bridge. We saw Scavenger Princess and 3DM playing in the water but at point we were ready to be done for the day and so we pressed on. It was one more short but very steep climb to get up to the shelter and it definitely was a bit of a struggle at the end of the day. Fortunately there was a stream at the shelter that was nice and cold. We had a long foot soak before dinner to cool off and recover our feet. 


Original plan was work on the schedule for next week heading into the whites in New Hampshire, but we ended up chatting several long trail thru hiker‘s who had built a fire. By the time we finished eating and getting ready for bed it was almost time to go to sleep. We’re waking up earlier tomorrow to get a head start on the Killington Peak climb and to try to beat any thunderstorms. We’re also trying to make sure we don’t miss the last bus down into Rutland.


Certainly was not one of our longest or hottest days, but it did have a good amount of elevation change.  It’s the tail end of a push into Rutland and my tail was definitely dragging as I got into camp last night.  I think both Orchid and Pilgrim echo my sentiments.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655043,"Today is the day that we summit Killington Mountain. The AT goes near the summit, just shy of 4000 feet, but we’re planning to take the blue blaze trail up to the summit which is at about 4250 feet. We’re then planning to catch the bus into Rutland, and We are hoping to make the 425 or 525 pick up. As a result of a longer day with bigger climbs, Orchid and I plan to get out about 30 minutes earlier than usual and Pilgrim before that.


Pilgrim left about 6:15, Orchid got out a little before 645 and I got out about 10 minutes after her. Immediately we started a long steep climb where it felt like my heels didn’t touch the ground for the entire climb. It’s definitely a hard way to start the morning when you don’t even get to warm up on the flats.



The last water source before the climb to Killington was a couple of hours from camp and I spent the morning trying, and failing, to catch up to Orchid. Today she actually pulled away and gained on me probably 10 to 15 minutes. The journey there was very nice and there were a lot of streams and brooks as well as a bunch of meadows and farmland. Much of the forest generally looks the same so it’s nice to get a change of pace.
After getting water, we started the 3.3 mile climb up to Killington. While we were in the “Alpine zone“ it was rough walking and there were long steep drop offs, climbing over rocks and rotted out tree stumps, and just generally a hard trail. Definitely had to be sure footed to not go to tumbling off the mountain. Despite the challenges, it was quite a beautiful climb up towards Killington Peak. We saw Grits heading south just before we got to the peak point on the AT. Pilgrim got to the peak just before we did. One of the original shelters on the AT is at the peak but it is definitely in rough shape and needs quite some work both on the inside and the outside. There is a steep 300 foot climb up to the actual summit of Killington Mountain, and Orchid and I left our packs in the shelter and climbed up to the summit. It’s definitely challenging, rocky terrain and I’m glad that I was doing it without a pack.


At the summit we headed over to the Peak Lodge for some desserty items and flush toilets. It was definitely a little strange being at the summit in non-ski season. There’s food trucks, mountain bikers, and a little wedding chapel set up at the lodge. It’s also strange to be around so many day hikers who took the gondola up.  Fortunately it wasn’t overly crowded at the top. Summer prices at the lodge are pretty much the same as ski season. 


Pilgrim had started down the mountain ahead of us, and Orchid and I caught him about halfway down. We all finished hiking down the mountain together. We managed to get to the RT 4 parking area just before 4 PM, plenty of time for the 425 bus. The bus was on time and it was easy to flag the bus down and catch it into Rutland.


We’re staying at the Yellow Deli Hostel ( run by the Twelve Tribes spiritual community) which is located right next to the main Rutland bus depot. You can actually see the rear entrance to the Hostel from the bus depot, but you have to walk around to get in the front. We checked into the hostel where the men are on one floor, and the women on the upper floor. There are bunks for 34 men and only two toilets! There are 30 bunks for women and three toilets. After grabbing a shower, we headed out for pizza at a brewery down the street. Pilgrim and I finished our pizza, but Orchid didn’t so we’ll have pizza leftovers for the Killington house where we are taking a zero or the trail.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655044,"Despite being in a room with seven other guys last night, it was actually pretty quiet, and nobody snored. Got up earlier and I had time to get caught up a little bit of some journaling. The Yellow Deli offers a free breakfast, but it definitely was not enough to satisfy Hiker Hunger.



The three of us headed to Walmart and then Price Chopper to do a resupply for the stretch after Killington. My sister met us at the Price Chopper and brought us back to the Hostel to pick up our packs. We got a very nice takeout lunch from the Yellow Deli. On the way out of town we stopped at Stewart’s for a hand pack led pint of ice cream and then Dollar General for some more resupply items.
We are staying in a rental house near Killington ski resort. Once we got there, we put stuff away and prepared the food bags for the next stretch. Then we started the process of continuing to look at the schedule for the following week. Later in the afternoon we headed out to do laundry, look for some handlebar tape for Pilgrim‘s poles, and check for replacement for Orchids CNOC water bag. While the clothes were drying, we had a moment to get a beer and sodas from the bar upstairs.


Headed home and worked on making burritos for dinner and breakfast sandwiches for the morning. Then continued the efforts of planning out next week. It looks like we might be able to stay at Lake of the Clouds hut right before submitting Mount Washington. However, it would be 10 days with no zero as there’s no availability for the following two weeks. It would also mean no wiggle room on the push to make it to the hut. Finally got done with everything around 9 o’clock and then spent some time catching up on journaling and social media.



The plan for tomorrow is for Jen to drop us off at the northern point and then hike with us for a little while. This endpoint is a much harder parking lot to find than the starting point on Rt 4 so we’ll be going southbound.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655054,"The plan for today was to make it to the next convenient road crossing where Jen could realistically pick us up. That makes it the Greengate Road parking area for an 18 mile day. Because this parking lot is in the middle of nowhere, with potentially no cell service, we said it would be better for Jen to drop us off at that parking lot and then pick us up back at Rt 4. That is a major road and we knew we would have cell service there. The other upside is that we would be slacking southbound which means we get to see all the northbound hikers.Jen hiked with us up the relatively steep blue blaze trail to get to the AT and then she joined us for about a mile of the Appalachian trail. She kept looking at us and saying “I don’t know how you do this“ and today we had lighter than normal packs due to the slackpacking.


Most of the hiking today was rather uneventful and similar to recent days. Didn’t really have any views during the day but we did pass by Thundering Falls waterfall and Kent pond. The waterfall was reasonably tall but was more like a cascade, and it looked like it definitely is more impressive when it’s not so dry out. Kent pond is very nice and fairly large. We saw a number of people with kayaks as well as an electric motor boat. There were no really nice places to go for a swim but I did go wading for a little bit in the refreshing water.


Unfortunately, Orchid had taken off her watch and it fell off her bag at the stopping point. She realize she was missing it about a half mile later and she and I turned around to go back and look for it. When we got back to the spot, it looked like the dog that had been playing in the water had come out of the water where we were. We were wondering if the owner had picked up the watch as we couldn’t find it. We turned around and we made it back to the parking lot where we found the woman who with the dog. She had picked up the watch and then raced back to the parking lot to try to return it to us. So definitely a trail angel there, and we had just caught her as she was about to leave the parking lot.


During the day we saw about 20 northbound hikers including Roller, Grits, and Crush. It looks like we might see some of them going into Hanover, NH.


About a mile before the end of the day, at the Maine Junction, where the AT & LT come together, is located and we have the last mile of the combined AT/LT down into the route 4 parking lot. Jen walked up about a half mile to meet us and we got to finish the day with her. She was our Trail Angel of the day, as she spent the day running around Rutland and Killington looking for some last minute supplies and replacement items. Thank you Jen! During all that she also found time to put some beef stew in the slow cooker for dinner tonight.


After dinner, we finalized our plans for most of New Hampshire and made reservations at the Lake of the Clouds AMC hut which is right before the Mount Washington summit. We also have reservations at the Joe Dodge Lodge for the following two nights. I really wanted to stay in a hut and Orchid really wanted to stay at the lodge, and we were able to make them happen. I wouldn’t say that our schedule is aggressive, but it’s also not conservative. It does not have a lot of room for leeway. We got the last available night at Lake of the Clouds as it is booked solid for 3 weeks following our stay.


We also managed to get another load of laundry done at the laundromat, and make the reservations. We passed an ice cream place on the way home, but the line was really long, and it was already almost 830, so we passed it up (horrors!) Instead I had two raspberry turnovers. By the time we finished everything we had to do, including packing up the backpacks and starting to clean up the house, it was already almost 10 PM. I manage to upload video files to Jen but didn’t manage to get any other social media stuff done. It seems like we really need a double zero to be able to do any kind of real catch-up.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655216,"So we woke up at our regular time to get ready to go and help pack up the house. Jen is leaving directly from the trail head to go home as it’s on the way. We managed to clean up the house and get everything packed in the car just a little bit after 7. The back of her Outback was packed, and there’s stuff around our feet but we managed to make it all fit. 


With the full backpack and food resupply the blue blaze trail from the Greengate parking lot back to the AT definitely seems way steeper than it was yesterday, even though it’s only about a 300 foot climb.


I brought pizza, hard-boiled eggs, vegetables, and a turnover from home. We ran into Talus and Waffle on the trail and I offloaded the pizza to them. I had brought lunch and was already thinking I was still pretty full two hours after breakfast and I was going to have to carry the pizza all the way to Hanover on Monday.


As we got to the Route 12 road crossing, we found that there was a farm market about 200 yards down the road so we headed there to see what they had. Ended up grabbing a bunch of berries, a nice muffin, and a Gatorade. There were some Meadow walks right before and it’s now about 80° and the cold drinks really hit the spot. There were several other hikers at the farm stand, a couple of whom are going south, and we heard that there might be some trail magic at a road crossing coming up. It’s the first warmer day in a long while and we are definitely not used to the heat again.


After leaving the farm stand, a couple miles later we came across a nice stream for a foot soak, but it drains from cow pastures, and so we headed up to the next stream which is good drinking water. Unfortunately that stream is relatively shallow and is not a good foot soak cool off stream. We did end up dousing ourselves with water to cool off and we had lunch there as well.


About 2 miles and two climbs later we came across the trail magic at a very nice stream. They actually had root beer floats! The ice cream was soft but it absolutely hit the spot. That’s the first root beer float I’ve had on trail and I never expected it would actually be on the trail. They also had Italian ice and clean water. It was run by two hikers named Queen Bee and Endless who have both liked the AT, PCT twice, as well as several of the other shorter long-distance trails. It’s probably closer to the mid 80s right now and sitting in the creek having a root beer float is absolutely wonderful on a hot day.


We left after being there for over an hour, and then immediately began a long climb which included some meadow walks, so by the time we reached the top we are already hot and dripping sweat again. About a mile before camp and the last climb we came across a sketchy water source and ended up splashing ourselves and having a bit of a water fight. Just to cool ourselves off again.


Tomorrow brings cooler temperatures and rain, but it looks like we’re going to get the extended heat up here as well with temperatures forecast for the mid to upper 80s after that. On Friday we’re climbing Mount Moosilauke with Nick. It’ll be hot and exposed up top, but it’s about 4800 ft so somewhat cooler. However that’s tomorrow’s problem as they say.


With taking the zero, we’re seeing a lot of new faces at camp with about 10 people here, two heading south and everybody else going north. Talus and Waffle are here as well. This shelter has the coolest Privy on trail, so they claim. Which means it has a half wall and the top half is screen only. You can see someone sitting on the pot, but at least you can’t see them from the waist down. Until you stand up. I still think the fully open air pretty from a couple weeks ago it’s cooler :-).

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655217,"I got to sleep earlier than usual last night and I woke up about 520 this morning before the alarm. Apparently I didn’t drink enough last night, as I didn’t have to pee in the middle of the night. Of course now I really had to go, so I got up for the day. I went to get the bear bags from the tree on the way back. Just as I was untying the first bear bag, Pebbles passed me on the way out of camp at 5:30. 


We are basically ready to go at 7 today and we’re the last ones out of camp. I’m guessing some of those were trying to get into Hanover before the rain starts. Depending on the timing of the storm we have a shot of that as well.


On the first climb of the day there was a bench at a viewing area and just passed that was a bunch of raspberries. Unfortunately there was a yellow jacket nest in the raspberries according to the comments in the farOut app. Timex, Pilgrim, and Orchid were hiking together at that point. Timex went through the raspberries looking for the nest and couldn’t find it and didn’t see any bees. Pilgrim went through and of course he got stung, being the only one that’s allergic. He quickly got some benedryl on board and then continued down in the town.


I caught up with them in town and we made a stop at Linda‘s house. She allows you to camp in her backyard and has drinks and coffee available throughout the day. We ended up taking about a 30 to 45 minute break. It looks like Pilgrim isn’t going to show any significant signs of an allergic reaction but he is getting sleepy.


Shortly before lunch it started to lightly rain, but not enough to put on any rain gear. It was still lightly raining by the time we got to the shelter where we were stopping for lunch. I had put the rain skirt that Jen got me on, and that seems to work pretty well to keep the shorts dry. Talus and Waffle were also at the shelter eating lunch.


After lunch we put on rain gear for the walk down into Norwich, but it wasn’t long before I got way too hot and sweaty in the rain jacket and we all took off our rain jackets and just got wet. There’s a long road walk into Norwich, and we caught up with Talus and Waffle and ended up chatting with them on the way to the general store in Norwich. We had some ice cream, I got soft serve maple, and I got a couple things from the general store but they were out of many of the hiker favorites. Coming out of Norwich there was another long road walk to get into Hanover New Hampshire. The rain started coming down steadily on the road walk and I ended up putting back on the rain gear. Generally the skirt did a pretty good job of keeping the shorts dry. We crossed over the Connecticut river, and then did a reasonable photo op despite the rain and the cars splashing us with water.


Lou’s bakery closed at three so we did not get our free pastry. We decided to head to the co-op directly as they closed at 6:30 and we wanted to make sure we got all our shopping done before they closed. There is also a pizza joint that offers a free slice of pizza to AT hikers in town. We did our resupply shopping at the co-op grocery store, which definitely did not have a lot of hiker friendly food. As it was close to 6, we needed to make a decision on whether to get takeout food from the co-op or head the half mile back to restaurants in town. We decided to do the co-op dinner as none of us really wanted to walk back. After eating we had a long climb up to the Velvet Rock Shelter where we found Grits already setup in the shelter. Orchid and Pilgrim stayed in the shelter, while I chose to tent as it wasn’t raining anymore. Just before I got my bear bag hung, it started raining again then rained on and off for the next couple of hours. Did not have any issues with getting wet in the tent. We’d passed Talus and Waffle eating in town and they’re tenting by the shelter as well as well.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655218,"We had two big climbs for the day, and with the predicted higher temperatures and humidity we decided to get out at 6:30 to try to beat the heat a little bit. We weren’t successful, but did manage to get out by 645, witch is earlier than usual. In the morning we saw both Blue and Timex on the trail. The rocks are still slippery and Blue slipped and fell, breaking the tip off the trekking pole. I also had a couple little slips but didn’t actually fall.


Comments in the FarOut app, dedicated there were some yellow jacket nests at the boardwalk over a marsh in the morning. However we didn’t see any signs of a nest or yellow jackets at all. We did however, proceed cautiously just in case. 


It looked like there was very little water for the second half of the day, so we had partially filled up the our CNOC bladders at the last reliable water source prior to climbing Moose Mountain. A group of five younger hikers that was at the shelter two nights ago rolled in, as well as Talus, Waffle, Blue and Timex. Most of them just filled their water bottles, but didn’t carry extra water. 



The first climb was over Moose Mountain South and North with a relatively flat ridge walk in between. At the top of Moose Mountain South we were rewarded with some views to the mountains we just came from. Coming down from the top of Moose Mountain, we saw a whole lot of hovering bees coming out of the ground. I’m not sure what kind of bees they were but we ended up detouring into the woods to avoid them. For the next quarter-mile we found the random hovering bee over the trail, but if you got close to them they would dart off to the side but then return when you passed. Fortunately no one got stung.
I had forgotten to look for a while where my 900 mile mark occurred, and when I happened to look at the app coming down from Moose Mountain I found I had already missed the 900 mile mark. Since we had heard there probably was going to be trail magic at the bottom, we decided to push on and do the marker there. Of course, I forgot all about it and actually didn’t remember it again at all today. I do need to do it in the morning. 


At the bottom of Moose Mountain we found some trail magic being run by the parents of a southbound hiker named Field Trip. Had a hotdog, chips, fig newtons, two sodas, and some clementines while we were there. Also able to top off the water bottles from water jugs they had. It was definitely a welcome respite from the warming day.


We left the trail magic feeling nice and cool, but within minutes we were sweating again as we went through an open marshland and started a long steep climb. This is one of the steepest claims we’ve done so far, and I calculated the average grade to be 15% (1200 feet in under 2 miles). I’m not sure this mountain has a name, but coming down there are some nice overlooks at Holts Ledges with some really nice views down into the valley.


Coming down from Holts ledges I was having some trouble with the belt on the pack irritating me. At the lunch spot, I had tied up one of the side of the buckles so I could make the hip felt shorter. Then I had wrapped my ankle brace around the waist belt and I think that was irritating my hip. I was able to get the waist strap tight enough to have the pack actually stay on my hips, which it has not been happening for the last couple of days. My guess is I’m still losing a little weight despite trying to eat as much as possible. Orchid and I switched packs as her pack has a smaller waist belt than mine. We ended up only switching personal items like our sweat rags, which meant that I was trying to use her fabric water bottle holder instead of my stiff one. At one point while trying to get the water bottle into the holder, I ran right into the blunt end of a log. It caught me straight on the quad, and stopped me dead in my tracks. It was immediately clear that I’m going to have a pretty good size bruise there, and hopefully not too much trouble walking tomorrow. I completely blame Orchid‘s pack for this accident!


At the bottom of the last descent there was a brook to get water and stick our feet in the water to cool off. This was a really nice cold brook and it felt wonderful on this hot day. I poured some cold filtered water over the bruise, as a makeshift ice pack as I thought it wasn’t good to get fully in the water as the leg was still bleeding. However, I also managed to step on a loose rock, slip off, and bruise the top of my left foot. 


We were originally planning to stay at Trapper John Shelter, halfway down the descent, but it wasn’t clear the water was still flowing. We ended up deciding to go to the bottom of the mountain and camp at some established sites near a parking area and brook. We had a little road noise, but it was a gravel road and didn’t have a lot of traffic. The brook was pretty nice and we had dinner by the brook. I had some difficulty hanging the bear bag. The first branch I used broke off. By the time I found another tree it was already getting dark. We’re camped here with Talus, Waffle and another northbound Hiker that rolled in about 9 o’clock.


With the humidity, nothing dries overnight which means everything you were wearing last night is still wet with sweat in the morning. It’s such a lovely feeling to put it back on.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655219,"We have two very big climbs today, a 2000 foot and a 1700 foot climb. It looks like today is the hottest day of the week, so we made another push to get out early. We were only somewhat successful, as Orchid and Pilgrim made it out by 645. Right as I was I starting I needed to go dig a hole in the woods. Also since I forgotten to do the 900 mile mark, I did a 907.4 mile mark at the parking lot before we left.


Orchid and I are faster than Pilgrim on the steeper accents and descents. Orchid and I have been hiking together recently and Pilgrim has been catching up at the top and bottom. It seems to be working fairly well, although sometimes it means less rest for Pilgrim.



The first climb up Smart‘s mountain was definitely tough. Fortunately it wasn’t too hot out, but I was still sweating profusely and my heart rate was well over 100. I had to stop twice on the way up to catch my breath. One of those times was at a nice overlook to Mt Cube, which was creating its own weather. As the humid air was blowing up over the mountain, it was forming a cloud at the top. It was definitely pretty cool to watch the motion of the clouds going up and over the mountain.
About 2/3 of the way up, we found the Dartmouth Outdoor Club doing trail repair and building. There were about a half dozen people working on a rock staircase going up a steep section of trail. It looks like they are camping at the campsite towards the top of the mountain and then hiking down to the job site every day. I thanked them for their service, but really wanted to get the climb over with so pressed on. Smarts Mountain has a fire tower at the top, and I climbed up the fire tower after I caught my breath at the summit. Fortunately the clouds in the morning had dissipated, so we have a bit of a view. However it’s still very hazy out and we probably can see Vermont but it’s definitely very faint.


With the humidity, nothing is drying overnight and we’re just sweating profusely during the day. At the top I used the privy and found I only had two small dry spots on the outside part of the thighs of my drawers. Everything else is simply drenched. I just wish I was able to put on dry clothes in the morning and not stinky disgusting sweaty clothes. Unfortunately I’ll have to wait till the next hostel stay to get things dry.


At the bottom of the descent there was a nice brook and we had an extended foot soak. It was nice and cool by the brook but we can tell the heat is building higher up the mountain. I was eating lunch in the book, and I’m trying not to lose any of my food down stream. Fortunately I was successful in that endeavor.


We met a southbound hiker who told us that Smarts Mountain was nice, but that Mt Cube looks more like true New Hampshire hiking. If we struggled so much going up Smarts Mountain, we are wondering what Mt Cube brings. The start of the climb was steep but the trail was good. We then went down for a little while before starting the climb of the second half of the mountain. That’s when we started meeting the rock boulders and ledges New Hampshire is known for. Nothing too difficult, but definitely was feeling the injured quad on all the ups and downs. Much of the last part of the mountain was sunny and definitely was feeling super hot with temperatures in the mid to upper 80s along with high humidity. However there were really nice views from the top, including looking back on Smart Mountain. We got a little bit of a cooling breeze at the top but could not stay long in the sun.


Pilgrim caught up to Orchid and I on the summit. He stayed to recover longer and the two of us started the climb down. We knew there was another brook at the bottom where we would be soaking our feet, which made the descent a little bit easier. Again there were some rocks and boulders, but this trail down is definitely easier than the trail up. It seems like that is the case for many mountains, where one side is easier than the other. We got to the bottom and immediately stuck our feet in the water. Apparently this is the place to be, as at one point there were eight hikers congregated at the brook including Vincent and his dog Juniper. She’s remarkably well behaved and trained, and basically stays about 10 m ahead of Vincent as she goes down the trail.There were some tent spots by the brook, but we were debating pushing on another mile and a half to some tent spots by the next road crossing. They were comments warning hikers that the area by the road was a party spot for the counselors from Camp Moosilauke. However with the threat of rain and thunderstorms Thursday morning we decided to risk it and press on. Foreshadowing - poor choice. Talus and Waffle decided to take advantage of the spots by the brook but we pressed on.We found a beautiful camp spot just off the trail, with a nice soft bed of pine needles and was perfectly flat. Timex and Paws are here as well. Shortly before dark a guy walked past and said that the counselors from the camp would be coming by later that night to party. At this point it was too late to press on, as it was about 2 miles and 900 feet of climbing to get to the next campsite. This one might not have any water either to complicate things. At about 10:20 the first of probably two dozen counselors started walking past and they were at a spot about 150 m from where we were camped. The actual party was not too bad, but it was everybody walking past the tents with headlights and talking that was the most annoying part. Slept through a bunch of it but definitely knew when they arrived and departed. It sounded like they had coolers and ice but we went back to get water in the morning we didn’t see any signs of a party, so at least they are cleaning up after themselves.


In general, my quad is only slightly sore when I’m climbing up. Unfortunately it’s definitely sore when I’m climbing down. I got a feeling that it felt like it was slightly asleep, but it was doing everything I asked of it although sometimes it felt like it might take a little bit longer to react. There definitely were a couple of places that shouldn’t have been a problem that seemed trickier than they should’ve been. I  have a good size bruise on the top of my foot from the slip in the stream as well. Of course all of this is on the same left leg. I’m also in wet sweaty clothes, except while sleeping, and I just want something dry to wear hiking right now. Note: I use the term “stealth“ site rather loosely in the journal to describe any non official camping spot. In reality, almost every site we picked labeled stealth has been an unofficial established camp site where people have clearly camped before. A true stealth site would be one that no one has used before and when you depart won’t be noticed as being used so it doesn’t become an established site. I’ll admit I am being lazy in using stealth instead of unofficial established camp site which does help propagate a diluted definition of stealth site.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655220,"Woke up tired, but fortunately today was a planned shorter day into the Hikers Welcome Hostel prior to the first big mountain of the whites. It was a rather uneventful and unremarkable journey today. We put out an unattended smoking camp fire - really people? Right by a stream so water was plentiful. We climbed Mt Mist with the catch phrase “You almost missed Mt Mist”. Otherwise, we got to the hostel by noon. 


It’s an odd hostel in that it has some pretty nice bunk rooms, without air conditioning, but an outdoor shower and bathroom with just curtains for privacy (think wind), a porta pot for a second toilet, and one washer/dryer which was being shared by the hostel laundry as well. Short wait for the shower but long wait for the washer. We had originally planned to stay for two nights, but after seeing the place and with no AC, Orchid found there was availability at The Notch Hostel and we made reservations with them for the following day. 


It was pretty warm out in the afternoon and the bunk rooms were very hot. Fortunately there were some picnic tables under a tent canopy and some tall trees where it wasn’t too bad out. I realized I had not been doing a good job drinking about halfway through the afternoon so started working hard to push the fluids. Around 3, we got a pretty good down pour in a thunderstorm. With the heavy rain and the wind the spray was getting everything under the tent damp so I made the dash back to the bunk room. Unfortunately, I started getting a headache in the hot room so shortly headed back outside. 


Nick arrived about 5 as he is joining us for the climb over Moosilauke. We headed out for dinner at a local restaurant, followed by ice cream and a small resupply. The general store didn’t have great breakfast options so I got a hodgepodge of stuff for the morning. Wasn’t feeling great when I got back from dinner and with the bunkhouse still warm I ended up sitting outside for a while. Dinner would turn out to be the last real meal I would eat for a while. But that’s a story for another day.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655283,"When I woke up in the morning, I had a pain in my abdomen, was feeling slightly nauseous and had absolutely no appetite. I knew I had to eat given the calories I would expend today so I forced myself to eat my breakfast. We packed up everything we’re not bringing on the slackpack today in Nick’s car and then waited for the shuttle. We caught the 7 AM shuttle to Kinsman Notch and started hiking around 8. 


Heading south, you get to the steepest part of the trail first, and it’s about a 1.5 mile climb for the steepest section to the Beaver Brook Shelter. Much of this is alongside the Beaver Brook with its multiple cascades and waterfalls. Although it’s a steep climb, with steps bolted into the rocks in places, it’s also a beautiful climb as well. Certainly easier to climb it south bound than descend it north bound. 


We stopped at the shelter to get water and I forced myself to eat 1/2 of my 6” sub. Hit the privy on the way out as well. The second half of the climb is not as steep or technical and you get some views of the summit on the way up. Eventually you emerge into the real Alpine Zone at the top of the mountain. One part of the definition of Alpine Zone is trees that are less than 8 ft tall. Portions of the top have small pines while most is covered in grasses and other small plants. Although the sun was shining, the temperature was upper 60s and there was a good breeze blowing. I was just comfortable with the sleeves down. We stopped for a while to take pictures and to eat. I managed to get the rest of my sandwich down but nothing else. 


It’s been fun to hike with Nick today and to get pictures with him at the summit. I have not felt well all day and I am dragging somewhat. I can tell he’s holding back to hike with me. Abdominal pain gets slightly better when I eat but returns shortly. Have no appetite. Feeling anxious/stressed in the morning at the start of the climb. Not sure if that is from anxiety over the Whites or from stomach and shuttle ride. Both Orchid and Nick noticed that there was a change in me- I wasn’t greeting the hikers in the other direction. We saw quite a few including: Talus, Waffle, Second Wind (was Neverbetter), Boxcar (Mike from Small Ax early on), and Grits. 


We started down the trail which is less steep than the climb, but does have a bunch of wet rocks. About a third of the way down, I slipped and fell hard backwards landing on the day pack. Fortunately, it saved me from hitting my head and back on the rocks. Of course I scraped my, wait for it, left elbow. We stopped for water about halfway down and took an extended break for me. At this point there were about 2 miles left, but I was pretty much done with hiking for the day. It was the first time in quite a while that I had the “stopwatch“ in my head. Eventually we made it back to Nick’s car and drove to the next hostel. 


Nick, Orchid, and Pilgrim went out to eat, while I took a shower and nap. Pilgrim’s friend Mark joined them at dinner and he will be hiking with us tomorrow as well. After dinner, Nick picked me up for a resupply run. I picked up food for the next stretch as well as some applesauce, yogurt and pudding. Afterwards I did some food sorting, although I still need to prepare the slackpack for tomorrow, and then went to bed early for the night.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655284,"I ended up waking up to pee about five times last night. Seems like I might be finally processing some of the stuff I ate and drank yesterday. However, my stomach is still painful although improving. Around 4 AM I made the decision that I would not be hiking today. The plan for today is 16 miles over the Kinsman‘s and there is no bail out point. Once you start, you need to finish or turn around and go back. I just don’t feel well enough to continue today and I’ll need to come back and fill in this section. 


Nick helped shuttle Mark‘s car to the endpoint, and then brought everybody to the starting point. He ended up hiking with Orchid for about an hour before he turned around and came back to the hostel before heading back home.


He helped me ship some cold-weather gear at the post office forward so that I can cut some weight out of the pack for the White Mountains. Otherwise I mostly spent the day trying to eat and napping.


Stomach is feeling a little better, but still hurts anytime I eat and I have no appetite. It’s unclear in the early afternoon what shape I will be in to continue tomorrow. I’m starting to look at alternates for getting to Lake of the Clouds hut on Tuesday. Orchid also texted me that she is struggling with the heat today and probably needs to zero tomorrow as well. We’ll regroup tonight and figure out our plans going forward. I’ve had 2 applesauce cups, 2 small yogurts, 2 pudding cups and 3 thin small pancakes. 


On the upside, The Notch Hostel is really nice and I won’t mind coming back here to finish the missing segment or stay another night. 


Around 5, I decided that I should probably get checked out before heading into the woods as I seemed to not be continuing to get better. I got dropped off at the Urgent Care on the grocery run shuttle. UC didn’t find anything obvious but because abdomen pain (Epigastric pain) can be a symptom of a heart attack they recommended that I head to the ER. I got a shuttle to the ER in Plymouth where they had called ahead. 


I had the heart attack treatment and was in the treatment area within 2 minutes of checking in and about 5 minutes later had IV, blood drawn, EKG and was hooked up to a monitor. After that it was a bunch of hurry up and wait, but I did get a bag of saline and urine test as well. In the end they were unable to find a definitive cause for my abdominal pain despite extensive laboratory evaluation. Basically follow up with primary care and return to ER if things get worse. 


At the point that they discharged me it was after midnight and the shuttle’s were stopped for the night. Plymouth has no taxis or equivalent at night. Sheila found a hotel with one room left about 4 miles away but I really didn’t want to walk there. I even tried Plymouth Police non emergency line who had no suggestions other than be careful walking. In the end, one of the nurses took pity on me and let me sleep in an exam room. 


During the evening I had talked with Orchid and Pilgrim. Orchid had decided to zero tomorrow due to thunderstorms in the forecast. Pilgrim had gotten back to the hostel after 10 and was perfectly happy to not hike as well. A zero Sunday basically will lead to a double zero. There is no point to restart Monday as we’d only get about 4 extra miles compared to starting Tuesday. We’ll be skipping forward 28 miles to keep our AMC reservations.

I snuck to the bathroom so they wouldn’t notice I was still there if they had forgotten. Finally around 6:45 I woke up as I was actually a little bit hungry as I had not eaten since about 2pm yesterday. I found a dinner near the hospital and walked over to eat breakfast. Had a Belgian Waffle but it was a struggle to finish. I also got an omelette to go. Pilgrim and Mark came to pick me up after breakfast and bring me back to the hostel. 


Got a shower and then spent the remainder of the day napping or resting. Managed to eat the omelette and some applesauce, yogurt and pudding but nothing else. This is way too few calories and won’t be sustainable on trail. 


We spent a little time discussing options for continuing after the AMC huts but have not yet picked an option.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655296,"Was actually a bit hungry this morning. I ended up making four thicker blueberry pancakes for breakfast. Around 11, Orchid and I walked a mile down to the Woodstock Inn where I got French Toast with potatoes and sticky bun as well as an omelette to go. Managed to finish three of the four pieces and 3/4 of the potatoes. Had 2/3 for an early dinner and the rest for a late dinner. Still less than I had been eating but it’s a start. Feeling good on the walk. Otherwise spent the day catching up with journaling and relaxing. 


Our updated plan is to skip forward 28 miles to the Lake of the Clouds Hut AT trailhead and do the 11 mile, 5000+ ft of climbing to the hut. Then summit Mt Washington Wednesday and take a zero at Pinkham Notch. We continue north to Gorham and then get a ride back to the hostel where we’ll do the skipped miles before getting a ride back to Gorham. At that point Orchid and Pilgrim will be contiguous but I’ll still be missing a 16 mile section I’ll need to fill in later. 


Tomorrow will be a big test. I’ve got extra Sour Patch kids (sugar) and there is a hut with soup and pastry half way up. Also putting the ear buds in the hip belt pouch instead of inside the pack for additional musical support if needed. Fortunately it will also be much cooler and breezy tomorrow as well.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655580,"Didn’t sleep well last night. Up a couple of times to pee and lots of people doing the same and leaving the curtain open which lets the light shine in my eyes. Managed to eat only two oatmeal packets this morning. We’ve got a 6:30 shuttle leaping us 28 miles forward to the base of Mt Washington. 



The climb out of 302 is a steep one for the first 3 miles gaining about 2000 ft. After that it was a more gradual climb with ups and downs to the Mizpah Spring Hut where we planned to stop for lunch. I was feeling the climb a little bit but was mostly able to keep up with Orchid. I was trying to eat but again didn’t have much of an appetite. Pilgrim was catching up for much of the first half of the climb when we stopped to rest. We kept coming out to viewpoint’s looking out over Willey’s peak with great views to the west and north west. It was a bit cloudy but otherwise pretty clear. The trail was pretty quiet until we got to Mt Webster where we started seeing a lot more day hikers.
Orchid and I made it to the hut, and stopped for a bowl of soup. Today’s selection was a Caribbean Tomato soup… tasty but not the calories I need. I tried to eat a half bagel PB&J and it was a struggle to finish. Orchid left and I followed a few minutes later. For some reason, while the AT goes near all the presidential peaks, the AT actually only goes over some of them. She was planning to do all the presidential peaks. I had given some thought to doing the same, but with how I am now feeling I wrote that off without a second thought. After leaving the hut, there were some steep sections but then a more gradual climb up to Lakes of the Cloud hut where we have reservations tonight. It was definitely a struggle to get calories and water in. I was definitely starting to flag and noticed energy levels dropping but was able to power through without too much trouble.

I got to the hut a while after Orchid, and checked in. We’re in bunk 4 which holds 15 people in 3 high bunks. I got a bottom bunk and the others a middle one. We have one window in our room and it seems like one of the darker rooms. This hut holds 96 people and has a crew of 11. Solar power, well water, propane cooking, and composting toilets round out the amenities. Aside from two helicopter drops, all the supplies are packed in by packs that weigh upwards of 100 pounds and all trash is similarly packed out. The packs are wooden and like an old style external frame pack but without a waist strap so if you fall forward the pack flies off instead of crushing you. This hut gets its supplies from the top of Mt Washington. 


Once I was settled in, I had two quick cups of hot chocolate to try to get some calories in. Beastmode arrived and she let us know where Pilgrim was, she’s also staying the night. Blue is here under a work for stay. Went to a presentation on the hut and then we sat down for dinner. Dinner was a pumpkin soup with bread, salad, rice with enchilada casserole and an applesauce cake for dessert. The crew puts on a presentation while serving which is fun. I managed a half bowl of soup, small scoop of rice and enchilada only. After dinner headed outside for another presentation and then up to see the AMC acid rain monitoring station. Then went out to watch the sunset and then headed off to bed. 


Eating like this is not sustainable. If I can’t start eating better soon, I’ll probably take off the four days after the zero coming up. It’s very frustrating not knowing what the deal is. It seemed like things were getting better at the end of the triple zero but now I don’t know. At least the next two sections are only two days long so it’s also fairly easy to bail out if needed.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655581,"I was up a lot last night to pee, similar to the last time. However, I was actually hungry this morning. A bunch of thru hikers were gathered together for breakfast. Managed oatmeal, pancakes and eggs. After breakfast, Orchid and Pilgrim took off and I followed 10 minutes later. The crew puts on some skits in the morning and I left as they were starting. I caught up with Pilgrim on the way up and Beastmode caught me easily. Was focused on keeping the heart rate moderate to see if that helps after eating. At the top we beat the tourists up and got our photo op at the top. The building opened up and I took advantage while the others took off. I did a bunch of tourist pics and videos and left about 20 minutes later. 



The AT passes the cog railway and I saw the first three trains heading up. No mooning. A series of ups and downs followed to the Madison Spring hut where we were stopped for lunch. Pilgrim and I both made a wrong turn. Fortunately for me he was way ahead so I only did a little bit extra. I was feeling reasonably good considering yesterday. Orchid got to the hut a little before me, but she went over the presidential peaks which I skipped again. So far today the trail has simply been rocks. Some small easy to walk on and other larger ones you had to hop between. I think my feet touched dirt for only about 200m the entire morning. The one downside of the rocks is you have to constantly focus on the trail and your path through the rocks. It gets mentally tiring after a while.
I had switched to trying power bars, granola bars and snickers in the morning. I was actually a bit hungry and today’s soup was lentil and it was quite good. I had some bagel with it but couldn’t face peanut butter.  I had leapfrogged Squirrel for a little bit and she joined us for a little bit at lunch. 


After eating Orchid left and I followed 10 minutes later. Immediately we started a tough boulder scramble up Mt Madison. I stopped several times to get the HR down as it was a relatively steep climb. We were rewarded with 360 degree views from the top. Unfortunately, that also meant we could see the cairns going down Osgood Ridge’s rock scramble as part of the 3000+ feet we still had to drop. Overall while the descent was challenging and slow, it was mostly because the rocks are jagged, the path through them is not always obvious, and there is no room for error. There were only 2-3 spots that were more technically challenging where I ended up sitting to proceed to the next footing. I did stumble once and came close to pitching forward which would have meant a Hail Mary jump or face plant. It took me one hour to go from the summit to the tree line 1.2 miles away. 


Once in the woods again the terrain was better but the downhill was unrelenting. My quads were definitely burning as I got down to the bottom of the main descent. One more little hurrah thrown at us today was a roughly 500 ft climb just before crossing the Mt Washington Auto Road to keep the climbing legs in shape. After that the trail got cruisey and I made good time into Pinkham Notch. Not sure exactly when I finished, but at 6:14 I was taking a luxurious shower in the Joe Dodge Lodge. 


Was actually a bit hungry and ate a fair amount of dinner. I ended up eating a bunch of bars and snickers during the descent with some candy thrown in on the last 2 miles. Orchid got in about a half hour before me and Pilgrim got in around 2.5 hours later. We’d made up a plate of dinner but with a mix up at the visitor center another hiker got it. They ended up making him a nice sandwich instead. 


We all agreed that this was one of the hardest downhills we’ve had yet. Maybe not the most technical but unrelenting. Also fairly sure this is the most descent in a day so far  


Taking a planned zero tomorrow, but food intake today is promising.

As we left we went to sit in the Adirondack chairs where supposedly cell coverage is better. There was a woman sitting with her friends dog and we struck up a conversation. The two had been thru hiking but had gotten injured back in NY and were now doing trail magic for their tramily following them up the trail. We asked if she was going to Gorham or Conway and she offered to take Orchid and I for a resupply to the Walmart in Conway, about 30 minutes away. She’s Broadway (does costume design) and was the trail angel we needed today. Super nice and was awesome, even bringing us to the grocery store for items that Walmart didn’t have. 


Rest of the day was spent lounging around trying to eat and drink. I feel like I can get at least as many calories as I was at the start of the hike. I had three big meals today. Hopefully I’m reasonably close to calorie parity. Tomorrow we start a two day crossing of the Wildcats. Then we flip back for two days to make up the miles we all missed. If things are not going well, there will be some easy bail out points. But hopefully they won’t be needed.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655827,"Slept well last night for the first part of the night and then woke up a little early with some anxiety over the coming day. The breakfast at the lodge is really nice and I had a big breakfast consisting of French Toast, pancakes, bacon, eggs and yogurt. We got a trail sandwich to go for lunch and were on our way at about 7:20, with me being about 2 minutes behind. 


We had a little flatish trail around Lost Pond to warm up before starting the climb. We saw a sign warning of a dead and decaying moose but never saw one. Was afraid our first moose sighting would be a dead one. 



The Wildcat climb starts steep and just keeps on going. We climbed 2000 ft in 2 miles for roughly a 20% average grade. I wish the trail was categorized like bike races so you could brag about the climbs you have done. Either way, I stopped several times on the way up to rest and keep the HR under control. Legs are definitely a little bit sore from the big descent two days ago, but are handling the climb ok. This was a rocky climb and while it was not very technical it had some big steps and was unrelenting. Definitely still feeling like I am not handling the climbs like I used to. We got some good views here and there on the Wildcats. I passed Pilgrim, another AT NOBO and two overnight hikers all heading to the same shelter. Also got passed by a bunch of people, some of whom flew past.
At the top of the Wildcat D peak, which ended the first big climb, we came out to one of the Wildcat Ski Resorts ski lifts. There were some people doing maintenance on the lift but I’m not sure if it’s open during the summer for hiking or biking or just general maintenance. There is actually an AT information sign at the top. After that it’s a more gradual climb to the top of Wildcat Mt.   Throughout the entire climb was focusing on keeping the HR in check and working on trying to eat as much as possible. Got some bars, snickers and half the sandwich in. 


From there you can look way down in the valley to the Carter Notch Hut surrounded by two alpine lakes. Made the big climb down to the hut where we were stopping for lunch. Legs are feeling the descent and it was a combination of rocky terrain and dirt trail. The two lakes are really pretty and are set in such a picturesque setting. 


Stopped in the hut for some soup but they had Split Pea which I don’t like. Instead I had some of the leftover pancakes with real maple syrup. Chatted for a while with the crew member who was starting to cook dinner and found out more about the hut operation and crew responsibilities. Sounds like an amazing but hard job. 


Naturally there’s a climb immediately following a “Notch”. This was another long steep climb, 1500 ft in 1.2 miles. This was definitely a struggle and I stopped many times to catch my breath. Finally made it to the top of Carter Dome where I took a break and had a power bar and tried to eat some more. Following this were three more peaks, Mt Hight, South Carter Mt, and Middle Carter Mt with North Carter Mt being more of an arm of Middle Carter. Again we had some excellent views along the way. So far it’s been really clear in the Whites and the views have been spectacular. 


From there we had a roughly 1000 ft descent with some technical parts to get to the Imp Campsite. This is one of the ones that the AMC charges to stay at. Basically you are paying to have someone compost your poop. They basically have to empty the privy into composting stations and move the poop from one to another as it composts. Then at the end they have to pick all the trash, wipes and feminine products out of the clean compost before spreading out the sterile results. All while taking complaints from people who don’t want to pay $5 to camp. 


Lots of people at the shelter, both north and south bound but nobody we knew. I struggled to eat dinner and didn’t really get a good meal. Got to bed at a reasonable hour at least. Definitely a day that challenged me, but I was able to dig deep and finish somewhat strong. This was the highest vertical gain we’ve done so far. Could have gone longer but the struggle would have been real.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655829,"Actually slept pretty good last night despite the snoring shelter mates. The one sleeping next to me actually flipped around in the middle of the night and I didn’t even hear him do that. Got up once at 4:30 to pee and didn’t even fall out of the upper story trying to get down in the dark. Had a pretty good breakfast eating the normal amount of stuff. However, was getting hungry on the hike so I ate a bunch of bars in the morning. 


We had one climb to o start the day and then after we passed Mt Mariah it was a long steady descent down to the pickup point. The closer to the parking lot, the nicer the trail got and at the end it was a nice flat dirt trail. The three of us hiked together all day, which we haven’t done in a little while. Pace was a little slower than Orchid and I usually do ( well until recently for me) but we had fun chit chatting and being silly on the way down. Got to the bottom early, and Cowboy was at the bottom also waiting for a ride. Talked with him for a while until Orchid’s dad showed up in his Tesla. He was in the area for a guys weekend and drove us back to the Notch Hostel where we’ll be starting to fill in the missing 28 miles we all need. 


We had left resupply at the hostel but also headed out to get some more food and grab some Mexican Burritos on the hostel shuttle. RnR are here, they’re an older couple who hiked with Pilgrim a long time ago. They will be going out on the shuttle with us tomorrow. This makes night 5 total at the hostel.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655997,"Woke up and made some blueberry pancakes and ham steaks for breakfast. Unfortunately, Orchid brought the ham steaks up to the kitchen and so I completely forgot about the cheese in the downstairs fridge and didn’t bring it for this section. Got a pretty big breakfast so that’s good news and a continued improvement. The hostel has a regularly scheduled drop off at the Flume Gorge Visitor’s Center parking lot, and we caught the shuttle over to the missing 28 mile section along with RnR. The parking lot is about 9/10 of a mile from the AT, and it’s a steady uphill along a paved bike path to get back to the AT.


Immediately after getting back on the AT, there was a long climb up Mount Liberty. This was a steep climb, 2800 ft over just about 3 miles, and I struggled quite a bit going up the hill. I had to stop several times and was struggling to make 1mph pace. Orchid was ahead of me and Pilgrim was behind me. There was water about 7/8 of the way up at the Liberty Springs Campsite from an ice cold spring. I had started with just enough water to get here, and I stopped to fill up all my water bottles including an extra one since there is limited water during the day. This meant that I was carrying almost 7 pounds of water leaving the spring. At the top of the climb, I took the blue blaze trail up to the actual peak of Mount Liberty. Had some excellent views at the peak. It looks like Orchid and I passed on the trail to Mount Liberty but never saw each other.


Following that there was a relatively flat section hiking over towards Franconia Ridge and I stopped for lunch in that section. Pilgrim passed me while I was eating lunch and then I caught him as we got to the ridge. Franconia Ridge goes over Little Haystack, Mount Lincoln, and Mount Lafayette. It’s an absolutely spectacular trail along the ridge between these mountains. It looks like it’s some thing out of The hobbit movie or similar settlng. It’s really hard to describe how beautiful it was up there and the views that we had of the surrounding area. Pilgrim and I hiked together for a while along the ridge, stopping a bunch to take pictures and admire the view. He stopped to eat lunch on Mount Lincoln and I headed up to the top of Mount Lafayette. So far I think Franconia Ridge has been my favorite short section of trail. It helps that the weather has been clear every day in the whites.



The descent from Mount Lafayette was steep, with some bigger drops, and I hiked a bunch of it with Polaris. There was one last hurrah, another climb up to the top of Mount Garfield. I took the blue blaze trail to climb to the peak of the mountain where there used to be a fire tower. The views continue to be spectacular and it just doesn’t get old. Two hikers were staying up there but they had to carry up 3 liters of water. There was a gray bird flying around that would actually land in your hand. It landed on one of the other hikers although it didn’t land in mine.
Pretty steep descent from Garfield Mountain down to the shelter turn off where was the water source. I filled up all the water bottles and the bladder at the shelter was fairly far down the trail. Stayed in the upper part of the shelter last night, which was just long enough for my sleeping pad and pillow. Hopefully I won’t fall out while climbing out in the middle of the night. I don’t understand why they don’t make the upper part of the Shelter just a little bit longer so you can squeeze past to get to the latter. Weebles, Cholula, and Chum were there and it was great to catch up with them since we saw them last in NY. Turns out they know Polaris as well. We also ran into Sasquath, Timber and Rocket who we last saw at the Tumbling Run Shelter at the end of their first week before they got trail names. It’s only because we’re filling in this section that we got to see them since we’re effectively 4 days ahead of them.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655998,"I tried some changes to breakfast, adding both hemp seeds and olive oil to my poutine oatmeal. Unfortunately this makes the pot greasy and the oatmeal doesn’t really absorb the oil. In addition, my system didn’t really tolerate this well so I’m not sure I will continue with the olive oil at breakfast. Felt very discombobulated this morning and got out of camp about 30 minutes after Pilgrim and Orchid. At one point I lost my toothbrush bag for about 10 minutes because I put it someplace stupid.


Leaving camp we had a steep descent that was partially in a stream and waterfall. The water source for the camp goes down the middle of the trail for quite a while in a steep section which makes it slippery and tricky to get down. Fortunately I did not have too many issues with slipping, but definitely had to watch the footing and which rocks you stepped on. 


2.1 miles into the day I hit the 1000 mile mark and I stopped to create a marker and take pictures. Hard to believe that it’s been 1000 miles since I started in Shenandoah but it’s been an incredible journey so far. I am absolutely glad I took the leap of faith and that I’m on this journey. It’s been one heck of an experience. 


Not long after, I had to make a dash into the woods as breakfast came out with a whoosh. Fortunately, although the trail is rocky there were places to go off trail which is not always the case. It’s not the going problem that makes pooping in the woods challenging, but the finding of a spot that is private and where you can dig a hole.


I stopped at the Galehead Hut for a desserty item and to top of the water bottles. I had an excellent blueberry cake. I spotted an inflatable pool behind the hut for the crew. It’s not clear if they get to heat the water or if they just use the sun to warm it up.


Coming out of Galehead Hut there’s 1000 foot climb to the top of South Twin Mountain. I caught Pilgrim about 3/4 of the way up the mountain and we hiked together for the remaining portion. Sasquatch and timber passed us on the climb and I found out Timber got his trail name from stepping on a rattlesnake. There were quite a few hikers at the top, including Polaris, and we spent a while just relaxing and taking in the views before it got too hot in the sun. 


Coming down from South Twin Mountain we started the Zealand traverse and headed over towards Mount Guyot. I end up climbing to the peak but it turns out it’s not a 4K mountain, even though it’s over 4000 feet. After that we headed up and over the ridge and started down towards the Zealand Hut. On the way I missed the turn off for the summit of Zealand mountain, but headed out to the Zealand cliffs which had excellent views out into the Pemigewasset Wilderness. You could actually see the trail across the way where it was cut on the side of the mountain. It probably followed an old logging railroad path as about a century ago all this land had been clear cut before becoming a national forest. 


It’s a relatively long descent down to the Zealand hut by Zeeland Falls where I stopped in the hut for a bowl of soup and my second pastry item of the day. In addition, there was some trail magic that had been carried up about 2 miles from the trail head and I got a doughnut as well. I ended up being there for almost 1 1/2 hours as it took me a while to finish eating everything. Afterwards it was a small descent until we started the flat section of trail to get to the shelter tonight. Much of that 5 miles was flat trail with no rocks and it was nice to be able to make good time for a change.


We’re staying at the Ethan Pond shelter which is just uphill from the actual pond. Some hikers had spotted a moose earlier in the day, but we were not so lucky. For dinner I borrowed Pilgrim‘s stove and had a hot meal which was a little bit easier to eat then the cold soaked version. However, wasn’t that hungry so I’ll be carrying out some Ramen. Got to bed early as we’re getting up earlier than usual to make it down to the route 302 parking lot for a pick up in the morning.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656000,"Today we have a pickup from my uncle who lives in NH at the Rt 302 road crossing. From there the plan was to get some town food, resupply, and head back out from about 7 more miles to the next shelter. It was a relatively easy descent down to the trailhead with the last part on the access road. We got there early and a couple of minutes later my Uncle Peter arrived. As we’re getting back on in Gorham we headed there. Found the White Mountain Cafe and bookstore which had delicious breakfast sandwiches. While eating we tossed around some options as we weren’t eager to get back on trail today. Eventually we decided to spend the night with my Aunt and Uncle after working on an updated plan to get to the next resupply point. 


We headed to their house stopping on the way for ice for Pilgrim’s ankle. My aunt Elaine was at the store and I got to surprise her with our visit. We continued to the house for shower and laundry before heading out to the local cafe for lunch. After lunch Elaine took us to North Conway (same town we went to from Joe Dodge Lodge) for the resupply. Returning home we sorted and packed up food and I also switched back to my original backpack which has now been repaired. 


We swapped trail stories and caught up with my aunt and uncle. As usual the resupply day was packed full and had very little free time or time to catch up with social media. I did upload movies and pictures to my sister but that’s about it. We all had a great visit and thank you for everything that you did for us!

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656018,"Even after everything I ate yesterday, I was hungry and I ate a good breakfast today having both oatmeal and a breakfast sandwich. After we finished packing up, Peter drove us to the Rt 2 trailhead where we are now basically caught up and heading north (except for the Kinsman range I missed). Today will mark the end of the White Mountain National Forest as we’ll cross out of the park a couple miles in.
We started with a short road walk to warm up and then started climbing up into the Mahoosuc mountains where the AT shares with the Mahoosuc trail. I did well on the climb and was able to keep pace with Orchid again, although the trail was not as steep as some of the recent climbs. However, it’s a start and I’m hoping that I have turned a corner and am back. The AT shares a long distance with the Mahoosuc trail which is roughly 30 miles long and includes the Mahoosuc Notch which we’ll do in a couple of days. 


I ate most of the snacks in my snack pouch early on and we stopped for lunch and I was able to eat a full lunch. After we finished eating, Orchid was leading and shortly ahead of me when she stepped wrong on an unstable bog bridge and took a bad fall landing hard on her forearm. She broke her watch band and pole but fortunately nothing else. It just reminds us that we are one misstep from potentially hike ending injury. On average I’d say I misstep once a day rolling the ankle where you have to stop and take stock to see if everything is still working. Still not sure how none of them have done any damage. Sometimes flat trails are the worst as you’re not constantly looking down watching your step. Currently, illness aside, body is holding up well. 



This is another section of trail that is dry with many of the seasonal and even reliable water sources not flowing and those that are flowing are often a trickle. I’ve started to carry a third water bottle so I can carry about 2.7 liters overall. Much of Maine is in a level 1 or 2 drought. It looks like the section that the AT goes through is likely mostly level 1. As much as rain can be annoying, it’s badly needed here. The good source at the shelter is dry and so we’re carrying in water from about .3 away.
At camp there were three women out doing survey work for a trail reroute. Once a reroute is proposed a number of people get involved behind the scenes. Two of them were biologists and one an anthropologist and they are looking for endangered species (plants and animals) and historical sites. They indicated that there can be upwards of 8 people in some of the reroute planning groups. Two of them are full time and the other was seasonal working for an organization that escapes me now but something like the forest service. It gives a new appreciation for all the work that goes on behind the scenes. And that’s just for trail work, not even counting all the shelter and campsite improvements we’ve seen.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656019,"It’s another dry day with a single water source today and I started with all three bottles full anticipating the building heat. All three of us hiked together in the morning which we haven’t done for a while. We had about 1500 feet of climbing to start the day to the summit of Mt Success. We continue to have excellent views and good weather if a bit hazy at times. We then had a and a gradual descent down to the NH/ME border where we crossed into Maine. For Pilgrim this marks the last state while Orchid and I notched our 9th state. We celebrated with… well nothing as it’s the middle of the resupply. 


After crossing the border, Orchid and I pressed on together with Pilgrim following. We summited Goose Eye West, East and North. Some of these had some sections of bouldering, but there was nothing incredibly difficult although they were pretty steep. We did come across the occasional ladder (typically wood either 2x’s or from logs) and rebar epoxied into the rock. It’s giving us a taste of what’s to come in the Notch. This was a planned shorter day, although it still had a lot of climbing, to position us for entering the notch in the morning. Even though it was a shorter day it still took us about 7.5 hours to cover the 9.6 miles. The days when we could average 2mph over the entire day with breaks are long gone. Now it’s more like 1mph uphill and 1.3 overall for the day. 


Our clothes were only slightly damp this morning but the sweat was pouring off me all day. By the time we got to camp there wasn’t a dry spot on my shirt and the shorts were not far off. Unfortunately, although we hung stuff on a line, it’s still damp. Stuff doesn’t tend to dry at all overnight but as we’re going to bed with a threat of rain overnight can’t leave it out… although can’t get much wetter and a shower would at least make it smell better.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656021,"We shared the shelter with a group of four that woke up at 5 AM and started making a lot of noise and talking. So as a result we ended up getting up relatively early compared to what we usually do, and making it out of camp by 6:30 AM. We all left camp together and started the descent into the Mahoosuc Notch. Orchid and I slowly pulled ahead of Pilgrim on the way down. This is billed as the hardest most fun mile on the AT. It’s basically a boulder Jenga puzzle where you figure out how to go over or under the various boulders.


It turns out to be a lot of fun and I thoroughly enjoyed picking my way through The Notch. One plus of The Notch is the temperature was a good 10° colder down in The Notch than just 20 feet above it. We even spotted ice in several of the deep crevices at the beginning of August! It probably took Orchid and I about 1 to 1 1/2 hours to make our way through, although some of that was deciding which way the trail actually went, as sometimes it was not clear.


For the most part, Orchid and I did just fine in the Notch, but she did fall once leaving behind some skin. We also definitely got the occasional scrape crawling underneath boulders through tight crevices. There were only two spots were we had to take off our packs and pull them through behind us as we crawled through a tight opening. 


After the fun of The Notch, we had the agony of climbing Mahoosuc Arm which was a steep long uphill that reminded me of the Wildcats although with more steep ledge climbing involved. Although it was challenging, I was at least able to maintain just over a 1 mph pace. At the point we got to the top of the arm, based on our current overall pace it was looking like it was going to be more than a 12 hour day. We still had a bunch of climbing and descending left over almost half the mileage left.


As we continued on we walked around Spec Pond  and went to the shelter there to get water for climbing over Old Spec Mountain. There we saw Just Tom who we last saw at Joe Dodge Lodge the day we left. As we started the climb up Old Spec Mountain we started hearing thunder. At that point we were just coming out of the trees looking at at least a quarter-mile of exposed ridge climbing with only the short alpine trees around us with the storm bearing down on us. Looking at the radar it looked like we could not outrun the storm and that the storm would pass after a short time so we backtracked about 100m into the deeper woods to wait out the storm. Fortunately for us the thunderstorm seemed to fizzle and we really didn’t get much lightning and only a small amount of rain. However this was just enough to make all the rocks slippery.


We finished the climb but decided to skip the fire tower as we were hearing thunder again. The descent down to Rt 26 was tricky with the wet rocks. We made good time although not as fast as we could have. There was one last big climb to get up to the shelter. This climb tasked me, coming at the end of the day. I had to dig deep to keep pushing up to the shelter. Was definitely a hard day with the humidity today. Basically we spent the entire day sweating from the moment we started climbing the Mahoosuc Arm. It took us almost 10.5 hours to cover the 12 miles. Based on the time we got to camp we knew nothing was going to dry again. Pilgrim came into camp about 7:45 totally spent. It looks like the cumulative miles and difficulty of the Whites and Maine is catching up with him. We’ve got a nero coming up so we’ll see what happens after that. Orchid and I are definitely tired at the end of the day but we’re bouncing back better overnight.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656323,"We started off with a climb up to Baldpate West and then a dip and back up to Baldpate East. The climb up to Baldpate West wasn’t too bad but the top was still fogged in. Starting in the dip we started to get ladders and the the climb up to the top of Baldpate East was on lots of steep slab as it’s a bald. The top of East was still partially fogged in but we did have some views down into the valley and to the surrounding mountains as the fog blew in and out. Following that was a long descent to our lunch spot in a nice cold brook for a cooling off foot soak on this warm humid day. 


Unfortunately, immediately after lunch we started another long climb and fairly quickly were just as hot and sweaty as before. We summited Wyman Mt and then took another break at the shelter near the top. Another long descent brought us down to Sawyer Brook where we were camping at an established site by the brook. Although today was only moderately hard, on those days that are warmer and especially humid the weather really saps your energy. 



The humidity today reached sole crushing levels. When combined with the higher temperature and the level of effort in climbing up the hills, the sweat was just pouring off me. Even though I was stopping to wipe the sweat off my face every 5 minutes, I still had sweat constantly dripping off my nose and eyes. I feel like I am leaving little salt lick’s for the bugs with every drop that falls off me. The sweat rag has reached it’s holding capacity even though I am wringing it out and I don’t know if it’s helping or just moving it around. There’s not a dry spot on my hiking clothes and I know that there’s nothing I can do to dry the clothes overnight.
We also had a bit of a change today when we went through a deciduous forest that looked like it belonged in the NJ to CT region than in Maine. I really love the look of the moss covered forests but it’s also nice to have the occasional change as well.

To make sure we have plenty of time we decided to leave camp at 6. This means waking up and starting to pack up in the dark. For a while the later sunrise and earlier sunset wasn’t too noticeable, but over the past week it’s become obvious as we’ve started packing up in the dark and finished all our camp chores and gotten into our tents when it’s actually dark out. We’ve started looking for bear hang locations and throwing the rope as soon as we get to camp so we don’t have to do it in the dark. 


Everything is still just as wet today as it was last night. It’s really hard to put cold wet sweat soaked clothes back on. At least the sleeping clothes are relatively clean and dry but you don’t want to hike in those. I’ve got one hiking outfit but two pairs of underwear and hiking socks I alternate but both pairs are soaked so we ones it is. 


Orchid and I pushed hard and got up the mountain in just about an hour and the descent was very cruisy and we were down at the pickup point by 7:45 where we found trail magic being hosted by I Will. He was making breakfast sandwiches and I had one with some bacon for second lunch as I was definitely still hungry. Great guy and although the timing wasn’t great (we’re getting town food today) it still hit the spot. 


We got our pickup and headed to the market for a resupply on the way to the Human Nature Hostel. I picked up another breakfast sandwich for third breakfast at the market. We had shipped some food to the hostel but I picked up a full resupply from the limited market options in case the box hadn’t been picked up from the post office. Fortunately it did arrive. Got a shower and laundry is being done for us. 


Plan for the rest of the day is sorting through the food, drying out damp gear, fixing gear, and relaxing. We got the meal option with the hostel and had a nice lunch and dinner. We also need to finalize our plans for next week and heading up to the hundred mile wilderness so we can plan for upcoming resupplies. Captain Crunch is here who we’ve camped with a couple of times along with Slice, Licorice, Ryan and his dog Ryder, and Lazarous.


I ended up doing well with the food this past section although possibly could have used slightly more. I finished all of the breakfast and most dinner (1/3 packet of potatoes and 1 tuna packet left). Ate all the snacks but could have used 1-2 more power bars and have some peanut butter left over. So I ate about 11+ of the 12 lbs of food I carried out. 3lbs of food per day doesn’t bode well for the upcoming food carries.

We took the 8 AM shuttle back to the trail head, with Captain Crunch stuck in the rear of the SUV. Once we got back to the trail head we said goodbye to our shuttle driver Patriot who is a trail angel with a big setup just across the road most days.

Certain rocks and most tree roots and bog bridges get really slick when wet. As a result we need to be really careful about where you place your feet. No views at the top as we were fogged in. So far Maine has been more miss than hit for the views-especially compared to the fantastic NH weather. 



The last couple of days we’ve been seeing a lot of moose poop all over the trail. Yesterday and today was especially prevalent with some of them appearing relatively recent. It appears that the moose like using the AT trail as well to get around the mountain. We’ll see poop on both sides of the peak so it looks like they are actually going up and over. Some of the terrain you wouldn’t think a moose would want to do, but it’s probably easier than walking through the dense pine trees. So far we have not seen any moose or any more moose tracks. In fact, about the only animals we see are chipmunks and squirrels.
We’d been seeing mushrooms but with the “wetter” weather recently there was an abundance of mushrooms today. For the most part ones we have seen before, but also the occasional new one. We’ve also been seeing lots of wild blueberries, mainly at the top of the bald mountains.


Over the past couple weeks we’ve been seeing about 6 to 12 SOBO hikers a day. Today we saw our first family with 4 kids looking like roughly middle school age. We passed our first one coming down Greylock in MA in early July and it built slowly. Most of these hikers this week started in mid to end of July so we figure it will start slowing down soon. We’ll see some of them after the flip but it’s hard to determine roughly which group is the most likely candidates. 


The rest of the day wasn’t too bad trail wise. We had a bunch of ridge walks along the top of Bemis Mountain which is somewhat bald. There were some tricky spots coming down, but mostly because they were still wet and slippery. I did slip and fall once. I thought I had caught myself on my hands but the pitch of the slope combined with the momentum of the pack sent me into a 360 roll. Fortunately was able to stop at one roll and the only thing hurt was my pride. Orchid and I got to camp at about 4:30 and got setup taking care for site selection with threat of rain. Pilgrim came in after us but was looking and feeling better than recent days so the nero helped. Although it wasn’t that hot the humidity was high and my clothes are damp but at least not soaked. A storm rolled through just as we were finishing up camp chores for the night, I was in the process of getting the bear bag hung. Fortunately I got in the tent before the heavy rain started although it didn’t last too long. 


We saw Paws today who we last saw on the Camp Moosilauke party night. He’s been hiking with Timex but fell a day behind after an on trail zero day.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656327,"We got some more light rain overnight and everything was slightly damp this morning. I tried putting the rain kilt over the sleeping bag to keep it dry but it had no real difference. The foot box ends up pressed against the tent overnight and gets damp from the condensation. Anything on top is just sandwiched between the tent and bag and isn’t really effective. We got packed up and on the trail at 7. 


Even though there were blue skies above us in the morning, around 7:45 it started to rain. I put the rain skirt on but kept the rain coat off at first. However it started to come down harder and I was getting slightly cold so I added the rain coat. We ended up walking for about 30 minutes in the rain before it let up. At that point it had rained enough to leave big puddles and mud on the trail. Clothes were damp (probably mostly sweat) but shoes and socks were soaked and wouldn’t really dry for the rest of the day. 



There was a bunch of ups and downs today but nothing really difficult. However, the humidity was high all day so nothing was really drying. This means that you are constantly focusing on your feet and where to place them to avoid slipping and falling. We spent a lot of time today up in the mossy forest which is really pretty. Not sure why but as the day progressed it felt really monotonous. Not sure if that was due to getting mentally tired, because the terrain didn’t vary much and we had no views m, or because I’m focused on getting to town put it’s taking too long to get there. It’s one of the few days that I was considering pulling out the head phones and listening to some music.
We stopped for lunch by a pond that had a bunch of canoes, life jackets and paddles. It’s not the first time we have seen boats stored by a pond in Maine. However these had the look of being put there for use by the hikers camping at the shelter. The terrain was really nice and we made good time over the last few miles after lunch. We passed some day hikers and were analyzing whether they would be the ones we could hitch with. We got to the road and although there were a lot of cars in the parking lot there wasn’t anyone there so we crossed the road and started trying to get a hitch. Traffic was sparse so we had to wait a little while but we got a hitch from the eighth car. It was a mother and daughter from Michigan on vacation and out on a moose hunt. 


We got checked in to the Saddleback Inn and started the gear explosion that occurs in town with wet gear. No laundry but the front desk clerk was nice enough to throw our wet clothes in there dryer for us. We walked up to the IGA to do the resupply. Pilgrim got in around 5 having caught a ride from Strange Brew (who is part of the group of four we’ve been camping with recently) and his wife along with Paws. Went to eat at Sarges Sports Bar which was within an easy walk. Saw Timex, Paws and Bolt there. While they had good food, it took a while and we only had time to grab some ice cream before heading back to the room. We looked at the plan to Stratton and decided to push to the next shelter tomorrow and shorten the day into Stratton. 


We passed Birthday Girl today who is a 76 year old woman hiking the trail. She started in Georgia but had to flip up north a while back but is still hiking. I’m hoping I’ll be as spry when I’m her age. We also passed Paws who we hadn’t seen since the party night at Camp Moosilauke. He’s hiking with Timex who is zeroing at the Inn today. We’re also leapfrogging Bolt yesterday and today. 


One other thing that I have noticed over the past few days is that Maine is rooty, especially as you are going through the pine forests. It often means that even when the trail is flat you still have to watch your footing.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656328,"We got up a little later than usual and had a variety of microwave breakfasts as there was no close breakfast shop. Last night we changed the game plan for this section where we are doing more mikes today and tomorrow and having a shorter day into Stratton. Pilgrim still had to do his resupply today so Orchid and I set out a little before 8 as he was still organizing his food. We started walking up the hill to the IGA trying for a hitch. We didn’t need to wait long after getting to the IGA before catching a ride from a guidance counselor heading to his first day at a new school. We got dropped off at the trailhead and were on trail at 8:20. 


We started with a gradual climb up towards Saddleback Mt before reaching Eddy Pond which is my halfway point. It’s 1097.15 miles from Rockfish Gap at the southern entrance to Shenandoah National Park, and it’s 1097.15 miles to Springer Mountain via Mt Katahdin (and the missing Kinsman section). We took pictures with the sign I had made for the occasion. It’s a bit of a weird feeling. I’m excited that I’ve made it this far, but at the same time nothing is really changing and the “end” seems really far away - almost as far away as it did at the start. Still primarily focused on getting to the next resupply although planning is now starting to include the hundred mile wilderness and Mt Katahdin as there are many restrictions in place for climbing it. By my rough estimate, I’ve done about half the climbing so far and have walked about 2.2 million steps. A couple of miles later in the saddle of the mountain I hit 1100 miles as well and we ended up turning the celebration into our lunch spot. 


All morning we have had a heavy mist falling which has kept the rocks and terrain wet. Some overnight rain added to the puddles and mud pits on trail. There’s actually three peaks today, Saddleback Mt, The Horn, and Saddleback Junior. The climbs really weren’t too bad today with Saddleback Junior feeling like the worst one. Some rough sections on descent that were tricky in the wet but in general today wasn’t too bad. With the mist falling on and off for much of the day and the wind blowing it was occasionally cold if you weren’t working hard. We saw some nice ponds today but otherwise we had no views today aside from some brief glimpses into the valley around lunch when the clouds partially lifted and the sun came out briefly. 



The caretaker at the site had a huge list of frequently asked questions. Some items of interest are that the MATC (Maine Appalachian Trail Club) is trying to get away from bog bridges in favor of rock stepping stones, prefer not to bridge streams as the bridges get washed away, and they looked at multiple options for crossing the Kennebec River before deciding on enhanced ferry (via canoe) service.Hiked briefly with Bolt as well as Timex, Paws and Bald Eagle. Talus and Waffle passed through camp in the late afternoon but they’re pushing on. Lots of people here at the shelter tonight.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656345,"The morning passed uneventfully as we made our way up to Poplar Ridge and then down into the valley. The trail was relatively good and had few difficult spots and we made good time going down. At the bottom we came to Orberton stream which had several large rocks somewhat widely spaced. As I was crossing I missed stepping on the top ridge of one of them and having my foot slide off the rock. Fell hard on my butt on the rock but was still upright-ish sitting on the rock although one foot was submerged and the other briefly dunked. Managed to get up and across without getting further wet. Some good scrapes on my shim and likely a nice bruise but otherwise wasn’t too bad. Orchid, Timex and another hiker witnessed my fall and all made it across OK.
We found out later that Pilgrim fell in the same spot and ended up sitting in the water along with his pack. He got tangled up in his poles and it took him some time to get up and as a result a bunch of his equipment got soaked. Sounds like he’s probably got some bruises but is otherwise OK. He stopped early at the first campsite to dry out the equipment as it’s much heavier when wet. Fortunately his sleeping bag stayed dry. 


After the stream we started the climb up Lone Mt which was about 1700 feet over about 3 miles so it wasn’t too bad of a climb. We stopped halfway up to too off water bottles. For some reason the water in the streams today is flowing well compared to streams on previous days and there was not as much of an issue with water today. Partially up the remaining climb I had both poles in one hand as I climbed up a large step. What happened next is up for debate. Orchid claims the poles came backwards. I allege she moved into the poles. Regardless the tip of one pole caught the bridge of her nose narrowly missing her eye. Fortunately just a small nick. It highlights one of the dangers of being the trailing hiker following closely, although usually it’s a pole slipping on a rock that’s the dangerous aspect. 


We made it the rest of the way up Lone Mt and then onto Spaulding Mt where we eventually stopped for lunch at a viewpoint just before Sugarloaf Mt (and the ski resort). When we arrived everything was fogged in, but while we were eating the fog lifted and we got some good views once again. The AT doesn’t go over the top of Sugarloaf and with evening storms threatening we decided to skip the half mile climb up. However the trail turned as it made a steep technical descent down Sugarloaf Mt and we were rewarded with views of Mt Washington (about 70 miles away) and the Saddleback Ridge we climbed yesterday. 



The rest of the day passed uneventfully and Orchid and I made it to the planned campsite. We tried to setup both tents on a tent platform but mine takes up too much room to be able to fit both due to the large vestibule. Before dinner we walked up to the glacial cirque to check it out. There’s some open water left and we spotted moose tracks around it. We were hoping to come back closer to sunset but as we were eating we started hearing thunder and rushed to make sure everything was put away. We were pretty much almost done when it started to rain. Unfortunately the rain was light and short lived so looking like just enough to wet the rocks.
There is now less than 200 miles to go to Mt Katahdin and 80 miles until the hundred mile wilderness.Tomorrow is a nero (for Orchid and I, Pilgrim has an extra 6 miles) into Stratton ME where we’ll also take a zero.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656360,"The rain overnight was light and relatively brief and basically just enough to get everything wet but not help the water situation. Yesterday we did notice that only one of the water sources we crossed was dry which was a nice change. The one at camp was flowing well and ice cold although the second spring was dry. I meant to get up early and go back to the cirque but totally forgot to set the alarm early and Orchid and I just packed up as usual.Leaving camp we immediately started the climb up to South Crocker Mt. We got some views of the Bigelow’s which are the next mountains we climb on the way up. However the top of South Crocker and then North Crocker were fogged in. The climb to both wasn’t too bad although we did have one boulder field to cross. We then started the long 5.2 mile descent to the road crossing and town.


I recently had a birthday on trail… and nobody packed an ice cream cake out for me, or any cake for that matter. I must be old now as I fell twice on the descent. The first was a silly slow motion fall where I stopped next to a rock but leaned back and the momentum of the back combined with not being able to step back led me to basically sit down into the scrub pines. However I couldn’t get up with out removing my pack or getting pulled up by Orchid. The second I slipped down a massive tilted big rock. Fortunately landed on the pack but got my hand down and my shoulder is pretty sore (actually still sore close to bedtime). It’s things like this that cause you to spend 90% of the time staring down at the trail. 


Made it to the road crossing with Timex and Paws and a couple of other hikers. Called for a pickup from the Maine Roadhouse Hostel and got picked up about 15 minutes later. Got a shower and gear hung out to dry and headed back to town. Stratton is pretty small with a market, post office, General Store and a couple of Inns. Got lunch at the Backstrap Bar and Grill which was good but somewhat pricey and then picked up some groceries for the afternoon and to make dinner. Otherwise spent the rest of the day stuffing food in my belly and catching up on the growing backlog. 



The hostel is one of the nicer ones we’ve been in run by two Jen’s. The bunk platforms are larger than the mattress so there’s places to put your stuff and each one has a light, fan, multiple outlets and a privacy curtain. There’s two common rooms along with a kitchen and some nice outdoor seating. They also have a well stocked resupply. All in all highly recommended.
I meant to provide a food update yesterday but forgot. Here’s basically what I had during the day:
Breakfast: 3 packets protein oatmeal with Hemp seeds, Carnation Instant Breakfast packet and dried blueberries added. Half a Lenny & Larry Complete cookie
Snack AM: Luna Bar, Granola Bar, Snickers Bar
Lunch: PB&J on bagel with honey, other half complete cookie, several pieces of cheese, and handful of combos. 
Snack PM: Rice Krispy treat, handful of fruit snacks, twizzler bits and beef jerky and fig newton bar. 
Dinner: Box of couscous with Hemp seeds and olive oil added, 2 packets of tuna and a raspberry cheese danish

The hostel made a breakfast taco with eggs, beans, bacon, salsa etc that was really good. Did some more catch up and worked on plans for making up the missing Kinsman section. Went to the market and hostel store for resupply and sorted all the food. It weighs just under 13 pounds but I feel like I’ll be eating most of it. Maybe some snacks and PB&J leftover. Started packing up the backpack as everything is all pulled out as part of the drying effort.

Stuffed myself again and actually wasn’t hungry for morning snack until much closer to lunch time. I couldn’t close the food bag and the backpack top was barely closed with everything in it. The sleeping bag and pillow will compress some through the day so will actually be able to keep it closed later on. 


Orchid and I are heading out today, while Pilgrim is taking another zero day today. We’re heading to Monson, ME and the start of the hundred mile wilderness in four days where we are taking some time off and I will fill in the missing Kinsman section. We’ll meet back up with Pilgrim in Monson as we start the hundred mile wilderness. Orchid and I got on the shuttle (short school bus) which left about 8 and we were on trail about 8:20.


Today has a lot of climbing but it’s not as steep as other days. We’ve got 2600 feet up to South Horn but over 4 miles which isn’t bad. From there we only have smaller dips before we summit Bigelow West and Bigelow Avery named after Myron Avery “whose foresight leadership and diligence made possible the AT”. The weather is clear this morning so it looks like we will be getting some really good views for the first time in Maine. 


We passed by several ponds but closest to Horns Pond on the way up to South Horn where we got some good views of the ponds and over to the Bigelow peaks. BigelowWest is a rocky bald and we went down into the dip and then climbed back up to the peak. It was partly cloudy out, but the clouds were high in the sky, with a strong breeze so it was somewhat chilly on the summit. Aqua was eating on the summit and we briefly debated joining her but decided to eat in a sheltered location. There were great 360 degree views from the top. We were able to faintly see Mt Washington (78 miles away) and our first view of Mt Katahdin (Mama K 84 miles away). I hadn’t realized the Bigelows were basically in the middle of them. It’s still roughly 160 trail miles to Katahdin so there’s obviously a bunch of zig zags on the way. We also had great views down to Flagstaff Lake which is 30 miles long and wraps around the base of the mountains. 


We pressed on to Avery summit which had equally nice views as well as a plaque dedicated to Myron Avery and the stone base of an old fire tower. Afterwards we headed down to an overlook to eat a late lunch. 


Afterwards we headed down to the Little Bigelow shelter where we were the first to arrive. We’d leapfrogged Aqua, Bud and a couple of other hikers and it looks like they pressed on to Flagstaff Lake. We’d considered it but we’re tired and it’s getting a bit late. We decided to sleep in the shelter as there were not any mosquitoes. Puffer and 2x4 (a young couple) arrived and just as it was getting dark another young couple (Abby and ???) arrived. Both of these couples had been at the hostel with us, but they tented and cowboy camped so we had the shelter to ourselves.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656716,"The scheduled crossing of the Kennebec River happens between 9 and 2. Today’s goal is to position ourselves so that we can be at the ferry at 9. As a result we have a shorter day today and can relax a bit enroute. There’s a couple of ponds and lakes today but otherwise it’s a rather uneventful day.
Orchid and I departed at the usual 7 AM and we headed down to Flagstaff Lake about 3 miles away. Supposedly there is a beach on the lake that you can camp on but we didn’t spot it, although we really didn’t look hard. We did stop at the campground and I went wading in the water. Afterwards we headed to West Carry Pond where we had a snack on the dock by the Lean-to. 


Pressing on we came to East Carry Pond which had a nice beach where Puffer and 2x4 were getting ready to swim. There wasn’t much shade so we continued on and found a shady spot to eat lunch by the water. Both of us made sandwiches and then ate them wading in the water which had a shallow entry. After lunch I decided I would do my first real swim as the water wasn’t too cold. Had to walk out fairly far before I could actually swim, but I did get my head fully underwater and didn’t even scrape my legs on the bottom. Afterwards changed into dry underwear to prevent chafing issues and headed to the campsite on Pierce Pond which is actually really big. It’s about 4 miles from the Kennebec river. 


We’d decided to tent tonight due to some mosquitoes, which ended up being a good decision. A trio of southbound hikers showed up and started a fire in the fire pit in front of the shelter. It kept the mosquitoes away but did smoke the shelter out a bit. Orchid ended up somewhat close to the shelter and got some smoke but I was further away. We got there in time to actually lay clothes out in the sun and have them dry. Puffer and 2x4 arrived later but otherwise that was it. It looks like some of the other hikers we were leapfrogging are trying for stealth sites closer to the river. 


Tried to catch the sunset but it was partially obscured by clouds. As it got dark the Loons started singing. They have a couple of different calls but one reminds we of a eerie wail. They ended up singing on and off all night. I’ve been trying to remember to look at the stars after it gets dark. Despite some clouds they were quite impressive.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656717,"Immediately after leaving camp we had a stream to ford which didn’t have a dry crossing. We left our camp shoes on and made the short walk to the stream and walked across. I like the camp shoes but even though they are supposed to be water shoes they dry very slowly. However it’s still better than getting the hiking shoes wet. There was a convenient bench right after the crossing to sit and put your shoes on. 


We got to the Kennebec River just after 8:30 and found Aqua waiting. The official AT crossing is via the canoe ferry, which can hold two hikers, their backpacks and a dog, and takes about 5 minutes to cross. Hikers are discouraged from crossing on foot. This year the river is at one of its lowest levels. If you know where to cross it’s less than waist deep, but other places including the path the canoe takes are deeper. There’s also a dam upstream that releases water at unpredictable intervals. Every year there are hikers that try the crossing and are swept downstream and there is the occasional death. The ferry operator arrived at the opposite shore a little after 9 and brought the first two southbound hikers over. Aqua and I were on the first ferry back. She wanted to paddle so I sat in the middle and got a relaxing trip across. Orchid was by herself on the next trip as Puffer and 2x4 wanted to go together. 


Right after leaving the river you cross a road and go up into a trailhead parking lot. There we found Queen Diva who was offering blueberry pancakes and homemade zucchini bread with cream cheese. Can’t turn down pancakes so I had three while Orchid did the zucchini bread. We didn’t stay long as we still had a long day left and it was already 10 AM. 


When we came to the Pleasant Pond junction we had a decision to make. When we started the day we had about 41 miles to Monson. We had three choices: 22+ with another mountain today / 18+ tomorrow, 18 today / 22+ tomorrow, or 18 today / 16 tomorrow and do the last 6 miles the next day. I told Orchid that if we were doing the short day today then I wanted to swim. If we were trying for the long day then I would forgo the swim, but we wouldn’t do it if we were arriving after sunset. She decided we’d try for the long day and we’d decide if we could make it before dark when we got to the last shelter before the climb up and over the mountain. 



The climb over Pleasant Pond Mountain was 1000 feet in about 1.5 miles so shouldn’t have been that bad. However both Orchid and I struggled up the mountain a bit, although it could be related to trying for a faster pace. Afterwards the trail really got nice and we were able to make good time for many miles. It’s strange how the trail provides where on a day we were behind and needed good terrain it appeared.We got to the decision point at the last shelter well before 5 and in plenty of time to make the 22.5 mile day push. We were just finishing getting water and were getting ready to leave when it started to drizzle there was an unexpected thunderclap. We grabbed the rest of the stuff and speed walked to the shelter. Rain picked up for 10-15 minutes, just enough to get everything wet, but it never thundered again. 


After waiting in the shelter for about 20 minutes the rain stopped and the sun came out and we decided to head out. The climb up Moxie Bald had a similar elevation gain but over slightly longer distance. The top of the climb got a bit more technical but otherwise it wasn’t a bad climb. We took the side trail up to the actual peak which is somewhat bald and feels a bit like it’s in an alpine zone. From there looking back at the Bigelows about 20 miles away, they were partially obscured by the weather. However, looking north we got a good view of Katahdin, now about 60 miles away. We looked around the top a bit to see if we could find an established campsite as it would have been a nice spot for sunset and sunrise. We didn’t really spot anything except setting up on the uneven slab. Aqua arrived at the summit while we were having a snack just before we headed down to the shelter. Once we started down we basically were committing to hiking our longest day yet. 


Based off our recent experience, I’d assured Orchid we’d be able to get a spot in the shelter. Unfortunately I was wrong as it was already full and there were a lot of tents setup as well. We found a pretty nice level spot for two tents and got setup and ate dinner. We managed to setup our house and get most of the camp chores done before dark. Not sure if it’s the latest we’ve gotten to camp but certainly with the earlier sunset the closest to dark. Aqua arrived shortly after us and is camping nearby. As it got dark we started hearing the Loons again. They were active almost all night long.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656719,"Orchid and I both woke up early to the sound of chattering squirrels and things hitting the ground. Our best guess is that the squirrels were throwing pine cones at us. By the time we got out of the tent they had stopped so not sure exactly what it was. We headed down to the pond to look for moose and see if there would be a sunrise but it was already too overcast.  


After yesterday’s big day we still had 18 miles to get into Monson to Shaw’s Hiker Hostel where we are spending the night. The terrain today is relatively unremarkable, with minimal elevation gain, except for three wet water crossings. There is the treat of rain in the afternoon so either way we’re probably getting wet today. 





The first crossing had a bunch of mud flats before and after the stream, and the bottom of the stream was also supposed to be pretty mucky. Since my camp shoes are a bit loose I decided to keep my shoes on to make the crossing. We were able to mostly stay clean through the mud flats and then waded through the water which was not actually that muddy or mucky. I should have just done the camp shoes or at least taken taken my socks and insoles off before.The next crossing of the West Branch of the Piscataquis River was .4 miles further and we just walked through the water which wasn’t much more than knee deep on me. The bottom was very slippery though so you definitely want to make sure the dry bag liner is sealed well before doing any water crossing. Afterwards we wrung the excess water out of the socks before heading on. As we were heading out, Aqua came up to the river wearing crocs so clearly it would have been OK with the camp shoes. Live and learn.
At the final crossing of the East Branch of the Piscataquis River my shoes were drying out slightly so I opted to put on camp shoes. This one was lower thigh at the deepest part and I just got the bottom of the shorts wet as I didn’t roll them up. Certainly gives us some experience before the bigger water crossing in the hundred mile wilderness. I think that if the shoes are currently dry I’ll use the camp shoes, but if they are already wet it’s not worth the effort. I’ve heard there’s more wet trail in the wilderness so we’ll see. 


In the end my shoes and gators got the most muddy when I misinterpreted a comment about were there was good water at the shelter we stopped at for a snack. I thought 40 yards down hill from the spring and followed a bunch of footprints 3 mucky muddy steps down before deciding that was wrong. It was 40 yards down the AT instead. 


We got some afternoon drizzle but it really wasn’t bad under the tree canopy. We hiked with Aqua for a while, chatting about family and summit plans. Orchid and I stopped for a late lunch under some pine trees that was still dry despite the rain. We got to the parking lot about 3:30 and Orchid’s husband was scheduled to picking us up at 4:10 but we were able to find a dry place to sit. A bunch of southbound hikers came up to the lot while we were there, including Bolt who was slackpacking south today in the hundred mile wilderness which we didn’t even know was a possibility. 


We got picked up and headed to the hostel where we got checked in. I’m in a semi-private room with a southbound hiker Fungo who unfortunately has to head back home for a family emergency. We got showers and headed out for dinner. Tried for ice cream but the place closed at 7. Headed back to the hostel where we caught up with Grits, Timex, Paws, Beer Girl and Roller all of whom are here tonight. It’s bittersweet as it’s likely we’ll not see any of them again as they will summit a couple of days before us.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656752,"Today is the day for filling in the missing Kinsman section. I got up relatively early as it’s over an hour trip to get there. I was using my uncle’s truck so he didn’t have to make multiple trips or hang around for hours. I’m parking at the start and will get a shuttle back to the truck at the end of the day. The trip is mostly on the Kancamagus Highway which runs through the heart of the White Mountains and is quite beautiful and scenic. I arrived at the trailhead about 7:30, but didn’t get going until almost 8 by the time I registered the truck, went through the bathroom line full of thru hikers and did some video. 


It had rained hard yesterday and the trail was still pretty wet. I had hoped that it would dry out quickly with the sun and light breeze but there’s still some water flowing and it’s a bit humid still. The climb up to Mt Wolf isn’t too bad given the smaller elevation gain and longer distance. About 30 minutes in I hit my 1200 mile mark. Made my sign and then took some pictures. Spent waaaaaaay too much time trying to get me and the marker in the picture. Stopped at the top for a snack but the view was mostly overgrown. 


Afterwards there is a gradual descent for a couple of miles before you start the climb up   South Kinsman. The first part of the climb isn’t bad and it’s alongside the creek which is very pretty with lots of waterfalls. A southbound hiker Squid bait pulled out a recorder and briefly serenaded me on the climb. About halfway up came to a bog where the bog bridges were underwater and the only way through was to get wet and muddy. The second half was more technical but really wasn’t too bad and it didn’t take too long to reach the summit. Had great views, especially looking out to Franconia Ridge. This makes a perfect record in the White Mountains as far as weather and views goes. 


Went down the dip and back up North Kinsman where I sat on an overlook for a while eating a snack. There were a bunch of northbound hikers slackpacking out of the Notch Hostel. After about 15-20 minutes in the sun on the hot rocks was getting pretty hot so started down the mountain heading for Lonesome Lake Hut. This is my last AMC hut and I wanted to get one last desserty item. Turned out they had the applesauce cake which is really good. I was considering having the soup also but was approaching the estimated pickup time and dinner preparation at the hut and decided not to wait. This is one of the multiple buildings huts with main building, two bunkhouses and a bathroom. It’s right on the AT which is nice and the lake was beautiful. 


After the hut the trail gradually turned cruisy except for a couple of water crossings. Crossed under I93 and made it back to the Flume Gorge Bike Path completing the missing section. Got a shuttle back to the truck and made the drive back to the house. Door to door was a little over 13.5 hours and I didn’t have to drive any of it in the dark. Didn’t see any moose but did see moose poop.

Finished packing up food and pack before leaving. Did the last little bit of resupply from Shaw’s. Figured out the plan for next week as far as where to stay and when we are getting the resupply from Shaw’s. Met back up with Pilgrim and we’ll start with him tomorrow. 


Big Hungry, Relish, and Play-by-Play are here and we went out to dinner with them to catch up with them. Just Tom, Sasquatch and Timber are also here. There’s 40 people signed up for breakfast so it’s a full house.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657238,"Was in the main building bunkhouse last night, which has 7 beds but no bunks. Also at the hostel are Scavenger Princess and 3DM; Slice, Licorice, and Ryan and Ryder his dog from Human Nature Hostel; and Jem from Joe Dodge Lodge. I had the hostel breakfast which consists of bacon, three eggs, potatoes, and all the blueberry pancakes you can eat. After breakfast Orchid’s husband brought Pilgrim, Orchid and I back to the trailhead. I’ve done a good job of planning ahead :-) and I’m starting the hundred mile wilderness on day 100!


Although it’s remote, it’s not quite as inaccessible as the ATC and MATC indicate. There are logging roads through the wilderness although you have to pay to use them. At least two companies offer food drops and Shaws will slackpack you for three days as well. There even looks like the occasional trailhead accessed through the logging roads. There is even supposed to be cell service at the tops of some of the mountains. The three of us started together and caught up with the past week for the first couple of miles. We passed some ponds that looked promising from a moose standpoint but no luck and we weren’t really seeing much moose poop either. Otherwise the trail isn’t really much different than other parts of Maine, although we had more deciduous forests today and lots of mushrooms.
At the first water crossing we caught up with Jem, who we haven’t seen in a while (Note to Jem’s mom: She did, Hi, thank you, and she is in good spirits). It was possible to get across with dry feet but you were hopping on wet rocks. Orchid and I made it across dry while Jem opted to walk across in camp shoes. Following the river crossing we were walking along a ridge that was full of ledge and vertical slate. It felt somewhat like the start of NY. 


We’d decided to eat lunch on the far bank of the second river crossing. This was a wet crossing with no possibility of a dry rock hop. Jem had caught up with us just before the river and we all put on our camp shoes and made our way across. The rocks on the bottom were round and slippery, the current was moderately strong, and it’s difficult to see straight down into water to view the bottom. It made it tricky to get across but we all made it successfully. Jem was stopping for lunch also and we caught up. She left us with the intriguing question of what her husband did which we get to ponder until camp tonight. 


Leaving lunch we came to a railroad which I expect is used by the logging companies. As we were approaching, a pickup truck riding the rails passed us and then reversed and went back the way they came. Wasn’t close enough to see any markings on the truck and it never returned. We continued on until we came to the third and final river crossing. This was a wet one also and we put our camp shoes back on and made our way safely across. This was also a slippery crossing. I’ve learned from Pilgrim’s fall into the river to make sure the dry bag is folded over multiple times just in case of a fall. 


About a half mile later we grabbed water and headed up to the shelter. Jem, Jay Town, and then Pilgrim arrived and we’re all sharing the shelter. Couple others are tenting. Pilgrim regaled us with tales of his bear encounter (even though “they” say there are no bears in Maine). He had just crossed the second river and was eating a bunch of fruit snacks when an adolescent bear ( he thinks about 200 pounds) came charging out of the woods. His first thought was he had to take a picture, but his phone was in a zip lock bag in a pocket of the backpack and there was no time to pull it out. Instead he yelled No, You go away bear and the bear turned tail and complied. And in case you are wondering, yes we’re still hanging our food every night. 


We all chatted for a while and we were successful at guessing Jem’s husband’s job (which is really cool) but it’s very identifiable so you’ll just have to stay in suspense. Still dry when we went to sleep but rain is expected overnight.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657239,"It did rain last night. The shelter has a metal roof so the rain sounds loud but it’s hard to tell how much rain actually fell. There aren’t really puddles in front of the shelter. One annoying thing about peeing in the middle of the night in the rain is you have to put on all your rain gear as you don’t want to get your sleeping clothes wet. 


Right after camp we climbed Barren Mt which goes up, then flat then up again. Ironically it’s profile looks more like a chair than the Chairback’s we do later today. The first up was a bit of a struggle as my legs felt like molasses, but it really wasn’t a bad climb. The rest of the climbs of the Chairback’s and Columbus Mt today weren’t too bad. No views from Barren Mt but we got valley views and partial views of the mountains later in the day. The clouds were just sticking around on some of the taller Mountains coming up which was partially obscuring the views and preventing any long distance views. Most of the descents weren’t too bad, however the descent from Chairback Mt had some pretty tricky and technical spots through some boulder fields.


Early on a new trail reroute bypasses Chairback Fourth Mt but now takes you past the site of an old single engine plane crash. The plane is upside down, badly mangled, and missing the engine. But both occupants survived and walked out to help the next day. Right before the trail goes through Fourth Mt Bog which had a number of pitcher plants. 


Most of the day was uneventful, but the highlights of the day were the mushrooms. We saw tons of mushrooms including several new ones of different types and colors. Probably easily saw two dozen different kinds. All different shapes, sizes and colors. Also we saw our first newt in a long time. Little frogs are the newts of old as we see them all the time. 


Orchid and I are camped along the West Branch of the Pleasant River. It’s a wet crossing we’ll have to do in the morning. We have the site to ourselves. Pilgrim isn’t here but he was tentatively going to stay at the last shelter. We can’t figure out where all the hikers are. There were 40 people signed up for Shaws breakfast but only two hikers passed us yesterday and only three while we were in camp today. We’re not that fast so would have expected more people to have passed us. It’s odd. Anyway we get lulled to sleep by the sound of the river tonight.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657240,"Right after leaving camp we have to cross the West Branch of the Pleasant River which is not possible to do dry. Orchid and I both left camp in our camp shoes so we didn’t have to change at the river. The crossing was relatively easy although the rocks were slippery. Fortunately the current was not too bad. It’s usually possible to dry your feet reasonably well after a crossing so you don’t have to walk with damp feet. 


After crossing the river we came to The Hermitage, which is a section of old growth white pines. Apparently this is one of the last two old growth forests in the northeast which was originally preserved for ship masts. The trees are 150-200 years old. They are massive trees quite impressive when you are standing next to them looking up. 


Shortly afterwards we came to Gulf Hagas which is known as the Grand Canyon of Maine and one of Maine’s 14National Natural Landmarks. There is a five mile loop, the Gulf Hagas Rim Trail off the AT that walks past lots of waterfalls, cascades and gorges along the west branch of the Pleasant River. Unfortunately there was a wet crossing to start the side trail so we opted not to go down to the Screw Augur Falls which is the first waterfall off the rim trail. 


We started our climbing for the day alongside the Gulf Hagas Brook. This had its own series of small waterfalls and was a nice backdrop to the climb. We climbed over Gulf Hagas Mt, West Peak, and Hay Mt which weren’t too bad of a climb but didn’t really have any views from the top. We then climbed White Cap Mt in a heavy mist and fog. The top was somewhat bald but there were no views with the fog. We ate a little down from the top in a partially sheltered spot trying to wait for top to clear as the afternoon was supposed to turn partly sunny. 


After a while we gave up and started down. A little ways down there was an overlook which was below the cliuds and had good views into the valley and had partial views of the distant mountains. It wasn’t totally clear whether we could see Mama K or not as the mountain tops were obscured. 


At the bottom of the mountain we came across a cool moss forest. This was unusual as it was at a lower elevation than we are used to seeing them. This also meant that it wasn’t just pine trees in the area. All in all a very unusual and quite beautiful little micro environment. 


Relish, Play-by-Play, and Big Hungry arrived at camp after we’d eaten dinner. We caught up on their journey through the hundred mile wilderness and also got an update on Pilgrim. We’re also camping with pair of young women Andy and Kat and pair of young men Merlin and Fuzzy who are section hikers doing the hundred mile wilderness.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657241,"We left camp in our camp shoes today as there is a river crossing of the East Branch Pleasant River and it wasn’t clear if it could be done dry. Getting there we found a tricky dry route after bushwhacking 50m upstream. We both managed a dry crossing and bushwhacked back to the trail to put our shoes on. Shortly after that we started the climb up Little Boardman Mt which wasn’t that bad. We passed Crawford Pond Beach and then walked along Cooper Brook for several miles. 


We got to the Jo-Mary Rd resupply point about a half hour early right where it crosses Cooper Brook. Sasquatch was already there and all of us put out gear to dry in the sun. Some of it was on the wooden bridge railing and there was some panic when a big propane truck rumbled through shaking the bridge. The food drop arrived on time and we packed up the new food and dumped garbage. Relish, Play-By-Play and Big Hungry were doing their resupply at an earlier road crossing and we found out from the driver that Pilgrim managed to catch the driver there. It was quite a relief to know he got his food. 


We came to Mud Brook and looking at the crossing decided we could not do it dry. We stopped and changed into our camp shoes and carefully made our way across the slippery bottom which was full of larger rocks. The larger ones are much harder to navigate through than the smaller ones. Especially if you have to stand on one and then slip off the consequences are much worse. Also it’s more difficult to see the bottom right in front of you than several feet ahead which makes crossing even harder. After the crossing as we were putting our shoes back on, Sasquatch came up and managed a dry crossing. Starting off again we came to a second crossing. At first this one looked wet but after carefully looking we found a tricky dry crossing with a little bit of bushwhacking and all three of us made it across. 


When we arrived at the Antlers Campsite we decided to push on to get closer to tomorrow nights shelter due to the anticipated rain. Antlers is on Jo-Mary Pond and the AT walks around the pond passing two more sand beaches. It was nice out  today, the second beach was in full sun, and the water temperature wasn’t too bad. I decided that it would be a good day for another swim and to dry out some clothes. I got in the water and proceeded to do a little swimming and a little rubbing the stink and dirt off. Orchid was wading and with a little peer pressure I managed to get her “swimming” also by which she was fully under water if only briefly. I was glad I’d finally convinced her as I was starting to get cold and figured I didn’t have a chance if I wasn’t in the water. 


We got changed back into dry clothes and then spent a while hemming and hawing over the pros and cons of camping on the beach. In the end, practicality won out and we headed to the shelter about 2 miles away. We shared the shelter with Merlin and Fuzzy from last night but otherwise had the place to ourselves. This shelter has a 10 foot diameter artesian spring which the shelter is named after. 


PS Another hiker showed up around 10:15 and squeezed into the shelter. I never heard him arrive.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657242,"Forecast today is a rainy afternoon with thunderstorms starting around 4pm. As a result Orchid and I are planning to do a shorter 10 mile day to the second shelter to hunker down and wait out the storms. We also decided to leave earlier at 6:30 to give ourselves extra margin. 


On the way out of camp we stopped at the spring for water again. We had one deeper water crossing today but there were some rocks to cross and also a rotting log. Orchid did the rock crossing and mostly stayed dry, while I went across the log. It was pretty wiggly but I didn’t fall off and stayed dry. We walked along the Nahmakanta Stream and then Lake for much of the day but didn’t have to ford the stream which was moving rapidly in many areas. Instead we crossed several feeder streams but nothing that was too difficult to cross. 



There continue to be lots of mushrooms of all shapes, sizes and colors. The number of southbound hikers has tailed off but we’re still passing hikers that are just starting out. However we haven’t seen anyone that flipped up to Mt Katahdin and is going south now.We got to a beach on Nahmakanta Lake about a half mile before the shelter just after it started raining. I had been thinking about going wading as it was too chilly to go swimming. However, decided to press on to the shelter and claim our spots and come back later. We were the first ones there, but shortly afterwards lots of hikers, including Sasquatch, Timber, Merlin and Fuzzy, Atlas (we met at the Notch Hostel) and Trip showed up for lunch. The rain stopped as we were all eating lunch and they all pressed on. After sitting still for a while I got cold and bailed on going to the water. 


Basically passed the afternoon not doing much of anything except watching the lack of rain. I’m writing this at 8 PM and we’ve only had one brief sprinkle so far. 


Pilgrim caught up with us at the shelter and we swapped stories of the last two days. Two other Thru Hikers Conductor and Falcon (from Munich Germany) showed up and we’re five people in a six person shelter. Close to snuggly, but not quite. Andy and Kat from two nights ago are here and Andy started a fire. I think it’s only my second fire on trail. Chatting with Andy and Kat, Andy is having the time of her life but Kat not so much as the mental concentration of watching every footfall and not really being able to look around while hiking can be exhausting. I feel like I am a mix of both states.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657460,"So we got a sprinkle or two overnight but nothing really big and certainly I never heard any Thunder. Part of we wishes that we had continued on, but then we are all back together again. Apparently our tramily has been named The POD (Pilgrim Orchid Duckie), and we’ve been apart more than together these past two weeks. Leaving camp we had a climb up to Nesuntabunt Mt where we had views of Mt Katahdin but the top was shrouded in clouds. We were also looking down on Nahmakanta Lake and the entire scenery was quite beautiful and in a way peaceful. 
We descended and then walked around the smallish Crescent Pond which had lots of boats chained up to trees. I’m guessing that some of these ponds must have good fishing as well as somewhat easy access to a road. The boats we’ve seen tend to be the metal rowboat and the plastic canoe although there are some metal canoes. Sometimes you pass a road somewhat close to the pond, but in this case we don’t know where the closest road was. It is a bit odd to come around a bend and find a pond that appears in the middle of nowhere with boats on it. Some of the larger lakes and ponds we’ve walked along in Maine have had houses on them, although that is certainly rare in the wilderness.
After that today was another day of walking along streams and then a lake for quite a while, with first Pollywog Stream and then Rainbow Stream and Lake. We got to cross both of these streams on bridges, Pollywog on a road bridge and Rainbow on a pair of logs like a gymnast on a balance beam. I hit my 1300 mile mark right at the Rainbow stream crossing at the Rainbow Stream Lean-to, so we stopped to make a marker out of leaves, do the photo op, and filter water. We continued along the stream and then the Deadwaters before coming to the Rainbow Lake Dam where we stopped for lunch. The lake is managed by The Nature Conservancy and there were a bunch of boats chained up there as well. There were a bunch of signs indicating restrictions on fishing with live bait to prevent the spread of invasive fish on the lake. From what I can tell, fighting invasive plants and animals is a top priority of the clubs that maintain the trail. 
After a relaxing lunch, we walked along the lake for close to 5 mile before starting the climb up the Rainbow Ledges where we got very good views of Mt Katahdin without any clouds just about 9 miles away. We stopped for a while just soaking in the view. as this is one of the best  We’re not finishing on Mama K, but it still seems very surreal that I have made it this far and will be on the summit in 2 days if everything goes well. It wasn’t very late and Abol Bridge Campground, with showers and restaurant) is only 3.5 miles past the Hurd Brook Lean-to just 2.5 miles away. We had some discussion about pushing on, but in the end we decided that Pilgrim was expecting us at the Lean-to and made the decision to stop at the Lean-to. Orchid and I were the first ones there. We double filtered the water, setup our tents, checked out the pond, and were eating dinner when Pilgrim arrived. In the end it was just the three of us here tonight with Pilgrim the only one in the shelter. 
From the camp tonight, Mt Katahdin is 7.5 mikes away, but is still 18.5 miles by trail including the 5.2 climb to the summit. Our plan is to make it to Katahdin Stream Campground tomorrow and then summit the following day.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657461,"I woke up in the middle of the night to pee and put air in my air mattress which has had a slow leak for a while. Ironically so does Orchid’s and I woke her up enough for her to also put in air. I had a hard time falling back asleep - probably due to the excitement and anxiety over the climb up to Mt Katahdin. I had set the alarm about 15 minutes early so that I could walk down to the pond by the shelter to try to spot a moose but none were to be found. We finished packing up and then headed out towards Abol Bridge Campground where we planned to stop for some drinks and pastries. Unfortunately they only serve breakfast to those that stay in the campground but I ended up with a Cinnamon Bun as consolation.
The following paragraph will make more sense if you know that Governor Baxter left Baxter State Park to the citizens of Maine about 80 years ago with the stipulation that the park put Wilderness first and recreation second. As a result the park limits visitors and number of people who can submit per day. Parking lots at the trailheads hold roughly two dozen cars - not the hundreds of some of the popular day hikes on the AT. 
Shortly after leaving the store we came to the Baxter State Park entrance and the infamous Kiosk that induces great anxiety among Thru Hikers that want to stay in the park overnight. It is here that the first 12 hikers that show up can reserve a spot at The Birches Thru Hiker campsite. If you are not one of the first 12, the ranger at the kiosk will try to help find you a spot in the park, but there are no guarantees they will be able to do so. The Birches and Katahdin Stream Campground are basically at the start of the 5.2 mile Hunt Trail which is the trail the AT takes up to the summit. Some hikers will stop outside the park at Abol Bridge Campground and hike the extra 10 miles from there to the Hunt Trail. Other’s like us, have alternate plans that involve staying outside the park and driving back in the next day. Pilgrim is camping with his wife (who will summit with him) at a different campground within the park which is about a 45 minute drive away from the Hunt Trail trailhead. Orchid and I, along with her dad (who will summit with her), are staying with my parents at the Big Moose Inn outside the park. My dad stayed up until midnight two nights in a row to reserve a parking pass for tomorrow and the following day so we can get back in the park. The Inn is about an hour from the Hunt Trail trailhead but you have to go through the Baxster State Park entrance gate.
For the first six miles or so after the kiosk we really boogied to try to get to the Katahdin Stream Campground by noon when the park rangers go on lunch break. Even despite that we still took the side trails to check out the Big and Little Niagara Falls. After a while it became obvious that we were going to miss that target and we slowed way down to smell the roses. Coming into the day we were just planning to wing it and hope for the best with regards to getting out of the park and to the Big Moose Inn. However, Orchid wasn’t thrilled with that plan and her dad was arriving in Millinocket about noon so we arranged to have him pick us up in the park about 1:30. As a result we had almost two hours to go the last 3 miles. Orchid had read that there was a lake just off the trail that had canoes for rent and so we decided to take the detour and go paddling for a little bit. We easily found the canoes but it took some wandering around to discover they were self serve and you just dropped your payment off in a slot in the office. Neither of us had really paddled before so we looked a bit drunk as we weaved left and right going across the lake but we managed to make it to a great viewing spot of Mama K and even get a photo with us and the boat. Taking some pictures of the water lilies on the other hand resulted in some circles and running over the lily perhaps even more than once. We did manage to make it back to the dock and we didn’t even run into it. Baxter State Park is dry, in that it does not provide water spigots and so we got a refill from a family staying at the cabins at the lake.
After the paddling interlude we continued on to the Katahdin Stream Campground where we are meeting Orchid’s dad. As expected, we arrived at the campground while the ranger was out to lunch. We proceeded to eat lunch and Orchid also was soaking her feet in the ice cold Katahdin Stream. Just as we were starting to think about heading over to the Birches campsite to visit, Big Hungry, Relish and Play-by-Play walked up. It turns out that Big Hungry summited today, but the twins are summiting tomorrow. We spent a while congratulating Big Hungry and catching up with them. The twins are staying at the Birches and planning to summit starting at 5AM. Pilgrim arrived , followed shortly after by Orchid’s dad and then Pilgrim wife (who had tried to hike south on the AT to meet him but was directed to a shortcut and missed him). The three of us headed down to get our Katahdin Thru Hiking Permit. I’m the 1653 permit issued to all AT hikers and Pilgrim was NOBO hiker number 523. Orchid and I then headed off to the Big Moose Inn with her dad where my parents have rented a cabin and we’ll be staying tonight and tomorrow night. My parents were already checked in and we were able to grab some showers before heading into town for some laundry and food supplies for tomorrow. 
The five of us all went out to dinner and we regaled the parents with tall tales of our incredible feats on the trail. Well… perhaps we just answered all their pressing questions. When we got back from dinner, Orchid and I cooked breakfast sandwiches that we can quickly reheat. Tried to get an early bedtime as we are getting up early to be on the road by 5:30 tomorrow. Tomorrow’s weather on the summit looks good and we are going to summit then.

We arrived prior to the gate opening and waited in a line with about 20 other cars. When the gate opened at 6 they were directing you into two lanes - one for those with parking passes and one for those without passes who are hoping that there are no shows and they can get in.

We’d seen Just Tom in the parking lot and it turns out that my dad gave him a ride to the Abol trailhead which is how he is going up.
Shortly after we started we got passed by Atlas, Ryan, Sasquatch and Timber. The start of the trail is relatively easy but it quickly starts climbing. While you are below the tree line there are not too many technical spots, and those that exist are not much different than anything that NH and ME didn’t already through at us. We were definitely slower with Orchid’s dad but it was a lot of fun to hike with him and it’s very cool that she got to summit with him. Above tree line though, the terrain changed and there were more boulder scrambles and areas where you had to pull yourself up. Definitely more challenging, especially if you are shorter, but nothing terribly difficult. It felt a bit like Mahoosuc Notch where it might be harder but it was a lot of fun to do. We caught up to and passed Pilgrim  and his wife in this section. Looking forward and back you could see a steady stream of small groups of people heading up and down the mountain. It took a while to make it through this section, before we came to the plateau leading up to the summit. Throughout the day the summit was clear, but the day was very hazy so we were not able to see much past Whitecap Mountain. However, the views of the surrounding mountains and all the lakes in the valley were amazing.
The next mile or so had only a slight rise and had a pretty good trail. We were hoping to get water at the Thoreau Spring but the best water flow was down the middle of the trail and we spent some time trying to find the source or a better location before giving up. Pilgrim passed us back while we were looking. We saw several of the hikers we knew coming down from the summit during this stretch but we missed the twins. It was at this point that we firmed up our plans for going down the mountain and choose the Abol Trail. We didn’t want to go back the way we came and the Knife’s Edge was not in the cards for today.
The final half mile climbs up to the summit and the iconic Mt Katahdin sign. There were about two dozen people at the top but we didn’t have to wait long for our turn to take pictures on the sign. We got individual and group pictures and then proceed to eat lunch at the summit. it was windy, but I didn’t think that it was cold although there were a lot of people in puffies. It was definitely a little bit sad to be at the top. While this is not the end of my journey, it is the last time that I will likely see many of the people I have been hiking around and have grown to like. This adventure of mine has been amazing and I am having the time of my life, and one big aspect of that is the people that you meet and get to know. I’m definitely going to miss them.
Before I started down from the top I headed out on the Knife’s Edge for about 100m to take some pictures and see what it’s like. It has the feel of Mt Madison in the whites as far as the rocks go, but its spine is narrower but not scary narrow. Looking at it, it was not something the three of us should be doing today, but it’s been added to the Bucket List. We passed Pilgrim on the way down to the Abol Trail split and we said our final in person goodbyes. Slice had been at the summit with us and we hiked down much of the trail with her before we couldn’t keep up with her anymore. Abol Trail is shorter which means that it is just as steep as coming up the Hunt Trail. There were lots of places that we were scooting on our butts down a large boulder. It was also now in full sun and shielded from the wind and so it was getting pretty hot. It took well over an hour to go the first half mile. Eventually we made it back below tree line and we found a stream to top off our empty water bottles. Just after 4PM, 9 hours after we started, we reached the Abol trailhead and my dad waiting with the car. We hung out for a little bit before driving back to the Inn. The trail ends at the summit so you don’t get any credit for all the miles you have to walk to get back to the base… funny how that works.
A shower, dinner, and some preliminary packing rounded out the last full day in Maine. Another state has been completed and It is 22 days in ME without a Moose sighting and I’m not optimistic for tomorrow. This ends the northbound portion of my journey. I’m taking off a couple of days at home before flipping back to Rockfish Gap and starting the southbound leg.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657675,"I got to bed pretty late last night and set the alarm later than usual and then hit the snooze a couple of times so we got a pretty late start. After that it felt like a bit of a lazy morning and it took a while to make sure all the gear was packed up and make some last minute changes I thought of overnight. We didn’t leave the Airbnb until about 9. When we got to the Waffle House it was packed and we had to wait a couple minutes for a table. Fortunately they served pretty quickly so we left about 9:45 and were at the trail head around 10. We took a bunch of pictures and said our goodbyes and then with one last hug and kiss I was off south into the Blue Ridge Mountains. 


Almost immediately I noticed a big change, and that is the trail tread was actually very nice. It was mostly dirt for the 1st mile or two which is a welcome change from a lot of the trail in the last couple of weeks. Also, they believe in switchbacks and not just sending the trail straight up the mountain. Shortly after I started I got passed by a hiker we had seen in the parking lot EarlyBird. We hiked together for a little while and I got caught up on the trail status for things like water, animals, and people before I had to stop and adjust my shoes. 


Stopped for water and a snack at the first Shelter andcouas EarlyBird was there eating and got a couple other questions answered. He left and I finished eating. As I was leaving SpeedyG arrived and we ended up hiking together up Humpback Mt which climbs 1800 over 5 miles so it is not a bad climb and it had lots of switchbacks. Notably she is hiking while her wife LoLogistics meets her with a van and their trail cat MeowMagic. It started to rain close to the summit and I put on my rain skirt and after that we ended up mostly leapfrogging each other. I had gotten some views from lower elevations, but with the start of the rain the upper elevations were all fogged in even though the rain only lasted 45 minutes. As I got to the Blue Ridge Parkway road crossing SpeedyG was waiting and I stopped briefly to chat some more. Luckily for me,  LoLogistics pulled up and I got to meet MeowMagic who is a very pretty white and silver tabby. I got a couple of face scratches before MeowMagic decided to go off and do some exploring and try to figure out what was up with a little spring by the side of the road. She was actually pretty tolerant of a little yip yip dog that passed with some day hikers although she did fluff. 


Up until this point had passed 40ish day hikers mostly in 3 big groups, but after this only saw one other backpacker going north. Up until this point the trail had been pretty nice, but after this it felt like Jekyll and Hyde. You would have 200 m of nice trail followed by 200 m of wet rocky trail. It was definitely a lot more of a challenge and I slow down quite a bit.


It started to lightly rain about 1 mile before getting to the shelter, and I stopped to put on all my rain gear. I got to the shelter around 7:30 just before it got dark. There was one other person, Coach, in the shelter and he is also a southbound Flip Flopper. He’s 71 and has done the AT, PCT and CDT before - a good role model for me (sorry honey). The two of us ended up being the only ones at the shelter tonight. I managed to get everything set up, ate dinner, and hang the bear bag on the bear pole before it started to rain heavier. We got many hours of rain overnight. One slightly annoying thing is I swapped out my sleeping mat since it was losing air for the warmer one, but it’s much noisier and very loud every time I toss and turn.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657676,"Dawn is now after six, and with the limited sleep I got last night I set my alarm for 6 AM. I felt like a newbie again, as it took me almost 2 hours to get out of camp. Some of that is related to trying to pack up in the dark and not wake up coach. To start the day I climbed Three Ridges Mt which was only about a 1000 foot climb and really was not too bad. We got some nice views on the top, and I was a bit surprised to see lots of houses scattered among the Blue Ridge Mountains. It’s not clear if they are holdouts or live outside the park. 


From there I descended down to the Tye River, which is a big 3000 foot drop over six miles. Halfway down I stopped at a shelter for my first lunch and to try to dry some of the rain gear and clothes that were wet from yesterday. Unfortunately there was very little sun and only a small breeze and things didn’t get much drier. Coach and I ended up leapfrogging much of the morning.


After I crossed the river on a suspension bridge there was a big 3100 foot climb over 4 miles to get to the top of Priest Mountain. Aside from Katahdin this is the longest straight climb I’ve done so far although not the steepest pitch. The pitch of the trail wasn’t too steep and it had lots of switchbacks. The day was getting warm and very humid and I was soaked in sweat head to toe with sweat dripping off everywhere. About one third of the way up there was a cold creek, and I washed my shirt as it couldn’t get any wetter than it already was. Coach and I continued to leapfrog each other, which provided good motivation to keep trucking up the hill. Towards the top we got some nice views from a couple of overlooks. I keep my phone in my pants pocket, but my pants are so wet that the screen is also covered in sweat. There’s not a dry spot on my clothes or sweat rag and it was a struggle to dry the phone enough to be able to use it. Towards the top I passed Beer Girl, who we last saw up in New Hampshire. She just started the southbound leg of her flip-flop at this climb. At the top I stopped in at the priest shelter for a second lunch. Supposedly there is a logbook where people confess their sins, but I didn’t see one in the shelter. 


At this point I had about 6 miles left, which consisted of a bunch of small ups and downs. I’m definitely feeling the effects of two long days and not a lot of sleep. It definitely was a bit of a struggle and I had to work hard to keep up the pace. Despite this, I took the blue blaze trail to the top of Spy Rock which offered 360 degree views of the surrounding area. Unfortunately it was still somewhat hazy so I was not able to get any long distance views. I got to the shelter about 7 o’clock, which is earlier than last night. I’m happy with this given the 6400 up and 5500 down which is 2000 feet more up and down than yesterday. I managed to grab water, find a place to hang the bear bag, and eat dinner before it got dark. My shorts and shirt remain completely soaked and although they are hanging up in the light breeze, I don’t expect them to dry much overnight. This will be the second morning in the row I have to put on wet clothes. Coach and I spent a while chatting and it turns out that he saw a bear about 3 miles before camp, although technically just a bear butt as it ran away from him. I got to bed around nine, about 20 minutes earlier than last night.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657716,"After yesterdays excessively long packing up, I did much better today and got out in an hour and a half. It definitely takes a little bit longer to pack up in the dark, especially when you’re trying to not wake up the other person in the shelter. I’m still getting up about 15 minutes later than I had been on the northbound section. There’s still leaves close to 20 to 30 minutes before you can see without a headlamp. After leaving the shelter the trail did little ups and downs but generally was relatively flat. This is a nice change from the big climb and descent to start yesterday. There were lots of apple trees all along the trail and it seem like we must’ve been going through an old apple orchard or previous landowners had planted a lot of apple trees. Coach ended up eating quite a few apples and gathering some for tomorrow as well, but I’m always a little leery about eating things I find on trail.


Towards the end of the flat section we started going through a bunch of meadows which is a nice change of pace. This culminated with the climb up through the meadows to Cole Mountain. We were back into the forest for the dip and climb up to Bald Mountain. Coach and I ended up leapfrogging a bunch of this section. 


Following that we had a big descent over several miles to get down into the gap. Passed Spoon at the road crossing waiting for a ride. We followed the Brown Mountain Creek for a while until we came to the Brown Mountain Creek shelter. I stopped to get water here and make a decision about whether I was going to press on to an established site 6 miles ahead, or stay in the shelter due to the threat of rain and thunderstorms. Daddy Longlegs was already at the shelter and Coach and I walked in together. Since it was supposed to have been raining all afternoon I decided to continue on and push my luck. The other two decided to stay in the shelter and keep dry. I went over the creek on a bridge and then started doubting my decision when I almost stepped on a large black snake that I only saw at the last second when it moved. Fortunately not a poisonous one, but not a good omen either. The trail follows the creek for a while longer before zigging and zagging around the Lynchburg Reservoir. I was hoping that the established site might have access to the Reservoir for a little swim, but the site was away from the Reservoir and it appears to be off limits except for possibly fishing. 


I was able to find a site to set up my tent, hang the bear rope, and was eating dinner when I first started hearing rumbles of thunder. That storm passed by without any rain and I was in the tent getting ready for bed before any rain arrived. The site is mostly dirt but I was able to find some leaves to scatter around the edge of the tent to keep the splashing rain from covering the tent in mud. That’s the one downside of some of these established sites where people scrape all the leaf litter off the ground. Fortunately I don’t think I have to worry about water puddling under the tent but there’s a creek nearby so if it rains a whole lot I’ll have to watch for flooding. The sound of the creek also makes it a bit difficult to tell when it stops raining as rain on the trees sounds similar.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657734,"There was a bunch of rain overnight but the tent stayed dry and except for some mud splashing under the front entrance where I didn’t put leaves, the tent stayed pretty clean. I did get some condensation inside, but I had wiped down the inside of the tent when I got up in the middle of the night to pee and I also opened the mesh doors which seem to help. The mesh really seems to block airflow even though it looks like it shouldn’t. I ended up hitting the snooze a couple of times as a rain shower was coming through when I woke up and I decided I didn’t want to pack up in the rain and I was not in a rush. Although the rain stopped, the trees continue to drip for a while so I ate sitting in the tent with my legs out in the vestibule.I started out with a 2400 foot climb over six miles to the summit of Bluff Mountain. With the gradual climb and the switchbacks it was quite a pleasant morning except for the humidity. I made pretty good time and stopped for a snack at the summit. The views were in and out as the fog continued to blow past. Shortly after that I reached the 1400 mile mark. I’m now caught up with the southbound hikers but I couldn’t find a marker so I made my own and did the photo op. 


Some ups and downs later I came to Fullers Rocks which should have offered great views of the James River Valley. Instead I got glimpses through the fog while I ate lunch. I kept stalling as the sun started getting brighter and the fog seemed to be lifting but it didn’t ever clear. Eventually I had to leave to meet the Stanimals Hostel shuttle. About 10 minutes and 200 feet lower there were a series of vantage points that were fog free and offered great views of the river valley and surrounding areas. Stayed for a little bit before finishing the long descent into US501 and the hostel pick up. 




This Stanimals is smaller and there are only five of us here tonight, less than half full. Coach, a northbound couple, and a section hiker. I got my wet gear hung up, shower, laundry started and was chatting with the NOBO couple before Coach arrived. Coach and I headed down to the one restaurant in town and then headed across the street to resupply at the grocery store. It’s clear that they have a lot of hiker fare, but let the stock dwindle now that the northbound bubble is done. Had to make some substitutions but managed to get most items.
There was a carnival in town but given the late hour and full bellies we all decided to skip it. Finished up the rest of the town chores and cleaning up gear and packing up food. Worked on some social media and went to bed relatively late although don’t need to get up early. Saw six northbound hikers and passed two southbound hikers Goose and Gander as I was going into a shelter to get water.Steps 33400

I got to sleep “late” as Stanimals was providing blueberry pancakes for breakfast at 7:15. I finished packing up the bag and taking care of some last minute items. Stuffed myself with pancakes and then Coach and I were off in the shuttle to the trailhead. This time Charlie dropped us off at the trailhead a quarter mile north of the pickup point yesterday. When we pulled in LoLogistics and MeowMagic were still there, but SpeedyG had already started down the trail. I got some kitty pets in and then headed back to the other parking lot to connect my footsteps. My day almost ended early when I stepped off the side of the trail and came close to a big fall. Fortunately only my pride was wounded and nobody was around to witness. Interestingly, I discovered a bridge and a turn on the AT that I had missed when I got tunnel vision on the parking lot yesterday. 


Returning back to the original parking lot, I started over the James River Foot Bridge which is 1000 feet long and the longest foot bridge on the AT. Just like in Harpers Ferry there is a railroad bridge next to it. Although I have been hearing a lot of trains, none came through while we were near the bridge. 



The shelter was at the highest elevation of the day at just under 4000 feet. We generally had a gradual climb all day interspersed with some short descents. Overall it was an unremarkable day although we did get some nice views back to Fuller’s Rocks and into the Jefferson National Forest. There spring was dry at the shelter so I carried 3.5 liters from the last spring to the shelter which was about 3 miles and 1000 feet up. Got there in enough time to briefly hang up my clothes in the last but of sunshine. Coach and I leapfrogged again today and we have the shelter to ourselves again. I didn’t see any other southbound hikers and very few going north. Tonight is a full moon and it’s shining into the shelter. I woke up to pee around 2AM and heavy fog had rolled in so I also brought in all my clothes from the line.There are a couple of things that I have been noticing that are very different than the last stretch in NH and ME. The flies and Yellow Jackets are much worse although only during the middle of the day. it’s been hard to eat lunch without a bee trying to sample my sandwich also. There’s been a return of the wildflowers with most sections of the trail having at least some wildflowers although there are others where you are pushing through 3 foot tall plants crowding the trail. Still getting mushrooms also but not quite the variety. Seems like the spider webs across trail are more prevalent, although we are also the first ones through for much longer in the day. Stinging Nettle is a new threat and you know right away that you have encountered it. Fortunately it doesn’t burn for too long. Privies are back to being pit toilets, although most have been medium size and seem to have a big vault underneath. Also falling acorns are a distinct hazard. They really make a loud noise and bounce pretty good if they hit something hard. I expect they would really hurt if they hit me.
I noticed some leaves starting to change on one type of tree today. They were around 3000 feet so not very high, but not in the valley either. I was expecting that the season would have started in October and was a bit worried we might just keep ahead of the peak season as we travel south. Time will tell if we’re at the start or some trees were just confused.

Fortunately there wasn’t much fog in the shelter but everything is slightly damp. It was still really foggy as we left the shelter and it was sometimes slightly difficult to see where the trail went. We came out to the top of Apple Orchard Mountain where there is an FAA radar station dome. I stopped as I had some cell service and the sun was just starting to peak out behind the dome as I was leaving.Shortly after that is a rock formation known as the guillotine which has a rock hanging above the trail like a guillotine. Queue bad joke here… fortunately my head did not roll. 


With rain predicted in mid afternoon, at this point it was a race to the next shelter to see whether I could make it before the rain started. Unfortunately, I was making good time but was falling off the pace I expected I had to maintain to make it. We got the occasional view and I passed some hunters that were out training their bear hunting dogs and you could hear the dogs barking and chasing something with four legs through the woods for quite a while. Otherwise today was relatively uneventful. 


I pulled into a shelter shortly before 1 to eat lunch just as it was starting to drizzle. This was earlier than I anticipated, but at least I was eating lunch dry.  Previous hikers had made s campfire and it was still burning pretty well so I dumped a couple of bags of water on it from the nearby creek. The drizzle was light enough and the day warm enough that I didn’t put on any rain gear as it would have been too hot and I would have been wetter from sweat. A couple of miles later the rain picked up and I put on the rain kilt and then shortly after the rain jacket. Since I was already getting wet, I eased up on the pace. The Shelter tonight doesn’t have any water source so I’ll be carrying water up to the shelter again. Took closer to 3 liters this tine which is still pretty heavy. The rain was on and off and we had another big climb up to the shelter. I got to the shelter around 3:30. Coach was already there and the two of us were the only ones at the shelter again. Soon after we’d finished dinner the rain really started to pick up. I’d gotten the bear rope up but had to finish hanging in the rain. Looks like it’s going to be another foggy night as it’s already starting to look foggy as the sun sets.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658049,"Coach and I woke up to dense fog this morning. With the fog and the tree cover in the woods, dawn does not arrive until almost sunrise and it doesn’t get really light out until much past sunrise. This means that you have to pack up using your headlight, which makes things take a little bit longer in the morning. The fog also means that everything is just a little bit damp. It would stay foggy for much of the day, and there would be scattered showers throughout the day as well. None of the showers were very heavy, just enough to get me slightly damp and make you start to think about putting on the rain gear.


Shortly after we started I could hear the hunting dogs parking not far off the trail. I saw two of the hunting dogs coming down the trail, but as soon as they saw me, they darted off the trail towards the barking. However today I did not see the hunters themselves, but I did see the trucks parked at one trail head.


Most of the morning we spent crisscrossing the Blue Ridge Parkway. Crossing the road felt quite dangerous as you really couldn’t see very far in the fog. Fortunately there wasn’t much traffic on the road. One bonus of the Blue Ridge Parkway is that many of the overlooks have a trashcan so you can get rid of your trash so you don’t have to keep accumulating trash for the entire stretch. it’s not necessarily the weight of the trash but all the wrappers don’t pack down very well and so it’s somewhat bulky by the end of a four-day resupply.


Coach got to the shelter before me again today, although we did leapfrog each other a couple times in the morning. Tonight we’re sharing camp with a Section Hiker but it’s just us in the shelter. I really haven’t seen many people on the trails compared to up north. There have been one or two small groups of weekend and section hikers going northbound that we pass. We hear there’s about a half dozen southbound hikers in the general area. 




The shelter has the last remaining cistern water system on the Appalachian Trail. It collects rain water from the shelter roof and the system probably filters out the large particles before storing the water in an underground cistern. With the rain we’ve had recently I figured that the cistern probably has water, but we decided to carry up water for dinner and a little to drink in the morning since we’re going into Daleville tomorrow. A lot of the comments about the water have been that it’s brown or yellow. When we got there I let the water flow and it seemed reasonably clear to me, probably because of all the recent rain.
The sun finally came out after we got to the shelter and I hung up a clothesline. With the trees around the shelter we really only got a couple of minutes of sun and it didn’t really get things dry at all. There is also still some thin fog blowing through even despite the sunshine so it’s not clear things would dry even in the waining sun.


Tomorrow I nero into Daleville where I’ll be meeting Orchid. Looks like Coach will be joining us at the hostel. Coach is in his early 70’s and is already a triple crowner having done the AT, PCT and CDT over 10 years ago. This year he started with the Pinhoti Trail to the Benton MacKaye to the Appalachian Trail where he went north for a couple of hundred miles before flipping up. He’s currently heading south so he doesn’t have to go all the way to Springer Mt.

We had an easy four mile descent into town and the hostel we were staying at. I was in the lead as we hiked together and I was eating spider webs all the way down. The Bee Chill Hostel is just off the AT so it’s really easy to get to. 


We got there shortly after 8:15 and Orchid arrived about 30 minutes later. She has a borrowed car and the three of us headed out for breakfast at Cracker Barrel. When we got back we set out all of our wet gear to dry and took showers and did laundry. We finished working on the plan for next week so we could determine our resupply needs and then headed out to the post office to pickup my new shoes, Kroger grocery store and the outfitter store. We saw a southbound hiker Bloom at the outfitter and then again at the grocery store. She is just the ninth southbound hiker I have seen. 


Dropped everything off at the hostel and it was mid afternoon and time for some lunch at a local Mexican place. Following that we dropped the car off at Kroger and caught a ride back to the hostel with Beth the owner. 



The three of us spent a while chatting and relaxing before heating a late dinner at the hostel. I needed a repair to my pants pocket and Beth was able to make the repairs which was awesome. The hostel is still pretty new and they are still working on some areas but it’s a really nice hostel which also has some private B&B rooms and the owners are really nice.
Tomorrow Orchid will join me again although she has previously hiked the next 20 mile section northbound when she started.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658062,"The hostel provided a really nice baked egg casserole in the morning made from eggs from their chickens. After eating and finishing packing up Orchid and I headed back out on the trail about 10 minutes after Coach. Right where we got back on marks the 2/3 mark for southbound hikers. A mile later we had to cross US 220 which was surprisingly easy as there was a big gap in the traffic in both directions when we arrived.
We started the climb up to Hay Rock and the Monolith which is a rock formation that looks like a duck, in my opinion. On the way we had a lot of power line views, from multiple different transmission lines, back into Daleville. At one of the power lines, the lines were crackling louder than usual and if you put your arms up in the air you could feel the hairs on your arm moving around. Needless to say we didn’t stick around long. Once we got to Hay Rock and continued along the ridge the trail actually goes north as it makes a big semicircle around Carvin Cove Reservoir. We had some really nice views down into the large Reservoir to the West and Daleville and Troutville to the East. 


At the end of the semicircle is Tinker Cliffs which is a series of ledges that looks down into the valley below for some amazing views. You can see the mountain that McAfee knob is on, but not the knob itself. Tinker cliffs is the first of the Virginia Triple Crown which also includes McAfee Knob and Dragons Tooth. We had originally planned to camp here but decided to push on to the next shelter right before McAfee Knob and do sunset in the knob. It was a ridge walk to get there but it involved a lot of up and down. We arrived at camp a while after Coach and also found Bloom there as well. The four of us are in the shelter and a handful of overnight hikers are tenting.  This has been a day of reminiscing for Orchid as these were some of the first miles she did. 


We talked Bloom into coming up to the McAfee Knob to catch the sunset and grabbed dinner and started the .7 mile climb up to the knob. It was blowing pretty good at the top but we managed to get the photo ops in and cook dinner as the sun was setting. Coach popped up shortly before sunset as well. We got a pretty nice sunset from the actual knob itself as most of the rest of the open rocks had views blocked by trees. We didn’t stick around long after the sun set as it was getting chilly and we still needed to make the descent back to camp. Once there finished prepping for bed and making plans for an early departure. Looks like Coach and Bloom will be joining us tomorrow for sunrise.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658063,"After climbing up to McAfee Knob last night, we knew about how long it would take to get up there by the targeted 6:10 for the 7AM sunrise. Coach left shortly before Bloom, Orchid and I. As we were climbing we could already see a glow in the sky and there were already some nice colors just starting as we got to the too. We’d planned to eat up top but it was still really windy up there and we ended up nit eating. The sun was rising in a way to silhouette you when you were on the knob. We sat in a protected area on the knob watching the beautiful sunrise as well as taking a bunch of silhouette pictures and videos. It was absolutely worth waking up early to catch the sunrise and we had a perfect morning for one. After the sun was finally well above the horizon Bloom, Orchid and I headed to the next shelter for breakfast and water. 


Trailmix had been up top and he joined us as well. I had actually provided him with trail magic in Palmerton when Mrs Duckie came out to visit. After eating Bloom, Orchid and I started down to the parking lot where Orchid had started her Thru Hike. On the way we passed about a dozen day hikers heading up the mountain. Once the three of us passed the parking lot this ended Orchid’s “bonus“ miles and she’s now making progress towards Springer. 



The three of us spent time chatting as we walked some flatter sections and several pastures as we headed towards Dragon’s Tooth which will complete the Virginia Triple Crown. We passed a number of hikers doing a loop of the Triple Crown. The climb up to Dragon’s Tooth was steep and rocky and a bit exposed to the sun. We eventually made it and we climbed up the Dragons head for some great views down into the valley and out to McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. We even got some pictures through the Dragon’s eye. Apparently you can get sunrise pictures through the eye as well.
From there we had a long 7 mile descent to the established campsite by Trout Creek. Coach got there before us and it’s just the four of us tonight. Spent some time trying to get the bear bags hung but I still had time for a foot soak. My right foot is definitely feeling a bit creaky and my left knee is a bit sore at night but not while hiking. The four of us spent some more time chatting together before heading off into our tents. This is just the second time I’ve used my tent on the southbound journey.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658064,"Everyone woke up at 5:45 this morning to get out by 7 AM. At this time of the year it’s still dark in the woods until around 6:30ish so we’re all packing up with headlights now. Even finding a place to go to the bathroom in the morning is a bit more challenging. Today’s plan is a 21 mile day to stay at a shelter. Bloom, Orchid and I left camp a couple of minutes after Coach. 



The first part of the day was an uneventful 1500 foot climb and descent down to the next shelter. At the top of the climb all of us hit the 1500 mile mark. We didn’t see a marker again so we built one and took the necessary pictures. There was also a monument that we passed near to Audie Murphy who was the most decorated soldier of WWII and who died in a plane crash on the mountain.
We stopped at the shelter for water and first lunch. Immediately after we started the climb up to the Eastern Continental Divide. Water to the east flows 405 miles to the Atlantic Ocean on the James River. Water to the west flows 1920 miles to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. We were on the ridge for 5-6 miles which were some tough miles as the rocks were mostly slanted down the hill. We got some great views down into the valley but were also exposed to the sun for much of the walk. Although it wasn’t too hot, it was distinctly hotter in the sun baked rocks. I was joking that the sweat from my left eye was heading to the Atlantic and the sweat from my right eye was heading to the Gulf of Mexico. We eventually headed down and passed the Keffer Oak which is estimated to be 300 years old. It’s still alive but looks like it has seen better days. 


We stopped at a brook to get more water and eat second lunch before heading out on the final 3.5 miles oof the day. The first two miles were through a series of pastures with great views of the surrounding countryside and lots of wildflowers. It’s always a nice change of pace to go through the meadows even though the wild flowers are in full bloom and you often have to push through thickets if them overgrowing the trail. The downside is that the meadows are usually in full sun and we did them around 4 PM in the heat of the day. 


Bloom, Orchid and I hiked together again today and we spent much of the day chatting, playing the favorite game (movie, food, etc.), and making up a Limerick for Bloom. We ended up getting to camp around 5 so managed over 2 mph with stops. Coach beat us to camp by about 15 minutes. However, my right foot is definitely feeling the faster pace and longer miles I have been doing this past week and a half. I was hoping to get a foot soak in but ran out of time. The four of us are in the shelter. Two other northbound hikers arrived about 6:30 and another southbound hiker, Dr Weed (analyzes marijuana fora living) rolled in after dark. He’s the 10th SOBO that I’ve seen and tonight is the most Thru Hikers I’ve seen at a shelter since the flip.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658066,"I had to pee about 4:45 and that seemed to start a chain reaction of people getting up so we all ended up waking up early. Bloom took if early for the shelter past where Orchid and I plan to stay but we’ll likely see her tomorrow night at the hostel. Coach departed and Orchid and I followed shortly after. Started with one medium climb that wasn’t too bad followed by a descent that started getting a bit rocky. We topped off on water at the first shelter and I put some more Hiker Goo on my right big toe which felt like it’s trying to get a hit spot. 


Had a big climb up to the ridge where we’ll be walking for most of the afternoon. During the climb we started getting areas where the trail is overgrown with wildflowers and you have to push through them. It’s not too bad except that some of them have bees on them so you need to be a little careful. Somewhere along the way my pole got stuck in a crevice and was torqued sideways resulting in partially cracked carbon fiber. It’s still usable to hold up my tent with some repairs but not as a hiking pole until I get a replacement section. Once on the ridge we walked a little ways to a campsite with a nice little spring to ear lunch. Unfortunately the flies and an annoyingly persistent bee found us so it wasn’t all that relaxing and was shorter than desired. 


We got a nice view into the valley to the north as well as cell service where we were able to finalize hostel plans for tomorrow and the next day. Shortly after that we passed Bubbles and Onion going north from Springer. They’re doing a Flip Flop out of Rock Fish Gap but choose to finish there instead of Springer. We got some information on the upcoming trail and hostels from them. 


After passing them the trail turned rocky, Pennsylvania rocky, for about three miles but was made harder by the short ups and downs and twisty nature as it followed the ridge as well as the overgrown wildflowers. We finally left the ridge and the rocks behind and started our descent where we ran into coach at a shelter about 4 miles from camp. I took a minute to apply more Hiker Goo to my right bug toe and then we were off. The next miles were through Rhododendron glens and along creeks and were quite pretty. We eventually caught Coach and we all came into camp together. The last little small ups really kicked my butt and it was a struggle to maintain the pace as I was following Orchid at the time.


We got into camp just before 4PM which means we were just faster than the 2mph average pace we’ve been trying to meet for the entire day. Two seems somewhat magical but it’s one that we are generally able to hit or get close too and also leads to some easy math when estimating when you’ll get to a location. It’s a number that is used during planning as well as one that seems to be often in your head especially as you approach camp or town or are wanting a section to be over. This average includes both the walking and breaks so we’re actually walking between 1.8 and 3mph depending on the terrain and how long we’ve been hiking.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658072,"Got up at the usual time of 5:45 and it was pitch black out. Got packed up mostly in the dark. Around 6:30 there started to be enough light to see outside but the shelter was still pretty dark until just before we left. We had a good climb to start the day of 1300 feet over four miles so it wasn’t steep but it was pretty long. We got cell service on the top of the mountain and I spent some time working on getting a resupply box sent to an upcoming hostel as well as working on making hostel reservations for an upcoming hostel hop. 


Once we got up to the ridge we had a long ridge walk through lots of overgrown wildflowers and bushes. In addition, just to make things more complicated, there were long sections of Pennsylvania style rocks partially hidden by the brush. To add insult to injury, the trail also meanders quite a bit with little semi circle loops going briefly down the hill and then back up which makes it tough to maintain momentum. It’s also the type of terrain that is conducive to snakes but which makes it really hard to see them. You spend a lot of time watching your feet, checking for bees on the wildflowers and looking for snakes that you have to remember to work on making sure you are checking for blazes, looking around at the scenery and looking for bears. 


After one turn I popped out into a herd of six goats. I knew goats were in the general area and had been scanning for them but I didn’t see them until they moved right before I was on top of them. After the initial fright, on both our parts, they came over probably expecting to be fed -which we weren’t going to do. We got some pictures and videos and then continued on. The goats immediately started following us. As long as we were walking they were coming down the trail single file. If we stopped they’d bunch up and start eating, although not necessarily the brush hanging over the trail. This continued for 10 minutes or so. Found out later both Coach and Bloom saw the goats, but they weren’t followed. We caught up with Coach and hiked with him for a while until he pulled away after a brief stop by Orchid and I. 


We passed the shelter that Bloom was staying at for sunset and sunrise at the top of a bald. We’d been hovering around and at times briefly over the West Virginia state line and there were some good views into WV. Heading back into woods we started a long, very cruisy, descent with a great trail tread almost the entire way down into Pearisburg, VA. It was surprising how nice and different this section of trail was compared to the morning. We hiked a much of the first part with Coach and caught up with him for the last mile across the New River and through town. 


We got a shuttle from Angels Rest Hiker Haven to the hostel where we grabbed showers and started laundry. Orchid, Coach, Bloom, Trailmix and I headed out for a Mexican dinner and then Orchid, Coach and I picked up breakfast and lunch for the next bit of hostel hopping. Orchid and I cooked breakfast sandwiches back at the hostel and we arranged for some of our gear to be sent to the next hostel for a slackpack tomorrow. There’s 7 in the bunkhouse tonight as well as some private rooms and tents, including Early Bird, Cross Word and Cat Water. This is the most southbound hikers in one group that I’ve seen so far.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658137,"I got up a touch late as I’d forgotten to set an alarm. Ate the breakfast sandwich and a yogurt and got the bag with the gear I don’t need today ready for being dropped off at the next hostel. There’s six of us doing it so it’s a pretty reasonable $4 per person. Hadn’t quite finished getting my feet ready and shoes on when the shuttle was leaving so left in camp shoes and I’ll finish that at the trailhead. We’re slackpacking this section but instead of coming back to this hostel we’re heading to the next one which comes highly recommended. Hence the bag drop off. 


I got my feet ready and shoes on and Orchid and I started up the trail about 10 minutes after Coach and the others except Bloom who’s coming in a later shuttle. We have a 2100 foot climb over four miles which should be relatively easy pitch. However there were some significantly steeper portions which didn’t have switchbacks that made you work hard. Popped out to the Angels Rest vantage point where the New River valley was completely fogged in with the mountains towering over the fog bank. 


Following that we started along the ridge for most of the remaining miles. Had some other views off to the side of the ridge as we went along which still had the valley fog. Had some rocks and bushwhacking along the ridge but nothing terrible today. Overall with the short day today and the relatively easy terrain we got to the hostel just after 1 even with the slightly later start. 


Woods Hole Hostel has a long history originally as a log cabin in the early 1900’s and then as a hostel for several decades. It’s now run by the granddaughter of the woman who started the hostel. It’s got a bunch of old buildings turned into the hostel as well as a bunch of newer structures for things like the bathhouse. The hostel comes highly recommended due to the food they serve for breakfast and dinner with home grown and locally sourced produce. We got bread and cheese afternoon snack as well as the dinner and it didn’t disappoint. Coach, Bloom, Crossword, Cat Water, Orchid and I are here as well as a bunch of section hikers. All of us hung out on the large covered porch and Coach borrowed one of the hostels guitars and played several songs for us. There are several hummingbird feeder’s and they were attracting lots of birds. Friendly cats and dogs as well as some goats in the field rounded out the animal collection. Dinner is served community style so I got to find out more about the group that’s staying here. All in all it’s been a great day and I’d certainly recommend this hostel. 


Tomorrow it’s off to Weary Feet Hostel with another slackpack.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658138,"We woke up in time to catch the sunrise. The best views are probably from the fields, but I sat on the bunkhouse porch and got my feet ready while watching the sun rise. There’s fog down in the valley but the sunrise was still pretty nice. We had a delicious breakfast at the hostel and I was definitely quite full when I was done. Orchid, Coach, Crossword, Cat Water and I are all slackpacking and we dropped off our stuff to be transported to the next hostel and then took off for the day. 


We’re going up Sugar Run Mt which is a 4000 foot mountain but it’s a small climb from hostel given the starting elevation. Coach slowly pulled away from Orchid and I as we climbed up the hill. We had the occasional overgrown spot and rocky spot but in general the terrain today was really nice and we made good time today. Definitely a cruisy kind of day. Got some views overlooking the foggy valley and hazy mountains. Bloom caught us shortly before lunch and we met up with Coach at lunch at the first shelter. The four of us hiked briefly together before Coach pulled away and it was just the three of us. We chatted and did some Mad Libs to pass the time. About a mile before the hostel we were separated by about 40m when Orchid saw a bear off to the side of the trail. It immediately took off down the hill once it saw her. Bloom and I heard it crashing through the woods but never saw it. We caught up with Coach shortly before the turnoff for the hostel and made it there without any further incident. Today was basically a pleasant walk in the woods and there wasn’t anything too exciting about the day except for the bear which wasn’t that exciting. 


Everyone heading south from Woods Hole is also here tonight and Early Bird made it here as well. Coach, Orchid and I walked close to two miles round trip to resupply from Trent’s Grocery and get some ice cream. The hostel had a very nice dinner and we all hung out on the porch afterwards chatting. It’s one of the aspects of the trail that I really enjoy. I did manage to find some time to get some social media posts to get somewhat caught up.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658320,"We had a huge breakfast this morning with eggs, homemade sausage patties, and all you can eat pancakes. Early Bird tried for the pancake record but fell short. I ended up eating three and then had to slowly waddle away from the table. Robert from the hostel shuttled us out to the drop off point and we learned a bunch about how the bear dogs work and that there is apparently a chase season which we’re currently in with the hunting season being in December. There’s a youth hunting window coming up this weekend so we’ll need to start preparing for hiking in hunting season. 


He dropped off Coach, Orchid and I at Rt 52 road crossing by Brushy Mountain Outpost. We’re slackpacking northbound back to the hostel. Cat Water is also but getting dropped off at a different road crossing. We ended up only passing Bloom and Early Bird around the halfway point. Seems like our group is a little bubble. 


We started with a 3/4 mile road walk and then except for about the last two miles the trail today was really nice and it was primarily dirt and not overgrown. It had some ups and downs but nothing really bad. We were making almost 3mph moving average which is way faster than usual. No real views or anything all that exciting to see. Orchid and I generally were a bit behind Coach but we ate snack and lunch with him even though none of us were all that hungry after breakfast. He passed the 600 to go mark and then hit the 1600 mile mark and made a sign and took some photos. Orchid and I passed some of the time listening to Dolly Parton’s America podcast. 



The last two miles had a bunch of rocks and some spots were starting to get covered in leaves which slowed down the pace. We were just a bit behind Coach but he waited for us at the end and we all headed back to the hostel together. Overall it took just under 7 hours to go the distance today.Headed back to Trent’s Grocery, this time by car, for some drinks and ice cream. There’s a northbound hiker here as well as the four of us that slackpacked. Had another great dinner and spent a while chatting with the hostel owner and among ourselves. Ended up getting to bed a bit earlier than in past nights after packing up a bunch of gear tonight.

Downside of this is I know I won’t be hungry for all the snacks that I bought and so will be carrying them into the next resupply. Robert dropped us off at the same place as yesterday and the car ride was just as interesting and informative. 


Bloom and Early Bird were at the parking lot when we got there. Bloom started hiking with Orchid and I while Early Bird got a breakfast sandwich from Brushy Mountain Outpost. Shortly after starting our climb we went through the first of two burn areas, the second was close to the end of the day. The first part of the day wasn’t too bad although not that exciting either, and we made good time to the first shelter where we met Coach and the four of us ate lunch. 


Bloom, then Coach and finally Orchid and I left the shelter. The second half of the day was tough with lots of small to medium ups and downs as we walked along the ridge next to Burke’s Garden. This is a geological feature which is a limestone sinkhole. Unfortunately we didn’t really get any views down into the valley due to trees or being on the wrong side of the ridge. It was primarily on the sunny side of the ridge and it was one of the hottest days we’ve had recently so we were all sweating pretty badly. In addition it had a fair amount of rocks. All of us are basically hating this little section today. It’s one of the few times this trip where I felt like it was a mundane day just making miles. 


Orchid and I passed Coach resting on the side of the trail just before the downhill into camp. At the last minute we changed the location to another campsite about .2 miles further with better water so we waited for Coach. Turns out Bloom could hear us and waited for a while before she headed to the next shelter up the hill and we just missed her. The three of us got to camp about 5 so although it was a tough day still made reasonable time. We were able to easily find a tree to hang the bear bag and after dinner it was starting to get pretty dark so we headed into the tents around 8. 


Today was the first day of fall pretty warm, and the warmest in a while, but tomorrow night will be the coldest yet with lows around 40.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658322,"Having gone to bed early, I woke up around 5 and noticed headlamps down by the road we were camped at. Through the tent it looked like two lights and they looked around for a while and then one headed towards camp. At this point I’m thinking they are some southbound hikers looking for the water source on the other side of camp. However they stopped for a while and then I heard a tent zipper by Coaches tent. After a little while of silence and no light I stuck my head out and looked around and didn’t see anyone. Found out later it was Coach getting up early and starting to pack up and he hit the trail about 6:15 with headlight. I’m still not sure why it looked like two lights. At that point I was up and did some journaling. 


Started packing up at 5:45 and we hit the trail at 7 and it was still pretty dark, just barely light enough not to need a light. We started up just after a local guy and his dog who parked at the lot by camp. The dog wasn’t real happy to have people behind and eventually we passed him and he dropped off our pace. About 2/3 of the way up the climb to the shelter we started seeing sunrise colors in the sky behind us and shortly after that the sun briefly peaked out before clouds rolled in. The area by the shelter offered the first (and last) good views of Burke’s Garden. Took advantage of the privy which looked through the trees into the valley. 


Leaving the shelter we came to a woods road which we started following. It had a bunch of tire tracks which is unusual for the AT. Just as the woods road came out into some meadows we saw an ATV and truck heading our way. Turns out they were doing some wilderness maintenance (wasn’t clear for ATC or someone else) and had been using a skid steer with a mowing attachment to open up paths through the meadows. Bonus for us was the AT corridor had been cut about 5 mower widths wide for close to a mile so didn’t have bushwhack today. They were getting the truck out before the “storm“. We caught Coach just after the trail entered the woods again and hiked together until Orchid and I stopped for water. 



The bridge over Lick Creek had been washed away. Orchid and I crossed in camp shoes, but we found out later that Coach and Bloom managed a dry crossing with there shoes as there were enough rocks just submerged to cross without getting the socks wet. Brief shower as we were getting our camp shoes on but otherwise after two good climbs we made it to the next shelter for lunch where we met Coach. Shortly after we arrived we got some longer showers which didn’t amount to much but we were still glad to be in the shelter. The three of us left the shelter and hiked together for a while until I stopped to pee.
We had a couple of pasture walks today that clearly have cows in them but we only saw one cow across a stream. Bloom caught Orchid and I after she popped into the Bear Garden Hiker Hostel for a while. The three of us hiked the last 5 miles together until we got to camp where Coach was waiting. The four of us are camping together in a nice Rhododendron Glen which is sheltered from the wind blowing up in the tree tops. We did a little dance where nobody wants to pick the first tent site and we’re all trying to defer to the others. Eventually we got settled in and ate dinner and finished the camp chores. Although it’s sheltered from the big winds it’s still windy and cooling off so we retreated into tents before dark. With the low expected temperature I put on extra clothes tonight. I’ve got my sleeping clothes plus my hiking clothes on and two pairs of socks. Hopefully will be enough to keep me warm but I can also add the rain gear for an extra layer.

I slept reasonably well despite a of couple chilly moments mostly when the quilt wasn’t fully tucked in. However getting out of the sleeping bag in the cold and dark was pretty hard and I desperately wanted to set the alarm for an hour or two later. We left camp one by one as we finished getting ready with Orchid and I leaving last. Hands were definitely cold for quite a while after we started hiking.  I also have a bit of congestion going on this morning. 


We passed the 3/4 mark and there was actually a sign to mark the occasion. We had another pasture walk today and this time there were actually cows in the field. They were mostly scattered in groups of 1 to 2 throughout the field except for one that was standing in the AT about 10m from the style we had to climb over. She moseyed off the trail as I climbed over and otherwise didn’t pay us any attention. Lots of cow pies to avoid in the field. 


Coach was waiting for us at the road before town and we all walked into town to the Exxon station together to grab some drinks and snacks. Bloom was there and like good hiker trash we hung out in the sun out of the wind along the side of the building until the SweetWater restaurant opened. The four of us went in for an early lunch and were joined halfway through by Early Bird. They had a piano and Coach played and sang for us and Bloom and Early Bird played as well. 


Bloom and Early Bird took off together after lunch while Coach, Orchid and I headed up to the hostel. We started laundry and then headed into town for a bunch of resupply. Started getting more congested so I picked up some cold meds just in case. 


After we got back to the hostel I lay down and fell asleep for a long nap. Orchid and Coach picked up some Mexican takeout for me. With getting everything sorted for tomorrow didn’t get to sleep as early as I was hoping. Tomorrow we start a four day push into Damascus VA.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658326,"Slightly better today, not as congested and fever lower. Coach is getting antsy and he left this morning and is taking the slow path to Damascus where we’ll hopefully reconnect. 


Late morning I was feeling better and so we decided to take advantage of the slackpack option. Cat Water came with us. The hike was fairly unremarkable and aside from a slightly higher heart rate than usual I felt pretty good. We had a brief shower just as we were getting to one of the shelters and so hung out there for a while until it passed. We got to the road and the Exxon Station just as I was starting to feel worse. Still had the energy to continue but feeling like the fever was back. Was about the same as before when I measured but later in the evening it spiked back up. 


I took a Covid test tonight and it came back positive. Not sure when or where I was exposed but doesn’t really matter. We’ll adapt to the current situation and make it through. I’m just glad that I’m basically feeling OK and that Coach and Orchid are still feeling good. We’re staying here again tomorrow.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658457,"Spent the day in bed. Mostly napping in the morning and watching Netflix in the afternoon. Fever is down slightly and I’m still feeling pretty good. Decided it’s best to wait one more day before leaving to recover more since seemed to rebound slightly after hiking yesterday.  This also gets closer to the point we don’t need to isolate ourselves anymore. 


We’re getting squeezed with Hurricane Ian coming and potentially being a major impact to the trail. We’d like to be in Damascus which is four hiking days away when the storm arrives. Currently it looks like the storm would arrive late in the evening on day four. So if we leave tomorrow and everything goes OK, we’ll arrive just before the storm. 


From an energy standpoint I think I am OK. I feel pretty good and are not having any major issues related to Covid. Even when the fever was higher, I didn’t have a headache and I have taken very little medicine. I’d have to continue to isolate for another two days and avoid other hikers and things like shelters. Fortunately the number of hikers around us is very low so that’s a lot easier to do right now. 


Of course that all assumes that both of us are feeling good in the morning and we can actually leave.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658458,"I woke up feeling pretty good today and I’m ready to hike. Orchid is slightly congested today. She had bought me two tests and we decided rather than pack out the second one she’d take it. Unfortunately she tested positive which pushes her isolation out into Damascus. As she’s basically feeling OK she decided she wants to push on. Surprisingly this area has a really good bus system and there is a bus that runs from the Exxon Station up to Mt Rogers HQ where we needed to start. It’s got a set schedule but only runs if you call so we were pretty confident we’d be the only ones on the bus and we were right. 


It was cool and windy to start the day and it was hard to keep warm even while moving. It’s possible that there is a little aspect of being sick but also much of it is related to the weather. It seems like on the hot days we’re on the sunny no breeze side of the mountain. This morning we’re on the shady windy side of the ridge. Today was the first time I was immediately putting on the fleece when we stopped to take a break. On several of the breaks I also added the rain jacket to block the wind. 


It was a rather unremarkable walk in the woods today. We got to the first shelter at about 10 miles and stopped to get water and have some lunch. We were both feeling good and decided instead of stopping here and having a long day tomorrow we’d push on to an established campsite about 4 miles further and take our chances with hanging our food. On the way there while looking for other possibilities we noticed there was National Forest Campground two miles further on. We got to the campsite and it was nice but there were no bear hanging trees obviously nearby. 


We decided to push on to the Hurricane Campground (really it’s called that. Named after the nearby mountain not the incoming Ian) which looked like it only had one site reserved. It’s actually a fairly nice campground with the sites having a reasonable amount of space between them. There’s a campground host who told us only 2 sites were occupied at the far end. We chose a site near the entrance so we didn’t have to go further. There are hot showers but with the cold air and small hand towel / sweat rag a shower was not in the cards. Never saw another person while we were there. In fact we didn’t see a single hiker today. 


Temperatures getting down to 40 tonight so I’m basically wearing almost everything I have except for the puffy. I’ve got that stuffed in the sleeping bag in reserve in case I get cold overnight. Should be warm enough overnight based on previous experience and have the pants legs and puffy which I didn’t have before.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658459,"Overnight I did have to put the puffy on, but I didn’t have to zip it up to get warm. In fact, I was worried that I might start sweating if I zipped it up. We’d decided to leave at 8, but when my alarm went off I turned it off and then promptly fell back asleep as I didn’t want to get out of the warm sleeping bag. I got 10 hours of sleep last night which is definitely a sick thing as I’m usually waking up after 8 hours or so. Given the air temperature I didn’t take off my sleeping clothes layer to help stay warm. By the time I had finished breakfast and packed up I was 30 minutes late and my hands were freezing. 


I started hiking in long pants and with the fleece on to warm up but it took a while until I could remove the fleece. Ended up hiking in long pants for the first time this trip. It’s windy again today and both Orchid and I struggled to keep warm while hiking at times. The morning wasn’t much different from yesterday and was mostly unremarkable. We’re getting closer to Greyson Highlands and so we did pass a couple of people today and we stepped as far off trail as we could to let them pass. 


We stopped for lunch at the first shelter and sat in a sunny grassy area away from the shelter. We spread out all of the wet things (from condensation and dew) from last night in the sun to dry out. We also basked in the glory of the Orb’s warmth. Eventually we had to pack back up and move on, although it was definitely hard to get motivated to do so. 


Not long after leaving we had a big terrain change as we left the woods and came out into an area of meadows and balds. Terrain changes or micro environments happen all the time, but I’m still surprised when it happens. The first thing we see is The Scales Campground which appears to be in a large fenced in area. This was full of ponies and cows with horns. It looked like a section of fence was missing and they could get in and out. Otherwise it seemed like there were way too many animals for the space and they would have to be fed. Continuing on we had a long meadow walk looking out at Mt Rogers and the surrounding mountains. We’re close to 5000 ft and the leaves are starting to change up here. It’s not fully leaf season yet as only sections of the mountains are changing but it’s obviously coming fast. 



The shelter we were targeting is just over the border of Grayson Highlands State Park which doesn’t allow tent camping. As a result we’re at an established site by Big Wilson Creek. This site even has a bear box. Despite a decent amount of trees and Rhododendron bushes what it doesn’t have is protection from the wind. We found some sunny spot to ear dinner and I’m in my fleece and puffy with rain pants on and still barely warm enough. I’m basically putting everything I had on last night back on again tonight. Slightly colder and definitely windier tonight so hopefully it’s enough. Orchid was definitely having more trouble than I was staying warm this evening and she’s very congested, but so far no fever.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658465,"Overnight didn’t seem any worse than last night. I did have to put the puffy on around 1:15, but I didn’t have to zip it up to get warm. Slept pretty good again and this time I got up with the alarm. It wasn’t any easier getting out of bed though and it was definitely cold packing up. We got going and entered into Grayson Highlands State Park and immediately saw ponies- just kidding of course there were none and given our luck I’m not sure if we’ll see some or just pony poop. The ponies are managed by the Wilburn Ridge Pony Association but it’s not clear exactly what that means. There are definitely fences and gates all over the park. 


We started climbing through the meadows and were soon above 5000 feet. It’s still in the upper 30’s, hazy with a stiff wind blowing. I’ve got long pants, fleece and rain mitts on and just barely staying warm enough while moving. We are getting some partial views and they are quite impressive with the blowing fog, meadows and changing leaves on the mountainsides. We passed Float and Kidding (Hi and thanks!) who are also making the push to Damascus to beat the Storm. We went through the “Fatman Squeeze” which was more open than the Lemon Squeezer. Up at the top we did see one pony and four cows. Also spotted several small groups of ponies off in the distance. Apparently ponies don’t like 40 and windy either. 


Stopped at the Thomas Knob Shelter to get water and then shortly afterwards we dropped back into the woods. Much of the rest of the day was rocky and rooty when we weren’t walking through meadows. Had a long gradual uneventful downhill that eventually came out on a meadow and then the Elk Garden parking area where we stopped for lunch and to dry some of the damp gear. 



The climb out on paper wasn’t too bad but with the congestion lingering and Orchid feeling a bit worse felt like a long climb. We did hit the 1700 mile mark as we neared the top. Didn’t see a mile marker so we made one and took some photos. Had been planning to sing but neither of us was really in the mood. So imagine “I have walked 1700 miles and I will walk 500 more” with walking antics sung to I’m Gonna Be by the Proclaimers.
On the way down we came out to a series of meadows with great views looking out towards Tennessee and possibly North Carolina as well as back into Virginia. At one point we were walking along the hillside and it felt like I was on a trail out west and not just 5 minutes from a deciduous forest. All good things must come to an end and eventually we entered the woods again for the last miles to camp. We were back into Rhododendron Glen’s and it almost felt like we were heading back up to Pine Swamp Shelter. 


We were the only ones when we arrived and we picked some nice tent sites and got setup. Just as we were about to head to the picnic table two other hikers rolled up so we ended up staying by the tents and eating on a small log. There’s a big oak tree over the shelter and eat acorn that hits the metal roof sounds like a shot going off. I am very glad we’re not in the shelter although it’s still pretty loud where we are. At one point we heard the acorn fall, one of the other hikers make a startled noise and the other started laughing. Clearly it’s not just us.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658655,"Orchid and I woke up early to get on trail by 7 to maximize our chances of getting to Damascus before the rain from Hurricane Ian arrived. One of the downsides of being in the woods with no cell coverage and with unpredictable weather heading your way is the forecast updates are far between making planning for precise timing very challenging. We didn’t get Friday’s update until we’d been hiking for several hours. It was warmer this morning which made packing up easier and a lot more comfortable. 


After a little while we briefly ended up on the Virginia Creeper Trail which is a rail to trail that leads into Damascus and beyond. It’s a very popular bike destination and there were probably half a dozen bike rental shops that rent bikes and shuttle you to the start of the trail. There can be upwards of 2000 people riding on a busy Saturday in October.  It also turns out that the Yeti 100 mile endurance race was going on today starting at 7 AM. We didn’t see anyone running this morning but we did see runners on the trail in Damascus later today. Unfortunately the AT leaves the flat Virginia Creeper trail and heads up into the hills going into Damascus. 


We were pushing hard to beat the storm and didn’t take any real breaks. It turns out that we managed to do more than 12 miles before noon, successfully completing 12 by 12 while suffering from the lingering effects of Covid. The day was overcast but we did manage to get to Crazy Larry’s Hostel before it started to rain. 


Coach was at the hostel already and it’s just the three of us there. Cat Water and Horse With No Name are in town at another hostel. Orchid and I picked up our resupply packages from Lady Di‘s were we had been planning to stay pre Covid and then grabbed some lunch. Afterwards we basically relaxed and did nothing for the rest of the day. Throughout the day the track of Ian shifted from west of Damascus to well to the east sparing the area from a lot of rain. However the Laurel Creek through town was definitely running way faster after the storm.

Spent most of the day relaxing and watching movies although Orchid and I did walk the 2 mile round trip to the grocery store for resupply. 
Coach and I headed back to the dinner where we found Cat Water, Horse with no Name, Float and Kidding as well. Cat Water has to leave the trail so we said our goodbyes.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658657,"Woke up early to the smell of cooking breakfast. Crazy Larry was up early making pancakes, eggs, and sausage for us. Orchid, Coach and I ate breakfast and then caught a shuttle ride out to TN 91. Damascus was overcast but as we got into the mountains it became clear that they were still socked in and a heavy mist started falling. We started our slackpack north back to the hostel through a couple of pastures and pretty quickly our shoes were wet. We then entered the woods where we would remain until the edge of Damascus. 


All through the day we had fog and varying levels of mist. Every time the wind blew water would drop off the leaves. It wasn’t quite wet enough or cold enough for me to put the rain jacket on. However, It was just cold enough that I kept taking the gloves on and off and rolling up and down the long sleeves. I was also putting on the fleece every time we stopped and leaving it on for a while after we got going again. We basically only stopped once for lunch and we all got cold pretty quickly even though we added warm layers. It certainly didn’t help that we are all just a little damp. 


It was a fairly unremarkable day with a bunch of little ups and downs until the longer descent into Damascus. We never got a view but even if there was a viewpoint we would not have been able to see anything. We were making excellent time with the light packs and good, if wet, trail conditions, averaging over 3 miles per hour. Do to a miscalculation what we thought was a 21 mile day turned out to be a 23+ mile day and the longest day Orchid and I have done so far. Even so we were back at the hostel by 4. 


We ended up getting pizza for dinner and eating at the hostel. We didn’t finish the pizza so we’ll pack it out in the morning to eat for lunch. After dinner caught up with journaling and social media. Then started packing back up in anticipation of leaving tomorrow morning as my stuff is somewhat scattered.

It’s always a bit nerve racking to leave after a long hostel stay as you feel like your stuff has gotten spread out and you want to make sure you don’t forget anything important. Checks and double checks to make sure nothing is missing. Orchid , Coach and I got a shuttle back to TN 91 to continue heading south. As we were getting dropped off a pair of bear hunting trucks turned off onto the side road. Sure enough there was a dog on top of the bed of the lead pickup. We’d forgotten that we have crossed into TN and we quickly pulled up the TN hunting schedule to find we’re in the middle of a bear hunt as well as archery season for deer. 


It’s still damp, foggy and misty out. Water is still dripping from the trees but it is slightly warmer out. I’m wearing shorts to start the day but have the fleece and gloves on. Early on we have a lot of bushwhacking through overgrown sections of trail. The bushes are wet and quite quickly my shorts are soaked and legs are wet. I don’t really want to put on the rain skirt as there are a lot of thorny bushes in there as well. It basically feels like you are walking through a car wash. 



The three of us are hiking together or near each other again today. We took a short snack break at the first shelter and then had a longer lunch break at the second shelter. Both times I added back a layer but was still getting cold by the time we finished eating. After lunch we started hiking along a ridge above Watauga Lake. It was still pretty overcast but the fog was lifting and it wasn’t misting anymore. We got the occasional partial view down to the lake. We had taken bets about when the sun would come out. Unfortunately we all lost as it never did.
Eventually we descended down to the level of the lake and then walked across the dam which was built by the TVA back in the late 40’s. We spent a while walking along the edge of the lake and had some nice views of the surrounding mountains. There is definitely a noticeable difference in the number of trees that are starting to turn although most are still green. 


Eventually we leave the lake and start down the road that Boots Off hostel is located on. The AT turns off the road at a recent relocation while we kept going for about a quarter mile to reach the hostel. The three of us are the only ones in the bunkhouse although there are two other southbound section hikers with their dog and a northbound hiker as well. We ran into town for some items at the grocery store as well as a chicken sandwich from McDonalds. I think this might be the first fast food chain place I have eaten at so far on trail. After dinner Coach pulled out the guitar that the hostel has and he played for quite a while. A nice relaxing way to spend the evening. Coach will finish his Bama to Baxster Thru Hike at Hot Springs which is rapidly approaching. He started on the Pinhoti Trail then Benton MacKaye trail which feeds into the AT near Springer Mt.

Nothing really great but I did eat a large quantity of food to make up for it. Coach, Orchid and I left after breakfast before many of the section hikers had even made it to breakfast. We have a big climb to start the day and then immediately descend back to the same elevation as Boots Off and then climb back up again before we stay up for the rest of the day. 



The climbs weren’t too bad and we got some partial views along the way. We are definitely seeing the leaves starting to change in more places. Often the colors are muted but there are some sections that are really bright and that really pop. It was another chilly start and I had the gloves and the fleece on for much of the morning. It’s always an interesting balancing game of trying not to be too cold and not to be sweaty. A lot of times I have the sleeves pushed up while wearing the gloves.
After the first climb we walked all Laurel Falls Stream for quite a ways until we came to the Laurel Falls. This was probably the largest and possibly the nicest waterfall that we’ve seen so far although some in Maine came close. We spent some time watching the falls and getting water before climbing up from the waterfall to start the second climb. The initial climb had a lot of steps and was a tough start after the extended break. The biggest change today from recent days was that we saw the sun for the first time in four days. Since it was chilly we tried to take our snack and lunch breaks in the sun. Weren’t too successful at lunch and we definitely got cold while eating even though we all added a layer. Orchid usually runs cold and even on nicer days she’ll get goosebumps before I’m done eating. These days it’s closer to shivering. Even I am getting a bit chilly. As a result we’re not stopping very long, usually just long enough to eat. This helps the body temperature but the feet aren’t too happy as they would prefer three longer breaks on our long days. 


We got to the shelter early and decided to push on to an established tent site a couple miles further. This was partially to make the day into the next hostel shorter and also because there was no sun at the shelter and it would be cold sitting around all afternoon. There are no privies in Tennessee so it’s not really any different from a shelter to a tent site. The tent site didn’t have any sun either but it was later when we arrived. Bear hang trees were hard to find but there was a tall branch that I was just able to throw the rope over after several attempts. However we had to tie Orchid’s rope to mine to be able to make it work and put both our bags on the same line. We all have too much food and it was a tough pull to get the bags up.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658675,"It was a cold start to the morning but the replacement 20 deg sleeping quilt worked well. I only had the sleeping clothes and the fleece on overnight. If my arm came out of the quilt it was a bit chilly but I wasn’t cold enough to have to put the puffy on. It was being held in reserve under the quilt so at least it would have been warm to put on. I had hot chocolate to keep warm and actually heated up the oatmeal water as well instead of just cold soaking. 


Coach left camp and then Orchid and I left camp at 7:25 and it was still distinctly dark in places like all the Rhododendron Glens. That’s one thing that I have really noticed as we head south. There are a lot more Rhododendron’s and they are often very dense. PA had a bunch of dense sections but after that while we would see them they were more sparse. Here entire hillsides seem to be covered in them. Today we were noticing that the temperature often dipped as we went into a Rhododendron Glen although it was also dropping when we went into a hollow. I was in fleece and gloves for portions of the day again and spent a lit of time putting the gloves on and off or adjusting clothing. We ran into three day hikers who were intending to go southbound but accidentally ended up northbound. We would leapfrog them for much of the day.


We stopped for a morning snack and to get water at the first shelter. Coach left first and saw a bear cub about a quarter mile down the trail. It took off when it saw him. Eventually we got to the Jones Falls which is a pretty tall waterfall which we had picked for a lunch spot. There was a trail up through the woods to the top and I climbed up to get the nice views from the top looking out over the valley to the mountain across the way. Noticing more fall foliage every day. 


I’ve been trying to carry less water especially now that it’s not warm out and I’m not sweating as much. Been doing pretty good with finishing water just before the next source. Today we passed up an extremely shallow source and then the next one was sketchy so ended up getting to the hostel dry and thirsty. Mountain Harbor is a pretty nice hostel but unfortunately the food truck on premises wasn’t serving today and the “best breakfast on trail“ was also not happening either. From what we could tell the cook was having a family emergency. Update: We talked to a hiker that got the breakfast and he said it was amazing… so bummer for us.


However, as the saying goes, the trail provides. There was a couple Robert and Lyndsey up from Mississippi and Alabama that are doing an overnight backpack trip tomorrow and staying in the hostel’s tree house. Robert has done a large part of the AT while this is Lyndsey’s and their puppies first trip. We were talking with them for a while in the afternoon. Eventually they offered us a ride to the Mexican place they were going for dinner. When they found out there were two other section hikers that also were in need they made two trips to get both groups to the restaurant. The seven of us ate dinner together swapping trail and home front stories. On the way home they swung by the grocery store so we could pickup some remaining resupply items. It’s random interactions like these that I really enjoy, and most of the reason I didn’t get any updates done on this town day.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658676,"Unfortunately the hostel was not serving breakfast today. Bit of a bummer as the comments indicated that it had the best breakfast on trail. This was the only thing that wasn’t great about today. Orchid, Coach and I ate breakfast and then took off to start the 6000 feet of climbing for the day. First up was the 2700 ft climb to the top of Hump Mt. About halfway up the climb we entered North Carolina. We’ll be hopping back and forth between Tennessee and North Carolina for a long while. It’s a bit hard to tell which state you are currently in on trail and I’m not sure when we’ll leave Tennessee for good. Tennessee has about three times the miles as North Carolina so there’s still a way to go. 


We had some views on the climb into the valley which is starting to really turn colors. Eventually we came out of the woods into the first of many long meadow walks. We had views into TN and NC and the mountains are popping with color. There’s some trees that haven’t started turning yet, and then there’s some that have lost most of their leaves already. But in general the mountains are looking more and more spectacular as the days go on. We stopped for a snack at the top of Hump Mt. The sun is shining and the weather is the warmest it’s been all week and it’s just a perfect fall day. We descended through meadows into the gap and then started climbing Little Hump Mt where we eventually entered the woods again before coming back out onto the bald at the top with continued great views. We’re starting to see a lot of northbound overnight hiker’s that are doing this section. 


Back into the woods for the ling descent to Overmountain shelter, an old red barn, where we were stopping for lunch. As we got close we had great views of the barn in a little clearing. The shelter is off trail and closed for structural damage so we opted to stop for lunch at the trail crossing instead. The three section hikers from yesterday came up from the shelter and we spent a while chatting with them. Eventually both groups continued our separate ways. 


Less than a half mile later we ran into our trail angels Robert and Lyndsey and their dogs. They are having a good time so far and things are going well. Update: We would get a picture later that night of Robert proposing in front of the setting sun… so congratulations to the two of you! While we were chatting, Strider of all people hiked up. He lives about an hour away and had decided to see the Roan Highlands in a different season. We first met him by the original Washington Monument trail magic with Capital and Cornfed and last saw him with Roadie at The Notch Hostel. They finished a couple days after we summited. It’s hard to believe that you would just randomly bump into someone you know from trail. After another lengthy chit chat with Robert, Lyndsey and Strider we parted ways and continued on. 


We continued the climb up to Grassy Ridge Bald where I dropped off the pace and eventually had to stop and get water. I was so far behind Orchid and Coach stopped to wait and were getting close to sending out the rescue party. Jane and Round balds followed with continued great views to the surrounding mountains which continue to pop with color. These two balds are also popular day hike destinations and were quite busy even on a weekday. While on top of Round Bald we saw three bald eagles flying overhead and being harassed by crows. First eagles I have seen. 


A short descent into Carter Gap and we started the climb up to Roan High Knob Shelter. This is the highest shelter on the AT at 6270. The peak of the mountain is 6285 feet which is just 3 feet shy of Mt Washington, which remains our tallest peak for now. Tented by the shelter in a nice pine grove. It’s a bit chilly as we ate dinner and finished camp chores and the wind started picking up overnight as well. However the temperature is not as cold as in previous nights. We had debated going another half mile to a bald peak just over 6200 feet but decided against it. Lamented that decision a bit as we looked through the dense trees at the sunset colors, but we would have been very exposed to the wind up there.

Definitely can notice the later sunrise as it creeps later and later. Doing most of the packing up in the dark and it’s not until close to leaving that there’s much of a glow in the sky. It wasn’t as cold this morning although it was pretty breezy. What goes up to the highest shelter must come down and Orchid, Coach and I started with a bunch of descending. We passed an old hotel site from the early 1900’s but it didn’t have much left other than a clearing. We ended up leapfrogging southbound DickButt (apparently named after a 10 year old internet meme) who was at the shelter last night. 


After a descent and climb we had a nice view out across the valley and to the far mountains which were really starting to change. We stopped to enjoy the views and have a snack. Just as we were getting ready to leave a bald eagle flew past. Tried to get a video but it was pretty far away by the time I got the phone out and wasn’t successful. 



There is a tree that I think is a maple that is turning yellow and is further along than many of the others. As the leaves begin to fall you can start to get partial views out to the mountains and have more reds showing through the gaps in the trees. We also got spots with partial views here and there.
We changed the plan and decided to push on to the enchanted forest on top of Unaka Mt. This is a beautiful pine forest with some established sites surrounded by lush green moss. Compared to some others it’s not all that big. It’s quite a pretty site although it does make you sad when you have to walk over the moss to dig a hole in the morning. We found three nice flat spots and settled in for the night. The wind started increasing as we were getting into our tents. This was blowing a bunch of pine needles on the tent and was also making two nearby trees creak pretty loudly. It’s a bit hard to fall asleep to creaking trees even though you know you checked for widow makers.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658735,"Woke up with the alarm and got out of the tent to pee and get the food bag to find that it’s really foggy out. To really be able see you need to hold the headlamp out to the side otherwise the reflection off the fog is too blinding. The fog also makes it hard to find your food bag when it’s hung well away from camp. Found the food bag with only a little bit of searching and finished getting ready for the day. Coach, Orchid and I started out just as it was getting light enough to just see the trail. 


Ran into DickButt at the first water source and ended up leapfrogging him again today all the way to Uncle Johnny’s where he resupplied and then continued on. Most of the day was a big descent into Erwin TN, although there was the occasional short uphill. The trail was really nice and we were making really good time. It also helps that it was chilly so our breaks were short and there weren’t any really nice views. As a result we managed to do another 12 by 12 without even really trying. 


Unfortunately our good luck with yellow jackets this fall ran out when Orchid got stung on her leg several times by the same bee. We were hiking at the time and she was following and we don’t think we hit a nest so it’s not clear why she got stung in the first place. Fortunately it was only about a mile from the hostel although we did end up stopping to put some Benadryl cream on it. 


Got to the hostel and started laundry before using three of the hostels bikes to ride about a mile to a local Mexican restaurant. While we were there Coaches ex wife (he’s still good friends with her) who lives nearby arrived to visit and shuttle us around town. There’s a big Apple Festival going on in Erwin and we headed over to check it out. We were really looking forward to some apple cider donuts and other apple treats. Turns out it’s more a massive standard street fair with hundreds of craft vendors. We walked a bunch and only saw two apple related vendors - an apple farm and an apple pie food truck that was sold out. There was a map but no vendor list I could find to look for others so we left after a short while and headed to the grocery store for a resupply. 


When we got back finished sorting our food and then headed down to the river across the street where we chatted for a while. We got some more interesting Coach stories from his first AT thru hike as well as some of the other adventures he’s done. Coach met Kim on the AT back in 2007. Eventually it got dark and we headed out for a late pizza dinner. The store had a duckie claw machine and Coach got me another duckie. This one has been named Zinnia by Orchid’s nieces, Little Might and Pigtail.


Kim brought her dog so she and Coach are in one of the hostel’s private cabins while Orchid and I are in the bunkhouse with one other section hiker who arrived just as we got back from dinner.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658739,"Erwin is apparently located in the bible belt as there is almost nothing food related open on Sunday mornings. Even the diner is closed. We had to settle for Dunkin’ Donuts where I ended up having two sandwiches. Kim is slackpacking us today and we headed to the trail head after breakfast. We’re heading north back to Uncle Johnny’s. Kim and her dog Hank joined us for the first two miles before she turned around and Orchid, Coach and I continued on. Today is the first of four days to get to Hot Springs where Coach will finish his Bama to Baxster AT Thru Hike (Pinhoti to Benton MacKaye to AT). 


We had some nice partial views but otherwise it was a fairly mundane day on the trail just with nicer foliage. Only saw one southbound Thru Hiker and didn’t see as many overnight hikers as in days past. Eventually we came to the Lover’s Leap Overlook which had a great view down to the river, mountains across the valley and the town of Erwin. Kim and Hank were waiting for us and we slowly made our way back to the hostel where we had a snack. 



The four of us headed to Walmart for some resupply items and then tried to find a place to eat dinner. Turns out not much is open Sunday and what is open seems to close early. Eventually we ended up at a Brewery in Johnson City which actually had pretty good food. After dinner Kim dropped the three of us off at the Hostel. Coach is in the bunkhouse tonight and two other southbound Thru Hikers are there as well. Tomorrow we have a shuttle driver coming to bring us back to the trail.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658795,"We had arranged for a 7AM shuttle this morning to get back to the trail head. The hostel has a microwave and toaster but not a kitchen so breakfast was a hodgepodge of leftovers and remaining town food from the grocery store. We got shuttled back to Spivey Gap which of course meant we had to climb out. Definitely noticed the added weight in the pack compared to yesterday on the climb out. 


On one of the first peaks we came across the Blue Ridge Bird Observatory Big Bald Banding Station run by the US Dept of the Interior and US Geological Survey. Here they catch, count, band and release unharmed migratory birds to monitor bird population health. There are lots of nets hung from poles and a monitoring blind just off the trail. They ask hikers to “hike without delay” through the area. I didn’t see any birds and it looked like the blind was empty. 


Eventually after walking through several meadows we came out on top of Big Bald. From here we gad 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains. The trees are getting closer to their peak. Most of the mountains are somewhat far away so we’re getting somewhat muted colors compared to some of the closer mountain views. We ended up eating a snack and soaking in the views and sun on top. It’s interesting to compare the difference in how the mountains pop between hillsides that are close by where you can see individual trees vs further mountains where the colors blend together. 


Eventually we headed down and worked our way through the woods until we came out on a narrow sunny meadow. We picked this spot to eat to take advantage of the sun and the views back towards Big Bald. While eating lunch we debated the spot for tonight. The original option which would require carrying water uphill to a dry camp spot. The alternative is to go further and camp by a stream in a smaller area. Eventually we chose to push on to the further site along Sugarloaf Branch. After lunch I was a ways behind Coach and Orchid when they saw a bear. It came scampering down from a tree as they passed and then quickly ran away. 


As we were descending along Sugarloaf Branch there was a different type of low ground cover I don’t remember seeing before. The understory was filled with this. Just before camp there was a switchback that had an odd lighting effect. The late afternoon sun was shining on the hillside which glowed yellowish orange with the changing leaves. However looking back to the hill we just descended it was in shadow and appearing blueish green. It was quite a stark contrast between the two. 


We found a site but it only held two tents. Orchid and I setup here while Coach went 200m down trail to another spot. We all ate dinner together at our camp site. The wind is starting to pick up and even though it’s not that cold out it feels chilly. We didn’t last long after dinner before we went our separate ways to bed. There is another camp or house nearby as I can hear dogs barking and occasionally people as well.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658796,"It’s Coaches birthday today. Unfortunately being in the middle of a resupply we didn’t pack out anything. We’re planning to make up for that in Hot Springs although we did regale him with an off tune Happy Birthday song. We had a short bit of downhill before starting a nearly 2000 foot climb over 8 miles up to Big Butt. We’ve been hugging the border between NC and TN, crossing back and forth. Orchid and I took advantage of the North Carolina located shelter having a privy. Most Tennessee shelters do not have a privy so it’s hit or miss as we border hop. 


We stopped on the top of Big Butt for a snack and found a spot on the rocks in the sun on the overgrown top. Queue the bad jokes here… but ironically yesterday we passed a rock formation that really looked like a butt and that the mountain was mooning us. After snack we continued for about 5 miles until we reached the top of Big Firescald Knob. This was an exposed ridge walk with excellent views into both NC and TN. The mountains on both sides were bursting with colors and it was one of the best views we’ve had so far. We found a lunch spot in the sun and just soaked in the views. Eventually it was getting hot in the sun even with the breeze. However as soon as we got back into the green tunnel it got chilly as the breeze was making it through the woods. 


It’s not paranoia when everything is trying to eat, bite or sting you and end your hike. Coach was leading on the ridge walk when we came across a large “friendly“ off leash dog that was barking up a storm at us. Owner wasn’t doing much to control dog or move it off trail other than to keep telling us her barking dog was friendly. Coach was following Orchid and I when he saw a bear just minutes after we passed through. Shortly after that I walked over a baby snack that I never saw but Orchid spotted. It looked like a Copperhead but it’s hard to tell as the pictures of it are blurry as it slithered off trail as I got closer to take a picture. Not too much further along we came to a large yellow jacket nest right in the trail. Fortunately we were in the lookout and spotted it before we walked over it. 


We camped at an established site about 0.1 miles before a trail angel that bakes delicious homemade cookies. We setup camp and ate dinner and then headed down for a cookie. The woman who bakes the cookies came out and we talked with her for quite a while. It’s the first year she’s been doing this and she had baked upwards of 60 cookies per day during the peak northbound bubble. We’re thinking she should be called Cookie Lady 2.90 based off her NOBO mileage. In addition she had Halloween candy, water and trash. 


We returned to camp where the wind was picking up but it was still a warm breeze. Overall it was an absolutely gorgeous day, with warmer temperatures than we have had recently and wonderful views throughout the day.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658797,"It was still pretty warm in the morning when we woke up, and it’s the warmest it’s been for several weeks. I left camp in shorts for the first time in a while. I’ve zipped off the leggings several times during the day over the past week but typically left camp with them on. Today Coach wanted to hike with us for the whole day and Orchid and I lead the parade into Hot Springs until the final home stretch. 


We naturally started with a big climb that had some of the steeper parts that we’ve seen recently. I was leading at the time and felt like I was really struggling up the hill. Orchid and Coach were breathing down my neck so I kept pushing as hard as I could to stay ahead of them. We got to the top sweaty and winded to find we’d done a 2.7 mile per hour average pace… Oops. They both claimed they were just trying to keep up with me. The problem was that after we crested the hill we got into the windy shady side and the temperature dropped 5-10 degrees and we were all getting pretty chilly. 


We had a brief snack at the shelter where we all put on more clothes and tried to stay out of the wind. It started to look like it might rain but other than a handful of drops stayed dry. The next miles were uneventful and unremarkable and we eventually stopped in a large grassy patch on the side of a dirt road. At this point the sun was out and it was starting to get warm. At this point we had about 5 miles to go and we took our time. We ended up going through an old forest fire area which was recovering but still pretty hot and sunny with the smaller trees. Finally we came to the last long descent into town which had several good vantage points overlooking the river and town. 


We crossed the river and officially entered Hot Springs. We stopped for some photos of Coach and then met June and George who are driving him back home. We all walked the last 1/4 mile to the Smoky Mountain Diner and Coaches official finishing spot. June and George had brought noise makers and silly string and we gave Coach a proper finishing!  After some pictures and videos the five of us went to the Spring Creek Tavern for a late second lunch. We all had a good time swapping stories. Afterwards Orchid and I picked up some resupply and we all heading up to the hostel and lodge. We met Kim there as well. Orchid and I are in the bunkhouse while the others upgraded to the much nicer lodge. 


I caught up with some stuff before Coach, Kim, Orchid and I headed to a local brewery for dinner. Kim had brought a finishing/ birthday cake and we had a present of Oreos and Mt Dew. Coach also did a karaoke song which brought down the house. He doesn’t just sing but he also plays to the crowd and dances. After dinner we headed to the official Hot Springs. They basically fill a hot tub with the spring water so it’s not like sitting in a rocky pool but it still felt really good and was a couple of degrees cooler than a standard hot tub. We had a 9:15 time slot so got back to the hostel pretty late but well worth the farewell sendoff. 


Tomorrow we start a two day stretch which puts us just outside the Smoky Mountains.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658877,"The six of us all ate breakfast at the Lodge. We were hoping for a hot breakfast but it was a continental breakfast. I ate a mix of stuff and was pretty full but would have preferred eggs and pancakes. After breakfast Orchid and I said goodbye to Coach and headed out on the trail much later than usual. First we were The POD with Pilgrim, then The COD with Coach, and now we’re just The OD, or The OD Couple if you know your 70’s sitcoms.We started out with a ling 3200 foot climb up to the top of Bluff Mt. Although there were no views from the top, there were some nice rocks to sit on and we stopped at the top to each lunch with several other hikers. Generally it was an unremarkable day of hiking. We had the occasional partial view but nothing really spectacular or unobstructed. The trail corridor is pretty with the changing leaves but it’s the full hillsides that are the most spectacular. A bunch of leaves have fallen already and there are spots where the leaves are starting to hide the rocks and roots making it slightly harder to walk. 


We did see a bear today. It was just watching us and holding in place until we gave it a Hey Bear and it ran away. We also came across another baby snake that was possibly a Copperhead. It blended in well with the leaves on the ground but fortunately we didn’t walk over it today. 


We stayed in the shelter tonight for the first time in about a month. There was a breeze with the occasional stronger gust that made it slightly chilly but otherwise it wasn’t too bad. This shelter has bear cables which makes hanging food super easy.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658878,"We ended up getting up to leave at the regular 7:15 time. Packed up and ate breakfast in the dark. Had to use the headlight for a little while while going. One of the first places we’re coming to today is Max Patch, a large grassy bald with 360 deg views. We realized too late that we probably should have gotten up extra early and hiked in the dark to catch the sunrise. The sun was just past fully up when we arrived. Max Patch is extremely popular and close to a trailhead and there were about 3 dozen people on the top watching the sunrise. We stayed for a little while enjoying the views and the surrounding mountains fall color. 


Descending out of Max Patch we came to a road crossing where Biscuit (previously thru hiked the AT) was providing trail magic. Unfortunately Biscuit had not yet fully setup or gotten a fire going so we missed out on breakfast burritos. However I did get hot chocolate, OJ, banana, chips and Halloween candy. We stayed for a little while but eventually started to get cold and pressed on. 



The trees and understory around the trail are turning colors, mostly yellows, and it’s nice walking through the woods especially if the sun hits things just right and everything glows yellow or orange. However you can’t see far if the forest is thick and it’s the entire hillsides where the colors pop the most. We get peaks through the trees but not too many unobstructed views. Often you are walking along the trail looking through the trees trying to catch a better glimpse. Other than Max Patch and the foliage it was a mostly unremarkable day.
We headed into the hostel to resupply for the Smokies and spend the night. It’s an interesting hostel that’s been going for a long time. The resupply options for breakfast and dinner weren’t too bad but could have been better for snacks. I’m definitely going to miss Snickers bars among other things. Hand wash laundry but they have a dryer. They made a white bean chicken chili for dinner that was really good. Most of the people staying here tonight are section hikers and they stayed up until midnight around the fire ring listening to two guys sing and play (base and guitar). It was close enough to the bunkhouse that it made it hard to fall asleep.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658879,"Got up a little later than usual as it’s slightly quicker to pack up if you’re not using your sleep setup. Got on the road a touch late because I packed up the “blank” postcards Orchid gave me because she wrote in red ink and I was using the red light on the head light. We were followed for a while by the hostel’s orange tabby cat as we descended to Interstate 40. Just before we got there I spotted a styrofoam cooler someone left for trail magic and was focusing on it as I walked right past a bear that I never saw. Orchid was 20m behind me and spotted it but because it didn’t run she kept going and didn’t get a picture. We think the bear was probably at the cooler and moved off when it heard us coming. Still don’t understand why you leave easily opened containers in bear country. 


Once we crossed under I40 it was 4900 ft up to the high point on Mt Guyot. This is the largest valley to peak that we have had so far and accounts for most of the 6600 feet of elevation gain for the day. I was getting warm so I switched to shorts before starting the climb. About a mile in we entered the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. We dropped off our permits at the box and continued on our way. We crossed a road which had a converted ambulance with Fastest Known Time emblazoned on it. We would get passed soon after by a guy heading north. It seemed like he was going to turn around and head back but we never saw him again. 


About halfway up we came to the Mt Cammerer fire lookout side trail and decided to go see it since You Only Live Once. This added 1.2 miles to our already long day. It’s a lookout since it’s a two story structure built on the ground. It offered some really nice views and the surrounding mountains were quite colorful. However the views from Big Firescald Knob are still the best we have had.  This started a 2 mile stretch of trail to the Low Gap Trail where we saw lots of people and five people on horses.


We stopped for lunch at Cosby Knob Shelter  where there was a father and son backpacking and we chatted with them as we ate. This was the first water for the day making for a long water carry this morning. We continued climbing after lunch and eventually reached 6320 feet on Mt Guyot, which is the highest point we’ve been at so far on the trail. 


We continued to get spotty partial views as we made our way to the shelter. It’s going to be nice tonight and the shelter is crowded with section hikers so we decided to take the tenting option. The sites were not great and so we decided to squeeze both our tents into one small space. Ate dinner and chatted with the other hikers. Hung our food on the bear cables (Yay!) and retired to our tents. I heard them talking until after 9 so tenting was a good choice. I even slept with the vestibule unzipped and open.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658910,"Orchid and I woke up, ate breakfast, packed up, and were on our way with only two of the section hikers stirring. We had been hiking for 10 minutes before we started to get peaks through the woods at a great sunrise. Unfortunately we never got a good look as the forest never opened up. We’re headed back into the alpine like mossy pine forest for the first part of the morning. 


We’re in the higher elevations of the Smokies and the trees are mostly bare although some trees are only partially fallen. It’s definitely looking more like winter up here than lower in the valley. Up higher the partial views aren’t as good since you are mainly looking horizontally at bare trees. When you do get an open vista into the valley it’s often further away so it’s colorful but the colors don’t pop as much as the closer hillsides. Things improve as we descend into the various gaps and get closer to the peak areas. However we think the peak season is probably behind us for the Smokies although it’s still really pretty.


Shortly before lunch we came to Charlies Bunion, a rock outcrop with some really nice views into the colorful valley. It’s a popular, but long, day hike from Newfound Gap. There were at least a dozen people there when we arrived. We climbed up and got some pictures but some of the rocks were worn smooth and were quite slick so we skipped some of the more adventurous parts of the outcrop. After soaking in the views we headed up to the Icewater Spring Shelter for lunch and our first water source of the day. On the way we passed a slow but steady stream of day hikers heading to the Bunion. While eating lunch, I think we blew some day hikers minds when we told them we’ve been hiking since May and had almost 2000 miles done. 


After lunch we continued down into Newfound Gap continuing to pass hikers heading up. Probably saw over a hundred day hikers today, lots more than at Mt Cramerer Fire Lookout. A crowded trail like this does make it hard to pee and when you find a nook it’s usually covered in toilet paper, napkins or paper towels. It’s sad to see and makes you understand why some places are putting in information centers staffed by volunteers at popular day hikes. Our stank is not as bad in the cooler weather, but it’s still shocking to pass day hikers soaked in perfume with a trail of scent wafting behind them. 


Newfound Gap was a packed zoo. I’d guess about a third of the people head up to the Bunion while the rest just go to the overlook by the parking lot. I asked Orchid if she wanted to go to the overlook and her response was “Get me out of here now” so we made a beeline across the parking lot to get back to the trail on the other side of the road. Surprisingly traffic actually stopped for us, although it wasn’t clear that they were going too. We dropped back into the woods on the other side of the road and promptly lost all the tourists. We passed a parking lot about a mile further with just two cars in it, three section hikers, and two day hikers the rest of the day. 



The shelter is in a mossy pine forest and there were 7 other people at the shelter when we arrived. We met Jedi who we had been following in the log books. Otherwise everyone is a section or overnight hiker. There was space in the shelter for us which is nice as rain and possibly thunderstorms are predicted for tonight. We’re trying to keep our gear dry due to the cold snap that’s coming. We were on the bottom of a double decker shelter which rained down dust as the people above us moved. Not great, but better than being in a soaking wet tent.
During the day we had a long debate about what to do with the upcoming extended cold weather. Most sites were indicating lower 20s for tomorrow nights shelter and the surrounding towns. However, there were some outliers which had temperatures in the lower teens. I’m probably warm down to mid 20s at night and definitely lower than that while moving. Orchid can probably handle upper teens at night but not as low while hiking. If the 20s hold we’ll be okay but if it’s in the teens it’s going to be a very cold night and morning. We decided to make the final call in the morning with the latest weather report at Clingmans Dome which is our only real bail out point for the rest of the Smokies. We also worked out various contingency plans for staying warm overnight. Fortunately we only have one night in the woods with the cold weather as we have a planned, and overdue, zero coming up. Weather reports indicate that record low temperatures are threatened and temperatures will be 10-20 degrees below normal for three days in a row. It will actually be much colder here than in the mountains of Vermont.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658911,"I didn’t sleep well last night. Partially due to anxiety over the cold weather, partially from the multiple heavy but short downpours , and partially from the generally louder noise level in the shelter. I lucked out and each time I had to pee it wasn’t raining, just dripping from the trees. There are some small scattered puddles but otherwise I think the bursty nature of the rain helped it soak in. We’re in the clouds and it’s a damp and foggy morning. Fortunately our gear is dry. One section hiker woke up in a puddle with a wet sleeping bag and another had moved their tent under the shelter in the middle of the night to avoid the same fate. As Orchid and I rolled out, some in the group (including the wet hiker) were still arguing that they should continue with their trip. If I had the wet bag with no sure way to dry it and low 20s I’d be already working on the exit plan. 


After a short but surprisingly tough climb, have I mentioned we are overdue for a day off, we reached Clingmans Dome. At 6612 feet this is the high point on the AT. Springer is lower so technically it’s all downhill from here. On the way up we had the occasional brief glimpse of blue skies but when we arrived at the too it was still fogged in with a brisk breeze blowing. There’s a handicap accessible viewing tower and we climbed up just so we could say we’ve been there. Surprisingly there were a number of people up there even though it was likely to be a while before the fog lifted. 


Mrs Duckie had sent updated forecasts via the Garmin InReach and we actually had a tiny bit of cell service and could also check the weather. 24 tonight and low 30s during the day tomorrow seems to be the consensus. I’m willing to continue but Orchid is more nervous about the weather than I am and so it was up to her to make the final decision on Go / No Go. She chose to continue, although I did make her pinky swear it was her decision and she wasn’t feeling pressured into it. And with that we made a hasty retreat from the cold windy summit. 


We started the long 10 mile descent down to the Derrick Knob Shelter and the planned lunch spot. About a mile in we passed the 200 miles to go mark and another six miles later we hit the 2000 miles completed. We looked for a marker and didn’t see one and actually didn’t see the NOBO 200 mile marker either. We found out later from Decadent there was a SOBO 2000 written on a white blaze. We ended up making a marker at lunch. 


After lunch we had a hard climb up to Thunderhead Mt and then over to Rocky Top Mountain. This was definitely a steep climb up but I’m also wondering if we’re seeing the effects of a long big mile stretch without a zero. We had some views from the top but the higher mountains are losing most of their leaves. There is a song about Rocky Top which is an official Tennessee state song and it’s bizarre involving sex, murder and moonshine. Read the lyrics at your leisure. Coach had sung it so it stuck out when we went over it and I looked up the lyrics. 


I had turned on cell service at the top and got a message from the Hostel we’re staying at tomorrow night that their well pump broke and they were canceling our reservation. Service was intermittent and so I enlisted the help of my sister to find a replacement and after a lot of trying we were able to find a new place. This caused a delay on the top if Rocky Top exposed to the cold wind. We had to leave the top as we were getting cold and daylight was becoming an issue before the new place secured. Made the final push to the shelter and got there about 30 minutes before the sun started to set. 



There were seven people in the shelter already but only one other southbound hiker. They had a blazing fire going in the shelter’s fireplace. As we entered the open shelter the temperature went up 10 degrees and we were out of the wind. We had planned to tent since it’s a bit warmer inside the tent and the tent actually does a pretty good job of blocking the wind. However we got lulled into the shelter by the conditions we found. Setup on the upper deck tonight.
We ended up cooking on the lee side of the shelter as the eating area was in the wind. Winds are forecast to be 10-15 with higher gusts and temperatures down to 24 at the shelter. AccuWeather is indicating that temperatures are 10-20 degrees below normal and could be close to record lows in places around here. It was still 38 degrees but falling fast and the fire was still going strong when I went to bed so I was wearing sleep plus hiking clothes but not my puffy, buff or gloves. The low is almost 15 degrees colder than anything we have experienced so far.

Was just starting to get chilly so I added the puffy (only partially zipped), buff and gloves. Woke up again around four to pee and it was down to 25 and I was just getting a little chilly again. The fire was mostly out and the wind had shifted so it was blowing partially into the shelter. I zipped up the puffy, added rain pants and jacket, and stretched the tent out on top of me to block the wind. That helped although it took me a while to fall back asleep. As I was trying someone added more wood to the fire but during the big gusts the draft stopped working and smoke poured out the front of the chimney although was mostly blown out of the shelter. Eventually fell asleep and woke up again at eight where it is currently 23 degrees (all temperature measured on Orchid’s thermometer), cloudy, and still windy. 


I got up and got going leaving all the layers on. I left my water bottles at the back of the shelter and they are very slushy but not frozen solid. I made a double cup of hot chocolate along with the oatmeal. Body was warm but hands were freezing as the gloves and rain mitts kept coming off to complete a task that was hard with gloves on. Orchid and I got going about 9. I took off the rain gear and puffy but kept everything else on. 


We started with a pair of 700 foot climbs to which warmed me up slightly. However I would get chilly again on the descent. We’re noticing that the lower mountains have better color. I kept adjusting clothing to maintain body temperature. Sleeves up and buff off as I climbed and then everything back down as we descended. It was warming as the day progressed and we descended but the sun never came out and the wind continued. We got to the Shuckstack Fire Tower at 1PM and it was still only 30 degrees. We climbed up the fire tower to get some great 360 degree views of the foliage and the lake. The floor has seen better days and is a bit sketchy. The wind was really blowing once we got above the trees so we didn’t linger. 


We continued our descent down to Fontana Dam. It wasn’t until we were most of the way down that I started to warm up and the temperature crept above freezing. We’re thinking many of the understory plants won’t survive after they thaw out. One tree was dropping its frozen leaves if you brushed up against it as you walked past. We crossed the top of Fontana Dam which is the tallest dam east of the Mississippi. It was built in the 1940’s to supply power to the aluminum producer as part of the war effort. 


We got picked up by the shuttle driver who was interested in heading to Robbinsville for lunch and we were more than willing to join him. Afterwards we stopped at Ingles for some food to eat at the hostel before he drove us back to the hostel. We found out he had killed a 520lb bear that morning, which is the largest one he and his buddies had ever gotten, and had gotten 200lb of fat off it.  



The hostel is a ranch house with four bedrooms that can accommodate about 8 people. Decadent, who we passed a couple of times before, arrived shortly after us. It’s just the three of us so we each have a private room tonight. Tomorrow brings a planned zero.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658913,"Woke up around 8 and slowly got going. Made a breakfast sandwich and chatted with Decadent and a section hiker Cruise, who arrived this morning, for a while. Lonnie the amazing hostel owner shuttled us to the Ingels around noon for a resupply. In addition to food, I managed to find a decent hat but not any warmer gloves. Fortunately the gloves with the rain mitts worked ok so I’ll keep going with that and hopefully the temperatures won’t dip as cold in the next 10 days or so. Spent the rest of the afternoon chatting, catching up with things, and watching some Netflix. Cooked a chicken, broccoli and green bean stir fry for dinner so got some greens. Generally over half of what I eat in town is really healthy but the rest are delicious pastries and junk. 


Tomorrow brings an additional slackpack to help with recovery before the final push to Springer Mt. 


I’ll tease that we got some unexpected and exciting news this evening which I’ll reveal in a couple of days…

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659018,"The four of us were dropped off at Stecoah Gap around 9 AM as it’s a shorter day for all of us. Decadent is heading south while Cruise, Orchid and I are slackpack north and coming back to the hostel tonight. Immediately after leaving the gap we started climbing Jacob’s Ladder. This is a 650 ft climb in just over half a mile which comes to approximately a 25% grade. It has a lot of steps and the occasional switchback to help but it’s still a tough climb. As Coach is fond of saying “This shit is hard”! Went from cold to sweating over the course of the climb. There was a small view at the top.
I forgot to mention that Orchid and I left TN for the last time about 10 miles or so before we left the Smokies. We didn’t notice a sign but weren’t really looking for one either. In any event we’re now in North Carolina and only have two states remaining. 


We’re noticing that three of the wildflowers that have been prevalent have survived and don’t seem any worse for the wear - Gentian, Blue Aster, and a yellow one. We think these areas also got a freeze or frost as some of the other plants like stinging nettle are wilted. There’s also some ferns that have survived as well. It’s nice to continue to get the blue and yellow flowers as the mountains slowly turn brown and grey. 


After the initial climb most of the day was spent gradually descending. The lower the terrain the better the foliage colors. Generally it was a relatively uneventful day. It’s an easier day without the full pack weight which helps with additional recovery from the long stretch we just completed. We came to the Fontana Marina and went down to check out the views, but it turns out it’s in a little bay and has no good views. Since the lake levels can vary by 50 feet the marina is completely floating and is connected by a long floating dock. After the marina we saw another baby snake sunning itself on the trail. Probably was a Copperhead but not sure. This one was easy to walk around. Finally we checked out the Fontana “Hilton” shelter so named because it has running water, showers, trash cans, and a solar charger.


We passed two southbound hikers Taz and Yorkshire Pudding during the day and then saw Flip again at the Fontana parking lot while waiting for our shuttle. We covered 15 miles which means there were only three southbound hikers in a roughly thirty mile stretch of trail. Turns out Taz and Yorkshire are staying at the hostel tonight.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659019,"The five of us got dropped off at Stecoah Gap around 9 AM again. Orchid and I have a shorter day planned so it’s not too important to get out early. We ended up leapfrogging Taz and Yorkshire several times during the day but never saw Cruise after we got going.
We started with a big climb up to Cheoah Bald where we got some partial views but nothing spectacular. The best color is lower in the valley as the upper mountains, especially above 5000 feet are mostly bare. Following that was a long gradual decent into the NOC ( Nantahala Outdoor Center). This is a large complex offered everything from white water rafting and kayacking, to traing, to restaurants and an outfitter. 


Shortly after we arrived a train from the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad pulled into the NOC station and several hundred people got off. Unfortunately we were parked at a table in the midst of all of them. Felt like we were in a zoo. We managed to finish our resupply and got picked up for the ride to the hostel. 


We’re staying in the Hero’s Hideaway which is a super hero themed little house built out of a shipping container which included capes and masks of various super heros. Most of the places are fun and quirky like ours, including a double decker tour bus, school bus and a chicken coop. Overall it’s a nice place with very comfortable beds. And for those wondering, no we didn’t dress up.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659144,"Orchid and I tucked in our super hero capes and bid farewell to the Hero’s Hideaway. We got dropped off at the NOC around 8. It’s chilly this morning so we are fortunate to start the day off with a little climb of 2900 feet over seven miles to warm up. The upper elevations are getting bare but the lower mountains still have color and we got some partial views and some good view points on the way up. We could hear the train whistle again today as well as a bunch of dogs barking although it’s not clear if they are hunting or on someone’s property. 


At the top of the climb is Wesser Bald, which is now completely tree covered. However there is an observation tower which has great views of the surrounding mountains. While we were up on the top, an overnight hiker recognized us. Turns out they had been at the Maine Roadhouse Hostel with us way back in August. Backpacking is a small minority of the recreation crowd so what are the odds of crossing paths like this? It’s similar to meeting Strider the other day. 


After soaking up the sun and views we headed back down so we could do another 1000 foot climb up to the Copper Ridge Overlook and some views back down into the valley. We stopped for lunch at the next shelter which was on the shady, breezy side of the mountain and immediately got chilly and had to add several layers to keep warm. After lunch we turned back on the sunny calm side of the mountain and I had to take off my convertible leggings. 


At lunch we decided to push on to the Wayah Bald Observation Tower for sunset and sunrise. There is no water at the top so we’ll have to carry it from the last shelter. It’s a popular spot with gravel road access and there’s even a pit toilet building at the parking lot. We tried to find a stealth or established spot but couldn’t and ended up pitching our tents at the edge of the grassy clearing around the tower. Another overnight camper who drove up is here also. I ended up eating first and then setting up camp.  The sunset was okay, but was partially obscured by the trees and clouds on the horizon. We got periods of color but we’ve seen better. By the time it got dark everyone had left although one vehicle pulled in well after dark. We can see the lights of Franklin, NC in the valley below. 


It’s a weekend and we saw lots of backpackers today although only one Thru Hiker who is doing a wrap around thru hike (a Flip Flop but started back at Springer and heading north after summiting Katahdin). 


We also noticed that there are more bare areas of trees today. I’m wearing the hat all the time now to try to prevent sunburn in the bare forest areas. 


I’ll tease that tomorrow we will be joined by a mystery someone for the rest of the way south.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659145,"Orchid and I don’t have to wake up early to catch the sunrise anymore as we’ve been waking up in the dark for a while. It’s just typically the woods or mountains are in the way. I packed up and then climbed up to the top of the observation tower to eat breakfast and watch the sunrise which did not disappoint.  


Coming down from the top I took my first fall that didn’t involve something slippery. The trail had a gradual descent with far apart steps. I tripped over something and started falling forward. Tried to recover but the downhill and steps did me in and eventually I went down hard. Tried to roll but the weight of the pack prevented that and I ended up landing on my right side and doing a bit of a face plant. Good scrapes on the right forearm, elbow, shoulder and both knees. Annoyingly I scratched my glasses pretty good although fortunately mainly in the transition reading glasses area. I took a while to run through the injury checklist which freaked out Orchid as she caught up as I wasn’t really moving as I did that. Left knee is going to be sore but overall it could have been far worse. 


Orchid and I climbed up Siler Bald and took the blue blaze trail up to the top of the mountain for some fine views of the surrounding mountains fall foliage. Coming down from the bald I could really feel the knee. From here we’re heading to Winding Stair Gap where we are meeting Coach. 


As you know, Coach finished his Thru Hike in Hot Springs almost two weeks ago. However he’s been getting antsy and decided he wanted to join us for our finish. 
NOBO’s have the 100 mile wilderness where hikers can join them for the finish. Coach is dubbing the next 110 miles the “Thrillderness” from Franklin NC to Springer Mt GA. He has brought the band bus for this journey- a Martin backpacker guitar and four harmonicas. It’s about a six pound addition to his pack. So it’s back to the COD for the Thrillderness. 


It seems like the fall weather has returned. We’re getting highs around 70 and lows in the 30s to 40s. This is more like what I was expecting and it’s great hiking weather. Comfortable, for the most part, in shorts and short sleeves during the day and great sleeping weather at night. 


I had a period of time where I wasn’t eating nearly as much food during the day. I had eliminated a second cookie and a granola bar. Yesterday noticed appetite increasing and today I ran out of snacks in the snack pouch and energy. Had to stop and raid the food bag to make the final climb up to the Albert Fire Tower. This is another planned sunset and sunrise stop. 



There were two section hikers already there and not a lot of space but we managed to shoehorn our three tents into a relatively small but flat space. Another two section hikers arrived after us. We ate dinner and then caught the spectacular sunset. Afterwards we sat around the fire and coach was playing and singing for quite a while. We continued chatting for a long time after the concert ended. It was a great way to start the Thrillderness adventure as we count down the final hundred miles.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659146,"Orchid , Coach and I got to wake up at the regular time again to catch the sunrise. The sun was rising over the valley below the fire tower so you got the full view without needing to climb the fire tower. I was able to sit and eat breakfast  at the base of the tower while watching the sunrise. Highly recommended this if you can. 


My left knee was sore and stiff this morning. The climb up to Albert Mt wasn’t bad, but the descent was tricky and reminded me of some of the trail in NH. It was made worse as it took the knee a bit of time to loosen up. Shortly after we started down the Mt we passed 100 miles to go and officially have just double digit number of miles left. Just about six miles later we passed the 2100 mile mark. We made a marker and did the required photo op. This is the last time we’ll be making hundred mile markers. 


We stopped at the top of Standing Indian Mt for lunch. This is the last 5000 foot Mt we’ll climb. It was sunny with limited shade up top as the higher elevations are bare here. Bit hot in the sun but not too bad. Do need to be careful that we don’t get a sunburn, especially in the areas with bare trees. Overall it’s a beautiful fall day and a perfect day for hiking. It looks like we’re going to get a stretch of gorgeous fall weather to finish out the trip. 


Today was one of those quirky days on the trail. In the morning we were generally heading south and came within a half mile of GA before we took a hard turn to the west before completing the U turn and heading back north. At the furthest point we were about 6 miles from the border before we turned back south. Looking at the path, it really looks like we sideswiped GA before recovering and heading back towards her. Camp tonight is about 2 miles from the border and the completion of another state. 


We got setup and Coach was just pulling out the band bus when two section hikers arrived. Turns out one of them, named Shook, plays and sings and we had a good concert going with both Coach and Shook playing until it was time to turn in for the night. Another great evening of music and chatting as we continue on the Thrillderness journey. 


Orchid and I tented while Coach is in the shelter with the section hikers. Shook got his trail name because he shakes the forest with his snoring and we can hear him from where we are camped. 


Tomorrow is a short day into Hiawassee, GA for the final resupply.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659147,"It was a normal morning packing up and heading out of camp. Orchid , Coach and I had a relatively easy downhill as we headed towards Georgia. We came to the final state line took a bunch of pictures with the sign before Orchid started playing “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” and we started dancing and singing along and otherwise just being silly. 


As we continued towards the hostel in Hiawassee we noticed that the fall foliage was getting better and better. It’s almost like fall turned back on at the state line. We started walking through colorful trees and got partial views of the mountains which are mostly in color here. 


We’re goin to town for probably the last time today. It’s hard to believe that we have just four days and 70 miles remaining until this journey comes to an end. We got a ride from the trail to the hostel from a nice couple from Colorado we’d passed and chatted with for a while. We were all crammed into the back of their conversion van. At the hostel we ate, showered, did laundry and then waited for the 5PM shuttle to town for resupply. Crossword and Firelight are at the hostel as well. 


After getting back we went to meet Bloom and her family who are staying in a place nearby for dinner. This all started from a chance encounter outside the outfitter store in Daleville which lead to hiking together and then this get together. Bloom finished her SOBO hike yesterday at Springer Mt. Besides Bloom, her brother Ricky, who is a Ridgerunner in the Smokies, his fiancé and her dad were there. They made a delicious baked pasta along with a massive salad and garlic bread. We talked and Coach played his guitar until almost 10PM, well after hiker midnight. It was a fun way to celebrate Bloom’s finish and our last night in town on trail. We’ll be a bit tired tomorrow but well worth it.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659256,"The hostel offers a slackpack option but it would have been about 2.5 miles less than our target and would have required us to make up those miles to finish on the target day. However, they indicated they would bring our packs out to us so we could finish at the target spot and not carry everything with us on this scheduled long day with a lot of climbing. Orchid , Coach and I departed the hostel with food and essential gear heading south and will get the rest of the gear at Unicoi Gap in 17 miles. If all goes well, this is the last time we will be leaving a town and getting back on trail. Almost seems unreal that this is the case.
It rained overnight and was a foggy and chilly start to the day and was reminiscent of the days after Damascus except not as wet. On these days I’ll typically have the sleeves rolled up and add and remove the gloves to regulate temperature. I’m starting with pants and if it gets warmer I’ll convert the pants to shorts. We were walking through a light fog for much of the morning, especially the higher we got. We had some foggy views to start but the clouds eventually lifted and we got some partial views of the surrounding mountains. They are colorful, but we’re only getting partial views through the small gaps in the forest. Otherwise the hike today was relatively easy and generally it was an unremarkable day.


We got to Unicom Gap shortly before the drop off time and the hostel owner showed up shortly after with the rest of our gear. I dumped a bunch of the town food related trash I had accumulated and then haphazardly stuff the rest of the gear in my pack as we only had about an hour of hiking left. Leaving Unicom we had a 1000 foot climb with the full pack with full food bad. I was really noticing the pack weight difference and the pack was not wearing well on the climb. We eventually made it up to the shelter but it was a long tough climb and my body was complaining more than usual at the top. As I was unpacking I noticed that the heavy items were not close to my back as I usually pack them. 



The water source for the shelter was trickling so it took a while to filter water. It was a bit later than usual after we set up camp and ate dinner. The temperature was dropping as well with a chilly wind blowing so Coach did not perform a concert tonight. Shortly before dark Decadent arrived. He camped off trail and we passed him early this morning before he got going. He’s targeting finishing the day after us so we’re not likely to see him again. Otherwise we didn’t see any other through hikers and not a lot of backpackers today either, although there were some day hikers.
We all ended up getting in our tents early although I caught up on some journalling. When I got up for the final pee before bed it was supper foggy out which was a surprise given how clear it was when we got in the tents. Just three more days to our targeted summit date. It seems very weird to say we’re summiting Springer Mt given it’s small elevation gain compared to Mt Katahdin.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659257,"I woke up this morning expecting it to be foggy out but it was completely clear and you could see the stars through the trees. However, it was clear that the fog overnight had condensed on the trees and tents as everything was slightly damp and I though I had heard rain falling as I fell asleep. We could see the sunrise from the shelter but it was obscured by the surrounding trees. However, it revealed that the valley below us was completely socked in and it looked like a lake of clouds with mountain top islands. It seemed like it would be a spectacular site if we had a clear view. 


Orchid, Coach and I finished packing up and started out on the trail. Decadent was just starting to pack up as we were leaving and asked us if we had mice issues overnight. We had’t heard any, but he had five mice running around the outside of his tent for most of the night. Fortunately none had chewed into his tent and we had no issues with the mice.


For much of the first part of the hike we were walking along a ridge that separated two valleys. The valley off to our right was filled with the fog and looked amazing. Depending on the trees we could occasionally see for long distances and it looked like the foggy lake went on nearly forever. The valley off to our left was getting sun and had no fog at all. We kept hoping to get an unobstructed view but never got one before we turned off the ridge and onto an old logging road. We were on the smooth logging road for quite a long time which made for an easy time hiking. For much of the day we kept seeing the fall foliage through the trees but never really got a great view although we did get some partial views when we stopped for lunch.


Around mid afternoon we descended into Neels Gap and the Mountain Crossings Outfitter. The AT actually goes right between the buildings. For northbound hikers this is a famous outfitter where hikers that have been on the trail for 3-4 days can get a full pack shakedown and replace gear that is too heavy or isn’t working for them. There are trees out front with lots of pairs of hiking boots from those that have quit the trail or traded in the boots. Interestingly, there were not nearly as many shoes as I was expecting. We went in to look around, buy a cold drink, and eat a snack but otherwise didn’t stay too long. We had the big climb up to Blood Mt still to go and didn’t want to get up there too late. Today has been another dry day with relatively few water sources again today and there is no water on top of Blood Mountain so we topped off at the outdoor water faucet. Georgia is also in a drought this year.


It was a tough climb up to Blood Mt with the nearly six pounds of water I was carrying but we eventually made it up to the top. We spent a while looking at the camping options before finally selecting our tent sites. It’s currently windy and the forecast has the winds continuing overnight with gusts up to 25 mph. I’m in a spot where only four of my six stakes are really in the ground. Rocks are holding down the other two corners. Having a non freestanding tent it’s critical that each of the stakes holds overnight or the tent could collapse on me. We’re staying here for another sunset and sunrise. We setup, found a bear hang tree, and ate dinner while waiting for the sunset. It did not disappoint but it was cold and windy on the rock we were sitting to watch. This is likely the last good sunset/sunrise we will see on trail as tomorrows camp is wooded. It’s pretty cold again so Coach didn’t play for us tonight. 


When I peed the last time before bed I sat for a while checking out the stars which were really impressive despite being surrounded by lights in the valley below and Atlanta an hour or two drive away. It’s close to the new moon so there wasn’t much moonlight either. Back in the early days of the AT, Benton MacKaye and Milton Avery fought over what the trail was going to be like. Mackaye wanted a wilderness trail even if it wasn’t connected. Avery wanted a connected trail even if it wasn’t wilderness. In the end it was Avery that got his way and pushed MacKaye out of the ATC. There’s times like tonight where I see lots of civilization in the valley and hear trucks from the top of Blood Mt wish that MacKaye had won.Ironically the ATC is working hard to keep and expand the wilderness feel of the trail and trying to expand the trail corridor to ensure vista’s are of mountains and lakes and not industry and towns.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659277,"When Orchid, Coach and I woke up, everything was covered in dew and soaking wet despite the overnight wind. I had water running down both the inside and outside of the tent. Closer to the shelter on the other side of the peak there was fog, but it was clear on our side when we woke up. I wiped down the interior as best as I could before packing up so I didn’t get everything wet when I brushed against the tent. The foot of my sleeping bad is also pretty damp as it was pressed up against the tent wall.


We packed up and ate breakfast while waiting for the sun to rise. When it started rising it was one of the better ones. With the clouds and mountains it looked like the sun was rising over a field of glowing lava at the base of a mountain. Quite spectacular. If you’re looking to check out a sunrise be aware that some of the best colors in the sky are 30-45 minutes before the sun actually rises. 


I’m feeling the excitement of finishing and it felt like I was mentally ticking off each mile today. I’m definitely feeling the hills more than I think I should be. I’m pretty sure this is fatigue setting in since we have not had many days off in October and have been pushing some longer than average days this month. From that standpoint I’m looking forward to finishing to get a little break and some recovery. However, I’m still having a ton of fun and hiking has never become a chore so I’m sad that I won’t get to keep hiking everyday. Part of me wants to go visit the kids and go home and see Mrs Duckie. The other part wants to take a double or triple zero and then get on the Benton MacKaye and Pinhoti heading towards Coach in Alabama. I’m also super nervous about each time I stumble that I’m going to get hurt with the end in sight.


Just after 11 we came out to a parking lot at Woody Gap just shy of the halfway mark with toilets and trash cans. It had a small grassy area that was in full sun and we decided to take an early first lunch and dry out our gear. Soon in true Hiker Trash fashion, there were three tents, ground sheets and sleeping bags spread out in the grass and various clothes draped over the big rocks surrounding the parking area. We got asked a couple of questions by those parking to check our the overlook but most people just ignored us. What didn’t was the yellow jackets, who almost immediately appeared once we starting eating. That is one aspect of hiking that I won’t miss and one that I wish the early freeze had put an end to. Stayed long enough to get most things dry, but the tent was still damp inside when I started packing up.



The rest of the day was relatively normal and uneventful for me. Keep getting some glimpses of fall but nothing spectacular. However, Orchid wasn’t feeling well the last couple of miles which was probably a combination of the temperature and what she ate. I ended up hanging back with her and we took it slow but eventually made it up to the planned shelter. We’re now just over 8 miles from Springer Mountain. By dinner she was feeling back to normal. We debated one last shelter for the last night but in the end are tenting behind the shelter.  There are seven other overnight hikers here with us tonight and we chatted with some of them. It was after dark when we finally finished up all the camp chores and get back to the tents.
Coach broke out the band bus and we had one final concert on trail. It was a great way to end the final full day on trail. It’s been wonderful that he joined us and amazing that he brought the band bus and we’re getting concerts on trail. For next time I’m going to have to learn to sing and memorize the lyrics to songs that he knows how to play. Tomorrow we will finish (if all goes as planned) and Orchid and I will officially become Thru Hike finishers.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659278,"Orchid, Coach and I are not resting on our laurels on our final day on trail as we’re planning to leave camp at our regular time of 7:30 these days. I got up, packed up and ate breakfast as usual. I know that this is the final day on trail and that this journey is coming to an end today, but it doesn’t seem real yet. My son Alex and his girlfriend Dominique are meeting us at the Springer Mountain parking lot around 10:30 and will hike the final mile up to the summit with us and then Alex will hike down the Approach Trail with us. 


We took the blue blaze down to the Long Creek Falls to check out the falls and get water for the day. Georgia is in a drought and we’ve been finding many water sources dry but for these final miles we are crossing lots of creeks / streams that are flowing really well. This is also one of the many times today that we will cross the Benton MacKaye Trail today.


We saw a surprising number of people today, more than I was expected for Springer Mountain. After my standard greeting I would indicate we were finishing our Thru Hike. A surprising number of people had no idea what that meant despite being at the southern terminus of the AT.


Eventually just north of the parking lot we spotting Alex and Dominique walking towards us and had the family reunion. The five of us returned to the parking lot were we had some muffins and offloaded gear for the journey up to Springer and then down to our official unofficial finish at Amicola Falls Visitor Center Arch. One last climb awaited us up to the official finish at Springer Mt., before we finally emerging on the summit of Springer Mt. Orchid and I have officially completed our 2194.3 mile Thru Hike at the southern terminus of the AT!


Alex broke out the bubbly (Sparkling Cider) and beer and we toasted our accomplishment. We took lots of pictures, Orchid and I signed the log book, Coach presented us with finishing gifts, and we took in the single limited view from the top. Compared to Katahdin, Springer is underwhelming as it is mostly tree covered and there is only one narrow view down to the valley below. 


Alex and Dominique headed back to the van. She’ll drive the van down to Amicola Falls and Alex will catch up with us on the Approach Trail. The three of us ate at the top and hung out for a little while before starting down the 8.8 mile Approach Trail. These miles, like those getting down from Katahdin, don’t count towards the AT which is why I refer to finishing at the arch as my official unofficial finish. Alex caught up to us about four miles into the Approach Trail and the four of us continued down to the upper falls view point. I bought a celebratory Root Beer as I was running low on water. From here to the finish it was crowded with people and a little bit overwhelming. We descended the 425 steps (labled as strenuous) alongside the waterfall and eventually made it down to the bottom of the Approach Trail. We signed the log book at the temporary visitors center and then went down to the Arch to take pictures and complete our journey. They are replacing the visitors center so just past the arch is a construction zone. Fortunately you can still get good pictures with the arch.



The five of us departed Amicola for the rental house we are staying in tonight. On the way we passed several good views of the far foliage on the surrounding mountains. We stopped at Wendy’s for a late lunch and the grocery store for snacks and dinner. Shower, laundry and dinner followed before Coach broke out the guitar and played one final concert for us. It’s a bittersweet evening as we’re all excited about the finish, but we know that tomorrow Orchid, Coach and I are all going our separate ways.
Tomorrow Coach drives home and we drop off Orchid at the airport before heading south to Orlando and Disney. Yes, that’s correct, now that I have finished my AT Thru Hike what am I going to do next? Go to Disney. Dominique works for Disney Emerging Technologies so if you can get into the parks for free… why not.

Duckie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659817,"Note: This post has been in the works for a while and it’s been a struggle to work on and finish this post due to a bad case of post trail blues. I’ve started and stopped writing it multiple times, often with big delays between attempts. I’m focused on the trail aspect in this post but will detail the post trail aspect in a follow up post.
Five Million Steps. That’s the rough number of steps that you will take while hiking the AT. It’s a daunting number that’s hard to wrap your head around. It seems impossibly high when you are contemplating hiking the AT. as you begin hiking, eventually you realize that you are usually focused on the current day and hardly ever look past the next one or two resupplies. The journey becomes a long series of day or overnight hikes looking to get to the next water source, shelter or point of interest. 
Five Million Steps. That’s the number of times that you must successfully place your foot on trail whether it is smooth or covered in roots, rocks, leaves or combination thereof, whether it is dry or slippery, whether you are tired or fresh, or any number of other issues that you encounter while hiking. Any one of those steps has the ability to end your hike, but at the same time it’s not something that you can control. I found that I would trip or land badly enough to notice that step wasn’t quite right about a half dozen times per day. Most of those were innocuous but every three to four days I would step badly enough that I would have to stop, evaluate the situation and determine whether I had done any damage. That’s around 50 times that I came close to a potentially bad situation and another 1000 near misses. From that aspect it’s amazing to me that I actually finished the trail and emerged relatively unscathed. Towards the end of the hike, especially after I face planted, that little voice in the back of my head would get louder and louder that I was pressing my luck and cheating the odds.
As far as actual injuries and ailments, prior to starting I was worried about my toes (Morton’s neuroma) and ankles. I used non custom orthotics with met pads and thankfully had no toes issues the entire trip. In fact the toes might even be slightly better than when I started. A big thanks to my podiatrist Dr Cafengiu for making that possible. I had some minor aches and pains that came and went in my knees and hips but generally I used almost no pain meds (Ibuprofen, etc.) throughout the journey. I still have no idea what was the cause of the abdominal pain in New Hampshire and I guess I’ll never know. I’m thankful that my case of Covid was relatively mild and had a very small impact on my hike. My only lingering post trail injury is my shoulder which I hurt falling in Maine. I keep putting off getting this treated, one of the effects of having the blues.
As I write (well start writing) this in FL while visiting my son, it’s been a couple of days since I finished at Springer. It still seems so strange to me that I am finished and that I completed what I set out to do. When I got to the end, mentally I was still having fun and not ready for the journey to end, and from that aspect I wish the journey could have continued on. However, physically I was tired and ready for a longer break and to see my family again, and from that aspect it’s nice to be done , sleeping in a bed with running water, and not on trail right now. Except for some rare situations, hiking never became a chore or something that I had to do. I came across many hikers whose last couple of hundred miles were not fun, but more like an obligation they had to complete. I am so grateful that I was never in that situation and that the end of my journey was just as fun as the start. I am immensely grateful that I decided to finally take the plunge and make this adventure a reality. This journey has whetted my appetite to get out and see many of the other national parks and regions that my fellow hikers talked about. This is likely not the last long distance trail I will complete, although it’s likely that future adventures will look much different. 
If I had a penny for every person that found out that I was thru hiking and told me they could never do a Thru Hike, I wouldn’t be a rich man but I’d certainly be able to buy a nice beer. I heard this most often in town, but also from many day and overnight hikers. I’m not naïve enough to think that everyone could do a Thru Hike or whatever their big adventure is, but I firmly believe that most people could if they really wanted to. There’s always a reason or excuse not to go. Even my journey was put off, first by my kids being in college and then a second time in 2021 by a family issue just prior to announcing my hike. Even this year I was agonizing over the decision and uncertain about leaving for a long time. However, on trail I met people who wished they had started earlier in life, those whose parents passed away prior to or early in retirement, but nobody who wished they were still working instead of hiking. People of all ages (a 76 year old woman was the oldest hiker that I met and she made it to Katahdin), shapes, experience, family situations, work status, etc. get out for their big Adventure. I am sure there are many people that convince themselves that they can’t go  because they are too (fill in the blank). I am now a convert and encourage you to get you and do your big Adventure while you can. Ironically I had my own health scare with melanoma followed by blood clots five years ago but it was actually getting out on trail that finally converted me. Part of me wishes that I had seen the light earlier and not delayed my start but you can’t change the past. As the Jack Kerouac quote goes “Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.” Adventure awaits, go find it. 
I passed thousands of people on the trail and as those who hiked with me can attest, I greeted nearly everybody with a “Hey, how are y’all doing today”. Nearly everyone would respond, but I’d estimate only half of them would ask how I was doing. Sadly, Orchid got  much lower response rate even if she was leading. Apparently being a “graybeard” and not a women matters to some. I’d respond with Fantastic, Awesome, Peachy Keen or Just Ducky (my favorite being the inside joke and which almost never failed to get a chuckle) and then some comment about the day. If they were backpacking I’d usually ask them where they were coming from or going to try to politely determine if they were a thru hiker. Most Thru Hikers would reciprocate, but almost nobody else would. They’d generally answer specific questions but never ask any.  This was one of those things that became noticeable and would stick out the more people we met. It’s an observation and honestly I’m not even sure what point I’m trying to make here other than lets all try to at least be equally polite to everyone. Obviously YMMV.
Now that I’ve been off trail for a while a number of questions have percolated to the top of the frequently asked list.

Did you see any bears or rattlesnakes? (Yes to both)
Did you go alone? (Started alone but met Orchid early on)
How did you eat, poop, sleep, and shower? (Hopefully this journal answered these questions)
How much did it rain? (Not much)
How many pairs of shoes? (Six)
What was your favorite section?  This is actually a really hard question to answer. How do you boil down 2200 miles and 168 days into one favorite part. It’s easier to name the few areas I didn’t like. Weather, seasons, and what constitutes a “section” all play a factor. For a 5-10 mile section, Franconia Ridge (stunning), Mt Katahdin (epic) and Big Firescald Knob (foliage) took top billing. For a multi-day section Shenandoah (blooming wildflowers and bushes) and the Whites (amazing views) were my favorites. For a state, my home state of NJ is obviously the best, in my opinion of course.
Were there anything unexpected things? The three biggest unexpected things were how many times I stayed off trail, how many times I slackpacked, and how poorly the AT is marked in some sections. I originally expected I would stay in town about once a week. However, I found it was nice to carry no more than four days of food and to get a shower and do laundry at the same time. On average I tended to sleep better in hotels and hostels than on trail which also contributing to more frequent off trail stays. Slackpacking wasn’t even on the radar before I started, but it is a good way to make miles without the strain of a full pack. Thus helping to reduce the effort you need to put forth. It also usually requires a second night in town, adding to the off trail count. As far as the trail, I’ve seen that there are supposed to be 160,000 blazes on the AT which roughly comes down to roughly 20-25 blazes per mile. Yet there were times where you were walking for 5, 10, 15 minutes between blazes, were at an intersection where it wasn’t clear which way to go, or needed to check our GPS position to make sure we were still on track.  Don’t get me wrong, volunteers do an amazing job of maintaining and marking the trail. It’s just they say you can’t get lost on the AT and that’s true on the parts I frequently hike, so this was a bit unexpected. I’d say it’s difficult but not impossible to get lost and you definitely need some form of a map.

It’s now well past New Year’s and I’m finally (hopefully) finishing this post. I had an amazing journey and I wouldn’t change a thing. There were definitely challenges and times that I was cold, wet, tired or miserable. As Coach is fond of saying, “THIS SHIT IS HARD”, but it NEVER GOT OLD and I never stopped having fun. This was in no small part due to the people I met. I lucked out in having such an awesome tramily in Orchid, Pilgrim and Coach. I couldn’t have asked for a better set of traveling companions. So many others played a part and often came at the most opportune times including but not limited to Sparkles (non binary and band director), Harmony, Relish, Play by Play, Big Hungry, Pappy, Blondie, Smiley, Sojourner, Grits, and Bloom. In addition there were many family and friends that put us up for the night, shuttled us around or otherwise helped us. Thank you so much for all of your kindness and support. It means the world to me. I know my journey would not have been the same without you. Ending the trail is bittersweet as you know you won’t see most of your trail friends again. I’ve been lucky to have lunched with Pilgrim and just finished a visit with Orchid. Coach is just a wee bit further away, so …
For those that have followed my journey, thank you. This journey is over for me, but Adventure Still Awaits around the corner. 
Go find your adventure.
