It started with a 7am pick up at the hotel and Survivor Dave took me, Sam and Mike to the Springer parking lot. From there I hiked south to the top of Springer and the start of the trail. From there I turned around and hiked north to Hawk Mountain Shelter. Not many views but otherwise it was pleasant walk in the woods with some nice streams and a lot of enormous rhododendron bushes. Weather was sunny and warm with a nice cool breeze. So far this just feels like another backpacking trip. Hasn’t really sunk in that I will be doing this everyday. Think the highlight of my day was coming up on a mom and her kid and being asked if I was to Maine. For the first time ever I was able to say yes.","Springer Mountain

McAfee Knob is a place I’ve been very much looking forward to visiting on the trail.  The ledge provides the type of photo op that I love being pictured in.  Come Along and a few others were here.  There was a guy sitting on the knob and I was wondering if he was going to move.  I finally approached him and asked him if he could move so that Come Along and I could have some pics taken.  He was really cool about it.  Turns out he’s from Maine and seeing my hat tells me he’s a Patriots season ticket holder.  He volunteered to take pictures for us.  While all this was going on, the skies darkened and the wind started picking up.  As we all were getting off the knob it started raining.  Thankfully it only lasted for a short time.  
The trail continued with its ups and downs going mostly down until Brickey’s Gap at which point it ascended sharply onto the Tinker Cliffs.  This was another beautiful section with a half mile cliff walk.  Had a lot of fun walking along the edge and taking in all the views.  The trail then descended down to Lanberts Meadow and the campsite for the night.  I got in somewhat late.  Had dinner and was able to get into my tent for the night to avoid a passing shower.","4 Pines Hostel

Yesterday’s rain seemed to have cooled things down a tad.  I finally made it to Daleville around 1:00.  I spent the afternoon getting lunch at Angelles Diner then going to Outdoor Trails to get a new sleeping pad as mine has been leaking air since Damascus.  Went to Three Li’l Pigs BBQ for dinner.  Didn’t feel great after that as I ate too much.  Did some resupply shopping at Kroger before returning to my hotel room for the night.","Lamberts Meadow Campsite

I got my favorite dish, eggs benedict, and was so pleased to find that I could get hash browns with it rather than having biscuits and gravy forced on me.  Walked over to Subway after to a couple of subs for lunch today and tomorrow.  Spent the rest of the day getting my pack ready for tomorrow and getting up to date with my journaling and otherwise staying off my feet.  I also went a Pancho’s Mexican Grill for dinner and they made me a very nice ribeye steak dinner.","US 220 Daleville

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652663,"When I woke up this morning, unfortunately the mosquitoes from the previous night had not gone away.  I did my best to eat breakfast as quickly as I could, which generally is not that fast, while fending off the bugs. Got going a little after 8:00.  Had a short day (11.5 miles) planned as I was getting a ride into Glasgow for a resupply and spending the night at Stanimal’s hostel.  The trail started with a short stretch of downhill.  Unfortunately here I ended one of more impressive streaks of my adventure so far.  I was walking on a stretch of wet grass and did not see a rock underneath it. When I stepped on it, I slipped and fell.  First time in 51 days that had happened.  Other than a small gash on my knee, I was fine and kept going.  In bracing the fall, I thought I landed awkwardly on my right wrist but other than a little soreness later in the day it seemed fine as well.
Continuing on the trail, it eventually started the one significant uphill climb of the day up to Highcock Knob.  Descending from there I eventually made it to campsite  at about the 6 mile mark for the day.  I originally told the hostel that I would ready for pickup at 3:00.  It was now a little after 11:00.  As there’s no cell service down by the bridge, this was my last opportunity to adjust my pick up time.  I decided to change it 1:00 and got confirmation that someone would be there to pick me up.  Now the race was on, I had less than 2 hours to hike 5.2 miles down to the bridge. I half jogged at times as the trail was pretty smooth in a lot of places.  Pretty much just made it in time, crossing the James River footbridge, the longest foot traffic only bridge on the trail at 12:55.
Got my ride to Stanimal’s and was able to shower and get my laundry done before going out to resupply.  I was a bit astounded when I got on the bathroom scale and discovered that I had lost another 7 lbs (22 since the start).  I got a nice meal of spaghetti and meatballs at Scotto’s restaurant before returning back to the hostel for the night.","Harrison Ground Spring

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652772,"I have to say, Stanimal’s is probably the best run hostel I’ve stayed at.  Charlie, the proprietor, runs a tight ship and keeps his place very organized unlike the chaos I usually see at other hostels.  He was up at 6:00 making blueberry pancakes for everyone and at 7:00 was shuttling hikers back to the trail.  This early start was key to my day.
Back at the James River footbridge, the trail ascended sharply for several miles going over Fuller Rocks and Bluff Mountain. I had originally planned to go to the Punchbowl shelter today but that was only 10.5 miles from the trailhead.  By 10:00, I was already more than halfway there.  I was feeling good, so while taking a break at some cliffs after Fuller Rocks, I decided I would go for the Brown Mountain Creek Shelter which was another 9.5 miles beyond Punchbowl.  The cliffs had some really nice views but I got going again. 
After going over Bluff Mountain, the trail descended sharply for a bit before turning into a bunch of small up and downs for the last six miles.  During this stretch, I passed the 800 mile mark on the trail.  At point, I got passed by Anvil, Sunny and Luna and we kept leapfrogging each other all the way to the shelter. The last few miles were a grind but I finally made it into camp around 7:30.  I ate dinner after setting up camp and filtering some water and was in bed a little after 9:00.","Stanimal’s 328

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652812,"Woke up and it had gotten a bit chilly overnight.  It did warm up a bit while I was having breakfast.  Like the past few days, the day started off with another steep climb up Bald Knob.  It was 2500’ of elevation gain over 4 miles.  The weather was once again nice.  A little bit of humidity but not too warm. When I got to summit, it was not bald but wooded.  Continuing on, around 11:30, I found a spot to take a break that had a nice view to the west.  I ended up spending an hour and a half catching up on my journal.  When resumed hiking I summited Cole Mountain which had some beautiful meadows and views of surrounding mountains.  The rest of afternoon the trail went back into the woods and continued with moderate ups and downs.  I made it to camp around 6:30 and tented next to hiker that goes by the trail name of Lord Baltimore.  I made my dinner and then retired to my tent as the bugs are somewhat active.  
I’m very happy with the progress I’ve made since leaving Daleville.  The hills are seemingly a bit easier and I’m hiking with good energy.  The miles seem to be flying by now and I’m amazed at how well my body recuperates after a long day with 8-10 hours of sleep or otherwise staying off my feet.

Got to Montebello around 9:45.  This is very small town that has a post office, general store and a campground.  I went into the store and got myself a breakfast sandwich and coffee while I waited for post office to open.  When I went into the post office, it was very small.  It doesn’t look like there’s an out back area here.  In fact, I can see my package behind the counter.  Once I got my package I went back over to the store which had a large porch area and basically setup shop reorganizing my food containers to get all the new stuff in them.  I also have a new pair of boots now.  When I was done with that I went back to the post office to send some items home. I then got a burger and a sandwich to eat for lunch before getting back on the trail. 


The trek out of town was very steep and I didn’t like it very much but like the last week or so I feel like I’m handling these much better than previous. Once back on the trail I made it over to Spy Rock which had some really nice 360 views of the surrounding mountains.  I had thought about staying here but even at 1:00, there were already a lot of people camped here, so I decided to keep going.  A few hours later I made my way into The Priest Wilderness area and started climbing up again.  A couple of miles later I arrived at the shelter.  Magic Mike was here and we chatted for a few minutes but I was here just to get some water.  


Getting going again I arrived at The Ledges a short 0.3 of a mile later.  The view from here was really nice and I found a sweet tent spot as well and set up camp here.  This area was pretty popular too as several groups of people came in and out as I was eating dinner.  It was still early enough that I started a campfire for the first time since I was in Georgia.  Eventually it started clouding up and around 8:00 I retired to my tent before it started raining.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

I finally got on the trail around 9:30.  I had and ambitious hike planned for today.  Going over Three Ridges and down to Reids Gap, 15 miles and getting there in time to be able to get a ride to Devils Backbone for dinner before they closed at 8:00.  First I had to hike down from The Priest to Tye River.  This was a 3000 foot decent.  The sun had come out and it was very humid.  When I had gotten to one of stream crossings I filtered some water and had some snacks.  When I got to Tye River, there was trail magic with more snacks, fruit and soda.  As it was getting to be around noontime, this served as my lunch so I could keep going.  Getting to the top of Three Ridges was a steep uphill climb oppositely mirrored my just completed descent.  Now it was 3000 feet of elevation gain over six miles.  The climb was made harder by the heat, humidity and some rocky sections of trail.  But I felt like I was powering thru it fairly well.  About a mile from the top I met a ridge runner, she gave me some encouragement saying I was almost there and it would be all downhill afterwards.  When I got to the top, it was almost 4:00, I decided to stop to quickly eat my lunch.  Now the race was on, I had 2 hours to get the 4.6 miles down to Reids Gap.  While it was mostly downhill, in true Virginia fashion there were a couple of notable uphill climbs on the way down.  I arrived in the gap shortly before 6:30 and the was able to hitch a ride for the 5.5 miles along the road to Devils Backbone.  I had a very nice meal, the smokehouse platter and a couple of beers before heading over to their tent city to set up camp retire for the night.","Ledges

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657430,"It was a very chilly night as the temps dipped below 40 degrees, but I made it through without being too uncomfortable.  I wasn't in too much of a rush today as I planned on going into Bethel after a relatively short day of hiking.  I ate breakfast and was one of the last people to leave camp.  Originally yesterday, I had planned to do the Notch but the cold, windy weather ended up tipping the scales on my decision to camp early just before the Notch.  This morning it was sunny and the wind had died down, so I was pleased with my decision to end my day early yesterday.  While I was climbing up Fulling Mill Mountain, it was getting warmer as well.  Mahoosuc Notch was a challenging boulder scramble and had parts where you need to squeeze through tight spaces and pull your pack through as well.  I enjoyed the challenge of navigating the massive boulder field and got through the mile in little under 2 hours.  As I was starting to go up Mahoosuc Arm, I ran into Waterboy and Tenderfoot.  Unfortunately, Waterboy had dislocated his shoulder while going through the Notch.  I slowed my pace and went ahead of them and help navigate the way for Waterboy.  The Arm was very vertical with lots of slabs but otherwise I didn't find it overly challenging.  Once we all made it to the top of the Arm, Waterboy said that I could go ahead and they would be fine making their way out.  I then continued down to the Speck Pond Campsite, where I stopped and had my lunch.  After that I made the climb up Old Speck.  I found this portion of the hike to be much more challenging than the Mahoosuc Arm and it made me worry a bit about Waterboy and Tenderfoot.  The descent down to Grafton Notch was steep at times but went by fairly quick.  I had arranged for a ride with a guy named Rodney.  He picked me up around 4:00 and drove me into Bethel.  I spent the night at the Sudbury Inn which had a nice pub downstairs.  Before dinner, I got my laundry done and took care of my resupply at the IGA.  Walking back to the Inn, I saw Waterboy and Tenderfoot and was relieved that they had made it.  For dinner, I had a reuben and fries and couple of Maine beers.  I retired to my room afterwards and watched some US Open tennis on the TV before going to bed.","Full Goose Shelter

Lone Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658750,"I woke up when my phone alarm went off at 2:30.  I got all my gear together and it was nice to see with the breeze that my tent had mostly dried out.  I ate some pop tarts and a danish and was on the trail around 3:10.  Walked along Golden Road until it turned off to go into Baxter State Park.  I hadn't done too much night hiking but the weather was cooperating and my headlamp was shining sufficiently so that I could find my way with out any difficulty.  After passing by the Baxter State Park kiosk, the trail continued further into the woods but the terrain was mostly flat.  At one point, I came near the first of two river crossings of the Nesowadnehuk Stream.  There was a high water bypass and since it was still dark out, I decided to forego the stream crossings and take the bypass.  As it started to get light out, I passed by Grassy Pond which had a beautiful reflection the mountains on its surface.  I completed the first ten miles of my day around 7:30, arriving at Katahdin Stream Campground.  I went over the Ranger Station only to find that no one was there.  There a picnic table and a stream nearby, so I took a break and filtered some water so that I could have some oatmeal and coffee.  While I was eating, I noticed a place where hikers were leaving most of their gear.  So I ended up emptying most of my pack, it was nice that as I literally felt like I wasn't carrying anything.  At 8:30,  I was starting toward the Hunt Trail and ran into the Ranger.  We went back to a table he had set up an completed the permit process, I was assigned number 957.  The first mile of the trail wasn't too bad as it went by Katahdin Stream Falls.  But then it got real.  The next few miles were steep boulder climbs.  There were several instances where I needed to pull myself up on a rock but there wasn't much to work with for my hands to grip on to.  Some of these left me wondering how the hell was I ever going to get down from this!  Every so often, I would look back and the views were amazing and as I got up higher, I ran into fog and clouds but eventually the mountain went above the clouds creating a real cool undercast.  I as made it above treeline and past all the boulder scrambles, the trail got flatter, but going was still very tedious as I had to make my way through fields of rocks.  Around 1:00, I made it to the summit sign.  The weather at the top was foggy and hazy but otherwise a nice day with warm sun trying to get through and very little wind.  There were lots of people here.  As I was getting my summit picture taken, Yahtzee yelled out ""Yeah Lone Ranger!"".  The only disappointment of the day was that there was park ranger sitting next to the sign asking people to not climb on the sign.  I really would have liked that photo op, alas it wasn't meant to be.  I found a spot away from the sign to sit and eat my lunch.  I had a bit of time to reflect on what I had just accomplished.  A lot conflicted emotions, joy, relief, sadness that this adventure of a lifetime was over, but at the same time happy to go back home to my family and resume my old routine.  I then started my way back down, which was just as difficult as the climb up.  I slowly but surely made it past all the challenging spots.  I had done this trail in past and didn't remember all of these difficult spots, I guessed that in the few years since my last trek here that maybe I've started to lose some my fearlessness with heights.  While I will likely hike Katahdin again in future, I feel like I'm good with going up and down via the Hunt Trail.  I eventually made it down to the Owl Trail junction.  I called Debbie and talked to her a bit.  While I still had a mile to go, I felt safe enough to tell her I was done.  A little while later, around 5:45, I arrived back at Katahdin Stream Campground.  In the parking area, my hiking buddy Peter, was waiting for me.  
After a 15 hour, 20 mile day and 57 miles over the past three days, my adventure is over.  When I looked at various options for summiting Katahdin, I thought the 20 mile day option was the craziest and I wondered if it was even doable for me given my slow pace on uphill climbs.  I never thought in a million years that this would end up being how I would finish, but in the end, the weather forecast for Thursday ended up forcing my hand.  I loved the challenge though with the night hiking and the intense boulder scrambling, and it certainly made for a day that I'll likely never forget.
Originally Peter was going to hike up to the summit with me, but my change of plans dashed that.  We did have a campsite reservation at Foster Field for tonight and I was open to doing some more hiking tomorrow but given the rainy weather forecast, we decided to just go home.  After a brief stop in Millinocket to get a bite to eat we were on our way.  I was dropped off at my house around 12:30.  I was finally home!","Abol Pines Campground
