Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647029,"I finally did some after dark hiking at the Ouachita Trail. I found that my feet were surprisingly good at dodging hazards and i could see the trail decently.   Was hoping to stay and test gear in the rain but flood warnings and winter storm warning mix was a bit too dangerous given the my logistics . 
I did meet someone at the shelter for the first time . His name was “John” 50 yrs old, his daughter just accepted to BYU. He did 17 miles that day. I’m not to that point yet, still have to  get my trail legs. I’m working on it

I will hit the approach trail on the morning of 3/19.  This is actually happening. I have still been dialing in my gear. My last shakedown revealed i needed to get some new things. Really just a swap or upgrade .  Got a lighter and rechargeable headlamp, an official Colombia shirt, a zpacks wallet, paracord bear line, small first aid kit, permethrin spray, and a new sawyer.  22 days to go.  About two weeks till I really need to start packing and double checking.

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647222,"Would like to ask other thru hikers 
-What went through your mind your last 10 days at home? 
-What loose ends did you have to take care of ? 
-Is there anything you wish you would have done differently? 
As for me -
I head to Georgia from Oklahoma in 10 days. My first thru hike.  Lots going through my mind. I’m hitting a stair master often and mediating daily, I have my gear as good as it’s gonna get, I have as much saved as I’m gonna be able to, subscriptions paused, gear list official. I have told my close friends and family,  but I don’t do fb, or nothing but Reddit, so no big announcements to make. I’m excited, but know I’m gonna miss my spouse and dogs terribly (I’m hoping this eases as a routine develops).",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Mon",0

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647390,"Hey there,       I have made the rounds with close friends and acquaintances. I have eaten out or feasted nearly every day for a week it seems.  Made myself pork pozole, it has became a new fav since Nick and I visited Loveland, Co. I’m making peace with being gone for a bit.         I have accomplished many things on my “todo” list and I continue to increase my mediation sessions.  Nearly everything I had planned to do before I leave is done (Picking up garbage & checking mowers is still left). I have sprayed all my stuff with permethrin and its hanging in garage drying(ugh. So many accounts of people contracting lime it’s scary).     I have my food bad packed and plan to stop at I believe Neels Gap to be my fist real resupply and possible hostel stay. Hopefully a shower by then.     So much more responsibility is being thrusted at my spouse. I’m so grateful each day for the opportunity to do something like this, and the support from everyone one of the people I hold close.  
I have no clue what the trail holds for me. That’s okay, I’m gonna be out there next Sat. on the approach trail, anyway. My next entry will likely be from the car on the way to  Amiacalola Falls.  I’m starting to like this journaling. I’ll be leaving my pad and pen at home (what I usually take on trek) and using this as well as my own voice memos to keep account.until next time,",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Sun",0
Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647502,"We have almost made it to Georgia. We are staying at a best Western in Moody Alabama with Rita. We all kind of needed a break. We stopped at a Buckees for lunch, I had a great barbecue sandwich. Nick is really sleepy and really needed a nap, he’s been working really hard and has been very helpful in getting me here successfully. Mrs. Rita he been a great travel partner

     It’s only about three or 4 H drive to Dawsonville Georgia which is 20 minutes away from the approach trail- so here’s to the 3 or 4 hr drive tomorrow. 
      I don’t really have cold feet but I am seriously wondering how long I want to be gone from the dogs and my husband. I’m also hearing about injuries and things like overuse of my ligaments and stuff like that, I’ve been reading a lot of accounts of people that are on the trail right now!  I hope  I can avoid some of those problems that they are having. I have started doing an audio recording in my audio notes as well.   All right, I’ll update you from the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Wed",0
Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647525,"After staying overnight and traveling about 5h we made it to our final destination. Nearly anyway. We are 30 min from the start of the approach trail.
Woot woot . Here I go.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Thu",0
Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647738,"Where to start? Nick and Rita dropped me off at the bottom of the stairs to Amicolola falls . The approach trail and stairs were a bit rough . Much more elevation than in OK.  I made it just shy of the first shelter the first day (appx 8 mi) .
Knee was screaming that night. I pitched camp near a water source some what because I didn’t wanna risk blowing my knee completely.
Packed up camp that next morning and went about a mile. (Knee bothering me on descent) I soon arrived at the first shelter. And set up hammock close.  I made a friend bri or “Nemo” pretty soon after my arrival.

 She is a bit ahead of me because I have been doing limited miles since knee bothering me.  After one night I packed up again and headed up Springer Mountain, bum knee or not I made it.    This was the top of Springer Mountain, finally. Technically where the trail begins. After about 5 miles I made it to the second shelter I believe called Stover Shelter. The people here weren’t as nice as Nemo but  I pitched camp and did my thing .    
That brings us to today, 3/22. I slept good and was able to pack up faster than before . Some day hikers volunteered to take my trash as to lighten my load. I hiked about 5-6 miles today, down Springer and to the next shelter.  Cell service picked up and  I’m playing catch up. 
So far the most interesting people I met are Nemo & haz been & tow sac (a couple thru hiking for their 50th anniversary). 
Right now it has been raining for about 5 hrs and will prolly do so for 5 more . I’m bundled up staying warm and trying to stay dry . Even the best set ups spring a leak so it takes monitoring. It’s in the 40’s and I’m on what I think is hawk mountain at the top. With the rain and wind it is imperative I stay dry to avoid hypothermia. (Some one was flighted out the day before I started the approach, from this spot, after falling into the stream and not getting dry fast enough.  
All in all I miss home and Nick but still looking forward to this incredible journey that has really just begun. Tomorrow is my b day and I’m looking to rest here and dry off . I’m thinking my knee should be up to almost 100% if I have off for a day. It has steadily improved each day.  I’m looking to get a shuttle from gooch gap and rest in town some where for a day. I need a shower and more food . 
Until next time-","Springer Approach

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647802,"After many hours in the rain, I came out of my hammock and started to clean up my stuff and dry off.  I slept in the shelter at hawk. It was super cold. I would have been better off in hammock but I wasn’t sure if my knee would slow me down the next day. So, I  stayed in shelter so I cloud pack most my stuff early.   It wasn’t super bad but it was kinda gross. I did make a new friend that goes by Sophia. She’s nice and kinda young but very smart and polite. She reminds me of my ex step sister a lot.  The 10m hike today was awesome .  Lots of cool things. Water falls, water crossings, eagles, cool views, ascents and descents . At my first hostel tonight I don’t think it counts as a hostel stay tho. Bc it’s an hostel turned botique hotel . I have a bathtub . Neway. Onto bed for now and more hiking soon.","Stared at Hawk Shelter ended and Gooch Gap & Cooper Rd.

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647935,"So far have made it to Neels gap. Still taking it slow on the down hills.  My knee starts to hurt after about 4 miles .  The down hill seems to be hardest on it. I should be able to find a knee brace tomrrow when I get dropped off back at mountain crossings/Neels gap. I have been at the misty mountians hostel. I will be here one more night and back to the trail. I’m hoping some time off my knee will help it . It’s also gonna be super cold so being here is a blessing for a couple nights . I was able to resupply thanks to Bill the hostel owner who took me to the dollar general . I prolly got too much food and will have to carry it now. Oh well. Bill said they will bring me a plate of tacos tonight so I’m looking forward to that. I’m also realizing that the cost of the trail seems to be a bit more than I expected. I’m still going to go as far as my body and wallet will take me. I figure after the first couple weeks my body and mind should be more adjusted and hopefully I can push for more mileage in a day.

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647996,"After taking a zero at Misty Mountain hostel I busted out over 10 miles . I got a knee brace which did help, however, I’m still in a lot of pain usually on the down hill. I have goals set for each day this week. I totally hit my goal today which I’m stoked about. Tomorrow I’m doing 8 miles. Looking forward to an easy day. I was a bit homesick today,  but Im also feeling like I’m getting into a groove here. I’ll be done with Georgia in a day or two! 1/14 states woot woot.","Neels Gap

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648072,"Today was a short day but a steep climb down blue mountain.  I have been hiking with some friends I made . I thought they were from Maine but it’s actually Maryland . We seen some trail magic- waters, clementines, apples, oranges. Tonight I’m staying Helen, a small Germanish town. I hade a burger from Wendy’s and a salad and wings for dinner . The food was a real treat. We are taking about possibly doing two ten miles days to make it to North Carolina . Almost one state down. My knee is still being a bitch, but it’s not intolerable .  The bad weather is coming through , it hit Oklahoma yesterday. So much anxiety around storms bc of what happened last year (terrible bouts of hailstorms ) .  Neways, I have a full belly and nice pillow at the moment, free breakfast in the morning !","Low Gap

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648133,"I was feeling a lot of anxiety my last evening and Helen. Even though I was hanging around some friends that I had made some thing didn’t seem quite right. It really is just the anxiety that I have naturally but sometimes takes over and snowballs. That’s one reason I’m doing the trail. Today was a beautiful day and Helen. I got to walk around and visit the town and it was super cute. More importantly I got to eat lots of food. My first day I had Wendy’s and big Daddys for dinner. I had wings and a salad that was made out of spinach. I’ve been walking too much not to be skinny when this is all done. I really enjoyed the time with my new friends. I called him the 20 somethings. They are three people that are in their 20s they come from Maryland. I believe the names are Belches Ryan and Jake.
I spent a lot of time on the phone with Nick tonight. He really helps me through those anxiety snowball moments. I’ve also been catching up on some of my shows. I watch the whole thing about Monica Lewinsky also I’ve been watching some thing about Pam on Hulu.
my time and Helen was well spent the hotel the sure stayy was super awesome I hope to get to stay there again.","Unicoi Gap

My knee is a lot better, but I missing Home a lot. I’m just so used to having the support of my husband and my small family. At night when I’m getting into bed is when I’ve been the saddest. when I’m hiking I feel pretty happy it’s just when I slow down and realize Nick is not here.  I’m almost done with Georgia dear god two more days and then I’m going to reevaluate everything and where I’m at and see how I feel.
   I know I’m doing something that a lot of people only dream of and I never have a chance to do this again so I don’t wanna miss out but my love for Nick is really strong and I also feel like it’s being punished being kept away.

I think I’m getting my trail legs under me, wish the feet would catch up. Have had a decent amount of foot pain tonight .  I’m all set up and ready for bed. Finished the book “the gunslinger” today. Stephen king novel, 1st in the dark tower series. Listened to some Jack Kornfield mediations today too, damn he’s so smart and calm. His lectures remind me to work on practicing compassion, even with myself. He teaches that suffering is a part of the cycle of life -but to acknowledge it and move on.  I’ve caught up to my friends I made and we are looking at only 8 miles left in GA.

Mooney gap is mile 98 with the approach trail is 106 so far. Made It thru snow and ice today! Some conditions were very bad over night.  One lady was in the first stages of hypothermia- it was scary . Everyone helped her out and I sat w her close and held her with my arm.  Possibly that’s the worst weather i have ever faced while hiking and camping .   Made it to the gap where billy and Laurie helped us out. They are good people who went out of their way to help us out . 
Me and the “20 somethngs” have been hiking together for awhile now . We had a fun night in Franklin at the saffire . The whole hotel was filled with hikers. We may have got rowdy but not too bad . 
back in Franklin now for one night , we gonna get clean and head back out tomorrow when the weather is better.","Beech Gap

Sho-Pac,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648650,"Spent 2 nights in Franklin. Are some food from Wendy’s, Fatz, and Shoneys Buffet. Got to catch up with Nick after being w/out service during the snow storms, it was so tough. Possibly one of the hardest things to do was hiking in 19-24 degrees w snow and ice  and  surviving. It was scary as fuck- people lose toes and fingers out here - or worse .  
I’m considering getting a liner that will help with warmth. The “Smokies” are coming up soon and I don’t want to be stuck in the cold as bad as it was at Beech Gap. 
I feel like I’m getting more comfortable on trail. I’m learning that as soon as one thing quits hurting something else kicks in lol. Over all physically im seeing changes to my body. 
I’m still carrying too much food but I like to have the option to slow down when I want , and hang out and take my time on trail. 
The “20 somethings” all have trail names now which is kinda cool, Belches-Goldie-& Bolt. I call them the 20 something too Bc they can do all that shit you could do - when you were in your 20’s. They have been a great source of support and inspiration. 
I’m gonna get free breakfast at this hotel and then head to outfitter to check on liners and a emergency blanket (just in case). Bobby the Greek and has been our main shuttle near Fontana. He’s cool and a social work major too. Talked about his work with youth and how managed people .  He’s a good guy.","Mooney gap

Still galavanting through the woods with our group of 4. Me and the 20 somethings.  Should be at the NOC Nantahala Outdoor Center . Then the Fontana dam, the smokies, gatlinburg  all coming up soon.

We are resting up and getting ready for Fontana damn, clingmans dome, and the smokies. Legs and knees are stronger. Feet hurt at night from the miles. I cooked fried chicken last night  for the “20 somethings” and my self. It was good just took awhile on the single burner (Thanks Tiny home) .

Elevation was 8 miles straight up! The hard part was coming down on some slippery slopes- I was basically skiing down parts of it. Even with a lighter pack it was still rough.

Clingmans Dome is the highest point in elevation on the trail. I believe overall the Smokies is up there and possibly have some the highest peaks katahdin is number three. Climbed Clingmans Dome in some cold rain. It was still very pretty but I could’ve done it dry. I have spent two nights in Gatlinburg at the days inn. Today my room flooded so they gave me another room with a Jacuzzi tub was extremely happy about. I plan to head out tomorrow morning with the free shuttle that comes between 8 and 11. I have still been hiking with the group of 20 somethings but it looks like I may head out earlier than they want to tomorrow and that’s OK. Keep running in to Stormie  and pirate, snagged at pic at Fontana . Also met a guy name crazy eyes. Also keep running into cough drop and dragonfly. There is a group of people that have been hiking, I remember their names as Mulligan, little moon, guardian, and Wink. Also some memorable others would be Colton, honey, and camel I actually played spades with honey and camel at one of the shelters recently. The weather has been pretty nice outside aside from the rain and low 20s couple days. I think I am at mile 200 already and have made it at least halfway through the Smoky Mountains national Park , and looking forward to the rest. Update _I guess the guy who wrote rocky top was in town today too!

After completing the smokies I literally entered another world at Standing Bear hostel. I seen a big black rattle snake on the way in.  I spent 3 nights in a tree house, very cute set up. I can’t even begin to explain the Kindness I witnessed at SB.  So many hikers all being good to each other. Not a single issue, The vibe was so incredibly chill- very commune like experience . The folks running the place are so amazing too. The entire experience was like out of a movie. I found a book about the green Tara that really spoke to me. The universe keeps delivering just what I need everyday on this trail. The crew I was hanging w before caught up to me at standing bear.
