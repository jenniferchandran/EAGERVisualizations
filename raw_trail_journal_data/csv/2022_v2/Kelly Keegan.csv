Kelly Keegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636711,"So. It's progressed far enough that I have created an account here and am risking sharing my thoughts with friends and strangers, who may or may not become friends. This madness. This dream.I remember riding in the car when I was maybe six years old, looking at the beautiful pine trees that lined the highway. Back then they seemed like a gateway to another world, a vast and mysterious wilderness that I imagined exploring with nothing but a pack on my back and my wits. That was the beginning.That was of course before I understood that the trees mostly hid housing developments.Still, the dream persisted. A dream of challenging adventure and time spent in nature.And then I learned about the Appalachian Trail. The idea of a thru-hike entranced me. It terrified me. It inspired me. It's been on my mind for over two decades.But to actually DO it? C'mon, I love my creature comforts! And physical labor? Yeah, I've been overweight and out of shape most of my life. Plus I'm not great with heights. I mean, I did go skydiving that one time and it was one of the best experiences of my life - but that's not the same thing as keeping your footing on a slick mountain incline.But I want to do it. The whole thing.I lost 60 pounds in 14 months and I've kept it off. I'm probably in the best shape of my adult life (that's not by any means saying that I'm in good shape, just better than I was). I'm turning 40 next year. I'm sure these landmarks have nooothing to do with my current mood.It's like a switch flipped in my head and this thing that's been at the back of my mind for so long stepped up and started roaring, ""LET'S DO IT! YEAH!!!""So I've been reading books. I reached out to a couple of thru-hikers that I know. Started planning how to handle money, time, and employment. I'm only just starting, but it feels real. It feels right. Ten months from now, will I feel the same way?",,View Entry,"May 09, Sun",0
Kelly Keegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637252,"Oh boy, I have so much to learn! All the research I do points me toward new questions. Today I learned about Ursacks, sock liners and rain kilts, which sound amazing. I mean, your shins and feet always get wet anyway, so why not wear something that breathes?I've told my parents and a couple of friends about my AT 2022 plan. Pretty sure no one believes I'm gonna go through with it. My parents are supportive but also seem to have a hopeful ""this too shall pass"" mentality. I can understand them not being thrilled by the prospect of their daughter out adventuring solo on the AT for six months. The fact that they're still supportive means a lot to me. My parents are awesome. I shall express my appreciation by devoting myself to becoming hiker trash.But yeah, total beginner here. I've camped overnight maybe three times in my life. Long distance hiking? Never. I've got a lot of learning ahead of me! I doubt anything prepares you for a thru-hike but that doesn't mean I can't practice setting up a tent, filtering water, carrying a pack, and a million other things before I go to Springer Mountain in... just over nine months. I have a list.First on the list: fix my dang knees. I've had an issue with knee pain over the years but until now never really thought to do anything about it. After x-rays and an ortho consult his week I learned that my patellae are abnormally high (patella alta) and I have a prescription for a month of physio to strengthen my knees so they don't go sliding everywhere and causing pain. The doctor says that after a month I should feel better and after three months I should be telling him all about how I hiked Grandfather Mountain. Challenge accepted!I'm eager for physio to start so I can learn how to condition my body without hurting myself. And I'm eager to put together my kit, even if I don't buy everything right away. Good grief, the amount and variety of gear out there is staggering! I want to get quality stuff that works for me, but I don't want to pay more than I have to. Mistakes will be costly, yet it's hard to know what's a good choice when you're a noob and everything is shiny and new and full of promise. What's a girl to do? ...More research, I guess.Oh, a big shout out to my thru-hiker cousin, who spent almost two hours on the phone answering every question about the AT I could come up with. Including the obligatory pooping in the woods discussion. Such patience, kindness and enthusiasm can't be taught. She's a natural gem. I'm looking forward to our next conversation!I still don't feel comfortable saying for sure that I'm gonna attempt this thru-hike next year. There are a lot of things to sort out, and maybe it'll turn out that I don't want to do it after all. But I'm going to act like it's a sure thing. I feel like doing anything less would guarantee that I don't actually do it. So onward! As far as I'm concerned the journey has already begun.",,View Entry,"May 16, Sun",0
Kelly Keegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637737,"It's not really a shock, and yet it is a shock, how expensive camping equipment is. Especially when you want to keep weight down! I'm still getting used to paying special attention to weight when I comparison shop. There have been several times that I thought I'd found just the right product only to discover upon closer inspection that it's really too heavy for long distance hiking.Side note 1: Expenses, bah! If this were a video game I'd just grind for a while until I could afford the items I needed. Dull, yes, but easy enough! I guess in real life that's what my day job is for..?Traveling is a lot different when you're going to be carrying all your stuff. I knew this intellectually but it's really sinking in now. I was at REI today and when I hefted a few packs I thought, ""Holy moly, and this is just the empty pack! Am I really going to carry a full one for 2200 miles??""Side note 2: Speaking of gaming, this week I learned that the ATC created a board game to entertain and educate about the trail. I acquired said game from a generous section hiker friend of mine and am looking forward to playing it!The person who helped me at REI today commented that I must have done my research so I guess I asked some good questions. But honestly my head is spinning from all the ""10 Best"" lists and reviews I've read. I think I want a quilt instead of a sleeping bag. That's the firmest decision I've made on gear so far.Muddying the waters is the fact that just because something gets good reviews doesn't mean it'll be right for me. I don't want to overpay for unnecessary features but I also don't want to get a great deal on an inferior product only to have to go to the extra cost of replacing it with the product I should have gotten in the first place.Bottom line: I'll feel like I've really achieved something if the products I invest in prove useful on the trail.I've started doing leg-strengthening exercises to help my knees and yesterday I did a 4-mile hike with a local Meetup group. The (admittedly easy) hike didn't kill me, yay! Hiking day after day while carrying all my possessions, however, hmm. Gonna have to work up to that. At least equipping myself with stronger muscles is a little less expensive than equipping myself with gear, right?",,View Entry,"May 23, Sun",0
Kelly Keegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/638245,"This evening someone I haven't seen in a long time offered condolences for my brother. He'd have turned 40 this month. Happy birthday, Patman.
If he were still here would I even be planning a thru-hike? Of the two of us, he's the adventurous one. Perhaps I would have been content simply hearing about his escapades.
I like to think that perhaps we'd be planning to meet up and hike partway together. I bet he'd love Trail Days. No doubt he'd shake his head and chuckle at my enthusiasm for this crazy adventure but I know he'd be supportive every step of the way. That's the kind of brother he is.
I still can't bear to say ""was."" It's been three years.
He's always inspired me to move forward in life. Sometimes I took risks just so I could tell him about it later. I got to watch his big brother face get concerned, or proud, or amused - often all three at once. I treasured our conversations when we would catch up on each other's lives and thoughts. I was banking on having a lot more of those.
I wish I could tell him about this face to face. See Patman (look, he totally already has a trail name), this is what your little sister's up to these days. Whaddaya think?
He's not the reason, not the reason why I want to do it. But he's one of the reasons why I might actually go through with it. I love that, and I hate that. I hate the world for taking him away. No journey of self-discovery or inner strength or whatever is worth having your heart torn out of your chest. I will never thank the universe for this ""gift."" Never. But I still want to make him proud.",,View Entry,"May 31, Mon",0
