Refresh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648741,"I am so excited and a bit nervous, 7 days until I begin my flip flop. Leaving from Harpers Ferry and heading to Maine. I will be retired as of Friday. Decided to retire early and go take a trip of a lifetime. My Dad passed away with Covid in 2021, which made me realize even more how precious life is. I am so fortunate to have a supporting husband who knows this is my dream. My trail name is Refresh, I need a fresh start, time to get more balance in my life, enjoy the beauty around me and let go of schedules and lots of meetings. 
Life is a gift. Never forget to enjoy and bask in every moment you are in.      Unknown",,View Entry,"Apr 12, Tue",0

Tomorrow will finish Maryland and cross the Mason Dixon line. Traveling with 2 friends, so fortunate to have a friend driving us the first two weeks to drop off points then back to a base campground. After months of planning, reading, buying gear, reality hits. The first week has been full of ups and downs, both miles and emotions. We have been blessed with beautiful weather and views of Weverton cliffs and Annapolis rocks. Also beautiful views from Washington monument.  Excited to finish WVA and Maryland.","Mile 1024.9

Refresh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649668,"Day 8 from Pen Mar Park to Old Forge Road, PA, 8 miles. Today turned out awesome! Started with a pretty water crossing then a steep 2 mile hike up.  Stopped for lunch at Rocky Mtn shelter and met a flip flopper called Terry berry and her cousin.  Easy hike down to Old Forge Road where we were thrilled to meet fresh grounds.  He travels around providing trail magic. Had drinks, coffee, snacks, and had cooked a fabulous rice, shrimp, salmon, and vegetable stir fry!!!  What a way to end the day. Even on a rainy day it ended so well.","Pen Mar Park

Refresh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649725,"Day 9, 11.5 miles from Old Forge Road to Caledonia State Park. Had a cold day, very windy and temp never got out of the 30s. Started with a 2 mile hike up and then ups and downs along the ridge.  The most fun was several rock scrambles over boulders.  Saw several thru hikers from GA zipping by us.  No other flip floppers today and only a few day hikers.  Getting stronger each day, which I notice as I am climbing up.","Old Forge Road

Refresh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649867,"Started at Shippenburg Road to Fuller Lake, 9 miles. Weather was perfect today, mid 60's, and the trail was relatively flat. Ran into at least 4 thru hikers from GA. Our first day of walking the wrong way off a blue trail for just a bit.  Luckily another hiker in front did the same thing and got us all back on course.  We are doing our first hostel stay at Iron Mountain Mansion, staying in a bunk room.  And the best thing happened, fresh ground saw us walking in the hostel, came and got us to feed us once again!  He was set up at Pine Grove General Store which was closed.  He made homemade chicken noodle soup and fabulous grilled cheese sandwiches.  We are so lucky!  Really was a good day","Shippenberg Road

Stopped for lunch along creek side near James Fry Shelter. My Friends feet were really painful so rested awhile then headed on to Mount Holly Springs. Once day ended, my friends feet were just too painful. We decided to head home for a Dr visit, rest and then plan to come back out. Hopefully just a 2 week break….will see.","Iron mountain mansion

Refresh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651405,Started out with nice hike beside a creek and had trail magic in a bag hanging from a tree.  Thanks for the Snickers bar!  Walked through a cool tunnel under a roadway.  Several climbs up and down which wore me out.  We arrived at Cove Mtn Shelter for the night.  There were no flat spots to set up tents so got water from a spring and walked back up to a flat spot for the night.  Calling for steady rain all night.,"Scott Farm Trail

Refresh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651406,"Today is my friend Squirrel's birthday.  We both decided we had completed our adventure and would stop in Duncannon.  We walked 4 miles down a steep rocky trail.  The rock of PA are real!  We had a wonderful experience in Duncannon.  We ate lunch at the Doyle Hotel. The service was excellent and the waiter gave us a tour of the hotel.  We went to the outdoorsy store to thank Betsy for giving us shuttle names.  We caught up with thru hiker ""Rude"" and several other hikers we had met over the last few days.  The trail community is truly amazing.  We took a shuttle ride from Christie and her 9 week old puppy to a Carlisle hotel.  We'll stay a few days then head home.  We completed 34.1 miles on this part.  Looking forward to enjoying summer at home, hike locally and then see what happens.  Life is good and I have many blessings to be thankful for.",,Duncannon,"May 20, Fri",0
