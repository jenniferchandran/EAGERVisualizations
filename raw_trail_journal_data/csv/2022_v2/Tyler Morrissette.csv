Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646124,"I booked my flight, hotel, and shuttle transportation for the start of my hike yesterday! I was filled with so much nervous energy after taking that step I had a hard time falling asleep last. I'll be leaving from Hartford, CT on the morning of March 30. After landing in ATL I will travel to rei to gather the last items I need and stay in a soft bed one more time that night. I doubt I will sleep much anyway. I've started to talk to my kids (ages 11&9) more about my hike and they seem to be excited for me more than some. I am planning on having them email me often so we can stay in touch even more and be able to have some of those one on one talks. Kids these days prefer to talk over text anyway right? My honey-do-list is getting solidified and lengthy but I don't mind. I can't really say no to anything she wants me to accomplish before my hike starts. I am still hoping for some improvement of her feelings about my hike before I go but time will tell. She is being supportive and I know it is a big ask.",,View Entry,"Dec 22, Wed",0
Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646230,"2022 is here and this is the year of my thru hike. I have 85 days until I step onto the trail and try to get to Maine. For so long it has been ""years"" away. Five years since I first got the desire, and three years since I started getting my work behind me. Now I can only could the remaining time in days. I've got very little gear left to figure out and deal with. I'm sure I'll start to panic buy stuff the closer I get. I wake up more commonly before my alarm clock and think about my hike, where I'll resupply or if I'll have a problem with my knees on the down hills. My wife agrees that it's a good idea that I get a silicone wedding band for my hike. Just a lot of risk of damaging it or myself, but mostly I'd be afraid of losing it. I was worried about asking her that but she understood the question for what it was. Nothing to do but hike!",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Wed",0

Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647796,"The nerves are really starting to kick in now! In less than a week I'll be having the deal with a totally different lifestyle and group of challenges. My last day at work was March 18th and I've been busy on tidying up things at home for my wife and family. 
I know the nerves and fear will start to subside as soon as the hike really starts. Maybe even after the first 100 steps after passing under the stone arch of the approach trail.  Knowing that though does not make the waiting any easier. 
I've been lazy about getting my food set for the start of my trip. Not sure why, planning usually helps me calm down. But I won't have the same luxury when on trail and maybe just winging it the night before my flight will feel better. I already am willing to eat nearly anything at home, I'm sure I wouldn't be getting more picky on trail. 
Everyone seems to ask me if I'm starting this journey alone or with a friend. When I explain the work and life logistics I had to go through to be able to do this myself then they start to understand who getting someone else's life to align would be nearly impossible. Plus, this is my dream and dragging someone else along who's heart wasn't in it would be selfish and being setup for failure. I do worry, maybe stupidly, if I'll make any friends on this hike. Find a tramily or even a single person whom to share the journey with. I guess I don't really make a lot of new friends now in my regular life, but that could be because I have the friends I need when I'm home. I'll have no one on trail and that could open the door to establishing new friendships. 
I've invested so much personal and professional ""capital"" into making this happen I'm a little scared I've dreamed it too big. What if I don't like it after a few months? What if I miss my family too much? Is the day to day boredom of walking and sleeping outweighed by the views and friends along the way?  I think I could be too embarrassed to give up and let people down who are rooting for me, but then who would I be doing it for then? 
If i get injured and have to go home early I'm not sure if I'll forgive myself. No stupid mistakes! 
No pain, no rain, no Maine",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Thu",0
Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648401,"3/31: day 1, picked up by Jordan and shared a shuttle with Robyn who is from England but lives in Scotland. Steven took my arch photos and used to work at EB. Hiked with Ron and Shawn who are both post military. Meet thru hikers past Mountain Doctor and Lucimina(?) having a safety meeting 😂. Meet Paul (trail name Grand Master) from Amsterdam who was traveling with Annabelle and a Girl from Poland with a 52 lb pack. Mountain squid gave us first trail magic (Capri sun). Meet lots of hikers including Scorpion who got stung on the face on FL trail.4/1 day 2, meet digerydo who hiked with quad zilla. Pet a dog. Met Jeff from Maryland. Stayed at Gooch gap shelter with lots of hikers. Mooch and Paul played chess (Paul won) and got cigar trail magic from day hiker Ron. Hung out all night with everyone having cigars and naming star constalations.4/2, day 3 hiked out with tramily and got trail magic at Gooch gap from Donut and Granola. Meet Birthday Girl who turned 76 on trail. Hiked with Grand Master, Matt (from England) who smokes 20 hand rolled cigs per day on trail, mountain doctor, and Ron. Met Billygoat the trail maintainer and trail angel. Gave me info on trail conditions ahead and magic. Ended day at jarrad gap where many laughs were had. Ron got his trail name ""Ron the builder"" for fixing mountain doctor's hiking pole and rebuilding the fire ring. Met Ms Moss who got her bear hand string caught in a tree. Emily traded massages with mountain doctor. 4/3 day 4, woke up very cold as the wind really picked up after 3am. Was likely blowing 30-40mph when I crawled into the cold at 7am. I made coffee and breakfast as fast as possible inside my tent while packing my gear. I was ready to go by 8 and so was Matt so we headed off to blood mountain in our puffy coats, hats and gloves. Eventually we caught up with Shelby who went with us up the rest of the way. It was cold the whole way but totally clear up top. We got down to Neels gap for resupply and got a pizza too. Went off and added Ron and Tim (from central mass) to the group. Met a finishing sobo who said only to start hiking after 10am. 🤔 We pushed on to hog pen gap to make the day shorter tomoorrow but it had a few grinding climbs. Got trail magic of fresh fruit 🍌🍊3/4 day 5, woke up again to cold wind. Slept so well and many folks were already packed when I got up at 730. Packed up quickly and ate some pop tarts for breakfast then started hiking. Hiked for most of the day with Shelby (trail name the conductor) and Austin (who didn't take enough breaks when he was in the pacing position) and Tim. Climbed Blue Mountain and hooked up again with Matt. The five of us decided to push on (with very little water) to get down to Unico gap and up Rocky Mountain. Have a beautiful grassy camp site to ourselves. Kara got here too around 7. All day we never saw Ron the builder who started out 30min or so ahead. He left us breadcrumbs all day by scratching his name into rocks that we saw all day. Somehow he hiked on farther than our 15.7 mile day 😶. Tomorrow looks like a shorter day over Tray Mountain.3/5 day 6, beautiful morning on the top of the mountain. No wind so I had enough time to make coffee (with the coconut oil didgeridoo left me) and a hot breakfast. The hike over tray mountain was strenuous but doable, we barely spent 30 sec at the top. We found Ron at tray mountain shelter, meaning that he did almost a 20 mile day the day before. 😐 By then it was 10 and we put on our rain gear since it was due around 11. And the rain came hard. A lot of grinding hiking and I don't even recall going over Kelly Knob. ended at Deep Gap shelter in the rain. Austin has a tattoo of a cock in a noose tattooed below his knee. Send me a message once you know what that is supposed to mean 😏","Amicalola State Park

Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648671,"4/6 day 7, the rain let up overnight and everyone in the shelter was relieved. Thank goodness everyone set their watch alarms to something respectable like 7 and not some ungodly hour. Coffee and pop tarts for breakfast as we had only 4.2 miles to reach Dicks Creek Gap. Went all morning with Matt and Austin as Shelby and Tim continued on late yesterday in the rain destined for hotel rooms last night. The morning was foggy and then beautiful. It was a short half mile hike from the gap to around the bend hostel. The hostel is great and the owner gave us good advice on how to plan for getting into Franklin and the NOc for resupply.
4/7 day 8, leaving around the bend hostel with two extra beers. Pack weighed 25.5 lbs. Robert joined us from the hostel. Emily and mountain doctor came at lunch right after the NC boarder. Stayed at muskrat creek shelter which was packed everywhere. Was getting cold so just went to bed early. 
4/8 day 9, up at 645 and out of camp by 750. Had mountain house eggs for breakfast, I'd have them again but not my favorite. The conductor left by 710 bc she was worried about the potential rain and going over Standing Indian Mountain (5478'). The grade wasn't bad so Matt, Austin, Tim and myself had no problem summiting by 1030. Then the snow came! We jumped into our rain gear to stay dry and hiked onto our planned stoping location for the day, Carter Gap Shelter. It was cold and windy there and the shelter was already full with early or fast hikers we had seen the night before at the last shelter. The conductor wasn't there and Mountain Doctor indicated she changed up the plans (once again) and was heasing farther along to the next tent site hoping it would be warmer and more sheltered from the wind. So the boys hiked another 3.7 miles and down 250' to Betty Creek Gap. By about a mile out the skies opened up and it really started to snow. Tim and I were last to camp as we stumbled through the snow covered rhododendrons to find where everyone else was camping. We put our tents up quickly in the snow trying to keep everything dry and it seems to be a good campsite out of the worst of the wind.  I'm sure it will be a quiet night with everyone eating by themselves in their tents and going to bed early, hoping to stay warm all night. 
4/9 day 10, wind really started to blow and the snow cam down quickly overnight. Besides a pair of hikers that came in around 8 it was a quiet night in Betty Creek gap. Woke up to snow all over our tents and about 1"" of crunchy stuff on the ground. Made it to the top of Albert mountain and the 100 mile mark by a little after 9. Then it was a series of ups and downs thru Glassmine Gap, Rock Gap, Wallace Gap, and our final Winding Stair Gap at mile 109.4. The rest of today is landry, town food and a night at the Sapphire motel.  Went to outdoor 76 to get outlr resupply boxes and had a beer in their bar. Then went to the lazy hiker brewery for dinner #1 and another beer. Ingles to resupply and back to the motel to drink beers Tim has purchased. Had dinner #2 across the street at Mi Casa Mexican restaurant which has 32 oz beers. 
4/10 day 11, was woken up by a guy puking at 6am. Went to church pancake breakfast. Franklin First Baptist had a nice breakfast,were very nice and had a lot of nice touches for hikers. I sent a letter home with a photo. Our shuttle driver was a hiker who was just helping out and he wasn't a very good driver. Missed at least three turns and almost rear-ended a truck.  When he commented that he hadn't even had a ""safety meeting"" yet today we were all pretty sceptical. We took the day at an easy paste and enjoyed the good weather going over Siler bald and Wayah bald. All the tent sites at Wayah shelter were crap and slanted. Ended up laying on half of my sleeping all night. Very windy overnight and I was woken up by my tent slapping in the breeze a few times but wasn't cold.","Gooch Shelter

Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649733,"4/11 day 12, warm morning and had a good breakfast of oatmeal and bana chips. The had a poptart while waiting for the rest of the guys to be ready to go. Stopped for a break at Burningtown Gap. Met Blaine who was asking me about being an engineer.  We hiked up and over Cooper Ridge, Rocky Bald, and the hard climb up to the fire tower on Wesser Bald. Staying tonight at the shelter nearby. No word from the conductor.  Supposedly Ron did a 30 into Franklin. 
4/12 day 13, woke up to ""pushy"" playing his recorder when some folks were still in their tents. 😐. Rained last night even though none was forecasted and somehow got my electronics sock went when it rolled out of my quilt. Wtf. Less than 8 miles to the NOC with plans for burgers, beers, laundry and possibly a shower. The hike down was easy to the NOC and we had a good time talking most of the morning. We arrived around 10:30 which worked out well to grab a beer and start our laundry ($2 each for the wash and dry). We hung out for a bit chatting with friends (had another beer) while our cloths finished and we got our smokies permits printed. We then headed into the restaurant around 12:30 for lunch and ate wayyyy too much pizza and beer. The 5.9 miles with 2986' of elevation gain was super painful, hot, uncomfortable and difficult. We ended up in a unofficial site above 4500’ (not to the official shelter). Kara and her friends got too drunk to hike on so they are staying at a Hostel tonight. We are camping less than a quarter mile ahead of Ron the builder. Plan  tomorrow is to do a little more than 13 into carter Gap which sets us up nicely for Fontana Dam. 
4/13 day 14, Woke up again to the wind howling around 4am but the night was warm and dry so I was happy. The four guys packed up with our first planned stop being the privy at Sassafras Gap Shelter. We then went on with our 13+ mile day with +2877/-3661' of elevation change. Didn't take many photos since there were not many good or new views. We did score trail magic from Bigfoot and his friends (brauts and beers) and shared it with a laege group of hikers. Ended the day tired at mile 156, Cody Gap. That puts me at 87 miles for the week which is 10 more than last week. We did much harder terrain with over 20k feet accent and decent. The plan for tomorrow is a Nero into Fontana Dam to resupply, shower and be ready for the next test in Smokies National Park. 4/14 day 15 -Got up as normal and only had about 5 miles to get into Fontana Dam (stopped at 164.3). Stayed overnight at Fontana village to shower and do laundry. We hung out with hikers having beers at the laundromat and a good time at dinner along with Intel and another hiker from the UK (but lives in Belarus 🤔). Tim plans to stay one more day with a zero for his leg. 
4/15 day 16- took us a while to get going in the morning. We enjoyed at hot breakfast and then had to walk down to the pitstop for resupply after they opened. We headed off from the Marina around 10 and enjoyed the 3.2 miles along the dam. The Fontana Hilton was definitely the nicest shelter we have seen yet. Including hot showers, flushing toilet, and a solar charging station. Swanky. The hike up after dropping off our thru hike permits was brutal once again. It was a long and tiring hike and pretty hot at times too. We finally got to Mollies Ridge Shelter at mile 177.7.  Had an eventful trip to the water source where we saw a black bear cup up a tree and it's mother (3rd year?) walking around the tree base only 50 yards away. We had good company at the shelter including some 2019 & 2020 thru hikers (pigeon, chewy, guy with cowboy hat, pigeon's friend) who were back to finish this section because it was closed during covid. Rained a lot that night and it was a good choice to be in the shelter that night. No mice or further bear encounters. 
4/16 day 17- slept well and stayed dry overnight. It was windy and rainy when we were getting ready for the day and some folks headed off into the rain. Our group headed out a bit later and it was barely raining as we stepped away. We felt good most of the day hiking. The elevation gain was manageable but we were socked in with bad clouds and fog all day.  No real views over Rocky Top or Thunderhead Mountain. Getting back up to Derrick Knob Shelter was tough once again. We had dreams at lunch time to continue another 5 miles to the next shelter but that went away after we arrived here at 4pm. The plan tomorrow is to summit Clingman's Dome and finish our day 13 miles forward than where we start. 
4/17 day 18 -another warm and dry night at the shelter. In the evening Matt was able to score the remaining safety meeting materials from Chewy since she was getting off on the 18th. Nice! Once we got going everyone was quiet since I think we were all fearful of the pending days hike over Clingmans Dome. We hit the first shelter in stride for a snack but wanted the luxury of a privy at the next shelter 1.7 ahead. Getting there we found another previous thru hiker who was waiting on his thru hiker friends to show up (the ones we had met). Watching them reunite was fun and you could tell they all just really love the trail and the people that fall in and out of it along the way. We proceeded on and got some great views on the way up to Clingmans Dome. We hit the side trail and merged onto the paved path with grams with mobility scooters and Dads carrying 2 year olds up to the spaceship looking observation tower. People sure were giving us strange looks but we felt uncomfortable too with everyone so clean and well feed around us. We made it quickly back in trail and found a shady spot for a well deserved lunch where many folks stopped to ask us if we were thru hikers and to wish us luck. It was nice. Passed the 200 mile mark and a long 3.5 miles mostly downhill to mount Collins shelter. Plan tomorrow is to make it to Peck's Corner Shelter, mile 218.2. We will see who shows up later tonight as the weather is supposed to be bad overnight and all tomorrow. 
4/18 day 19- today was the ""rain"" part of ""no pain, no rain, no Maine"". It rained hard overnight and everyone including Intel was happy to have slept in the shelter. We ate breakfast as it continued to rain and headed off into the fog together. We hiked quickly to stay warm, jumping rock to root to try and keep our feet dry. At the time it seemed appropriate to risk a slip into the mud to keep our feet dry for two miles. We hiked on and got pretty much no views all day. Just fogged in and we laughed together as we pantomimed taking photos at the view points. We even stopped at Charlie's Bunion for Matt to take a photo. 8 miles to lunch at a shelter and then 8 more to our final stop Peck's Corner Shelter at 218.2. tonight's forecast is more rain and perhaps snow with a low of 25 brrrrr. 
4/19 day 20 -Yep, it was fucking cold last night. Though I was warm and comfortable all night it got seriously cold after 3am. I pulled my head out from under my quilt a little after 7 and was welcomed by frost on the trees. All of our water bottles had frozen over night and it was difficult to find enough clean water to make my coffee. I really needed it to stay warm while packing up. Four hikers had come in the shelter late, with the last two just sleeping on the dirt floor. One has a thing looking 30 degree bag and the other guy had a 55deg bag which wasn't much more than a fleece blanket. He looked frozen to the ground 😐. As quickly as my cold fingers would allow I packed up and Matt and I were ready to start moving by 8.  We had some difficulty because our socks had been wet the night before and our shoes were frozen solid when we tied to our the on. Matt has to put them on a bench and sit on them for 15 minutes just to undo the laces enough to slide them on.  Austin was a little too warm in his sleeping bag so we left him to catch up. Matt and I started off with our hiking poles strapped to our packs, gloves on and shoved deep into our puffy coats. We spent the first 45 minutes hiking just trying to warm up our limbs and get some feeling in our icey cold feet. We then got the first look at what views  we would be enjoying all day. Cold wind has blown the moisture and froze it onto the west face of the mountain covering everything in a fine white frost. The sky was clear and we could see the frozen trees in the distance and the parallel peeks that ran alongside our path. We side stepped frozen ground trying to keep our feet dry all day and trying to keep from slipping on all the icy surfaces. Overall it was a very enjoyable hike and I could really enjoy the sunny views to the east and stay bundled up when peeking over to the west. We only had a little more than 13 miles to do today but by the end of the hike my left quad was screaming at me and I was hobbling into Coby Knob shelter. Today was the first day I took ""vitamin i"" for pain. Weather is calling for warmer temperatures tonight (only a low of 37) but no rain or snow. Plan for tomorrow is to hike the last 10 down to Standing Bear, get a two day resupply and continue on so we can get to hot springs for a very well deserved zero! Tomorrow will be three full weeks on trail, I can't believe it sometimes. I think I may be just starting to think of myself as a thru hiker and that I can actually do this thing.
4/20 day 21 -it was a pleasant enough night in the shelter with the temperature staying above freezing. Matt headed off early to the Mount Camera lookout tower which Austin and I intended to skip that blur blaze side trail. The weather was clear and beautiful and if it wasn't for my very painful left quad after about 4 miles it would have been a pleasant walk down and out of the Smokies. Austin had an interesting theory this morning about why you can't bring alcohol into the Smokies. His idea was all the bears who live there are ex circus bears who are ragging alcoholics. They just pretend to be normal bears but only go through your food bag looking for booze 🤣. He thinks you'd have to be a ragging alcoholic to be a circus bear anyway. The trial after getting out of GSNP was beautiful along some fast flowing streams and only a bit of road walking before we got to our resupply point at standing bear. Given the 🌲holiday on 4/20 we were anticipating a bit of a show at the hostel but it was really chill and nice. I really liked the laid back vibe and if I didn't have time constraints I would have been up for a night there. However we just hung out for a few hours, having pizza, sodas and a resupply to get us into Hot Spings for a greatly deserved zero. There were so many dogs at this place I'm not sure I even put them all after playing with at least a half dozen. Before we left the owner came back from the package store with a literal truck load of beer in the back of his F150. We then helped ourselves to a few road sodas and had a hot, steep and sucky hike to our campsite. We only need to do 13s to get into Hot Springs for the 23rd so I'm hoping it's a nice enjoyable few days over the upcoming bald peeks including Max Patch.","

Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650240,"4/21 day 22- windy overnight but it wasn't cold and it was ok to get ready in the morning. Thinking we only had an easier 12 mile day ahead no one was rushing in the morning to get out of camp. We walked as we straddle the NC/TN boarder over hills and found some nice views on an open bald that has a radio tower on top. More hiking in the woods till about lunch time when we were surprised by trail magic from four sweet ladies (the JAMS) down in Deep Gap. After chatting for a bit, hot dogs, chips, and cookie we were odd on a steep climb to get up to Max Patch. It was beautiful on top and the restoration work has really cleaned up the mountain. We had great views for a snack and to lay out on the grass in the sun for a while. We heard rumors of great burgers and free beer ahead so we set off in search of this unicorn in the woods. Not too far along we found a sign written with sticks that pointed down a side trail that read ""BEER"" and ""BURGERS"". No matter what was at the end of that trail we were going to find out. It wasn't a murderers ploy for hikers but a great hamburger spot called the Green Heart Lodge. The setup was amazing and the owner made some great homemade grilled burgers, pretty fancy too. The county is dry so beers are given away for free and tips are appreciated. We each got a burger and lots of beers knowing we only had a one and a half mile walk to camp. We spent about three hours hanging out, eating and drinking and talking with the owner and the other hikers before heading off with road sodas and a little buzz. Camp was quick to setup and we are hoping for a nice day tomorrow to setup a light trek into Hot Springs on the 23rd. Overall one of the best days on trail yet. 
4/22 day 23- an easy night lead to an easy morning, even if there was a bit of condensation inside my tent. Breakfast was oatmeal with my instant coffee packet added. We set off a little after nine only having to do 14.7 to get to Deer Park Mountain Shelter. My leg felt fine most of the morning and it was a pretty easy time till about noon. We did have some climbs but were blessed by the end of trail magic from a nice family with their dog. I ate a few bags of chips and ice cold water they provided. Austin ate cheese on a hotdog bun and then had a raw hot dog on a bun with ketchup and mustard. Gross. It got hot as we made our way down (then up, wtf) and down some more to the shelter. Should be an ok night and only 3 miles to get us into town where our first stop I expect it to be breakfast at the diner. Town chores and showers at the hostel, but a day off on Sunday!!!! 
4/23-4/24 day 24-25 -we hiked in 3.5 miles and got to Laughing Heart Hostel by 9:30. Then began an amazing weekend with nearly everyone I have met on trail to date. There must have been 50 hikers here and it felt like a two day fourth of July party. There was grilling hamburgers and hotdogs, so much beer, live music, and Cornhole. Was able to resupply in town, get new shoes, and have a few good town meals. I really just loved hanging out with everyone at the hostel chatting and telling stories. This will be one of my best memories from the hike I'm sure.
4/25 day 26, the morning was pleasant as we packed up and headed down to breakfast at the diner again. Tim came into town late last night after doing a 26.2 yesterday 😐. His wife was in town and we enjoyed catching up over eggs and coffee. Austin shipped his old bag home and we headed off to the trail with Intel. The hike today was hot, nearly 80 degrees and it was a hard hike. Lots of elevation gain and exposed sunny areas of the trail.  We were so thankful to get to camp at Spring Mountain Shelter after 11.3 miles. We camped with a lot of folks including Glamazon, Intel, Footlong, and Shit Show.  Weather calls for rain tomorrow and everyone is looking forward to the cooler weather. 
4/26 day 27 -the rain day. Rain fully defined this day from what we ate, to what we wore, and how we hiked. The weather held off until about 10 and then it didn't stop till 6. We all hiked in it, heads down. This type of weather is good for pushing big miles since no one breaks for long and you only get to camp to jump into the bag. Jerry's Cabin Shelter was packed, we are in the bubble for sure. Must have been over 25 tents setup along the trail. 
4/27 day 28 -cold overnight but it was pleasant to be so comfortable sleeping in my quilt. I was woken up at around 630 by this day and son paid that were talking full volume while everyone was trying to sleep 😐. Unfortunately for them Shit Show was already awake and she first kindly asked them to lower their voices because everyone was still trying to sleep. The son asked what time it was, and that was the wrong answer. Shit Show told them it didn't matter and then called them cock sucker as she walked away 😅. It was cold so everyone was working quickly and heading out as soon as they were packed. We hiked through frost covered fields and up Big Butt Mountain. Lunch was in a wide open field, in the sunshine, after a long climb down. Hogback Ridge Shelter is just as busy as last night's. The plan for tomorrow is to get an earlier start and try and do a 20 mile day to set up a short hike into Erwin Friday morning.","

Tyler Morrissette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652443,"4/28 day 29 20 mile day on good and cool weather. Went over big Bald and little bald. We took many breaks all morning. We got sweet trail magic in some coolers on the trail. Had a banana, yohoo, and a hard boiled egg. Supposedly I took a shit in the last privy for a long while. Needed to listen to my audio book for the last 5 miles or so to distract me from the suck. 
4/29 day 30 We were up early eager to get into Erwin and start our Nero off as soon as possible. The hike down was easy enough and we were lucky to have perfect weather to take some photos of the iconic bridge over the river from high on the ridge.   I had seen that bridge before in so many other people's trips that it was an exciting moment to see it for myself and snap some photos to remember the moment. We checked into bunks at Uncle Johnny's Hostel which is a staple on the AT for years. Nothing fancy about the accommodations but it had what we needed, friends, food, beer, shower, laundry, and a resupply with town food. We walked 1.5 miles to a Mexican restaurant that was inside a gas station which was excellent and very filling. Then we walked another mile to a small grocery store to shop for our planned 3 days of up coming hiking. Then we hung out like bums in the parking lot trying to get a ride back to the hostel. Our grocery bags were heavy and it was getting hot. After 30 minutes we decided to just start walking and put our thumbs out. We got back to the gas station/Mexican restaurant and bought 6 packs to go then headed off on foot again. About a quarter mile down the road a truck driven by a nice guy offered us a ride in the back. We hopped in quickly, not wanting to be on the hot pavement anymore. In just a few minutes we were back and thanking the guy for the ride.  We hung out the rest of the afternoon eating and drinking whatever trail magic was around and packed into the shuttle bus at 5 to go to town. Not many choices in Erwin so wla group of us decided on McDonald's where I ate a double quarter pounder with bacon meal, another double quarter pounder, and a spicy McChicken sandwich. Stuffed to the gills we walked across the street to the grocery store to pickup more beer. Austin wanted donuts so he ran into a Dunkin and came out smiling and running with a box of 6 donuts over his head. A guy with one leg in a wheel chair by the Dunkin Donuts yelled something to Austin and he walked back to the guy and they went back into the store together. After a bit of a wait Austin comes back out with an additional dozen donuts and a box of donut holes. The guy happened to be an ex Army veteran and just wanted to buy Austin more donuts because he loved how excited it was. They got to talking in line and the person serving them heard that they were both veterans and just gave Austin the food for free 😅.  So that evening besides too many beers everyone got to share in all the dounts too. A lot of the same folks were there too including Glamazon, Foot Long,  Intel, Shit Show, Grand Master, Scorpion, Cara, and many more. I got to bed at a reasonable 10pm but heard the next day that folks were up till midnight and even 2am. Jeez
4/30 day 31 since everyone passed out the place was quiet and everyone stayed in their bunks until about 730. We packed up, said goodbye to everyone and the three of us headed off along the river to start our planned 17 Mike day. The first part of the hike was pleasurable but then it started to get very steep and hot outside especially in the exposed areas. We trudged along and we're saved at the top of Beauty Spot gap by some amazing trail magic. Brauts, beers, burgers. Everything we could need including chairs in the shade. We chatted with the group who were all former hikers from 2016-2017 time frame and you could tell they all loved the trial so much even still. There was a great dog who needed lots of pets and it's owner was a young cute red head with the trail name Sassy. I knew I needed to get out of there ASAP 😅. The trail magic helped but it was still a climb over Unaka Mountain. It was a pretty quiet walk down hill until we got to Cherry Gap Shelter for the night. We had plans of going over Roan mountain tomorrow but the weather looks sketchy with lightning in the forecast so we are not sure where we will end up in the evening. Everyone wants to be safe so I expect we will go as far as we can before the mountain and wait out the storm at a lower elevation.
5/1 day 32- the weather weighed on minds overnight and the whole camp was up early to get a start at the day before the rain.  It wasn't a bad 7 miles to Clyde Smith shelter where we other hikers had stopped for lunch. Even with the forecast of thunderstorms in the afternoon going over Roan Mountain some hikers decided to try and make it to the shelter on the other side. My group decided to finish our day after 15.7 miles at a tent site just 1.4 from the peak. It did rain on the way up which made hiking more uncomfortable since we added hot rain gear. We'll just have to see how the evening is weather wise and if we made the right choice to hold up and summit in the morning.  When we were in camp we were having a hard time locating some small rocks to use for throwing a bear line. Austin says, in his stereotypical Native American man voice, ""Old Indian trick"" and the just started to throw and smash larger rocks together to make smaller rocks. 😂 We all break out laughing and it's the highlight of the evening for sure.  The forecast looks great tomorrow so we should have spectacular views from the top of the last 6k footer until the whites. 🙂
5/2 day 33- the weather was cool and sunny when we were out of camp by 730. The hike over Roan Mountain was uneventful and there wasn't really a good place to take in the views the from top. But we definitely got views later in the day. After Roan we went over Round Bald, Jane Bald, Hump Mountain, and Little Hump Mountain. On the last two th views were spectacular and we had almost 350 vistas of the mountains all around us. We then finally walked out of NC for the very last time and are firmly in TN from now on. We ended the day with a hitch up to Station at 19E which is a Hostel set over a bar. We had drinks, showers, did laundry and had more beers. I had an amazing Ruben sandwich for dinner and a few of us including Somo stayed up till a little past 10 chatting. It was great to meet another army vet Grandpa Groot. 
5/3 day 34- the hostel beds were comfortable and the bunk room cool so I had no problem sleeping through the night even after so many beers. I got my gear and food vag organized with a cup of coffee until breakfast was served promptly at 8. Scrambled eggs, biscuit with gravy, home fries, and a large pancake made for a terrific free hiker breakfast.  The hike all morning was wonderful as the terrain was more gradual and the views were splendid. We often hiking along side a river or through a wide meadow. Everything seemed to have greened up overnight. We saw multiple waterfalls and had no issues finding water. The afternoon seemed to drag on for me and even listening to an audio book couldn't bring me away from the heat and pace of the hike. We finally made it to Moreland Gap Shelter where I was hungry, thirsty, and my body was covered in salt. We may get rain overnight as the clouds are getting rather dark and we can hear thunder in the distance. Tomorrow we will hike 16 miles more and stay at Boots Off Hostel and do another 2 day resupply. 
5/4 day 35- Somo lied about the radar and that we wouldn't see any rain today. Fucker. The morning was wet and it was a choice between what was falling from the sky and what was coming out of my skin. Fortunately the hike was flatter and pleasant on my feet. We had some nice views of the river and a nice tricky section right along a rocky outcropping along the river. After a snack we started the 4 mile hike up 1800 feet. By this time the sun was out and it was getting hot. I carried the minimum amount of water required to get me to the top and lunch. After that it was down hill nearly 2000 ft and a moderate walk into Boots Off Hostel. Repeat the same chore tasks of resupply, McDonald's, and beer. The accommodations here including the bunks, shower, and toilet area are too notch but the girl at the front desk is a grump. The plan for tomorrow is 16 miles. 5/5 day 36- breakfast was satisfactory and we had to each have a breakfast beer to lighten our road sodas to only two each. We expected an OK day after we did the climb in the morning. The walk around the lake was nice and flat and even with the leaves coming out fully now we had some nice views including over the dam. 2k feet up and we were on the ridge line. Even though guthook showed a flat-ish walk the ups just seemed longer and harder than the downs should balance out. We took an hour break around 2:45 for an hour in a shady grassy area and I took a nice nap. It rained overnight and I kept sliding into the corner of my tent. Only 16 miles planed for today. 
5/6 day 37- it rained overnight and I fought the whole time sliding into the foot box end of my tent. We weren't in much of a rush today but Matt and I were still ready to leave by 730. Austin was not ready till 830. The hiking was gloriously flat and easy and we had great views through the trees and in wide open fields.  We stopped at 11 at a shelter and decided to have lunch early and try to make the last 8.3 miles before the bad rain started. We booked it! Hiking hard and fast since the terrain remained relatively flat. It did start to rain but I only really needed to put on my raincoat for the last hour or so. Saw some beautiful Lady Slipper flowers along the trail right before getting to Adingdon Gap Shelter that made me think of Meme. 😀 Rain and thunder storms are in the forecast but who knows. Staying in the shelter tonight and only 10 miles tomorrow into Demascus. Most likely will do lunch as soon as we get into town 😊. 
""Show me a completely smooth operation and I’ll show you someone who’s covering mistakes. Real boats rock.""
5/7 day 38 - in the evening last night the storm really came through and we had lighting, thunder, and a lot of rain. Matt braved the weather and the rest of the hikers stayed in the shelter. We meet a hiker named Rocks who is finishing her hike in Damascus. We had just 10 miles to hike into Demascus and it was a nice and easy walk. It rained a bit but we didn't mind the cool weather. We strolled into Demascus around 11 and headed right to the diner for lunch. Checked into Broken Fiddle Hostel and had a great shower in the outdoor shower and enjoyed the afternoon off with all the other hikers including Rocks, Day Break, Painkiller, Calico and Piper. We watched Cool Hand Luke that afternoon also. I had to commit to my trail name, Baffles. 
5/8 day 39 -The zero on Damascus was like most other zeros. I slept inside, went to breakfast, resupplied at a grocery store, drank beers and generally hung out. It was much quieter as the weather was good and very few hikers showed up to stay overnight. Matt, Austin and I played darts well into the evening after having dinner at the chicken place up the road. 
5/9 day 40 -I had slept well wearing earplugs and didn't get up until at little past 8. Got organized and then walked into town to ship my thermarest back at the post office and grab an egg sandwich from the Diner. Matt stayed behind for a while to pickup more supplies while Austin and I hiked onward into Virginia. The hike was easier and we had no problem going 9 miles by lunch time. We finished doing our 18 miles by 6:00 at a tent site near mile 489.3. Tomorrow the weather looks great again and it's the plan to do another 18 mile day. 
5/10 day 41-the morning was cool as we headed off. My group was excited since we would pass through the Grayson Highlands today. We arrived just outside a small gate that thru would peas us over a alrge hill and into the land of the wild ponies!  The warmed and we were disappointed we didn't see any ponies even after another hours walk. After lunch we came around a corner that overlooked a meadow below. Ponies! Many of them. They were so used to humans we walked across the grass and stood amongst them. The remainder of the after included seeing lots of ponies (and cows) and walking on rocks. Our feet were soar by the end of that long and hot today. We had the best campsite of the trip up on top of a grassy meadow with mountains behind us and ponies walking around us all evening. 
5/11 day 42 -pretty normal day on trail without many views or interesting things to see. Weather was good, although a bit hot. We walked across a beautiful meadow after being in the trees all day. After meeting up with Somo the day before we wrote down our plan for the next few days. It will involve not a ton of miles but lots of town food and easy resupply options. Camped at a tent site at 527.4 with only a few to go to meet our free shuttle at 11:00. 5/12 day 43 -the morning started with a bitch of a hill and I was sweating before I even got to the top. Most of the miles were easy in elevation but the ground felt like what PA is described as to us. We made it early to the Partnership Shelter at the Mt Rogers National Recreation Area and hung out with Somo, Ducky and Pants until our shuttle. We got dropped off at a shopping plaza that has everything we needed. Matt and Austin got sunglasses at Walmart while I got breakfast food for two days. There wasn't much I needed at the grocery store but I got a sandwich to pack out for dinner. We ate at McDonalds and then at the Chinese restaurant (which wasn't very good). We bought beers, drank and hung outside the stores like bums waiting for our bus to come back at two. We hiked just a few miles to a camp site where we finished the beers we packed out and thought of the Mexican restaurant we plan on eating tomorrow for lunch. 
5/13 day 44 -the lazy miles and hiking continued. It rained over night making everything messy to pack. We had just enough miles before town to setup an clean lunchtime arrival. We took a quick stop at the Settlers Museum of Southern Virginia. My mom would have approved the educational excursion 😅. Lunch at El Burrito Loco (attached to the Exxon gas station) was devine and cheap. The waiter pushed another table together for the three of us so we'd have enough room to fit all the food we ordered. After lunch we grabbed beers from the other gas station and went over to the Sweet Water restaurant for some of their famous lemonade (uses a lot of honey). While waiting for a rain shower to pass we saw Ron the Builder who was staying at the alpaca farm. We likely cross paths with him over the next few days. 
5/14 day 45 -rain again overnight. We ""agreed"" tents down at 730 but Austin thought that meant he had to have his down by 730 where Matt and I understood it meant tents start to be taken down at 730. Somehow after 500+ miles we still are not synced up. We hike up and past the 1/4 way mark!!!!  We spent the rest of the day in the green tunnel except for a few nice open meadows that gave us our only opportunity for views all day. My right sin muscle really started to hurt over the last two miles and I'm hoping a night in a real bed helps. Tonight we're starting of Bear Garden Hostel and having a nice quiet evening. We put our brains together and have a plan to get to Pearisberg by 5/19, we never need to carry more than two days of food, and have a nice zero there. I'm also hoping to get my resupply box with summer gear and send all of this heavy stuff home!
5/15 day 46 -nice night at the hostel. My leg hurt all day. Stayed at the side of the road at FS 623. My sleeping pad leaked down all night 😤. 
5/16 day 47 -my leg hurt all day (maybeeee not as bad as yesterday). I hiked most of the day by myself behind the guys since I was much slower. Finished my audio book of The Hobbit which I enjoyed and was a pretty good distraction. By 2 I made to to brushy mountain outpost which doesn't look like much but I shoved in a bacon cheeseburger with fries and the biggest two scoop ice cream of moose tracks I've ever purchased. Even resupply to get us to the next resupply at the end of tomorrow. 
5/17 day 48- leg hurt all day, my ankle is swollen and is starting to be soar also. Listened to podcasts most of the day which helped distract me during the relatively flat and boring walk. Was surprised by trail magic by Gifter an and Agga (polish girl). Had a few beers (packed out one) some watermelon and snacks. Only two miles to Doc's Knob Shelter and 8 point something into Pearisberg. 
5/18 day 49 -the shelter was cool with a huge deck which made up for the total lack of flat camping spots, Austin and I stayed in the shelter with a few other hikers. It was a day of fairly long water carries but the terrain was doable.","
