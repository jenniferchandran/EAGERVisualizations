Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645934,"This year our section hike will have three parts.  First, we will hike the Approach Trail to Neel's Gap as my wife has not done that part yet.  Seems crazy for me to repeat that Approach Trail but will be fun to do it with my wife.  If she doesn't divorce me, we will then drive up to Davenport Gap and hike to Hot Springs.  After I go to work in Vermont, we will hike from Hwy 9 near Bennington, VT and hike as far North as we can until I have to return for work.  We have really lightened up our packs, around 20lbs with food and water, so we hope to handle the climbs a little better.  Last year we did Shenandoah National Park and loved it.",,View Entry,"Nov 30, Tue",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646014,"Decided to cut back on weight a bit more and ordered my wife the Zpacks Arc Air Robic.  It will be nearly a pound lighter than her ULA Ohm, which she loves and will use on the Superior Hiking Trail.  The other weight savings will come from more water available on the Georgia section we are hiking and also with the smaller items we never used.  Our Triplex tent we use on the AT but our Copper Spur HV 3 we use in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.  The Triplex has worked great.Later in the summer when we hike Vermont, Route 9 north as far as we can get, we will bring our Thermocell Mosquito repeller than works with isobutane canisters.  We have found that it really does work within the cone of 12-15'.  Lots of water in that section as well which helps.  Hope to stay at Green Mountain Hostel in Manchester Center, one of our favorite places along with Stanimals.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Thu",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646252,"Wife just received her new pack for our Georgia hike on the AT this coming May.  She refused to believe it could carry all of her gear but 50L worked for our two five day hikes in Georgia and North Carolina.  She got a Zpack Arc Air and with pouches and water bottle holder it is 24.5 ounces.  She will keep her ULA Ohm for our longer hikes in Vermont and the Superior Hiking Trail.  I love my ULA circuit for those hikes but with some tall mountains ahead I will use my Zpacks Arc Haul.  We do carry a heavier Nemo Tensor air mattress but it is so comfortable it is hard not to bring.  Right now it is below zero so it helps to dream of hitting the trail.  Same with bringing the hammock, nine ounces but so relaxing.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Thu",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646626,"We are getting closer to go time.  Hoping for good weather but prepared for almost any weather.  Hope any hikers were out of that snowstorm!  The gear is together and now we are doing our workouts and walking whenever the weather allows.  Stretching is the big task as getting in and out of the tent is never my strong suit, especially in the morning.  Had to get some new Altra Lone Peaks as my old shoes have lost too much tread.  They worked great in Virginia, good traction and lots of room for my wide feet.  Where I am working now there are lots of places to walk but not enough hills but I did find a staircase too make use of.Good luck to all who are planning their 2022 hike, here is hoping the pandemic begins to fade.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Sun",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648473,"We are very excited!  Quite the weather patterns out east and we send good karma to those who are on the trail this weekend.  We received a message from the ATC warning of heavy snow.  As section hikers we must take whatever weather that is dished out as we have put our lives on hold for that narrow band of time.First night is at the Amicalola Lodge.  We will hike there from the parking lot.  Then we will just have to see how far we can go.  In our upper sixties it can be a challenge so we have our packs at 20lbs with food and water.  We walk everyday and workout so are hoping to stick to our plan of 8-10 miles per day.  We have all our shuttle reservations in and hotel room booked for on the way.Using a Zpacks triplex is a bit challenging in finding a large enough tent spot.  Later this summer in Vermont we hope to use our hammocks and tarps.  We are gradually knocking off the AT a section at a time.  I suppose New Hampshire and Maine are next before we get too infirm!  Our children and grandchildren are very supportive.  Most people think we are nuts though.  Thanks to KNA and Jay, Matt and JC for their great videos that help us plan.-Grammy and Pappy",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Fri",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649811,"Wife will be flying into St. Louis and we will pack up and drive to Amicalola.  Our son may join us there as he is in Atlanta for a job.  We will begin hiking on a Sunday and it should be a nice day.  We now have everything we need but of course have much to do.  Need to spray the clothes with Permethrin.  Some new hikers we are following like Maybe Jessica Hikes and others are really getting it done.  That provides motivation for us.  We will take it slow.  Last year we had a long stretch with no water and that taught us a lesson about knowing your water needs on warmer days.  Some tourists gave us a liter of cold water and that saved us!We are tired of Cliff Bars, Pop Tarts, etc. but know we need energy boosters. Kind Bars and Snickers always seem to get us down the road, also Propel.  We always make a few friends on the trail and look forward to meeting new folks.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Thu",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651832,"We finished our 2022 section hike and we had a wonderful time.  Made lots of friends!  Here is hoping that Greg, Grady, Nina, Dave and many more are all enjoying good weather and beautiful scenery.  We had good weather, only lightly rained once on the way to Hawk Mtn Shelter.  Our gear worked out very well.  Lots of owls to sing to us at night and even some gunfire from the Rangers.  Ron's Shuttles picked us up and took us to our truck for the return home but we spent the night in Dahlenga.  I highly recommend Ron as he was punctual and full of information.  I will post more photos later.",,View Entry,"May 25, Wed",0
