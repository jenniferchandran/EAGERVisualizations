Trimpi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646293,"In 2017 I attempted to walk the A. T.  starting on the 2nd March. I was so fortunate to start on the same day as a group of great hikers. One, El Vago, I would hike with for pretty much 400-500 miles and I thought myself fortunate to have met. 
I coped with freezing temperatures and awful conditions. Loving the challenge but in the end boredom got to me and I gave up and went home after 518 miles. 
It took 2 days to get home and by the end of the week I wished I was back on the trail. 
El Vago was the better man and hiked on to the end and summited Mount Katahdin. 
My return hike has been in the planning stage for five years now.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Sun",0

The plan had been for 2 friends to join me but that has fallen through so I'm on my own again. 
I'm not worried as if it's anything like last time when within a few days I had meet El Vago, Cody, Eight Track (and his lovely wife Kathy@RV), Dead guy ale, Einstein, Little Cheese and so many more. You are never really on your own. 
This time I have music, podcasts, shows, films, etc all to keep the grey matter entertained

Trimpi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646296,"On my last attempt my pack weight was 42lb and you really feel that at the end of the day's hike. I have spent a fortune getting my pack weight down. I believe I will be at about 32lbs, 4 days food/1.5litres of water included, winter weight with lots of what some might call luxury items. I am sending out a box of lighter summer gear to Harpers Ferry where I can return the heavier bits. 
I had planned on losing a load of weight myself but my super power is to look at a pie and put on 10 pounds. 
As I dropped 37lbs in seven weeks last time I'm looking forward to the AT diet again.

The day started great with an early pickup by Mary from Further shuttles and we were off to the mountains. Stopped at the Golden Arches for  a take away brekkie. Mary did have to ask me why I was trying to get into someone elses truck as we left. D, oh! 
Got to Amicolola centre around 9am. Registered as hiker 79 and had my photo taken by a lovely lady that works there but originated from East Sussex in the UK. About 30 miles from us. 
Great day to hike. Stairs took about an hour. I think I only swore at the last 400.
Made it to Springer mountain summit around 1430hrs for the photos and dropped into Springer mountain shelter for 3pm. Rain was due so I set up in the shelter which I had to myself. At 6pm the rain hit and boy did it come down hard. The shelter has a corrugated steel room and it was noisy especially with the wind blowing branches off. 
A young couple did appear just before the rain, said hello and left. 
All in all great day.

Time to deploy a last minute purchase, a hands free umbrella and it was brilliant. No its not a comedy hat with a small brolly on top. This thing was fiddly to get use to and all the nay sayers for these things it was great. On one occasion going through some rhododendrons I had to reach up and close it round my head. Great. I obviously walked into a tree as I couldn't see where I was going. But I was dry. Got to Hawk mountain shelter about 3pm and set up all to myself. A couple of hours later first Green feather and then Pie joined me. These guys had meet at Stovers Creek shelter and walked the six miles from there. They had Frogg Togg rain gear that had ripped, they were soaked. Pie was a gent of my age who had served in the US Air force and been based in the UK for years. He had developed a taste for British ale. Top man. I watched some film on the phone and off to sleep with the rain beating down

It was only spitting as I walked out but stopped within 30mins. It was a glorious day to hike but really tough terrain. There were 2 stream crossings to do during the day both were fast and deep owing to the heavy rains. You had to be real careful. The first went over the top of my left boot. The second had positioned a see saw rock at the begin thar nearly put me in. Harsh words were aimed at that rock. 
I got to Gooch for about 3pm. A young couple had the upper area and as I was setting up below another hiker, Voodoo arrived and set up across from me. Hot food and drink went down well. 
 It was due to be a cold evening so everything went into the bottom of my sleeping bag. Filter, gas, clothes and anything wth a battery. The frost will damage all of the above. 
I dropped off around 6pm as it got really dark. Warm and comfortable. That was about to change.

My sleeping bag and clothing was keeping me comfortable but I had to snuggle down and close the opening to keep the bitter draft out. I stayed like that till sun up when I forced myself to move. I made the error of filtering 2 bottles of water the night before for the morning and they were frozen. Lucky I could use my dirty bag to get some water from the stream. Hot drink and a meal went down well. Anything even mildly damp or sweaty was now frozen. Trying to get my boots on was virtually impossible. Voodoo was warming his trail runners with his cooker, risky but effective. Voodoo and I both tried using 'Hot hands' to try and warm our foot wear up. They were useless only just heating a few degrees. Funny but ten hours later in the hotel room they were red hot. Something to remember. Voodoo was being picked up at Woody Gap for a birthday party and the couple above were getting off there too owing to the weather. The forecast was for another bitter night and as I was wearing the last of my dry clothes I arranged a shuttle. I walked the 5 miles to Woody Gap getting a great view enroute. An Oldies playlist my daughter put together made the hike sail past. Mary was there to pick me up within ten minutes of arriving and I was off to Blairsville and a hotel room.

I wanted to put some miles in so stretched my legs whilst listening to an audio book. One of James Haskells. I chatted with a really nice oriental guy who I saw a number of times. He told me his name was 'Song'. Pretty sure that was his real name. I also meet one of the trail maintenance guys raking out the rain gullies. I thanked him as it is so important. Then I hit Blood mountain and that is a tough climb. It took me a number of hours to get to the shelter which is bleak. I got lost at the top amongst the bare rock and started to descend on a game track. Swearing a lot to climb back to the trail and I'm now descending correctly. I got to Neels Gap just in time to hit the outfitters for a new water filter, sleeping bag liner and some food. The staff in there were lovely, I make this point which will become clear tomorrow. Tent up and food cooked in time for an amazing sunset. Time for my first night in my tent on this trip.

As I did so a guy passed me and couldn't even return my morning greeting. He returned about ten minutes later and commented I better not burn his solid stone building down. He didn't wait for my witty retort and probably only wanted to identify he owned the place. Thus he employs lovely staff to make up his lack of charm. I gave him a trail name second word 'end'. Church towers have the first word in them. It was a short distance day. Less than 7 trail miles but I made a huge error. The shelters are either on the trail or the book tells you how far from the trail they are. I had not checked this and the shelter was 1.3 miles and I was committed before I checked this. I hate wasted mileage. Shocker I had the shelter to myself and no one else was daft enough to go to it. I settled in for a good night sleep.

I tried to call for a shuttle from Deep gap as the book advised but no answer. Around 1530hrs I popped out at Dicks Creek gap but was dismayed to find the parking lot was empty. In only ten minutes A German thru hiker, 'Picnic'  stopped and offered me a lift to Hiawassi.

The pool and jacuzzi I was dreaming of are closed. Whilst the floor I am on is a building site at the opposite end. This is where the laundry facilities are, these are now covered in plaster dust. The rooms, breakfast and staff are great but no building, hiker or veterans discount to be had here. I just enjoyed a meal across the road. Last time we had the all you can eat buffet which wasn't to my taste so this time I had a stunning steak with all the trimmings. Mike may remember a story regarding 2 of our hiking companions and the waitresses from this restaurant. More wishful thinking by one and a panic by the other. Thanks for all the comments in the guest book. Whether you are at home in the UK or sat in Texas. I appreciate you coming along.

It was a gradual up hill most of the day and early on I passed 'Summit' who I had meet a few days earlier. An hour later I spoke with Fred, a fully badged up trail ambassador who imparted lots of good advice. He also looks after that area of the trail, he was off to clear rubbish from the nearby shelter.

At one stage i stepped on a wet log to find it was icy and went straight down. I was lucky as I landed on my pack and tent bag that split. I also landed on my right elbow which ached all day. The final climb to the summit was a scrabble and hard world. At the base of the fire tower I found Deluxe, Hammer and Old Goat. The tower looms above the tree line but as I was knackered and scared of heights so I didn't take a step up. The tower is also the 100 mile mark.

As we were setting us we were joined by 'In tune' and 'Hot moose'. They were a young couple who had meet on the trail and were musically inclined. In tune played a guitar and sang for us.

All of us were aching and complaining about the terrain. As we had finished early Old Goat set about starting a fire and he got a really good one going. G Gnome and Runaway sat in front of it till quite late whilst I headed for my sleeping bag as it was the only warm place once the sun drops.

The three of us chilled out but when I heard it was party bonfire night near my tent and politely asked about it, as tents have zero noise insulation.

I turned right and headed for Damascus in the driving rain which became snow. The terrain was great and my app told me I was hitting 22 minute miles which I was pleased with. The snow and rain stopped and the sun came out which was great. Three miles before Damascus I hit the border of Tennesse and Virginia so I stopped at the notice to take photos. Another hour and I was in town, more photos. I had booked accommodation at the Mountain Laurel B&B which I can really recommend. I found the place and was given a nice room. I received a call from Recycle to join them that evening. I meet them at the Distillery and we sampled some bourbon and cocktails. Then dinner at a nearby diner with some beers and onto a micro brewery for a lot more beers. It's was an excellent night and Recycle, Brand New and their friend Bill were amazing company and I am grateful for the invite. I got back to the accommodation to find another guest had inadvertently locked me out.

It was a relatively easy day and I made it by midday and was first there so claimed my spot. If possible I always try to get a spot alongside one of the walls so I only have a hiker on one side of me. 
Everyone else had the same idea and first the group from the previous shelter arrived. Sunshine and Mako tented, as did Gandalf. But Squirrel her husband Linus and Survivor claimed spots in the shelter. A very focused and serious hiker name of Bricks appeared and claimed another spot. He told us how upset he was having to stop so early. 
A section hiker name of Frank appeared and set up his Triplex and came and chatted. Turns out Frank, Gandalf and myself were all ex navy so we got on really well. 
The rain started around 3pm and was solid till the early hours. Other hikers arrived but most had to put up a tent. One going by Taffy put his up in the driving rain.

At one stage there was a stream crossing that had me balancing precariously on boulders but I got across in one piece.

Four more miles and I made it to Trimpi shelter. It was an odd little shelter the style of which I had never seen before. Already in situ was KG, Pappa Bear, Lightening, Professor and Frank appeared. We were joined by Jaspar later. It was a nice group but made for a tight squeeze. 
There was snow forecast and the shelter was pretty open near my feet so I was worried about my sleeping bag getting wet but when it did snow the flakes didn't blow in. I was relieved as in the hour that it snowed it was hard and settled. 
I slept fairly well and have been treated by Frank who had fortified my coffee or hot chocolate with bourbon each night. Legend. 
Thankfully the snow stopped and it was a fairly dry night. Unless it was me no one else snored. Excellent.

I meet Frank for an all you can eat Chinese and then we booked a cab into town for beers. We got in but then found the cab was picking up other customers with a drop in to buys beers and off to theirs. It took a while before he got round to dropping us off. We went to a micro brewery that was more like a whitewashed basement with frat boys and poor beers. So we moved on to more of a sports bar where I tried their beer but moved on to single malt and wine.

I set off around 0730hr with nearly 10 miles to do before reaching Dalesville. There were a lot off great views during the day especially down to the local river. I passed under a number of electrical pillons enroute to town and had to cross a railway line on the outskirts of town. The trail came out at the edge of the interstate and I had to cross 6 lanes of traffic to reach the Super8 hotelWhilst I was there I bumped into Survivor nursing an injury, 2 pencil, Agony and Old Goat. It was a big reunion and it was good to see them all. The room I was given was excellent and I went to the nearby Mexican restaurant for a really good meal.

Trimpi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650843,"For sometime I have had enough of living out of my rucksack. Eating at restaurants alone and in general doing this trail alone. I have meet some amazing people but miss home life normality. I achieved 730 miles and had a great time but decided to return home. Thanks to everyone that sent words of encouragement.
