Garrett H,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652653,"First off, my apologies for the delay. As I type this on my phone I am sitting in Monson, ME at Shaw's Hostel, about 10 days in and didn't post jack before starting our thru hike. Had no idea how wild the 100 Mile Wilderness would be.The trip so far has been fulfilling and difficult, and started off much more complicated than it needed to be. At National Airport leaving DC Delta decided no one was flying to Bangor about 2 hours before our scheduled takeoff. We scrambled to find another flight and after a lot of grief ended up deciding to fly into Portland later that day. Karen, my ever-patient girlfriend had gone ahead on an earlier flight, so agreed to graciously drive our rental car two hours south to scoop us up in Portland then drive north. At our layover in La Guardia, NYC, the flight to Portland was delayed several times, pushing our arrival and optimism further and further. Finally, at boarding, the gate agents demanded 4 people give up their seats because the plane was smaller than anticipated. We all waited around for volunteers as the Delta incentive crept higher and higher. Once the pot got to $1200 we had our 4 volunteers and could finally board. We overheard the same issue on many flights at nearby gates. A headache for many.A few hours late, and just happy to be there we got off at Portland with Karen waiting, and napping at baggage claim. We were all just so stoked to be anywhere but in an airport. The group settled on a beer at a nearby brewery and an overpriced lobster roll, then quietly drove two hours through the night to crash at our Bangor Airbnb for a couple hours. Now only we could screw up our arrival (spoiler, we didn't).The next morning I woke up with a head full of steam. We arranged to set up a food drop in the 100 Mile Wilderness for five days out, and had to supply the food to the outfitter by noon. We rushed around Walmart like crazies grabbing all the ramen we could carry, and made our appointment on time in Milinocket with the AT Lodge. Upon arrival, I realized the only one in a rush was me, as the lodge purveyor, Trash Panda, couldn't care less we were slightly late. We stuffed half our food into a bucket, the other half in our packs and drove to Baxter State Park. Lots more to tell...",,View Entry,"May 27, Fri",0
Garrett H,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652797,"After a delicious meal of Karen rolled burritos we all snuggled into our sleeping bags the night before summiting Mount Katahdin. It would be a very difficult climb by any standards just to start the trip off: 5 miles straight up and back.
Trying to sleep that night was almost impossible. I was a ball of nervous energy, and nearby our friend Brett was snoring so loud we wouldn't be able to sleep anyway. Around 6am the morning of the climb I woke up to Karen wide eyed. Both of us had maybe slept 30 minutes. 'I am not going to be able to do this.' she said. Welp, she proved herself wrong.
The whole trip up to the summit of Maine's highest peak took from 7am to 6pm, and almost killed all of us. The climb was steep, and above treeline the wind whipped us mercilessly from side to side. For several miles the entire hike was nothing but sheer rock faces and scrambling on all fours. Exhausted we reached the plateau, and watched as happy 20 something's scampered up in front of us. Cold and dead tired we snapped a few quick pictures, and quietly climbed back down. The views were breathtaking, we almost quit before we got to them, but after several hours we finally began our thru hike, and gutted out the first 5 miles of the AT back to camp.","

Garrett H,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652930,"Waking up after climbing Katahdin, our legs fet like they were filled with concrete. Brett had slept for near 14 hours and we all had cuts and sunburns to show. The mosquitoes hadn't died down for a second since we got to Baxter State Park, and I woke up that morning wondering, would I really be starting the Appalachian Trail? 
As we slowly started to collect our camp, sadness started to set in. Karen would be heading home and I wouldn't see her in person for at least a month. It would be difficult and different. A true test of our relationship, and I was bummed the day I had planned for months for had finally arrived. We said our goodbyes as mosquitoes swirled around. She stood on a park bench and begged me to be careful. Brett hugged me sternly ""Don't die"". I think both were more than glad to be heading out of the buggy woods to AC and airport food. 
Once they drove off down the road, Dan and I got to walking, mostly in quiet, down south out of Baxter, through swamps and pristine lakes, and into the 100 Mile Wilderness. 
Day one was mostly uneventful. The mosquitoes tortured us relentlessly and we walked slow. At Abol Bridge, on the south end of Baxter, a woman in a headnet came up from behind us hiking at full tilt. This was Gwen, our first southbound friend, who advised us the campground we were considering was a ripoff for 13$ when a free lean to was just 3 miles further. We bought bug spray and sodas at the camp store, and because it was only 2:30, decided to walk a few more miles to find Gwen. She was there waiting for us, and we prepared our camp food and talked until bed time, around 6:30.","Katahdin Stream Camp Ground

Garrett H,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653495,"The 100 Mile Wilderness is an accurate name. Right after leaving Baxter State Park and Katahdin southbound hikers are thrown into a trial by fire of hiking logistics. The 100 mile wilderness is both 100 miles, and wild, with no real roads or towns connecting this stretch of trail to the outside world. Most thru hikers take around 10 days worth of food to complete the wilderness in one go.
As Daniel and I hiked in, we were nervous for what was coming. For the first 4 days, the only people we saw were each other and our new hiker friend Gwen. The mosquitoes were relentless and I spent most of my days in a head net and covered in deet.  About half way into the wilderness the terrain changed from swamp and lakes to mountain and we got our first chance to test our trail legs, almost passing out with our overfull packs every steady climb. We were rewarded with days of scenic Maine views, rocky muddy trails, mosquitoe bites, and sore feet. 
After 7 days we were just 3 miles from the end when we finally ran into 2 new southbound hikers, Will and Colin. In the morning we all became quick friends, as we stomped the short hike into Monson Maine and back onto paved roads and civilization.","
