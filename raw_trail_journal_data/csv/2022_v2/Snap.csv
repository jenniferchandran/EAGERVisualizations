Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645404,"Last week I decided it was time to set a goal an stick to it, not that I haven't in the past, I have. I do have a tendency to get over zealous about projects and activities, new skills and whatnot, then see them fall to the wayside months later, hence the nickname and title. I'm going to see this one through, and making this journal is one way to hold myself accountable for it. My intention is to section hike the the AT beginning on April 30, 2022. That gives me six months to prepare, map out, and train for this start date. I know I can't do a complete thru-hike, yet, but I will. For now I am going to map out a 3 season section hike plan. I've already spent hours researching blogs, websites, maps and gear. I have bought a few items (trail runners, wool socks, books, a new water bottle, paracord, and a few carbine clips). I also went through some of my gear for kayaking, knowing some of it would work for hiking as well, and I wouldn't have to buy doubles. I was going to grab the trail guide, but it seems like a new version will be available soon, so I am holding out for the latest copy. I'll keep posting, and any encouragement, advice or info will always be appreciated.",,View Entry,"Oct 25, Mon",0

Some of the videos were older and some were from this year's season, but I should say thank you to all that take the time to share these vlogs, information, humor, and experiences with us newbies. Please don't stop.I also spent some hours playing with the interactive walking map on Google. I wanted to try and map out at least one state, without the help of the guide, just for giggles. Ugh, it wasn't funny. However, what it did for me, was prove that the first trip in 2022 has gone from a 3/4 day trip to an 8/9 day trip. How many miles can I do in that span of time? That is the question that lingers at this moment. This weekend I walked a quick trail with ""the hubs"". Three miles in less than an hour, with taking in some waterfalls and snapping far too many pictures, per usual. I wonder what the standard is for most AT hikers.",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Tue",0
Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645472,"Everyday I research more information about the AT and hiking in general. Yesterday I set up my Pinterest Board for recipes. I figured I give a few of them a try over the next few months to determine which ones I like, which ones are a hassle, and compare costs. I also organized my hard copy journal into sections. Overkill, I  know, but it keeps me occupied and not wishing away the winter. So, the hubs is probably already sick of me talking about this. (Shrug). On our quick hike this weekend he did say he thought maybe we should do weekend sections closer to home, together. Okay, but the AT isn't ""closer to home"". Being who I am, and staying true to that, I also spent part of yesterday looking at the FLT. I think on weekends that aren't part of section hiking the AT, he and I can section hike the FLT. This may be a more feasible plan for his style of hiking. Is attempting to complete two trails at the same time taking on too much? As of today, I am saying. ""Nahhhh."" We shall see.",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Wed",0
Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645691,"Yesterday was a gorgeous day, great temperature, sunny and clear. It was the perfect day for a hike. So, in preparation for the AT I took the opportunity and went for a 4 mile hike. What a beginning eye opener. I say “beginning” because I am 100% sure there will be many more along the way. 
Other than when I was a kid, I never traipsed through the forest like I did yesterday. I have always done trails that are well used, well maintained, wide, and full of other people day walking to see scenery that the trail has been built around it. Nothing wrong with these trails, I love them. My family loves them, but they aren’t what I plan to experience. 
The hubs and I drove 40 minutes with no packs. I opted not to bring one this time and just carry water, a pocket of crackers, and my walking stick. He never brings one, unless we are camping. We were fine with it, but I did find myself thinking of scenarios where slack packing would have been a good idea. I mean I had 30oz of water, 6 squares of crackers, and a length of duct tape wrapped around the handle of my stick. In my defense, I was of the thinking that this trail wasn’t going to be different from others we had hiked. Not so, grasshopper.
We started off on a confusing foot, looking for the parking area marked out on the photo of the map I snapped with my phone. I thought we were in the right spot, I mean I did have the map. He did not, so we drove to the second place marked, and he felt more assured. (Shrug) No worries, I knew the distance I wanted to do, so I lead us down the trail back to where we originally drove, turned around and hiked back to the second area. (Argue with me, hmph.)
We picked up the blazes and followed them through an open field, past picnic tables, and ball fields. I thought, ok public park. Then we entered the tree line and the forest floor covered with all the fallen leaves. Interesting. It’s difficult to see the path under the leaves. This is what I told myself. Now I know that the path was not anything like I was used to and my brain immediately went into the land of my childhood. It was awesome.
We needed to depend on the colored blaze marks. It gave me the perfect opportunity to share with the hubs what I had learned so far. Explaining to him what the marks meant, and eventually he was taking the lead as we scaled up hillsides and down slopes into ravines. I was glad he was there, because we both lost sight of them on occasion. I hope the white blazes are easy to pick up too. 
Usually when we are out, be it camping or kayaking, I worry about insects or snakes. I did think about what could be out there around us, but I really wasn’t anxious, just aware. Another signal to me that I can do this. Also, every so often I’d see a marker that was for another trail, or one that gave encouragement and it solidified my plan even more. I found myself wondering where the other trails would take me, but I stayed true to the one I was on. 
Some of the items I took with me from walking this type of trail:
Bring a pack, even a light one, just in case.Sinking your boot in mud is all part of the hike.Soaking your boot in water is also all part of the hike.Boots and socks dry faster when walking.Drink the water you bring, even if you are not thirsty.It’s okay to take breaks on uphill climbs.Even if you are hiking with a partner, you do not have to stay side by side.Let your thoughts wander while you take in nature. Other people hiking are usually friendly, but may be wandering in their own thoughts too.I will admit my legs were a little stiff after sitting in the truck for the 40 minutes back home. But, it was so worth it.",,View Entry,"Nov 07, Sun",0

Christmas brought a few more needed items and I have been collecting and trying different recipes for the dehydrator. Still need to get three major items, but I am working on it. Looking forward to warmer weather so I can get back out on the trails around home. Also excited to read all the new details for this year from others.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Mon",0
