Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581349,"If all goes according to plan, I’ll start my 2018 northbound thru-hike of the AT exactly six weeks from tomorrow, on February 1, 2018. That is, unless the Chiefs are playing in the Super Bowl on the 4th, in which case I’ll start about a week later. However, based upon past performances by the Chiefs, I’ll continue planning on starting on the first. 
Some people think February 1 is too early to begin because of the weather. I’ve thought a lot about this, and have decided that if the weather turns ugly (extreme cold and/or a blizzard), I’ll get a motel room and hole up for a few days. I know it will be cold, but I like hiking in 25 to 30 degree weather. I have clothing to handle that kind of weather, and my down bag should keep me warm at night. A couple of weeks ago I completed a 3-day solo hike on the Ozark Trail in southeast Missouri. It was cold, probably in the low 20s at night, and I survived, although I learned to keep my Sawyer water filter in my sleeping bag, along with my water bottles and phone, else it will freeze. At any rate, I figure an old fart like me needs to start early so I can take it easy the first few weeks instead of pushing myself too much and risking injury. 
I have most of my equipment, and my pack weight with two liters of water and three days of food is about 21 pounds. I still have a lot of loose ends to take care of before starting, and I’ll go over those in the next few posts. 
Thanks for reading, and remember to take a walk today.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582029,"Of course, the Chiefs won’t be going to the Super Bowl, so I’m planning on sticking to my plan for a February 1 start, if not before. It seems as if I’ll never finish the preparations. Not just for the trail, but also other details such as doctors’ appointments, filing taxes, etc. I’ll be glad when I finally hit the trail so I can get on with it!I have my gear ready (I think), except for a few minor items. I need to make sure I have what I need for my first aid kit, plan food for the first 3-4 days, and get my drop boxes ready for mailing. Physically, I’m not in tip-top shape, but I feel fairly confident I can handle 6 to 8 miles a day. I definitely plan on not pushing it at the beginning. And if the weather becomes dangerous, I’ll get off the trail until it clears.On the other hand, I don’t feel totally prepared, but I suppose I never will.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582458,"Worries, worries, worries! I wake up at night full of fears and self-doubt. Have I packed enough gear? Too much gear? Will the weather be cold and rainy? Can I prevent hypothermia? Will I have enough food, or too much? Will I be able physically? Why haven’t I exercised more? Why haven’t I done more shakedown hikes? Aaaargh!
After waking, I try to calm my nerves. I went through a great prep class in November. (Thank you Scott and Arianne!). I survived a solo trip in December in the Ozarks. I may not be in the best shape, but I should be able to handle 31 miles in four days, where I’ll get to Mountain Crossing and a chance to resupply, adjust my gear, get a shower, and sleep in a real bed. I’m still nervous, but I know I can make it at least that far. 
It looks like the week of February 5th may have some nasty weather. If it’s too bad, I’ll get a room in Blairsville and hole up a few days. I know the weather will probably not be great since I’m starting so early, but if it looks dangerous, I’ll wait it out. 
I was honored to be interviewed on Steve Adams’ (Mighty Blue) podcast, episode 70. Give a listen if you want to hear us talk about our experiences and my plans to hike the AT this year. 
My plan is to head out of KC on Monday (January 29). In Nashville on Tuesday, I’ll donate a mountain dulcimer to a collection at Vanderbilt, but that’s a whole other story. On Wednesday, I’ll put my truck and camper in storage near Atlanta, then catch a ride to Dawsonville, near the start of the AT, and get a room. The next morning, after a big breakfast, I’ll catch a shuttle to Springer Mountain, hike one mile south to the summit, and take the first of my 5 million steps. And I’ll have to throw those worries away and see what happens.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582579,"Getting down to the wire. I’m in a motel about an hour and a half out of Atlanta. I’m tired of driving, that’s for sure, but I’m glad I’m almost there. 
After checking in, I went to Walmart to get food for the first 4 days. I also got some beer for tonight. Just to help calm my nerves. Lol. 
Tomorrow I’ll head to Atlanta to put my rig in storage. Then Ron Brown, an accommodating shuttle driver, will pick me up and deposit me near the top of Springer Mountain. I’ll walk south about a mile to the shelter, then settle in for the night. Thursday morning, I’ll walk the .2 mile to the top of Springer and begin my odyssey. It’s hard to believe it’s finally starting. 
Thanks for all the posts on my guest book. I appreciate them. Also, special thanks to Skeezix, Mighty Blue, Scott and Ariane for their advice and support. 
Next post should be from Springer!","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582651,"After getting the paperwork done to put my rig in storage, Ron the shuttle driver picked me up in Marietta about noon. We drove a couple of hours to Amicacola Falls State Park, where I signed in to officially register as a thru-hiker. I was hiker number 29, and I entered 25 lbs as my pack weight, although it’s probably a couple of pounds lighter than that. Since I was not doing the approach trail, which is an eight-mile brutal climb, Ron drove me to a parking lot about a mile north of Springer. The road was extremely rough, narrow, and muddy in spots. By the way, the word is that the approach trail will become officially part of the AT next year. No more being a wuss like me and riding to the top.
I then hiked .8 mile south to the Springer Mountain Shelter. I was getting settled in when, about 4:00, a hiker joined me. He was Joe, a section hiker who planned on spending a few days on the trail. We talked a lot, and I learned he was born and raised in Belfast, then came to the US to spend 25 years in the Marines including a lot of combat time. We stayed up late, talking around a campfire. 
By the time we got around the next morning and hiked the .2 mile south to the top of Springer, it was about 10:00. It was later than I had hoped, but I was finally on top of Springer, ready to begin my journey.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582653,"The day had finally arrived!
It had been cold and windy the night before, but I stayed nice and warm in my down bag. We got around later than I had hoped, but that’s ok. We hiked south the .2 mile through the fog to the top of Springer. I couldn’t believe it. I got emotional for a lot of reasons, but got over it and took some pics. (I’ll upload some when I get the picture upload feature to work.)
I then took my first step north, with only 4,999,999 more steps to the top of Katahdin. More or less. My journey was finally beginning. 
The weather continued to improve the farther north we went. We split up for a while when Joe stopped for water. I continued on, but screwed up when I took a wrong turn. After about 1/4 mile, I realized my mistake and backtracked to pick up the trail. Doh! I learned to check for white blazes before making a turn. 
I stopped for a lunch of tortilla and tuna at a wide spot in the trail. It was warm, and the sun poked through the clouds. A couple of southbound (SOBO) hikers walked by and complimented me on my choice for lunch location. I kept waiting for a server to bring me a glass of wine, but, alas, no one did. Anyway, I pushed on. 
It was an easy hike, and, of course, there were beautiful sites. Crossing a stream on a log was interesting, and I probably set the world record for the slowest time inching across it. But I didn’t fall, so going slow was fine by me. 
About 3:30, I came upon Joe on the side of the trail. He had gotten ahead of me when I took my detour. We were at the turnoff for a side trail to Long Creek Falls, and Joe wanted to call it a day and camp at the falls. We had planned on making it to Hawk Mountain shelter, another 2.9 miles. However, it would be close to sundown by the time we got there, so I agreed to go to the falls and call it a day. 
Ron, the shuttle driver, had told me about Long Creek Falls, telling me it was worth the while. He was right. It’s not far off the trail, and it is a sight—and sound. Future hikers—consider making this trip. It would be a great place for lunch on your first day. 
We pitched our tents and had an early dinner. Joe built a campfire, but we went to bed early.  I wrote in my journal snuggled in my down bag, then fell asleep to the sound of the falls, having survived my first day on the AT. Little did I know I’d be faced with a potentially serious situation the following morning.","Springer Mountain 
",Long Creek Falls,"Feb 01, Thu",5.20
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582657,"(The photo above is my temporary hiking partner, Joe. I neglected to get a pic of me at the falls.)
I slept well, staying warm inside my bag and tent. It occasionally rained throughout the night, but when I got up at 4:00 to relieve myself, the sky was clear and the moon was shining brightly. I crawled back in my bag to sleep a couple of more hours. 
My alarm went off at 6:00, but I snoozed a half hour before starting to pack my gear in the dark. Our plan was to shove off by 8:00 to try to make it to Gooch Mountain shelter, about 10 miles up the trail. 
By 7:00, I was packing my tent when Joe rolled out of his tent. He was shivering, his teeth chattering. His tent had leaked, and his bag was soaked. He wasn’t his usual talkative self. He and I both knew he was on the verge of hypothermia. One of my greatest fears is hypothermia. I do everything I can to make sure my bag stays dry, because it can be dangerous, even fatal. 
He wrapped himself in a blanket and began walking around. Ron the shuttle driver had given me 3 hand warmers, so I gave two to Joe and kept one for myself. It was bitterly cold, and the wind was howling. Our water bottles were freezing in front of our eyes. 
I pulled out my stove and made him a cup of coffee. Not Starbucks, but it was hot. He started warming up, but, since I had changed out of my down and into my hiking clothes, I was getting cold. My fingers and toes were numb. 
We finally got on the trail. It was clear and sunny, but cold, and the wind was ferocious. After about a mile, Joe said he needed to get off the trail. In 3.4 miles, we came to Hightower Gap, which is a road crossing. Since I finally had cell service, Joe called Ron. He said he could pick him up in an hour and a half, which would be 1:00pm. I realized I couldn’t make it to Gooch after waiting so long, and the weather report didn’t look good for the weekend, especially Sunday, so I decided I should also ride to Dahlonega and get a room. Also, I could not get warm, even with my heavy gloves and balaclava. It was a miserable hour and a half. Some Army Ranger trainees walked down the road, out practicing orienteering, so we talked with them a short while. 
Ron showed up right on time, and upon seeing me yelled “Vagabond!” We rode to town, with Ron pointing out mountains and information about the trail while driving down a rough, muddy road. He has been a great resource, and he’s always been there exactly when he says he’ll be. 
We checked into the Mountain Inn, which gives hikers almost half off the usual rate. We were the first hikers to stay here this year. 
After a long, hot shower, I hoofed it down the hill to do my laundry and grab a bite to eat. The guy at the laundromat was extremely helpful, and said I was the first thru-hiker he had seen this year. I thanked him for his hospitality, and he said “You’re my customer!” If only all businesses treated their customers that way. 
After considering the weekend forecast, I decided to hole up here until Monday morning. It’s supposed to get nasty Saturday night and Sunday, with rain, freezing rain, and snow, along with cold temperatures and wind. Next week looks to be much better, with highs in the 50s and lows above freezing. Ron is scheduled to pick me up at 8:00 Monday morning to deposit me back at Hightower Gap. No yellow blazing for me!
I had hoped to have done about 32 miles by Sunday, but I figure it’s better to be safe. Some people told me this is too early to start a thru-hike, but I always said if the weather got too bad, I’d get a room until it gets better. So for now, I’m taking it easy, enjoying the creature comforts, and catching up on my journal. But on Monday, it’s back to the trail!","Long Creek Falls

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582663,"A lazy day in Dahlonega. I went up to eat a motel breakfast this morning, and Joe was in the lobby waiting for a cab to get him started on his journey home. He had come out here to learn some things, and was ready to go home. He said he had been in a tub and of hot water the previous afternoon until he finally got his core temperature back up. He hadn’t planned on doing a long hike, and it was time. He’s a good guy, and I wish him the best. 
After breakfast, I updated my journal and  lounged around the room for a while. I decided to walk the mile to the square to get some supplies at the outfitter and eat a nice meal. Just then Ariane called. She and Scott were at Mountain Crossings, and their class had ended early. They wanted to drive to Dahlonega to meet me for an early dinner. I said “Sure!” 
I stopped by the outfitters to pick up a few things, then met Scott and Ariane outside. We walked to a burger joint for some good food. I also had a couple of beers, which were excellent. 
They wanted to know all about my travels to date. I filled them in, and got some good advice from them. I don’t want to get maudlin, but they are such nice people. I guess it’s part of the trail universe where people are so friendly and helpful without expecting anything in return. It’s so different from the “synthetic world,” as Dixie calls it. Hikers, it’s worth your time to check them out on Facebook. They offer a lot of information, and they hold an excellent class to help prepare for the trail. Search for TheBackpackerTV. 
After saying goodbye, I walked the mile back to my room. They offered a ride, but I declined. I needed to get a few steps in today.","

I don’t know most of you, but your words of encouragement mean a lot. I can’t respond to them all, but I appreciate them. Bets, I don’t have any resupply points set up, but I’ll let you know if I need something along the way. Celeste, I guess I am “Vagabond Bearcat!”  Lol. 
I walked to the square in Dahlonega again today. It’s really an interesting town, with a lot of unique restaurants and shops. I had a gyro at a Greek restaurant, then walked over to the outfitters and talked with Eric, who works there. He’s planning a thru-hike next year after he graduates from college. A delightful young man. 
I then walked to a grocery store to pick up a few items, then back to my room. I spent the afternoon packing, and am getting ready to watch the super bowl. Ron will pick me up tomorrow morning promptly at 8:00 (he’s so punctual it’s amazing) to deposit me back at Hightower Gap to restart my journey. I’ll get to climb Sassafras Mountain, which is supposedly the first difficult climb. Fortunately, I spent a week on the AT last summer in the Smokies, so I have an idea of what those climbs can be like. The weather looks to be good this week, although it may rain some (of course!). 
Thanks again for all the positive comments.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582708,"After a good night’s sleep and a motel breakfast, Ron picked me up at 8:00, and we headed to Hightower Gap. We picked up another hiker on the way who was going to Springer. 
I started from Hightower Gap about 9:15, and it was cold and windy. I was tempted to put on my down jacket, but was glad I didn’t. As I started the Sassafras Mountain climb, the wind abated and I started warming up from the exercise. Sassafras wasn’t an easy climb, but it was not nearly as difficult as the mountains in the Smokies I experienced last summer with the Fat Guys, and Gals. 
I continued on, crossing some streams that required me to carefully step on rocks and not lose my balance. Parts of the time it was truly a walk in the woods. A day hiker passed me at one point, reminding me of how slow I am. But that’s ok as long as I keep moving. 
I made it to Gooch Mountain shelter just before 3:00, where I’m spending the night. I did about 7.2 miles in under 6 hours, which ain’t too bad for an old man on his first full day. Gooch is a nice shelter with a privy and nearby water. A big thanks to the association that maintains it. 
A group of about 12 hikers started showing up about 4:00. They’re on some type of training trip, it seems. Possibly Army Rangers, since they train in this area. But they’re not wearing military clothing, so I don’t know. Not very friendly, but polite when I talk to them. They obviously don’t want to interact with me, and that’s ok. 
Time to fix dinner and hit the sack. I have a long day tomorrow if I’m going to cover the 12 miles to Woods Hole shelter.","Hightower Gap
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Feb 05, Mon",7.20
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582728,"I had planned on getting started by 8:00, since I had a 12+ mile day ahead of me, however it was 8:45 before I got back on the trail. The climb out of the shelter, though not as steep or long as previous climbs, was difficult. I had to take it slow until I got warmed up. My legs seemed to be revolting: why are you doing this to me? They eventually understood. 
The top of Ramrock Mountain had some beautiful views of the valley below and peaks in the distance. It was warm enough to take off my rain jacket/windbreaker. But rain was predicted for the afternoon. 
Around noon I arrived at Woody Gap. Here the AT crosses a two-lane highway, and there’s a parking lot, bathrooms, and picnic tables. I ended up taking a 45-minute break, resting my feet and eating lunch. Several cars were in the parking lot, mainly from day hikers, I presume. 
As I crossed the parking lot and was ready to step back on the trail, I experienced my first trail magic. A young man hopped out of a car and asked if I was a thru-hiker. When I confirmed I was, he handed me a banana. That may not sound like much, but eating fresh fruit is a real treat. His trail name is Bones, and he did the AT a couple of years back. Last year he did the CDT (Continental Divide Trail). We talked a bit, and he gave me a lot of encouragement. It made climbing up to Preaching Rock a bit less of a struggle. Thanks, Bones!
Preaching Rock is a massive rock formation at the top of a mountain. It affords beautiful views of the valleys and mountains. A few day hikers were there, enjoying the weather and view. 
About 3:00, I came to Lance Creek campground, possibly the last good campground until Wood’s Hole shelter. The predicted rain still hadn’t started, but I preferred being in a shelter when it did. I had no desire to erect and break down a tent in the rain. So I made the decision to go for it and try to outrun the rain and nightfall before I made it to the shelter. For the next 2.5 hours I hoofed it, only briefly stopping for swigs of water. It was mainly uphill, but I definitely wanted to make it before sunset (6:00pm). About 5:30, I finally reached the turnoff for the shelter, only to discover the shelter is .4 mile off the trail. I arrived at the shelter about 5:45, and the rain hadn’t started. I was thankful for that. My iPhone says I did over 33,000 steps and climbed 99 floors. I used to struggle to get in 10,000 steps day. 
I was the only one at the shelter, but that was fine. After a light supper, I crawled into my bag and tried to sleep. The rain woke me in the middle of the night, and hasn’t let up since. It’s now Wednesday morning, and I’m waiting it out for a while. It looks like it will let up, then stop this afternoon. After breakfast, I’ll pack up and head out. Only 4 mikes to Neel Gap and civilization. However, the first mile is the Blood Mountain climb. Also, I’ve heard the descent can be tricky in wet conditions. I’ll go slow, and will be eating restaurant food and sleeping in a bed tonight.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Wood’s Hole Shelter,"Feb 06, Tue",12.10
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582759,"It was pouring rain when I got up. I checked the radar, and it appeared the worst of the rain would move out in a while, so I ate a light breakfast and waited in the shelter. Around 10:30, the rain let up, so I changed into my hiking gear, including rain pants and jacket, and was on the trail by 11:00. I hoped to make Neel Gap by 3:00. 
After the .4 mile hike back to the trail, I was faced with Blood Mountain, about an 800-feet climb in a mile. It was foggy and misty, and my legs once again didn’t appreciate the exercise. Occasionally, I would get hot, stopping to remove my rain jacket. Then, I’d get a blast of cold mountain air and would stop to put the jacket back on. I decided to leave it on and put up with it when I got hot rather than constantly stopping. 
It was not easy hiking. Near the top, a couple of day hikers passed me by. I finally reached the top, where there’s a stone, two-room shelter made in 1934 by the CCC. I ate a Snickers and some beef jerky, then began my descent.
Descending this side of Blood Mountain is not an easy endeavor. Large, rain-slickened rocks were par for the course. Sometimes I had to use my hands to help maneuver down the what-seemed-like vertical sheet. I had to consider every step before taking it, lest I twist an ankle or fall onto the rocks waiting below me. It definitely took me longer to go down Blood than it had taken to climb it. 
Finally, the trail flattened out for a while before I saw the highway below me to my left. A short while later, I crossed that highway and walked into Mountain Crossings, the outfitters at Neel Gap. It was about 3:30.  I picked up some food for the next leg of my journey, grabbed a coke, and got a ride to Blairsville, 14 miles away. I checked into the Season’s Motel, right on the town square, then had a long, hot shower. Aaaaah! It was fantastic!
After doing laundry (it’s so nice when the motel has a washer/dryer on site), I walked to a nearby bar/restaurant for a salad, burger, and a couple of beers. Another “thru-hiker” was in the place, and we talked a while. He’s skipping sections of the trail, and told me I should have taken an easy trail around Blood Mountain. I told him I’m walking the entire trail, with no shortcuts or yellow-blazing. I’m not judging him for what he does, since everyone is entitled to hike their own hike. But I’m planning on walking the entire AT, not sections of it. He was a gregarious fellow, though, with lots of amusing stories. I wish him the best. 
I’m taking a zero day on Thursday in Blairsville, but I’ll be back at it on Friday, restarting at Neel Gap.","Wood’s Hole Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582769,"My legs thanked me for a zero day, although we ended up walking more than 5 miles in Blairsville. But it was an easy, restful day. After a big breakfast at the “Hole in the Wall Cafe,” I walked to a gas station looking for some denatured alcohol (Heet) for my stove. No such luck, but I did pick up some candy bars for the trail. I went into a bike/outfitter shop looking for fuel, but they had none. However, I ended up talking for a good 20 minutes with the guy who works there. He told me about local history, as well as some good places to stay on the trail. He also told me about a good grocery store within walking distance, and a nearby Home Depot, which has Heet. I visited both places, picking up a few items, such as Propel powder, at the store, and fuel at HD. My friend Nate called and we talked a while. I spent a week on the AT last summer with Nate, his daughter Lexi, and 4 others. Nate’s an Army Major, and he’s hiked a lot in this area. He had some suggestions about places to visit on the trail, and was encouraging about my trek. This evening I walked to the bar for a couple of beers, then visited a pizza joint for a buffet. Back at the room, I’ve been packing and preparing for getting back on the trail. The shuttle driver will pick me up in the morning about 8:00, and I’ll be back at it.I’ll be glad when I get to the point when I’m not nervous about returning to the trail. I question whether I’ll be able to do it, even though I know I can. Eventually, it will become old hat, I suppose, but for now, I have a feeling akin to stage fright. But that feeling will disappear once I take that first step from Neel Gap tomorrow morning.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582800,"Splitter picked me up at 8:00, after a breakfast at Hole in the Wall, and I was headed out of Neel Gap by 8:30. I walked by the shoe tree, then under the infamous portico at Neel Gap, the only place the AT passes through such a man-made structure. After a series of switchbacks, it was a long, gradual ascent to Levelland Mountain, with its unbelievable vistas. It was cool, but it was quite comfortable after I got moving. It was also clear, so I got to see the views. 
I saw a few day hikers, and talked with several of them. Around noon, I stopped at the parking lot at Tesnatee Gap for a lunch break. It felt so good to air my feet out. I knew Wildcat Mountain rose out of my location, but didn’t worry about it. I erroneously thought I had made this climb last fall with Scott and Ariane from BackpackerTV. About that time, a young thru-hiker named Patrick passed me, and we began climbing. 
Switchback after switchback. Step after step. Up an up. What the hell? This isn’t what I had been expecting. I then realized that Scott, Ariane, and I must have climbed this mountain from the other side. I ended up doing a 500-foot climb in 1/2 mile, which isn’t that bad. But my mindset was that it would be so easy, so the climb was difficult. I have to learn not to assume anything, and to study my guidebook more closely. 
After reaching the top and seeing the turnoff for Whitley Gap Shelter, it was an easy descent to the parking lot where we had been last fall. 
I then began the last leg of the day, which was to make it to Low Gap Shelter. Rain was forecast for the night, so I preferred being in a shelter. Patrick agreed with me later that this section of trail, though not difficult, seemed to go on forever. Finally, about 5:00pm, I reached the shelter. 
Patrick was there, as was an experienced trail couple, Nickel and Perfect Storm. We had an enjoyable evening around a campfire, but rain was coming in. Also, I was beat after an 11.5 mile day, so I turned in fairy early. Little did I know that rain was indeed going to dominate the next couple of days.","Neel Gap

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582898,"Many years ago, Eric Clapton and Bonnie Bramlett wrote a song entitled “Let It Rain.” I like the song, but I don’t think I’ll ever listen to it in the same way again.
Even though heavy rains and flash flood warnings were in the forecast, Patrick and I decided to head out for Blue Mountain Shelter. It didn’t appear to be a particularly difficult hike, except maybe for the ascent to the shelter. Patrick left about 10:00, a few minutes before I said my farewell to Nickel and Perfect Storm, and headed out into the fog and light mist. 
I’m sure I was passing by some beautiful views along the way, but fog, sometimes quite soupy, was all I could see. It occasionally rained a bit, but I stayed dry in my rain jacket and pants. 
Around noon, the occasional rain transformed into a constant, heavy downpour. Additionally, the wind decided to do its thing, especially at the higher elevations. The trail was often nothing but large rocks that had to be carefully traversed. There was nothing to do but keep walking, one step after another, knowing that I would eventually reach the shelter. 
After inching along for a while (I had no idea how long) and assuming I had at least a mile to go before reaching the shelter, I saw a lone figure carrying an umbrella walking up the hill in front of me. Was I hallucinating? Here I am, out in the Georgia woods, stumbling around in heavy rain and fog, and Mary Poppins decides to drop in? I thought about yelling, but knew the apparition couldn’t hear me through the pounding rain and wind. I finally made it to the top, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I had reached Blue Mountain Shelter. It was 3:00pm. 
Mary Poppins turned out to be one of two local hikers who had decided to give up the luxury of home for the weekend to spend time in the wilderness. (He had gone to the water source when I spied him with the umbrella.) Some people golf. Some people do yard work. Some people hike to spend the weekend on a mountain in the rain. Who am I to judge? 
Besides the two locals, Patrick was there, as well as another thru-hiker named Miz Man. Being high on the mountainside (almost 4000 ft.), the open-sided shelter let the cold rain blow into the sleeping platform. The locals had strung up tarps to cover much of the opening, but a large gap still provided plenty of space for the rain to blow inside if it decided to do so. I changed into dry clothes and put on my down gear; everything else was wet and wouldn’t dry at night. 
We all talked a while, then I ate a freeze-dried dinner (spaghetti and meat sauce-yum!) before crawling into my bag for the night. 
What a night! The rain and wind picked up. The tarps flapped in the gale. In the middle of the night, the wind ripped the tarp halfway down. Patrick jumped up to try to repair it, but had no luck. The heavy rain blew into the shelter, soaking the outsides of our sleeping bags. Fortunately, the wetness didn’t soak all the way through. By morning, I felt like a drowned rat, and it seemed as if everything I had was soaked. Even my down pants were sopping, thanks to a leak in the shelter. With my wet bag and clothes, I knew it was time to find a place to dry out.","Low Gap Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582905,"When I finally got up, almost all my gear was soaked. The clothes I had slept in were dry, as was a pair of socks I had kept in my sleeping bag overnight. My bag was wet on the outside. When the rain started letting up, Patrick and I decided to hike to Unicoi Gap, a road crossing 2.4 miles away, to catch a ride to Hiawassee. After two calls, we contacted a shuttle service that would pick us up. We thought it would take a couple of hours to get there, since we first had to summit Blue Mountain in about a mile, then descend for a mile and a half to the road. The person on the phone (I don’t remember the name) told us not to rush it, as descending Blue Mountain is treacherous in wet conditions. She warned of lots of rocks that could be slippery. We told her we’d call when we got there, and wait the half hour for her to arrive. 
Even though it was still lightly raining and we were careful, we got there in about an hour and fifteen minutes. (Patrick, of course, was there before me. There’s no way I can keep up with a fit 20-something!) The ride showed up, and we enjoyed the warmth of the car on the 12-mile drive to town. 
On the way to town, we learned that it had indeed been a large storm. Over three inches of rain had fallen, and we saw houses with what looked like ponds in their back yards. Crossing the Hiawassee River, we noticed the water was almost to the flooding stage. No wonder we had gotten so wet. 
We went to a budget motel, but Patrick couldn’t get the heat to work in his room, so he checked out and walked to the Holiday Inn, about a mile away. I decided to stay for the night. However, when a local pizza joint refused to deliver to the motel, I made up my mind to also move to the Holiday Inn in the morning. Nothing against the place, but I’m willing to pay a bit more for comfort and amenities. At least I was warm, and my gear, spread throughout the room, was drying out. I had survived an intense night on Blue Mountain.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582913,"A year ago today, I went through the darkest day of my life. I won’t go into details, since I prefer to grieve in private, but when things get rough on the trail, I remind myself that I’ve been through worse, at least emotionally. It was a day to reminisce, remembering the good times and the times that were not so good. However, I had to continue on today, dealing with my own needs and wants, and taking care of things that needed to be done. 
I packed up my stuff this morning and checked out of the motel. The guy was nice about it, and refunded the fee I had prepaid for the second night. I then walked to the Holiday Inn and checked in. 
I love this place! I arrived in time to eat a big breakfast of biscuits and gravy, sausage, scrambled eggs, cinnamon roll, milk and OJ. And I don’t have hiker hunger yet! 
Later in the morning, I walked to a supermarket to pick up a few things. For one thing, I’ve decided to switch to cold breakfasts instead of cooking in the morning. It’ll help me get on the trail earlier in the day. 
In the afternoon, I luxuriated in the indoor heated pool and hot tub for a while. It was nice having the whole place to myself. But I didn’t overdo it; I didn’t want to wear my body out from swimming. 
Patrick and I went to dinner at a nearby all-you-can-eat buffet. It wasn’t bad, but I wasn’t very hungry. I forced myself to eat as much as I could, preparing my body for tomorrow. 
After dinner, I adjusted my pack and made a minor repair. Then it was time to relax and watch the Olympics. 
Tomorrow at 8:00, the driver will pick us up and deliver us to Unicoi Gap. My plan is to make it to Tray Mountain Shelter, while Patrick is planning to go farther. I may not see him again since he’ll be traveling faster than I, but I know he’ll make it to Maine.
Side note: I absolutely appreciate and read all comments in my guest book. I wish I could respond to them, but this app doesn’t seem to allow it. Since it would take me a long time to try to do so on this page, suffice it to say that I am humbled and thankful for everyone who has left me a message. 
A few thoughts about the trail:
Let me start by saying I am not an expert on the AT, hiking, or backpacking. I am a rank amateur who learns something new every day on the trail. So take this with a big grain of salt. These are my impressions. 
It’s said that about 25% of all people who start out as thru-hikers quit at Neel Gap, about 32 miles into the 2200-mile trek. I can see why. It’s not easy! It is not a walk in the woods. It is constantly climbing up and going down. In some sections, the trail is nothing but rocks, and each step has the potential to twist an ankle or worse. It’s taking 10 steps up a slope, then stopping for 10 seconds to catch your breath, then repeating that process for an hour. It’s taking even longer going down the other side of that mountain because you have to carefully consider every step. It’s sleeping on a hard platform in a shelter, side by side with strangers who snore, fart, and toss and turn. It’s your nose getting cold in the middle of the night, but knowing you can’t sleep with your head in your sleeping bag or you’ll wake up with a wet bag from the condensation from your breath. It’s eating crappy food, filtering water when your hands are numb from the cold, and having to eliminate waste in the woods. A lot of the time it absolutely sucks!
But there are the rewards. The days when the weather is perfect, the views are unbelievable, and the trail is actually easy for a while. The feeling of accomplishment that yes, I did make it up that mountain. The laughter and storytelling around a campfire. The days when you’re heading to town, knowing that a hot shower, cold beer, and soft, warm bed await you. 
I’m still not sure why I’m doing this. But I’m damned determined to do it. Maybe I’ll figure it out by the time I reach Katahdin. All I know is, you don’t have to be special to do this. Just hard-headed or stupid, or maybe both. 
I understand why people bail after 32 miles. It’s tempting every day. But for now, I’m on the trail. Besides, there are a few more rocks out there that I haven’t kicked with the big toe of my left foot yet. Give me time, and I’ll kick every blasted one of them!","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582934,"After my diatribe yesterday about the difficulties of the trail, today I had a breakthrough of sorts. For one thing, I knew I only had 5.7 miles to cover, even though it was up 1000 feet, then down 900 feet, then back up 1200 feet. 
However, instead of pushing, pushing, pushing, hurrying to get to the shelter, I took my time and truly enjoyed the trail. Even though it’s been a soupy fog all day, or a “shawl of fog,” as Sally the shuttle driver called it, I took notice of the beauty around me. No, there were no vistas of mountains and valleys, nor were there glorious waterfalls, but a feeling of peace and harmony surrounded me. Total quiet. No cars, sirens, or TVs yammering. Just silence. It was beautiful in its own way. Walking through the drifting fog, seeing bare trees outlined around me, hearing the occasional babbling mountain stream. I’m not saying I reached “trail nirvana,” and maybe it was just endorphins rolling through my brain, but it was relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. 
When ascending climbs, instead of looking ahead of me and thinking how much more I had to go to get to the top, I’d stop, turn around, and look, then say to myself, “Geez, look at how far up you’ve come. And you did that. You climbed those rocks and steps.”  I took several short breaks for a drink of water and to notice my surroundings. Of course, had it been raining, I might have had a different attitude. But for today, I think I truly understood the attraction of the trail. 
Also, by talking about the difficulty of the trail yesterday, I do not intend to discourage anyone from hiking the AT. Yes, it can be rough, but, as my buddy Steve Adams says, anyone can do it, assuming you have the ability to walk. So if it’s your dream, by all means, do it! 
The details: 
Patrick and I said goodbye at the trailhead. He was going farther than I was today, and as young and fit as he is, there’s no way I’ll ever catch up with him. He’s a great kid. He’s going to finish his senior year at Ohio State beginning in the fall. I know his mother reads this, so I won’t mention the hookers and beer we enjoyed last night (just kidding, Mom!). He’s a quiet, thoughtful, intelligent, and considerate young man. If all young people are like him, we have nothing to worry about in the future. Mom, you should rightfully be proud of your son. I know he’ll be on Katahdin in a few short months. 
I then began the first ascent of the day. Shortly before noon, I was strolling along, lost in my thoughts, when I got the feeling that someone was behind me. Just as I whipped around, a female voice greeted me. Even though my mind realized it was a hiker, “my body had different plans,” as John Hartford sang. I tripped, then fell flat on my back, my first fall on the trail. I’m sure she was impressed. I didn’t get her name, but she was a twenty-something with a dog. We talked briefly as she passed me by, and she said she planned on staying at Tray Mountain Shelter, my destination for the day. She also mentioned that her tent had leaked the night before, and that she had gotten wet. 
After a quick lunch of a Hardee’s cheeseburger (I like bringing food like that when leaving town), I began the final climb, before I’d descend a short distance to the shelter. Near the top, another thru-hiker caught up with me. Castle, as he’s known, was worried about the girl, since her gear was wet from the previous night. Apparently, they had stayed at the same location. He said he was going to stay at the same shelter as I was tonight. 
When I rolled into the shelter about 2:00, Castle was the only person there. The girl had apparently decided not to stop there. He was worried about her, so he also took off after we talked a bit. I hope she’s ok, but there’s nothing I can do about it. 
As a result, I apparently have the shelter to myself for the night. I may try to start a campfire in a bit, but, even though it hasn’t been raining, there’s a lot of moisture in the air. 
The fog is still hanging around, but that may mean a warmer night than a clear sky would. It’s probably in the 40s, and rain is possible for the next few days. My plan is to hike to shelters Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, then try to get to a town on Saturday and take a zero day on Sunday. Of course, those plans are subject to change, depending on the weather and on how I feel. If everything goes according to plan, I’ll leave Georgia and be in North Carolina on Friday. Whoo-Hoo! One state down, and thirteen to go.","Unicoi Gap

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582967,"This was a fairly easy, uneventful day. The hike wasn’t particularly difficult, except the final climb from Addis Gap to Kelly Knob (800 feet in one mile) seemed to get to me. It wasn’t awfully steep or rocky, so I guess I was just tired.
I might be wrong , but maybe, just maybe, my legs are getting stronger. I seemed to be able to go longer between rests on the climbs. I know I don’t have my hiker legs yet, but it is encouraging. I’m still not very fast, but I’ve never been a fast walker in the “real” world. We’ll see how I feel tomorrow. 
It’s been cloudy and foggy all day, with occasional light showers. Nothing serious. In fact, the sun had been threatening to come out off and on, but no such luck. A rather gray, gloomy day, but at least it’s not pouring rain, so I won’t complain. 
As of now, I haven’t seen another person in more than 24 hours. Someone may show up at this shelter later this afternoon or evening, but who knows. Either way is fine. The company’s great, but so is the solitude. 
Deep Gap is a nice shelter. It has two stories, and the fourth wall is actually partially covered. Also, someone was nice enough to leave some dry wood in the shelter, so I’m definitely having a fire tonight. 
I got here about 3:00, set up my bed in the shelter, then fixed a big cup of hot chocolate. What a treat! Ok, it’s the little things, right? 
One of my guest book entries is from a father in Fond du lac, WI. He and his 11-year-old son are reading “AWOL on the Appalachian Trail,” a book I recommend if you’re interested in the AT. In the book, AWOL mentions trail journals. So the father and son looked them up and found mine. Now, every night after reading AWOL, they’re reading my entry for the day. Well, there’s no way I could ever quit now! I wouldn’t want to let the boy down. A big shoutout to an 11-year-old in Wisconsin!!! I don’t know his name, but I wish him the best. 
And on that note, I’m going to start a campfire, eat some dinner, and relax.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582993,"I woke up this morning expecting to make it to Plumorchard Gap Shelter, 8.1 miles away, although I had considered stopping at Top of Georgia (TOG) Hostel, just 3.6 miles down the trail. However, my phone needed charging, and when I plugged it into my charger this morning, I found out the charger was dead. That made my decision easy: I would stop at TOG. I’m glad I did. 
TOG is a great place to stop. A clean, well-organized hostel. I got a bunk for $30, and for $5 more, they do your laundry for you. Also, at 4:00, there’s a free shuttle to Hiawassee, where they’ll pick you up at 6:30. 
It was cloudy and gloomy again in the morning. I was bemoaning that fact, when suddenly, the sun decided to appear. It was wonderful! Blue sky. Warmth. I had to stop to remove my windbreaker, and, for the first time, I hiked in a t-shirt. I was regretting stopping at TOG, but knew I had no choice. However, a couple of hours later, it clouded up again. 
I left the trail at the turnoff, then began walking down the highway to TOG. About halfway down, I ran into MizMan walking the opposite direction. He had spent the previous night at the hostel, and told me how wonderful it is. 
I checked in, got my bunk assignment, and took a hot shower. My laundry was done for me as I decompressed and talked with the other thru-hikers staying there. 
At 4:00, we took the shuttle ride to town, where I had a ribeye and a couple of beers. After a trip to the grocery store, we all rode back to the hostel. 
Tomorrow morning, I’ll catch a ride back to the trail, then I’ll have about 30 miles to go before I can get off at Franklin, TN. After that, I’ll take a day off, and resupply. I hope to make it to Franklin in four days. 
The other hikers here, including Opa, are much faster than I. They’re doing 15 or more miles a day. But that’s ok. I’ll continue to take it slow until I feel like I can put in the big miles. 
So today was a “nero” day. A near-zero day. Tomorrow I’ll get back at it: rested and resupplied. 
I’ll sign off by saying goodnight to my 11-year-old buddy in Wisconsin.","Deep Gap Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583009,"Yes! I made it to North Carolina! What a great feeling. Or so I thought...
During breakfast at TOG, Bob did a presentation on how to successfully thru-hike. One of the main points was that you should take your time and enjoy the trail. I guess some successful thru-hikers go back to do the trail again, but don’t worry about making it to Katahdin. They want to see and experience the things they missed by rushing to Maine. That point struck home with me, although I’m still determined to make it to Katahdin. And if I were physically capable, I’d probably do 15-20 miles a day. I’ll try, though, to remember to enjoy the journey, and not be so focused on the end result. 
Bob dropped us off about 8:30, and I said goodbye to Opa and the other hikers. They’re so fast, I’ll probably never see them again. It was an enjoyable morning for hiking. I even removed my outer layers and was walking in just a t-shirt for a while. The sun tried to come out, but just couldn’t make it. I could actually see the surrounding mountains the valleys below. No fog for a change. That was soon to change. 
Right after the GA/NC sign, the trail begins a long, straight, steep climb up a mountain. Just then, the weather suddenly turned brutal. High winds, heavy fog, and light rain. It was as if North Carolina said, “Oh yeah! You thought Georgia was rough. Wait until you see what I throw at you!” After several minutes of inching my way up the steep incline as the wind almost knocked me over, I stopped, threw my head back, and bellowed “I love it!” 
The only option was to keep trudging. I finally made it to the top, and the wind continued to pound. Finally a descent, then another climb almost as bad, but this one had switchbacks. Of course, the switchbacks fool you, because you think the top is around the next corner. Eventually, I reached the second peak. 
The trail then mainly stayed on the side, out of the wind, as I had to do another, less-taxing climb. Finally, I reached the shelter. It was almost dark, and I spent the night alone in a foggy, but quiet shelter. 
I’ve had a couple of questions:
Mike, your son has a great question about mice. I haven’t noticed any, although a couple of times I thought I heard them. Other people, though, said they’ve felt them crawl across them. Maybe I’m so sound asleep that I don’t notice. So far, they have not been a problem, but I’ll let you know if that changes. Thanks again for the question. 
Sawnie, you asked about when and where I write my journal. I try to write after taking care of all my chores in camp: getting and filtering water, changing into my warm camp clothes (long underwear and down jacket and pants), laying out my air mattress and sleeping bag, and getting situated. I may eat first, but usually not. I usually write in the shelter, sometimes snuggled in my sleeping bag as I am now. Thanks for asking.","Dicks Creek Gap

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583037,"I woke up to fog, mist, and drizzle. No surprise there. While I was organizing my things to get packed, a couple of other thru-hikers, Mainer and Ghost, stopped by the shelter for a short break. They said they would also be staying that night at Standing Indian Shelter. I told them I'd see them there, then finished packing after they took off.
It was a fairly easy 4.9 mile walk. However, the heavy fog persisted. The climb up to the shelter was not too difficult, but the wind started blowing. The ascent to the shelter reminded me somewhat of the previous Saturday, when I climbed in driving rain up to Blue Mountain Shelter. I was thankful it was not a rerun of that day. 
By the time I got to the shelter, the cold wind was howling into the structure. Mainer and Ghost were each stretched out in their sleeping bags, doing their best to stay warm. The direction of the open wall of the shelter was exactly wrong; it allowed the wind and mist direct access. A couple of weekend hikers were also there. They were setting up hammocks covered with a large tarp behind the building. We talked for a while, and I found out this was only their second overnight adventure in the woods. They picked a great weekend to do it, I thought sarcastically. They said the last time they did this was in January, when the wind chill was below zero. I decided this weather was an improvement over that. 
I fixed a dinner, then crawled into my bag. Even though it wasn't even dark, we all fell asleep to the howling wind and heavy fog. I stayed fairly warm overnight, but the rain poured down for a while. Thankfully, it didn't soak us, as it had done the previous Saturday.
About 4:00am, I got up to relieve myself, and noticed that not only was it not blowing and raining, but I could actually see stars. What a relief! (In more ways than one.) Maybe Sunday would be a nice day. I had no idea how nice it would be.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583059,"In the middle of the night, I noticed my phone charger was depleted. This was my fault; I hadn't adequately charged it at TOG. (I'll probably pick up a second charger, just to make sure I don't have this problem in the future.) I realized that this meant I would not be able to use my phone much the next few days, since I needed to make sure I had some juice so I could make emergency calls, if necessary. Also, I have an app called Guthook that uses GPS. If I ever get lost, I can use the app to get back on the trail. (Guthook has many other uses, such as showing how many miles to the next shelter and the like.)
One of the weekend hikers had a charger, so I borrowed it for a while to charge my phone a bit more. They needed to charge their phones also, so I thanked them for the juice, then hit the trail.
It would be impossible to describe how perfect the day was. The sun was out, and not a cloud cluttered the deep blue sky. I walked most of the day in my t-shirt, basking in the warmth. The first order of the day was to climb Standing Indian Mountain, about 700 feet in a mile and a half. Though not an especially difficult ascent, it was a good Sunday morning workout. Several switchbacks brought me to the top, where it was unusual to actually be able to see the views of mountains and valleys in the distance. 
The rest of the fairly easy walk was accented by several picture-perfect stream crossings. Each one could have been used in beer commercial. With the sun beating down, it was like being in a movie. 
I met a couple of local hikers, one of whom will start his own thru-hike in a couple of weeks. We talked for a bit, then I moved on. I remembered to take my time, stopping often to listen to the silence of the woods (no wind!), and enjoying the scenery.
When I was almost at the shelter, I was passed by Three-Mile (who is from Kansas City), Fifty-Fifty, and Clincher. They were also psyched about the day, and said they'd see me at the shelter. 
About 20 minutes after I arrived at the shelter, the fourth member of their ""tramily"" (trail family), arrived. She is a young lady known as Pee-Wee. The guys were in their 40s or 50s, and each had at least attempted a thru-hike before. Clincher has has completed at least one before. It appears they had taken Pee-Wee under their wings to help her succeed.
We all pitched tents instead of staying in the shelter, and talked a bit before turning in. Although rain was forecast for the night, nothing could ruin the absolutely perfect day. I've heard that one third of the days on the trail are bad, one third are so-so, and one third are beautiful and perfect. I definitely had used one of my perfect days.","Standing Indian Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583130,"It had rained overnight, but in the morning, we were back to fog, clouds, and mist. The hike was easy for a while; a smooth, generally flat, well-maintained trail. Only one climb separated me from a descent to the shelter.
That climb was Albert Mountain. I assumed it would be a switchback ascent of about 700 feet in approximately a mile and a half. Was I ever wrong! I'm glad I didn't know what was upcoming, or I might have been dreading it. Instead of switchbacks, the path over Albert Mountain goes almost directly up, over large boulders and a steep trail. I'd climb over one set of large rocks, only to look up and see more ahead of me. Often the white blazes marking the trail were painted on the rocks. After negotiating another set of behemoths, again, more awaited me. To get up and over some of them, I had to put my trekking poles in one hand so I could use the other hand to pull myself up. A couple of times I stared up and just laughed, telling Albert, ""Ok, buddy, bring 'em on! I'll eventually get to the top of you."" Thankfully, it wasn't raining, but the rocks were slick from the fog and mist. 
Finally, I put the last of the boulders behind me and was on top of Albert. I let out a whoop. A short distance later was the fire tower. Had it been a clear day, I would have climbed the tower for pictures. I'm sure beautiful vistas surrounded me, but fog obscured the views. Also, the tower sits roughly at the 100 mile mark of the AT. If nothing else, I can say I hiked the first 100 miles of the trail. Only about 2100 more to go! 
After I passed the tower and began my descent, I noticed a beer can a few feet off the trail. First, I kept walking, commenting to myself how crappy that was. Then, I thought to myself, ""What a jerk! Pick up the darned can!"" I turned around, walked the few feet back to it, picked it up, and carried it off the trail. I don't want to feel too smug, though, because there has been a lot of trash at some of the shelters, and I didn't make the effort to pick it all up. But at least I did my part on Albert.
The hike down to the shelter was fairly easy. Again, the trail was smooth and well-maintained. When I got to the shelter, the other four hikers were set up in the lower level. Since it was a two-story shelter, I had the upper story all to myself. We all ate, talked a bit, then went to bed. I was excited; I knew that the next night I'd be sleeping in a bed after taking a nice, long, hot shower.","Carter Gap Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583131,"Another cloudy day, although the sun broke through about mid-day. It was warm enough to hike most of the day in a t-shirt. The hike was generally easy, although there were some ascents, which slowed me down. For a while, I kept hiking near or crossing a paved highway. I wondered why the planners couldn't have just let us walk down the road instead of over mountains. Then I remembered; oh yeah, I'm hiking the Appalachian Mountains. What's the fun in walking down a blacktop?
The highlight of the hike was the long descent to Winding Stair Gap and the highway to Franklin. Just as I entered the parking lot from the trail, a vehicle pulled into the lot. It was from a local hostel, and was dropping off Mainer and Ghost so they could resume their journey. Also, PeeWee and Fifty-Fifty were getting into the vehicle. I had planned on hitching a ride into town, but instead jumped in. The other two were going to stay at the hostel, and I considered it. However, when we arrived there, I told the owner I'd prefer to stay at a motel. Nothing against hostels, but I need my privacy. A private shower and bathroom. I suppose others think I'm snobby or rude, but when I'm taking a zero day, I prefer to be alone than being in a college dorm type of atmosphere. I guess I am somewhat of a loner, and if that makes me rude, well, so be it.
The hostel owner drove me to a micro-motel, and I paid him for the ride. I'd never been in one of these, and the rooms are small. However, they are clean, and I have my own space. They also provide a computer in the lobby, which makes journaling much easier. 
After a shower, I walked to the laundromat. While my clothes were washing, I went next door to a BBQ place, where I had a beer and the brisket platter, including cole slaw and beans. I was so hungry that I ate every last morsel. It was excellent! 
After returning to my room, I walked across the parking lot to a local chain similar to Applebee's and had a coffee with peach cobbler and ice cream. I can't remember when I've eaten so much food in such a short amount of time. I don't think I have hiker hunger yet, but I was famished. 
I had a couple of beers at the chain restaurant in the evening, then back to the room. Tomorrow, I'll take care of chores, and, I hope to make it to the Lazy Hiker Brew Pub.","Long Branch Shelter

Mike and son, of course it is! Please ask all the questions you want. I may not be able to answer them all, and remember, these are my opinions and impressions, but I'll do my best. Also, I apologize for you guys not having any thing to read from me for a few days. I may not always be able to update my journal daily, or I may just be too tired to do it in the evenings, but I'll always try to get caught up when I can. Also, it's so much easier to do it on a keyboard than typing it in on my phone. The question Mike's son has is about how well the trail is marked. From what I've seen so far, the trail is marked extremely well. As you know from reading AWOL's book, the trail is marked with ""blazes,"" which are white 6-inch by 2-inch vertical stripes, usually painted on trees. Sometimes the blazes are on rocks, or even posts along highways or buildings. Generally, you will see a blaze often enough that you know you're on the trail. Sometimes, though, I've been walking for a while, and start questioning myself. I haven't seen a blaze in a while, I'll think. Did I miss a turn? Am I off the trail? It seems as if as soon as I think that, I'll notice a blaze ahead of me.Another ""oh no!"" thing that happens to me sometimes is that I'll be walking along, then question whether I accidentally started walking back south after my last stop for lunch or a drink of water. Since the blazes don't indicate direction, this has happened to hikers before. Usually I'll then notice a landmark, maybe a water crossing, that I know I haven't seen before, so I know I'm not back-tracking. I try to always tell myself ""left"" or ""right"" when I get off the trail to remember to turn that direction when I get back to it. Also, I could also use my Guthook app to confirm my direction if I'm really concerned. Sometimes you'll see two white blazes, one on top of the other. That means a turn or some other possibly confusing feature is ahead. When that happens, I've learned to stop and look until I see the next white blaze. Sometimes another trail crosses the AT, and this can be confusing. The double blazes help when that happens. Also, sometimes, the upper blaze will be offset to the left or right. That means the trail turns in that direction. At times, you'll see blue blazes. These can indicate any number of things: a path to water, shelter, or scenic view, or possibly a path that leads one around a difficult section of the trail. For example, there was a blue-blazed path around Albert Mountain if someone decides not to climb it. It rejoins the AT on the other side of the mountain. As for me, I will not blue-blaze to skip difficult sections. Others may do that, and that's their choice. Usually, a blue-blazed trail has a sign stating ""water"" or ""shelter,"" but not always. That's where AWOL's guide or Guthook can come in handy. As for makers that show how far you've gone, sometimes there are signs that state ""8.1 miles to <shelter>"" or something like that. However, usually, you'll come to a sign that says something like ""Jack's Gap,"" which will be a low section of the trail. (There was a Jack's Gap a few days ago, but it was a rainy day, so my phone was off and packed away, so I couldn't get a picture. Darn!) A lot of times, there's a water supply at these gaps, and possible some logs to sit on to eat lunch or just rest for a bit. By checking your guidebook, you can determine how far you have to go to your next stop, since the gap is marked in the book. In addition to white and blue blazes, there is an ""unofficial"" one called a ""yellow blaze."" People who yellow-blaze ride in vehicles following the yellow stripes of a highway to skip sections of the trail. It's their prerogative, but I will not yellow blaze. Of course, I'll ride vehicles when getting off the trail to go to a town, but I'll always ride back to that point and get on the trail. One more type of unofficial blaze is ""pink blazing."" That's when a guy notices a female hiking ahead of him and hikes faster to catch up with her. Or, if he sees one behind, he'll purposely slows until she catches up with him. It's actually rather humorous, and quite often, obvious. I hope this answers your question, and please feel free to ask more any time. I'll try to answer them when I can. Thanks.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583232,"I had hoped to be on the trail by 8:30 this morning, but didn’t get there until 11:30. As a result, I only covered 4.6 miles. The walk from Winding Stair Gap to Siler Bald was generally a slow, gradual climb of almost 1500 feet. My legs finally got warmed up, but it was such a beautiful day, I didn’t mind taking my time. (By the way, I understand all kinds of record high temperatures are being set in this part of the country.) It was warm, probably in the 60s or even 70s, and mostly sunny. Another perfect day. 
As the trail passes near Siler Bald, it enters what appears to be a pasture. A side trail to the left climbs to the top of the Bald, where camping is allowed. It’s a rather steep climb to the top; similar to walking up a ski slope. But the climb is more than worth it. I’m so glad I decided to make the journey, arriving about 4:00  
I was blown away by the views from the top. Finally, I was on a mountain without it being covered in fog! A local hiker from Asheville, named No Nickname, was at the top. I kept raving about the views, and I think he enjoyed listening to my excitement. It turns out he did a thru-hike in 84, before we had all this lightweight gear. He and I talked a lot, and we were treated to a beautiful sunset. 
If you’re thru-hiking, or just hiking around the area, do yourself a favor and make the climb to the top of Siler Bald, assuming the weather is good. Yes, it’s .2 mile off the trail, and it’s a steep climb, but you will be rewarded with indescribable beauty. It would be a great spot for lunch, or to hang out for a day. Be sure to bring water, though, as none is available up here. I’ve read that this is one of the most beautiful spots on the southern AT. From what I’ve seen, I would have to agree. 
Thinking back to my zero day, I enjoyed being in Franklin, NC. The town caters to hikers, and everyone I met there was friendly. Jackie at Three Eagles Outfitters not only helped me find a pair of waterproof mittens (which I may need in the Smokies), but she gave me a ride to the Lazy Hiker Brewery on the other side of town. Mandy, the bartender at the Lazy Hiker taught me about local wildflowers. The staff at Outdoor 76 spent a lot of time helping me find a new pair of shoes. (My old ones had already blown. They weren’t made for this kind of abuse.)
I’d especially like to thank Zen for his help and friendship. Even though I slept at the motel, I ended up spending time at Zen’s hostel, Gooder Grove, and regret not spending at least one night there. It’s a laid back place, and, instead of bunks, it has real beds. Zen gave me a few rides around town, and before I left, he interviewed me for a YouTube series he may start about vagabonding. Even though I didn’t spend the night at his place, I recommend it to anyone looking for reasonable rates in Franklin. 
Maybe the beautiful weather helped, but I definitely enjoyed Franklin. Betsy from Raleigh asked about water purification. Like most of the people on the trail, I use a product called a Sawyer Squeeze. It’s s lightweight tube that screws onto the top of a Smart Water bottle. After gathering the water in the bottle, you screw on the filter, turn the bottle over, and squeeze the bottle. Clean, filtered water then comes out of the other end of the filter, which you can direct into a clean water bottle. I have some type of tablets also for an emergency, but the Sawyer Squeeze does an excellent job. At least I haven’t become sick so far! And I always filter my water out here. No reason to risk unnecessary illness.","Winding Stair Gap

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583257,"It was foggy this morning on Silar, but by the time I was packed, it was clearing. I mentioned to “No Nickname,” who did a thru-hike in 84, that I should get moving. He replied, “What’s your rush? The trail’s not going anywhere.” He was right. So what if I didn’t get back on the trail exactly “on time.” He and I admired the view and talked a bit, then leisurely ambled down the hill to the trail, where we said our goodbyes. He was taking a different trail back to his car. 
I thought a lot about his comment that morning as I walked the usual ups and downs. I had been feeling guilty for going so slowly in the trail, and for taking zero days. Being a former thru-hiker, he understood that there’s no reason to rush through the experience. The fact that the weather was so nice also helped me relax and enjoy the day. 
It was so warm that I removed the lower sections of my pants legs and walked in shorts all day. Nothing remarkable about the trail, except my body still doesn’t like the ascents. I’m so slow going up. I suppose that will improve. 
Ok, I’ll open up to you all, since you’re taking the time to read this. Several years ago, I was driving to a small town in Minnesota for a conference. The drive would take me through Duluth, a place I had never visited. As I was driving north out of the Twin Cities, I popped over a hill. There, laid out before me, was the city of Duluth, with Lake Superior stretching to the horizon in the background. It was so breathtaking to me, that I actually started crying. I’m not sure why it made me so emotional, but it did. I had a similar experience today when, at about 3:00, I finally reached the top of Wayah Bald. The unobstructed view of the surrounding mountains bowled me over. The sun was out, with clouds floating in the sky. Franklin lay in the valley below. I took many pictures, but, of course, they don’t do justice. I spent at least a half hour up there, climbing the observation tower, and admiring the scenery. I’m glad I took the time instead of blowing past it. By the way, this Bald is accessible by car and a short walk. If you’re in the Franklin area, you should think about checking it out sometime. 
I then walked the mile to the Wayah Bald Shelter, where I’m spending the night. Lotus, whom I briefly met in the trail today is here, as are a couple of section hikers who are tenting behind the shelter. I had a good talk with Lotus, had a healthy dinner, which included fresh spinach, and will hit the sack soon. I hope to make it to Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) early Sunday afternoon to resupply and relax, before heading out to Fontana on Monday. With any luck, I should be in the Smokies in about a week. 
Dave from Bessemer, AL, yes, I definitely remember punch cards! My first program was in Fortran-I think it took 7 cards. 
Ken from Bayfield, CO, actually my pack weight has crept up to a bit over 25 pounds with food and water. I’ve also added a couple of winter items, such as waterproof mittens. 
I hope I haven’t missed any other recent questions. If I have, please ask again, and I’ll do my best to answer them.","Siler Bald

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583331,"Although it had rained a bit overnight, the weather was once again generally agreeable. The trail was the normal ups and downs until the climb to Wesser Bald late in the day. 
I was fortunate to meet three saints today. I thought about calling them heroes, but that word gets bandied about a lot these days. Anyway, three volunteers were out working that day, clearing the trail of brush and blown-down trees. (Hurricane Irma did a lot of damage last year to the woods around this part of the country.) If it weren’t for people like these guys, the AT simply would not exist. They aren’t paid, at least not monetarily. They are out there, in their own free time, busting their butts to make the trail available for anyone who desires to use it. They are saints. 
I also was affected by angels: trail angels. At Tellico Gap, which is a road crossing, trail angels had left a five-gallon bucket full of packages of potato chips, Doritos, and the like, and sitting next to it was a styrofoam cooler full of ice, sodas, and Snickers bars. Wonderful! I guzzled a cola, downed a bag of chips, and grabbed a Snickers for dessert later. It’s amazing how much this type of thing lifts the spirit. 
With a sugar rush, I began the long ascent to Wesser Bald. It was quite an uphill, and when I reached the top, an optional climb up the observation tower awaited. I slowly ascended the steps, and was once again blown away by the view. Several people were up there, admiring the scenery, since this tower is accessible by car. 
After the tower, I headed down to the shelter. It ended up being a full house as a group of four hikers joined Lotus and me in the shelter. It’s the first time I’ve had to sleep crammed together with others, but I actually got a few hours of sleep. It rained overnight, and I wondered if the walk to NOC the next day would be a wet one.","Wayah Bald Shelter 
",Wesser Bald Shelter ,"Feb 24, Sat",10.60
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583351,"It rained again overnight, and was still dreary in the morning, so I didn’t rush getting back on the trail. Once again, I was the last person to leave the shelter. One thing I need to work on is becoming more efficient in the morning so it doesn’t take me do darned long to get ready. At any rate, by the time I was walking, the rain had essentially stopped, and it was a dry 6-mile walk down to the NOC. It was cloudy, but at least no fog obscured the views. 
I had planned to spend a half-day at NOC, taking a shower, doing laundry, eating a hot meal, etc., then heading out on Monday morning after getting a good night’s rest in a real bed. I would then take a zero day at Fontana in about three days. However, my legs were bothering me, especially on the uphills, and the climb out of NOC is basically up for about five miles. Lotus, who’s in his early 60s and is in much better shape than I, had planned a zero at NOC, and after talking with him, I was convinced I should also do that. And I’m glad I did. I think my body needed the rest, and the weather forecast called for rain on Monday, but sunny skies on Tuesday. 
With that though in mind, I leisurely (if there is such a thing on the AT) walked down the six miles to the NOC, which is a complex dedicated to outdoor activities such as kayaking, arriving there about 12:30. The AT actually passes through the complex of several buildings, most of which are closed this time of year. The outfitters, the restaurant, and lodges are open, and I got a private room at one of the lodges where Lotus was also staying. It’s a building with about 10 rooms and a common area with a full kitchen, and it has a free washer/dryer. It turned out that Lotus and I are the only two people staying here, so it’s nice and quiet. Very relaxing. 
After showering, I met Lotus for a late lunch at the restaurant. I also had a couple of beers along with a BIG salad (you Seinfeld fans know what I mean) and a burger. Then back to the lodge to do laundry and to lounge around all evening. It’s so nice to just take it easy for a while. I talked to my wonderful sister on the phone, and my friend Nate, an experienced backpacker, called to give me words of encouragement. 
On Monday, I’ll visit the outfitters, eat some good food, and get ready for the hike out on Tuesday. With any luck, I’ll be in the Smokies in a few short days, hoping the weather holds until I’m out of them. It will definitely be an adventure, but, hey, that’s why I’m here. 
In Monday’s post, I’ll answer questions and fill you in on my previous experience at NOC with a great group of people called “Fat Guys, and Gals, Back in the Woods.”","Wesser Bald Shelter 
",NOC,"Feb 25, Sun",5.90
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583361,"On the morning of July 2, 2017, I drove to the Nantahala Outdoor Center near Bryson City, North Carolina, where I met up with six heretofore strangers. Yes, I had met a couple of them online and had talked on the phone, but this was my first face-to-face meeting with the “Fat Guys, and Gals, Back in the Woods.” Notice that “and Gals” is delineated by commas to indicate the Gals were definitely not fat. As for the guys, well maybe some of us were just a tad overweight. 
The crew consisted of Skeezix, Mighty Blue, Sherpa, Skates, Turd, Golden, and yours truly. The first three in the list had completed thru-hikes in the past. I was joining the group because I had become acquainted with Mighty Blue through his podcast, “Mighty Blue on the Appalachian Trail,” which is definitely worth checking out if you’re interested in the AT. A driver shuttled us that morning to Newfound Gap in the Smokies, and we began our six-day hike south. We would finish at NOC the following Saturday. 
This was my first exposure to actually hiking part of the AT, and it was definitely an eye-opener. It showed me just how difficult the trail can be, and it also allowed me to experience the camaraderie of life out there. In a relatively short amount of time, I had become life-long friends with the people in the group. I also learned a lot about surviving the AT from the experienced hikers.
As I was driving back to the KC area after that trip, I really had to question whether I wanted to tackle a thru-hike, since now I had a taste of how truly difficult it can be. I pondered that question for months, as I went about selling my house and planning my future as a retired, unattached vagabond. Finally I decided that if I didn’t take on the quest now, I never would, and l knew that I would regret not at least trying. With that in mind, I announced to the world of my plans, and, surprisingly, nobody asked, “Are you out of your mind?” In fact, most people were quite supportive, even though I imagine some were questioning my sanity. Nobody was more supportive than the Fat Guys, especially Skeezix, Turd, and Mighty Blue. I don’t know if I’d still be on the trail if not for their encouragement. 
Yesterday, it was interesting to walk into NOC from the south. Tomorrow morning, I’ll head north, retracing in reverse the trip we took last summer. I’ll make the long ascent out of this valley to Sassafras Shelter, and maybe beyond. I hope to make it to Fontana by Thursday. After that, the Smokies await, with the brutal climbs, beautiful views, and unpredictable weather. It’s said that after you finish the Smokies, you finally have your trail legs. I sure hope so. 
I’m glad I took a zero at NOC today. I’ve rested a lot, and my legs really needed it. I’ve eaten a lot, and will have a big dinner tonight followed by a good sleep in a comfortable bed. Tomorrow morning, bright and early, I’ll be back at it. 
Questions:
Laura from Savanna asked about food storage and bears. Laura, my best advice is to follow the rules, recommendations, and regulations of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), the National Forest Service, and whatever agency happens to be in charge of the section of trail you’re on. I have yet to see anyone carrying a bear canister, and yes, some shelters, especially in Georgia had big boxes to store your food bags in overnight. Other shelters have cables for hanging bags, and at other shelters you have to hang your own bag. Again, check the ATC site for details about hanging your bag. 
Winkle from Blairsville asked about my pack. Winkle, I use a ZPacks Arc Blast, which weighs under a pound and a half. I like it. 
My old buddy Matthew from Olathe, KS asked about places I look forward to seeing on the trail. First off, Mt. Katahdin makes the list, because that means I’ve made it. However, I know that will be a bittersweet moment. McAfee Knob is an iconic spot on the trail that will be cool. Hot Springs, NC, Damascus, VA, and Harper’s Ferry, WV are all places I’ll enjoy seeing. But the best places are the unexpected sites along the trail. I like being surprised by views, towns, and experiences I had no idea were coming. Sometimes ignorance can lead to delightful results, whereas over-hyped expectations can be disappointing. By the way, Matthew, it’ll be great to see you later this year, talking over our experiences while eating a couple of Chicago dogs.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583402,"The ascent out of the NOC was every bit as difficult as I expected, if not more so. It’s an approximate 3000-feet climb over seven miles, mainly up, with a few downs thrown in to give you a small break. At least the weather was about as close to perfect as it can get: clear skies and fairly warm, especially for this time of year. 
I stopped at Sassafras Gap Shelter for the night. Yes, it was only about seven miles, but my plan is to do a longer day tomorrow, possibly all the way to Cable Gap Shelter, about 15 miles. It’s supposed to rain for the next couple of days, so I may as well walk. Also, that will give me a short day on Thursday to hike into Fontana, where I’ll prepare for the Smokies. The weather looks descent for the next few days (other than rain the next two days), so maybe I’ll luck out and get through the Smokies without any major issues. But I know the weather can change quickly there, so I’ll be prepared. 
As for putting in more miles, I’m trying not to rush it, but will try to push myself a little harder. It was slow today going up, but my legs and feet feel great now. The new shoes are working out, and I still haven’t had a blister (knock on wood). I know the Smokies will be difficult, but ten or twelve miles a day should be feasible. Another thing I’ve considered is that, should I realize I can’t make it to Katahdin before they close the park in October, I’ll do a flip-flop. I’ll get off the trail, travel to Katahdin, then head south until I meet up with my jumping-off point. That officially counts as a thru-hike, as long as it’s completed within a calendar year. However, if I can start averaging 12 to 15 miles a day, I shouldn’t have to flip-flop, even if I take a zero day every week. But I won’t push my body too hard until I’m sure it’s ready for it. I do not want to risk injury by being foolish. 
I neglected to mention an interesting and unique couple I met last weekend. Scout and Clover are a married couple in their 30s who live in southeastern North Carolina. Last year they decided to hike the entire AT a section at a time. They are planning on doing about 100 miles a year, mostly in short stretches of three to five day hikes. They plan on taking at least 20 years to complete the journey. Now that’s dedication! They are also extremely nice people, and offered to run us thru-hikers to town on Monday before they headed home. I wish them the best. Check them out on the internet at outdoorblaze. 
It’s time to fix some dinner and turn in. It looks like I may have this shelter to myself for the night.","NOC
",Sassafras Gap Shelter ,"Feb 27, Tue",6.70
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583461,"I had every intention of walking the approximately 15 miles to Cable Gap Shelter when I woke up this morning. Sure, it had rained overnight, and it was still lightly raining, but I had hiked in the rain before. Yes, it was a tad on the cold side, probably in the low-30s, but the cold had never stopped me before. The profile of the trail looked to be the normal up and downs, so 15 miles was doable. Or so I thought.
Before I had gone to bed, Chowdown showed up at the shelter, and he was also planning on the hike to Cable Gap on the following day. A while later, a thru-hiker I hadn't met also appeared. His name was Okie, and, you guessed it, he's from Oklahoma. We settled in fairly early to clear skies, but, as I noted earlier, rain did come down in the early morning hours. 
I knew it would be a long day, but didn't get a very early start. No problem, I thought. I'll just end up getting there about dark. Chowdown and I left about the same time, and he soon passed me up and was out of sight. The trail was more difficult than I had thought it would be (I should know that by now!), and the rain continued. I wore my rain gear, and even pulled out my ""waterproof"" mittens with liners that I had purchased for the Smokies. It was a bit cold, and I was getting wet, but I thought it would be ok.
By late morning, I had changed my tune. I was soaked, and the cold had crept into my body. My hands and feet were becoming numb, and everything I was wearing was soaked through. I imagine the temperature was still in the 30s. I finally realized that I would have to get off the trail at Stecoah Gap, as there was no way I could continue like this. It wasn't even noon, and I was chilled to the core. How could I walk another 5 or 6 hours, then try to sleep in a cold, damp shelter. I am wary of hypothermia, and realized that it was a real possibility if I kept going. 
About that time, Okie caught up with me. The first thing I said was, ""I have to get off this trail."" He agreed. I wasn't shivering yet, but I knew I would be before long. My hands and feet were wet and numb. I checked the Guthook app, and found out a guy named Lonnie could pick us up at Stecoah Gap, where the trail crosses a road, and shuttle us to his hostel, the Stecoah Wolf Creek Hostel. I called him, and he agreed to meet us. We still had a mile and a half to go, and it seemed to take forever to get to the road. When we did, I called Lonnie again, and he was there in five minutes to pick us up.
The Wolf Creek Hostel is a great place to stay. For $25 a night, we get our own bed (not a cot) with sheets and pillows, use of a washer/dryer, a full kitchen, TV, etc. I jumped in the shower as soon as I could to get warmed back up, and it felt wonderful. Later in the afternoon, Okie and I did laundry, and each ate three hotdogs that Lonnie had told us were in the refrigerator. 
Last year, the Fat Guys group stopped at Stecoah, although we stayed at a different hostel. It was a good place, but this one is closer to town, and Lonnie shuttles us whenever we want. So, about 5:00, he showed up to drive us to the Stecoah Diner, a place we Fat Guys visited last summer. It's one of my favorite all-time restaurants. I had chicken and dumplings, mashed potatoes, green beans, and Texas toast. I ate every last bite, and followed it up with coconut cream pie. I actually felt full! (By the way, I've lost 13 pounds so far on this adventure.) I also talked with Dannie, who owns the diner with his wife, and he was as entertaining as he was last summer when I was there. If you're ever in Stecoah, NC, be sure the eat at the diner.
It appears the weather will be cold and rainy again tomorrow, so I think I'll hang out at the hostel until Friday, when the weather will improve. That should put me in Fontana by Saturday afternoon or evening, and I'll start the Smokies on Sunday or Monday, depending upon the weather. In a way, I feel like a wuss for jumping off the trail today, but I was starting to get concerned. I can deal with rain, and I can deal with cold, but if you put the two together, that's another story. There's no reason to imperil my journey because of hard-headedness, so I'll wait another day until the weather decides to cooperate. I hate taking another zero, but having experienced what I did today, I think it's the wise thing to do.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583500,"It's been a lazy day at the hostel. After a big breakfast at the nearby cafe, Okie and I have been talking a lot about our experiences and, of course, about the trail. I inventoried my food bag, and bought a few items at the c-store attached to the restaurant to make sure I have enough food to make it to Fontana. I don't have hiker hunger yet, but I am able to eat more than I do in ""normal"" life. I also eat a couple of candy bars on the trail each day, which is completely out of the ordinary for me. As Steve Adams says, it's guilt-free eating out here.
Speaking of Steve, he did a short interview with me this morning, which may be included in the next episode of ""Mighty Blue on the Appalachian Trail."" We talked a bit about my decision to get off the trail yesterday, and he agreed that I was smart to get off the trail when I did. He's always encouraging, reminding me of how lucky I am to be able to be out here on this journey. His podcast is entertaining and informative, so give him a listen if you're interested in the AT or backpacking in general. 
It sounds as if a lot of hikers got off the trail or hunkered down the last day or so. It was a cold, relentless rain, but it has finally let up this afternoon. Tomorrow is supposed to be sunny, but windy. I should be fine in my dry cold-weather gear, including mittens and balaclava. Okie and I plan on making it to Cable Gap Shelter, about nine miles, then on Saturday walk to Fontana, another five miles or so. Assuming the weather isn't horrible, my plan is to head into the Smokies on Sunday. It appears it may be a bit cold next week, with some light snow possible, but it should be ok. I may get a ride into Gatlinburg for a nero day about mid-week, then finish up the Smokies later next week. It'll be good to get a few days under my belt and to make it through that week.
I again want to sing the praises for the Wolf Creek Hostel. Lonnie is a great host, and the place is clean and comfortable for a decent price. If you're passing through here, it's a good place for a nero or zero, and it's convenient to have a restaurant and store so close. 
Jimmy in TN, thanks for the story about your wife, who at age 62 entered the Smokies on April 1 and summited in late September. That gives me hope that I can pick up the pace and succeed as she did.
Mike and son in WI, thanks again for your interest. I'm glad your son is still enjoying the journey.
Ellie in CA, good luck on your journey, which starts in about a month. I have Outdoor Research rain jacket and pants, and usually they're fine. In fact, I use the jacket often as a windbreaker, even when it's not raining. Yesterday, though, I somehow got wet even through the rain gear, and the cold infiltrated my clothing. As I said, I've walked in rain a lot without problems, but yesterday was different. The cold usually isn't a problem; in fact, last December I spent three days on the Ozark Trail in Missouri in 20 degree weather without problems, but it was dry. Once you get moving, it's amazing how much your body warms up so you don't need a lot of heavy layers while hiking. I look forward to reading your journal (assuming you keep one) when you being your trek.
Chris in MN, I haven't heard of the Superior Hiking Trail, but I'm sure it's beautiful. I haven't spent much time up there, but would like to explore it more--just not in the winter!
John in MO, yes, I know where Pleasant Hill is. I used to live in Cass County myself, albeit a few miles west of you. (I think Pleasant Hill is in Cass County.) I'm glad you and your daughter enjoy my journal, and I hope that someday you also have the chance to enjoy the experience of a lifetime.
Thanks to everyone else for your encouraging comments. They are appreciated even if I don't have the time to respond to each one individually. Also, thanks to Sherpa, one of the Fat Guys, for his kind words. I hope I see him in Maine in September. 
Okie and I are heading next door to enjoy a leisurely dinner, then tomorrow we're back at it. I hope I can get back into a hiking rhythm and start piling up the miles. But I'll be sure to enjoy the journey along the way.","

Okie and I headed out of Stecoah Gap on Friday morning, headed for Cable Gap Shelter. It was a tad cold and breezy, but the rain was gone, and the sky was unobscured by clouds. The climb out was long, but not brutal. Okie climbs much faster than I, so I was soon hiking alone. 
The winds came and went, depending upon which side of the ridge line the trail went. About noon, I came upon two large rocks in a non-windy area, so I took a long lunch. 
I reached the shelter about 3:00, and Okie was waiting there. We had a few hours before dinner, so we had a cup of coffee and talked for a while. After dinner, we started a small campfire to take the chill off the evening. 
After dark, a hiker approached from the north. It turned out to be Daddy Longlegs, a seasoned section hiker. He’s retiring next year, and will probably do a thru-hike. He had a lot of interesting information about the trail and hiking in general.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583573,"It was another beautiful day as Okie and I walked down to Fontana Village, which is a resort area developed by Fontana Lake. The TVA built the dam in the 40s, and the area is used by nature lovers. 
When we got to the marina, we called a shuttle to take us into the village, where we ate burgers at the restaurant, then resupplied at the gas station. (The general store isn’t open this early in the season.) we then caught the shuttle back to the marina and walked to the Fontana Shelter, known as the Fontana Hilton. It’s one of the nicest shelters on the trail, as it has a heated bathroom with showers nearby and solar phone chargers. I had planned on getting a room at the Fontana Inn, but Okie said he wanted to experience the AT by staying at the Hilton, and I thought, you  know, he’s right. So the Hilton it would be. 
We walked into the shelter, and sitting there was Chowdown, whom we hadn’t seen since Sassafras Shelter. He had also jumped off the trail on that rainy Wednesday, but had stayed at a different hostel. He had hiked on Thursday in the rain, but had taken a zero at Fontana. Later all of us went to the restaurant again for dinner, then back to the shelter for a good night’s sleep. The next day would be a long day as we would enter the Smokies, and the next week could be trying, depending upon the weather.","Cable Gap Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583700,"Last summer with the Fat Guys, I hiked into Mollie’s Ridge Shelter from the north, and it was a bear (I could use another b-word, but I’ll refrain). On Sunday, I tackled Mollie’s Ridge from the south, and it was even more difficult. The climb out of Fontana is about a 3000-feet ascent over about 11 miles, and, of course, there are rises and descents along the way. It seemed as if I was walking uphill all day. At least it was mainly sunny, a nice day for a walk. 
I met Camo, Okie’s friend along the way. Camo lives in the area and had taken a few days off before joining us. It turns out that he and I hike about the same rate, especially on the ups. I caught up with Okie and Camo about noon at Shuckstack Fire Tower, as they were finishing lunch. They took off, and I enjoyed lunch in the sunshine near the tower. After eating, I climbed the tower, which was an experience. I’m not especially afraid of heights, but it was a bit on the scary side. I told myself I’d probably never be there again, so forced myself up the stairs. The views from the top were impressive, but I didn’t hang around long. 
I got into the shelter in time to do my chores and eat, and after a long day, I was ready for bed. The shelter was fairly crowded with thru-hikers as well as section-hikers. It seems some college students section hike the AT instead of heading for the beaches during spring break. You have to hand it to them for doing something out of the ordinary. At any rate, I was tired enough to sleep well, even with all the other hikers in the shelter.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583701,"It was a typical up and down day, but the ups seemed particularly brutal. I ended up walking with Camo a lot, since he and I seem to ascend at about the same pace: slowly, one six-inch step at a time on the steep climbs. It was overcast most of the day, but at least no rain or snow fell. 
The climb up to Rocky Top was rather difficult, but the views were fantastic. I believe this is the Rocky Top, Tennessee that the old song is about. A few other day hikers were up there, just making an excursion to the top for the experience of it. 
Less than a mile from Rocky Top was another even higher mountain called Thunderhead. After that, it was the normal ups and downs until we rolled into Derrick Knob Shelter. Again, it was fairly crowded with thru and section hikers, but still plenty of room. I’m beginning to miss the days of having a shelter by myself or sharing it with only one or two others. Oh well, that’s part of the AT experience. 
The next day would be a shorter day, and I was thankful for that as I drifted off to sleep.","Mollie’s Ridge Shelter

Okie, Camo, and I walked together a lot. I also walked with Lucky 59 and Pepper Pot, a couple that I think are also doing a thru-hike. They had been in the shelters the past two nights, and were a joy being around. 
We stopped at Silers Bald Shelter for lunch, even though it was only another mile and a half to Double Spring Gap Shelter, our destination for the day. We took our time, since we were almost done walking, enjoying the luxury of not rushing. 
We arrived at Double Spring shortly before 2:00pm. After considering pushing on, we decided to take the afternoon off and enjoy the day at the shelter. The sun came out, and we relaxed in the warmth in  the grassy area outside the shelter. Several other hikers also showed up, and everyone seemed to be in a great mood, enjoying the bright sunshine. Lucky 59 and Pepper Pot decided to keep moving, so I don’t know if I’ll see them again. I talked a lot with a couple from Knoxville, out for the week. A young hiker rolled in and pitched his tent in the field in front of the shelter. We’d get to know him well over the next couple of days. 
After dark, a large group of hikers showed up, but they all pitched tents instead of coming into the shelter. I could hear them fixing dinner outside, and I was glad they didn’t try to cram into the shelter to sleep. 
The forecast had called for a possibility of snow, but when I got up in the middle of the night to relieve myself, I noticed the sky was clear. Maybe the forecast was wrong, I thought to myself. In the morning, I’d find out how wrong I was.","
",Double Spring Gap Shelter ,"Mar 06, Tue",7.40
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583838,"I’m learning more and more to trust the trail, and yes, the trail does provide. Today was a perfect example of both of those sayings. 
In the middle of the night, I had thought the weather forecast was wrong, but when I woke up, I found out how wrong I was. A blanket of about five inches of snow covered everything. It was beautiful, but cold. Okie, Camo, and I bundled up, and headed out, with Okie breaking trail for us. I noticed the trees had changed from mainly deciduous trees, as had been common in Georgia and the first part of Carolina, to predominantly evergreens. The snow on the green boughs made it seem like a winter wonderland. It was so cold my water bottle froze, but I was warm as long as I kept moving. The wind was sometimes brutal, but most of the walking was deep in the forest, so it was usually calm. It was an unexpected joy to hike in the the conditions, with the only sounds being the occasional wind and our boots crunching the snow. 
Before leaving the shelter, I had left a message for a shuttle driver to pick us up at Newfound Gap at the only road crossing in the Smokies. We would then go to Gatlinburg, about 15 miles down the mountain, for a motel room. I was dreaming of a hot shower and food all afternoon. It would be a great finish to a fun day in the woods. Or so I thought. 
We arrived at a parking lot of some sort about two miles from Newfound Gap. Just as we did, Cameron, the young man we had met at the shelter the day before, appeared. He had taken a side trail from the shelter and had caught up with us there. In fact, he had arrived just as we had. I then checked my phone, and had a message from the shuttle driver that the road to Newfound Gap was closed due to the snow, and would probably be closed the next day also. The wind was howling and cold, so I called the driver. He gave us some options, but it looked like we were stuck in the cold for the night, with temperatures expected to drop into the single digits. We considered our options and decided to hike the 1.8 miles to Newfound. On the way there, I thought that maybe we could pitch tents at Newfound Gap, then walk down to Gatlinburg the next day. 
This is where trusting the trail comes into play. We got to Newfound Gap, and, as I had been hoping, a public bathroom was there. We all let out a yell for joy when Okie tested the door, and it was unlocked. He yelled back to us, “It’s heated, too!”  We had found our shelter for the night, and, as far as I’m concerned, it’s the best darned shelter on the AT. We were almost ecstatic as we went into the warmth, and the facilities were operational. 
We fixed dinners on the shelf, talking about our options for the next day, which included walking down to Gatlinburg. We also gave Cameron a lot of advice, since he was new at this. His pack was way too heavy, and he wore blue jeans, which are not a good choice for hiking. He’s a college student from Michigan, and had driven down to hike part of the Smokies on Spring break. I’ll hand it to him for doing something instead of just talking about it. I let him use my phone to call his mom, since his phone battery was dead. He’s a good kid, and he has a lot more adventures ahead of him. 
We put down our bedrolls, and I finally went to sleep. I never thought I’d sleep by a row of urinals, but it was one of the best nights of sleep I’ve ever had.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584053,"We woke up dry and warm in the bathroom. I still couldn’t believe our luck. We melted snow to make breakfast and coffee, since the only water available was in the toilet, and none of us were going to use that. We considered our options, which included walking the 15 miles down the road to Gatlinburg. Also, there was the possibility the road would open later in the day. 
Then we heard road maintenance trucks in the parking lot. Cameron and Camo talked with them, and they said they’d contact someone to help us out. So we hung out and talked a while. 
Shortly before noon, two park ranger SUVs showed up. We hurriedly gathered our packs and practically ran to them. As we rode down the hill, we made sure we weren’t going to make the local news. We could see the headline: “Four Dumb Hikers Rescued from Newfound Gap.” The ranger assured us that that would not happen. He said the road was getting ready to open, but new snow had changed the plans and it wouldn’t open until the next day. Near the bottom of the hill, Cameron got out to find his car and make the drive back to Michigan. (He made it safely, by the way.) The rest of us were then delivered to a motel, where we were effusive in our thanks to the rangers. Those guys definitely earned my respect. 
The motel wouldn’t let us sign in until 2:00, so we went next door to a pizza buffet for a wonderful lunch. I don’t know how many pieces I ate, but I was full by the time we left. 
We then walked across the street to NOC to pick up a few supplies, then to the grocery store for more trail food, including a lot of candy bars for me. I swear I’ll never run out of candy bars again. In real life, I probably have two or three candy bars a year, not counting Halloween. On the trail, I’ll eat four or five a day if I have them available. I need the calories. And they taste so good!
At NOC, we ran into Walkabout, whom I had briefly met at Fontana. He joined up with us. We then went back to the motel, where Okie and Camo shared a room, as did Walkabout and I. 
The other three took a trolley to a larger grocery store than was nearby. I went to the room to organize my gear and watch MU lose a game they should have won. But we won’t talk about that.
The guys returned, and I decided to walk across the street to eat dinner at a steakhouse. Nobody wanted to join me, but I am somewhat of a loner, so I enjoyed a salad bar, beef tenderloin, and large baked potato, along with two local scotch ales. It was fantastic! When I got my bill, I noticed it was less than it should have been. The waitress smiled and said. “I bought you one of the beers.” She thru-hiked a couple of years ago, and has a soft spot for thru-hikers. We talked about the trail for a while, and I left her a nice tip. The people you meet on the trail are amazing. 
I returned to the room and soon was dozing off, wondering what adventure I’d face the next day.","Newfound Gap

It was sunny and warm in town, and we enjoyed the fresh air and sunshine as we waited for the shuttle. The driver was supposed to pick us up around noon, but by the time he dropped us off at Newfound Gap, it was around 2:00pm. I was amazed at the parking lot; it was full of cars. Since it was a fairly nice day, many day hikers were enjoying the trail near Newfound Gap. However, the warmth of the valley soon disappeared as we got out of the vehicle and put on our packs. A cold, blustery wind reminded us that we were back at elevation. As we hit the trail, though, we went along the side of the mountain out of the wind, so it was comfortable. We met many day hikers on our short three-mile walk to Icewater Spring Shelter. 
We arrived in time to relax a bit before fixing dinner and hitting the sack. It was cold, but not unbearable. The next day would be a longer day, and rain was predicted. I was hoping the rain would hold off as I drifted off to sleep.","Newfound Gap

That's probably why so many day hikers had been out the previous day. However, it was blowing snow and foggy, so we bypassed the short walk to the landmark. We would not have been able to have seen any scenery, so we thought best to keep pushing on.
We walked on snow and ice all day, and the climb after lunch seemed particularly difficult. We finally made it to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter, probably the best shelter (other than the bathroom) that I've experienced on the trail. The water source was nearby, and it had a nice privy. Also, it was not crowded that night, as only Okie, Camo, and I were there, plus Chowdown was sitting there when we arrived. I've really come to dislike crowded shelters, and in the Smokie Mountain National Park, you're required to stay in shelters instead of tenting.

It made for a rather miserable day of hiking. As long as I kept moving, my feet stayed warm, but it was not pleasant when we stopped at the shelter. 
I have three pairs of socks, and I sleep with them in my sleeping bag to help dry them out. However, it's become normal to put on damp socks in the morning and stick my feet into cold, wet shoes to begin the hiking day.

We started the day at about 4800 feet elevation, and would end at around 1750 feet. So, one would think a downhill walk would be in store. But, no! That's not the way the AT works. First we went down to about 4200 feet, then climbed up to almost 5000 feet, then finally began our descent out of the Smokies. I was almost ecstatic as we walked out the park, looking back at the signs the southbound hikers see as the enter it. A roadway passes by this point at Davenport Gap, and lucky for us, Tina the Trail Angel, was waiting there with sodas, fruit, cakes, candy, chips, and other assorted junk food to treat us and any other hikers that passed through. It made the experience even more wonderful.
As we were stuffing our faces and talking with Tina, a stiff, cold wind kicked up, so we said our good-byes and head on up the trail. The destination was Standing Bear Hostel, a place we cold stay for the night and pick up a few supplies. It was only a few miles, but the wind started howling and the snow falling. The wind was so strong the snow was blowing horizontally at times, getting behind my glasses and hitting my eyeballs. As we walked under I-40, it was almost like being in a blizzard. 
We finally made our way up the hill to the hostel, and by then, the snow had pretty much stopped. We met Hawk, who runs the hostel, and he showed us the ropes. We each grabbed a bunk in the bunkhouse, which probably holds 20 bunks, A roaring fire in a wood-burning stove was being tended by a hiker named Reboot, and the heat felt absolutely divine. We pulled out our wet clothes and hung them up to dry as best we could, and I set my shoes close to the stove to help dry them out. 
Unfortunately, Standing Bear does not have a washing machine (you have to use a washboard), and the dryer was broken, so I was not able to do laundry nor get my clothes properly dried out. Also, I guess the shower had problems, so I didn't even try to get one in. But it was a great place to relax, get warm, and eat food in the kitchen that was provided. The place was almost full of thru and section-hikers, so we had lots of good conversations. Also, Chowdown bought some beers, and he forced me to drink three of them. 
It was extremely hot in the bunkhouse that night. In fact, some people had to leave for a while to cool off. Also, a cat was in the bunkhouse for a while, but decided to leave when it got the chance because of the heat. Finally, the fire dwindled a bit, and I had a good night's sleep on the bunk.","Cosby Knob Shelter

I hadn't eaten very much for breakfast, as I've always had a hard time eating much until I'm up for a couple of hours. But my legs felt strong, and I thought I'd be fine.
A four-mile uphill faced us as we left the hostel. I was doing great for the first two miles. I thought maybe I had finally developed my trail legs. All of a sudden, though, I hit a wall. My legs didn't want to continue. The final two miles up were extremely difficult, but I kept pushing on and finally made it to the top. At least the weather, though cold, was cooperating, and the sun was shining, which made the snow on the ground and trees quite pretty. 
The reward for the climb was to reach the top of Snowbird Mountain. It's a bald with a 360-degree view, and it was absolutely stunning. The surrounding trees were white with snow, and the sun was bright. It would have been a nice place to eat lunch on a warm Spring day, but I took some pictures and moved on. 
We stopped at Groundhog Creek Shelter, and it was an old, small shelter. The sleeping platform sagged, so that people sleeping on the outside (I, for one), tended to slide towards the middle. Also, other hikers showed up, so the shelter was packed. By the time Chowhound showed up, it was so full he had to pitch a tent in the snow. It was not a good night's sleep.
I forgot to mention that we met a woman named Packer at Standing Bear. She's from Germany, and is over here for six months to complete her hike. She joined up with us and has been hiking with us. She sleeps in a hammock, which is becoming more popular, so she didn't have to suffer the shelter that night. It's been interesting talking with her about her home and family.","Standing Bear Hostel

In the evenings and mornings, my extremities really do get cold. When I'm in my sleeping bag or walking, it's ok, but the times at the shelters are uncomfortable, to say the least.
As we walked to higher elevations, the snow became deeper, and at times we were walking in knee-deep drifts. Hiking in these conditions really slowed us down, and it was difficult to walk in such conditions. I began to think that after I finish the trail at Katahdin, I'll do my best to avoid being outdoors in cold weather for the rest of my life. No more Chiefs games in December! I know it will be hot and miserable at times this summer, but I promise not to complain about the heat. At least I won't be cold and walking in snow. Then again, it could be raining and cold, so I suppose it could be worse.
Max Patch Summit is an iconic spot on the AT. It was originally cleared for cattle, and is maintained as a bald nowadays. It's a beautiful location, with 360-degree views. However, the climb up to it was brutal, to say the least. (It seems I use the word ""brutal"" a lot, but it best describes what we dealt with.) The wind was howling, and the snow was again knee-deep in some spots. I took a video at the top, the wind was so strong you can barely hear my voice. It was too cold to stay there long and enjoy the views, so I quickly headed down and continued on the trail. There will be other spots on the trail that are just as beautiful, and it will be warmer so I can enjoy them.
Today is Packer's 40th birthday. We wanted to celebrate, but everyone was too cold, so after arriving at the shelter, we all ate our Ramen noodles and went to bed. It was a truly miserable evening until I cocooned in my bag. Please, Spring, hurry up and get here!","

As we left the extreme cold shelter, and elevation started dropping. In about 3.5 miles, we came to Lemon Gap, and waiting there was the wonderful trail angel known as Fresh Ground. He had a tarps set up at the gap, and inside he was cooking his famous banana pancakes and chili. We sat there for about an hour, eating until we could eat no more. I had two large pancakes, a bowl of chili, a coke, two cups of coffee, and some other food I can't even remember. Fresh Ground travels up the trail, usually setting up for four or five days in one location, feeding every hiker that comes through. He uses donations to fund this project, and if anyone wants to help out hikers, you can find Fresh Ground's Leap Frog Cafe on FB and donate there. He keeps moving north until he's out of money for food. I left him a donation, and it was worth every penny. He's also an entertaining and knowledgeable guy. I hope I run into him again up the trail.
Two summits faced us as we left Lemon Gap with full bellies: Walnut Mountain and Bluff Mountain. They were difficult (they're never easy), but after that we began descending. Eventually, there was no snow on the ground, and it actually felt warmer. Since we had spent so much time eating earlier, the afternoon was almost gone when Okie and Camo (who hike faster then I) got to a tenting site near Garenflo Gap. I joined them, and Packer came along later. We pitched tents (and Packer her hammock), ate, then built a campfire. It was wonderful to be out of the snow and bitter cold. Camo looked around as dusk came upon us, with the campfire warming our spirits, and said, ""This is how it's supposed to be. This is how I pictured the AT."" And he was right.

But the lower I went, the warmer it got. The sunshine felt great, and it was an all-around beautiful day.
I pulled into town right at noon. The first thing I did was to find the gas station, where I had two RC Colas from the bottle and a Moon Pie. I sat on a bench outside the station and luxuriated in the warm sun. Aaaaah. That was more like it.
I then walked across the street to Elmer's Sunnybank Inn and got a private room. The Inn is an amazing place. It was built in 1840, and is on the National Historic Registry. It's full of antiques, and they serve optional organic vegan meals. Also, it's right in the middle of town, so it's close to a restaurant, bar, library, and the like.

I'll try to keep up with it from now on, but it was difficult to do the past couple of weeks due to weak signals and cold fingers. I won't promise to always have an entry every day, but I'll try. Also, I have several questions I need to get to, but probably won't today. I've been typing for two hours now, and I need to go outside and enjoy the sunshine. I'll try to get to the questions soon. Thanks for understanding.
Hot Springs is a cool little town. Though smaller than I had imagined, it has everything you need, including restaurants, a bar, outfitter, and library (where I am right now). The AT actually runs down the main street of town, so if you walk the trail, you have to walk through Hot Springs. The people are friendly and appreciative of hikers.
As for the Smokies, here are some impressions:
The Smokies are difficult (as if any part of the trail is not difficult.) You're at higher elevations most of the time, anywhere from 4000-6000 feet. It may be warm and toasty in the valley below, but blowing snow and cold up in the mountains. I know I'll have even more difficult climbs ahead, especially in New England, but maybe my body will be in better shape then.
All the shelters in the National Park had large tarps covering the fourth wall, which is usually open to the elements. That helped a lot in the cold conditions. Also, most, if not all, have fireplaces inside the shelter, though we were able to use one of the once, since it was difficult to find dry wood. I guess a lot of mice hang out in the shelters, but I have yet to see one. Some people see mice at every shelter, so I know they're around. Some shelters have privies (outhouses), and some don't, which means you have to use a cathole. I've come to appreciate privies, even in the bitter cold. It doesn't take long for the seat to warm up. 
I won't even mention the cold and snow in the Smokies. You've heard me complain too much about that. 
It's early afternoon. Time for me to go get a beer and lunch, then maybe find one of those hot springs everyone talks about. I could use an hour soaking in warm water about now.","

Therefore, I now have a good chance of finishing my trek since I’m now past Hot Springs. Barring injury, I definitely plan on completing this journey. 
It was a difficult walk out of Hot Springs. It was about a thousand foot climb in a mile and a half. My legs did not want to cooperate. I began to think that what trail legs I might have gained had deserted me. However, as I continued walking, my legs got stronger. By mid-morning, I was doing fine, and generally had no problems the rest of the day. 
It was cloudy and probably in the 40s early in the day. By mid-morning, though, most of the clouds had disappeared, and the warm sunshine felt great. What a difference from last week! Around noon, I came to a pond, and following that was a pasture area. I was blown away by how nice a day it was with warmth and sunshine. 
I stopped about 1:00 for lunch, and Chowdown caught up with me. He and I hiked together most of the rest of the afternoon. Although there were more ascents, most of them were gradual enough to be fairly easy. 
I stopped at Spring Mountain Shelter, a small, older building. Three other hikers will be staying in the shelter with me, and Packer pitched her hammock nearby. Okie and Camo hiked on a couple of more miles to tent for the night. 
It’s amazing how much better it is to walk in warm, comfortable weather. I was in a tee shirt most of the day, and it’s so nice not to be freezing tonight. Although some rain and possibly some snow is forecast for later this week, I don’t think it’ll be as bad as last week. I sure hope not.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584463,"Bad news. I’m off the trail for a couple of days. I contracted an infection on my big toe that was getting worse. A section hiker who’s also a pharmacist saw it last night and suggested I keep a close watch on it, or it could be a serious situation. After walking a while this morning, it started hurting, and the pharmacist’s words kept going through my mind. So I said goodbye to Packer, and called the nearby hostel to pick me up.

After checking in, Diana from the hostel was nice enough to drive me to a clinic in Greeneville, TN. There they drained the infection, wrapped it, and prescribed a strong antibiotic. They also advised resting my foot for a couple of days. So I’m staying at the Hemlock Hollow Inn until at least Thursday morning. 
Since a snow storm is supposed to move in, I really don’t mind hanging out for a couple of days reading a novel or two. It’s a nice, quiet place, but has no cell service. At least they have a strong WiFi at the office, but no signal at all at the bunkhouse. I’d rather take a couple of days off now rather than jeopardize the journey, so I guess I made the right call to get it checked out.
I’ll spend some time tomorrow answering questions from the guest book. I wish I could be back on the trail, but a couple of lost days in March are a small price to pay for a successful hike.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584516,"It’s been a slow day at Hemlock Hollow Inn. I’ve taken care of the usual zero-day chores: a shower, etc. Diana did my laundry for me. This really is a nice, quiet place, and you can drive to it. So even if you’re not hiking, you can come here for a relaxing few days. If doing that, you might want to avoid the busy hiker season, though. 
I’ve relaxed in bed reading a novel, trying to keep my foot elevated. It was sunshiny and warm this morning, but has been raining most of the afternoon, and the air has a chill to it. Snow is supposed to start soon, and is predicted to continue all day tomorrow. A good day to stay in bed and read. 
Ally and Matt, it’s good to hear from you! That was a nice, warm afternoon in the sunshine. Of course, we know what happened that night: a lot of snow. My best to you. 
I finally have time to answer some questions. If I miss any, please ask again and I’ll try to get to them as I can. 
Buzz from NB asked about mice in the shelters in the Smokies. People laugh when I say I haven’t seen one mouse, but it’s true. Some people see mice in every shelter, in or out of the Smokies, so I know they’re there. I have heard them before. I hang my food bag at night, as everyone should. I also leave my pack open so mice can get into it if they want. I leave nothing in there for them, but at least they won’t chew through the pack to find out. One lady left a half-filled Smart Water bottle open one night. The next morning, two drowned mice were inside. I tend not to worry about them: it’s part of the trail experience. 
Don from NC asked about resupply and pack weight. Generally, it’s easy to resupply every three to four days. I had a bit of a problem at NOC and Fontana because their general stores had not yet opened for the season. At least the gas station at Fontana had some supplies. Generally, though, it has not been a problem so far. 
As for pack weight, I went through a shakedown at Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap in November as part of the AT prep class taught by Scott and Ariane. That helped a lot. I invested in ultralight equipment, especially the big three: tent, sleeping bag, and backpack. A site called outdoor gear lab has an ultralight section that recommends ultralight gear. It can be expensive, but it was worth it to me. My weight has crept up a bit with cold-weather gear, and I’d like to keep it at 25 lbs or lighter. It was 29 when I got here, but that’s with six days of food, since I had planned to push through to Erwin before resupplying. Not bad, but it could be better. 
A reader in OH asked about Guthook, an app for the AT. I rely on it a lot. Since it uses GPS, it works even when you have no service. It shows right where you are on the trail, and one view shows upcoming elevation changes. If you ever get off the trail and are lost, you can use it to get back on the trail. I try not to use it too much, because it can be discouraging to see a 1500-foot climb ahead. On the other hand, if I’ve been going up for an hour, it can be nice to take a look and realize I’m almost at the top. It also has a lot of good comments, usually from other hikers, about water supplies, hostels, shelters, and the like. I won’t say it’s absolutely necessary, but it is a worthwhile resource for me. 
Kathie in NH asked about my tag “aka Lefty-Righty.”  When I section-hiked last summer with the “Fat Guys,” I told them the story about when I first got my trekking poles. I was walking along and noticed an “L” on one of the straps. I thought to myself, “Darn! These are large poles. I’m rather short, so maybe smaller poles would be better.” I walked on a bit, then noticed the “R” on the other strap. Doh! “L” is for “left,” and “R” is for “right.”  The Fat Guys thought that was a funny story, so they (Skeezix, specifically) named me “Lefy-Rightly.”  When I decided to do a thru-hike, I opted to take on “Vagabond Jack,” since my family and friends know me by that moniker on my fb page. However, if I ever do another section with the Fat Guys, I’ll use Lefty-Righty for that hike. Thus, I use the addendum to my thru-hiker trail name. 
Thanks to everyone else for the encouraging comments. I read and appreciate all of them.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584604,"It’s been snowing and cold all day. I’m glad I’ve had a legitimate excuse to be in a warm place, out of the weather. Starting in mid-afternoon, hikers stared rolling in to Hemlock Hollow to get off the trail for the night, looking for a place to escape the unpleasant conditions. I realized the bunkhouse would probably fill up, so I moved to a private cabin. It’s quite nice, but, of course, more expensive than a bunk. I’m glad I moved, though; the bunkhouse will be crowded, and it probably would have made for a restless night, considering all the snoring and other sounds people make while sleeping. Last night, I had the whole place to myself. 
The weather is supposed to improve tomorrow, but I may wait one more day before heading out, just to make sure my toe is on the mend. I haven’t changed the dressing this evening, so I’ll see how it looks then before deciding. 
I’ve been planning my next few days of walking. I hope to make it to Erwin, TN, in four or five days. I will probably resupply there, and maybe stay in a motel and or hostel for a night, but I will not take s zero day there, as I had originally planned. I want to get some miles under my belt, and will try to go at least 10 days or even two weeks before doing so again. I almost feel guilty about taking so much time off this week, but I know it’s the smart thing to do. 
I want to thank Diana and her family for being such good hosts. Even though I’ve been hanging around here for a few days, they are very accommodating and pleasant to be around. Each hostel has its own personality, and this is one of relaxation and caring. They go out of their way to make sure you feel welcome and at home. 
That’s about it for today. I’ll update you all again tomorrow, assuming I’m not on the trail somewhere without a signal.","

I decided to wait one more day before heading back out onto the trail. Besides giving my toe another day of healing, the weather should be a bit better. The sun finally came out today, and the snow is beginning to melt. I’ll be glad to get back out there instead of lazing around the hostel. 
Since I have some time, I thought I’d write down a few of my thoughts about the AT. I may be repeating some of my earlier writings, and, if I do, I apologize. Sometimes I forget what I’ve posted versus what I’ve thought about or talked over with others. I guess I need a good editor to make sure I’m not duplicating previous entries. At any rate, here goes. 
Hiking the AT (or any long trail) is not easy. If you ever meet someone who claims to have walked it and says it was not difficult, you know one thing for certain: that person is not telling the truth. Some parts are less difficult, from what I understand, but it’s never easy. I’ll be glad when I get to those easier sections. It’s always up and down, and, as much as I dislike the ascents, going down presents its own problems. I imagine my toe got infected due to the long descent into Hot Springs because my toes were constantly being jammed into the front of my shoes. Also, you use different leg muscles when going down, and you often have to hold yourself back, else gravity will cause problems as you accelerate out of control. Gradual ascents and descents are usually ok, until you kick a darned rock, causing a sharp pain in a toe or two. Unfortunately, most of the trail so far has not consisted of slowly-changing grade, but is usually either a rather steep climb or descent. 
On the other hand, if it were easy, everybody would do it. One of the reasons I do the trail is a sense of accomplishment. Yes, it hurts making that slow, four-mile walk out of a gap. But the feeling of “I did it! I beat that mountain!” when you reach the apex is exhilarating. I  imagine endorphins have something to do with it, but, in any case, it’s a great feeling. 
I have another take on the trail, but I can’t take credit for the idea, since I may have heard it from someone else, so it’s probably not an original thought. The idea is that walking the almost 2200 miles is like attending school. While doing miles zero through 99, you’re in kindergarten, miles 100-199 is first grade, 200-299 is second grade, and so on. You learn something in each phase, building upon what you’ve already discovered. By the time you’ve reached mile 1700, you’ve graduated from college. The final five hundred miles are grad school and post-graduate work, until, finally, you reach the ultimate graduation ceremony at the top of Mount Katahdin. People say they’re elated but sad when it’s over, kind of like making it through school, but knowing you’re leaving behind some of the best times you’ll ever have, and that life will never be the same. I only hope I make it to that final bittersweet moment when I can take the last of my 5 million steps and walk down as a graduate of the Class of 2018. 
I suppose I’m presumptuous to analyze the trail as I just have. People who have competed thru hikes may say that I should wait until I finish before making such an assessment. However, those are some of my thoughts of the trail to date. 
I’ll be heading back out to the trail tomorrow morning. I’m planning on going only 10 miles or so, but the first five miles are all uphill. After that, I plan to start putting in more miles per day. Of course, Mike Tyson said, “Everybody has plan until they get punched in the mouth.”","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585096,"Once again, the trail proved to me that I can’t assume anything. I knew I had only 11 miles or so to go after I left a Hemlock Hollow, but the first five miles were all uphill. I planned on it taking me about five hours to get to the top, followed by an easy quick walk to the shelter, since the last section appeared to be fairly level, with some short ups and downs. Surprisingly, I made it to the top in about three hours. I thought I’d cruise the rest of the day and be in the shelter by mid-afternoon. Was I ever wrong. 
First of all, even though it was a clear and sunny day, at higher elevations, snow blanketed the landscape. The trail became snow packed, with ice in some areas. At times, I was stepping in knee-deep drifts. This all combined to slow me down. 
Then I came to Big Firescape Knob, a high ridge providing views of the valley below. After that we’re the rocks. Or should I say boulders. The trail forces you to climb through and over these rocks. The fact they were often covered in snow and ice made traversing them even more treacherous. A few times I had to use both hands to scramble over and down the facades. I’m not a rock climber, so I took my time to maneuver this area. It probably took me at least two hours to complete the 1.4 mile section, and I felt like this was the most difficult part of the trail I’ve encountered. I know there will be more areas similar to this one, especially in New England, so I guess it was good training for that. I was glad to finally leave those rocks in one piece. 
I finally made it to Jerry’s Cabin Shelter, a small structure that sleeps six, and it was full later that night. The shelter had a fireplace, and a warm, roaring fire was going when I got there. Earlier in the day, I had met Ben and Rose, a married couple from upstate New York. I had talked with them as they ate lunch, and found them to be a charming couple. After arriving at the shelter, Ben had found a dead tree, so even though the ground was covered in snow, we had dry wood. I was able to put my shoes and socks near the fire to dry out, and Rose was nice enough to turn my socks during the evening to help them dry. Very nice people. 
One of the six people at the shelter was Curb. He’s about my age, and is trying to complete a walk he began last year, during which he suffered a knee injury. He and I would begin walking together in a couple of days, since we move at about the same pace, although he’s a bit faster. I swear, I’m the slowest person on the trail!

It was foggy until noon, and I spent a lot of time walking in snow, ice, and slush. I was in a bad mood because of the weather. I know I can’t expect the best conditions out here, but the cold is getting to me and everyone else. 
Except for a short section of rocks, the terrain was fairly easy. I rolled into Flint Mountain Shelter about 2:00, which is early to stop, but I wanted to be in a shelter for the night. It was already almost full, with a group of young hikers there. Curb was also staying there. He and I talked and decided to try to make it to Nature’s Inn Hostel the next day. 
Some more hikers came in, and a couple of them had to tent. It was so miserable that everyone was in their bags and sleeping by 6:00 or so. It was definitely too cold to stay up and chat.","Jerry’s Cabin Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585101,"It was warmer in the morning. My fingers and toes weren’t numb while breaking camp, but it was still on the chilly side. Although it had rained overnight, I was relieved it had moved out by daybreak. The walk was the normal ups and downs, and there was some snow and mud. However, as the elevation lowered, the snow was gone, and much of the trail was normal and dry. One section crossed a large meadow, and, with the sun out, it was quite nice. 
Curb and I decided to make it to Sam’s Gap, then catch a ride to Nature’s Inn Hostel. I called Sara at the hostel in the afternoon, and she said to call when we got to the Gap, and she’d pick us up in about 10 minutes. We got there about 5:15 and I left a message. We were starting to get cold, as it clouded up, and our feet were wet didn’t help. She finally showed up about 6:45 and took us to the hostel. She was short-handed, and therefore had been shuttling people from other pickup areas. 
At the hostel, we checked in, got some food, and took a shower. It was crowded, with several 20-somethings and other older hikers. The bubble has definitely caught up with me, and is passing me by. I’ve begun to wonder what all these people are doing on my trail. It was kind a nice in the early days when fewer people were on the trail. Oh well, I’m sure it will thin out some day. 
It was 10:00 by the time we got to the bunkhouse, and Sara set up a 7:00am shuttle back to the trailhead for us. So it was a short night, and I had a hard time falling asleep.

I kept hoping the clouds would move out, as the sun kept trying to peek through. Finally, it became a sunny day. Although not warm, the sunshine was a psychological boost. I walked about six miles, mostly up to reach the top of Big Bald. Several young hikers were already there, enjoying the sunshine and the 360 degree views. It was almost luxurious to be there basking in the warmth with the scenery. I stayed there close to a half hour before heading out. 
Curb was waiting at Big Bald Shelter when I got there in the afternoon. We decided to hike on to Whistling Gap and tent there. It was a downhill walk until the climb up Little Bald, which was rather difficult since it had no switchbacks. It was straight up the side of the mountain. I then descended to the gap. By then, it was clouding up, and the wind started howling.  As we were setting up our tents, a couple of other solo hikers showed up, including a young lady named Donut. She had a hurt leg and was low on food, so I gave her a packet of Ramen and a candy bar. 
We all quickly ate dinner, then retreated to our tents for the night. I was in bed before sundown, escaping from the cold. Tomorrow, we would walk into Erwin, TN, and I was looking forward to being in town for a night.","Sam’s Gap

I ate a cold breakfast sitting in my tent, then packed up. Then it was immediately up to High Rocks, a not particularly difficult climb. However, as the name indicates, it was covered in rocks. I didn’t have to scramble, but it was slow going. 
As I was descending to Spivey Gap, I noticed the sun had come out, and it was starting to warm up. Then it was the normal ups and downs until I began the long descent to Erwin. On the way, I briefly talked with a day hiker, telling him I couldn’t wait to get a coke when I reached the hostel. He said goodbye and headed down ahead of me. By then, it was quite warm and sunny, which made me crave a soda even more. 
It seemed to go on forever, but I finally made it to the infamous Uncle Johnny’s Hostel, where Curb was waiting. Just then, the young day hiker ran up to me with a cold Pepsi. As he explained that Johnny’s doesn’t have coke, he handed the bottle to me. I thanked him, then began guzzling. It was fantastic! I never know when I’ll encounter trail magic, and I always appreciate it when I do. 
Not wanting to stay at a crowded hostel, Curb and I caught a shuttle into town. Erwin is spread out, so nothing is within walking distance. We checked into a motel, got cleaned up, and shuttled to a Mexican restaurant. We had some good food and a couple of beers, then rode back to the motel, where we did laundry. When I was finally in bed, it was after 11:00, and it was after midnight before I could fall asleep. For some reason, I had a hard time sleeping that night. At least it wasn’t cold!

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585166,"We had a lot to get done before hitting the trail. First was a motel breakfast, then a shuttle to Walmart for resupply. By the time we got dropped off at Johnny’s, it was 11:30. 
It was so nice to feel the warm sun at we resumed hiking. As I walked along in my t-shirt, a bead of sweat rolled down my right cheek. It was such a welcome change from what I’d felt when cold, that I didn’t wipe it away, but let it travel down to my beard, enjoying the fact that I was actually hot. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d felt sweet sweat on my face. 
The climb out of Erwin wasn’t too difficult. However, I wasn’t paying attention at one point and inadvertently got off the trail. I expended a lot of energy, beating my way through brush to rejoin the trail. I felt stupid, but it happens if I don’t pay attention. A series of rather steep switchbacks then began, and I wished I had some of that energy I had wasted getting back on the trail. 
By the time I reached Curly Maple Gap Shelter, I was tired and ready for some lunch. Curb was waiting there, and the shelter was full of a party crowd, guzzling beers and talking loudly. Curb and I decided to keep walking, and ended up pitching tents at Indian Grave Gap. It was a nice spot, and the weather was perfect for tenting. It was excellent to be able to be outside without cold dominating the environment.

After dealing with nasty weather, and knowing that more less than ideal days are ahead, I was ever so grateful for a day like this one. 
After breaking camp, the first order of business was to climb up to Beauty Spot, which lived up to its name. It’s an open field with a lot of low grass, affording some views of the surrounding area. 
I knew the climb up Unaka Mountain, a 1000-feet rise covering two miles, was next, so I stopped to get water. It was warm and sunny, so I took the time to eat lunch and enjoy the weather. Then I started the walk up. It was not necessarily difficult, but it took a while to walk those two miles. 
Near the top, I noticed a spruce decorated like a Christmas tree a few feet off the trail to my left. I walked over to it, and discovered it was a memorial for a young man named Max. In addition to ornaments, pictures of Max hung from the tree. I signed the log book, noting what a fitting tribute it was. 
With Max’s tree on my mind, I started thinking about all the people I’ve lost over the years. From my cousin John, who died way too young at 17, to my grandparents, parents, friends, Army buddies, and my wife, Jean. Just then, the forest turned into a beautiful area with spruce trees everywhere. With the piney scent in the air, it was like a garden of large Christmas trees. I won’t lie; I became emotional thinking that, like Max’s tree, these trees were fitting memorials for my loved ones who have passed on. It was one of those special moments I’ve experienced on the trail. 
When I got to Cherry Gap Shelter, Curb was waiting. Even though it was only mid-afternoon, we decided to stop there for the night. I even had time to fix a cup of coffee. It was a small shelter, and by the time we went to bed, it was near capacity. Somehow I ended up next to someone who snored loudly most of the night. Just my luck!

At least there were no big climbs; only the normal ups and downs. We made it to Clyde Smith Shelter by 2:00, and could have continued. But that would have meant tenting in the bad weather, so we decided to stay there. The shelter filled up early, with hikers eager to get out of the rain and cold. Several hikers pitched tents near the shelter. I lucked out again and ended up with a snorer next to me. 
One of the hikers who stayed there was Bruce Matson. He’s featured on a weekly podcast put on by Mighty Blue, covering Bruce’s journey. Bruce has the trail name RTK, which stands for “Returning to Katahdin.” Since we are both friends of Steve Adams (Mighty Blue), we have a kinship, and it was great to finally meet him.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585562,"A long day. It was dry and sunny, but a tad on the cold side. We knew we had a long climb ahead of us: Roan Mountain. In a five-mile stretch, we would ascend about 2200 feet to a peak over 6000 feet. 
No one section of the walk up Roan Mountain was difficult. It was mainly a seemingly-endless series of switchbacks. I stopped about two-thirds of the way up for a quick lunch, if only to replenish my energy. As I started walking again, I kept repeating my mantra: keep going, and eventually you’ll get there. Near the top, much of the trail was covered in ice, slowing me down even more. Finally I reached the apex.
In the 19th Century, a luxury hotel was atop Roan Mountain. A sign explained that guests enjoyed bowling, croquet, golf, and three meals for the daily fee of two dollars. The hotel straddled the Tennessee/North Carolina border, and alcohol, though legal in Tennessee, was illegal in North Carolina. A line was painted down the middle, and a North Carolina sheriff would arrest anyone who stepped over the line with a drink. The foundation of the place is still visible. 
As I was beginning my descent, I met a couple of day hikers coming up the mountain. The woman stopped and said, “You were in Hot Springs!” It turns out she was the pharmacist at the clinic I visited there, and she remembered me. She asked about my toe, so I bored her with the saga of the toe. You never know who you’ll meet on the trail. 
I then saw three young hikers I had briefly met: Summit, Geo, and Bearfoot. They’re enjoyable people who are taking their time to experience the trail, rather than be concerned with knocking out big miles every day, as so many people are. In fact, they average only about 12 miles a day, which is my goal. The trio, along with Curb and me, decided to tent near the Stan Murray Shelter. We were joined there by two section hikers, whom we had met the day before. 
As we were pitching our tents, the wind picked up, and it turned colder. I quickly ate, talked with the kids a bit, and went to bed. It was extremely windy overnight. At times, I thought it would blow my tent over with me in it. It was not the best night for sleeping, but at least I didn’t have to listen to snoring.

Word has come up to me that they had hoped to meet me in Erwin, but somehow we missed each other. I understand that the mother is a reader of my journal, and had wanted to say “hi” in person. I also understand that Little Blue is off the trail for a couple of days, recovering from an injury. My best to him and to Mom! I hope to meet them both someplace up the trail. 
I packed up early, not only because of the cold wind, but also because we would make the walk into the village of Roan Mountain, almost 12 miles away. It was going to be an easy hike, with a couple of uphills followed by a long easy jaunt into town. Or so I thought. 
After a few normal ups and downs, I came to Little Hump Mountain. I stared at the upcoming trail in disbelief. It was straight up the side of a grass-covered bald, about a nine-hundred feet rise in a bit more than a mile. No switchbacks. Just straight up. And I thought it would be easy. I should know better by now. 
Then came the inevitable downhill, followed by another straight-up climb to the top of Hump Mountain. It was slow going, with me taking six-inch steps to gradually move up. At least I can now go farther without taking short breaks, but I still felt like a snail on an oily surface. Eventually, though, I reached the top. 
Then came the long downhill into Roan Mountain. Easy, I thought. Again I was fooled. At least half of the downward slope was covered in rocks. No scrambling was required, but carefully considering each step made for slow progress. Finally, the trail became normal, if there is such a thing, and switchbacks lessened the severity of the incline. 
In a way, the day was more difficult than the climb up Roan Mountain, which I knew would be a challenge. But I expected an easy stroll into town, so the surprise of the rough terrain made it harder. Had I been mentally prepared for what lay ahead, it may not have been such a tiring day. 
When I made it to the road crossing, hikers told me a food truck was just down the road at a nearby hostel. I walked down there and had a soda, burger, and fries. It was wonderful. Packer was there, so we talked a bit. However, the hostel had only one bunk left, and I preferred a private room. I ended up contacting Dave at Doe River Hiker Retreat, another local hostel. A former thru-hiker gave me a ride back to the trailhead, where Dave picked me up. 
Curb was staying at the same place, so after I checked in and took a shower, Dave shuttled us to a pub he owns, where we had a couple of beers. Then it was back to the hostel for the night.","Tent Site Near Stan Murray Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585592,"It was nice to take a much-needed zero day in Roan Mountain. Dave drove Curb and me to a diner for a big breakfast and a resupply stop, then it was back to the hostel to relax. I worked on my journal, and took it easy. In mid-afternoon, we went back to the diner for a burger and fries. I also had a blackberry shake, which tasted quite good. Before you wonder about my eating habits, I have lost about 14 pounds so far, so I can justify a little gluttony when I’m in a town. 
After the food, it was time to go get a couple of beers at the pub, then back to the hostel to pack for tomorrow, when we’ll be back on the trail. It’s supposed to be good weather tomorrow, but it may cool off with rain after that. We’ll see. Also, the trail is said to be less difficult now, but I’m not expecting a walk in the park. 
I’ll do my best to keep my journal updated while on the trail. However, sometimes the signal is extremely weak or non-existent. Also, it was difficult to write when it was so cold my fingers were numb. I hope both of these conditions improve soon, which will help me stay current. Also, I’m having a hard time getting pictures to post, so I’ll work on that when I can. 
Thanks again to everyone for your positive comments. They help me keep the right attitude to continue this journey. By the way, I should pass the 400-mile mark tomorrow. Only about 1800 more to go!","

Rather than walking out of Roan Mountain, I waddled. That’s because Dave took us to the local bakery for breakfast, where I wolfed down an omelette, hash browns, and one of the best biscuits in the world. I was stuffed. 
The hike out of most trail towns is a strenuous uphill climb. Leaving Roan Mountain, though, was quite pleasant. Sure, there were some ups and downs, but nothing like we normally experience. Also, it was warm and sunny all day. Rain is predicted for tonight, and I definitely felt the humidity as the day wore on. 
One of the highlights of the day was crossing the 400-mile mark, almost one fifth of the way. Shortly after that milestone, I came to Jones Falls, one of several waterfalls I understand are upcoming. It’s an amazing site, so I ate my lunch by the falls, listening to the water cascade down the mountainside. 
As I was leaving, I ran into Easily Forgotten and Bunny Tracks, a married couple I had met the evening before at the hostel, coming to enjoy the falls. We talked a bit, then I headed on. 
Part of the trail passed a cemetery and a Baptist church, then it meandered through meadows and along a river. Wildflowers were popping up everywhere. It was a gentle “walk in the woods,” as Bryson called it. 
Shortly before arriving at the shelter, I came upon Mountaineer Falls, another beautiful site. Curb was at the shelter when I arrived, and we decided to stay here for the night because of the impending rain. We had hoped to put in more miles today, but didn’t want to tent if the weather was bad. A while later, Stickers and Lady Bug showed up. They’re an enjoyable young couple, and we stayed up later than normal talking with them. Not being cold may have had something to do with that also. 
I must also mention that Mountaineer Falls Shelter is the best shelter I’ve stayed in other than the Fontana Hilton. It’s a fairly new and roomy facility, with no holes in the walls. The interior is painted, and it even has a third level. 
While in camp, I called the company that makes my shoes. I already have a hole in one of them, and I’ve worn them under 300 miles. The company is shipping a free pair to Damascus for me. It’ll be my third pair of shoes so far. 
Speaking of Damascus, we hope to make it there sometime this weekend. Curb’s wife is driving from Nashville to meet him there, and I need to finish and file my taxes. So we’ll be in Damascus for a day or two. It’ll be another milestone as we leave behind another state and begin the 500-mile walk through Virginia.","Village of Roan Mountain

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585833,"It rained overnight, as expected, and the morning was cloudy with light showers. By mid-morning, the rain had stopped, and the sun came out. It became warm and pleasant, a good day for walking. The terrain was not difficult, though a tad more taxing than yesterday. I crossed several streams, and the green forest was quite pleasant. 
By mid-afternoon, though, the wind picked up and had a cold bite to it. I met Curb at a shelter, although we had no intentions of staying there. We decided to walk to a tent site, which would make for a 12-mile day. 
We arrived at the site about 4:00pm. By then, it was definitely cold, and the wind was whipping through the area. I consulted Guthook, the online app, and noted that a hostel was only four miles ahead. I said I was tired of the cold, and Curb agreed. So I ate one Cliff bar, downed two Advil, and we started walking the four miles. 
The walk down to the hostel was not especially easy. A lot of the trail was covered in rocks, making for slow going at times. However, we arrived at the Black Bear Resort by 6:30, and the owner showed to a small cabin, where we would spend the night. We had pizza and beer, then hit the sack early. After all, we had walked 16 miles that day, a new record for me.","Mountaineer Falls Shelter
",Black Bear Resort,"Apr 04, Wed",16
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585849,"As we left the hostel, we faced a dilemma. The shelter at Watauga Lake was closed, and has been for some time, due to bear activity. Also, it is advised to not tent camp in the area, again due to bears. So we could either walk more than 17 miles to reach the Vandeventer Shelter, or stop at Boots Off Hostel, some eight plus miles ahead. After yesterday’s long hike, it was an easy decision. We would stop at the hostel. 
The first three or four miles were easy, except for a rocky trail. In one section, the rocky trail curved around a hillside, hugging the embankment, with Laurel Fork River on one side. It was so narrow that if I had met a southbound hiker, one of us would have had to retreat to let the other person get by. Also, there were a lot of rock steps along the way, both up and down. Some of them were knee-high, causing me to strain as I negotiated them. My trekking poles help a lot in such situations. 
We also passed some beautiful scenery, including the Laurel Creek Falls. And the weather, although a bit on the cool side at first, was nice. The sun was out, and the wind was virtually nonexistent. 
Up next was Pond Mountain, a rise of about 1700 feet in three miles. Before beginning the climb, we rested, ate, and talked for 15 or 20 minutes. Then it was up. Curb didn’t seem to mind the uphill, but I stopped two or three times to rest a few minutes before continuing. That seemed to help my legs negotiate the many steep switchbacks that led to the top. 
A spring at the top provided fresh water, and Curb called me to a sunny spot, where we had a leisurely lunch. Then it was an easy downhill walk to the hostel. 
Boots Off is a great hostel. We’re in the bunkhouse, but it’s warm. Sometimes these buildings can be on the cool side. Each bunk is set up like a berth on a train, with individual lights, outlets to charge phones, and curtains for privacy. I’ve never seen a bunkhouse like this one. 
Several other hikers I know were already here, including Stickers and Lady Bug, Easily Forgotten and Bunny Steps, Donut, and Scars. RTK also showed up. It was good to see and talk with all of them. Also, Packer is here. She’s going to walk with Curb and me, at least as far as Damascus. 
I paid five dollars to get my laundry done and took a shower this afternoon. At six, they shuttled us to Hampton, where I got a Big Mac. I’ll bet it’s been 20 years since I’ve eaten one of those monstrosities. It’s amazing what hiker hunger will do to you. I also picked up a six-pack, which Curb and I shared at the hostel. 
A bonfire was waiting when we got back to the hostel, and it was enjoyable to sit around the fire talking with everyone. Most of the others are doing the “42-Mile Challenge,” which means they are going to hike the 42 miles to Damascus tomorrow. They are “slack packing,” whereby the hostel will drive their packs to Damascus, and they’ll hike with day packs, carrying just enough to get there without camping along the way. Curb, Packer, and I will forgo the challenge, which I consider insane, and will try to make it there by Sunday. However, snow and/or rain is predicted for Saturday, so we’ll play it by ear, as we always do. 
It’s time for me to turn out my light and, I hope, get a good night’s sleep. We’ll see what tomorrow brings.","Black Bear Resort

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586033,"I proclaim today Watauga Lake Day! We have a National Pancake Day, a National Puppy Day, and a National No Housework Day. Why not a National Watauga Lake Day?
After a complimentary continental breakfast at the hostel (a nice touch), Packer, Curb, and I headed back to the trail. It was an easy walk, with the trail hugging the shoreline of Watauga Lake, and occasionally jutting into the woods. We passed by the closed Watauga Lake Shelter, which is shut down due to bear activity. After reaching the dam and crossing it, we followed the road a while until the trail headed into the woods and began an easy climb. Most of the time, Watauga Lake was in view to my right. 
We reached the top, then began ridge walking. Of course, ups and downs were par for the course, but nothing dramatic. Again, Watauga Lake was almost always in sight, slowly becoming smaller as I walked along. Eventually, I came to Vandeventer Shelter, my home for the night. Two section hikers were already there, and two more showed up later, so six of us would sleep in the small shelter. Packer, as always, slept in her hammock. Behind the shelter was a view down to the valley below, dominated by Watauga Lake. Do you see why it was Watauga Lake Day? I was able to see different views of the lake all day long, culminating in an overview from the top of a mountain. It was an impressive sight, looking down at the water, docks, and surrounding area. 
Although it had been sunny but cool in the morning, by noon clouds dominated the sky. The wind picked up, and had a cold bite to it. Since the shelter faced north, it made for a somewhat cold late afternoon and evening. Rain was predicted for the night, with rain, sleet, and snow in the forecast for the next afternoon. I was glad we had made it to the shelter before the rain hit, and hoped it wouldn’t be unbearable that night. 
Sure enough, it rained in the night, sometimes quite heavy. Even though it wasn’t pleasant, it was nothing like the cold nights I had experienced in March. I stayed warm in my bag, hoping the rain would end by morning.","Boots Off Hostel 
",Vandeventer Shelter ,"Apr 06, Fri",9.30
Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586037,"Thankfully, the rain had stopped by morning, leaving a misty, foggy morning. As we were packing up, one of the section hikers commented about how cold it had been that night. I didn’t say anything, but thought to myself, you have no idea what cold it. Yes, it had been in the upper 30s, but it was actually comfortable compared to what we had experienced last month. 
It was an easy day of mainly ridge walking. At times, the fog became quite soupy, and although it was a tad on the cold side, I became warm and had to remove my buff and balaclava after a while. 
Since it was supposed to rain, sleet, and snow in the afternoon, then drop to the low 20s at night, I had made a reservation for us to stay in a hostel. We trudged along through the fog, feeling the air become colder as the day wore on. I was glad the wind was nonexistent, else it would have been unpleasant. 
We reached the parking lot near the hostel, and, after I called, the owner picked us up and drove us to our home for the night. We’re in a one-room cabin with three beds. A bathhouse is a few feet away, but there is no resupply here. Not even a soda machine. At least we’ll be inside where it’s warm instead of a cold shelter. 
About the time we arrived here, it started sleeting, then snowing. However, it didn’t last long. Maybe we’ll luck out and won’t have to walk in snow tomorrow. 
Since no food was available here, except for our backpacking fare, I called a service that delivers. After waiting an eon or two, three large pizzas and a six-pack of coke arrived. We chowed down as if it were a Thanksgiving spread, enjoying every bite and gulp. I even have leftover pizza for breakfast tomorrow. 
Before signing off, Kathi from NH, I’ll be sure to contact you when I get up your way. Thanks for your offer. I hope the weather in Mt. Washington isn’t as bad when I get there. 
Mama Blue, great to hear from you! Yes, I know Summit, Geo, and Bearfoot. Good kids. I like their attitudes, and how they are taking the time to experience and enjoy the trail. I hope to meet you and Little Blue on the trail—or in a trail town.","Vandeventer Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586239,"We woke up to a light blanket of snow covering the ground and a bright, sunny day. The wind, thankfully, was virtually nonexistent, but it was still on the cold side. 
The walk began with a stroll through a farmer’s pasture, then entered the woods. The snow-covered trees sparkled in the bright sunlight, making for a peaceful, quiet walk. It was not a difficult hike, and the snow began disappearing as the day wore on. 
Later in the day, clouds moved in, and the temperature seemed to drop as the day wore on. One particularly interesting view on the trail was the decrepit Queens Knob Shelter, which is no longer maintained nor used. About a mile and a half later, I arrived at the Abingdon Gap Shelter, where we would spend the night. This is the last shelter in Tennessee for northbound hikers. A section hiker was already there, and several other thru-hikers passed through, with two of them deciding to also spend the night at the shelter. 
By evening, it became somewhat chilly, and the gray sky seemed to portend precipitation. The last time I was able to check, rain was predicted to begin about 4:00am and last until mid-day. I told myself that it would be ok, since we’d make it to Damascus the next day, even if it was raining.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586284,"At least we didn’t wake up to rain. Instead, it was snowing. A dusting had turned the ground white, and it was coming right down when I crawled out of bed at 6:30. Thankfully, it didn’t last long, but it was rather chilly. 
We were all excited about making it to Damascus, some ten miles away. Also, in about six miles, we would leave Tennessee behind and enter Virginia. Three states down, and eleven to go. 
It was a fairly easy walk, and I was glad to get moving, if for no other reason than to get warm. Of course there were ups and downs, but nothing dramatic. Part of the trail followed an old railway bed. Curb explained to me a few days ago that portions of the AT use these abandoned railroad beds. I hadn’t realized that, but it explains why sometimes the trail becomes wide and is generally free of rocks and roots. Also, the gradient changes in these sections are gradual. I’ve learned to appreciate these areas, since it’s usually fairly easy walking on them. 
It was a good feeling to leave Tennessee behind, although I have nothing against the state. It’s a sign of progress, an indication that, yes, I am traversing the trail, no matter how slowly. I’ll be walking in Virginia for approximately 500 miles, almost one quarter of the entire trail. Some people apparently get tired of walking in one state and get the “Virginia Blues.” I don’t think that will bother me. Also, I look forward to many of the sights I’ve read and heard about in Virginia, including Grayson Highlands with its wild ponies, the Blue Ridge Mountains, and McAfee Knob. 
I finally began the descent into Damascus, getting glimpses of the town in the valley. Hearing traffic noises always means I’m getting close, and I almost wanted to run down the last section. I then entered the town and walked to the park, where Curb was waiting. We took our pictures under the Damascus AT sign, then walked on into town. Like Hot Springs, the trail goes right through town. I found a great B and B, the Dragonfly Inn, where I’m staying for two nights. I have a private room with my own bathroom and the best shower I’ve used since starting the trail. 
Tomorrow, I’ll take care of the usual town chores, as well as file my taxes. Thanks to my wonderful sister, Darith, for mailing me the tax forms, which were waiting for me at an outfitter. She’s the best sister ever! Also, I picked up my new (free) shoes at the outfitters. My feet will like those when I get back out on the trail.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586343,"It was a typical zero day in Damascus. Laundry, shopping, and eating. This is a good trail town; it reminds me of Hot Springs in certain ways. For one thing, the trail goes right through town. The people are friendly, and they appreciate us hikers. 
In May, a big hiker celebration is held here in Trail Town. Hundreds, or maybe thousands, of current and former hikers gather here to party and revel in trail life. Vendors abound, trying to convince hikers to check out their wares. I doubt I’ll attend, as I hope to be far up the trail by then. I can’t see taking a few days off to shuttle back here to party. Not that I’m against having a good time, but if I’m going to take time off, it won’t be to attend such an event. Geez, I’m sounding like a grumpy old man! 
I must mention that the Dragonfly Inn in Damascus is a great place to stay. It’s very comfortable, has the best showers I’ve experienced in a while, and offers an unbelievably fantastic breakfast, which is included in the price. I highly recommend this place. 
Also, Mojo’s is a good place to eat. Good beer, excellent food, and divine desserts. It’s unfortunate that it closes at 5:00pm, so you have to eat an early dinner. I plan on stopping by on the walk out of town to pick up a sandwich for lunch. 
As I was leaving Mojo’s about 5:00 this evening, I ran into MizMan, whom I haven’t seen since Georgia. He was ahead of me, but has been laid up for s few days with foot problems. He invited me into the hostel where he’s staying, and we had a beer while getting caught up. We’ll probably see each other on the trail, as he’s also hiking out tomorrow. 
Since not much happened today, I thought I’d point out one aspect of the trail I’ve noticed lately; that is, the atmosphere of the trail has changed in the past 100 miles or so. In Georgia, through the Smokies, and for a while after that, I truly felt like I was in a wilderness. In the occasional breaks in the trees when I could get a view of the surrounding area, all I’d see would be more mountains, one after another to the horizon. Now, however, I’m likely to see a valley below, with green pastures, farm houses, or maybe a town. There are a lot more road crossings, and more availability of hostels and resupply. Fir example, near Hampton, as I walked above the valley, I even heard church organ music drifting up to me. I don’t feel so isolated as I did earlier. It’s not better or worse; just different. I know there will be wilderness areas ahead, but for now, it’s rather comforting to know I’m not so alone. 
The weather looks better this week. I guess a lot of the rest of the country has had its share of crappy weather lately, so maybe all of us will get a reprieve from winter. I’m looking forward to getting back on the trail tomorrow, especially if it’s a nice day.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586938,"It was an excellent day for hiking. For one thing, it began with another big, delicious breakfast at Dragonfly Inn. Ralph, the owner, knows his way around the kitchen. Fruit, biscuits, gravy, bacon, scrambled eggs-the list goes on. I ate as much as I could, enjoying every bite. 
Curb and his wife, who was visiting from Nashville, headed off for Walmart in a nearby town, and I finished packing and headed out. I stopped at Mojo’s for a latte, along with a sandwich to go. Packers was there, and we hit the trail about 10:30. 
It was a crisp morning, with the sun shining and a few puffy clouds floating around. By mid-morning, I was down to a tee shirt. The sun felt great on my bare arms. The walk out of town was fairly easy, with gradual uphills. Then it was the normal ups and downs. 
Packers and I were taking a break when Curb caught up with us. His wife had threatened to kidnap him, but I guess he convinced her he needed to continue. It has to be difficult for couples when one is thru-hiking, but I know she supports him. Packers, being from Germany, has to deal with being separated from her family for six months. It’s not always easy, but she’s hanging in there. 
The trail then began a long climb with a lot of switchbacks. I was tooling along on one of the seemingly endless switchbacks, lost in thought, when my right foot stepped too close to the side of the trail. The dirt gave way, and I started to go over the edge and down a steep embankment. Luckily, a small tree was at the edge of the trail, so I grabbed it, spinning around and landing on my back. I took inventory, and discovered I was not hurt. However, I had to unbuckle my pack so I could roll over and get up. That’s when I realized my cap was missing. Looking around, I finally spied it nestled against a tree about 20 feet down the steep bank. Crap! I figured out a way to slide down to it, using trees to keep me from losing control. Climbing back up was even more difficult, but I made it. I reminded myself to be more careful. However, even if I had gone off the edge, it wouldn’t have killed me, but I could have had an unfortunate injury. Oh well. You can’t have an adventure without a little danger now and then. 
We ended up tenting by a pond, a nice spot. The wind was calm, and it was a relatively warm evening. It had been one of those almost perfect hiking days. I hope many more of them are ahead.","Damascus

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586940,"Weather wise, it was another perfect day for hiking. Warm, but not sweltering. The day began with a walk through the green forest, which was peaceful in the early morning. After a while, the AT joined the Virginia Creeper Trail, an old rail bed that has been converted to a biking and walking path. It was easy walking for a couple of miles, then the trails separated, with the AT heading back into the woods. It was normal ups and downs for a while, then the climb to Buzzard Rock began. 
I’ve conquered long uphills, such as Roan Mountain. Other difficult climbs have included Albert and Hump Mountains, and so many others. But the rise to Buzzard Rock had me questioning my ability. The trail generally followed the side of mountain, steeply rising without the benefit of switchbacks. I was really struggling. I began thinking that if I couldn’t handle this, maybe I didn’t have it in me to complete this journey. Finally, I rounded a bend, came to a clearing, and saw the final walk up to the top. Eventually, I made it there, where Curb and Packers were waiting. 
It turns out that it wasn’t just me. Both of my hiking partners had also struggled with the climb. We all felt like it was one of the toughest uphills we had encountered recently. I was glad to hear that others had also been challenged. Maybe I can do this after all. 
While recuperating at Buzzard Rock, a day hiker, who had walked in from the opposite direction, stopped by. He was complimentary of thru hikers, almost in awe of us. We tried to convince him that we’re just regular people doing a long and sometimes difficult task. He had a couple of bottles of water, which he gave to Curb and me. I really needed it, as I was out. I want to thank him for his kindness. People like him make the trek that much less difficult. 
Another person I met on the trail was Odie, a former thru hiker who now compiles and publishes an annual Hiker Yearbook, which contains pictures of all thru hikers, similar to a high school yearbook. I’ve heard him interviewed before, so I felt like I was meeting a celebrity. I hope to be in the 2018 edition of his yearbook. 
After being misled by Guthook, we finally found a place to tent for the night. We were all exhausted, so we went about our evening chores in silence. Everyone was too tired to talk. We had beat the Buzzard, but he had definitely worn us out.","Pond

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586961,"I was excited when I woke up. Today I would stroll through grassy meadows, surrounded by the wild ponies of the Grayson Highlands. Oh, and there would be rainbows and unicorns. I should have learned by now to never assume anything when it comes to the trail. At least the weather was about as perfect as it can get. 
At first it was the normal walk through the woods. Then the climb to Mt. Rogers began. Although it was not a particularly steep or long climb, the trail was riddled with rocks. It made for slow going. No big deal, I thought. Soon there would be ponies and fields of grass. Was I ever wrong. 
 There were some nice views as we neared the top of Mt. Rogers. The AT, though, does not go to the top. A side trail takes you to the summit, but I heard that there’s no view, so opted to skip going to the highest point in Virginia. We stopped at Thomas Knob Shelter for water, then began the descent, which was not easy. 
Rocks everywhere. Big ones, small ones, flat ones, round ones. You get the picture. Rarely did I step on bare ground for a while. It made for a long, slow descent for me. I can’t just go skipping over the rocks, as I’ve seen others do, as I’m too afraid of falling. So I have to consider each step before taking it. I suppose my abilities will improve, but for now, I am probably overly cautious. 
I did pass by a couple of significant features. First, I hit the 500-mile mark. I have walked as many miles on the AT as they drive in Indianapolis on Memorial Day. Almost immediately after that milestone, the trail goes through “Fatman’s Squeeze,” a short cave-type structure. It was actually cool inside, with some ice in places. I guess I’m not that fat, since I did make it through unscathed. 
After that, the trail continued to consist primarily of rocks on the descent, eventually turning into a normal trail. We even saw a couple of ponies in the distance. 
At Massey Gap, our little group had a decision. I wanted to head off the trail to walk the half mile to the Massey Gap parking lot, then catch a ride to a general store and inn. The idea of a burger and coke was luring me in. Also, I needed to do some resupplying, as I hadn’t loaded up for five or six days at Damascus. Curb wanted to continue to the next shelter, another two or three miles. In the end, Packers and I headed for Massey Gap, and Curb continued on. We would try to catch him the next day. 
Packers and I walked to the parking lot, and waited for over an hour for our ride. Finally, the guy showed up and drove us to his place. We had burgers, cokes, etc., then went to the apartment-like facilities. We each had a bedroom, and there was a full kitchen, washer/dryer, and tv. It was a very comfortable place, although it had no cell service. 
After watching CSI, I went to bed and was asleep by 9:30, trying to dream of ponies romping through meadows. Instead, visions of rocks kept interrupting my dreams. At least I had enjoyed a burger and a coke, which helped my mood immensely.","Campsite Near Whitetop Road

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586963,"Packers and I had hoped to be back on the trail by 7:00 or so, in hopes of catching up with Curb. However, the general store and inn doesn’t open until 8:00, so that plan was out the window. Instead, we ate breakfast at the store, bought some food for the trail, and ordered sandwiches to go, which would be our lunch. It was 9:30 by the time we got back to the parking lot, and we still had a half mile to walk to get back to the trail. Oh well, food and a comfortable bed was worth being a bit late getting back to walking. 
As we walked back to the trail, we saw several ponies, including a colt. They ignored us humans; we might as well not been there as far as they were concerned. 
Ok, so there weren’t rainbows and unicorns, but when we rejoined the trail, it was easy walking through grassy meadows for a few miles. It was once again sunny and warm. Also, we did come across some ponies, one of them close enough to touch. He was blocking the trail, completely ignoring us as she nibbled on grass. After taking pictures, we actually had to walk around her to get back to the trail. She wasn’t about to move because of some stupid humans were encroaching upon her territory. 
The trail then headed back into the woods, with the usual ups and downs. Parts of it were again rock-strewn, but I was better today maneuvering them. In fact, I felt stronger today than maybe ever on the trail. Perhaps I am getting those “trail legs” everyone talks about. 
By 4:30, Packers and I were both getting tired, and a two-mile climb faced us. Therefore, we decided to tent (well, she hammocks) near highway 603. There’s a parking lot near here, and a porta-potty across the road. I never thought I’d be excited to see one of them, but the trail does strange things to you. 
Our plan is to get up early and be on the trail by 7:00 or 7:30. If we do that, we may be able to catch Curb, since he usually doesn’t head out until 8:30. Also, it’s supposed to rain and possibly storm tomorrow afternoon, so we’ll see.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586965,"Packers and I hit the trail right at 7:00, just as we’d planned. Later, we both agreed that we like leaving at the crack of dawn. It is nice to be on the trail so early, and to knock out some miles before noon. 
It was an easy two-mile climb, then down a couple of miles to the Hurricane Mountain Shelter, where Curb had stayed the night before. He was already gone, but we figured we’d catch him later. 
Unfortunately, it was cloudy in the early morning, and rain hit in mid-morning. The weather has been so nice lately, I guess we’re due for a change. 
By noon, it was pouring. I met up with Packers at a road crossing, and we decided to go to Trimpi Shelter, about four miles ahead, two miles up, and two down. 
Although the climb up was not difficult, the higher I went, the harder it rained. The wind howled, and occasionally thunder added to the noise. Ridge walking on top was quite a challenge in those conditions, and just as I was cussing my luck, I heard a singing voice. A young man, shirtless and wearing a pack, was approaching from behind, bellowing “Bye, bye, Miss American Pie....” I couldn’t help but laugh. As I stepped aside so he could pass, I joined in on a chorus of the song. Rain, wind, lightning...and two guys acting like idiots, singing a classic song at the tops of their lungs. It doesn’t get much better than that. The kid showed me how to enjoy the trail instead of being in a bad mood. He made my day, and I learned from his youthful exuberance. 
Curb was at the shelter, sitting out of the rain. We’re staying here tonight, then going to Marion tomorrow afternoon. It’s supposed to snow tomorrow, and turn cold tomorrow night, so a motel room may be in my future.
Talking with Curb, we’ve decided to try the early morning getaway in the future. Both of us want to start putting in more miles, and an early start will help. In fact, Packers and I had put in almost nine miles by noon today. Of course, the weather may hinder those plans the next couple of days, but there’s no reason to not take advantage of the early morning hours.","Tent site near highway 603

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586977,"The shelter filled up quickly yesterday afternoon, with soaked hikers coming in asking if there was room. By 5:00pm, wet clothes and gear were hanging everywhere. Every available sleeping spot was taken, making for an unavoidably unpleasant environment. I hope to tent as much as possible in the future, but when the weather is so nasty, shelters provide a way to escape the elements. 
I was the first one up, and began packing as soon as possible. I didn’t eat much breakfast, and Curb, Packers, and I hit the trail about 7:45. It was cold, probably in the 30s. After a short walk through woods, we crossed a farmer’s field, and I thought that this is what I expected in Virginia. However, we soon headed back into the forest. 
It started sleeting and snowing, and kept it up most of the morning. The trail finally rose to a ridge, then followed the ridge line for a few miles. It seemed as if the trail constantly kept rising, as the top of the mountain continued in an uphill slope. Occasionally, it would dip to a saddle, then begin another climb. I felt as if I was walking uphill all the time, although the grade was not especially steep. 
The wind and snow increased at the top, but I was thankful it was not raining. Eventually, the trail took a downward tack, and I was back in normal woods. Yesterday’s rainfall caused the mountain streams to overflow, with many normal trickles becoming rushing creeks. I tried sidestepping them for a while, but eventually gave up, so my shoes, socks, and feet were soaked. Oh well, I thought, I’ll be in Marion early this afternoon, and can get dried out then. 
By early afternoon, we made it to the Mt. Rogers visitor center, and I called Jim Sparks, a local trail angel who would give us a ride to Marion, a few miles away. He showed up a while later, then deposited us at a motel, where I am now. After a shower, I met up with Packers and Curb, and we walked to a Mexican restaurant. Packers walked on to Walmart, but Curb and I feasted for an hour. I also had a couple of margaritas to help me wash down the meal. I ate much more than I normally would have, but I guess that’s the new normal for now. 
Curb and I then took a cab to a laundromat, did laundry, and came back to the motel to rest. Our plan is to head out tomorrow afternoon, after resupplying. It’s still snowing tonight, but the weather is supposed to improve. I’m glad to be out of the elements tonight, as it is cold and snowy. I hope it’s better later on this week.","Trimpi Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587132,"When Curb and I walked the short distance to Walmart this morning to resupply, it felt like a January day in Kansas City. Strong, cold winds blustered under a gray sky, driving the wind chill to an uncomfortable level. I wasn’t sure I wanted to head back out to the trail in those conditions. 
Before leaving town for the trail, we said goodbye to Packers, who has decided to skip this section of the trail and jump ahead to areas she wants to see. She realized she doesn’t have enough time to finish a thru hike before returning to her home in Germany. Instead, she’s going to do some section hikes in places that interest her. She’ll be missed. 
By the time we rode back to the trailhead around noon, the sun was out and the temperature was rising. Once we got back in the woods, it was actually quite comfortable, albeit windy. The forecast had called for gusts near 50 mph, and I think it possibly could have been that high. Even so, I felt warm after I got moving. 
It was a fairly easy walk, mainly on the ridges for most of afternoon. The trail then cut downward, intertwining with a stream several times. I tried to keep my feet dry at each crossing, but the creek was so swollen from the recent rains that it became impossible. For the last three crossings, I rolled up my pants legs and just walked across, soaking my shoes, socks, and feet. I loved it. I had read so many trail journals in the past about such events, and I felt as if I was truly experiencing the AT. Of course, had it been 20 degrees, I would probably have felt differently. But today, I was once again getting into the idea that I’m actually getting to hike this trail. I’m lucky. Many people would love to be able to do what I’m getting to do. I need to appreciate it more than I seem to at times. I’ll try to remind myself of that fact on the down days. 
When I caught up with Curb, he told me he had fallen in the creek at one of the crossings. Thankfully, he wasn’t hurt, but his clothes were wet. Shortly after that, we came to a Settlers Museum, which includes the one-room Lindamood Schoolhouse, built in 1894. It still has the old school desks inside, and is known as a place for trail magic. Although it’s not officially a place to spend the night, hikers do it often, so it is allowed. Since Curb needed to dry his clothes, and because we thought it would be cool to sleep in the old school, we decided to stay here. 
A couple of other young hikers, Spoons and Sunshine, were passing through, and their fathers had met them up the trail. The dads had a car in the museum parking lot, and asked if we’d like a coke. Now that’s a silly question! They gave us cokes and bananas, then passed around a bag of chips. It was a nice way to end the hiking day. But it gets even better. 
Curb and I had decided to eat cold food for supper, since we didn’t want to cook inside the school building, and it was still windy outside. While discussing that, a young lady and her younger brother came to the building. At first, we thought she was going to ask us to leave, but it was actually the opposite. Her name is Moxie, and she did a thru hike last year. Her brother’s name is Sloppy, and they brought us cookies and Gatorade. We talked about the trail for a while, and she told us about a Mexican restaurant a couple of miles up the trail near I-81. (By the way, Curb and I are planning on eating breakfast tomorrow morning at a different restaurant in the area.) We said goodbye to the two, and Curb and I went about making our beds for the night. 
In about 20 minutes, Moxie and Sloppy returned, carrying in food from the Mexican restaurant. We were overwhelmed! So much trail magic today We thanked them profusely, as they are truly trail angels. After they left, we dug into the food. At this rate, I’m going to start gaining weight. What wonderful people. I hope to be able to pay it forward some day by providing trail magic like that. Thanks again, Moxie and Sloppy. 
It’s dark in the schoolhouse now, and Curb is sleeping. I’ll be doing the same soon. After all, I need my rest so I can walk to breakfast tomorrow.","Marion, Virginia

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587510,"It was an easy walk from the old schoolhouse through meadows to a restaurant near I-81, where we ate a hearty breakfast. The sounds of trucks growling and car tires whining echoed through the trees on the way. It’s unusual to be so close to a major highway, and, in a way it seems unnatural. I assume there will be more of the incongruous settings ahead. 
After eating, we crossed under the interstate, then walked through more meadows in the bright sunshine. Eventually, the trail headed into the woods for the normal ups and downs, including a couple of significant climbs. The highlight was passing the quarter way sign. 547 miles completed, and 1641 to go. Piece of cake. 
Curb’s nephew hiked the trail last year, and recommended staying at the Quarter Way Inn. So when we reached the turnoff for that hostel, we walked the half mile down a blacktop to it. Tina, the owner (and former thru-hiker) invited us in and showed us around. It’s a refurbished farmhouse that was built in 1910, and the farm was originally established in the late 1700s. It’s a beautiful place, and the setting is absolutely idyllic, overlooking green pastures. After taking a shower, I sat on a rocking chair on the front porch and took a short nap in the warm country air. It was a truly peaceful late afternoon. That night I slept better than I have for a long time.","Lindamood Schoolhouse

Promptly at 7:00, Curb and I sat down to one of the most wonderful meals I’ve eaten on quite some time. Egg frittatas, fresh-baked cheese biscuits, gravy, bacon, fruit...well, you get the picture. It was all freshly made with local ingredients when possible. What a great way to start the hiking day. 
Unfortunately, it was cloudy and windy all day, and the temperature probably stayed in the 40s. At first, the trail once again took us through green meadows, and we passed by an old sawmill along the way. Then it was into the woods for the usual. 
The last five miles, though, were all uphill for a 2100-feet climb. No one part was too difficult, but I was tired by the time I reached Chestnut Knob Shelter. But it was cold and windy, so I was glad to be there. 
This is the first shelter I’ve encountered that actually has four walls with a door (not counting the Newfound Gap bathroom.) It used to be the fire warden’s cabin. It was full when I arrived, so I ended up sleeping on the floor, but that turned out to be ok, even though I was not happy about it at first. At least I was out of the cold wind, and I actually slept quite well. 
The shelter overlooks a geological formation called Burke’s Garden, which is an eight-by-four mile valley caused by a limestone sinkhole. In the lush green valley are mainly farms, some of which have been in the same family for many generations. It was quite a sight to look down into this unusual scenery.
At night, I could see a few lights sprinkled in the valley below, and the moonless sky was brilliant with stars. Even though it was cold, I took in the exceptional view. Besides, what else is there to do at 2:00am when you’re relieving yourself?","Quarter Way Inn

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587528,"It was cold as we packed up in the morning. I’d classify it as an SBF 8 day. More on that later. 
It was an easy walk on the rim of Burke’s Garden, with the occasional forays into the woods. After about six miles, we came to a road crossing. Curb had set up a shuttle for him to go to the post office in Bland, VA, to pick up a package. Since that would take a couple of hours, I opted to catch a ride with a trail angel to go to an Amish restaurant in Burke’s Garden. (I reimbursed the guy for gas and his time.) 
I felt lucky to actually get to ride into the amazing valley. The guy told me some of the history of the area, which includes families who have lived in there for several generations, with farms handed down throughout the centuries. It was a bucolic scene, with farmhouses, silos, and cattle in rolling green pastures. It was entirely surrounded by mountains, with one main road (from what I could tell) making a loop around the valley. 
At the restaurant, I had a pulled pork bbq sandwich with a couple of cokes. I also picked up a few food items for the trail. On the ride back to the top, the driver took me on around the loop, so I got a tour of the area. It’s definitely some place I’d like to visit again when I have more time. I felt lucky to get to see it, since I imagine most hikers don’t get that chance. 
Curb was waiting when I got back to the trailhead, and we walked on to Jenkin’s Shelter, where we tented for the night. 
After setting up our tents, a couple of other hikers stopped by the shelter to eat dinner before heading on for a few more miles. I was talking with them, and asked what their names were. The first guy, a witty fellow, was Professor.  The younger man introduced himself as Little Blue. I started laughing and told him my name. I finally met Little Blue! We joked around a bit, and realized we know a lot of the same people. As he headed back to the trail, I told him to say “hi” to his Mom for me. So, Mana Blue, I have met the fine young man who is your son. It was an honor. 
As for the SBF 8 classification I mentioned earlier, I have developed a way to specify how cold it is. It’s the Snickers Bite Factor, and I think it helps explain how cold it is, instead of just using temperatures. 
Assume it’s a warm summer day, and you unwrap a Snickers bar and bite into it. Maybe you even get some melted chocolate on your fingers. That would be an SBF 1 day, which is perfection. On the other hand, let’s say you unwrap a Snickers (with numb fingers) and try to bite into it, but it’s impossible. All you can do is gnaw on the end of it. That would be an SBF 10 day, which is the worst. Yes, I’ve experienced a couple of SBF 10 days on this journey. An SBF 8 day would be when you have to hold the end of the bar in your teeth and bend the other end up and down. After a few repetitions, the end of the bar breaks off into your mouth, where you have to wallow it around a bit to warm it up before you can actually begin chewing. The scale goes from 1 to 10, depending upon how difficult it is to eat the Snickers. So there you have it: a new way to classify the misery of coldness. I’m sure they’ll be using it in weather forecasts in the future, along with wind chill factors. 
Here’s hoping the rest of the Spring and Summer are SBF 1 days, although I know we won’t be so lucky.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

The walk was also quite easy as it was generally on old railroad beds, which are usually wide and smooth with gently sloping inclines. 
I was looking forward to some real food at Brushy Mountain Outpost, a small store just off the trail near Bland, where I arrived about 2:20 in the afternoon. It turns out the place closes at 2:00. However, Curb saved the day when he arrived there shortly after 2:00. The door was locked for him, but the owner was nice enough to reopen for us. They even fired up the grill and made us a couple of hamburgers each. We were very appreciative that they would do that for us. A young lady named Patches, whom I’ve met before, also stopped in for some food. We all felt lucky that they were kind enough to open up the place for us. 
The trail followed a road downhill from the Outpost, then dodged into the woods for the only climb of the day. We came to Helvey’s Mill Shelter later in the afternoon, and, even though the shelter is a good quarter of a mile off the trail, we decided to go to it. Sunshine, a young lady we’d met before was there, and all of us decided to tent for the night near the shelter.

We also did some ridge walking, but nothing difficult. 
The highlight of the day was crossing the 600-mile mark. It’s been slow progress, but I’m picking up the pace. Before long, I’ll be one third the way on this journey. 
Towards late afternoon, we came to a road crossing and enjoyed some trail magic, including cookies, water, and bananas. We then road walked down to a gas station/convenience store called Trent’s Grocery. They had a grill, but I didn’t feel like another hamburger, so I ordered a balogna and cheese sandwich with mayo and tomato, which I ate along with two cokes. I figured up it had probably been 50 years since I’d eaten that concoction, and it tasted great. 
The place also had a room in back with two bunks and a bathroom, so Curb and I rented it for the night. It was simple, but comfortable.

The first several miles were an easy walk through a valley where there were deciduous tree forests, groves of spruce trees, and dark, mysterious rhododendron tunnels. After stopping at a shelter for a quick lunch, it was an uphill climb, then ridge walking for a while. The trail turned into a minefield of rocks just as the rain began, which, of course, made for a treacherous obstacle course. A cold wind also picked up, making for an unpleasant walk. 
Our destination for the day was Wood’s Hole Hostel, another iconic location along the trail. This hostel is one of the oldest, having been around since 1986. It is now run by Neville, the granddaughter of the couple who founded the place. Curb and I were lucky enough to get a room in the main house, which is the original log cabin. 
It was a half-mile walk from the trail, and by the time I got there, I was soaked through and cold. Neville was so nice, directing me to the room. Curb, of course, had been there a while, since he walks faster than I. After a hot shower, I relaxed for a bit, petting one of the family dogs and enjoying a cup of coffee. 
Dinner was served at 7:00, and before eating, the 15 or so hikers staying there each introduced ourselves and stated something for which we are thankful. I said I was grateful for trail magic, which elicited a few laughs. The food was excellent: a salad with homemade dressing, followed by vegetable beef soup with canned vegetables grown on the farm, and freshly baked bread. It was a wholesome meal that helped take the chill out of my bones. 
The atmosphere of Wood’s Hole is of a friendly, wholesome, organic place. It’s located in a beautiful location in the country, and Neville and her husband are doing everything to make it a nurturing temporary home for hikers. I recommend it to anyone who happens to be passing through. 
That night I could hear the rain falling and the wind blowing as I snuggled in the comfortable bed complete with sheets and blankets. (A lot of hostels only provide a mattress and pillow, so you have to use your sleeping bag.) One time, while crawling back into bed after using the bathroom, I automatically reached down to zip up my bag. I was confused when I couldn’t find the zipper.

It was raining and chilly when we lit out. First was a climb out of the valley, and the trail was often a stream of water. After a while, I didn’t even try to sidestep the water since my feet and shoes were soaked. Then came a long walk along a ridge line. By noon, the rain had stopped, but a cool wind picked up at the higher elevation. Since I was wet, even wearing rain gear, I felt rather miserable. Remembering the lesson the shirtless young man taught me a few days ago, I began singing “Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...” to myself. It’s my go-to song when things are generally crappy, and remembering the guy singing it in the rain helps put me in the right frame of mind. 
The ridge line seemed to go on forever, and parts of it were covered in rocks. Shortly after beginning the long descent into Pearisburg, I heard two hikers talking behind me, one of whom turned out to be Little Blue. We ended up at a road, where Curb was patiently waiting. We then called the hostel for a shuttle, and it felt good to crawl into the heated van when it arrived a short while later. 
We checked in, and I ended up on an upper bunk, which is a pain for me, since I have to get up two or three times in the night. But at least it was warm. After a shower, I felt a lot better. Curb and I walked up to a Mexican restaurant for some good food and a couple of beers. When we returned to the hostel, the staff had a roaring bonfire going. A group of about a dozen hikers sat around sipping beers and talking, mainly about the trail.

I didn’t do a whole lot except for trips to the Chinese buffet for lunch and the Mexican restaurant for dinner. I also went to the grocery store to resupply. It dripped rain off and on, so not being out in it all day long was a luxury. 
We’re heading out in the morning, but it may be a short day. At least the weather looks to be good for the next several days. The next zero will be in Daleville, about a hundred miles up the trail. Hopefully, we can resupply before then, but I think I have enough food to last that long. 
Kathi, you asked about shuttle services and where I get my information about them. I usually depend upon the Guthook app for that kind of info. Oftentimes, the user comment section mentions a driver and provides a phone number. The AWOL guidebook also lists such services. You would have to contact them about getting listed. Also, some shuttle services leave cards in shelters and at hostels. And sometimes, it’s just word of mouth from other hikers. I know some shuttle drivers are extremely busy during the season. On the other hand, you have to put up with smelly, dirty, and maybe wet and muddy hikers riding in your vehicle. Some drivers have seat covers to help protect their vehicles.

The first mile or so was fairly easy as part of the path was along the edge of Pearisburg. Then began a two-mile climb followed by a downhill followed by a three-mile climb to the shelter. Neither ascent was particularly difficult, but it was uphill all the way. It was warm and sunny, making for an enjoyable day. 
When I reached the shelter at the ridge line, we decided to stop for the day, even though we hadn’t gone many miles. Rain was supposed to start around 5:00 and continue all night, so a shelter seemed like a good option. 
It appears the views from this ridge line will be impressive tomorrow as we’ll be walking through some meadows. It would be nice to see some vistas unobstructed by trees. 
One thing I noticed about today is that I must have my trail legs. It used to be that I’d have to stop to rest every 50 steps or so when ascending. Now I can walk an hour or more uphill without stopping, unless I need to take a drink or relieve myself. I suppose if it had steeper I might not have felt so strong, but it was a good feeling to be able to continue without stopping every few minutes.

However, it left a thick blanket of fog in its wake, obscuring the expected views along the ridge line. To make matters worse, the trail was littered with rocks in this section. It seems as if Virginia certainly has its share of rocks.
I forgot to mention yesterday that when I crossed a gravel road near this section, a forest ranger wearing military style garb and carrying a side arm got out of his vehicle to talk with me, as he had all hikers. He stated that I was entering the right-of-way for a pipeline that was being constructed in the area, and that basically I should stay on the trail for the next few miles, although it was ok to stop at the shelter. Apparently, the pipeline has stirred up controversy, and protesters are known to be in the area. 
Anyway, about mid-morning today, I came to a spot that had protest signs lying on the ground near the trail. I then noticed a couple of large tents about 200 feet to my left. I thought maybe the protesters were there, so I nonchalantly walked over to check it out. Instead of protesters, I found another armed ranger, who politely informed me that I was on the pipeline right-of-way. Oops! We talked a bit, but it was obvious he didn’t want me there, so I said goodbye and returned to the trail. I guess I’m lucky for not getting arrested. 
A couple of four-wheelers had also been by the tents, and the rangers had done a good job of turning the trail into a muddy roadway for maybe a half mile. It made for difficult walking, and I was glad when the trail veered off into the woods. 
After that, it was the normal ups and downs until the final climb up to the shelter. Everyone in camp complained about it. Fortunately, there was room in the shelter for me. I was so exhausted that I didn’t want to go to the effort to pitch my tent.","Rice Field Shelter

For the past few of weeks, I had been having pain from a medical condition. I had this condition before heading to the trail, but walking so many miles with a pack had obviously made it worse.

Also, there is nothing to do to stop the pain except for an operation, which would lay me up for several weeks. Therefore, I have had to make the difficult decision to end my journey. It has not been easy, and I often second guess myself, but the grownup in me knows it’s the right decision. 
I apologize to all of you who have been reading my journal and encouraging me, from Kathi in NH to a guy in Germany to a young boy in WI, as well as my family and friends. I feel as if I’ve let you down. I hope you can understand that I want to continue, but just can’t do it. 
I’d like to thank Steve Adams, Scott and Ariane, Nate Stockton, and John Skeezix for all their encouragement and advice. I never could have made it this far without your help. 
Also, thanks to Okie, Camo, and Curb for helping me on the trail. When I got down, you guys picked me up and reminded me that we were doing something most people just dream about. There’s a kinship that develops among fellow hikers, since we’re all going through the same difficulties and undergoing the same unbelievable experiences. Best of luck to all of you. 
In 88 days, I walked 676.8 miles. While not impressive compared to a thru-hike, I am proud that I made it that far. I’ll never know the euphoria of completing a thru-hike, but sometimes you have to be satisfied with at least trying even if you don’t succeed. 
Also, I lost 3 toenails, fell 13 times, and shed 16 pounds of body weight. I only had one small blister on my foot, and went through 3 pairs of shoes. 
So now I’ll rent a car and head down to Atlanta to pick up my truck and camper, my home. But before heading out, I’m going to buy a cooler and fill it up with ice cold cokes and water, pick up a bunch of candy bars and other goodies, and head out to a trailhead to do some trail magic. It’s the least I can do.  
I’ll continue to have adventures, living on the road and in the boonies in my camper. After being around civilization for a couple of days, I’m ready to get back to the outdoors and away from all the noise and distractions of normal life, albeit in a mobile home instead of walking in the wilderness and sleeping in a tent or shelter. If you wish to follow me, I have a page on fb called “The Adventures of Vagabond Jack.” 
I’ve rambled on too long in this post. It’s time to get moving and head on down the road. 
Remember, hike your own hike.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592836,"I’m heading back to the trail! At least that’s my plan. I’m excited about the opportunity to finish the AT later this year. 
When I left the trail, I had incorrectly assumed that surgery would leave me incapacitated for two or three months. However, I had laparoscopic surgery last week, and the only restriction is to not lift more than 25 pounds for three weeks. Recovery is going well, thanks to my sister and brother-in-law who pampered me after the operation. 
With that in mind, I hope to return to the trail sometime in July, although if I’m not ready until August, that’s fine with me. I’m going to have to rearrange my route, since I would not make it to Mt. Katahdin before it closes in October if I just picked in Virginia and kept walking north. Instead, I’ll start in the north and head south to complete the trek. 
When I return, here’s my tentative plan:

Travel to a point on the trail that’s approximately 100 miles north of where Curb, my hiking buddy, is located at that time. 
Begin hiking north from that point. Since it will take me a while to get back up to speed, Curb will catch up with me in a couple of weeks. 
Continue walking with Curb northbound and summit Mt. Katahdin with him as he completes his hike. It will be an honor to be with him at this momentous occasion. 
Travel south to the point that was 100 miles north of Curb’s location. 
Begin walking south until I get to Dalesville, VA, approximately 52 miles north of VA Route 42, where I left the trail in April.
Shuttle to VA Route 42 and walk north to McAfee Knob, approximately 36 miles. 
Walk south from McAfee Knob to the nearest road, then shuttle back to Dalesville. 
Walk south to finish my trek at McAfee Knob. As Steve Adams told me, if I can’t compete my journey at Mt. Katahdin, McAfee Knob would be an “awesome place to finish.” 

It will probably be November by the time I complete the trek, and I may have to deal with cold weather again, but that’s ok with me. I’m just grateful for the opportunity to have a chance to complete my 2018 thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. It won’t be a traditional route, but that doesn’t bother me. 
I’ll post occasional updates before I head back out there, and once I begin again, I’ll try to post daily updates. Until then, thanks for all the encouraging comments, and I hope you’ll join me as I try to complete my trek.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595523,"As many of you probably know, most movies, plays, TV shows, etc. consist of three parts or acts. The first act deals with introducing the characters, establishing the setting, and the like. The protagonist is usually presented with a problem to be overcome, and in the second act, usually the longest, the protagonist must overcome obstacles and go through changes to deal with the problem. The final act reaches the climax where, we hope, the protagonist succeeds. Although this description is simplified, it reflects how I have been viewing my AT journey. In the first act, I was confronted with many difficulties, culminating in me getting off the trail for surgery. As I head back out there, I’ll be in Act II, and will have to deal with overcoming more obstacles, including getting back into trail shape. In Act III, I’ll reach the climax, which, of course, is finally completing my trek. Let’s hope it’s a comedy, not a tragedy. In any case, it will be an adventure. 
I feel like I’m fully recovered from my surgery and am anxious to get back to the trail. It will probably be the second week of July before I do so. I’m getting things together, and, while not nearly as stressful as it was in January, I’m still apprehensive about my abilities to do the trail. For one thing, I’ve been lazy and haven’t been working nearly as hard as I should to prepare. Oh well, hiking all day for a couple of weeks should do the trick. 
I’ve enjoyed spending time with family and friends during the hiatus. In addition to attending my niece’s wedding, I house sat for my sister and brother-in-law for a few days. Part of my duties included feeding and watering Don’s six cows. Even though I grew up on a farm, I hadn’t done chores in almost 50 years. It was fun, and it sure brought back childhood memories. 
I’ll have more details about my plans as the time approaches, but I still plan on jumping back on the trail ahead of Curb and letting him catch up to me. I assume he’ll be in New York or north of there by the time I restart. 
I’ve added a few items to take with me, including a camera (Sony a6000 for those of you who care), a chest pack that attaches to my backpack, a lightweight Bluetooth keyboard, which will make writing my journal so much easier, and Skinner camp shoes, which will replace my crocs. Although all this may add a bit of weight to my load, getting rid of the crocs should just about make up for it. 
Thanks again for all the comments. They are always appreciated. 
Hungry Cat, I’ll definitely try to stay at the Upper Goose Pond Cabin shelter in MA. Sounds like a great place. 
Sandra, I hope I run into the Blue Crew. Tell them I said hi, and to keep walking!
Packers, it’s great to hear from you! I’ll bet your daughter was glad to see you. Curb was doing well the last time I checked. Still marching on like he always does. Have fun hiking in Sweden.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595792,"Yesterday my siblings and I attended an event in Springfield, IL, that honored our late father. Dad, along with my brother Jerry, was involved in the Poland China purebred hog association for about 50 years. Dad and Jerry were influential in the development of the breed, winning many national awards. (Jerry continues to carry on the tradition.)
Earlier this year, the association decided to create a traveling trophy for each year’s champion boar. On the trophy would be a statue of someone, along with one of their champion boars. The board voted unanimously for Dad. 
At the hog show yesterday, the trophy was unveiled in a ceremony. It was quite emotional for me and my family. Dad would have been so proud, but humbled. He deserves this honor. He worked hard all his life, and was a friend to everyone who knew him.
I know this doesn’t relate to hiking the AT, but had I still been on the trail, I would have taken a few days off to attend the event. I wouldn’t have missed it for anything.

I should be working out more than I am, but the trail will get me in shape whether I want to be or not. 
For those of you who don’t know, last year I sold my house and most possessions, then bought a truck and camper, pictured above. It is now my home, and, once I complete the trail, I plan on traveling throughout the US and living in my rig for the foreseeable future, thus the name “Vagabond Jack.” A big thanks to my nephew Bob for providing covered storage for my home while I’m on the trail. Bob not only reads my journal, but he also follows several other hikers. I don’t know if I can ever talk him into hiking the AT, but he’s been a big supporter of my journey.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596986,"I’m back on the trail! And it’s wonderful. Stepping into the woods at the trailhead in Dalton, MA was like meeting an old friend. I was a bit apprehensive, but excited to spend time with my old buddy. After a while, it was like I’d never left. But I was starting to worry in that first hour. My legs were tight, and I wondered if I’d be able to continue. However, my legs eventually loosened, allowing me to get into a rhythm. 
It helped that the trail was not difficult in that section. Sure, there were ups and downs, but nothing dramatic or taxing. The cool weather helped a lot also. It may have hit 80, but generally it was quite comfortable. The forest was beautiful, dark and green, with pine-scented air. The highlights of the day were Gore Pond and Cheshire Cobble, with its view of the town of Cheshire in the valley below. 
I ended up in Cheshire, where I found a gas station and bought a coke. After taking a break, I hoofed it to St. Mary’s Church. The church is hiker-friendly, providing a place to get out of the heat, charge your phone, and use the bathroom. Although the doors lock at 7:00, tenting is allowed on the side lawn. Several hikers are camped here tonight. In the morning, I’ll swing by Dunkin’ Donuts for breakfast, before taking on Mt Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts. 
To get to to Dalton, I took Amtrak from Kansas City, arriving on Wednesday the 11th. I enjoyed riding the train, especially spending the night in a sleeper car. If you’re not on a tight schedule, Amtrak is the way to go. 
My friends Schuyler and Jane, who live in Hartford, picked me up at the train station and took me to my hotel. We then went out for a couple of beers and dinner. Jane even made me a care package for the trail. It was great spending time with them. 
Hopefully, I won’t be too sore tomorrow. Maybe I can put in a few more miles. Curb is about 70 miles south of me, so maybe I can get back in shape before he catches up.","Dalton, MA

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597410,"After a Dunkin’ Donuts breakfast, I headed up the trail out of Cheshire. It took me a while to get warmed up on the uphill slope. Though not necessarily a difficult climb, it was an hour before my legs started moving more smoothly. 
It was a beautiful walk in dense woods, albeit a bit humid. I trudged along, taking frequent short breaks, planning on stopping at a shelter for lunch and to get water. However, about 15 minutes away from the shelter, I hit a wall. I didn’t want to stop so close to my lunch destination, but did so anyway, taking 15 minutes to eat an energy bar and down some water. Feeling better, I made my way to the shelter. 
Unfortunately, the shelter was located a good tenth of a mile off the trail, and the water source was another long walk away from the shelter. After getting water, I sat at the shelter, relaxing in the sun and eating lunch. I took off my shoes and socks to air out my feet. I spent more than an hour there before heading back to the trail. 
About three miles past the shelter was the summit of Mt. Greylock, the highest place in Massachusetts, about 3500 feet. It was slow going the last mile, even though it wasn’t an especially steep climb. Many day hikers were on the trail since the peak is accessible by car. At the top is a restaurant and small shop, where I got a cola and water. As I relaxed on a bench, a tourist walked by wearing a KC Royals t-shirt. I said “Go Royals!” We talked a bit, and it turned out he’s from St. Joe, MO. Also, he knows several people from my home town, Oregon, MO. I guess it is a small world. 
I then headed down from Mt. Greylock to a shelter about three miles away. Unfortunately, I was racing against sundown, as I didn’t want to walk in the dark. Also, unfortunately, the downhill was rather steep and difficult, with the trail often consisting of large rocks. With my short legs, I have to go slow on terrain like this. However, I rushed to get down to the shelter. I finally made it, about a half hour before sunset. A group of young people with adult supervisors were tenting, so I had the shelter to myself. I was so bushed, I ate a cold dinner and turned in by 9:00.","Cheshire, MA

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597432,"I headed out early from the shelter and walked down to North Adams, MA, where John Skeezix was waiting for me. He had driven from his home in eastern Massachusetts, and was there to help me slack pack for the rest of the day. John did a thru hike in 2003, and organizes the “Fat Guys” section hikes every year. Last year I participated, walking with John and five others through part of the Smokies. It was my first exposure to the Trail, and John helped me learn about what it takes to hike long distances. John also organizes a “hiker feed” on Labor Day weekend in Maine. He is a true Trail angel. 
After getting a quick bite to eat, John drove me to a road crossing in Vermont. He then loaned me a day pack, in which I carried water bottles and filter, some energy bars, and my rain jacket. He took my heavy pack back to North Adams while I walked south with a 2-pound pack and met him again in town. It’s my first slack packing experience, and it’s wonderful. It felt as if I had no weight at all on my back. Also, while he was in town, John secured two motel rooms, which was not easy. Most rooms in town were gone, so he had to go to a neighboring town to find them. 
I was cruising along until I came to a section of large rocks that topped a hill and continued down. It took me quite a while to negotiate the obstacles, especially on the downhill side where it felt as if I was going down a vertical wall. Fortunately, the rocks soon gave away to a normal trail, and I booked on down the hill to meet John. 
After a shower at the motel, I rode with John to a local restaurant. We then went back to our rooms and sat outside drinking beer and talking about the trail until dark. John had plenty of stories about his thru hike, and I told a few of mine. He really went out of his way to help me, and I appreciate it. Also, thanks to his wife and daughter, whose Trail name is Rock Hopping Bunny, for giving up John for the weekend so he could help me.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

After our goodbyes, I started walking north for my first full day in Vermont. The trail wasn’t particularly difficult, and I passed a couple of beaver ponds. I ate lunch sitting on one of the dams, but didn’t see a beaver. Several section and day hikers passed me, as did a few thru hikers. 
With the humidity in the mid-90s and an 85 degree temperature, it was quite muggy. I took frequent breaks to rest my legs and down water. About 4:30 I arrived at the Congdon Shelter, which is right on the trail. Bob, a section hiker was resting in his hammock, and RX, a thru hiker was talking with him. I decided to spend the night there, and dropped my pack in the shelter. The nearby water source was dry, so I had to walk a half mile back down the trail to get water. At least I didn’t have to carry my pack on the water run. 
Bob built a huge campfire, so we sat around until sundown talking. RX is a young pharmacy student from Canada, and it was quite enjoyable talking with her. Finally, as darkness set in, we all retreated to our sleeping bags for the night. I knew I’d have a short walk the next day into the town of Bennington.","County Road, VT (mile 1600.5)

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597470,"I woke up early and was back on the trail by 7:00. I only had a bit over four miles to go down to the parking lot near Bennington, VT. On the Guthook app, I saw that a motel called Catamount would pick me up at the parking lot and drive me the five miles into Bennington. However, since there’s no signal at the parking lot, I needed to call when I got to Harmon Hill to set up the shuttle to the motel. 
A lot of dew-covered underbrush crowded the trail, so my legs were wet in the early morning. Also, there were many areas where I had to walk on boards erected above the mud and muck below. I’m thankful for the trail maintainers who placed the boardwalks, else it would have otherwise been an unpleasant walk. 
I reached Harmon Hill, where I called the motel. He said he’d be there in 70 minutes to pick me up. I explained that I’m old and slow, so he agreed to to be at the parking lot in about two hours. I used almost all that time that make it down the hill. 
The downhill slope was littered with large rocks. I had to carefully consider each step, so it was extremely slow going. I expected the trail to even out and be a simple walk as I neared the parking lot, but the rocks covered the trail until the end. I had only 15 minutes to spare when I was finally down. 
The motel owner picked me up and I checked in. After a shower, I paid $4 for my clothes to be laundered. I then walked to the next-door gas station for a coke and junk food. Since it was due to rain all day the next day, I decided to take a zero day on Tuesday. A lot of other hikers had the same idea, so the motel filled up quickly.

I then worked on getting my gear ready for the trail. 
This evening I walked to a brew pub and had couple of excellent ales along with the best beef tacos I’ve ever experienced. I took it easy in the evening, watching tv and finishing preparing my gear. I had talked with the bartender at the pub, noting that tomorrow at this time I’d be remembering the great meal and beer. Oh well, in a few days I can get back to civilization for a short time. Until then, I’ll be negotiating the trail and surviving in the woods. 
 
Curb texted me tonight, and he’s about 40 miles south of me. I hope I can get my trail legs back before he catches up. It’ll be great to see him again, but I want to make sure I’m in shape so I don’t slow him down. At any rate, tomorrow I’ll be back at it.","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597571,"Today the AT passed through the Glastenbury Wilderness in the Green Mountains of Vermont. Actually, the AT piggybacks on the Vermont Long Trail in this section. The Long Trail is the first of its kind in the country, and goes through Vermont from the Massachusetts border to the Canadian border. At some point, the AT veers to the east to eventually reach New Hampshire. 
At any rate, the Glastenbury Wilderness is exceptional. You really feel as if you’re walking through a true wilderness with its lush green flora and total quiet. The trail isn’t even maintained as much as it normally is. Instead of dead trees on the trail being removed or having a chunk cut out to walk through, as is normal, you have to step over or walk around them. There are no gravel roads intersecting the trail. As one commenter noted in the Guthook app, it’s like being in Jurassic Park. 
The terrain was generally uphill most of the day, but nothing too strenuous. It ended with a climb to the Goddard Shelter, which is only .3 mile from the top of Glastenbury Mountain. A lookout tower is perched atop the mountain, and I may climb it early tomorrow morning. I guess it offers some nice vistas, which are somewhat rare since the trees have so much foliage and I’m not above tree level. 
The weather was about perfect today, and by 6:00 it was in the low 60s. It’s supposed to be in the 30s tonight, which should make for good sleeping weather. My luck is holding out for now, as I believe it’s supposed to remain cool and dry for the next few days.

It was slow going for much of today because of the rocks, interspersed with areas of mud. There were a few areas of the trail that actually resembled a trail, but those areas were few and far between. 
The morning began with a short climb to Glastenbury Mountain, which was topped with an observation tower. I dropped my pack and climbed the 66 steps to the top, despite my fear of heights. It was worth the climb. Instead of being in dense woods without much of a view, which is beautiful in its own right, I was above the trees with 360 degree views of the surrounding area. It was quite a sight in the early morning sun. I’m glad I made the trip. 
The rest of the day was fairly easy, except for the rocks and mud, of course. I stopped at Kid Gore Shelter for lunch, then trudged in to Story Spring Shelter, where I’m tenting for the night. A couple of other thru hikers from upstate New York are also here, and we had a good conversation during dinner.

Of course, there were rocks and mud. Some patches of mud were so wide that I had no choice but to tromp through them. I guess that’s why some people refer to the state as “Vermud.” 
It was a climb of about 1700 feet over four miles to reach the summit of Stratton Mountain, and I was tired when I finally reached the top. At least the weather cooperated, with temperatures in the 70s and a cool breeze on top of the mountain. Once again, I forced myself to climb the observation tower for fantastic views of the area, including views of mountains in four states: Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. 
I then descended and headed for Stratton Pond Shelter. It’s a large shelter, and was fairly crowded with AT and Long Trail hikers. The day before I had met The Anchor and Water Boy, two young guys who are thru-hiking the 276 mile Long Trail. We had stimulating conversations about literature, including talking about authors such as John Barth. They’re great guys, and I know they’ll make it to the Canadian border as they complete the Long Trail. 
About a quarter of a mile from the shelter is Stratton Pond. Several of us made the short trip to the pond to watch the sunset. It was an awe-inspiring moment for all of us, and for several minutes there wasn’t much conversation as we enjoyed the moment.

There were a lot of day hikers, since it was a beautiful Saturday and with the trail being easily accessible from the parking lot. I took my time, taking frequent breaks and enjoying the lush forest and gentle breezes. 
As I reached the parking lot, a couple of day hikers were kind enough to give me a ride to my motel. They have hiked long sections of the Pacific Crest Trail in previous years, so didn’t mind my smelly and dirty body riding in their vehicle. 
All the hostels in town were at full occupancy, as were most motels. This is a popular place this time of year. I guess it’s also a busy place in winter due to the nearby ski slopes. At any rate, earlier in the day I had made a reservation at a motel that is, unfortunately, not near the center of town. No restaurants or other services are within easy walking distance. After checking in and getting a shower, I paid the motel owner to give me a ride to a steak and beer restaurant, where I enjoyed a good meal and a couple of ales.

I plan to restart my hike in southern Virginia where my trek ended last April. I should begin in the first week of March, depending upon weather and logistics. I’ll then walk north to Katahdin. After that, depending upon how I feel physically and mentally, I may head back down to Virginia and walk south to Springer, thus completing a flip-flop thru-hike. If I decide I’ve had enough after Katahdin, I’ll be satisfied, but a bit disappointed, having completed two long section hikes. At any rate, I’m getting excited about returning to the Trail. 
I’ve had a few adventures since leaving the trail, including meeting Curb in Maine and being there when he summited Katahdin. By the way, he summitted with Old Scout, if you happened to follow his journey. It was amazing seeing Katahdin from a distance and to experience Curb’s excitement as he completed the long, arduous trek. I then drove Curb and his wife, who had come to Maine to be there when he finished, to their beautiful home outside Nashville. 
I’m working on getting my stuff together and making arrangements for storage of my “house.” I’m also waiting for my backpack to be returned from ZPacks, since I had to send it in for repairs. While backpacking in Arkansas last fall, one of my shoulder straps broke, so I mailed the pack to the company to get fixed. I also replaced my Big Agnes tent with a ZPacks tent, thus shaving two or three pounds off my weight. When I hit the trail in Arkansas, my pack weighed 21 pounds, including four days of food and a liter of water. I can live with that.

After catching a ride to the Trail near Blacksburg, I’ll begin trudging northward. I’m sure I’ll be questioning my sanity within the first hour, but I’ll continue putting one foot in front of the other. 
I’m not sure how far I’ll go tomorrow. There’s a shelter about four miles from my starting point, and another one at the 10-mile mark. With luck, I’ll feel up for the farther shelter, but I’ll play it by ear. I’m definitely not in trail shape, so it will be slow going. 
I’m not as nervous as I was when I started last year, but I’ve had a hard time coming to grips with the idea of walking for days on end. I’m sure when I get out there and meet other hikers, I’ll be fine. 
Thanks again for all the support.

The brisk mountain air greeted me as I said goodbye to the UBER driver and finally walked across Highway 42 to restart my Appalachian Trail journey. It was nice to be back in the woods and on trail. 
After walking through some pastures and back into the woods, the climb up Sinking Creek Mountain began. I felt strong despite being out of hiking shape. I made steady progress even though I had to stop often to catch my breath. I finally made it to the top. 
Now I faced a dilemma. The first shelter was only four miles from my starting point. The next shelter was ten miles. Even though I prefer to do only six or eight miles for the first few days, I didn’t want to stop after only four miles, especially since it was only noon. I decided to go to the far shelter. 
However, I needed water, and the only water on this section was at the first shelter, so I’d stop there to get water. Except that shelter was .4 mile off the trail, down a steep incline. I had no choice. So I hiked down the mountainside. I ended up eating lunch at the shelter as well as getting water. 
Then I had to climb back to the trail. I hated hiking almost a mile for water, but I had no choice. 
I still felt strong, thinking I should easily be able to knock off six miles. But the trail became a difficult series of rock ledges including large boulders I had to scramble up and over. It was slow going, and I was getting weaker after every rock section. 
With only a mile to go, I was in a lot of pain, especially my hips and back. By the time I stumbled into the shelter, I’m sure I looked like someone who needs a walker. I was in bad shape. 
I set up in the shelter; I was too exhausted and sore to set up a tent. I had overdone it the first day back. Had it been easy trail walking, I might have been ok. But the slow going over the rocks took it out of me. 
I decided to sleep in the next morning, then walk only about two and a half miles to a camping site before the climb up Brush Mountain. 
About sundown a through hiker on his third AT through hike stopped at the shelter for the night. We talked a bit, then he retreated to his tent. I crawled into the shelter for a much-needed sleep. 
I forgot to mention that earlier that day I had passed by cairns or large rock piles on Sinking Creek Mountain. They were supposedly built by farmers years ago. I think they looked more like burial mounds, but who knows.
Also, I passed by the Eastern Continental Divide, where the water goes to either the Atlantic or the Gulf. You never know what you’re going to see in the trail.","Blacksburg

Finally, about mid-morning I hit the trail for an easy 2.4 mile walk to the campsite. I took my time, and made it to the site a bit after noon. It had been an easy walk with no large climbs and virtually no rocks. 
The site was a beautiful flat spot by the trail with a small stream nearby. I took my time setting up my tent, and around 3:00 ate a late lunch/early dinner (Linner, as Seinfeld would say). After that it was a two-hour nap. I think I needed it. 
I ended up going to sleep for the night soon after dark, listening to the nearby stream babbling in the dark. Yes, it had not been a very productive day, but that’s ok. I felt much better the next day.","Niday Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608896,"The walk this day began with the climb up Brush Mountain, about 1500 feet over a couple of miles. I took it slow, stopping often for micro-breaks. I eventually made it to the top, where I made a short side trip to the Audie Murphy Memorial. 
If you’re not familiar with Audie Murphy, he was one of the most decorated heroes of WWII. Among his honors were the Medal of Honor. He died in a plane crash on Brush Mountain, and a monument now sits near the site of the crash. It’s rather emotional, with flags, dog tags, and other commemorations adorning the stone. I’m glad I made the side trip to see it. 
The trail then followed an old forest service road for a while, which made for easy walking. After a couple of miles, it ducked into the woods. I made it to a shelter .4 mile off the trail in late afternoon, and set up in the shelter. It started turning a bit cold, and rain was a possibility that night. 
A short while later, a father and his two twenty-something children arrived. Don, Rachel, and Andrew from New Jersey were out on a week-long section hike. They were quiet and probably got tired of hearing me yak about the trail. 
The walk to the water was down a steep, long incline. At least the trail volunteers had put in steps to help navigate the trail to the water. 
About sundown, two thru-hikers arrived, so six of us wedged into the six person shelter. It was rather cold and breezy that night, and rain showers arrived in the early morning, but were gone by daybreak. It had been a good day, and my body didn’t feel all beat up.

Today’s highlight would be Dragon’s Tooth, one of the iconic spots on this section of the trail. It was generally uphill for about five miles. The wind became stronger as the day went on and never let up. I heard later that some gusts had been 50 mph or more, and I believe it. 
But the worst was the rocks. Rocks large and small littered the trail. I had to do some scrambling at times. Once I had to go up a rock that was too high for me to just climb over. I could have taken my pack off, but instead I got one leg up on the rock, then moved back and forth, finally pushing off on my lower foot and using the momentum of the pack to pull me up. Needless to say, this section was extremely slow going for me. I’m sure I was averaging under a mile an hour. 
I know. Experienced hikers don’t give two thoughts to this section. And the rocks of Pennsylvania and in New England will be much worse. But for me, this was challenging. 
However, I finally made it to Dragon’s Tooth, a huge rock. Thank goodness, the trail does not go over it. Some people climb up it, but not me. I took a picture, then began the descent. 
Going down was worse than the climb. Sometimes I had to sit on my butt and slide down. Other times I had to use imbedded grab bars. It was slow going. 
The trail finally became a regular trail with short sections of rocks. In the distance I could see a storm rolling in, rolling down a mountain and filling the valley with clouds and fog. It started sleeting and lightly raining for a while. Fortunately, it soon let up. 
I finally made it to a road crossing and hobbled a third of a mile to Four Pines Hostel, where I’d spend the night. 
Four Pines, which has been named as one of the ten best hostels on the trail, is a donation-based facility. There are chickens and Guineas roaming around the bunkhouse. I grabbed a bunk and relaxed a bit. They let me borrow the Dragon Wagon, an old van, to drive to the nearby store, where I got a pizza, a coke, and some beer. Later, Kelsey, a young lady I met on the way down from Dragon’s Tooth, came in. She had been day hiking and was staying at the hostel that night. It turns out she’s a sales/marketing rep for the Sawyer company, who makes the Sawyer Squeeze water filter. This filter is ubiquitous on the trail. It’s the one I use. We shared a couple of beers and swapped trail stories until time for bed. 
Even though it was under seven miles, that day was one of the most difficult I’ve experienced on the trail. The wind and the rocks took it out of me. But I made it.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608925,"One option when walking the trail is to “slack pack.”  Slack packing is usually catching a ride to a road crossing, then walking back to a starting point carrying only what is needed for the day. Four Pines offers some slack packing options (for a fee), so I decided to try one. 
Tom made coffee and eggs in the morning for me (remember the chickens?). Just eggs. No toast or bacon. We then headed out for a short drive to a road crossing. Then, carrying only a few items in a day pack, I walked back to the hostel. I probably had all of three pounds in the pack, so it was easy walking. The most difficult part was shuffling through leaves, piled high by the previous day’s winds. At times the leaves were thigh high. However, it was better than rocks. 
Walking only a few miles with a light pack, I made it back to the hostel in the early afternoon. A few other hikers were in the hostel by then. I relaxed for a while, then took a short nap. Another trip to the store in the Dragon Wagon completed my afternoon.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608931,"About sunrise, Tom drove me back to Route 311 to begin my day (after eggs, of course). I then began a three and a half mile climb up to McAfee Knob, the most iconic spot on the AT. It’s possibly the most photographed spot on the trail. 
There are two ways to get to the Knob. One of them is to walk most of the way on a fairly easy fire road. The other is to take the AT route. I, of course, being of questionable mind, followed the AT. It was slow going, but the weather was darned near perfect. I took my time, taking many breaks along the way. 
Finally I reached the iconic spot. Since it was a Sunday and the weather was almost perfect, many day hikers milled around the area. I convinced a group of teenagers to move their gear off the Knob so I could get my obligatory picture without their stuff cluttering the photo. A kind lady took several pictures of me to memorize my moment. 
I met a former thru hikers who lives in the area, and she helped me more than she knows. I had trepidations about going down McAfee Knob then climbing up to Tinkers Cliffs on the same day. I could just stop at a shelter and tackle Tinkers the next day. She encouraged me to do Tinkers that day, especially since it was only early afternoon. Her words gave me the conviction to keep going. I thank her for helping me. 
I made the climb down, then stopped at a shelter for water. I drank about a liter of water and ate lunch before taking on the climb up Tinkers. 
It was slow going, but I made it. The views were beautiful, similar to McAfee Knob. The valley below, and rows of mountains in the distance. I then headed down for the shelter. 
I arrived at the shelter about an hour and a half before I thought I would. Also, I felt good. My hips didn’t ache, and I hadn’t even taken any ibuprofen that day. I again thank the lady who had encouraged me. She had given me the confidence to do it. 
Shortly after that, Steve and Leslie from Richmond arrived at the shelter. I had met them at the top of Tinkers. They were hiking the local trails for a few days. We had a good evening talking about (what else?) backpacking. I also learned about their lives and jobs, and I told them some of my story. We all turned in about sundown.

Just as I was heading down the mountain to town, it started lightly raining, so the last couple of miles were a bit wet. But I’ve walked in a lot worse, and by the time I’d made it to town, the rain was essentially nonexistent. 
I came to a highway, then walked a short distance to the Howard Johnson motel. After checking in, I took a long, hot shower, then did laundry. I caught a ride to a bbq joint and sampled some North Carolina style fare. I’m from Kansas City, the self-proclaimed bbq capital of the world, so I’m a bit prejudiced. But the NC style doesn’t compare to KC bbq. But I did like the hush puppies. I think I ate about eight of them.

I then walked to a coffee shop for a cup of real coffee and a salad for lunch. After getting some supplies at the nearby Kroger’s, I hoofed it back to the motel. I then worked on this journal for a few hours before walking across the street for a Mexican food dinner.

The trail paralleled I-81 for a while, then passed under it and up into the woods. I then began a three-mile gradual climb. Thankfully, a lot of switchbacks made for a gentle grade going up. I met a day hiker in this section, the only person I’ve seen since leaving town. 
The trail continued with a series of short ups and downs. Part of the walk was on an old road of some sort, which was extremely easy going. A lot of switchbacks also made the climbs and descents easier than they could have been. 
I understand that an ice storm came through this area this winter, and dozens of trees are down because of it. The wonderful people who maintain the trail have cut through the horizontal trees, allowing hikers to pass through easily. These maintainers are all volunteers, and they provide an invaluable service. If not for them, there would be no trail.

However, around noon, I started feeling lethargic, and my legs felt tired. I knew I’d have to stop at a shelter in a couple of hours to get water, the only water source for in this stretch. Also, the shelter was a good quarter of a mile off the trail, down a steep incline. So, I figured I’d just hoof it down to the shelter and take the rest of the day off to relax and recover. I made it down to the shelter, thoroughly expecting to call it a day. 
The next day I had planned on staying at a motel near the trail, and I started thinking. The motel was a good ten miles away. If I waited until Friday to start for it, I wouldn’t arrive until late afternoon or evening. I thought I’d rather rest at the motel than at the shelter. I thought about the former thru hiker I had met on McAfee  Knob and how she had encouraged me. So, I guzzled a bunch of water, downed an energy bar, and made the climb out of the shelter. I was heading for a tenting site about six miles from the motel, and I hoped to make it before dark. 
I arrived at the site a full hour before I had expected, set up my tent, ate some dinner, and hit the sack. I was so happy I had moved on from the shelter. A big thanks goes to the lady who had built up my confidence on McAfee Knob.

The first task for the day was to climb about 1000 feet in a mile. It was slow going, of course, but I made it. Then it was downhill for lunch in the warm sunshine at Bryant Ridge Shelter. I wish I could have stayed here; it’s a double-decker with a partial wrap-around porch right beside a stream. Definitely one of the nicest shelters I’ve seen. 
While eating lunch, a seventy-something day hiker and his dog stopped at the shelter. We had an interesting talk, mainly about hiking. After an hour long break, during which I ate lunch and an energy bar then drank a liter of water, it was time for the big climb of the day: 2300 feet over four miles. Thankfully, there were many switchbacks, but part of the trail was straight up the side of the mountain. I kept repeating my mantra of “Keep going; eventually you’ll get there.” It was difficult, but I finally made it to the top. It was then a short downhill to Cornelius Creek Shelter. 
I must say that I’ve had been extremely lucky with weather since I’ve been back on the trail. Other than the blustery winds on Dragon’s Tooth day, I’ve only experienced light rain a couple of times. Today It was warm enough to wear a t-shirt for a few hours. I know it can be a lot worse, and I hope it holds out for as long as possible. Rain, along with high winds, was forecast that night and next morning, so maybe my luck is changing. 
Four weekend hikers were at the shelter, and it was interesting talking with them and seeing all the gear they had brought, including camp chairs and other extraneous gear. I’ve become a believer in ultralight gear as much as possible. I’m not criticizing them because a short trip into the woods differs from a long-distance walk, but it was amusing to watch them

The cold front had definitely hit. 
I’d checked some forecasts (atweather.org has forecasts for individual shelters) and saw that it was going to be blustery all day, with gusts up to 30 mph or higher. Also, temperatures would dip into the low 20s that night along with gusty winds. My plan was to tent that night, and I didn’t relish the idea of making camp in those conditions. I had been planning on taking a zero day later in the week, and decided to do it sooner. I had enough of the cold last year in the Smokies, so decided to get out of it. I know the weather won’t always be good, but I really don’t like the cold. 
I made the climb up to the top of Apple Orchard Mountain, where the winds were so powerful that a couple of blasts actually blew me sideways. A mile or so later I came to a crossing of the Blue Ridge Parkway, where I called Aubrey, a local shuttle driver from nearby Buena Vista. About 45 minutes later, he pulled up to drive me off the mountain and down to a motel. He’s one of most interesting drivers I’ve met. He kept me entertained, mainly with hiker stories, during the half hour drive to town. Being a shuttle driver since 1982, he had a bundle of stories. 
About 2:30, we arrived in Buena Vista, and, as he drive me to he one of the two budget-type motels in town, I realized that nothing would be within easy walking in that town. I paid him for the ride, then tried to walk into the lobby. The door was locked, and a sign said to dial 0 on the nearby phone, which I did. The lady on the other end said “Checkin time is 4:00.” I asked if she expected me to wait an hour and a half, to which she repeated her sentence. I hung up and called Aubrey back. He then drove me to Lexington, just a few miles away, where I checked into a Super 8, which is practically next door to a Walmart. A restaurant is across the street, and several other restaurants are within easy walking distance. I was so glad the other place wouldn’t let me in when I got there. This is a much better place for several reasons. If you’re hiking through this area, forego Buena Vista and go to Lexington instead. You’ll be glad you did. 
I took a long hot shower, then walked across the street to restaurant for a steak and a couple of beers. I met a young lady who had served in the Army in Afghanistan, and now works in the US Embassy in Kabul. She was back in the country for vacation and had stopped in town to visit relatives.

After breakfast, I needed to get to a laundromat. Since one is not within walking distance, and UBER is not available in Lexington, I called the only cab company in town. After leaving a message and wondering if I’d get a call back, the young lady behind the desk offered to do my laundry. I was overjoyed! It was so nice of her, and she even folded my clothes. I gave her some money for her trouble, which she tried to refuse. I insisted. She had just saved me from a big hassle.

I expected to warm up as I plodded along over fairly easy terrain. I had walked in much worse conditions in the Smokies last year, and, even then, had never had much of a problem getting warm while moving. However, it just wasn’t happening. In fact, I was wearing the same gear I had used in cold weather before, but I just could not get warm. I also saw that showers might move in during the afternoon or evening. I decided to get out of the cold and begin walking again tomorrow, when the temperatures are supposed to be in the 60s or even 70s. 
I had been considering staying at a hostel in Glasgow and slack packing for a couple of days. So when I came to a road crossing, I called the hostel for a ride. An hour later Bear, the driver, showed up and drove me to Stanimal’s, the hostel. 
What a wonderful place! Instead of a bunkhouse, hikers stay in an actual house complete with kitchen, washer/dryer, big screen TV, massage chair (which is heavenly), a living room with comfortable couches, and sheets on the bunks. All this for only $30 a night. 
Another hiker, who’s slack packing today, is also staying here. Bear said he’d come by this evening to drive us to a local restaurant for dinner. It should be an interesting experience. 
I’ll slack pack tomorrow and Thursday. It’ll be a nice break, and I should be able to pick up some mileage. As for the rest of the day, I’m going to get warm. 
Although I didn’t get in very many miles today, it doesn’t bother me. Last year I paid lip service to the idea of taking it easy, especially at first. But I seemed to feel guilty unless I was out there humping it. This time out, it doesn’t bother me. I have plenty of time to finish this hike, so if I take a half-day off, it’s fine with me.

I tried not to hold it against him. He’s definitely an experienced hiker who had some good tips for me. 
This morning Bear drove Crash north so he could continue his walk, then picked me up for my drive to Petite Gap. It was after 9:00 by the time I started, but I only had about ten easy miles to go back to a road crossing near Glasgow. Also, carrying only a few pounds made it even easier. It was sunny and cold with a brisk wind, but I warmed up quickly, as opposed to the day before when I just could not get warm. 
By midday, I had removed my outer two layers and walked in a t-shirt the rest of the day. I met a few day hikers and stopped to talk with some of them. The easy downhill grade helped me make good time, and Donna from the hostel picked me up at the trailhead before 3:00. I’m a slow walker, so averaging about two miles an hour is good for me.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609658,"I was up at 4:00 so I could be ready for Bear’s pick up at 5:15. We then headed out in darkness, driving about thirty miles north to pick up a couple of section hikers. It was a wild ride on dark mountain roads where a lot of logging trucks were also traveling. It was daylight by the time we found the hikers. 
We then drove south to the Punchbowl Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The AT crosses there, and I was going to walk south about 11 miles back to the trail crossing near Glasgow. The section hikers were heading north for a three-day hike back to their car. 
It was fairly easy walking, especially since I was slack packing again. First, I had to walk up for a couple of miles to the top of Bluff Mountain. By the time I arrived at the peak, I was walking in a t-shirt since it was warm and sunny. At the top were three section hikers, so we talked a bit and enjoyed the views. 
Near the top is a plaque commemorating the spot where a five-year-old boy died in 1891. He had wandered away from a school about seven miles away. 
After that, it was mainly downhill for the rest of the day. Some of the grades were steep, so it made for some slow going, even though it was descending. 
I was at the parking lot near the Foot Bridge at 4:00, and Donna was there to meet me. Twelve hours after rising, I was back at the hostel. 
A flip-flop thru hiker had checked into the hostel. Pete from New Jersey is an amazing guy. He’s done ultra marathons, and is the picture of fitness. He began his walk at Harper’s Ferry, which is approximately at the halfway point of the AT. To avoid the bubble, he’s walking south to Springer Mountain. He’ll then ride back to Harper’s Ferry and walk to Maine. He’s doing 25 or more miles a day and plans on finishing the trail in 100 days. Amazing! I believe he’ll do it. 
A while later, a couple of section hikers from Alabama, Kenny and Corey, checked in. They’re fire fighters/EMS technicians, and are experienced hikers. They’re working on completing the AT over a period of years. Lately I’ve met several hikers who are doing this. To me, that takes more dedication than doing the whole trail in one year (or 18 months in my case). 
The four of us went to dinner at Scotto’s and, of course, talked about hiking. We then visited Dollar General for beer and other essentials, then went back to the hostel. 
The weather for tomorrow is supposed to be rainy with highs in the 50s. I decided I didn’t want to put up with such nasty weather, so have decided to take the day off. Some may call me a wuss, but the idea of being out there in a cold rain just didn’t appeal to me.","Punch Bowl Overlook

I fixed bacon and eggs for breakfast, then lounged around most of the day. I almost felt guilty about taking a zero, but whenever I stepped outside, I knew I had made the right decision. I’m sure it was colder and more miserable up in the mountains. 
In the late afternoon Kenny and Corey came back, and a couple of other section hikers also arrived. They confirmed my suspicions; it had been a cold, wet day, complete with sleet. 
Kenny, Corey, and I returned to Scotto’s for dinner, then came back to relax for the evening. Bear is picking me up at 6:30 for another day of slack packing. It’s supposed to be sunny and 75, so it should be a good day to be back in the woods.","

The weather was just about perfect. The sun was out, and as the day wore on it became warm, almost like a summer day. 
The walking was fairly easy for the most part, except for the ascent to Route 60. For a few miles the trail followed the Brown Mountain Creek, where the remnants of an early 1900s village remain.  Freed slaves building and lived in the community. Stone structures that were once part of log cabins remain, and I saw one crumbling stone fireplace. It was quite interesting to imagine people living there. 
After Bear drove me back to Stanimal’s, I walked to Scotto’s for a burger. Another section hiker showed up, and Bill, one of the other hikers was still there. His buddy got off the trail because of blisters. Anyway, we talked for a while, then hit the sack. I’m finally heading out with a full pack tomorrow.","Punch Bowl Overlook

I was back to a full pack today; no slack packing for at least a few days. As I started climbing 2000 feet over three miles, the fog became thicker. It didn’t rain, but at times, the cloud I was walking in seemed to drip. It was a long, slow slog, but I made it. At the top was a large meadow for what seemed like a mile or two. The fog was so thick I had a hard time following the trail. Then, a few feet ahead of me, I’d finally see a fence post with the familiar white blaze painted on it. I was glad I had been able to stay on the trail in the pea soup fog. 
I saw a few day and section hikers. A group of three young thru hikers blew by me at one point. I’m amazed at how fast they can hike. They look so light on their feet while I plod along, taking it one slow step at a time, especially on the uphills. Oh well, as everyone says, it’s not a race. It it were, I’d be in last place. But I don’t care. I’m still making progress. 
The fog left as I descended, and I found a tenting site about 6:00. I set up my tent, ate, brushed my teeth, hung my bear bag, and was in bed by 7:00, just when the rain started. Light rains came and went occasionally during the night. Nothing serious. I also heard what sounded like a wolf howling in the night.

It was mainly sunny and warm in the morning, and I saw some section hikers. The terrain was the usual ups and downs, though the climb to Spy Rock was rather strenuous for me. Generally it went up, without the benefit of switchbacks. I’m so slow on the uphills. I’ll be glad when I finally get my trail legs. 
I kept pushing, not even stopping for lunch. I took a few quick breaks, but was in a hurry to beat the storm. 
The last mile was again up without switchbacks to The Priest Shelter. I slogged along, knowing it would be close. I was about a half mile from the finish when thunder rumbled in the distance. That motivated me to keep moving. 
I finally arrived at the shelter just as it began raining. My timing was perfect. Three gentlemen, section hikers, were at the shelter, so we watched it rain from the safety of the shelter. 
After an hour or so, it quit raining, so we all fixed our dinners and ate before it started again. Although we heard it thunder, and it did rain off on on during the night, it was not a big storm. 
It’s a tradition for hikers to confess their sins in the logbook at the Priest Shelter. Some of them were quite humorous and clever, although there aren’t many entries for this year since it’s so early in the season. I’m sure the logbook will fill with all kinds of confessions later in the year.

I’ve heard stories about the difficulty of that ascent, and didn’t want to tackle it late in the day. So I have that to look forward to tomorrow morning. 
The last two miles uphill were no fun, but at least there were switchbacks, which is so much better than going straight up the side of a mountain. I pulled into the shelter about 3:00, which has given me time to relax and get caught up on the journal (although I won’t be able to post until tomorrow or later when I have a good signal.) 
The plan tomorrow is to summit Three Ridges, then go down to Reid’s Gap, where a driver from Stanimal’s in Waynesboro will pick me up and drive me to the hostel. I may be able to do more slack packing after that. Also, I need to pick up prescriptions and other supplies in Waynesboro.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610161,"It was the day: climb Three Ridges. I woke fresh and rested, and was glad I had had so much time to relax the previous afternoon and evening. 
Well after dark during the night, two hikers set up tents near the shelter. I could hear them snoring as I trudged out of camp at 7:15 in the morning. I thought to myself, “Well, at least I got a head start on those guys.” 
I knew it would take me a while to summit the mountain, so I took it slow (as if I had a choice!). I took at least three fifteen minute breaks on the way up the 3.5 mile ascent. 
There were a lot of rather steep switchbacks, and sometimes the trail turned into a pile of rocks. Once I thought I had wandered off the trail, but no, the trail really was a large jumble of rocks. About a mile from the top, I came to what looked like a vertical wall about ten feet high. I was forced to scramble up the barricade. It might not have been so challenging if I had longer legs, but that’s one of the disadvantages of being so short. 
After more than four hours of trudging, I finally reached the flat, tree-covered area at the top of Three Ridges. I was almost ecstatic. I had done it. It was one of, if not the most, difficult climbs of my entire journey. I know more difficult ascents lie ahead, but I felt a sense of achievement at having made it to the top of Three Ridges. I celebrated by sitting down and eating a lunch of cheese and beef jerky. 
After that, it was about four miles down to Reid’s Gap. Of course, there was a mile climb during the downward walk, but I made it to the gap a bit after 3:00. A short time later, Adam, the owner of Stanimal’s, picked me up and drove me to the Stanimal’s facility in Waynesboro. On the way, we swung by the post office to pick up a package my sister had sent me. 
After checking in, I took a shower, did laundry, and walked across the street for some fast food. A few other hikers are here, but the place is so big that there’s plenty of room for all. I sat outside and talked with other hikers and Glenn, the manager, until after dark. Then it was to bed. I had survived a challenging day on the trail, and I felt good as I drifted off to sleep.","Harper’s Creek Shelter

Luckily, a CVS is about two blocks from Stanimal’s. Unluckily, I can’t get one of the scripts filled until Sunday, thanks to insurance. Oh well, it could be worse. 
I also needed to get a new portable phone charger. The one I have is fine. It’s  extremely lightweight, but is only 5000 mAh, which is good for about three charges. So I UBERed it to Target and picked up a 10000 mAh charger along with some other supplies. 
I took it easy in the afternoon, then was considering dinner options. A steak sounded good, so Adam, the owner of Stanimal’s, recommended Jake’s Bar and Grill in downtown Waynesboro. It would be a long walk there, and since he was heading out, he offered to drive me there. 
I was the only customer when I arrived at Jake’s, although others showed up a bit later. I sat at the bar and chatted with the two ladies working there while I had a beer. Then I was served one of the best meals I’ve ever eaten (not counting my mom’s cooking).  I had beef filet from locally raised, grass-fed cattle. Along with that was thinly sliced fried potatoes, grilled broccoli, and cornbread. It was excellent! I highly recommend the place if you’re ever in Waynesboro.

I was careful not to slip and fall. 
It rained off and on all day, sometimes quite heavily. At least it was fairly warm, and the wind was generally nonexistent. As I summited Humpback Mountain, though, it turned a bit cooler. Rocks became larger and more abundant, so it was slow going. 
I finally started descending, and, as I did, the rain increased. It reminded me of the days walking in the rain in Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

It was one of the least difficult sections I’ve hiked in a while. The trail had few rocks, and the uphills were not steep or very long. I walked as fast as I could and ended up averaging just under two mph, which is about as quickly as I can move on the trail. I was finished by 11:30, so Adam picked me up and drove me back to Stanimal’s. 
After a shower, I grabbed a quick lunch, then walked to a phone store to get a new protective screen for my phone. I can actually see my phone screen now without looking through a spiderweb of cracks. 
I was planning on heading out tomorrow with a full pack, entering Shenandoah National Park (SNP). However, severe storms are forecast to be in the area tomorrow, so I’ll wait until Monday morning to get back to it. In fact, a lot of hikers came into the hostel today and are taking tomorrow off to stay out of the bad weather. 
Later, I walked the .6 mile down the hill to eat a burger at Jake’s. After eating another great meal, I tried to get UBER for a ride back to the hostel. However, no cars were available, so I started walking back up the hill. Shortly after I started, I passed by a theater where people were streaming in. I walked a few feet farther, then turned around and went back. It turns out a live performance of “Alice in Wonderland: The Musical” was getting ready to start in a few minutes. I thought about it for a few seconds, then told myself, “What the heck? I’m not going back to the trail tomorrow, and I don’t have anything else to do tonight,” so I bought one of the few remaining tickets, which happened to be on the fourth row. 
It was an extremely enjoyable performance, put on by children ranging from about ten years old through high school. I was impressed with the production as well as the acting and singing by the youngsters. The actress who played Alice was especially talented. I laughed several times at the humor and puns sprinkled throughout the show. I thought about it later, as I walked back to the hostel, and realized how lucky I was that no cars had been available. Had they been, I would have had another ho-hum evening instead of seeing a live show in an historic, old theater put on by talented kids.

More people showed up at the hostel today to get out of the weather. It was interesting to listen to the young people talk about their travails during their journey. A group of middle age section hikers were also bustling around, preparing to begin their section hike tomorrow. 
I organized my stuff, then went to Scotto’s in Waynesboro, about two blocks from Stanimal’s, for dinner. Even though the name is the same, this Scotto’s is not owned by the same people as the one in Glasgow. I think this Scotto’s is better, but both are decent Italian restaurants. I enjoyed a good dinner of lasagna with wine.

On the drive to the trailhead, I met a couple from southwest Missouri who were starting their flip-flop thru hike. They’re going to walk north to Katahdin, then return to Waynesboro to walk south to Springer. John and Becky own a bison ranch north of Springfield, and it was refreshing to talk with someone from my home state. There aren’t many Missourians on the trail. Barring injury, I’m sure they’ll have a successful thru hike. 
The walk along the bridge over the interstate to enter the Shenandoah National Park (SNP) was especially brutal. The wind whipped in the exposed area, literally blowing me sideways a couple of times. I then entered the woods that lead into the park. About a half mile later, I came to a stand that had been destroyed in last winter’s ice storm. It’s where hikers normally self-register to backpack in SNP. Since the stand was knocked down, a sign said to walk .35 mile down a side trail to register. I said “The heck with that!” or words to that effect. I continued. I figured if they caught me, I’d deal with it then. Also, I had heard that I could register at ranger stations up the trail. I felt guilty about it, but I wasn’t about to walk an extra three fourths of a mile in that weather. 
The southern 20 or 30 miles of Skyline Drive through SNP are still closed because of the ice storm. The trail roughly parallels the drive and crosses it several times. At some of these crossings I could see trees blocking part of the roadway. Crews were working on the damage, and I’ve heard the drive will fully be open in a couple of weeks. 
I arrived at the shelter by mid-afternoon and considered continuing for a few more miles where I could find a tent site. However, I didn’t relish the idea of setting up a tent in the wind, which was turning colder, so I decided to call it a day. A while later, a couple of section hikers showed up. Then Amazing, a young woman in her 20s arrived. She had been at Stanimal’s the previous day, but we didn’t talk then since the place was so crowded. Finally, John and Becky showed up. It had been a rough first day for them. The others tented near the shelter, but Amazing and I stayed in the shelter. I always tell people I’m too lazy to set up a tent if I can sleep in a shelter. Also, it helps me get out of camp more quickly in the morning.

I was the first one out of camp, and it thankfully began warming up as the day progressed. It wasn’t an especially difficult walk, although some of the uphills were rather challenging. 
I saw some deer, and one of them was actually walking down the trail. When she saw me, she stared a few seconds, then decided to head into the brush. The deer seem to be used to humans and are not afraid. 
The last half mile up to the “hut” was almost straight up. My legs were tired after a day of walking, but I finally made it. This is the first hut, as they are called in SNP. They’re basically shelters, but have bear poles on which to hang your food bag, which is convenient. I think most of them are double deckers, so people can sleep on the second floor if they desire. 
The hut was crowded with section and thru hikers. Amazing showed up, but decided to hammock for the night. It appears that the first bubble of fast hikers are catching up with me. I won’t see most of them again, since they put in 25 or more miles a day. Anyway, it’s the first crowded shelter I’ve dealt with this year.

The first half mile was a climb up to the rocky top of Blackrock Mountain, which afforded beautiful views of the valleys and mountains in the distance. I soon shed my long-sleeved shirt and walked in a t-shirt the rest of the day. 
A few miles later, I came to a picnic area, which was devoid of cars due to Skyline Drive being closed. I got rid of some trash in a dumpster, and used the hydrant to fill my water bottle. I took my time, eating an early lunch at the picnic table and enjoying the warm sunshine. 
After that was a section of trail with lots of trees blocking the trail, the result of the ice storm. Since the drive is closed, the volunteer maintainers cannot get to the trail to clean it up. These obstacles made for slow going. It also made me appreciate the maintainers more than ever. As I’ve said before, if it weren’t for the volunteers, there would be no trail. I dealt with that first-hand today. 
There were some difficult climbs, including one to the Loft Mountain Campground, a business along Skyline Drive. Normally, the camp store and restaurant would be open, but with the road closure, it’s closed. I talked with one of the employees, and was told the restaurant would open in two days. So, I missed a good meal by fewer than 48 hours! Ugh. Oh well, at least it wasn’t raining. 
I continued, again dealing with the ups and downs. I finally descended to Pinefield Hut, where three thru hikers had stopped for a bite to eat before continuing. After they left, I was at the hut alone until Amazing showed up. We had a good conversation during dinner. She’s from Arizona, and gave up her job as a speech therapist assistant to walk the trail. She may walk other long trails after completing the AT. An interesting and adventurous young lady.

Three decent climbs faced me, with the three mile summit of High Top Mountain being the last and longest one. It briefly rained a couple of times in the morning, then turned sunny and warm. 
The ascent to High Top was long, and parts of it were steep. I progressed slowly, stopping to take breaks when needed. I was treated to beautiful views at the top. 
Several thru hikers passed me about then. They told me trail magic was at a gap about a mile from my destination. They were correct; a couple from Pittsburgh had set up at the gap with sodas, beer, and food. I grabbed a soda and a snack cake, then thanked them. They said they were staying at the same place I would be and would see me there. 
I walked the rest of the way to Swift Run Gap and called the motel for a shuttle. While waiting, I went to the Ranger station and finally registered for SNP. I’m now legal. 
At the motel, I showered and did laundry. While waiting for my clothes to dry, I struck up a conversation with the husband of one of the motel caretakers. Hans told me the gas station about a quarter of a mile away closed at 7:00. I had read about the place on my app, and one comment raved about the fried chicken. As it was 6:30, I grabbed my clothes from the dryer and dressed quickly. I started to walk, but Hans said he’d give me a ride. Also, since it was nearing closing time, he said he’d get me a good deal on food that would otherwise go to waste. And did he ever! I got a one-gallon baggie stuffed full of thighs, legs, and wings for $5.00. I also got some deviled eggs and macaroni salad. Back at the motel, I gave Hans half of the chicken, and he gave me a shot of locally-distilled clear liquid that burned all the way down. He said it was made from pawpaws, and was surprised that I knew what they were. I then returned to my room for a feast, stuffing myself with fried chicken and the other food I had bought. I guess I am getting hiker hunger. 
There was a knock on my door a while later, and the couple from Pittsburgh showered me with leftover cokes and snacks. They were heading back home the next day, so I gladly accepted their largesse, even though I couldn’t possibly take everything they offered. They are truly trail angels.

It was a fairly easy walk; the usual us and downs, but nothing too drastic. The day was sunny and warm, although the breeze sometimes picked up and brought a chill to the air, especially when clouds blocked the sun.
I made it to the Lewis Mountain Campground, where I visited the store for a coke and a sandwich. After eating, I returned to the store for another sandwich for supper, and I also picked up a couple of beers. Since it was only a mile downhill to the shelter, I figured I could carry the extra 24 ounces.
After making my bed in the shelter, I drank the beers while relaxing. A while later, a group of Russian immigrants showed up. Most were day hiking, but one woman set up a hammock near the shelter. The day hikers left, and the woman said some of her friends would be showing up later. Several section and through hikers arrived later, including Jane, a 21-year-old African-American lady from Chicago. She had started her long southbound section hike in Boiling Springs, PA, a few weeks ago, and was short on food. I went through my food bag and offered her several items, which she happily agreed to take. I figured I'd have a chance to resupply soon, so I wasn't worried about running out of food.
A couple of northbound section hikers also arrived. Jeff and Tom (I think that was his name) were on their first day of a long section hike to New York. Since they are in their 50s (or early 60s?), I'll probably see them along the trail as we move north.
A parking lot off of Skyline Drive is about a quarter of a mile from the Bearfence Shelter, and around 6:00 a group of Russian immigrants, who live in Maryland, arrived. They were friends and relatives of the lady who had set up her hammock. The group carried in bags and bags of food and drink. The first Russian lady hikes a section of the trail every year around her birthday. She hikes the number of miles as her new age, which I believe is around 45 this year. At any rate, the group brought a big pot of pilaf, which they heated up on the campfire. They also brought desserts of all sorts, along with wine and brandy. They invited all of us hikers to participate, and insisted we eat and drink. It turned into something I've never experienced before: a Saturday night cocktail party at a shelter on the AT. It was wonderful to eat good food and enjoy a glass of wine at a shelter. I talked with some of the Russians, finding out that they immigrated to the US about the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union. I definitely appreciated their hospitality. I jokingly told Jeff and Tom that this happened every night on the trail. I don't think they believed me. The party wrapped up about 9:00, and I was fast asleep shortly thereafter. It had definitely been a memorable and unusual day on the trail.","Swift Run Gap

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611526,"I was up and out of the shelter soon after 7:00, feeling no ill effects from the previous night's festivities. I knew I had a long day ahead of me. I could either stop at a shelter about 12 miles ahead, or I could push on another four miles to Skyland Resort, which is a type of hotel near the trail. It also has a restaurant with views overlooking the valley below and mountains in the distance. I figured that rather than stopping in the middle of the afternoon, I'd contine to the resort, where I could get a good meal and sleep in a bed.
It was the usual ups and downs, and some sections were rather rocky. There were a lot of beautiful views along the trail, and, it being good weather and a Sunday, I saw a lot of day hikers. I was glad I moved on past the shelter, or I would have been stopping too early in the day. However, the last four miles were not easy walking. Rocks, of course, and uphills were par for the course, but I reached the resort about 5:00. Skyland is a nice resort, but it's not especially hiker-friendly. Instead of a hotel, it is a group of cabins at least a quarter of a mile from the restaurant and gift shop, and was designed for people with cars. After checking in, I walked down the hill to find my room in one of the cabins. The rooms have balconies on the back that overlook the same valley I had been seeing all day from the trail. After a shower, I trudged back up the hill for dinner. However, since it was Easter Sunday, the wait for the restaurant was quite long. So I went into the adjoining tap room, which has a limited menu. The service in the tap room was poor, to say the least. I finally got a beer and put in a food order. Some people waited at least 20 minutes just for a drink. The bartender would disappear at times and not return for 10 or 15 minutes. An open bottle of wine was on the bar, and I saw one exasperated guy pour himself a glass of wine while waiting. Some people complained to the manager, so another person came over to help out. I unsderstand that the staff was overwhelmed with the number of people who had shown up on Easter for a nice meal in the restaurant.
The next morning, I mentioned the poor service as I was checking out. They said that the crowds had been bigger this year, and they weren't staffed up yet to handle so many people. I'm sure it's a great place to visit. Just don't do it on Easter Sunday. At least I got a good meal, a shower, and a soft bed to sleep in. And at least it wasn't raining.","Bearfence Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611537,"Today I did something I haven’t done in about 40 years: I  hitchhiked. As I was walking along on the warm, sunny day, I realized I’d arrive at a gap with a busy highway near the town of Luray. I read on Guthook that it was an easy hitch into town, so I figured, what the heck? Why not? 
With the beautiful weather, I saw a lot of day hikers. I took a break at a picnic area along Skyline Drive and talked with a couple who were out for the day. The trail wasn’t particularly difficult, although, of course, some sections had a lot of rocks. I guess I’m becoming redundant when I mention ups, downs, and rocks. 
I arrived at Thornton Gap, then walked a quarter mile to an overpass, where I stuck out my thumb. About 10 minutes later, a commuter stopped to pick me up. He was an interesting guy who used to do a lot of hiking. He went out of his way to drive me to a motel in town. I tried to give him some money, but he refused. 
After a shower, I walked across the street to a small and non-pretentious Italian restaurant, where I had lasagna. It was a tasty and filling meal, and the waitress was friendly and funny. 
After dinner, I called Alison, who offers shuttle services. Her message said to email her, so I did, expecting to hear back from her. She still hadn’t replied (or so I thought) when I went to bed, so I figured I’d somehow find a way back to the trail in the morning. 
I kind of like the option of sleeping off the trail when possible. A shower and clean sheets sure beat being dirty and sleeping in a shelter, although I do enjoy being in the woods. I’m spoiling myself this week. I know I won’t be able to do that every night, but it’s nice to do when I have the option.","Skyland Resort

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611540,"After walking more than a thousand miles on this trail, I finally saw a bear! I was ending a long uphill about a quarter of a mile from my destination. I happened to glance over to my left, and about 30 yards away, I saw a grown bear staring at me. I stopped immediately and looked at him (or her). I took out my phone and took pictures and videos. He just kept staring at me. After a few minutes, I clacked my poles and said what everyone seems to say when they see a bear, “Hey, bear.”  He put his head down and began ambling away. 
As I reached a parking lot where I was ending my hike that day, I was excited to tell a hiker preparing to head out. About that time, a couple of day hikers came into the parking lot. They had been just behind me, but hadn’t seen the bear. I showed them pictures of my exciting encounter. 
The reason I was stopping at a parking lot had to do with getting out of Luray. Alison still hadn’t answered my email (or so I thought), so I still had to find a ride back to the trail. Luray has no Uber or taxis, so I asked at the motel about shuttle drivers. They didn’t know of any, but suggested I go to the visitor center, so I walked the mile to it. The only driver they knew of was Alison, so they called her. She was working her day job and told them she had emailed me the name and number of a driver. I checked my email and junk folder, but had nothing from her. 
By then it was about 9:00, so I walked a half block to a coffee shop to wait until 10:00, when the nearby outfitters opened. I figured they could help me. 
As I was sitting outside in the warm sunshine enjoying my latte, I checked my phone. Three or four new emails were in my inbox, including the one from Alison, which she had sent the previous night. My provider must have had a glitch, causing me to receive the emails long after they had been sent. I called the driver Alison had recommended and told him I’d meet him at the outfitters. 
A half hour later, the driver called. He had gone to an outfitters in another town. He showed up about a half hour later, and I finally made it back to the trail. It was 11:00 a.m.
Later that day, I realized it would probably be dark before I made it to a shelter, and I really didn’t want to walk in the dark. I also didn’t relish the idea of tenting in an area known for bear activity. So I called a driver from Front Royal, and he said he’d meet me at a parking lot near Hogback Overlook at 6:00, then drive me to a B and B four miles from Front Royal. I told him I’d prefer to stay in town, but he emphasized the benefits of the B and B, such as its closeness to the trail. I said okay. I just wanted a ride, and figured I could work out the details later. 
A few minutes after I arrived at the parking lot excited about my bear encounter, the driver pulled into the lot. He then drove me to the B and B, which turned out to be a small hostel. By the time I showered and ate a frozen pizza, it was time for bed. I had a hard time sleeping on the narrow bed, and decided I’d head into town on the following day. 
It had been a memorable day. The fiasco of getting out of town. Worrying about walking in the dark. Contacting the shuttle drivers. Seeing a bear. I wondered what tomorrow would bring.","Thornton Gap

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611573,"On a cooler and cloudy morning, the shuttle driver returned me to the parking lot near Hogback Overlook so I could slack pack north to the trailhead near the hostel. It would be the longest day for me so far, almost 17 miles. 
Of course, there were a couple of long uphills, but my legs are getting stronger. Carrying just a few pounds helped also. The trail followed a forest road for a mile or two, which was easy walking. The last descent to the trailhead, though, was covered in rocks. At any rate, I made it back to the hostel about 5:30.
I explained to Scott, the hostel owner, that I was going to move to a motel in town so I’d be near restaurants and other shops. He understood completely and was extremely cordial about it. I paid him for two nights, even though I had stayed only one. He drove me to town and dropped me off at the motel. 
After the usual (shower and laundry), I walked across the street for some bbq and beer. I was tired, and my legs and feet were sore, so I was asleep before 10:00. 
As for hostels, I have nothing against them. Usually, though, they are for young people on a limited budget. I am neither. If I can stay at a motel near stores and restaurants, I’ll do that almost every time. The exception recently was Stanimal’s in Waynesboro. But it’s a huge house, complete with living room, massage chair, hikers’ fridge, and the like. Also, it’s located in town near shops and restaurants.

It threatened rain in the morning, but soon cleared off and warmed up. I ended up walking in shorts and a t-shirt. It was not an especially difficult walk, even though it included a long, gradual uphill. I reached a meadow, which was a beautiful stretch of trail. About halfway through the meadow was a bench by the side of the trail, so I sat down and took a break. 
The last couple of miles were downhill, and I made it back to the trailhead about 3:00. After arriving back in town, I showered, then walked to a brew pub on Main Street. I enjoyed a couple of beers and a sandwich. I think I’m getting fat from eating all this town food. I know I’m getting spoiled sleeping in beds, but I’m not complaining.","Ted Lake Trail

It was a rainy afternoon, so I did laundry and relaxed. After it cleared off, I walked to the Virginia Beer Museum, which is in Front Royal. It’s an interesting place, and has a bar. I enjoyed a couple of beers while talking with a local 75-year-old lawyer. I then walked through the museum, which has some spectacular displays relating to beer. In the beer garden out back was a bbq, so I ate my dinner outside. 
Tomorrow I’ll head back to the trail with a full pack and finish my time in Virginia. I should be at Harper’s Ferry in three or four days. Of course, first I have to negotiate the Roller Coaster, a difficult section in northern Virginia. I’m sure I’ll write about it when I deal with it.","

Second, the walk through Sky Meadows State Park was excellent. The terrain was not difficult, and many day hikers were out enjoying the weather and the park, which had beautiful views and walks through meadows. Third, Spring has arrived! The trees suddenly have leaves, and wildflowers are blooming everywhere. I suppose being at a lower elevation has something to do with it, but it seems as if Spring broke out overnight. 
I started at Ted Lake Trail and followed it back to the AT, then headed north, finishing the hike at Rod Hollow Shelter. A group of five weekend hikers were playing cards at the covered picnic table near the shelter, and a group of Boy Scouts were tenting nearby. The Scouts were preparing for a trip to Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico later this year. I told them I had done that about 50 years ago. It was my first extended backpacking experience.

I felt good at noon and thought that this wasn’t so bad. However, I suffered in the afternoon. I hit a wall. The terrain got to me, and my whole body was tired and sore.

However, I was mentally finished with Virginia, even if I physically was still in it until the next day. 
The trail generally followed a ridge for most of the day, some of it quite rocky. I made it to the shelter, then had to walk the quarter mile downhill to get water. It’s a nice shelter, but the walk to the water is brutal. 
It was rather cold and windy that evening, so the other hikers and I were in our bags before sundown. Even though I had met some of them on the trail the past few days, nobody wanted to stay up and talk in the chilly wind.

After a shower and laundry, I walked up to the headquarters of The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), where I checked in. They took my picture in front of the outside wall, which is a tradition, then placed my pic in an album for posterity. They also offered some food and gave me information about the town. The volunteers who work there cater to the hikers, and I appreciate what they do.

I came into Boiling Springs in the late morning and walked to a restaurant for a late breakfast. It took a while, but it was worth it. Then it was an easy walk to Carlisile. Part of the trail passed through farmlands and pastures, complete with farm houses, silos, and grain bins. It reminded me of the farmland where I grew up in northwest Missouri. Memories of walking on the farm came to mind. 
I arrived in Carlisile by early afternoon, where I walked to a motel to check in. After the usual shower and laundry, I walked to a nearby restaurant for steak and seafood buffet. Then it was back to a night sleeping in a real bed with clean sheets.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

A lot of day hikers and runners were out enjoying these conditions on a beautiful Saturday morning. 
A few times the scent of wildflowers wafted in the air. Their colors added to the idyllic scene. Part of the trail followed a river. I felt lucky to be out on such an outstanding day in the woods. 
Back at the motel, I got a driver to drop me off at a walk-in clinic to check out my cold. They surmised that I only had a viral infection that should go away soon. I wanted to confirm that I didn’t have bronchitis or something like that. I didn’t feel bad, but was tired of the flu-like symptoms.

Sounds like an awful day to be on the trail. After my experiences in March, 2018, I’m not eager to be out in such awful conditions. 
I assume you’ve heard about the tragedy that happened on the trail in Virginia over the weekend. If you haven’t, you can google it for more information. At any rate, one hiker was murdered and another critically injured by a mentally unstable person. This has affected all of us on the trail. It’s hard to believe that something like that can happen out here. I know I’m safer on the trail than I am in a car on a highway, but this type of thing makes you think.

It was built in the 1770s, and is an historic building. It could use a lot of TLC (and cleaning), but I’m enjoying the ambiance of the place. My room is small, but serviceable. For $25, what can you expect? And having a bar and restaurant on the first floor is a plus. I have an affinity for dive bars, and this place definitely fits the bill. 
It was cloudy and cool most of the day, and rocks littered a lot of the trail. After a short climb from the road crossing, the trail followed a ridge most of the day. Mud and rocks were par for the day, even though the elevation changes were minimal. The decent to Duncannon was steep and rocky, and most of the downward trail had rock steps. 
After arriving at lower elevation, I was surprised by Fresh Ground, a famous trail angel. He made me a grilled cheese sandwich as I relaxed in a lawn chair. I met him last year after descending from Max Parch in bitter cold temperatures. He remembered me and the other hikers I was walking with back then. 
After a short walk, I arrived at the Doyle and checked in. After a shower, it was a trip to the laundromat, then back to the Doyle for a burger and a beer.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613919,"This evening, I and the six or seven other hikers at Peters Mountain Shelter experienced some of the best trail magic ever. We had finished eating and were sitting around talking when a hiker showed up. Well, we thought he was a “normal” hiker. He asked if we’d help him lighten his pack. Someone jokingly said only if he had a margarita machine he wanted to unload. He responded, “No margaritas, but how about rum and cokes?”  He then started pulling cokes, two water bottles full of rum, snacks, and fruit including a fresh pineapple from his pack. We were initially dumbfounded, but soon realized he was a trail angel, or a trail magician as he called himself. 
Eddie, who is married with kids, lives and works in the area. A few times a year he packs up goodies and hikes three miles from a parking lot with a heavy pack to the shelter. He has too many responsibilities to thru-hike the trail, but is quite familiar with it and likes to help out hikers when he can. He stayed for at least an hour, talking with us and encouraging us to eat and drink. The fresh pineapple he cut up was particularly tasty. And I think all of us enjoyed the rum and coke. It is definitely a surprising experience I’ll never forget. 
Early in the morning, I left the Doyle and had breakfast at a diner across the street. Then it was about two miles street walking, as the trail weaved through Duncannon and crossed the Susquehanna River. After that, an uphill climb in the woods led to some of the famous Pennsylvania rocks. It was slow going as I negotiated the obstacle, stepping between and on rocks. 
On the ridge line, the trail was sometimes an easy walk on a smooth trail, and other times it was sections of small and large rocks. The smaller rocks can be sharp, so I did my best to avoid them. However, my feet and ankles were definitely affected. 
I stopped at a shelter for lunch, where I also got water. A young section hiker was zeroing at the shelter, so we talked while I ate. After that, it was a fairly easy walk to the two-story shelter where I spent the night. I think Eddie’s visit helped me get a good night’s sleep.","The Doyle Hotel

Jui Jui, from Tennessee, is supporting her husband on his thru hike. She was in the parking lot waiting for him, and had snacks and cokes. She also made me a peanut butter sandwich. I’m getting lucky with this trail magic stuff, but I’m sure not complaining. 
After the parking lot, I was greeted with a two-mile uphill. Once on the ridge line, the trail alternated between easy sections and rock-covered areas. However, the rock sections were not as bad as I had expected. Mud patches also were abundant, and my shoes and pant legs became wet and muddy.

Beavers decided to build a dam alongside the trail about a mile north of the Rausch Gap Shelter. The overflow from the dam floods the trail for about 100 yards, creating a watery, muddy mess. There is an alternate 1.6 mile trail around the area of the dam. When I reached that point, I started walking down the bypass. I took about ten steps and stopped. “Wait a minute,” I told myself. “You came out here to walk the Appalachian Trail. By every white blaze. And so far you’ve done that. So, don’t be a wuss. The dam can’t be that bad.” I then turned around and walked back to the trail. 
When I came to the dam, I realized there was nothing to do except walk through it. The water was about six inches deep, but when I stepped in it, my feet would sink at least another six inches in the muck. I just laughed and figured this may be the only time in my life I get to do this. It wasn’t as bad as the stories about it had been, but it wasn’t pleasant. However, I was so glad I did it. I still haven’t missed a white blaze that I know of. 
Around noon I came to I-81, and sat on a bench to eat lunch. After walking under the interstate, it was a fairly brutal climb up to a ridge line. It was rather steep and rocky. The heat and humidity didn’t help, but at least it wasn’t cold. I came to the shelter, where some flip-floppers were eating dinner. I enjoyed talking with them as I ate and prepared my bed.

Most of the trail was clear, but there was one section of large, jumbled rocks, which made for slow going. As I was stumbling through that section, I met a day hiker who mentioned the “rock rapids.” I decided that’s a good way to describe these sections. It’s like canoeing. For a while the river is nice and smooth, and you’re relaxing as you easily move along. Then comes a section of rapids, where you have to concentrate and work hard to negotiate the fast moving stream. Your muscles tighten, and you’re extremely careful. Although the rock sections are slower rather than faster, as rapids are, the analogy seems to work, and I may use that term in the future. I just hope the rock rapids don’t last all day. I’ve heard the rock sections are much worse a bit farther up the trail. 
I came to route 501, where I caught a ride to a motel in Pine Grove. It had been a short day, but there’s a reason for that. 
I’m taking a planned hiatus from the trail for a couple of weeks. I’ll be renting a car and driving back to Missouri to visit family and friends. I’ll also attend my 50th (yes, 50th!) high school reunion. I told you I was an old fart. Additionally, I have a couple of doctors’ appointments scheduled during this time, just to make sure I’m healthy enough to finish this journey.

I drove back to the Kansas City area to visit family and friends and to attend my 50th high school reunion. It was interesting to see my old (well, not that old!) classmates. Many of them were interested in the trail, and, as I always say, I told them, “I can bore you with trail stories for hours.” I related a few of the highlights and answered questions. I also learned about their lives and what they’re doing nowadays.I spent some time with my wonderful sister and brother-in-law. We drove around the area north of Kansas City to see the horrible flooding that’s happening there. My older brother and his new wife were also there, so we all got to meet her for the first time.
I saw my doctor and found out my cholesterol is lower than it’s ever been. My other numbers look good, too. If nothing else, walking 8 or 10 hours a day will get you in shape, even if you eat junk food. 


Tomorrow morning I’ll hit the trail where I left off. Since I didn’t get much exercise during my hiatus, I’m sure I’ll be sore. Hopefully, though, it won’t take long for me the get back into trail shape.

Thankfully, the trail was fairly easy, except for the rock sections. Some parts slithered between dense vegetative on either side, and generally these areas were not rock covered. Other sections consisted of rocks of all shapes and sizes, significantly slowing my progress. I was happy to finally reach the turnoff for the shelter after walking more then 15 miles. Not bad for my first day back out there. 


I must be between bubbles, since I only met one other hiker. Aladdin was an interesting young man from Texas. He and I ate lunch at one of the few overlooks in this area, talking about the trail, our lives, and anything else that crossed our minds.

I made the long steep downhill to Port Clinton and Hamburg, then caught a ride to a motel. After the usual (shower and laundry), I walked across the highway to visit the world’s largest Cabela’s. Since I’m neither a hunter nor a fisherman, it wasn’t very exciting for me, but it was interesting to see the wildlife displays and the aquarium.

Of course, there were rocks, but nothing too hard. After ridge walking for a while, there was a descent followed by seven hundred feet up to Pulpit Rock. The last quarter of a mile was covered in large boulders, which slowed me down. I kept my eyes out looking for snakes, especially around the large rocks at the top. I didn’t see any, but I knew they were around.
A couple of miles later was the Pinnacle, another rocky area that’s popular with day hikers, especially because it offers a nice view of the valley below. After that it was a ridiculously easy walk to the Eckville Shelter. I assume the trail was on an old forest service road, as it was an almost rockless gradual downhill to the shelter. 


I came to a road crossing and walked the .2 mile to the Eckville Shelter, which is unlike any other shelter I’ve stayed in. It’s actually a small building behind the caretaker’s house. Inside are six bunks and a table. Nearby is a small building complete with a flush toilet and solar-heated shower. Several people were tenting on the other side of the road, but I bunked down inside the four-walled structure. A while later Aladdin, a young man from Texas whom I’ve met before, arrived and also set up in the shelter.

Of course, much of the trail was rock-laden, especially as I neared the top. The area around Dan’s Pulpit was covered with large rocks that really slowed me down, especially since the area is known to be habituated by rattlesnakes and copperheads. 



Three local guys wearing high topped boots and carrying forked poles were there hunting snakes. I don’t think they killed or captured them, but apparently like spending Saturdays finding snakes. They had three copperheads by a rock I had to cross. I glanced over the side and briefly saw one of them. That was enough for me! They scare me more than the fear of falling in the rocks. I continued on, being extremely careful to inspect every cranny before setting my foot between the rocks. It gives me the willies just thinking about it.
As I continued, the trail became easier at times with rock patches interspersed. Along the way, a young hiker passed me and we talked a bit. We then realized we had met last year in a hostel during a snow storm. We had played a dice game, and I think he barely beat me. Crispy Cream (his trail name) broke his leg after we had met, and is back this year to complete the hike. It’s amazing what happens on the trail sometimes. 


I arrived at a nice shelter right off the trail in mid-afternoon. I was exhausted. I think the stress of the rocks and snakes took it out of me. I had considered pushing on to a campsite, but decided to stop early and give my body a break.

I felt rested this morning as I headed out for the day. The first six miles were incredibly easy. It was a flat, mostly rock- free stretch without any long ups or downs. However, that soon changed. 


Knife’s Edge is an infamous 200-yard stretch that crosses large, jumbled rocks that somewhat resemble the edge of a dull knife. I went extremely slowly, especially so because snakes live in the area. I had to scramble in some areas, and a couple of times I actually crawled on my hands and knees to insure I didn’t fall. There was a beautiful view along the way, but I was too engrossed in my progress to linger to enjoy the vista. It was a slow traversal, but I finally reached the end, scrambling down to the run-of-the-mill large rocks, which gave way to smaller rocks after a short walk. My knees were shaking, and I could feel the adrenaline flowing in my veins. But I was elated. I hadn’t fallen, and I had actually done the Knife’s Edge. 


Rain and thunderstorms were predicted for the next day, so I decided to take it off. There’s no way I wanted to walk on all those rocks in the rain. Besides, my body needed a break. With that in mind, I called a shuttle when I arrived at Bake Oven Road, who took me to a motel in Lehighton. 


After the usual, I walked to a nearby bar/restaurant. I immediately began enjoying the time there, with the bantering between the local patrons. I told them some trail stories as I ate an excellent meal with an IPA. One guy even bought me a beer. This is the first time I’ve felt as if I’m in New England. The accents and attitudes have that aura to them. People are much more upfront, not afraid to let you know what they think. But they’re just as nice and friendly as people are everywhere.

I had Tracy drive me to Bert’s on the way to the trailhead so I could claim a bunk for the night and unload most of my stuff, which allowed me to slack pack into Palmerton. I was planning on staying at Bert’s that night anyway, so why carry a full pack when I didn’t have to?


After getting back on the trail, the first order of business was to tackle Bake Oven Knob. Some people say this section is more difficult than Knife’s Edge, and they may well be right. I wasn’t expecting to have to negotiate another set of rocks like that. Large boulders were all jumbled together, and the going was slow. I made it without falling, but it was not easy. 


After that the trail leveled and was relatively clear of rocks in some sections. It was good to be able to motivate without constantly stumbling over rocks. 


I stopped around noon and sat down on a rock to eat my lunch. While eating, I noticed a couple of hikers heading towards me. I let out a whoop because I recognized my buddy Nate. I knew he was about to catch up with me, but wasn’t sure when it would be. He introduced me to his hiking partner, Shark Tooth, and we talked a while. They were also planning on staying at Bert’s, so we said we’d meet up in town. 


Nate and I met two years ago when we both signed up for a section hike with a group in the Smokies. We found out we grew up about 30 miles from each other, as he’s from St. Joseph. Any South Holt people who might be reading this should know that Nate’s favorite high school teacher was Doug Meng, and his football coach was Scott Marriott. Anyway, he and I have remained friends, talking on the phone every few months. He retired this year after 23 years in the Army, much of it in combat areas, and decided to walk the trail. 


We enjoyed an evening in Palmerton, visiting the creamery for hot dogs and shakes, followed by dinner at a restaurant.

It was good to see so many people out getting exercise and enjoying the day with their kids and dogs. Eventually, the trail became rockier and more difficult.

One guy who passed me by griped about the boring trail, mosquitos, low elevation, heat, and rocks. He finally said, ""Well, I guess you can complain about everything."" I think the Pennsylvania rocks take it out of you. It's discouraging to have to move so slowly and to have the bottoms of your feet hurt from walking on rocks for miles. I'm trying to keep a good attitude, but it's easy to get down. I try to remember Sunshine from last year and her positive spirit. I think of her about every day because she was always up, no matter how crappy things sometimes were. I know it will get better. Maybe this is the part I've heard about, where people just say ""the heck with it! This is just stupid and boring."" I'll work through it, and things will get better. I keep reminding myself that I should be finished within three months, and when it's over, I will miss it. 
I made it to Brink's Shelter, where three other hikers were also staying. It's a recently rebuilt shelter, and has a nice porch out front. Everybody was so tired that we all went to bed about 7:30, even before the sun set. Maybe tomorrow will be better.","Mohican Outdoor Center

I had planned on walking several more miles than I did, but realized that, since I wanted to take a zero day the next day, I should get a ride from the busy highway at Culvers Gap. I was tired anyway, so decided to call it a day when I reached the road. I walked up the road to a nearby restaurant, and was just about to walk in when a pickup pulled up beside me  and a voice yelled out  ""Vagabond Jack!"" I turned around expecting to see a familiar face from the trail, but didn't recognize the guy. Instead, it was Dave King, who follows me on Facebook and on this journal. He lives in the area and happened to be driving by when he saw me and recognized me. 
We talked a few minutes, then he offered to drive me to a motel, which was about ten miles out of his way. I had planned on calling a shuttle driver, but I took him up on his offer. He dropped me off at the motel, and I couldn't thank him enough. He's truly a  trail angel! He told me how he's been working on his well-being, having lost a lot of weight over the past couple of years. He exercises a lot, including walking on sections of the trail. He hopes to do a thru-hike someday, and I sure hope he does. I still can't believe my luck. I'll forever be grateful for his largesse. Thanks,  Dave!
After a shower and laundry, I walked to the nearby restaurant for a nice meal. Since it's supposed to rain all day tomorrow, I plan on taking it easy. Also,  it's a reward to myself for finally being out of Pennsylvania!","Brink's Shelter

It was foggy and muggy all day with rain threatening. I saw several hikers, and, as opposed to last weekend, everyone seemed to be in a good mood. Although there were some easy sections of trail, it became worse in the afternoon, with many rocks of all sizes covering the trail. One short downhill was particularly treacherous, with big rocks still wet from the recent rains and the fog. It reminded me a lot of Pennsylvania. There were a lot of small ups and downs, but nothing too drastic. 


I eventually arrived at the High Point State Park Headquarters building, where I called a local motel. A few minutes later they picked me up and drove me to the motel. After checking in, they did my laundry for me (for a fee). I ordered food from a local Italian place, then turned in after eating. I’m getting spoiled by sleeping in real beds and eating town food. That’s ok. I’ll have plenty more nights on the trail, sleeping on an air mattress and eating not-so-good food.","Culvers Gap

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616872,"It was another foggy and humid day in New Jersey. The rocks continued for the first part of the morning. I saw a copperhead nestled between two large rocks as I descended from High Point, and it scared me, but I stayed far enough away to keep out of danger. 



The trail finally became rock free, and one long section was especially nice as it passed through fields and by farm ponds. Maybe the trail will stay that way for a while. It would be nice to be able to not walk on rocks for a while.
It was supposed to rain all afternoon and evening (but hasn’t yet), so I decided to visit Jim Murray’s “Secret Shelter.” Mr. Murray completed a thru hike 30 years ago. After doing so, he bought some land beside the trail and built a small cabin where hikers can stay. It’s not an official AT shelter, but in many ways is much nicer than the normal shelter. Well water is available, and electrical outlets inside allow hikers to charge their phones. The place is so peaceful, except for Jake the donkey who insists on being petted. He’s quite funny. I’m glad I stopped here. 


My other option would have been to walk another couple of miles to Unionville, NY. The town doesn’t have any motels, but allows hikers to camp in the park. Mr. Murray said he had been in town, and 25 or 30 hikers are camped there. Everybody wants to be out of the rain when it arrives. I imagine a few more hikers will be at this shelter tonight, but for now I have it to myself. 


The trail has been practically on the NJ/NY border today, and will continue to be so for a while. In fact, I’ll be sleeping in New York tonight. However, officially, the trail is in New Jersey for the next 23 miles. I hope to cross the state line on Saturday.","High Point State Park Headquarters

A .4 mile road walk off the trail took me to a general store with a large front porch. Brandon, who had stayed in the secret shelter, was drinking coffee on the porch. I bought something for breakfast along with coffee, then joined him on the porch, where we relaxed and talked for the better part of an hour as we watched the rain. I headed out in the rain, which stopped by late morning. The sun came out and it turned out to be a nice afternoon. 



The landscape varied from walking through fields, to climbing over jumbled rocks, to normal ups and downs, to road walking. At one point, the trail was along a national wildlife refuge, where I saw two swans lazily paddling around in a lagoon. Back in the woods, there was a lot of walking on wet boards, which, even though they were slick from the morning rain, alleviated the need to walk through marshy areas. 
As I neared the town of Vernon, the trail became a wide boardwalk through marsh lands. This is one of the few handicap-accessible sections of the trail, and continues for about a mile. After coming to Vernon, I called a nearby motel that offers a pickup service. Brandon showed up later at the motel, so we had another good conversation, after which I caught a ride to a restaurant. I was exhausted by the time I returned to my room, so I slept well.","Jim Murray’s “Secret Shelter”

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617277,"The first business of the day was climbing the “Stairway to Heaven,” a climb of almost 1000 feet over about a mile. This is a popular hike, and a lot of day hikers were out there. One gave me a fast food breakfast sandwich, and another gave me a Power Aid drink. I appreciated both of the acts of kindness.
It took me a while to complete the uphill, and after that, it was generally normal ups and downs for about eight miles. As I neared the New York border, the trail became rather difficult. I was forced to scramble to get up some rocks. This type of trail continued after I crossed in New York. I’d walk on big flat rocks for a while, then have to descend, often having to use my hands for the short down. After walking a short distance, I’d be confronted with another large rock I’d have to scramble up. 



The frequent scrambles made for slow going, and they really took it out of me. I’m not much of a rock climber. I don’t like it, and it scares me. I know I’ll have to deal with it in New Hampshire and Maine, but I wasn’t expecting it in New York. I know some people enjoy that type of activity, but it’s never appealed to me.
It had been a rough day, so when I saw another guy tenting near Cascade Brook, I decided to stop there also. I was bone tired by the time I set up my tent and did my other chores. As I lay in my sleeping bag, I could hear a band playing in the valley below at Greenwood Lake. It was a weird juxtaposition of sleeping in the woods and hearing civilization so close.","Vernon, NJ

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617278,"Even though I didn’t even walk ten miles, it was a rough day. I faced several areas that required scrambling, including the Eastern Pinnacles and Cat Rocks. At least it wasn’t raining, because these climbs and descents would be particularly treacherous when wet. 


Around noon, I took a trail to a shelter to get water and eat lunch. As I sat at the picnic table, I started noticing the beauty of the surrounding woods. It was quiet and peaceful, and I let myself truly enjoy the area. Sometimes you just have to relax and enjoy the trail instead of worrying about what’s ahead and how many miles you can do. 


Later I passed Fitzgerald Falls, a beautiful spot popular with day hikers. The uphill beside the falls was steep, but didn’t last long. Some day hikers and their dogs were playing in the water at the bottom of the falls. 


A former thru hiker had set up a table with all kinds of food near a road crossing. It was wonderful to eat fruit, cake, donuts, etc. I needed that pick-me-up. Again, the trail provides. I appreciate his willingness to spend money on food and to take a Sunday afternoon to feed dirty, hungry hikers. 


I had planned to go to East Mombasha Road, but was so beat that I stopped at West Mombasha Road, where I called a cab to drive me to a budget motel. A gas station, where I could pick up a few needed items, was nearby. It was a clean, but simple room, and I slept well after a shower and delivered Chinese food.","Cascade Brook

After a long, but generally rock-free, uphill, I came to the infamous Lemon Squeezer. This a short section where the trail passes through a V-shaped rock formation. It’s quite narrow, and some people take off their packs and hold them over their heads to negotiate it. I plowed through wearing my pack, but it was a tight fit. At one point, I was almost stuck, but I forced myself forward. The water bottles on either side of my pack grated the sides, but I emerged unscathed. It was actually a lot of fun. 


Immediately after that, I came to a vertical wall about eight or nine feet high. A blue-blazed “Easy Way” trail avoided the climb, but you know me. Of course, I didn’t take the easy way. I had to throw my trekking poles to the top, then realized I’d have to take off my pack and push it up there also, which I did. Then, using all my strength, I slowly used hand grips while stepping on small ledges in the rocks to hoist myself up. It was a challenge, but I made it. After reaching the top, I sat down for at least five minutes to gather myself. My whole body was exhausted from that little climb, but I was glad I had done it. 


After that, it was a fairly easy walk to Tiorati Circle near a large state park beach. I got a coke and ice cream bar from machines, and waited for a cab. Since it was supposed to rain the next day, and I needed a day off anyway, I decided to zero on Tuesday. 


I’ve felt extremely tired the past few days. I think the rocks and scrambles have taken a toll on my energy. My legs have been tired, and I just need a rest. Maybe I’m not eating enough protein. Anyway, a comfortable king-sized bed in a decent motel should help.","West Mombasha Road

I stopped at a shelter to eat lunch and get water. It was peaceful, and I enjoyed sitting in the quiet of the forest. 


After that, it was the climb up Black Mountain. I sweat a lot in the hot sun, but made it to the top glad that it was a clear day. That’s because I was rewarded with a view of the New York City skyline in the distance. I’d heard about this place before , and was pleased that it wasn’t cloudy or foggy. I tried imagining all those millions of people there, not that far away. And there I was, alone on a mountain top, looking at the metropolis in the distance. I was rather glad I wasn’t there in the noisy hustle and bustle. 


I then descended to the Palisades Parkway, which is a divided four-lane speedway of cars heading into and out of NYC. Some hikers call it Frogger, after the old video game. I waited for an opening and crossed the first two lanes. 


I made the mistake of walking on the median almost half a mile to a visitor’s center, where I used the bathroom and bought a coke and something to eat. I realized later I had used too much time and energy during that little excursion. I should have just kept walking instead. Anyway, I walked back to the trail, crossed the other two lanes, and headed into the woods. 


After some more climbs and descents, I began a three-mile gradual uphill to Bear Mountain. I finally made it, and was rewarded with a coke machine on top. This is a popular tourist destination, and many people were milling about, since you can drive up to the apex. I then began the mile downhill to the Bear Mountain Inn, where I was staying that night. 




The downhill had a few hundred wide, shallow stone steps. I can’t imagine the time and effort it took to install all of them. It made for an easy descent down the rather steep incline.
The trail goes right beside the Inn, so I checked in and got a shower. After that, I went to the bar/restaurant for food and beer. I started talking with Tasha and Jason from Florida. They had finished a section hike and were heading home the next day. We talked about hiking, then Jason made an offer. If I promised to finish my hike, they’d buy my dinner and beers. I couldn’t pass up a deal like that! So, now I’m obligated to those two trail angels to reach Katahdin. I do appreciate their generosity and encouragement.","Tiorati Circle

It actually goes through a zoo, which is really a sanctuary for local animals that have injury or illness. However, the zoo doesn’t open until 10:00 a.m.  A blue-blazed trail bypasses the zoo, but I decided to soak up the experience and thus wait until close to 10:00 before leaving the Inn. 



The sanctuary had very few animals. Two foxes, a bobcat, a bear, and a couple of other small animals. I’m glad, though, that I waited to walk through it. It was a nice diversion from the usual trail. The zoo is also the lowest elevation in the AT. So I’ve been to the highest point (Clingman’s Dome) and the lowest point.
Immediately after leaving the sanctuary, I walked across the Hudson River, then up into the woods. It was generally a good trail, with the occasional rock patches. The ups and downs were not difficult, even though it was rather warm and humid. 


In the middle of the afternoon, I came to an oasis: a gas station/convenience store right on the trail. I sat there for about an hour and a half, drinking cokes, eating hot dogs and other stuff, and talking with other hikers. I decided to enjoy the day, beginning with the zoo, even though it meant fewer miles. 


I finally got up and walked another half mile to a road that led to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center. This Catholic establishment allows hikers to tent for free on a ball field. I walked the half mile to the field, which had a pavilion with electricity, porta potties, water, and trash cans. At least a dozen hikers were tenting in the field, but I made my bed on top of one of the picnic tables inside the pavilion. Another guy came in later and camped on the pavilion floor.

It seemed as if I’d climb up the side of a hill then go back into the low area, then climb back up the side of the same hill, but not crossing over. Some areas were relatively easy, but other sections, of course, had some rocks. 



The heat and humidity added to the discomfort. I don’t mean to complain all the time, but it was not an easy day. At a road crossing was a shed with a spigot on the side with potable water available for hikers. I filled up, then doused my head. It helped cool me off, at least for a while. It also reminded me that the trail provides. I needed that.
I made it to Canopus Lake, a state park that provides a free area for hikers to tent, real bathrooms, and showers. There is also a concession stand, although the grill was off by the time I arrived. I was able to buy some sodas, snacks, and ice cream. 


Another hiker whom I’d run into during the day was there, and we decided to camp in an area closer to the concession stand than was the field set aside for tenting. There were picnic tables in this area, so I decided to sleep on one, and the other hiker set up his tent on another. After that, I walked up to the bathrooms and took a quick shower. It felt good after a long, hot day. 


Just before sundown, a park worker came by and told us we couldn’t camp there. So, we packed up and moved to the field for tenting, where about a dozen others were also camping. As it turned out, I’m glad he made us move because, not fifteen minutes after setting up my tent, it began pouring rain.

An unusual shelter, which used to be a cabin, is near some houses. I stopped to eat lunch there, and a local guy who lives nearby talked with me for a while. He surveys people with this question: “Do you think most people are nice?”  I answered in the affirmative, and he said most people do. We had a short but interesting conversation. I then moved on up the trail. 


I came to NY Route 52 in the afternoon and walked about a mile down the road to a deli and pizza place. These are two separate establishments sharing the same building. The people in the deli are extremely hiker friendly. The pizza guy has a reputation for hating hikers. However, he has the only bathroom in the area. Also, tenting is allowed behind the building, but you have to wait until after 8:00 to set up. That’s when the pizza place closes and the guy leaves. 


I ate a deli sandwich, then found a tenting site about a quarter of a mile away, hidden by some trees. After pitching my tent, I returned to the establishments. I went into the pizza joint, bought a piece of pizza and a soda, and was as friendly as possible to the guy. However, after eating, he wouldn’t let me use the bathroom. I kindly thanked him and left.

Before the brief afternoon storm, it was a fairly easy walk. The trail was generally free of rocks and obstacles, and there were several small dips and rises. I passed near Nuclear Lake in the early afternoon, then headed back into the woods, surrounded by tall evergreen trees. The smell of pine filled the air, and, even though it was rather hot and muggy, it was a nice walk. 


All of a sudden, the sky turned dark, and lightening and thunder began. The wind picked up, and it started pouring rain. Then the hail hit. I could only laugh about it. It definitely cooled everything down. 


Fortunately, the storm was short-lived. I then descended to a road crossing near Pawling, NY, where the largest oak tree on the trail is located.

The trail meandered a while along a picturesque stream before heading up Mt. Race, about 1000 feet up in two miles. It was a long uphill, but I took it slowly, and was rewarded with fine views at the top while walking on the rocky, open ledge.


After another descent, it was time for the grueling climb of Mt. Everett. In about a half of a mile, the trail ascended 800 feet, much of it on steep flat rocks. Thankfully, trail maintainers have bolted wooden steps into some of the slanted rocks to help with the footing. I was definitely feeling it after finally reaching the summit. 


I was planning on stopping early at a shelter, but instead called a shuttle driver who would pick me up at Jug End Road and drive me to Great Barrington, so I hustled three more miles. It was a steep, rocky downhill to the road, much of it on flat, slanted rocks covered in pine needles. Even with the slick footing, I made it to the road about 5:30.

I bought two cokes; one for then, and one for after I stopped for the night.
A long, gradual climb of 1000 feet followed, after which it was ridge walking the rest of the day. There were some nice views at the top of the uphill, but it was mostly walking on a good trail in the woods. 


The water source at the shelter was a steep quarter of a mile downhill, and I fell on the way down. Fortunately, I was not seriously injured. There were several hikers tenting, but I, being lazy, stayed in the shelter. I’d rather do that than set up a tent.","Jug End Road

Yet, in one section, three or four campsites and shelters were within a few miles of each other. 


At any rate, I stopped about 3:00 to stay at the Shaker Campsite. I was glad I got there early, as it filled up later in the day. It’s a good site, with a privy and a bear box. It also has plenty of flat spots for pitching a tent. 


It was a rather uneventful day. There were the usual ups and downs, and I passed by a couple of beaver ponds. The temperature was in the low 80s, but I still sweated a lot on the uphills. 


I’m seeing some of the same hikers in the campsites, and it’s been good to get to know some of the interesting characters, such as Hulk Hogan, Pivot, and Gentle Ben. I kind of like being a loner, but making friends on the trail is one of the best parts of the experience.","Tom Leonard Shelter

It is run on the honor system, so I bought a couple of sodas and some other items, leaving money to pay for them. It’s a wonderful service, and it should be profitable for the owners. 


After that, I strolled through a pasture where cows were grazing. One of them stood right on the trail, reminding me of the ponies in Virginia. I petted her, ten she ambled away, munching on grass as she did so. 



Then it was a long uphill on a decent trail, which was typical for the day. There were some rocks in some sections, but, for the most part, it was a good trail with normal ups and downs. With temperature and humidity in the 70s, it was a pleasant day.
I didn’t stop at the Goose Pond Shelter, even though many people said I should do so since it’s a beautiful and unusual type of shelter with four walls and a caretaker.

Around 1:00, I stopped at a shelter to eat lunch. A handful of hikers were also there, eating and relaxing. A few minutes after I arrived, an older gentleman came up to the shelter and asked someone to cal 911. He said he didn’t feel right. Shortly after that, a hiker, who happened to be a former Army medic, showed up. He took over, telling the guy to loosen his clothing, take off his boots, and lie down with his feet up. Someone called 911, and a rescue team was on its way. 


I hung around a few minutes and offered to stay, but the medic and two other hikers said they would cover it, so I headed out. A quarter of a mile later, I met several EMTs and other rescuers on the trail. They were carrying a stretcher and other medical equipment. I found out later that he was safely transporting to a medical facility. I hope he’s ok. Some of us surmised later that he may have been suffering from dehydration. It would be easy for that to happen in this weather. Even though it doesn’t feel that hot, we still sweat a lot out here.

I’ll take Sunday off as a zero day, then my friends Schuyler and Jane will drive up from their home in Connecticut on Monday to shuttle me to Manchester. 


I walked about three miles into town, then headed down a street a few blocks off the trail. I had breakfast at a coffee shop, which a local trail angel was kind enough to buy for me, then walked around the corner to a motel. It was too early to check in, but I left my pack and poles in the lounge. 


After that, I returned to the trail and walked through Dalton to the trailhead about a mile away. It is where I began my section hike last year on my way to Manchester. The sun was bright, and it was a beautiful day as I strolled along, enjoying the well-kept homes in town. After reaching the trailhead, which I recognized from last year, I returned to the motel. 


After checking in, I did the usual, then went to a pharmacy inside a Target to refill prescriptions. I picked up a few things from the store, then returned to the motel. Several hikers were staying there, so we had trail conversations for a while.

In the middle of the afternoon, it started raining, making the ever-present rocks slick. The forecast called for thunderstorms, so I stopped a bit earlier than I had planned at the Greenwall Shelter. It was difficult to find water there, but I finally found a pool on a mainly dry stream bed. 



The large thunderstorms never arrived, but several people came into camp. Most of them tented, and I shared the shelter with one other hiker.

The cool weather helped make it an easy morning. I noticed the sun-dappled trail in front of me, along with the lush, green forest surrounding. The scent of pine filled the air, and I tried imagining how I had envisioned the trail before I began. For a while, my pre-trail romanticism aligned with reality. I often get too hung up in the struggle, the sweat and dirt, the aching muscles, the mosquitoes, worrying about making it to my destination, and all the other difficulties of being out here. But for a short while, I overlooked all the hardships and truly enjoyed the trail the way it should be. I hope I can do that more in the last section.
Around 1:00, I came to a road crossing and faced a decision. I could walk almost a mile up the road to a deli, or I could keep walking. Knowing it would cost me a couple of hours, I headed to the deli anyway. A young couple I met earlier on the trail were also walking there, so we ate sandwiches and enjoyed cold drinks on the porch in front. I bought another sandwich for dinner, then offered a guy in the parking lot $5 to drive me back to the trail head. He wouldn’t take any money, but was happy to shuttle me the mile. 


I wasn’t expecting it, but I was then faced with a brutal half-mile steep climb on rocks. It was so steep that I had to scramble a few times on the way up. I was sweating and tired by the time I reached the top. 


After a short downhill, it was another up followed by a descent. Then it was a gradual uphill to a shelter that was on the way up Killington Peak. I’d stop at the shelter, then complete the climb in the morning. 



Thankfully, the trail wasn’t too difficult, as I was hustling to make it to the shelter before dark. I figured I’d make it there by 8:00 at the latest, which would be a half hour before sundown. I stopped to get water in the way, but, other than that, didn’t take any breaks for two or three hours. I also hit the point that’s 500 miles to Katahdin. I arrived at the shelter about 7:45, and was glad to see people tenting instead of using it. A lady arrived about the same time I did, so we were the only two staying in the shelter.

That’s what the ascent to Killington Peak was like. It was a long, slow slog, but I finally reached the apex. It was foggy and cool, so that helped. However, the rocks were slick since they were wet. It’s condensation, I assume. 


Actually, the top of the mountain is another .2 mile up, but since the trail doesn’t go there, neither did I. There’s a restaurant there, but I was headed down to town, so I bypassed it. 


A shelter sits at the trail’s highest point on Killington, so I stopped there to rest and get water. Then it was about six miles down to a road crossing. It was not a nice, easy path on the way down, but not as difficult as the climb had been. It turned cooler, and when a breeze blew, I was almost cold. However, I met some people going the opposite direction, and they said it was brutally hot at the bottom. 


Of course, the AT doesn’t just descend even though you’re heading down. There were a few small climbs stuck in there. As I neared the bottom, the temperature began rising. By the time I reached the road, it was hot and humid. 


I was going to try to call a ride to get to a motel in Rutland, but a couple of trail angels were waiting to do magic. The first thing they asked me was if I needed a ride. The second question was if I’d like a cold Pepsi. Of course, I answered in the affirmative to both questions. Oak, who did a thru hike a few years ago, and Twin Oak had driven all the way from New Jersey to do trail magic. Once again, I was blown away by the kindness of strangers. 



They delivered me to a motel and we said goodbye. After checking in, I got a shower, then walked next door for dinner. After that, I went to do laundry in the motel. However, both machines were in use, so it was almost 10:00 before my clothes were clean and dry.
I still needed to go to the store across the street, but was too tired. I figured I’d do that in the morning, then try to get back to the trail by 9:00 or so. I must say I slept well on the bed. It’s much more comfortable than an air mattress.","Governor Clement Shelter

The Long Trail, which I believe is the oldest of the long distance trails in the US, travels from through Vermont, from the Massachusetts border to Canada. Shortly after Rutland, the AT heads east to New Hampshire while the Long Trail continues north. It was interesting meeting and talking with the Long Trail hikers, but they’re probably happy to have a trail all to themselves instead of sharing it with us AT folk.
A downhill took me to a state park/campground. At the office a hundred yards off the trail, I bought three cokes and two ice cream sandwiches. I saved one of the cokes for the evening, but downed the other two along with the ice cream. It was a nice mid-day break. 
The trail then passed by a pond and, a bit later, a waterfalls. It was a beautiful area, and a lot of day hikers were enjoying the warm Sunday afternoon there.
Then it was time for a rough mile and a half climb. Although there were switchbacks, it was a steep, difficult uphill. The heat and humidity didn’t help, and I was feeling it when I reached the top.
After that, it was down to a shelter, where several other hikers also stayed. One of them was a SOBO, or southbounder. (SOBOs start in Maine and walk to Georgia.) We were talking, and he noted that NOBOs seemed to be grouchy. I laughed and agreed with him. I told him I try to be positive, but sometimes it’s easy to get in a bad mood.

In mid-morning, the rain stopped and the sun came out. Fortunately, the trail wasn’t too sloppy, as the well-maintained path allowed most of the water to drain rather than sit in the trail. It became a bit steamy due to the humidity, but it was actually comfortable. 


A couple of hours later, I came to Route 12. Before the roadway, I walked through some grassy areas, some of which was quite overgrown. Occasionally, the weeds crowding the trail were higher than my head, so I just pushed through them. 


A store is about a quarter mile off the trail at Route 12, and I saw another hiker heading that way, so I also walked there. I’d read that the place is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, but tried it anyway, just in case. Alas, it was not open, but, when I saw the other hiker there, I was excited. It was a guy named iPhone. 


iPhone is possibly the most famous person on the trail this year. He’s Asian, and speaks no English, so he uses an app on his phone to translate, thus the name. He’s known to carry a heavy pack, always with a bright orange pack cover on, regardless of the weather. I’d heard he gets up extremely early in the morning and walks all day with few breaks. 


When I said “iPhone!” he smiled and we fist-bumped. I could tell he was also disappointed the store wasn’t open. We walked back to the trailhead, and began an ascent. Believe it or not, I was actually faster than he on the climb. He’s one of the very few people I’ve met that is slower than I am. However, he walks for so long every day, I’m sure he puts in more miles. 


I came up with a new term to describe the climb after Route 12: stupid steep. It was almost a mile of what felt like straight up. No rock climbing was required, but it was difficult. Also, the sun had warmed up the day, and I was sweating by the time I reached the top. I was glad to get that climb out of the way. 


After a couple of more ups and downs, I came to a road crossing. A quarter of a mile up the road led me to a farm house that has an honor-system set up on the back porch, similar to the Trail Stand from a few days back. I had a couple of cokes and bought one for the road. I also ate a homemade ice cream sandwich: two chocolate chip cookies surrounding a slab of homemade ice cream. It was scrumptious. 


A few more miles brought me to a shelter. It was 7:00 by the time I arrived, and after getting water and doing my chores, it was pushing 8:30. In the meantime, iPhone arrived and proceeded to set up his tent inside the shelter, something that is frowned upon. Since there was plenty of room, I didn’t mind. I climbed into my bag, but iPhone was up for quite some time, getting settled and eating his dinner. I drifted off to sleep later than I had hoped, but that was ok.

Even though it was still dark, I got up about 15 minutes later, and began my morning routine. The forest was barely becoming light when I hit the trail about an hour later, so I walked with my headlamp for a while just to make sure I didn’t trip on an unseen root or rock. I actually like getting up and being on the trail that early, but I usually can’t force myself to do so. I appreciated iPhone’s early morning wake up to get me moving. 


After four or five miles, I came to the small town of West Hartford, where road walking was required for a while. After crossing a bridge, I stopped at another back porch where people sell sodas and treats. I enjoyed both, including some watermelon. 


It was then time to face my last uphill in Vermont, a three-mile gradual climb that included several downhills and flat spots along the way. After summiting, it was basically downhill to New Hampshire. 


I reached Elm Street, which was not a nightmare, and started the three-mile road walk that would lead me to the Connecticut River, the boundary between the two states. I felt great as I walked across the bridge, stopping to take a picture of the state line. 


However, it had been hot and sunny in the afternoon. I know it was just a coincidence, but as soon as I stepped into New Hampshire, a cloud covered the sun, a breeze picked up, and it felt as if the temperature dropped by ten degrees. An omen? I think not, but it was weird. Actually, my trepidation about New Hampshire and the Whites seemed to fade the past couple of days. In fact, I’m ready mentally to take on the section. I know I’ll slow down, but my attitude now is “Bring it on!” I’ve met every challenge so far, and I plan on continuing to do so.

I had had a sensitive tooth the last couple of days in Vermont, but didn’t think much of it. I figured I had bitten on something at some point that must have caused a bit of temporary pain and that it would go away. When I went to bed Wednesday, I thought that the tooth was somewhat worse, but still planned on heading out Thursday morning. 


However, when I woke up Thursday, I realized something wasn’t right, and that I needed to get checked out. Luckily, a car rental place is next door to the motel, so I rented a car and drove to a nearby dentist office. They couldn’t work me in that day, but a branch office an hour away in Brattleboro, VT, could. So I headed out in the rental. 


Once there, they took X-rays, and I saw the dentist. I thought he’d have to remove the crown, fix the tooth, and put a temporary crown on. That would allow me to head out the next day, getting a permanent crown after finishing the trail. Alas, it was not to be. He told me I needed a root canal instead. He was honest with me; he could have done a lot of work and run up my bill, but he didn’t. He also didn’t charge me for the X-rays or exam. Another case of trail magic. 


Back at the motel, I called every endodontist in the area. The earliest I could get in was Monday for an exam, followed by the procedure on Wednesday. The end result is that I’m stuck in the Hanover area until at least Thursday. 


I’ve been relaxing and eating good town food. On Saturday afternoon, I caught a ride into Hanover and went to a movie. I also bought a book to help pass the time.

The walk out of Hanover was on a road for a while before heading into a woods. Then it was a steep climb up to Velvet Rocks. It was so steep that a knotted rope was tied to a tree at one place. I used the rope to pull myself up the steep incline.
In the late afternoon I came to a stream crossing that had several tenting spots nearby. I considered stopping there, but pushed on to a shelter. To get there, I first had to climb for 1.7 miles to the top of Moose Mountain South. It was a difficult ascent for me, and I had to stop often to remove my pack, sit down, and rest. I averaged less than one mile an hour on the climb, and I was exhausted. 


After that, it was almost a mile to the shelter over small ups and downs. Again, I had to stop often. My back and legs hurt. In fact, when I only had one tenth of a mile to the shelter, I had to take a break. I averaged only about a mile an hour for the day, which is slow, even for me.

At first, it was ridge walking to Moose Mountain North peak. While walking the ups and downs between the two mountains, I heard a noise to my left. I looked, and tromping through a bog was, appropriately enough, a moose. It stopped and looked at me. I froze, hoping it would ignore me. I was more excited than scared, but I knew they can be dangerous. It stared for a while, then tromped off through the water and muck. I thought that that’s pretty cool, seeing a moose on Moose Mountain.

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620407,"I’ve made the difficult decision to get off the trail. Actually, it wasn’t that difficult of a decision. I am exhausted physically and, perhaps more importantly, mentally. 


I reached the point where I decided that I’d had enough. I told myself that I didn’t have to be out there if it was making me miserable. I didn’t wake up in the morning looking forward to a day of walking. I didn’t dread it, but it’s not what I really wanted to do. 


I apologize to everyone who has followed this journal and was counting on me to finish. I appreciate your support and am sorry for disappointing you. Buzz, Michael,  and Mike, thank you so much for your encouragement. A special thanks to Kathi from New Hampshire for your positive words. I’m sorry I won’t make it to the Whites, but there are many other hikers out there you can help. 


As for me, I’m heading down to Georgia to get my truck and camper out of storage. Then I’ll drive to the Midwest to visit family and friends. After that, I plan on taking my “home” to the western parts of the country, where I’ll enjoy a different part of the US. I’ll probably stick to day hiking for now, returning to my comfortable camper to eat good food and sleep in a real bed. I have other adventures planned, but nothing near as difficult and time-consuming as long-distance hiking. If interested, you can follow me at the Adventures of Vagabond Jack on Facebook.


I do not regret my decision, although I may in the future. I’ve given it my best, and, at least for now, it’s time to say goodbye to the Appalachian Trail. It’s possible I’ll return in the future to try to finish the final section, but I’m not planning on that. For now, it’s on to new adventures. 



Thanks again for reading and for your support.
Happy Trails!","

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654841,"I’m back on the trail, hoping to finish what I began in 2018. However, my goal is to walk north from Hanover, NH until I either can’t go on or until I reach Katahdin. Either way, I’ll be happy. 


After a long train ride from Kansas City, I made it to Rutland, VT, where I caught a shuttle to Hanover. After eating lunch, I headed out about noon. By the way, the trail goes through Hanover. I only walked about 2 miles, stopping at Velvet Rocks shelter for the night. A few southbounders (SOBO) stopped there also. It was good to talk with them. They walked into town for beers, arriving back long after I was asleep. 


I plan on going extremely slowly at first. I’m not in a rush, and I’m sure not in hiking shape. It’s going to be rough going. And the infamous White Mountains are ahead. 


I’ll post in this journal along the way, but probably not as diligently and faithfully as I did in the past. I have a feeling I’ll be too tired and sore.


A shout-out to my friend, Nicolle, who’s been putting up with me through the pandemic. She’s supported and encouraged me to get back out here.","Hanover, New Hampshire

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654848,"I headed out about 8:00, not knowing how far I’d make it. It was fairly easy walking for the AT, but I was feeling it. I went about 7 miles, then stopped to tent by Mink Brook, a beautiful area by a slow-moving stream. A while later, a couple showed up who also tented at the site. It was good having others around.


The water situation is not so good. It’s been dry here, and a lot of sources are non-existent. That means having to carry more water then I usually do. At 2 pounds a liter, it adds up. It’s also been somewhat hot and muggy. Even the youngsters feel it.","Velvet Rocks shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654849,"The first task of the day was climbing Moose Mountain South. It was not easy for my out-of-shape body. I kept trudging along, taking many breaks, and finally made it. A saddle connects the south peak to Moose Mountain North, and a shelter is between the peaks. The shelter has a brand new privy, one of the best I’ve seen in the trail.
I headed to the north peak, then a long descent to Goose Pond Road, where a couple provided trail magic. I had a sandwich and guzzled a bunch of water. I really appreciate trail angels and try to never take it for granted. 


Goose Pond Road has a special meaning to me, since that’s where I ended my 2018 hike. It felt good to walk across it and step back on the trail. The climb after that did not feel so good, though. 


It was over a 1000-foot climb in about a mile and a half. Forget about switchbacks up here, though. Parts were extremely steep. I must have taken 20 breaks on the way. But I finally made it. 


I then descended to Trapper John shelter for the night. I was glad I had enough water with me to get through the night, since the nearby source was almost completely dried up. Several hikers, NOBOs and SOBOs stayed there, but most tented. I stayed in the shelter as did one other guy.","Mink Brook

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654851,"Yesterday I made a reservation to stay at an inn in Lyme. I know, I’ve barely started back on the trail, but a shower and bed sound good. Also, I can pick up a few food items at the store next door. So I’m taking a nero (near zero miles).


It’s a great place to stay, especially with hiker rates. After checking in, they asked if I needed laundry done. I wasn’t expecting that. They did my laundry while I showered and relaxed. Excellent!


A bar/restaurant is downstairs, where I’m sipping on an IPA while writing this.


It’s supposed to thunderstorm tomorrow. If it looks bad in the morning, I may stay another night. I’ll walk in the rain, but I don’t want to climb Smarts Mountain while dodging lightening bolts. The rain will be good, though, to help replenish the water sources. I plan on hiking unless the weather is foreboding.","Trapper John Shelter

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655180,"I went to breakfast yesterday with full intentions of heading out. My pack was ready, and I was going to brave the rain. However, a SOBO hiker I met convinced me to sit it out. I’m glad I did, since it rained most of the day. Hikers were jumping off the trail looking for a dry place to spend the night. 


Today I got started around 8:00, and it was uphill almost all day. The climb up to Smarts Mountain was brutal. Even the youngsters commented on it. The last mile was extremely steep, and I had to go up many stone steps. It probably took me a half hour to go the last .3 mile. But I finally made it. 


At the top of Smarts is an old fire tower and an old cabin that was used by the fire warden. The cabin is a legitimate AT shelter, so I slept in there. It has four walks, a door, and screened windows. An actual building! 


A few others slept there also, and several people tented in the area. At least one guy slept inside the fire tower observation deck. Not me, though. I’m not crazy able heights. 


I climbed part way up the tower, where I had a 360 degree view of the mountains around me. Beautiful. I also made a phone call from up there. I felt like Mr. Douglas on “Green Acres.”","Lyme

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655183,"Today was my highest mileage day so far on this leg of my journey. I got a fairly early start and headed down the steep north side of Smarts. At the bottom I faced three miles of uphill to the summit of Mt. Cube. Before reaching the top are quartzite ledges, which involved traversing large flat tilted rocks. The heat, humidity, and climbing the rocks really took it out of me. 


At the top, I called a hostel that could pick me up at the bottom, some three miles away. They wanted me there by 6:00 so I hustled down, having to negotiate the steep, rocky trail. I made it just before 6:00, but I was spent. 


It was a long drive to the hostel, which is a climbers hostel instead of a hiker’s place. I took a shower while they did my laundry, then collapsed on my bunk. The people who work there were rather loud, celebrating a birthday. They partied until 11:00, so it cut into my sleep. In all fairness, they told me that it was not quiet hours until that time.","Smarts Mountain

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655339,"After catching a ride to the trailhead, I went up Mt. Mist, which was nothing compared to Smarts and Cube. It was then an easy walk down to Route 25C. 


My body needed a day off after the ten-mile day in the heat and before attempting Mt. Moosilauke, probably the most difficult climb I would face since Georgia. So when I came to the highway, I walked quarter mile to a hostel. However, I planned on getting a ride to N Woodstock to stay at a new hostel: the Old Colony Ski Club. I had to wait about three hours, but finally got a shuttle.The ski club is possibly my favorite hostel on the entire trail. Relaxing, clean, and located near a market, laundromat, and brewery/restaurant. Also, Jen, who runs the place is an excellent hostess.
After I showered, I ate dinner at the brewery, then returned to the club. Several ski club members were there, as well as other hikers. Jen made a fire, someone played a guitar, and I enjoyed relaxing there. I went to bed early and slept well, since I was worn out.","Route 25A

Vagabond Jack ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655342,"While talking to SOBO hikers at the Ski Club, and realizing I was not physically ready to take on the Whites, I made the decision to flip up to Maine and walk south. The first 50 miles of the 100 Mile Wilderness is much less difficult than the Whites. I should hopefully get my trail legs before hitting the difficult areas in southern Maine and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. 


So I took several bus rides and a couple of shuttles to go to Millinocket, Maine. Tomorrow I’ll begin walking south through the 100 Mile Wilderness. I won’t climb Katahdin, since I’m not physically ready to, and I was unable to get the authorization to do so. All permits were already taken. 


I’ll carry five days of food, and the hostel in Millinocket will drop off food at about the 50-mile marker. I’m sure it will take me at least ten days to reach civilization, and cell signal will be spotty at best. So I probably won’t be posting for a few days.","
