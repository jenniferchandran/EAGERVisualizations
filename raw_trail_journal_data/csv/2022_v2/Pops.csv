Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/641974,"I am starting my NOBO hike of the Appalachian Trail on Feb 12, 2022, my 69th birthday.  I spent many years of my life scuba diving much of the tropical waters of S Florida and the Caribbean.  My diving experience has made me very relaxed in just about any ocean situation I have encountered.  I look forward to becoming just as ""woods"" savy during my hike as I am in the ocean.",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Sat",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642610,"I am 6 months out from the start of my Appalachian Trail Hike. I have been prepping for almost 10 months. Last Oct I weighed 245 and wanted to do something to help lose weight. I set a goal to walk 500,000 steps in Oct 2020. I hit my goal and actually did 564500 steps. I started thinking about my longtime dream of walking the Appalachian Trail during some of my early morning walks before breakfast and work. I decided that I would continue upping my daily distance and see how my ankles would react. I have severe bone damage in my ankles and both ankles now have to be immobilized with braces so that I can walk any distance at all. So far my ankles have responded well to the added walking and my Orthopaedic has given his ok (reluctant but at least he didn’t say no) for me to walk the AT. part of my preparation has me walking Mt Vilano several times a week. It isn’t much of a hill but it is all we have in Coastal Florida.",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Wed",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643025,"I think that preparation is the key that will get me through an Appalachian Trail adventure. As I read books and journals of past through hikers many say that you cannot train for an AT through hike. I believe them. While you might not be able to train, you can prepare. My preparation includes walking 4 to 5 miles every morning before work. 8 to 10 miles with weighted pack over Mt Vilano on Sundays and Mondays. (My weekend). And 2 or three miles in the evening after work 2 or 3 days a week. I am dehydrating food to see what menus work best. So far my sausage gravy and biscuits taste great rehydrated even though it has the texture and consistency of oatmeal. i have several camping trips planned for between now and when I start the trail on Feb 12, 2022. I picked the 12th because it is my 69th birthday and allows me 35 weeks to reach Mt Katahdin in Maine if my ankles restrict my pace.   I will use the camping trips to become adept at setting and taking down my gear.",,View Entry,"Aug 24, Tue",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643663,"My friends and acquaintances have asked, Why at your age and physical limitations are you going to walk the Appalachian Trail?I find myself at at a awkward time of life. Every day now brings new challenges. Either it is technology or social media or just the tedium of doing the same job that makes it harder to stay on top of things. I don’t know if I have “lost a step” or if after over 50 years of paying SS taxes I just want to move on to other things that I want to do.   I want to chase new sights, sounds, friends and adventures.  I’m not ready to watch life’s river flow by. I want to hop in my canoe and paddle like hell against the current. I prefer to fill my remaining time with life instead of sitting in a recliner waiting on my turn in the obituaries. I have led a rich and full life. My time has been filled with chasing the next good time and seeking people that shared that thirst. I have been blessed with beautiful and supportive children, great friends, and fabulous wives. Living a gadabouts life is not free. There is a price to be paid and sooner or later the cashier shows up to collect for having a life centered on my fun and pleasure. Now at 68 I am single, my children are grown and doing well and I’m tired of working. Now is the perfect time to work on the bucket list items that I’ve wanted to do for so long. I want to be physically and mentally challenged. I want to go back to school to study and identify plants, birds, stars, and wildlife. I want to be as comfortable in the woods as I am in the ocean after thousands of scuba and free dives and days on boats. I want to LIVE winter, spring, summer and fall. Not just look at pictures or visit for a day or two on a tour but LIVE it. All of the above and much more than I have the ability to translate into words on paper is why I’m going to hike the Appalachian Trail in 2022.",,View Entry,"Sep 06, Mon",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643899,"I have always felt that I could plan and practice my way to do anything I wanted to achieve. I have approached my AT hike that way. I am reading about past hikers successes and setbacks, walking 10 miles a day with a weighted pack, dehydrating food  and testing my equipment on camping trips. this weekend was another test of my plans and equipment. I made reservations 9 months ago at Florida’s Blue Springs State Park Campground. I had camped there years ago when my daughter Alyssa was young. I remember being fascinated at the spring head by the current and velocity of the water exiting the spring. Alyssa and her friends snorkeled the spring, saw fish in the water for the first time and even got to see manatees up close. We had a great camping trip. I wanted to show my grand children the same things that Alyssa saw years ago. The first hitch in the giddy-up was the state emailing me that the springs were closed to swimmers for the next several weeks while the state upgraded the area for both the manatees and the human population. we decided to press on with the trip even if there was no swimming. We could add bicycling and teaching the kids (and Pops) the PCT method of food bag hanging. On Friday we set camp, smoked a turkey, and had a wonderful dinner. After dinner we settled down for s’mores around the campfire. We had a production line executing s’more production at its finest. Benji, Lena and Cora toasted marshmallows, Carolyn set up the graham crackers, peanut butter, and chocolate. I know that peanut butter is not a traditional s’more but don’t knock it until you try it. Mike facilitated the transfer of marshmallows from the kids to Carolyn and I sat fireside consuming excess production. And just like that our weekend plans changed  Mike backed into the hot smoker during a marshmallow exchange.  As he pirouetted away from me the hot smoker something gave way in his knee and he was on the ground in agony  On Saturday Mike could not walk on the sore leg. We packed them up after breakfast and sent them back to Miami for a MRI  I packed up and headed back to St Augustine  On the drive back home I thought about all the things not in my control that can, just like that, end my Appalachian Trail hike  I will be fortunate and blessed if I have a successful AT hike. I also thought about how 20 years ago today all of our lives were changed, just like that.  The United States of America is a wonderful place to raise children and grandchildren. I hope that our elected politicians can get their act together and do what is best for the country, not what is best for their political action committee.",,View Entry,"Sep 11, Sat",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646745,"Sometimes plans just don't work out.  Last year I made plans to start an Appalachian Trail thru hike this February.  Part of my pre-hike preparation included a medical check up in October.  One of the test came back out of the normal range and other test were ordered.  During a long process of test it was determined that I had developed cancer and would require surgery.  So instead of starting my thru hike on February 12 I will be entering the hospital on February 9 for surgery to remove the cancer.  
I have wanted to do the Appalachian Trail thru hike since college but there always seemed to be a reason not to go.  School, marriage, family and work always got in the way.  Now it is a medical set back that is delaying my hike.  My plans now are to do a section hike later this summer.  
I hope to see you on the trail later this year.
