Christian,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647021,"Hello Everyone,I will be starting my Journey on the trail early next week. I have been busy getting all my gear together and preparing as best as I can. I'm sure there is still something I don't have, or am unaware of, but making mistakes is part of the journey. For the time being, I am doing my best to just enjoy the comforts that I will be missing on the trail; eating lots of food, watching Netflix and laying in bed. I have been doing some smaller hikes with my pack to get used to the weight, but nothing will truly prepare me for actually being out there. I have been wanting to do the AT since my college days when me and a couple of buddies would do some 2-3 day section hikes from time to time. I loved being out in nature, and the idea of doing the whole thing intrigued me. I wasn't sure if I would ever get around to trying to do the whole thing, because it is difficult to find enough free time to do this. Thanks to me just quitting my job and moving back to the US from Austria, I now conveniently have time to make the trek. I'm very excited to get out there. There will be highs and lows, and I have no idea how things will end up. All I know is that I will be happy that I gave it a shot.I'm not sure yet how often I will update this. Maybe once a week or every second week. Either way, I hope you enjoy reading about my journey.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Tue",0
Christian,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647230,"Hello Everyone,I just spent an hour typing up a post on my phone, but when I hit submit, it sent me back to the login screen and everything I wrote was lost. I don't have the patience to write it all again tonight, but I promise I will start uploading stuff soon. I'll do little bits to try and get myself caught up to where I was. Overall I am doing good though. I made it to Helen, which is my second Resuply and 52 miles into the trail. I still have a ways to go, but I feel myself getting stronger and more confident. I'm really glad I'm out here, but that might change soon as the forecast is showing a lot of rain. Sorry that I don't have more, but I promise to start doing some updates in the next couple days.Peace and Love,Christian","

Christian,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647363,"Hello Everyone,
Sorry for the delay on doing an update on here. I finally have some time to sit down and write. As I am new to this, I am not really sure the best way to format this, or what will be the most interesting for people to read. I imagine some of you that I sent this link to don't know much about the trail, so I will do a quick description of it and then I will type up my Journal entries that I have been writing down every night. Since I am catching up from the beginning of the Hike, this may be a long one.
The Appalachian Trail (AT):
The AT is a 2,190 mile (3,525 km) trail that goes from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, running through 14 States. It is not the longest trail in the United States, but it is considered by many to be the most challenging because of its steepness and elevation change. It has 464,464 ft of elevation change, which is enough to summit Mt. Everest 16 times. In comparison, the Pacific Crest Trail hast 5% more elevation change, but is 21% longer. The AT has A LOT of up and downs. The AT is also known as the Green Tunnel because almost all of it is going through forests, so there are trees everywhere. It mostly goes through National and State Parks and there are shelters (consisting of a wood floor, roof and 3 walls) about every 10 miles. You can generally get by staying in a shelter every night if you want to, but people carry some sort of shelter with them. I am personally using a hammock with a tarp that I hang over it to protect against the rain and the wind. You can usually find water every couple of miles from some sort of stream or creek, which should be filtered before drinking. Generally you will make it to a town every 3-5 days where you will be able to resupply, or stay in a hotel and shower. The longest stretch between towns is the 100 Mile Wilderness in Main.
The AT has about 3 million visitors a year, with around 3 thousand of them being Thru-Hikers. Only about 15% of Thru-Hikers finish their journey, and most of them bail out in the first 200 miles. While out on the trail, hikers will get Trail Names that they go by (I am still waiting on mine). For instance, Tunes carries a guitar and was playing music every night, 5-0 wears a Hawaiian shirt and Red Baron won't stop talking about frozen pizza. Most of the people out here are attempting it by themselves and because of that, everyone is very open to meeting new people and making friends.  I have met people in there early 20s all the way to there 70s. They come from all over and have a diverse range of backgrounds. In my experience about 80% have been men. 

2-28
First day on the Trail. Molly and Zoey drove me from NC the Springer Mountain, dropping me off at the Forest Service Road around 1. I only had a mile hike up to the top of Springer, which had a beautiful outlook, and is the official starting point of the trail. Up there, I chatted with a couple of ladies from Ecuador, who gave me my first trail magic, homemade cookies with peanut butter and M&Ms. I left an entry at the journal at the top saying ""Christian is 1 mile in and feeling goo. EZ Trail."" On the way down I immediately rolled my ankle, which I took as the AT reminding me this was going to be a difficult journey. The ankle is feeling okay now, but I need to be more careful. I met Colton and Eevee from Iowa and hiked with them to Stove Creek Shelter. I only did about 4 miles today, but it was a good little warm up to get started. My favorite part was hiking through the rhododendron. At the shelter, we all sat around the campfire and people were taking turns playing songs on the guitar that Colton had brought. Colton was really talented, and did a wonderful cover of Bob Dylan's Don't Think Twice, It's Alright. A guy with the trail name Green and Blue played a song he had written for a little girl with cancer, who he recently learned had passed away. The girl had heterochromia, with one green and one blue eye. The song was beautiful and I wish I remembered more of it, but the chorus goes like this:
""It was Green and Blue 
and all I could think about was you
So Brooke take a look around
Its Love""
I hope I sleep will tonight. Overall I'm feeling good and happy I'm out here.

3-1 (incorrectly labeled as 2-29 in my Journal)
Today I pushed myself too hard. It started off amazing. It was soo cool waking up in the woods, packing up and immediately being a trail to hike. I linked up with a Canadian dude named Levi. He has been backpacking in New Mexico and it was more experienced then me. He brought a nice vibe to the hike and because of that I wanted to stick with him all the way up to Justus Creek. I was wanted to stop at Hawk originally, but I was feeling good So I went for it. Sassafras Mountain was a very tough climb, but not quite as bad as I thought it would be. By the end of the day, I was exhausted though. Made it to camp just as it was getting dark, which is a bit too late. Then I didn't boil enough water for the instant mashed potatoes I made for dinner, so I had to add more cold water, which led to room temperature mashed potatoes for dinner after a tough day. Tomorrow I need to take it easy. I feel like there was more I wanted to write, but I am too tired to think.

3-2
Feeling much better today. I walked from Justus Creek to Lance Creek, which was just under 10 miles. Yesterday I thought there was no way I would make it that far. Turns out I just needed a little bit of rest. I woke up in the middle of the night in Justus to water some plants and the stars were amazing. It was the most beautiful night sky I had ever seen. I hiked with Levi again today which was cool. Preaching Rock was the most beautiful view of the trail thus far. As I got to Wood Gap, I was greeted by a Trail Angel named Robert aka Max Forester. He hooked me up with an Air Head. The true MVP of Wood Gap was the trash can! It was the first one I had encountered on the trail, which finally allowed me to throw away all the trash I had been carrying with me the past couple of days. Derrick decided to quit at Wood Gap. He is the first person I knew that quit. Sad to see him go. Tomorrow I only have 7 miles to Neel Gap, which is my first resupply, but in those 7 Miles is Blood Mountain, which is supposed to be brutal. If I managed to do 11 miles including Sassafras, then I should be able to make it okay. I'm still sore but I am feeling good. I got into camp earlier today and had a big dinner, with two packs for Ramen and a big tin of mustard and dill sardines. 

3-3
Made it to Neels Gap! I woke up early and started pushing the 7 miles from Lance Creek. I was determined to be one of the first ones there. It was a great day of hiking, with a lot of beautiful scenery. Climbing up Blood Mountain was my favorite part of the trail so far. Everyone said that Blood Mountain was tough, but I enjoyed the way up, as it was still early in the day and I had just hit my groove. There was this cool rock at the top where you could climb up and get a beautiful view. Ran into Smokey, who I thought would be way further ahead. He hurt his knee and got a ride at Wood Gap and was slack packing for the day. Then on the way down, I learned why everyone said Blood was so tough. It was a long technical path down that left me hurting by the time I got down to the bottom. From there the rest of the way was pretty easy to Neels Gap, which I reached around 1. I was so tired I went straight to the cabins and booked a room. I took a shower, which felt heavenly. Took my clothes down to the laundry and then ate a big pizza for lunch, and I have another one lined up for dinner. Drinking a soda kind of shocked me at first. The sweetness was overwhelming at first, which was weird, because I had only been in the woods a couple of days. Spent some time by the store using WIFI to chat with some people, which was my first contact with the world outside. It should take me 3 days to get to Helen where I will take my first 0. I'll hit the outfitter in the morning to get a few things and then head out. I met a dude named 53, because his pack was 53 pounds when he started. My pack is around 30 pounds and is on the heavier side of most people I have met.

3-4
It was awesome waking up in a bed today. Really had to convince myself that I should hike instead of taking a 0, but I managed to pack up and get going. I went to Mountain Crossings, which is the outfitter there and the only building that the trail actually goes through. There is a tree there with a bunch of boots and shoes retired from through hikers hanging from its branches. I picked up an ankle brace for my left ankle, a set of rain pants and a sheet of Tyvek to lay my pack on when it is raining. Most importantly I have been loading up on that sweet sweet food. I saw Smokey at Mountain Crossings, but other than that I didn't see anyone I knew. I didn't start hiking until about 11, so it wasn't the longest day of hiking. My original plan was to camp at Hogpen Gap, but I met a dude named Joey who was going a bit further, so I decided to join him for another 2 miles to make tomorrow a bit easier. The plan is to get to Blue Mountain Shelter to set me up with a nice easy day into Unicoi Gap, where I will be able to get a ride into Helen.

3-5
Apparently I forgot to journal this day. I don't remember much about the hike, but I remember having a nice time at the Blue Mountain Shelter. Ran into Green and Blue again, which was a nice surprise because I figured he would be long gone, but he had gotten sick and had to take some time off. I was hanging out with him, who works on TV sets in LA, Mau, who Drives forklifts in Chicago, Joey, a barber from Jacksonville NC, and Couscous a dude who was retired at 26. It was an interesting mix of people. 

3-6
Got up and had an easy little hike down into Unicoi Gap where I was once greeted by a Trail Angel named Bouncer and his dog Ozzy. He hooked me up with a drink, a honey bun and an orange. I got a ride into Helen and checked into my Hotel around 10:30. I have a few errands I'll need to run, but other than that I am just going to try and take it easy today and tomorrow. After that I will have 2 days to Dick's Creek, where I will do a quick resupply. Then is a 40 Mile hike until we hop off and take a ride to Franklin, where we will take our next 0.

3-8
Today started really nice, I woke up in my hotel in Helen feeling good and glad to be in abed. I was trying to convince myself to stay in town until it stops raining, but that could take a while. If I always stop whenever it rains I will never get anywhere. I had a decent breakfast at the hotel and waited for my ride to arrive. I was on the trail by 9. It wasn't raining when I started, but I knew there was some coming later in the day. A lot of Uphill today! I got treated to some excellent trail magic from the Boots Off Hostile that had set up a grill at a trail crossing and where making burgers. I was enjoying hanging out with 5-0, Josephine, Addy, Red Baron and Isiah. Colton (now known as Tunes) and Eevee even showed up. Cool running into them again. I was really tempted to stay and hang out longer, but I new the rain was coming and I still had a ways to go to get to Addis Gap, so I set out. It started to rain around 2 and I made it to Addis Gap around 4. Some people were already cozy in their tents, while others where still setting theirs up. Some looked like the inside of their tents were already getting very wet while they were getting put up. I set up my big ole tarp which kept the rain off me while I set up. First up, I cooked dinner and ate, while listening to the rain pelt my tarp. Then I set up my hammock and got ready to bed down. I managed to stay dry and settle in. I hope it stays dry while I sleep!

3-9
I did not want to get up today. It had rained through the night. I stayed nice and dry, but my pack and the ground were still soaked and muddy. I struggled to keep stuff off the ground while I packed up. My pack was wet, but the Liner kept everything inside dry. Having the big tarp was very Helpful. Nice to be able to stay dry underneath while I got ready to set out that day. After everything else was packed up, I put on my rain suit, took down the tarp and got going. The wet pack was HEAVY, which made trudging through the rain and the mud even more difficult. There was a lot of climbing from Addis Gap to Dick's Creek. I was originally going to need a ride to Around the Bend Hostile to resupply, but a Trail Angel named Thomas there gave me everything I needed. I hung out there for a little while, to wait on Joey and the rain finally stopped. My clothes were still wet, but I think it was mostly sweat. Either way I was cold. Bouncer happened to show back up and let me sit in his car with the heater running while I waited, which felt amazing! Joey made it and together we hiked up to Plum Orchard Shelter. There were a lot of tough climbs, but my knee started killing me on the last mile or so during the downhills. I really hope that doesn't keep up.

3-10
Made it to NC Today!! I was happy to make it back to my home state and proud to have made it through the first state of the Trail. NC however, greeted me with a kick in the teeth and a looooong climb out of Bly Gap. It might have been the toughest climb of the trail so far. After that it was a great day of hiking with the elevation change not being too bad. The knee is still bothering me, but it isn't too bad. It hurts on the declines, so I try to be as easy as possible on it, but the up hills and flats are fine. With a 12 mile day, it was the longest so far. Tomorrow we have 16 miles planned though.... maybe. The elevation looks okay, but I will need an early start to make it. My pack felt a ton lighter today with it being dry. It was very chilly this morning, but the sun came out in afternoon and had a real nice lunch break. Rolled into Standing Indian Shelter around 3. I hope I am ready for Tomorrow. After that, we should be able to get into Franklin around noon, just before the winter storm comes in.

3-11
Woke up today and looked at the weather forecast with Joey and Pilgram and we saw that the winter storm was coming tonight with freezing rain, starting around 5, strong winds and it getting down to 9 F (-13 C). We decided that there is no need to try and survive that so we turned around and headed to Deep Gap to try and get a ride to town. About 5 steps into the hike my knee started killing me. The pain was way worse than the past two days and was hurting regardless of if it was up hill down hill or flat. I was glad that we only had a mile to hike back to Deep Gap. After getting there, we learned that the road was closed until March 15th, so we had to hike another 6 miles down the road to the gate, where we could get picked up. Everyone decided to get a hotel and wait a couple of days for the storm to pass. I have a feeling that I need more than just two days off with the shape my knee is in. I called home and I am getting picked up and brought back home to give myself some time to recover. I hope to be back out there on the 15th, but I am just going to have to see how my knee does over the coming days. I am very disappointed that I am having to take time off, because I have really been enjoying the experience, but I know that continuing to push is only going to lead to my knee getting worse. The good thing is that my sisters are at home for the time to celebrate my dad's birthday. So, at least I won't be missing that and I get to see everyone.

So, that is the end of this post. I hope you all enjoyed it. I will keep you all posted about when I head back out. I'll get around to uploading some pictures and doing a write up of all my gear in the next couple of days. Take care of yourselves!","

Christian,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648471,"Hello Everyone,I am heading back to the trail today! My knee seems to be doing better, so I am going to give it another shot. Hopefully it holds up better this time around. I'm getting dropped off at Deep Gap North Carolina, where I will slowly make my way to Franklin over the next couple of days. I'm am gonna limit the miles these first days to hopefully prevent my knee from acting up again. I'll make my next update when I get to Franklin. Until next time!Christian","

Christian,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649191,"Hello everyone, sorry that I have been slow on Updating these. I had plenty of time in Franklin but I was just too lazy. I'm doing good for the time being. My left knee, which took me off the trail before is doing fine, but now my right knee has been bothering me, but it is still manageable. Currently up to 136 miles on the trail. Still a long way to go but I have enjoyed my journey so far.

First day back on the trail after taking some time off to let my knee recover. Mom drove me up to Deep Gap and walked the first little part with me. Just did 1.5 miles to get back to standing Indian Shelter, which is where I stopped last time. It started snowing on the hike up and really picked up as I was setting up camp. When I packed up last time, I just threw all my stakes and lines in the bag without nearly wrapping them up, so o had to untangle then all in the snow. Got everything together though. saw my mom snuck an Easter egg with some chocolate into my bag, which was a really nice surprise. Everything was so beautiful in the snow. Got really cold that night though. Even though my underquilt is rated to 20 degrees, my back was getting cold as it dropped down to 25 on the night. Heck of a way to start up the trail again.
4-9
Was hoping to just do about 5 miles to a campsite to take things easy on my knees, but everyone I ran into said they were going to Carter Gap Shelter. Since it was going to be another below 30 night, I didn't want to be the only one at my camp, so I pushed the 7 miles to the Shelter. Not a crazy distance, but when it's cold and snowing, it just saps the energy out of you. My knees were killing me by the end of the day. The hike was absolutely beautiful though. With all the snow covered trees it felt like a fairy tale. With the snow continuously falling, there was no good place for me to stop for lunch. There were a lot of people at the shelter, and thankfully there was a fire waiting for me. I warmed up and dried my stuff out. I unfortunately placed my ankle brace too close to the fire and melted it, which earned me my trail name ""Graceful Brace"".
4-10
Doing much better today. Just had a little 3 mile Nero to Betty Creek campsite. I felt my knees some, but it wasn't too bad. Either way, I am glad to keep the day short. Got to the camp around 1 and have just been chilling. Made some good food, set up and made sure the rest of the afternoon was spent recovering. Tomorrow I have 5 miles to Long Branch shelter, then I am going 3 miles to Rock Gap, where I'll grab a ride to Franklin for a Resupply and a 0. With the shape my knee is in, I am doubtful I will make the whole trail, so I am just going to take it easy and enjoy it while I can.
4-11
Made it further than I was expecting today. It was only noon by the time I made it to Long Branch shelter and my knees were still feeling okay, so I decided to go to Rock Gap Shelter. Just went slow and took frequent brakes. I was pretty tired by the time I got here, but it was only around 2:30, so i still have plenty of time to recover. Talked to Boston Bill a lot today, he was cracking me up and was very encouraging. Climbing Mt Albert was cool, a lot of rock scrambling, but it wasn't too long of a climb. The view up top was incredible, especially from the top of the fire tower. Also, it was the 100 mile mark! Very proud to make it this far. We got 30 seconds of hail while we were up there. The sun was still shining and the weather was nice, so no idea where that came from. Going to Franklin tomorrow for 2 0s, to let my knees heal up before I get going again.
4-12 
Hiked to Winding Staircase with Mountain Goat and his dog Frankie, where we looked to hitch a ride into Franklin. No one was stopping so we started getting creative with how we held our thumbs out. Started him standing right behind me and us both holding our arms straight out with the thumbs up, then we would alternate squating
4-15
Took forever to get a ride out of Franklin, but eventually Bobby the Greek hooked me up. Since it was a late start I just did 4 miles to Siler Bald Shelter. There was a little offshoot from the main trail to go up to Siler Bald, which had an unbelievable 360 degree view. Headed down to the shelter where I met Cole and his adorable Australian Shepher, Chester.
4-16
Walked 7 miles to Wayah Shelter. Met a group of people up on Wayah Bald stopping for lunch. The view was amazing from there and luckily only had about a mile down to the shelter. Really enjoyed the company of everyone at the shelter.
4-17
Everyone I was hanging out with the night before was heading to Wesser, but I didn't think going 11 miles ony knees, so I originally planned to just go five miles, but I was moving pretty good and my knees felt good, so I ended up making it all the way to Wesser. It was nice to be with the same group of people for a couple of days. Being slower had meant that for the most part I would meet people and then the next day they would be gone. I was doing Monty Python impersonations with some people and someone started calling me Monty. Everyone decided that Graceful Brace was too hard to remember so my trail name got shifted to Monty. At some point 4 of us realized that we had all wrestled in the Carolinas, so we started doing our southern coach yelling at his wrestler impressions. Everyone else was very confused as to what was happening, but the 4 of us had a great time. Started to rain around 5, and i was once again glad to have my big tarp over my hammock to keep me dry.
4-18
It rained through the night. I was so slow getting up, hoping the rain would stop, but it didn't look like it would get better. Only had about 5 miles to get to NOC, for the next Resuply, but it was all downhill. It was some technical climbing, which was not made easier with the slick rocks and mud, but we got down just fine. The rain stopped about an hour in, and we just got some occasional drizzling, but we were in the fog the whole descent, which made for a cool atmosphere. Got a cabin with 8 others, where I will stay until we head out for Fontana Damn, the last stop before the Great Smokey Mountains. For now I will enjoy the unbelievable luxury of having a shower and a toilet","

Christian,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650340,"Hello everyone,
It feels like it has been months since I updated this blog, but it has only been 2 weeks. Time feels like it moves differently on the trail. If you don't see someone for 2 days, it feels like it's been ages since you have seen them. A lot has happened since I wrote last and I feel like I am really starting to hit my stride, but I have yet to hit peak hiker form. I am getting to know everyone in the bubble and having a good time hanging out. Currently very happy.
4-20
I hiked 11 miles out of NOC with Hall, Spice Girl and Rocky. It was soooo much uphill. It was tough but not quite as hard as i was expecting. The view from Chris Bald was gorgeous. We are camped at Lotus Cove campsite and there is an entire tent city. There are so many right next to each other. Unfortunately Pablo Escargot, Ducky, Gamgee, Alex and Papa John went on to the next campsite, so i hope i run into them later.
4-21
Today likely ends my stay with the Fellowship of the Nomadic Mountain Hippies. Misplaced a few things this morning, so i had a very slow start. I caught up to the girls around 11:30 at a gap, where they were gonna slack pack 15 miles to Fontana Damn. I just didn't trust my knees to take me that far even with a light pack. Unless they really slow down, i likely won't catch them. It was fun while it lasted. My body was still aching and i only made it to Cody Gap, so it was only 8 miles instead of the planned 12. I am worried about getting through the 70 mile stretch of the smokies in 7 days. Today i have a nice little campsite right next to a stream. The hills are green with patches of white flowers, giving contrast to the tall still leafless trees. One tree has fallen on the hill with massive roots lifted out of the ground, creating a 12 foot wall of dirt and roots. Sprouting out of the wall are several small green plants.
4-22
It was hot as shit today. I was slow getting up and regretted it. The sun was so bright, would have been nice to do more hiking in the morning. It was a lot of tough hiking. Jacob's ladder kicked my ass. The final 3 mile downhill stretch killed my knees as well. Got to the Marina and resupplied a bit. Got a free freeze pop and bought a vanilla coke, which gave me a huge sugar rush. Hung out with Taco, lady Bird, Honey, Custom and Ulasine. Walked the rest of the way to the Fontana Shelter, which is know as the Fontana Hilton, because it is the nicest shelter on the trail. It has bathrooms with running water and amazingly showers! There were tons of camping spots and a really big crowd. Taking a shower felt so amazing. 3 guys showed up and started grilling kebabs and had all sorts of sides. Best trail magic yet
4-23
Took a zero in Fontana. I was hesitant at first because i Just took one in Franklin, but the Smokies are intimidating. Spent a lot of time at the lodge doing laundry, resupplying and charging my things. Went back to the Hilton and hung out with Cody custom and Ulasine for a while. There was more trail magic from the same group. Grilled chicken this time! Had a long conversation with Ulasine about life and what we value.
4-24
Into the smokies! My pack felt so heavy today with a fresh resupply and 2 liters of water. There isn't much water available so i gotta carry more unfortunately. The walk across the dam was beautiful and nice and flat. The initial climb to the fire tower was brutal, but the view was breath taking. There were some other climbs, but  nothing as bad. Surprisingly also a lot of flat parts. The sun was so brutally hot. I got some sun burn, but mine isn't the worst i have seen. Was originally just planning to do 6 miles to birch spring gap, but I ended up doing 11 to Mollies Ridge Shelter. The shelter is pretty nice, but I am so damn tired
4-25
Did 12 miles to Derricks Knob Shelter. The first 9 we're super easy. A lot of flat parts and the steeper inclines weren't too long. Rocky Knob had a beautiful view. Was hanging out there with Little Peak. Stopped for lunch about 9 miles in and thought I may end up doing 17 miles, but I was so very wrong. The next 3 miles kicked my ass, so i was happy to call it a day. It's gonna rain tonight, so tomorrow might be tough.
4-26
Best day on the trail so far. Did about 22 miles and i feel surprisingly good considering it was my 3rs 12 mile day in a row. Up until today i didn't see what all the rage was with the Smokies. It was pretty, but not that different from what I had seen to that point. About 3 miles from Clingmans Dome everything changed. It was like stepping into an entirely different Biome. Fir trees covered in moss. Reminded me a bit of a Forrest in Austria. It was breath taking. I felt like i was walking through a fantasy story. There were some amazing views  down to the valley and across the other mountains, With some clouds hanging in the valleys. The day started with some rain, but it stopped around noon, when I stopped at a shelter for lunch. The climb up to Clingmans wasn't that hard, and it was incredible beautiful. The view from Clingmans tower was awesome. Climbed to the top, shouted at the top of my lungs and pounded my chest. It was also the 200 mile amrk. I am very proud to have made it this far especially after getting hurt.
4-28
Gatlinburg is a wired little place. Enjoyed my stay non the less. Ate good and enjoyed my shower. Got a shuttle at 11 back up to newfound Gap and walked about 10 miles to Pecks Corner Shelters. It was very beautiful. There was a lot of ridge walking. The ups and downs were all very gradual, so it was relatively easy going. The view from Charlie's Bunion was insane. Got a lot of food so i have a heavy pack, but I am feeling good to finish out the Smokies in the next couple days.
4-29
I only hiked about 5 miles today. I slept terribly the last 3 nights, so i was just too tired. Physically i am fine. The hike itself was pretty though. Got to Trim Corner Shelter right around noon. Made a big lunch, set up mu hammock and read the entire afternoon. Surprised to see some familiar faces like Kat, Little Moon, Side Quest and guardian.

Longest day on the trail today! Was planning to just do 15 miles to Davenport shelter, but it was such a dump. There was a chain link fence locking it in, to keep out bears. No good spots to hammock, so I hiked 2 more miles out of the Smokies to a stealth site. Met sailor there and had a chill evening. Leaves only a 1.5 mile walk to standing Bear Hostel for a Nero. I am very proud to do so many miles in one day. The Smokies were really beautiful. My favorite part of the trail so far. Ended up taking 6 days to get through, i was originally worried that i couldn't do it in 8.

Got to standing Bear early and have been chilling here all day. A lot of cool people. Little Moon, kat, guardian, side quest, lone wolf, square pie, twigs, fog horn, a-o, wink, RV, little peak, rain man and scooter. Ate a whole supreme pizza by myself for lunch

Hardest day on the trail so far. Went 16 miles from standing Bear Hostel to roaring fork shelter. There were some absolutely brutal climbs and it was soooo damn hot and humid. At one point i was going to stop after just 10 miles. Max Patch was an absolutely beautiful view. I was so tired when I got to camp. Little Peak had set up slack packing for a lot of people but I declined. Would have been nice to have a lighter lack, but I am very proud that I managed to get through the day with a heavy pack

15 mile day to another shelter, setting myself up for a 3 mile walk to Hot Springs, followed by a 0 in town. We have a hot tub booked that i am so excited for. The elevation change wasn't nearly as bad today, but I was still so tired from yesterday that even those smaller hills were killing me. It got up to 86 today and it was super humid. At least there was a lot of downhill. Got to camp early enough and had a chill evening. Ready for some sleep.","

Hot Springs has been my favorite spot to stop so far. The Laughing Heart Hostel is right off the trail as soon as you get into town. It is exactly what you want in a hiker hostel. The staff is friendly, has a nice kitchen, multiple bathrooms, an honor fridge and is only a short walk from everything. It had a really nice atmosphere and there are a lot of good people. Ran into Goldilocks again, who I hadn’t seen since Franklin. The plan was to just do a nero and a zero there so instead of getting a room or a bunk, I hung up my hammock just outside. When I woke up after the second night, I checked the forecast and saw there was a gnarly storm coming with heavy rain, wind and lightning. There was even a chance of tornados and hail, so I quickly decided to take a second zero. Ended up grabbing a private room, which I really enjoyed. Spent a lot of time with Lone Wolf, who I have become very close to.

Couldn’t delay my hike to Erwin any longer. It was still raining, but not nearly as bad as the day before and there were no major storms. It rained all day, but it wasn’t too cold and a nice change of pace from all the hot and humid days. Did about 15 miles and set up camp around 5. Should clear up and be sunny again tomorrow. Haven’t seen most of my friends since I left the hostel. I imagine most of them stopped at the shelter around 11 miles in. I was surprised at how easily I was able to do the 15 miles. Felt like not too big of a deal.  The storm from the day before had knocked down so many trees across the trail. There was one where we had to take our packs off, crawl over them and then have the others pass the packs over.

Forgot to journal this day and I don’t remember a bunch. I remember being very tired. I was planning on doing about 15 miles, but I was so tired that I stopped after 11 miles at Jerry Shelter relatively early. I was glad I did because Lone Wolf caught up and we had a good time hanging out.

5-9

Hiked out with Lone Wolf. We had been promised no more rain, but it had drizzled through the night. My tarp was totally wet again. It was still very cloudy, and I was bummed that it was going to be another wet day. Then I hiked 30 minutes up a hill and hiked right out of the cloud and into the sun. It instantly made me feel amazing. It was beautiful for the rest of the day. Met up with Lone Wolf at a shelter for lunch where we hung out for a long time letting our stuff dry out. We hiked out from there and did a 14 mile day. 

5-10

I forgot to journal this day, and I don’t remember a whole lot. Ended up doing my biggest day at 18 miles. Towards the end of the day, Lone Wolf and I ran into Squid and invited her to join us. 

5-11

Did a 13 mile day to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel in Erwin Tennessee. We are just going to chill for the day and then head to Damascus for Trail Days

Trail Days

Trail Days is a festival in Damascus Virginia that happens every year to celebrate the Appalachian Trail and its Thru Hikers. There are booths with vendors doing give aways, a hiker parade, live music, food trucks and a big field where the hikers stay, known as Tent City. We got there on Thursday and set up in tent city. The city extended past the field and into the woods, where we ended up spending most of our time that day, just partying and having fun. Next day we moved to an AirBnB with Lone Wolf, Free Flow, Deluxe and Squid. It was supposed to rain the entire weekend, but it only rained for about 3 hours the entire time. Ran into a bunch of people I knew, which was awesome getting to catch up with people I hadn’t seen in a long time. Went and sat at a stage where some music was playing. It started raining, which cleared a lot of people out, but Lone Wolf and I just went and danced in the rain. Later when it cleared up more people like Tink joined us. On Friday we went to the hiker parade and had an absolute blast. All the hikers walked through the middle of town, where everyone watching was lined up with hoses and water guns to “wash off the dirty hikers.” At night we went to a massive bonfire, where there was a drum circle going. It started off with a Native American prayer known as the salute to the four winds. We would all face one direction and salute the wind by yelling, hooting and hollering followed by a prayer. Then, we would shift and do it all over again until we had saluted the winds of the north, south, east and west. Then the drums started going and we all moved in a circle around the fire just dancing and having a great time. The rest of the time at trail days was spent walking around, listening to music and hanging out. Got a ride back to Erwin on the 16th to start back up

Finally got back on the trail today. Slept well in a bed at Uncle Johnny’s. Ran to the Post office to send my box off and left around 11. We only did about 11 miles, because everyone was still exhausted from Trail Days. Croba, Lone Wolf and I were very tired and had no energy coming up. We were glad to get to camp early. We ran into Squid at beauty spot, which had a really nice view. We will likely push more miles tomorrow.

5-18

Did about 16 miles today to Clyde Smith Shelter. We were all feeling a bit better today, except for Lone Wolf, who rolled her ankle pretty badly. We made good time and got to camp around 4 and are gonna chill. The rest of the day. I am going to sleep early today.

5-19

Had about a 16 mile hike to Over Mountain Shelter, which is a old red barn, that had been converted into a shelter. You are no longer allowed to camp in it, but you can still tent around it. There is a beautiful view across a valley and some other mountains. We had a lot of climbing, but it wasn’t too bad because the incline was gradual. The views from the balds were beautiful and it was great seeing the mountains we just crossed. We ran into Mulligan again at camp. Forgot my gps tracker at the shelter last night, like an idiot.

5-20

Woke up with a beautiful view. I was a bit slow getting out of camp. Squid and Lone Wolf had left early, but I usually catch up to them, so I wasn’t worried. I ended up having a very rough day though. With there being a lot of downhill into town, my left IT Band that had taken me off the trail earlier started hurting again. So, I ended up walking very slowly. The one really great thing about the day was that the views were beautiful. It was maybe the prettiest day on the trail. There were so many amazing views that left me in absolute awe. By the time I got to the road to Roan, Lone Wolf had already gotten a ride and Squid was waiting on me. I told here about my knee and that I wouldn’t be able to keep going without a break to let my knee recover. We hitched a ride to Roan and met up with Lone Wolf. I Told here that I was going to need a little break and then I would likely take things slow once I did get back on the trail, so I wouldn’t be able to keep up with her. I am going to miss her a lot. The time I spent with her has meant a lot to me. Telling here that I won’t be able to keep up was heart breaking. Lone Wolf and Squid agreed to spend the night in town with me, so we went to the Roan Mountain Bed and Breakfast, which was a lovely place. The next day, we got a ride to the trail head, where I said goodbye to them. I am very sad that I can’t go on with them, but I know that if I keep pushing right now, I could be off the trail for a long time again. So, I am taking a couple days off to recover and I am hoping to be back on the trail soon.","Hot Springs
