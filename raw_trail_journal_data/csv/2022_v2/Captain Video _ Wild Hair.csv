Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626413,"Testing some cold weather gear in an unusually snow free January in Illinois. Since we're starting so early (February 28) we have to be prepared for days in the 40's or 50's and nights in the 20's. It can get pretty chilly since there is no ""lets go inside and warm up"" in backpacking.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Sun",0
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626412,"We have cleared off the spare table in the basement and started to organize the piles of stuff. Yes, you see that correctly. We have made the decision to both carry bear canisters (tall, clear blue container with the black lid). It is a controversial choice because of their weight and bulk, but the ATC is currently recommending them. We chose them for a few reasons....the number of people on the trail, all fighting over the same trees to hang bear bags (especially early on); getting to our camp site in the dark or after a hard day and not wanting to search for a decent tree to hang a bag; keeping out other hungry critters besides bears....like mice, squirrels, chipmunks, skunks!So basically, we're lazy.  :)",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Sat",0

We hiked to the top of Springer in a snow squall and touched the official placque, then hiked back to Stover Creek shelter. Met the Dutch boys, the Aussies, and Cosmo, plus a few others who's names we don't remember. A very cold night...1/2 to 1 inches of snow on our tent in the morning, which we discovered in the middle of the night on a necessary run.","Springer Mountain

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626545,"Got a late start today, wearing almost all of our clothes. Beautiful sunny day with snow on the rhodadendrons, blue skies and pine needles under foot. Met ridge runner, Moxy, at lunch at Longs Creek falls... really pretty spot. Found someone's nice wool hoodie on the trail and after last night's cold we knew someone would be missing it. Sunshine all day in the Georgia woods. We ended up pitching our tent in the campsite before the shelter because we thought it would more protected. Wish we had pushed on to the shelter because it looked like a fun group. We did take the sweater up to the shelter and found its very grateful owner, Paul from Baton Rouge. Got a trail comso from Cosmo as a reward for our efforts. Hopefully we will see some of those folks tomorrow night, or down the trail.","Stover Creek shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626546,"Up and out by 9... much better than yesterday. Sassafras (MTN) kicked our ass! It was a brutal, rocky, rooty uphill. We kept telling ourselves ""lunch at the top, lunch at the top!"" We sat and ate our sausage and cheese. One guy we met got a ride into town. He was really hurting. Next mountain wasn't so bad. Another relatively warm day, lots of mountain laurel. They must be beautiful when they're in bloom. Made it to Gooch Gap shelter. Lots of nice folks.","Hawk Mountain campsite

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626547,"We got out early today because we heard that rain was on the way. Made it about an hour and a half before it started. Put the rain gear on and slogged up and down some unnamed Georgia mountains. It was really coming down, the wind picked up and the temp dropped back into the 40's. Right around lunch time we hit Woody's Gap and it was pouring. We met up with the Aussies, Jo and Steve, and decided to catch a ride with them and share a cabin at Blood Mountain. We were all cold and soaked. We'll get a ride back to the same spot in the morning, and take 2 days to hike right back here. Ha!","Gooch Gap shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626576,"Got up this morning and were able to get a shuttle back to Woody Gap, where we left off yesterday. It was still pouring rain and we thought we'd try to make Woods Hole shelter. As we kept walking, the weather was not so bad and we were all feeling pretty good. We, along with Jo and Steve decided to go for the whole shebang and hike back to Neel Gap over the infamous Blood Mountain! The further we went the more the rain let up. Temps were in the 50's and when we got to the base of the big mountain, the sun actually came out. Up we went and were rewarded with beautiful views at the top! Really cool old stone shelter at the top, too. We were pretty tired by the time we got down the mountain across some pretty treaterous granite faces in our muddy boots. Since the hostel at Mountain Crossing was full, we were able to find some less than perfect campsites up on the hill behind....dinner and bed!","Woody Gap

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626627,"Up and out of Neel Gap. The rain held off and it was cloudy. I'm sorry for the obsession with the weather but that kinda happens when you spend all day and night outside. ? Jo and Steve got a headstart so they could meet their hostel host who promised them the best burgers they'd ever tasted. When we climb up and over to Tesnatee Gap they was some glorious trail magic waiting for us. A couple of retired guys who enjoyed the trail so much that they wanted to give back. They had chairs out and were serving burgers and hot dogs with drinks, chips, candy, cupcakes! It was really amazing. We sat and chatted with them for a while. They passed on a message from Jo and Steve that they would have a surprise for us. We met up with their hostel host who brought us treats, including Yuengling (?)! We had been talking about how nice a cold beer would be after a long day of hiking. So we have now introduced them to both Yoo-hoo and Yuengling! ?
We hiked in a bit after Hogpen Gap and set up our tents in a nice clearing. Rain held off all day!","Neel Gap
",White Oak stamp campsite,"Mar 04, Wed",7.80
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626628,"This was the worst day of hiking so far...we might even say ever for us! It rained all day... relentless, horizontal wind swept sleet on the ridges kind of rain! The only way we stayed reasonably warm was on the uphill slogs. Everything was wet. Thank goodness the terrain wasn't too, too strenuous, tho there were some really rocky challenges.
For a long stretch we walked along what we think must have been an old logging road. You could see old stone supports on inside corners as we made turns along the side of the hill, and the path was wider than the usual single file path. Some areas the rocks were so covered in thick heavy moss that the mist and rain made it look like an old druid forrest. We'll post some pictures when we get more time. 
When we finally reached the shelter, we were completely exhausted, freezing and soaked. It was only about 3:30 but all we wanted was our was hot dinner and to crawl into our tent and sleeping bags to warm up. Our challenge now is to try and dry our our puffy jackets somehow because tomorrow's high is only supposed to be 35!","White Oak stamp campsite

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626954,"After the cold and rain, we decided to take our nero day one day early and got a shuttle into Helen instead of Hiawassee. It ended up being a beautiful day, but we did our laundry and hung out our tent, sleeping bags, etc all over the hotel room to dry. We walked down the street to the overpriced but cute grocery to resupply. Found lots of flavors of our standard fare of potatoes, pasta sides, and little packets of tuna or chicken, and even banana chips! It's hard to have fruit on the trail. ?Vocab lesson for those not familiar....a zero day is a day that you don't hike, staying somewhere for more than one night. A nero day is a day that you hike for part of a day and then do errands or chores and possibly stay one night in town.Helen is such a cute little town! Apparently they decided in the late 60's to do something to their depressed town to generate income. They hired an artist and chose to turn it into the cutest little Alpine village! We spoke to someone who said it's one of the top tourist towns in Georgia.","Blue Mountain shelter
","Helen, GA","Mar 06, Fri",2.40
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626699,"We were up for our shuttle back to Unicoi Gap. It was cold to start but a big uphill start warmed us up. A glorious day today, weather wise. Blue skies all day, not a cloud in the sky, temps started in the 30's and ended in the 50's. Between the cold temps and all the wind yesterday, all the mud was dried up and there were the coolest ice formations along the side of the trail. Lot's more of the ups and downs we have become so familiar with...false summits to lure us into joy at reaching the top. ,We stopped for lunch at Tray mountain shelter. It was a little creepy because it looked like someone was living there. Our campsite at Sassafras Gap is nice, tho the water source is .2 miles downhill to the stream, which means of course .2 miles back up with your full water bottles.
We were treated to a beautiful sunset as we cooked our ramen dinner. The almost full moon was rising on the other side. It will be another cold night but we're getting used to it.","Unicoi Gap
",Sassafras Gap,"Mar 07, Sat",10.40
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626883,"Chilly morning but a beautiful sunrise. Clocks changed last night so sunrise is earlier by the clock. Clear day again, which means when our water hit the air for coffee it froze...qualifying as the coldest day yet. All clothes on to start. We followed our usual schedule of 5-6 miles then a lunch break and 4-5 miles after. There was trail magic at our lunch spot at Dick's Gap!  Chips, beer, coffee...and a woman who ran a local B&B brought her extra fresh baked scones and breakfast muffins, all bagged in pairs! What a treat! Arrived at the shelter exhausted and feet sore. Shelter is again .2 miles off the trail so I think we need to add another 1/2 mile to our tally...especially when you add a run for water, which is almost never close. Tried instant mashed potatoes with hickory smoked tuna (go figure) tonight. It was better in concept. Shelter itself was crowded and there were at least 10 tents setup around it.","Sassafras Gap
",Plumorchard Gap Shelter,"Mar 08, Sun",10.80
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626884,"Today we made our first state line! 4.4 miles out of the shelter we hit the North Carolina border. Just past that, we topped the incline and found a nice little gap for lunch to celebrate. It's a really good feeling...like we have accomplished something, however small. We know it's just a drop in the bucket. We called Donna's brother to confirm our meet up on Thursday. He's driving his RV down from Maryland to meet us and maybe do a little support thru the Smokies. We keep hearing about snow in the Smokies so we are doing the our best anti-snow dance to keep us warm and chase that snow away. Have to say it was warmer this morning. All 4 of us actually started the day in our short sleeve shirts! That lasted thru the first 1,600 climb, then the clouds started to roll in and out came the long sleeves and fleece again. We hit the highest peak so far, Courthouse Bald at 4,708. We anticipate either a 9.3 or 12.5 mile day tomorrow, depending on weather (rain, go figure) and our feet. These climbs are descents have bee brutal on our still acclimating bodies and tomorrow afternoon we hit another high peak (5,435) 1,100 feet over 2.4 miles, which is a pretty gentle climb, but 35 pounds gets heavy. The bad thing about carrying the bear canisters is that your pack weight does not go down that much. We also have to reassess the weight and types of foods we are carrying. It's all part of the process.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter
",Muskrat Creek Shelter,"Mar 09, Mon",7.30
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626886,"We got up and out by 8 AM, just as the rain was starting. I say starting because it rained all day. We had planned a 12.5 mile day, our longest yet, with a 9.3 mile contingency plan if we couldn't make it all the way. We knew we had Standing Indian Mountain to climb as well, at 5435. Let me tell you, so far North Carolina seems to handle the mountain trails a little better that Georgia. The grade was so gentle that we barely knew we were climbing. Once we hit the top, it was a nice flat ridge for a while. Walking along a ridge in the rain, the wind comes up both sides bringing some more stinging sleet, but we just pull our hoods tighter around our faces and carry on. We have discovered that our supposed waterproof jackets are not. We were soaked thru. What we learned from last rainy day...absolutely no puffies until we are in the tent with no possibilities of getting them wet, and keep them stored in dry bags when not.
We did make our 12.5 miles and the rain let up enough at then end of the day to pitch our tents. We cooked in the small shelter at Carter Gap, along with everyone else trying to dry out their clothes. Rosie, the adorable golden retriever, now covered in mud, was with her ""parents"" Nora ""woohoo"" and Robert. After much convincing, I think that Robert may be ready to swap his Dragonfly stove for a PocketRocket, and his First Need filter water pump for a Sawyer squeeze. Ha! The night is so foggy that our headlamps are useless. As usual in our tent and sleeping bags by 8 PM.","Muskrat Creek Shelter
",Carter Gap Shelter,"Mar 10, Tue",12.50
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626887,"Blue skies! We packed up our soggy gear and put on what we could to dry it our with our body warmth. Can't say enough about merino wool! Best stuff ever! Doesn't retain stink and keeps you warm even when wet. Absolute necessities on our little adventure. :)
We got a late start  this AM. More gentle slopes. It was a little warmer today, and we had glimpses of blue skies all day. I don't think I have mentioned the steep edges that the trail goes along. Most of the time, we walk along a trail that falls off very steeply to one side or the other. The path itself can be as narrow as about 18 inches. Best way to handle it is to watch for your next foot fall between all the rocks and roots. Today we hit a point with a beautiful view of the mountains when we looked down and saw that the only thing between us and a sheer rock cliff were some tree roots! We had gorgeous views today of the mountains. It was misty in valley below us. We'll upload pictures but they will not do it justice. 
We stopped for lunch just before the climb to the fire tower at Albert Mountain. That was a very steep climb! At some points, we had to use our hands to crawl across the rocks to help us up. At points with all the rhododendron and the other small, purple leafed plants along the edges, the trail looked like it was designed by a demented landscaper who was laughing at us crawling across the steepness. At the top, the fire tower itself was locked so we couldn't get in after we climbed up to see the view. We reached the 100 mile mark!!  Woohoo... another milestone. An easy downhill to the shelter, which was relatively new (2012) and really nice looking with a double deck sleep platform and picnic table. We set out our wet tents and various other wet things on the bushes and trees while we cooked dinner and cleaned up. It's approaching hiker midnight....8PM or sundown.","Carter Gap Shelter
",Long Branch Shelter,"Mar 11, Wed",8.70
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626888,"The rain stayed away while we packed up our tents, etc., for a short day. We cooked our oatmeal and coco breakfast and headed out. The rain started after about an hour and a half. Just past Rock Gap shelter we came to a road crossing with trail magic! A teacher from Texas and some of his college students were there with Burger King croisandwiches and Pepsi's! Perfect timing! We chatted with them for a while. They just love visiting with all the thru hikers who come thru. The teacher had lived in Australia for 6 years so he really enjoyed talking to Jo & Steve. The folks who do these trail magic stop are just amazing people and so pleasant to talk to. They are genuinely interested in the experience.
2 more hours and we could see Donna's brother's RV sitting in the parking lot at the bottom of the hill. 4 drowned hiker rats descended upon him, and we stuffed our wet packs in his outside storage. We dropped of the Aussies and headed back for an afternoon of laundry and showers. Tomorrow is our first real zero! Ahhhhhh.....","Long Branch Shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626955,"We woke up in the RV again this am, had another nice breakfast with Donna's brother and packed up to get back on the trail. Donna's ankles were swollen again this morning and we think it might be a reaction to the anti-inflammatories we've taken. (note...they were much better when we stopped at 3:00 today)
We picked up Steve and Jo and headed out at about noon for a short day, mostly uphill. It actually felt good to be back on the trail. The rain only came in sprinkles today.","Winding Stair Gap
",Siler Bald shelter,"Mar 14, Sat",4.20
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626998,"Another day of rain and thick fog for the first half. We got to Wayah Tower by about 1:00 after a long brutal uphill and it was so foggy we saw nothing of the view and barely found the tower. It's what's left of an old stone ranger station built by the CCC.
The sun tried to peek thru as the day went on. Still lots of very slippery mud. Bob decided to test that and ended up in a slow motion fall. He was unhurt, except maybe for his pride.
After the last mile uphill to the shelter, and by cruel joke, another tenth of a mile uphill to the tent area, we arrived exhausted. There is actually a nice view of the valley below. The sun came out a bit and left patchy cloud shadows across the valley. We seem to be fairly high up.
Good group of people huddled around the comically small picnic table all with their various canister stoves, boiling water for dinner....a father and son from New Brunswick, the four of us, a newly graduated forestry student from the UP doing the trail before he starts grad school. We do run into a lot of the same people from shelter to shelter. The only ones we see only once are the youngsters who come cruising past us doing 20+ mile days already. Sheesh!","Silver Bald shelter
",Cold Spring shelter,"Mar 15, Sun",12.10
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627036,"Day started out as usual, hiking in fog so heavy that it almost felt like rain...but not quite. We couldn't see any of the views we were sure we were passing. We came down into Tellico Gap and were greeted with a sign announcing trail magic ahead! A lovely couple had come out with drinks, chips, cookies, candy! He was a recently retired white water canoe instructor from the NOC and she was a recently retired park ranger from Smokies National Park. Interesting to talk to.
After an up and a down and another up we finally stopped for a bite to eat and actually had a view. We then headed off for the long downhill into the NOC. Wow, some scary stuff on the way down! I kept cursing the demented soul who laid out this trail. I tried to take pictures but I know they won't begin to show how precarious the going was. Jo and I had sent the guys ahead to see if we could get space at the NOC bunk house.
Jo and I got to the NOC (this is where, among other things, there is a whitewater slolum racing course used for training Olympic kayakers) we discovered that it had just been closed due to the Covid-19 virus! We have been discussing how this outbreak would affect our thru hike. Are we safer out in the woods or not? Are the closures going to prevent us from re supplying and finishing our hike?
For tonight, we found a place to stay and a shuttle ride back to the trail tomorrow. The woman who is shuttling us is heading off in a few weeks to be a river guide in West Virginia at ACE Adventures! A few of our friends know that place. :)","Cold Spring shelter
",NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center),"Mar 16, Mon",11.70
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627058,"This morning before our shuttle arrived, we decided to walk across the street to the Bojangles to get a quick breakfast. The door was locked and the sign on the door said that only the drive thru was open. Well, all 4 of us walked, in the pouring rain, in our rain gear, to the drive thru. There was already a short line of cars so we got in line. When it was our turn, we quickly discovered that we humans could not trigger the voice on the other side to take our order. The very nice gentleman behind us in a pickup saw our plight and pulled forward just enough to trigger the voice and allowed us to place our order. We waved our thanks and walked around the corner to the window. We got our food and the laughing employee said that this was a first. Welcome to our new reality! Thanks, Covid-19!
So, today's hike started in a complete downpour, but that only lasted about an hour and a half. It was a big climb out of the NOC, but not too steeply to start. There were moments later in the day that Bob compared to anything he'd experienced in Maine. Not sure if that gave me solace that this is some of the toughest stuff. Anyway, the sun actually came out for a bit around 2 and was in and out until we arrived at the shelter at about 4. A short day but pretty tough is spots.

",Sassafras Gap shelter,"Mar 17, Tue",6.90
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627203,"Today started much like the others with us up a little before dawn packing up the contents of our tent. Take off the long underwear we've been sleeping in, put on our grubby hiking pants and 2-3 day old socks (that have been drying in sleeping bags overnight), stuff our sleeping bags into their stuff sacks, deflate our sleeping pads, and what layers we'll need to great the sunrise. We actually could see the sunrise this morning and it wasn't too cold, around 45 degrees. No rain, in fact we haven't had to pack up camp in the rain yet. It just rains while we are hiking. Breakfast consists of two bags of instant oatmeal and a cup of coffee. Donna can eat oatmeal every day but it's starting to wear on me. 
Once we finish eating, we pack up the tent, pack our packs, hit the privy (if necessary), and start hiking. We've generally been able to get on the trail between 8:30 and 9:00. Today's destination is Brown Fork Gap Shelter, 9.1 miles away and started with a steep climb up Cheoh Bald. Like all the previous balds we've climbed it was socked in. Welcome to the cloud forest of North Carolina. I'm sure there is a wonderful view on clear days since the elevation is at 5,062 ft.
Most days we've been hiking straight through to a lunch. Today we decended 5 miles and 2000 feet down from Cheoh Bald to Stecoah Gap for a lunch of cheese and summer sausage  on a tortilla. 
After lunch it was only 2.4 miles to the shelter up Jacob's Ladder. More like the Devil's Staircase. It was about 900 vertical feet straight up the side of the hill. At some point I think the grade was 45 to 50 degrees, with no switchbacks. Quite the killler but we made it to the shelter, after a few choice words.
We haven't stayed in a shelter yet since they are often full when we get there and not all that appealing. There is also the mouse issue. We normally pitch our tent near the shelter, hopefully on a flat spot. We try to stay near a shelter because they are located near a good water source and a privy is nearby. Also many of the shelters have picknic tables for cooking dinner.
We've generally been getting to camp between four and six, set up our tent, blow up our sleeping pads and fluff up our sleeping bags. Next we filter enough water for dinner, breakfast and the next days hiking. Dinner tonight was was Mountain House chilli Mac with beef for Bob and a Knorr pasta side with tuna for Donna, washed down with hot cocoaor tea.
By now it's getting dark so it's time for bed.  We'll usually stay up another hour checking our phones if we reception or listening to a podcast. Tomorrow we get up and do it all over again. Hope you enjoyed our long winded day in the life of a AT thru-hiker.","Sassafras Gap shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627204,"Today was another short day. We were all in our short sleeves pretty quickly this morning. The terrain was pretty gentle today so our pace was closer to 2 miles per hour instead of our normal 1.5 miles per hour. We got to the shelter by 1 so we were able to relax and eat lunch. We felt pretty decadent stopping so early but it was really nice to relax for a bit and enjoy the outdoors we came to experience. We listened to podcasts or watched videos on our phones, or just lay down and watched the clouds moving across the blue skies.Jo and I visited with Cathy from Virginia who came in after we did. We had run into her at the shelter last night. She is about 10 years older than we are and was out on the trail to figure out who she is .... not be a mom or a grandma. She told us that she is getting off the trail tomorrow in Fontana. Not sure if she's just done for now or maybe her family might want her to come home because of the virus. We have a resupply box waiting for us in Fontana and we'll take a zero before we head out into the mythical Smokies!","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Quick climb over two unknown peaks (knobs) and then a very long descent (really hard on the knees) downhill to Fontana Village. Lots of wild flowers were in bloom towards the bottom...tiny white flowers, red trillium starting to bloom. We saw Robert, Nora and Rosie, the wonder golden, at the base. They were about to meet the person who is going to board her while they go thru the Smokies because dogs are not allowed in the NP. We shuttled to Fontana Lodge to zero tomorrow. Their restaurant is take out only but any take out is better than food that has to be rehydrated!

It was a long hard day and we didn't get to the shelter until 7:15. Most folks were in bed or nearly (hikers are usually in bed by sunset) and the shelter was full. We set up our tents and made a hasty, late dinner. By the time we were done the fog had rolled in so thickly that we had trouble finding our tent from the shelter where we had cooked and eaten.

We debated for a while, but the longer we stayed still the colder we got... which made our decision for us. The rain and wind got much worse! We laid out our sleeping bags and pads on the platform in the shelter to warm up. The wind was violently flapping the tarp covering to the shelter. As the afternoon went on we were glad we made the decision to stay. Other hikers came running in in ones and twos, all soaked to the bone! The shelter filled up.

We had our rain gear and gaters on, sloshing thru the mud and water. Since our boots and socks were still wet from yesterday's deluge the water filled trail hardly mattered.
Today, however, a shadow was spotted at about 11 o'clock! It was almost a Kodak moment ? The higher we climbed up Clingman's Dome the brighter it got. We even started to get glimpses of views of the Smokies. By lunch time we made it to the highest point on the trail (I think), Clingman's Dome, and the sun was shining! The trail bisects the park roughly following the Tennessee/North Carolina border. The cool part was that on the Tennessee side the clouds were rolling up the mountain throwing spectors of cloud vapor thru the forest and across the trail, while on the North Carolina side it was clear as a bell and cloudless. We luxuriated in an hour and a half lunch break in the sun directly under the big spiral ramp that runs up to the top of the tower. The views from the tower were spectacular! We sat with Leftie (an amazing one armed thru hiker!) and Chopper (flew helicopters in the military) and 2 other women. It was also the 200 mile mark! Having the sun come out after so much rain really lifts your spirits. The forest has changed from almost dead looking oaks and beech to shaded, sweet smelling hemlock and fir.
Tonight's shelter is half a mile off the trail down a track that was another water filled creek bed. It was deeper into the woods than most shelters. There was very little tent space and what was there was swampy so we decided to sleep in the shelter again. A few others in the shelter tried to build a fire but everything was too wet. I don't like sleeping in shelters, partially because I don't like mice. Call me a wimp but I pull the drawstring on my sleeping bag down to a 4"" opening around my face so I can still breathe.","Silers Bald shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627419,"Today was a glorious, sunny day! We hiked the half mile back to the actual trail and started hiking north again. The sun and boreal forest is just so pretty. It makes the going so much easier. We're hearing more birds, too. It was about a 4 mile walk to the parking lot at New Found Gap road (which divides Smokies National Park). The park is officially closed and we weren't sure what we would find. We have heard lots of rumors out here, most of them have been baseless. No rangers were there to kick us out of the park, nor was there a phone number to call to get a shuttle ride out. One park employee came thru while several of us were eating lunch and asked if we were all ok and if we had heard of anyone who wasn't feeling well. A lot of the trail towns are worried about thru hikers bringing the virus to their town and passing it along the trail. We understand their concerns (mostly because of limited medical facilities) but most of the hiker community think we are healthier because we have minimal contact with people. There is much discussion of whether we are safer on or off the trail.
Our shelter tonight is one of the highest on the trail at 5920 ft. There must be almost a dozen tents scattered around the woods around it. We actually got a tent spot on actual grass in front of the shelter. We got in early enough that we could dry everything out in the sun. We have a spectacular view both East and west and we had a really nice sunset.","Mt. Collins shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628845,"Sunrise this morning was amazing! We had a perfect view without even leaving our tent! Several of the other hikers had gotten up early to come over from their tents to the patch of grass in front of the shelter where several of us had tented to watch the sunrise, too. Another beautiful day. Since we have a resupply box waiting for us at Standing Bear hostel, our food is getting low so our packs are lighter. It really felt good to put on our lighter packs in the sunshine and head out of camp on a downhill. It’s the little things…. ?
Jo and Steve headed out of camp before us so we could catch up. We had views on both sides of the ridge the trail followed. We walked out to Charlies Bunion…which was a thrill… The short path to this rocky outcrop was a little scary! It ran along an edge with shear drop offs, only a bit of shrubbery keeping us in! Views were pretty spectacular, and of course Bob had us sit and pose for a selfie sitting up on the rock. Yikes!

The weather was good all day and ups and the terrain was level-ish. We followed the ridge line most of the way. For stretches of it you could see down each side. Sometimes you had to concentrate on the trail ahead of you to keep from getting the heebie-jeebies looking at the drop off on either side!

It was a long day into Tri-Corner shelter. All the tent spots around the shelter were taken, but we were so tired after the long day that we didn’t head to the last available tenting area up the hill behind the shelter near the horse tie up. We got lazy and decided to stay in the shelter, since it was empty when we got here. Luckily the water source ran right in front of the shelter, which is a treat.","Icewater Spring shelter

The shelter filled up with younger hikers, who had more energy than we did.  The concept of “hiker midnight” was discussed and they were gracious about it. ?
Another bright, sunny day that started out cool and warmed up enough to take off a few layers. We passed meadows full of pretty little white flowers scattered among the trees. Sun and flowers are just enough to make you smile as you are walking. ?

We got to Cosby Knob shelter pretty early. Most of the people staying last night are pushing on the 17 miles or so to Standing Bear Farm so it is mostly the little group of oldsters here tonight. Sometimes it’s nice to get to our destination early enough to relax and enjoy the camp site. Isn’t that a big reason we are here?! We setup our tents downhill from the shelter. There is a good stream running beside the shelter down the hill, so the water source is close again. It makes up for all the muddy steep embankments we had to climb up and down to fetch water! The stream below us is large enough to soak our aching feet, if you can handle the freezing cold water!

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628848,"Another beautiful day…nice enough to hike in our short sleeves and zip off our pants. We were anxious to get down to someplace to clean up and get something to eat besides ramen and tuna! The downhill was welcome, but brutal…..if that makes sense. It was 7 miles of almost constant downhill. It’s easier on the quads and lungs, but horrible on your knees!! Mine were absolutely screaming by the time we got down to Davenport Gap! We made the last 5 miles or so in less than 2 hours, which is a new speed record!
The lower we got in altitude, the more wild flowers appeared. We got down to the Davenport Gap road crossing and put the second copy of our permits in the box as we officially exited the Smokies. There were signs posted at the trailhead that the Smokies were closed from Fontana Dam to Davenport Gap. We got out with no one waiting there to arrest us!  The rumors you hear on the trail are pretty amazing.

We crossed the road and eventually headed into the prettiest stretch of the trail so far! The trail began following a stream, which was roaring with all the rain we’d had over the last week. The stream tumbled over rocks and waterfalls, and got wider as we descended. Along the bottom, the edges of the trail were alive with all kinds of wild flowers in bloom...jack-in-the-pulpit, red, white and yellow trilliums, redbud trees, and several others we couldn’t identify. So beautiful!

We came out of the woods, crossed the Pigeon River bridge on the road, and walked under I-40. That was a little surreal…walking along a road, dodging cars going onto the highway onramp. We headed up a crumbling, steep stone stairway and back into the woods. We kept expecting to see Standing Bear Farm around every bend in the trail but it was 2 miles before we got here. Is it around this corner? Noooo, not yet…
I have nicknamed Standing Bear the “hippy farm.” Not sure what I was expecting but it is very eclectic and kind of adorable. Maybe that is because the sun is shining and the redbuds and flowers on the property are all blooming. The cabin straddling the stream was open so we all decided to stay there instead of sharing the bunk house. Besides, the beds look comfier. We bought beers and cans of chips and settled in on the porch with smiles on our faces. Feels like heaven!","Cosby Knob Shelter

Bob and I had a resupply box waiting for us, and Jo and Steve were able to resupply at the small shop here. We watched several people we had seen hiking over the past several days either staying here or passing thru. The “laundry facilities” consisted of a washboard in a sink and a semi-functioning dryer.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628850,"We decided to continue on today. Of course, it was raining. Raingear on and packs loaded with only 3 days of food, we headed off toward Hot Springs. It was a nasty hill again. The weather app shows that there is a system that just sitting over us, spinning. The higher up the hill we got the colder it got and the rain did not let up. The fog rolled in at the top so we could see almost nothing….except some strange spaceship looking thing, which was a little creepy, humming in the mist. (turned out to be an unmanned FAA navigation station)
We got so wet and cold that I could not get my soaking wet wool mittens back on my hands after taking them off to make an adjustment. I ended up screaming and swearing in frustration. It was my first true breakdown of the trip.

We reached the shelter fairly early and the rain let up just enough for us to put up our tents because we knew it would start again. We decided to eat our hot dinner meal for lunch because we all needed to warm up. Jo was wrapped in her quilt in the shelter and I was shivering so badly I couldn’t stop.

A couple was already huddled in the shelter, working on 24 miles with 24 beers in 24 hours. Not the best weather for it. They were well into their challenge and pretty wasted. We did find out later that they made it out safely.
I called my sister. She relayed what was going on in the “real” world, and it sounds pretty grim. We had received a second email from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy today to ask everyone to get off the trail. This, they said, was to protect both the hikers and the small trail communities thru which the trail goes. We had been hearing all kinds of rumors about trail closures, people being arrested coming off the trail, and a 5:00 curfew in Hot Springs. We know most of this is exaggeration but it is becoming clear that the towns didn’t want us our here anymore.

Into the tent by 3:00, warm in our sleeping bags, listening to the radio and all the insanity swirling around this virus. We have made the hard decision to get off the trail. We found a shuttle driver who can take all four of us from Standing Bear to the Knoxville airport tomorrow to pick up a rental car. We have invited Jo and Steve to come home with us because they have nowhere else to go at this point. It would take them too many planes and trains to get back to Australia. If they do decide to go back, Chicago will probably have better flight options for them.","Standing Bear Farm

There was snow in the forecast and it did not disappoint! It started to snow as we walked out and by the time we got to the top of the mountain we had just climbed yesterday, there was about an inch and a half of snow on the ground!! It was laughable! We had snow the day we started and snow the day we ended.  The gods are funny.
Steve, as always, was hiking in shorts….in the snow! He doesn’t like long pants. Those Aussies are tough!

As we waited at Standing Bear for our shuttle, there were several others on their phones trying to arrange rides to get off the trail too. It’s reassuring that we are not the only ones making this decision. When we got to the Knoxville airport, it was a ghost town! I’ve never seen an airport so empty. I don’t think we counted more that a half a dozen people, and they were all employees.  Very surreal!","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629050,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are back on the trail!
We made the decision about 3 weeks ago and we drove back down to NC yesterday to get back on. Bob's cousins very graciously put us up and then another cousin drove us to the trailhead at Max Patch. It's not the exact location where we left off but we are not going to quibble about 6 miles. Besides, we did the 7 miles from Standing Bear to Groundhog Creek shelter and back so we're good on miles!
We got right back into hiking mode. The weather is in the high 60's low 70's which is fantastic! We left Chicago in the 90's. The hiking was fairly gentle and we were excited to see the rhodedendrons still in bloom! We missed the bright purple and pink ones but we are happy to see the white ones. Water is plentiful since it poured last night where we were staying. One big uphill, a thousand feet in 1.2 miles, kicked our out of shape butts! 
There are very few people on the trail right now, partially because it is mid-week and partially because of Covid. We got to the shelter at about 3 and found one woman in the shelter by herself. She was very happy to see us.  She has been section hiking the AT for the past few years by herself because her husband is not a backpacking fan (too many years in the army airborne) We had a nice chat with her while we all made and ate dinner. We may hike with her tomorrow but she's going the full 13 miles into Hot Springs... could be too many miles for our second day. We put our tent up just as, you guessed it, the skies opened up! Welcome back to the trail! 
Just a note....we left our bear canisters at home to save some weight. We have practiced the PCT hang for a bear bag, but will hope for bear cables as often as we can. These are permanent steel cables installed at shelters so that hikers can easily hang their food without the ""fun"" of throwing a rock bag over a tree limb, potentially wacking yourself in the head and hauling up 10 pounds of food with a thin rope.","Max Patch

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629063,"We got a good start this morning...on the trail by 8:00. The weather started well, but over the first climb it started to warm up. There were a lot of long ups and downs today and by the time we got to the shelter we were both dripping and exhausted. We had to just sit for quite a while before we had the energy to do anything. The shelter was .2 miles off the trail in one direction and the water source was .2 miles off the trail in the other direction. This means that after a 10 mile, hot day of hiking, we have to walk almost an additional mile to get water! Sometimes I want to sit down and have a little talk with the folks who lay out the shelter locations.
It's interesting to see as we are hiking that the trail is so overgrown. There have been so few people on the trail this year and no trail maintainers. There is only a narrow path to walk in some places due to the encroaching growth. The rhodedendrons are shedding their blossoms and it leaves the trail strewn with white petals, which is really pretty.
We didn't make it the last 3 miles into Hot Springs this afternoon because we were just too pooped. By taking a short hiking day into town and neroing tomorrow we can get our errands done and head off the next day.
There are several other people in the shelter tonight. We met a father and daughter, who restarted their thru hike a few weeks, and as I type this several more people have arrived. Time to lay down and relax. ?","Walnut Mountain shelter

It's very nice to sit on the porch in a rocking chair and visit with them. Seats with backs are something we all miss on the trail and a rocking chair is pure bliss!
First thing we did was wash off the sweaty grime and put on clean clothes. It's 90 degrees here in Hot Springs. We walked down the hill into town and had huge burgers at the Smokie Mountain Diner. The town is a typical small trail town, with a good diner, a couple of bars and restaurants, a Dollar General, and a hardware store. This town also has a really well equipped outfitter. We headed there to grab a couple of dehydrated dinners (which make a welcome break from ramen and instant mashed potatoes ?) and a different pair of socks, since I had bought the wrong size.
We're going to chill here on the porch for a while then maybe grab a beer in town with dinner. Tomorrow is 11 miles, starting with a big uphill.","Deer Park shelter

We had dinner last night at Spring Creek tavern with the crew of hikers staying at Laughing Heart. The 8 of us sat outside on the balcony overlooking the river and both entertained and possibly annoyed the other patrons with hiker stories and hiker TMI. We then all got a couple of bottles of wine and went down to soak our sore feet in the river. Great fun! ?
The rest of the crew were out a little before us this morning to try and beat the heat. It was a hot one today! We stopped for a breakfast biscuit at the Smoky Mountain Diner and headed off. 
Today was just a fun filled day of hot, muggy, rainy, and UPHILL.... practically all day uphill! We let our cardio slide way too much during our downtime. The hour long rain shower was the highlight of the day. Unlike freezing rain in March, summer rain is a welcome relief from the heet and humidity....no rain jackets needed!
We crossed over highway 40 on a bridge and waved to the startled drivers. We'd heard from another hiker that there had been a sighting of a momma bear and cub today on the trail. The bears use the trail, too, which was very evident by the number of piles of scat! We even saw a sign posted on a tree exclaiming that it was a NC bear sanctuary! On the AT? Seriously? Come on folks!
The shelter tonight was not a good one. The water was .2 down a steep hill (after we'd been climbing all day) and the privy is in urgent need of some maintenance. The mosquitoes and flies are biting like mad, so we quickly got water, cooked and ate dinner, put up the tent and crawled in. This of course was just in time for the rain to start.

I have welts on my legs that are a little scary looking. I think I reacted to whatever bit me. Needless to say I zipped the bottoms back on my pants for today's hike. After the nice, cooling rain, we both slept for a while, then I woke up to a tiny little mouse running across our tent! It was under the tent fly, scurrying over the no-see-um (?) I flicked it off and then heard it scratching next to my head outside near my pack. I did a mental inventory of anything left in my pack that it might want to get to. I punched at the tent from the inside to scare it away and it finally scurried back over the tent to the other end and off. That was all I heard of it, but I stayed awake quite a bit longer, as you can imagine. I don't like mice!! Bob, of course, slept through it. While I was awake, I got to hear a couple of owls screeching loudly. I'm not sure what kind they are. We've heard them before out here. The moon also came out and lit up the tent so much that I thought it was a flashlight. Ah, nighttime in a tent.
Today's hike was mostly uphill but much more gently than yesterday. I've realized that my knees much prefer uphill to down. It was hot but not quite as muggy as yesterday. We did enjoy a nice breeze when we were on the windy side along the ridge. The sun was out and peaking thru the trees most of the day. There really weren't any good views, just a lot of rhodedendron tree tunnels, sometimes very dark. We see a lot of the same plants along the trail. Some of the most interesting plants we see along the trail are the many different kinds of fungi.  I've noticed that when we see poison ivy, it seems to be within .1 or .2 miles of a trail head. Not sure if that is relevant.....but we have a lot of time on our hands to think as we hike.?
We met a guy at tonight's shelter who works as a bartender at a restaurant in Wilmington, NC (when there is no pandemic). We told him we'd look him up when we're there. He is just getting into backpacking and is out doing a 6 day section of the trail.","Spring Mountain shelter

Last night, I heard the distinctive rattle of metal. This is not a sound normally heard in the woods at night. I heard it a couple of times as over a period of about an hour. All I could think of was bear....and it was going after our food! At 3:00, Bob and I finally decided that we had to defend our provisions and got out of the tent armed with our trekking poles and very loud police whistles. We discovered that what we think was a flying squirrel had breeched Bob's food bag, hung from the bear cables, and was chowing down! We madly shook the cables but the little rat fink would not let go...both feet gripping the wire and spinning around it as we shook. The other hiker (Harrison) was up too and we all rehung our food bags from trees, which is not an easy task in the dark! We thought that maybe the squirrels were more habituated to the cables and our food would be safer in a tree. This was the first time we had heard of anyone having trouble with critters getting into their food bag while on a cable. I was bargaining with myself as I hiked today about what I could get rid of from my pack to justify getting the bear canister back.
The day did get better. After a steep initial climb the terrain became rolling. The one exception was a sign we saw that said there was a ""bad weather"" alternate blue blaze trail. We kept to the traditional AT and were rewarded with the best views we had seen on this leg. The trail, at this point, straddles NC and TN. When we looked out in the NC direction, the view is of green, tree covered rolling hills; in the TN direction, the view flattens out to farmland and towns. We also discovered why there was a need for a ""bad weather"" side trail. For 1.4 miles, we climbed over huge rocks and boulders. It was fun and challenging and a little nerve wracking in places. Some areas required both hands as well as our feet to negotiate.At the shelter, we ran into the Harrison, Wilmington guy from last night, and the father and daughter from Laughing Heart (Kenbo and Kayla).

Here it is, July in NC and we thought the fleece sleeping bags that I had made would be sufficient. The damp, humid air just makes it feel so much cooler than it actually is. We think we have figured out a layering strategy for the next cool night.
It was an uphill start to the day. We got to an overgrown meadow. It was roughly the size of several football fields covered with dense, chest high brambles, across which blooming morning glories were crawling. Little clouds of mist would roll past as we walked. The trail was in need of a good treatment with a weed whacker to clear the path. We used our trekking poles in sort of a cowcatcher formation to get thru.
The rest of the day was mostly a gentle downhill. It was a short day so that we can rest our legs and do some camp chores. The water source is good and close, which makes it easier to wash what needs to be washed. We won't hit a town for a zero for another four days so this is almost a nero. It's a really pretty shelter and camp site. The day is beautiful and the sun is filtering down thru the trees.... the only sounds are the birds and the stream down the trail.
We came across a trail maintainer out with a big weed whacker. He was probably in his 70's out volunteering for the NC AT Mountain Club. We thanked him profusely for his efforts, because he had been clearing the trail for miles!
There was a guy (David ""Peterbuilt"" from Asheville) here when we arrived at the shelter. He had come into our shelter late last night and he was here making his lunch when we arrived.

She was a retired nurse and had done the triple crown of long trails... the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest trail, and the Continental Divide trail.
We were up and out by 8:00 this morning. It was another beautiful day. We have been so lucky with our weather... especially compared to March! I'd say it has been the high 70's or low 80's during the day, maybe 60's at night. Because of the nature of the trail, we spend all day hiking in a forrest....in the shade, which keeps us cooler when we rest for a few minutes. Between our light day yesterday and a good breakfast, we had good energy for this morning's uphill. It was a gentle climb again. This whole area seems so much easier than what we went through in Georgia and the Smokies.
We stopped on a mountain top for lunch on a nice log. We were under an oak and maple canopy, without any branches for maybe 30 feet up the trunks. Glimpses of blue sky peaked through the tree cover. On the way up, there were places where the trees opened up and we got a beautiful view of all the tree dense hills we had been hiking over. In the distance, we could see some of the higher peaks ahead of us.... there is at least one 6,000 footer up there.

The moon is a waning quarter so it comes up late, and until it does, it is so dark under the tree cover that you can't see your had in front of your face. A little creepy if you have to get out of the tent after dark.... here in bear country.
The temperature warmed up today. The hike was a variety of uphills from gentle to ""please stop."" We had two separate stretches today of about half a mile apiece which were pretty tough. When the angle of ascent forces you to turn your feet out and walk duck footed, you know it's pretty steep. Thank goodness for our poles! The saving grace was the breeze that we had most of the day. It really helped keep us cooler.
As we reached about mile nine, we got our reward for the climb...Bald Mountain bald! A bald on the AT refers to usually a mountain top that is covered with a big grassy area. This bald was huge, breezy and surrounded by the most spectacular, 360 degree view of all the mountains we had been climbing, all the way back to the Smokies! We could see layer upon layer of mountains, getting greyer and more faint the further away they were. We ended up taking a half hour break there before descending the last mile to the shelter.
When we got to the shelter, it was very buggy, and the people from last night we expected to see must have gone on. It wasn't great so we decided to move on an extra .3 miles to a camping site with a close water source.

In the morning, the breeze was still with us for about an hour as we hiked, then we turned a corner on a ridge and the rest of the day we were on the leeward side of the mountains. No breeze made it a hot and sweaty day. We hear there is a storm heading our way, and we hear the thunder tonight, but the skies are still blue. We stopped several times today at streams and springs to soak our bandanas and pour them over our heads. Nothing like cold spring water to remotivate you to keep on hiking.
We met a southbounder who was continuing his hike from last year, ""Rambler."" We're pretty sure he got his name from his love of talking, as sure as we are that he hasn't had a fresh audience in a while.
The last mile or so the trail was covered with rhodedendron roots and there was a very steep dropoff on the right. One misstep and one of us would be skidding down the hill toward the ravine, only stopped by a rhodedendron or one of the many blown down trees. The thought made me very wary. There was one more short uphill at the end of the day....last quarter mile. The water source for the shelter was just as it started to climb, so we thought it would be best to fill up all our water bladders BEFORE we climbed the hill so we wouldn't have to come back. That meant a lot of extra weight...2.2 pounds per liter!
We are alone again tonight. I think the few hikers we've met may be it for a while... we'll see. Bob hung his third successful bear bag tonight on a branch 30 feet in the air on his first toss!!

No privies means there is always one area near the shelter that becomes a ""Charmin gardens"" from folks digging cat holes and burying their TP. There are also not always good trees to hang a bear bag. I know that a lot of folks sleep with their food bags in their tent, but we are not among them.","Campsite past Bald Mountain shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629304,"Last night was the warmest night so far. We realized that we were sleeping at a lower elevation than the previous shelters...the higher the elevation, the cooler the temperature, even at these relatively low elevations (3000-4500 ft). Anyway....it was also the stillest night we had passed. There wasn't a puff of air moving, which didn't help the temperature. Despite all this, we both slept. I'm getting better at identifying the various sounds at night....nuts and small sticks falling from trees, mice or chipmunks, the delicate, crunching footfalls of deer and the yet to be heard lumbering, smashing of a bear.
It got warmer as we descended toward Erwin, but our packs were almost empty of food and a lot lighter. Our spirits were lighter, too, because we were heading into Uncle Johnny's hostel and the first shower in a week!
It was a short day, only a little over six miles. There were the usual ups and downs until the last, longer, down to the hostel. We begin to hear the trucks breaking on the road (interstate 26 goes through the river valley) the trains, and then the smaller rapids on the Nolichucky river as we got closer. At one point, the trees opened up enough to get a great view of the river with the tree covered mountains behind it. We could look down and just make out people playing in the nice....cool.....water.
We made it to Uncle Johnny's by about 11:15 AM, got the lay of the land, dumped our packs in our room and hit the shower! Bliss! We spoke to Drew the other night who had promised us the most comfortable bed and I believe he delivered. We did our laundry...the washer and dryer sit on the outside, under an awning, of the bathhouse. The hostel has two free shuttles a day into Erwin for guests, one to Walmart and the other to the PO and Food City area. We caught the afternoon shuttle, bought some beer at Walmart and grabbed dinner at a little Italian place. We'd heard that the resupply is better at the grocery store, so we'll do that in the morning. When we got back, Katherine from CA, and the father and son (Travis and Gary) from Austin were grilling their dinner, so we chatted with them for a while.
We really wanted to see the comet tonight, since it's the first night we have been without complete tree cover......no such luck.","No Business Knob shelter
",Uncle Johnny's hostel,"Jul 17, Fri",6.20
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629346,"Drew was right about the comfy bed....wow, did we sleep well! The only reason we got up was to catch the 9:00 shuttle to town. We bought some coffees at a little shop, mailed some unnecessary weight items home and walked to the Food City for resupply. It was much better than the Walmart. We bought some, bbq for lunch, chicken, pork chops, and corn on the cob to grill for tonight and tomorrow night (after our slackpack). A slackpack is when you take a daypack with just the supplies you need for the day and someone drives you to the start of your hike or picks you up at the end and you return to your starting point. It allows you to maybe hike more miles without carrying the weight. We're planning a southbound slackpack  tomorrow of about 11.9 miles. Then the next day, they will take us back to the spot they took us and we will head north...no miles lost on the AT.
I met a woman named Janice ""Patience."" She and I talked about gear and trail advice, among other things. She is our age and is out section hiking by herself. Another 59 yo......I met another woman last night. What a good age! 
We took advantage of the proximity to the river and sat in it. The water isn't too cold because it's shallow, but it was sure refreshing! The current is strong so we stayed near the shore but, wow....it was like our own little whirlpool with a view ?
After we grilled our dinner, we visited with Janice some more, then went back to our cabin to cool. We waited until it got dark and went comet hunting again (Neowise). This time we had luck! One of the guys here had a pair of binoculars and we were able to find it! It is faint but once you find it with the binoculars, you can usually see it with the naked eye. Very cool!!...but we're nerds?","Uncle Johnny's hostel

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629361,"Today was our slackpack day. We shared the van ride to our trail destination with the father and son from Austin (Gary and Travis) and Catherine (a French Canadian who now lives in CA). The ride headed out later than we wanted, and it was an hour drive. The last 20 minutes were up a narrow, unimproved gravel road. The van from the hostel struggled around the ruts.
We had both emptied our packs of everything except what we needed for the day, plus 2 liters of water each. We were very happy to be so light! We said goodbye to the others because they were heading north and we were heading back south to the hostel (they had already done the section we were doing). Being so light weight, we were able to cover ground quicker than our usual slightly more than 1.5 miles per hour. We got to the Beauty Spot bald and were able to get another panoramic view of the mountains. There was an older couple sitting in chairs and the gentleman helped us find some of the mountains we had been over, and pointed out Mt Mitchell, the highest mountain on the east coast.
We had chosen to do this section as a southbound hike because it is mostly downhill that way. That may be easier cardiovascularly, but it's really hard on your knees! There were also lots of rocks and those blasted rhodedendron roots on the trail. I had my first face plant today...tho Bob tells me that it's not really a face plant of your face doesn't hit the ground. I respectfully disagree. Most of my bodyweight landed in the dense rhodedendron on the edge of the trail, but it was still ""trip over rock, fall forward like a tree."" No harm done except a bruised knee, so I was lucky. I shutter when I think of the damage a simple trip up could do.It was a long, hot day, and we were exhausted. We had heard a lot of thunder for the last half hour or so, but the skies didn't open up until about five minutes after we got back. A lot of the water sources we had passed today were dry, so this is much needed water.
We had a chuckle after dinner. Catherine, from this morning, was back at the hostel. She said she had gotten poured on up on a ridge, so she got a ride back. She was washing her shoes because they had gotten wet and, presumedly, muddy. No rain, no pain, no Maine!","Beauty Spot Gap (Deep Gap)
",Uncle Johnny's hostel,"Jul 19, Sun",12.20
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629422,"Up and out this morning to catch our shuttle ride. We got driven this time in an old Corolla up the rutted forest service road to Beauty Spot Gap. Sheesh.... can't believe she made it. We started uphill on Unaka mountain. It was a thousand feet in a mile and a half. When we got to the top, we entered a beautiful balsam and pine forest. The scent was fresh, it was quiet and the bugs seem to keep away, which is wonderful. I think of these beautiful, aromatic forests at the top of hard climbs as a little gift....like the sunshine was a gift back in March. The rest of the day was the usual ups and downs, but we had decided to go a little longer to the shelter instead of the campsite 3 miles before it, so that we can shorten the day tomorrow. That makes today our longest day yet.....over 14 miles!
We were about 2 miles from the shelter and we had been hearing the usual late afternoon thunder rumblings. They sounded a little closer but we thought we'd make it..... wrong. Wow! We had just enough time to get our pack covers on before the deluge came. It started pouring buckets and we were soaked to the skin in minutes! The temperature dropped and I wish I had taken the time to put my raincoat on. It rained like this for about 15 minutes or so but that was enough. The trail became a fast flowing stream. This time around, at the advice of the ""trail gurus,"" neither of us is using waterproof shoes. That means we were sloshing thru the puddles willy-nilly, squishing in our socks. By the time we reached the shelter, the rain had stopped, the sun was out, and the streams of water had mostly reabsorbed back into the trail. Surprisingly, the shelter is pretty full...six plus the two of us. There is a couple from East Stroudsburg, PA doing a southbound, a father and two sons who we had met at Uncle Johnny's, and another guy northbound much faster than we are. Another guy (Floss), who also stayed at Uncle Johnny's last night, stopped at the shelter to cook dinner and then headed off to do another six miles. He's attempting an FKT (fastest known time), trying to beat Warren Doyles' unsupported thru-hike time, and is consistently doing 30 miles a day. He is actually the second FKT attempt we have met this time out. We met a woman (Mercury) who is going for the fastest supported thru-hike. Hike your own hike!
We put up our tent, and hung our soaking wet clothes on a line.... optimistic that they will dry by morning.","Uncle Johnny's hostel
",Clyde Smith shelter,"Jul 20, Mon",14.40
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629423,"We had no more rain last night after that gulley washer, thank goodness. We had left our soaking wet clothes hanging from either a clothesline or a tree, hoping they would get  a little dryer. Our shirts and pants got dry, but not our socks, shoes or insoles. Such is the life of a thru-hiker.... perpetually wet feet. Since we don't have an option, we put them all back on. If we had put on our dry socks right away, they would have gotten soaked, too, then we wouldn't have had dry socks if we needed them.
As we started walking, Bob went to get a drink from the bite valve on this water bladder and discovered that a little critter had also tried to nibble on the valve over night! Ewwww.... He'll be storing the end of the bite valve tube inside his pack from now on.
Today, we tackled Roan Mountain at 6200+. We believe it is the last 6k footer until we reach the White Mountains in New Hampshire, which, for us, will be next year. It was a long climb but we were rewarded with another fir and pine forest for the last two miles. The scent is wonderful and reminds me of walking thru a gift shop in the Adirondacks.... but the real thing is so much nicer. ?
We had been hearing thunder since about 11 this morning so our pack covers were on. The rain started at about 2 but it was a gentle, welcome rain. We could hear it starting on the tree canopy first before we ever felt the first drops. At the top are the few remaining ruins of an old 19th century hotel (the Cloudland Hotel) and a parking lot for day hikers. Seeing them get out of their cars and walk to the summit feels a bit like another world.
We hiked the last half mile up what must have been an old road. The shelter is another .1 off the trail. It has four walls and a door, as well as a second floor. Usually, the shelters are more of a three sided lean-to design. It is the highest shelter on the AT, and at 6,270 feet, I think it has been built like this to serve as an emergency shelter during storms or bad weather.
A father and son showed up about 15 minutes after we did. They came from that parking lot and are only doing an overnight. With a little luck we'll have a rain free, cool evening for good sleeping.","Clyde Smith shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629424,"Last night was a chilly night. We are only carrying our summer sleeping bags, which are heavyweight fleece, and not the down bags we had back in March. We both layered up with extra clothes and socks, plus we opened our rain jackets and lay them over our core to help keep in body warmth. I didn't hear a rustle or a scratch outside the tent all night. It was so quiet.
Up and out this morning and down to another parking lot. We passed several day hikers on the way down and found quite a few more at the parking lot. Today was the day for them. I think we must have seen two or three dozen! Everyone must be crazy to get out of the house on this random Wednesday. Today was also the day for climbing over balds. The first was Jane's bald and the views were amazing! We could look back at Roan Mountain, and all the other ups and downs we'd been over in the past two weeks. If we look hard enough to the palest mountains in the background, we might even be able to see some of the Smokies! It's amazing to see so many hills and mountains, covered as far as the eye can see with trees. To me, the view gives such a sense of serenity.
We climbed over two or three more large balds, filled with wildflowers and tons of wild raspberry bushes. These bushes have been all along the trail. They are loaded with prickers and snag at both of our arms and legs along the areas of the trail that are more overgrown. There was thunder again, too. It seems to be a regular afternoon pattern. We got a little rain but, again, the welcome kind.
We sat on the rocks on the last bald (Little Hump) for a good half an hour before descending the final half mile to our camp site. Tommorow we start the day by climbing over Hump Mt and then decend down to a road and access to a hostel for a clean up. Yay!","Roan High Knob shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629537,"Our tent site last night turned out to be a little more slanted than we thought. I had to keep readjusting my sleeping pad because I kept sliding into Bob...not a restful night. The rain held off and what we could see of the sunrise thru the trees was nice.
We started out of the woods and down the remainder of Little Hump bald and looked up at the expanse of Hump mountain before us. We could see the trail as it climbed up the bald to the top, which was shrouded in a cloud. The mountains all around us as we climbed had varying degrees of cloud cover and sunny spots. The swallows were awake and swooping around for flying insects. The vegatation was so overgrown that we could barely see the trail, yet under the long grasses was the rutted path with decades of use. Mists were floating across our path and the wildflowers were waist deep. It took us about an hour to get up and over the Hump...we paused a lot to enjoy the views and the experience.
The rest of the day was a downhill. They say that Pennsylvania has all the rocks on this trail, but we've seen an awful of the little buggers. We also said goodbye to the North Carolina section of the trail for good. No more following the NC/TN boarder. It's all TN until we got Virginia.
We got to the fairly busy highway and had to walk .4 miles up to the Station at 19E hostel. There's a small brew pub down stairs and a dorm style setup upstairs. They're only open for hikers right now, so lucky us! We got beers, cleaned up and shuttles down the road for dinner with some hikers we had met at Uncle Johnny's. Two men and a woman, about our age, are out doing a section hike (Joe, David and Linda ""Woodstock""). One of their wives is meeting up with them periodically.   We visited and swapped hiking stories over another beer here at 19E. Woodstock (a Methodist pastor) is leaving tomorrow due to issues with her knee. The two guys are hiking on, but I think their pace is faster than ours. Such is the case with everyone we meet, but we want to keep a pace we can sustain.

About a half hour later the sky's opened up and the rain started. So much for a dry hiking day.  Dave, the hostel owner, had set us up with the fixings for breakfast and Woodstock graciously offered to get up and cook it for us. We had a great breakfast of eggs, bacon and hash browns. There was so much food she fed half the hostel. 
Dave dropped us off at the trail head and we hiked up out of the gap in the pouring rain. The rain only lasted about two hours but long enough to get us pretty wet. So much for having nice clean dry clothes. A little less than 5 miles into the day, we passed the 400 mile mark since starting in Georgia... woohoo! Love these little milestones. Less than a mile later we took a side trail to Jones Falls where we had lunch. The falls we at least 75 feet tall and really gushing with all the rain we've had lately. We ran into two women that had also stayed at the hostel last night. They were just out for a few days of hiking.From there it was less than four miles to the shelter. We passed another waterfall, Mountaineer Falls, before getting to the shelter. We camped above the shelter and the water source was actually the top of the falls we'd just passed. No problem filling the water bags tonight. 
Our evening's entertainment came in the form of hanging the food bags. There usually weren't many good branches to hang the bag. The trees are all very straight and tall, with no low branches. The best one at the camp site was about 30-35 ft up.  I made a similar toss a few nights before so I was game for another try. I wound up and let the little rock bag fly (which is attached to a 60 ft thin line) and landed it like a bag of cement exactly IN the ""Y"" notch at the branch. ""A million to one shot, Doc."" The bag should have gone thru the notch and looped the line over the branch. The bag was now completely stuck. Nothing we did would dislodge it. We ended up hanging the food between two trees,  using our spare line and rock bag. The next day I cut the line that was reachable and left the remains for future campers. Tennessee really needs to install bear cables or bear boxes at their shelters.","The Station at 19E

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629540,"We were greeted this morning with a hi-ho from another hiker. He blasted past our campsite as we were eating breakfast and breaking up camp. He had gotten up early and was obviously moving much faster than we do.
Today's terrain was pretty mellow, as it goes. Most of the day we walked thru dark, rhodedendron tunnels. They were so dark that it was a challenge to see our footing. No mishaps, tho. I had to wrap my ankle this morning because I had somehow tweaked it yesterday (can't imagine how on all these roots and rocks...). We still kept a decent pace, but stopped a few more times to enjoy views. One place with an overlook actually had a bench. There were several pretty waterfalls. We ran into a family out for a weekend trip. They were all sitting at one of the prettier falls, Hardcore Cascade (named after a local trail maintenance crew).
One sad moment of the day was when we came across (Bob almost stepped on) a dead fawn on the trail. It couldn't have been dead for more than 24 hours and it looked like it had just curled up and put its head down to rest. It looked very young. Its torso was no longer than one of our shoes. No, we didn't take any pictures.
As we finished for the day, we could hear thunder in the distance to one side of us, and target practice with a semi-automatic on the other. It's a different world. At the shelter and got the tent setup, just in time for the afternoon 20 minute downpour. The sun was shining the whole time. Luckily, our tent site is close to the shelter so we could just hang out until it stopped. No need to worry about the ""unreliable water source"" at this, or any other shelter. All the streams and springs are flowing.
After doing well with the food bag hangs, it is now becoming a nightly frustrating chore. Virginia can't come soon enough!Oh, and by the way..... we're in the tent, at 7:30 as usual, listening to thunder and rain.","Mountaineer shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629541,"We had some rain last night! It poured buckets from about 7:30 until it turned to soft rain at about 9:30. Thunder kept exploding directly over our heads! We huddled in the tent, (listening to a podcast of Teri Gross interviewing Matthew Rhys) checking for any leaks but aside from the splash ups around the edges, we were dry.... thank goodness! We heard a crashing outsi, and thought it was our food bags. In a panic, we checked but all was safe. It was probably a branch falling. That happens a lot. Next time it rains like that, we will consider staying in the shelter.
The rest of the day was full of little ups and downs, and several more beautiful waterfalls. We stopped at one for lunch and just sat for a while enjoying it.
The highlight of the day was the Laurel Falls, and the hike down the canyon to reach them. We got glimpses thru the trees of the mountains one the way and crossed over several footbridges as the river leading to the falls slowly increased in volume. The final descent to the bottom of the falls was a very long rock ""stairway"" (and I use that term loosely). That was made even more fun 1. because we have 30+ lb packs down very steep rock steps, placed by a trail crew; 2. we were being passed both coming uphill and going downhill by day hikers. There wasn't much passing room let alone social distancing space. The bottom was completely worth it! The falls were rushing over the rocks and there was a pool at the bottom where people were swimming. We dumped our packs, took off shoes and socks, and carefully walked across the rocks to soak our tired feet in the water. Wonderful! We must have sat there for an hour just enjoying ourselves. 
The trail .6 miles to the shelter took us around some pretty sketchy trail around rock right on the edge of the river. We now know why there is a high water alternative route. We passed some nice campsites right along the river, which looked good, but we were heading to the shelter. We wished we had chosen one of those. We hiked up a steep hill to a kinda crappy shelter with even worse tenting area. The only grassy area was sloped, and the day hikers with dogs (parking lot 1.3 miles away) had been using that area as the doggie poop zone. Three guys had spent a couple of nights there so we chatted with them for a while. They seemed in no great hurry to leave. They finally mozzied out at about 6:30, which was getting close to our bed time ? Since we were by ourselves yet again, we decided there was only one creative solution....place the tent inside the shelter itself. Our tent actually fit, so we were able to make dinner, hang our food and get into the tent just as the sun was setting.","Moreland Gap shelter
",Laurel Fork shelter,"Jul 26, Sun",8.20
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629638,"What a night! We had a visitor in the shelter. We did not actually see it, but based on an accessment of its size as it scurried around the edge of the tent, we suspect it was (they were?) either a possum or rat! It didn't get into anything, but YOU try to sleep when something is scurrying around you, chewing on the wooden shelter base. ? Needless to say, this shelter is the ranking for  winner of the worst shelter so far.
The rest of the day was much less eventful. We climbed back down and walked along the Laurel river again. We crossed over two impressive, hand built wooden bridges. Because we are in Pond Mountain Wilderness Area, power tools could not be used to build these bridges. They are quite impressive and very sturdy.
After about a mile and a half of being lulled into complacency, the incline begins. This lovely PUD (pointless up and down) goes up 1,800 feet in 2.5 miles and then down 1,800 feet in 3. After looking at the map, we both confessed to each other that we had thought about taking the side trail to the road and walking down to the hostel...not going over said PUD. We sweated it out and climbed it. There were not even any views as a reward! Stinkers. We did count six tiny toads that survived our giant footfalls.
We reached the road and the infamous ""Boots Off"" hostel was just a bit further. It is billed as the best hostel on the AT, and, I have to say, it's pretty good. We couldn't get a private room, but their bunk room is fairly small... only sleeps eight. The bunks are all built into the wall like an old ship's bunk, and each has a privacy curtain. It's like a little kid's fantasy, with your own light and charging plug. We met another woman named Catherine from Louisiana. She is out for two weeks doing a SOBO section hike by herself. She said her son is finally old enough for her to not feel guilty leaving him to do something like this. She told us about another hostel between here and Damascus that we may have to try so we don't have to carry so much food.
After we cleaned up and did laundry, we got the shuttle into the local grocery store to resupply, then Subway for dinner. That was the healthiest meal we'd had in a while...real veggies! At a lot of these AT hostels, the facilities are outside or nearly outside. For instance, the shower stands outside as a separate outbuilding. It has walls that don't extend all the way down to the ground, brightly painted graphics and a bucket turned upside down as the showerhead so you feel hesitant, but it was as nice a shower as we've had in a nice hotel.... just outside.

The coffee was already made and the donuts, cereal and fruit were laid out in the kitchen....very nice setup for a hostel. Our bunkhouse mates also got up and we visited a little while they drank their coffee and relaxed on the patio. They were all zeroing and maybe planning some day hikes. We still made it on our way by 8:00.
We walked down the road toward Lake Watauga. It's a large dammed river and looks like a good sized local recreational area. The trail followed the lake shore for about a mile, then turned into the woods. We were able to see the lake between the trees almost all day.
About an hour into the day, it started to rain. It was a welcome rain because the humidity was dense and heavy, and there was no movement in the air. We had been dripping with sweat...then, we were just dripping with rain. The trail was uphill most of the day, along a ridge. The thunder was softly rumbling....until a really loud crack nearly made us both hit the deck. It sounded like it hit within feet behind us! We both questioned the sanity of walking along a ridge with our metal trekking poles.
We had heard from several other hikers that the water source at tonight's shelter was horrible. It is supposed to be .3 miles down a very steep hill that would require either trekking poles or hands and feet to climb back up. We decided to ""camel up"" at the water 2 miles before the shelter and lug it up the hill. We needed water for dinner, a drink, washing up, and enough to start the day tomorrow in our pack bladders, because the next water is another 4 miles down the trail. This means we each carried and additional 6.6 pounds of water. I know, we're gluttons for punishment. I felt every ounce of that extra weight.
The shelter sits right on the ridge. The large rock behind it is the only thing separating us from a shear drop. Over the rock, we can see a beautiful view of the lake and the mountains behind it. There is a marina on the other side of the lake, just below us. We can see both sailboats and motor boats lined up in slips. It looks like it's quite nice, which is such a contrast to what we saw of the small town yesterday as we shuttled to the store to resupply.

At least the rain held off until we had packed up the tent, were eating breakfast and packing up for the day under the shelter roof. Again, it was a light, refreshing rain. I know I sound like a broken record, but weather is big part of our outdoor lives.
We walked along a ridge for most of the day. We hadn't done that since the Smokies. The fog was so thick that you couldn't see further than about 50 feet down either side of the ridge. We knew at least one side was steep and with a very high drop off. The trail is in need of some trimming maintenance. It was so thick and overgrown that we could barely find the trail. The wild blackberry bushes we out to attack us. Poor Bob suffered the most, partially because he doesn't wear long pants. He sets a better pace than I do so he usually leads. That means he takes the brunt of the grasping prickers, wacking at them with his poles. It also means he is the web-breaker in the morning, if no one is ahead of us. Thank you, honey ? Today, because of the light rain and the heavy dew and humidity, the brambles were very wet. They were so thick that we became soaking wet walking thru them.
Later in the day, the sun actually came out and we could tell that someone had been clearing the trail. We ran into two of these wonderful guys. They had all their gear strapped to their backs and were heading to the area we had just been. Because this is a Wilderness Area the trail crews can only use hand tools. These guys said they liked hiking in and using machetes because it's a good workout. 
Tonight we are at another hostel, the Rabbit Hole. We heard about it from Catherine at Boots Off. We wouldn't normally stay at another hostel so soon, but this actually works out better mileage wise.... splits into two 11.5 mile days instead of a 14 and a 9. Every hostel is unique. At this one, we got our own little guest house...so cute! One of their specialties is milkshakes. Boy are they good! They are the old fashioned kind that remind me of the ones you used to get at Howard Johnson's!

They brought it to our little cabin, so we could eat it sitting outside on the porch. We felt so decadent! The service we received from Rabbit and Kat, the owners, was above and beyond. We even had a TV with Netflix hooked up in the cabin so we watched a few episodes of""Grace and Frankie.""
We got on trail about an hour later than usual, but it was worth it.? This morning started thru a pasture where we were told there were friendly cows. We stepped around plenty of evidence of them, but they were over in another field. The day was a lot of gentle ups and downs again. The forecast said 90% chance of rain, but it held off until 2:00, so we were lucky.
We ran into three women doing a SOBO section hike. We told them about Rabbit Hole. They'd heard about the milkshakes and asked how they 'really' were. We assured them everything they'd heard was true.The rain hit us a little after 2:00. It starts first high up in the trees. We can hear it before we feel it. Today's shower lasted about 45 minutes of actual rain. Then it lasts another half hour of the wind blowing the water off the leaves from 40 feet up. We know the routine. The sun comes out for a while when we get to camp so we always put the tent up first.
About a mile from the shelter, we ran into an older guy. At first, we thought we'd seen the ghost of John Muir or Rip Van Winkle. He was tall and thin with white hair past his shoulders and a long white beard. He was wearing a black poncho over his pack and carried one long wooden walking staff. The staff he used to gesture and emphasize his points. We stood talking to him for about half an hour. He was very chatty. Eventually he continued SOBO and we got to the shelter.
Tomorrow we are into Damascus! We're excited to have a zero and relax a bit. We've heard from the place where we are staying that ATT has no reception in town. I'm sure the inn has WiFi so we should be ok.
Well, the rain started again in earnest at about 5:00, stopped briefly at 7:00 for about 20 minutes, then started again. I'm reeeeaaaaly getting sick of rain!","Rabbit Hole hostel

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629677,"Last night was a case of ignorance is bliss. We spoke to Steve, who arrived in the rain last night. He told us that about three minutes after we got into our tent last night, he looked out from the shelter and saw two eyes staring back at him. A bear had casually walked down the trail and was sniffing the air for food! This shelter, like many, was right on the trail, and the area where we were tenting was on the opposite side of the trail from the shelter. Steve watched the bear walk around, walk under where we had hung our food bags, and circle back around our tent!  He tried banging his trekking poles together and yelling at it to go away, but he said the bear just looked at him with disinterest. During all this, we were sitting in our tent. I was writing last night's entry and we were listening to a podcast. Between the rain noise on the tent and the podcast, we couldn't hear what was going on. I thought I heard someone else arrive, but never peeked out to check. Steve said the bear was moving very quietly. I'm going to have to rethink all the sounds I hear while lying awake at night!
All night it was either actually raining or the wind was blowing the water off the tree canopy on to the tent. We ate breakfast under the shelter waiting for a lull in the rain to take down the tent. Up until now, we have been very lucky not to have rain while we pitch or strike our tent, so we really can't complain. 
We began the hike in the rain. It rained on us for about two hours, then we started to see shadows. It was a long downhill out of TN and into Damascus, VA. We were excited because it would be our first zero since Erwin, and this time we were not staying in a hostel.
The Dancing Bear Inn is very nice. We are staying in one of the larger units in the back, behind the main building. There is enough room for us to explode our packs and dry everything out. It's amazing how everything that fits so compactly into our packs can take up an entire room! While the owner, Elizabeth, did our laundry, we cleaned up and walked to the local diner in borrowed scrubs, t-shirts, and our Crocks.
Bob had a prescription to pick up in the next town and when we asked Elizabeth about a shuttle to get there, she offered her son. He has a learner's permit and would we be willing to be the adults in the car. Score...we just saved a round trip shuttle fee and gave a teenage boy an excuse to drive more. We all survived the drive, and we bought him a burger from a place he wanted to try. Win-win. We spent the rest of the evening relaxing in our suite, watching TV and planning the next leg of our journey. And guess what.... it was raining again.","Abingdon Gap shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629820,"Today was a delightfully lazy day. We went back to the same Damascus Diner for breakfast. We walked down the road a mile or so to the Food City grocery store to stock up for our next leg. We have to walk into these resupply places with a specific list of meals and days until the next resupply, or we will end up buying too much (""oooo, this is a cool new flavor!). We just don't have that kind of extra room!
We brought everything back and then proceeded to pull out all our pots and bottles and other stuff to make sure it all gets cleaned. It's amazing how much dirt, grime and leaf litter gets into every crevice!Next step on this hot afternoon was to find the ice cream shop. Damascus is one of the best known ""trail towns"" on the AT. We also discovered that it might be better known locally as a town on the Virginia Creeper bike trail. There are several bike rental shops in town. On a Saturday afternoon, there were a lot of bikes and cyclists. We spoke to one of the local outfitters and he said the town really survives on the Creeper trail. The AT just provides a big surge of people in the spring for northbounders and in the fall for soithbounders. Also, every May, they have a weekend festival called ""Trail Days."" It brings a lot of business, but it didn't happen this year.
We ran into Steve on the street. We made arrangements to meet him later for dinner along with another hiker from his hostel, who had just completed her thru-hiker. The wings place (Wicked Chicken) turned out to be the same place as the ice cream shop we had gone to earlier. We ate, drank beer, talked about the trail (of course), food, beer, and diving. Turns out we were all divers.
Back at our room, we logged into Amazon and watched a few very early episodes of ""30 Rock."" Neither of us wanted to go to sleep because we knew waking up meant leaving this clean, civilized world and heading back to the woods.","

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629822,"Queen beds feel so much larger when you are on the trail, living in a tent. Just for a little perspective, the dimensions of a standard queen sized bed is 60 x 80""; our tent measures 56 x 92"" That doesn't leave much room for stuff.
We started out for a bit on the Creeper trail this morning, then back into the woods on the AT. The Creeper is a rails-to-trails trail so the grade is no more than a train could handle. We ran into one guy today who asked us if we'd seen abandoned bikes on the trail. We had seen three, and wondered where the people were. Apparently, three people who had rented bikes had decided they didn't want to bike any more and just left the bikes lying on the trail! Ah-mazing! The poor guy we ran into had to find and retrieve these bikes that were scattered over a half mile, three miles back! We don't get it....
Our packs were heavy again, with five days worth of food. The switch backs made the climb tolerable. The campsite is a quarter mile off the trail, but it's a great site. The shelter is nice and well built, and the tent area behind it is in a little pine Grove. The best part, tho, is that we are now in VA.... that means bear boxes and privies!! Doing a little dance of joy. There is a sign in the shelter starting that for the next 50 miles, all shelters will have steel bear boxes because Yogi and Booboo have figured out how to retrieve bear bags hung from trees. Apparently, the bears in VA truly are smarter than the average bear..... you can blame Bob for that one. ?","Dancing Bear Inn

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629824,"We slept in a little this morning because we knew it was a short hiking day. We had enough of a signal to check the weather. That had us moving faster to strike the tent and eat breakfast at the shelter. We saw that we were going to have a wet day. Fifteen minutes after we left and we were walking along a ridge, the skies opened up again. We were soaked to the skin in minutes. We had put our pack covers on but not our rain jackets. When it rains this much they really don't do much good anyway. In this kind of rain, even our packs get wet under the pack covers, so everything in our packs is in separate drybags. The importance of having something dry to put on once you reach shelter is paramount.
It rained all day. We only hiked for four hours until we reached the next shelter, then it continued to rain for several more hours. The shelters so far in VA have been very solidly built and waterproof. We sat there and ate our lunch, watching the rain and wondering what we would do for the rest of the afternoon. We strung a line inside the shelter to dry and dry our wet clothes. About an hour after we arrived, two other guys walked in as soaked as we were. The shelter is large enough for all of us to string lines and spread our gear out.
We visited with Brian from PA and Dan from FL, nice guys. They are friends who have been section hiking the AT for the last several years. A bit after they arrived, two other couples came up... drenched, too. We thought at this point the shelter might get kinda full, but they were just stopping to check their feet and get a snack. Sloshing thru this much rain really does a number on feet. You have to take care of them or you'll get trench foot.
One more guy did come, just before dinner, Robbie from TN. It had finally stopped raining and we were deciding it was safe enough to pitch our tents instead of crowding into the shelter. It was dinner time so we all compared what we were having for dinner, what our favorite backpacking meals were, which stoves we like best. We found that going out for only a week or so, your meals are probably more interesting than if you have to resupply at the Dollar General or Food City every few days.
Just as we all decided it was getting close to hiker bedtime, we heard a pack of coyotes start howling in the distance. It's kind of a cool sound and we know they are not a threat.","Saunders Shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629826,"No rain over night... woohoo! It was a chilly night, tho. I know that tonight will be cooler tonight because we will be at almost 5,500 feet. 
Brian and Dan from last night are faster than we are, but they were going to the same shelter. We did run into them several times along the trail today.
After we left the shelter, we went down and thru a cow pasture. The black cows ignored our attempts at conversation. We them started a very long and rocky uphill to Buzzards rock. The view from there started out obscured by mist and clouds. We decided to eat lunch there since we were taking a rest anyway and it was close enough to lunch time. Brian and Dan were there, too, checking in with their wives, having finally gotten a signal.
Best way to describe the rest of today was rocks. The grade was not too steep, but it was very rocky. We are convinced that the trail planners purposely went looking for rock falls so they could deliberately route the trail there...then laughed maniacally.
The shelter tonight is one of the larger, two story type. We decided to find a camp site just down the trail. There were forest side sites and meadow side sites. We got a forest side, right across from the meadow side site that contains the bear box. The low pine forest begins just feet from our tent and gets very dark, very quickly. It's like a ""deep, dark forest"" scene out of Grimm's fairy tale.
The meadow across from us extends down the mountain side and is filled with dense blackberry and blueberry brambles. The mountain view show all the layers of grey mountains fading into the distance. We watched the sun set behind one of the mountains we just crossed and it lit up the sky in pinks and purples. Because we're in the woods most of the time, getting to see a sunset is a real treat!","Lost Mountain shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629827,"Last night was cold. Both of us wore most if not all of our clothes. We put our rain jackets over our sleeping bags to retain warmth, and I used the large drybag we use for the tent fly to put around the feet end of my sleeping bag, too. You have to get creative to keep warm. This was the highest shelter on this section of the hike. There's nothing this high again until New Hampshire. It should be warmer at lower altitudes so we should be ok until we get our down bags back.
The beautiful view across the meadow this morning was the reward for our cold night. It was silent and peaceful. There were clouds below in the valleys, but where we were, it was clear as a bell.
Today's terrain was completely different. We were open to the sky all morning. We could actually have used some sunscreen. We climbed a few rocky outcrops and the views just went on forever. We dodged plenty of pony poo but no ponies until we stopped for lunch, back in the woods. We passed and repassed the people who camped across from us last night, a woman and her two grandsons (out for their first backpacking trip) and her two friends. These women were all on either in their 60's or 70's; two had hiked the AT at least once... recently; some had hiked the Camino, John Muir trail, West Highland Way, etc. These were pretty cool women and we could have visited with them for quite a while. They were leaving and we needed to move on.
Later in the day, we passed an old confinement area that used to be used to corral the cows which we have occasionally seen so they could be weighed for sale. Their weight was higher taken up in the pastures than if they herded them down to the main road, so they got a better price. 
Fifteen minutes after we left ""the scales,"" it started to rain again. An hour and a half later, we arrived at the shelter, soaked and shivering. The rain ended about ten minutes later.
Brian and Dan showed up about an hour later. We all strung out lines to try and dry out as much of our soaking wet clothes as possible. We know this is a futile activity, but it helps a little. Because it had stopped raining, we could dare to put on some of our dry clothes to stay warm.
A group of boys from a Midwestern church group were camped near us. They drive down every year to camp in this area. They walked over to visit with us for a bit. Some of the younger ones were curious about what we were doing and asked lots of questions.","Thomas Knob shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629830,"Last night was not as cold as the previous night, thank goodness. It also didn't rain the rest of the night, which is also good. We put on our still damp clothes, did some foot repair with leuko tape, ate and were off again.
We hiked for about two hours and tried for a signal at the top of a climb. Finally! We have been struggling for a signal since before Damascus. AT&T is not the service to have while on the AT. I was able to send some texts and Bob was able to check in with his mom.
Most of the day was a gradual downhill. At one point we were on a relatively even, old logging road. Then the trail turned the corner and decided to take us across a tallis field... just for fun. We stopped at a stream for lunch and the sun was actually streaming thru the trees on us. It was lovely.In the afternoon, we came to a closed section. We decided not to take the detour and see if the bridge was passable. The bridge was about a mile and a half in and crossed fairly low over a cascade of waterfalls. There was a huge blow down very close to it, but we think that was unrelated. The bridge looked intact, but a sign was posted that one of the timbers was cracked. Several recent mentions on Guthook said it was passable, of you did it carefully. We looked at the stream, which was only a few feet below the bridge, and there were large boulders which could also be crossed. We very carefully crossed, one at a time, and made it. The ATC already calls us renegade thru-hikers for being out here at all. We might as well earn the title!
Around three o'clock, like clockwork, we started to hear thunder start to rumble. It was sunny where we were, but the weather changes quickly around here. We had about two miles to go to the shelter and we picked up the pace. Every hollow we turned into, we'd hear the thunder coming from a different direction. We made it to the shelter with no rain! As we sit here in our tent at the end of a long hiking day, the skies are silent and clear. All we can hear are birds, random debris falling from trees, and the faint sound of the water source, which is close to this shelter.","Old Orchard shelter

We slept well with our food bags in the last bear box we will see for a while. Apparently, we will be back to hanging them again for a while.
The terrain was relative mellow today, which was nice after yesterday's higher miles. Getting trail legs is one thing, but getting trail feet is something separate.
Bob spotted the moment of the day. We were hiking in a clear area under power lines when he looked off to the side. The black spot in the distance was moving. Bear! It was slowly walking toward us at about 100 yards. We watched, then whistled and waved our trekking poles, thinking it might be frightened off. It pricked up its ears and looked at us. Then just kept walking. We carried on hiking, excited that we had seen our first bear!...but checked behind every once in a while just to make sure it hadn't decided to follow us. It's one thing to rationalize that bears don't want us, just our food, but then you remember that they still have the ability to hurt or kill you if they choose.
We hiked thru the evidence that all that thunder we heard last night rained somewhere. We could see the channeling on the trail where the water had flowed so heavily that it either pushed all the leaves off the trail or caught them in bunches on rocks or sticks.
We made some calculations and are going to be decadent for a couple of days. Tonight, we got a shuttle from the Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area visitors center into the town of Marion, VA. It's a larger town than we thought it was. We got a hiker rate at the Travelers Inn, and did our laundry. We walked to the Ingles to resupply and stopped at a Mexican restaurant (Mi Puerto) that was recommended in the AWOL guide and Guthooks. The food was delicious and we ate everything! Guess our hiker hunger has finally hit. It was so nice to have fresh food again that required no rehydration and wasn't a sweet protein bar. The giant Dos Equis didn't hurt.

When let us off at the trail, he even gave us each a protein bar, and some salve his wife makes for bug bites or skin irritations, etc. So nice!
We headed out and after about an hour we ran into some guys. We asked them what they were doing because they had several pieces of radio equipment. They said they were bear hunting! More specifically, they were training their dogs for the bear hunting season. Did not expect that. Later in the afternoon, after lunch, we rounded a curve and we greeted by a bark. Two of their dogs had come down the trail toward us. They each had three different collars; two with long wire antenna. They became our new best friends and followed us for the next hour or more. When we finally got to the Lindamood school to take our packs off for a rest, the guys drove past and asked if we'd seen a dog (one had stopped following us a mile or so back)...out comes their dog from under the schoolhouse. They couldn't figure out why she had come this far... until we explained.
We also ran into a SOBO, Chris from TX, who was doing the trail without any maps, or guidebooks, or apps.... truly old school. We chatted with him for a bit while we were stopped for lunch, explaining where the water was and giving him the name of good hostels.
Our destination tonight was another small motel. This one is right off interstate 81, which we heard for the last hour and a half of our hike. The only way this place is even remotely acceptable is because we have been living in a tent and sleeping on the ground in the woods.

We started out hiking thru pastures which were very damp with dew.... which means our shoes and socks got soaked. The good news is the nice, sunny day dried them...oh, but they still stink!
Today, we passed a landmark in our hike. We have hiked a quarter of the way from Springer mountain in Georgia to Katahdin in Maine! We've hiked over 550 miles (between the March leg and now) but when you think of it as only 25% of the trail, it doesn't sound like much.
We stopped for lunch at a water source and chatted with ""Bear"" and his dog, Ace. He was southbound and was hoping to continue on after the end of the AT in Georgia and hook up with another trail, either in FL or AL. He wants to stay out hiking until at least the end of the year... trying to avoid all the craziness. We've run into several people who spend months every year on trail, or actually live on trail. Bear told us that the guy we met and spoke to yesterday, Chris, has been on trail for years! You meet some different folks out here.
We ended our day crossing another pasture, full of surprised and moderately worried looking young bulls. I didn't think of Virginia as a beef producing state... that's just a guess. The pasture became really overgrown and it was really hard to follow. We finally got out of the maze and walked a hundred yards down the road to our hostel. The owners, Bob (a retired teacher) and Bert (a retired ER nurse) are very nice. He let us into the bunkhouse and she came down later to make sure we have everything we need. We have the whole place to ourselves.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/629913,"We had a good night's sleep and a nice visit with Bert this morning. She had just finished a month long southbound hike in the Shenandoahs and she was filling us in on what to expect further north. Hostel owners are part of an informal network and they talk to each other. She gave us some good recommendations and look forward to some of these unique places.
We met an interesting hiker...not sure if he spells his name ""Fungi"" or ""Fun guy""....he's into the wide variety of mushrooms and fungi on the trail. He's an older guy, a little older than we are, and he likes to spend at least six months a year on the trail. He was excited to see us and learn that we are out here and going as far as we are.
Just after we passed Fungi, we forded our first creek. It really wasn't much of a ford, but we did have to stop, take off our hiking shoes and put on our Crocs to cross the creek. It looks like the bridge was blown out by large trees which were washed down the creek after a big rain. The water under where the bridge was looked to be maybe hip deep but we were able to cross in calf deep water.
The last part of the day was a four mile uphill....two thousand feet. That translates to several hours of a hot and sweaty slog. The first two miles were very steep. Bob ran out of water about three quarters of the way up. The shelter tonight has no water source so we had to stop at the water two miles before the shelter. We were so thirsty that we each drank a liter of water while we filtered. Also, there isn't a water source for several miles into tomorrow's hike so we had to ""camel up"" and fill all our water bladders and then hike up the remainder of the hill with the added weight.... about ten pounds each. As we climbed, the tree cover turned into a tall meadow, filled with wildflowers and brambles. They're beautiful, but it means we were also exposed to the hot sun.
The reward at the top was a beautiful view to the valley below. This time, the view was of farms instead of a sea of trees.
The shelter tonight is a fully enclosed stone building. Apparently it used to be the fire warden's cabin. The old fireplace is closed up and there is a proper door and windows. The possible tenting area around it is very difficult because the grasses and brambles are close to waist high. We are alone again so we pitched our tent on one of the platforms inside the shelter. I know this sounds ridiculous, but it keeps out the ever present mice, spiders and potential snakes, and makes for a better night's sleep. We also locked ourselves inside the shelter the best we could because the trees were not tall enough to hang our food outside, so we had to hang it from a string inside the shelter. 
The trail, for a lot of today, followed a ridge line. At one point on our way up to the shelter, we could look back across an open cow pasture and clearly see the ridges that make up the mountains in this area. It was cool to see them laid out like that.
We couldn't see the actual sunset but we watched the colors change on the clouds in the opposite direction and that was good enough.","Bear Garden hostel

We were all ready to go when Bob discovered that his hydration bladder had completely emptied...into his pack! This was not a good moment. Bob was frustrated and extremely aggravated. The closure was mis-threaded and when he had laid the pack down, two liters of water emptied into the pack. This is why we have everything in our packs encased in drybags. His pack was soaked but everything inside the drybags was safe. I was happy that at least the water source was close by, for a change.
The rest of the day was pretty uneventful. It drizzled a little, and it was wickedly humid. The terrain was mellow enough so we could keep up our pace. We didn't see anyone at all until we stopped hiking for the day. That's the hard part about being on the trail this year. There are so few people on the trail.

He's a southbound section hiker, and has been working on his hike for the past seven years. He thinks he might try and make it all the way south to Springer Mountain in Georgia and finish.

By morning, all the trees were heavy with water, which fell on us with the slightest breeze. Glen left going southbound just before us.
It was more humid than usual... which is saying a lot. We keep cotton bandanas hanging from our straps partially to use to absorb the free flowing sweat, made all that much worse by the humidity.
We climbed up Brushy Mountain, which wasn't too high, and followed along another ridge. We came down to our first creek and crossed it on the largest suspension bridge we'd seen on the trail so far. It was sturdy, but that swinging sensation on wooden planks made slippery with humidity was a little nerve wracking. We hiked for another bit and began following another creek. There were signs for some falls (.3 off the trail), but we decided to give them a pass.
The rest of the day was one of the flattest days we've had. We crossed the creek on probably a dozen more slippery, wooden foot bridges. The trail alternated between long, dark rhodedendron tunnels and flat forest. We passed thru a long pine forest... looked like nice, straight southern pine....and it seemed to go on forever on either side of us. We you're out here without seeing many people, these forests can make you occasionally stop and look back over your shoulder.
This was our longest hiking day so far, and even tho it was pretty flat, we were exhausted when we got to the shelter.

It wasn't raining too hard, so we could still function.We packed up and headed off, in the light rain, on a short day to the hostel we had been hearing about...Woods Hole. The first two and a half miles were uphill, with no switchbacks. One good thing about it was that it warmed us up in the rain. As we were hiking, Bob stopped suddenly. I thought he'd hit yet another web. Then he said 'snake.' Under the growth on the side of the trail was a smallish snake coiled up. If it were stretched out, I'd say it would have been maybe 18-20"" long. It was obviously not happy with us and it was staring at Bob, in a coiled, ready to strike pose. It hadn't seen me yet. Bob was already past it and was trying to distract it with his pole so I could get past. It tried to strike at him and them at me as I passed. If the little bugger had been larger it might have gotten one of us! We're not sure what kind of snake it was but we took a picture and when we looked it up later it turned out to be a common garter snakeFiesty little bugger.Because of the rain, we kept going with only the occasional stop to pull a snack from one of our pants pockets...no taking off our packs and resting. We got paid back for the nice terrain we've had for the last 30 miles or so. Today, we got rocks.... slippery in the rain. That slowed us down a bit. We got to the hostel by 12:30 and just after we arrived, the skies opened up. Man, did we pick a perfect day to do a nero at this fantastic hostel!Woods Hole hostel has a bunkhouse for hikers, but they also have bed and breakfast rooms in the main house. The main house was full, but we ended up getting the bunkhouse to ourselves. The property was originally a log cabin that has been restored, enlarged and operating as a hostel since the late 80's. It's rustic and homey and delightful! They have optional communal dinners and breakfasts with all the guests. Because of Covid, instead of all eating at the main table, we all scattered around in rocking chairs and tables on their porch. All of these meals start with a group gathering, introducing ourselves and saying one thing for which we are thankful. A couple had found one of the rooms in the main house online and was there celebrating their wedding anniversary.Neville, the owner, is very sweet and has created a very homey atmosphere. She offers yoga classes every afternoon, but we were too wet and tired. It was so chilly when we got there that Neville lit the pellet stove in the bunkhouse. We stayed nice and toasty ? A couple of guys who were doing a section hike came down from the main house to visit after dinner and warm up.","Wapiti shelter

After we said what we were all thankful for, we had a delicious meal of french toast casserole, eggs, fruit, more homemade bread, homemade yogurt and jams, coffee and OJ. We were full enough to take on the hike into town.
The trail was rocky again, and the grasses and bushes along the sides were wet from yesterday's rain. We were soaked from the thighs down even without rain. Ah, well.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630029,"These little inexpensive motels are great, but there must have been a fire sale on full sized beds. We walked to the Hardies around the corner this morning, because it was our only breakfast option. Then, we were off to the Food Lion to resupply, Walgreens, and the post office to send some extra stuff home. The Food Lion is right across the street and we got everything we need for the next leg. Walgreens was right down the street, too. The only problem we had was the post office. Seems it's closed and we would have to go to the next town. Rats!! Our dreams of lightening our loads a bit will have to wait another week. The woman from the Pearisburg Mercantile said that a tree limb broke thru the roof so they just shut the post office down. With everything that's going on with the post office right now, I doubt they'll get it back. Kind of an inconvenience for both the town and the hikers who come thru this trail town.
We went back to the room and sorted out all of the food and meals for the next leg. Linda,  woman who runs this motel, did our laundry for us, so we'll start out clean again. ""Clean"" never lasts very long, but it's nice while it does.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630205,"Short day today. We got another breakfast at Hardies before we headed out of town. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and the temperature was in the 70's. Wow, sometimes we do get lucky. We had to walk along a divided highway, on a bridge over the New River. Even though we were protected by a shoulder and behind a barrier, when those semi-trucks came blasting around the the corner toward us, I felt a little vulnerable. Guess that comes from spending too much time in the woods.
The upward slope of the trail was nice enough for both of us to comment. Whichever trail club manages this section has really done a great job. The stones had been shifted to make nice steps or used to edge the trail in areas, and the trail wasn't routed over every boulder scree field. We appreciate that. Because of the rain we've had, the water sources were all flowing. We are developing a love-hate relationship with the rain. It can be miserable to hike and camp in, but it fills up our water sources. There is no water at the shelter tonight so we had to stop .6 back and camel up again. One couple passed us on the way up, and we passed another couple. Both were just out for day hikes. The second couple came up to the overlook near the shelter. They said it's one of their favorites. We chatted with them for a bit. They were very familiar with the trails around here.
We got to the shelter pretty early, but we only feel a little guilty about that. Bob rolled out his sleeping pad and took a little nap. The view near the shelter is beautiful...up on a ridge looking down at West Virginia. There are cleared areas with houses and the usual tree covered mountains, as far as we can see. These mountains seem to go on forever, yet this area of the country is not always what you think of when you think of ""going to the mountains."" The sunset looks very promising, but the gnats are driving us into the tent. Maybe we'll go out a little later to catch the full glory. Looks like we're alone again.","Plaza Motel, Pearisburg, VA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630206,"We both fell asleep last night listening to a podcast. We both woke up two hours later to the sound of a torrential downpour on a metal roof. The last weather report from earlier said no rain but then we woke up again at 2:30 to another downpour. Bob falls back asleep better than I do because he wears earplugs, but I just don't like wearing them. By the 4:00 wake up, it was still raining but lighter, and the temperature had dropped. We found out later that it got down into the upper 50's. We just did not expect these kinds of temperatures in August in Virginia. Even the locals agree that it's been cooler than normal.
By the time it was time for us to get up, it was that quiet you get after a big storm....no birds, no cicadas, not a sound. We lay there, wearing all the clothes we could put on, inside our sleeping bags... contemplating whether we wanted to get up.
Two miles in, we ran into the couple who had walked past the shelter last night. They saw us at the shelter (it was 100 yards off the trail) and thought it might be too close to have us all there, for Covid distancing, so they walked further on. They were trying to dry out their tent. They had done the CT (Colorado trail) earlier this summer and wanted to do a section of the AT. They were not used to all the rain... different weather than Colorado.
We also ran into a woman and her daughter. She had done 1,500 miles on the trail this year by herself, but stopped because she was tired of being out here. She said four months was long enough. (.....hmmmmm...) She was just doing a quick trip with her daughter before she goes back to school.It wasn't challenging today, but it started to get a bit rocky, which is hard on the feet. We were surprised because after a morning of fog and mist, the sun started to come out just before noon and the afternoon was beautiful. The sky was blue with puffy, white clouds, and the temperature stayed in the low 70's. Our lunch break spot had a log to sit on, a lovely breeze (kept the gnats and pesky flies away) and a beautiful view of the West Virginia mountains and valleys. It really was a pleasant day, but we were too tired from a poor night's sleep to appreciate it as much as we should have.
Alone again at the shelter tonight. We made and ate dinner, hung our food bags, and crawled into our tent....on the ground this time. Oh, and this is the second shelter prominently marked ""closed due to Covid-19."" Ok, but they have padlocked the privies! Apparently they did this a month ago....not in March or April. No worries.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630208,"This morning, we said goodbye to CT (Colorado Trail) couple. We found out that they actually met on the CT a month ago. He lives in Denver; she lives in Virginia. They were going to go on to Daleville, but the rain and the difficulty of the trail put them off. They are getting a shuttle back to her car after eight miles today.
We had enough signal this morning to check the weather. Rain.... for most of the day. We prepared for it, mentally, and headed out. It was a steady rain, most of which fell on the tree canopy and then on us in large drops. The trail was overgrown again, so we got almost as wet from the bushes and brambles along the side as the rain coming from above. 
I figured out why sometimes the tree tunnel, particularly on a rainy day, is so hard. We unexpectedly transitioned to a large farm field. It had just been mowed and we could see the white blazes on posts out in the distance, directing us across the field. We were open to the sky. It was overcast, and by this point, it had stopped raining. If the sun had been out, we would have been baking, but it was such a nice break from the tree tunnel. We could see farm buildings up along the edges, and we waved to the guy who was still mowing another part of the field. I normally wear a hat in a vain attempt to keep bugs out of my hair, but in this open pasture, I could take it off. Oh, that felt good! Another side affect of a freshly mowed field that includes all of the late summer, early fall allergens... sneezing fits.
We were about to start our last climb of the day when we came across the largest oak tree on the AT in the south....the Keefer oak. It's estimated to be around 300 years old and it's huge! Very cool to see.
Really nice shelter tonight. Too bad they put it .4 miles off the trail...down a steep hill! What the heck, folks! That was just mean after a long day, full of wet rocks (and just rocks!) and a big climb at the end. One unusual thing we had toward the end of the trail before the shelter trail... cairns. There must have been a dozen or more of the large piles of rocks. Not stacked rocks, like you would normally think of as a cairn. These were big piles of lichen covered stones.Of course we had no signal, so we missed a family Zoom call tonight. That was a bummer!","Warspur shelter
",Sarver Hollow shelter,"Aug 21, Fri",12.60
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630209,"We slept a little late this morning, listening to the rain on the shelter roof and decided to stay in bed. We knew we didn't have a long day so we were not in a huge hurry.
The rain finally cleared and we hiked the .4 miles back up to trail. Along the top we came across what they call ""the ledges."" They are a series of boulders along the top of the ridge. These required some skill to climb across. The huge rocks were steeply slanted with barely any foot holds. It was definitely one of those eyes front moments because the drop off the side was steep. The steps up and down were often higher than our knees and required letting our trekking poles hang from our wrists as we used our hands to assist the moves. The weight of our packs throwing off our balance didn't help. 
Once we were thru the rocks, the downhill was pretty smooth for several miles. We came all the way down to a creek with several campsites near a road. We started to hear the customary distant afternoon thunder but got to our campsite without rain. The site was along a dry creek bed, right before the trail headed back uphill. We got all of our camp chores done, and still had time to lay down in the tent to rest before dinner. We should know better.
The thunder sounded closer, but the skies were blue so we didn't worry....mistake. We decided we'd better quickly eat dinner, but the rain came down hard before we finished. We dove for cover and ate the rest in the tent. Eating in your tent is a big no-no on bear country. The rain finally stopped enough to get out, brush our teeth and finish hanging the food bags. Back in the tent, the rain started again. Bob's hiking clothes are still on the line. Maybe the rain will stop overnight and they will be kind of rinsed and only as wet as they usually are.","Sarver Hollow shelter
",Campsite at mile 690.2,"Aug 22, Sat",8.40
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630210,"We woke up early this morning. It seemed darker than usual because our tent was down in a hollow, surrounded by steep sides and we couldn't see the sky lightening. We had a long 14.4 mile to hike today with two pretty decent climbs, one up Brush Mt to the Audie Murphy Memorial, and the other up and over the infamous Dragons Tooth. After the rain last night, everything was damp. Bob's hiking clothes had stayed on the line, but weren't much wetter than they usual are....nothing dries out here.
It was a fairly reasonable 2.5 miles up with many beautiful switchbacks to the Audie Murphy Memorial.  The memorial is a large granite marker placed here by the local VFW. Audie Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of World War II, and he died nearby in a airplane crash in 1971. We have met several veterans on the trail. The memorial was surrounded by mementos, both remembering and honoring military service.The decent down Brush Mt. was also pretty mellow. Before we started the climb up Cove Mt. and the Dragons Tooth we ate a quick lunch. Close to the top, we met a SOBO section hiker from NJ named ""Sunnyside."" He was planning on finishing the trail down to Springer Mt. in Georgia. We chatted with him for quite a while since lately we haven't run into many other thru or long section hikers. Not much later, we ran into two other SOBO hikers. They were the first flip-flop thru hikers we've met. They had already hiked from the Front Royal, VA (north end of Shenandoah Nat'l Park) to the northern AT terminus on Katahdin in Maine and now are on their way south to Springer Mt.
The hike along the 4 mile ridge line of Cove Mt. to the Dragons Tooth seemed to go on for ever with many, many climbs over piles of boulders. The Dragons Tooth is a huge stone monolith a little off the trail that sticks near vertically out of the ridge. This being a Sunday there were a lot of day hikers who'd made the climb up to another iconic spot on the AT. At the blue blaze side trail leading down to the tooth, we took off our packs and set them down. It was so freeing to follow the trail down without that weight! There were quite a few people crawling around the rocks at the Dragon's Tooth. After a bit, I went back and sat with our packs while Bob took some more pictures at the tooth.
The decent down the trail from the tooth was pretty rough. We really think there should be a better warning to hikers about the difficulty of the trail. Some sections required letting our poles hang from our wrists and sitting as we crawled down the rocks. Definitely not for everyone!
We met the woman who owns the other motel in Pearisburg, which is currently closed. She talked about how much she loves and admires thru-hikers, and that she is in the process of rehabing her motel after a storm severely damaged the property.
At the bottom of the trail, the path split. One way went to a parking lot; the other was the AT. The route designers, in all their generous wisdom, decided to send us up over another 1.5 mile bump. We were already kind of tired at this point and an additional, pointless climb over a rock ridge was not amusing. To make the situation prefect, the skies opened up with a fierce, cold downpour, complete with thunder and lightening. Choice words were directed toward the heavens and the AT. We were soaked within minutes and the trail turned into a rocky, raging torrent. At one point, we both just tossed our trekking poles down 20 or more feet and had to use our hands to climb down. During this last section, Bob sharply wrenched his right arm and pole backwards at an awkward angle. He felt a shooting pain in his upper arm and had to finish the remainder of the decent using only one arm. Not good!
The rain had lessened by the time we made it to the road. Now we had a .4 mile uphill to the Four Pines Hostel ... and hot showers. On the way along the road, a mini-van stopped and rolled down the window. It turned out the be the hostel operator, ""Nature Boi,"" with two other hikers. They were heading into the Lowes in Salem, VA for some construction materials for the hostel, and to get something to eat. We eagerly hopped in...soaking wet, shivering, and Bob in pain. Within 30 minutes we were off the trail, out of the rain and in a Lowes parking lot. It's freaky how quickly the situation can change. Because the Wendy's drive thru line was so long, we ended up back at the gas station/general store near the hostel, still wet, getting our resupply, a few cheese burgers and a six pack of beer. We finally got back to the hostel around 7:30 for the much anticipated hot showers.","Campsite at 690.2

We had real coffee and the sweet rolls we had bought at the store last night... supplemented with beef jerky for a little protein.
The sun was out and it was a beautiful morning. There were signs that it was going to be a warm day, tho. The climb was not bad at all. We got to our first pack-off rest spot and had a bit of a  signal. We heard from our Australian friends, Jo and Steve (remember them?). They are on their way to Ireland! They have been biking across the U.S. since we last saw them. Now, they are taking their bikes and heading to one of the few countries who would allow them in... having spent so much time here in the U.S. with our virus numbers. We wish them a fantastic, next adventure!
Today was about the climb up to McAfee Knob, one of the most iconic places on the AT. It is a rock ledge that sticks out over a valley. Both day hikers and thru-hikers love to photograph and be photographed at the knob. We were no exception. We took our time getting up to it, so we arrived later in the afternoon. The view of the valley below and the mountain ranges was spectacular! One of, if not the, best view on the trail so far. Some of the braver folks will actually sit on the edge and hang their feet over.....oh, heck no!
We saw a lot more hikers today. We ran into a mother and teenage daughter from Indiana we were out for a few nights. It was the daughter's first backpacking trip. We ran into a few guys doing the local ""triple crown,"" a 35 mile backpacking loop which includes McAfee Knob, the Dragon's Tooth, and Tinkers Cliffs. At the shelter tonight, there we three other guys, all doing various sections. This is the most people we've had with us at a shelter in weeks.
We actually have a moon tonight. We haven't really seen a moon in weeks, either due to clouds, tree cover or being in a shelter. Tonight, we could see the waxing half moon in the sky just as the sun was setting, and there was enough break in the trees to see it. Even in our tent, we can still see the slight glow. It's a nice change from being so dark on previous night's that I could not tell if my eyes were open or closed.","Four Pines Hostel

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630212,"It was a beautiful morning. We packed up and got going a little early because we had our longest day yet. We could also tell it was going to be hot, so the more miles we can get in early, the better.
Within twenty minutes, Bob heard some scratching. We both stopped and looked. About fifty yards away, I saw an indistinct black mass come down a tree and head off in the opposite direction, down the hill... moving fast. A bear! We'd heard from other hikers that there were a couple of bears active in this area. We kept hiking and a few minutes later, we heard it again. This time we both saw it...head, ears, butt coming down the tree, running quickly away from us down the hill! Two bears before 8:00 AM! That was the best way to see bears...no danger, no drama. They seemed to us to be maybe yearlings because they didn't look too big, but we aren't sure.
Within the first five miles, we got to the last spot in the local triple crown, Tinker Cliffs. The expansive view of the mountain ridges and valleys was a little further along the view from McAfee Knob. We could see a few intimidating, higher peaks in the distance, wondering which ones the trail would take us across.
The rest of the day was a series of ups into large boulder ridges and down a bit, then back up on to more boulder ridges and down again. It was the warmest day we've had so far at almost 90 degrees. The last 10 miles there were no water sources so we had to fill up our hydration bladders before that section. It's important that we drink as much water as we can, especially in the heat. The hard part is that water is heavy...2.2 pounds per liter, 6.6 extra pounds if we fill our bladders.
From the ridge we walked along all day we could look down and see Daleville, where we are going to zero...it was taunting us. By the time we walked out of the woods right onto the edge of a divided four lane road, we were exhausted and hot. It was rush hour so we had to wait for a break in traffic before crossing the road like a game of Frogger.
Our motel was very close and we stopped at the convenience store next door to pick up some Propel (for some much needed electrolytes), and some cold beer for dinner. At the motel, we showered, started laundry, ordered pizza and collapsed. Yahoo for a zero tomorrow!","Campbell shelter

Our motel was yards from the trail; the grocery, outfitter, and fast food was a quick quarter mile down the road. The Super 8 had a king size bed (real estate!) and a nice remodeled room for less than what we paid for the bare bones motel back in Pearisburg. It also includes a grab and go breakfast, which is nice. We also discovered that there is a difference between a Food Lion or Food City and a Kroger. We definitely prefer the Kroger ?
We had to stop at the outfitter for a few things. My headlamp was shorting out... to the point where I had to take the batteries out every morning so they would not drain. Now I have one that is waterproof. We also needed to replace some s-biners (double gated S shaped carabiners), several of which we have lost along the way. We use them all the time and didn't want to be without. The Outfitter was also nice enough to mail a package of unnecessary gear and stuff to help lighten our loads.
The restaurant on the other side of the parking lot from the motel is, of course, a Mexican restaurant. It seems to be a trend. We went there for dinner tonight and had an enormous meal of fajitas (at least they have some veggies), wine and flan for dessert. Yum!

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630258,"We left our comfy motel this morning and got back on the trail about a hundred yards away. The first roughly two miles were in this odd place between highways. We could hear the divided four lane were we walked back into the woods and we could hear the interstate highway we were about to walk under. I'm sure some of the semi-truck drivers on the interstate were surprised to see us with our packs and trekking poles along the side of the hill before we dipped down under the highway.  As we passed over the first little hill, past some houses and across a field, we couldn't hear the highway any more. We were back in our zone.
It was hot today. The terrain was not particularly taxing, but it was a tough day none the less. It's always hard to get back on the trail after a zero day, and today seemed particularly tough for both of us. Today was the hottest day we'd had on trail and it drained our energy. The mosquitoes, gnats and flies were incessant. The bug spray we apply in the morning gets sweated off as the day goes on. For some reason, flies like to plague us by flying in a figure eight formation around us. The same fly seems to follow us for yards down the trail. We had to stop at a creek for our evening's water a half a mile before the shelter. We had both completely emptied our hydration bladders almost a mile back. Poor Bob tried to stand on a rock to start filtering water but the rock was unstable. When I turned around to look, he was standing in the creek up to his ankles in water. So much for dry shoes and socks! As we scooped the water and filtered it, a giant horse fly kept dive bombing us and trying to land on and take a chunk out of Bob. Our sense of humor, not much in evidence at all today, disappeared entirely.
We were both pretty drained, both mentally and physically, when we got to the shelter. We mixed up some electrolytes in a drink bottle to help restore us a bit. After dinner, etc., we retreated to the tent and hoped for cooler temperatures.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630259,"We had a short day today...only seven plus miles. After a rough day yesterday, we were a little slow moving this morning.
After only a couple of miles, we crossed the famous Blue Ridge Parkway for the first time. The trail runs parallel to it for quite a few miles. We chatted with a nice couple who were sitting in some comfy looking chairs at one of the scenic overlooks. They were from Roanoke, which is very near by, and asked us questions about hiking the trail.
Side note... Roanoke is so close that we have been hearing and seeing planes from their airport for the last four or five days.
A little further down the trail, we stopped for a packs off break just past an overlook pull out, because there were good rocks to sit on. There were several vehicles parked at the overlook and it looked like an organized meeting of some sort. In a normal year, if we were passing thru with the ""wave,"" we might suspect that someone with a grill on the back of a pickup with a tarp over it was sharing trail magic. This is not a normal year. However, a guy came over to us and asked if we were thru-hikers. He was part of a group that comes here every year to watch and record the annual hawk migration. They will be there every day until I think September 15. It was just after lunch time, and he offered us some leftovers from their meal. Today was vegetable day for them, so we had some green beans, corn on the cob and roasted potato. Wow! We actually got some trail magic! It was such a pleasant surprise. We chatted with him for almost an hour (good thing it was a short day!)
Our shelter tonight is not far off the parkway. In fact, we can hear the cars go past. If you were driving, however, you would never know that there is an AT shelter less than half a mile away. It was really almost a nero today, but it gave us some time to rest. It was still hot today. We're expecting the rain from the remnants of hurricane Laura to start this evening.

Just as we had shut off a podcast and were settling down for the night last night we heard a great crashing noise. It sounded like a huge branch, and we both thought....our food bags! Bob jumped out of the tent with his headlamp, fully expecting to see a black fuzzy face staring back at him. Nope....the reflector tape we had put on the bottom of our bags was still up in the tree where we'd hung them. Phew! Another night safe. Your head races to the options you have if you are out several days from your last resupply or your next, and your food gets stolen.
We packed up, debating whether we should wear our rain gear or not. It was cool enough to maybe start with it to try and keep some parts of us dry until the rain was supposed to stop mid-morning.The trail for the first few miles paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway. We crossed it several times but the views were all socked in with fog. We were walking up a narrow section when Bob saw a bear flash across the trail about 20 yards ahead of us! That really makes you take a closer look at the vegetation along the side of the trail.
The rest of the day was pretty routine. The weather cleared by late morning so we took our rain gear off at our lunch break. The afternoon warmed up and the skies turned blue. We had one big up and down at the end of the day. We followed a creek for a while until we reached the shelter.
Bob remembered this shelter from his last trip. It is memorable by its architecture alone. It is multi leveled, can hold probably 20 plus hikers, and is built with timber frame construction. It's really an impressive shelter. Apparently it was designed by an architecture student friend of the guy to whom the shelter is dedicated. According to the plaque, the guy died very young.
There were two men at the shelter when we got there. One was trying to section hike Virginia; the other was new to backpacking, after biking around the country for many years. They were both interesting characters. Lee, the guy trying to section hike, had hurt his back and had been trying to rest at the shelter for a few days. Donald, the former cyclist, was older and still learning about backpacking gear. We visited and listened to a classic rock radio station on a transistor radio one of them had.
Bob's shoulder has been bothering him again today. A bruise is appearing and that arm looks different from the opposite arm. It hurt to move the arm certain ways and to carry his pack on that side. It's bad enough that we have decided to try to get a shuttle out in the morning and try to have it looked at.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630475,"We packed up this morning with a shadow hanging over us. We walked out to the Middle Creek Campground and found a shuttle driver to bring us to the airport in Roanoke to rent a car. We didn't know where to go to have Bob's arm checked, but thought having transportation would be helpful.
Our shuttle driver, Homer Witcher, was amazing. He and his wife are truly dedicated trail maintainers. They hiked the entire trail together in 2002 with their two kids, aged 11 & 8! They have taken responsibility for maintaining a section of the trail near Daleville (and possibly more).  They mow the path, keep the brambles trimmed, and have even planted quite a number of trees. Their son joins them. It's people like these, and their care and dedication, that make this trail such a special.
We picked up a rental car at the Roanoke Airport for ease of getting around, if necessary, and checked into a motel. Since it was a Sunday afternoon, we couldn't get a hold of some of the people we needed. Bob had torn his bicep tendon several years ago and had surgery to reattach it. What we are seeing with his arm now is somewhat similar. After some discussions, we decided that an ER visit might enable us to at least get a more accurate diagnosis.
We were disheartened and hungry for some real food tonight...no ramen, no rehydration, no fast food. We found an little, old fashioned local steak house, and both of us tucked into a steak dinner. Oh, it tasted good!","Bryant Ridge shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630476,"We're on our way home again. It's such a disappointment that we are leaving the trail again. At least this time it was a medical problem that drove us off. A visit to the Roanoke ER confirmed what we suspected...most probably a torn bicep tendon. The ER discharge papers state that Bob can't lift more than five pounds. Good luck backpacking with that type of restriction! We've chosen to leave to prevent a total separation of the tendon.
Donna's brother graciously drove us back to North Carolina to get our car. We spent a very nice night with Donna's brother, and Bob's cousins. We left this morning for the almost 12 hour drive home. As we drove, Bob made appointments with doctors at home.
During the drive from Roanoke to western North Carolina yesterday, we passed all the small towns we had hiked thru in the previous eight weeks. It was surreal to pass each of these towns in a matter of minutes and hours that had taken us days and weeks to hike thru. Now that we are back in the world of cars and buildings, it feels like the hike never happened. We are disappointed that we had just reached the halfway mark in both time and miles for what we were planning to accomplish this year. We were looking forward to the Shenandoahs, Harpers Ferry, the halfway point in Pennsylvania...so many things. Guess that officially now makes us section hikers instead of thru-hikers. It's a blow to realize that we did not make a thru-hike, but that doesn't mean we're going to stop.
P.S. Bob saw the orthopedic surgeon and he diagnosed it IS a rupture of the long head tendon of the bicep muscle. This part of the bicep muscle does only 5% of the work for the arm so surgery is not normally performed to repair the injury.  It will heal up on its own.  We look forward to doing another chunk of the trail next year.  We're ""Chunk Hikers"" now....or LASHers...""long a** section hikers"" ;)","

We started our tail and trail in February of 2020…just ahead and ignorant of the pandemic that was about to overtake the world. That pushed us off trail after a month of hiking and we sat on our hands for a few months. With our thru-hiking plans dashed, we decided to head out again in the beginning of July of 2020 and go as far as Delaware Water Gap. Unfortunately, Bob tore his longhead bicep tendon around Labor Day…in the middle of Virginia. So, home again we went. We decided that we will now become Lashers…..long ass section hikers.
In 2021, we had all of our plans in place to head out in May to do another third of the trail. Bob’s cardiologist had different ideas. Bob became the proud owner of a new defibrillator, surgically implanted in April 2021. He is doing fine, but this delayed our hike for another year so that he could completely heal for such a strenuous endeavor.
Here we are in May of 2022, ready and anxious to get back on the trail! We’re a few pounds heavier, and a few years older, but hey, who’s counting! We swapped out and refined some of our gear, but kept most of it.
Our plan this year is to hike the middle third of the trail leaving the final third for next year. We’ll start off where we left off in 2020, approximately 35 miles northeast of Roanoke, VA and finish at the Massachusetts-Vermont state line. Roughly 830 miles. Given our current level of fitness (or lack thereof) it should take us about three months.
So far on the trail we have passed through 4 states, GA, NC, TN and VA. This next section will take us through 5 more states, the rest of VA, WV, MD, PA, NJ, NY, CT and MA.

After the very filling hotel breakfast, we got a ride back to the parking area closest to the beautifully constructed Bryant Ridge shelter (the last shelter we stayed in back in 2020, near Buchanan, VA). There were several prospective trails leading into the woods and of course we took the wrong one.  Half an hour later we were back on the correct trail. We're starting out slowly, keeping our miles under 10 per day for the first 2 weeks. Today was only 5 miles, not including our little misdirection this morning. That was plenty since it was almost all uphill! The rain varied from a drizzle to steady but not soaking all day. We got to the shelter early and sat watching the patchy blue sky turn gray and start to pour more heavily. As I sat there, I realized that these shelters are the saving grace of a journey that is so often plagued by rain. Without them this trail would be almost insufferable! Big thank you  to all the trail and shelter maintainers!!
The rain got heavier and drenched hikers started to stream into the cover of the shelter. A couple stayed briefly until the worst passed but 6 are staying in the shelter tonight and 6 tents besides ours popped up around it. It became really crowded when we all tried to huddle under the shelter overhang to cook and eat our dinners in the pouring rain. We visited with folks a little. It was a combination of thru hikers and section hikers. The thru hikers already were well into high miles and we knew we'd never see them again. We might some of the section hikers but we're starting so slowly that I doubt even that.

The crew last night were early risers so they were mostly gone by the time we managed to get our stuff packed and together for breakfast at about 8. It's our first morning so we haven't gotten our rhythm yet...what goes in which stuff sack and where it goes in our packs. Everything has a place or chaos prevails! We'll get there!Another short day to the next shelter. The undergrowth beside the trail was covered with beautiful pink trillium! We don't have that color at home so they are particularly nice. Bob even spotted a barred owl as it flew from one perch to another! What a treat!! The fact that they fly absolutely silently thru the tight tangle of trees is amazing!We also crossed Apple Orchard mountain,  complete with a golf ball shaped FAA tower, the highest point on the trail until we reach New Hampshire. Ha! Does that mean it's all downhill until we cross the Hudson River in New York? Not bloody likely. The shelter tonight has some nice tent spots and another really nice privy! That's 2 nights in a row with a clean, well built privy. THAT can't last.During the afternoon and at dinner,  we chatted with 2 pleasant guys who are chipping away at their 20 year section hike plan to do the trail, Eric ""Cork"" and Dave. One is from very near us outside Chicago (Geneva) and the other from Indianapolis. They do a week or two of the trail every year.We made a new tyvek drop cloth for the tent before we left but had sized it wrong. It stuck out too far beyond the tent so it created a perfect scoop to let all the rain we'd been having pool under us. Not good.

This of course meant it was a little chillier. When you're packing for a shoulder season like this, you tend to compromise on your clothing. Will I really need those thermal pants? Will my summer weight sleeping bag be sufficient? Should I bring the puffy and send it home later? Bob was toasty with his silk liner but I got a little creative with my rain jacket over my legs. My 35 degree bag rating is a bunch of hooie!
We were delayed leaving this morning trying to dry the tent fly a bit before packing it. Between dew on the outside and condensation on the inside, it was soaked. The sun came out, tho, and it was a beautiful day! We even had a nice view down the valley. The butterflies emerged in the sunshine, and we saw more undergrowth filled with trillium, wild geranium, May apples, 2 colors of spider wort, and sweet smelling mountain azaleas. This is migration and nesting season for many birds so we've been hearing lots of them. So many more than we've heard out here before.We're feeling stronger and the terrain wasn't bad so we got to the camp site as early as we'd done the 2 previous 5 mile days.

It's a lot easier when everything is dry. It was almost all downhill. We are staying at the famous Stanimals hostel in Glasgow. Because cell reception is so spotty we had to make a call about 5 miles before to make arrangements for the hostel to pick us up. The driver turned out to be ""Fives,"" the chef from several nights ago. He's helping out the hostel owner. The hostel is one of the highlights of the trail and has a well earned reputation. Since we arrived early, we were able to get showered, laundry done and walked to the local grocery for resupply before the other hikers arrived. The grocery owner thru hiked several years ago so he knows just what the hiker wants to eat and keeps his store well supplied.We arrived in town on a good night. The local Episcopal church has adopted the trail and the hiker community as their mission. They even sponsored a local boy scout to earn his rank of eagle scout by building a shelter in town. The local town restaurant (read 'only') is closed on Monday, so this church puts on a free ""hiker feast"" (big dinner spread) for the hikers. They've been doing this for 7 years. About 17 hikers sat around a big table visiting and enjoying homemade jambalaya, shrimp etouffe, vegetarian lasagna, mostaccioli, salad and desserts.

It was rocky and the sun was bright. I can't complain about the sunshine but it does make it warm when you're trudging uphill with 35 pounds on your back. We both completely filled our 3 liter water bladders because after the first mile there wasn't another water source until we got to the shelter, 9 miles down trail. Water weighs in at 2.2 pounds per liter so that's 6.6 pounds of water alone! It was so warm and the trail just beat us down today. Both of us arrived at the shelter with no water left.

Folks in these trail towns are used to hikers and have a lot of patience with us. We quickly located the important aisles, pre-packaged meats, Ramen, Knorr's sides, and snacks. We all over bought because we were all hungry. We sat outside with our booty and repackaged it in our food storage bags, which now barely fit in our packs.

Even tho we've been at shelters with him for the last few days he ALWAYS beats us there by quite a bit. We weren't sure we'd see him tonight because the trail is a inconveniently placed .6 miles off the trail! Who does that?! It adds a total of 1.2 miles to an already ridiculously long adventure.

I know they're not as rare as they used to be but they are rare for us and it was a treat to see. Bob was even lucky enough to see another one later in the day.
We pushed a little further than we were originally going to today by about 2 miles to a shelter instead of a camp site. Shadow was there as well as several other hikers we hadn't met yet. Everyone is tenting instead of staying in the shelter. We've seen this most of the time. Unless the weather is bad or the hiker arrives late and doesn't want to set up a tent in the dark, most of the time people tent. The tents are so small and so light now that it's easier for people to carry their own.The bugs around the shelter were incessant!...the worst we've seen so far. I immediately pulled out and put on my bug shirt (a no-see-em mesh shirt that completely covers my head, face, arms and torso with a zipper to allow access to eat) It's a luxury item but, for whatever reason, bugs always go for me.

We were up and out by 8 with an easy day planned. After several 10's or near that, we decided to treat ourselves to a 6.5. We arrived at the Priest shelter by 12:30. Several folks who had arrived after dark last night were here napping and eating lunch. We learned a new meal combination, although I think Bob is more intrigued than I am. One guy was eating a tortilla wrapped with bacon bit crumbles and Fritos.The other folks were just getting ready to take off and we had just eyed the best and flattest tent spot to setup. Then, they started to arrive....a stream of teenage boys with backpacks and a few adults. Now, we have nothing against boy scouts. We were both scouts. However, when we crawl into our tent at 8:30pm hoping to fall quickly asleep and there are a dozen teenage boys within 50 feet, we might have difficulty. So we made a choice, loaded up on water and moved on. We then found out that there were at least 2 other troops in the area. Ah, well, it is Saturday night. The privy was closed at the shelter anyway because it's full. We only had to walk another .7 to find a nice steath camping spot.The previous peaked our curiosity. How do the privies get serviced? In this part of Virginia, the privies are concrete vaults, as opposed to, say, the Smokies where they are moldering privies. Because we are in a designated wilderness area, powered equipment is not allowed. That most likely means hand tools and hazmat suits. What an unpleasant thought. Another big shout out to those who do the work that no one else wants to, to allow us to indulge our wilderness experience. 
New feature! The FarOut app (formerly Guthooks) has added a new feature....""what3words."" what3words is an app that allows a specific one square meter area to be located anywhere in the world by using a designated 3 word combination.

It started with thunder in the distance, the wind kicked up, and finally a full on rain storm. Lightning lit up the sky and it felt very close. The wind was so strong that both of us wondered if we should stake the tent down tighter but neither was willing to go out to fix the issue. A good rule of camping in general is to prepare for some sort of rain every night and we do the bestwecan. Even in the tent we keep things either in dry bags or up in one of the mesh pockets, off the tent floor. Luckily, the rain stopped by about 11 and the wind had completely dried out the fly by morning. It was a beautiful sunny morning with some breeze so we were able to flip up the tent on its side and rig up the ground cloth from a tree to dry them out before packing them away.  Wonder how those boy scouts fared last night. Our campsite was on the very top of the Priest at over 4000 feet. It's the last 4k foot peak until New Hampshire. The descent was about 2500 feet over 2 miles to the river. It started pretty steep and rocky but them mellowed a bit. We stepped over one tree sized limb from a big oak tree that appeared to have come down very recently. It took a limb from a maple with it on the way down. We're pretty sure it was from last night's storm. The humidity level is akin to the tropics but the tree cover helps a little with the heat. We had one overlook where we saw the valley completely covered by the clouds below us. Just the mountain tops stuck out. The shelter tonight is beside a pretty mountain stream flowing down between the rocks. We were so hot when we arrived. I ended up just sitting in the freezing water with my clothes on.We'd heard that rain might come in after 5, so we setup the tent, battened down the hatches and began making dinner at the shelter by about 4:30. A father and son are out for a section hike south bound between Waynesboro and Glasgow. The teenage son arrived about 2 before the dad. When the dad did arrive, he laid out his sleep pad and took a nap. Sure enough, the skies opened up right at 5:20. We just made it back and into the tent. We did the best we could to keep the water from running under the tent between the ground cloth and the tent and soaking the tent bottom. Good thing our sleep pads are inflatable!

Nothing really dries out in this humidity.  We packed up and headed up to the area called the Three Ridges. The temperature has dropped today and it was completely overcast. I checked ay one point when I had a signal and it was 57 degrees. That's much cooler than what we've been dealing with, but the humidity was just as high. Several hikers passed us on the way up some pretty rocky climbs. We ended up chatting with them when they stopped to rest and we caught up. I think they might have been impressed that the old farts made it up a particularly steep and rocky section (we actually had to use our hands a bit) Everyone was very conscious of and trying to beat the forecasted storm.It's interesting to watch which plants appear  at which altitudes. With absolutely no scientific backing, it seems that the top of the near 4k foot peaks have the fragrant mountain azaleas as a nice reward for reaching the top. I think the mountain laurel appear the next down the hill, then the long, dark rhodie tunnels. When you emerge from the rhodie tunnels the wild geraniums and violets appear amongst the rest of the unidentifiable plants.OK, back to outrunning the storm. We had enough signal at the top of the last ridge to see that we had about an hour to get down to the next shelter (2.5 miles down over unknown rocks) before the rain started. Too bad because it was a pretty little area at the top to stop for a real break. We were hoping to go past the actual shelter to find a country store listed in the 2020 AWOL guide for enough resupply to get us into town. We hightailed it down the hill and reached the shelter just as the rain was starting. We paused at the shelter to put on our rain jackets and find the jeep road that's supposed to lead us out. The shelter journal had an entry from Shadow dated yesterday that said he thought the county store and Rusty's Hard Time Hallow appeared closed (we had told him about both), but we didn't listen. Maybe he got there on a bad day...the website still said they were open. It was full on raining and we walked the 1.7 miles up, down and around on the jeep road and then another half mile along the Blue Ridge Parkway. We were thoroughly drenched, but now bound and determined to have a dry bed for the night come what may. We found the cabins and store under renovation. Out of pure luck, the couple working there had stopped back before heading into town. They took pity on the poor drowned rats and offered us a ride into town to the hostel. What a fascinating story they have. They'd grown up in the area and left for college. Then, they had trained in Prague as ESL instructors and spent 5 years in Barcelona teaching. One of their brothers was teaching ESL in China. They are excited to be involved in renovating these cabins and turning them into a family resort, and stop for cyclists and motorcyclists traveling on the renound Blue Ridge Parkway. Well, tonight we are snug, clean and dry in Stanimals-Waynesboro. What a glorious feeling! We've decided to zero tomorrow, a day earlier than we'd planned. We were able to get a private room instead of bunks in a 5 or 6 person bunk room. It's very little more and offers privacy and a place to escape in a crowded hostel. The manager, Christina, made a huge batch of shepherds pie for everyone to share at dinner. It was warm and filling comfort food on a rainy evening. There was even a TV in our room. Since the guys upstairs had chosen to watch the movie ""Brewfest"" on the big TV in the common room, I retreated downstairs to relax. Bob joined later and we got sucked into ""A Very British Scandal"" on Amazon. These little treats are so welcomed after tenting for so long.

It drizzled all day long and you somehow feel justified in sitting inside on an old couch, sorting thru your gear and catching up on things with a good wifi signal. This Stanimals is bigger than the one in Glasgow. By my calculations, there are 15 bunks, 6 private rooms, maybe 3 larger rooms in a back building and one tiny house. We've seen folks we've met before, met some new people, and finally met people we've heard about. We randomly chat about where people come from, how many miles folks are doing, who's ""slack packing"" and where. Slack packing is when you empty everything out of your backpack except essentials for a day hike, get a shuttle ride to a point up the trail and hike back to stay at the same hostel. Since you are carrying so much less weight you can hike longer miles. Some purists don't like to do it, and it can get more expensive because of the cost of the shuttle and the extra stay at the hostel, but it's pretty common. We did some research on the upcoming section thru Shenandoah National Park. We have heard that you don't have to carry as much food because there are wayside places to get food from vendors along the way. Unfortunately, we are reading that some of the waysides don't start selling sandwiches, etc. until July 1st. Bummer. We might be able to just buy the same type of food we've been eating at a few places so we are still going to carry less. We walked to the CVS, Dollar General, and Wal-Mart groceries to gather the few things we needed to fill out our meals...breakfast protein bars, Swiss Miss to mix with coffee in the morning, Kind bars, and the ubiquitous ramen.We decided we wanted a real meal for lunch so we wandered down to a local burger place one of the guy at the hostel had recommended. Delicious! We even got to try beers from a local brewery, Devil's Backbone. We'd heard about the bewery from several hikers who had shuttled off the trail just to go there.Back at the hostel, we napped, planned our next stretch, hung out, and enjoyed some beef stew for dinner.

When we were all packed up, one of the shuttle drivers brought us back to the trail at the south entrance of Shenandoah National Park. There was a box where we registered our journey thru the back country. We're kind of excited because we've heard that the trail thru the park is pretty great. 
We ran into one of the wonderful trail maintainers out trimming the long grasses along the trail. These people are all volunteers and do a fabulous job keeping up the trail for the rest of us to enjoy. Thank goodness at this point on the trail it was not a designated wilderness area because he was able to use a gasoline powered weed-wacker and make much more headway. If it had been wilderness, he would be wielding a machete. 
We ran into an older couple out for a day hike. He'd done a thru hike 10+ years before to celebrate HIS 60th birthday....must be a thing. 
When we reached the shelter tonight it looked like it was going to be a nice night. We setup the tent and sat at the shelter getting dinner ready. As we sat there we could see a cloud start to descend around the site. The humidity level began to rise and reach a level of heavy mist. As the early evening went on, the mist continued to thicken. It felt like being caught in the vegetable mister at the grocery store that was stuck in the on position...not quite rain but very, very wet. The mist got so heavily coated on the leaves of the trees that it fell like rain on our tent and soaked it. As soon as we finished eating and had hung our food on the bear pole, we went into our tent and tried to keep our things dry. We discovered that our tent floor is well and truly leaking. We have a signal so we started to do some research to replace our tent. We've had it for years and it's done 800 miles of the trail so it doesn't owe us anything. It's just frustrating...and we're wet and not in good spirits.

As we walked out the sun tried very hard to peek out thru the fog. We hiked thru blooming mountain laurels on both sides of the trail with the fog and mist just beyond us. It was kind of magical. Well, tonight we did what we don't normally do. We are sleeping in a shelter. Since our wet and muddy experience last night we want to stay dry when the rain rolls in again tonight. All the other hikers have the same idea because we have over filled the shelter with 12 people. Eight are packed head to toe across the bottom level so we can make room. It seems like a good group of people so I hope it will be a good experience.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652088,"We both actually slept well considering how many people were crammed into the shelter. Although, Bob said at one point he heard everyone snoring or at least making some kind of noise....it was a symphony! We don't spend a lot of nights in shelters so it's interesting to observe the dance. Hiker midnight we knew about....everyone is in bed and settled before sundown. Hiker dawn was interesting. Everyone started to stir around 5:30 AM. Some are very efficient and are packed up and back on the trail within an hour. Some take longer, like us, even tho we all seem to stir at the same time. 
It rained a large part of the night but held off while most people got ready to leave. The big question was not if it would rain today but how much....do we start with our raincoats on or not. As we left it was pretty evidently a coats on kinda day. As we hiked, the rain kept coming down harder...a deep, soaking rain. We were quickly drenched and walking in a river of water. Somehow it wasn't disheartening. We'd known the rain was coming so we were prepared for it. We were more disheartened the other night as we lay in our tent with the sopping wet floor trying to keep our things dry, and realizing that our tent was failing and we would have to go thru the hassle of replacing it.About seven miles into the day there was a camp store where we could buy some resupply. The rain had just about stopped by the time we got there. The other hikers from our shelter had beaten us there and had mostly stripped down to their underwear and thrown their wet layers into a dryer to dry them and warm them up. The day's high temp was only about 60, which is really cold when you're wet. We didn't want to take the time so we bought a sandwich for lunch, some resupplies for upcoming breakfasts and dinners, then stood in the laundry room to warm up while we charged our phones and chatting with other hikers doing the same. The sun actually came out in the afternoon! We took off our pack covers to let our packs dry a little as we hiked. Pack covers never really work in the kind of rain we just had. They just delay the inevitable. It's amazing, tho, how quickly all that water, which had been a river on the trail, had been reabsorbed almost completely back into the ground. Just wonderful mud is left. It helps feed all the springs, which have been flowing freely. Our second 13 mile day in a row after barely two weeks out and we were both getting a little sore and cranky. It's supposed to rain again tonight so we both want to make sure we get another place in the shelter. We try and calculate the number of hikers, hoping the youngsters are more ambitious than our meager miles and want to make the following shelter. The push to make it is hard.We did make it and got our spot. Yay! Never thought I'd be so happy to sleep in a shelter but it beats packing a wet tent. There were only seven of us tonight, so plenty of room. We all had dinner, stored everything for the night, food in the bear box, and snug in our bags by 7:30 tonight.On my last privy run, I startled a deer mid step. She froze with her legs outstretched on the downhill in a very awkward position. She stared at me like, well, a deer in headlights. The only thing that twitched were her ears. I say ""her"" because although she was very slender elsewhere, her belly seemed usually large. I wonder if she was pregnant (if that how you refer to a deer)

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652089,"Last night, the snoring was a bit less, but one guy's sleep pad was the noisiest one we'd ever heard! Every position shift he made during the night sounded like a dozen plastic milk jugs being crushed. Note to self, don't buy a Nemo inflatable sleep pad.
While we were all eating breakfast, Bob caught sight of a barred owl snacking on its own breakfast. He has decided that the barred owl is his spirit animal. It's and absolutely beautiful day today. Cool enough to pull out my puffy jacket but a clear blue sky. Cool and sunny make for great hiking days, and we're looking forward to a shorter eight miler today.The trail today was fairly good. We had a bit of an up to start, but that just warmed us up after the chilly start. All along the trail were berry bushes in bloom. There is going to be a bonanza of raspberries in a few weeks! Hope we run into some up north when they'reripe. We thought this would be a feast for all the bears in the park, but we found out later this evening from ""Popsicle"" (who we've run into several times over the past week) that the bear population in Shenandoah has been depleted by nearly 70% in the past few years due to mange. It's very sad for the bear population and the park because they are so integrated and on all the pillows and t-shirts, but it is one less thing to worry about out here.Since it's Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, we've seen a lot of day hikers. They are the folks who are shiny and smell nice with little tiny packs, who give us a wide berth on the trail with they're noses scrunched up. Hey, it's only been a week since we showered, and besides, we got a good rinse in the rain yesterday.Shadow was napping at the shelter when we got here this afternoon. He didn't sleep well last night either so he was tired today. The forecast shows no rain for several days so we are back in our tent tonight. It had been packed up wet for several days so it was starting to get a little stinky. There was plenty of time to air it out and dry it before we crawled into it. Lots of hikers stopped at the shelter but some just rested for a few minutes and grabbed something to eat before heading out again. Among those who stayed, there is a man from Denmark (we had a guy from Finland with us last night), and a woman from Mexico, both thru hiking, plus the regular motley crew of thru hikers. One guy worked very patiently to build a fire in the fireplace with all the damp wood. Fires usually extend the time of ""hiker midnight"" so we were happy to be off in our little nylon house. The sunset is beautiful thru our doorway tonight. 😊

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652264,"We stopped for a lunch break at a park picnic area. Of course the side trail and then the picnic tables were an uphill slog from the trail. Luckily we got there just a bit before the other park visitors enjoying Sunday of this holiday weekend. 
The highlight of the day was the stop for some resupply and possibly dinner at the Lewis Mountain camp store. When we got there, Shadow, Popsicle and T-man were there sitting on the porch enjoying sandwiches. We thought they'd already be at the next hut (forgot to say that shelters are called huts in the Shennies) which is just under a mile from the camp store. We took off our packs and sat down to join everyone. Two other women who'd been at the hut last night were there, too, well into their first beers.Since we all knew the hut was close there was absolutely no hurry to get there. The store owner (""Carhop"") had thru hiked in 2020 as well! We chatted with him for a bit and talked about the ""covid year."" To start, we bought some microwave sandwiches and a couple of beers and sat outside with the rest. It was a great way to spend an hour or two before heading down to camp. Before we left, we all did our resupply, got more sandwiches for dinner to take with us and even some breakfast sandwiches (we'll see how THOSE turn out!)At the hut, Bob and I decided to stay in the shelter for no other reason than we didn't feel like hiking up to the tent pads and setting up our tent. There was a woman here who had thru hiked in 2019 and was just out sectioning thru the park by herself. We all chatted with her while we ate dinner.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652267,"Last night may not have been our best choice to randomly use the shelter out of laziness. Two more people arrived just as we finished dinner. They found out that one of their ""tramily"" (trail family) was back at the campground and store a mile back getting ready to get off trail and go home because he missed his wife and family. They were not going to let that happen without saying goodbye, so they claimed their spots in the shelter and went back to send him off. Everyone else headed to bed or their tents by about 8:00. Another guy, Batton, arrived late, and sat to eat his dinner. Luckily he was up to help the 3 women who showed up just after dark. They had been planning to camp somewhere else but a couple of guys were making them feel uncomfortable so they thought they'd have better luck at the shelter. They had never stayed in a shelter before so Batton very kindly gave them some pointers....like when everyone else is in bed trying to sleep, only use the red light on your headlamp.
Today's walk was one of the smoothest we've had yet. After an initial up and slightly rocky down, it was smooth, pretty flat sailing. Such a treat! It was a half mile uphill to Big Meadows Lodge, which is where we couldn't wait to take a shower and do our laundry before moving on to the next hut, 3.5 miles further on. It's glorious to be clean after a week! We exploded our packs, dug out what we needed and generally took over the picnic table near the showers and laundry for almost two hours. With all the expanse of lodge and surrounding campgrounds, I never thought we'd see Shadow, who knew our plans, but up he walked. He sat down with us for a while and charged his phone. He left to head for the hut, where we'll see him later, and we headed to the lodge for late lunch and an icy cold drink.After pizza, lemonade and a beer at the Tap room, we swung our packs back on and headed another 3.5 miles down the trail to our next hut. We were on the sunny side of the mountain going up some rocky sections with the sun beating on us so that shower went out the window pretty quickly. The side trail to the shelter was, of course, .2 miles down hill and all the tent platforms were up along the side. We decided to grab a tent platform and setup before we went down to the shelter to eat something and see who all is here. Shadow was there, an Australian and a Brit we hadn't met yet, Deana, a section hiker from last night, a couple in their 50's who'd never backpackers before, the two women who'd gotten a little drunk with all of us at Lewis Mountain the other night, and several other folks. The shelter, all the tent pads, and the spare open areas for tents or hammocks are all full tonight. It’s a beautiful night so we decided to leave our tent fly off and try to enjoy a few stars thru the trees. There's no rain in the forecast so we thought we'd take a risk.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652269,"Well, we had some excitement last night. At about 9:00, we had heard and seen a deer wandering around the underbrush about 10 feet from our tent, making a lot of rustling footsteps. It was full dark when we heard the loud sound of shoes being clapped together and yelling coming from a stealth campsite just above and beyond us. We heard it again and now we could make out the word ""bear."" That got our attention. We both grabbed our headlamps and looked in the direction of the noise. We were surprised that there might be a bear near us, both because of the mange story we had heard and the fact that no one we'd talked to had seen or heard about any bears. We were really more curious than concerned (we were the next closest tent, after all). We were sure there was no food in our tent for the bear to go after, and any bear familiar with the area would head for the shelter. The deer had come back near our tent munching away on something and we became convinced that the woman yelling at what she thought was a bear was really spooked by the noises made by the deer. We were up and out early today...7:10! Shadow was right ahead of us. He's got his trail legs 'cause he's been out here since February 23rd. We'd heard it was going to be hot so an early start seemed like a good idea. We had a short day, only 4.5 miles, into the Skyland resort. Skyland is one of the old park lodges with views down into the Shenandoah Valley. We arrived here before 10 AM and found Shadow, Twinkle-toes & Moss (the two women from Lewis Mountain) sitting drinking coffee at a table under a tree in the shade. Since our room wouldn't be ready until at least one o'clock we happily joined them and visited for a while. Chairs with backs are a treat in our world. They all eventually moved on to the next shelters.We finally got checked in and lay down to relax for a bit. Bob found the movie ""Prometheus"" on TV, which we promptly sat and watched. I know that sounds terrible that we would sit and watch a movie in such a beautiful place, but we've been hiking, eating and sleeping outdoors thru this beautiful place for days. It was time for a little inside time. We weren't originally going to stay here but we had an extra day and wanted to break up one 15 mile day into two. After we'd cleaned up and rested, we found the Tap room on the property for a beer and a bit of real food. It's also the only place on the property that we can get a cell signal. Our waiter said that was one of the main reasons they can't keep younger staff for very long.

We left the door open on the balcony so it felt a bit like sleeping outside but on a bed with sheets. Breakfast was eggs, toast, bacon & grits (sausage and potatoes for Bob) and it was perfect. One can only eat chocolate protein bars in the morning for so long. We grabbed a couple of snacks from their gift shop and headed out at a decadent 9:00.Side note, Bob now has a new name, ""Snacks!"" He has earned this because of his organized dedication to his daily snack allotment, each separated into ziplock bags. 😊We knew it was going to be a hot one today and we were right. For backpackers, that's in the 80's or above. The sun was out and a lot of the trail seemed to be more open than usual so it was beating down on us. We ran into Diane a few times today. She left a bunch of her things at the lodge and was slack packing today. As we were walking and looking at the view of the tree covered mountains, we realized that thus far on the whole trail we have been lucky enough to enjoy these vistas of the Blue Ridge mountains. One ridgeline fades behind another in the distance as far as the eye can see. As we get out of the Shennies and move further north, that skyline is going to change and we're really going to miss those views. A side note about  traveling thru Shenandoah National Park on Skyline Drive ( Blueridge Parkway outside the park) by car or maybe motorcycle...the AT crosses the road maybe three or four time in any given day. This means that during hiker season (usually May and June for northbounders or September and October for southbounders) you have to watch for mangy thru hikers popping out of the woods and dodging vehicles to get across to disappear back into the woods on the other side.

We also had another false bear scare last night. To be fair, this shelter was written up as having an aggressive bear from three weeks ago, but I think folks are a little twitchy.
We got up and out in our fastest yet...7:05! It helps if we grab our food from the bear box and take it back to our tent area and skip the morning socializing at the shelter. Most people still beat us out. Everyone is concerned about a rain front that's forecast for this afternoon and wants to get a place in the next shelter, 13 miles away. Halfway thru the day we stopped at another wayside (the Elkwallow wayside). We needed a few more snacks and a breakfast before we hit town. It's been nice (if expensive)not to carry so much thru the park and buy as we go (saves on pack weight). I got a sandwich for lunch and Bob was first in line when the grill opened for a burger. We sat at the picnic tables with some other thru-hikers for nearly an hour, which was not part of our plan.We found a new friend on the way to the wayside, tho. Bob passed it first and then it let me know in no uncertain terms that we were in his or her space....a very dark, almost black timber rattler sitting beside the trail! Bob had experienced this particular sensation of your heart jumping out of your chest but it was a new one for me. Yikkers!!We'd heard on the weather that the rain was supposed to hit between 1 and 2 and then continue for a while. Most of the other hikers knew the weather was coming so we wanted to get to the shelter and get a place for the night. When the rain started, we actually welcomed it. It had been hot for hiking and the rain was light and refreshing. We didn't even use our raincoats. The shelter was a long .2 miles downhill off the trail. Several others were there but the rain had already stopped and some had decided to move on. Gotta make those miles!We had a good chuckle at the current residents of the shelter. Everyone actually staying in the shelter is in the 60+ age group....Gratitude, from Alaska, Guam, from, well, Guam, Goodwater from somewhere, and us. It was definitely AARP group. All these old guys are sporting white beard at least 6 to 8 inches long and probably all have lost 20-30 pounds since they started their hike three months ago. It's quite a motley crew.It is particularly buggy around the shelter tonight, even after we've all crawled into our sleeping bags or quilts. We have one solace. Gratitude has been hiking with mouse traps. He said his count is up to 74 mice so far! He sets them in the shelter at night and that their preferred bait is Vermont white sharp cheddar.

It's good to have a dry tent. As we left to hike back to the trail we passed under a downed tree that I didn't remember ducking under when we came in. One of the hikers who came in late and had tented near the shelter last night said it came down in the storm last night, 30 feet from their tent. When we tent we haven't been very good about watching for ""widow makers,"" dead branches or trees that can come down in a storm. We really need to be better about that! On a good note, Gratitude was able to get four more mice last night. He had a neat little pile of them on the side of the shelter. He was quite efficient at emptying the traps and resetting them quicker than anyone I'd ever seen. Hiking was the usual today. The rain had cooled down the air temperatures so it was very pleasant, if a little chilly. The chill disappears as soon as we start an uphill climb. We did officially leave Shenandoah National Park. We ended the park as we came in, on a long, smooth, flat path. After we left the Park there one spot that was a particularly rocky, ridiculous downhill.We stopped at the next shelter for a packs off break about three miles from the road. Guam and the couple whose tent was missed by the fallen tree were all there, too, for a break. Guam was having trouble with his phone. ATT was supposed to have a great signal and he wasn't getting anything. The other guy tried to help him and ended up popping his sim card out, over the shelter railing and onto the undergrowth and rock covered ground. Gone. We all spent a good 20 minutes trying to find it to no avail. We found that there is an ATT store in Front Royal, which is the next town. Guam was not very tech savvy so eventually the guy (who we are now calling ""Sim Card"") agreed that they would call his father, who was picking them up in another 10 miles anyway, and they would take Guam to the ATT store and get things straightened out. We were very glad to hear that.Once that was all settled, we had to hightail it that last few miles to the road where there is a trolley that runs a few times a day to take hikers into town during hiker season. We made the last pickup with about 15 minutes to spare. We are zeroing in Front Royal. Woo-hoo!

Luckily the laundromat was in the same strip mall as the grocery store. Neither of us had ever seen such a high tech and efficient laundromat. All the machines were run and managed thru an app on the attendant's phone. All the machines looked brand new and the place was spotless. We started up our load, set a timer on our phone and headed to the grocery store to get our supplies. One of the biggies on our list was hydrocortisone cream. The bugs have been vicious! Both of us are covered in bites on our exposed skin and itching like crazy.

We were lying in bed this morning when we got a nice call from Bob's brother checking in. We'd made arrangements with the local cab company to take us back to the trail this morning because the shuttles were busy elsewhere and the free trolley doesn't run until the afternoon. It's a beautiful day in the 60's as we started. The first mile or so we kept smelling a wonderful scent. We think it might be honeysuckle, which I think might be invasive but it sure makes for a pleasant stroll. It's a clear, blue sky and the terrain is pretty good. If you wonder what our days are like when we hike, sometimes we can go for long stretches without saying a word to  each other, sometimes we chatter about random things like Bob's many trips to Disneyland when he was a kid in California, or why we had margarine when we were growing up (or oleo, as my grandmother used to call it with only slight distain) instead of butter. Your head and the thoughts that run thru it can be odd and there are many hiking hours in the day.We stopped for a packs off break at a really nice shelter, the Jim and Milly Denton shelter. There is a separate covered area for the picnic table, and a porch with an Adirondack style couch....with a back (yay!), even a horseshoe pit.The afternoon got a little rocky, which slows down our pace. Maybe it's an age thing but when the sun is either coming thru the leaves and gives a dappled affect or you go from the dark woods to a patch of bright sunlit trail and back to dark woods it's hard to see all the rocks. They varied in size from pea to large dog, and every size in between. Luckily both of us kept our footing. It's just preparing us for the dreaded rocks in Pennsylvania that we keep hearing about.At the bottom of the hill we crossed under Interstate 66, the big divided four lane we'd been hearing all the way down. As we crossed under and down a road walk past some houses the trail made a turn into a parking area. In the clearing at the end of the parking lot we saw folding camp chairs setup along with folding tables and two people got up to meet us....trail magic! Lucky Guy, Lucky Girl and Lucky Dog had a huge spread of hamburgers, hot dogs, potato salad, chips, cookies, drinks, etc.  He had done a thru hike in 2018 and this was their second time doing trail magic. We sat down in those lovely collapsible canp chairs (with backs) and visited with them for close to an hour. We were their last hikers of the day and were about ready to pack up. They wanted us to take more but our food bags were full with five days worth of food for this next stretch. Trail magic is an amazing thing and so very generous of the people providing it. If we lived closer to the trail we would do it, too.We had two and a half miles to go uphill with very full bellies and very heavy packs. It seemed never ending. When we got to the shelter, we were the only ones there, even as late in the day as it was (5 o'clock). It's an old shelter made of log and chink. Bob found that it was built in 1939, so it's one of the originals, and in great condition. We are still tenting. One guy showed up and we had an interesting conversation with him on the merits of ""purists"" who ""fist bump every blaze"" versus ""people who call themselves thru hikers.""

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652595,"Today was one of those tough days for both of us. There was really no good reason for it. It just was. I think it started because we missed our coffee mocha mixture this morning. We tried to add coffee to the coco protein recovery drink we have in the evening but didn't drink last night and when we woke up this morning, the drinks had gone very bad. We chucked those. Then we thought it might be that our eating schedule got messed up because we had the trail magic burger at about 3 o'clock yesterday and then didn't have much more than some string cheese and crackers for actual dinner because neither of us were very hungry. Whatever the reason, neither of us had much energy today. It wasn't even a challenging day physically, except maybe the temps which only got to maybe 80. The sun was out, the sky was blue, the breezes were blowing.....and I was cranky with a wicked headache which progressed with the day.One thing that didn't help was that for a large portion of the day the trail was seriously overgrown. These aren't the pretty mountain laurel of the Shennies. These are invasive honeysuckle vines as thick as your wrist, pricker bushes that grab and scrape at your arms, a dense under story of plants we mostly can't identify hanging out onto the trail, and lots of poison ivy. Any time you have to step out of the way of a hiker coming towards you on the trail you have to be very conscious of where you're stepping for fear of the vile, itch inducing vine.  Sorry, still a bit cranky. When we finally got the shelter tonight, we claimed a precious tent pad and collapsed at the picnic table. We chatted with YJ, who I remember seeing at the Super 8 the day we left, and checked the shelter log book to see if we knew anyone who had passed thru. We found that Shadow had stayed here last night so he's not too far ahead of us. We don't think we'll catch up with him, tho.

We headed into the AT section referred to as the Roller Coaster. There is actually a warning sign for hikers that you are are about to enter this area. It is a series of ups and downs that follow one after the other...hence the name.It was a rough day physically. We have decided that this stretch has been the worst stretch so far on the trail. It was really rocky, really steep, and just up and down all day. The skies were overcast and there was a strong breeze all day that kept the bugs at bay and the temperature low. We'd had the same breeze last night that was strong enough to knock some loose branches from the trees. One good part to the day was that we crossed the 1,000 mile mark on the AT (that's 235 for us on this leg)We stopped for another break at the shelter before the hostel. We needed something besides peanut butter cheese crackers and Kind bars before heading up the little hill followed by the big hill behind it. This shelter had a picnic table under its own canopy where we dumped our packs. Bob walked over to the shelter to see if anyone was there. There was a guy sitting there who started telling us his sad story. His girlfriend left him and stole all his money, he was trying for to get home and was walking the AT and wasn't sure how he was going to make it, etc. We ended up giving him some of our food. So, if the story was true we helped him out; if it wasn't, well, we just lightened our food bags. We always seen to carry too much food.As soon as we left that shelter, we felt the first raindrops. It wasn't too hard at first, just refreshing. As we started climbing it rained a little harder and we decided to put on our pack covers.  Even this rain was tolerable on our bodies. The problem was the rain was making the already treacherous rocks slippery. This slowed us down more and made us plot out every footfall.We finally arrived at the famous Bears Den hostel and used the hiker code to get in and claim bunks. The code was given to us by the guy who runs it when we emailed and is also listed in the ""FarOut"" app that we use to follow the trail. The interesting part was that the code is three numeric digits, but the numbers on the lock at the door are in roman numerals. We thought nothing of it but it did seem to give some of the younger hikers problems when they came to get in. Guess they're not really a thing that's taught anymore. The only other person here when we arrived was Gratitude. He'd heard us talk about the place and knew we would be here, and he also met someone else on the trail who raved about it. It's a cool old stone building built in the 30's as a getaway for a man and his opera singer wife. It is now owned by the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) and run by the PATC (Potomic Appalachian Trail Club). There are ten bunks and a large, comfortable common room and dining room. It has less of a frat house feel than some of the hostels we've stayed it, which is nice. Even tho the day was close to two hours longer than we had calculated, we arrived with plenty of time to shower before the long milers arrived. They run a deal for hikers that includes a bunk, laundry,  soda, a frozen pizza and a pint of premium ice cream for $35. We were all over that one. Sometimes it's good to be a hiker.","Rod Hallow shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652830,"We slept well last night. There were six in bunks in the room where we stayed and it was quiet.  No one snored. The hostel had coffee and the fixings for pancakes. Those along with left over pizza from last night made a filling breakfast to attack the last few humps of the dreaded roller coaster. We visited with Nash Vegas, a really nice former Air Force mechanic who was in the midling age group (he'll be 48 this year). He's out trying to figure out what to do next, since he has retired from the service. We walked down the drive from Bears Den to get back on the trail and we ran into a guy who had stayed at the previous shelter,  three miles back (we'd gotten a late start). He said he was slow and that we should go ahead of him. We said we were slow, too. He stayed fairly close behind us and we chatted a bit. He had fallen yesterday and had dinged up his arm, which was bleeding from an inadequate band-aid, and had also hit his head in the fall. He had cuts above and below his right eye. He was moving pretty well, considering, and had been pretty lucky. He saw the 2020 tags on our bags and said he'd hiked that year, too. In fact, we reminded him of a couple he'd met in Damascus. We looked at him and then it clicked for all of us. We WERE that couple! He was the guy who had come into the shelter right before Damascus in the pouring rain and had taken the picture of the bear that circled our tent in the rain while we were oblivious inside listening to a podcast. We'd then met up with him in Damascus the following day and had dinner with him. Amazing!! We even have a picture with him from back then. What are the chances of meeting again back on the AT!!We ended up hiking together for most of the day. Bob sets a good pace and according to Spider (aka Steve from Plano, TX) hiking with us thru the tortuous ups and downs of the trail today helped pull him up the hills. Bob sets the pace, we just follow behind, in the zone, and watch the rhythmic, plodding heels of the person ahead of us. We stopped for a packs off lunch break at the top of a hill and chatted for a bit, astounded at the coincidence. We were all heading to the next shelter and wanted to get there before the forecasted rain. About three miles from the shelter, we said we wanted to see the Blackburn Trail Center. So Spider continued on and we went the quarter mile down the hill. It was not a place that catered to hikers but a headquarters and place to stay for the trail maintainers and ridge-runners of the PATC. We deemed it not worth the hike down, except that we filled up on water. We'd heard that the water at the next shelter was also a quarter mile down a hill so now we didn't have to do it twice. As we turned into the shelter, Donna's brother called to confirm plans for spiriting us away to his house for a couple of zeros and a visit starting tomorrow. Yay! At the shelter was another AARP crowd, including Spider and Gratitude, plus two others we just met. All the younger folks who had been at Bears Den, all did the full 23 miles to get into Harpers Ferry. The rain started just as we arrived, but didn't stay long. There was room for us in the shelter so we didn't have to tent in the rain. It's been raining in brief fits for the last two hours but we're safely out of it, staring over the shelter balcony to the damp forest. It's a very nice shelter with a separate, covered picnic table that has a lovely swing that has a perfectly angled back and is high enough to let your tired legs hang as you swing.","Bears Den hostel

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652831,"Just after full dark, a couple of heads popped around the corner of the shelter, saw the six of us all laid out and popped back. It wasn't raining at that point. A thunder boomer rolled in at about 2:00 o'clock. It wasn't close but it poured. We found out that we were the youngest in the shelter by quite a few years. The oldest (not sure if his name is Tennis or Dennis) appears to be in his eighties. We'd heard about him from people earlier and I think he mentioned that he was finally going to get off the trail. He's a small, slightly hunched over man and moves slowly, using only one large wooden staff instead of hiking poles. You just want to help him but dare not because he's out here and he's doing it. He also snored louder than anyone we've encountered yet! The two guys who had stuck their heads in last night ended up cowboy camping (without a tent) under the canopy next to the picnic table. 
The rest of our crew, which included Spider, Gratitude, and Stumples, were up and out just after seven. The rain is done and the skies are clear. We had plenty of time before our meeting time but we'd heard there was a country store at the road gap where we could get a cup of coffee. It was an easy three mile hike down to the road and took less time than we thought. The road was pretty busy but we found the store and got back to the gap just as Donna's brother, Dick, and his friends were getting out of the car. They have decided to meet us and hike the last six miles with us into Harpers Ferry. They also allowed us to put most of our load into their car and slackpack. One of the people along for the hike (another Bob) was a former thu-hiker who had done the trail twice in 1991 and 1993. The second time he'd completed it in three and a half months...to celebrate his 50th birthday! Yikes, that puts us to shame!Harpers Ferry is a nifty little historic town. In fact the other Bob (aka Loco Motive) pointed out what appeared to a long pile of rocks on our hike in. They were actually an old embankment dating from one of the battles of the Civil War! We are complete history nerds so this is great stuff to us. We crossed the bridge high above the Potomic river where we saw several inflatable rafts with folks enjoying the minor rapids. In town, we all had lunch at an outdoor restaurant. We insisted it be outside because even after only being out on the trail for two days since our last clean up, we are conscious of our ""hikerness."" In town we ran into Spider and Gratitude and met Gratitude's wife. We were happy to meet her and she us because we'd all heard about each other.Donna's brother had driven up to spirit us away to his house near DC, which is only about an hour away, for an extra special double zero and family visit with him and his daughter. We picked up our new tent and resupply box, both of which we'd had sent to Harpers Ferry. We now have time and space to get organized for the next leg and send home some things we no longer need.","David Lesser Memorial shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652832,"What a wonderful zero day! Donna's brother, Dick, has a friend, Nomi, who has a pontoon boat and we all enjoyed a beautiful, sunny afternoon of slowly floating around the lake near her house, enjoying a picnic brunch and going for a swim. These special moments are as much part of the adventure as the leaky tent and brutal rocks, and we cherish them.After we got back to Dick's house he let us setup the new tent and the old tent in his backyard. I'm sure all the neighbors were nervously wondering if he was starting a new form of AirBNB. The new tent is a Nemo Dagger Osmos 3P and is very spacious. It's bigger than our old REI 2 Plus and we're excited to try it out. We don't want to get out on the trail never having set it up. That would just be too comical.We wandered into town and enjoyed amazing Asian street food at Hawkers with Dick and his daughter, Jen, and visited into the evening.","

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652937,"Today we had to finish all the town chores we didn't get done yesterday. This was a special double zero because we were with family, and a friend of Bob's is coming out to join us tomorrow.
We sorted out our food, walked the few blocks into town and tried to find what we need in the wilds of an urban grocery store. Dick, after putting up with us and putting us up for two days, graciously drove us back to Harpers Ferry. On our way out of town, we made a stop at REI to replace Bob's headlamp which had become unreliable. In Harpers Ferry we met up with Val, a friend of Bob's from college, who has the silly notion of wanting to do a section of the AT with us. She took the train out from Chicago to meet us and got into town earlier today. She had already met another hiker at the hotel, Parker, and we all walked into town to a restaurant he'd been to the night before. He has been resting for a few days because he's developed a bad blister on the bottom of his heel that makes hiking painful.","

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652938,"We were up for the good breakfast at the hotel. Parker joined us even tho he's not hiking today. His feet are still bothering him and there is a chance of rain this afternoon. We met Willow and a few former hikers who were there to bike the C&O canal path. That trail goes for about 160 miles along the old C&O shipping canal route. We will actually start our hike today by going three miles along it until we turn off and head uphill. 
With our packs on, all three of us lined up for the required before shot. We then headed down the road to pick up the AT. Instead of following the nice smooth road into the old part of town, the AT goes uphill on a steep, rocky path thru the woods. We emerged from the woods in the upper town near the ruins of the Episcopal church, which had been used as a hospital and infirmary during the Civil War and consequently shelled to its current ruined form. Next to it was the oldest surviving house in town, originally built by Harper himself, but never lived in by him. We walked down the hand carved stairs to the lower town and looked back up the street at all the old stone and brick buildings. As we walked toward the old train bridge that would take us across the Potomac and out of town, we found a guide talking to a visiting group of eighth graders about John Brown's raid on the armory. The raid itself, trial and execution of some of the surviving participants is considered to be the first battle of the Civil War. We ran into Goodwater just as we were about to cross the bridge. He'd met his wife in town and had been resting his swollen feet for the last four days (sensing a painful,  swollen feet theme?). The walkway across the bridge has finally been rebuilt after it had been damaged by a train derailment in 2019. After the bridge, we could see the remains of the lock system for the old C&O canal as well as the old canal bed itself. The canal path is very flat, which is surprisingly hard to hike down with our heavy packs. We think it might be that we are not engaging all of our muscles as much to negotiate obstacles so the weight is just sitting on our hips and shoulders. After we turned off the canal path, we started uphill for a thousand feet over two miles. It wasn't too bad, but it was a little tough for Val. Halfway up there was a rocky view point called the Weverton Cliffs. We set down our packs and walked out to see it. We were high above the Shenandoah river and had a really nice view of the river and the green mountains, we had just hiked thru several days before, on the other side. Since it was Sunday, there were quite a few day hikers there, too. When we finally got to the top of the climb, the trail leveled out. The terrain was pretty gentle for the rest of the day, with the exception of another steep, rocky uphill for the last half mile to the shelter. We stopped briefly for a lunch break but just hiked the rest of the day. The air was still and very humid all day so we were sticky, sweaty and hot. Val has now had an introduction to just how uncomfortable and boring our days can sometimes be.The shelter is another old one and a quarter mile downhill off trail. We had cameled up (filled several water bladders) at a state park entrance a half mile back because we'd heard the water was bad here and we're glad we did. The tent sites are much closer to the trail so we found one, setup our tents, cooked dinner, hung our food, and crashed.","Harpers Ferry

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652995,"We went to bed last night without the tent fly because it was so warm and that allows for some breeze. When we do that we position the fly so that it can be pulled over in a rain emergency. We were both awake at 3:30 AM and both saw the flash of lightning in the distance. We both decided it was time and popped out of the tent, pulled up the fly and staked it out. It wasn't raining yet but it would be a good test of our new tent.
At 4:30 AM the skies opened up, with a full light and thunder show. It was so comforting to be dry in a storm that it put us both back to sleep. It was done by about 6:00 and we hurried to pack up everything before any more rain came. We had a longer day ahead of us and wanted to get going early. Poor Val is definitely experiencing all the ""fun"" of the trail. We looked at the profile of the day and decided that the last three miles were going to be the toughest and we would try and plan our packs off breaks accordingly. We started up a climb made into a kind of stairs by a series log water bars (they direct the flow of water off the trail) that Maryland seems to be fond of. It's strange to say ""Maryland"" after being in Virginia for so long. VA claims a quarter of the total mileage of the entire AT, after all. We reached what we thought would be a nice level hike but instead consisted of nothing but rock hopping. Stepping from rock to rock is stressful and tiring because you have to be very particular about each footfall or it might result in a sprained or broken ankle, or worse. Maybe I'm just being and over cautious old person. They say the Pennsylvania rocks begin in Maryland....so, yay.Wildlife sightings for the day included a toad, a woodchuck on a hay bale, and a little fawn left ""hidden"" by its mother three feet from the side of the trail. It stayed all curled up the way it was taught but you could tell it was thinking about fleeing.The big dilemma for the end of the day was whether or not to camel up at the creek at the bottom of our last hill or wait until the shelter where the spring was .4 miles down a steep hill (and then back up, but done without a pack). We decided to camel up and toted way too much water weight up yet another steep, rocky three quarter of a mile hill at the end of a long, hot, sweaty day. I thought Val was going to quit right there, go back to the road we'd just crossed and call for a shuttle. We made it to what the FarOut app comments referred to as the best shelter so far NOBO (northbound). That's a pretty bold claim so we were excited to see it. It is indeed a particularly nice shelter and set of surrounding tent sites. It has two levels, sleeps 12, and has a full overhang for the picnic table area.  Even the floors are finished...you almost feel that you should take your shoes off. We still vote for Bryant Ridge, around mile 763, as the best shelter so far.The tent pads have slotted wooden benches which is great for cooking when the shelter picnic table gets crowded. It never did rain again after the storm this morning but stayed overcast and sometimes foggy all day. We were glad for that because the sun can make post rain that much steamier. At the campsite, tho, the breezes picked up so we were able to dry our tent and clothes from the rain and dampness of the day. The sun even came out and filtered thru the trees, which was a nice end to a tough day. It turned into a beautiful evening at a very nicely maintained campsite in the woods.","Pine Knob shelter 
",Raven Rock shelter ,"Jun 14, Tue",13.10
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653179,"The shelter may not have been our vote for best but is still was very nice. The tenting area was certainly one of the best we've had. I had one of the best night's sleep I've had this time. The temp went down around 65 so we could actually use our sleeping bags, and we had the fly off so the air was fresh. I'm not so sure about Bob, tho. I'm a bit stuffed up and ther may have been snoring involved.
We had a slightly shorter day so we were later leaving the site. We hiked about a mile and a half down the trail and then took a side trail to High Rocks overlook. The description in FarOut was right. There is a road leading to the overlook so the locals had covered it (and I mean COVERED it) with grafity! It was really gross. We'd heard from a local shuttle driver that we've been walking on an underground bunker and that the top of that may be the man-made part of the grafity covered structure. We also learned that we are within a few miles of Camp David. The view of the nearby Maryland farmland and towns was nice, tho. Rocks on the path again. To me, the rock hopping or stepping method is the easiest way down steep, large rocks, but everyone has their method. We finally got down to Pen-Mar park, hoping there would be a soda vending machine....that would be no...but they did have real bathrooms. Shortly after the park we crossed the Mason Dixon line, or the boarder between Pennsylvania and Maryland, or between the North and the South. We are now officially in our seventh state, Pennsylvania. That is also half of all the states on the AT. So far the rocks were worse in Maryland but I'm sure that will change. We looked at the weather report and at the shelter location and decided to push on to the shelter after the one we had originally planned so that we would have a shorter day when rain is a possibility. It's only 3.6 miles further and we all had that much left in the tank. We were all bummed that there was no soda machine at that park, but then we rounded a bend...trail magic!! There were just two beers and an ice tea with fresh mint leaves in it left. Yum! Augie is an AT trail coordinator, which means that he not only checks on the trail but also periodically walks the boarders for the National Park Service to make sure that none of the local properties are encroaching on the AT corridor. We chatted with him for the time it took to down our icy cold beverages and he gave some good intel on the upcoming shelters and water situation. The last few miles of the day were almost all a slightly downhill path, which was great because it was another hot one. All of us were just dripping with sweat.  We'd heard good things about the shelter and it did not disappoint. The designated tent pads all had fine white gravel instead of dirt, there are two smaller shelters (designated ""snoring"" and ""non-snoring""), several picnic tables, one of which was covered, and one of the absolute cleanest actual shelter privies we've seen on the trail. There was actually toilet paper and hand sanitizer! However you do need to bring your headlamp with you because when that door closes, it's dark. There is a fast flowing stream nearby and the first thing we did was to take off our shoes and stand in it splashing water on ourselves to finally cool off. Bliss!We sat at the picnic table and ate our dinner wirh a couple of teachers who had met in Georgia and started hiking together. They had made the mistake of resupply shopping in a Walmart when they were hungry. They had so much food that their food bags wouldn't close well and were trying to either eat more or pawn it off on us. No thanks! We had all read in FarOut that someone had their food bag broken into when it was on the bear poles because the nearby trees were too close, enabling squirrels and the like to make the leap. We all decided that we didn't want to take that chance, and with the added threat of potential rain, we got up on the picnic table and hung our bags from the cross beams of the roof canopy over the table. Problem solved.","Raven Rock shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653180,"The storms that were possible held off last night so we woke up dry. We were up and out early for Val's last day. We started with an uphill climb for about a mile then it was almost all flat or down for the rest of the day...except for what I playfully refer to as ""pokey-uppy things."" These are short usually steep nobs that wake up our legs.
The rocks were pretty prevalent all day. These were particularly rough on Val because she was struggling with her shoes. These shoes were made for walking...not backpacking. At one point, the trail took us over a huge pile of boulders. Divining the best path either thru or over these was challenging not only because of the terrain but we had to look up and locate the next white blaze to even figure out which direction to head.We stopped and sat on some rocks for our final packs off break for the day. We knew we only had about three miles until the road that would take us to the hostel. As usual we could hear the road long before we saw it, and you can't even see it thru the woods until you're almost upon it. It was a two lane with a wide paved shoulder for us to walk along. Thank goodness for that because neither the cars nor the trucks slowed down. We had to hold onto our hats to keep from losing them. 65 South BBQ is about halfway to the hostel so we stopped in for some real food. Cold sodas (darn, no beer) and some delicious BBQ! The brisket melts in your mouth and the sides are all handmade. We all ordered the platter and carried the rest back with us. WE, hungry hikers, could not even finish it all. We continued down the road to the hostel and met the Reverend Beal. It's a church hostel, so no alcohol, smoking, bad language or general misbehaving. That's fine with us. He showed us the lay of the land and back to our bunk room off the dining area where they serve meals. We dumped our bags, chose our bunks and our loaner clothes and, one by one, made a beeline for the shower. After the hot weather we'd experienced, we certainly needed it. We made arrangements with Tina, who helps the reverend run the hostel, to drive us to the Dollar General so that we could get the few things we need to get us to the next stop. We just couldn't bring ourselves to walking the mile and a half it would take to get there. We bought frozen pizzas and a box of ice cream sandwiches so we could just eat dinner when we wanted to. Tina had warned us in her gentle, humorous way that there was going to be a spanish language service in the sanctuary tonight and that the music can get loud. We might want to close our door. She was very sweet in describing them as being more enthusiastic than melodious. She was absolutely correct. The bunks were so comfortable and we were the only three people in the room with six bunks. We have a TV in our room and fell asleep watching old episodes of ""30 Rock.""","Tumbling Run shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653181,"Well, I woke up this morning and the head cold that I'd felt coming on yesterday had arrived in full. We thought it might be better if we stayed an extra day so that I can rest and hopefully throw it off. Luckily the ""hiker box,"" or hiker bookcase in this case, had some cold medicine that I was able to take.
Val had setup a shuttle to take her to the train station in Harrisburg, PA. I think she was happy to be getting back to her normal life, tho she says she enjoyed her time on the trail. She certainly got a good taste of it. Bob made breakfast for us in the hostel kitchen, using eggs that we'd bought last night at the Dollar General and some of the left over brisket from yesterday. We visited with a mother and daughter who had come into the hostel last night. The daughter, Haley, had just graduated from high school and the mom, who had started hiking with her, was now supporting her hike by driving along and meeting her at road crossings, before they all moved from South Carolina to Montana. After Val left, we visited with Tina and Tennessee, who is hiking but also doing a documentary on the people and some of the social traditions of the trail. 
Outside on the hostel grounds is a small open structure with a few hanging chairs. The breeze kept the temps down and the bugs away so we sat out there for a while this afternoon. We chatted with a German woman named Lydia, who had stayed at the previous shelter with us. Among other things, we talked about what we wanted from the trail. The trail wasn't turning out to be what she had expected and she was going to make it to Hamburg, PA and then look to head to Canada to visit friends. She is currently from Hamburg, Germany, but had grown up in the former East Berlin, altho she was only five when the wall fell.Tonight there was a dinner put on by the Reverend, made from some of the food that they receive in donations. Anyone is welcome, including their congregation and the hiker community. The generosity of these small communities is truly inspiring.  Tonight there were about eight hikers and maybe be a dozen others enjoying the meal. After dinner they showed a movie on a screen in the sanctuary, but ""Narnia"" didn't sound inviting, tho Bob popped in for a bit.The hostel offers a private room and it ends up being the same price for the two of us as bunks. Because I wasn't feeling well we decided this option might work better for us. It worked out well because several more people showed up tonight.","

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653252,"What a beautiful day! I think this might be one of the most beautiful days of hiking we have had on the trail. We started the day at 62 degrees and it never got warmer than 70. The breeze was constant at 5-10 mph up in the tree tops and occasionally down at our level. Sometimes as we walked we heard the eerie moan of tree rubbing against tree. It's interesting how many different tones can come from trees rubbing together. Aside from the first steep climb of the day right off the bat, most of the day was smooth sailing. The inclines were gentle and mostly flat (except for a couple of quick ups and downs). 
At the hostel this morning, the reverend cooked eggs and pancakes for all the hikers.  He even had OJ, which was just what my throat needed. My cold is not completely gone, and my voice is bearly a squeak, but it's time to hike. With only 10 miles to do today, we left at a leisurely 8:30. We officially met Toad, Press and Bravo this morning at breakfast. We'll probably see them again tomorrow at Pine Grove Furnace for the half gallon challenge. Since we are fast approaching the official halfway point in the trail, there is this thing called the ""half gallon challenge"" in which you must consume a half gallon of ice cream. For most thru-hikers, ""hiker hunger"" is fully underway so this seems like a reasonable thing. We have absolutely no intention of even attempting it. We've trying to start a new tradition, ""a burger and two pints."" It would consist of a hamburger, a pint of beer and a pint of ice cream.The first shelter we came to was one we had been hearing about. It was actually landscaped! There were hanging flower baskets, a swing, a sundial, games to play, two shelters and two covered picnic tables. The three people listed as the maintainers take obvious pride in their shelter. It's fun to see the individualism. As we sat there, a fairly large group of hikers showed up. They turned out to be a local ""Meetup"" group hiking a seven mile loop of trails. We chatted with them for a bit and some seemed fascinated by the idea of backpacking for weeks and months on end. The forest today varied from ethereal white pines to wide open areas where a blight has wiped out most of the chestnut oaks, leaving the dead trunks standing stark. The undergrowth along the sides of much of the trail today looked almost as if it had been planted by a landscaper, it was so attractive. Long lengths of the actual trail were covered in white pine needles which were like cushions under our feet after the rocks.We got to the shelter early enough that it felt like a nearo. We set up our tent along the little stream and chatted for a while with Toad, Press and Holiday when they stopped in later for a break. They decided to continue on to the next shelter six miles ahead but we're keeping our day short so that I can rest a little more and shake this cold. A troup of boyscouts arrived later as we were starting to set up our early dinner. We had passed them in the morning. It took them a bit to get their sites setup and in the meantime several people showed up with trail magic. They had Gatorade and, wonder of wonders, several beers! After five days from Harpers Ferry, no beer at the BBQ place and two nights at the church shelter, we were more than ready to relieve them of the burden of carrying that extra weight back to their car. We each took two. Hey, we were done for the day and at the shelter. We chatted we a couple and their friend who were out for the weekend with their sons, who were in their early 20's. They told us about how they are planning to do the John Muir trail in California with the help of their sons hiking in some of their resupply. What a great idea! We just need to hire sherpas instead of carrying 100 miles worth of food for each leg of that trail.","Thru It All hostel - Fayetteville, PA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653253,"Last night was a chilly one. We had no signal, but the last weather report for the shelter showed that it was going to get down to the low 50's and we're pretty sure it did. We'd sent home most of the few cold weather things we'd brought but luckily Bob had kept his silk sleeping bag liner. Since he's using a quilt, which doesn't wrap all the way around (handy on hot nights) the liner was able to keep him warm. My sleeping bag is supposedly rated to 35 (HA!) but with my rain jacket across my legs and both of us wearing our fleece and socks we were able to sleep. This is not a complaint! It has been so hot that this was a delightful change.We were up and out by 7:30 and the terrain was so nice that we made the shelter 6.2 miles ahead in two and a half hours. That's 30 minutes better than our average two mph speed. We had a snack with Tennessee and the daughter from the hostel. There were also two older women who were out for an overnight and had stayed at the shelter. One had never backpackers before and the other hadn't done it in years. I give them both a lot of credit for being out here.We continued on to Pine Grove Furnace State park and the Ironmaster's mansion hostel. The hostel is a mansion built in 1815 by the son of one of the first operators of Pine Grove furnace Iron smelting facility. We walked past it to the big attraction, the half gallon challenge! The half gallon challenge is in honor of reaching the halfway point on the AT, which we did today. Hikers (because who else who do something so silly) are challenged to eat a half gallon of ice cream. No time limit, just eat that much. They have to pay for their own ice cream and the reward is an old fashioned tiny wooden flat ice cream spoon like you used to get with the little cups of ice cream with the lid you pulled off. It's poorly stamped with ""I completed the half gallon challenge."" Ridiculous! Yet hikers with their ""hiker huner"" come here to do it and then sit wrapped in their puffy because they got so cold eating that much ice cream. Press completed it. Tennessee barely made it and felt sick afterwards, and poor Haley (the new high school grad being supported by her mother) got within about three ounces before she baled.We walked up the hill to check into the hostel but couldn't find anyone around. It's kind of a loosey-goosey operation. This one falls more into the marginal frat house column of hostels. The woman running it seems overwhelmed. We grabbed our bed sheets and chose our bunks. The mattresses are pretty comfy, but the showers are terrible. We headed back down the hill to the general store again for some of the best burgers we've had on the trail. No beer because it's a state park but we did get small cups of ice cream. Then we walked over to the AT museum, housed in one of the old stone buildings that was part of the iron works. It shows the history of the AT from its inception with Benton McKaye to the first people who mapped it out and actually walked it, to how it has evolves. They even have a pair of Grandma Gatewood's shoes and one of her homemade knapsacks. When you visit the ATC office in Harpers Ferry, they take your picture for their records. Here at the museum Bob was able to find his picture from his 1999 thru-hiker attempt. Who is that young guy!","Birch Run shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653392,"Breakfast was what we have come to expect at hostels, pancakes. This time they had blueberry yogurt, too, which we appreciated. Tennessee and one of the other guys we met in our bunk room, R-dot, were at breakfast, too, and we may see them again at the shelter we're going to. We got a good start and found the mom (shame on us! we realized that we don't know her name) who had camped with her van in the park. Haley, her daughter, was still recovering from her half gallon attempt yesterday.On our way out, we passed a recreational lake that used to be a quarry, then we headed up. It was a fairly normal day, nothing special, the usual rocks. We sometimes get into almost a trance just looking for the next footfall. It's too bad because we know we're missing some animals, especially in the early morning when they are more likely to be out and about. It's a necessity, tho, if we're going to keep our footing. Ironically, we were talking about falling. One of the younger, faster hikers said he falls every day, and we were feeling pretty good about our relatively moderate pace. Not five minutes later I tripped and went face first. Luckily Bob broke some of my fall but I ended up on the ground. I only have a slight scrape and maybe a bruise. Long pants saved my legs. It does shake you up...shakes your confidence a bit.We had looked at the weather and decided that because it was going to be cooler today that we'd switch our long day from tomorrow to today. That would save the open farm fields and potentially hot sun for the shorter day. We stopped at a stream to get more water and have a packs off rest. R-dot showed up, too. He's headed for the same shelter. The day had been going just fine. We had four miles left to go and a couple more climbs. We'll, the local trail club decided to have some fun with us by routing the trail not around the giant boulders at the top of the climb but thru them. This might have been fun if we'd been fresh and didn't have full packs on. But at the end of a long hard day we were tired and didn't have much strength left in our legs. It was a lot harder than it should have been and not as much fun as I'm sure the trail club had intended. Then they did it again on the next rise. Not funny Cumberland Valley trail club!It was after 5:00, which is late for us, and the last mile to the shelter took forever. We were exhausted. The shelter was another little uphill but we finally made it. The tent sites near the shelter are not the most level but we grabbed one. Someone told us that they were better and flatter down the hill where the water source is, but we did not have the energy to move our tent. I'm sure we'll regret that decision. We got our water (R-dot was camped down on one of the good sites), made our dinner and fell into our tent. There was a family with two kids in the shelter but we were too tired to visit with them very much.","Ironmasters hostel - Pine Grove Furnace State Park, PA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653393,"We both woke up in the middle of the night as Bob got out of the tent. We heard rustling footsteps that ran away when they heard Bob and then came slowly back after he got back in the tent. I lay there listening to the footsteps thinking...bear or deer? Did I leave the Halls lozenges in my backpack not the food bag stored in the bear box? Those are the steps of a larger animal, not a squirrel or raccoon. Are those the steps of a longer legged animal like a deer....like Bob sounded when he left the tent? I think so.... I took off the lock on my headlamp and listened to the footsteps move around near us. Then I talked myself out of the fear and my heart finally slowed down. Most likely just a deer.Our tent was on a slightly tilted surface so we had both slid to the end of the tent by morning. We were determined to get up and out early to miss the heat of the day across the upcoming farm fields. We quietly chatted with another older thru hiker at the picnic table near the shelter because the family was still asleep inside. He said he had also learned to slow down and enjoy the hike, and completely agreed with us that the rock obstacle course we went thru yesterday was completely unnecessary and a little competition for the hardest section from the local trail club. We were back on the trail by 6:45 AM. Not as early as we'd hoped but not bad. It is, after all, the solstice so it was light early. The trail went up then down and over one more hill over the next three and a half miles before we hit the town of Boiling Springs. The ATC off was closed so we just sat on the swing for a packs off break. There is an outfitter is practically on the trail and a lot of hikers seem to be stopping there. We didn't need anything so we gave it a pass. We found out later that there was a good breakfast place right down the street. We decided to keep going because the profile showed a flat hike into Carlisle. This part of Pennsylvania on the AT is thru farm fields. Just before Boiling Springs, we literally walked out of the woods and down the narrow strip of land between farm fields reserved for the AT corridor. It's a very unique section of the trail. We walked between fields, then sometimes turn a squared off corner around another field. Sometimes we walked down a wider tree covered wind break fields. It was an overcast day so we weren't as worried about the blazing sun in the open areas. Very often in the woods we came across very old, moss covered stone walls, most likely to separate farmers properties over the past several hundred years. It's a cool little piece of history. We even found an old cemetery surrounded by a rickety iron fence with dates as far back as 1804. We made good time and covered almost six miles before our next packs off break. Ray, who we had spoken to at breakfast, passed us near what we think may have been a gun range. That is very disconcerting to hear when you are walking thru the woods.As we got near to Carlisle, we could hear a highway. Next thing we knew we were walking over a road bridge over the Pennsylvania turnpike. Such a strange mix of AT terrain today. We crossed a pedestrian bridge high over the last busy road and searched for a way to get back down to it. The Quality Inn was about a half mile down that road. The area is a big truck stop, and what appears to be a truck driver training area so there are lots of semi's roaring down the road next to us as we walk...feeling very small and vulnerable. The Quality Inn came highly recommended by hikers in FarOut with a good hiker rate. It does not disappoint. It's amazing that we can spend the same amount for two of us in  bunks at a hostel where the showers don't work, or a hotel that caters to hikers with wonderful showers, comfy beds and laundry...not to mention cable TV. That's the trail. There is a 24 hour diner right next door to the hotel and a Sheetz to do some small resupply. That's all we need. We also ran into Lydia from Germany. She has decided to leave the trail, maybe go to New York city, then back to Europe.","Alec Kennedy shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653506,"We slept well in a comfy bed last night. We debated if we wanted to do the hotel breakfast or go over to the diner and get a really good meal. We decided to check out the hotel because we thought we'd see other hikers and we should be sociable. No hikers to start but then R-dot came and sat with us. We chatted for a while and he said we'd convinced him to do the hotel breakfast too instead of going to the diner...we didn't really persuade as much as have a nice conversation. Hotel waffles and a tiny yogurt is not the most sustainable trail breakfast but at least they had OJ. He's from central Virginia, not too far from where we got on this year at Bryant Ridge. Lydia also joined us. She was done with the trail. Her shuttle driver was picking her up this morning to take her to, we think, Hamburg, PA.After saying ""see ya down the trail,"" we walked back down the very busy four lane, truck-heavy road and up the little side trail. There was so much trash along the road that it saddened us. It was all we could do not to pick some of it up. We try to pick up the few pieces we see along the trail and carry it out. We were a little worried about some rain storms that were floating around us. The weather report kept changing and pushing the rain further and further out. Even tho we had gotten a late start, it was starting to look like we could get to the shelter and maybe get a spot inside before the storm came in. We calculated the distance we planned to go, and the number of people who passed us and the likelihood that they were going to ""our"" shelter or would go past it. We had some more farm fields today, which helped with our average speed. We knew that we had a big climb near the end and stopped for water at the bottom. While we were there, a younger couple passed and asked us how far it was to Duncannon. We told them we thought it was about 14 miles or so. They looked surprised and said they thought it was only seven or so and that they were trying to make the Wednesday night free spaghetti dinner at the church before it ended at seven. We looked at FarOut and realized that we had miscalculated the mileage and that there was only another four miles into town after our planned shelter, not eleven. Yay for them, but oops for us. Drat. That means we either bite the bullet and do the 17 (which would be the longest day yet) or we have a ridiculously short day tomorrow and a nearo. Yeah, we picked option two.The climb was not too steep but the rocks were getting worse. They just slow us down to have to pick around every one of them. What looked on the map to be a nice flat plateau turns out to be just more rocks. We had been hearing thunder around us since about one o'clock but now nearing 4:30 and 5:00 it had disappeared and we were starting to get some sun streaming in from the west. At the shelter it was .2 off the trail, downhill. When we reached it we were alone. We had gotten so used to having people around that it can be a little creepy when you're alone in the woods. That wasn't made any easier by a note that someone had written in the shelter log book reminding folks that two people had been murdered here in 1990. The old shelter had been torn down and this ""new"" one built in 2002, but that doesn't help the imagination.  Bob went down the long walk to get water and I setup our bedding on the bunks that this shelter has. We had eaten and were just about ready for bed when two guys showed up after a 26 mile day, Rawhide and Pace. Rawhide is a retired SeaBee doing the trail to help PTSD and suicide awareness among veterans. He's been meeting up with vets and CB's specifically along the trail.","Quality Inn, Carlisle, PA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653569,"We got breakfast across the street from the hostel at Goodies diner with Jon's Dad(that's his trail name) who is southbound doing a section and meeting up with friends in Pine Grove Furnace. There were at least six other hikers there, too, filling almost every booth. I had to have some scrapple with breakfast because we are in Pennsylvania. I have finally realized that I eat scrapple (with maple syrup because that's the Philly way) because it is a taste memory from my childhood outside Philadelphia and this corner of Pennsylvania is the only place you can get the stuff. I think I'm good for a while. 
Another late start as we walked down the main street out of Duncannon. We crossed two concrete road bridges on the way out of town, built in 1922 & 1925. By the looks of one crossing the Juanita river, we hoped it had been inspected recently because it seemed a little worse for wear. (We found out later that the bridge is actually condemned but the whole town still uses it!) The bridge crossing the Susquehanna river was a very long divided four lane. The pedestrian lane for hikers was separated from the cars by a concrete barrier but the river side was protected by a metal barrier but much more open. We both found it to be nerve-wracking. At the end we walked down the side of the off ramp. Bob looked down toward the river and we saw a bald eagle on the river bank eating its catch. We crossed another road and a railroad track before we started the climb to the ridge. It was steep, with switchbacks and all rocks. When we reached the ridgeline, the rocks continued. These were the big rocks that took all your time and attention to navigate. We found ourselves pausing periodically to take a deep breath before continuing. Is this what the Pennsylvania rocks are supposed to be? It's exhausting and very slow going. Bob misstepped and fell forward with is leg caught between two large rocks. His leg got pretty scraped up and there may have been some loud, disparaging remarks made about the local trail club and Pennsylvania in general. We sat for a minute and got him cleaned up. Aside from the rocks being tough to navigate, we were in a cloud so the humidity was almost 100% and it made the rocks and leaves slippery. Not a good combination. We kept going for a long three hours before a break because we couldn't find a place to stop. We finally got our packs off and sat on some logs at the entrance to a shelter side trail to get something to eat. We ran into French Fry and Muse, who stopped to get water because there are few places to get water in this area. After that thr trail improved to the rocks we have become used to. About three miles before our shelter we came to a parking area and saw Potato Chip and Siesta (the teachers) with Pat & Lenny, who were handing out cold drinks and snacks. Trail magic! It had been so hot and humid, and the sun was just beginning to come out so the cold drinks were perfect. We chatted with them and they gave us intel about the upcoming stretch. They even filled our water bottles and one of our 3L Cnoc water bladders because they said the water at the shelter was down 300 stone steps and we shouldn't have to do that. Bless them!The last three miles were good terrain, which was good because we were carrying 12 pounds of extra water between us. The shelter is a very nice, large one. We found Time Crunch already tented and napping so we setup near her. In the shelter, we were just about to cook dinner when we heard a voice asking if anyone was here and were we thirsty or hungry. I had just read several comments in the shelter log book about a guy name Magic Jim and here he was. He is a local guy who brings trail magic to a few shelters in the evening and loves to talk to thru-hikers about their stories.  He is thinking about doing a thru himself. He brought cold Dr. Pepper, chips, and made us what he calls mountain pies in sandwich irons over a fire. It was amazing!! I rousted Time Crunch, then R-dot came in exhausted from his day and was almost overcome by how special this was after he'd had such a rough day. Magic Jim showed us pictures of his previous trail magic and we all recognized most of the hikers in them. We chatted and drank and had a great time before he packed up and we all said goodbye as the sun was setting. The trail is an amazing and surprising place.","Kind of Outdoorsy hostel, Duncannon, PA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653703,"We slept with the tent fly off again last night. We could see stars thru the trees, and fireflies flashing everywhere around us. It was really beautiful. The temperature was even cool enough to be inside our bags.
We were up at six and chatted with R-dot while we ate breakfast and he packed up in the shelter. We got out before him at 7:30, but knew we'd see him. He's planning a 17 mile day and ours is only 13. The terrain was pretty good all day. We stopped briefly because we had forgotten to order Bob's replacement shoes. His soles are pretty worn and we keep hearing that the worst Pennsylvania rocks are yet to come. We're planning to zero in a few days and were able to have them sent to the place we're staying. Ah, the beauty of a smartphone with a signal. R-dot passed us at our break. The heat is rising and it supposed to be one of the warmest days yet at almost 90. Water is becoming more scarce so we have to plan our days and our campsites accordingly. We ran into a ridge runner who told us that the spring was running well about 5.5 from the shelter, just before the road so we stopped there and refilled. We headed on down to the road. It's a hot, sunny Saturday and we live in hope that there might be....trail magic! Three people had come, setup a grill and coolers, and were serving hot dogs  and hamburgers with all the fixings, plus cold sodas and watermelon. R-dot, Potato Chip and Siesta were all there, plus a few others we didn't know. We couldn't believe our luck. This was the third trail magic in two days! We sat and visited for a while and got the information on the next bit of trail from one of the trail angels, who runs on most of the trails in the area so he knows them well. He told us the next section was a thousand foot incline over three miles, which was doable, and the rocks were the worst at the start. This all proved true. We caught up to Potato Chip and Siesta,  who had left earlier, at a nice rest area. It was next to a nice stream, and we should have filtered water from there. We told them we were only going to a campsite that was 3.5 miles further along and we were pretty sure there was water there. Well, we were wrong.  So here we all sat at 5:30 at a nice campsite with less than a litre of water each without the energy to hike the four miles further to the next shelter, which would have taken us about two hours. That much water was about enough to get us thru dinner and maybe an electrolyte drink. We will have to stop in the morning at either a possible water source a mile further or go all the way to the shelter, which is reported to flowing well. Water anxiety is a thing out here and you really have to plan your days and stops accordingly.","Peter Mountain shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653704,"We heard faint music coming from a distance last night, and then someone played Taps on a flute over a microphone. This was all followed by a pack of coyotes yapping at each other. 
We got up and out to find the water source a mile or so up. It was a decent source so we dropped our packs, used our cooking pot to scoop and fill our Cnoc to filter into our bottles and bladder. About three more miles ahead was the shelter we should have pushed for last night. We stopped there for a break. We were tossing around the idea of doing a longer day to get to the next shelter  because rain is due this afternoon. We're both mentally planning our day for the further point because it's all about the mental game.We came across warning signs that there was beaver activity ahead and the was a blue blaze trail around it. Comments in the FarOut app said it was navigable so we set out. It was a very swampy area, but there were large logs and branches placed across the wettest areas. Some logs were only floating and we didn't find that out until we tried to put our foot on them. Gotta find another. Our poles sank into the water looking for a solid spot to catch, and at one point we had to hug a tree for balance as we stepped around it on logs. We both made it with only one foot each partially wet. A little while further, we had to perform a similar balancing act but much higher over a fast flowing stream. We found a parking area for our packs off lunch break. Just as we were packed up and ready to leave, a SUV pulled up and someone shouted our trail names out the door. It was Lenny and Pat from yesterday's trail magic! They were there to meet Potato Chip and Siesta with Wendy's take out. They had some cold sodas and snacks for us and we chatted with them until Potato Chip and Siesta arrived. Then we had to take off if we were going to get to the shelter. We crossed the Waterville iron bridge, built in 1890, which is famous in this area (Swatara Gap). The trail then took us under an elevated and divided Interstate 81. It's a strange experience hiking under the structure of a huge highway. The folks flying past on it have no clue that there are these strange people called backpackers hiking underneath them who they can't even see.Back up a steep hill into the woods and the rocks started. It was on and off all the rest of the afternoon until we reached the shelter. We would go from a decent path with a only few rocks to a talus field with huge rocks, half of which moved when you stepped on them. One false move and you might get an adventure ending injury. I know Pennsylvania is known for it's rocks on trail but it certainly seems like trail clubs go out of their way to take us over areas so rocky that there is now actual ground to walk on....only rocks. We did not have kind words about the PA section of the AT...and we said them loudly.We had now started chasing the weather as well as dodging the rocks. A storm was coming in and the rocks were slowing our progress. It was also one of the hottest and most humid days so far and that is draining. We were already looking at doing the longest day we had ever done, and everything else was just compounding the pain. Potato Chip and Siesta passed us on their way to the same shelter. It had finally started to rain and they were on a mission. We welcomed the rain to start because it cooled us down, but then it started to rain harder and the rocks got slippery, which slowed us down even more. We were exhausted, sore, soaking wet and generally not in good moods when we finally arrived at the shelter a little after 7:00. We were all so tired that we could barely get ourselves together enough to make dinner and setup our sleeping arrangements. It was dark from the storm, which was now in full swing, and dark in the shelter so we were all tripping over each other with our headlamps on, but we were all happy to be in the shelter, dry, and out of the rain. A guy named Ryan from Maine was there when we got there. He'd beat the rain. He's doing a long section, too,up to Bear Mountain in NY. He showed us a picture of his camp (cabin) in Maine that faces Katadyn. Wow! He ended up going upstairs in the shelter (yes, it is that large) for more space. That means that Bob was stuck on thr ground floor with four women. Funny...usually it's me with a bunch of guys.","Yellow Springs campsite

We all watched the weather on our phones and tried to figure out the best window to leave. Ryan left first, but Potato Chip, Siesta and the two of us stuck around until late morning. We knew we had planned a short day of less than 10 miles and had time to delay. 
We walked four miles down to the 501 shelter near the road. It's a different kind of shelter because it is fully enclosed, has 12 bunks and a huge picnic table inside. There is even a caretaker's house, which is not currently in use, that has outlets to charge things. It's also a place when people often call the local pizza place and get delivery. That sounded like a great idea to us so we started calling. It's Monday so half the places we're closed, then it was almost 1:30 so the lunch time delivery drivers had left until dinner. Bummer! We now had to seriously dial back our lunch expectations to what was remaining in our food bags. The day varied from reasonable path to ridiculous rocks. Sometimes it feels like they backed up and enormous truck and poured the largest rocks they could find out to create the trail and said ""there, that should mess up their feet for a while."" Sometimes the rocks are large, sometimes they are small little ankle biters. Siesta described them as being like sharks teeth because so many are pointy and stick out of the trail like sharks teeth. Our feet by the end of the day are just sore from trying to walk across all the uneven edges. It's especially tiring when there isn't even any dirt between the stones and we are just walking across pointy stones. OK, I'm whining. The sun was out so we had a nice view of the farms below us from one of the rock outcrops. In the afternoon, we crossed the northbound 1,200 mile mark for the AT! For us this trip, it's 435 in six and a half weeks.  We ran into Siesta and Potato Chip and all had to pose for our pictures. Because we had gotten such a late start the shadows were starting to get long when we finally found our campsite. Apparently there used to be a shelter here but all that remained was a couple of tent pads and space for a few other tents. Luckily we got one of the tent pads. It was right next to a creek so we had plenty of water to try and clean up a little before dinner.","William Penn shelter

Morning was somewhat leisurely for us because we have another less than 10 mile day. Potato Chip and Siesta were heading into town to zero at the same place we are going tomorrow. Except for a relatively short uphill, today's terrain was almost flat. Again it varied between reasonable and rocks, but not the truly wicked rocks we've had recently. The weather was barely in the 70's and sunny, which is absolutely perfect for backpacking.  I think it might be the nicest and easiest day we've had so far on this stretch. We reached the shelter by 1:30, which was a fair walk off trail. We had looked at the tenting areas between us and Port Clinton to maybe lengthen today and shorten tomorrow but they all read as being not great and without water, so we decided to just stay at this shelter. It's a pretty spot to camp and we were the only people here until almost 6:00, then two guys we hadn't met showed up. There are lots of tent spots and another picnic table set further into the woods so they went over there. We were able to stream our favorite radio station for a bit while we made dinner and then just relaxed for the evening. We should get into town by midday tomorrow to meet our shuttle driver and get to our highly anticipated bed and breakfast zero at the Bismarck in Hamburg, PA.

We got up early and were out of the shelter  by 6:30. We'd heard that the rocks heading into Port Clinton were pretty bad and the map shows a steep decline. We wanted to make sure that we had plenty of time to take our time. The trail was rockier today with fewer of the smoother sections we've had recently. This early in the morning the angle of the sun is low and leaves more shadows on the rocks which makes seeing them all more difficult. Time Crunch had beaten us out of camp and three of the other hikers all passed us within the first hour and a half. We're just amazed how fast they are able to go.As with most towns along the trail, there is a descent off of a ridge to get there. This descent started gradually but then the angle picked up. Some stone steps appeared to try and make the way easier, but toward the end, the descent was getting a little scary. It wasn't an open cliff edge but if you missed a step you would certainly take a tumble either straight down the trail in front of you or to the side into the rocks and trees. The final descent was really precarious. We had to extend our trekking poles way down and out in front of us to hold our balance and support us as we stepped down hike stone steps and relieve our knees. What a relief to get down safely! At the bottom we landed in the rail yard of Port Clinton and had to cross over several sets of train tracks. This was after we looked around to try and find a blaze to figure out which direction we were supposed to head. We were an hour and a half early for our shuttle pickup so we decided to visit the barber we had heard about and get Bob's hair cut. He was starting to get a little shaggy. We found it on the map and walked to the other side of town. The walk took us about 15 minutes....Port Clinton is very small.  The Port Clinton barber shop and Antiques and Collectibles is a very unique establishment. It is a typical, old-timey, small town barber shop with it's regulars (mostly retired men at 11:30 on a random Wednesday). They are also hiker friendly and are listed on FarOut and in the AWOL guide....even have an AT stamp. Bob waited his turn, then sat in the chair and got the shortest haircut of his life! I think there was only one way they cut hair there. Ah, well. It's good for this heat. Eddie, our shuttle driver, met us there and drove us to the B&B.What a beautiful place! It came highly recommended on FarOut and it doesn't disappoint. The house itself was built in about 1908 and has been beautifully kept up. There are stained glass windows, molded plaster ceilings, beautiful woodwork  and tile work. One of the coolest things is the only other people staying are folks we know....Potato Chip, Siesta and R-dot.After we got cleaned up, Bob and I walked to a local pizza place to get some lunch. Later in the evening, we all walked down to Backwoods Brothers Authentic Texas Cuisine. It was really good BBQ. R-dot is from Virginia and even he approved. The owner's son, the chef, had gone to culinary school and spent time in Texas honing his BBQ skills.","Eagle's Nest shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654022,"It was hard to get up and leave this morning. We were the only guests yesterday  and last night so we had the place to ourselves. Very odd to be batting around and sleeping in an Edwardian mansion on a day off from hiking the trail. Breakfast was delicious again and our shuttle driver, Eddie, picked us up afterwards. Bob's old shoes had been ceremoniously thrown out and he headed out the door in his new mango colored ones. 
The uphill back out of Port Clinton was rocky but not quite as bad as we'd had before. There were two view locations on today's hike, the Pinnacle and the Pulpit. We'd received intel from a southbound hiker that the rocks were bad between the two.We watched the weather forecast most of the day and we could hear thunder in the distance starting at about 2:00. We reached the Pinnacle at about 4:00 and started to feel sprinkles. We threw on our pack covers,  but not our rain gear. It had been so hot all day that we were looking forward to a cooling shower. Well, the cooling shower lasted for an hour and we were soaked to the skin, but it did feel pretty good. The hike down was a very long forest road walk. We were very happy that the rain didn't come while we were navigating the boulders and rocks. The Eckville shelter is unique because there is a caretaker's house and an outdoor shower and flush toilet instead of a privy. When we got there the shelter was full of a group hiking together. We were fine with tenting. Across the street there were already about ten tents setup, but room for more. After we setup, we got our turn at the picnic table for dinner. We were about to start cooking when a car pulled up and the driver announced that he had pizza for hikers! Pizza beats ramen any day of the week. Apparently a friend of the guy with the pizzas is currently hiking the PCT (Pacific Coast Trail) and told him that a group of his friends was staying there and sent money to buy pizzas for the shelter. Lucky us! We chatted with them briefly but then made a quiet exit. We felt like we were putting a ""mom & dad"" vibe on their jam.When we got into our tent, there were already eight tents setup and we heard more come in at almost dark.","The Bismarck B&B, Hamburg, PA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654023,"It only rained a little more early this morning. We'd heard several more people come in last night after we were in our tent, and Bob counted four new tents for a grand total of fifteen. That's more tents than we'd ever seen set at a shelter! 
The most fun thing to do after hiking in a rain storm the previous day is to put on those same wet clothes. Wet, stinky shoes and socks are the best. Your instinct is to put on dry socks, but then you have two pairs of wet socks and nothing to keep your feet warm if the next night gets cold. We packed up our wet tent and the rest of our stuff, then filled our water from the spigot at the caretaker's house. As soon as I put my pack on I realized that I had not completely closed the cover on my water bladder and it leaked water all over inside my pack and was dripping out of the bottom. Crap!!We hiked the road about a tenth of a mile back to the trailhead. I'd heard from Potato Chip that today was going to be bad. The rocks just went on and on. They'd fool you by giving you a stretch with just a few, then hit you with giant boulders to cross. In addition, there were lots of large, blown down trees which hadn't been cut out so we had to crawl over them. These trail maintainers are not getting the high marks that earlier ones have received. In fact, with my bucket hat pulled down low over my eyes to keep the gnats and mosquitos away and my head looking down, I walked headfirst into a slanted blow down without seeing it. That was the final straw for me today. After the rain, the water, the rocks, the heat and humidity, then walking into a tree, I had a little tiny breakdown. Bob was very understanding. When we finally made to the Allentown shelter for a break after the rocks were over for the day, we texted the hostel four miles up and got a double bunk for the night. All we had to do was walk down an old road for two more hours and we were home free. Yardsale, who runs the Lookout hostel is great. She came recommended by the woman who ran the Kind of Outdoorsy hostel. The people who run hostels usually know each other and share both tips and information. The Lookout has and amazing view of the valley and farms below and they were having a hiker picnic tonight. They grilled burgers and dogs, plus lots of fruit,  salads, fixings and desserts. They have had some plumbing issues and have had trouble getting someone to come and fix them, but Yardsale has rigged a fantastic shower in the garage. Hostels are interesting places and when you come out of the woods feeling miserable, a garage shower and clean loaner clothes (while you do laundry) are like a little bit of heaven. It was a bright, sunny afternoon so we were able to lay out all of our wet gear, tent and packs. It was such hot sun that everything dried almost instantly. The sunshine helps a little with the gear stink, too.","Eckville shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654114,"Comfy night last night. They had a queen sized bunk for us which was unusually nice. We got up this morning and we able to microwave frozen breakfast sandwiches. They are a much appreciated break from Gatorade protein bars or, my new favorite, king size Payday bars, for breakfast.We walked back up the busy road and back into the woods. It was a longer day but the profile looked pretty flat. One of today's rock scrambles had the ominous name of the Knifes Edge. It was exactly how it sounds. We were prevented from audibly expressing our true feelings for this particular rock scramble by the presence of a father, his seven and a half year old daughter and her younger sister. They had all been out for an overnight camping trip. The girls were as sweet as could be telling us about the wild blueberries and that we should try them, all the while scrambling over the rocks, unencumbered by packs, with complete ease. I had to smile when the seven year old told me that if she can do it, I can do it. That kind of energy is so infectious that I think it did truly help us. We used all of our latent rock climbing skills to keep ourselves from harm. We had to let our hiking poles dangle sometimes so that we could use our hands to grab onto certain rocks. We've seen a lot of people today passing us slackpacking. Based on the rocks we just crossed, today would have been a good day to do that.When I was a child, we used to drive thru the Lehigh tunnel on our way to visit my grandparents in New York state. Today, we had the very odd sensation of walking over that tunnel along the ridge. We could hear the cars in the distance entering the tunnel. I wonder if anyone passing beneath us has any clue that above them is a long trail along which a few thousand people hike every year. Just after that, we found a tent site where we stopped for a packs off break. Someone had made much better use of some rocks by creating some seats with backs on them.Further on, we crossed a power cut with some strange orange netting topped with mulch. Neither of us had ever seen anything like this and couldn't figure out the purpose. Bob's first steps on the Appalachian Trail were with the boy scouts back in the early 1970's, when he lived in Allentown, PA (very close to here) The shelter he remembers visiting was the Bake Oven Knob shelter, so of course we had to stop and see it. It's one of the very small, older shelters. I don't think it's changed much in the last 50 years.Our last downhill toward town went across semi open land that didn't feel like north eastern Pennsylvania, but more like arid Colorado. In the town of Palmerton, a zinc smelter had operated for 80 years and the emissions has done a lot of damage to the local mountainsides. At the bottom of the trail, we had to cross the Lehigh river bridge but discovered there was no real way to walk into Palmerton along a very busy road, and no shuttle drivers listed so we decided to Uber into town. Gotta love technology! It felt strange and somehow wrong but we did it anyway. Bert's steakhouse (there is a hostel connected with it) was closed for 4th of July so we called the number on door for hikers and the owner walked us thru where to find the bathroom and bunk room around the back. After we chose our bunks, we walked down the street to resupply a few things and find dinner. Because it's fourth of July weekend, and a Sunday night, most of the restaurants had closed early or were about to close. We found some beer at a ""beer store"" (again, unique Pennsylvania liquor laws) and ended up getting take-out Chinese food because it was the only place open. Back at the hostel, we were the only ones there so we relaxed and ate our dinner while we watched old Seinfeld DVD's. Strange end to another long rocky day.","Lookout hostel

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654115,"We were alone last night. We Ubered back to the trail after a Dunkin Donuts breakfast. Last night we received a text from Potato Chip that she had tried the big climb out of town and found it too scary so she went back and did the winter blue blaze. Based on that intel, our age, the size of our packs, and my general dislike of heights we decided to make another controversial decision and take the winter blue blaze trail which bypasses the scary rock wall climb. It added six tenth of a mile to our day and then we got misdirected and added another half mile. As usual, it was still a long, rocky up. We got to see some beautiful views of the town and the valley below. We also got a good view of the zinc smelting facility that caused all the environmental destruction in the area. They've been working for decades to try to repair the damage and get something to grow along the mountain side. It's actually a superfund site.After we got to the top of the ridge out of town we were on a new reroute of the AT that had just opened a few weeks ago. It is thru the area where the regrowth of plants has started so the trees are very small. The trail club who worked on this section has done a fantastic job of carefully laying out stones so there is a clear path thru the large boulders. At some points they fitted the flat stones with such care that it looks like a patio walk. That was in one relatively small section. The rest of the day was more of the same....ankle biting rocks. We are in an area where water sources are rare and when there is one it's a half mile trek downhill to get it. The balance is between carrying the water that you need for the day and evening without carrying too much weight. We had planned for a campsite at about 10.7 miles into the day with confirmed water running four tenths of a mile downhill. We got there and were very ready to stop for the day. We took our packs off and looked at FarOut while we rested. We had miscalculated the mileage again and if we stayed there, we would have a 19.7 mile day tomorrow to the shelter before town. Oh, no. That wasn't going to happen. We decided to hike another six miles to the next shelter and shorten our day tomorrow. It was six miles of rocks. We wanted to make sure we got a good tent spot because we heard that a lot of people were aiming for it (water half mile down hill). The rocks made hurrying really hard. I tripped and after several giant steps trying to save myself I landed on Bob. He kept us both from falling. We rolled into the shelter campsite at almost 7:00 thoroughly exhausted. We had just enough time to cook, eat, say hi to the ""shorts crew"" and crawl into our tent. We have met several of the shorts crew over the past week or so. They are mostly guys who all hike in very short running shorts of various prints; jean shorts, a Maryland flag, a Canadian flag, camo, etc.","Bert's hostel

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654163,"Last night at 1:30 we woke up to a bunch of people with headlamps loudly walking down the trail toward the shelter. The tent sites, where we were, are about a tenth of a mile before the shelter. They sounded young. We briefly thought they might be part of the shorts crew who had camped and partied at the nudist camp near Palmerton the previous night. About an hour later I woke to the sound of truck engine, then more lights. I looked out of the tent and saw lights of what looked like ATV's heading towards us on the shelter side trail. These are not allowed on the AT and I thought, great, the locals are up to mischief. As they got closer, I could see white headlights and red flashing lights on top of what looked like roll bars. On the trail closest to us one of the ATV's hit something and had to stop and maneuver around it. I could hear voices and finally saw the outline of a man with a firefighters helmet on. Holy crap!! This was a rescue squad! What the heck had happened?! This was all happening about 50 feet from our tent. The vehicles continued on down toward the shelter, but I could still hear the hum of what I think must have been a large emergency vehicle idling in the power cut clearing back toward the AT. Amazingly, Bob was asleep thru all this commotion. I debated getting dressed and finding out what was going on but wasn't sure what I'd find, and would probably be in the way anyway. About an hour later, the ATV's came back up the trail with a couple people walking behind. It looked like someone was attending to someone else lying in the back of the vehicle. After the ATV's pulled out and the idling emergency vehicle left, all was silent again. One guy came walking back to our campsite and I asked what happened. He said that some local teenagers got drunk and a girl hit her head.
This morning we finally walked the four tenths down the hill and back up again for the day's water. The campsite folks shared what we all thought of last night. About a quarter mile down the trail several of us found the remains of the teenage party strewn around a campfire that was still smoldering. Several of us thought we'd try and pack out some of it, until two of the partiers appeared from their campsite a little further on. One confirmed that the girl was in the hospital but just required a neck brace. A nurse that camped near us seems to think there is much more to the story, and I'm sure he's right.The rest of the day's hiking was more of the same freaking rocks....all day....relentless, and exhausting. The rain started about 1:30 and was steady for about 20 minutes, then petered off to light rain for another hour or so. We got cooled off and soaked, and the rocks got wet and slippery. We played hopscotch with the guys from the shorts crew as they stopped for one reason or another. We chatted with the nurse, G-unit, whose wife just got off trail to take care of her sick horse. She'd been on trail since Georgia and he was excited to meet another married couple on the trail. We are pretty rare.The trail got a teensy bit better for the last two miles before the shelter. We didn't expect anyone to be here because most folks seem to be pushing the last six miles into Delaware Water Gap. Several ate dinner and pushed on, but two guys stayed. There seem to be a bunch of 13 or 14 year old boys camping somewhere near. We surprised them when they peaked their heads around the corner of the shelter. They also keep walking down and back on the gravel road just behind the shelter and close to our tent to get water. There is a retreat center which has ridged up a spigot at the corner of their property for use by the AT shelter, which is very generous of them. They have also posted very clear ""respect our privacy/no trespassing"" signs to keep anyone from going any further. From what we heard of their conversation, that didn't stop the boys from investigating.","Leroy Smith shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654291,"The rain never came back last night but we stayed in a fog all night. This means that everything we left on our line never dried. That's typical. 
We headed out and quickly found where the teenage boys were camping. They had a pretty nice view of the valley. The rocks were a little better and we had some long dirt road walks, which was so much better on our abused feet. The dirt felt like absolute cushions compared to the sharp rocks we'd been experiencing. We entered into the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (part of the National Park Service) for the last four miles of our short six mile day. Just before we started the descent into town, we had a great view of Mount Tammany across the river in New Jersey. We started to encounter more day hikers coming up for the day to see the view. It's quite a climb for them. We talked to a nice couple from Skokie, Illinois out here for a wedding.We walked thru the first rhodie tunnel we'd seen for weeks and then past a pond full of blooming lily pads. The pond was beautiful and the first time we'd seen anything like this on the trail. We finally walked into the town of Delaware Water Gap. It's on the Delaware River so, therefore, on the very edge of the rocky state of Pennsylvania. It's a cute little trail town and it means the end of the trail in the state that is not our favorite. We have also decided to do a celebratory zero here to allow our feet to recover a bit. We stopped at the post office on the way to our motel to pick up a box that contains, among other things, a new pair fo shoes for me. The rocks have put holes in the tops and worn down some areas of the soles so badly that the tread is gone. Yay!!As we walked thru town, we periodically see hikers we've met. At the first hostel we passed, we saw Lily ( met her at the Lookout hostel), and one of the guys from the shelter last night. Our first priority is to get to the motel, shower and find lunch. In the parking lot of the motel we saw G-unit (the nurse) talking on the phone. Clean and in our town clothes, we walked back into town and stopped at the Village Market and Bakery to eat. It was recommended by several other hikers and has a wonderful selection of homemade baked goods and sandwiches. We sat outside and chatted quite a while with G-unit. It turns out that he had gone down to help out with the rescue the other night and knew more of the scoop. It turns out that the drunk girl who was hurt had tried to climb the electrical transmission tower (under which the teenagers were all camped and partying for the 4th of Jule weekend) and that's when she felling hit her head. We found a local news report that headlined the episode as ""first responders rescue woman who fell on Appalachian Trail."" It bothers us that the story was reported so inaccurately as to appear that it was an AT thru-hiker hiker who was injured, not a misbehaving local teenager. It's also a good chance that thru-hikers will be blamed for all the trash left behind by the partiers.Back at the hotel, we did our laundry and ran into R-dot. He is ahead of us so he just finished a double zero and is heading out in the morning. We laugh and smile that we keep running into each other. Potato Chip and Siesta are zeroing with family and we found that they are getting back on trail the same day we are so we will hike with them....until we become too slow for them.We found a good restaurant in town and treated ourselves to a nice dinner.","Kirkridge shelter

After we left him, we had to go to the next town over to pick up some prescriptions for Bob and do some resupply. Again, we called on the magic of Uber. The rest of the day was spent organizing, resting, and planning our next few days.
We stopped at the Village Market and Bakery again for dinner and had a delicious homemade pot pie and shepherds pie, plus some local Reading soda, blackberry cream, all followed by blueberry pie a la mode. Yum! To finish off our stay in town, we walked down to the Deer Head Inn for a drink. It professes to be the oldest continuously operating jazz club in the country. It also has rooms upstairs but sadly, no laundry so we didn't try them. We sat at the bar a listened to a cool, three piece jazz trio and chatted with two women who are regulars. The trail brings many gifts by way of these experiences.","

We checked the weather and saw no rain for several days. We got to the front door of the motel and it was pouring!  We looked at the radar and saw the only small cloud in the area was over us so we decided to wait it out. It had completely stopped within 10 minutes. So much for weather apps.We stopped again for great homemade breakfast sandwiches and apple cider donuts at the Village Farm and Bakery. I think every other hiker in town was there getting breakfast, too, or at least the ones heading out today. We hiked the half mile back up the hill into town and followed the trail out.The first obstacle was the I-80 bridge over the Delaware River. I had been dreading this  since we started. Bob had talked about how it bounced when heavy traffic came over it, which gave him the willies, too. He is correct. It does bounce. When we got to it, it wasn't as far above the river as I'd imagined, but the cars and semi's do not slow down at all. Like the other bridges, it has a waist high concrete wall separating the hikers from traffic and an open metal guardrail on the river side. In the middle is the boarder between Pennsylvania and New Jersey and hikers traditionally take their picture there. The hikers from breakfast were there already so we swapped picture taking. We made it across and happily hiked down the ramp.The Pennsylvania rocks, that we've heard continue into New Jersey, weren't too bad to start. We hiked up out of the gap along a nice creek for a while. We hadn't done that for weeks. About five miles in we got to Sunfish pond. It's a pretty little spot so we stopped for a lunch break. We could see lots of little frogs, tadpoles, and we could hear the croaks of bullfrogs from around the pond. The trail then went halfway around the pond along the shoreline. That's where the rocks began again in earnest. Several people had told us that the rocks continue for about thirty miles into New Jersey. Well, today we went thru about a third of that. My new shoes helped a lot with foot pain.As we walked around the pond we saw a dark cloud looming. The rain was light when it did hit us, but it was enough to make the rocks slippery again. There was a fantastic viewing spot back toward Pennsylvania at the top of Kittatinny Mountain. We decided to go to the Mohican Outdoor Center instead of one of the campsites a mile or two down the trail. We'd heard those sites were small, had recent bear sightings, no bear boxes or cables, and are easily accessible to locals (it's Friday night). The Mohican Outdoor Center is run by the Appalachian Mountain Club and includes a small lodge, cabins, a bunk house and assigned walk-in tent sites, all for a fee. Their prices are high so we chose to tent. All the tent sites have picnic tables and bear boxes. There is easy, potable water, and a clean pit toilet. We have simple needs. It's like car camping, but we walked in. Just as we were finishing dinner, we looked over and saw two recognizable hats walking in. It was Potato Chip and Siesta. They just had a double zero and didn't get a very early start. They tented near us and we caught up with them a bit and compared our strategy for the next few days. We haven't sent them since Hamburg.","Clarion Inn, Delaware Water Gap, PA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654424,"We had kids at the group campsite near us last night having a ""who can scream louder"" contest at about 1:30. That was fun. At first we thought they might be trying to chase away a bear, but then realized it was just screaming for screaming sake. We went past the Mohican center lodge on our way out and got our water from their spigot. That's a nice luxury. We should be good with two liters in our hydration bladders and our little bottles mixed with Propel electrolytes to drink throughout the day. The AT path thru New Jersey follows the ridgeline which parallels the Delaware River. This means that we are hiking along rhe spine like ridge of rocks quite a bit. This morning, we hiked along a ledge that was wide open to a view of a farm and houses down below. The drop over the edge made us both nervous. We caught up to Potato Chip and Siesta and hiked with them for a while. They had taken a blue blaze alternative out of the outdoor center. We told Potato Chip that she would not have appreciated the ledges from this morning....way to close to the edge.Down off the ridge we came across a pond full of blooming lily pads. Right in the middle  of the pond was a huge and distinctive beaver lodge. It was such a classic picture of a beaver pond. We hiked around the end of the pond we came across the dam that created the pond and the trail went over it. It was cool to see. A little further on we found a few large, partially chewed trees the over ambitious beaver was not quite able to add to his dam.We are still in the New Jersey version of the rocks. I spoke to one woman who agreed that they are different somehow from the Pennsylvania rocks. We hiked over several more exposed ledges with views and crawled up several more piles of boulders. At one point, we had to let our poles dangle again to use our hands to grab the rocks on almost a wall of rock. This time it was more fun than scary. I'm still amazed at the view we see when we look out from the ledges. We see trees as far as the eye can see and several rows of mountains. I can't believe I'm writng this but it's almost like a mini Smokies, without the mists. We haven't seen views anywhere like this since we left the Shennies. At the shelter tonight, there were only two older thru-hikers who were ahead of us today, and a crew of tents setup further down. We setup our tent in a flat spot near the shelter because we didn't want to walk any further than we already had, and the tenting crew sounded like they would be loud. About an hour after we arrived, Potato Chip and Siesta arrived. They had decided to backtrack to Crater Lake and go for a swim. We chatted a bit about staying motivated on trail after so long. They've both been on since Georgia. One of the biggies is food. Certain foods that you loved in the beginning of a long hike like this are foods you cannot even look at, let alone try and eat at this point. Thru-hikers are forever swapping ideas of what to eat and what to carry on trail. We have picked up some new tricks, like saving the plastic lined bag from a Mountain House dehydrated dinner and using it as a cooking pouch for our ramen meals. That way we can keep our cooking pot clean and used only to boil water. The pouch can be rinsed out, easily stored in our food bag and reused several times. Backpackers, as a breed, are very water and space conscious.","Mohican Outdoor Center

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654567,"It was a chilly night last night. We started with the tent fly off for fresh air, then by about 1:30 we were both shivering, so on went the fly. We got up and out early because we saw on FarOut that there was going to be trail magic at a parking area four miles up (that's two hours by our average pace, depending on terrain) beginning at 9:00. We hiked along another ledge with a view of another lake. We could see the docks and beautiful homes around the lakeshore. What a perfect spot for the folks who lives in northern New Jersey and even New York. We met Moose at the trail magic. He is doing trail magic every day for the entire month of July! Trail angels never cease to amaze me. They truly love thru-hikers. Moose used to be a backpacking instructor for the girl scouts back in the 70's, and he has section hiked a lot of the trail. He volunteered how he received his trail name. He was hiking in Maine, looking down, and ran into a moose at the hip (moose are very tall). The moose got angry and turned on him, so he threw his raincoat over the moose's head to calm it (like a horse, I'm thinking?). He said it took half an hour to get his coat back, and the name stuck. Anyway, he had a long table of exactly the type of food that thru-hikers like. He even had a Keurig machine and a cooler with ice cream, both plugged into a generator. This guy has thought of everything! The hot coffee was nice on a still chilly morning.Potato Chip and Siesta mentioned that it would be nice to slackpack. Moose volunteered to take their packs up to the rangers station if they would watch his trail magic site. They pulled what they needed from their packs and away he went. Leaving hikers in charge of trail magic is a bit like leaving a fox in charge of the hen house, but they behaved themselves. We spent way too long sitting in the lovely camp chairs with backs and had to push on.We walked into the New Jersey woods, which somehow looks very different from the Pennsylvania woods, except for the rocks. We saw a very bright sign declaring that bears are very active in the area. We are very happy that New Jersey has decided to put bear boxes at all the shelters. I, for one, sleep better at night. We usually try to take a packs off break every two to three hours. We decided to split the miles we had left and aimed for the covered pavilion at the top of Sunset Mountain. Even though today was in the 70's, it gets hot when we get out on the exposed rock ledges. We got to the top and heard people. As we walked in, we saw Potato Chip and Siesta sitting in camp chairs with plates of food in their laps. They laughed when they saw us. Trail magic! A guy who had thru-hiked in 2016 now does an elaborate trail magic feast with friends. They had fruit, Chinese noodles, chicken wings, potstickers, and more. It was a feast! We couldn't believe our luck to have two such fantastic experiences of trail magic in one day. We even met a ridge runner who remembered us from the Standing Bear hostel (""hippy farm"") outside the Smokies as we ended the first part of our hike in March of 2020.With extra food to go, we left another gift from the trail to hike the last three and a half miles to our shelter for the night. We filled up on water at the magic because the water situation at the shelter is precarious. There is no water at the actual shelter except what a trail angel brings in every few days, and the creeks before it are either dried up or stagnant and dark with tannins. Not ideal, but apparently folks who have hike trails like the CDT or Colorado trail are less picky about this kind of water source. Thankfully, the trail angel showed up about ten minutes after we arrived with 35 gallons in several huge containers. These get locked in the bear box for passing hikers to take what they need. There is a wide open space in front of the shelter and no one else here so we setup our tent there. Then we sat and tried to go over the plan for our next couple of weeks. It's a lot of work to try and plan out our days, our food, where to stay and resupply points. We are definitely not the kind of folks who just hike until we're tired then just camp wherever. By the time we were ready to crawl into our tent for the evening, three other hikers showed up. Two we had met before, Bullshit, from Dallas, and Eyore, from just north of Boston. It's nice to have other folks to help fight off Breezly Bruin should the need arise.","Brinks shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654568,"I think we discovered what was making the scratching noises I heard while we were eating dinner last night. After dark, when we were all in our tents, we heard one of the guys call out quietly ""go away, get outa here!"" Then a minute later, he told us that it was a skunk! Not sure which is scarier, the actual bear which can hurt you, or the mini-bear which can spray and make your life miserable for a very long time. Luckily we didn't have to worry. It walked away.We had decided to change our destination today from a town, Unionville, to a shelter two miles before. We read up on the town, and while they offer free tenting with real bathrooms and potable water, the street lights stay on all night and the clock tower chimes on the hour. Alternately, we read about a shelter on private property that has potable water, an outdoor shower, power outlets to charge our devices, plenty of tent space, and a friendly, resident donkey. Decision made, plus it's fewer miles.We were kind of excited for today because we heard a rumor that we might finally lose the dreaded rocks. At five miles into the day, we reached the highest point in New Jersey, found in, of course, High Point State Park. We reached the park headquarters, where the sold cans of sodas for and incredible 50 cents! Such a deal, and in New Jersey! A mile further on is the observation tower for High Point. Since that is right on the trail and we didn't intend to walk up to the actual High Point obelisk, we took in the view from the tower. We could see three states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. There was a step decline down from High Point and then the trail turned right and went from being parallel to the Pennsylvania state line to begin parallel to the New York state line. When it did that, the trail smoothed out. The rocks are not completely gone but we turned off the Kittatinny ridgeline and that made the difference. As we hiked through the woods, we started seeing old stone walls. At first it was one or two, but then we started seeing more, extending as far as we could see. We started wondering how old they were, and who the people were who dug those rocks out of the soil in order to try and farm, and piled those stones to mark their property boarders. The trees in the woods didn't look very old so we wondered how long it was that the folks gave up trying to farm the land and let it go back to forest. We took our last packs off stop at the corner of a field of hay that was still boarded by an old stone wall. It's cool that these old walls are still in use to separate fields.We got to the ""secret shelter,"" as it's called. It has a large field for tenting, several outbuildings, and a wandering, friendly donkey named Jake. Apparently a former thru-hiker owns the property and has set this up for hikers. There is an outdoor shower, which we used to rinse ourselves and our clothes, and a building with outlets to charge our devices. What thru-hiker could ask for more! Jake has made his way around to everyone begging for food, but at sunset, he seemed to disappear. Presumably he went back to his barn for the night. At last count, there are fourteen tents and one hammock in our field. The moon is almost full and it's a clear night so we're trying no tent fly again.","Mashipacong shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654831,"We had our fly off and between the almost full moon and the light from the out building in front of us it was a bright night. Jake the donkey came trotting back from his barn this morning while everyone was eating breakfast and packing up. He made the rounds to everyone and when he reached Siesta, he started harassing her. He butted her stomach to encourage her to share her breakfast and we all laughed.
We hiked out with Potato Chip and Siesta but they pulled away pretty quickly. There was a long road walk and we met up with them as we all took a break on a bench about two hours into the day, just before the trail skirted around the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge.We reached the boardwalk section of the trail in New Jersey. It was a sunny day and cloudless so it was very hot. We hikers are  used to tree cover so we were particularly overheated.We finally reached the road in Vernon and the Heavenly Hill Farms. It was blissfully air conditioned inside and we all bought cold drinks and ice cream. We sat outside with some other hikers trying to figure out what to do. Bob and I had already booked a motel, but Potato Chip and Siesta were debating whether to stay or keep going. They finally decided to stay as well but had to book a different place. We all had to find a way to get to our motels but neither shuttle drivers nor Uber would respond. We went old school and stuck out our thumbs. Potato Chip and Siesta got picked up first and we could see their apologetic faces as they went past us. I wasn't happy about hitchhiking but Bob told me to be patient. A few minutes later, we were picked up by a former thru-hiker, named ""$10 chocolate bar,"" who had hiked in 2016. He said that we made his day by givingusaride. He had been helped with rides several times when he was a hiker and was thrilled to be able to pass on the magic. Our motel was only two miles from the trailhead but we didn't want to do a road walk in the heat. The Appalachian Motel advertised that they had laundry, but would only do the laundry of the first hiker who had arrived and zeroed. We were not happy, and ended up doing our laundry in the shower and the sink. Not the best, but better than nothing. With rides so hard to get, we walked the mile down the busy road to the grocery store....during rush hour. After we got our resupply, we decided to stop at a pizza place and ordered pizza.....for delivery. We also asked them if their driver would mind delivering us, too. We explained our situation and the driver was fine with it.It was a rough, hot day so we drank a beer with our pizza and crashed.","Jake's Secret shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654833,"We got to sleep later than we wanted to after last night's adventures. This morning we still didn't know how we were going to get back to trail. We had seen that there were other hikers staying at the motel so Bob walked down and saw a room door open. He asked how they were getting back and they had made arrangements with a guy. We asked if he had room for two more, and problem solved. We were very happy we didn't have to walk the mile and a half back to the trail. 
To start, it was a flat walk back into the woods. We knew the next part was referred to, euphemistically, as the ""stair to heaven."" Translated, that means steep, with a crap ton of rocks. It was a slow, hot, climb over the rocks, but we were very glad the sun was not on this side of the mountain. As climbs go, I think I'd rather have rocks and rock steps than a long dirt path. Several hikers that we have met, and that stayed in the same motel as Potato Chip and Siesta, all passed us on the way up, regardless of age. Not sure if it's the difference between 1,360 mile legs and 600 mile legs, or we're just that slow.On the way down the other side, we ran into a guy coming southbound who had done the trail last year. He gave us the lowdown on the water situation coming up. In short, not great. Since the rainstorm never materialized yesterday, that left the creeks that had been dry, still dry. He said he left trail magic, consisting of Gatorade, cokes and water, in a cooler at the next road crossing. Yay! We plodded along the ups and downs, the paths and the rock scrambles. We stopped for our second packs off break on a log near a road. It was near a parking area and we heard voices. Could it be? We picked up our packs and went to investigate. More trail magic! A woman had driven two and a half hours from Long Island (yes, that's how close we are!) to meet up with her son and she brought amazing trail magic. She had cold sodas, Gatorade and water, plus she had some random food resupply items like potatoes, tuna packets, spam and pop tarts. She was so excited to see her son and meet other thru-hikers. She even brought a scale for people to weigh themselves. The guys had all lost ridiculous amounts of weight and one of the younger women was so excited because she had gained eight pounds of pure muscle!The last part of our day sent us up a rock scramble to hike along a rock ridge. At one of the views, we could see Greenville Lake with all it's nice cottages and docks, and far in the distance, the skyline of Manhattan! It's very surreal to see that while hiking the AT. At mile 1369.5, we crossed from New Jersey to New York. We have now entered our ninth state.Our campsite is near a creek that is actually flowing. We were worried about it based on all the water issues, but FarOut had a report from two days ago that it was flowing, so we were hopeful. It's a little tea colored from all the tannins but that doesn't bother us. All we wanted to do was setup our tent, eat dinner and dive into the tent to lie down and escape the bugs. As we lay here, we can hear the faint sound of the boats and waverunners from Greenwood Lake below us.Potato Chip and Siesta stopped for water and are continuing on the 5.7 miles to the road. They are heading in Warwick, NY to see a movie. There is an old drive-in movie theater allows thru-hikers to tent and watch movies for free. A lot of the hikers we've talked to recently are either going or already went. Apparently, last night there were close to forty tents. Sitting without chairs in our tent with so many other folks and watching three movies until really late didn't appeal to us. Ah, well.","Appalachian Motel, Vernon, NJ

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654834,"We were excited about getting going this morning because 4.7 ahead was a Creamery with ice cream for second breakfast. What we didn't realize is that in between were a lot of steep rock scrambles which required the use of our hands, and slanted rock ledges that, if your shoes didn't grip on the rock it was a long way down. It took us a little longer than we expected, but we had some beautiful views. We understand that the trail is challenging  but some of these areas can be downright dangerous. 
When we finally made it to the Creamery, it didn't open for another hour and forty-five minutes. Needless to say we were very disappointed. The only good thing is that they are very hiker friendly. On the outside of their building, they have a water spigot and a four port power charging station for use by thru-hikers. There is even a big AT sign painted on the wall. We have no pictures because we were both frustrated by their hours and the fact that we had messed up and have no place to stay on a Saturday night (in this resort area) when we had planned to clean up and resupply. It's our own fault and we are still trying to work it out. Between the Creamery and the trail is a hotdog stand, so at least we were able to get some lunch. We never did get ice cream because we wasted so much time trying to replan our next few stops and will our food hold out an extra day before a resupply. We filled our water at the spigot because our next good water was over seven and a half miles ahead where we planned to camp. It's hard to see what would be our water sources dried up completely or just mud holes. The whole area is so dry that when we take our socks off at night the dust from the trail has worked its way thru our gatters, our shoes and our socks to our feet.  We came thru a section called the Cascades, which apparently refers to the cascades of water normally present. It was totally dry. Even a waterfall was completely dry. It was so sad to see. Again this afternoon the trail was alternately steep scrambles and smooth paths At campsite, Bob got water from the creek connecting a pond to a reservoir while I scoped out a tent site before the rest of the folks getting water all decided to stay here, too. There ended up being about ten of us and there was plenty of room for all their tents.  We had two Germans and one Danish guy among us. We re-realized just how old we are compared to a lot of these hikers. The Europeans were discussing how the way they right their dates (day before month) can come in handy if they are not yet 21.","Furnace Brook campsite

The full moon was rising thru the trees so it looked like someone was walking around in the distance with their headlamp on. It was eerie because we saw it just after we heard the crash of the branch.
More rocks, some scary climbs. The truth about rocks on the AT is they don't ""get better after _____"" They just morph into a different and equally difficult form.One of the more fun rock things we did today was the lemon squeezer. Bob took his pack off to make it thru but I thought I'd try to keep mine on and I made it!It was along, hard day. We are hot and exhausted after all the scrambles and the long miles.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654836,"Last night we were woken up at about midnight by a very bright becon of light. A couple had come in and were setting up their tent inside the shelter (no one else was in there because it was an old, stone shelter which are dinghy and dark). They were using what appeared to be a foot long LED lantern that they had hung up to light their activities, so we were pretty sure that they were not thru hikers.
Today was a day of mountains. The first one was Black Mountain. Most of the group we had camped with the night before last went up to camp there last night and watch the sunrise this morning. Bullshit and Eyore debated going up too but heard it was going to be crowded. When we got up there this morning, the sky was hazy and you couldn't see the NYC skyline if you tried. It's supposed to be one of the best spots to see it.The next and larger mountain was Bear Mountain. It's a very popular destination for folks coming out of New York and today was a Saturday. There were lots of cyclists and motorcyclists on the roads we crossed. After climbing the usual uphill thru the woods, we reached the stone steps built by the CCC in the 30's. Purposely constructed stone steps are much easier to deal with than the random rocks that we usually have. We reached the top and entered the very touristy area. That was good because we found a vending machine with cold Powerade and ice cream sandwiches, but  bad because there were just too many people! Wow, was that overwhelming. The AT trail down into the town of Fort Montgomery was also the purposely constructed stone step trail that all these tourists were using...kids running ahead of parents, people of all sizes and abilities, large family groups, all different languages spoken, and stinky us with our large backpacks and trekking poles. This went on for over a mile and a half and eleven hundred feet. At the bottom was a huge picnic area that was packed with thousands of families and groups all playing and having parties and cookouts. We hadn't been around this many people since we left home and it was a little freaky. It was definitely culture shock. We stopped into the Hiker Cafe at the Bear Mountain Inn  right there at the park. We had some burgers and cold drinks and tried to plan our next two weeks. It's a struggle because of our mileage and the water situation. We are also struggling because this area of the trail is not as hiker friendly as we've experienced further south. We cannot find a motel that has laundry so that we can get cleaned up. The trail has been so dry and dusty and the air has been so humid and sticky that we are in serious need. My personal struggle is doing all this on the small screen of my phone while trying to conserve battery because we can't charge that often. The one good thing about it being a Saturday was that the zoo was open. The trail is actually routed through the Bear Mountain Zoo. It's a tiny zoo and they do have a pair of bears in a relatively small enclosure. They are both there because they have a form of alopecia and can no longer survive in the wild. Most of the animals at the zoo fall into that category. As we came down the mountain, we could see the large suspension bridge that we were about to cross over the Hudson River. To me, it looked a lot higher and scarier than the bridge over the Delaware at the Water Gap. After we hiked through the zoo we crossed the lanes of traffic going across the bridge. My stomach was in knots but Bob was fine as we headed off across it. Luckily for me, the actual cables that supported the bridge were on the outer edge of where we were walking so they blocked my direct view of the water down below on that side. I kept looking at Bob's heals and encouraging him not to stop and look over the edge. Fun fact, the bridge is the lowest point on the AT at 174 feet above sea level. Our campsite was just a few miles up the hill after the bridge. At camp we met Smokey the Bard, who carries and plays the lute, Wiz, short for wizard, Stone Age, who looks like the pro cyclist, Peter Sagan, and Pipes, who plays the bagpipes but brought a type of recorder like instrument that simulates a bagpipe fingerings but sounds better without the drones. Both Smokey and Pipes gave us little concerts and it was such a treat to hear in the woods.","William Brien Memorial shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654840,"We had a slightly tilted tent site and heard the trains all night running along the Hudson, which isn't too far away. That made for not a great sleeping night. We were all up and out this morning fairly early. We knew we didn't have too far to go because we planned to nearo. We had an easy three and a half miles to the Appalachian Market, which is a combination 24 hour gas station and deli. This would be our resupply point for the next few days. 
Stone Age had left his bandana at the campsite this morning and we had a sliver of hope that we might find him. Sure enough, he was sitting waiting for us at the market because another hiker at our campsite had told him we had it. We chatted with him for a bit while we ordered breakfast sandwiches from the grill and enjoyed some OJ. Since we only had another few miles to go today, we decided to order deli sandwiches for lunch and dinner and pack them to our site. It's a treat to have something fresh and a serious break from bars and ramen. We were also able to do another predictably expensive four day resupply. The way we calculate it, we can either pay for a ride to town to get a less expensive resupply or pay the prices at these convenient markets. It's about a wash.It was an easy hike to our destination, the Graymoor Spiritual Center. Bob had stayed here 23 years ago when he had attempted a thru-hike. It is a baseball field located on a large property owned by a Franciscan priory. There are still friars in the main building on the hill. There is also a shrine and a 9/11 memorial on the grounds. The best part for the hikers is that there is an enclosed outdoor shower and a sink to do some laundry. Between sweating all day from the heat, and the dust and dirt from the trail, which hasn't seen rain in over two weeks, we are filthy. Even tho the shower only has cold water, it was very welcome. Someone had left a bottle of laundry detergent so we did our laundry in a bucket and hung it to dry on a line in the sun. It's not perfect, but we're cleaner than we were. We enjoyed a quiet, peaceful afternoon and listened to the carillon chime the hours then softly play a short hymn. We were the only ones around until a group of guys showed up for a baseball game. It turns out that they are all in a residential rehab program up at the priory and they have a game every Sunday. As it grew later, hikers slowly hiked in. By the time the sun went down, there were fourteen tents setup around the edge of the field.","Hemlock Springs campsite

I made a beeline for the power outlets in the pavilion before anyone else got up so that I could top up our phones before we left. We were streaming some videos last night with wild abandon because we knew we could charge our phones. We beat our record by leaving at 6:30! We wanted to get a jump on the heat and the forecasted rain. 
The rain held off for one hour. At first it was gentle and cooling, especially after all the dry, hot days. After that it became a soaking rain, then a pouring rain. With a few lulls, it lasted for the rest of our hiking day. We had sprayed bug repellent when we left this morning but the rain washed it off. As soon as there was a pause in the rain, the mosquitos would swarm and go for blood. We reapplied the repellent and got some relief from the mosquitos, but not from the biting flies. Sheesh! We were so anxious to get to our shelter and out of the rain that we hiked for five hours with only pauses to pull some snacks from our pockets. We took our packs off briefly during a lull, and then pushed thru to the shelter. It was a long day and thank goodness the terrain was good. We geeked out a little on history again when we came across some signs. We crossed the Old Albany Post road, which is apparently one of the oldest roads in the country that is still in use. When we crossed it and went into the woods, we immediately found another plaque explaining that the stone ruins we were looking at were the foundations of a farmhouse and barn where there was an inoculation station for Washington's Revolutionary war soldiers during the smallpox epidemic 1776. Soaking wet and disheveled, we hiked down the last bit of path leading to the shelter and we saw Potato Chip coming toward us, chuckling at our appearance. She had come back after zeroing for a few days with Siesta, who eventually had to go home for family reasons. Potato Chip asked where we'd be so she could meet us and continue hiking with us. She had been at the shelter for most of the day because her shuttle time was early in the day. She had blocked enough room in the shelter for all three of us because she figured we might not want to tent in the rain. She was right. Neither of us is fond of shelters but this place was built last year so it's really nice, clean and airy. We caved right away and decided to sleep in the shelter.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654988,"If we had any question about our decision to stay in the shelter last night, it was answered by the torrential rain storm that came thru last night. We had checked the weather and it said no more rain after 7:00 PM. Wrong! It was really warm and buggy in the shelter but we were dry.
It was a beautiful morning but it was going to be a warm day. We put on our wet shoes, socks and clothes, and headed off with Potato Chip. We had a plan to get to the deli ten miles ahead for lunch. The day was pretty much the same, up, down and around thru the woods. We stopped at the RPH shelter for a packs off break and chatted with some other hikers who had also gotten soaked in the rain yesterday but pushed on five miles further to this shelter. They were still drying their gear out. The day was hot and the deli and pizza place was a half mile off trail, down a busy road. We spend the day under tree cover so walking down a hot, paved road better be worth it. It was. The place had air conditooned, indoor seating and was full of hikers. The sandwiches were really tasty and Potato Chip was able to get a plate of gluten free pasta with fresh, homemade meatball and sauce. They also had the most amazing pistachio Gelato I have ever tasted! Bob and I both ordered sandwiches to go for dinner. Maybe that wasn't the best decision because it was extra weight and we already had dinners in our packs, even if it was just ramen. The last stretch wasn't as tough as the previous stretch but we were really hot and tired, especially after the push in the rain yesterday. We try to keep hydrated by drinking Gatorade when we can get it, and mix up electrolytes to drink all day because we are sweating so much in the heat. We had to stop two miles before the shelter to get and filter enough water for the night and to start the day tomorrow because there is no water at the shelter.We chatted with Small Spoon and Finestein. It turns out that Small Spoon is a kayak instructor from Maui and also a certified PADI divemaster. We had fun chatting with him about both.

We both woke up at about 4:00 to hear the folding of tent poles. When we finally woke for the day around 5:30, we saw that four of the tents near us had disappeared. We think they got up and out early to beat the heat. 
Today was warm already as we were packing up. We knew we had a short day and a shuttle scheduled for midday. The terrain was pretty gentle but it was hot...the hottest day we've had so far. We had to stop and filter water at about three and a half miles in because there was no water at the shelter last night. After that we pushed the last five miles or so to the road to meet Stonelegs, our shuttle driver. He's from Australia and has hiked the AT several times and is now following the bubble helping out hikers. ""The bubble"" refers to where the majority of hikers are on the trail. It is catching up to us and we are starting to see shelters and tenting areas becoming more crowded. The place we met the shuttle driver is where the largest tree on the AT is located, the Dover oak. The Dover oak is estimated to be over 300 years old and 22 feet in diameter. It is larger than the Keefer oak that we saw down in Virginia. Considering where we are and all the old stone walls we've seen winding through the woods, it's amazing to speculate the history this old tree has witnessed.This afternoon's adventure starts with camping in Edward R. Murrow memorial park. It's a municipal park on the edge of the town of Pawling where thru-hikers are allowed to camp. There is a pavilion with power, bathrooms and an outdoor shower. Luckily the area has several large trees to provide shade for our tents. We staked out our spots and got a ride back into town with Stonelegs before he left. We needed a little resupply and we stopped for lunch at O'Connor's tavern. Potato Chip and I were excited about getting a loaded spinach salad.

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655076,"It was not a super restful night last night. There were lights on some of the buildings across the park and a road very nearby. It also felt a little strange and exposed tenting in a city park.We had scheduled a shuttle ride for 9:00 AM because that's when the driver was available but we canceled it and called a taxi for earlier. 9 AM would be way to late to start on another hot day. We crossed open sunny fields to get us nice and hot and  sweaty before we headed up one of two 500 foot climbs for the day. That doesn't seem like much compared to other climbs but when it's hot outside, it feels it. We wound through rocky ravines that were similar to yet different from the hollows down south. Each state, we're discovering, has a distinct feel to it. Today, we entered Connecticut for the first time. I guess we bop back into New York briefly tomorrow and then back to Connecticut. We noticed that the trail club that takes care of this section of Connecticut must have a bigger budget because they have very pretty, coordinated signs and the rock stairs they have created look professionally done.We had to stop for water about two miles before tonight's shelter because the river that flows past it has PCB contamination from a superfund site (former GE plant) upriver in Pittsfield, Massachusetts and our water filters cannot purify the water for our use. Just as we finished filtering, we felt the first few raindrops. It was in the forecast as 30-40% chance in the afternoon. We had one more big hill to climb and the rain started. At first it was refreshing on our overheated bodies, then it began to rain harder. We were soon soaked through. It was raining so hard that a waterfall of water was rolling off the rocks as we gingerly watching our footing on the way up the hill. The mud was as slippery as the rocks. The thunder and lightning was beside us and above us as we hiked up. From the sounds of it, we think that maybe two storm systems converged around us. Half an hour later we reached the top and the rain finally let up. As we started down the other side, the sun peeked out and filtered through the trees. Steam rose from the ground and created a mist. This was the area with the beautifully constructed stone steps. The combination of the steps, the streaked sunlight, the mist and the moss covered rocks was almost pretty enough to make us forget that we were soaked to the skin. We had to climb over and around a very large, very recent blow down. The ferns beneath it looked and smelled so freshly crushed that we think it may just have happened in the storm. We found the river (that we can't use) and the shelter near it. In the shelter we met a ridge runner who was trying to dry her things out a bit, too. The area is nice, but wooded so there isn't much chance for us to get the sun to help us dry out. Our pack covers are purely decorative at this point so it's a good thing everything inside is in dry bags...everything except our Ursack food bags, which absorb water, and makes it heavier.The tent site is nice here and much more peaceful than last night so we're hoping for a more restful night.","Edward R.

They had to put up a drying line, too, so they were also caught by the storm. We were the first ones out again. The Ten Mile river near us feeds into the Housatonic river just a few hundred yards after we got back on trail. The Housatonic in this region is classified as having class V whitewater rapids, but we didn't see any kayayers. The trail followed the edge of the river and gradually rose above it so we had a great view. About a mile from camp, we took a blue blaze (which apparently is the original trail) across Bull's Bridge, an old single lane covered bridge across the river. The view of the river from an opening on the bridge was picture perfect. We did have to dodge a few commuters driving to work who seemed less enthusiastic about sharing the bridge with pesky hikers. After the bridge we kept going to a little country store for second breakfast of coffee and microwaved breakfast sandwiches. Potato Chip can't have gluten so she was pleased as punch to have a microwave Indian vindiloo for her breakfast. We picked up Gatorades for the day because it's still really hot. The couple that runs the store were so nice and helpful. They allow hikers to charge their phones, use the water spigot to fill up and carry the right kinds of hiker resupply. We hiked back to the trail and started up our first and main hill for the day. It was so hot that we had to stop several times. We chatted with Gamgee from New Hampshire (PotatoChip is from New Hampshire, too). As we left, we gave him our seat with a view on a rock in the shade. We then played leapfrog with him the rest of the day, between rest and water stops. We have a reservation at an inn in Kent, CT, and only a ten mile day so we were able to make frequent stops in the heat, which was oppressive. We really had to balance the weight of necessary water versus a lighter load.As we were all hiking, we absent-mindedly heard what we thought was a cicada buzzing. Potato Chip stopped and said, ""that's not a cicada..."" She looked and 20 feet off the trail was a very irritated rattle snake! Yikes! We will never hear that sound again without listening closely to the ptich. Further on, we ran across a black rat snake leisurely making its way across the trail. Then, we saw a young buck hiding behind one of the giant, moss covered boulders. The last part of the day was a downhill to a road. It was only a mile into town so instead of trying to hassle with a ride in the heat, we just walked. On the way, we passed the Kent School, a well known prep boarding school. We walked down the little main street looking every bit the exhausted, filthy hikers that we were. It had taken us so long in the heat today that we were able to check in to the hotel right away. Hotels in this area are pricey so all three of us are sharing a room. We're staying at the Fife and Drum Inn tonight. First thing on the agenda were showers, then laundry. We had to get some ice cream before the laundry...to keep up our strength. We decided that we were pizza'd out so we found a Chinese restaurant for dinner. While I sat outside on the top of the steps up to our second floor room talking to my sister on the phone, I got a little surprise. A large black bear lumbered around the corner of the building and stopped to look up at me. We stared at each other for a minute, then I registered that I should maybe move. I stood up and opened the room door and asked if Bob or Potato Chip wanted to see a bear. They jumped to the door, phones in hand, as the bear ambled past the stairs under us and over to the dumpster on the next property. It flipped the lid up, like he'd had lots of practice, but then we scared it off. Bob and I are starting our tenth week on trail and Potato Chip has been on for months and this is the first bear we've seen...outside our little inn in town. After the excitement wore down, Bob went over to the restaurant connected to the inn to let them know about the visitor.  They might want to warn their patrons leaving with doggie bags about our little furry friend.","Ten Mile River Shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655194,"We all slept in this morning. It was a real treat after getting up at close to 5:30 most days to beat the heat, or because the sun was up, or rushing to get to a dining room for an ""included breakfast."" We made coffee in our room, then strolled over to a restaurant for breakfast. Potato Chip's former hiking buddy, Brazil, came to town from New York City to meet her and is staying here at the inn with her boyfriend, Noah, and his dog, Bear. We visited with them for a bit before they went see a family friend and we headed off to get our supplies foe the next leg. Since it's going to be in the mid 90's again tomorrow, and they have a car, they said they would drive us to the trail at 6:30AM, slackpack us (hold on to our stuff and let us hike with just water and snacks), then bring us lunch and cold drinks at a road crossing about nine miles in!! What trail angels! We all went out to dinner at a great local tavern they found. It was nice to have our area of choice expended by their car. We went to the White Horse, in a nearby town, which was a great choice.","

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655400,"Noah, bless his heart, got up this morning and drove us to the trail at 6:30 AM, which was incredibly nice of him. We brought only the essentials in our packs today, and the rest we consolidated and put into Noah and Brazil's car. Today was the hottest day so far, well into the 90's, and we were so fortunate to be able to slackpack, thanks to them. All the weather warnings said to stay in air conditioning and not exert yourself. Oh, well. We had a 13.6 mile day which started with a fair sized up and, of course, down. It was suuuuch a relief not to be carrying 30 pounds all day. There were a couple of up and down bumps thru the woods, then we had a really steep down. Again, thank goodness we didn't have the weight. We had to crawl down in some areas, and use our trekking poles heavily to try and spare our knees going down high steps. At the bottom, the trail started to run along the Housatonic river. It's a rocky, relatively shallow river, but very picturesque. We had gone into an outfitter in Kent and more than half the store was dedicated to fly fishing. We watched a fly fisherman standing waist deep in the river. He could see the big fish he was trying to catch, but was frustrated that it wouldn't take his cast. The trail along the river went for four miles and it passed several very tempting swimming spots. We told Brazil and Noah that we would meet them at a certain time, at a certain road crossing, so we didn't want to be late. After they helped us, they had to drive back to Long Island. We met up with them at 12:30, and we were more than two thirds done with our mileage for the day.  They brought us sandwiches, cold drinks, fruit and a salad for Potato Chip. Bear, Noah's Norwegian Elkhound, was a champion beggar. He discovered he liked watermelon. We repacked our packs and they drove us the .1 back up the hill from the parking to the trailhead and we said goodbye. Wow, were our packs heavy,  especially in the afternoon heat. We were sweating within seconds on the uphill. We had to carry plenty of water to drink because of the heat and we had just resupplied with four days of food. The afternoon was rough. At least the streams had water now, and we stopped at every one to soak our bandana and hats with the cold water. At one large stream, we took off our shoes and socks and soaked our poor feet. Potato Chip just sat down in the water. We had a few more ups and downs before our campsite. The trees today were sparsely leafed out so the sun was beating down on us more than usual. By the time we got to camp we were all exhausted and overheated. We have an unusual privy design at this campsite. It is a box over a pit with a seat on top. That's it...no walls. Very simple and not stinky at all.","Fife and Drum Inn, Kent, CT

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655401,"Last night was the warmest we've had. It was in the upper to mid 70's, which is really warm when you are lying in a fine mesh tent with no air movement. The first two hours of the day were brutal. Even though the temperature was a bit lower than yesterday, the humidity was very high. Our clothes were soaked in sweat after 30 minutes. The bugs were incessant for all three of us. Mosquitos and biting horse flies would circle, swarm and bite, even though we had all sprayed bug repellent. It was a slow and nagging torture. We hoped it would rain to give us some relief, but it barely sprinkled.We ran into quite a few northbound hikers today. They all seemed to be aiming for a spot five to ten miles further than our fifteen mile day. We had a bit of a town walk through Falls Village in the town of Canaan. It ended at the Great Falls of the Housatonic river. These falls are used for hydro-electric power generation for most of the year.The end of the day was the hardest. After  the falls, the trail sent us up to the top of Mt. Prospect along it's spine with a very occasional switchback. It was hot, we were tired and it seemed relentless. Every time we thought we'd reached the top there was another false summit. We knew that the shelter we had chosen was down a half mile from the ridge (sometimes we have to make these odd choices for distance and proximity to water). At one point in the climb we looked at the maps and realized that we were even with the shelter and couldn't we just go the opposite way through the trees and get there instead of up and over the mountain? We finally got to the blue blaze side trail to the shelter and started down. At first the trail was pretty flat. Where was the steep descent that FarOut warned about? Oh, we found it. At the end of a long, hot, tiring day, we had to navigate a very steep descent along what was essentially a cliff edge. I actually got a little vertigo when my eyes accidentally scanned over the edge instead of being glued to my next foot placement. Didn't think anyone else was dumb enough to be here but there was another tent setup. Apollo had started his thru-hike last year and is hoping to finish this year. One nice thing about this shelter was it had the coldest clearest spring we've seen in a long time.","Cesar Brook Campsite

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655402,"It was the first chilly night we've had in a while. The temperature this morning was 57 degrees. That's definitly good sleeping weather.After we ate breakfast, we started up the scary cliff edge we had edged down last night. It was better in the morning light and well rested, but still very steep. We made it back to the trail in 15 minutes, which surprised us all. Three tenths of a mile down the AT was the 1,500 mile mark! That's 737 for our mileage on this leg...and we have felt every step. A little further down we actually got a really nice view. In the distance we could see the three big mountains we would be hiking over today and tomorrow, Bear Mountain, Mt. Race, and Mt. Everett. The hike down off Mt. Prospect, which is what we climbed at the end of yesterday, was a little steep. Connecticut tried its best with some stone steps but at one point they actually put in a wooden ladder to help us down. It's tricky with a full backpack but we managed.At the bottom of that mountain, we had a road walk to get us through a residential area and headed toward Bear Mountain. In a parking area just before the climb began, a man got out of his truck and asked if we were thru-hikers. He was just about to setup some trail magic. He and his wife were up from Georgia and had been following and slackpacking their son for a few weeks. We chatted with him for a bit. It was just what we needed before our first climb.The climb up Bear Mountain was setup really well. It went up gently for a bit, then flattened out, then up gently, then flattened out until we hit the summit of 2,312 feet. It was the highest peak we'd been over since the Priest in Virginia. The approach to the top of Bear Mountain (I have always suspected that a treeless, rock topped mountain called ""Bear"" was supposed to be ""Bare Mountain"" but someone thought that was too scandalous) was vertical ledges that the trail followed, edged by bushes. You couldn't miss the trail and it was pretty easy to hike along. At the summit was a huge pile of rocks that was obviously man-made. Of course we climbed up and enjoyed a fantastic view all around. We could see the two peaks we're climbing tomorrow. We also ran into Bullshit and Eyore, who we hadn't seen since they went into NYC.The descent down Bear Mountain was another story. All the accounts in FarOut made it sound a little nerve racking. It was definitely a steep rock scramble down. You just have to pick your line, sometimes use your hands and maybe even pitch your poles down first to get down a section. When we reached the bottom of the climb, we started along a creek in an area called Sages Ravine. It was primeval in its beauty. The sides were steep and fern covered. The sun came in and reflected off the small waterfalls that cascaded down through the ravine, moss covered rocks, and pools. It was stunning and one of the wonderful surprises that make hiking the trail special. It helps you forget the misery of sweating and struggling up a big hill in 90 degree heat with no reward of a view.We have tent platforms at our campsite again tonight, as welll as a picnic table. It’s nice to have a flat, clean surface to setup.","Limestone Spring Shelter

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655616,"It's amazing what being clean and getting a good night's sleep can do for our spirits. Since Pappa Jo, the shuttle driver, was not picking us up until a leisurely 8:00, Bob walked next door to the McDonald's to bring back some breakfast. 
We hiked around some pastures for about a mile before we started the inevitable morning climb. Towns are most often mean either a road or a river, both of which are usually located in a valley between mountains. That means a big down to get in and a big up to get out, fully loaded with the weight of several days of resupply. We passed up and around large rock outcrops. The trail was routed through a very narrow passage between two rocks that we barely squeaked through and then it took a sharp turn to the left and down so we had to hug the rock or fall off the ledge....more choice words for the trail planners. Then, we hiked past a tall rock wall that we dubbed the ""hanging gardens of the Berkshires."" It was at least a twenty foot wall of rock with moss growing on the surface and ferns growing from cracks and crevices all the way up. We thought it was beautiful. Just beyond that, we saw something more beautiful. In FarOut, it's referred to as ""Ice Gulch."" It is a very deep ravine in a conifer forest where the depth and shade makes conditions where there can still be ice and snow at the bottom into the late spring or early summer. It was one of the most beautiful views we have seen so far. It was eerie and beautiful and one of those places that a photograph can never capture. We have been trying to carry less water during the day to save weight. It has been easier due to the increase in reliable water sources. This means we have to stop in the middle of the day to filter some. We stopped today at a good source so Bob bent down on a rock to scoop our water collection bladder. The nice rock he was standing on, which appeared stable was not. He made a good save, tho. Instead of falling in when he lost his balance, he jumped and landed in the stream with both feet. This wasn't the first time he'd unintentionally gotten his feet wet while getting water. Fortunately, his shoes dry quickly. The rest of the afternoon was the usual ups and downs. The worst part was the mosquitos and the biting horse flies. They seem to be particularly ravenous in Massachusetts. As we neared our shelter, we heard some thunder start to rumble, as was hinted in the last weather forecast. We made it to the shelter and chose a flat tent site.....that didn't have the dead tree looming over it. Everything was setup and covered before the rain started. We sat in the shelter and cooked our ramen and Spam with two other guys who had come in. The rain only last for about and hour or so, but it came down pretty hard. There was a river of water in front of the shelter. Our tent stayed dry (yay!) but one of the guys had setup in a bad spot and his tent bottom got soaked. He's sleeping in the shelter tonight.","Travelodge, Great Barrington, MA

Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655617,"Nothing much dried out overnight so we packed up wet. It rained so hard last night that we could see the evidence of the rivers of water on the trail. The fallen leaves get pushed to the side and the dirt looks washed clean. 
It was muggy to start and the mosquitos were out in force. The hiking was more of the same, ups and downs. There were boardwalks across swampy areas, and some cushy pine needles in other areas.We pushed this afternoon to get to our destination early, which is hard on both body and spirit. Upper Goose Pond cabin is an old family cabin, built in the 30's that is now owned by the Appalachian Mountain Club of western Massachusetts. It has a living room with rockers, a table and chairs, and a fireplace, as well as 14 bunks upstairs for hikers. We wanted two of these bunks because it is forecast for rain again tonight. It sits right next to a large pond (the size of a lake, really) where you can go swimming or borrow one of two canoes and paddle around. Bob took full advantage and went for a swim off the dock. The fish even nibbled on his toes. I just dangled my feet in (because my beloved merino takes too long to dry) There is tenting here, too. We heard the caretaker say that he has 35 people here tonight. There is always a volunteer caretaker here during hiker season, who stays for a week at a time. Vlobster is the caretaker this week. He drives in from Rochester, NY to do this. He told us he'll be up early to make fresh coffee and fresh blueberry pancakes in the morning. The southbounders bring him blueberries from the Cookie Lady, who has a farm further north on the trail. After we ate dinner, we sat in the rockers on the front porch and wished we had scheduled a zero here.","North Mt. Wilcox shelter 
",Upper Goose Pond Cabin,"Jul 29, Fri",15
Captain Video & Wild Hair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655618,"We slept well in the bunk room. It never did rain. There were even four or five empty bunks because, as one hiker told us, at this point they are all done with bunk rooms and shelters and would rather tent. Lvobster had coffee and blueberry pancakes done and ready by 5:30 AM. We were all spread out over the inside table, the porch, and the picnic table enjoying them. The cabin was such a special place and a real gift on the trail. We had to leave Upper Goose Pond way earlier than we wanted but we had a long day ahead of us. It was a half a mile blue blaze trail to get to the cabin from the actual AT, which seemed much longer than that when we arrived last night. Today was cooler than it's been which was a real help. It stayed in the 70's all day. We hiked through a beautiful pine forest almost all day. We had a few smaller ups and downs, which made our almost eighteen mile day seem more manageable. We have been playing hiker hopscotch with another group of hikers we have met on and off, Salad, Good News, and her brother, Trumpet, and Jeopardy. We had heard Trumpet playing his actual trumpet at one of the previous shelters, but never actually saw him. They'd stop for a break and we'd pass them, then we'd stop and they'd pass us.We had slowed a bit because everyone was ahead of us. We had heard about this must-stop place called the Cookie Lady. We weren't going to stop because we thought it would take too much time on this long day. We did end up stopping because it coincidenced with a packs off break. That was a good decision. The Cookie Lady is really a family that owns a pick your own blueberry farm, but have a little oasis for AT hikers. They great hikers with hibiscus lemonade and homemade chocolate chip cookies. They have chairs, a hammock, a water spigot, and three friendly golden retrievers all in their shady lawn. We found all the hikers we've seen for the past few days all relaxing there when we arrived. We tore ourselves away from the comroderie and began our last leg of the day. A few miles later, we came to a short, steep rocky incline. We jealously watched some younger hikers spring up the rocks ahead of us. As Bob started the climb, one of his knees decided to strongly protest. He had been having some soreness for a while, even cramping, but this time it was much more painful. We carefully got him up the incline but he was limping. We tried to hike toward the shelter for the night, but after about a mile, he had to sit down on a log. It was becoming apparent that Bob's knee was done for the year. We had passed a couple who had given us a hard time about the size of our packs (we couldn't possibly be thru-hikers with packs that big). They lived very close and the woman was hiking back to their house. She asked if we were OK and offered to help. Bob couldn't make the three miles to the shelter over two more low peaks and it was only a mile back to her car. These wonderful trail angels, Cindy and Greg, ended up driving us to a hotel in a nearby town. It turns out that Greg is an Appalachian Mountain Club volunteer and helps maintain the shelter we were headed for.So here we sit in a hotel in Pittsfield, MA with a decision to make. We have a 2,000+ foot peak to go over, then the famous 3,400 foot Mt. Greylock. Today, we had just passed the 800 mile mark for this leg of our AT journey. If we stop here, it would only be about 25 short of our plan. The end of this year's hike was more abrupt that we had planned but i guess we can live with that.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin
