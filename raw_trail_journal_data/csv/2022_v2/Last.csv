Last,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658299,"I have sorted and resorted everything.  Still looks like I am going to be carrying too much like every hike.  Food is the biggest challenge.  I am unable to cram everything into my designated food bag.  It will fit, just going to be a challenge like for everyone getting 5 days of food into a 13L bag.  It works most of the time for me and after some crunching I'll get it all in eventually.  I went with gooey items instead of crunchy so it will all mash and still be edible.  Still have to make that last grocery run for tortillas.  I remember John McClellan's (age 13) view that you can never have enough tortillas with you.  For a weekend hike he would carry at least 20, but it seemed to be at least 40.  He used to eat them at just about every rest stop. Probably lighter than the dutch oven and charcoal he carried to be able to make cinnamon rolls on the trail with.  I'll ship my second food box to the Hostel Around the Bend for my final resupply to get me through Georgia.  I see the weather forecast is for highs of 70 and lows of 46.  Should be ideal hiking weather.  Hurricane Ian will pass through a day before I start.  All of the springs should be recharged.  Hopefully the ground will dry out and the trail won't be too muddy.  All part of the experience I guess.",,View Entry,"Sep 26, Mon",0
Last,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658305,Hoping I can get it all in my pack in 7 days. Still have to add my sleeping bag. Can’t wait to get to Mountain Crossings. Hopefully then can help me shave some weight off. Nope I am not shaving even though it just keeps getting longer and heavier.,,View Entry,"Sep 26, Mon",0
Last,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658454,Managed to get everything sorted out. I am starting off at 18.3 pounds without food or liquids. Unfortunately my first food bag weighs 9 pounds. That is for 5 days so not unreasonable just heavy. Total load out weight 31 pounds. Everything sure does add up. Ready and excited to get up at 3:30 am for my flight. Sure beats getting up for work.,,View Entry,"Oct 01, Sat",0
