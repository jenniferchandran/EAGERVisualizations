Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653000,Most all items are ready to go.  Been a struggle going back and forth between a sleeping pad and tarp versus the hammock due to concerns about mosquitos with all the rain in VT and NH.  Finally settled on hammock.  Upped the weight in pack by about 1 pound.  But comfort and no mossies are better deal. Hoping the gym training last couple of months will pay off for first week until I get some legs back under me.Travel to NYC and then White River Junction via Amtrak on Thursday 16 and Friday 17.  Start from NH/VT border Saturday morning the 18th.  Using A Garmin InReach Mini 2 for the first time.  Family wants some comfort in knowing the bears have not gotten me on any one day.  Hope I have figured out how to use it properly.,,View Entry,"Jun 14, Tue",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653041,"Another foray into the ""wild"".  Pack is ready at 28 lbs, minus water.  Still too much stuff.  Eat fast and eat often.  Only way to drop the weight.Yesterday on the way from Roan Mountain area, we saw a bear run across the road as we were entering Unicoi,TN.  Guess he was sampling local trash cans because he was right in the edge of housing/businesses.  Long and lean, eating machine!!!!!!!!!0700 train station appointment for ride from Savannah to NYC.",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Wed",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653140,Sitting in NYC awaiting final leg of Amtrak to Hanover. Tonight at Hanover Adventure Tours hostel for sleep and rest. 15 hours on train yesterday and 12 hours waiting last night this morning with little sleep. I AM ALIVE! we shall see if I brought enough gear to stay warm next few nights. Expecting high 40’s to low 50’s.,,View Entry,"Jun 17, Fri",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653214,"Today started well. Out of hostel at Hanover Adventure Tours around 0815 via shuttle to bridge crossing. Up town in Norwich to secure a new gas canister for the stove. Amtrak frowns on carrying that stuff. 14.1 mile day planned. Cool , cloudy , and windy all day. Felt like snow weather with temps in 50’s. But good hiking temps,First 8 miles were a challenge but trail was in great shape so movement was steady. Had to stop on the uphills as usual. Looks like I needed more gym work.  Then the hike went to crap. A long, steep downhill into the White River valley started working on my left knee. By the time I got to the bottom, I was done. Better to stop and treat the knee before I cause real damage. So I called several folks and Hostel came to drag my sorry butt back to safety.Looks like tomorrow will be a longer day than I had planned, provided the knee holds out.  “It ain’t easy”— so they tell me.Might take up biking on the flatlands!!!!!","VT/NH border

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653300,"Glory Be, Look at me with the bum knee. Did something I thought I would never do —- slack packed today. Knee stood up but had to wrap it tight. Still getting twinges on downhills. Otherwise, the trail was ups and owns as usual. Some good sections, some bad. Trail has not been maintained in a while. Overgrown with weeds and brush in most areas today. Not sure which trail club maintains this area but they are remiss in getting trail open.
Trail legs are days away. Lots of soreness tonight. Taking tomorrow off to get a brace for the knee and rest that thing.
The plus side is that this is a great hostel. The shuttle folks are fantastic in getting me back and forth. Recommend staying here.","White River Crossing

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653431,"Took the day off to rest the knee, do some shopping for food, etc.
Spent the day talking with various hikers. Enjoyable day kicking back.
Knee seems better. Picked up a knee brace for future use as needed.
Shuttling tomorrow to point near Gifford Woods State Park to meet my buddy Achin.","Hanover Hostel

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653435,"Shuttled to River Road, just north of Kent Pond and the state park. Hiked in the 2.2 miles across a beautiful boardwalk for a few hundred feet to start. Then around Kent Pond to VT 100 road crossing. After talking with park staff, I managed to wander off looking for hiker camp sites in the wrong direction. No signs. Finally came back to start point and staff says “over there”. Still no signs. Found a spot and set up at 1300. Went to post office to collect my credit card from mail drop. Lunch at deli next door. Half- mile back over the hill to the park. This is Boring!
Achin arrived at 1545 after having been given bum advice on trail to park. Rain arrives at 1800 (approx) and rains until midnight. At least it shut up the baying hound in next site.
Having fun in the mud and roots!!!!","Hanover Hostel

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653436,"Got out of site at 0730 for an early start. Started today with clouds and some chance of drizzle. Light climb over first hill out of state park. Headed to junction with Long Trail at Maine Junction. Rain comes and goes in light showers. Part way there Achin says he might want to go home. I say NO. We get a couple of beers and move on. He wrestles with his heart for a little while and decided he is not into going on. So we head to US Route 4 and flag the local bus to Rutland.
Afternoon spent with a good lunch and getting clean at the Yellow Deli. Fantastic place.
Tomorrow brings a new challenge for me.","Gifford Woods Statr Park

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653490,"Started the day with a sore throat and chest congestion and dry cough. Scheduled visit to doc-in-a-box(Urgent Care).
Had breakfast with Achin and others at hostel before walking about a mile to see about med issues. Arrived 0845, saw PA at 1030(?). Hooray! Covid test was negative.Got prescriptions and caught local bus to near Walgreens. Arrived there at 1145 just as rain started. Sat until meds were ready at 1245. Crossed over highway to 5-Guys for burger and fries. Hiked back to Yellow Deli and Hostel. Achin caught Amtrak back to NYC at 1230.
Another Boring Day not on the trail. Tomorrow morning’s gut check- better from bronchitis or waste another day for recovery? 
Stay tuned for another chapter of a tale of woe!!! Jin","Rutland, VT

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653531,"Another day of congestion and cough. No energy for climbing as lungs still feel tight. More pills today and some decongestant to try and break the airways open.  Took second covid test (more capability to detect), results by Monday or Tuesday.  Spent rest of the day resting and making decision for tomorrow on hiking or going home.  Do not seem to be making any headway on getting better.Fortunately there is an Amtrak station in Rutland (who knew), a  pleasant surprise.  This has been a bummer of a trip so far.
I hate sitting on my rear end when I need to be moving forward!! I could be more graphic, but I refrain as it would be of no use.Decided at 1800 to call this thing off.  Got train tickets for Saturday and Sunday.","Rutland VT

As usual, will be stuck in Penn Station overnight until 0600 connection.  Cough has gotten worse and deeper.  Not feeling this trip at all.
Bummed out is the least I can say about this trip. There is always another opportunity to return and face the punishment of the mountains. Baa Humbug!","Rutland , VT

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653722,"Spent the night ""under the stars"" of Penn Station on the ""hard"" seats.  ""Nice"" 12 hours. At least it is a safe environment with Amtrak police and controlled entrances.  And a couple of food places stay open all night. Yea!!!!Bought and finished one novel overnight.  Caught the ""Pametto"" at 0602 which left on time for a change.  Then lost 20 minutes in Washington as one car did not have working AC.  Downhill on schedule for there on.  By the time we got to Savannah, we were 1 hour and 40 minutes behind, which Amtrak kept reminding us by sending out texts to that affect.  Thank you very much but most of us can count.My brother saved me from further issues by collecting me at 2320 (1120 pm) and delivered me to my doorstep.  To bed, to bed, to bed.","Penn Station, NYC - ""Under the Stars""

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653720,"Karma or Bad JuJu.  Call it what you will but this has been a trip from hades!  Not sure what I did a or when I did it but I promise I won't do it again.
Should have known right from start that something was off --- left my credit card home and had to have it sent express service to me on the trail.  Received said card and same night started with sinus issues which progressed downward the next day into my chest.  Hummm!
The next day my hiking buddy decided his heart was not in this hike on his first day back on the trail. He got caught up in my bad Karma.  But I've been where he was and understand completely.  In fact last year the same thing happened to me when we were hiking in MA.  3.3 miles hiked and back to town.  Another sign?????  Spent next 2 days in hostel trying to conquer this bug.  Meds from Doc-in-the-Box did not deter the infection.  So it was time to call the hike and get home.
Where does one go from here?  Seems like all that early training and effort to get to the trail has been wasted. I still have a big chunk of trail from lower MA thru VT that is not finished.  And then there is the big monster waiting in New Hampshire.  I think I am done with airlines and Amtrak for travel.  Probably another driving trip for any further trail adventures.  Long way, but at least I would have some control on time and places - Biden's petroleum war be dammed!!!!!
More to come as I find more to vent on!  Not correct grammar but I DON""T CARE!
