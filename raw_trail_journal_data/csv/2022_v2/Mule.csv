I awoke this morning and the first thing I did was go get my food bag from the bear hang and made a coffee.  The world just seems better after a coffee.  I had light conversation with Sugar High and Captain Ass Pack, a good start I’d say.  The shelter is at over 5000 feet so the temperatures and winds are no joke.  RP and I left camp around 8:30 and proceeded up Mount Buckley our first 6000 footer.  On the way up the trail was narrow and worn as deep as 2 feet in some spots, sections of it was filled with leaves so we had to be careful with each step as we didn’t know what our foot was landing on.  As we got closer to the peak white chunks was falling from the sky, i thought it was ash from some of the fires. I reached out and caught one in my hand, it was a frozen square of snow.  Some were an inch long.We arrived at Clingmans Dome around 12:30 the highest peak on the AT, 6658 feet.  Normally the road up would’ve been open for the season and the place would’ve been packed; however, the road was closed due to construction.  Me and RP had the place to ourselves when we arrived.  The tower up has a long ramp that circles as it lifts higher and higher, it reminds me of the Flintstones cartoon I used to watch when I was a kid.  The Smokies has beat the hell out of RP and I, the descent from Clingmans Dome to Newfound Gap punished our bodies. Prior to the Smokies I hadn’t taken any Tylenol, I was pumping it in me for two days.  When we got to Newfound Gap we had lost over 1500 feet of elevation and had to climb back up to 6000 feet to get to our shelter 2.9 miles away.  As we crossed US 441 there was a large gathering on the lawn of hikers at a mobile home with a table full of food and soda.  It was emotional we were beat to hell and for the first time since entering North Carolina we had trail magic. As soon as we walked up to the table the Angel opened up two chairs for us and asked us if we’d like a hot dog, I was speechless.  I didn’t put anything on it.  I ate the dog and bun in three bites. I then proceeded to eat oranges, bananas, power bars, peanut butter crackers, soda and numerous candy bars and more hot dogs.  The trail angel that provided all this magic is a 2020 thru hiker, he drove 600 miles to be at Gatlinburg Gap to feed his fellow hikers, 600 miles!!  Me and RP looked at each and realized we weren’t going any further and decided to get a shuttle into Gatlinburg to rest our worn out bodies. When we arrived we each ordered an extra large pizza and two litters of Pepsi.  Tomorrow we will strategize on the last 32 miles of the Smokies.  The trail dose not change or adapt to you, you change and adapt.

We have a lot in common and there's a lot to talk about to pass the miles by.  We're both 61, retired, and from NE. 
About two miles from the hostel we met Steady coming towards us, she had a look on her face that something bad was going on. She was heading to the hostel to get a ride to the hospital.  She fell last night and hurt her forearm.  After a night at the shelter and experiencing a lot of pain she needed it checked.  I hope she's ok.
The challenge of the day was Unaka Mt.  You could see frozen ice across the top of the trees from the distance.  It was cold with a fair amount of wind but full sunshine by noon time.
Overall Ranger and I did pretty well pushing the miles out, we're both experiencing the same type of heel pain.  After consulting with my favorite nurse back home I'm pretty sure it's bone spur that I have.  We went to Walgreens yesterday and bought some socks with built in gel pads and a few other things to add cushion.  It seemed to help today,  its about pain management and tolerance.  It just a nagging annoying pain at this point.  No complaints I'm just journaling my experience.

I also replaced my Katadyn water filter, it held up good for about 400 miles, it slowed down a lot and the bladder sprung a leak so I have a new one.
Today's mileage flowed along the Creeper trail much of the way.  You can rent bicycles and coast for several miles along the river without peddling - it's supposed to be a great ride.
Ranger Randy and I have various conversations through-out the day, we’re both the same age so we talk about music, cars, military service and of course our families. 
Today we took it to another level, the Ranger offered me a stick of gum and of course I was glad to take it.  I told him that at home my wife doesn't allow me to chew gum within 20 yards of her because I make so much noise!  He laughed and told me his wife yells at him too when he chews gum.  We held this conversation for at least 20 minutes, laughing and making chomping noises.  
Something as simple as chewing gum can take on a life of its own out here.

I thought after 500 miles I’d reflect on some of my experience so far for all those following.  It’s my experience and my opinion.
The AT is everything I imagined and more.  When you experience what you’ve read it takes on a much deeper meaning.  I can’t say I’ve had a bad experience, some were just better than others.  Your fellow hikers are what makes walking so good, no matter what your feeling they’re going thru it too and a sense of  camaraderie develops.  The end of the day at camp is when everyone shares experiences - it takes your mind off of most of the pain and gives you the ability to get up and do it again.
Trail names:  People ask me how I got Mule?  The simple answer is my wife gave it to me when we backpacked the Long Trail.  She was recovering from an injury so I carried most of the gear, so she told me I was her pack mule.  We shortened it to Mule, as it turns out the name fits me, I’m slow, strong and stubborn.  
Some trail names are obvious while others require a full explanation.  For example, Beast, Rocket and Happy Camper are obvious, just spend a few minutes with them or watch them hike and you know why they have that name. On the other hand, RP, Ranger Randy, Birthday Sandwich and Garfield require some conversation.
The weather:  You have no control over the weather but you can manage yourself and your day to make yourself a little dryer and warmer.  For example, if the nighttime rain ends at 9am I personally may wait until it passes before I pack up and move.  In the afternoon if rain is expected to start at 5pm I may get to camp by 4pm and get set up before it starts.  Sometimes you just have to hike thru it.  I’ve hiked in rain, snow, wind, cold and heat - it’s just what it is.
Equipment:  For the most part all the research I did before my hike paid off.  I also trained with the equipment before starting, it makes a difference.  I tried to go with ultra light (UL) equipment.  UL has reduced my pack weight by 10-12 pounds which makes a significant difference out here.  I also eliminated the “just in case items” from my gear.  Before Mt Rogers and the Highlands I mailed three pounds of clothing home, I took a risk doing that but I got thru with good weather.  Right now with four days of food and a liter of water my pack is about 26 pounds.  When you start in Georgia they weigh your pack and if it’s over 45 pounds they review it with you in the back room and try to get you lighter.  I saw a pack at over 70 pounds!  
Hostel’s:  They are part of the economy on the AT and can be a wonderful, comfortable experience or they can be uncomfortable and a bit strange.  A good hostel is welcoming, clean, has shuttle service and a good resupply.  My personal favorite so far is Natures Inn.  My least is Uncle Johnnies in Erwin, Tennessee - it’s run down, one of the cabins had termites flying around dropping their wings and the shuttle driver was rude and a jerk!  Several hikers had to walk back from town because they didn’t meet his deadline for pick up.  They couldn’t meet it because the restaurant didn’t have enough help to get them fed in time.  There’s a new owner, I hope he makes serious improvements as the hostel is located on the trail as you come into Erwin, so it’s needed.
Where I’m at now I have the whole place to myself I don’t even know where the owners are.  It’s different and not for everyone, as advertised it’s a place of spiritual advancement, no alcohol, drugs or tobacco.  That eliminates a lot of potential customers, but it’s their choice and works for me.
The trail so far has made me more social, more polite and more willing to be around people with a variety of lifestyles and views.  I’ve also been able to turn off the noise. I haven’t watched TV in weeks or read a newspaper, all I have to do is hike and take care of my basic needs, food, water and shelter.  I couldn’t do it without the support of my beautiful wife Judy back home and my two sons Corey and Justin.  
It’s been said “the trail provides” it sure has thus far and I have no reason to think it won’t continue.Living the DreamMule","Sufi Lodge

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650119,"Last night at the hostel I was the only guest.  The owner made me the best meal I've had since being on the trail!  Salad, homemade lentil soup, a juicy steak with two baked potatoes, sour cream, butter and homemade bread - It was wonderful.  This morning she made me a mound of scrambled eggs from their backyard chickens and a stack of pancakes.  
I barely ate today on the trail which is very unusual for me.
A few days ago I developed a cold so it was tough going today.  I'm not sure if I got it in the shelters or a hostel.  I'm staying out of both for a while so I don't give it to anyone.  Tonight I'm about 50 yards off the trail all alone and I hope it stays that way.
I hiked past the Rogers Visitor Center today but it was closed which was too bad because they have soda machines inside and I wanted one.  They must've had a training going on as the parking lot was full of cars.  They were nice enough to put an extension cord and plug out the window so hikers could charge their phones.
When I realized you couldn't tent nearby I filled up my water bottles and hiked another couple miles to set up camp.
Ranger Randy is pulling away and RP is closing in.  Both are pushing bigger miles then me - we will see how things unfold in the next few weeks.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650222,"Last night I had an old abandoned stealth site to myself.  I had a camp fire and enjoyed the silence. 
Since entering Virginia I've noticed the trail has changed, a lot of rocks are on the trail and foot placement is crucial.  The oak trees are magnificent. My neck is sore from looking up at them, they're huge and straight.
I hiked into Atkins in the afternoon. My first stop was  the gas station. I had a large Gatorade and a pint of vanilla ice cream.  Then I hiked .3 miles to the Alpaca Farm, It's also a hostel. There were a few hikers there that I knew. The place is real nice, new bunkhouse and showers.  Some of the hikers stayed for three days!  I got out of there before I stayed.  On the way out of town I stopped at a second gas station and had a honey bun and a coffee.  
It was a six mile hike to the stealth site and there was no water along the way.  Today is sunny and hot, by the three mile mark I was out.
Two slack packers approached me going south, one of them was Sprite, I hadn't seen her since Damascus it was great chatting with her.  It was just what I needed to get me through the last two miles.
At camp I had two deer walking around my tent eating away.  I moved slow towards them as I recorded their movement - they didn't seem to care that I was there. I was within 10 feet at one point.  That would never happen up North.
A nice couple doing a section hike set up their tent at the site.  Noodle and Agent Orange are their trail names.  It should be a nice night.Living the DreamMule","Stealth Camp Site

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650265,"I hiked out of camp this morning at 0730.  The past few days we’ve seen 80* temperatures.  I find myself drinking more and more water.
The farmer’s fields that I’ve been hiking thru are stunningly beautiful, they’re vast and seem to go on for a half mile. The grass is green an already approaching a foot in length.  You follow a foot wide path with post strategically located with the famous white blaze painted on them.  Fresh cattle manure waits for you to take your eye off where you step.  Along the edge of the field you see beautiful dog wood trees and apple blossoms in bloom.  I passed a large old farmhouse that had a huge patch of lilacs in bloom.
The first road I came to had a sign for the Quarter Way Hostel.  It advertised everything that temps a hungry, ragged hiker.  I was proud of myself I didn’t give in and kept going.
Then I came to the sign for Bear Garden Hostel and turned off the trail towards it like a heat seeking missile (I’m weak), within a few minutes I was drinking Pepsi and eating ice cream.  One thing led to another and here I stayed for the day.  Showered and did laundry.  A couple from Wisconsin came in and the afternoon was spent talking about the trail and equipment.  Several hikers have stopped in today for refreshments and went on their way.  By late afternoon the bunks filled up and tents took over the yard.  
Several hikers were planning to take the Bear Garden Challenge tomorrow.  They leave there heavy pack here and the hostel shuttles them out in the morning, they slack pack back a full marathon 26.2 miles.  When they arrive the owner bakes them a cake or pie - rarely will they share it!
We’re waiting for two hikers to return from this morning’s slack. 
I wonder if they’ll share?Living the DreamMule","Stealth Camp Site

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650377,"Last night we waited until after 9pm for the two slack packers to return. By the time they arrived we were all in bed.  
While we waited Timber and Timex fed me some grapes, carrots and an apple.  You can tell section hikers they try to maintain their healthy diets. It was good, but I'd rather of had a piece of cake.
By 0700 I was leaving the hostel.  Everything felt right for a big day of hiking, the weather, my energy, my mood.  I laid out a 20 miler which would be my first one.  It required carrying four liters of water in some parts, it was hot and dry.
The ATC had been advertising for miles that the Lick Creek Bridge was out and we'd have to ford it and possibly reroute if it was too high.
When I got there it was really no big deal. Hikers we're taking their shoes and socks off to cross.  I kept mine on and hiked through.  I felt there's a bigger chance hurting my feet with them off.  It actually felt refreshing.
Shortly after I met ATG (Appalachian Trail Gangsta) and Tumbler going up the Hill. We chatted briefly and all of a sudden the the song ""Tumbling Dice"" entered my head and I started singing it.  I'm not sure if The Rolling Stones or Linda Ronstadt wrote it but it was Linda's version going thru my head.  As far as I'm concerned when she sang it she was bringing it! Her voice was powerful and she was beautiful! For those reading this I hope you ask Alexa to play it - it stayed in my head all day.
When I arrived a Chestnut Knob Shelter it was beautiful, full sun, blue sky and for a while I had it all to myself.  I took off my shoes and socks and let them dry.  
Prior to getting there I had to fill four liters of water to get me at least 10 miles in the heat.  I was ridge hiking and there was nothing available.  
About 4.5 miles before my final destination I came to a road, there was someone waiting for his wife and daughter, Cara Bear and Mamma Bear.  I met them at the shelter.  He handed me an ice cold Gatorade - it was pure bliss.
After about 20 minutes I moved on and arrived at Jenkins Shelter.
It was my longest day at 22.2 miles. Overall I felt great, just tired feet.  I set up my tent, prepared food, stretched and crawled in my tent by 8:30.Living the Dream!Mule","Bear Garden Hiker Hostel

By 8am things had stopped enough to step off.  I hiked a short distance to a good water source and filtered two liters to carry. I also drank one liter - I like to start the day off with a full belly of water. 
I hiked about 4.5 miles out to Laurel Creek when someone yelled hey Mule how are you?  It was the owner of Bear Garden Hostel where I’d stayed two days ago.  He was dropping off five hikers. He asked me if I heard about the weather.  He told me heavy rain, thunderstorms, hail and tornado warnings!
He also told me by 2pm I needed to find shelter.  I was about seven miles from Bland VA so I could get a motel room if they were available.
The group started pushing towards Bland.  I couldn’t get phone service but I was able to push a text thru to my wife and asked her to book me a room.  When she texted back that I was all set a sense of relief came over me.
By noon time the wind was picking up on the ridge and I could feel thing’s changing.
At 1:30 I arrived at Brushy Mountain Outpost on US 52 in Bland.  I went inside and had a Brushy Burger (hamburger with a 1” thick piece of fried bologna) two chili dogs, french fries and two bottles of Pepsi.
By 2:30 me and Clause where riding in Bubba’s Shuttle to the motel.  It’s a nice place and I’m grateful to have it.

At 0545 this morning I stepped outside my motel room to use my cook stove to make coffee.  It was just starting to lighten up outside.  The motel sits high on a hill and overlooks two highways and the Circle K gas station, the world was coming to life. 
Already outside was Bugs having his morning cigarette.  I knew he was a hiker just by looking at him. We exchanged trail names and stories.  By 0715, Bugs, Crow, Fin and I were in Bubba’s shuttle back to the Outpost.
The weather has changed big time from two days ago 80* and humid to this mornings temp of 40* and dry.  I started out in a t-shirt, within a quarter of a mile I put on long sleeves and gloves.
The trail is busy today, it seems everyone either came in from the storm or held up in a shelter for the past two days.
I started to hear stories from those that were in the downpours.  One hiker told how he was about two miles from the shelter when it opened up, within minutes the trail was overwhelmed with water above his ankle - he ran to the shelter only to find it packed!  He did all he could to set his tent up in the downpour. Another hiker said her dog curled up on the side of the trail and refused to move, as if to tell her master, time to den up!
There was a group of 12-15 hikers moving thru todays trail, leapfrogging each other throughout the day.  Everyone seems to be in a 20-24 mile range per day at this point.
It was interesting to observe people in front of me today.  Everyone seems so efficient with their hiking now compared to when we started in Georgia.  Everyone seems to flow with less effort and energy.  Hiking poles and stride work together.  As the rear pole pushes off the front pole glides forward from the wrist like a pendulum of a clock.  There’s only one foot and one pole on the ground at a time while the other two are moving into place.  
As I’m making this observation I don’t even realize that I’m hiking - this is the best part for me, moving the body and not realizing it.  
The trail conditions we’re good today, I had 18 miles in by 3:30, I felt I could’ve done over 20; however, food is my weakness and the Weary Feet Hostel was just around the corner.  I weighed my options, tuna out of a package and instant potatoes…or a home cooked meal?  I turned off the trail.  Within minutes I had a plate of potatoes, green beans, Salisbury steak, gravy, rolls and ice tea.  I ate it on a farmers porch overlooking a meadow that leads down to the river.
Before I could finish it, Julie the owner asked me if I’d like seconds?  Just think I could’ve had instant potatoes!  A few minutes later she offered me dessert.  I couldn’t make up my mind between banana pudding or strawberry short cake.  Julie said don’t worry you can have both!

It's one of the oldest hostels on the trail.
The weather was beautiful today, sunshine, blue sky's and dry air. 
The best part of today's hike was when I emerged from the woods to the road that leads to the hostel there was trail magic.  True, a 2019 thru hiker and his sister Shannon were serving steak and cheese subs!  I couldn't believe!  True is from Chicago and these subs were the real deal.  I had a coke with the sub, then he asked me if i'd like another one?  I didn't want to be rude and say no.  So two subs and two cokes later I was on my way.

At 6am the large coffee pot was brewing on the farmers porch.  A tray of coffee cups made by the owner, Neville waited to be filled, by 6:30 I poured the first cup.  I watched the sunrise from this spot while Neville picked fresh greens from the garden.
Breakfast was served at 8am.  The meal was homemade breads, oatmeal, with homemade yogurt, peach apple crisp, fruit salad and orange juice…the greens ended up in the scrambled eggs.  This was the best nine dollar investment I ever made.
I didn’t get on the trail until 9am but I managed to put together some good miles.  
Along the ridges the vast views are incredible - everything is green.  Huge bumble bees are all along the trail.  The water isn’t as plentiful in Virginia so you have to carry more to stay hydrated.
When I get to the main road that leads into Pearisburg, Virginia I notice a few groups of hikers hanging out.  Trail Days in Damascus is this Friday-Sunday and most of them are going so they can’t decide whether to hang around and catch the shuttle or hike on.
I don’t plan on going, I’d rather hike so my decision is easy, I hike on.  I have a feeling the trail will be quiet for the weekend.  An early sign is the shelter tonight only has three of us and no tents.

The weather has been wonderful this week, hot and sunny.  After tomorrow it changes to cloudy and then rain for a few days.  It can be miserable but it's a lot cooler and you can do bigger miles.  
Several of the hikers that I've been hiking with got dropped off 25 miles ahead north and slack packed back to Pearisburg today.  It was a good way to get some miles in while waiting for Trail Days.
I met Spicoli today sitting on a rock resting waiting for a friend.  He was slack packing.  He pulled out a bag of Pepperidge Farms cheese fish.  He opened it up and shared it with me.  He poured half the bag in my two hands - they were delicious!
We talked trail talk as hikers do, particularly how the hiking has turned into a mental game at this point.  It seems once you clear Damascus you have your trail legs, your knee's have been tested, and if your physically intact you know your body can handle it.  
Now can you keep your head in the game, on the trail, take what the trail gives you day after day.  
I can honestly say my attitude is good, my legs are strong and I move forward.  I'm learning little tricks to help me everyday.  I feel like I belong out here and I flow with the other hikers.  
I stopped at the first shelter to rest and have a snack - pop tarts and coffee.  I met a couple of Lashes (Long Ass Section Hikers).  Two of them gave me good info on Daleville, Virginia which is my next scheduled stop Sunday or Monday.  The best source of info always comes from other backpackers.
Arrived at Bailey's Cap Shelter around 4:30 but decided to call it a day.  It was a long hot climb to get here so I'm content to set up with McLovern in the shelter.  Juke Box set up his tent nearby. It appears it could be another quiet evening.Living the DreamMule","Rice Field Shelter

I hiked a few miles with McLovern today.  We’re both from Massachusetts and Former Marines so we have a lot to talk about.  He’s in his early 50’s and tall and lanky so he pulls away after a few miles.
I met back up with him and Wreck It at the first shelter for lunch and water.  When I stepped off again I walked right over a rattlesnake as it went between my feet!  I never saw it until it was too late.  It didn’t seem to care.  I tried to encourage it to leave the trail as Wreck It was about 10 minutes behind me.  It didn’t hiss but the tail was moving rapidly.  I finally got it to move and I moved on - it was about three feet long.
At 14 miles I arrived at the second shelter.  I almost stayed but I decided to push to the Sarver, just over 21 miles.  
I entered over two miles of farmers fields that crossed a road into more fields.  I’ve never seen such beautiful and massive fields in my life as I have in Virginia.  I’m talking with Mountain Tuna at the shelter tonight, he’s from Virginia.  He told me those belong to generations of the same families. They take great pride in there upkeep.  We’re fortunate to be able to hike thru them.

Everyone is wet and we stink.  The guy beside me snored during the night - my ear plugs did little to block his volume.
I intentionally went slow this morning so I’d make myself slow down, I need an easy slow day.
I was the last to leave camp, there are several stealth spots along the .3 miles back to the AT.  Two women were breaking camp, one was shaking the rain off her tent while she had a tooth brush in her mouth.  She yelled something to me but I couldn’t understand what she said, but I sensed she was saying good morning.
There was a lot of ledge hiking this morning, it reminded me of the White Mountains, it was difficult and dangerous.  At one point I stopped to drink some water when a hiker named Bart caught up to me and told me he just fell, his shoulder and arm took the impact but he was ok.  We’re both using a Zpack backpack so we talked about the pros/cons of it.  He’s already hiked the PCT and the CDT, the AT will complete his Triple Crown!  
As he stepped off another hiker Sir (73 years old) caught me next - he just slipped too.  His elbow and shin were bleeding.  He kept going past me, I followed him for awhile to make sure he was ok.
I worked my way down the cliffs and rocks slowly and methodically so I didn’t fall.  I met several day hikers coming up trail they looked so clean and they smelled good.  They literally smelled good - I sniffed the air as they walked by!  I bet they didn’t think I smelled so good.
When I arrived at Virginia 624 I took a right and headed to the hostel about .3 miles up the road.  Not a bad place it’s in a three car garage up on a hill above a farmhouse.
I dumped my pack out front and the owner drove up and said “I’m going to the store do you need a ride?”  Of course I took her up on her offer and jumped in the car. She put down all the windows as we drove away!
She dropped me off at the gas station where I picked up some resupply and ordered two cheeseburgers, fries, a pint of ice cream and a quart of Gatorade.

Not only do I love the smell I love the sound of the pot brewing.  Coffee is my drug of choice, it’s my mistress. (sorry I digressed).
I left the hostel at 0700, walked down the road and re-entered the AT.  I hiked about six miles to VA 311 in Catawba, Virginia to the parking lot for McAfee Knob - the most photographed spot on the AT.  
It’s a 3.9 mile climb to the Knob.  About .4 miles in I came to John’s Spring Shelter, I stopped there, filtered two bottles of water and had some food.  There was a few hikers still hanging out in the shelter from the night before. They didn’t seem to be in a hurry, when asked why they said they didn’t feel well and had diarrhea.  A sure sign of Nora-virus.  I usually sign the shelter log but I got the hell out of there as soon as I heard the symptoms!
With 3.5 miles to go to get to the top I was feeling good.  I usually cruise the first five or six miles in the morning then I stop and fuel up like I did at the shelter around 1030, when I do this my body gets another gear for 4-5 miles.
This is the best hiking of the day.  My body performs at its highest level.  My cardio system pumps oxygen filled blood into my quads and I go.  I feel young and strong.  
This 3.5 mile stretch showed me how fit and strong my hiking is - there were several day hikers going up to the Knob, I was passing them one by one effortlessly.  They were young in their 20’s or 30’s with a light day pack or none at all.
I wasn’t trying to pass them, I was just hiking, my body was performing at a high level.  Just before the top there were three young guys ahead of me, when I got within 10 feet I clicked my poles together and quietly asked them if I could pass?  They stepped aside and I blazed by them.  I heard one of them say “that old guys a thru hiker, see the tag on his bag”.
They were referring to my red AT hiker tag attached to my pack.  That tag is a badge of honor as you move thru the trail.
When I got to McAfee Knob it was crowded with day hikers posing for pictures.  This spot is everything you hear - and more.  The view is deep, long and wide.  The sky was filled with blue puffy white clouds and sun.
After leaving the Knob I hiked a few miles with Try Try and Sir.  We stopped at Pig Farm Campsite, had a snack and I had a coffee.
After the break I hiked on and ran into Yellowstone and Melody they were stopped along the trail talking.  Yellowstone showed me a picture of a big fat rattle snake he removed from the trail where I had just walked.
The final highlight of the day was the Tinker Cliffs.  This is .5 mile cliff walk with nothing but views along a 75-100 foot drop off.
I ended my day at Lambert’s Campsite. I set up far off on my own.  After awhile Troy came in and asked if he could camp with me, and of course I said yes.  A little while later Yellowstone came walking down and said you guys have a great spot I’m going to get my tent and join you.  Next thing you know he’s carrying his tent over his head down the trail, fully assembled, poles and all.  
Troy and Yellowstone we’re both Army helicopter pilots. We had a great camp tonight.  Try Try was in the Army and Sir was Navy, my day was spent with these wonderful people - I love veterans.

Troy and Yellowstone left before I did.  I wasn’t in a hurry I knew the 10 miles into Daleville would go quickly - the terrain was favorable according to FarOut and check in time for me at the hotel wasn’t until 3pm.
During the hike in we passed a Monolith, Hay Rock, cliffs and ledges.  All of which are large rock formations, if I was younger I would’ve climbed them.
As soon as I got to town I went into the first store and got a large Gatorade, a large bag of chips, a pint of vanilla ice cream and a large coffee.  I sat on the sidewalk with Mountain Tuna and shared the chips.  I mixed the hot coffee with the ice cream, it was terrific.
Then I crossed four lanes of traffic without getting killed over to the Super 8 and checked in.  Showered, washed clothes and rested for the remainder of the day.Living the DreamMule","Lambert’s Meadow Campsite, Sawmill Run

I walked to the post office this morning to get a package from home that had my Osprey backpack in it.  I’ve been going with an ultra light Zpack but I’ve missed the fit of my Osprey.  It weighs over two pounds more but I’ve mailed home winter gear and I have a much lighter quilt coming so I should be fine - either way when I put my Osprey on it was like seeing an old friend.
Daleville has all that a hiker needs on both sides of the highway, unfortunately there’s four lanes of traffic to cross.  I took care of everything on one side then ran across two lanes, stopped in the middle and ran across the other two when I thought I could beat the traffic (there’s no crosswalks)!
I went to a coffee shop for a real coffee then to Super Cuts for a haircut.  They don’t trim beards so I bought a comb.  
My next stop was the outfitters, I got a new stove, some fuel and a pair of shorts.
My final stop was Krogers for re-supply, I got four days of food and bought some fruit to take back to my room.
I spent the rest of the day working on equipment and staying off my feet.

The terrain looked favorable for an 18 miler today so that’s what I set my sights on.  I passed two shelters earlier in the day and stopped for water and snacks.  
It’s funny you hike all day alone but hikers are in front and behind you.  Once at the shelter they come rolling in one after the other.
There’s always small talk and introductions.  It’s really cool when someone appears that you haven’t seen in weeks.  I’ve been running into Shade a lot the past few days, I met her at the 100 mile mark and didn’t see her again until this week.  I met her father in the Grayson Highlands and hiked a little one day with him.
When I got to my destination today there were no tent sites to set up so I decided to move on, hoping there would be a spot to stealth.  I found one not too far away.

A group of four women day hiking passed me going south.  These ladies looked to be in their mid to late 70’s.  They were smiling as they walked by, they looked strong and very fit - I was impressed.
I stopped at the first shelter for some water and snacks when all of a sudden Claus came around the corner, fresh from Trail Days.  It was good to see him.  He got his trail name for climbing the chimney at one of the shelters in the Smokies.  Him and Shade cruise along the trail effortlessly.  They’re young, lean and tall - they can fly!
I hiked towards the second shelter, the humidity is starting to move in, the sweat was dripping from my elbows as I worked my way uphill.
I saw a hiker up ahead named Spider.  We chatted briefly and did the usual trail talk, what’s your name, where you from?  Today was his first day on this year, he was starting where he’d left off last year.  He had the look of someone starting out, winded, clean and didn’t have the stride.
When I came out to the road there were a few guys fishing in the river and a group gathered in the parking lot with Trail Magic!
You never know what you might get, I got Crispy Cream donuts for starters.  Coke, Gatorade, chips, Doritos, candy, crackers and good conversation.
After the Trail Magic I made my way to the Bryant Ridge Shelter it’s one of the largest shelters on the AT.  It has two decks and holds 20 people.  It’s beautifully built and built to last.  It was tempting to stay but the report from last night is the bugs are out and feeding on us smelly hikers.
I decided to move ahead to a tenting site around mile 16, if the water source was good I’d stay if not I’d go two more miles to the next shelter.
The water was slow but good, I filtered three liters and set up camp in the shade.
One by one, Claus, Jeff, Shade and 100 Grand all stopped by on their way to the shelter.
It looks like I have the place to myself which is fine with me, I hope to get up early and be on trail by 6am.  I want to get my miles in for the day early, it’s supposed to be in the 90’s, HHH.Living the DreamMule","Stealth Tent Site

I got up around 5am and you could feel the humidity in the air.  By 6:30 I was stepping off, my plan was to do 14 miles and try to hike the first 10 early before it got too hot.  Before I left I met Broadway, she set up before dark last night.  We ended up leap frogging each other all day.
The first three hours were spent climbing, it took a lot of energy today.  The water sources were good about every 3-5 miles.  I pumped two liters into me before I stepped off and one liter at each fill up.  My rule is to gorge on water in this heat.  
I made the usual pit stop at the first shelter about seven miles into the day.  A few hikers were there, 100 Grand and Claus.  Snoopy and Broadway showed up while I was there.  Everyone was red face and sweating.  
Most of them were doing 20 miles today - I don’t know how in this heat.  Actually I do, there young!
I passed thru the Guillotine before noon.  You can see it in the photo, it’s pretty formidable in person.  As I walked under it I felt nervous as if it was going to come down on me.
Shortly after 2pm I arrived at the campsite but not before another long climb.  100 Grand, Snoopy and Jeff were resting in the shade drinking and eating.
When they left I set my tent up in that same spot where they were resting.  One by one they loaded up their pack and disappeared for another five miles.  
In the FarOut app someone commented that there was a bear in camp last night, I’ve yet to see one..is this the night!  I found a great limb for a bear hang if he shows up he’ll have to work to get it.

The deer kept coming into camp last night, my tent was set up near the tree line, I heard loud movement close to me so I turned on my headlamp and there was a deer grazing five feet away - it didn’t care about the light or me it just kept eating.
The Whippoorwills rule the night, boy are they loud!  I got out of my tent around 0545, retrieved my bear bag, made coffee and fed the bugs.  Two hikers hiked into camp at 6am, they’d been hiking all night to beat the heat.  They’re night hiking for their dog, it’s much easier on the dog at night.  Just before I stepped off Rapunzel and Surgeon appeared from their tent, I haven’t seen them since April 21st, one month.
I’m about eight miles away from Glasgow, Virginia when I get there I’m buying some bug dope.  The hike out was hot but it was almost all down hill.  
I called Stanimal’s Hostel and got a bunk for the night.  I needed to resupply before I hike to Waynesboro so I decided a shower and laundry would be a good idea.  $35 for a bunk, shower, laundry and shuttle both ways is a deal - not to mention AC!
I tagged along with 100 Grand, Jeff, Snoopy, Shade and Claus to the restaurant for a late lunch.  They’re a great group of young people that I’ve been moving along the trail with.

The hostel was beyond capacity but hikers seem to work together to make the basics happen.  Pancakes were made in rapid fire, not as fast as needed but the cook promised there would be more than needed.
The line for the shuttle began, I was on the second run by 0715.  The first stretch of trail was along the river for about one mile, then a long climb began. 
Songs seem to consume my thoughts during the physical  challenge of a climb.  Add the humidity and temperature and I needed something to push me, it becomes will against force - my physical and mental will against the force of elevation, gravity and humidity.
The Led Zeppelin song “When the Levee Breaks” is running thru my mind.  My will is the powerful drumming of John Bonham, complimented by Jimmy Page’s guitar riff’s and Robert Plant's lyrics “Crying won’t help ya, praying won’t do you no good”.  It's all held together by John Paul Jones's bass and keyboards.  
We make the first climb up Big Rocky Row.  Most hikers take a short break and drink water.  As I move ahead on the trail there's a group of three stopped in the middle of the trail.  There's a big rattle snake on the trail, he's about 4-5 feet long, thick and healthy looking - he's hissing and means business.  He has our full attention and respect.
The snake finally moves off the trail.  There's 12-15 hikers moving up to the peak of Bluff Mt. about 3200 feet.  The previous 10 miles are dry and everyone is out of water at this point.  The good news is we go down hill for just over two miles and we come to good water.
When I arrive I see a crew of hikers sitting on the side of the road eating and drinking water.  I drink two liters and fill two to go.
I notice my legs are full of bug bites.  Everyone else is chewed up too, legs, arms and shoulders.  
A few miles later I hit the 800 mile mark!  I feel good about this one.
By 3pm I hit my goal of 15 miles I see a path off the trail that leads to a good stealth site along the water.  I get set up, by 4pm the sky is black and the rain comes down.  
Just as it starts Two Canes shows up and puts the tarp for his hammock up in a hurry.  By 6:30 pm the rain stops, I cook ramen and tuna fish.  Hang my bear bag, stretch, brush teeth and crawl into my tent.

As late morning arrives the humidity leaves and the rain starts.  By 1pm it's cold compared to what we went thru yesterday.  I have my pack cover on but the rest of me is soaked.  Rain gear makes me sweat too much but I probably should've had the jacket on to hold in heat.  
I planned to do another 15 today but at the 10 mile mark the sign to Cow Shelter pointed to a side trail and I decided to take it.  When I got to the shelter it was early enough that no one was here so I claimed a spot and changed into dry clothes.  Yesterday we were dying in the heat, now I have a beanie and a puffy jacket on.  Just as I got dry and warm another wet hiker and his dog showed up, the dog jumped up into the shelter and shook all over me!  The owner apologized three times for the shower I recieved but in the end I'm a dog lover and it won't kill me.
I set up and decided to stay here for the evening.  I'll readjust my plan and mileage, if I don't make it to Waynesboro on Thursday I'll get there Friday it's just the way it is.

I stepped off at 0745, later than I wanted to but that’s just how it goes sometimes.  The privy was closed because it’s full so it required a walk in the woods (TMI) and the shelter which didn’t have any stairs, had about a four and a half foot climb to get in and out of it. These things require additional time for a 60 year old man.
Anyway I hiked off into the mist, after a few hours I was working my way up this peak when the sky started to clear.  When I got to the top Blackhole was eating and had equipment spread out to dry.  The sun came out at that point and a group of teenagers and there teacher came up from the south.  I couldn’t believe how clean and bright they looked.  They had smiles and lots of questions about the AT.  They are studying outdoor leadership.  While chatting with them I couldn’t help but notice the strong smell of laundry detergent!  My sense of smell has become acute out here and you people in the real world smell good.  
One of the tricks you learn out here is to answer day hikers and tourists questions because that can lead to food. 
As part of there hike today these kids did trail magic and had bagged lunches and cokes waiting for us at the bottom of the hill!  
I politely said goodbye and down the hill I went.  I had the best homemade roast beef sandwich of my life, along with chips, coke, a banana and an orange.
As I left the parking lot I crossed the road and an older couple were waiting for their daughter.  The man asked me if I’d like a banana and some candy?  Absolutely, can’t get enough potassium after all.  He gave me a second banana and took my trash.  These two interactions turned the last three miserable days into one great day.  The sun stayed out for a few more hours before it got cloudy.  Around 3pm it started to drizzle again.
I made it to my stealth site at 5:30 and tried to set up in the rain the best I could.  Another challenge, the site is covered with small rocks and I can’t get my stakes in the ground to hold up the tent.  
Right about this time Blue hikes by with two dogs, one is hers and the other one came out of nowhere and has been following her.
My tent is ten feet off the trail and I can see hikers going by, as Silverback makes the corner he says “Is that you Mule?”  He sets up his tent and I have company.

The goal today is Waynesboro, Virginia 17.4 miles away.  I wear my dry night socks and t-shirt.  Dry night clothes are not to be worn except on the final day before town.  I put my wet clothes in a plastic bag.  When I get to the hostel I hope no one is around when I dump them into the washing machine.  As it turns out two or three hikers throw their stuff together to make a load; otherwise, you’d be waiting all night.
Every morning I pack my pack the same, it becomes automatic. When it’s raining it makes it difficult because it all takes place inside the tent.  The reason is to keep everything as dry as possible before breaking the tent down.
I stepped off at 0640.  I usually walk slow the first mile to warm up.  There was no warming up this morning the trail was all rocks, slippery and wet.  I couldn’t get a clean step the first few miles.  
I passed Blue’s camp she was packing up.  She told me the stray dog slept in her tent overnight.  The owner came and picked it up just before I got there.
I pushed ahead all day, anxious to get to town for a shower and wash my clothes.  My pack is light, my food bag and water bottles are empty. With all the rain water is plentiful so I tank up as I go - water and food are the heaviest items in your pack, eliminate them and you can cruise.

At breakfast this morning four older hikers were all having feet and ankle pain.  I’m glad it’s not just me, my right heel has hurt for over 700 miles so I’ve decided to take at least two zeros maybe more.  
One of the guys was in pain after a slip and fall yesterday.  He hiked all day being careful but as he approached the parking lot to get a shuttle, down he went.  Hopefully he’ll be ok.
It’s pouring today, thunder and lightning too.  I’m going to the post office to mail stuff home, the Outfitters for new shoes and then to the market for resupply.
So the Outfitters did not have the shoes I needed; in fact, the selection was poor.  I’ve been wearing the Hoka Speed Goats but after 400 miles I need to replace them.  I know back in Danville they have them but it was going to cost me $150 for a shuttle to get them! 
Being a holiday weekend USPS Mail and FedEx weren’t an option and I want to be back on the trail by Sunday.  I talked to the store manager in Danville and he’s agreed to deliver them to me tonight at 9:30pm for $65!  That’s good service as far as I’m concerned - some of the outfitters don’t fool around when it comes to taking care of AT hikers.
So let me give my full endorsement for Outdoortrails in Danville, Virginia.  If your in town go there.
I’m talking with one of my bunk mates Snoopy, she’s from Vermont.  She asked me if I drink Moxie soda since I’m from NE?  I got excited talking about it, I love Moxie soda and have told hikers when they get to NE to try it.  We both had huge smiles on our face as we talked about it.

During a lot of the movement I was in my bunk napping and relaxing.  It was impressive the amount of energy that was going on thru this building, not to mention the noise of it all.

It’s said that AT hikers burn up to 6000 calories per day, I don’t know if that’s a fact or not but today turned out to be one of the best days on trail that I have had to reach that amount.  Between my usual eats from my pack, a campground store and two trail magics I ate a lot! I usually pack my front two pockets with snacks for lunch; unfortunately, there usually gone by 10 am!
100 yards off the trail was the Loft Mountain Campground and store it was wonderful.  It had showers, laundry, a place to charge devices and food.  I had three Gatorades, a coffee, container of Pringles, two ice creams, gummy bears and an apple pie.
When I left there and started hiking I ran into four older women day hiking.  I’ve commented on this before, but I’ve seen groups of women friends doing this a lot, it’s nice to see.  They stopped me and were full of questions about my journey.  They had beautiful smiles and were so pleasant to talk with.  At one point they asked when I was going to finish, I told them I’d like to finish August 21st my son Corey’s birthday.  It caught me off guard and I cried - I told them he had cancer this year so his birthday would be nice.  They were very understanding and kind to me.  I’ve experienced a lot of emotion out here, it happens.
Back at that store I met up with Two Canes, we hiked the next 8-10 miles together off and on.  I arrived at one of the parking lots that the trail goes thru, I noticed several cars pulling in and out. There was a nice stone wall to sit in the sun and enjoy the view.  
A few minutes went by when four day hikers pulled in and asked me if I’d like an apple, they gave me two.  I saved one for a Two Canes.  A few minutes later a van pulled in, it was Miss Janet, legendary Angel of the AT!  She said “I do rolling trail magic, now open those doors”, inside was cold drinks, snacks and fruit.  I had a Dr Pepper, a banana, two packs of gummy bears and a nectarine.  If you don’t know who she is your missing out - look her up.

I felt a little better and it was enough to get me to the campground store.  It's a nice campground and the store had plenty to eat and drink.  I couldn't help but notice the old construction from the 20's and 30's.  The beams were chestnut!

When I finally arrived it was nice to wash my hands with soap and use a real toilet.  This place had a nice gift shop, store with resupply and some equipment too.  The grill opened at 11am just as I got there.  The employee told us they were way understaffed and it showed with the service.   The AC was worth the inconvenience.
When I left there I was hiking along when my left foot got caught on a rock and tripped me forward, all my momentum had the makings of a face plant when my poles prevented that.  But, my right foot (which is already in pain) slammed forward and stubbed the whole foot - man did it hurt!  I spent the next two miles trying to walk off the pain.  I came to a nice stream and soaked my feet and pumped Tylenol into me.
I walked off slowly for a half mile and then just hiked.  Pain and injury is a funny thing out here.  If it's not broke or torn you deal with it, its part of your hike until it gets better or you live with it.  My right heel has bothered me everyday now for over 800 miles!  I make sure my stride remains clean and even so I don't irritate another part of my body overcompensating.  It hasn't gotten so bad I have to stop - so, I hike on.
I hiked to Skyline Resort late in the day, it's just off the trail.  It has a store with snacks and cold drinks.  Also a restaurant but I didn't want to get held up for an hour so I bought snacks in the store and sat outside for awhile.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652425,"This morning was about getting mileage in before the heavy rain, thunder and lightning arrived.  The last check I made was a few days ago when I had enough service it showed 2pm it would hit.
My first stop was the Pinnacle Picnic Area.  It had flush toilets and water spigots.  There was also a large pavilion with a four sided fireplace in the middle.  While there I met up with Surgeon and Rapunzel, I hadn't seen them in over a week.
Following this, I stopped briefly at Byrds Nest #3 Hut to make coffee and snack.
I pushed to the Thornton Gap restrooms and took one final break and to get water.  I said goodbye to Two Canes, his girlfriend was picking him up for at least a day.  I also met Spirit while there, he had the latest weather forecast, it showed the storm starting at 3pm.  I took off for the shelter and decided I'd wait to let it pass.  Spirit showed up a short time later and by 2ish the sky opened up.  It poured off and on for the afternoon.  Rave showed up during this, she was a mess.  
I was hoping it would clear enough to move on but I finally gave up and stayed in the shelter to stay dry.  Tomorrow is supposed to be nice so why not stay dry for the night.
A few more hikers showed up as the afternoon progressed, by 8pm the rain opened up again.Living the DreamMule","Stealth Tent Site

We all meet up again at the Elkwallow Wayside about seven miles away.  This is the final Wayside in the SNP before we exit north.  It was 0930 so all we could get were snacks and drinks unless you were willing to wait until 11am for the grill to open.  Me, Cowbell and Licorice waited, Tennessee Pickle, Pebbles, Spirit and Rave moved on.  It was worth the wait a chance to rest and the food was good. I had a smash burger and a blackberry milkshake (finally)!
I hiked another six plus mile to the Gravel Spring Hut.  Took a break and filtered some water.  This too is the last shelter in the park.
I needed about four more miles to give me 16 for the day.  That number seems to be working for me right now.  
I found a nice stealth site about 200 feet off the trail.  So here I sit in the middle of the Virginia woods.  
I did my usual routine, set up camp, cook, stretch and do a little journaling.

I had about a 10 mile hike to US 522, for the most part it was uneventful.  My good friend Nancy from back home called her friends Scott and Dawn who live down here and had them pick me up at the trail head and bring me to my motel.  Scott had some cold drinks and snacks for me.  After he dropped me off he went and got me a sandwich from Subway.  
It was much appreciated, thanks Nancy for arranging this.  I’m so grateful for your kindness - all three of you.
I spent the afternoon taking care of equipment and resupply for the next few days to Harpers Ferry.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652559,"I walked into breakfast at the Baymont Motel at 0600.  The staff asked me how I was getting to the trail?  I told him I hadn't figured that out yet, he simply said ""I'll take you"".  It's a service the motel provides to thru hikers at 10am - he told me he'd bring me at 0730. It's Sunday and not busy.  
My feet were back on the AT by 0745.  The weather is looking good today, sunny, dry, 82*.  I hiked to the first shelter the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter for a brief snack and water.  It was a really nice shelter, well maintained with a solar shower, horseshoe pit and a separate pavilion and picnic table.
After I left there I hiked 3-4 miles until I came to Tuckers Lane Parking area, there was trail magic set up by Lucky Boy (2018 thru hiker) and his wife Lucky Girl and his dog, Lucky Dog!  He was serving hamburgers, hot dogs, potato salad, coleslaw, chips and cold drinks.  It was terrific.  
While there I ran into Spirit Kick and met Dustin and Walden for the first time.  As I was leaving Finn appeared, I haven't seen him since Bland.
I stopped at Whiskey Hollow Shelter to filter water.  My intention was to hike another three miles and stealth; however, my feet were killing me after 15 miles so I soaked them in the water.  
The shelter is impressive, it holds at least 12 people, and the floor is finished in polyurethane.  Also, an attached deck and roof with a picnic table.  The trail maintenance in this section has been obvious so far. 
Needless to say, I decided to call it a day and stay.  The best thing about that decision was about an hour later Parkour and Jetpack showed up.  I've hiked with them since the first week off and on.  We've been a day or two apart for long stretches, but here we are.
We talked a lot about the trail as we've experienced it and the people that have come and gone.  
Almost 1000 miles in we're still out here.  As I write this there's a mouse over my head chewing something, he's driving me crazy.  I put my headlamp on him, I can see his eyes in the crack between the wall and the beam, he could care less.

Nothing you can do but move on.  My food bag was hanging on the bear pole with toothpaste inside and all precautions were taken but sometimes it’s not enough.
The early miles of trail today was overgrown with weeds and vines.  Nature wants her trail back.  I was bent over in many spots trying to get thru.
I finally got to an open field and Cowbell passed me.  A few minutes later I heard laughing, I rounded the corner and sitting there was Sensei and Happy Camper, I haven’t seen them since the Grayson Highlands.  Lots of catching up on trail news and what we’ve been up to.
Everyone was heading for the Rollercoaster a 14 mile stretch of steep climbs and descents.  As you arrive the sign says “Hiker Warning, entering the rollercoaster have a great ride.  Trail boss and crew”.
After about four miles a group of us hit the 1000 mile point!  Me, Parkour, Jetpack and Tux.  We celebrated with high fives and some music - it’s a big deal to hit that mark.
We had about five plus miles to go to get to the Bears Den Hostel.  I was tired but felt motivated after reaching the milestone so I hiked it with this group. They are all faster and much younger than me but I took it to a higher gear and did it with them.  The last three hills were killer.
The hostel is just off the trail.  It looks like a castle, owned by the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy).  For $35 you get a bunk, laundry, shower, a soda, a pizza and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.

After the magic I had about four more miles of the Rollercoaster to finish but first I crossed into West Virginia along with Happy Camper and Sensei.
Virginia is the longest state that the AT passes thru at over 500 miles.  Many say they get the Virginia Blues.  I don’t know why it’s so beautiful a state.  I’ve used a lot of words to describe my daily experience hiking thru, words like beautiful, magnificent, vast and wonderful.  The hikers that I’ve met from Virginia seem very proud of their state and love to hear about my personal experience walking it.  If there is a heaven on earth it’s Virginia.
I caught up to Parkour and Jetpack as we left the Rollercoaster.  The next four or five miles was rocky but relatively flat.  It starting raining around 1:30.  I arrived at the shelter at 2:30, B Rex was there staying dry.  Over the next two hours others showed up to take a break for awhile.
Parkour and Jetpack moved on along with B Rex.  We were having a slow soaking rain.  From here it’s nine miles to Harpers Ferry tomorrow so I decided to hold up in the shelter to stay dry.  I’m sharing it with Shadow, Shazam, Tortoise and Hare.Living the DreamMule","Bears Den Hostel

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652694,"Got up at 0500 and out of camp by 0615.  Today I hiked about nine miles to the ATC in Harpers Ferry.  The weather was wet and humid. The trail was relatively flat with patches of rocks
My first stop was about three miles into the morning to a small market in Keys Gap. It’s just .3 miles off the trail. I had a large coffee, a honey bun (ok two) and a Gatorade to go.
After getting back on trail the final stretch in included crossing the Shenandoah River via US 340 Bridge - it spans about 1/2 mile.  It’s really loud with traffic.  I kept trying to get the trailer trucks to honk their horns but they wouldn’t do it.
As I took the side trail to go to the ATC I knew I also needed to go to the post office to pick up a package.  After that I’d get back on trail to find some type of lodging.  Surprisingly, there’s no real Hostel anymore, it shut down.  Last night from the shelter Shadow called the Town Inn to inquire about a bunk.  They couldn’t tell him if any would be available until today, then we reached out to a hostel in Knoxville (next town), the person thought he might have something available but wouldn’t know until today.
It’s touristy in Harpers so motel/hotels were very expensive.  So this was on my mind as I made my way to the ATC.
When I arrived they took my picture and logged me in as the 649th person to check in.  I started at number 1392 March 16th.  But, as they said it’s not an accurate count of how many have gone right thru and didn’t stop.
From there I went down the hill to the post office and picked up a box from my sister-in-law Shelia. It had some food and some gag jokes in it.  It was very much appreciated!! Thank you Sheila!
So after I left the post office the AT magic happened.  Remember I said I needed a room?  As I walked back towards the ATC there was a coffee shop with a bakery that I just had to stop at.  The women inside was really nice and asked all about my journey.  Then she asked me if I liked hot dogs and of course I said yes.. She gave me two in a bag that had homemade buns around them - delicious!  Then she asked me where I was staying, I told her I hadn’t figured that out yet.  
She got on her phone and a few minutes later she gave me an address within walking distance and said my friend has a suite that you can stay at for free!  I was overwhelmed by this and couldn’t believe someone that didn’t know me at all would call someone that hadn’t even seen me and invite me into their home. 
When I arrived Lexie met me out front and showed me the suite, it’s new, bright, AC and beautiful.
A few hours later she brought me to Walmart to resupply and told me to stay tomorrow too.  I need a zero at this point so I plan on staying.  
How many times I’ve heard the trail provides, it’s so true.  Wonderful people all along the way that want to help hikers.
So many of them love to ask questions and hear about your journey and then thank you for inspiring them.

Then I went to the ATC to look at the photo album more closely to see who’s come in since yesterday,  and found some hikers signed in three weeks ago that I once hiked with!
The highlight of my day has been watching a feral cat and her kittens playing at a nearby building.  They’re very cautious of me.

As I made my way up towards the ATC I went by Bolivar Bread and Bakery, it was closed but I waved anyway. As I was going by I heard someone yell “Hey Mule!”  It was Katie from the Bakery, she invited me in for coffee.  She gave me two hot biscuits and a cup of coffee to take on my way out of town.
Katie and her staff are terrific, this is the best bakery, coffee shop on the trail so far.  So all hikers after you sign in at the ATC walk 100 yards down the hill and get some goodies to celebrate your journey!
As I journeyed thru the historical district I was captivated and humbled by the history that was before me.  I hiked along the towpath and canal for a good three miles before I entered the woods.  West Virginia was over quickly, I was now in Maryland.
I met a couple day hiking with their 14 month old son. When the youngster saw me he started stomping his feet and belly laughing.  His name was Everett, he sure made my day.  His dad is a 2016 thru hiker. He told me there was a cooler ahead in the parking lot.  When I got there I had a nice cold Gatorade and some candy.
I hiked past two more shelters and decided to go to the campground, I wanted to do 18 miles today.  About a mile before the campground there was a group of runners grilling hot dogs for hikers.  I was glad to stop and have one.  I also had a honeybun and a yodel.
I arrived at the campground and claimed a spot.  Most of the campers were day hikers out for the weekend.  One of them grilled up burgers, dogs, beans and fed everybody.

The real surprise was all the tents that came after 8pm.  I counted 27 tents this morning.  Another group of kids came after I crawled into my tent.  I have to give the group leaders a thumbs up they kept good control over them and they were quiet.
I stepped off around 0630, within a few miles I was at the Washington Monument an impressive build out of rock.  
Then I crossed over I-70, it’s a caged walkway over the heavily traveled highway.  I had a morning break at Pine Knob Shelter.  There was an older couple section hiking from Maine.  I made coffee and we chatted for a while.  They we’re waiting out the rain.  It’s funny how thru hikers get used to hiking in the rain and just go.  We had a slow steady soaker all morning. I don’t bother wearing a rain jacket - just cover the pack and hike.
I stopped about eight miles away at Ensign Cowall Shelter for lunch.  I chatted with Matrix and Aqua while we ate.  In FarOut there were comments from this week that some guy was acting weird and walking around tents at night.  Apparently he may be homeless.  There was a pile of stuff in the shelter that may have belonged to him.  The comments mentioned 911 was called on two separate nights. This shelter is only .2 from the main road, these are the ones that usually have problems, close to a road and town.
Just before getting to the road I saw someone coming SOBO that looked familiar, it was Aloha - I’d recognize that shirt from a mile away.  He’s out for the weekend and said he’d hope to run into me. I gave him his trail name a week or so back.
When I got to Raven Rock Road, MD 491 there was an RV doing trail magic!  It was Yellowstone’s wife set up.  Yellowstone has been recovering from an injury so he’s slack packing with his wife following.  
I had some pasta and some fruit, it was really refreshing. Yellowstone arrived about 20 minutes after I got there.
I made my way back onto the trail and was about 1/2 mile from my final destination, Raven Rock Shelter when a SOBO told me the shelter was full and a large group just pulled in and was taking over the tent sites.  So I found a spot in the woods and called it a day.  I wanted to get 18 miles in and that’s what I did.

He said there was plenty of room inside the shelter and I could’ve stayed there last night.  I was told before my hike never trust a day hiker for info, this is the second time I got burnt with bad information. Last night I was told by a day hiker the place was packed so I slide into the woods.
A few minutes later Hawkeye came up behind me and we ended up hiking for a few miles together. I hadn’t seen her or Level 1 since Daleville.  They are part of an 11 member tramily they call themselves the Jort Cohorts.

I was impressed with how clean and well maintained the shelters were and the rest rooms along the way.  Not to mention all the great history.

I passed campsites where hikers were breaking down their tents - it was a wet night.  I almost felt guilty that I was in the hotel room last night.  But the thought didn’t last long.
I passed two shelters today and stayed at the third one.  Interestingly they all have two mini shelters at each site. I’m not sure if it’s this way for long but the next one ahead is the same.  I noticed at one location there was a sign on one that said snoring, the other one said no snoring - good idea.
I was surprised to run into Olivia today, she now goes by Rainbow for her trail name. She’s hiking with Lost Johnny.

We spent about 15 minutes chatting before we said good bye.  There's a chance we may see each other again in the North when he flips back up from Glasgow, Virginia.  I wasn't able to play a joke on him today, but it will come.The next thing was I hit the halfway mark of the trail for 2022, 1097.15 miles.  And shortly after that I hit the 1100 mile mark.  
When I got into camp there was a nice running brook that I went down to to soak my feet and wash with the cold water.  I didn't realize how bad I have chaffing until I checked myself.  I had to hike without my shirt earlier because the wet shirt was burning my arm pits and nipples (I tell it like it is) It was painful. I tried using glide but it didn't work.  While washing in the stream I noticed I have chaffing bad along my hips front and back.

You have to buy an additional pint of ice cream because the half gallons are no longer half gallons.  I had vanilla for the main meal and strawberry for dessert. It wasn’t a problem eating all, I really don’t know what the fuss is all about.  I even had two cups of coffee to go with it.  Gratitude gave me a quick dental lecture on the stress I was putting on my teeth with the two extremes.  I thanked him and told him how wonderful it was!
After the ice cream I walked to the AT Museum.  It was wonderful and very inspiring.  It had a display for Grandma Gatewood and Earl Shaffer along with Benton MacKaye’s office!  If you don’t know who these people are you should look them up.
This was all at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  I hiked away from there feeling energized.  I started up a long climb, up ahead I could see several people on the trail. As I got closer it appeared to be a group of high school students and teachers. There was at least 50 of them on the trail. As I approached them the teacher yelled to them to step aside, as they did I hiked right thru the middle of them, they started cheering for me and clapping, not just a little either, they were loud. It gave me goose bumps - I felt wonderful.
I hiked the rest of the morning and afternoon alone.  The trail was quiet and flowed nicely.  When I got to PA 34 I walked .2 miles to Hunter’s Run Rd Store and Deli. I had a roast beef sub, french fries and an iced tea.

I stopped at Alec Kennedy Shelter and had lunch and a lot of water.  I’m trying to eat more during the day, this is when I’m the most hungry and crave calories. In the morning I like peanut butter on flat bread but just enough to get me out of camp.  
When I arrived in Boiling Springs I met Spider at the ATC Mid-Atlantic Office (closed).  He was waiting for a ride to Lisa’s Hostel, the same place I was going so it worked out well.  
The hostel is in Lisa’s backyard in a shed with four bunks.  There’s a nice outside sitting area in the shade, all afternoon we’ve had a nice breeze.  There’s a walkway that leads to the back of the house and a door that opens into the shower room and laundry.  
So there’s nothing special about this hostel but the host is great, it has what you need and the other three guys I’m bunking with are all in their 60’s and retired.  It’s quiet and the conversation is good.  Two of the guys I’ve hiked with quite a bit, Spider and Shadow.  Forerunner I met for the first time tonight.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653225,"It was a nice night at the hostel with Shadow, Spider and Forerunner. One of the things we talked about is why we were hiking the AT. For me the short answer is I love to walk - I’ve always walked. As a kid I was mobile all the time, playing sports, walking or riding my bike.  My first jobs as a teenager I walked or rode my bike to work - this was pretty typical of all four of us last night.  
I learned to backpack in the Marines.  A career in law enforcement kept me walking too for over three decades.  I had a search and rescue dog for 10 years - we were always on the move.  I retired with a lot left in the tank because I stayed fit.  So here I am, still walking.  
My success so far out here has come from letting go and submitting to the trail.  Whatever comes I accept it as part of the journey.  The pain, hunger, stench, weather I accept it and walk with.
I had to laugh last night when Forerunner told us his wife said he had to be done in four months, my wife said I can’t come home for at least six months! 
Lisa shuttled us all out to town promptly at 0730.  She’s a terrific host. You know she’s the boss within five minutes of meeting.  
Me and Spider went to the Cafe 101 for breakfast, Forerunner had 25 miles to do to meet his deadline so he was gone.  While eating Droplet and Suspenders came into the Cafe.  I hadn’t seen them in a long while. They sat and ate with us and of course caught up on all the trail news.
Spider stayed in town for a zero to rest a sore knee, I moved on.
This section of trail today was like no other thus far. It is flat, smooth and went thru farmers fields and woods, all day long.  When I got to Bernheisel Bridge Rd there was a farm stand at the road with homemade vanilla ice cream. It also had fresh broccoli but the ice cream won out!
I hiked the final stretch to the shelter.  The weather today has been so good, dry and 70*, the opposite of yesterday. There’s a nice crowd at the shelter and the tenting area where I’m at is spread out with tents.  It’s been a good day on the AT.  
Up early in the morning to hike into Duncannon where I pick up a new pair of shoes my wife mailed to me. I’m going to need them to start the famous Pennsylvania Rocks. My current pair have duct tape holding the front sole on.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653255,"I woke up to a crisp, cool day. It feels so good compared to the humidity we’ve been having.
It was a pretty uneventful hike today into town. I arrived at Kind of Outdoorsy Hostel and got my new shoes from home.  I’m going to need them. Today I got a taste of the legendary rocks of Pennsylvania; however, I talked with Gandalf the Great (2014 thru hiker) and he assured me they don’t get bad until Port Clinton.   
While at Outdoorsy, I showered, resupplied, and went to the laundry mat.  Non of the eateries open until 4pm.  I decided to grab a bunk and just hang out here for the evening and step off first thing in the morning.Living the DreamMule","Darlington Shelter

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653323,"Stayed until 9am this morning waiting for the Hostel staff to open so I could purchase a small canister of fuel.  I hated to wait but wanted to drop pack weight. Back in Waynesboro I had to buy a 15 ounce canister that was all they had (crazy big.) I bought a 3.5 ounce small canister, much better.
Then I walked away in my new Steps (shoes) I can’t believe how good they feel.  This is my fourth pair since I’ve been out here.  I followed the AT markers out of town on High Street, over the Juniata River Bridge, the Susquehanna River, over the railroad tracks and then I disappeared into the hillside.
The trail is rocky and I have to pay attention. My eyes, poles and feet become one to navigate the best possible spot to step.  Everything is uneven and it puts a lot of pressure on your feet. The poles absorb impact and provide push off.  My upper body will get a lot of work in Pennsylvania.
I arrive at Clark’s Ferry Shelter and decided to rest a bit, eat a little and filter some water before I move on. The next section of trail has less rocks and ledge. I hiked four miles to PA 225 and Shoelaces was set up with trail magic. He’s a section hiker - he drove from Maine to support a friend. He left at midnight to get there and set up.  I had two cheeseburgers, a bowl of chili and a real salad with ranch dressing.  Two Gatorades, cookies and fresh kiwi.  
I hiked three more miles to Peters Mountain Shelter and chatted with Honey and Wild flower.  My intention was to hike five more miles to a small campsite but it sounded like it would be full by the time I got there.  So lately it’s easy for me to end the day early, so here I stay.  
More hikers stopped in, the talk is how far you have to walk for water. The trail drops down from the shelter into the abyss, it seems like an hour before they return with water. Some of the comments in FarOut said “I’d rather die than go down there again.”  There were other words used to describe the trek but I won’t repeat them.  
Honey took my liter for me and filled it.  I was grateful.Living the Dream Mule","Duncannon PA

He lives local and after work he hikes side trails into the AT and delivers some trail magic.  He's full of energy - non stop the whole time he's there.  Last night he brought two loaves of bread and made us mountain pies.  They're loaded with butter, cheese, bacon bites, pepperoni and sauce. Then he cooks over the fire. They were delicious, I ate three!  He also brings soda, whiskey and other mood altering products. He then hikes out in the dark with all the trash. There was a lot of bodily noises throughout the night.
I was the first one out of camp this morning and cleared the cobwebs on trail for my fellow hikers. Why are the webs never at torso level always in the face?
I hiked today with the Unabomber, Droplet and Suspenders. We took turns passing each other all day. It was a long day with a fair amount of rocks. The trail surface in Pennsylvania is hard packed even where there is no rocks. It hurts the body.  Everyone was limping and walking gingerly at camp - I'm glad it's not just me.

When I approached Greenpoint School Road there was a cooler up ahead with a note on top telling us to have a cold drink before hitting the real trail magic in less than a mile.  I had an ice cold Pepsi, so good!  I anxiously hiked .8 miles and found Jinx all set up. She made me a root beer float. I took my pack off and sat in one of the eight chairs she had set up.  She also had homemade banana bread, chips and other goodies. 
Trail magic is a real social gathering for hikers and you can tell the people that put it on love to do it. Most of them say they’re just paying it forward from their thru hike.
I moved on, under route 72 and over the bridge that crosses a stream. Then I disappeared into the wilderness. I had a long climb but the trail was in good shape.  I pushed all afternoon to beat the rain. I needed to get into Pine Grove so I could resupply before heading to Port Clinton.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653500,"I woke up to heavy rain then I checked the forecast . By 7am it was going to tapper off for the rest of the morning and clear slowly after that. I was able to get shuttled back to the trail head by 8am.
The trail was challenging with the rain on top of the rocks.  The branches on the trees were bent over the the trail so it made an already difficult maneuver worse.  It took me three hours to go 4.75 miles. I would normally go at least seven miles in that time frame.  I met up with Root Bear and Crow. They both have good positive attitudes about the rocks and rain.  Positivity is contagious, it was just what I needed.  I hiked up to a campsite and decided to make coffee in celebration for crossing the 1200 mile mark!
Then I pushed on.  At around 1:30 the sun came out briefly, the rain stopped as predicted but every time the wind blew it came down from the trees. It was tough getting mileage in today with trail conditions.  I decided to hike to a stealth site at 14 miles.  I got waters at 13 and then found the site.  It looked like a bobcat was leaving as I arrived.  I started setting up my tent when I looked up and 20 feet away was a deer in camp.  We just stared at each other for a minute. It gave me time to pull out my phone and record him.
After that I did my usual routine plus massaged my feet for a good 20 minutes - they deserved it.  So far I’m the only one at this spot now but there’s room for a few more tents; however, there’s a shelter in about two more miles so more than likely hikers will go there.

",Stealth Mile 1209 ,"Jun 23, Thu",14.40
Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/653565,"I stealth camped alone last night. All I saw were headlamps go by during the night.  There are several hikers that ease into the day and don’t start hiking until 11am. These folks like to hike when the sun goes down and into the night. Rainbow told me just as the sun is going down is the best time to be out there, the trail gets real quiet and the wildlife comes out. I prefer getting my miles in early in the day when my energy is high after a nights rest. If I can get 10 miles in before noon that’s a good morning.
Since being in Pennsylvania I break my day into three separate hikes. I like to do 4-6 in the morning before I stop and filter water. I make myself rest and get off my feet.  Then I knock out another 5-7 and rest again.  After eating and drinking I finish whatever is left for the day. The best breaks are usually at shelters with other hikers or trail magic.  Occasionally if I’m going thru a town I break at a restaurant or a store that’s just off the trail.
During my afternoon break today I realized I let Pennsylvania get in my head! I let all the talk about the rocks psych me out.  This is the first time on the trail I let that happen.  It is rocky and it is tough but a lot of it has been built up to be worse than it is as far as I’m concerned. I further realized that being from New England I hike on this stuff a lot.  I have a mountain back home that I train on, Mt Monadnock in Jaffrey, NH it’s about 40 minutes from my house. There’s nothing on the AT that I don’t encounter on Monadnock:  rugged rocky trails, slippery granite, winds, weather, it has it all. If you’ve never heard of Mt. Monadnock look it up on Wikipedia, it’s the second most climbed mountain in the world! 
Once I realized this I felt better and hiked what was ahead, and that’s what I plan to continue to do - like the thousand of other hikers before me. It’s still painful on the feet but I got it.
As the afternoon progressed I got to Port Clinton, a small village.  I went to the post office and got my AT passport stamped and chatted with the postal worker about the town. When I stepped outside MC was getting out of a vehicle. I met him at Kinda Outdoorsy Hostel in Duncannon.  We went to the Port Clinton Hotel to get some food. When we walked in the woman behind the bar was a bit rude when she recognized we were hikers she said in a loud voice “Do you stink?” I wasn’t sure if she was joking or serious, she seemed more serious. So I replied back in my rather loud voice “I showered two day ago!” She didn’t seem satisfied with that answer and asked me again “Do you stink?” So I simply said “Would you like to hug me and find out?” The waitress sat us in the other room in the corner.  It was funny how the waitress stood four feet away from us when she took our order. I’ll be honest with you, I did stink, but hikers are a huge part of trail towns economy. I’ve seen hotels with 25-30 hikers in them, restaurants with 10-15 hikers in there at a time.  
I guess they don’t want the business. I wouldn’t go back there again, but if I do it will be after I haven’t showered for five days!
But the coolest thing happened there. When I was leaving a stinky hiker named Tips was sitting at the bar, I introduced myself, he said “No way, I’ve been trying to catch you for a 1000 miles!” He told me his dad reads my journal because I’m always a day or two ahead it lets him know what’s coming up.  This sounds like Momma Willow. She’d read my journal to see what was coming up for her daughter Willow.  
That was such a cool encounter for me, Tips told me he’d see where I was by reading the shelter journals.  The funny thing is yesterday he passed me during the rain, we both had hooded rain coats on and he wasn’t much in the mood to talk. He’d been looking for me for hundreds of miles and here I was and he didn’t recognize me. This is what makes the trail so special.  It turned a long day alone into a great evening.
So I left the hotel and hiked out of town on an old railroad bed up into the woods and under the highway where it looks like the homeless frequent. I crossed a road and chatted with Crow before a long hard climb up the ridge and down to Pocahontas stream. I filtered some water and set up my tent.
For those of you that want to know the most climbed mountain in the world, you’ll have to look it up.  I can tell you I lived at the base of it when I was a young Marine but never climbed it and I regret it.

After Pulpit Rock I continued along to the Pinnacle ledges.  This is one of the busiest spots for day hiking in Pennsylvania because of the views.  There was at least four copperheads in the cracks of the ledge sunning themselves. They are impressive to look at, their color and pattern is beautiful.  You don’t bother them, they don’t bother you.  I ran into Andy up there (no trail name) we both started the same day. I haven’t seen him since Georgia or maybe early in North Carolina!  It’s crazy some of the people that I keep running into - we’re all still out here.
I hiked all afternoon it was hot and sunny.  The trail continued to be busy.  I took a water break at a foot bridge, there’s a rough looking stealth site so I sat there. Someone left a sleeping bag and tent poles behind. I don’t think it’s a thru hiker. There’s trash in the fire pit and food cans.  This wouldn’t be a thru hiker, no one carry’s cans of food.  While there the four members of the Zero Hero tramily stopped to rest. I chatted briefly with them before moving on.
I had one more long climb before I got to Dan’s Spring.  This was about a mile before my stealth site. That last mile was tough, the rocks picked up again and there was 10-12 dead trees across the trail to maneuver over or around.
I finally made it to camp, there was a father and son set up, they were out for the weekend. We had an enjoyable conversation while I set up camp and cooked food.

I’m glad I hiked into their camp last night.
The hike out was a mix of rocks, boulder fields and nice smooth trail. It’s crazy how the trail goes from one extreme to the other. I want to like Pennsylvania because it’s part of the AT but I’m struggling to do so. I gave Rob and Matt a hard time about it last night - like they could do something about it.  They are from Pennsylvania!
Pennsylvania is also a lot dryer when it comes to water, you have to carry more and work to get it. 
When I got to highway 309 I took a right and walked down to the Lookout. The road is busy and the traffic moves at a high speed.
I met with Kiosk she was working when I arrived. She was really helpful plotting were I’d find water ahead and recommending shelter/stealth sites, she knows the next 50 miles well.

The owner brings them in fresh from her chickens, they were delicious.  It was a good night to be under a roof with all the rain that came thru.  It looks like it will continue to rain until after 10am then clear for the afternoon. By 8am I was restless and stepped out in the rain.
The walk up the highway to the trail head was taking your life in your own hands. The shoulder was two feet wide and the traffic lane is narrow. Most cars tried to give you as much room as they could but a few seemed to be within two feet, and they were moving. After 1/10th of a mile I crossed the highway and it was over.  This section of trail has been the longest stretch of consistent rocks so far. Big boulders for long distance and then small pointed ones. I arrived at the Knifes Edge (large boulders, narrow and challenging) and knew I’d have to slow way down and plan every step, which is what I did.  After this stretch the sky opened up and it rained hard for an hour.  I knew there were hikers behind me on the Edge. 
I continued on until I came to the parking lot at Bake Oven Road. Mt Goat (2016) and his wife Mary had two tent tarps set up with trail magic. I took my pack off and sat. A short time later Beetle Juice and Conductor arrived - they made it thru the Edge in the downpour!
We all enjoyed soda, vitamin water, chocolate chip cookies, macaroni and potato salad, hamburgers and hot dogs. I won’t say how many hamburgers/hot dogs I ate but it was between 6-8! Mt Goat and Mary (Trail Angels) drove all the way from Ohio to feed us, eating was my way of showing my appreciation. 
I stepped back onto the trail, the rocks continued. There we’re signs up at Oven Baked Knob from the weekend, volunteers cleaned up the graffiti. From what I could see the Knob was full of it. They did a great job cleaning it.
I hiked on to the Oven Knob Shelter and signed into the log book, you never know who’s looking for you. The afternoon was spent hiking my way towards the long open ridge that allows you open view for a great distance towards the highway, river and towns. I came to a couple of real nice pine needle stealth sites. I haven’t seen ground covering like this since I was home in New England. Some hiker made stone chairs with backs on them. I sat for a while, I was so tempted to stay but I needed about 3 more miles for the day. I finally arrived at George W. Outerbridge Shelter. This place is really rough and worn. It’s the first water source today and FarOut says there is nothing on trail for the next 20 miles. I filled up four liters and found a stealth site deep in the woods. 
Not high miles today but that’s kind of my strategy to get thru the rocks without destroying my feet.

As I step off the rocks are ever present and don’t care about one’s feet. No warm up period, pain from the start.  I caught up to Four Ponies and we hiked to PA 33 together and took a right into town. It was one mile of road walking. It’s pretty bad when hiking on pavement and cement felt better than the trail! We got to the gas station and went inside, plenty of hiker food.  I had a large piece of breakfast pizza, one pint of ice cream, one piece of pound cake and two large coffees.  
We sat outside the store on the cement sidewalk leaning against the building and ate our food.
I got a text from Droplet telling me there was trail magic back at the trail intersection. They set up just after me and Four Ponies went thru. So we hiked the mile back to them. It was trail angels Mt Goat and Mary from two days ago!  This is the first time I arrived at trail magic not hungry, they insisted I have something so I ate a candy bar, filled my water bottle and hiked on.  
The next stretch of trail went up hill steeply before it leveled out. With about eight miles to go there was six of us hiking in close proximity of each other leap frogging all afternoon. We all seemed to rest quietly along the way thru out the afternoon submitting to the trail and living in the moment. The sun poked thru the trees with a gentle breeze. The air is dry - it’s perfect.
When we all arrived at the shelter we filtered some water and moved on to a tenting area .2 miles away. The site may be the best one since being on the trail, it’s a flat field high above the valley below with the view of farmland’s.   We all sat on the edge of the field and ate together. Suspenders and Droplet taught us how to play Farkal.  A simple evening that made todays hard work fade away.

I hope to run into them in the next few days.  I shared camp with Trip he started March 20th, four days after I started.  We had a lot to talk about. It's the first time we met but  the trail is a common bond we all share.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655703,"It was a full day of hiking today.  I did pretty well but I can tell I haven't been on the trail in almost a month.  I feel sluggish, my mind says go but my body says not so fast.  I can really see the difference in the AT hikers compared to the LT hikers (Long Trail hikers) The ATers have a worn look about them, they look confident, strong and determined. Their equipment shows signs too of over 1600 miles of trail.  Not to take anything away from the LTers, it takes time to develop that look. 
I tried to pace myself today, lots of breaks and water. Overall I'm pleased with my effort. I set up my tent and did my usual routine, cook and stretch.  The trail is a lot quieter up north than when I left off in New Jersey. Less hikers and maybe spread out more. So far there is only a few people at the shelters at night.  It's early August but I can tell I'm in the Green Mountains the nights are a bit cooler, great for sleeping.Living the Dream Mule","Peru Shelter

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655799,"Stepped of at 0730 this morning. The sun was shining with humidity in the air. Showers are predicted for later today. First stop was about a mile out at Bully Brook, I drank two liters of water, the water sources look good today so the plan is to camel up and carry little or none at all. This worked all day which saved four pounds of water to carry!
I met several SOBO's today, the first one was an older hiker named Moxie, after the soda. He even had an orange Moxie hat.  We had a long philosophical talk regarding Moxie. 
I had a short rest stop at Minerva Shelter for water and a snack. After I left it started to rain, I met up with a group of teens and a few adults - none of the kids were smiling and the adults we're carrying way to much equipment and supplies. I made sure I smiled and told them it was a beautiful day.
When I got to route 103 I decided to take a left and head to the deli one mile down the road. The thought of fresh coffee consumed me. I tried to hitch but no one would pick me up. I guess I'm not as cute as I used to be. So I did an additional two miles today, about 17 total.
I made another stop next at Clarendon Shelter to cool down from the humidity. I met and chatted with a nice couple that were hiking the Long Trail.
From there it was a six mile push to my destination, the Governor Clement Shelter.  It was a long hard climb as I left. The sky started to get dark and it opened up. Rained hard and steady for a few hours, once I got soaked the chaffing began. 
I stopped at the river and drank a lot of water, had a snickers bar and moved on for the last few miles. The rain had stopped as I arrived at the shelter. There was a nice crowd of hikers there. They managed to get a fire going in the fireplace. They were trying to dry there stuff out. I put up a clothesline and hung my stuff up, it will be nice an wet in the morning and I'll put it all back on. There's about 10 tents setup even though it may rain no one is using the shelter - it's an old stone dungeon, dark and uninviting.
After I had my supper I did a lot of stretching and massaged my feet, they needed it after today.
Tomorrow's destination is the Long Trail Inn on Route 4, about 11 miles. My old friend RP will be joining me Thursday - more on that in a few days.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655804,"I had trouble waking up this morning until I took my soaking wet clothes off the line and put them on - that woke me right up! Stepped off at 0720 and started working towards Killington. It was a long steady climb from 1800 to 4000 feet. The elevation gain kept the temps tolerable.  When I got to Cooper Lodge I abandoned my pack on the tent platforms with about six other packs and climbed the .2 side trail to Killington peak. The top had great views on this clear day. A light steady breeze and full sun. I sat there for a good 45 minutes letting my clothes dry. Talked with Wet Woody at lengths, he’s an AT NOBO.
I hiked down, filtered some water and stepped off. I had a six mile stretch to do to get to Route 4. I met Sunshine as I was leaving, she was finishing a sandwich she bought yesterday from the same deli I went too. In fact, it was the same sandwich, the Gobbler. Full of stuffing, cranberry and a fair amount of turkey. I asked her how she liked the mile walk to the store, she said she hitched both ways - got picked up right away! I told her I couldn’t buy a ride, she couldn’t stop laughing at me. She ended up hiking about three miles with me, it was nice to have someone to pass the time with. 
But eventually a 61 year old is too slow for a 26 year old and I stepped aside and she was gone.
I stopped at the Churchill Scott Shelter for a break. I made a coffee and had a snickers bar. I met Alaska Man and we chatted for a while. He offered me a liter of water rather than walking .3 to get some so I gladly took it. We were both heading to the Long Trail Inn. He stepped off and I followed about 15 minutes later. The Inn has a hiker rate if you walk in so that was the plan.
I got to Route 4 and started hitching the long one mile road walk up hill, of course I didn’t get a ride. When I got there Sunshine was outside all smiles telling me how good the food was and wondered what took me so long? I told her I couldn’t get a hitch, she laughed and said she got picked up right away! Alaska Man told me he got the last room - I couldn’t catch a break today.
I went into the pub and ate and had three cokes. The bar tender told me to try the Killington Motel a mile down the road. So I called and got a room. I started walking and didn’t attempt to hitch, save myself the humiliation. About half way a truck pulled up, the driver said road walking sucks, hope in. It turns out he’s a 2009 thru hiker. He can’t pass a hiker without offering some assistance. He talked to me about the Whites for a few minutes, he told me to listen to the weather.
This is a decent motel but no laundry so me and hiking clothes took a shower. I put the clothes out in the parking lot on a chair to dry in the sun. I spread out my tent too. Then I went to the deli and got a pint of maple walnut ice cream and a large coffee - life is good. Tomorrow RP is picking me up and we will hike to Hanover together and then the Whites.

For those that don’t know who he is, him and I started the trail together March 16th (seems like years ago.) We’ve know each other for over 50 years, the year prior to stepping off on the AT we trained together.  Going into the Smokies RP developed a quad injury. He pushed on to the 300 mile marker but had to get off - I kept moving. RP has since returned a few times, his last section was from the Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania to Killington VT. 
Last week before coming back to the trail I called him to talk about the Mass/VT section. Before you know it we realized it was an opportunity to do the Whites, Maine and peak Kahtadin together! 
So the plan is to hike together once again and finish what we started.  If all goes well we will finish our remaining milage in the fall. You can follow RP on trailjournals.
RP and his brother picked me up and we headed to the trail head on Route 4. His brother and two nephews hiked a mile in with us to see us off. Shortly after that we came to the Maine Junction and said goodbye to the Long Trail. The first part of the day went well, it's been a month since RP has been on the trail so we took our time. The weather is hot and humid so it's not the best day to start backup but we go forward.
When we got to River Road we had a three mile climb that was tough, it just kept going and going.  We stopped several times the heat beat the hell out of us. I ran out of water with a few miles to go.  The last mile was a nice decent to the shelter. We got to the water source took our packs off and drank. I had two liters.
It looked like rain was coming so we set up in the shelter. I did a lot of stretching tonight and kept drinking water. It ended up raining as the evening progressed. It was a good day today, not easy but it was great having RP's company once again.Living the Dream Mule","Route 4 Rutland VT

A homeless person crawled into the shelter beside me.  We seen him the previous afternoon along the trail carrying a large sack wearing slipper socks. He said something to us but made little sense - we just kept hiking. At 2am I got up to relieve myself and no one was there. At 4 am I rolled over and there he was laying on the shelter floor with no pad or blanket. Me and RP got up at 0500 to get the day going a short time later he was up. He didn't make a whole lot of sense when he talked. By 0620 we stepped off for the day.
First stop was the water source, I drank a lot and filled my bottles. The heat was oppressive even at this time of morning. We averaged 1.5 miles an hour for most of the day, which is slow but the heat and Vermont hills were in charge. With that said we pushed over 13 miles instead of the original 10 as planned. 
If we made it to Route 12 before 5pm we could get to a farm stand that had ice cream and homemade baked goods. By 4:15 we were in the store! I had a pint of ice cream, a homemade apple turnover, a muffin, large bag of potato chips, cream soda and a Gatorade.
While there I met a hiker named Yak, he was yo yo-ing (he hiked from Springer to Kahtadin, turned around and is hiking back to Springer!

Around 1pm the sky opened up on us for about a 30 minute downpour. It felt good, we were already soaked from sweating so it didn’t matter - if your hiking now your wet all day, your clothes barely dry at the end of the day the humidity is so high.
Around 3:30 we arrived at Linda’s Place across from the White River Bridge. Hikers jump 30 feet off of it into the 20 foot pool below. I was tempted to take the jump but I didn’t want to risk injury - again!
Around 6pm a young hiker showed up, he barely made it here, he’s dehydrated big time and the stress on his face doesn’t look good. There happens to be a nurse here and we’re all helping him. After a cool shower and electrolytes he’s going to the ER. He looks in rough shape.

Miss Linda came over to the picnic table and sat with me. She has great stories from years of running her place. Coffee was brewing on the porch and she had fresh sliced watermelon for us.
The few hikers that were there got up. By 0630 we were all sitting on the porch chatting.  Shortly after 0700 all hikers had stepped off.  I was a bit nervous this morning as there was a section I needed to hike thru about five miles long that had several reports of ground wasp bitting  hikers. Not only were there comments on the FarOut App but three of the hikers at the hostel warned us after they got bite. I’m allergic to them and realize it’s a risk I take, but onward and forward I went.  I made RP go first, if he got bite I’d do an about face and run like hell!  As it turned out we made it to Elm Street in Norwich, VT safe! Of all the things to worry about out here in terms of safety and health, my biggest worry is Wasps and Ticks.
We began the road walk into Norwich and stopped at the General Store for resupply. We repacked our packs with food out in the parking area. I ate two Klondike Bars and drank a large Gatorade.
We then proceeded out of town, still on the road into Hanover (the AT goes thru both towns). This brought us onto the grounds of Dartmouth College. We found the cafeteria, for $15 bucks they let hikers in to eat.  I won’t list everything I ate and drank, but it was an experience!
As we walked out of town as always I’m glad to disappear into the woods.  The heat index is really high my clothes haven’t seen a washing machine and soap in eight days - I rinsed off in the swimming hole last night and I’m pretty gross right now. When I was in line at the store I noticed I had lots of space around me.

We stepped off this morning with one thing on our minds, “Water!” This is a dry section and it was questionable whether or not we’d find any during the day. Comments on FarOut aren’t always accurate in my view. But most of them said everything was dry with a little around 6.8 miles out. It is said “the trail provides.”
I stepped off at 0620 with no water. About three miles out a paving crew was working on Trescott Road, RP went up to them and managed to get four bottles of water for us - they went down in seconds. I started to feel energized. We knew at Etna Road a new store had opened recently, it wasn’t listed anywhere but a comment on FarOut mentioned it was a mile away once you come to the road, and it was worth the road walk.  We started to hitch and got picked up by the Hanover Police. A shout out to Sergeant Daniel Fowler, he brought us to the store, waited for us to get water and gave us a ride back to the trailhead. While at the store the owner let us fill our bottles and me and RP each bought two more liter bottles to carry.  We carried eight pounds of water for the day. No where else on the AT have I carried more than three liters at one time. In this heat it was heavy.
Just before Goose Pond Road we crossed a bridge over a dried out stream, one we were told would be dry; however, I walked the creek bed about 100 feet and found two puddles that were deep enough to fill bottles. As I said the comments aren’t always accurate - they didn’t look hard enough.
At Goose Pond Rd we met Chuck the trail angel, he had a cooler of cokes and there was three five gallon jugs of water. Chuck lives close by in NH, he’s over 80 years old. The license plate on his car reads “48OVR80” he is one of a handful over the age of 80 that has hiked all 48, 4000 footers in the White Mountains. It was a gift meeting and talking with him.
When we left Chuck we had a long climb and a mile decent to the shelter. After me and RP hiked the .3 mile to the shelter three other hikers came and all of them got stung by yellow jackets, “The trail provides.”Living the DreamMule","Velvet Rocks Shelter

Bill is no longer alive but the tradition goes on. There is a freezer on the front porch with ice cream in it and you can fill your water bottles too. I bet if you did a search there's articles on him.
After leaving Bills place we began the long accent up Smarts Mountain, the sky opened up on us and it rained heavy for an hour. The trail became a stream. The rain felt good and we need the water. At the top of the Mt there's a fire tower and an old wardens cabin that hikers can use as a shelter. No one was there so I stripped down and wrung out my shirt, shorts and socks. The sun was now out and it dried my body, after putting my shorts back on I hung up my shirt, then I made coffee and had a snack. A short time later a SOBO named Jelly arrived. He lives about an hour away from me. One more cup of coffee was brewed for our long conversation.
A short time later I was up and moving, RP managed to get ahead of me so the hunt was on. It took all afternoon before I caught up to him on top of Cube Mt.

We took a break on top for about 1/2 hour, there were a lot of clouds but view’s came and went. We hiked down to Beaver Brook Shelter and took another short break. A young hiker named Crosscheck stopped in. He pulled out some pizza for lunch.

The White Mts have been a real test both physically and mentally. I've hiked over 200 miles since getting back on the trail, for most of it my feet have been fine and my head has been into the day, but the Whites have brought pain back into my feet and each step takes so much concentration that I'm exhausted.

We were leaning towards a zero day to rest and not risk the weather.
Over the next hour I hooked myself up to an IV of coffee, moved around the hut and ate breakfast. The hut workers gave the forecast for the day. It looked like we could get up the 5367 foot Mt Madison and down the 1.6 mile exposed ridge line into tree line before the rain. So the decision was to move on.
The five thru hikers in the bunk room came to life and we all started packing for the trek. The room had this awesome sound of pack straps being clipped, tightened, velcro and zipper sounds. Then the badgering began. The two young hikers, Stoneage and Whiz worked over RP, Push-ups and Me pretty good. They’re young and witty, but us three old guys held our own!
One by one out the door we went and immediately started climbing Madison. The plan was to cut a 13 mile day into 7.8 miles and see if we could beat the rain into Pinkham Notch. From their we’d make our decision on lodging for the night.
About 1/2 mile before Pinkham the rain started. Back up at 5000 feet we left 30 mph winds and 40* temperatures. It was good to be in 60* temps and no wind.  
It’s supposed to rain most of the day tomorrow heavy at times, we need to go back up in elevation so a zero day seems likely for all of us.
We split up into three groups, some went to Gorham for lodging and some to a hostel. Me and RP got a room at the Joe Doge Lodge right here in Pinkham Notch. It has everything we need, including a shower - I haven’t had one since Killington Vermont about 14 days ago!

The weather is to be respected up here. Inside the Pinkham Notch Center is a list of names of people that have died up here over the years. One of the volunteers told me they need to add two more names for this year - so far!
The short milage yesterday and todays rest has helped a lot. There’s good food here and supper and breakfast come with the room fee. Surprisingly they have very little resupply options here, fortunately there’s enough to get me by for two more days on trail.
We plan on doing 13 miles tomorrow and it doesn’t look easy, looks like four 4000 footers! That will set us up for an eight mile finish on Saturday. 
I need to correct something from last nights journal, I mentioned I hadn’t had a shower in 14 days, RP reminded me we had one at the Welcome Hostel before entering the Whites six days ago. Sorry about that everything just blends together out here for me after awhile.
The weather looks good for the next two days after a little rain in the morning.  
I’ve been keeping in touch with members of my Tramily, they’re all in the Whites at different locations. I did see Rapunzel and Surgeon earlier today. I haven’t seen them since the Shenandoah’s.

We hiked 13 miles and seven 4000 footers today, it took almost 12 hours!
I had a cool surprise on Wildcat Mountain today, I was resting in the sun when all of a sudden Grizzly Mad Scientist appeared. I hadn’t seen him since New Jersey when I got off the trail. He always has a big smile and good energy - he made my day.
After the final Mt we had a treacherous decent for about 1/2 mile to get to the Imp. Running water over the rocks. It was dangerous.
When we got to camp we chatted briefly with the caretaker then set up in the shelter.  I cooked food with several members of the Jort Tramily.
It was a long hard day, we pushed to get here. It will pay off tomorrow - eight miles and we’re done with the Whites.Living the Dream Mule","Joe Dodge Lodge

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656751,"Our final night in the Whites I set up in the shelter with RP and one other hiker. A short time later Suspenders and Droplet showed up and joined us. The Jort Tramily took over the tent platforms. Other than that there was only a few tents tucked away in the woods. 
The campsites in the Whites have specific areas where they want you to cook and eat so you’re away from the sleeping area. With the amount of hikers coming thru it’s a good idea. I joined three friends at the cook area that were out for the weekend. They had a lot of questions about the AT and seemed genuinely interested in my journey so I was glad to share my experience with them. A short distance away from the cook area the ledge drops off with an open view. The site caretaker was standing there watching the sun go down. I joined him and others followed, it was serene. 
A short time later I put my food bag in the Bear box with a few others - there was still plenty of room for more. Off to bed for hiker midnight. I put my ear plugs in and was out until 0500 when I woke up.
First thing on my mind was coffee, so I went to the bear box for my food bag. Several people came in after dark, food bags were left on top off the Bear box! They must’ve belonged to weekenders, they weighed at least 18-20 lbs a piece (way too heavy). After moving them I opened up the box the inside was packed with food bags. I dug mine and RP’s out and made coffee.
As it started to get light I looked at the eating/cooking area, there were six hikers cowboy camping in it (no tent)! I’m always amazed at the different things I continue to see out here.
Anyway, enough about camp. Me and RP stepped off at 0640 for an eight mile trek out to Rt 2 in Gorham, NH. RP’s wife Jean is picking us up for a five day break before tackling Maine. The break was planned before we started in Killington so RP could fulfill some commitments before we continued hiking together.
I have to say after the Whites a few extra days off is fine with me. My plantar fasciitis isn’t going to heal until I take an extended break; however, I’m finding I can manage it with an occasional short milage day and some zero days.
Before getting to Rt 2 we hiked up one more 4000 footer, Mt Moriah. I kept turning around looking back at Mt Washington and all the other peaks we hiked over, it seemed like a long time ago. The ascent wasn’t too bad. Before the top there’s a short side trail off the AT to get to the peak. When we got to it we looked up and up a narrow wet granite trail, we both mumbled something and continued on the AT. 
I stopped at the Rattle River Shelter to sign the log but there wasn’t one to sign. I then proceeded over the Rattle River. A few weeks ago when it was humid this would’ve been a great spot to cool off. 
The last 2-3 miles of hiking was a flat nice trail, maybe the Whites were giving hikers a reward for making it thru!
I usually like to summarize a few thoughts about each state, never about a section, but the Whites deserve a few thoughts:  from Glencliff to Gorham is 100 miles and considered by most to be the start and end of the Whites. During this time I hiked 20, 4000 foot Mts in eight days and one zero. For me personally it has been the toughest hiking along the trail and in my life! We were fortunate to have good weather the eight days. We stayed at two campsites and four huts. Some call this platinum blazing, meaning you spend a lot for comfort.  I’m glad we were able to experience the huts, they gave us two good meals, a dry place to stay and a variety of hikers to chat with. We hiked the miles like the others around us and the thousands before us.
RP was at the parking lot when I arrived. We shook hands and looked at each other with a sense of pride and accomplishment. When I stepped off in Manchester Vermont 21 days earlier I didn’t know if my previous injury would stop me from continuing north. Four days in when I met RP in Killington I felt I had a chance.  240 miles later I cleared the Whites. Perhaps seeing that final sunset was a good sign.
I took off my shoes, put on sandals and my cleanest dirty shirt for the ride home. We stopped at Subway and then the coffee shop before the 3.5 hour ride home.
It looks like we’ll be back in Gorham to finish the last 16 miles of NH on the 26th of August then the great state of Maine.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656902,"The plan was to drive up to Gorham, NH Friday and do some milage in the afternoon/evening. I’ve decided to head up tomorrow late afternoon and go to the hostel for the night so I can step off Friday morning for a full day.
A few days off before hiking Maine has been good, I hope it pays off. The only equipment change I’ve made is my pack. From Killington to Gorham I used a 40 liter Hyperlight pack. I really liked the simplicity and durability of it, but it didn’t allow for a neck adjustment where you can pull the top of the pack forward to take pressure off the neck - it hurt with a full resupply and water load.
I started with a Zpack 64L Arc Haul, it was ok but I had problems with the frame. After 700 miles I had my wife mail me my reliable, comfortable and heavy Osprey pack! I’m going back to it to hike Maine. It’s three pounds heavier than the other two packs but the comfort can’t be beat. It’s a 65L pack, I took the brain off the top which cuts the pack down to around 58L.
In my last post I mentioned RP was hiking Maine with me but I’ll be solo. I’m looking forward to seeing many of the hikers I’ve known since day one. 
Most of them are ahead now, some are close to finishing, but you never know who’s around the corner.

Getting here the day before I step off is a good way to hit reset.  I get a few extra hours to talk with other hikers and go thru my equipment “one” more time.  I have too much food which is typical for me. I was able to eliminate two pounds from my pack, between food and a few items. Other hikers were glad to take the extras off my hands.
Gorham is a good place to resupply and walk down Main Street. There’s a farmer’s market going on. I walked to the post office and had them stamp my AT Passport and stopped for a giant black raspberry creamy. 
The hostel owner said there will be a full house tonight, it’s still early. I hope a few hikers come in that I know. Either way, I get shuttled to the trail head at 0710 in the morning to finish NH and start the great state of Maine. I have no fear of what is ahead, if I remain healthy I got this!

Paul the manager had me and two others load our packs in the trunk of a big old Cadillac and brought us to the trail head. I started walking on the road and it began to rain. I covered my pack and kept moving. After about a mile of road walking I disappeared into the woods. 
I feel really sluggish today, too many days off is not good.  I stopped after about seven miles at a nice ledge and view. I had a snack and made some coffee. Also the sun is now out so I’m drying my pack cover and rain jacket on the granite.  
A few minutes later I step off again, it doesn’t take long before the sky turns dark and the sun is long gone. Suddenly you can hear rumbling from the sky, it’s a matter of time before it starts to rain. I put the pack cover back - no rain coat I’d rather get rained on, it’s to hot with jacket on. After about and hour I think about a quick stealth spot but nothing is available and I need water. I hike on and the sky opens ups, thunder,
Lightning and rain. I’m soaked in a matter of minutes. The trail becomes a stream with deep puddles to navigate.  I get to the water source and tank up, a short time later the rain stops and I find a stealth spot. I decide to set up rather than go two more miles to the shelter. 
After the tent goes up I toss my pack in one side and I get in and proceed to get out of wet clothes and dry off, then I set up the inside.
A short time later the sun is out for about 20 minutes, I get out of the tent and cook. I manage to get some stretching in before I eat. By 7pm I’m in the tent as the day starts to end. 
I’m glad this one behind me. The next two days looks pretty good for weather. I’m looking forward to getting my momentum back. Todays 9.6 seemed to take forever.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657099,"Slept well last night. I do enjoy an occasional night alone in the woods.  Last night I wrung out my wet clothes and piled them in the corner of the tent.  This morning I wrung out more water and put them back on.  My shoes were squishy like a wet sponge.
I stepped off at 0730, the trail is wet and the vegetation has encroached the trail, it needs to be trimmed.  I brush it with my body as I hike thru and get soaked again. I accept it and move thru it like everyone else. I hope to see some sun today, I'll stop and dry things out.
I had a real morale boost in my first mile of hiking:  I ran into Sparky. I haven't seen him since Georgia. He flip flopped so he could clear Kahtadin and Maine.  I really felt inspired to see him. When I met him he was real slow, but here he was persevering. We chatted for awhile and went our separate ways, me north to Kahtadin , him south to Harpers Ferry.
The trail all the way to the peak of Mt Success was wet, rocky, muddy and the vegetation encroached the path. I had a nice visit with Joanne and Al my hiking friends from back home. They were up for their anniversary.  I’m glad they are now part of my journey.
I wasn’t able to put up many miles today, the conditions for me was so slow moving I had to be careful.  I decided to stop early at the Carlo Col Shelter and take advantage of some of the afternoon sun and dry my clothes and equipment.
I had one more treat before the day was out, Glue entered the camp, when we exchanged trail names he asked me where I was from. When I told him, he said my mom knows your wife. She told me I might run into you! As it turns out he lived the next town over from me when he was growing up - it’s a small world.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657177,"I was up at 0500 making myself coffee. I've noticed we're losing morning and evening light as we come to the end of August. The night time temps are getting chilly too. 
Today is a big day it includes the Mahoosuc Notch, the toughest mile on the AT and the Mahoosuc Arm a killer hill after the Notch. In my AT Institute notes those four miles are listed as the hardest on the AT!
I had good focus and determination when I left camp I needed to move more efficiently on the trail today. I'm being too careful and it's slowing me down and taking too much energy. Fonz and Glue, both young hikers passed me, I watched how effortlessly they seemed to move without worrying about the conditions. I decided to do the same, I would pick and choose when to use more caution. When I climbed I dug in and kept moving, down hill I made sure to plant my feet and poles good and use branches and roots whenever available to hang onto.
The morning was spent climbing but hikers were rewarded with continuous views, some were spectacular as I worked my way over Goose Mt Peaks. On the peaks and in between there were a lot of boardwalk bridges protecting the marsh and vegetation. Some of the boards were broke and if you weren't careful you'd sink into a foot of water and mud. I watched a hiker sink to their knee in one spot.
When I finally arrived at the Mahoosuc Notch the sun was out and conditions were good.  The AWOL guide states ""Most difficult or fun mile of the AT make your way through jumbled pit of boulders."" I started off alone but caught up to Summertime and Little Spoon (young hikers) I watched were they went and followed. I had to take my pack off three times to fit thru spots, Summertime helped take my pack thru for me. As I got close to the end I passed a hiker my age, he said it had taken him almost five hours! It took me one hour and forty five minutes to clear it, not bad. At the end there's a nice water hole to sit, drink and rest. 
For the next few miles the hiking was up and up, very arduous until I cleared the Arm. From there it was about one mile to the campsite. I arrived around 5pm and pitched my tent on a platform. I like the platforms they're nice and flat  and give you a place to sit. I set up my camp, cooked and did some stretching.

I left camp this morning and climbed up Speck Mt where there was phone service and called Pine Ellis Hiker Lodge in Andover to see if they had a bunk and if they’d come get me on route 26. They had a bunk and for a fee anything’s possible. I hiked down to the parking lot and waited for an hour but they came as promised. There’s one other reason I need to get off, I smell so bad I can’t even stand it! My socks smell so bad that I can smell them when I’m walking - it’s awful. I’ve been out over a week at a time and not been this bad, but after four days between the rain and mud I’m bad.
They tell me this hostel has been in operation for 32 years, it’s quiet and has what a hiker needs but it could use a good cleaning and a lot of cosmetic work. It appears that two older women run it. 
A short walk away on a gravel road you come to the village, there’s a small market/restaurant with good food and the basics for a resupply. I ordered a large pizza and saved three slices for dinner. I also had a pint of ice cream, a bottle of Moxie soda and a Pepsi for desert.

I walked back to the hostel and finished morning chores before heading back to the trail. The shuttle driver transported me and the only other hiker at the hostel last night. When I mentioned the middle of the night coffee he admitted to going down and turning it on, he said he didn't know what time it was! When we got to Grafton Notch I headed north. It didn't take long before I was climbing. The morning was spent climbing over the Baldpate Peaks. Once I peaked the first one there was a series of Balds to the next peak, large flat open granite areas with the board bridges along the way. These board bridges seemed to be a lot more prevalent in Maine, they protect the fragile environment.Today was hot and humid, I'd guess about 80* I drank a lot of water, fortunately the water sources are good.
I hiked the trail today with F-Lot. I remember seeing him in Harpers Ferry, along time ago. We passed each other throughout the day and both stealth camped at the same spot. After we set up camp and cooked we took a walk around the pond to a spot that has two canoes chained to a tree. A dirt road goes half way around the pond. F-Lot is a photographer he has a beautiful camera,  he was taking photos of the water. We're getting a small taste of the foliage in this area.

It rained hard during the night and one corner of the tent by my feet took in a nice amount of water from a large puddle. I quickly submitted to the situation and did my best to minimize how wet everything else got while I packed up. It’s a big challenge to fully pack my backpack inside the tent because in the morning my 61 year old body has no flexibility and is in pain until I can get up and start moving. To go outside and try and pack in the rain makes everything wet.
If there’s one piece of advice I’d give to a potential AT hiker it would be to practice packing up everything inside your tent and to then take your tent down quickly.
As I was stepping off F-Log asked me if I was doing 14 miles today, I told him I’d be happy with 10, there’s three hard climbs today.  I hiked to the first shelter and stopped and made a coffee.  There was a light breeze and the sun came out. I took the opportunity to lay my air mattress out on the roof to dry and hung my quilt up too. A short time later F-Log showed up and stop for a break as well. It took about an hour but things dried. 
I hiked on about three more mile and ran into a SOBO name Bob Cratchet, he had his small chihuahua dog Tiny Tim in a small pouch against his chest Tiny Tim looked so content to be along for the journey. Bob told me he stayed at the Cabin Hostel last night. He said the woman that runs it is terrific, she’s 91 years old and cooks two delicious meals. It took me about one minute to realize that I was going there if she had a bunk.
When I peaked Moody Mt I got cell service and called. She had a bunk, we arranged a time for pick up at South Arm Road. While working my way down the mountain I slipped and fell and hurt my forearm. Just one more pain to deal with.
I’ve given a lot of thought to managing myself as I hike Maine. The southern portion of the state is said to be the worst - it is kicking my butt! I plan on doing 7-10 miles a day for a while, rather than pushing myself to exhaustion and pain to get 12 plus miles. As I progress north the trail conditions are much more favorable for longer mile days. I’m also going to take advantage of hostels and rest stops along the way. Maine is the second longest state on the AT at 281.8 miles, if I want to make it I have to be smart. I also plan on hiking alone to the end, I don’t want my decision influenced by anyone else. That doesn’t mean I won’t hike from time to time with people, they just won’t be a factor in what I do.
So back to the Cabin Hostel: Honey, was the shuttle driver that picked me up - I’ve never been driven by a 91 year old person. The first thing I noticed about her was how nice it felt to be around her.
When we arrived at the Cabin she showed me around and told me to make myself at home. Then she pointed to the door that leads upstairs and said walk thru that door for supper at 6pm.
I put my wet tent out in the sun and took a shower. Then I washed my clothes and went thru my pack. 
At 6pm I walked thru the door and up the stairs, she greeted me with a nice smile as she finished making gravy. Four hikers sat at her table and enjoyed one of the best meals I’ve had on trail, chicken, mashed potatoes, salad, corn on the cob and home made banana cake with ice cream. The dinning room is full of memorabilia and pictures, including Earl Schaffer who visited her hostel more than once. If you don’t know who he is you better look him up.
The table we ate on is a long pine table that was signed underneath by Earl Schaffer and many other hikers, including me. It will some day sit in the AT Museum!
It’s easy to see why Honey is still so energetic at 91, she stays engaged with life and is passionate about hikers and the AT. I’m so glad I took the time to come here today.

Bemis Mountain came a few hours later but it was much easier. I know I mentioned doing 7-10 miles last post but the trail had a much more forgiving roll to it after Bemis so I felt good enough  to keep going, 12 miles made sense.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657462,"It was a tough day for me on the trail today. How quickly things can change out here. Yesterday was the best day I’ve had in Maine, today was the worst day in Maine. I’ll get to that in a minute but first I wanted to mention where I stayed last night, it was at the Poplar Shelter. As I was getting closer to it each day I knew it had a story to it. In 2013 AT hiker Geraldine Largay (Inchworm) was last seen there, her remains were found two years later in the woods. Her story was told in the book “When You Find My Body.” 
In my past professional work I spent several years in the search and rescue community, much of it was training German Shepherds to find people lost in the woods. Although it’s been a long time since I did that I was intrigued by what happened here. As I walked away from the shelter I kept visualizing what she might have done and where she may have left the trail and entered the woods. Almost ten years of growth has occurred in the woods so it’s hard to say. It’s a heartbreaking story worth reading.
As I hiked north I past Poplar Ridge and let go of those thoughts. Me, F-log, Sparkpug and Amazing Grace all stepped off at different times this morning, but we agreed to meet up at the Spalding Mt Shelter eight miles away. Rain was coming in so we would probably hold up there. When three of us got there, the rain had been moved from 11am to 3pm so it was a good opportunity to put plan B into action. We would hike up Mt Sugarloaf about three miles away, on top of the mountain there is an old shack that is often left unlocked for hikers and it has power to charge your phone. With no cell service we left Amazing Grace a note telling her our plans. About 1/2 mile after leaving the shelter my old foot injury came back and it came on strong. I knew it wasn’t good, it was 13 miles to get off trail and two 4000 footers to hike over.  Rain was starting too. I ran into a section hiker that just came from a side trail that he told me about, it was 2.3 out to a gated road that has a parking lot with day hikers parked there. I decided it would be best to take this route out of the woods so I could get to the hostel. 
As I was going down the trail limping I turned and saw a family hiking behind me. I asked them if they had a car in the parking area and told them I was hurt and needed a ride. I don’t know what happened to me but it was an emotional release and I broke down. They were wonderful kind people and willing to help me. I was able to limp down the trail to their car and they brought me to the hostel. I’ll be forever grateful to these wonderful people for helping me. Thank you Bruce, Whitney, Nora and your son (can’t remember name).
I don’t like to sound like I’m complaining, I’m out here because I want to be, but as one hiker told me today, “This trail is not good to the body.” I hope a few zeros help.

A big fat wood stove is in the corner ready to go. There’s also a long table to eat or play board games. 
This morning we had delicious black bean egg burritos for breakfast. Jen and Jen are the host, you couldn’t ask for better people. They never mind answering questions. 
They have a 24 passenger bus that they took us to town in to buy supplies. We all got off the bus in the middle of town, we looked like a walking rummage sale, wearing loaner clothes!
The hiking community is great to be around. I was sitting quietly alone last night contemplating my situation when a few hikers recognized I was down, they came over and started talking to me sharing their experiences too. One of the hikers is doing a work for stay suffering with plantar fasciitis, he turned me on to the foot massager. My attitude has improved tremendously since yesterday and my foot is feeling better too. I’m pumping fruit and greens into me as well. It’s a few days of self care. I’m doing all I can to get back out. The plan is one more full zero and then an eight mile slack pack. I’ll go from a 30 pound pack to about 6 pounds. 
The bus took a late arrival to town to shop. The kitchen is busy, hikers cooking supper, lots of veggies and rice. Todays rain brought a lot of hikers in to dry out and clean up. The energy is contagious.Living the Dream Mule","Maine Roadhouse

The weather is clearing up and the hikers are clearing out today. I think by 9am it was me and two other hikers left. The Jen’s (hostel owners both named Jen) and a few workers started cleaning this place from top to bottom, getting it ready for todays hikers.
I’m feeling a lot better this morning then when I came in the other day. I didn’t realize how tense my whole body was when I arrived here. My mind was exhausted, not to mention the need for better food. 
Talking with other hikers has been extremely helpful. On the trail the conversation is different then at a hostel. The trail is about pushing to the next camp, at the hostel it’s for rehab and self care. Conversation at the hostel takes on a deeper meaning with more time to reflect and slow down. Good advice is offered by those that know it best - other hikers!
As the afternoon progressed other hikers started to arrive. At 5:30 the yellow bus took hikers to the grocery store, all of them are in the kitchen cooking and eating after several hard day’s of hiking.

Jen shuttled me to the trailhead parking lot around 9:30, from there I went around the gate and walked 1/2 mile on Caribou Road to the AT. My foot feels stiff and sore. I can live with that as long as I don’t feel pain like the other day. I take my time and let the foot warm up and try not to focus on it. 
I start climbing up South Crocker Mt, a 4040 footer. The ascent isn’t bad and before I know it I’m on the peak. After a few minutes of rest and water I continue north. Then decent a few hundred feet and climb again to 4228 feet to North Crocker Mt. I do this with a six pound day pack, it’s amazing how easy I climbed two 4000 footers with no weight on my back.

I woke up this morning at 0400, I’m anxious to leave today. The Jen’s made a terrific breakfast, biscuits and gravy, grits, eggs, fresh fruit and coffee. I paid my bill and loaded my pack on the yellow bus for the shuttle to route 27.
Four days ago I limped into the Maine Roadhouse physically/mentally spent with bad foot pain. The hostel staff and hiker community brought me back to life. I step away today feeling much better. 
I needed to pick up some meds for my foot but the pharmacy is 20 miles away and the script won’t be ready until after 1pm. Jen took my info and money for it and said “we’ll make it happen” when we got to the trail head the local Police Chief met us there and she handed him my info, he’s going to pick it up and deliver it up the trail for me! The Chief is a great guy he keeps a cooler of drinks in his cruiser for hikers and gives rides too. That’s the way policing should be. The trail provides.
As I step off heading north onto the trail it looks like we have at least four good days of weather ahead. The mosquitoes are still around and they are hungry this morning. I pace myself and go slow. I decided to do eight miles with my full pack rather than slack pack 17.7 miles, it’s further then I want to go on my foot and I’d be hiking in the dark. The trail is too rough for me to hike at night.
I passed Amazing Grace after about an hour, she was sitting on the side of the trail. Several slack packers passed me over the next few hours. The trail was rocks, roots and mud all day, very slow going. The hardest climb was the Horns. The views were terrific. The big prize of the day was Bigelow West at 4145 feet. The peak offered panoramic views, on the clearest of days you can see Mt Washington and Mt Kahtadin. I sat up there for awhile and talked with two section hikers, one was a 1995 thru hiker. By 4 pm I made it to the campsite and set up on a platform.  It rained for a half hour just after I set up. I got inside the tent and ate a whole loaf of home made bread that I packed out from the bakery, it was so good. An hour later Amazing Grace hiked in. It’s a relatively quiet camp tonight.

Other than the day hikers the backpackers I'm seeing are pushing to get to Kahtadin. They're worn and beyond trail hardened. Everyone's equipment is dirty, repaired with duct tape and plastic ties. My pack belt has built in pockets that are dry rotted. I have holes in the top and sides where mice have tried to chew their way into it. The pack has a putrid smell to it - yet I plan on sending to Osprey when I get home and see if it can be patched and fixed. It's become sentimental!
Within the first mile I peaked Bigelow Avery at 4088 feet. The peak is named after Myron Avery one of the founders and builders of the AT. The view was breathtaking, the sun was lifting the fog and dew from the valley, I felt blessed to be on this peak - what a great way to start my day.
By early afternoon I had the Bigelows behind me, from the ledges I could look back and see my hardwork, very gratifying.
I took two long breaks today to let my feet cool down, it paid off. I took my shoes off, massage and stretch my feet.
According to my notes from the AT Institute that I attended I noted that the hardest part of Maine is now behind me.  As I made my way down towards the road the trail conditions continued to improve, less rocks, roots and mud. The last mile was flat and an absolute joy to be on.
When I got to East Flagstaff Road trail magic was waiting and as promised my medication was there. The folks doing the magic are trail maintainers, hikers and former AT thru hikers. They grilled me two cheeseburgers. I had mac salad, a coke and hot coffee. I sat a good hour and exchanged stories with them. One of them has thru hiked four times! 
There's camping there above the parking lot, but one of the guys sent me down a trail a short distance to a seclude pond with a beach. I set up and had a nice yoga stretch all alone. Just before 7:30 Amazing Grace showed up with Tator and another hiker going SOBO. It's funny, Tator said your the guy that gave me some peanut butter at the hostel.

My tent was soaked inside and out, you think I'd know better by now, but it was worth it. I watched the sun go down over the water and listened to the Loons in the evening. The moon was out too.
The East Flagstaff Road Crew had breakfast and coffee on at 0700 just as promised and it was delicious. They get together every year after Labor Day and put on trail magic for a few days in this spot. Most of them are former thru hikers and trail maintainers. They're full of information about the trail and offer good food.
The trail was a gift today after what we've been hiking on. It had a nice roll to it and the conditions were much better, it felt good to stretch my legs and stride along.
After a few miles I stopped at West Carry Pond Lean-to for snacks and water. While there I spread my tent out and let it dry in the sunshine. For several miles this morning the trail bordered the water, you could hear Loons in the distance. People ask me if I listen to music or book with headphones? The simple answer is no, never have and don't plan too, I  want to hear Loons and all the other sounds in the forest.
As I hiked on to East Carry Pond Beach several hikers were resting and some were swimming. The water and beach were beautiful. There were ducks floating around. Further down the beach as I hiked on there was a tree down in the water, perched on it were several ducks all lined up. It will be in with my photos if you want to look.
At this point I hit the 10 mile mark and my goal for the day; however, it was only 2:30 and I felt like I had a few more miles in me. It's 10 more miles to the Kennebec River. If I can do a few more it will make a nice day tomorrow of 7-8 miles.

Around 0530 I got up and went in the lounge, they have nice thick comfortable rugs so I decided to get my body and feet ready before breakfast. I did a good yoga stretch and massaged medication into my feet. I'm a bit gimpy but I'm used to it as long as I don't over do it the pain is tolerable. It's not easy for me to hold back, my legs want to move. I'm on a section where I can go but I keep it at about two mph - that pace will get me there. 
Breakfast was at 0630, I tanked up on everything. I chatted with the Inn Keeper about crossing the Kennebec, he said that there has always been a form of transportation across the river but hikers do cross it on their own.
By 0730 I was on the shuttle back to the trailhead with Tater and Amazing Grace. I stepped off ahead of them but I'm sure we'll leapfrog as the day goes on. 
The mosquitoes were hungry this morning and I have plenty to offer. The sign at the trailhead warned of Goose Hawks dive bombing hikers! If you hear a screech prepare to defend yourselves with your hiking poles. It's a good thing when you can use a piece of equipment for multiple purposes. My poles are for hiking, holding up my tent and defense against Goose Hawks!
My first stop today was at Pleasant Pond Lean-to after about five miles. There was a 12 pack of Pepsi and a nice looking banana left for hikers. I had a Pepsi and took my shoes off, stretched and massage my feet. These breaks throughout the day are important and part of my day. I've always taken them but now I rest longer up to an hour and a half. After awhile AG and Tater showed up and checked in. They were pretty happy to see the Pepsi, I split the banana with Tater then I moved on down the trail. There was minor climbing for a few miles and the roots, mud and rocks of Maine but nothing like a few days back.
There's a lot of younger hikers in front and behind me. I like being around them they have good energy; in fact, there's not as many older hikers around me. The ones I run into seem to be alone. 
The plan is to make Shaws Hostel in three days. I was able to do 14 today, tomorrow I'm shooting for 13. Rain is expected but it's a doable goal. It leaves me with nine miles on Wednesday to get to the hostel. I already reserved a bunk for Wednesday and Thursday (zero.) 
The late start and long day got me to camp with just over an hour of light left. I like two hours so I can cool down, set up camp, filter water, stretch and cook. I did the last two in the dark.

I'm feeling good this morning my routine of slower pace, rest breaks and stretching seems to be helping.
I took my first break after mile four at the Bald Mt Pond Lean-to, still no rain. By the the time I took my second break at a tent site it started to rain. I had about five miles to go to reach days end so I got up and moved. I had to Ford across Marble Brook and then Ford W Branch Piscataquis River. Both went well, they were only knee deep.
I made it to the Lean-to by 2 pm, 13 miles. When I arrived there were four SOBOS sitting in it waiting for the rain to pass. One of them moved on and the other three decided to set up their tents. It was great for me I had plenty of room to set up, get cleaned and dry. I did my stretching and swept the place out. 
I cooked an early meal. I had an extra supper so I cook that one too, it was good and I needed it.  Around 5pm Marly and Tater came rolling in, a short time later Amazing Grace. AG is pretty excited she has nine miles to go and she's done with Maine, she's already done the 100 mile wilderness and Kahtadin. The four of us hike into Monson tomorrow.
I hiked completely alone today no one passed me from either direction and I didn't pass anyone. I don't recall another day on the AT that has happened.

The trail had rocks, roots and mud all day, but there were also long stretches of nice flat trail. 
For the first time in a long time I felt like I was floating at times. My body has become a calorie burning hiking machine and my legs moved today. I've been holding back my pace because of my feet but not today, I let myself go.
When I got to Nahmakanta Stream Road there was a nice wooden bridge about 12 feet above the stream. I decided this would be a good place to stop and eat. While there I would spread my tent out and let it dry, it was cloudy but you could feel the sun. We were in the wilderness and I didn't need to worry about traffic.  I also heated up water for coffee. While doing this I looked up and there's a Ranger wanting to drive over the bridge. So I grab my tent with one hand and my stove which was still on with the other hand and moved out of the way. Suddenly the breeze picks up and blows my tent into the flame of the stove and the next thing you know my tents on fire!

About two miles before camp I run into to Not Dead Yet! I can't believe I'm seeing him, I've been seeing him off and on since the White Mountains. He hikes real slow but some how he gets ahead of me and a week later I'll pass him.
When I finally get to camp Timber has a dynema patch for the whole I created in my tent and he gives it to me, and just like that I'm back in business. I set up in the shelter, rain is coming. Blue has a fire going and things seem perfect. 
Life is pretty simple on the trail we share and treat each other with respect.

I contemplated my situation and knew I would get up and move, I had 15 miles to get to Abol Bridge out of the Wilderness. By 0500 I was making coffee when Freeman came by the shelter with his read headlamp on, he looked at me and gave a thumbs up and walked away.  The sky opened up on him, full downpour, thunder and lightning!
As I drank my coffee I watched him disappear, it was epic! I packed up and by 0630 I was on the move.  The rain was steady all 15 miles with five or six downpours along the way. I couldn’t stop for more than five minutes or I’d chill quickly. I met up with Spider-Man we hiked together for awhile it was good to have company. The trail became a heavy stream of water that was a foot deep in places. 
We no longer tried to avoid it by hiking along the side of the trail, we hiked right thru it. It was quicker and less dangerous. Me and Spider-Man decided to split a cabin at Abol Pines if any were available. He’s a faster hiker so he goes ahead and will check on availability.
As I hiked on I saw a sign posted for south bounders. As I pass it I turn and see I’m leaving the 100 mile wilderness! Within a few minutes I’m crossing Abol Bridge and see a large sign in front of the store that says Open. I observe several hikers soaked to the bone like me. I drop my pack and go inside. Spider-Man says we got a shed for two nights if we want it. The weather is more favorable on Sunday so we decided to zero Friday and take the two nights.
The first thing I did was devour a tube of Pringles. The shed had six bunks, no electricity but it's out of the weather. We went into the restaurant first and ate, then showered and did laundry. The rain continued for a few more hours then it got windy and cold.

I spent the day eating in the store and restaurant and just hanging k around with hikers.  There's a lot of hikers coming out of the wilderness throughout the day - everyone has a story to tell and their all filthy! 
The sun comes out strong for a few hours and standing in front of the store is out of the wind so 15-20 hikers are there swapping stories. A lot of beers were drank and ice cream cones were eaten today. I shared my ice cream with the neighborhood black lab. 
Not Dead Yet showed up, we invited him into the shed. He was going to set up a tent in this wind and cold. So he joined us for the evening. There's a lot of anxiety about getting a spot in the Birches tomorrow with so many hikers here that want to summit on Sunday.

The word is out that Sunday is the day to summit rather than Saturday. Everyone is talking about getting to the kiosk to sign up for the Birches campsite. The way it works is the Ranger shows up around 0630-0700 and signs up the first 12 hikers for the Birches. It’s ideal because it’s nine miles away and brings you into Katahdin Springs where the Hunt Trail takes you up the mountain. If you get a spot you have fresh legs in the morning to hike the five miles up the mountain.
Me, Spider-Man and Not Dead Yet decided we’d get up at 0400 and walk out of Abol by 0430. It’s about 1/2 mile to the kiosk. At 0300 the wind was howling and Spider-Man saw headlamp light leaving the park so he woke us up and we packed our stuff and took off. We arrived at the kiosk at 0340 we were #’s 8, 9 and 10! Hikers started coming in after that, we all sat around wrapped in quilts, it was cold. By the time the Ranger arrive there were over 40 hikers waiting for 12 spots - it was crazy. As soon as he approved us I took off along with Spider-Man. I had every layer of clothing on that was in my pack when I stepped off. My joints were frozen as I slowly walked off. Movement is warmth, after two miles I finally felt better. I stopped and made coffee and had some food. I took off a few layers and kept on moving. 
The sun came out but the wind was blowing hard. I hiked all along the water today and started to enjoy this nine mile section. About seven miles into the hike Jem gave me a tip to go up to the Daicey Pond and check out the cabins, there’s a library in the middle cabin. The back porch has Adirondack Chairs that overlooks the pond and Kahtadin, it was beautiful. I sat there, had lunch and drank coffee. It was wonderful. 
I hiked along the pond for a while and suddenly I was at Kahtadin Springs Campground! I stood at the foot of Kahtadin after hiking Maine. I went to the Ranger Station to check in but they were out until 2pm, it was now 12:30 so I hiked up to the Birches and claimed a spot in Shelter. After 2pm I went back and registered with the Ranger.
I returned to camp and met most of the hikers for the first time that I will share my last trail night in Maine with. It’s all good, nothing but trail talk and reminiscing while sitting around the fire.Living the Dream Mule","Abol Pines

I past hikers breaking camp and wished them well. Spider-Man and I hiked this portion together. He’s 6’4” and 40 pounds lighter then me so it didn’t take long before he was ahead. I felt this incredible energy surge thru my body as I was hiking up this Mountain. After about half way Patches caught up to me. The look on his face was pure joy, his eyes were watering and he was laughing and yelling as he went by me. 
Then several of the young hikers started passing me, we were yelling and celebrating all the way up.
By 10 am I reached the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, Katahdin! I walked up to the sign and and reached out and touched it. The wind was blowing pretty good with temperatures about 40* it felt much colder. 
Several of us took turns taking photos, it was pure joy.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658582,"I arrived at Mosey's Hostel yesterday around 2 pm. I stayed the night rather than trying to get miles in in the late afternoon. This way I get a fresh start early morning after breakfast, and I get all the trail updates from Mosey. I was advised there's a guy hanging around the Wildcat Shelter about 38 miles north. He's been causing problems for hikers. I confirmed this in the FarOut app. I was planning to stop there but I'll just avoid it at this point.
Mosey dropped me off at High Point State Park where I got off in July with my foot injury. I crossed the street and continued my trek north. I started with the remainder of the NJ rocks, they lasted about 2-3 miles and that was the end of them. 
The trail is an extreme contrast to Maine. Minor hills, mostly flat, farmer's fields, roads and houses. Maine was ponds and wilderness. I could hear noise all day from machinery.
I took my first break at the ""Secret Shelter.""  It's on private land .2 miles off the AT. The owner is a former thru hiker, he lets you stay there. It has electricity and a heater, also a spigot. I stopped for lunch and Jake the donkey came and joined me on the porch. Yes, on the porch. When I didn't offer food fast enough he nudged me in the ribs and almost knocked me over! When I left I ran into four guys section hiking south on their way to the shelter. I told them Jake is hungry. I hiked on for the afternoon continuing to cross fields and roads. 
I hiked the outer perimeter of the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. There was a lot of water from yesterday’s rain. The refuge was full of ducks and geese. I saw two otters as I walked along the path. When I left the refuge and reentered the woods I took a short side trail to an old abandoned house that is owned by the Park Service, it has a water spigot on for hikers so I filled up my bottles. I also noticed an outside plug outlet so I tried it and it worked so I gave my phone a boost. From there I hiked about a mile to the shelter and set up. There’s one hiker set up in a hammock named Freight Train, he’s doing a section north to NY. Other than that the trail has been quiet today. Mosey told me most of the SOBOS have past thru already. 
If this is a sign of things to come it could be a quiet hike north.

It wasn’t until 0700 before we had meaningful light, by 0730 I was on the move. I planned to do at least 11.5 miles today to the next shelter. I started the day climbing. The hills in NJ aren’t killers compared to up north but they’re formidable.
The sun was out and the weather forecast looked great for today. One of the highlights was hiking the boardwalk section, it’s a half mile long. When I came to route 94 I took a left and went to the hot dog stand. It was too early, it wasn’t opened. But across the street was a large farm and store so I went inside,  they were taking freshly baked apple cider donuts out of the oven! Eight donuts and two large coffees later I felt content.
I had a pleasant surprise while I was there, Cowbell was there and said hello to me. I hiked some with him in Virginia and maybe Pennsylvania. We caught up on all the trail talk. He finished his thru hike a few weeks ago and was now driving back to different states to collect pins. When I left there I crossed the street and starting climbing “Stairway to Heaven.”  This was a challenging climb especially after eating eight donuts!
I arrived a few hours later at the shelter around 3 pm and decided to stay and relax. It was sunny out and my body is not very happy that it’s back out here after hiking Maine. Last night there were only three of us at camp, tonight there is 12 as of 6:30 pm. It’s starting to get dark, by 7 pm the light will be gone. I’ll adjust my hours out here as we lose light, but there’s plenty of time to get the daily miles in that I plan to do. For now I’ll step off by 0730 and end by 5pm.

I was able to share a lot of my experience with him and he had a lot questions. He was heading south this morning, we exchanged numbers he’s from North Adams, Massachusetts near the AT. He may be home when I’m going thru so he offered me a place to stay and transportation for resupply. Just like that a connection is made between two hikers that share a passion for the trail. 
I stepped off by 0715, on the move and feeling good. The weather today is perfect for hiking, partly cloudy in the 60’s. I hiked about four miles and entered NY. I have over 1900 miles of hiking  completed, for a guy with bad feet I’m pretty proud of that.
I had been warned about the rocks and ledges that NY greets you with for several miles. As I hiked thru it I kept waiting for it to be difficult, it was a Cake Walk compared to the north! Maine was hard, but for my money nothing has been as tough as the White Mts!
I hiked to route 17A took a left and just up the road was a hotdog stand. I ate four hotdogs, chips, Pepsi and a Gatorade - then I went a bit further up the road to Bellvale Farm and had a large vanilla ice cream cone. They have an outdoor spigot and charging area for hikers so I gave my phone a quick blast. After this I hitched into Greenwood Lake to resupply at Cumby’s. For the first time on trail I got a ride both ways. When I got dropped off at the trail head I had about 2.5 miles to go to get to Wildcat Shelter. It rained briefly on the way in but that was it. I wasn’t planning on staying here as this is where reports of some weird guy had been bothering hikers, but I spoke with a Ridge-runner yesterday and she told me that there hadn’t been any problems for several days.

I ran into one SOBO early in the day his trail name is Talkshow. He was glowing with excitement and didn’t stick around long.
Within the first eight miles I hiked up Black Mt and passed two shelters. The shelters were built by the CCC a long time ago they’re made out of rock and cement, one of them had a makeshift fire place inside that was still burning when I went by. The concentration of hikers was pretty heavy here. I needed something to motivate me and keep my head in the game so I decided to pass every day hiker in front of me. I felt strong and started to move. One by one I passed about 40 of them. I can be competitive with myself once I get going but it takes my mind off of myself, which is good. 
The trail maintenance or maybe the ATC set up a bypass around the Palisades Highway for safety reasons. You have to get across four lanes of traffic that is moving fast. The map showed the bypass going way around and I was told it isn’t marked well. I wasn’t having the bypass, I got across without too much trouble. I just had to wait and run like crazy.
Today I felt a little crazy. When I got to Bear Mt the trails had even more people. I had day hikers asking me for directions. The Mt has a lot of rock steps built in. The foot traffic was nuts, so I did my thing and stepped on the gas. I passed groups of hikers all the way up and all the way down. On the top I went for the high price vending machines ($4 for a nutty buddy). I had an ice cream, three bags of chips and two sodas. 
When I arrived at the Bear Mt Recreation Area it was packed with people and families at picnic tables. There were venders selling food I wanted some but ever since being in the military I refuse to stand in line unless I have no choice - I had a choice.
My choice was to cross the Hudson River and keep going, but before I did I finally saw a bear on the AT, It was at the Trailside Zoo (does this count?)
I had about 15 miles in at this point and I was starting to feel it. But there was no stealth spots here. After crossing the Hudson I road walked a ways and reentered the woods to make a finalclimb up Anthony’s Nose, it was a formidable climb. I got within .5 miles of Hemlock Springs Campsite and decided to veer off into the woods and set up. The comments on FarOut say the campsite has a lot of broken glass - too close to the road.

I had a good breakfast and did a three day resupply - it was expensive but it’s what is available out here. A short time later I passed thru the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center on Franciscan Way. There’s a baseball field where they let hikers stay at and there’s a pavilion where you can charge your phone. Seemed like a nice place to rest or pitch a tent but I moved on thru.
By 4pm I reached the campsite and decided after 13 miles it was good enough for the day. They have a spigot and a privy, what’s not to like. I met Blaze and Dave at the spigot, they’re doing a section south. I joined them at camp and set up. We had dinner and chatted awhile, they were good company.

When I crossed 301 I stopped at the kiosk to read any updates or notices. As I looked up there was a new roll of toilet paper sitting there. The trail provides because I needed a roll! I then pushed onto the RPH Shelter and had a coffee. This is an impressive shelter with mattresses on the bunks, a mowed lawn and lawn furniture. The privy had toilet paper too (that’s a big deal.) from here I had a five mile push to NY Route 52, when I got there I had a .4 mile road walk to the Deli/Market.

During the night the compressors out back kept coming on, the traffic was loud and at 0230 the cement plant started up! I could hear trucks backing up, then the dumpster guy showed up to empty it - needless to say it was a loud night - I couldn’t push my ear plugs in any further for fear I’d have to go to the ER to have them removed.
Despite all this I feel good today. At 0600 I unplugged my anker (it was charged) from the side of the building then I rounded the corner and bought two large coffees from the market. By 0730 I was on Route 52 hiking back to the trail. Tinder also stayed there last night so I had some company. 
I hiked about four miles to the Morgan Stewart Shelter. The sun was out so I unpacked my tent and quilt and let them dry in the sun. They had a lot of moisture and condensation on them from the grassy campsite. Tinder showed up a few minutes later and did the same thing. We both hung out for a good hour and took our time enjoying the morning. It’s about eight miles to Telephone Pioneers Shelter which is where I plan on staying tonight. Tinder stepped off about 20 minutes before I did. Then a day hiker showed up needing directions, which I gave and then I was on the move again. This section of trail has been dryer today so carrying full bottles is important. When I got to Old Route 55 I crossed railroad tracks and a bike path to a nice flowing water source. I sat for a few minutes and tanked up my belly and my bottles before moving on.
I feel like a submitted more today to the trail which made me slow down a bit, hike less distance, take more breaks and notice the blanket of gold leaves that lay on the forest.

I was training for this years AT thru hike, he’s a former thru hiker so we had a lot to talk about for five days, he gave me a lot of good tips and advice. He follows my trail journal so knows where I am. Leebo was helping another friend hike the trail and offered to help me as well.
We met on Route 341. It was great seeing him.  He brought me to Kent CT.  We went and had pizza and calzone. After we ate he slack packed me for about seven miles. When I stepped off with about a five pound pack it felt wonderful. 
I was grateful for Leebo going out of his way for me. It was such a moral booster. He offered to slack pack me more tomorrow I’m looking forward to it.Living the Dream Mule","10 Mile River Shelter

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658843,"I shared camp last night with a Boy Scout Troop and a hiker named Alrighty. He was out for the weekend and lives in the area. As usual we had good conversation regarding the trail. By 0730 I was on the move, the first few miles I walked on a flat trail with hay fields on one side and river on the other. The foliage was bursting. I saw pink leaves throughout the day on different wild bushes, I don’t recall seeing the color pink before. 
After a few miles I met LeeBo for a second day of slack packing. The weather was sunny and cool, perfect for hiking.  Connecticut has surprised me, it’s not a state that is talked about on the AT. I call it the rolling ass kicker. The hills aren’t real high but they are tough, compact and arduous.  By noon time LeeBo met me with lunch at a road crossing. He handed me a Buffalo chicken wrap, after I inhaled it I ate half of his wrap too, along with chips and a blueberry muffin.  I had another 8.5 miles to go after that, I thought it would take me until 6pm to do it, but with a day pack I was done by 4:10pm, I was moving thru the woods.
When I came out of the woods to Route 7 we chatted with a pair of SOBOS for awhile, then headed to Maria’s Place for the night. Maria puts hikers up in her home, she’s 93 years old! We went out to eat and talk trail before coming back for the night. It’s been a great day slack packing, eating good food and now a bed to sleep in.Living the Dream Mule","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

It was tough getting going this morning, at 0630 I came downstairs to make coffee. Before I could do it 93 year old Maria got up, came to the kitchen and made it for me. Then she told me I owed her $40 for last night. I put it on the table and she said tell Lee he owes me $40 too. Then she said she was going to lay back down.
Me and LeeBo sipped our coffees and strategized about todays hike, he slack packed me for a third day. It rained hard between 0630-0730 so we took our time heading out. When we did we went down the road to the Inn and got a breakfast sandwich and coffee. After that I was ready to go.
By about 0820 I was on the trail it drizzled all day and came down heavier a few times. It was 43* when I stepped off in shorts.
I was stiff and sore, a combination of pushing hard yesterday and the raw weather. The first mile I somewhat took it easy to warmup and then my legs took over and I was pushing close to three miles an hour for the first seven miles to route 44. Those of you that have followed me for awhile know that songs take over my thinking. Different things occur that remind me of a song and I can’t get it out of my head. When I went thru NY it was Frank Sinatra’s New York New York. Now that I’m approaching Massachusetts it’s Motley Crue’s Home Sweet Home. I did something on the trail today that I haven’t done, the service was good so I listened to Home Sweet Home on YouTube - it was great! The foliage is bursting and the rain didn’t faze me. Between the music, the light pack and my legs I was moving. 
When I got to route 44 LeeBo had a Pepsi, burger and fries waiting for me. It doesn’t get much better than that. 
After about a half hour break I got my body out of the car and started moving again for another seven miles. I felt pretty good, I wanted to get to the Mass line before I ended the day. When I peaked Bear Mt I knew I had it but had to descend a bad stretch of wet ledge covered by leaves, it was tricky but I cleared it. At the bottom LeeBo was waiting to show me where the CT/MA sign was. It was about 50 yards from the trail. After that we took a short side trail off the AT out to the car. This is where I’ll return tomorrow for another day of slack packing. LeeBo is a great guy with an excellent memory and knowledge of the trail. I realized today that he was coaching me. I’m grateful for the time he has taken to help me. That’s how it works in the hiking community.
We are spending another night at Maria’s Place due to heavy rain in the forecast.

The hardest hiking came in the morning. The afternoon was a lot flatter I was able to move at a good clip. Towards the end of the day I met a guy stopped on the trail taking a break he was heading north to Katahdin! He had the largest pack that I’ve seen since being on the AT and it was heavy. It was an 80 L Osprey. He plans to hike thru the Whites, Maine and peak Katahdin in December. I took hold of the pack and lifted it, it felt like over 50 pounds maybe 60! He didn’t have a trail name I told him his pack is a Tank and that should be his name - he liked it and took the trail name Tank.
I wished him well and move on. I was shooting for 18 miles but my foot started talking to me and rather than pushing it I called it at 16.5.  I’m at the Quality Inn in Great Barrington, MA tonight. LeeBo is going to slack pack me tomorrow for the last time. I’m very grateful to him for all that he’s done for me. He has a lot of knowledge of the trail and experience out here.

Today is the last day LeeBo slack packs me. It’s been a wonderful experience to have his help for multiple days now, he’s been more than generous.
We met at MA Route 23 for lunch and one last time at Blue Hill Road. I put my Osprey on and said good by. I had about three miles to go to get to the South Wilcox Shelter, or I could go another two miles to North Wilcox Shelter.
When I got to the South I decided to stay there, there’s a newly built shelter with good cell service. I set up and did some camp chores and caught up on a few things. It’s going to be cold tonight.

By 7pm I was wrapped in my 20* quilt, I had smart-wool Long John’s on, a puffy coat, hat and gloves, two pairs of socks and I was warm all night. 
By 0715 I was on the move. I needed to hike nine miles to Main Road where I’d meet my wife Judy. Along the way I crossed paths with Sparky, the last time I saw him he was coming out of the Mahoosuc Notch in Maine as I was going in. Sparky’s a flip-flopper on his way to Harpers Ferry, I admire his tenacity. 
As I hiked closer to the road I met Inch, another flip-flopper heading south. He was wearing sandals in the cold. He said he had just taken his socks off. He also told me he loved sandals and once your used to them they’re great. I’ll take his word for it, but I’m keeping my shoes on. 
When I arrived at my destination I studied the map at the kiosk - 55 miles to the Vermont border. Judy arrived a short time later. We had a nice afternoon catching up and went out to eat.

Then she drove north to the trailhead on RT 20 met up with me on the trail, and we hiked out together to the car for lunch. I continued on to County Road, and once again Judy drove north and met up with me on the trail.  When we hiked back out to the car she handed me a Subway sandwich to take to camp. I put my full pack back on and hiked two miles to the shelter.
The weather today couldn't have been better, a beautiful October day. A lot of the leaves have fallen and the forest floor is a blanket of brown and gold. The downside is you can't tell where the trail is, I got turned around numerous times. 
I met a fair amount of hikers today on the trail going south and I share camp tonight with a half dozen hikers out doing a section hike.
Many people are starting to ask what day and time I will finish. I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm for my hike. The short answer is I don't know. When I started in NY October 5th I said I wanted to be done by October 31st, I still have that date in mind and I think it's doable.

I had a nice steady pace and rhythm this morning for 8.8 miles to Kay Wood Shelter, where I stopped for lunch and coffee. Two day hikers came thru, we chatted for awhile, when they found out I was a thru-hiker they gave me two bananas and two oatmeal bars.
I proceeded 2.5 miles into the town of Dalton. The AT goes thru the town for about 1.5-2 miles. I stopped at Cumberland’s and bought a few days of food, a sandwich and Pringle potato chips to take to camp for supper. It was nice walking thru town it reminded me of Hot Springs, NC. The AT symbol is imbedded into the sidewalk in both communities as you pass thru.
The last few miles getting to camp I reentered the woods for a long steady climb. It was tough after 14 miles but I dug in and did it.
I spent a lot of time again today looking for the trail, getting turned around. The leaves have buried the path. The white blazes helped when the were close together, other times I was searching in a circle to find the next marker.
I’m sharing camp with two other hikers. One was in his tent when I arrived the other is a day hiker doing and overnight. He’s got a fire going. I had dinner with him but hiker midnight calls after a long day.Living the Dream Mule","October Mountain Shelter

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658966,"I left camp at 0750 this morning. The plan was to go to the Mark Noepel Shelter nine miles away before the rain came at 2pm, but the forecast pushed the rain out to late in the evening. So I thought I’d see about going over Mt Greylock to the next shelter at 16.2 miles. With rain coming in overnight into Monday it would be nice to clear the Mt.
The early part of the day the trail rolled nicely, mostly flat. When I got to Cheshire, MA the trail turned into a road walk for about a mile, then it entered a field that went to Route 8. I took a short detour to the Shell Station and went inside to Dunkin Donuts. I had a large coffee and four donuts. I would’ve had more but the donuts weren’t homemade.  When I reentered the woods I climbed for a good two miles working my way to the first shelter. A few hikers were there that I chatted with. I took my shoes off and and stretched my feet, had a snack and decided to moved on. 
The elevation gain to Greylock was gradual and easy. The final mile up the trail crossing the road to the top three times, still at a reasonable elevation gain. I started passing day hikers on the final ascent which gave me another gear - I felt good. When I peaked I found out the Lodge closed yesterday. The Mt was covered with day hikers and people that drove up. 
I didn’t want to cool down so I moved along. I had about four miles to get to camp so I kept going. I can feel the air changing, rains coming. With the fall temperatures I’m glad to be in the shelter for the night. Keeping dry means keeping warm.Living the Dream Mule","Crystal Mt Campsite

I switched out my full pack for a day pack. I slack packed about seven miles to County Road in Vermont. Yes, I left Massachusetts behind today, I’m in the final 51 miles of my journey in the last state.
It’s become a mental journey for me at this point there’s no part of the trail my body can’t handle, even my feet feel better. The tough part is keeping my head in the game everyday. It’s become a different trail now. All the hikers moving north to Katahdin that I once hiked with are done and gone. The trail is quiet, much of the services for hikers here in the north has shut down for the season. So with that said I find conversation with day hikers, section hikers and the one or two SOBO’s that pass me each day. 
As I passed into Vermont I reflected on Massachusetts my home state. This is the first time I’ve hiked the whole AT in MA. I’m impressed with the trail work and maintenance throughout. The shelters are in good shape and spacious. The privy’s are well maintained and all the shelters and campsites have Bear boxes. The only recommendation I’d make is better white blazes at turns.

I decided to go home for the night, it allowed me to shower, do laundry and resupply for the LAST time!

The temp was 61* and humid when I started, by the time I got to Bennington it was 75*. I moved pretty good considering the trail was full of mud, they don’t call Vermont “Ver-mud” for nothing.
When I met Judy at the parking lot she had an Italian Grinder for me, chips, Gatorade, large coffee, two donuts and a pumpkin muffin (she must read my post!) This will be the last time I slack pack.

The only visit was from a mouse running around.  The rain was light off and on throughout the night, it held off all day today, that was nice. It’s humid today about 60* I was soaked with sweat all day. If there’s one thing I won’t miss is wet clothes day after day. The thought was to get to Kid Gore Shelter and if I felt good enough I’d push the additional four plus miles to Story Spring Shelter.
The first stretch to Goddard Shelter was a little over eight miles and it was work getting there. Two hikers passed me going south with little to say, a short time later another one was doing a section, we chatted briefly. I noticed he had a big can of bear spray on the side of his pack, really not necessary out here with black bears. When I got to Goddard I took a nice rest, ate food and drank water from the pipe - it was really good water.
I pushed on another four plus miles to Kid Gore. It must’ve rained there last night the inside of the shelter was pretty wet, the floor and lower bunks were wet. The decision was made to move onto Story Spring another four plus miles. I found the trail tedious today, all I did was dig in and hike. I paid no attention to what was going on around me, just in front of me. I neither enjoyed or resented the trail I just hiked it to get the miles in to set me up for the last two days. 
I share camp tonight with two guys doing a section of the LT (Long Trail). One of them has been trying to get a fire going with wet wood for over an hour while the other cooks a meal fit for kings.

The two section hikers, Tom and Gregg that I shared camp the previous night showed up and a Flip-Flopper named Optimist came into camp at dark. It’s amazing how quickly and how much AT hikers talk to each other. As soon as Optimistic found out I was done today with my hike he was thrilled. He’s on his way to Harpers Ferry to finish his hike. We decided that the other two at camp needed trail names. Tom is a Chef and carries a lot of stuff with him and cooks like he’s home. So he was given the name Chef Boyardee. We decided we’d have to sleep on it to come up with one for Gregg.  I awoke to a cold morning and started to move to warm up. I made coffee and retrieved my food bag from the bear box. I gave Optimistic some extra food and a canister of fuel, he was thrilled. Then I performed my last official duty as an AT hiker and gave Gregg the trail name Ravioli, seeing how he and Boyardee were such good friends it seemed to work. I told him it’s an honor to be given a trail name from a thru hiker (I made that up!) then I stepped off for one final hike to complete my journey.
I felt light and relaxed as I hiked. It took about a 1/2 mile to warm up, my legs felt strong. I was aware of everything going on around, the mud under my feet, the crunching leaves and the sun on my right shoulder. All the leaves are off the trees and the smell of the woods is intoxicating - I will miss that. I filtered and drank fresh water flowing along the trail. I wondered how many liters of water I’ve filtered since Georgia as I filtered my last one.
I decided to take a few minutes to sign the log book at Spruce Peak Shelter, it’s an enclosed cabin. As I approached it I could see smoke coming from the chimney, inside were three friends out for a few days. We chatted briefly I signed the log and hiked the last three miles to my awaiting family in the parking lot. When I got about a mile away my oldest son Corey yelled to me from afar. This was a special moment for me as we embraced. Last year he was diagnosed with cancer, I didn’t think I’d be hiking the AT once we found out, but he went thru treatment and is WELL! I cried as I embraced him. We hiked a short distance together and met up with my wife Judy and my younger son Justin. The hugs and joy continued.
I’ve had two special endings on the AT, Katahdin on September 25th and today in the woods, on the trail with my family, pure exhilaration!
After we arrived in the parking lot and took photos we headed home to Massachusetts, but first we stopped at the Dam Dinner in Townshend, Vermont, where they got to watch me eat!
Around 4pm I arrived home, took a shower, a sauna, ate more food and I’m now relaxing in my recliner - life is good.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659280,"The AT for 2022 is 2,194.3 miles long, my total is over by a few miles. I used the AWOL Guide and the FarOut App to measure distance everyday, I found each one could be a little different, so over that long a stretch there’s a discrepancy, sorry about that. But I assure you I hiked and walked past all the White Blazes the entire length of the trail. I didn’t yellow blaze, blue blaze or aqua blaze to cut corners. I hiked north the entire way with one exception, I slack packed south from the Vermont/MA border to Route 2 in MA. I slack packed once in NC and once in Maine when my feet were in bad shape. My friend LeeBo and my wife Judy slack packed me a few days in CT/MA/VT. It made a big difference in the health of my feet and I should’ve done more of it along the way (stubborn mule). There’s no one way to do the trail as long as you hike the miles.
To recap, I started March 16, 2022 on Springer Mt in Georgia. I got off the trail July 5th in Port Jervis, NY with painful plantar fasciitis. After a month of rehab I  got back on the trail on July 31st. I felt if I went back to NY I wouldn’t clear Katahdin in time before it closed so I started In Manchester, Vermont and peaked Katahdin September 25th. I returned to Port Jervis, NY on October 5th and finished in Manchester, Vermont October 28th completing my thru hike. I don’t consider myself a flip flopper. I didn’t intentionally hike to a certain point and flip up or down the trail then return. In addition, for the most part those that did flip flop returned and hiked south to fill in the gap - I was north all the way.
I’ve been asked a lot about expense, favorite parts, hostels, hardest states, sections etc. This is based on my opinion and experience. I don’t know exactly what it cost and I don’t really care. I didn’t go without and I didn’t overspend. I paid for the experience of a lifetime.  My favorite hostel was the Maine Roadhouse, without a second thought! Favorite state is Virginia, absolute beauty. Hardest state was Maine. The hardest section was the White Mts, it’s the only section of trail that I had two bad days. Every past injury and scar from my 61 years of life hurt when I arrived in Gorham! 
Physical vs mental. For me getting to Damascus was all physical, could I do this day after day and hold up, yes! I developed pain in my right foot early on in Georgia and it never left me. Pain was part of my journey. The trail became mental after Damascus, I narrowed my focus short term and shorter mileage days. I can say with honesty even the few bad days I had I never wanted to quit and I never wanted to go home. I kept a strong mental focus, I’m most proud of that.
I needed a strong mental mindset for the final hike north from NY—VT, it was a different trail now. All the hikers traveling north were gone. The  usual energy on trail was gone, I missed having them to talk to and strategize with. Most days SOBO’s passed me, some would stop and talk most kept moving. The last two weeks on trail I had the trail and camp mostly to myself. I’m an introvert by nature, it served me well during the last few weeks. Physically I felt great even my feet, it was all mental, I tried to find something everyday to keep moving.
I hiked the first 300 miles with RP Calculator and the next 200 with Ranger Randy. I hiked an additional 200 miles with RP from Killington, Vermont to Gorham, NH. I love these guys they were great to hike with and I treasure my time with them and friendship. What I learned about myself with both of them is I don’t plan long term and I don’t have the same focused goals as they did. Both of them are meticulous planners. They’d know where they wanted to be weeks in advance. In addition, they’d put up big mile days to achieve their goals. I don’t plan like that, my brain doesn’t work that way. I get to a resupply point and look at the next resupply point and decide how many days food I needed. I don’t look much beyond that. When I hiked alone I enjoyed the trail more, I slowed down, took more breaks and took better care of my body. There were people I hiked with throughout the trail and usually see them at camp at least every few days. But generally I moved alone.
There’s many hikers that were part of my journey but there’s a few I’m very grateful for, they lifted my spirit and fed my soul - they probably don’t even know it. I’d like to thank, RP Calculator, Ranger Randy, Willow, McLovern, Jeff, Clause, Parkour, Jetpack, Droplet, Suspenders, Sprite, BeeBop, Nash Vegas, Honey, Hill Flower, Beef Jerky, F-log, Spider-Man, Not Dead Yet, Amazing Grace and Tater. There’s certainly more that I’m forgetting but you guys I love! I also need to say how much I appreciate Thom driving to Springer Mt with me an RP. LeeBo for slack packing me and Lumphy for providing rides to NY. I won’t forget Lexie and her husband for inviting me into her home in Harpers Ferry, that was a gift. But the biggest thank you goes to my wife Judy and my boys Corey and Justin. Your support and love never wavered - thank you I love you. 
So what did I learn?1, It’s amazing what your body will do if you ask it.2, Hiking with people or with a tramily you make decisions collectively. After a while for me this gets old. When I start saying yes but knew it wasn’t the decision I’d make on my own I knew it was time to step away. It’s just what works for me. Hike your own hike.3, There’s no one way to hike the trail, as long as you do the miles.4, You can read all the books you want, watch YouTube and talk with people, but it’s not until you spend an extended period of time on the trail that you’ll know what it’s all about and if you can do it.5, One day at a time.
Equipment and training. I can’t tell you how many people I met that said they never trained and seemed to be doing just fine! For me personally I trained a lot for a few solid years, this included hiking the Long Trail. It gave me a chance to train with the equipment I was planning to use, and yes it changed. I strived to go ultra light and keep my pack weight under 28 pounds with four days of food and one liter of water. 
I used three different packs,  a Zpack Haul 65 liter, a Osprey Atmos 65 AG and a Hyperlight 40 liter. My Osprey is by far the heaviest of all three and it’s the most comfortable. It weighs almost three pounds more than the other two packs. The frame on the Zpack failed me, I liked the Hyperlight but it didn’t have the tension straps to get pressure off my neck.Bottom line my Osprey served me the best and was worth the weight.
Tent, I used a Zpack Duplex the entire hike. It’s super light, easy to set up. Excellent in good weather, ok in bad weather, but failed me when I needed it most in real bad weather. The condensation inside could be terrible too.
Sleeping bag/quilt. I had a tough time getting used to a quilt but once I did it was fine. I used a 20* bag from Feathered Friends, a 20* and a 40* quilt from Enlightened. All of these were ultra light and served me well. If I did it over again the same time of year I’d use a 10* for the Smokies and a 50* for the warm months.
When I decided to start a trail journal I thought it would be a good way to document my hike for my family and friends. I’ve never used social media so I didn’t know what to expect. Once I put my info in and had 100 views I was shocked! Never did I imagine I’d have over 116,000 views! All of you helped move me thru the trail, and you helped me get back on after my injury. I felt I had a responsibility to you. So many of you invited me into your homes for morning coffee. I hope I inspired a few of you to do the trail or another challenge that you’ve dreamed of.  Is there another trail in my future? I’m sure there is but for now I’m grateful for the AT and all it’s given me. I found the trail is about the people along the way, the energy, the pain, the joy, the stories and the reason why they’re out there.

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659347,"Pictured above is me and Eagle Eye an AT hiker and friend who was helpful preparing me for my AT journey.
I’ve been asked by friends and family how it’s been since getting off the trail, how I’m adjusting, weight loss, weight gain. Many still ask about expense and what it cost. These are good questions that I thought I’d try to answer.  Here’s what has gone on over the past few weeks since I’ve been home.
I lost 25 pounds in the first two months of the hike. Over the next few months I slowly put back on 15 pounds my weight stabilized after that. I finished the hike 10 pounds lighter than when I started. I can tell by the way my clothes fit that a lot of mass on my upper body, chest, arms and shoulders is gone and my legs are toned and lean.
Fortunately my appetite slowed after a few days and I’m getting the desire for fruits and vegetables again; however, my love for ice cream remains.
I decided to have my blood work done to see how my trail diet affected me and to see if I was lacking anything. Surprisingly everything came back within normal limits and my overall cholesterol was down 20 points! 
Physically I feel pretty good, I’m just tired during the day so I’ve been taking it easy and doing a lot of self care. I’ve gone on two short hikes, I love the Fall in New England. 
I sleep good at night but I’m obviously not wearing myself out with hours of hiking during the day. More than likely I’ll have to make some adjustments pretty soon. Right now my body loves the rest.
As far as cost, the biggest expense was buying equipment. I used three packs throughout my hike but only bought one. My Osprey pack I’ve had for several years, a Hyperlight I purchased from REI and ended up sending it back for a refund and the Zpack and tent I used cost about $1000. The sleeping bag two quilts and air mattress cost about $1700. Another big expense was a Torrid jacket (puffy) and a rain jacket both from Enlightened about $400. There was a lot of other smaller items like Smart wool clothing and dry bags for waterproofing, and stove that I’m not sure of the price. Let me say this, anything you love or get involved in like hiking, skiing, cycling, paddling it cost money to purchase gear, none of it is cheap. 
As far as food goes on trail I didn’t keep track. If I resupplied where it was limited because of location, the prices were higher than in town where there was a market. I usually bought what I could get wherever that was; Otherwise, your paying for a shuttle to bring you into town, wait at the store and bring you back - this can be expensive. I didn’t have much luck hitching so I bought what I could where I could. I wasn’t picky when it came to food. I also wasn’t shy when it came to hiker boxes. Most hostels, outfitters and some hotels/motels had these. It’s a box where hikers can leave equipment and food for other hikers. I took food out of boxes all the time saving myself money. Most hostels cost $35 for a night that price usually included pickup and drop off at the trail head. The $35 dollars somtimes included laundry, or it was an additional $5. You never have enough clothes for a full load so three and four people shared the load and price.
I stayed in hotels early in the hike splitting the room with others but it’s not always an ideal experience so I would get my own room, that gets expensive. The further north you go the more a room cost. I stayed in hotels/motels only when I had to. For example, when no hostels were a available and I needed to get out of heavy rain.
I went thru six pairs of shoes. I started the trail wearing a pair of Merrill boots. When I got to Damascus I switched to Hoka Speedgoats. I went thru five pairs of them. I probably could have done it with three or four pairs but I never went more than 400 miles on a pair due to my foot issues. I payed between $90-$140 per pair.
Mailing cost were another expense, although I didn’t receive food it was mostly exchanging equipment. I’m not sure what that cost I didn’t keep track. There was also the occasional campsite/shelter fee of $5-$10 that I paid. I’m sure there’s more but I didn’t keep track. 
I’m glad to be home but I miss the trail.",,View Entry,"Nov 09, Wed",0

Mule,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659621,"I received my 2000 miler patch and certificate from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy this past week. So I guess it’s official, I’m an AT thru hiker! I’ve pretty much blended back into home life, I think about the the trail everyday, all the great people I met and the places I’ve seen.
There’s another long hike in my future for sure; however, next hiking season I will stay closer to home hiking some of the trails in my area.  Stay safe, healthy and happy new year!Living the Dream Mule",,View Entry,"Dec 27, Tue",0
