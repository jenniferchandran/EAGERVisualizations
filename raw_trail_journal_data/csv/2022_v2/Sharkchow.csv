He's joined by two South Carolinians, Snowman (center) and Wizard (right), who've been on the trail already for several weeks. 
It rained this morning, so they left Hanover around noon, and walked about 10 miles. ""Need trail legs,"" Sharkchow texted from his hammock, set up near Moose Mountain Shelter. ""Where are my trail legs?""
""Time for sleep,"" he continued. ""Hoping trail legs arrive tomorrow.""","Hanover, NH

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655619,"The Three Musketeers – Sharkchow, Snowman, and Wizard – made it to Hexacuba Shelter on Mt. Cube today. For Sharkchow, at least, this was no picnic. The last one and a half miles were ""torture,"" he says. ""I was running on an empty tank."" Wasn't sure if he could keep going. Still waiting for trail legs to show up... 
He didn't send any pix, so I'm sharing another fun one from Hanover. Lou's Bakery gives out free donuts to hikers, and Snowman was happy to partake. Sharkchow scarfed his down, then took this pic. -- Mrs. Sharkchow","Moose Mountain Shelter

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655623,"Sharkchow and Wizard got a ride to the north side of Mr. Moosilauke (4,800 feet), then hiked south with lighter packs - ""slack-packing."" The idea was to reach the top of Moosilauke before an expected storm. Then, if I understood correctly, they made their way to Kinsman Notch. I may have this all completely wrong, but whatever they did, I know they've hiked every inch of that part of the trail, whichever way they were going.  Somewhere in there they also got a ride to Lincoln, NH, and Sharkchow picked up the resupply package he had mailed himself from DC before he left. 
Wizard didn't join them in their hike, sadly, as he developed knee problems and had to drop out. He got a ride to Lincoln, NH, and from there headed to South Carolina.

Sharkchow's legs are getting better. ""I'm training up and moving forward,"" he said in a text Friday night from his hammock. The challenge is to eat enough food, even without much of an appetite. 
Weather got nice and cool in the evening. Might have dropped into the 40s that night, he said.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655625,"Sharkchow and Snowman hiked into Lincoln, NH, dropped their packs at their destination - Chet's Place - then headed straight to McDonald's, Sharkchow's favorite restaurant. And what about Snowman? Apparently he's OK with Golden Arches. 
They're doing laundry and shopping, basically enjoying civilization, including another restaurant for dinner.
""This town is full of hikers, everybody's walking funny,"" says Sharkchow. Well, maybe it's just the older hikers who are walking funny, he admitted when I questioned the ""everybody"" part. ""The young people, they just prance around."" 
""We're in the mountains now. We're in the Whites."" Next up: Franconia Ridge.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655740,"Sharkchow and Snowman made it to Ethan Pond Shelter today. 14.5 miles. 
But the big accomplishment was by yours truly: reserving two bunks at Madison Spring Hut for Wednesday night, Aug. 3, per their request. I had to wait all day for 2 cancellations, and then I pounced. Not cheap, but Sharkchow says it's worth it - big dinner, 2 beds in the bunkhouse, and big breakfast. -- Mrs. Sharkchow","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655742,"Sharkchow and Snowman arrived at Nauman Tentsite, near Mizpah Spring Hut, right before it rained. Though it didn't rain long. By early evening, things had dried out, and the weather was cooler. It's been really hot and humid. 
""Tons of hikers here,"" says Sharkchow. ""You wouldn't believe how many hikers are here."" 
Have his trail legs arrived? Not yet. ""The first 100 miles were OK. Maybe they'll come in the second 100 or third 100!"" He laughs. ""It's pretty... yeah."" 
Two or three more days in the Whites, then they'll spend some quality time in Gorham, NH. But first: a night of luxury at Madison Spring Hut... after climbing Mount Washington.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655860,"Sharkchow and Snowman left Mizpah early Wednesday morning and reached the top of Mt. Washington (6,288') by midday. Mt. W is famous for its crazy, fickle, suddenly dangerous weather, but today was gorgeous - breezy, cool, blue sky, no clouds. 
""You could see Canada, you could see forever,"" says Sharkchow. ""If there are five perfect days in a year on top of Mt. Washington, this was one of them."" 
They reached the top just as the cog railway was disgorging large quantities of people. But no problem - it meant someone was around to take their picture. Our hikers also availed themselves of the cafeteria, where they had clam chowder and Coke. Snowman also had a chili dog. 
Then it was on to Madison Spring Hut for all-you-can-eat dinner and beds in the bunkhouse. 
One more thing: Sharkchow got a kick out of seeing kids in Camp Owatonna T-shirts, running up the rocks toward the top of Mt. Washington. Our kids and my brothers went to Camp Owatonna (in Harrison, Me.), many years ago.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655873,"Thursday morning at Madison Spring Hut, Sharkchow and Snowman tanked up at the all-you-can-eat breakfast, then hit the trail.
Upon arrival at Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Notch, ""I literally walked into the shower in my clothes,"" says Sharkchow. Then he peeled everything off and laid it all out to dry on the hot rocks outside. I'm going to assume he wore alternative clothing for the public portion of this exercise. 
Dinner at Joe Dodge Lodge was a feast: barbecued beef, chicken tenders, Brussels sprouts, salad, two glasses of milk, and Key lime pie. 
The plan for Friday is to hike over the Wildcat mountains and wind up at the Imp Campsite.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655986,"Sharkchow and Snowman arrived at Imp Campsite at 8 pm after a miserable day of hiking. It rained only a half hour, but that made everything wet and slippery. 
""The trail was very steep up and very steep down,"" says Sharkchow. ""There were wipeouts.""
On top of that, it's hot and really humid. ""My shirt and pants were so wet from sweat, when it rained I could only get dryer.""
In 2019, when he thru-hiked the whole AT, the weather was much nicer on this part of the trail - not too hot, not especially humid. Even then, he recalls, ""I had said, I'm never doing this again. And here I am, doing it again.""

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655989,"Today was another ""brutal"" day of hiking for Sharkchow and Snowman. Lots of tricky spots to figure out - such as, how to get down from a ledge that's maybe 7 or 8 feet high. But the real challenge was the heat. 
""If it were cooler, I'd be a lot better,"" says Sharkchow. 
They arrived in Gorham, NH, midday and checked in at The Barn Hostel. Then it was off to McDonald's for ""the obligatory feast."" The McDonald's was a mile away, and Snowman suggested they hitch. After five minutes, a woman pulled over and took them to their destination. 
""She was very friendly,"" says Sharkchow - and even offered to wait while they got their takeout, which she did. Note to Mrs. Snowman: Just to be clear, she had no designs on these guys, Sharkchow says. He laughed when I asked. She's a hiker herself, he said, and just wanted to be helpful to two people who were clearly legit hikers and not some homeless guys. 
Another observation: There were ATVs all over Gorham. ""There must have been an ATV convention here,"" says Sharkchow. ""All the hotel parking lots were full of ATVs."" 
On their way to Walmart (for resupply), courtesy of the hostel shuttle, the guys witnessed a road rage incident between an ATV and a car, which involved one of them swerving into oncoming traffic, but no collision. 
Tomorrow Sharkchow and Snowman will take a ""zero"" in Gorham. The weather is still bad: Hot and humid, no breeze, just heat.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656042,"Sharkchow and Snowman enjoyed their ""zero"" in Gorham on Sunday with a $10 day pass at the local hotel indoor pool (and jacuzzi and sauna). Sharkchow skipped the sauna but Snowman did all three. It's still really hot and humid out. 
More rain expected this week, which is a good thing. Water sources are running low in some places; that could be an issue in Maine.
Breakfast at Dunkin's: two Boston cream donuts and a glass of lemonade. Also an encounter with a local guy - an opportunity to find out what was up with all the ATVs. ""Yeah, the bastards, they're all coming up from Massachusetts,"" the guy said, using a colorful term for Mass. residents. There was, in fact, an ATV convention in nearby Berlin, NH.
Snowman noticed the local had a pistol tucked into his pants, no holster, and asked if NH was an open-carry state. Which it is - NH famously does not regulate firearms. ""The laws are given to us by God and God alone,"" the man said. The pistol was an automatic. 
-- Mrs. Sharkchow 
p.s. My NH brother-in-law, who owns various firearms, read this post and says there's no such thing as an ""automatic pistol."" Must be a semi-automatic. I'm sure I heard wrong!","The Barn Hostel, Gorham NH

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656179,"Sharkchow and Snowman landed at Gentian Pond Campsite after a 10-mile hike. It was crowded - ""a ton of thru-hikers,"" says Sharkchow. 
Funny story from Sunday at the hotel pool: There was a large guy from Berlin (NH) in the hot tub, and then Snowman gets in. Sharkchow is in the pool. Large Guy points to Sharkchow and asks Snowman, ""Is that your son?"" Hardly! Sharkchow and Snowman are about the same age.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656181,"Monday's hike was a lot of up and down, and it seemed to take a while, compared with Sharkchow's memory of this section 3 years ago. ""I don't know what I was doing last time, but it went a lot faster,"" he said. 
The highlight was crossing the NH-Maine state line just before noon. Progress! 
Weird weather today. It poured rain, but Sharkchow was so hot he didn't even bother to put on his raincoat. Then it got cooler up high. Now they're in their hammocks, and it's actually cold out. He's using his down puffy jacket for the first time this trip. 
Tomorrow morning is the big show: Mahoosuc Notch. According to the AWOL guidebook, this is the ""most difficult or fun mile of the AT. Make way through jumbled pit of boulders.""

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656216,"Sharkchow and Snowman hiked Masoohuc Notch today - the most difficult section of the Trail. Or ""fun"" as the AWOL guidebook says. It's basically a bunch of boulders in a V-shaped valley, with deep crevasses. Three years ago, when Sharkchow thru-hiked the AT, he made it thru Mahoosuc Notch and Mahoosuc Arm just fine, and was glad he'd never have to do it again. 
""Last time it was sunny and dry,"" Sharkchow says. ""You could stand on the rocks and not careen out of control."" 
Going up Mahoosuc Arm was ""crazy, steep, slippery."" And of course it rained, ""because it wasn't slippery enough."" 
""It was like walking on ice,"" he says. ""It was terrible."" 
Now the guys are tucked in at Speck Pond Campsite, and the weather is blessedly cool. Sharkchow says it's a beautiful setting - a high lake on a mountain. The campsite itself isn't great, he says, but the surroundings are fantastic. ","Full Goose Shelter

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656343,"Thursday morning, Sharkchow and Snowman hiked from Speck Pond Campsite to the highway at Grafton Notch. With that, they completed a section of the AT widely considered the most challenging - crossing the presidentials in NH and through the Mahoosucs in southern Maine. Snowman then headed to Bethel, Maine, for resupply. Sharkchow, unfortunately, had to leave the trail to deal with a dental issue. 
Mrs. Sharkchow’s brother-in-law drove up from Concord, NH, to get him and on Friday, Mrs. Sharkchow’s sister took him to the dentist. Sharkchow cracked a tooth on something in a backpacker meal, and it will take a while to fix. Now he’s back in DC, and hopes to return to the trail, if possible. 
In the meantime, Snowman continues his trek north. Godspeed, Snowman.","Speck Pond Campsite
