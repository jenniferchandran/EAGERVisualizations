Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647122,"My wife and I bought a cabin in northern Georgia late last spring, and I've been doing a lot of my pre-hike preparation hiking in the mountains of northern Georgia, including a few hikes on portions of the Appalachian Trail. Lately, I've come across more and more thru-hikers as I day-hike on the AT, which has made me even more excited to get going. I've even been to the top of Springer Mountain, just to see what the southern terminus looks like. In my case, since I'm doing a flip-flop thru-hike, Springer will be the end of my journey rather than the beginning.It's been tough work, as you can see from the photo accompanying this entry.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Mon",0
Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647172,"I did a very long day hike today, 19.2 miles total. I hiked the AT, going from Hogpen Gap to Chattahoochee Gap and back. I'm trying to get into shape, so I really pushed it today. I did it non-stop, and finished in just a little over six and a half hours.
I was only carrying a 13-pound pack, including my water, only about half the weight I will be carrying when I thru-hike. And much of that section of trail is relatively flat (compared to the sections around it). But I still felt pretty good about it. I'm at least ready to begin the thru-hike.
Unfortunately, it's back to the flatlands of Nebraska for a while, so I hope I don't lose the conditioning I've got in the last couple of weeks.",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Thu",0
Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647754,"I'm currently fighting through a hamstring injury. I have a month to go until I start and I'm doing my best to get it better by then.I seriously injured my right hamstring running track in college, and I must still have scar tissue in the muscle, because it seems to flare up every now and then. No serious pain or anything--just some soreness and warmth in the muscle.I did a 19-mile day hike a couple of weeks ago, and felt some soreness after. It hasn't stopped me from working out, but I have to treat it a little gingerly and ice it occasionally. I'm not letting this injury keep me from thru-hiking.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Wed",0

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648278,"Hiked the Blood Mountain loop today. I went up from the Byron Reese trailhead, hiked the Appalachian Trail over the top of Blood Mountain, then took the Freeman Trail around the back side of Blood Mountain. I've done this hike three times now, and I enjoy it every time.I ran into a thru-hiker who was huffing his way up Blood Mountain. He said he was carrying a 48-pound pack. That's amazing. I'm on the heavier side in terms of pack weight, and I'm only around 28 pounds with two bottles of water and food. I can't imagine carrying 48 pounds up and down those hills. I'm impressed that he got as far as Blood Mountain. He said he was planning to shed some weight at Neel's Gap, and he recognized that doing so would probably cost him some money. (He said he was willing to spend up to $1000 for lighter equipment.) I hope he makes it.
This is my last time on the AT until I start the thru-hike. I'm headed back to Nebraska soon. I'm getting really excited to start the thru-hike. Less than three weeks away.
The hike was about 6 miles and the hamstring seems to have held up, so it looks like I'm good to go. Unless Duke rethinks its decision not to hire me to replace Coach K, of course.",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Mon",0
Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648534,"I'm back in Nebraska and heavily into the organizational phase of my thru-hike: organizing everything into bags, making sure I'm not missing anything I need to carry, weighing everything and trying to get my pack weight down.It's the last one that I'm really struggling with. I never planned to be an ultralight hiker; I have always planned to be a little on the heavy side as thru-hikers go. Because of my height, my sleeping bag and clothes are going to weigh a little more than many people's anyway. And I have to take a slightly heavier pack because none of the ultralight packs worked with my back issue. But I'm even heavier than I want to be, so I'm going down the list and carefully balancing the utility of each item (and the likelihood that I will need it) against its weight. It's a tough exercise and I still have some thinking to do. My guess is I will be adding and subtracting right up to the house I start.Right now, everything is spread across the entire floor of one of the rooms in our house, carefully separated by which stuff sack it's going into. It's a mess, but an organized mess.",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Sat",0
Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648827,"Ten days! In ten days, I will be hiking on the Appalachian Trail. I'm really excited, but it's excitement tempered by the recognition of how hard it's going to be. It's not easy for a 66-year-old to walk up and down mountains for over 2,000 miles with 30 pounds on his back. I'm a little nervous, but doing all the things that need to be done before I leave has kept me from getting too nervous.I'm learning how to do things I didn't know how to do. Two days ago, I replaced the shock cord inside my tent poles. I had never done that before and had to look up how to do it. Today, I have to hand-wash my down sleeping bag. Haven't done that before either. This weekend, I'll try to learn how to make the weight of everything I'm carrying miraculously decrease by 20%. I'm sure it's a simple problem of transdimensional physics.",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Thu",0

While I go away and play for six months, she's going to keep up our house, pay our bills (with the money she will continue to make working while I'm already enjoying the retired life), and keep track of all my mail and email. And the only benefit she gets in return is not having to put up with me for six months. (Now that I think about it, she may be coming out ahead on that deal.)
Sandy and I have been married for almost ten years, and I don't show my appreciation anywhere near as often as I should. I can be a pain in the ass sometimes (ask my children), but she never lets it get to her and she's always there when I need her. My life is immeasurably enriched by her presence. Don't tell her, because it would be totally out of character for me, but I'm really going to miss her while I'm hiking.

I'm feeling an incredible mix of emotions: eager anticipation; nervousness; resolve; and sadness about what I'm leaving behind for six months. But, above all, I'm excited to get going. The last couple of weeks I have felt like a horse in a harness, and I'm ready to run free and wild.All my backpacking stuff sits in plastic bags on the floor, ready to be packed up for the plane trip. I'm going to do one final check to make sure everything is there that's supposed to be there, but otherwise I'm ready.Today, I pig out on Easter dinner, knowing that I'm going to drop most of those pounds in the first couple of weeks of hiking.

Everything I need, except for some fuel and food I'm going to buy in Virginia, is now ready. Amazingly, it takes two big suitcases to hold everything when it's packed loosely instead of crammed into stuff sacks. But I know it all fits in my pack because I've carried all this stuff before.

I put it on earlier, when everything was inside it and remarked that it felt light. I was feeling good about myself until I realized the water bottles weren't on it yet. A liter of water weighs over 2 pounds. So much for light!
I'm excited to begin, but my feelings are a little bittersweet as I realize I won't be seeing Sandy, my wonderful wife, for three months. And I know she's going to cry when she drops me off, which will make it even harder. But she'll get a lot of insurance money when the bears eat me, so her feelings are probably mixed as well.

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649526,"Started my thru-hike today from Front Royal, VA. The first 4 hours went really well, but then it got hot and I hit a wall for a couple of hours before I recovered. I was dehydrated and my legs were cramping. I decided to stop around 3:30 and stay in a shelter, even though I wasn't planning on staying in shelters much. Just didn't want to do another 1.5 mi. to the next campsite.Saw my first AT deer today, just 20 feet down the trail from me. He just stared at me and ran away at the last minute.","Front Royal, VA

I wasn't going to hike so far, but I saw that this hostel offered pizza, pop, and hot showers, so I toughened it out. It almost killed me, but it was worth it.
Walked through an area with brambles on both sides and saw five huge hares. Also ran into a black rat snake stretched across the trail who didn't want to leave. Threw a rock and stick at him and he wouldn't budge. Then I remembered snakes can feel vibrations, so I banged my hiking pole on a rock and he finally left.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Instead, I went even longer than yesterday.My plan was to hike 10 miles to a shelter, but I got to the shelter at 1:00, way too early. And a guy at the shelter said a group of 35 Marines planned to tent there tonight. That made up my mind. I decided to go kn to Harper's Ferry.I had a surprisingly good day given the length of the hike. My legs felt better today than either other day. I had no pain at all in my Achilles tendon, which has been bugging me for a couple of weeks.Did experience my first rain today, enough to dig out the rain jacket and pack cover.

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649731,"Another long day. I was going to take it easy today, but the trail was ""relatively"" easy, so I kept going. One day, I really am going to do an easy day. I even did an extra 0.4 miles that doesn't show up in my trail miles to get a nice shot of the Potomac. (See today's journal.
Entered my third state today. I am now in the state of Maryland. West Virginia didn't last very long. Pennsylvania comes next.
Met Fulghamgray, a flip-flop hiker from England who messaged me here on the trail journal. We walked the last 4 miles together.
Staying tonight at a nice campground that even has a hot shower. Yay! Showered last night, but you can never have too many showers. The only problem is I have to put the same stinky clothes back on tomorrow.
Also found a pizza place that will deliver a pizza on the highway about a half-mile away, so the three of us here are sharing pizza.
I went to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy this morning to get my thru-hiker picture taken and get my thru-hiker hangtag for my pack. Then I went to the post office and sent about a pound of gear home. A lighter pack is a nicer pack.
On the medical front, I'm suffering from a bit of diaper rash. That's what happens when you're hiking cheek to cheek.
It's turning cold. Think I'm going to need that down bag and cold weather gear tonight.","Harper's Ferry

The strap on one of my hiking poles broke today. Brand new poles; I've only used them five days. And this is the second time it's happened to me with this pole style. Serious design flaw.
Passed the ORIGINAL Washington Monument today. See the picture. That's fulhamgray in front.
Went through the first major stand of evergreens today. It was much darker. The deciduous trees have just started to sprout leaves, so it's been pretty light.
To my wife: I promise I really will take an easy day at some point.","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

Last night was cold--below freezing--and one of the people in the shelter I was sleeping in snored loudly all night. Not the best night of my hike, for sure.
But today was a beautiful day, and it's supposed to be a little warmer tonight. Today's hike was a little shorter than the last two days. The location of the shelters just worked out that way.
Met several new thru-hikers at the shelter tonight, along with the crew of three I've been around for the past two days. The four of us are planning to resupply and spend the night in Fayetteville, PA tomorrow. I'm finding that I'm much more social on the trail than I am in real life.

Today was my longest day yet. My Achilles tendon was acting up a little this morning, but it's a little better now. I think it flared up last night when I walked from Bonanza to Walmart. I'm hoping it doesn't get any worse.
The Bonanza trip was amazing. Bonanza had a buffet and the 6 thru-hikers there were taking full advantage of it. We had used plates stacked up on the table.
Today was rainy, the first day I've had to break out my full rain gear, including the pants. Because of that, decided to stay at a hostel again. Sounds wimpy, I know, but give me a break, I'm just starting.
Passed the halfway point twice today: a big sign for the original halfway point and a small sign for this year's halfway point with current reroutes. Wish it were my halfway, instead of the trail's.
Went through a dark pine forest today, the first thing like that we've come across. It was really nice.","Fayetteville, PA

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650120,"We've been doing what's known on the trail as hostel-hopping. Tonight is our third straight hostel. The advantage is we don't have to set up or break down camp, so we can do more miles. Still, it's time for it to come to an end: camping on the trail tomorrow.
Most of the trail today was relatively flat, but there was a crazy middle section I labeled the maze of boulders. The trail took a circuitous path winding aimlessly over the tops of and between a mess of giant boulders, when it could have easily gone around them. Some trail developer had an evil sense of humor.
Today started with lovely cool weather and fog, then opened into a beautiful sunny day. The town of Boiling Springs, PA is beautiful. It has a nice grassy park beside the river with ducks and geese. I sat there for a while waiting and it was so refreshing.
I had a neat experience with butterflies today. I passed a section of trail with a lot of small butterflies flitting around. Twice a couple of them flew just in front of me for about 30 yards, as if they were leading me down the trail. It was inspiring.
Our little hiking group has dwindled down to two. Rootseeker and Soundboard have dropped behind us a little. Hope to see them again later up the trail. My British friend Gray has earned a trail name. He's now Ernie, given that name because his hair sticks up like Ernie's from Sesame Street (and because he's a likeable guy like the other Ernie).
Last night, I had my first negative experience with a thru-hiker. Most of the people I've met have been pleasant and interesting, but this guy was completely negative. He had a nasty comment about anything anyone said, and he disparaged at least three distinct social/ethnic groups in the ten minutes I was in the room with him. I decided the best thing to do was to avoid him for the rest of the night.","Ironmasters Mansion Hostel

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650184,"Started off the day with a big breakfast in Boiling Springs. I was disappointed that I couldn't finish the huge hiker's breakfast. Guess I'm not that starved yet.
Today's hike was fairly level, until the last mile-a steep rise to the shelter, just to get me sweaty before I stopped.
Passed a patch of fragrant flowering bushes in the morning. Smelled like honeysuckle, but I think it wasn't. Nice way to start the day. In the afternoon, part of the trail was a serene walk along a slow river. The birds were chirping and it was very peaceful.
Not everything was quite so wonderful. I crossed over both Interstate 76 and Interstate 81 today. Even that wasn't totally bad; a couple of cars honked at me as I was on the pedestrian overpasses.
The other bad news: the first mosquitoes have started to appear. Guess it's time to pull out the Deet.
Ernie (the Brit) went on a little past the shelter today. First time in a few days we haven't stayed at the same place. But a couple of other people I've met before are here at the shelter: Tiny Dragon and Early Bird. Tiny Dragon was at the same hostel with me last night and Early Bird was with me a couple of nights ago. Rootseeker is a little behind but he says his ankle is improving.
The Achilles was a little off and on today, but it feels fine right now. All in all, things are good.","Boiling Springs, PA

Started with a long, grueling climb this morning and ended with a long, steep descent on rock steps into Duncannon this afternoon. My knees aren't happy with me, but they haven't gone on strike yet.
Highlights of today's hike: birds singing while I hiked through the mist this morning and a beautiful view above Duncannon. (It looks much better from above than it does when you're actually in town.)
I'm staying in the famous Doyle Hotel tonight. It was originally built by Anheuser Busch in the early 1900s, but fell into disrepair and became a cheap thru-hiker stop. They're renovating, but it's still very much a work in progress.
I caught up with Ernie today. He's also staying in the hotel and we're going out to eat tonight.
Right now, I'm sitting in nothing but my rain pants and rain jacket (and literally nothing else) washing everything else. Rain gear by itself is not a comfortable clothes choice, but I'll leave the details to your imagination.","Darlington Shelter

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650348,"Today was my first 20-mile day. I've had a couple that came close, but this was the first one to go over 20.
The day began with a long, boring, 25-minute walk through the streets of Duncannon.
Today was the beginning of the Pennsylvania Rocks, a 200-mile stretch noted for its ability to tear up people's feet. I'm sure it gets worse, but the rocks today were fun. It reminds me of the boulder hopping we sometimes did as kids when we visited relatives on Lake Huron in Canada.
I spent much of the morning hiking far above highways. Unfortunately, much of the traffic noise managed to filter its way up to me.
I had lunch at Table Rock, a beautiful viewpoint.
I spent a lot of the afternoon walking a ridge between two valleys. To my left was a broad, shallow valley filled with farm fields. To my right was a deep, wooded valley that looked uninhabited. The contrast was amazing. I'm sure my friend Anthony the Ag Law professor would tell me that the difference is because of the different shapes of the valleys.
I saw my first thru-hiker blue-blazing today. For those of you unfamiliar with AT lingo, blue-blazing is taking an easier or faster trail instead of following the white blazes of the AT. To each his own, but I don't plan to do it.
Tonight, I'm camping alone on top of a ridge. I decided I would rather do the 1000-foot climb this afternoon than in the morning. I also wanted to get away from the mosquitoes, which are starting to swarm in some places.
Ernie and Early Bird didn't agree. They chose to stop at the bottom because there was a beautiful river to camp by.
It was a rough climb, but I am SO happy I don't have to do it in the morning.","Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA

Ernie's in the shelter with me and, after two long days, we've decided to take a very short day tomorrow and go into town for supplies. The rain is supposed to end Sunday morning, so we could possibly stay dry for a while.
There was a porcupine around the campsite last night. He didn't do any damage, but his chattering (whatever you call the weird sound porcupines make) kept me from sleeping soundly.","Tentsite at 1170.9

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650489,"A very short day today. Ernie and I got a shuttle into town so we could dry things and take a break. We wanted to wait one more day, but the only hotel in that town was fully booked.
It's still raining, but it's supposed to end tomorrow and they're predicting several dry days. I can't believe how much it's rained over the past two days. Even the local at the hotel reception desk said this weather was unusual.
It was hard to put on my cold, wet clothes this morning. I had a dry top, but had to wear same wet pants. I think my rain gear is working, but I bent over yesterday to tie my shoes not realizing my rain jacket had hitched up. I got a cold wet stream down my butt that soaked my pants. My very first experience of butt rain.
We're trying to dry out everything in the hotel room today. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't have a laundry. (See the picture.)
We had to wait to check in to the motel, so we tanked up on breakfast at the McDonalds next door. I can't believe how much I'm eating when I'm in town. Here's today's breakfast as an example: Egg McMuffin, 2 sausage burritos, sausage and egg mcGriddle, hash browns, and two large orange juices. And I don't even feel stuffed, just comfortably full.

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650596,"Today may have been the end of my thru-hike. About 100 yards in, I misstepped and felt a pop in my left Achilles tendon and a huge flare of pain. As I've said in earlier entries, I've had some Achilles pain before, but this was qualitatively different.
I kept hiking, because there was nothing else to do, but I was limping and in pain all day. I couldn't push off on my left foot at all. I tried to do a heel raise on that leg, and I couldn't lift it off the ground at all. And my arms got really sore today because I was trying to use my hiking poles like crutches to take some of the weight off my leg.
I did some physical therapy tonight, in addition to stretching all day, but I'm not optimistic. My son-in-law Matt's dad, Mike, lives nearby and he has kindly offered to take me to the airport so I can go home. I still have 8 miles to hike to get out tomorrow. If it feels better tomorrow, I could change my mind, but I think that's unlikely.
The injury sucks even more because there was no rain today and the weather is supposed to be good for several days. It was a little chilly, but I can deal with chilly.
Finally, today was Mother's Day, my first Mother's Day since Mom died. The Achilles pain was nothing compared to the pain I felt because of that. I had a long inner conversation with Mom this morning. That was special. God, I miss her. She was such a huge influence on me.","Pine Grove, PA

Gazelle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650644,"I took the tent down for the final time today. It may sound silly, but I was crying. I was so excited about my thru-hike. I invested a lot in it emotionally, and now it's gone. I was super slow packing up this morning. I just didn't want to go.
I said my goodbyes to Graham/Ernie last night because he was leaving very early this morning. I shook his hand and wished him well. I've only known him for two weeks but it felt like losing an old friend.
The hike out sucked. I had to keep my left foot at a 90 degree angle because it hurt to move it or put any pressure on it. Several times, I misstepped and the pain was intense. Each time, I just waited for the pain to subside and pushed on. It's not like there was any other option. I took a bad step up a rocky ascent and experienced the most intense pain of my life. On the 1-10 doctor's scale, this was a 10. I had to lean against a tree and wait a few minutes before continuing. Because of episodes like that, I'm sure I made the right decision to quit. As much as I wanted to go on, it simply wasn't possible.
My thanks to Mike Kochanasz, my son-in-law's dad, for picking me up and taking me to the airport hotel. Mike lives in Allentown and drove 45 miles each way to help me out. He wouldn't even take money for gas. Thanks a ton, Mike.","Eagle's Nest Shelter

I hiked in rain, heat, freezing cold and wind, sunshine, clouds, and beautiful weather. I got to stay in shelters, hostels, hotels, and, of course, my little one-person tent. I even got to stay in the (in)famous Doyle Hotel in Duncannon. I visited several small towns I otherwise never would have seen and learned how to get around and resupply in those towns. I saw some beautiful views and got some great pictures. I learned new things about myself, both strengths and weaknesses. I was even learning to go with the flow, a real accomplishment for an anal-retentive planner like me.
And the people! The wonderful people I met on the trail: those I hiked with; those I met only briefly at campsites, shelters, or hostels; those I had brief conversations with as we passed along the trail. I'm not a social person, but I had great experiences with so many great people. And I will never forget the core group I came to consider friends. Harry/Early Bird, who always lived up to his trail name by beating me out of camp. Rootseeker.  Mary/""Beer Girl"", who dropped behind me on the trail, but quickly reached out with kind words when she read of my injury. Mary, I apologize for spreading the beer girl story so broadly that everyone on the AT now knows beer girl. Last, but most certainly not least, Graham/Ernie. My dear friend Gray. His wife joked that I deserved a medal for putting up with him for 10 days, but the reality is far from that. We provided each other mutual support and assistance at the beginning of a difficult undertaking, when we both needed it. We confided in each other and gave each other a sounding board to bitch about injuries, trail conditions, moronic people, or whatever. I would not have gone as far as I did as quickly as I did without Gray being there. Although we only knew each other for about two weeks, I consider him a good friend. I wish I could have continued along the trail with him.
Whether or not I specificallynamed you, thanks to the many wonderful people who made my brief hike so much fun.
So, upon reflection, I have to admit it was a fun experience, in spite of the unhappy conclusion. But I still feel a deep sense of disappointment. I was just starting to get into the flow and becoming very comfortable with the routine of thru-hiking. Even that endless Pennsylvania rain helped me learn how to deal with incessant bad weather. As I got the routine down, I was really increasingly able to enjoy the camaraderie, joy, and fun of the trip. Just as things were getting really good, my trip was cut short, not because I wasn't enjoying it or because couldn't handle it mentally, but because my body broke down from a preexisting injury.
I'm frustrated because I have wanted to do this for a long time and was really enjoying it. But I'm also frustrated because I'm getting older and only have a limited amount of time left to do this sort of thing. I can't as easily do some of things I could do in my youth. It's doubly frustrating because my body was holding up very well and the injury was an aggravation of something that occurred 20-25 years ago.
Now is a time for healing and reflection. I need to decide what my next adventure will be. Will I try to thru-hike again next year? Will I do some section-hiking? Will I do backpacking trips elsewhere, or try some entirely different adventure unrelated tobackpacking? Time will tell. In the meantime, my only goal is to do whatever it takes to get my leg healed.
Thanks to everyone who has followed my journal, especially those of you who have left messages in my Guest Book. I appreciate your support and hope your own hiking adventures prove enjoyable.
Goodbye. Peace and love to everyone.",,View Entry,"May 11, Wed",0
