Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646917,"Here I am in February, 5 months out and revamping/ replacing old gear and making sure everything will find a place in my backpack! Core exercises to strengthen my lower back have helped remarkably to reduce lower back pain. Also doing plenty of 8-10 mile walkabouts that include stairs or elevation to strengthen my quads.Getting real excited and have lined up one of the original trio from the 2019 hike to join me. Still working on the third person to join us if I can pull him away from his back home activities for a few weeksWith just 500 miles to the finish at Mt Katahdin",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Thu",0
Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647066,"Covid has far reaching effects in supply chain for hikers too. From hiking shoe sizes to rain jackets the products just aren’t available. Luckily most of my gear is already in my possession. I. Have till June 2 so wait lists help and hopefully, become notified when available. Hopefully sooner than later so I can break them in. I plan to buy at least 2 pair of shoes as I learned from previous experience, that you just can’t walk into a town near the trail and find your brand of shoes, size, width and other  features. I will have the second pair shipped to a post office when needed.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Thu",0
Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649062,"luckily, I have several retired neighbors that love to train along with me. I am 20 lbs lighter at this point averaging about 8 miles per trip. Also, living here is quite flat, so I do reps up and down the 35 degree angled bayou retaining walls for my quads and hams. A little over 1 month to go and feeling more confident each day!",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Mon",0
Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649773,"I am committed to starting my “great walkabout” June 1. As it turns out, unfortunately, neither previous hiker friends from the 2019 hike will be joining me. Although this sounds kinda negative, I had begun my first two previous hikes alone. What happens is the trail “provides.” Eventually you usually meet up with other fellow hikers that hike the same speed, destinations, etc and form what they call “Tramilies” I have met some of the most interesting and friendly folks out there and have hiked off and on with these mini groups. No worries.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Thu",0
