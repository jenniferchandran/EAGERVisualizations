Luvbug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646211,"Today I made it official. I registered my hike with the A.T. Conservancy. Starting northbound at Rockfish Gap 4/16/22.I posted my plan on social media and was overwhelmed by the love and support that my friends and family are showing me. They offered up a room to stay in while passing through their area. Also, offers to help along the way with food and gear. All I can say is WOW! I love you all so much and I'm glad you're on this journey with me.Since the holidays are over, I decided to take myself on a shopping spree to REI today. Well, I bet you know how that turned out. I freaking love that place. I bought my tent and a sleeping pad that I'm taking with me on this epic adventure. I did start a gear list on here. It's not complete at the moment but you can check out what's on there if you'd like.",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Sun",0
Luvbug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646268,"Big Agnus showed up today. I switched things out a bit. I went from planning a thru-hike with a hammock to a traditional tent for my sleeping arrangement. In getting some opinions from those who attempted a thru-hike, I decided to go with a tent. One, because of the fiddle factor of setting up a hammock. It takes a little more time. Two, I worry about setting up in inclement weather. I want to be able to pop that sucker up in as little time as possible. 
To help with having to sleep on the ground I bought the Nemo Tensor insulated sleeping pad to go under my sleeping bag. I'll go out and practice setting up in a couple days to see what the whole process will be like and report back. My gear is coming together right on time. I just need to purchase my rain pants and gloves and do some last minute food preperation and I should be set. I'm sure I'll continue to research and tweek everthing up until the last minute. Then, I guess I'll hit the trail weather I'm ready or not and just hone in on stuff while on this adventure. 
EEEK! So excited. My time to hit the trail isn't to far off.

Luvbug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646404,"People ask, why are you hiking the A.T? This was a hard question for me to really pinpoint why I'm doing it. There are several reasons and there is no simple reason. I had to mill this around in my head for a while before I could give an answer.
I've been hiking on and off throughout my life. Hiked at Dolly Sods wilderness area in the Monongahela National Forest, section hiked a portion of the A.T. in Virginia and West Virginia. Also, I have day hiked in WV, AZ, and OR and about a year and half ago I planned and executed my first ever solo hike. My solo hike was from Davenport Gap TN to Hot Springs NC approximately 35 miles over a 3 day period. This trip was very much an eye and heart opening experience for me. I laughed, cursed and cried for various reasons while also doing a lot of self reflection and discovery. It was truly an amazing adventure and I had proven to myself that I was very much capable of doing it on my own. This was Labor Day weekend 2020.
I'd like to also mention that there had been a series of events in my life over the previous two years that had led me to a decision to chase down a dream that I had had my entire adult life. That dream was to become a traveling CST/CSFA(Certified Surgical Technologist/First Assistant). I left Florida at the end of January 2021 with all my favorite things packed into my tiny 370Z. The bulk of the items I took with me were mostly toys, but those toys were important for the adventure I was embarking on. While I was working, I also wanted adventure in my life as well. I packed SCUBA, camping and all my hiking gear with a bicycle on top and jetted across the US to run down my dream (reminds me of the Tom Petty song) and start a new life. 
I had said many times throughout my life that I wanted to hike the entire A.T. but knew it would have to wait until retirement. Since the solo hike, all I kept saying to myself and those close to me was, I think I want to hike the entire trail. I must have repeated this on a weekly, if not daily basis. I think I spoke it into existence actually. 
I realized after starting my travel career that this new life had also given me my opportunity. It had given me the flexibility to say when and where I was going to work. So, here I am. I strategically placed myself on an assignment close to the A.T. When this contract ends in April, I won't have far to travel to jump on the A.T. I'll begin my epic journey to be out in nature, meeting new people and discovering the person that I truly am. 
Please join me on this adventure. We can laugh, cry and curse together :)",,View Entry,"Jan 19, Wed",0
Luvbug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646728,"This has been a hell of a week. Diagnosed Covid + on Tuesday. My symptoms started mild with a tickle in my throat to severe flu like symptoms on Wednesday. I felt like someone hit me over the back with a chair. The pain in my neck and back was excruciating, making it difficult to roll over in bed. Today, I woke up with more energy and ready to get on with my life but you know....isolation blah, blah, blah. I'm kind of glad I'm getting this out of the way before I head out on the trail in April. It would've sucked if this happened on trail
So with all this pinned up energy and nowhere to go I decided to play around with my gear. I set up Big Anes in my living room. She's pretty simple to set up but I need to be quicker so I've decided I'll do this a couple times a week until I can get outside in the dirt. I weighed some more gear and put it into my gear list. I realized while playing with my gear that my water filter isn't working. Better to find out now than out in the field. I know what my next purchase will be. Also,  I experimented with homemade packpacker meals. Minute rice, dehydrated peas, corn, tomatoes, spices and chicken. It was a little bland. I need to give it some pep, otherwise I'm gonna get bored with these meals. Anyway, it's been fun tweeking stuff.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Fri",0
Luvbug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647341,"So, on 3-4-22 I had a lot going on and lots to do, an agenda for the day and weekend. Therapy for mental hygiene, a run to Walmart, shake down hike in the woods and a drive to WV to spend time with my daughters. The Universe had other ideas. I decided to roll my ankle going out of my Airbnb this morning. When I did it I was certain I broke my ankle. I had excruciating pain, imediate swelling, I managed to pick myself up from the sidewalk and ran back inside the house and fell onto the floor crying repeating over and over ""OMG"" ""OMG"" OMG"" thinking mostly about my up coming hike in 6 weeks. Why is this happening? My daughter graciously came to my rescue from 2 hours away and proceeded to take me to an orthopedic office in Winchester Va. An office I had worked in 5 years ago. Fortunately, the x-rays showed no fracture but a very bad sprain. No work, in a boot, crutches, and no weight bearing, toe touch after swelling goes down. Well fuck! I'm the worst patient ever and work in health care. What do you expect? Also, I'm pretty much my only means of support accept for my daughter. I'm doing my best but taking the boot off to drive when I need too. Also, Icing, elevating, all the stuff. I need to get better before April 16 the day I'm supposed to start my thru-hike. I go back for new x-rays on the 14th. I may have to go back to the drawing board and modify things a bit. Stay tuned for updates on my progress.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Fri",0
Luvbug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648914,Tomorrow was supposed to be the day. The day I started my thru-hike. 6 weeks ago I had a bad ankle injury. I was hoping for a miraculous recovery. I had no choice but to postpone this adventure. I will planning a LASH towards the end on the summer in hopes of having a strong healthy ankle by that time. I'll go back to the drawing board for a longer hike in 2023. Peace Love and Hiking,,View Entry,"Apr 15, Fri",0
