We hate the 6.5 miles to the Ed Garvey shelter, and we surprised to find a packed camp. It is spring break for the local schools, and many people are taking advantage of the weekend to get outside. The Good Friday sermon talked about fining a word that you want to live your life about.  I gave that a lot of thought, and have come up with three words that are important to me: Kindness, Contentment, and Encouragement. The third of these words is something that I really need to work on in my personal life and hope that the trail will allow me to reflect on these three words and make the changes that I need to be able to display them in my life.","Harpers Ferry, West Virginia

We were able to get rides both ways, the trip back to town was with Linda Ott, who had given Mike a ride from the same location last October.  Our third first, was that it began snowing at 11 AM and continued all the way until mid afternoon the next day. We ended up with over 4 1/2 inches of snow and hiking got very interesting. The forecast was that the snow it was only going to be for a couple hours and then we change to rain but since the temperature stayed in the high 20s we continue to get snow. We decided to continue hiking, and ended up at Deer  Lick shelter. A resupply was at a Walmart, where we also were able to enjoy a Subway for lunch. The Walmart had Sawyer filters so I was able to replace my filter which did not work earlier in the week. Mike decided to modify the common trail saying of “You Do not get to Maine if You do not Walk in the Rain” to “If You Won’t Walk in Snow You Better Not Go”.

We also decided to change our original schedule since we had planned on tent camping and want to be in a shelter with the cold. Even with walk in the extra miles we made it two toms run shelter before 2 PM. It’s a very small cabin, only holds about four people, and there’s no cell service at this location. There is a real nice water stream close to the shelter, and with the sun this afternoon things appear to be much warmer. It’s amazing how much some sunshine changes the perception of the outdoor temperature. We cross the official halfway mark of the trail today, even though that’s not the halfway mark for us obviously.

I am missing BSF tonight which seems abnormal after so long spending my Monday nights doing BSF.

Since we are close to town we were able to order takeout and had chicken sandwiches delivered to the shelter.  We’re disappointed that the shower was shut down by the local health department until they figure out how to coordinate it.

The temperatures have been in the mid 70’s but because of the rain the days have been humid.  We scheduled our first zero day of the trip for this coming Wednesday when we get to Salisbury CT.  We figure it is time after completing 432 miles the first 30 days and getting two days ahead of schedule on the first third of the trip.   We also did need to re-supply, so we walked into Kent for lunch and a stop at the IGA store. Used were good today and there were lots of people when we got to the shelter, basically because the weather’s been bad. Bubbles and Onion made it just before rain started but with the shelter full they needed to set up a tent.

At the shelter we met several new people. Two through hikers, (Maui and Red Dawn) and a large group of Yale college students who were out training to do freshman orientation. We had a really good discussion with the Yale students about goals in life and where they stood in their spiritual life. Both Maui and Hardway opened up the discussion with the students.

Our total mileage is now at 478 miles and it was time to take a zero day to rest and sleep in a real bed again.  Things are going well overall and I enjoy the conversations we have had the last week with fellow hikers Onion, Bubbles, Red Dawn, Maui, Monk, and a group of Yale college students out for four days of leadership training.  This is the second time that I have stayed at Maria’s house, when we hiked with Larry Ward in 2019 he had this is one of his stops.

It is always interesting when you decide to take your driving privileges away from your parents!

Fortunately for me another section hiker showed up about 30 minutes later. She was doing day one of a one week hike and the idea of having someone at camp and a fire, was enough for her to stay the night. During the day I took a short side trail to go see Long Creek Falls. This was another place along the trail that was very popular for day hikers and the Falls and tree colors were both very beautiful.The only downside of the day came as a cold front is moving through and temperatures are expected to be below freezing tonight. It’s a good thing it’s my last night on trail because a week of those temperatures would be very disheartening.","Gooch Mtn. Shelter

Fulltilt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658932,"Left camp early in order to meet JD Cleminshaw for a 12 o’clock pick up. I was surprised to find my water bottle frozen on the top inch. It’s probably a good thing I’m getting off the mountain today. The trail ends at Springer Mountain, but the parking lot to get out of the area is at Amicalola state park. I had a 7.3 mile walk to get to that location, and I wanted time to be able to enjoy the waterfalls in the state park. Mary also advised me it would be good to change into clean clothes before traveling back to Chicago. The timing worked out well, and JD met me at noon. I appreciate his willingness to drop me off at the Marta station, which smoothly brought me to the Atlanta airport. When checking in I was asked if I wanted to take the 3:20 PM flight instead of the 730 flight. Of course I said yes, but by the time I checked in I had less than 20 minutes to board, Including getting through security and to terminal C. I did my best O.J. Simpson impersonation, running through the airport, and was the last one to get on the plane. With the earlier flight I actually arrived home about the same time that I was supposed to be boarding my original flight. Now all I have to do is figure out what’s next since I’ve been hiking the trail for the last 151 days. The trip has been a dream, both physical and mentally challenging, but also many good memories have been created.","Black Gap Shelter
