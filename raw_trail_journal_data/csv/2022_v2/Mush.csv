Mush,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652189,"I missed a few weeks of posts and will update those periodically while trying to post more consistently from here on out. I've been hiking a set schedule for the past few weeks, forcing my self into a slower pace to make sure Hoid had fully recovered from a minor infection that forced us off the trail for three rest days. I am going to hike with a bit less of plan going forward, generally aiming for 140 miles over the next seven days (today included). Connecticut is beautiful and filled with a variety of small climbs and short ridge walks. The forest seems a bit older than the lower mid Atlantic. Today's hike started around 11:30 and went to nine, hiking slowly with fully loaded packs (and a two mile walk out of town to the trail head). Summer has fully arrived with the greenery in full force, along with the bugs. The combination lead to some overgrown paths and me pulling about two dozen ticks off of the dog last night.","Kent, CT
