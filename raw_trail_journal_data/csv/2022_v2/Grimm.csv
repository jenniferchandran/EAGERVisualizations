Grimm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651269,"My plan this year is to finish the southern half of the trail.  In 2020, I hiked from Harper's Ferry to Mt Garfield where my knees gave out.  I fell several times, with the decision maker being a close call of falling 10-15ft.  If it hadn't been for the small tree I was able to grab on the way down, it could have been a disaster.  I got off the trail and headed home for a couple weeks of rest and recovery.  I returned to Harper's Ferry and headed south.  I got as far as Spy Rock when I got the call no one ever wants.  My Mom was very sick and it didn't look like she was going to make it.  I got a ride back to a Hostel by a wonderful family who overheard my problem. Rented a car and drove home.  My Mom passed several days later, with her children at her bedside.  2021 my left knee gave out and I had a replacement.  2022 my original plan was to leave Apr 15 from Springer and head north.  My left knee then gave me problems so I got a cortisone shot.  First week in May became my second opportunity but had a bad sinus infection, so now I'm targeting June 6 or 7th to start again.

Grimm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652957,"Legs were really feeling it today! Knees did just fine with only minor pain once in a while. Thighs really felt weak.  I really lived up to my trail name today, talked to too many day hikers.  They started the conversation when they saw my pack.  Lots of very different types of people today. What I found most gratifying was the group of about 10 with downs syndrome. They were really enjoying themselves and everyone of them said hi to me as I was resting on a tree stump. They had made a difficult hike to see the falls. Helped a very fit, silver haired lady who was in her 70's. She had made a wrong turn (and who hasn't done the same) leaving the falls and as a result missed her shuttle.  She was so relieved when I showed her my hiking app and that she was only 1.3 miles from the parking area. Hope she made it home okay!
All in all it was a good day!  Don't think I'll see too many hikers except day hikers on weekends.  I got started kinda late this year.  Looking forward to making it all the way to Harper's Ferry early September!

Grimm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652958,"This morning was exhausting! I was wet head to toe due to the humidity. By 11am I was sitting against a stump not feeling very good. Put some electrolytes in my water which helped.  Everyone hiking is either from Florida, Alabama, or Georgia. They come to northern Georgia to cool off. lol I had a fairly aggressive hike planned but I'm changing my game plan till I acclimate to the high temps and humidity.
Sometimes you just have to deal with what you are given.  I'm not about to endanger myself for more miles. I'm just enjoying being in the woods. Mileage will come in due time.

Grimm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652960,"Heat and humidity is taking its toll. Getting plenty of water and electrolytes but it's a struggle. Even the southerners are having difficulties.  There is no wind so everyone is soaked with no evaporation.  Sweat just follows gravity and drops off the shorts and down the leg. Hanging clothes out to dry at night does little, they are still wet in the morning. I'll give it a few more days to acclimate to this heat. May get off and return to the trail in Harper's Ferry in August and head south. This would put me down here with the changing seasons.

Cut my mileage to compensate for the heat. Top of Blood Mtn nearly caused hypothermia. Not from being cold as it was 80deg at the top, but from raised body temp going up the mountain. There was a 20mph wind that caused the three of us hikers to start shaking. It had been so humid our sweat was dripping down our legs.Met several people in the morning as I headed out. One couple with two dogs who had made it only 24 miles in 14 days. The other was a family with a 10ish year old child. Father is from China and speaks very little English from what we have gathered. His Wife is from the states and met him while she was in the peace Corp. She is an English professor at a major Florida university ( can't say which one as she is in negotiations with another university).

Trail runner stopped and asked how things were going, told him about the asthma. He said, have just the thing for you. He'd had a lung infection a few weeks ago and his Dr told him to get high dose Sudafed (the version behind the pharmacy counter) to help open the bronchial tubes. I had my doubts but it worked! Still having a bit of an issue but so much better! Side effect was my nose ran all day, lol.Joe got a trail name today, Ursa. Yesterday he coughed and from 25 yds away it sounded like a bear! So much so that I scourd the woods looking for one and struck my trekking poles together to scare the bear.

It was so cold it was not rattling when I darn near stepped on it.  Used my trekking pole to wake it up. It was not happy!  Tried my best to encourage it off the trail without success so I walked thru the grass around it.  Couple of hikers I've been with for the past few days came up on it later.  They tried everything to get it to move.  Bear spray seemed to do the trick.  They told me it was 6 ft long as it slithered away.Great day on the trail!

One mile along the trail to the NOC for breakfast and resupply to Fontana Dam, and then nearly 2000 ft of climb for the day. Ursa was having a really bad day. He struggled up the steep slopes.  Not sure if it was the long day yesterday or the big breakfast. We all have bad days! We had planned the short day as NOC is a really cool place. They have white water rafting, kayaking, zip line, restaurants, lodge, ......  Didn't have the time to do any of them but would be a good place to return to.
Reserved a room for myself at the Fontana Lodge for Monday. My bounce box was suppose to be delivered yesterday so I'm a bit nervous it won't make it. It has my meds, maps, and misc items.  Biggest thing is my meds.  I only carry enough to get me to the next bounce box pickup point.

Ursa set out early to make 21 miles today! Since he is not at Cable Gap Shelter, I have to assume he made it all the way to the Fontana Hilton (very nice shelter built by the Fontana Dam owners). I made 15.4 today with a real struggle this morning. The steep climbs made my legs feel like jello, averaging 1.4 mph. This afternoon I did 2.0 mph which I felt good about. Especially since I tweaked my right ankle. Managed to work thru it but will know the damage in the morning.  Also twisted the fake knee pretty good. That one scared me a bit. 
Headed into Fontana Lodge in the morning for a zero day before heading into the Smokies.
It's raining as I write this. Nothing better than a gentle rain in the great outdoors.

There were four officers waiting to talk to me. All four had a hand on their gun. Turns out there is a dangerous fugitive on the loose. They showed me a picture, warned me not to approach him, and asked that I get the gps coordinates from my phone and call 911 as soon as I get service.
Guess I'd better figure out how to pull coordinates from my phone.

Tough day today. Started with a 1250' climb, fairly flat for several miles which included angled boulder jumping for a mile at the top of the ridgeline, 1850' decent, 1600' climb to Audie Murphy Memorial, slow 1600' decent, and finally a 500' climb to the shelter over 19.3 miles.
Highlight of the day was the Audie Murphy Memorial. It was very moving all the items people left at the site. The memorial is placed near the plane crash that took his life.
Sleeping in the shelter again, even though I swore to myself I'd never do again. It's raining and I just didn't want to set up the hammock. I know this one has mice as I watched them with my headlamp checking under the picnic table for scraps, then ran under the shelter.

It's supposed to be a great spot for viewing but the fog ruined any chance. The climb down from Dragons Tooth was a real challenge. Lots of vertical wall climbing involved. It was a real challenge but lots of fun! I was the old man today. Everyone else was in their 20's.Looking forward to finishing this adventure. Only 121 miles to go.

Grimm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656526,"Trail miles 714.8Got going a little late which isn't uncommon when at a Hostel. Trail was in really good shape and I was making good time. Took my usual mid morning break and headed out. Came to an open pasture when I realized I'd seen this pasture about an hour earlier. Crap, I'd gone the wrong way when I finished my break. I had gone the wrong way for 1.5 miles! So back I went. Ate my lunch at the same spot as my break. Now I was going to do 19+ miles instead of 16.Today's highlight was McAfee's Knob. Like so many great viewing areas the past few days, fog was all I could see. Realizing I was not going to make the 19 miles, I camped early and will have to make up the miles tomorrow going into Daleville.

Wow was it cold last night! Not sure what the temp was but I wore tights and socks to bed.  Wind calmed down and fog lifted during the night which made it feel much warmer as I woke.  I've got to get a small thermometer one of these days.
Roanoke was in the distance and have an incredibly busy airport. Flights took off and landed all night. It was too cold for the insects so it was replaced with jet engines.
I headed to Daleville VA for a couple of zeros.  I pushed hard all day to get to the post office before they closed at 5:00.  Amazing I made it, must have averaged over 2 mph for the day. Had 20 minutes to spare! Considering the boulders, I felt pretty good.
Looking forward to getting off my feet for a couple of days before the final 100 miles of my journey.

Did as little as possible.  Rash is getting better. Not sure why but sections that are free of bumps leak a clear fluid nearly all day.

Gentleman from Catskills area of NY came in to the Shelter. We had some very good discussion. Really enjoyed the evening. He also shared peaches he found growing along the trail. Very nice treat!Recent rains really hatch a bunch of flys. Gnats were thick? I got to thinking, are they the same gnats following me or is it just that I keep running into more? Put my engineering hat on once again and wondered if I could put a little tiny tiny transmitter on a few of them. lol. Then I got to thinking maybe a dye and high speed photography. In any case, they were annoying.Why is it that my head net is always in the bottom of my pack? Note to self; start storing it in the outside pockets.Grimm","

Grimm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656834,"Trail mles 758.5My plan was to make it as far as Cove Mountain Shelter today and push on if it was early enough. When I was 3 miles from the shelter, there was a sign saying no water at cove mountain. Well that made my decision easy, camp at the next water source beyond Cove Mountain. So I hiked another 3.3 miles. Doing this makes tomorrows planned 17.2 shorter, or have the option of going further so Tuesday I can get into Glasgow earlier to resupply. If it's late, I'll need to take another zero or a nero.Thinking I'm getting shin splints in my left leg. It started when I was pushing hard to get into Daleville. It was just a minor pain above the ankle. Had no issues during the two zero days and nothing during yesterdays 11 miles. Today it started again and slowly worked it way up my shin. If I kept my walking pace around 2mph, it was okay, just a minor annoyance. At camp tonight I noticed swelling and redness several inches above the ankle. I don't remember shin splints leaving a red mark and localized swelling just above the ankle.

Grimm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656881,"Trail milesWell, the left leg began bothering me to the point I felt I should get off the trail and give it a rest. The ankle and several inches above were swelled pretty good. So I called a shuttle where the trail crossed Blue Ridge Parkway and went into Stanimal's Glasgow. First I should mention I took a side trail to a service road and walked the last four miles to avoid the rocks. I actually walked further and higher using the service road.  Plan to take a zero tomorrow and ice it down.Grimm","

Then the down 1250'. My swollen ankle now includes the calf. Going up doesn't seem to be a problem but down is very painful. Just before I stopped for the day I had an intense sharp pain above the ankle, then nearly all the pain went away. Ankle swelling reduced considerably by the time I crawled into my hammock. Calf still has quite a bit of swelling. Fortunately it's the left leg so I can elevate it while I sleep. Did some stretching and both feet have similar movement now. Left still has more pain moving the foot fore and aft. Nothing as severe as before the sharp pain. Hoping tomorrow is better.Only two more days and 25 miles before I get to Spy Rock.

They were fairly easy with the exception of the last couple hundred feet which was very steep.Getting on to Spy Rock was quite emotional. It was not only the end of my journey, but being this journey was to honor the memory of my mother. As I sat there alone, I opened a bottle of cherry coke and talked to my mom. I thanked her for all she did for me and hoped she was listening as I told her how much I loved her. I cried a lot getting thru the little memorial service. For those who may not know, my mom allowed herself one cherry coke each day despite her diabetes. She could sip on a can for hours!When I finished, I got up and took several pictures of the surrounding views. As I put my pack on, getting ready to hike several miles to the next shelter, knowing the next day I'd have to decend 3200' the next day. My shin splints are agonizing on down hills. Ankle and calf on the left leg were already swelled severely, I was concerned how much bigger they would get and how much pain I would be in.It's amazing how the trail provides. A gentleman about my age came up on the rock, gazing at the beautiful surroundings. We struck up a conversation. I asked if he would be willing to take me into Waynesboro. Told him I'd be glad to pay him well if he would. He agreed but said no money. We had great conversation on both the long walk to his Jeep and the ride into town. So many wonderful people!The journey is over for now. What comes next remains to be seen.
