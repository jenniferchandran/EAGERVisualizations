Beer Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650809,"After only two miles I came to a junction where I could choose to stay on the AT on take a different trail that would reconnect. It shaved off two miles at the expense of making those lesser miles harder. Steep grade was common with some areas of rock scrambling. Got to see some waterfalls though, and I think was the meaningful part. I could have done The Correct trail to please strangers or I could take the Other Trail that was beautiful. I think I am starting this out on the right way. This is my hike, no one cares what I am doing anyway, so I’ll walk whichever way calls me

Storms continued all night and I slept fairly okay. Thunder and lightning for hours woke me up a lot. The rain loosened the ground stakes and the wind, I guess, was no help ‘cause I woke this morning at the rather late hour of 6:30 to see my tent was half the size it was yesterday (the stakes were obviously out) and a little damp. I am dry. My sleep clothes are dry. But the tent being so small left most of my stuff touching the sides and condensation is a jerk. 


Today was probably the best of the three. There were a couple of things to look at, the ground was chill enough at times I was ABLE to look around. And even though it was raining, it wasn’t bitterly cold.


Made it to Rockfish Gap just after 2. Hitched a ride into Waynesboro after about 90seconds of trying and felt pretty pleased with myself about that. From there it was pizza, check in (and spreading my tent out to “dry” under the house), went to Walmart for a resupply, got a shower, and am doing laundry. Feet are pretty sore so I picked up some shoe inserts, too, to try. We shall see…","

Slackpacked for the first time. Wasn’t planned but as I was getting ready to head back to trail, another hiker, Prince Squirrel, mentioned he was slackpacking today and I was like, oh yeah. That’s an option, sometimes. Rather than taking a zero, I asked my body if this would be a fair compromise. The only thing hurting today are my calves, okay, fair. And the arches of my feet. They are red and feel like they are sunburnt. I’m wondering if I am sliding too much in my shoes? Bought some shoe inserts which helped with the heel pain greatly. Today was the first day I needed ibuprofen. 


Also. During my hitch into town yesterday, it looks like my Kula Cloth came unclipped. Oops. Sorry, Jeff.

Miles today were easy so instead of stopping at Bearfence as planned, I saw it was only noon pressed on to Big Meadows. Had probably my smoothest camp set up with chores completed and me in bed by 7:44. Takes about 90 minutes to go from “that’ll do” to “done.” Tent, set up sleeping pad, boil water for dinner, prep breakfast and lunch for the following day, eat, brush teeth, wipe down body as best ya can, pack up and hang bear bag… Everything just takes so much time and there is little room for error. Spill your water? You gonna be thirsty. Knock over your food? How dirty is it REALLY? Snag a hole in your tent or sleeping pad? That’s gonna be a pain to repair. Time consuming and stressful.

100 miles! For a normal person, that’s a lot. For the AT, folks are like, “oh, just got on trial?” My 100 miles happened to be almost EXACTLY at Skyland in Shenandoah so I treated myself to the blackberry pie and a beer. 
Horrible chaffing and injii socks gave blisters between toes. No real segway  between pie and pain. My thighs look a bit like Swedish fish and I’ve never had this much blister juice soak my socks from my toe webbing. Gotta find a solution here cause Body Glide and tying my shoes tighter ain’t it.

Sunrise from my tent and pretty good sleep. Tent was about level with a wind break dip in the ground so even though wind was NUTS last night, it went just over my tent and didn’t even rattle anything. Mostly sounded like the ocean. 
Low energy day. Didn’t get going until near 8 and then kinda puttered my way down Mary’s Rock. Saw where I sprained my ankle. At Thornton Gap spent some time washing my thighs where the chaffing is bad. Ended up wasting an hour there, too. Puttered on and met a PCT thru hiker, Kay, who flew past me and then we met half a mile later where she was sitting on the trail just having a midlife crisis. Got water from a spring and took a solid hour for lunch, even sitting there and called Mom. These were probably the easiest miles of the trail so even with my starts and stops, got 12 miles. Plan was to camp tonight at Pass Mt, about 8 miles back. Got enough food for two days so it’s good I’m ahead of schedule. Somehow didn’t bring enough for the days I was supposed to be out here.

$40 for lunch/dinner (fried pickles, a beer, and a burger)
Bed in a shared cabin hostel ($35)


So. It’s a cabin. It’s small. And it hosts eight people… sure. Let’s get cozy!


Last night was nuts. In bed, dozing off. Maybe upper 50s/lower 60s. Nice. Didn’t need my leggings and opened the foot box of my quilt. Comfortable. Just me alone on my mountain top. Had taken a nice little Don’t See Me backcountry bath using almost a full liter of water. Good times. Then it got windy. Then it rained. Then it was windy and rainy. And then the temperature sunk like the cruise industry in 2020. Just a bitter cold pack up this morning, but lucky I had my gloves from Appalachian Outfitters, were I got my shower last week, so I didn’t feel the need to launch myself off the mountain. Couldn’t check in to the hostel until “at least 3,” and with only seven miles to get there, had time to kill. Met a cool hiker named Jamie and their friend…whose name I’ve already forgot ‘cause goldfish brain  
Obstacle today (Jamie pointed out a cheat option that just required a little bushwhacking and trespassing…). They had seen me on the Appalachian Trail Women’s group and was like, “hey! You’re the lady with the chaffed crouch and blisters between her toes!” …yes. Yes, I am. 


Hitched a ride into town with a dude who had painted “Let’s Go Brandon” across all four sides of his Honda which was full of trash. He had just left his family dinner cause his ex sister in law was there and he, “can’t stand that hussy.” I read the situation and told him Happy Easter (somehow guessed he was Christian) and we started talking about gun rights (how’d THAT come up so quickly) but I was all, “yeah, but you cross into NY with a gun and it’s just not worth it.” A really nice guy who actually popped a U to pick me up but ideologically we disagree on everything. Or we would if I wasn’t just playing the Republican Passing card I was born with. 


Cute town but yeah. Easter. Outfitter was closed (tent pole cracked last night). Cell screen protector has a crack and T-Mobile was closed. The GROCERY store was closed. Most food was closed aside from a barbecue place. Delicious but more than I wanted to spend on a single meal. Kismet. 


At the hostel now, a brick cabin converter to host five beds. I’ll be sharing the downstairs space with a guy and his dog tomorrow. At least it’s a private space for now. Underwear time!!!","

Felt like an idiot at 8 am as rain fell softly, but around 10 is switched to snow (5”!!!). Shenandoah closed the roads and folks were scuttling to get off trail. I took the day to get new shoes, new socks, a pair of boxer-briefs (we shall see), my resupply done, managed two good meals in there, played Pokémon in the snow; and rode the free trolley around town. An excellent day. 


I love my little nook in the hostel. A guy with a dog and I are sharing a space behind the kitchen with curtains blocking us away and I divider between us. It ain’t much, but the bed is soft and I can retreat away from the bravado and boasting.

Stealth camp 


So cold this morning I had a hard time getting going. Even though I was up at 5:30, then 6:20, I didn’t leave the shelter until 8 something. I just couldn’t get out of my blanket. Needed to clear 15 miles today but just didn’t have it. Feet hurt and I just ran out of fuel. Came close though. Disappointed I couldn’t push through. Also disappointed my legs don’t feel stronger. The past four miles of The Roller Coaster dang near killed me. I was hoping the 166 miles we’ve done would have noticeably strengthened my legs for this part. Guess it is too soon. I remember it being steep and just 14 miles of PUDs, but I didn’t remember it being this rocky. At least there is a lot of water. 


Saw TWO snakes, though, so it ended up being a good day. 


Weird pain in heel. Like I pulled a muscle. But in my heel. Odd. 


166 miles in 16 days with two days being zeros is more than double the recommended 8 miles a day. After Harper’s Ferry, I need to really watch my miles for another two weeks.

Tent in a patch of moss in a clearing. 


I don’t know why it is a law that one must have rain of some sort when doing The Roller Coaster section of the AT but we had just enough rain to make things slick, muddy, and cool. I couldn’t figure out how I did this last time with less difficulty but then remembered I gave myself 5 nights instead of 4 last time. Fair enough. 


I have about 14 to Harper’s Ferry. The time crunch of getting into HF at a convenient time for Dina was probably the only really stress. I did it. I’ll be at HF tomorrow no problem, but not at the noon with time to explore I wanted. This will be dragging my muddy, chaffed, bloody carcass out of the woods in time for dinner. 


I can’t believe it has only been 17 days. 


It was kinda pleasing to see a couple of people called it early during the day. I saw tents already up at 3. The rain and rocks were pissing a few folks off. A thru hiker from Springer said, “this isn’t fucking hiking. I don’t know what this is, but it’s not fucking hiking.” Agreed. 


Mantra today was, however, coming up or going down, “this is the shit that makes you stronger. This suck is the kinda suck that will get you over the Whites.” 


Did the last hill of the Roller Coast with no pauses chanting, “fuck this coaster. Fuck this coaster.” It was really important for me to not wake up in that section tomorrow. Seeing that, “hikers beware,” sign made the mile after a little lighter. 


Not enough to get me to commit to night hiking though. My goal was to try to get 2.5 miles further down, but the trail is still slick and I don’t know how difficult it is to spot a site in the dark. Also, I was a little shivery from the damp clothes and just wanted to get warm and dry. Maybe we can get out of bed early and make up the miles. 


Saw two young deer that didn’t seem like they had seen a human before. They didn’t run away as I walked in the trail but kinda watched going, “huh. Kinda slow and noisy, ain’t it?”

~15miles (don’t know where I started but I saw the ATC was 15 miles away at some point)
In a bed! With a door! (Dina’s house)


It’s hard to really imagine, but picture silence. There is almost always the sound of a truck or lawn mower in the distance, but is 7:03 and… no. Nothing. It’s quiet. Now, when it is too quiet, you will hear your blood pulsing in your ears or a high-pitched hum, but no. There is just enough of a breeze created by your walking to cut the air on the rim of you ear to mute those. The ground is rocky but requires only a little attention so your steps are fairly regular on the ground muted by the heavy morning dew. Mmpppm, mmpppm, mmmppppm, mmpppm… it’s quiet, but every now and then a bird song you don’t know will break the stillness. A woodpecker breaks a bird song. The nails of a squirrel drive into the bark of a dying tree. These sounds come and go. Three bird songs all at one and then… it’s quiet. The mmmmmpppm, mmmmpppm of your feet continues. The distance sound of a train. You are walking into town today. 


Slept well. So nice to wake up not frozen. Woke up several times between 3 and 6 because I knew I needed to get an early start if I wanted to make it to Harper’s Ferry before the ATC closed. My goal was originally something like 2 so Dina could just scoop me on her way home but… luckily the miles were normal today. Not “easy,” I don’t know if the AT has “easy” miles, but the rocks were dry and the grade was in my favor. The only bad thing was I did run out of water during the heat of the day. There was a spring the night before and then that liter at the shelter. Basically had 2.5 liters of water over the course of 22 hrs…while hiking. I could have done the side trail at Lesser Shelter (where I found a liter of water left on the porch. This dang shelter had a swing!!!) but figured I’d be okay until I got to Key’s Gap, but once I got to Key’s I still had some water left and figured I’d press on to HF and get water from the creek closer to town. Well. That creek was low and it was gonna require scooping and filtering takes time and it was already 3 soooooo. I know my body and knew we were fine but was uncomfortable. The nice lady at the Appalachian Trail Center filled my bottle and I downed a liter in a moment. 


West Virginia. 


West Virginia is only a couple miles of the trail. Still covering familiar ground. Came sooooo close to just asking Dina to pick me up at Key’s Gap, which was closer to her home anyway, because I didn’t think I could close those six miles in time. Well. We did it. And Judo, the woman at the ATC who gave me water, said Tye River to Harper’s Ferry in 18 was pretty good, especially considering two of those days were zeros. Thank you, Nice Lady. It’s been hard and I love a good head pat.

“Well, as we say in the spirit world, there's your plan and then... there's the gods' plan.”


So. It’s hard to feel like a hiker when I’m basically couch surfing at a friend’s house. The tent pole Nemo, the maker of my tent, sent me was the wrong dang pole and their customer support doesn’t work weekends. Today was a blast but I woke up the morning at 6:15 thinking about that send-off breakfast the ATC was hosting for flip-floppers. The plan was to be in Maryland tonight. Well. Plans are things that get changed. I’m probably not going to get my Nemo tent poles tomorrow, but at least a plan can be made. I need to get some miles going. Gotta get to Boston in a few weeks. 
So. The plan is to get a couple things in a box and bounce it back to my dad. I wanna pop into the local outfitter and see if maybe they can help. I’m gonna try to press Nemo to just send me a full pole system already put together and have it for me in Waynesboro. That already means I have to commit to shelters and hope there is space for four nights. They owe me a guaranteed working set of poles for the inconvenience, I figure. Hope they feel the same. Looks like, since I’ll be arriving on a weekend, I might just need to have the poles sent to the post office in Rouzerville, PA. I dunno. No point in worrying about it tonight.","

Got tent repaired and sent a box of stuff to my dad yesterday….


Man. These were probably the easiest miles I’ve experienced but I just didn’t have it in me today. My backpack felt impossibly heavy and was hurting my shoulder. My right heel felt bruised. My ankle popped out of place and for a few minutes I didn’t think I was going to be able to walk anymore and was looking for a bail-out option. It rained. Not a lot just just enough to get things damp. I stopped six miles in and just sat at a shelter for awhile. Ate lunch. Just spaced out. Decided I could go to the next shelter only 4 miles down and ended up sitting outside a bathroom in Gathland State Park as the heaviest of the rain hit. Got to this shelter around 2:30 and was like, “good enough.” Really should have been able to make it to the shelter 5 more miles down, I mean. I stopped at 2:30, but decided it just wasn’t worth the push. Maybe we can knock of 15 tomorrow. We shall see how the terrain holds. In the meantime, I’m in a shelter by myself with two dudes in hammocks, MacGyver and Hatchet, who are easy to converse with. There is a creek Right There so plenty of water for tonight and tomorrow.

Beautiful day and knocked out nearly 15 miles. Going down to 31 again tonight. What can I remember about today?


Stopped a lot. Had a protein bar at the Rocky Run shelter around 10 (second breakfast), got water and had a sit at Dehlmar campground, and had lunch at the Washington monument state park with a squad of folks doing a section together. Legs are okay but feet got kinda sassy today. 


I was thinking about trail magic randomly today. I don’t know if I’ll see any trail magic because of when I’m hiking, but if I do, I decided today I would totally accept. I think 200+ miles with grapple and snow walks makes me at least a potential thru hiker. Never felt right last year cause I knew I wasn’t committed to finishing. Now every time I consider quitting, like tonight when it’s fucking freezing, I remember that quitting means making a decision about going back to work and that motivates me to keep walking. It’s exciting because there are only 19 miles to Waynesboro and then the trail is new to me again. 


It’s funny how much effort camp chores take. It took all my mental haranguing abilities to get me to just get the damned wet wipes and wipe down my skin. It’s cold and it’s just… everything is such a time-sucking hassle.

Good vibes at the shelter. Three of the dudes from last night are here and I met another woman flip-flopping, Bubbles. On the way to the shelter, about two hours away, I was asked if I was Beer Girl. I recalled making a joke about marrying someone for a beer the night before and suspected this had something to do with that, but this dude was heading south.

Went down to 32 and felt so much warmer. How freaking cold was it the night before???


Made it to Fayetteville this afternoon. Had a fall (just a soft spot in the ground) and now my leg is kinda bothering me. Hopefully I can sleep it off. Did cross mile 250 today! 250 feels like a significant milestone for some reason. 


A bunch of us (“Ernie,” “Bubbles,” “Root Seeker,” “Gazelle,” Henry, and myself) went to a buffet for dinner and then Walmart for a resupply. It’s weird how you just bond with people you don’t necessarily have much in common with because of a unique situation. It reminds me of friendships I would make with people in other countries. “Well, we don’t see eye-to-eye on much, but we both speak English and are in Turkey soooooo. Friend?” 


From the PA state line and for the next fifty miles are supposedly some of the easiest of the whole of the AT. Most folks in the group are gonna be trying to put some miles in but….

Wellllllll….. left the hostel at 7:30 and had a mile highway road walk before getting to trail. Today was, again, super easy miles (comparatively to other AT miles, not normal life) and I had visions of getting some proper distance in but I got distracted a lot today stopping at one shelter to just appreciate how nice it was (Quarry Gap), talked to people as we passed, ate lunch under an umbrella-like pine tree when the rain was coming down, and just delighted with all the scenery changes today. It was rainy and misty and moody and dark, and the forest rotated between sparse to dense. It was the perfect day for listening to spooky stories and putting some miles in.  Slowly. While taking lots of pictures. Kinda funny that by 3:30 I was the last one at the shelter. By 5, everyone had finished dinner and by 6 most were asleep. Another hiker just arrived at 7:30 and seems pissed off at us for most of us being asleep. I was the only one of the five up and he was talking loud and asking the group questions like, “so, everyone planning on doing 20 tomorrow,” and, “I’m Burger Fries (or something). Anyone else have a trail name yet and feels like talking?” Seems kinda rude to want attention when folks are sleeping. I definitely got the vibe he is assuming everyone here is just a weekender (which is rude cause weekend or year, the shelters are for backpackers whether one night or one hundred). Nope, dude, four flip floppers and a LASHer doing 600. We just got here before you and there isn’t much else to do but sleep. 


I talked to him. Yep. He’s a tool. “Yeah, I mean, I do a minimum of 25 a day,” and, “I mean, that’s a $300 EE quilt so…” He got on at Gravel Springs last week (and tried to explain to me where that is. My dude. I KNOW Shenandoah now.). Yeah. He’s fast. That’s cool. Make sure you stretch after all that flexing. 


I was thinking today about that saying folks have that “the trail provides.” I certainly felt like I got that today. Little things like needing to pee and finding myself in a state park where, right around the corner, was a bathroom with flush toilets and soap that had just been cleaned. Starting to rain but don’t really wanna bust out all the rain gear? Well, even though it’s been nothing but bare brown winter trees, poof. Here’s a giant old pine that is basically an umbrella. Sit. Have lunch. Have another pee. When you are finished, the rain will stop. Oh, and the trail noticed you lost one of your trekking pole tips in Vegas. Well, here. Someone lost theirs from the same brand and using the same style you have. And, of course, the best is when the rain really got going, oh look. A shelter. Sure. You called it a day at THREE, but. Dry. And it’s only getting into the upper 40s tonight. So, here. Here’s a perfect sitting log by a classic babbling brook to sit on while you journal today.

New shoes also hurt my feet. Like every freaking pair of shoes, these are too big and too small. I’m sliding around and crushing my toes and the side of my foot. I’m sick of my feet hurting and I’m sick of falling. Tripped again over GD nothing and just had a temper tantrum. Maybe I can blame it on me not sleeping well the past two nights. Again. Six miles to go at noon. Just sitting here having a proper sulk and glad no one is around to witness it. 


(Five hours later)


Okay. So. There have been some developments. I fell again and kinda lost my shit. There may have been yelling and crying while horizontal on a collection of roots and rocks. I may have been crying while hiking for a good mile after that. I got to a road crossing and was like, “what’s your plan? You just gonna hope these shoes work better tomorrow?” I am SORE. Toes, metatarsals, shoulder… first car that passed picked me up as I hitched BACK into town. Popped into the shoe store and settled on a pair of Oboz again. I don’t love these. They make my feet feel like bricks, but they also kinda feel like putting my feet in casts and they are kinda happy with that. Got the new Hokas sent back to my dad and I’ll deal with return them to REI later.

Can’t freaking wait to be able to get back to dispersed camping. Didn’t wanna do 6.6 ambit also didn’t wanna do 17. On schedule, though, for a late August summit. 


Pretty enough morning. Left late, around 8, and made it to camp around 1 with a few lazy stops along the way. (Not, like, hours and hours though. Probably could have made it here at noon.) Ended up hiking with Hot Rod cause we have similar paces. 


Heard from Bubbles, again, too. So while she had a fall a few days ago and needed stitches, her friend fell yesterday and got a concussion and needed to go to the hospital. Jesus! This shit is only a few days up the trail!!!


Shoes worked better but I find them to be very foot fatiguing. Very firm. That’s what I need right now cause of the past couple weeks of hiking in bad shoes but. These aren’t It either. 


What else…? Bird pooped on my tent. Like. I have had birds poop on it before, but it was kinda like a bird exploded out of its own bottom.  Hit mile 700 yesterday, too. 


I dunno. I have just been in a bit of a funk the past couple of days. The questions of whether or not I can really do this or why am I doing this keep popping up.

Today was pretty good, actually. Got an early start, on trail before 6, and the first hour was lovely. Picturesque farm on a hill, meadows, creeks, pine forests… ended the day at only 1 something at Little Goose Pond, which looks more like a lake and was fine for swimming. Swam a little but being spring-fed, it was a bit cool for me. 


A mile and some change into trail, there was a farm stand selling sodas, snacks, and ice cream honor system. Spent $4 on two sodas, a big of chips, and an ice cream. Getting my breakfast calories up to almost 800 (ANd having caffeine) sure made the first couple hours better. I don’t know why more folks who live on trail don’t sell stuff on the side. 


Bugs were nuts today and I ended up running out of water. Could have made do or scooped at a water source, but I decided to just ask some dude doing yard work if I could fill up a bottle from his spigot. Not only did that guy let me have some water when I needed it, later that day strangers on a boat delivered Hot Rod and I a couple beers (AND came back to take the trash), and ANOTHER guy gave us a big ol’ block of cheese. Just. Here’s half a pound of Vermont cheddar. Enjoy. 


And we did. Just sat there eating cheese and drinking our beer with our feet in the water watching sunfish. Later a group on a Beginner Backpacking trip showed up, and we all just hung out. Met a girl named Gangster (she’s precious) and another named Snail Spider. The three of us hung out back at the campsite, they are tenting where I am, and it was just a chill evening.

Man, I got…like… five hours of sleep. In a tent on an air mattress. Not the best quality. Was on trail a few minutes after six and had a pretty decent day. Rain came in around 10am or so and… well. You ever tried to drive a car in the rain with no windshield wipers? That was me with glasses today. Plus they fogged up. There were moments when I literally had to stop walking cause I couldn’t see if I was supposed to go straight or turn. Super fun with rocks and roots. 


But. Did it. Got the nine and something miles into town down (the trail went through the town), got lunch and a bonus sandwich for later (ate half already), and then knocked out the four and something to the campsite for the night.

Okay, I’m actually writing this a couple days later. The night I got into camp, even though it was early, I just had zero energy. Bugs were bad, no mobile signal, and just eh. So…


Today I finished Greylock. Didn’t push to the 16 miles and called it a day around 11. Because I linger, well, I get to linger. Spent an hour at the Greylock summit just messing around. Talked to some staff, went into the observation tower thing… then it was the two mile descent. That sucked. It wasn’t terribly steep or hard, but it just. Kept. Going. And the mountains coming up are gonna be worse but whatever. That sucked then. 


Met some trail maintainers who were working on an AT reroute (cause there is no AT. It changes every year). Around this time I heard that there was trail magic two miles ahead and decided to try to scamper. Went as fast as I could, which isn’t saying much, and blew past the last water source for a couple miles to arrive at the trail magic in time to see it packing up. Sad face forever. Couldn’t even get my bottle refilled and BACKTRACKING is garbage, so I pressed on hoping to just bother someone in the neighborhood I was walking through to ask for some hose water. It didn’t come to that when, just a quarter mile later, was a cooler at an AT message sign with bottles of water and Gatorade! Truly magical! Talked to some of the folks hanging out there for a bit and scored a grapefruit. After piddling around I knew I didn’t wanna make it a 16 mile day, it was already 2:30, so I settled for the unpopular site south of the VT border. Got more water from a friendly house on trail who left a hose with a sign on it saying, “water for hikers,” and then started the gradual climb up. Again, most people pressed on for the Vermont border so I had the overgrown and buggy campsite to myself. Massaquito proved to live up to the name, so by 7:30 I was horizontal in my tent trying to sleep.

I didn’t journal yesterday and now I have no idea what happened. Okay. Well. Today I crossed into Vermont. That’s far. 780 some miles now. My goal this morning was to get to Cogdon shelter, a 12.7 mile day, but Hot Rod was gonna make it to town and Bubbles arrived this evening so I was kinda motivated. 


I also wanted to get to a CVS or Walgreens. More on that later. 


Was alone all night at the camp which was a rarity. Left my vestibules open in my tent so the predawn sky was easy to notice. I toss and turn and wake up multiple times during the night. The norm. At 4:25 this morning I woke up, saw the sky, and went, “fuck it. Let’s go.”  Was on trail and scooting just before 6 and started with a nice climb and then some bullshit rocks. The bullshit didn’t piss me off toooooo much cause it put me eye level with blueberries…blue blueberries. Ripe blueberries!!! Awesome! Stopped for a minute or two then pressed on. Trail was pretty calm, eye of the storm?, and I made it to Warner shelter, the half-way point for my dad around 10. Well. I could go to Cogdon and be there around 1 or 2….or I could press into town. 


Anddddddds, I noticed on GutHooks there was a trail parallel to the AT. When I looked on Google, I saw it was the old Long Trail (and a guy in town told me it was the old AT, too, which I kinda suspected). The current AT hooks east but Bennington is west…. Wasn’t gonna save me any miles, especially since I could get a hitch easily off the current path into town and this had me walking in but… it just felt more adventurous. Left my pack on the AT, walked the .2 down to the other trail and looked at it. Yep. That’s a trail. It was actually a…”road.” One of those off-road roads with the big rocks and mud puddles. Here was the gamble. I didn’t know if this road/trail was actually a thing anymore. I didn’t know if I was gonna walk 5 or 6 miles and then find something making the journey impossible and then have to backtrack. But…I was curious. Sooooooo. 


Okay. A long time ago, this was the AT. Before that, the Long Trail. Before that, a stage coach road. It’s old and used. The nice thing was that it was wide but… a lot of the surface dirt was gone so it was like Rocksylvania all over again BUT with a shit ton of boggy mud. Parts were hard to navigate and I had to keep cutting into the woods. Thought for sure I was gonna see a moose but just a ton of frogs, a couple snakes, and ALL THE BUGS. ALL of them. Didn’t even want to stop to eat or drink water because the bugs were so thick they were crawling up my shirt into my bug net. It was flat, comparatively, but so rocky my ankles are sore. With three miles left I went ahead and switched to my camp shoes cause my feet were hurting. Between Google satellite, GutHooks, and AllTrails, I was able to navigate through the abandoned parts into ATV territory and the rough road, down to the last couple miles of dirt road then into town. 


So. I mentioned wanted a pharmacy. Well. The other day it rained. Okay. I got wet. I hiked wet. I chaffed… in a delicate area. I’m a bit irritated and was worried I might need to get something for it, but I wanted to just try getting clean and dry first. Now. I have had skin issues almost this entire trail, so I went into Walgreens and picked up some antibacterial soap to wash my skin with. Now, if you have ever had a cut on your hand and then used hand sanitizer, you know how bad that feels. Now imagine that’s your crotch. The burning pain of hand sanitizer but somewhere you probably never had hand sanitizer before and the skin there is chafed with hundreds of tiny tears. I thought I was gonna die in the shower. I don’t know if the pain means it was a good idea or bad idea in the long run… I’m clean, though. Even my feet smell acceptable. Small wins at this point of, “hey, that pain was bad but it lessened!,” is where I am now.  


Around 9:20 I decided to call it a night, but then Bubbles texted that she was in Bennington and heading to the hotel so I ended up walking down the street to meet her. So good to have her back even though it was a LOT of bad luck on her side that slowed her down enough for me to catch up. Now, if only we could get Pastor Bait back!!!","

Not as much to say about today. No cool water to swim in or plane crashes. Just four back-to-back ups and downs with only one of them having a view. That view, however, included seeing Katahdin for the first time.

Picked a ton of blueberries, forded another stream (got my butt wet), had a smallish climb and then, at 12:19, the trail got calm and stayed that way. Yeah, SOME rocks and mud, but that’s not the norm. It was…nice. As I mentioned, I chilled by the lake, “pond,” for a bit with some folks then got over here by Cooper Falls to swim. Well. That was the plan. Sun retreated just as I arrived and it’s a bit too cool for me to swim, but I got in up to my shoulders and gave my skin a good scrubbing as best I could with my hands. Wanted to rinse my hair but…just too cold with no sun or towel. 


Lots of folks at the shelter and rain coming in tonight. Always a weird vibe when we know it’s gonna rain. Everyone is just resigned to, “well, guess we are gonna get wet,” and tries to hunker down. I was tempted to stay in the lean-to with a bunch of other folks cause packing up a wet tent SUCKS, but I’m kinda doing a no-huts and no-music thing during the HMW. Then I music thing is to save my phone battery, can only change my battery bank when I left Monson and MAYBE when I get to Abol, but that’s a ten-day stretch. Wanna make sure I can take photos of Katahdin. 


Good mood at the lean-to, though. Everyone who stopped all had, at least for today, the “wait, this is supposed to be enjoyable,” lecture with themselves and so there was no talk of crushing the miles or whatever. We made a fire. Folks swam. I played cards with someone. I’m NEVER out there crushing the big miles, but today still felt like a rest. 


The rain rolling in tonight has be a bit concerned about where I’ve set up my tent. I’m not in a dispersed site or at the lean-to, but just some random clearing I found a few minutes down the way.

Tent was, indeed, wet inside and out, but all my important stuff like my sleeping bag and diddy bag stayed dry. Was aiming for a late start but didn’t wanna just sit in a wet tent so I was on trail by 7:10. Late, but not late enough. I got to my destination for my food pick up about three hours early and just set up my tent.  A bunch of us showed up early but by 10:30, so was our food drop! Nice! It was a cheerful, social moment. All of us happy to have food again, commiserating about how heavy our bags were now, and hiking about how miserably wet we all were. Most folks were set to do another 15 mile, but my goal was only 6 away, Sand Beach. Arrived just after 3 to see one dude, Quitter, setting up. He had planned on doing a big day but. This spot was premium. I communicated my intent to not get my almost-dry bra wet again and proceeded to jump in wearing only my boxer-briefs. Getting a piece of clothing wet that was sooooo close to dry would be a sin. 
All day, it was rainy and overcast, but for a few brief moments in the late afternoon, the sun would peak out and all of us just delighted in the sunshine. And then…the clouds dissipated entirely. We were going to have a clear sky at this remote lake with moonrise not happening until after 1am. Oh yeah. Two Braids, Quitter, and I all announced our intent on cowboy camping.  But…keeping our tents up just in case. We laid there on the sand on our ground cloths or sleep foams just watching as the first stars came out and then see how a couple more became visible every time you looked. 


Alas, I noticed how damp my quilt was getting, so I put it back in my tent and just sat there watching the last of the blue sky fade away until the Milky Way was visible. Quitter decided the moment was too beautiful not to have a Star Swim and he jumped back into the lake. I considered it, but it was just too cold for me. Eventually we all knew we needed to sleep, most folks doing 19 tomorrow, and I went back into my tent. Every time I’d wake up throughout the night, though, I’d poke my head outside.

Looks like Rainbow Dam tomorrow, Hurdle Friday, and I might arrive at Baxter on Saturday for a Sunday summit. Katahdin was so abstract until I could see the damned thing. 

So I finished my day at 1:30. Probably could have gotten a couple more miles in there, but I just got my food resupply yesterday 
and, again, Katahdin is getting real close. Sooo. Yay! New lake! This one isn’t NEARLY as welcoming to swim in cause there is mud within view and I feel like leeches might be present. They are in most of the ponds and lakes up here. Not yesterday’s pond. That one was basically pooped out by a unicorn. 

Woke up earlier than necessary but enjoyed just looking out the open door of my tent to the lake. Last night around 2am the rain started. Somehow Two Braids slept though it and Quitter didn’t notice for a good five minutes. He woke her up and they both went into their tents. I assumed, oops, they had gone into their tents earlier when I woke up to the soft start of the rain and heard no one else stir. How could people sleep through rain on their face? Easily, it would appear. Anyway, none of us slept well between the rain and the stars. All of us kept waking up and looking at the stars instead of just going back to sleep. Whatever. Instead of an early start, most folks slept in. I, however, was in my birthday suit at 5:30 in the center of the lake watching the sunrise. No point in getting stuff wet! Wasn’t until nearly eight when I got going. The dudes left after me but still passed me. Two Braids was aiming to do a 20 with Perceval so she gave herself a two-hour head start. I met up with the dudes at the next shelter where we all got water from The Best Spring on the AT. It was pretty good. Not as amazing at the spring I hit a couple days back, but it was better than the tepid lake water we all dumped out and replaced.

So, it turns out I had met Perceval before. Way back in PA or NY, I crossed a road in the rain and a man was passing out coffee. I didn’t need the coffee, but I think he had apples as well. Perceval came down while I was there, got a cup of coffee, and kept going. He remembered meeting me and figured it out the other day. Well done! 

So here I am. It’s nearly 8:30. Gonna stand up and check the sky in about twenty minutes. Let the darkness settle in. I’m at a nice, actual camping spot that has a picnic table! A hiker I’ve seen a couple times now, Pasta, ended up joining me here. By him being here, the spot is just a little too full for someone else to join and a few folks are at the tenting sites just a few minutes back. It’s nice cause he is a quiet dude and it’s kinda like being alone, but we’ve met a few times now so dinner was sociable. The spot we are at must be popular for locals to boat to. There was an abandoned folding chair, a ton of red marbles all over the place, and a 28oz can of Bush Beans we split. The problem is, we opened the can. Now it’s trash. And not just any trash, sharp trash that can tear gear. I feel badly about this, but I washed it so it wouldn’t get gross and attract animals but…. I’m leaving it here. Hopefully the boat people won’t mind scooping it when they come back. I picked up a few pieces of small litter I’m going to pack out!!!

Time jump: 9:30 pm. The sky is crystal clear, the lake is still as a painting, and the stars are reflected in the water. I’m hoping someone out here is seeing this tonight, too. 

Less magical, there are a ton of critters running around the site tonight and it’s so still and quiet, of course all I can do is listen. Leave my food bag alone!!!","

Was up early enough to watch the first round of colors hit the sky and was packed and just sitting on the beach for sunrise, but when I felt how warm that morning sun was… lingered for another hour to let my clothes dry. Got on trail just enough to make it to a privy .4 miles away. Dude. This privy had TP AND hand sanitizer. Fancy! 


Trail was a bit more like usual. Much tougher today than the past two days. Roots, rocks, and used my hands. The highlight of the day for myself and others was getting to a peak where we could all get a tick of cell service. Friday, tomorrow, is gonna have bad weather but Sat and Sun are looking better. I called a couple places in town to see who has room. Don’t want to reserve anything but see what my options are. Most places are looking to be fairly full Sat, so I’m hoping to summit and get to town Sunday. 


AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!


Only 13 miles from Abol bridge and 24 from Katahdin’s summit. That abstract thing looming in the distance is getting really close. 


Anyway, after everyone’s Contact With the Outside World (a bunch of folks all sitting around on their phones calling hostels and home), it was back down to another small, leechy-looking pond. Ate some berries, had lunch by some cascades, and said good bye to Pasta, we had been leapfrogging all day, at a shelter he stopped at. Then it was just me and my thoughts and my glasses that are pissing me off. Either these are defective or my prescription has changed significantly cause the right lens is warped in bad ways. Lots of blurry spots and fishbowling happening. Poor left eye is doing its best, but its job has always just been to keep my face mostly symmetrical. 


Anyway, the dam is producing a steady white noise. I can see Katahdin across the water from my tent. While Sand Beach was my favorite campsite so far, I will admit this one is more beautiful. The water is crystal (which makes it deceptively deep as a dude discovered earlier trying to walk across a section) and Katahdin is impressive. Likely gonna rain tonight so buckled down as best as possible. Could easily push to Abol but  no point in getting to Katahdin before Sunday. 


…despite the loud noise of a dam, a dude snoring across the site startled me. Whoa. That was impressive. Might need my earplugs tonight….","

Beer Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657282,"Two falls today…And one of those falls got my leg nice and bloody. A stray branch I just didn’t see caught the toe of my shoe. I went completely airborne down Rainbow Ledges, a stone slab, and remember thinking, “ahhh! Shit! Aim for the moss!!!” It bled more than it truly warranted, and even though Bubbles made a rule that, “unless the blood reaches your sock, keep hiking,” I let my sock absorb some of the blood. 


13.4 miles and all done before 2 pm. Yay, me! Yeah. Ended up pushing to Abol. I mean. I got to my stopping point today at 11:51. 9 days to complete the 100 Mile Wilderness. And I definitely didn’t push myself! I liked being done by 2 most days. Felt like I carried too much food, but I still have tomorrow and Summit Day to account for. 


Anyway. Today wasn’t strenuous although it wasn’t EASY either. Lots of roots, rocks, rain, and mud. No climbs of significance but just kinda rolling up and down with a 700’ small climb toward the middle of the day. Couldn’t take many photos because of the rain, but did have the best sunrise of the trail so far. Got some decent pics of that. Didn’t waste much time trying to get a signal at Rainbow Ledges ‘cause of the rain, either. Popped out of the 100MW, however, and straight into Trail Magic! Husband and wife team making burgers and had a cooler of Millers and Cokes. Well, too late in the day for me to have caffeine sooooooo. Two beers and a cheeseburger later, I walked the .1 to the Abol Bridge Camp Store and Restaurant and had another drink, and order of poutine, and some broccoli’n’cheese bites. 8 days of significant calorie deficits and then one afternoon of, “FOOOOOOD!!!!!” 


So now it’s after 7. I’m at this random Department of Maine campground, a normal campground that I would stay at with my mom. It’s a bunch of thru hikers and one cramped site of normal weekenders. Weird vibe. For some folks, tomorrow is their last day. Some people go from here to the summit and down. It’s a 20-something mile day, but you don’t have to worry about getting a walk-in site at The Birches, the thru hiker site that takes 12 people. It’s just weird to be surrounded by folks I have seen off-and-on the past couple days on such an emotional day for them. Wish I had a crew I was hiking with. Happy bastards. 


Probably need to call it a night. Gonna try to be at the ranger station at 5:45 to get my place in line for The Birches. Some folks were there at 3:30 this morning for a sign-up sheet that gets posted at 7. I’ll see what 5:45 does. I’ve heard that they usually try to find a place for everyone.","

Beer Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657289,"It’s after 7 and I have an EARLY start tomorrow so imma make this short. Made it into Baxter! Left Abol Pines at 5:10 to walk the half mile to Baxter to get to the ranger station to be one of the 12 to get to camp at the Birches. Trail today was pretty dang easy and I ended the day with a full cup of huckleberries. 


Maybe I’ll have time tomorrow to expand these thoughts. 


Folks can’t pay attention to directions. 
Blueberries are trash and huckleberries are a Superior fruit.","

Beer Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657290,"When I was twenty, I had a surgery go bad. Doctors thought I was 50/50 gonna make it and offered to call in a priest. That was unpleasant. 


When I was in my thirties, I was mugged in Indonesia by a guy with a knife who told me he knew I was alone. That was uncomfortable. 


Climbing up the Hunt Trail before sunrise was the scariest thing I have ever done in my life without exception or hyperbole. 


But. Your girl, me, Beer Girl. I fucking summited Katahdin. I did it absolutely a-fucking-lone from the time I left camp to taking my selfie at the summit. A selfie cause there was no one there to take my picture. Luckily, to be fair, a trio of thru hikers had summited before me and was hiding from the wind enjoying the sunrise and waiting for someone to show up and take THEIR photo. 


I didn’t cry, but I did whoop really loud when I figured out a rather technical climb. I gasped when I saw the Katahdin sign cause I thought I had one more false summit before I arrived. And even though I am not scared of heights, I got fucking vertigo and nauseous when I looked back a couple times going through the .8 Hell (for folks 5’3” and under who can’t REACH some of the rebar that supposed to “help”) that was The Gateway. There were a few times I hit a rock and was like, “well. That’s it. I can’t get over that.” Sometimes I found an around and sometimes I had to “science the shit out of it.” Poker a hole in my pack and these trousers are probably good to get me back to VA and no where else but damn. 


I really didn’t know if I could do that. 


And the BEST part is. The BEST part was just yesterday I was like, “huh. I feel…stronger. Like. Not like the other hikers but I think I have my trail legs. I think this is as good as it’s gonna get and this does feel easier and better than before.” I COULD NOT have done this a month ago. I couldn’t even have gotten halfway when I first got on. I did 2.2 miles in a hour getting started this morning. 2.2 going UP. The technical stuff and decent slowed me down because it always will and that’s FINE. I lifted all my weight with my left arm. I pulled myself up and over shit well over my head. I put the tread of my toe in dips in the rock you could only see from the right angle and walked UP. 


Now. If I could only get a hitch back to the other side of this park. Three people have made, “oh, sorry!” faces as they drove by. It’s 16 miles back to where I left most of my kit. 


…..


Man, I’m feeling rather proud of myself, as you can see. I did something really hard and scary, and just when I’m feeling good, “are you out for a day hike??? Good for youuuuuuuu!” from a lady in the parking lot. Fuck you! I’ve done over 1200 miles and I summited Katahdin!!! Alone!!! I’m a fucking BAD ASS!!!! And she didn’t even offer me a ride!!! “We would offer you a ride but our back seat is full!” “I’ll sit on the floor.” “Hahahhahaha! Have a good day!” 


It sucks cause a couple cars have slowed down and judged me Unworthy of a hitch. Man. I’m soooooooo glad this is not my last day of my thru hike. This would be a SOUR ending. 


(Time jump)


Man. After a NINETY minute road walk, I finally got a partial hitch. Ended up just jumping in a pay-shuttle cause they had space and I just wanna be out of this park. I mean. It’s lovely here. But I kinda need a shower. Ended up being a near 16 mile day but, you know, only the 4.8 to the summit counted.","
