JoMaMa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647386,"After our 3 month stop for winter.. March 1st finally arrived. We buttoned up the house, the bee’s, emptied the fridge and hopefully mouse proofed the house! Our first flight was 6:00 am, then a layover- another flight and we were dropped off at the trail at 2:30 in the afternoon. Hiked in a quick 3 miles and set up to a glorious sunset.","North Granby, CT

JoMaMa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647411,"Days 2,3 and 4 were just splendid.  The trees are bare so the views are different from our Fall hike out here. We traveled to Max Patch in lovely 55 degree weather. I’ve heard so much about this area I was happy to see it with my own eyes. My favorite part was when we came across a group of high schoolers.. only to realize their leader was Jennifer Pharr Davis.  If you have never heard of this Wonder Woman, you must look her up.  She was so unassuming and gracious when I asked her if she had ever hiked the AT.  I was embarrassed to ask her if she was Jennifer. Her answer to my question was “well.. maybe.. why do you ask?” That’s when I knew.  She even posed for a picture with us. The next great happening was walking into Hot Springs. We picked up our first resupply box, I had a delicious all natural smoothie and then we had lunch at a great pub before climbing out of the town and back into the woods.","Max Patch and Hot Sorings

JoMaMa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647385,"We started back on our adventure on March 1st, 2022. The first 5 days were glorious! Our issues were just reacclimatizing to our ‘routines’.  Then we had our normal rain days… and now.. the snow and zero degree nights. We came out off the trail at Sam’s Gap in TN.
We are staying at the Nature’s Inn Hostel and Cabins. When we got here it was 61 degrees .. sunny .. with expectations of the temp dropping to single digits. Snow was coming..and come it did. We woke on Saturday to near whiteout winds, temps in the teens and 4+ Inches of snow. Great decision.","

JoMaMa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647821,"Monday- March 14…We left our storm hideout (Nature’s Inn) and ventured outdoors into the bright sunshine. As the van pulled into our drop off point at Sams Gap we immediately recognized Fresh Ground’s van.  He is a trail angel that feeds hundreds of hikers each year. A blessed sight to behold during a long hike. He is supported by donations from hikers, friends of hikers and families, but takes no donations from active thru hikers. We had already eaten and were trail ready, so we stopped for a quick chat and headed into the woods. We had a tough day, not because of the miles or the temperature, but because of the different types of snow, slush and mud on the trail. Slippery snow and icy rocks make for slow hiking, but when you step into snow and end up in 2 inches of slushy water…. Ugh. Needless to say my boots and socks were drenched. Our destination for this Wed morning is to be at a Unaka Springs Road at 10 am.  Dodger’s wife is picking us up and bringing us to Irwin, TN.  She’s packing a picnic lunch, delivering our resupply boxes and visiting for a while.","Nature’s Inn and Hostel

JoMaMa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647834,"Sat March 19th Hiking up Roan Mountain
Saturday started out with a 5 mile ‘slack pack’ and then a 5 mile - full pack hike up to the highest shelter in the AT - the Roan High Knob Shelter.  The shelter is located at an elevation of 6,270 ft. 
So first let me explain how we ‘slack packed’.  We spent the night in the home of CeCe and Gadget. Two very well known hostel folks.  CeCe’s place is called Greasy Creek Friendly.  On Saturday morning, after hearing our plans to tackle 10.5 miles and an incline of 2,500 feet, CeCe offered us a ‘slack pack’ deal.  She would drop us off 5 miles up the trail- at Hughes Gap (with small day packs), we would then walk back to her house.  She would then drive us back to Hughes Gap - with our full packs, and off we would go up the steep incline to Roan Knob Shelter. 
That worked great! But, it did not make that afternoon hike any easier.  We seemed like we were climbing forever.I was never so happy to see a shelter - but at that altitude it got darn cold quickly.  The shelter actually has a door that closes- but even with it closed- the temp was in the 30’s and dropping. Snow was expected overnight and the ground floor of the shelter was not inviting.  We all crawled up a ladder and through the hatch to the attic. Once we had dinner we fell fast asleep - listening to the winds howl.  Around 2 AM, I awoke to wet spray on my face - in actuality- it was snow! My sleeping bag was covered, as was our gear. The snow was blowing in the roof vents and any gaps in the boards.  By morning the temps were in the low 20’s.  We packed up as fast as our frozen hands and feet would allow and climbed out of the attic and into a crystalline wonderland. Remember how I explained after the previous storm about FreshGround the trail Magic guy? Well, after 1 1/2 miles of frozen footsteps we came down to a sheltered gap - and there he was doing his magic.  I declare,  I had real tears of joy in my eyes as I saw him.  He warmed us up with a heater, chairs, hot coffee and a hot breakfast.  A true miracle.","

JoMaMa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648444,"On Friday April 1st we walked out of Damascus and right up out of the lovely valley.  Our next exciting endeavor is to walk into the Grayson Highlands State Park.  To get there we had to spend Saturday hiking up and over Buzzard Rock.  Amazing 360 views. The climb was long and windy- but spending time chatting with other hikers was worth it.  We had to scramble for water and a less than perfect spot to bed down for the night.  Sunday, April 3rd we climbed over the second highest mountain in VA, Whitetop at 5,520 feet. Blustery winds pushed us along the trail.  Once up and over we were nearer to our goal - the wild ponies!  We certainly were not disappointed. 
When Grit got to the Wise Shelter, the Mount Roger’s ATC volunteers we moving a privy.  It didn’t take long for Grit to jump right in and give them a hand.  So what was going to be a quick stop for us, ended up being an end point of our day.  There is no tenting allowed on the state property, but less than a qtr mile away we are currently bedded down above a cascading stream. Dreaming of our next big event.","
