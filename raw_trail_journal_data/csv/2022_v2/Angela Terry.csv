Angela Terry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/318739,"My first entry for my journal. I plan to thru-hike in 2012 with my sister. Many ask why? I have kids. I am not in the just-out-of-college, or no-kids-at-home people. I am a stay-at-home-mom. I am not the typical hiker. However, I do know, ever since I saw it in Backpacker Magazine it has called to me. It is something I want to do, something I need to do. Something I want to say - ""Hey I did that!""",,View Entry,,0
Angela Terry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/319216,"Getting prepped for our trip to Yosemite. Got all the packs for the kids and even some great light weight summer bags. I wish my tent was a bit lighter but that is ok, I will survive the three days. Planning out the meals and shopping for food this weekend. Can't wait for the hiking - can wait for the bears. (my fear)",,View Entry,,0
Angela Terry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/319717,Finished the last purchases for our camping/backpacking this next week. Real excited. The kids can't wait either. Hoping the sleeping bags are warm enough there is still snow going up to Clouds Rest. Still chilly. Hoping to keep us all warm!,,View Entry,"Jul 10, Sat",0
Angela Terry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/321279,"This years family hiking trip was to Yosemite NP. We started at the trail head to Cathedral Lakes. It started out uphill. It was slow going with the kids. Had lunch at the junction to the lower cathedral lake. Crackers, tuna fish, and fruit snacks. Went past upper cathedral lake - one of our most favorite places we saw. We went through some fields over ridges. After about 8 miles we hit a meadow area by the Sunrise High Sierra Camp. It was the worst part of the trip. The mosquitoes were so bad you could heat them in swarms. We were attacked. We tried to get through as fast as we could. We were swatting everywhere. Deet did no good, they just were persistent. The kids were crying, and I was close to it. We had to push on to another location. We went up and over the ridge to above the Upper Sunrise Lake. We set up camp, cooked dinner and took care of the bear canisters. We thought we had gotten away from the mosquitoes, but they were still in full force. We went to our tents a little early to get away from the little biters.",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Tue",0
Angela Terry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/321281,"Didn't get much sleep. I worry too much about bears, so up early I was. Got breakfast ready and the kids up and moving. The mosquitoes were out in full force again. If we were moving around they wouldn't bug us too much so breakfast was eaten while walking around the campsite. Enjoyed packing up the kids, inside the tent was nice away from the mosquitoes. Got water filtered and off for the day. We slowly made our way across rivers and over ridges. Got to the junction where 1/2 the group went towards Clouds Rest the other 1/2 (kids and couple of adults) caught a trail back over to the John Muir trail. Lunch was on the trail, same stuff as yesterday. The kids have really learned and enjoyed going potty outside. They like that they can go just about anywhere. I was worried about the girls, but after a couple of years of this -- they are doing good. We met up with the group at the junction below Clouds Rest and the John Muir trail, .5 miles from the Half Dome trail. Super tired more physically tired from one of the twins have foot problems today. Got settled, water filtered. We had a deer come right into camp and about an hour later a bear took the same trail. He looked at us and then just strolled off. He was so close - I have now realized that they just want food they could care less about us. People are not food to them.We cooked dinner played some cards, cleaned up and put the bear canisters away. The kids enjoyed just hanging out playing around the campfire. I am a little worried about foot problem from my kid.",,View Entry,"Jul 14, Wed",0
Angela Terry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/321282,"Got up at 5:20 am with my sister and nephew to summit Half Dome. We were 2.5 miles away from the top. Had a great hike up. The cables were empty all the way to the top. Got up just a little after sunrise. It was great on top. Loved it! Headed down and met up with the group about 9:30 back at the campsite to hike out. It was slow going down the trail. It was a hot and crowded trail. After 2 days of hiking the kids were slow going down the granite steps. When I thought the steps would end more would come. I have never done the Mist Trail/Half Dome trail before, but those steps were killer with the packs on and all the people. It was hard to get by people with the pack and holding onto my youngest hand to help him down. I enjoyed the trail the days before with very little people and the trail to ourselves. This day we had so many people trying to hike, some were not very nice. It was nice to get down to the bottom and hop the shuttle to the campsite.After a day of stairs and rocks going down my thighs and calves are super sore. I know it is going to take a couple of days to get over it. Hubby took they child with foot problems today. He was about 2 hours behind us. Looks like I will need to have the dr check out her feet. Maybe no arches.So glad that I sumitted Half Dome. It is my first and I was so excited, it was an awesome experience.",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Thu",0
Angela Terry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/366310,"Due to family commitments, I must postpone my hike. As much as is pains me, as much as I want to do this so bad, I know I must not be selfish and take care of my obligations. When am I able to fulfill my dream? I don't know, however I will. I will.","
