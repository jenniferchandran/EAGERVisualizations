christopher keene,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646801,I really appreciate all the positive vibes from friends and family. Most of them know how much I have wanted to hike the AT. In 2003 my cousin Bob and his wife Lesly aka just ducky and soft serve thru hiked the trail. With there encouragement and advice my daughter Ally and I started hiking in the white mountains.we had a lot of fun and I even got my buddy Kevin to start hiking. Over the years since then I lived vicariously through this website. Dreaming of getting my chance to experience this awesome wilderness trail extending nearly 2200 miles from in my case Georgia to Maine as a north bound thru hiker. There are so many people I would like to mention but there isn’t enough room here for that. But my Daughter Ally my mom and dad my sister Jodie and her husband Scott and there daughter Taylor my girlfriend Kerri and her daughters especially bryel all deserve my thanks. I hope I can do it!                  Love Chris ,,View Entry,"Feb 09, Wed",0
christopher keene,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646961,I’m just trying to do last minute stuff.I wish I could just get on with it already! Took are dog Ruby for a nice mud fest on some trails nearby. I have put hundreds of miles on them and the dog is still a pup and I stopped talking her there during most of the winter because of lots of snow. We had a lot of fun and it’s was nice to carry a bottle of water and a little bowl in my pocket. No pack ect for work out. The dog is a amazing. She is half basset half beagle. Also in my last post I neglected to mention my daughters boyfriend Mikey who is and has been very supportive of my hike. And I also did not mention now that I think about it that my lifelong friend James “tongo” power and his wife MaryAnn have also been very excited and supportive of “the hike” too. ,,View Entry,"Feb 19, Sat",0
christopher keene,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647221,so I arrived yesterday and by the time I got finished registering at the ranger station I couldn’t keep my freakin eyes open. I was tired and it was far to late to start the approach trail to springer mountain where the AT s as actual starts. So it’s the seventh early in the morning and I’m getting ready to go do the approach trail. ,,View Entry,"Mar 07, Mon",0
christopher keene,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647263,"So I finally started the approach trail. With rain in the forecast I made my way first through the arch at the beginning of the trail. So I started walking on the trail and realized it took me right by the shelter I stayed at. I could see the other people outside that were there with me. They didn’t notice me and I just moved on. Soon enough I arrived at the craziest thing I’ve ever been scared of. Its a waterfall that is actually three times higher than Niagara Falls. So tourist can enjoy the views they built stairs, I think seven hundred fifty of them, and with my full pack on it was a glorious battle. At the top I took a quick break and started the actual approach trail.   the trail was really nice and I enjoyed just being out a trail after resting my legs for a couple of weeks before this day. I came upon at one point to young guys sitting on a log or rock having a break so stopped chatted with them for a while they were from Baltimore and very nice guys. I moved on ultimately heading for the last spot I could camp before actually starting the trail. It’s called rock gap shelter and I just wanted to get there and get ready for the next day to summit springer and start making miles the approach doesn’t count.  So I’m making great time and I stop to get my first water from a stream. By the time I’m done I’ve met three other guys starting the trail. But best part is along come the brothers from Baltimore and the three of us hike the rest of the way to the shelter where we all eat and decide where gonna go for the summit today so with the threat of rain ever present we reach the summit just as it’s getting ready to letter rip! We get the pictures and we start hauling ass. Well we have had on and off showers leading up to this so when this rain started we just kept going but eventually the rain started to fire hose.    we all regret not having stopped to put on our rain gear and when we got to stover creek shelter we where drenched!! I could go on but there will be more to come for mileage today it will only reflect the actual Appalachian trail miles.","Amacalola falls

christopher keene,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647309,Today was a day to set up my next few moves by only going a few miles it got me back in order with the next few hard stops and there was rain on the horizon. So I went to Hawk mountain shelter and pitched my tent.  After pitching the tent and eating it started to rain. The next day can be a lot of extra work but I love a good rain storm. It rained and there was thunder and lightning too. ,"Stover creek shelter

christopher keene,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647311,biggest day yet had a nice hike. Stopped at gooch gap shelter to have lunch.there were a few people there taking the day off after the rain storm I really didn’t paint it as bad as it was. Some of those guys were a little shell shocked I think. After eating it was back at it to woody gap tent site. The trail seemed to go on and on and I just finished putting up my tent before dark and because it was very windy I cooked in the vestibule of my tent. ,"Hawk mountain shelter

christopher keene,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/647312,today was a pretty nice hike the objective here was to go neels gap and resupply shower ect and I was invited to share a cabin with a few other hikers. To get there was a pretty respectable hike with numerous minor mountains and Blood mountain at 4442ft Blood mountain is the highest point on the Appalachian trail in Georgia. I got into neels gap at about three. What cool place a real hiker town. I’m sitting relaxing now tomorrow I will do laundry and resupply. ,"Woody gap tent site
