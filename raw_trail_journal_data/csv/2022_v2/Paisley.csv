Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648010,"The AT is hilly.  The elevation is pretty manageable, unlike the CT, but the amount of gain and loss is huge and unlike western trail, the trails in the east tend to just go straight up the hill without any switchbacks to ease the climb.  As I stated at the beginning of my CT journal, Michigan does not have much in the way of mountains.  We have some beautiful escarpments (Porcupine Mountains) and some really hard to climb dunes all along the shore of Lake Michigan, but not much in the way of mountains. That means it is back to the stairs to train.  Working up to 100 flights of steps in the picture (Qty = 24) as a means of developing climbing leg muscles and CV fitness.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Tue",0
Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648250,"April 1st was my last day of work ending a 34 year career. It is so strange to think that tomorrow, I do not have to go to work, which also means that I will not see any of my work friends. Most of my work friends are following this journal, so to them, I would just like to say thank you and I miss you all already. 
Training on the stairs continues. I did 80 flights on Saturday and 60 flights today (Sunday). I am also planning to hike most of the Waterloo Pinckney trail as a second shake down hike. My first shakedown was the Manistee River Trail a couple weekends ago.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Sun",0
Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648777,"Last week I did a shake down hike doing a short out and back on a section of the North Country Trail (NCT).  I got a late start on Tuesday but still hiked in 8 miles. Wednesday was a rainy morning. It rained pretty steady until about 1:00 in the afternoon. Q: What do hikers do when it rains?  A: GET WET!  Unfortunately so did my sleeping bag. That is not allowed. Turns out the bag that I was using as my dry bag, well, leaked. That's why it is always good to do a shake down in bad weather. I am grateful for the lesson. I will have to add a little weight to have a more reliable dry bag. Beats sleeping in a wet bag. I still walked 16 flat miles in spite of the rain. It was supposed to be colder Thursday night so I decided that the best course was to hike the 23 flat miles back to my van, so that is what I did. My legs were a little tight when I got out of the van after a 3 hour drive home, but I was not as sore as I thought 23 miles would make me, so my training is paying off. Oh, btw I did make my 100 flight goal. 
Repacking and getting ready for the trip to Georgia. I start walking North on Monday the 18th. Excited and scared, at the same time.",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Wed",0
Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649073,"This is my first ever android phone so I figured that I had better test the alarm feature before expecting it to awaken me in time for my 4:00 am ride to the airport. My first several tries were failures, so I started getting scared. I figured out that you have to use the screen saver, but I went to sleep thinking the alarm might not work and I would miss my plane. That made for a fitful night of sleep because I kept checking the time. My alarm did work and I made it through security with plenty of time. Uneventful flight, a little trouble finding the Uber driver, I arrived at Amicalola Falls at 11:00 am. Quick presentation on how to through hike and I was on the trail at 11:45. It was a light drizzle at first, then the fog moved in making the mountain trail look very spooky. Kept thinking I was hearing dueling banjos, but it was just my imagination. I stopped at Black Gap Shelter and set my tent on a pad near the shelter. I could have pushed further, but it is wise to leave fuel in the tank for tomorrow. Tomorrow, it about 2 miles of uphill I will reach the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.","Amicalola Falls State Park, Georgia

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649542,"The highlights of today's 9.6 mile hike were Springer Mountain and Long Creek Falls. I started out in the morning with just a thin 1/4 zip over my usual thin wool short sleeve. Start bold and cold. It was a climb up to Springer and I was just barely able to keep warm. Once I reached the top of Springer I had to layer up immediately. I added my rain coat and my glove. It was not raining, I just needed the rain coat to cut the wind. I took a few pictures, signed the log book and headed north. About lunch time I reached Long Creek Falls. I decided to eat my lunch there. Long Creek Falls are very beautiful. I made it to Hawk Mountain Shelter in the early afternoon. Again, feeling good enough to go further, but decided to leave some in the tank.","Black Creek Gap

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649544,"Today was a test. Was my body ready for a longer day?  My original plan had me stopping at Gooch Gap, but that was only 7.7 miles from Hawk Mountain. I decided to give it a go. Glad that I did because I reached Gooch Gap a little after noon, so it would have been a long day sitting around in camp. I am pleased to report that all systems are go after today's 15.8 mile day.  
Today's hike had many good views. The best one was big cedar ledges. It is a huge rock which prevents the trees from blocking a huge panoramic view of the mountains to the south east. I spent a little time there just taking it in. Tomorrow I will reach Neels Gap, which will be a quick resupply and maybe a battery charge. Neels Gap is the first major road crossing so it is also the place where a large number of hikers will end their hike. They have a tree there with 100s of pairs of shoes hanging to symbolize the hiker that choose not to hike any further. I am pretty sure my shoes will not be among them. Tomorrow also starts with a 1500 foot climb in the first 5 miles. Glad my pack is a little lighter.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649545,"Today was a big day. Lots of climb and decent, Blood Mountain, and Neel Gap resupply.  The start of the day was the climb up Blood Mountain. Shortly after starting, I walked up into a cloud. Light precipitation with a little hail and now views. Sometimes the fog was so dense, it was difficult to make out the trail. Getting to the top was anticlimactic, so I stayed for a short time and then headed back down the other side. At the bottom of the decent was Neels Gap. At Neels Gap there is an outfitter. The trail literally goes through the building that the outfitter uses. I stopped to grab a couple days of food, just to be safe and I also charged my battery bank to 3/4 charge. The way my new Garmin and this phone are performing that should be plenty. The Garmin only got down to 71% after three days of hiking. Thanks to the people I used to work with for that. My old one needed to be charged every other day. After resupply it was another climb and a gentle fall then another steep climb. Pushed my lungs to the limit. I found a undeveloped site at mile 39.1 after a 15.1 day. Holding up pretty well. Waiting for the sun to set over my tent.","Lance Creek Restoration Area

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649546,"Today was a rough day. Almost as soon as I hit the trail I started experiencing stomach cramps. My thinking that it is one of two things, either I am dehydrated or it is Norovirus. Hoping it is the dehydration. I walked along at just a little short of my normal pace, I hardly took any pictures, I kept a watch for water on the trail so that I could keep water flowing into me. I feel somewhat better now, so I am hopeful. I am 19.1 miles from Dicks Creek Gap and I am planning to get a shower, laundry and resupply. I hope to make it about 15 miles tomorrow so that I can get to town early.","Dispersed Site at Mile 39.1

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649547,"Today was the day that I acted like a total newbie. My normal breakfast procedure is to put water on my oatmeal but wait about an hour or so after I start hiking to eat it. That way, no waiting for the oatmeal to cook and after an hour I am hungry and ready for a break. So that's what I did, but I made two newbie mistakes. I needed a little water to go with my oatmeal. My first mistake was not putting the water bottle back in the sleeve on my pack. The second was not checking back after I walked away for anything I left. You guessed it I left one of my two water bottles at my breakfast spot. By the time I discover my mistake(s) it was too late to go back. I am hitting town tomorrow so I can just buy another 1 liter bottle of smart water since that is what I use as a water bottle. Nothing fancy. The walk today had a lot of climbing. My fellow hikers are  complaining about the climbs. It has been tough, but that is what you signed up for. It would be a completely different trail if it was all flat and they would have to change the name. I am feeling good. The dehydration has passed and my feet and legs are doing pretty well. The water here is a good 1/2 mile down a old forest service road. I know that because I have already made the trek. Fortunately I brought a 2 liter water bag as a backup. All the hikers that have come through have said that they are going to push on to get water and stay at the shelter. That's fine with me. After last night symphony of snoring at Blue Mountain, a quiet night would be nice.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649552,"Today was this trips real town resupply. My wife helped my reserve a cabin at the Around the Bend Hostel.  I only had a short 5.5 mile walk to get to Dicks Creek Gap, and then the hostel was only 0.6 miles west in 76. I arrived there early, before my cabin was ready, but they gave me a towel so I could get my shower. They have loner clothes, which I put on after the shower then I sorted through my pack to get out everything that needed washed. I did my laundry, then at 2:30 the hostel dropped us off in town. We had until 5:15 to do whatever we needed and at 5:15 they picked us up in front of the grocery store. I am resupplied for 4 days on the trail. The next resupply is 40.2 miles up the trail, so at my current pace that should be plenty.  Only thing is that tomorrow is a tough climbing day and I have a heavy pack. 
Strangely enough, I did not feel well this morning again. I think it was dehydration again. I have never reacted this way before. I have been forcing water all day and I am feeling fine now. Just need to keep an eye on what is happening with my body.","Addis Gap
",Dicks Creek Gap,"Apr 24, Sun",5.50
Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649710,"I woke up early this morning in my little cabin. The first shuttle was to leave at 8:00 am and there was not much that needed to be done before getting on it. I was not sure how good I was feeling so I resolved to force down a liter of water while I was waiting. It was a quick .6 mile ride to the trailhead. When I got there I was still not sure how I was feeling, but once I started to walk, my muscles synced up and I found that I was burning through the miles. I have found that I need to be more careful with water to make sure that I keep drinking it without conserving it, and make sure that I keep one bottle at least half full. On the CT the water sources were fewer and further in-between, so when I saw one, no decision needed, better top off. On the AT the sources are much more frequent, so you get used to walking past them and when acknowledge the source you have to determine if you should top off or is there another source in a 1/4 Mile?  I just need to be more methodical about how I make the decision to walk by or stop.The big news for the day is that I am no longer in Georgia, I am in North Carolina. I don't think that I have ever hiked across a state line before. I have biked across a state line a few times, but never hiked. Today was a 16.5 mile day with a great deal of climbing. Feeling pretty good. The hills still get me breathing hard, but I suspect that they always will. My feet are still in top notch condition, and I hear  no complaints from my knees or hips. I keep stretching my calves to keep my heels from hurting and that is working. Thinking I'll do another long day tomorrow.","Dicks Creek Gap

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649991,"Today was a rain day. The last forcast I saw called for rain most of the day. I woke up early and started tearing down camp before dawn because I wanted to pack dry and I did not know when the rain would start. I was hiking by about 6:30 in the morning. The rain held off until about 11:00 and then it never rained all that hard. I have an umbrella and a hands free harness that attaches it to my shoulder strap. This kept me mostly dry without the over heat of a rain jacket. It worked pretty well. It is just a little difficult to see going up hill because the umbrella blocks your vision very far up the hill. None the less, I think it about the best system for a warm rain. The rain stopped and restarted a few times until at about 3:00 pm the sun started to peek through the clouds.  Today is also the day that I passed the 100 AT trail mile mark.  I am now camped at Rock Gap Shelter which sits at mile 105.6. That means I turned in 19.9 miles today. Longest day for the trip, but actually most of the hiking was pretty easy.  The exception is the climb up Albert Mountain (mile 100).  That was a very steep rock scramble for a good portion of the climb. The view at the top was worth it. Some of the people that are at this shelter lost their food to a bear or bears. Apparently, the bears are now able to figure out a way to get around the PTC hang. Guess I will keep lugging my bear canister around. The thing weighs 2.5 lbs empty, but they are pretty infallible (knock on wood).","Dispersed Site at Mile 85.7

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649989,"It was a quick easy walk to Winding Stair Gap from Rock Gap. I was there with enough time to meet the shuttle to Franklin. The driver dropped me at Walmart and in a half hour my bear canister was completely full. I was waiting for the next bus to take me down town for some town food when there came a shout from a pickup truck ""you need a ride down town?"" Perfect. I had to ride in the back, but he asked me what I was looking for, I said maybe breakfast. He said, "" I'll drop you at 828"". I had a nice Greek omelet and a big ice tea. Highly recommended. Then I went to Outdoor 76 to charge my phone and catch the bus. The noon bus arrived and I was not fully charged, so I had to wait until the 3:00 bus. We got to the trail a little before 4 so I screamed up the hill 4 miles to be at the Siler Bald Shelter a little after 5.

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649994,"Today was the first hot day that I have experienced. A good portion of the day was down hill, but there was some really tough climbs. The hardest climb was at the end of the day when it was hot and my legs were tired. I wanted to go further, but today total will have to be 17.9 miles. 
The interesting thing about today is that I did not encounter as many people I normally do. I was the first out of camp (that is typical) and then I passed four people early on. After that I did not see another hiker until I arrived at the shelter. 
Tomorrow is the day that I reach the Nantahala Outdoor Center. I have to get and print my permit for the Smokies. I also want to get a little cell phone charge and maybe some town food. But I also want to get in a long day, so we will see what happens.","Siler Bald Campsite
",Wesser Bald Shelter,"Apr 28, Thu",17.90
Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649995,"Today was only 16.4 miles, but the distance only tells part of the story. When I was at Wesser Bald I was up on a high ridge at an elevation of 4075 feet. I had to drop down to the river below to follow the trail through the Nantahala Outdoor Center which is at 1727 feet, then back up over the ridge on the other side of the NOC, which is over 5000 feet high. In total that meant that I decended 4249 feet and climbed 4705 feet. That is a pretty big day no matter the milage. 
I stopped at the NOC for breakfast and eat with some of the faster people from the Blue Mountain Shelter. Nice people. I am camped with a few of them now. I also obtained and printed my Smokey Mountains permit, so I am set to enter the park in a few days. 
I am now only about 18 miles from Fontana Damn, and the terrain looks easy, so I might push to be there tomorrow. Once there I have to resupply, do laundry an get a shower. Looks like a full day tomorrow.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/649996,"Today was a rough day. The first part of the day was not too bad. The climb out of Stecoah Gap was a little brutal, but once completed the terrain was fairly mild by AT standards. I reached Cable Gap Shelter at about 2:00 so there was really no reason to walk the last 6.5 miles into Fontana. I assumed that I could shower resupply and get my laundry done before heading into the Smokies. I was wrong. No laundry. I absolutely have to have clean clothes before the Smokies. Additionally, the steep walk down from the ridge to the dam did a bit of a number on my back. The two factors combined had me searching for a hotel option so I could do a proper zero. With a ton of help from my wife I found a hotel in a nearby city that has a vacancy and a shuttle ride to get there and back. Even being on the trail end of the herd, resources in trail towns are stretched to the limit. Today's hike was 18.2 miles. Tomorrow's will be zero.","Locust Cove Gap

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650052,"It kept threatening rain in the morning, so, not wanting to pack a wet tent, I got up just after sunrise and packed up my site. I slept remarkably well considering I was on a concrete slab with tents all around. There was just enough wind noise to drown out the people noises (shuffling, snoring, um wind breaking). My Hotel room would not be available until 3:00 pm so I asked the shuttle driver to pick me up at 1:00. When I got to the hotel I checked and my room was not available, but the desk attendant allowed me to stash my pack behind the desk so I wouldn't have to carry it around town. I went for lunch. Not a lot open in this little town on Sunday. The Mexican place was lined up, so Wendy's it was. After lunch I bought enough food for 6 days and then returned to the hotel to await my room.
Once in my room I sorted my laundry. There was a laundromat across the street from the hotel. I had difficulty making a dryer work because they kept eating my quarters, but eventually I had a small stack of clean clothes. Then back to the hotel to change and out for town food.
My shuttle picks me up at 9:30, so I can finish repacking my food tomorrow morning. That's how a resupply works.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650549,"I can't remember what I was frightened of. The climb, the terrain, the rules, perhaps a little of everything. I was terrified of the Smokies, but so far my fear is irrational. Most of the people that I have met along the way are here at this shelter. The climb was tough, but I've done worse in the last few days. The last time I backpacked here it was early spring and it was dark, cold and rainy, as you would expect, but I think that memory stirred an irrational fear of the Smokies. 
Anyway, I am here and everything is fine. I did quite well on the climb and I am modifying my approach to descending to protect my low back and that seems to be working. My friends that I thought were up ahead by at least a day are actually here at this shelter, so everything feels almost like home, except without my beautiful wife and home.

Looking at the numbers (5584 foot of climbing over 19.5 miles) it was a hard day, but the climbs were mostly short so it did not feel as hard as yesterday's 12 miles. It was really just a whole lot of walking (48,853 steps) with no major landmarks passed. 
Tomorrow is Clingman's Dome. This is the most popular attraction in the Smokies for normal visitors to the park, but it is also the highest point on the Appalachian Trail.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650551,"Today was the day we summited Clingman's Dome. On the way up, I missed a turn. I did not realize the mistake until 1/2 mile down the wrong trail I was met by hikers that I knew that had made the same mistake. The fact that I was going down should have been enough of a clue to make me realize my mistake. 
I was feeling a little off in the morning. I had mild stomach cramps again which I am now realizing means that I did not hydrate well the previous day. Yesterday was cloudy and windy. That combination made it so I did not get thirsty, so I did not drink enough water. I am also thinking about adding some sport additive, like Mio into my next resupply. 
After Clingman's it is a 10 mile walk to Newfound Gap. I have driven it a few times, so it seemed to take forever on foot. 
Once at Newfound Gap, that AT leaves the gap by the same trail you take if you want to hike up to Charlie's Bunions. I have made that hike a couple times, so it was a trip down memory lane for me. I stopped short of the bunions at the Icewater Spring Shelter. 
Today's hike was only 13.6 miles, but the next shelter was another 7.4 miles. With the rough start this morning and the Clingman's climb, I did not think I could do it. Strangely enough most of the people I have been hiking with, choose not to try it either.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

The grade of the trail was nice and constant, meaning the trail was really nicely layed out. I expect that once I leave the park, the grades will be more influenced by who owns the land and less hiker comfort. There were some very pretty views today, so I took more pictures then I have in past days. I was also feeling better today than I was yesterday and the weather was much nicer. I am getting to the end of the Smokey's.

Still unsure what I should do I consulted my friends.  It was pointed out that there was good cell service there under the highway and perhaps the best thing to do was to make a video call.  Great Idea, as soon as I saw her face I knew that I had to go home.  Just as I hung up the call, the Standing Bear Shuttle pulled up next to me an asked if I wanted a ride to the Hostel.  I climbed in and spoke to the hostel owner about my situation.  She said she could help with a ride to which ever airport worked best.  She said to go up on the porch and figure out the logistics and she would help however she could.  I got on the hostel wifi and started searching flights.  Soon I had a flight from Knoxville to home and a Hotel in Knoxville to get cleaned up for the trip.  As it happened, there was section hiker there who was ending his trip and he had arranged a ride to Knoxville leaving in an hour.  We split the shuttle fee and I was at the hotel.  I had some difficulty getting my laundry done and finding a box so that I could put my trekking poles, knives and tent stakes in with the checked baggage, but I got all that and a shower and dinner accomplished by late evening.So I am off the Trail for now.  I am not just a hiker, I am also a husband a father and a son.  First things first.","Cosby Knob Shelter

It should take me until about mid October. 865 miles. Things are back to normal at home and my daughter's Indian wedding is done. After almost three months off, I can finally get back on the trail. I did a couple gear changes to lighten my pack a little and I tried to stay in shape, but I would not say that I have trail legs, so my days will be short at first.

Visiting John was such a blast. Hard pressed to find a guy nicer than John. We toured all around Annapolis, drove over the Bay Bridge and took a walk to check out the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.

Today started out with a down pour. I packed up under the shelter as much as possible, made  and ate my oatmeal before hitting the trail, and fixed my umbrella to my left shoulder strap so I could use it hands free. Love my umbrella, keeps you mostly dry without overheating you. I passed a few people that looked pretty hot and tired dressed in full rain gear. I thought that they might attempt to steal my umbrella. There eyes were showing pure lust. Fortunately nobody attempted the theft. 
Today I walked 20 miles even to a campsite beside Falls Creek. I was pretty tired on the last up hill, but I made it and since the rain let up at about 10:00 am, and the grades were easy, I figured to make hay while the sun shines, or didn't.

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656602,"Today I walked 17 miles from Falls Creek to Annapolis Rocks. I thought that I could do more, but the approach to High Rocks was very difficult. It was just a series of jagged boulders of all different sizes from 8"" to 3 foot, stacked up on a 45 degree incline hill. If that was not difficult enough, any ground that was not covered in rock has slippery roots blocking access to good footing. This stretch was long and I would be surprised if my speed was much over 0.5 miles per hour. There were several other stretches that were the same only flat. When ever the path was smooth I hiked fast (~3 miles per hour) but I could not make up the time so at 4 pm I was ready to call it a day. 
Looks like I will have a few days of good weather. When I got camp set up I put everything that was the slightest bit damp in the sun to dry. Thinking of making my way up to the outcropping to get some sunset pictures.","Falls Creek Campsite

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656604,"The saying goes ""the early bird gets the worm"" but hikers know that ""the early hiker gets the cob webs"". Because I am not in the herd (large group of hikers) I get a lot of cob webs. It got me thinking of the plight of the trail spider. The trail spider sees all his friends, the just off trail spiders make these perfect pie spirals and the trail spider sets out to accomplish the same. The trail spider gets one or two strands stretched across the trail then along comes the early hiker who destroys the trail spider's work. Trail spider has to start over. Today I was hiking along at a break neck pace when the sun caught a beautiful, almost complete web. The trail spider was near the middle almost finished with the inside spiral strands. I stopped in my tracks, tried to photograph it, then tried to figure out if I could get down the trail without destroying the trail spider's work. I thought I could duck under but was horrified when I tried because there was a strand that I did not see, and all the poor trail spider's work was destroyed in an instant. Sorry trail spider. Today I hiked 18.3 miles from Annapolis Rocks to the Ed Garvey Shelter. Ed wrote a book about the trail and served as president of the Potomac AT Conservancy. This is a really nice shelter. The walk today was less rocky, so I made better time. I could have kept walking, but I am 6.3 miles outside Harper's Ferry, and I don't want to get a Hotel. My daughter, Emily, in going to pick me up however far South I get by Saturday afternoon. She is going to take me back to her place, let me crash there, and help me resupply. It will be nice to see her. Tomorrow I hike into Harper's Ferry for a stop at the AT Conservancy and maybe some town food.","Annapolis Rocks

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656738,"Today I hiked 15.9 miles from the Ed Garvey shelter the David Lesser shelter. So for the 5 days that I have logged 88.3 miles. Not too shabby for coming off the couch. Still feeling good.Today's walk started with a steep decent into Harper's Ferry. Once I got down to river level, the AT shares foot bed with the C&O Tow Path for about 3 miles. I road the C&O with some friends many years back, but I remembered some of the land marks. It was fun to be on that stretch of trail again approaching from a completely different direction. Harper's Ferry was pretty interesting. I need to return again when I have more time. There is tons of Civil War stuff there. I stopped at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. They were nice, took my picture for the website, let me charge my phone, and watched my pack while I went to the bakery for a cinnamon roll. After leaving Harper's Ferry, it is a pretty good climb back up into the mountains. Somehow I got off path and it took me about a mile to realize I was following a blue blaze trail. Can't blame the trail maintenance, it was pretty well marked. I gust spaced out at the junction. Two more days until resupply!","Ed Garvey Shelter

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656742,"I knew the Roller Coaster was coming and I was aware that it was tough, but it does not really show up on the ""Far Out"" (formally ""Guthooks"") app that almost all, including me, AT trail hikers use, so when I planned a 20 mile day, I did not realize that it would traverse the Roller Coaster. I could have bailed out, but I would have had to be intentional about it because all the early camping alternative involved an up hill water carry. Toward the end of the day it became a matter of choosing between two evils: longer walk and more uphill with lighter pack or shorter walk uphill with a heavier pack. Because I was going to resupply the following day, my pack was very light, so I choose to hike longer. The worst thing about the Roller Coaster is that there is almost never a nice flat cruisy stretch that you can use to get your heart rate down. You climb up and as soon as you top out, you start down a rocky steep decent that requires all your concentration to prevent a face plant. Then when you finish the decent you cross a small stream and it is back to climbing. I is truly a rough section and unlike most of the trails so called rough sections, this one is deserving of the hype.I arrived at Rod Hollow Shelter after scaring four deer off the side trail, too tired to set up my tent. I ate my last home dehydrated spaghetti, which was delicious, and climbed onto my pad in the shelter exhausted. 21.2 miles with just short of 5000 feet of climb for my 6th day off the couch.","David Lesser Shelter

I had determined that Ashby Gap, where Highway 50 crosses the AT was a good place to meet. For me that was 3.6 miles south with a couple of moderate climbs. We had agreed to meet at noon, so I had time to sleep in. As soon as the sun came up and shined directly into the open side of the shelter, I was awake. I did a blue sponge bath out in the woods, packed up, and resolved to hike slowly so as not to work up a sweat. Yeah, right. I was soaked in sweat by the time I arrived at Ashby Gap. Emily picked me up promptly a little before noon, we grabbed a sandwich from Wendy's (drive through, still not showered) and when to her place to sort my laundry and get a good shower. Once I was clean and had clean clothes to wear, we went food shopping. After that we when to the local brew pub and walked around a little one the local rails to trails.

I figured an easy 9.3 miles to Manassas Gap was the order of the day, so not a big hurry. 25 yards into my walk, at the point where the trail to the parking lot connects with the AT proper, there was an elderly woman checking her phone to confirm she was on the right path. I asked, ""North Bound or South Bound"". She replied south and that she had just summited Katadyn just a couple days earlier and she was now bound for Springer Mountain to complete the trail. Later I found out she was 72. She kept up with me for a little while. I hope to be as fast as she is when I'm 72. The sky kept threatening rain, but rain never materialized. The walk to Manassas was uneventful. The shelter was pretty good only lacking a bear box, so I had to use the bear pole instead. No problem.","Ashby Gap

In the afternoon, it rain twice. Both times I was perfect in my umbrella deployment, but the second storm came down hard enough that my feet got soaked.  This would later come back to haunt me. I met several nice people at Gravel Springs. Everyone said the were tenting, so I said that I would take the shelter. Another super nice guy arrived later in the evening, coming to the shelter during the last heavy downpour of the evening, so of course, I shared the shelter with him.

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657152,"I woke up early in the shelter and had one major decision to make. Clean dry socks or wet dirty socks. When you put it that way it seems like a pretty easy decision, but I wanted to preserve those clean socks, so strangely enough, I chose to put on the wet one, thinking they would dry as I walked. They didn't. I think that the gaiters that I use to keep sticks and stones out of my shoes interfered with the wicking action.  By the end of my 17 mile walk to Byrd's Nest Shelter, my feet were masserated, and had hot spots that were threatening to turn to blisters. I should have stopped on the trail and dug out the dry socks, but instead I waited until I was done walking for the day.  Luckily, I had two types of antifungal cream and some antifungal talcum powder. I used both liberally on my feet an slepted in dry wool socks. In the morning, I could not believe the improvement. Today's walk went up to Mary's Rock was very challenging. Not only was it a steep long assent, it was also very rocky. It is so much harder to climb when the climb is rocky. You have to concentrate on every foot placement, and as you get tired it is easy to fall into the trap of taking smaller and smaller steps, thus lowering your efficiency. Tough climb even at the end of a shorter day.","Gravel Springs Hut

The weather was also nice, so it was a pretty nice day of hiking. I am sharing the shelter area (I am actually using my tent tonight) with a group of 7 teenagers from William and Mary. This is freshmen orientation for them. The in coming freshmen get to choose from several options, the most extreme of which is a three night backpacking trip on that AT.

I think part of it has to do with the scenery. Yesterday's hike was on the west side of a ridge that had many outcroppings which provided fantastic views.  Today's hike was pretty much all in the green tunnel, with only one good view that was late in the day. 
I can't change the scenery for any given day, but I can change my schedule. I was planning to do a 26 mile day tomorrow that would get me all the way to Calf Mountain Shelter, but my body is feeling fatigued.  If I stop at a camp store tomorrow, I can grab one more day of food thus allowing me to do the 26 mile day as two 13 mile days.

Not sure if there will be more of that to come, but it was not very welcome. Like I mentioned in yesterday's journal, today was to be a short, 13.3 mile day. That turned out to be a stroke of good luck because, it started raining at about 4:15.  When the rain came I was safely at the shelter, so it was no problem, but if this had been a 26 mile day as I was originally thinking, I would have been out in it. I have a 13 mile day tomorrow, then only 8 miles to the south end of the Shenandoah National Park and resupply in Waynesboro.

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657158,"Today's hike should have been 12.8 miles, but I decided, purposefully, to take the one mile side trail to Turk Mountain. I had the time and the legs, so I thought why not. It was okay, not great and there was a lot of climbing as the out and back trail first dropped to the valley floor, then back up to 2957 peak of the mountain. The view was not worth the effort, but I did it anyways. 
I am camped now at a shelter where there are 7 other people. It is like being in the bubble again. The reason this shelter is so popular is that for SOBOs it is the last shelter before Waynesboro and a nice comfortable 8 miles out of town to boot. For NOBO Shenandoah section hikers that get dropped off at the southern end of the Shenandoahs, it is the first place to stay and if you skip it it is 13 miles to the next shelter. 
No afternoon rainstorm. Let's hope that we have many more afternoons without rain. I almost got my running shorts dry. 
So, I've been on the trail for exactly 2 weeks since being dropped off at the mid point (Pine Grove Furnace) and I have covered 233.5 miles in those two weeks. That's an average of 16.6 per day. I am pretty happy with that, coming off the couch.","Blackrock Hut

Also there were a couple short but steep climbs. Once down to the highway overpass, I texted the Hostel and told them I was ready to be picked up. They came fairly promptly. Once at the Hostel, I was briefed on the rules and given a quick tour, and lastly, showed my room. From there it was a flurry of activity.  First find some loner clothes that fit me reasonably well and head for the shower. Took three washings to get my hair clean. Then back to my room to collect all my dirty laundry, and to the washer to get my laundry started. Back to the bathroom to shave my neck.  Back to the room to look at maps and decide how much food to buy. Downstairs to throw a frozen pizza in the oven. Then back down to the washer to get my clothes drying. Back upstairs to get my pizza out of the oven to eat while my clothes dried. Once dry I took my clothes back to my room to check that every article was present and accounted for. Then, change into my clothes (optional), then walk to Walmart to shop for food. I am not very good at shopping so it always takes a while to find everything that I need. Walk back to the Hostel, take my food down to my room to remove the extra packaging and get it into my food bag. Once completed, update journal and Facebook. That left my about 30 minutes to talk to other Hostel visitors, text my wife and think about dinner. I went to the local all you can eat Chinese Buffet with a couple of people that I had met earlier, on the trail. By the time we got back to the Hostel it was 8:30.

I asked if I should ride to Rockfish Gap on the same trip, and I was told it was out of the way and not wanting to delay my hiker friends, I said I would wait for the van to return.  By the time all was said and done this put me at the trail at 10:00 am, just when the day is just getting the hottest.

I decided to sleep in my tent, but the guy I was hiking with wanted to sleep in the shelter as did the young guy. My hiking partner asked what the young guy was planning to do with food. The young guy responded that he had heard that there was not much bear activity in this area, to which my hiking partner responded that he had seen one just two days prior and it was important to him that there was no food in the shelter. The young hiker asked what we did with our food and we told him that we hang it from a tree limb using the PCT method. Being a nice and inquisitive young hiker he wanted to learn the PCT bear bag hang. He had some rope and a bag for his food. He had to borrow a carabineer from my hiking partner, and we used my old rock sack, but I showed him how to properly hang food. I hope he remembers how to do it for tomorrow night.
