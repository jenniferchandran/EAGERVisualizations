TShaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648174,"The time is growing close to the leave date for my next Section hike. My pack was pretty much the way I left it hanging on a nail,for the last 1.5years. After a 9 day section hike from Ewin,TN to Dennis cove Rd. -(75 miles). Where we had to abruptly end our hike as a friend we were hiking with hurt her foot. We were headed to Damascus, Va. It has hung unused due to short day hikes with friends. But the time has come to get back at it. I have waited for this date to be back on the trail for a long time.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Fri",0
TShaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648175,Today Edna (my hiking pal) & I hiked a short 3 miles over rolling local hills to get a feel of the pack on the back once again. Not fully packed but just wanted to get the feel. It went on as easy as it did 1.5 years ago and oh what a feeling! Excited to start the next short section hike.,,View Entry,"Apr 01, Fri",0
TShaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648424,"Saturday, April 2nd I had my last local hike with my hiking pal! Afterwards, Â We laughed, told stories, drank some cocktails and talked about past adventures. Â We had hiked the last few mornings as we prepare for this weekend. In a few hours we will drive to where we left off 1.5 years ago. To TN, 50 miles short of Damascus, VA, NB on the AT(Appalachian Trail). I will hike with her for 3 days, approximately 35 miles. I will leave and go home and take care of business/life. Â Edna will Hike on to complete the trail. I wish I could go but my life does not allow it at this time. I may meet up with her at some point and section hike with her for a week or so. Â #tanatime #lovelife #GSD #smileon",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Thu",0

I could hear the crunch of the snow, we are right next to the trail. Tomorrow supposed to be sunshine and 60*Â 


My clothes are layered in this picture. Â I have 3 shirts on and yogas under those pants. I had just taken off my raincoat and pants. About 1.5 hours later we hit blast., thankfully I had just put my raincoat on.


We met Vincent from New Orleans with his dog Juniper at the Vandeventer shelter. There was also a mom (momma bear) and her 3 daughters from Texas.Â Â They are through hikers like Vincent. Like Edna they are head to Maine.","Dennis Cove rd

TShaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648701,"Last night when we arrived and put up our tents, shortly after the snow was coming down pretty hard. We were snuggled in our bags, warmed up pretty quick. Â Had a good night of sleep. We woke up with a fair amount of snow on the tents. Â Upon waking it was chilly outside 32Â°. Scrambling to get dressed get up pack up! We knew as soon as we started to walk we would warm up! It was a high of 60Â°. By afternoon we would be wearing just a T-shirt. We did complete 10.5 miles. Beautiful walk to T91 where I will get a shuttle back to Black Bear Resort.","

TShaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/648705,"My last day of the hike ended at 5 PM on Sunday. I would get in her car and drive home alone with out Edna as she will move forward to the north to complete the trail. Happy for her sad for me, I wish I could go. Our first two days were snowy but what a beautiful Sunday! Â Fun day arriving at T 91, Richard a nice gentleman was there with trail magic. My first experience. We made some new friends in the last day. They will be Ednaâ€™s new trail family and they will journey along to the north. Mother Goose and her 3 girls. Great memories made this weekend. Â Safe travels to my friend Edna (she does not have trail name yet). Excited to find out what it will be. I only had one little issue I damaged a couple of toenails which was the first! Â Never had that happen in my other hikes. Â This to shall pass! Â #tanaadventures #lovelife #smileon",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Mon",0
