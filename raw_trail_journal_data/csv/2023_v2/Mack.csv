Mack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661025,"Time to recap the first leg of my thru hike.
Who: Me an average little more then middle aged 66 yr. old not fit but not dead guy.
What:  My dream campout that will last for months. Yesss. 
When: After retiring now no pressure just put on my pack and take a walk.
Why: A dream about the greatest campout. Loved the outdoors since as far as I could remember. But my experience till now was day hikes and long weekend campouts. Day hikes carry what ever I wanted to make the day special. Weekend campouts my old gear was bulky and heavy food was as if we were at home. Once again weight did not mean much miles were low and camp sites were picture perfect. A water fall, grand lake view, top of a mountain waiting for the sun set then greeted by a sun rise. Always a small camp fire to tell stories around. That is my picture of a campout. Note -thru hike is not a campout at least not how my first leg was.
Where: Of corse the AT a Green tunnel up the Appalachian ridge. 
This is how I approached it. First some thought but not much. Watch some thru hike videos read a couple books. Listen to advice but only let some of that sink in. I will figure it out on the trail. Training, heck I know how to walk.
Last minute try out your pack and test out your gear in poor weather to see if you're ready. Well some last second adjustments weight is way too high. Hammock setup out too heavy and not sure about the low temps. Light weight tent in. The new plan Start before the bubble mid Feb. and shoot for the shelters with the tent as a backup. Already had a top 20 deg. and under 10 deg. quilt for the hammock so use them together. My coldest night was 15deg. with 20mph winds. with my night fleece, long johns, buff and (gloves  most of the time sleep with my arms out) I roasted. So the extra quilt at 2 lbs was just extra weight. This year has been mild so far. Clothes too many two sets and a night set. Really even walking in the rain and almost soaked thru I would change to my warm dry night cloths Hang the wet stuff up and sleep with wet socks on my legs so when morning came they were dry. Well most of the time some times a sock would sneak out and be cold and wet for the next day. Most of that clothing was a waste of weight. FOOD wow they say you pack your fears you do. Too much clothes and way too much food. At first would put in an extra day food in for my next resupply. In case I could not make to my next resupply in time. Well every resupply I went with at least 2 extra days of food still in my pack. Unnecessary weight. The worst was Franklin 4 days of food still in pack. Reason was I was with a great group of people. But miles were tough. I say this because the Ga. And NC. the hills are not NY hills they are Mountains. I learned quickly. The trail was up and down. No valleys or mountain tops to walk on. They have narrow ridges and gaps you cross the right back up or down. So I made up my mind to do my hike and make that next section a 5 day section. Well with their encouragement it became a 2.5 day section. 
Sorry for rambling on about Needs verses Comfort of mind. Weight WEIght WEIGTH is true comfort. Less is better. I hear you Pacer you told me many times. Experience is everything.
Not much thought on how to get to Amicalola Falls. Ok found a local train to connect to Amtrak then down to Gainesville Ga. I'm there. Not quite. So a couple of young ladies posted that they were going down on the same train. A former thru hiker and local offered them a ride to the park. I was just going to get off the train at 7am and try to find a ride from that lonely gravel freight yard. Thank you ladies.
Let me get back on track and off trail part one.
Two days in Franklin NC. with my Tramily and catching up with the many hikers I had walked with. Told them of my new plans and said my goodbyes. Leaving them all with an invitation to zero in NY when they get here with me.
Called my sister in Greenville Tenn. for a ride and a visit for a bit.
Then a midnight bus ride from Greenville Tenn to Roanoke Va. to get a train home. Shipped my pack home. So I had less to carry home. The buss in not a comfortable as the train. It dropped me off at 4;30 am for a 8;30 train. Roanoke turns off the lights a 9pm. So that .3 mi. walk to the station was like a night hike in the woods. The station was the only thing lite. But not enclosed boy it was cold. The city did not wake till 8am. Soon to be on a warm train and some rest. 
9 pm made it home with family again. My adventure so far looking back felt more like a dream. Still trying to wipe the smile off my face it was great.","Winding Stair gap

Mack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/656043,Today was white hot. Anytime you have an extreme is a good time to practice. Buddy(my bride of 45 years) wants to camp out also. I set my hammock up next to the carriage house that we store the camper in. Plugged in and connected water AC on high my honey will be happy. It was only about 4 weeks ago I slept out. It was into the 40deg range at night . With no under quilt got a couple hours into the night and had to get up and put the under quilt on. I was cold but the quilt fixed that. This time 78deg low with quilt on. Had to adjust it very lose but was comfortable. In morning woke up and gave myself a cool water wipe down to refresh and start the day. Buddy had coffee on. This might not be back packing but still fun.,,View Entry,"Aug 08, Mon",0

Mack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657605,"Wow my plans had changed suddenly. Out of the blue I decided to retire in June. Then hop right on the trail. Body maybe 66 but mind is still 16. Retirement had it little set backs and a last minute surgery pushed off the trail again. Pre op. check up wow weight up to 292 lbs. That was a wake up not ready. Surgery was easy, hand weak. Lets start the Appalachian trail pre diet. Time to get some walking mileage in. Review my pack for the seasons ahead. Yes for the next 6 mo. I will get prepared. Dropped 20 lbs good start there. Day hikes are on increasing miles and adding pounds to my pack feeling stronger. Spending more time on my pack.  All for the better 2/13/2023 back on.
SO GLAD FOR THOSE SET BACKS. Starting out thinking I could do it in the heat of July would have been an eye opener I know now. Too all planning a thru hike take the time to get the body and mind ready for what lies ahead. And the best to you all on the trail see you there.",,View Entry,"Sep 07, Wed",0

Mack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658547,"Rainy Day Test
Today rainy and 49 deg. Training takes me for a three hour walk M - F. Everyday I get to try out gear also. Today med. poly fleece and poly T shirt and Frogg Tog rain/windbreaker with my hat. Normally with heavy rain I would have my umbrella out not for this test. No pack today. Well it went from light rain to RAIN to Down pour twice. Little cool at first but warmed up. Had poly fleece and jacket down over my hands. Right side must of had sleeve out past jacket. It got soaked so just ringed it out and covered it under jacket sleeve. Even soaked my hand was warm. My Hat has mesh top so I put hood over the hat. Always wondered if a heavy rain would run around the brim and down my back. Well it did not. First pants started getting wet from thighs down into my socks and boots. Then came the down poor now my feet are soaked. They were still warm just squish squish. Had my darn tough heavy socks on. Test proved I could keep most of me dry. Tomorrow another rainy cool day.
Going with Meriwool med. weight with poly t shire over it. I find on cooler days the poly shirt over Poly fleece or Wool shirt keep me warmer. Still Frogg Togg rain/ windbraker for top cover. Adding rain pants to see if that will help with keeping my pants and socks dryer.",,View Entry,"Oct 04, Tue",0
Mack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658579,Second day of rain not as hard or as long but 3deg. higher and no breeze. Today was with rain pants and waterproof socks. Pants Non breathable but waterproof. I will say rain pants are out. Not a drop of water went thru my pants and into my shoes. But my legs and shorts were soaked from the inside out. For my feet sides of boots were dry the pants covered them. Toes on boots soaked but water proof socks kept feet dry and comfortable. Last winter when I first tried the waterproof socks I hiked in sandels thru snow and streams they were great. To dry them you have to turn them insideout for the inside. Then if you have time turn them back out and dry the outside or put them on for another day. Next storm a rain skirt or just a garbage bag to see if that works for me. How about you camp pants or rain pants or rain skirt?,,View Entry,"Oct 05, Wed",0

Put up two hammocks for the guys and a sleep mat for me. Calling for a frost that night and we hit 31deg. Did not put up any flys. Bad move the dew was so heavy every thing felt like it was a light rain. The sky and full moon was great. Small campfire and s'mores. Too late for pictures of the set up. But got every thing hanging up waiting for the sun. The air mat I grabbed went flat . Boy I don't do the hard ground well. Remember the gloves next time my hands were cold.

Mack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659005,"At 66 well worn body a hammock is great. First rain has started. Just grab your tarp and two trees 8 min best time so far you're out of the rain. That spot does not have to be level or free of rocks and roots your above it all. Next hang hammock.Sit take a break. I string a second line everything hangs nothing on ground. My pack is hung with a d ring clip and just slide it the length of the tarp. No floor like the tent but use the hammock is like a shelf to sort stuff on. Use my sit upon on ground for dry spot to stand on. It is a shopping freezer bag. Has many uses, sit on during the day. Dry spot to stand on. Never tried it yet but a town shopping bag. Lastly when I go to sleep put my boots in it and hang on my extra line keeping boots off ground for the night. When cooking in bad weather lower hammock and sit on it just off ground and put stove on ground and start cooking. I can stand up to get dressed. Raise hammock back up and hop in bed. So much nicer than that hard ground. But with all the plusses you have to have draw backs. You're hanging in the air that cold under 40deg. So you have to carry a under quilt and a top quilt extra weight. The fly and hammocks weight is the same as the freestanding tent. You still carry a mat when you're grounded ( no trees not often, Smokies where you have to stay in shelters. ) So extra 2- 3 lbs and comfort or not carry that weight and use a tent hoping for a soft level spot on the ground.

Plans were to go to Heavenly hill farm  about another 7mi. south. Not quite snow made it very hard to find the trail over the ridge in Greenwood lake. The rock climbs were greatly slowed with the snow cover. then towards afternoon the melt made the slush and slips every were slow going. Today Came across a thru hiker that started on Jan. 1. That is good time the bubble hits here around May at best. So we talked seems like a good guy. So I inquired were are you planning to stop. He said Greenwood lake and get a room. I had to invite him home. So we exchanged numbers and he went North in to the ridge I just got off of. Told don't trust all my foot prints I lost the trail many times. off he went with new energy knowing a warm bed waits ahead. Me south finally with foot prints to guide me. Called home with the news we have a guest tonight. Which turned into 3 nights we dropped him off for a slack pack and zero just to talk. But after we parted that day on the trail the phone rang. So much for not losing the trail. I wandered off a woods rd talking so got to back track again. After some knee-deep snow drifts and slippery hills made it to Warwick Turnpike and Patty picked me up. On the way back stopped by Bellvale Creamery and picked up our guest.","Vista trail Greenwood Lake NY
