Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666916,"Arrived at Appalachian Mountain Club Lodge at Pinkham Notch in New Hampshire last night after flight from Chicago and bus from Boston. Juice (my hiking partner from 2 years ago) met me with a Pabst Blue Ribbon and had a dinner saved for me. 
Sunday’s forecast called for 2-3” of rain, lightning, high winds and chance of hail made it an easy decision to delay till Monday. Today Juice and I did a 10 minute hike to a raging waterfall but that didn’t too much for our physical preparation.  A side benefit of delaying our hike is meeting some fascinating people. One hiker has hiked in Nepal five times and was with his hiking buddy who has known for 30 years. A few years ago his buddy was diagnosed with Parkinson’s so they have adjusted their annual hikes but make a point to continue their tradition. I’m a volunteer van driver for an organization (NeuroBalance Center) that provides physical therapy for Parkinson’s (and other neurological conditions) and I’m amazed by the Center’s participants ability to continue doing the physical activities they love. I’m honestly somewhat nervous about tomorrow as it is the steepest section of the entire AT and even though I’ve been diligent in my training I have hike in mountains since last summer.",,View Entry,"Jul 16, Sun",0
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667040,"First day lived up to its reputation as one of toughest stretches of AT. Extremely high ratio of elevation in a short number of miles in the Wildcats. First challenge was a tall,straight up crevasse. Luckily hiker Breezy who I met over the weekend has mountain climbing  experience and showed me the way up. Breezy also had the funniest question on my Wedding Walker trail name “were you walking to or away from a wedding?”  I was also lucky Juice was hiking behind me as both a trekking pole fell out of my pack and he retrieved them. Stop at Carter Notch Hut for a pastry and a break before heading over Carter Dome.  We stealth camped at Mt Hight w sunset vista for dinner but it was obscured by Canada wildfire smoke.    See additional photos In photos section (I can only post one per entry).","Pinkham Notch

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667042,"12 hours to hike 11.2 miles indicates another challenging day.  Simple, an Amish hiker we met on Sunday, was up and going early. He has a flip phone and paper apps so definitely not taking advantage of FarOut app that most hikers use. His Pennsylvania Dutch accent made him a little hard to understand but we had some interesting conversations about his lifestyle. Steep downhills really slowed us down - I either slid down on my butt or used my poles extended to max distance to hold back the wait of me and my 30lb pack. Several fronts of thunderstorms came through adding to the fun. Had to walk through a stream on way to shelter- so much for trying to avoid tons of mud through the course of the day. Shelter had max of 6 people but it was a good call as thunderstorms continued.","Mount Hight

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667058,"When I woke up to the sound of thunderstorms last night I immediately notice two smells- wet clothes and smelly hikers. An example of the disadvantage of staying in 1 of the 250 three-sided shelters along the 2,200 mile AT. We got a shuttle ride into Gorham and hit McDonalds and did a 4 day food resupply at Dollar General for $17. You can imagine how nutritious and delicious that will be but a key shopping criteria is foods that don’t weigh much. We hitchhiked back to the trail and the guy that picked us up was SOBO. (Southbound AT hiker from Mt Katahdin in Maine). Conditions had been very rough in Maine; he had to replace 2 tents already- 1 was blown away in a storm. The McDonalds “Big Breakfast” and cinnamon roll must have energized me as I got to the first summit well ahead of Juice who is younger and most always faster. Two firsts of the trip today were blueberries (small but tasty) and moose poop. Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of the blueberries so my photo of the day is moose poop. We are the Trident Col campsite and Casey who we met at Pinkham Notch is the only other hiker here. Casey had a “am I going to make it across alive” stream crossing the other day so he took a break before returning to the trail.","Rattle River Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667113,"Took a break at Gentian Pond Shelter which featured beautiful mountaintop views and a pond. There were several 4” leeches in shallow water so my shampoo and full body dunk was quick- just one tiny leech on my big toenail who I flicked off. 




Jumping from stone to stone, navigating sketchy bog boards and being careful not to get hurt on the downhill drops from ledges and slabs slowed our pace and we realized we need to add an extra day before the infamous Mahoosuc Notch (toughest or most fun mile on AT). The problem is we didn’t a complete extra full day of food and we are burning 5,000-6,000 calories a day according to my Fitbit. 


One of the sayings on the AT is “the trail will provide”. As I was cooking my rationed portion of dinner Ken from Connecticut (who hiked AT last year as Up and Down) asked me if I could use any extra food!  As “trail magic” he brought extra food so I took extra meals for Juice and me plus shared several snacks with hikers who were still awake (after 8:30pm). Trail magic is something a hiker unexpectedly receives (food, beverages, transportation) and I couldn’t believe we received it in such a remote location.  Thank you Ken!!


Also we crossed into Maine today from New Hampshire!","Trident Col Campsite

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667163,"A funny, popular, inaccurate book on the AT is “A Walk in the Woods”. Today’s hike mileage wise (4.4 miles) would be termed a “Nero” or near zero but it wasn’t a walk in the woods. Several sections of rebar steps in the rocks (will add pic when I have better cell coverage) and lots climbing up with my hands. I did have a harmless slip transitioning from a slab to bog boards where I ended up looking like a baseball player sliding across the muddy boards on my butt with my left leg straight out and my right knee folded under. My family always teases me about how many scratches I have on my legs but I did meet another hiker today whose scrapes rival mine. It was rainy, windy and cold across the two peaks today with visibility about 100 yards. One hiker we met biked the AT north from Georgia beginning in February and started hiking SOBO last month.  I took a nap at Shelter and had some nice conversations with a couple from Tennessee, another from Vermont and a young hiker from Sweden (his trail name is Reese’s cups since he loves them and they don’t have them in Sweden) who has been telling his friends back home how nice and hospitable Americans are. I think that is one of the best lessons out here is you realize how wonderful most people are in this world!","Carlo Col Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667221,"Mahoosuc Notch is described as “one of the hardest and most fun sections of the entire Appalachian Trail”. It is only a mile long but you climb over, under and through a valley of giant boulders. I’m sure there are plenty of videos on YouTube. The fastest hikers seem to make it through in an hour and the slower end of the range is four. We did it in three hours and it probably the most intense full body workout I can remember. I pulled myself up and over giant boulders, crawled on my knees and through caverns (there was ice and flowing water through parts) and we passed our backpacks through the lower passages several times. It was a challenging and fun experience but I wouldn’t volunteer to do it again. At the end the stream we rewarded us with the coldest best tasting water of the trip


We next climbed 1,600 feet up Mahoosuc Arm and looked out at some of mountains we cross next then around a beaver pond (walking over the logs the beavers chopped down) to Speck Pond Shelter and Campsite. The shelter is constructed from huge rough hewn logs and has a caretaker who manages the site. He’s a young man who comes in for 12 days at a time and does trail running and fishing (Brook trout and landlocked salmon) in his spare time.","Full Goose Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667222,"Town Day! Since we haven’t showered in 6 days we are headed to the West Bethel Motel. Before we left I had breakfast with a hiker “Biscuits” from the UK. He has been doing big miles and is trying to get to the terminus (Mt Katahdin) by 8/3 appx 2 weeks ahead of us. There were many day hikers on Old Speck Mountain due to perfect weather and I had several nice conversations. One hiker from the shelter last night said she would leave a couple of Pabst Blue Ribbons for us in the parking lot (and she did!) and another recommended a roadside pie stand. The day was all about food (and laundry) so we were dropped at a burger place, went to grocery store and ate too much! Notes:- The photos section of this page has additional photos (I only post one per day now) - There is also an area to send me notes, ask questions, etc.","Speck Pond Shelter

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667355,"Mixed some of my Puzzle Pie blueberry/strawberry pie with oatmeal and Aaron drive us 30 minutes back to trail head.  The 3 Baldpate mountains were a different challenge than I’ve encountered before - treeless angled granite slabs with green lichen. I was very glad it wasn’t raining as these slabs would have been quite slick. 


We also ran into a family of four from New York who was doing a 3 night hike to “try camping” according to the young son. The mom was really struggling so I’m thinking a more traditional camping trip vs hiking may have been a better option. I also told the family that the reason the shelter had a gap in the floor was to keep porcupines out- hopefully that feature worked for that night 


We camped not too far from Dunn Cascade Falls. Several weeks ago the stream crossing that we rock hopped over had water so high and strong it was impassable. We heard one man actually was carried over a 10’ drop of the 60’ multiple stage waterfall but was ok.","West Bethel Motel

I was so exhausted last night I fell asleep at 8pm - the typical time for AT hikers. Today one Southbound section hiker clearing trail using clippers (she is slack packing)! Also met a thru hiker from Indiana who is also an instructor for rock climbing- what a perfect skill for out here. Here dad flew in from Arizona to visit but he called the 10 mile hike she took him on “death march” so he will be supporting her off trail. 
Day started out fairly easy but descent from Hall Mountain Shelter was tough as my right knee is still sore and somewhat swollen from my bog board slide. Then ascent up Moody Mountain was steep and include rebar and wooden ladders.
 Camping tonight near a river with plenty of tent sites.","Dunn Cascade Waterfalls

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667436,"Even though the extraordinary rains have stopped fording streams is supposed to start to be a fairly regular occurrence heading north. Rock hopping this morning was just one hop short of dry feet. For deeper fording you are supposed to take off your socks, unbuckle the waist belt of your backpack, use your poles and face upstream. 


When we get to Rangeley in a couple days I need to go to an outfitter to repair one of the tent poles (apologies to my son John since it is his tent). Apparently I got in the zippered tent door too close to the corner and heard a snap. Duct tape got me through till morning. 


At this point the NOBO hikers who fly past u have hiked nearly 1,900 miles since this spring have shared markedly different attitudes 
some are stressed to finish by a certain date to make a flight or return to a jobA few just want to be finished and don’t want to even talk about hiking- baseball is fine. others will miss their trail life and friends 


My attitude seems easily influenced by lots of things- 
Positive: calls/texts w family, messages on my trail journal, morning sunlight through the trees, trail magic, good conversations in shelters, mountaintop blueberries, Maine lakes, views and plant life, completing a tough day and going to bed by 8pm, town food, showers and clean clothes, All the volunteers who help maintain the trail Negative: slippery or broken bog boards, ongoing steep rocky downhills that hurt my knees and make me afraid I’m going to fall, long sections of rock hopping over deep mud and water, when I start mentally agreeing with hikers saying “this trail sucks” (but an AT rule is never quit on a bad day), how heavy my backpack is after a food re-supply","South Arm Road

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667437,"I reached first “have to walk through the water” stream crossing and waited for Juice but we got our signals crossed and he had moved on to try to beat the rain and the good news was his feet were feeling better. 


I was coming up a rainy, windy trail towards a highway and a couple told me there was a “hiker feed” (trail magic!) ahead in the parking area. An older (than me) couple Slowstepper and Mary had driven their van 80 miles to serve “red” hot dogs, chips, drinks and cookies to long distance hikers! Slowstepper section hikes the AT over 25 years and has climbed Mt Katahdin 5 times including the very narrow “Knifes Edge Trail”. Two SOBOs from Illinois and the UK joined me under a makeshift tarp with driving rain around us. What a nice surprise from two special trail angels. 


On my way to Sabbath Pond Lean-to I told several other hikers not to miss the trail magic. I experienced greasy mud when coming down a ledge and ended up at a 45° angle furiously running in place sideways (reminded me of the old cartoon character Roadrunner) till I finally saved myself from a “side plant” in the mud with a trekking pole. 


Even though it was before 4pm the shelter was packed. Later a group of hikers stopped in but went to the tent platforms and the rain had finally stopped","Bemis Mountain Lean-to

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667558,"One the way out from the shelter the trail passed a large, foggy pond (in the Midwest it would be a lake because of it's larger size). One feature of the pond was the loons serenading us last night.  Frogs, toads and several small snakes seemed to enjoy that the trail turned into a stream at many points. As a result we were back to rock jumping and balancing on decaying or missing bog boards.  One hiker, Struggle Bus, told me how another hiker kiddingly challenged him to a trekking pole ""duel"" when they met at two bog boards- have to make the most of the adventure. There were two young, volunteer crews from the Maine Appalachian Trail Club working on moving large rocks as stepping stones - a tough assignment and one they had to hike several miles in to complete.  
We arrived at Hiker's Hut in Rangeley and it has the coolest outdoor shower I've seen on the AT (I'll post a video to this page). Years ago a woman was using the shower saw a moose across the stream! I've yet to see a moose but have seen quite a few fresh hoof prints and lots of moose poop so I figure they like to quietly watch us go by. After a shower we headed into Rangeley (nice little town) for laundry, food and an Outfitter put some Gorilla tape and zip ties on my broken tent pole.  We also shared our electronics in town since Hiker's Hut is off-the-grid in terms of electricity, WiFi and cell coverage. They have  solar and propane as energy sources. At night we got a small little solar light for our nice little 3-person bunk house.","Sabbath Mountain Lean-to

The views today were in the top two of anywhere I’ve experienced on the AT.  The  expansive views in all directions started when we went above tree line on Saddleback Mountain and continued as we summited Mount Horn and Saddleback Junior. It was dramatically cooler and windy above tree line but we did sit and visit with an AT Ridge Runner who monitors about 40 miles of this area.  Again the steep boulder/slab descents were very challenging. At one point I found myself hanging by my left arm with my back against a granite wall and just had to let go to get to ground below. 
We arrived at the shelter just as it started raining and again shared the shelter with Flying J,  Soup Cup and Chillin. Temperatures dropped into the 40’s so people started going to sleep around 7 pm","Hiker's Hut

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667564,"Day began with a wet water crossing (socks off, shoes on) at Orbetron Stream.  The walk up from the stream was one of a kind - a fast granite water sluice, major and mini ledge waterfalls for almost a mile. All around were bright mosses growing over rocks, ferns, birches with the stream right at my side.  Today's 4,000 footers were Mt. Abraham, Spaulding Mountain & Sugarloaf Mountain - the back side of Spaulding was another one of those too steep descents but I just take it slow. As we approached the campsite, over the stream, there was a wood plank between two rocks several feet above the water. One end is secured by a wire cable since, when the streams rises during a storm, the unsecured end of the plank gets knocked off the one rock and floats in the river till the water level goes down and a volunteer repositions the plank when it is safe again. The good news about the evening was I was just feet away from a stream that was a wonderful background noise. The bad news was the tent pole repair did not work and duct tape helped it work for the night but I need a Plan B for the tent. The entertainment for the evening was Juice filming my multiple (ok it was about 6) attempts to throw a bear bag rope (weighted with a stone) over a branch that was about 30' in the air. Underhand was not the right technique but sidearm finally worked.","Poplar Ridge Lean-to 
",Carrabassett River Campsite,"Jul 30, Sun",13.10
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667566,"As we were coming down Sugarloaf Mountain yesterday I looked across and I saw two large mountains across the valley - of course those were two more 4,000 footers that we climb today - South and North Crocker Mountains. One of the rewards for climbing over these mountains is the views from the top or side. The Crockers didn't offer much in the terms of views. I even stopped at one ""view"" and at first all I could see was clouds. Luckily as I sat on a boulder eating a protein bar, there were some sunny spots on mountains far away which was a very nice surprise. With 4 miles to go a weirdly vibrating wind ushered in waves of heavy rain which didn't help trail conditions. When I eventually reached the trail head Juice had already told me he had gotten a ride into Stratton I was ready to call the Maine Roadhouse Hostel for a ride when trail angel ""Bourbon Batman"" offered me a donut, an ice tea and a ride into town. The general store/gas station served up an delicious meatball sub with onion rings - gotta love town food.

Poet from Shaws Hostel in Monson was very helpful in recommending a new tent (Big Agnes Tiger Wall UL2) and scheduling a shuttle driver to make the 1.5 hour drive to my hostel. By early afternoon the tent hadn’t arrived and I had expected it before noon.  When the driver, Gomer Pyle, arrived who was in the front seat but our Amish friend Simple. His flip phone had issues so Gomer made a special effort to drive him to a store that could resolve his problem. The tent set up was easy so I’m good to go in the morning!

After an amazing breakfast Jenn drove us back to the trail. This was one of the best hostels I’ve been to on the trail and I met some very interesting people. One hiker starts hiking at 3:30am and sees incredible sunrises. He also carries a 50lb pack but he only weighs 150lbs. Last night I watched a 19 year old hiker eat an entire half gallon of ice cream. He passed me hiking the next morning and I asked if he was working off the ice cream and his response was “I worked that off just sleeping”. My metabolism doesn’t work like that! You also see people dealing with the responsibilities of the “real world” while long distance hiking (college applications, job interviews and picking up 2 bridesmaids dress options from a tiny post office). Additional information on trail angel Bourbon Batman who gave me a ride the other day, he’s the local sheriff! 


Today we summited most of the Bigelow Mountains which are the last 4000’ till the northern terminus of the AT at Mt. Katahdin. Views were spectacular from all the peaks- views of Sugarloaf ski resort, huge ponds (aka lakes) and with the PeakFinder app we could actually just see Katahdin in the distance.  The descent at end of day was another tough one with too steep drops where I look down and wonder “how the heck am I supposed to go down that!” 


As we neared the campsite we were surrounded by hour/garage size boulders, one of which we had to go under on the way in. I found a tent site near an older hiker who repeatedly sang “I’ve got a black magic woman who’s going to make a devil out of me”.  His singing wasn’t enough to keep a mouse from coming up on the large rock I was sitting on and sniffing food wrappers. I scared him away with my trekking pole and he didn’t come back.","Maine Roadhouse Hostel

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667705,"Today was our longest mileage day of the trip, 16.4 miles.  The reason is we wanted to be able to catch the AT canoe that crosses the Kennebec River the next day and it only operates between 9am - 2pm. After 2pm the hydroelectric dam upstream releases a huge flow of water. We sat for lunch at the shoreline of a large, still pond with mountains at the end of the long view. We tented off the trail in a sort of clearing about 100 yards off the trail and prepared for a rainy overnight and an early start to catch the canoe. As I was going to sleep I heard a Hermit Thrush (identified via app) that I’m not sure I have heard. The white throated sparrow is another one that’s call seems new to me","Safford Notch

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667706,"I packed up my wet tent and left camp by 5:45am to ensure we’d make the canoe crossing prior to 2. There were some great flat stretches where we could make good time but tons of thick, thick mud, roots, rocks and water on the trail to slow our pace. Early in the day there were single and double bog boards 4 or 5 feet over the water to cross a 40 foot span off a pond. If these boards were a few inches off the ground it wouldn’t have bothered me but I definitely didn’t want to slip from that height into the water! 


Another unique crossing was a bridge constructed of 3 trees. 1 for your feet and 2 as railings. The logs were a little slippery and bouncy but did the job. 



The canoe that crosses the Kennebec is part of the AT. It even has a white blaze painted on the inside bottom of the canoe. The current was super strong but we crossed in several minutes and then on to the Sterling Inn to dry out after a rainy night and day and resupply for our next section.","Stealth site at logging road

As we were nearing the 3/4 mark of our 15 mile today we came to a dirt road and Snickers was there with Snickers bars (of course) and a jug of water (and we had just run out). Snickers had been on the trail supporting her thru hiker husband Aerilon part time since February and full time since she retired as an Orthopedic Physicians assistant. She has totally embraced the trail community offering medical advice, slack packing (where you just carry a small backpack for the day and someone drives you back to where your backpack is or moves your backpack forward) and encouragement. We’ve been at 2 hostels with her and her husband. 
A couple hundred later a woman stopped us and offered us Gatorade and snacks! Trail Angel Delphine reminded me of my Aunt Marjorie and was a delight. She has a camp near by and we will be doing her favorite hike tomorrow, Moxie Bald. She also told us the next “rock hop” water crossing used to be two wire cables. One above you to hold on to and one below you to walk on! She said it didn’t seem very safe. 


Today’s Hike started out with the Maine mud but and fairly strenuous ascent but it was only a 3,000 footer or less. At lunch I feasted on mountain blueberries, they are really starting to ripen and are small but so delicious. As the day continued I was tempted to stop for more along the way. 


At the shelter there were two friends from Texas, two older hikers (Chong and Seeker) we’ve previously met and three teachers from a Quaker school In Pennsylvania. We had a quite an interesting conversation on Quakers and the many misconceptions of their religion especially comparisons to the Amish.","Sterling Inn

It would make a long day, 16 miles, but they stayed one shelter ahead so this way I could catch up. There were 3 wet stream crossings and the first 2 were fine. I read the FarOut app comments on the 3rd and it said “typically a wet crossing” but when I got there the current looked very strong. There was a rope tied to trees and both sides so I proceeded to cross. My poles vibrated in other crossings but halfway across the pressure on my body and poles became extreme and I realized should not have attempted fording this stream (see video clip below). The water was up to the top of my legs and it was difficult to maintain my balance. I saw another hiker at the other shore and I told him not to cross and he told me he definitely was not, he was taking the reroute. Reroute? Then it hit me - yesterday Chong, Seeker and I had taken a wrong turn and had not avoided the 3rd “impassible stream” which I had just forded!  I was really shaken up by that fording and was angry with myself that I did not realize we did not take the correct reroute past all 3 impassible streams. Juice and Geisha Girl had taken the correct reroute which was shorter overall but place them at least 4 miles further up the trail. I stopped at the next shelter had a cup of coffee berating myself for both the mistake of not taking and the correct reroute and putting myself in danger by fording the last crossing, Long Pond Stream. The day turned better when a woman with a local vacation home offered me trail magic from her backpack- delicious tomatoes, cheese and crackers and Snickerdoodle cookies. Wait wasn’t I in the  100 Mile Wilderness? A nice surprise I really appreciated. During the day I met Daddy Long Trails (an army veteran) and saw the remains of a mountain top plane crash where everyone miraculously survived. As got within a mile or so from the shelter it was getting dark so I had to hike by headlamp on looking for the white blazes on the trees. At one point I wasn’t sure where the trail was, no blazes that I could see so I turned on my FarOut app which has GPS and can show me which way the trail is but…the app was frozen and unresponsive. I managed to find a blaze and two hikers told me the shelter was up and over the next mountaintop and Geisha Girl had saved me a spot. I finally arrived at 9pm and I had left the last shelter and 6am. Most hikers are asleep by 8pm but everyone was very considerate while I got situated in the shelter. This day and the day prior were definitely two of the roughest days I’ve ever had on the trail.","Wilson Stream Lean-to

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668140,"Today was a much more normal day than the prior two- thank goodness. I tried reinstalling the FarOut on a cold and windy summit. I’m sure I looked pretty silly holding my phone in the air trying to get two bars of LTE cell service but no luck getting the newly downloaded app to work. 
I saw what was either a moose or a large deer off to my left side- I want to think it was a moose.  
The tenting site we stayed at was at a fairly high elevation- it was windy and quite cool but nice and dry.","Chairback Mountain Lean-to

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668141,"I lose track of the days of the week out here but Whitecap Mountain had a good number of day hikers (whose close look clean and bright and they smell nice). Whitecap was a peak that had cell service so we called to confirm the time of our food drop from Shaw's (1/2 way through the 100 Mile Wilderness and I added a knee brace to our delivery as I'd started having a few issues with my right knee. 
As we were approaching a logging road intersection with a mountain spring, Daddy Long Trails yelled back to us that there was trail magic for us at the road. Geisha Girl and Blue had left us to IPA's - and they were still cold - a perfect mid-day refreshment!!
From sitting inside Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to we could see the waterfall and stream - it would have been tough to duplicate that on AirBNB. Had a nice discussion with two women were hiking the 100 Mile Wilderness southbound so they gave us some updates on stream crossings and the terrain.","Stanley Tappan Campsite

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668145,"Poet from Shaw's Hostel met us with our 11am food drop plus brought along some leftover pancakes from breakfast. I asked him to repeat the Haiku he recited when he took us to the trail “So drink your deepest now, for the richest stuff settles in the final swig"" referring to the final northbound section to Katahdin.       
Stopped for lunch at Antlers campsite which had beautiful view of boulders in the water looking down a pond.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668204,"The main climb for today was Nesuntabunt mountain but the rewards were our first decent view of our destination, Mt. Katahdin and cell service to send a pic to family. At the summit there was a nice set of boulders to have a bite to eat and look out at Katahdin. When I got there I met a couple from Michigan (Water - the wife, Bucket- the husband). She is hiking the entire AT and he joined her for the 100 Mile Wilderness. As I approached a stream later in the day I could no longer stand the smell of my ""hiking tshirt"" that I had worn for 5 days and washed it and my hair. Tshirt was cold but I knew it would dry during the course of the day - nothing in Maine seems to dry at night in the cool, humid night air. In addition to the unique name ""Nesuntabunt"" for a mountain also passed through ""Pollywog Gorge"". I pass ponds and lakes all day long but I loved when the trail actually went onto gravel beaches - having grown up on a lake in Michigan, being by the water is one of my favorite things. Within a mile of the target campsite the trail turned into greasy mud and one mis-step put my previously ""dry all day"" trail shoe into the muck! Geisha Girl and Juice were already at the campsite and there was a piped spring ( a metal pipe coming out of the ground gushing crystal clear, great tasting water) right near a picture-perfect beach and view. I didn't go in the water as a family was rinsing their socks in the water and when they pulled them out there were leaches on them! 
As I was filtering my water at my tentsite Geisha Girl shared some news that may sound strange in the ""real world"" but was a gamechanger on trail = She and her friend Blue had two extra spaces at their campsite the day before we all planned to summit Katahdin. The standard way for long distance hikers to obtain a campsite prior to summit is to get in a line as early as 3:30AM to ensure one of the sixteen spots for the sign up list that opens at 7AM! My wife Beth was a standby to help us find an alternate spot if we didn't make the cut so she shared my happiness when I told her we could ""sleep with Geisha Girl and her friend""! Again the difference between being on-trail and being in the real world.","Namakanta Stream lean-to
",Rainbow Spring Campsite ,"Aug 14, Mon",17.30
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668206,"Last night was finally the perfect night to see the stars and planets in the wilderness of Maine - what a sight it was. In the morning I was treated to a perfect sunrise coming up over the pond and our tent site. Days and nights like this are just one of the rewards from long distance backpacking. Later in the morning we saw a seaplane making multiple takeoffs and landings on a pond - we guessed it was a fishing camp. When we stopped some fisherman along the trail they said brown trout is the main fish they catch. Fish over a campfire sounded pretty good. We always try to time our breaks for a scenic spot, this morning we saw a few large, pondside boulders and took a little extra time knowing that our outdoor adventure was coming to an end soon. 
Along the way we met a family from Ohio with a 9 and 11 year old that was hiking the 100 Mile Wilderness and summiting Katahdin. The mom worked the AMC huts in New Hampshire when she was young. They were very conscientious about making sure the kids ate enough calories daily. We also received a hero’s welcome with a trekking pole tunnel by the “Four M’s”  (see video)
We picked the ""public"" campground at Abol Bridge since they had showers (I hadn't showered in 6 days) but before we set up our tents we had beers with eight other hikers celebrating our completion of the 100 Mile Wilderness and the fact that we would soon be summiting Katahdin. Our pondside campsite had perfect views of Katahdin and Bucket and Water joined us for dinner at our picnic table. Tomorrow would be an early day for many hikers who were planning to line up at the long distance hiker kiosk for sign up at the Birches campsite (closest to Katahdin) as early as 4AM. Sign up sheet went live at 7AM. Luckily for Juice and me, Geisha Girl and Blu had invited us to stay at their 4 person campsite at Katahdin Stream which they had booked weeks ago.","Rainbow Spring Campsite 
",Abol Bridge Campsite ,"Aug 15, Tue",11.40
Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668232,"The hikers from our campsite gathered for the included breakfast in the restaurant attached to the camp store. The good news of the morning was all the hikers who got up early to sign up for the Birches campground got a spot. The tough news was that one thru hiker, Toto, had to go to the ER with high fever and other symptoms. 
Geisha Girl and I headed out early to meet Blu at the campsite. We stopped for a break on a giant slab of granite that extended 2/3 across of the river. Down below us was a cabin that seemed out of place in the wilderness but must have quite a history to be located in such a perfect spot.
Our lean-to at Katahdin Stream Campsite was pretty sad looking - small, roof was moss covered and looked like it needed repair and the site had dead trees and stumps around it. Baxter Park is huge (200K acres) and importantly not part of the Maine Park System.  Governance is provided by the Baxter State Park Authority, consisting of the Maine Attorney General, the Maine Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and the Director of the Maine Forest Service. Only a very small portion of the park has camping and the governance is not followed the public could lose access to the park. 
Blu who has been sleeping in her Ford Edge helping Geisha Girl and other hikers with rides, slack packing, meals, etc brought healthy snacks (fruit, guacamole, cheese) and beer to our lean-to site which was a wonderful surprise. 
The ranger stopped by and gave us our hiker permits for the next day, discussed return trail options and use of loaner backpacks so we don't have to carry our big backpacks while summitting. 
Juice, who snores like a freight train at times, actually moved over to the unoccupied shelter next door. It was hard to believe this was my last night on the trail and I would be summitting in the morning.","Abol Bridge Campsite

Wedding Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668238,"Woke up realizing this was the big day- climbing the highest mountain in Maine and the northern terminus of the AT (Baxter Peak, Katahdin). I had a typical breakfast..fig bars, oatmeal but Blu gave me a clementine which was a flavorful addition. I had picked up a smelly, smaller loaner backpack and I loaded a few layers of clothes, 2 liters of water and some protein bars in it for the day which we estimates would take 8-10 hours for the 10.4 mile round trip. We passed the sign in register at 7am, a set of waterfalls after that and joined quite a few day hikers on the way up. As we went above tree line we were optimistic that the morning fog might burn off as we began to see peeks of other mountains and blue skies. The hiking transitioned to rock climbing and we picked our way over, around and through boulders occasionally pulling up on rebar with our hands and pushing down on it with our feet. As we looked up all we could see was more rocks and slabs to climb way in the distance. There seemed to be no end to the false summits. Eventually the land flattened out but the fog intensified. We started passing hikers some us knew that had summited high fiving them and accepting their encouragement “you got this”, “you’re almost there”.  I had hiked 320 miles 80k feet ascent, 79k feet descent since July 17 to get here and a total of 1,600 miles since 2014 so I was ready!



The trail started to go up again and only when we were about 50’ away did we see the weathered sign marking our final goal. At first we couldn’t find Juice but he was behind a large Boulder shielding himself from the weather. Once we found him we took our summit photos and instead of hanging out savoring our accomplishment and enjoying the views (there were none!) we started the hike down and the mist soon turned to real rain and cold. We knew there were no easy ways down but followed our plan of taking the Abol Trail down instead of the Hunt Trail we took up. The Abol trail had my least favorite things- steep drop descents and slippery slabs that were covered with a thin coat of gravel. One of the main techniques we used was throwing down our poles and sliding on our butts down the boulders and slabs. When it was steeper we just had to lower our bodies and drop. Fortunately the trail eventually began to look like a trail and the rain stopped. As we started to get near the end of the trail I heard Geisha Girl call out “Is that Beth”? Beth and her friend Ro had hiked up to meet us. I was SO happy to be back with Beth after being separated for 4 weeks! When we got to the parking lot I saw our SUV and writing on the rear window said “Neither rain, nor mud, nor pestilence will keep them from climbing Katahdin or finishing the AT. Congratulations Wedding Walker and Juice”. Next Beth and Ro laid out an incredible spread of sandwiches, chips, fruit, desserts and beer as other hikers “Mr. Blue, Stargazer, Magician” joined Juice, Geisha Girl, Blue and me. Magician (a 20 something guy) looked like the happiest person in the world. As he was leaving he said something to Beth like “I know I smell, but can I please hug you?”  
Next we went to a hostel for Juice to stay at before heading home to Virginia. While he was inside I saw Grasshopper (who had just sprained his ankle very badly the day before summiting) and his dad (Around the Corner) and congratulated them and loaded up a very happy Grasshopper with some desserts and beers. There was no room at the hostel so we dropped Juice off at a scary looking hotel. Juice and I did a goodbye hug and talked about the fact that we had hiked over 500 miles together in 2 separate hikes. 


Hiking the AT is no easy task and this section was the hardest section I’ve ever done and probably the most difficult physical challenge I’ve ever attempted. Before the hike I was asked if I would do a talk about my hiking at our village community center. During the hike when the person coordinating the event reached out to me in the first couple weeks of my hike I remember saying “just don’t say in the description that I completed this section because it is brutal”.  Luckily I took each day one at a time, I “never quit on a bad day”and I could not have wished for a better support system- my wife, family, friends, journal readers, trail angels, trail maintainers, hostel owners and my fellow hikers who walked the same steps I did.  I hope that I return to the “real world” I can bring back some of the good things from the trail - simplicity, shared purpose, openness in communications, encouragement and willingness to help others in their journey. 


I’d also recommend you read Geisha Girl’s blog for our summit day. She is a wonderful writer and I was very fortunate to hike with her.
