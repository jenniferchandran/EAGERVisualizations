The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650752,"Why would anyone want to spend four to six months on the AT? The Pacific Crest Trail has better views, higher peaks, better trails, and more wilderness. The Continental Divide Trail is more rugged and wild. The Arizona Trail is in my backyard. The Camino de Santiago is older and more spiritually significant. There are hundreds of long trails. Why thru hike the AT? 
For me, I have to. I just can't shake the idea. Not that I've really tried to, of course. And I've learned to listen to ideas that just won't leave me alone.
When I was 19, I met this girl in the lobby of my college dorm. After talking to her for five straight hours, I just knew she was the one. Forty plus years later she still is. Hands down, the best decision I ever made. Eight years into my professional career I knew I needed to start my own business. It was the best business decision I ever made. Twenty years later, I knew it was time to pass the business on to my employees and finally take a vacation. It was the second-best business decision I ever made.
My need to hike the AT feels like those other ""just knew it"" ideas. Each time, I just knew it was something I had to do.
I got the girl. I had the career. I finally have the time. I just need to get out there and start walking. 
I hope you'll come along on the journey.",,View Entry,"May 10, Tue",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650754,"In the spring of 2002, I spent a week solo canoeing at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) in the southern Appalachians. Because my parents were living in Gibsonville, North Carolina back then, I flew into Raleigh and stopped by for a visit before driving up to the NOC. As I was leaving their house, my mom, an avid reader with excellent but eclectic taste in books, handed me one she'd just finished, saying she thought it was the kind of book I might enjoy. I thanked her, gave her a hug, and tossed it on the backseat of my rental car.
When I checked into my shared cabin at the NOC that evening and discovered it had no TV or WiFi, I walked back down to the parking area and fetched the book from the backseat. Back in my room, I cracked it open and started reading what turned out to be Bill Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods."" Whatever you might think of Bryson as an AT thru hiker (he isn't), he is an excellent writer. ""A Walk in the Woods"" is one of his best efforts. By the time I fell asleep, I'd knocked off about a third of the book.
The next morning, I decided to walk the small path behind my cabin down the hill to the restaurant by the river.  As I left the cabin, I noticed a rather forlorn looking backpacker sitting on the cabin steps next to a row of dirty, overstuffed backpacks and a picket fence of hiking poles, but didn't think much more about her. Then, along the path to breakfast, I noticed a few 2x6 inch white blazes painted on trees along the little trail I'd taken. Wait!? Was I on the trail I'd been reading about all night?  I asked the waitress and found out that, sure enough, my walk to breakfast was my first AT hike. When I got back to the cabin after eating, the young woman was still there, so I asked if she was thru hiking. She looked up sadly and said with a long sign, ""I'm trying, but I just don't know. I'm so tired and sore.""  She looked defeated.
During our lunch break that day, on the banks of the Nantahala River with the canoe crew, I mentioned that I was reading Bryson's book. Another student chimed in saying that David Miller's ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" is better and gives a much more realistic account of an AT thru hike. Who knew there were more books about the AT? I read Miller's book next, followed by Earl Shaeffer's ""Walking With Spring."" 
More than a hundred AT books later, and my discovery of the hiker diaries on www.trailjournals.com, I knew I had a problem. And there was only one solution.
I had to hike this trail for myself.",,View Entry,"May 11, Wed",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650756,"I'm Hiking the AT Because I Read a Book??  
That's crazy.
First off, no, it's not crazy. Books inspire all kinds of things, most of which aren't completely crazy. 
Second, Bryson's book was no more the reason for my wanting to thru hike the AT than the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand caused World War I. A Walk in the Woods may have been the spark, but reading it only triggered a need that had been lurking beneath the surface for a very long time.
How long had this need been lurking, you ask?  
I think I was fated to hike the AT since I was big enough to stuff a leaky tent and some leftover hot dogs in my dad's old Army surplus canvas backpack and head into the scraggly woods and abandoned farm fields behind my parent's house in upstate New York. Back then, in the days before cable TV, Nintendo, and the Internet, I spent nearly all my non-school hours walking in the woods, climbing hills, and following creeks anywhere within a day's walk of my home.  Also, I was a Boy Scout, like just about every other boy in the 60's and 70's who liked the outdoors.  Most of my fellow Scouts were vaguely aware that the AT existed, that it passed through New York state, and could be hiked north to Maine or south to Georgia. 
As teenager, I did my share of backpacking in the woods around Syracuse, and occasionally ventured north into New York's Adirondack Mountains or south to the Catskills. I was enough of a hiker that my dad got me a pair of 5-pound Raichle leather boots and a Jansport external frame backpack with a ... gasp... totally revolutionary (unpadded canvas) ... hip belt for my high school graduation present. State-of-the-art on both counts back then. That faded red backpack still hangs in my garage, though I have upgraded several times in the 30 years since I last used it. The massive, steel-shanked Raichle's are long gone too, along with the toenails they took with them, replaced by something much lighter and with more room in the toe box. But I'll bet somebody is still wearing those Raichle's, unlike the dozens of trail runners I've burned through in the last three decades. 
At some point during high school, some friends and I traveled downstate and hiked a trail in New York's southern tier that had AT-style shelters (I recall snoring and mice). That trip may have been on the AT, though I couldn't say for sure and have lost touch with anyone who might remember where we went. Like most high schoolers in someone else's car, I paid no attention to our route, and just trusted whoever's dad put together the trip with all the details.
Back then, it never occurred to me that I could thru-hike the whole AT. I'd never even heard of anyone thru hiking the AT. That was in the mid-70's, and only about 500 people had hiked the entire trail since it was completed in 1921. Ever. In 50 years. And most of those did it in sections over many years. 
After I finished high school and left home, I moved further and further west until I ended up in Arizona. I spent the next 40 years in the desert, which put the AT well off my radar screen until one evening when I sat on the back porch of an internet-free cabin at the NOC less than a hundred feet from the first white blaze I'd thought about in decades.  
Bryson's book didn't have much work to do to inspire my desire to thru hike the AT. I've always loved epic adventures, but running a business and helping raise a family left little time for such things. I'd managed to squeeze in plenty of day hikes, short river trips, and backpacking weekends over the years. But I'd always begin those little adventures looking the other direction from the trailhead wondering what I'd missed. And I'd finish every trip wistfully wondering what was around the next bend. Something in me would rather do all of trail than just a piece of one. 
A few years after my first visit to the NOC in 2002, after listening to me tell, re-tell, and probably re-re-tell the best parts of the 100-plus AT memoirs I'd read over several years, my wife Kate ""gave"" me an AT thru hike for Christmas. But we both knew our lives didn't have the space for it yet, so I put it back in the box to be opened later. Back then, our kids were in school with college just ahead, and my business was barely more than a promising start up. I didn't have the time for anything more than little adventures.  
Gradually, as the kids got older and the business hit its stride, my little adventures started getting bigger. I pedaled my road bike down the Pacific Coast Highway in the fall of 2013, while Kate drove the sag wagon and spent her mornings writing and beach combing before meeting me at the next night's destination - a ""thru-pedal"" of sorts. The next summer, we rowed our raft through Grand Canyon for the first time - a ""thru paddle""? A year after that, I hiked the John Muir Trail (or at least part of it, but that's a different journal). And then the two of us thru hiked the Northumbrian Coast Path, the Hadrian's Wall Trail, the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, and the South West Coast Path in England.  And then the Camino de Santiago (Frances Route) in Spain. (There are trail journals for all them...check 'em out!) And then, thru paddles of the Verde and Gila rivers in Arizona (check out Verde River Elegy and Gila River Elegy on Amazon.com or VishnuTemplePress.com for those stories). 
Finally, 2020 was the year. I'd sold the business, so I had the time. The kids had graduated and were successfully adulting on their own, so I had the freedom. Kate was down for some adventure. Nothing could stop us! 
Nothing, that is, except this little virus. News of a flu-like virus in Wuhan, China had just broken when I left Phoenix for my sixth Grand Canyon rafting trip in February 2020. When I got back into cell range in late March, the little virus had morphed into a worldwide pandemic that had shut down everything, including any hope of a 2020 or 2021 thru hike. Not wanting to get my hopes up for a 2022 try, I made other adventure plans, and set my sights on 2023.
So, fingers crossed, 2023 is the year. What could go wrong?",,View Entry,"May 12, Thu",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651800,"I hiked a tiny bit of the AT during my visit to the NOC in 2002, and not just from the cabin to the restaurant. One morning, I got up extra early before heading out to the river and climbed for about an hour toward Cheoah Bald. What a sweet climb. The next morning, I crossed the highway and walked a little towards Wesser Bald.  But those hardly count as shake down hikes. 
I came a little closer to an actual shakedown hike in 2010. In late June, the family came east for my parents' 60th wedding anniversary. Instead of flying to Raleigh, Kate and I flew into Atlanta with our youngest son Sam, who was the only one still in high school and living with us.  We spent a day running Reach 4 on the Chattooga River (what a ride!) and then drove up to Dahlonega the following day to hike the AT Approach Trail from Amicolola State Park to the Springer Mountain trailhead. The hiker bubble was long gone by late June, so we had the trail to ourselves, aside from a few trail maintainers. Another sweet climb. Kate and Sam both knocked out the 9 miles like champs. I was secretly hoping to squeeze a visit to Walasi Yi (now Mountain Crossings) and a climb up Blood Mountain, but that didn't pan out.
In September that same year, I flew to Bangor, Maine, drove up to Baxter State Park, and climbed Mount Katahdin on my 50th birthday. For that hike, I was definitely in the thru hiker bubble. With the ""crowds,"" I was lucky to get admitted to the park at all and was even more lucky to have suitable weather for the climb. Even with my fresh legs and only a day pack, I could not keep pace with most of the thru hikers that sped past me on the way to their finish line. I suppose any slower thru hikers either didn't make it to Maine or were still on their way. Still, I had some nice conversations with them as they passed or if I caught them taking a break, and learned a few trail names and got a few questions answered before they'd leave me behind. 
I'd done Springer and Katahdin. The only part left to do was the 2,184 miles in between them.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651799,"Registered for my hike today.  
I'll be starting at Amicolola State Park and doing the Approach Trail. I hear it's bad practice for personal safety to announce in a blog where you'll be at any given time. Instead, I'll tell you that it was 319 days, 12 hours, and 28 minutes (that's 27.6 billion milliseconds according to my Countdown app!) from when I wrote this post.  That way, I'll only be attacked by henchmen who can do math. Or who figured out how to zoom in on the photo.Maybe it's too soon to start counting down, but I've been waiting for this for two decades.
In the meantime, I'm watching AT thru hiker vlogs and reading some trail journals. I also monitor the AT 2023 Facebook group, which is inadvertently hilarious - Can anyone tell me that kind of shoes to wear? Should I buy a tent?). Cue the same discussions over again...I'm watching these vloggers: Lil'Chap Energizer (Old Man & the AT)Trekking ThruHiking Dancer (Roadrunner)Jay Wanders Out  I was reading some trail journals too, but every one of them bailed out or stopped writing, and haven't found any replacements that have captured my attention.

I can also promise I won't just stop writing.If you have any 2022 vlogs and journals you're really enjoying, let me know. Of the 2023 crop, TBD's (Janet Whyde) looks promising.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651836,"By April 2014, I'd sold the business and could hear the trail calling my name, but an agreement with the new owners (my former employees) and two kids in college kept me working full time. I did have enough freedom to squeeze in a nine-day section hike.
My go-to hiking buddy Brian Fry had heard enough AT stories from me over the years to agree to come along. Brian kind of owed me after convincing me to join him in what turned out to be an epic failure (for me) to summit Mt. Rainier the previous year (Brian summited, of course - he's a beast of a climber). But that's a story for another day. As a bonus, Brian's brother Mike and his wife Lynne lived north of Atlanta and agreed to shuttle us from the airport to the top of Springer Mountain and then back from however far we could hike over the next nine days.

The AT in April was everything I imagined – faint hints of nature’s golden first green at the lower elevations, and stark, brown woods that had just sloughed off winter on the ridges. Cold nights, the promise of almost-warm afternoons, and enough wildly changing spring weather to keep us constantly digging into our packs for the right layers. And all the milestones I’d been reading about for years – the bronze plaque on Springer; the first white blaze; steep climbs up Blood, Standing Indian, and Albert Mountains; Neels Gap and the shoe tree; the first state line.  

Brian and I are experienced backpackers and didn’t think we’d learn much during our short section hike. But we did. Here’s a brief list of lessons learned, most of which I’ll probably revisit later during my 2023 hike: 
Walking in the Woods. I absolutely love walking in the woods. I love the open deserts and 360-degree mountain top views in Arizona, but my soul lives in the woods. Bring on the long green tunnel!The Pre-Trip Crisis. There’s always some kind of emergency just before you leave on a long adventure that threatens the trip. Expect it. Deal with it. On this trip, I got out of town without a hitch, but when I got to Mike and Lynne’s house, I discovered I’d left my hiking shoes home. Finding size 15 hiking shoes in rural Georgia is not as easy as you might think, so I hiked in a pair of size 14 sneakers from a camping warehouse store near Jasper. I'll try to remember my shoes in 2023.Staying in Shelters. Meh. Noisy, crowded, and vermin infested. Maybe on rainy nights, outside of the hiker bubble, and then only to avoid packing up a wet tent. But maybe I’d prefer the wet tent.
Slackpacking. Oh, yeah! It’s offensive to the so-called purists, but why not? Is carrying your pack really the fun part? More on not letting purist orthodoxy ruin your hike at a later date. The trouble with trying to adhere to rigid orthodoxy is that there’s always someone a little bit more pure than you who’s willing to harsh your mojo.
Pack Weight. I thought we had that dialed in, but I mailed home five pounds of gear from Hiawassee after three days and still ended up carrying food I never touched for 109 miles. That five pounds made a difference. Resupply is so easy on the AT, there’s no need to carry extra food.
Naked Hikers. Yup, but I’m gonna save that story for a later post. In April? Seriously?
My Knee. I’d had some nasty pain in my left knee I suspected was some kind of a tear, but there was no way I was going to ruin my hike by going to a doctor right before I left. Turns out I was right on both counts. It was a partially torn lateral meniscus, but having just hiked a hundred miles on it over nine days helped convince the surgeon that physical therapy (and giving up running and tennis) was a better option than surgery. It hurt, but was manageable as long as I didn't do anything too stupid, like not use hiking poles. Thru Hiker Snobbery. Actual trail conversations: (1) More than one “thru hiker” literally turned away and wouldn’t talk to us when they found out we were section hikers. (2) Another group told us we couldn’t stay at Low Gap shelter because we were “only” section hikers.  Dude, you’re only a thru hiker wannabe until you touch the sign at Katahdin. And 75% of you won’t ever see it in person. 20% of you won't leave Georgia on foot. Get over yourself.
Thru Hiker Magnanimity. Most of those we met were great. Not surprisingly, the best of them were repeat thru hikers or ones who'd done other long-distance trails before. 
A few days into the hike, Brian and I fell into a peaceful rhythm. I wake up early and like to get going. Brian likes to linger over his coffee, but hikes faster than me, especially on the climbs. So, I’d bolt out as soon as it was light, facing down the spiderwebs from the trail as I walked along and clearing it for Brian, who would catch up by mid-morning or lunchtime. We’d hike together after that, telling stories and discussing all manner of politics, religion, work and family issues from our different perspectives, and quitting when we hit our limits - both for walking and for talking. We probably hiked faster and longer than we would have if we were starting a thru hike or hiking alone, but our pace was manageable for a section hike, and it let us meet lots of new hikers every day. 
By the evening of Day 7, we’d made it to Long Branch Shelter (mile 102). I’d secretly hoped to end our trip at the NOC (mile 137), but we needed to meet our shuttle driver by noon on Day 9. From Long Branch Shelter, we'd have to walk 35 miles in a day and a half. We’d done that distance before on other hikes but were ambivalent about doing it again after an already long week. Especially in bad shoes with a too-heavy pack. 
We sat around talking options well into the evening until I happened to check the Braves schedule and realized they were at home against the Reds. Mike and Lynne are huge Braves fans. Taking them to a game would a nice way of thanking them for hours of shuttle driving. A good friend of mine was coaching for the Reds that year, so I texted him and he agreed to leave some tickets at the will-call window. Decision made. 
Last lesson learned: When the trail provides, you take what it offers. 
The next morning, we hiked the seven miles out to Winding Stair Gap, met our shuttle. We spent Day 9 eating ballpark hot dogs and watching my buddy get tossed out of the game for arguing what Mike inexplicably believed was a good call. A great ending to a great hike.",,View Entry,"May 24, Tue",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651842,"A taste of the AT in April 2014 did not satisfy my appetite for a thru hike, so I was back again in April 2015 for another section. Brian was off on his own adventures out west, finishing his quest to hike all of Colorado’s 14-ers (he just finished the last of them this summer) and the ten highest peaks in the lower 48 states (finished during one of our JMT hikes). So, this time I’d be hiking alone. Well, as alone as anyone can be on the AT in spring at the tail end of the thru-hiking bubble.  
I’d be alone on the trail, but not alone in town. This time, my wife Kate came along. One of the biggest obstacles for me completing an AT thru hike is that there is absolutely no way I could be away from Kate for four to six months. Not a chance. Nada. Zippo. Game over.

And the chance that Kate would thru hike the AT with me is only slightly better. She’s a strong hiker but doesn’t love everything that comes along with backcountry camping. Plus, although she was more than tough enough to survive cancer, it left her with some lingering health issues that would make through hiking all but impossible.  She is, however, very supportive of my hiking the AT. 
So, the goal of Shakedown Hike #2 was to figure out how we could be together while I hiked. This time, the original plan was for her to drop me off at trailheads. I’d backpack for two to four days or slackpack when the road crossings were spaced appropriately. I’d booked a series of campgrounds, cabins, and motels for her along the trail between Winding Stair Gap and Hot Springs, over a fourteen-day,165-mile itinerary.  

I left Phoenix with a what I thought was a slight chest cold. A few hours after she dropped me off in cold drizzle at Winding Stair Gap in the early morning on Day 1, I realized it was a little more than a cold and I might be in for a rough time. But I was happy to be back on the trail and loving every minute of the hike. By the time I stumbled into the NOC late the next day, I was pretty wobbly but confident a good night’s sleep would fix everything. 
Not so much. 
After starting Day 3 with a visit to the Bryson City urgent care, I was back at her cabin working on the first dose of a three-day Z-Pack of antibiotics and shivering under a stack of blankets. The ER doctor said to plan on three to five days of that.

Lesson Learned: The AT laughs at itineraries. Second Lesson Learned: Reservation clerks at lodging along the AT in thru hike season may not be as flexible as at other times of the year. 
After Day 3 of the Z-pack, I was well enough to pull on a day pack, so I hiked from the NOC over Cheoah Bald to Stecoah Gap. The next morning, on the steep Jacob’s Ladder section of the climb out of Stecoah Gap, I walked up on a short, slightly chubby, older woman in a driving rain squall. She’d stopped to adjust her rain gear but started hiking with me as I passed, chatting as she huffed and puffed to keep up. Naturally, her first question was, “How far are you going?” which can be code for “Are you a thru hiker?” Though she didn't look like it, she was thru hiking.

Lesson Learned: Thru hikers come in all shapes and sizes. 
She didn’t seem to care that I was only a section hiker but instead was strangely interested that I was planning on going to Fontana Dam that day, where my wife would pick me up and drive to Gatlinburg. Kate wasn’t able to change her reservations in Gatlinburg, so my plan was to skip ahead at Fontana, then hike south from Clingman’s Dome back to Fontana Dan, get picked up again, drive back to Clingman's Dome and then hike north from Newfound Gap. 
The hiker said she’d fallen behind her two companions, wanted to skip ahead to catch them, and would love a ride to Gatlinburg. I told her if we crossed paths at Fontana, we’d be happy to give take her along. With that, she dropped back to her normal pace and I left her behind.

Frankly, I never expected to see her again. She didn’t look she had the chops to make it to Fontana, let alone to Katahdin. But Kate and I got our signals crossed about where to meet at Fontana Dam and spent about three hours without cell signal trying to find each other. Just as we finally found each other, another hiker walked up to me and asked if I was “Phoenix.” 
(An aside – As I was hiking up out of Winding Stair Gap on the first day of this section hike, another hiker asked my trail name, and hearing that I didn’t have one, decided I should be called ""Phoenix"" after my adopted hometown. I had never seen this hiker before and never saw her again, but somehow the name stuck, though I never used it myself. I don’t think that’s how trail names should happen, and it certainly wasn’t a very clever name, but that’s the subject of a different post.)

When I reluctantly admitted that some people were calling me Phoenix, the hiker said “Pokey-hontus” was waiting for me by the parking lot entrance. Presumably, Pokey-hontus was the woman I’d met at Jacob’s Ladder. Kate gave me a suspicious look, no doubt wondering why I was offering rides to hiker babes named after sexy Disney characters, but the two of them were talking like old friends within minutes of meeting. 
It turned out that this was Pokey-hontus’ third thru hike, and the second since she had retired.
Lesson learned: Successful thru hikers come in all shapes and sizes. 
When Kate said she would never be able to complete an AT thru hike, Pokey-hontus replied that Kate probably could, but might not want to. I chimed in, saying that Kate definitely had the chops to do the hiking, but wasn’t a fan of being wet, cold, and sleeping in the dirt with the snakes and mice. “Well,” said Pokey-hontus, “You should consider Inn-to-Inn hiking in England. You stay in nice inns with a warm bed and a hot shower, and they feed you supper and breakfast. Plus, someone carries your gear while you hike nice trails from town to town.”

Kate turned to me with an accusing look of “Why have you never mentioned this option?” in her eye. I’d never heard of such a thing, so I asked, “You would do that?”

“Well, of course I would (‘you ninny’ was implied but not said).” 
And this was how we ended up hiking the Northumbrian Coast Path, Hadrian’s Wall, the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, and the South West Coast Path in England, and the Camino de Santiago in Spain. Those walks were some of the best days of our lives so far. They also explain why I didn't have any more AT section hikes after 2015.
Lesson learned: Always pick up AT thru hikers. They just may change your life. 
The hike back to Fontana Dam through the Smokies was lovely. The hike down from Clingman’s Dome to Newfound Gap was even better, despite the cold, wind, and rain, because Kate walked with me. By the time we got to Newfound Gap, the three days I lost to the Z-pack had caught up to us, leaving me only three days to hike the 74 miles to Hot Springs. 
I stared out at the trail leading out of the US 441 parking area for a long while. The forecast was for more rain and possibly snow, the knee was a little gimpy, and I still wasn’t completely over my illness, so I grudgingly made the call to quit right there and start the long drive home. It wasn’t what I wanted but it was the right decision.

The northern Smokies would still be there whenever I come back.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652197,"A story from my 2015 section hike ...
Climbing up out of Winding Stair Gap to Wayah Bald, I came across two guys taking a break with their little brown dog, a Beagle mix that was a little grey around the muzzle, and a physique that betrayed overfondness for kibbles and that left it a bit wobbly when it walked. As I passed by them, the dog started following me, so I stopped and told the guys they were about to lose their dog.  They didn’t seem too concerned and said something like “go right ahead,” but their dog turned around and went back when it heard their voices.  That seemed like a strange response to me, but I figured they knew their dog and didn’t think much about it. I hiked on.  
After passing the next switchback I heard a little wheezing, breathy “meh, meh, meh” sound behind me and found the dog trailing along behind me again. I could see the guys several switchbacks below me still on their break, so I called down to them to see if they wanted me to wait for them or if they’d call their dog.  My chest cold had pretty much killed my ability to yell so it took a few tries to get them to hear me. They said something but I couldn’t tell what it was because my ears were so stuffed up. But the dog must have heard it because it went trotting back down the trail. Problem solved.

A few switchbacks later I came across some more hikers taking a break. One of them asked how it was going hiking with a dog. Huh? Sure enough, there was the dog again, right at my heels. I explained that it was not my dog, but it seemed to have adopted me for the climb, and we’d no doubt sort things out at the top. The same thing happened with every hiker I passed. They would greet me and my dog, and I’d explain that it was not my dog.  
Each time, the dog would hang back with its new friends, no doubt trying its best to yogi some treats. I’d think I’d lost it, but a few minutes later I’d hear the wheezing “meh, meh, meh” and there it was again. The second hiker I passed had asked me what my dog’s name was, but all I could croak out between the climb and my chest cold was “Not My Dog,” which was how I introduced it to everyone I met from then on.  Eventually, I came across a Nice Young Couple taking a break, with their lunch spread out on their laps, and I finally lost my dog. Apparently, he preferred their lunch to my company.  Problem solved.

Until I reached the road at the Wayah Bald tower. Just as I arrived, the Nice Young Couple caught up, all out of breath so they could return my dog, even though I had introduced it to them using its new name. They quickly disappeared and Not My Dog stayed with me. At the tower, I tried to pass Not My Dog on to some locals who had driven to the top, but they weren’t willing to take a smelly wet dog with muddy paws back to town in their car. 
Some trail angels had hiker feed going on under the tower, and the hosts had a dog or two of their own. As I walked up, they warned me that their dogs weren’t very friendly and that I should probably leash my dog. So I patiently explained, once again, that it was Not My Dog. Annoyed, they tightened their grip on their dog leashes to prevent my pudgy, grey-muzzled, wheezing little friend from terrorizing their German Shepherds.  
Eventually we had a crowd of 20 to 30 hikers and locals at the tower enjoying the view, taking a break, and eating the free food.  Not My Dog stayed close but took his eyes off me while he yogi-ed food from the crowd. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to slip away and de-adopt my new dog. Problem solved.

Five minutes down the trail I felt something touch my heel and heard the familiar “meh, meh, meh,” Sure enough, Not My Dog was trailing along behind once again. Up ahead, I saw another hiker that I’d been calling “GBH,” short for Great Blue Heron, partly because of his bow-legged stride and knobby knee braces, but mostly because of his hiking style on the long climb up Wayah Bald. I’d first seen him taking a break along the trail ahead of me. As soon as I got within five feet, he jumped up and scurried on ahead in a flurry of knees, elbows, and hiking poles for about a hundred meters or so at a really rapid pace. Then he’d sit back down catching his breath and furtively looking back down the trail. He’d wait for me to just about catch up and repeat the performance. This went on for the entire climb. If you’ve ever been on a river trip and chased a Great Blue Heron downriver from perch to perch, you know what I mean. 
I caught up to GBH again a few minutes after Not My Dog caught me at the tower, and he immediately went into GBH mode. For the next 30 minutes or so, Not My Dog trailed along behind me, gasping his signature “meh, meh, meh,” and showing no interest in following GBH’s erratic hiking gait.  
At the next shelter, GBH decided he wanted to take the side trail and check it out, which I think was code for using the privy, and I decided to hike the other direction to the water source.  I thought Not My Dog would choose shelter and the possibility of food, but unfortunately, Not My Dog once again chose me and hiked the 0.2 miles to the water source, where he sat and patiently watched me filter water. Then he waddled back to the trail and shadowed me all the way to Licklog Gap.  Problem not solved.

At Licklog Gap I came across the Nice Young Couple taking a break. They must have passed me when I went to filter water. As I walked toward their resting spot, they saw me and my Not My Dog. As our eyes met, our minds melded, and we could read each other’s thoughts. Nice Young Couple and I had the same plan. But Not My Dog saw their open food bag and trotted over for a closer inspection. So, I said in my nicest possible voice, “I noticed you’d lost your dog, so I thought I’d return it to you.”  
We stood there looking at each other, making small talk, and ignoring the real question on both our minds. Was this Not My Dog or was it Not Their Dog? 
We were both heading for Cold Springs Shelter, 1.5 miles and a 700-foot climb away. It was too late in the day to go further than that and hope to outdistance our adoptee. But they were sitting down and had food. I was standing up and had nothing to eat, at least as far as Not My Dog knew. So, I made an offhand comment about perhaps staying here at the Gap and saving the climb for tomorrow since I had all the water I needed, and wandered off to check out the shelter. They knew they were beaten.  
As soon as they packed up, Not My Dog, probably remembering the nice lunch break he’d shared with them on the climb out of Winding Stair Gap, made his choice and waddled on with not so much as a glance back. I waited for the three of them to disappear down the trail, and then snuck into the Cold Springs Shelter camping area unseen a few minutes behind them. I picked a camp site well away from the crowd, avoiding the Nice Young Couple and their new dog. In the morning, I was out before dawn with no sign of my former dog. Problem solved. 
***Postscript: 
Leaving Not My Dog in camp fifteen miles from the nearest road is not the nicest place to end a story, so you’ll be happy to know that I bumped into the Nice Young Couple a week later.  Nice Young Couple’s real trail names were Fuego and Fancypants. They told me that a hiker named She Wee, a thru hiker from Colorado, hiked with Not My Dog to Wesser. She Wee took Not My Dog to town and searched the local dog pounds for anyone missing a dog but had no success.  After a visit to a veterinarian and a deworming, Not My Dog became “Daisy” and will be moving to Colorado.  Daisy now hikes with She Wee…on a leash.",,View Entry,"May 30, Mon",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654429,"Because I could not stop for Covid, it kindly stopped for me. After two and a half years of hiding, masking, distancing, vaxxing, boosting, and fist-bumping, COVID-19 finally caught me. Or more accurately, I unknowingly stood in its way and it ran right over me.
I spent the second half of June doing some river work north of the Arctic Circle. There’s not a lot of people from whom to catch Covid up there, making it a good place to hide out during the latest surge ... unless there was a new mosquito-borne variant I haven’t heard of. If so, I was doomed. The Brooks Range was magnificent, but not as impressive as its relentless mosquito swarms. 
The flight back from Fairbanks to Seattle was different story. People from all over the world, i.e. potentially carrying every possible Covid variant, fly into Fairbanks to visit Denali and get a glimpse of the midnight sun, a grizzly bear, or a wolf (I was three for three on that count, plus a smattering of moose, beaver, caribou, and eagles). 
Every one of those visitors religiously adheres to that well known wilderness motto: 
Take nothing but pictures…

… leave nothing but billions of virus cells floating through the airport from your unmasked, constant coughing. 
The hacking tourists made me long to be back out with the mosquitos. At least I could see and hear the bugs, and try to take a few of them out before they got me (the mosquitos, not the tourists). On the other hand, the virus is a lot less vicious when one is trying to dig and fill a cat hole. 
For me, my return home went something like this:

Day Zero: Boy, there sure are a lot of people coughing on this crowded flight. (Kate: You’ll get Covid for sure! Me: Nah, I’m vaxxed and boosted. Plus, I’ve got this awesome mask made by Science.)
Day One to Three: Life as usual.  See? No Covid. (Kate: Keep your distance, lab rat.)
Day Four: I think my allergies are acting up. (Kate: Definitely Covid. Me: Nah, I just went for a two-hour bike ride & felt great. I’m fine.)
Day Five: Maybe I have a cold. (Kate: Covid, for sure. I’ll get you a test. Me: Nah, I’ll be fine in the morning.)
Day Six: I think I got hit by a truck - worst cold I’ve ever had. (Kate: Take the test, Jon. Me: It can’t be Covid, I can still taste and smell. Kate: sigh.)
   Three hours later: Did you know the CDC symptoms list for Covid and a cold are almost exactly the same? Fine, I’ll take the test, as soon as I can work up the strength to sit up. But it’s just a cold. (Kate: it’s Covid).
   15 minutes later: It’s Covid. (Kate: knowing look as she backs out of the room.)
   Two hours later: Get me the gun. I’m done. (Kate has locked herself in the spare room. I hear a muffled “Told you.” Returns later from store with bags of masks and Clorox products. And ice cream.)
Day Seven: Mild, brief improvement, then relapse. Mixed despair and intense boredom. Brief joy from ice cream. Started taking Paxlovid.
Days Eight to Eleven: Bad nights, only marginally better days. If your round of covid was like a mild cold, you lucked out. No such luck for me.
Day Twelve: Feeling better, but not 100%. Normal temperature, less runny nose, less coughing.  So I take a Covid test: Positive. Stupid Covid. 
Day Thirteen:  Finally, a negative test.  Done. Must be okay to jump back on a crowded airplane, right?

Well, I’m glad that's over with. I’ll never have to deal with Covid again. Right? Right?! Oh, crap. Stupid Covid.",,View Entry,"Jul 10, Sun",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655956,"Talk to ten AT thru hikers and you’ll find at least one who will proudly describe themself as a “purist.”[1] Most self-proclaimed purists give at least some lip service to the “hike your own hike” ideal, but simply by calling their hiking style “pure” they imply that any other hiking style is, well, impure. Not quite good enough. Lesser. Not up to the official standard. Possibly not a “real” thru hike. 
Exactly what makes a thru hike a “pure” is a bit unclear, as the definition varies between purist factions, but some of the more common purist characteristics include the following:

Hikes the trail continuously in one year. Exceptions might be granted for someone who takes time off to recover from an injury and still finishes in one season, but most AT afficionados would probably agree that deliberately hiking the entire trail over two or more years wouldn’t qualify as a thru hike. Impressive, certainly, but not a thru hike.[2]
Hikes every inch of the trail. A purist passes every white blaze from Springer to Katahdin along the official trail the year they hike the AT. That means no blue blazing (hiking on alternate or bad weather trails), yellow blazing (driving past boring or difficult sections), or aqua blazing (floating rivers parallel to the trail). For many purists, it also means returning to the exact point you left the trail before continuing. Carries a backpack the entire way. Essentially, this means no slackpacking (using a shuttle and/or leaving your backpack and camping gear at a base camp while you’re out logging trail miles). Hikes only in one direction. Normally, this means not hiking back to a base camp or hostel you stayed at the previous night, a common slackpacking technique. But it might also exclude flip-flop hikes (e.g., hiking north to Harper’s Ferry from Springer Mountain, then driving to Mt. Katahdin and hiking south back to Harper’s Ferry). 
The purist characteristics listed above might appear reasonable enough at first, but they almost always morph into a rigid, pious orthodoxy. For example, I doubt that many thru hikers would disagree that skipping long sections, e.g., yellow blazing past northern Pennsylvania to avoid the rocks, negates a thru hike. But I’ve watched vlogs where someone walked a half mile back to re-hike a stretch of trail because they walked on the wrong side of road from where the white blazes were painted on the sidewalk. And I’ve read blog comments where a few people claimed that only northbound hikes are true thru hikes and that SOBO hikers “weren’t doing it correctly.” Or witnessed heated discussions about whether returning to the trail a few steps from where a hiker left it to dig a cathole or reach a shelter constitutes skipping a section of the AT. 
Seriously? Doesn’t that seem like telling someone they didn’t really drive all of I-10 from California to Florida because of the gaps they skipped between the freeway exit and entrance ramps when they stopped for gas? If that’s the standard you want to set for yourself, fine, but implying that someone’s hike was less than “pure” because they skipped 100 feet of the official trail when they went to filter water, drop a deuce, or stay in a shelter seems more than a little OCD and Pharisaical. 
And slackpacking? Many purists view slackpacking as shameful or as a kind of cheating, as if getting a full backpack from Springer to Katahdin was the ultimate goal of a thru hike. I’ve watched YouTube vlogs where a hiker blushingly “confessed” to having slackpacked that day. Backpacking is wonderful, but it’s called a thru hike, not a thru backpack. I met thru hikers on Katahdin who were carrying their full backpack up the mountain, even though they couldn’t camp or cook up there, and thken had to carry it right back down to where they started that morning.  These same hikers could talk for hours about pack weight and all the money and time they spent trying to shave a few ounces off their base weight. If you really enjoy carrying your backpack, good for you, but it’s hard to fathom the logic of putting so much effort into going ultralight and then carrying weight you don’t need for that day’s hike. 
The biggest problem with trying to live up to the purist orthodoxy is that you can never be quite pure enough. There’s always a higher level of zealousness.  I can imagine that the purest of the pure:

Hikes the Springer Mountain approach trail. A purist would not drive the forest service road and hike south to the official start.Accepts no rides to and from trailheads. A pure thru hiker walks every step from the time they leave Springer until they reach Katahdin.Sleeps on the trail every night. A pure thru hiker never stays in in hostels, motels, or friends’ houses, and only stays in whatever lodging fits in their backpack.Takes no zero days. A pure hiker hikes every day. If two weeks off trail negates a pure thru hike, does two days? Two hours? Two minutes?Eats only food they prepare themself. A pure thru hiker never eats at restaurants, waysides, bars, or ice cream stands.Accepts no assistance of any kind. A pure thru hiker accepts no rides, food drops, or trail magic.Touches every white blaze. A pure thru hiker doesn’t just walk past every white blaze, they actually reach out and tap each one (I’m not making that up).Uses no location apps (Guthook/Far Out, etc.). A pure thru hiker only uses paper maps, a compass, and the white blazes. Or even better, they only use the stars and sun to navigate.Isolates from the outside world. A pure thru hiker has no communication with the folks back home, no internet, no weather reports, and no Garmin InReach SOS button.
I suppose true ultra-purists forage for all their food, handcraft their gear, never stay in an AT shelter, never use any modern ultralight materials, on only hike the original AT alignment, not the ever-changing path that has been corrupted by modern life, politics, and office-bound bureaucrats. And if you're not ultra-pure, you're not really a purist, are you?
In fact, true purity can only be measured against a quantifiable, generally accepted standard. But no official governing body exists that establishes what is a pure or impure thru hike, and even so-called purists can’t reach consensus on a purity standard. There are no rules for thru hiking. No referees will throw a flag if you step out of line. The ATC doesn’t even officially recognize “thru hikers.” Instead, the ATC has a rather loose definition of a “thru hike” and will issue a “2,000 miler” certificate to anyone who self-reports as having hiked the entire trail, regardless of how many years it took to complete the trail, whether they carried a full backpack, how many directions they hiked, where they slept, or what order they walked the trail.

Every hiker is free to make up whatever rules they want for their hike. But following rules you create yourself doesn’t make you a purist to anyone but you. I’ve watched YouTube vlogs by self-proclaimed “purists” who stayed in hotels almost as much than they tented (aka, platinum blazing), would accept all kinds of assistance (and were a tad petulant if they missed out on trail magic and practically begged for their viewers to send them trail magic money), or who would head into town for the night if their satellite weather forecast called for rain or snow. I’ve seen other vloggers fretting that they might lose their ""purist status"" because they had to take blue-blaze detour around a section of trail that was closed for construction.

It gets ridiculous. 
As for me, I’ll be hiking my own hike. I hope it will be pure fun, but I doubt I’ll be doing much else traditionalists would call “pure” besides walking from Springer to Katahdin. My thru hike attempt will include lots of slackpacking, shuttling assistance from my wife, living the van life along the trail, wearing clean(ish) clothes, doing what I can to minimize the pain and suffering, taking a break or two to help out my favorite client, and otherwise enjoying myself as best I can. 
And probably, my impure thru hike will include providing some rides, food, and trail magic to more than a few so-called purists along the way. I’ll look forward to hearing their stories and sharing the trail with them and anyone else I meet along the way.


Footnotes
[1] Some purists prefer to call themselves “traditionalists.” Exactly what “tradition” they are following is a good question, as I doubt any of them use any gear that was traditionally available even 10 years ago. It seems like a “traditional” hike would use Earl Shaeffer’s or Grandma Gatewood’s thru hiking gear and hiking style. 
[2] The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) defines “thru-hiking” as “a hike of the entire A.T. in 12 months or less. These 12 months are not restricted to a calendar year.” https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/hike-the-a-t/thru-hiking/faqs/",,View Entry,"Aug 06, Sat",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657441,"I suppose any regular reader of trailjournals.com knows that the AT is marked by a series of 2x6 inch white blazes painted on trees, rocks, posts, sidewalks, buildings, and other structures along the official trail. Following these markers is called “white blazing.”
Many side trails and alternate routes that connect to the official trail are marked with blue blazes. These blue blaze trails lead to viewpoints, shelters, water sources, and trailheads, or might mark a safer alternative trail to be used during bad weather. Sometimes, the blue blaze trails are shortcuts or bypass steep and difficult sections of trail. Following these markers is called “blue blazing.” Blue blazing is purist heresy.

But “white blazing” and “blue blazing” are just a part of the thru hiking lexicon spectrum. There’s also:

Yellow Blazing is riding in a car and skipping a portion of the trail, and is named for following the yellow lines on the pavement. Yellow blazing will get you excommunicated from the purist cult.
Aqua Blazing is boating instead of hiking, usually on a river that parallels the AT. Aqua blazing is somewhat less heinous than yellow blazing, because you’re traveling under your own power, but it may still get you shunned by the purist elite. The Shenendoah River in Virginia is a likely aqua blaze candidate, with at least one outfitter offering trips specifically advertised to thru hikers (See https://www.shenandoahriveradventures.com/a-t-aquablaze/). Platinum Blazing is using your platinum card freely to live large at restaurants and fancy hotels. The term is often used with derision by purists sitting in crowded shelters on a cold, rainy night. A.k.a., “gold blazing.” Pink Blazing is following or stalking another hiker for romantic reasons, adjusting your pace to camp in the same locations as the object of your affections. Usually, pink blazers are men pursuing women. In the non-PC world, the gender opposite of pink blazing is sometimes called “dude blazing” or “banana blazing.” Amber Blazing is leaving temporarily the trail in pursuit of beer, as in “Strider’s tramily is amber blazing tonight and hopes to catch up tomorrow.” A.k.a., “Beer Blazing” or “Brew Blazing.”
Bar Blazing is next level amber blazing, in which the hiker organizes their itinerary around bar stops, effectively turning their hike into an extended pub crawl. Excessive bar blazing often leads to yellow blazing or home blazing. Green Blazing is the 4/20 version of Amber Blazing, a.k.a. just plain “blazing” or “haze blazing.” Purple Blazing is Jimi Hendrix on the ear buds. I’m not sure why an earful of Prince wouldn’t count.
Brown Blazing is leaving the trail temporarily to dig a cathole in the woods.
Red Blazing is getting injured, usually involving some blood, and following the wilderness credo of “Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but skin.” Sometimes, “red blazing” can also mean hiking with a hot temper and/or complaining about every little thing.
Black Blazing is taking a former AT alignment (the white blazes on abandoned trail sections are painted over with black paint). Frequently, black blazing involves a short cut. A.k.a., “retro blazing.”
No Blazing is hiking off trail, either intentionally or accidentally, i.e., bushwacking.
Gray Blazing is AT hiking by senior citizens. Personally, I left gray behind years ago, which I guess makes me a permanent white blazer.
Leaving the color spectrum of blazing, there’s also:
Bike Blazing is the two-wheeled version of yellow blazing.  This one needs a better name.
Blazing Saddles is following the trail on horseback, usually on an alternate route, since horses aren’t allowed on many AT sections.  “Saddle blazing” occurs around a cowboy campfire after too many beans. Night Blazing is night hiking. I’ve seen this term in online discussions, but have never heard it along the trail. Most people just call it “night hiking.”
Silk Blazing is being the first one on the trail in the morning and getting a face full of silky spider webs. What do those spiders hope to catch, anyway? It reminds of that Far Side cartoon, where two spiders have a web strung across a playground slide.  Just before the freckly fat kid slides down, one spider says to the other, “If we pull this off, we’ll eat like kings!”
Sky Blazing is flying or parachuting into the trail. Rare, but it has happened. Would it apply to falling off cliffs?
Bail Blazing is leaving the trail too often for meals and hotels primarily to avoid bad weather or discomfort, as in “Dude, it looks like rain, I’m gonna bail and find a motel.”
Ninja Blazing is passing another hiker unseen while they’re brown or blue blazing. Home Blazing is quitting the trail and heading home.
Cyber Blazing is using a mobile dating app to find couch surfing lodging, a shower, and some romance. Seems like this term also ought to apply to using phone apps instead of paper maps, getting online weather reports, and communicating via text or gps devices, but so far it hasn’t been used that way.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658884,"In general, not much scares me. I love hiking and camping alone in the woods, so getting lost or being alone in the woods in the dark is no problem. That’s not to say I don’t take precautions against real hazards, like not camping under dead trees in windstorms, not hiking across balds during thunderstorms, not leaving food and trash in my tent, or not going off trail in the dark without a light and a map.
But there are a few things that do get my adrenaline flowing.  From least to most scary, here are my worst fears:

Copperheads. I have a mild snake phobia due to so many close encounters with Arizona rattlers during 40 years of field work and trail running (and a few in the back yard), but at least our buzz-worms have the decency to warn you before they strike.  Usually.  But those silent, brooding, angry, uber-venomous copperheads really creep me out. Cool markings though.
Ticks. Sneaky, nasty, evil, little creatures. I REALLY don’t want Lyme’s Disease. I’ll take Arizona’s scorpions, velvet ants, centipedes, conenose bugs, Gila monsters, brown recluse spiders, black widows, and tarantulas over the East Coast’s ticks any day. I’ll be hiking in long pants and long sleeves most days (also for sun protection) and my clothes will be permethrin treated. And I’m kind of looking forward to the daily “tick checks” with Mrs. The Incident.
Poison Ivy. My most evil nemesis. I’m including poison sumac, poison oak, and scorpion weed (a new one to me this year!) in the category. For me, these encounters usually require an ER visit, steroid shots, and a week or two of prescription meds. Long sleeves, avoidance, and Dawn dish soap will hopefully be effective allies in the battle, along with staying on trail and liberal use of my plant identification app. Hiking with dogs might be counterproductive in the battle though.
Injury. A hike ending injury would really suck. I don’t know which would be worse – getting injured 10 miles from Springer, 10 miles from Katahdin, or somewhere in the middle.  A little vigilance, a lot of prayer, and a pair of sturdy hiking poles will have to do.
Humans. Specifically, well-armed, truck (or ATV)-driving, bored, young men who’ve been partying. Bonus points for weekend nights at lonely trailhead parking lots. Avoidance is the best strategy, but having dogs helps. The Doodles are far more likely to give a nuzzle than need a muzzle, but they are surprisingly good judges of character (or lack of it). Usually, their friendly demeanor diffuses potentially tense situations.
Not Finishing. Failure has a way of haunting me for years. Decades.

The following are some things that don’t scare me. So far.  We’ll see when I’m on the trail.

Bears. What is it with the fear of bears in the woods? I’d take a bear in the woods over a drunken Bear’s fan in a parking lot any day. I’ve seen lots of bears in the wild, including a handful of Grizzlies (in Alaska), and some as close as a few feet away. Mostly, the bears just ran away before I could take a decent picture. I should be fine on the AT, as long as I don’t do something really stupid like try to feed one or pet its cub.
Other Critters (coyotes, big cats, skunks, boars, porcupines, etc.). I put these in the “Cool!” category, not the scary one. Again, if I keep my distance and use my brain, I should be fine.
Weather. Like any good Boy Scout, I just try to be prepared with the right gear. Also, another good reason to slackpack. Being out in the weather for the day is an adventure. Camping in the rain for days on end is a grind.
Rocks. I hope to get far enough see for myself, but the videos of the “horrible” rocks of Pennsylvania look like a lot of the Arizona trails I’ve hiked.
The Long Green Tunnel. Bring it on. I love the woods.
Steep Climbs. Why are some hikers surprised or annoyed by steep climbs? The name of the trail should have been a giveaway that there’d be mountains to climb.
PUDs (pointless ups and downs).  Again, we’ve been warned. The trail is what it is.
River Crossings. After 40 years as a hydrologist and geomorphologist (river scientist), I see rivers as the best part of any day out of the office.
Monotony. I managed to find joy during 40 years of office work. I’m pretty sure I can manage to find enough excitement and purpose for six months in the woods.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659063,"After being stuck in Phoenix the past two summers because of COVID travel restrictions, we decided to join my youngest son in Bend, Oregon for the summer of 2022. Originally, we were just going to stick around until Labor Day, but we liked it so much we decided to stay until his wedding, which was last Sunday. The fact that Phoenix was still registering 100+F highs all through September had nothing to do with the decision.  Nothing at all.
Well, the boy is married now, there’s been frost on the windshield in the mornings for the past week, Mt. Bachelor is blanketed in snow, and the trees in town have hit their peak color. So, it’s time to head south and start training in earnest. I’ve been hiking and biking all summer, doing some real-world weightlifting (I built about 200 linear feet of rock wall in my boy’s yard), and managed to squeeze in a bit of whitewater rafting on the Deschutes River, but now it’s time to focus on getting the old legs in shape for some serious miles.

For me, that means daily hikes on the low mountain trails (~1,200 ft. elevation gain) around our Phoenix neighborhood. I’m hoping to start with about 4-6 miles four times per week to start and build up to 10-12 miles five times per week in the weeks before heading east to Springer. I’ll try to bike on my “off” days to give my knees and ankles a break.  I’ll also mix in some free weight work to keep my knees and core strong. 
I’ve got a 25-day rafting trip in Grand Canyon in February-March that will interrupt my training schedule, but I should manage to hike at least every other day during that time. Grand Canyon hikes are usually as steep and rocky as anything I’ll find on the AT, and they rim out at higher elevations than the highest AT peaks.
My biggest challenge will be to work my Achilles tendons consistently with strength and stretching, and to keep my hamstrings from tightening up and pulling my lower back out of alignment. 
I’m also hoping to work in some winter (Phoenix winter = East Coast spring) backpacking thru hikes in the Superstition Mountain Wilderness. More on that later.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659286,"Yesterday, I saw someone ask online how thru hikers get their spouse to give them permission to go hiking in the woods for six months. I’ve gotten that question a few times too, but I think it’s the wrong one, especially if you know my wife. I didn’t “get” my wife to give me “permission,” as if our relationship involves me manipulating her into doing something she didn’t want to do, or getting permission is something either of us need from each other.
Maybe a better question is “Why does your wife support your desire to thru hike the AT?” The answer to that question is that 40 years ago, through God’s grace or dumb luck, I picked the right girl. Or more accurately, she picked me. And then we spent the next 40 years trying our best to support each other’s dreams. My hiking the AT is just one of many examples of her side of that kind of support. 
But there were some things we did to make sure my thru hiking dream worked for both of us.

I didn’t spring it on her. If I just woke up one morning and announced I wanted to spend the next six months hiking some obscure trail 2,000 miles away from home, I probably wouldn’t have gotten her enthusiastic support. But after she saw that I’d been dreaming about the AT for the last 20 years, reading tons of books and trail journals and watching hours of movies and trail vlogs, she gave her “permission” without my having to ask. I was willing to give it up. If she couldn’t support my dream of an AT thru hike, I would have found another adventure she’d love. Maybe I’d section hike the AT or find another of the Inn-to-Inn hikes in England she loves. I’d pick her over any of my dreams every day and twice on Sunday. We gave it a trial run. Kate came along for my 2015 section hike from Winding Stair Gap to Newfound Gap and loved it. She’s always loved road trips and had a great time discovering the southern Appalachians while I was on the trail (ask her about Dollywood!).
We waited for the right time. I would have loved to do this hike in my 30’s, 40’s, or 50’s when I was younger and stronger, but we couldn’t have done it together because of the kids. Now, our kids are launched. The business is sold. We have the time and freedom for something like this. We found a way to accommodate her needs. Since she can’t backpack the entire AT herself, we figured out how she could be there along the trail, without having to do the long miles every day, sleep on the ground, or endure the weather. We went through a hundred what-if scenarios together before we landed on the Vanlife plan we hope to follow from Georgia to Maine. 
Every marriage has its own rhythm and contract. I have friends whose spouses are dreading retirement because they’ll have to be around each other 24/7. They would probably welcome the chance to send their better half off on a six-month trek. I have other friends who could get the green light for an AT hike by buying their partner something really expensive. And we have other friends who have a very long-suffering spouse who just puts on a brave face and endures whatever their mate wants. Whatever works for you, I guess.

Upon arriving at his intended destination, he announced his philosophical victory by declaring “solvitur ambulando” – it is solved by walking.
Augustine was right. Walking solves many problems. High blood pressure? Overweight? Uptight? Writer’s block? Mad at the world or someone you love? Need quality time with your bestie? The price of regular unleaded pinching your budget? Fido chewing the furniture? Cabin fever? Take a hike - solvitur ambulando.

Walking provides other kinds of solutions as well. Something about taking a long walk builds bonds and deep friendships. I’m sure we’ve all been roped into scads of social groups or situations where we’re supposed to get to know each other over bad coffee, across a table, or in a circle of chairs. After a year in most of those groups I can barely remember the other folk’s names, let alone their occupation or favorite sports team. But I could probably tell you a detailed life story of just about everyone I’ve ever hiked side by side with for a few hours. 
Frankly, I think the political rancor plaguing the world today would vanish if we gave up arguing on social media and only discussed our differences while walking along a forest trail. One of my best friends has very different political and religious views from me. We’ve spent literally weeks discussing our beliefs along hundreds of miles of wilderness paths. We rarely agree completely, but the miles give us the time and focus to thoughtfully consider each other’s ideas, and more importantly, to find common ground. If nothing else, at the end of a day of hiking we can always agree that we both love walking outdoors, a good mountaintop view, and something tasty for dinner. Sometimes, that’s enough to keep a friendship. 
Many of my best ideas and creative problem solving come while plodding along a trail and setting my mind free. This post came to me on this morning’s sunrise training hike. The best ideas come on the longest walks and after many consecutive days of hiking. I’ve got high hopes for what I come up with on my ascent of Katahdin next fall. Stick around and see how I do.",,View Entry,"Nov 10, Thu",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659405,"No, I’m not going to tell you how I became “The Incident,” but don’t feel too bad. Our new daughter-in-law asked about it the other night, and I didn’t tell her either. And I’d do almost anything for her…just not that. But I did sit down and write an account of the Incident just in case I decide to share it someday. Like after I summit Katahdin. Or at my funeral.
Writing down my trail name story got me thinking about the whole bizarre concept of using trail names on the AT. How did that start and why did it catch on? 
The earliest thru hikers didn’t use trail names. Earl Shaffer (1948, Walking With Spring), Gene Espey (1951, The Trail of My Life), and Ed Garvey (1970’s, The Appalachian Hiker, plus several other volumes & updates) don’t even discuss trail names in their books. Shaeffer reportedly referred to himself as “The Crazy One,” but as there was no one else thru hiking in 1948 to call him that and he didn’t go by that name when meeting non hikers, it barely qualifies as a trail name. 
In 1975, J.R. Hare edited an exhaustive, two-volume encyclopedia called “Hiking the Appalachian Trail.” The 2009-page tome doesn’t even mention trail names. A 2015 BBC news story about James Hammes, a long-time fugitive who lived along the AT for six years as “Bismark,” states that trail names started becoming popular in the 1970’s, though it cites no source or evidence to support the claim. Not coincidentally, AT thru hiking started becoming popular in the 1970’s, suggesting that trail names developed organically along with thru hiking itself. 
Trailjournals.com has AT blogs dating back to 1965 (e.g., Shaffer’s SOBO journal). Even that far back, most authors list a trail name in their profile.  But obviously, none of the online journals for hikes prior to 1990’s were published contemporaneously with their hike (because the website didn’t exist and almost besides Al Gore had access to the internet then), making it likely that the listed trail names were acquired later. 
Today, trail names have become so prevalent that when Bill Bryson, the most famous AT writer, failed to mention his trail name or that of any thru hikers he supposedly met in his best-seller about his 1996 hike, some readers started to question whether he really hiked the AT. But then again, Warren Doyle has hiked the entire AT more than anyone else (18 times) and has coached and supported countless other thru hikers, but doesn’t use a trail name. 
These days, almost every AT thru hiker, and many AT section hikers, adopt a trail name. Even many of the AT trail angels, shuttle drivers, and even a few trail town residents use trail names. During my section hikes in George and North Carolina, any time I met someone new, I almost always got the same three questions: (1) Where are coming from?; (2) How far are you going (i.e., are you thru hiking)?; and (3) What’s your trail name? The few holdouts like Professor Doyle who stubbornly use only their given names, seemed to get stuck with a trail name like “Just Warren.” 
Incidentally, I emailed Warren Doyle to find out what he knew about the origin of trail names and to ask what he thought of them. Here’s his reply: 
“I can't answer your first question. Trail names became a 'thing' between 1977-1980. I started hiking the AT in 1972. My first AT thru-hike was in 1973. I can think of only one hiker that year who had a trail name. [As] to your second question: I never felt the need to have a trail name. I didn't need an alter-ego for my hiking. My hiking and my practical life were pretty seamless.”

Nearly all the more recent (post 1990) AT book authors, bloggers, vloggers, and documentary filmmakers devote time to their own trail names and frequently include stories of the more unique trail names they’ve encountered. A few content providers speculate about how trail names became a thing on the AT, but I’ve been unable to find a definitive account of where the practice of using trail names came from. 
I’ve looked in all the places I can think of that should contain an account. Many sources have stories about how specific hikers got their trail names, but none offer more than speculative psychobabble about how the practice began.

www.appalachiantrailhistory.org  - This site has tons of great AT history, but nothing about the origin of trail names. www.atmuseum.org – The AT Museum includes a story about trail names, but it says nothing about how or why they developed. www.appalachiantrail.org – This is the Appalachian Trail Conference’s official website, but it barely mentions trail names, noting only that they are not required. www.appalachiantrail.com – Somebody snapped up this valuable domain name but the site doesn’t offer any content on the origin of trail names.
Trail names aren’t unique to the AT, but they aren’t as common on other long trails like the PCT or CDT, and certainly not on the oldest international trails such as the Camino de Santiago. While a lot of Camino bloggers use trail names – I did, and I got my own trail name on the Camino - but I never met anyone who introduced themselves by their trail name during my six-week Camino hike in 2017. Well, almost no one. I met one guy walking barefoot in priest’s robes who called himself Father Joyful, but I’m pretty sure his alias was motivated by an expired visa, some stateside troubles with Johnny Law, and perhaps a little too much haze blazin’.

Among those who speculate about the origin of trail names, the following reasons are suggested:
Trail names signify a new persona that marks a break from the hiker’s former (real) life. Adopting a trail name symbolizes a new beginning.
Using trail names reflect the egalitarian natures of thru hiking. On the trail, it doesn’t matter what you were in the real world, AT thru hikers are their own tribe whose only currency is miles.
A trail name provides anonymity and thus, safety.
Trail names are easier to remember than given names, e.g., “you know, White Tail, the guy who had the TP dangling out of his pants.”
Using nicknames is common to insular communities which regard themselves as different from or better than the outside world.  Think fighter pilot call signs, or high school jocks. 
I think a better explanation is that having a trail name is kinda fun.

Next time: How to Get a Trail Name",,View Entry,"Nov 16, Wed",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659406,"Ideally, the trail should name you. That is, you should earn your trail name on the trail. Bringing along a trail name from a previous hike is fine (like me), but if your next trail decides you need a different moniker, you need to be open to its wisdom (I am).
Don’t worry that the trail will name you something obscene or embarrassing. Hopefully, your trail name will be a little embarrassing. But you’re among friends, so who cares? And if you find a suggested trail name offensive, don’t use it. Just say no thanks and don’t introduce yourself that way. Or, maybe after a few hundred miles and a month in the woods, you’ll not only get used to it, you’ll be proud of it. After all, if people have happily lived their entire lives with real names like Ima Hogg or Fanny Passafeume, you can survive a few months answering to “Skidmark.”

A few hikers name themselves before starting their thru hike to avoid getting a name they hate. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it explains the plethora of Tolkienesque names like Strider, Aragorn, Gandalf, Bilbo, etc., as well as the macho names Sasquatch, Crusher, or anything with Eagle or Bear. There’s a long whiteblaze.net thread about overused trail names that has the line “to paraphrase a thru hiker I spoke to a few years ago: If you meet a guy named something like Mountain Wildman, you know he gave himself the name. If you meet a man named Sh*tbreak, you know that he earned it on the trail.”

Some hikers are in a rush to get their trail name as soon as they touch the plaque on Springer. During my first section hike in Georgia I met a few thru hikers who seemed hellbent on naming anyone without a trail name as soon as they meet them. On my first day out, I had a hiker I’d never met stop and ask me what my trail name was and where I was from. She immediately pronounced that I was “Phoenix” and hiked off. I never saw her again. Oddly, I had another hiker come up to me days later and ask if I was Phoenix. I could have lived with Phoenix as a trail name, but it wasn’t that clever, and I don’t think that’s the way it’s supposed to happen.

Don’t overthink it or jump on the first name someone suggests. The Incident happened near the end of my 480-mile Camino trek. Eventually, something will go down that causes one of your friends to dub you with something that fits perfectly. You don’t marry the first girl you date, you wait for the right one. When the right trail name comes along, you’ll know it.

You’ll know in part because the best trail names work on multiple levels. For example, on my first AT section hike Brian and I met a father-son duo hiking near Blood Mountain. The dad looked like he could have been an offensive lineman for the Falcons, and his 12-year old son looked like he was already a starter on his high school varsity team. They were carrying two of the largest, heaviest packs I’d ever seen on anything that didn’t have four hoofs and long furry ears. And because it was raining, they’d each covered themselves with industrial sized black plastic trash bags. “The Hefty’s” would have made a great trail name for them because they were quite large (i.e., hefty), as were their packs, and they had covered themselves with huge Hefty bags. But they weren’t part of my group, so I stayed out of it.

On the same trip, we kept leap frogging a Brit who had a bright green pack and rain jacket. We were calling him “Limey” to ourselves until we camped with him one night and found out he had been named “Saint Rick” on a PCT thru hike. Who we were to argue with the PCT?

My son “Poppywacker” earned his name from his destructive habit on the poppy-lined Camino. My wife’s initial trail name “Princess” was laughingly bestowed by Father Joyful, a fake priest with whom we shared a table in an overcrowded crowded café in Spain. The second half of her trail name “Beastmode” was added after she started absolutely crushing the steep climbs along the South West Coast Path in Devon. Her name works because is decidedly NOT a princess, and the juxtaposition of “Princess” and “Beastmode” amuses me. But I’m the only one who calls her that, as she doesn’t much like it. She’s hoping the AT provides something better.

Whatever your name, I hope to hear the story that comes with it if we cross paths in 2023. But if you tell me your name is “DJ Corndog,” I’ll know you used The Trek website’s trail name generator (https://thetrek.co/trail-name-generator/).",,View Entry,"Nov 16, Wed",0

Training for an AT thru-hike is different than training for other endurance events. When I ran a marathon some years ago (should “ran” be in quotes…some walking may have happened for a 20-minute period around mile 21?), I was focused on building up enough endurance to survive race day and to not totally embarrass myself at the finish line (alas, an 80-year old man beat me by nearly an hour, and my wife told me that another guy who finished well before me lit up a cigarette as soon as he crossed the finish line). I knew that I’d be walking stiff-legged for a week after that marathon, but it didn’t really matter, as long as I got through that one day.

For the AT, I need to build up enough strength and endurance to knock out something like 170 consecutive half-marathons. And there will be no massage table waiting for me at the day’s end or electrolyte stations at one-mile intervals along the route. Just a forest campsite and the chance to get up and do it again. And again. And again. How do you get ready for that except by showing up at Amicolola with a pack, good pair of shoes, and a can-do attitude?

I watched one 2022 YouTuber who was logging nearly 100 miles per week, as well as 10 hours in the gym, every week for months before his launch date. He hit the trail in prime condition, and was pulling 20-mile days before he left Georgia. But who has that kind of time? Or motivation? 
Training miles suck compared to trail miles. By necessity, most training miles often cover the same route over and over, amping up the boredom and grinding any sense of exploration or adventure into the dirt. On a long trail, every day is new terrain, and offers the hope of new adventure and vistas. Unless you accidentally set out in the wrong direction and have to retrace your steps. Note to self: always check with Guthook when leaving camp.

I think I’m okay with leaving a little training for the first few weeks in Georgia and North Carolina. I just want to be able to get up each morning and walk without pain while I'm gettinng my trail legs. I also want to avoid injuring myself when I finally start logging trail miles. So here’s what I’m doing to train:

I’m starting slow and gradually building up the daily miles. At the beginning of November, I started with 4-mile hikes, with a lightly loaded pack, at least three times per week. Currently, I’m on pace to log 100 miles this month, usually doing 7-8 miles in about 3 hours.
My goal is to be hiking 10-milers, with a full pack, at least four times per week for the last few weeks before I leave for Springer. I might do one or two longer hikes just for grins as April approaches, but I’m really focused on day-to-day endurance rather than one-time epic miles. I’m also doing strength training three times per week with my long-time personal trainer who has a studio on the first floor of my office building. For the next few months we’re doing most leg work (step ups, lunges, squats, dead lifts, presses, and other varieties of torture), with a mix of core and upper body exercises. We’re trying to avoid building any more upper body muscle mass, as that just adds weight and oxygen demand, both of which make mountain hiking more difficult. I’m also trying to stretch every day, especially my Achilles, hamstrings, and lower back.
Finally, I’ve been riding my bike to work and the gym (5 miles one way) for a little variety.

Right now, I’m scheduling one zero day per week for recovery. On our long hikes in England and Spain, we always took every 7th day off. After a month or so, I’d get pretty restless on the rest days and find some excuse to walk somewhere. But for now, they’re a welcome break.

I’m lucky enough to live half a block away from Phoenix’ South Mountain Preserve, one of the largest city parks in America (25 sq. mi.), which has ~50 miles of official trails, and probably double that for informal trails. I can easily get 2,500+ feet of total elevation gain over 8-miles, with some climbs as steep as 25%. Despite being inside the nation’s 10th largest metropolitan center (4.5 million), I rarely encounter more than a dozen hikers on the trails I use on any given day. So I get plenty of variety and climbing on my training hikes, and I think South Mountain’s trails could give Pennsylvania a run for the money in the nastiest rock competition. 
My daily hikes are also a great opportunity to train the Doodles to be good trail citizens. That means walking behind me, not barking at other dogs, bikers, or hikers, as well as the usual sit/stay/come obedience commands. They’re quick learners, with the exception of not figuring out how to not get tangled in their leashes. They’re Doodles, so a certain amount of curiosity (sniffing, greeting, and expecting to be petted and adored) is impossible to train out of them. Weirdly, I’ve discovered that they are much less likely to bark at other dogs when they are off leash (not that I would ever do that 😉).

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659469,"During our long walks in England, Kate & I got no end of grief from the locals about our hiking poles (“Going skiing, Yank? Expecting snow today? Ya too young to be using canes, Sonny.”). I’ve met plenty of hikers stateside, especially the young bucks, who are dismissive of anyone who uses hiking poles (“I guess if you really need that kind of help…”).  The jokes and funny looks bounce right off me. My poles have saved me more times than I can count.
Here’s just a few of the reasons I love my hiking poles:

Preventing falls. There’s a reason climbers like to maintain three points of contact. When the trail is rainy, icy, muddy, gravelly, steep, uneven, rooty, leafy, or dark, a sturdy pair of hiking poles are your best friend.
Knees and ankles. Trust me, after a half century of big climbs and steep descents, anything that lightens the impact of those big steps is a boon. Propulsion. On even terrain, proper use of hiking poles can add ½ mph to your trekking speed.
Momentum control. Too much speed on steep downhills is risky. Poles can slow you down.
Arm exercise. After a month on the trail, you can start to look like a T-Rex – huge thighs and calves, and tiny shriveled arms. A little arm workout is a must. They also prevent hot dog fingers. Snake wrangling. I don’t recommend poking or prodding venomous reptiles – going way around them is a much safer option – but I’ve done it in a pinch. My poles have also killed their share of scorpions and other creepy crawlies, was well as cleared morning trails and dark corners of spider webs. Multitool. If the need arises, a hiking pole can be repurposed as a fire poker, splint, selfie stick, tent pole, weed-whacker, snowy tree branch shaker, guy-line anchor, monopod, doorstop, clothesline, dog trainer, and cattle/hiker-prod.
I’ve worn the tips off my trusty 12-year-old Black Diamond collapsible aluminum poles from overuse and am probably in the market for a new pair. If Santa is reading my journal, I’ll be looking for the following:Aluminum. Given the way I use my poles and my size, I want sturdy poles, and can live with a few extra ounces to get it. I’d rather have them bend than snap.
Collapsible. There are times when you just need to put them in the pack, e.g., airplanes or the Mahoosuc Notch.  
External lock lever. My wife has had problems with her twist lock poles, the most troubling of which is them collapsing when you put weight on them.
Rubber grip/leather strap. Durability over weight once again. Yeah, I’ve read a hundred articles about how bad rubber grips are. I like mine and they’ve lasted forever. I also know that all of the quality brands have gone to foam or cork grips, but a boy can dream.
Basket/Rubber tip. Never used ‘em. Never needed ‘em. Don’t want ‘em.
The receipt. You know me, I’ll probably exchange them for another pair I like better.

If you’re going to carry trekking poles, take a few moments to watch a YouTube video on how to properly hold and use them (I’m working on one for my YouTube channel).  I’ve hiked behind too many walkers who dangle their poles in front of them like Frankenstein, drag them along behind like a zombie, or leave them strapped to their pack like Robert Redford and Nick Nolte in A Walk in the Woods. Those people are just carrying dead weight and missing out on their poles' many benefits. Learn the proper way to hold them, as well as the different techniques used for climbing, descending, flat terrain, and rugged terrain.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659513,"Before any epic adventure, there’s always a crisis that threatens to cancel your trip. Count on it.
We had ours this week. 
Last weekend, Kate had what seemed like a little stomach bug. Nothing serious, just some nausea and aches and pains. By Sunday afternoon, she started having some muscle pain in her lower back and leg. But not so bad that she didn’t come along to the gym on Monday morning, though she decided to limit her workout to stretching and light lifting. Later that day, her back and leg pain intensified, making her think she’d aggravated her back while at the gym. 
Tuesday morning, sitting and walking became more difficult. She’s had back issues in the past and figured it was more of the same, so she made an appointment with our GP for Wednesday afternoon. By the time her doctor’s appointment rolled around, she could barely walk. Whenever she moved, the pain was excruciating. Kate’s no stranger to pain. She’s delivered three children, survived cancer, and had her share of falls, breaks, and accidents. But this was beyond anything she’d ever experienced. 
The GP diagnosed a sciatic nerve problem, prescribed some pain meds and muscle relaxants and scheduled an MRI in a week or so once her back settled down enough that she could tolerate it. 
On Thursday afternoon, her condition worsened. I won’t go into the specific symptoms, but our GP and our son (also a doctor) advised her to go the ER immediately, hinting at a potential life-threatening condition. We left immediately, arriving just before the after-work crush of ER patients.  

A few hours later, she was doped up enough to tolerate an MRI (“it still hurts, but I don’t mind as much”). Several hours later, we got this diagnosis:

It wasn’t the life-threatening condition. Whew!!
We don’t know the cause of your pain, as we couldn’t find anything wrong.
You’ll probably be in severe pain for several weeks, at least.
When and if that subsides, you’ll need months and months of physical therapy.
The problem could recur at any time.

What a crushing diagnosis. Other than the good news was that she wasn’t going to be paralyzed or die right away, the prognosis was devoid of hope. All of sudden, she went from a healthy, active hiker, to a near invalid facing months of pain with no sure prospect of recovery. 
Friday was a bleak day as we grappled with the diagnosis and her future. Would Kate ever be pain-free again? Would we ever be able to hike or adventure again? It also meant the end of our 2023 AT thru-hike. If it weren’t for our faith, we’d have been absolutely despondent. 
Late Friday afternoon, Kate felt an odd rash on her neck and FaceTimed her doctor. “Could it be shingles?” she asked, which presents with identical pain symptoms as well as a rash. “No” the GP said, the rash didn’t look right, though he admitted it would explain all her other symptoms.  Not one to give up easily, Kate then called our son, who thought it did look like a shingles rash and suggested we call our GP back and insist. Yeah, like that would go over well.  Doctors just love to be second-guessed by young doctors with 30 years less experience and people who’ve been exploring WebMD.  
So I took a close up video of the rash, which had now appeared along her leg, and texted the video to our GP saying that the rash appeared to have changed a bit in the last hour and might merit a second look. He called back immediately, said Kate has shingles, and called in a prescription to treat it. 
Twenty-four hours later, Kate is sitting up in bed, walking unassisted to the bathroom and kitchen, and has started eating again. Her pain is not gone, but it is manageable. It appears the AT hike is back on.

Our pre-hike crisis has been averted. At least the first one has.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659583,"I cleaned out my office today.
I spent most of the last 40 years working at a desk in an office. Even though I spent many weeks each year doing field work all over the western USA, the bulk of my job was done behind a desk, beginning back in the dark ages when sharing a desk with a personal computer was science fiction. I’ve churned out thousands of pages of reports about rivers, floods, erosion, and other natural disasters from my desk in that office. That place represented a huge chunk of my identity.

The office I cleaned out was truly my office. I owned it. In 1995, after more than a decade in local government service and private consulting with an international engineering firm, I started working for myself in a converted shed in my backyard. Despite vowing to never hire anyone, I eventually collected a crew of talented, like-minded individuals who loved their work and pushed each other and me toward excellence. 
Hiring employees forced me out of the backyard and into a more traditional office building, though the first one was a cheap month-to-month rental above a seedy biker bar. Our front office featured a huge oil stain on its otherwise bright red carpet where the previous tenant had serviced their motorcycles, and supposedly, a blood stain from a shooting. Our government clients would park out back so it wouldn’t look like they were walking into a bar during work hours. Our next offices were a little more presentable. Our current building isn’t fancy, but it's respectable enough that our clients can park out front.

By 2012, when we’d grown to 25 professionals in four (clean, murder-free) offices, I started to feel the pull of other dreams. One of those dreams was an Appalachian Trail thru hike. Now, I’m not saying I sold a successful business just to hike the AT, but it was one of the reasons. 
On New Year’s Eve, two weeks from today, my former employees/new bosses will complete their 10-year ownership transition. They’ve done an amazing job running and growing the company, so much so that I’ve had time for more and more adventures in the last few years, even though I still work on a few choice projects that fit my schedule and goals. They’ve grown enough that I got an email this week asking if I’d mind giving up my office for one of the new hires – a reasonable request given that I’ve mostly worked remotely since the onset of COVID-19.

This morning, I drove over with some empty boxes and a hand cart in the back of my truck. Roux came along to bark at the janitorial crew and retrieve a few of the things I’d tossed into the recycle bin. Taking down my diplomas, packing up my books, and putting away all the family photos and memorabilia stirred up 40 years of half-forgotten memories of the labors, battles, victories and defeats that make up a career. I confess that I got a little choked up. I poured so much of myself into that place. 
When I’d finished packing, I stood in my office doorway staring at the empty bookcases and the nail pocked bare walls. The faint dust halos where the objects of my work life had once rested were the only evidence of a 40-year career. Next week, a young woman fresh out of graduate school will move in to start her career. Mine is over.

My work identity is now as empty as my old office walls. I am no longer a geomorphologist, a hydrologist, a civil engineer, or a company President. Today, my identity is ""just"" a husband, father, soon-to-be granddad, and a follower of Jesus.

I’m bringing gear. Yup. And it’ll be pretty much the same kind of stuff as everyone else. Maybe it would be more interesting to tell you what I’m not bringing that is on the ATC’s recommended gear list.

Map & compass.  Nope. That’s all on my iPhone. If the phone dies unexpectedly, I’ll follow the white blazes or another hiker.  Or tap out using my Garmin Mini. And yes, I know how to use a paper map and compass – I had half a career of field work in remote places before smart phones were invented. I’ve moved on.
Blaze orange vest.  Does anyone actually bring one of those to keep hunters from shooting them? I think my lime green pack should do the trick.
Flashlight.  I’m imagining one of those mongo D-cell clubs that beat cops used to carry on their belts. I’ll be carrying a headlamp, though I’ve done many trips without one and just used the light on my iPhone when I needed it. Pretty much, when it’s too dark to see, I’m in bed. The headlamp does fine any pre-dawn hiking, midnight trips to the bushes, or emergency night hikes.Waterproof matches.  I’ve never had much luck with those, unless you count using them as damp kindling. I carry two Bick lighters, one in my stove bag and another safely stowed with my night gear.
Sunglasses. Face it, after a few days you’ll have either broken, scratched, or lost them. Or accidentally left them inside your packed up tent after stuffing them into the mesh pocket to keep them safe. If not, they will either be too rain- or sweat-splashed to see through. I'll be counting on the long green tunnel, east coast clouds, and generally walking north to keep the sun out of my eyes. 
Some other common items you won’t find in my pack:

Camera. Replaced by my iPhone, which takes better pictures than many of the fancy cameras I used to carry and it’s waterproof. Ish. Video Camera/GoPro. Ditto. When slackpacking, I might bring my drone for some aerial shots. It weighs less than two pounds, but all my cinematography will be on my iPhone.
Books (including trail guides).  Replaced by audio and digital books on my iPhone. Hmm, I’m sensing a theme here.
Cook pot. My trail meals are all dehydrated/eat-in-the-bag type (e.g., Mountain House) or cold. I boil my water in my titanium cup. I’m no foody and am unfazed by dietary monotony. I’ll get my culinary variety in town.
Dishes. My only dishes are my Titanium cup for boiling water and drinking tea, and a plastic bowl and spoon for my instant oatmeal breakfast. Dish Cleaning Kit. Since my cup is only used for boiling water there’s no need to clean it. I clean out my oatmeal bowl with a splash of hot tea and a sheet of TP right after using it … the bowl, not the TP, obviously. I give them all a thorough soapy scrub whenever I get to civilization.
Coffee Kit. Ugh, no. The civilized hiker drinks tea. Stash Double Spice Chai, to be precise. I’ve got a pot brewing right now. Yum.
Stool, Chair, or Pad. I might give in and bring a little square foam pad to sit on during breaks or around a campfire, but so far, I’ve been okay sitting on the ground. Then again, most of my hikes in the past 40 years have been in the arid Southwest. Hiking on the rainy, muddy, poison ivy- and tick-infested East Coast might require some behavioral adjustment.
Pillow. I used inflatable pillows for years, but I now prefer to stuff my extra clothes in a small stuff sack instead. The air pillows always managed to escape my nest or weren’t comfortable enough for a side sleeper like me.
Crocs/Camp shoes. I know a lot of hikers bring crocs or other lightweight shoes for camp and river crossings, and it is nice to let the dogs breathe at the end of the day, but the weight/utility ratio just doesn’t work for me. The AT doesn’t have that many rivers to wade, and my Altras aren’t that much heavier or less comfortable than crocs.  We’ll see, maybe walking a few hundred miles in wet shoes will change my opinion on this one.
Cotton. I won’t be bringing any cotton plaid shirts, with apologies to Robert Redford’s Bill Bryson wardrobe.

I do have a few gear items I feel strongly about, including the following:

Tent. I prefer an enclosed tent with a separate fly over a hammock, tarp, or bivy sack. I like keeping the bugs out and the better ventilation that comes with a fly. I used to cowboy camp a lot, until I had some wildlife encounters I’d prefer not to repeat. Once, I woke up to a coyote standing on my ground cloth and sniffing my face. The shock was mutual, I’d like to think. Another time, it was the friendlier end of a skunk. Usually, though, it’s biting insects and weather that makes me long for an enclosed dry space. I’m currently using a Mountain Hardware UL2 free-standing tent I’ve had for about 8 years. It’s a little battle worn and will probably need replacement this year. I prefer a UL2 (two-man tent) over a UL1 because I’m relatively big guy, i.e., not one of the munchkins tentmakers use to determine tent capacity, and because I like to keep my gear inside with me and out of the weather.
Shoes. I’m in the trail runner crowd and have been since my 5-lb Raichle leather boots with the steel shank took several toenails during a weekend trip 30 years ago. I’m currently hiking in Altra Olympus 5’s. They have a lot more cushioning than their more popular Lone Peaks, which I wore for several years. I think the Lone Peaks gave me my Achilles tendonosis. So far, the Olympus 5’s have done right by my ankles. I’ve used brands I liked better in the past, but most manufacturers have stopped making size 15’s, so my choices are limited. The Altras are pricey and not that durable (~400 miles), but happy feet are one of the things worth paying for.
Socks. I’ve been wearing Injinji toe sock liners and Darn Tough wool socks for years and never had a blister, as long as I keep my feet clean. Dirt or sand grains between the toes equals instant blisters. And extra pair of clean, dry socks to rotate with the dirty ones is always worth the weight.
Hiking Poles. Always. I can hardly count the times they’ve saved me from face plants and knee injuries. Mine are adjustable and a little heavy, but I’m a big guy and need sturdy more than I need featherweight. I always keep enough duct tape wound around the handle for emergencies, which adds to the weight, but it has saved me more than once. If it can’t be fixed with duct tape, it just can’t be fixed.
Osprey Aether 70 Backpack. I know it’s considerably heavier than the UL packs, but it is soooo comfortable. And durable. And packable. And replaceable. Plus, it annoys the UL crowd, which is a bonus.
Garmin InReach Mini 2. I used to carry a sat phone for emergencies, but between the weight, the spotty coverage in deep canyons, the poor sound quality, and the expense, I found it difficult to use. Then I found the much lighter and more reliable Garmin InReach Mini. It pairs with my iPhone to make typing messages and using map software much easier. The Mini 2 has incredible battery life and seems to send messages faster than the original model. Definitely worth the 3.5 ounces.
Pack Liners/Dry Bags. I always keep my sleeping bag and night clothes in a lightweight dry sack inside my pack, even though I also use a pack cover when it rains. Maybe it’s all that river running experience, but I feel better knowing that I have something dry to sleep in.  I also like to keep my other pack gear in lightweight stuff sacks just for the organization. Water Filter. I am currently trying out the Katadyn BeFree. We’ll see. In the past, I’ve used bleach, Iodine, Steri Pens, Life Straws, and a host of different pumps, and I’ve found something to hate in all of them. Sleeping Bag/Pad. I love my Nemo Riff 15F down bag and lightweight inflatable pad (the big one). Sleeping comfort is paramount to a good hike. You’ll spend at least 30% of any backpacking trip lying in your tent. Make it as comfortable as possible. Electronics. One rechargeable battery cell, ear pods for audiobooks and music, and a charging cable. I think I’ll leave my lightweight solar pad home from the long green (rainy) tunnel.
Stove. I use a little MSR pocket rocket isobutane/propane stove. It works. Don’t overthink it.
First Aid Kit. Mine consists of some Advil, the duct tape around my hiking poles, a tick tweezers, some Dawn dish soap for poison ivy, a little tube of superglue, my bandana, and my Garmin InReach. It’s the AT, not the Alaskan Bush. Help is never that far away. Oh, I also bring a healthy dose of “You’re not 18 anymore, you idiot, don’t do anything stupid.” It took me more decades than it should have to find that, but it’s kept me out of trouble since I did. Mostly.
Miscellaneous. TP, toothbrush (full length), toothpaste (travel size), plastic trowel, head net (in bug season), head lamp, reading glasses, parachute cord & food bag (bear cannister where required), 3 liter water bladder (rarely full), and my journal & pen (my addiction).
Pee bottle. Usually, it’s a used Gatorade bottle. I’m an old man, and tent nights can be long. Having to get out of the tent in the rain to empty the tank is one of the main ways sleeping bags and dry clothes get wet. Pro tips: (1) keep the used bottle in the vestibule, not inside the tent, (2) label it “DO NOT DRINK” in big block letters, and (3) never, ever leave it open and full on the tent floor while you look for the lid.
Deck of Cards. My luxury item. You never know when you’ll meet a three-man crew in need of a fourth for Euchre or Hearts.

When it comes to clothes, this is my packing list. It varies a bit by season, of course:

Altra Olympus 5 trail runners (1 pair on me, 5 backups waiting in the wings)
Injinji toe sock liners (1 pair on me, 1 in the pack)
Darn Tough wool socks, crew length (1 pair on me, another in the pack)
Columbia quick dry long pants (1 pair, not zip-off)
Ex Officio boxers (1 pair, plus an extra for long trips)
Under Armor dry fit t-shirt base layer (1)
Columbia long-sleeve quick dry shirt (1)
REI long-sleeve polyfiber shirt (1, cold weather only)
Mountain Hardware lightweight fleece (1)
REI Down Puffy (1) Light weight polyfiber gloves (1 pair)
Outdoor Research rain hat (1)
REI rain jacket (1, zippered with hood)
Marmot rain pants (1 pair). I only use them as rain pants while hiking during driving rainstorms when its below 50F. Otherwise, they’re too hot. But they make for handy camp pants when everything else is wet and for downstairs coverage on laundry day.
Nightwear – long johns top & bottom, wool socks, stocking cap.

And the real reason anyone has read this far…my base weight is 22.8 pounds.  Before all you UL-ers start the lecture, that’s under 10% of my body weight. But I write a bit more on pack weight next time.  PS – If you think I need different gear, feel free to comment.  Better yet, it is Christmas...hint, hint.",,View Entry,"Dec 24, Sat",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659615,"I did a little four-day, end-to-end, shakedown hike of the Superstition Mountains near Phoenix awhile back to dial in my gear. I hiked solo, but camped one night near a few guys at a popular trailhead where I’d left a water cache along my route. I was passing through and they were starting out the next morning.
After dinner, I stopped by their campfire to say howdy where, of course, the topic of gear came up.  One of the guys had seen my tent (a Mountain Hardware UL2-person, 2 lbs) and pack (an Osprey Aether 70L, 6 lbs), and suggested that I could shave a few pounds by switching to a UL-1 tent (1.7 lbs) and one of the UL pack brands (~2.5 lbs). Had he known that I’d abandoned my Phantom 32 bag (2.1 lbs) and NeoAir XLite pad (1.1 lbs) for a Nemo Riff (2.6 lbs) bag and longer/wider/quieter inflatable pad (1.5 lbs) a few years ago, and that I routinely carry a few other luxury items, his lecture might have gone on even longer. 
I listened to them talk about the merits of UL (ultra-light) packs, cutting the handles off their toothbrushes, eating only cold food to avoid carrying stoves and fuel, taking the cardboard tube out of the toilet paper roll, and some of the other weirder UL techniques. I smiled politely and agreed that I could probably drop my pack weight, thanked him for the ideas, left them to their featherweight tarps, and headed back to my roomy, bug free tent. 
Their crew really did have some nice gear and seemed to know what they were talking about. But they, like me, could probably drop 10-40 pounds of flab by committing to some modest dieting and serious cardio training over a few months. Funny how the pounds under your belt buckle get ignored in the UL discussions. 
Don’t get me wrong.  Pack weight is important. On my first AT section hike, I mailed home about 5 pounds of redundant clothes and unneeded gear from Hiawasse, and immediately felt the difference in my back and knees. Since then, I’ve also consolidated my camera, paper maps, and guidebooks into iPhone apps, and replaced my clunky satellite phone with a Garmin InReach Mini. I only take food I can eat right out of the package, so I don’t have to carry excess cooking or cleaning gear. I cut off excess packaging, straps, and fabric from anything I’m carrying. I have plenty of UL gear.

But I had a revelation one night on a JMT section hike. After waking up for the zillionth time in my overly snug UL sleeping bag and sliding off my too-skinny, crinkly UL pad, I realized that when I’m backpacking, I spend at least a third of any trip lying in my tent. Why would I want to be so uncomfortable for so much time? Wouldn’t carrying an extra pound or two of a comfy sleep system be worth it? Plus, if I slept better, I’d enjoy my hike that much more. 
The same goes for my heavier, but far more comfortable Osprey Aether 70 pack, and for my food supply. I’ll take a comfortable 6-lb pack over backbreaking 1-lb UL pack any day. And, after a week on the trail, the short-term pain of carrying enough tasty food after a resupply is nothing compared to constant nagging hunger and having only cold tasteless gruel at the end of the day. Some pounds are definitely worth the load. 
Not so, according to two hikers I met on the PCT coming out of Kennedy Meadows a few summers ago. They were splitting a 2.5-serving Mountain House dinner that night, while I was wolfing down the same meal all by myself and wishing I had a second one. They also told me they expected to lose 10 pounds of body weight during their 8-day hike.  They probably survived, but that meal plan would be unsustainable on a thru hike.

Of course, there’s a balance, right? One of my favorite hiking partners often carries a little tripod camp stool in his lighter-than-helium UL Pack. I tease him about it when we’re packing up and hoisting our packs for the first time in the morning or when his shoulders start feeling the pain that accompanies many UL pack designs. But when he’s comfortably perched on his chair at mealtime while I’m sitting on the cold, wet ground or trying to find the least painful spot on a pointy rock outcrop, he gets his revenge. Then again, I’ve zoomed past some hikers struggling up climbs with enormous, overstuffed packs with all sorts of extras dangling off every loop and strap. I guess everyone has their own sweet spot. HYOB? (Hoist your own backpack?)

My base pack weight is typically around 22 pounds, depending on the time of year and the number of days between resupplies. While some of you may be laughing at that tonnage and getting ready to educate me in the comment section, I’ll point out that my base weight is less than 10% of my body weight and less than half the poundage of flab I’ve lost over the past 12 months. That’s right, my chubbier years were really just training me for carrying a 45 lb. pack on the AT.

My total weight usually ends up being around 30-45 pounds, depending mostly on how much water I have to carry and the number of days between resupply stops. The heaviest single item in my pack is always my water supply (when full). Arizona hikes tend to be water heavy as water sources can be few and far between along some routes. I recently read a FB post by a guy who claimed to never carry more than ¾ liter of water. That may work in the southern Appalachians in spring, but it’s a recipe for disaster in the drier months on the AT or anytime in Arizona and the arid west. 
You have to stay hydrated. I crashed and burned on a JMT hike because I didn’t stop to pump water on a long climb up a high pass. Even though I drank like a fish at the next water source, I was already dehydrated enough to kick in the altitude sickness, which became severe enough that I had to get off trail. Again, some pack weight is worth it.

The same goes for having enough warm clothes, rain gear, first aid supplies, and a few luxury items that help make the hike more fun and less like a death march. Pack weight is only one variable in the enjoyable hike equation. In emergencies, hikers who skimp on these safety items to save weight often end up relying on gear and supplies from other hikers’ heavier packs. In essence, they’re letting someone else carry their weight.

No doubt I’ll be questioning my pack weight on the steep climbs and be wishing I had a bit more comfort when I’m sitting around in camp. My hat’s off to those folks who manage an 8-pound base weight, but I suspect they’re going to be cold, hungry, wet, and miserable…except possibly when they’re passing me on the long climbs. I’m sure I’ll make some other weight and gear adjustments as the miles pile up. That’s how it usually goes. But for now, I’m not going to overthink it.",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Mon",0

Well, we shall see. I don’t much like sitting around doing nothing when I’m done hiking for the day. And Mrs. The Incident promises to help with the social media stuff. I’ll be journaling regardless (as you could probably have guessed by now), and my videos will likely be short (5-10 minutes), so it won’t be much extra effort. Plus, hiking the AT is such a visual experience, it’ll be quite natural to share pictures and video.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659769,"For all you AT junkies who are wondering how to fill the hours before the bubble leaves Springer next month (not counting the few white walkers who’ve already left), here’s a list of the Appalachian Trail films I’ve found over the years.
This is a work in progress. I’ll update the post as I finish watching the ones I’ve listed and add more as I find them. Feel free to suggest titles I missed in the guest book.

I’ve divided the films into the following three categories:

Films. True movies, produced either by a traditional or independent studio, or by individuals. These films have actors, scripts, plots, antagonists and protagonists, story lines, and themes.
Documentaries. Fact-filled narratives about the AT, where the AT is the central character, and AT thru hikers are the supporting cast. I’m also including documentaries made about well-known or famous AT personalities in this category. Vlog Compilations.  First person thru hike accounts. There are literally hundreds of Appalachian Trail thru-hiking videos on YouTube, Vimeo, and other websites. These videos range in length from a few minutes to well over an hour. Every year, a few dozen more are added to their catalogs, not counting the daily vlogs from active thru hikers. Some are very well done. Others have a more homemade feel.

And here’s my rating system:

*       I’d rather have a root canal. Avoid at all costs.

**      Tolerable, but not good. Find something better to do.

***     Good, but not great. Watch on a slow day.

****    Great film. Definitely worth watching.

*****   Best of the best. Tell your friends.


 Films (in no particular order)
A Walk in the Woods (2015, Robert Redford as Bill Bryson). I guess we all have to watch this one, as it had the biggest stars and production values and was based on Bryson’s excellent, best-selling book. But the film is a little painful if you know anything about the AT. I’ll review it in a separate post. **
Maine (2018, Amazon Prime). A haunting, ponderous story of love, loss, and moving on, set along the Virginia section of the AT. The story progresses irregularly in fits and stops, leaving much untold and inferred as only Indie films can. The movie is not about the AT, but the AT is an important metaphor for its central theme. ***
Appalachian Trail (2004, YouTube, 1:24). A scripted commercial movie about four children lost in the woods near the AT. Not a thru-hiking flim. The film was produced by Bob Jones University, which should give you some idea of what to expect. **
Beacon Point (2016, 1:32). A commercially produced thriller set along the AT between Neels Gap and Clingman’s Dome.  Backpackers, bad guys, ancient secrets, alien abductions, and the scary deep woods of the southern Appalachians. Need I say more? Not horrible, but not good either. **
Dead Woman’s Hollow (2013, Amazon). A truly awful true crime dramatization of a murder on the AT. Horrible script, acting, and cinematography. *
Criminal Minds, Into the Woods Episode (2010). A serial child abductor stalks the AT.  In a weird coincidence, Jon Briddell, who starred as an AT hiking guide in Beacon Point, once again plays an AT hiker. ** (Apologies to Criminal Minds fans, but I’m not.)
Damascus Mountain Time (2020, Amazon). Don’t believe the film’s description. It has nothing to do with the AT. Also, the acting, dialog, lighting, cinematography, and plot are just horrible. If given the choice, take the root canal.*
Wrong Turn (2021, Amazon, 1:50). A horror flick set on the AT.  Apparently, “Wrong Turn” movies are a franchise. Who knew? In this one, a-hole hipster AT section hikers, cartoonish redneck southerners, and pre-Civil War-utopian-isolationists (no, really, and with Scandinavian accents for no apparent reason) clash in the scary woods. If you like the genre, maybe, but for the rest of us, chose the icepick in the eye. *

Documentaries (from best to worst)
3 Minutes On the Appalachian Trail with Jennifer Pharr Davis (2012, Vimeo). Anytime you get a chance to listen to Jennifer Pharr Davis (author of Becoming Odyssa and other AT books, and former FTK holder for the AT), put everything else aside and do it. Davis may be the AT’s most eloquent voice. This short film (3 min) by the Appalachian Coffee Company (note the product placement segment) has great cinematography and solid production.  *****
A Long Start to the Journey (2015, Rent from www.thelongstarttothejourney.com, 1:13). A beautifully shot, written, and edited documentary by professional filmmaker and 2013 thru-hiker Chris “Frost” Gallaway. Insightful, authentic, and touching. One of the best I’ve watched. *****
Jennifer Pharr Davis – January Series 2012 (2012, Vimeo).  If you want to learn who Jennifer Pharr Davis, the one-time FKT holder for the AT and current woman’s FKT holder, really is, watch her tell her story in this hour-long video. Trigger alert: She’s a devout follower of Jesus, and talks about it in her lecture. *****
Karl Meltzer: Made to be Broken (Redbull.com). 41-minute film documenting ultramarathon Karl Meltzer's 2016 successful attempt to set the AT FKT going southbound. Great film. Beautifully shot and edited. *****
The Appalachian Trail - Underneath a Blanket of Stars (2013, Vimeo). Beautiful photography and video shot from the AT in northern Virginia by Christopher Heald, including some dramatic time lapse scenes of sunset to deep night. No dialogue. Very nice short film. *****
Barbarian Utopia: Encounters on the Appalachian Trail (2019, Amazon). Thadeus Lamar’s very nice documentary about the AT. The documentary includes the history of the AT and insightful interviews and commentary by over 100 thru hikers. The title is a reference to Benton MacKaye’s original vision of a wilderness utopia connected by a footpath. One of my favorite AT films. ****
Trail Angel (2016, Vimeo). A professionally produced, beautifully filmed short film (6 min) by REI about train angel Ponytail Paul who finds healing by helping thru hikers. Note that there are several other shorts with the same title on Vimeo. ****
Five Million Steps (1987, YouTube). Lynne Whelden. Considered by some to be the best AT thru hiking video, it is in fact a classic that set the tone and format for most future AT films. A bit dated now, but still worth watching. The title refers to the number of steps assumed to be needed to complete the entire trail. Also, check out Whelden’s “27 Days” about the Long Trail. ****
Walking With Spring. This one is in my DVD collection, but might be available elsewhere. It includes Earl Shaeffer’s poetry, photography, and interviews. Shaeffer was the first thru hiker, making it worth watching for its historical value, if nothing else.****
North to Katahdin (1992, wildernessfilmandvideo.com). Probably the first thru hike video, made by photographer Thomas Hogeboom. Authentic and interesting, but dated.***
Flip Flop Flippin (2014, Amazon Prime, 1:25). Scott “Squatch” Herriot’s film interviews of thru hikers. This was one of the first AT thru hiking films I watched years ago. Today, it is a bit dated, but still worth a look. ***
Flip Flop Flippin’ 2 (2014, Amazon Prime, 1:20). Scott Herriot’s second film made after his injury-shorted thru hike attempt. If you like his first film, you’ll probably like the second one. If not, take a pass. ***
Women of the Appalachian Trail 2017 (2017, YouTube, 0:29). Interviews with female hikers along the trail about their challenges, motivation, and favorite aspects of their hikes. Mostly section hikers. Part of a #ToughGirl Podcast. ***
Appalachian Trail Reflections (2007). This is another one from my DVD collection, made by thru hikers Windtalker and Mom. Good film but nothing stand-out special. ***
Appalachian Trail: The 3.5 Minute Thru-Hike (2012, Vimeo). A nice short filmed to raise funds for a full-length feature which was never produced. The short has great cinematography and is worth a 3-minute visit. *** The Mystery of George Masa (2002). The story of a Japanese immigrant who came to the southern Appalachians and spent his life photographing the area around the AT. This is not a film about thru hiking or the AT, but many search engines think it is. Interesting, but unrelated. ***Appalachian Trail: A Thru-Hiker Documentary (2011, Vimeo). 18 minutes of interviews with thru-hikers about to leave Springer Mountain. ***
White Blaze – Stories from the Appalachian Trail (2018, YouTube). A collection of interviews in Georgia with current and past thru hikers, including Sunny Eberhart (Nimblewill Nomad), author of “Ten Millions Steps” and the oldest (at 83) man to thru hike the AT. ***
Appalachian Impressions (2004, Amazon, YouTube). No longer on Amazon. The trailer is on YouTube. I watched it on DVD years ago and enjoyed it. ***
Southbounders (2005, Amazon). Filmmaker Ben Wagner follows three thru hikers southbound on the AT. Realistic depiction of the ups and downs of a new hiker on the AT. ***2000 Miles to Maine (2004, Amazon). Available for purchase at www.grandfatherfilms.com. The filmmaker interviews and follows several hikers from Springer to Katahdin. Interesting film. *20 Appalachian Trail Hikers on Why They’re Walking (YouTube). A 4-minute film from Outside magazine. Short interviews with 20 hikers near Springer Mountain. Easy to watch, but lacks any kind of “so what.” **
Remarkable Ohio – Grandma Gatewood (2022). A three minute story about Grandma Gatewood’s remarkable thru hikes. Not nearly enough to this one for such a remarkable story. **
Trail (2016, Vimeo). Meh. Filmmaker spent a day on the trail and took some nice pictures. How did this one get on my list? **
Circle of Dreams (2010, Amazon, 0:50). This one used to available on VHS from Amazon, but is currently out of stock. I have not seen it yet. NR.Not Yet Review (check back as I work through the list)

Walking Home – Appalachian Trail Documentary (2017, YouTube, 1:55). A superb film about a father-son duo thru hiking the AT to reconnect with each other. Real, touching, and beautiful. *****
To The Treeline – aka, Family Hikes the Appalachian Trail (2019, YouTube, 1:09). The incredible story of the Crawfords, who thru-hiked the AT with their six kids, who ranged from 17 to 2 years old. The idea of thru-hiking with so many children is so implausible, that if their story didn’t include segments with numerous AT luminaries, I’d wonder if they’d faked their hike. You will see better cinematography, dialogue, and filmmaking in other AT videos, but you won’t find many more interesting stories. The ending is particularly heart-warming. Put it on your must-see list, and watch it with some friends because you’ll want to talk about it afterwards. ****
Thru Hiking the Appalachian Trail Documentary: Hike Your Own Hike (2019, YouTube, 1:00). You gotta love the two NY goombahs that appear in this video, high school best friends who set out to hike the AT. At Springer, they’re walking in blue jeans and flannel shirts, and carrying 60 pound packs, using two wooden hiking sticks, cooking on an open fire, and using the old-fashioned Boy Scout aluminum pans.

Walking With Freedom (2014, YouTube). Michael Daniel’s (Lion King) film about his northbound thru hike. A nice, authentic film. It used to be available on Amazon Prime, not is no longer. ***
Appalachian Trail – Brothers 3 (2012, Vimeo). A 5-minute short about three brothers who thru hiked southbound in 2011. Nice photography, almost no dialogue. Strangely focused on food preparation in the first minute. ***
Appalachian Trail Documentary: Dixie to Maine (YouTube). Another of the cute, young girl vlogger compilations that YouTube was made for (and yes, that’s ugly old guy jealousy coming out there). Dixie has 406k subscribers and her film has more than a million views. Lots of people love her video, and she is amazingly upbeat as she discovers and crushes the AT. I was a little bored though. *** Into the Wild: My Journey on the Appalachian Trail (YouTube). Julia Sheehan’s (Rocket) compilation of 2019 AT thru hike vlogs into 50-minute film. Sheehan is a popular vlogger (40k subscribers, 1.4 M views of this film) with playlists for the PCT, CDT, Arizona Trail, and Oregon Coast Trail. Sheehan is an accomplished thru hiker, but her online popularity isn’t based on her photography, dialogue, or insight, all of which are good but not great. ***
Thru Hiking Entire Appalachian Trail in 120 Days (2022, YouTube, 1:36). 2021 thru hiker and popular vlogger Passionate Nahamsha’s compilation video. She started in early 2020 only to be bounced off by the COVID-19 pandemic, and returned in 2021 to finish the trail.  The video is realistic and Nahamsha is an upbeat narrator and good photographer, but the story line tends to emphasize locations and mileage, rather than feelings and insights. Worth watching, but not great. ***
Operation Northbound: Appalachian Trail Thru Hike 2018 (YouTube, 2021 Remastered Version). A decent DYI video by Bear, a 21-year-old New Zealander’s and his bestie Scrambled Leg’s, about 2018 thru hike. The footage is typical of many hiker vlogs, but Bear’s charm and sense of adventure, as well as his upbeat attitude in the face of many hardships, set it apart. Worth the 1:03 run time. ***

This tramily probably wouldn’t be my cup of tea as hiking partners, but the film is worth watching as you’ll almost certainly meet hikers like them on the trail. Good film. ***Thru Hiking the Appalachian Trail in 100 Days! (2018, YouTube). Adventurer Sarah Williams hiked the AT in 2017 in 100 days.  The 60-minute film is a compilation of her daily vlogs.

Back Into Alignment: An Appalachian Trail Documentary (2019, YouTube).  One more compilation vlog by a yet another cute, young, blonde hiker in tight (and suspiciously clean) clothes. Despite the title, it is not a documentary. The video was not shot or edited by the main character Alyse Parker, an internet influencer whose nearly 700,000 subscribers follow her for insights into topics like shaving her armpits, diet tips, not wearing a bra, and other vital information. Parker had a skilled (i.e., paid) camera operator follow (and support) her and her boyfriend along the AT. Some highlights of Parker’s hike: an ill-conceived 38-mile slackpack in the northern Smokies that nearly knocked her off the trail permanently, trying to hike big miles on a vegan diet, and aqua blazing on the Shenandoah River. After deciding that half an AT hike was enough to get her xi back in “alignment,” Parker quit hiking at Harpers Ferry and drove to her mom’s house in Connecticut while her boyfriend finished his thru hike. **
Getaway: The Appalachian Trail Documentary (2017, YouTube, 1:14). More than an hour of video about a “section hike,” but the two hikers don’t get to Amicolola State Park until 0:40 into the video. After three months of training and two days on the trail, they made it to the Springer Mountain southern terminus, via an overnight stay at the Len Foote Hike Inn.  At that point, they called it quits, hoping to try for more another year. Not much in the film for thru-hikers, but it does provide a perspective on the range of hikers to come out to use the AT. You’ll wear out the fast-forward button. *
Call of the Wild: 2,193 Miles on the Appalachian Trail (2021, YouTube). A nearly unbearable 1:47 hours of Braids’ highly scripted compilation vlog of a 2020 (COVID year…weird to see maskless people in towns, restaurants, and hostels) disjointed flip flop thru hike. Typical dialog went something like this – Narrated: Next we climbed a 3,000 foot peak – cut to Vlog clip: “We’re climbing a 3,000 foot peak. Woo-hoo!!” Over and over. *
Beauty Beneath the Dirt (2012, YouTube). What a train wreck. You watch in morbid fascination but immediately regret it. If you like relationship therapy and crying… so, so much crying… you might like this film. Oh, and they also hiked the AT. I know that because they showed a little map every so often and because a lot of the arguing and crying took place in the woods. Aside from that, the AT plays a minor role in the film. Also, ads every three minutes really destroy any continuity. Fairly good cinematography when they bother to show the trail. Despite the frequent stops for tear-filled sidebars and screaming confrontations, the three-person tramily claimed to have logged some impressive big-time daily miles. Then again, maybe it was a clever parody of reality TV and I’m too literal to appreciate the subtle satire. Amazingly, the film has thousands of views. *
Hiking Thru (2019). There is a podcast and YouTube Channel by this name, but I wasn’t able to find a movie with this title.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659796,"I loved the book. I love the Appalachian Trail. I love movies. I really wanted to love this movie. 
I didn’t.*  
If you know nothing about the Appalachian Trail, Bill Bryson’s book “A Walk in the Woods” is a well-written, easy-to-digest introduction to all things AT.  Bryson made the trail his book’s main character, though its story is woven around the tale of his own aborted thru hike with his childhood friend Stephen Katz. Katz and Bryson were two polar-opposite, out-of-shape, 40-something men who attempted to thru hike from Springer Mountain despite having almost no backpacking experience. Bryson wrote eloquently about the trail’s history, ecology, folk lore, culture, politics, legends, trail names, hiker lingo, famous locales and vistas, the quirky and bizarre behaviors of long-distance hikers, and the people who love and care for the trail. 
Strangely, many thru hikers despised Bryson's book. That could be because Bryson wrote about AT thru hiking the way some travel writers write about places they have visited, but don’t know the way a native knows his homeland. He got a lot of the essentials right but missed some details that only true thru hikers would catch.  More likely, Bryson’s detractors hate his book because he yellow blazed most of the trail north of the Smokies and never reached Mt. Katahdin, but still concluded that he had “hiked the Appalachian Trail.” Regardless, Bryson is an excellent writer who penned an entertaining, informative, and readable book, qualities that are often lacking in many books written by authentic thru-hikers.

If you’re one of those people who loathed Bryson because he didn’t really thru hike the AT, you probably should avoid Robert Redford’s movie adaption of Bryson’s book. The movie is much worse. Here’s just a few of the movie’s most obvious gaffes:

Both Redford and Nolte brought hiking poles, but never once used them. Nolte constantly complained about his bad knees, and both actors had wobbly, aged gaits, but they left their poles strapped to their packs for the entire movie.  Many of the other hikers in the movie used hiking poles, though almost none of them appeared to know how to hold or use them properly.
One of the producers must have decided that hikers wear cotton flannel shirts, because Redford and Nolte never appear without one, sometimes wearing two at once. Redford appeared in (and must have carried) at least five different plaid shirts over the course of his section hike.
Speaking of clothes, Redford had at least seven different outfits, two pairs of boots, and five or six different coats which included both sleeveless and regular down jackets. All of their clothes remained remarkably and inexplicably clean throughout the several months they were on the trail. In fact, all of the actors looked like they just walked out of an L.L. Bean outlet and had decided to wear everything they got talked into buying by a salesperson who had never been backpacking.
Even worse, Redford appears at the door of his motel room in one scene wearing a bathrobe and slippers. Either he carried this bathing kit in his backpack for several hundred miles, or he found the only $40 motel in Appalachia that hands out plush bathrobes and leather slippers to its guests. In another scene, which supposedly occurred in mid-June, both men are wearing thermal long-johns as a base layer under their long pants. Trust me, no one hiking the southern AT in June wears thermal base layers during daylight hours. This affectation, like Redford’s bathrobe, was probably designed to keep the audience from having to see their hairless, wrinkly, old-man skin (just ask my wife about that). In addition to their voluminous wardrobe, both men carried camp chairs and some rather heavy-looking cooking gear. Despite all this gear and pack weight, their backpacks hang loosely on their shoulders like they were stuffed with helium balloons. Which they probably were.
In one scene, Nolte climbs out of his tent to find Redford busy with a trowel and a huge roll of toilet paper … all within clear site of a well-populated camping area … and then expresses surprise that Redford had taken care of business in the woods, despite the fact that they’d been on the trail for at least a week. The trail geography is completely bollocks. For example, Redford and Nolte arrive at Gooch Gap two days after Neel Gap, find and fall in a major stream crossing just after crossing Fontana Dam, meet a Southbounder in Georgia in April, cross open grassy balds before the Smokies, and reach McAfee Knob after hiking through the Shenendoahs. Worse yet, Redford and Nolte manage to get stranded on ledge 20-feet down a 300-foot sheer cliff after falling off an exposed section of trail along a deep narrow river canyon. This obviously-CG and sound stage canyon was supposedly located somewhere in northern Virginia, but the vegetation and topography look suspiciously like California. Despite the forest being fully leafed out in a previous scene, which was obviously filmed in mid-summer, Redford and Nolte managed to get caught in a blinding blizzard in the next scene. The trees in the blizzard scene had mysteriously lost their green leaves. Redford also managed to run into two Grizzly Bears, despite being thousands of miles away from the nearest known Grizzly habitat. Apparently, regular bears were not scary enough for Hollywood (yes, I know Redford correctly identifies them as non-Grizzlies, but they are in fact Grizzly Bears in the film). The only realistic part of the scene is that the men deserved the bear attack, since they routinely left their food and garbage strewn about camp while they slept. 
There’s many more, but my favorite blunder comes when Redford and Nolte finally decide to quit their hike, which happens the day after the film’s emotional climax on the cliff.  Once the pair make up their minds to go home, they get a ride down the wide, smooth trail in a trail maintainer’s ATV, and find a cab waiting for them at the trailhead. Yeah, that could happen. I’m pretty sure nearly everyone who quits their thru hike gets an ATV ride out from the trail crews no matter where they are along the trail, even if they are still capable of walking by themselves. 
I know, I know.  It’s just a movie, not a documentary.  But the errors would have been so easy to fix if just some of the $8 million budget had gone to a hiking consultant, or better yet to pay Bryson to work on the script. Redford could have afforded it. The film made nearly $30 million in the US alone. Heck, I’d have done it for only $2.5 million. 
At its core, the movie really wasn’t really about the AT or long-distance hiking.  The movie is about two men who are getting old and just happen to be thru hiking while trying to figure out what’s important in life. Check that. The movie is about two men who are already VERY old and who figure out a few clichéd truths about the importance of family and friends. 
Which points at another flaw with the film: the casting. Bill Bryson was 47 when his book was published, and presumably a few years younger when he attempted the AT. Bryson may have been having a mid-life crisis when he attempted his thru hike. But in the movie, Bryson was played by a 79-year-old Robert Redford, who was decades past mid-life. While spry for 79, Redford came off as the male equivalent of an aging Hollywood starlet trying to squeeze in one more role as a beauty queen. Redford was always more of a pretty face than a great actor, which has become more apparent with every trip he makes around the sun. His makeup and obvious cosmetic enhancements no longer cover up his poor acting the way his youthful good looks did. Some of Redford’s scenes were so badly performed his costars could not hide their discomfort, as if they were all surprised the old guy remembered his lines, including Redford himself.  
On the other hand, Nick Nolte, who played Bryson’s sidekick Katz, was well cast to play opposite Redford. In the book, Katz was a foul-mouthed, insensitive, womanizing, loveable, semi-reformed drunk with bad knees and a host of other medical problems that should have kept him off the trail. Nick Nolte was believable as a burned-out drunk, but then, he barely had to act to nail that role.  Nolte’s performance was entertaining, although watching the 74-year-old actor walk even a few feet was so painful I couldn’t imagine him ever walking a single full day through the mountains, let alone hiking his way out of Georgia.

The supporting cast included a number of well-known stars – Emma Thompson, Mary Steenburgen, Nick Offerman, and Kristen Schall, all of whom turned in solid performances despite a weak script that didn’t give them much to work with. But the casting agent, and probably Redford’s ego, couldn’t resist surrounding him with much-younger love interests. Thompson plays Redford/Bryson’s wife, despite being 26 years younger than Redford. Steenburgen plays a southern motel owner/temptress smitten with Redford (19 years younger than Redford).  
The script and story line are full of tired movie clichés – family and friends are important, trying hard is a good thing, Southerners are overweight rednecks who drive pickups and are obsessed with the civil war, the woods are scary, drunks are funny and lovable, etc.  Also, there are many characters who appear and never re-appear.  Too much time is spent on these characters at the expense of time that could have been spent on the trail, though I guess an ever-changing cast is reality of any AT thru hike. 
On the plus side, the movie includes some lovely footage of the Appalachians and includes many scenes that were actually filmed along the trail, as opposed to a sound stage in Burbank. 
My personal experience with the movie went like this: I was section hiking north of Springer when Redford closed Amicolola State Park to film, so I had been anticipating its release for at least a year. Not willing to wait for the Netflix release, I paid to see it in a theater. I was a little hesitant about what Robert Redford would do to the script, since I knew a star of his magnitude and ego couldn’t play the Bryson character as originally written.  When I walked into the theater, I was easily the youngest person in the audience (at 54), which, for a hiking movie, included a surprising number of 70- and 80-year-old women. I guess a certain demographic thinks Redford still has it. 
The movie opened to scenes of Hanover, New Hampshire, Georgia’s Amicolola State Park, and North Carolina’s Fontana Dam, which made me want to leave for a hike right then. I wish I had. A few minutes later, the plot got side-tracked with the insipid, self-inflicted problems of two old white guys. I spent most of the middle part of the movie irritating my wife by snorting at the ridiculous hiking gaffs. Towards the end, I found myself thinking about my to-do list and wondering if anyone around me would mind if I checked my email (I didn’t) and trying to guess how much time was left (too much).  I would have bolted as soon as the credits popped up if there hadn’t been some more aerial footage of the trail, which is after all, what I actually came to see. 
Summary: read the book, skip the movie.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659838,"And they’re off!
If you follow Ramdino on YouTube, you know that a few brave souls have already touched the bronze plaque on Springer Mountain and headed north. One of them already reached North Carolina. I call them White Walkers, after the Game of Thrones characters and the conditions they’ll likely face.

None of the bloggers here on Trail Journals have started thru hiking yet. Tom Carrington’s summary says he’ll be the first of us, in just 10 days on January 23. Another eight plan to leave in February, with four more in March. I'm looking forward to reading their stories.
And I’m jealous. 
Sort of. 
I’d love to get started…NOW! Frankly, it’s hard to think about anything else. I’d trade my training miles for trail miles any day... hmm, almost any day...well, not today. Today's Springer Mountain forecast calls for heavy rain in the afternoon and freezing temperatures overnight. Ugh.

Still, my hat’s off to anyone who’s already on the trail. But no way would I want to spend three to four months hiking in the snow and cold. Frozen water, trying to keep gear, clothes, and shoes from freezing solid overnight, trying to find white blazes in snowstorms, no foliage on the trees, icy slippery trails, blizzards, frostbite, battery depletion, extra weight in the pack…I could go on and on. April in the Smokies will be cold enough for this Arizona boy. 
Growing up in central New York, I paid my dues. I owe winter nothing. Now, I like to visit winter. Where I live, I can be skiing in Flagstaff in the early afternoon and make it home in time to catch a desert sunset while wearing shorts on the back patio. That works for me. 
Good luck and good weather to all those who will be on the trail before April. Stay warm, take pictures, write good stories, and leave some firewood for the rest of us.",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Fri",0

Waiting and training didn’t make Sister Maria’s musical list, did they? But that’s where I’m at for the next 75 days. MS Word’s autofill feature suggested “years” after I wrote 75.  It feels like that, but no, it’s just 75 days. 
What to do while I wait?

Gear? I have my gear...used my gear... read everyone else’s gear lists...second-guessed my gear... visited REI to look at gear I don’t need...blogged about gear. I think I’m done with gear.

Food? I know what I’ll buy when I get to Georgia. Not much to think about there. I'll save my serious food thinking until the hiker-hunger hits.
Route? Nope, the white blazes eliminated any decision making about which way to go. North.
Logistics? I’ve got a tentative plan for the first few weeks, but really, the second I walk through the arch I expect the plans to change. Heck, the plan may change before that. It already has.
Shakedown hikes? Great idea, but it doesn’t look like it will happen. I was supposed to leave today on a little four-day hike in the Superstition Wilderness near Phoenix, but instead Mrs. The Incident and I are sitting in an AirBnB in San Diego waiting for granddaughter #1 to make her appearance. I’d trade a hike for a granddaughter any day of the week and twice on Sunday. Except that it didn’t happen on Sunday and isn’t twins. I'll write about the other reason for no long shakedown hikes in a few weeks. 
Blog? Yup, here I am. I’ve also been reading the other trailjournal blogs, and especially enjoying 2Pack’s musings and stories. But like me, everyone on trailjournals is still waiting to start. A few YouTubers are out there. I watch “Hiram Hikes,” a Mainer curmudgeon who just left yesterday. 
So I wait and train, train and wait. 
The training is going well. I’m not logging the longer miles (10+) as many days per week as I’d hoped, but I’m consistently getting out there every day and getting at least four miles with 1,000+ feet of climbing. My 10+ mile hikes have been comfortable but take up 3 to 4 hours of my day. Committing those kinds of hours is tough on a daily basis. I've felt the same way before all of my long hikes. Training miles and hours are nothing like thru hiking miles.
I had someone comment on another forum (TheTrek) that I should be regularly logging 20+ mile training hikes.  With a fully loaded pack. Uh, thanks, but no. I may get up to regular 20-mile days, but not until I’m a month or so into my thru hike. I’m perfectly happy to match the pace of almost everyone else on the trail until then. 
I’ve also been working the doodles pretty hard. They now consistently walk in the heel position, sit, stay, and watch when we other dogs approach, but rabbits and quail have proven to be nearly irresistible temptations. And Gus uncharacteristically took off after a coyote last Sunday after I dropped his leash to untangle Roux. I tracked him on his Fi collar until he came back 15 minutes later looking both satisfied and guilty. A bit more work to be done there.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660014,"My phone vibrated in my pocket just after church started last Sunday. Everyone knows that the announcements section of a church service is meant for reading email, so I pulled out my phone to check. It was a text from my son with a pic of his smiling, pregnant wife sitting on a maternity ward bed.
If you’ve watched our YouTube channel (@TheIncident-AT2023), you know we’ve been eagerly awaiting the arrival of our first grandchild, an individual hithertofore known only by its trail name (womb name?) “Squish.” The parents had kept their non-trail name choices to themselves. Squish wasn’t due for another 10 days, but she apparently has a mind of her own, an obviously inherited trait. From all sides.

Still blissfully ignorant of the greater-than-gravity force of grandmotherly love, I showed the pic to Mrs. The Incident. So much for church. After a few minutes of squirming and literal shaking by the Grammy-to-be, we snuck out the back door when the congregation rose to extend the hand of peace. By “snuck,” I mean stopping at every person we passed on the way out to announce that Squish was on her final approach and that we were a six-hour drive from the terminal.

Happily, it was an easy 36-hour delivery, and Squish arrived healthy, screaming, and stunningly beautiful. Easy for me, at least. The new mom and dad looked a little battle weary.

San Diego hospitals still have COVID protocols in place, which meant only one of us could visit Squish (and her parents, of course, but they barely count anymore now that Squish arrived). That left plenty of time to kill.

What to do, what to do? How to spend a “winter” day in San Diego?

The drive to San Diego and 36-hour wait had cost me two days of training hikes, so I decided to take a quick walk across the I-5, through the UCSD campus, and look at La Jolla Cove from the hills above. But once I saw the steep hill leading past the Birch Aquarium down to the Cove, I thought I might as well include some hill training.

At the bottom of the hill, I was so close to the beach, it’d be a shame to miss a little beach time, especially since the tide was out. Then, at the far end of the beach, it was lunchtime, so I added another mile or so along the Coast Path over to Children’s Pool Beach and the seal rookery, before heading up to downtown La Jolla for some four-star tacos. Puesto’s tacos are to die for.

By lunch I was about eight miles in, and still had to walk back.

I hadn’t expected to walk that far, and consequently was only wearing an old, worn-out pair of my Altra Olympus V’s and a similarly beat-up pair of ankle socks. The Altra’s tread is nearly gone. And the uppers are torn in four or five places, which turned out to be the real problem.

As I waited for my tacos, wiggling my toes with glee, I noticed that I had a few hot spots. But Puesto’s clientele is decidedly not thru-hiker friendly. That is, nobody else was taking off their shoes and socks at their tables to look for blisters. So after lunch, I crossed the street, sat on the curb and did a complete inspection.

Sure enough, some beach sand had gotten through the holes in the Altras’ uppers and found its way through the fibers of my worn socks. Or maybe it had spilled in above the low-rise socks. Either way, once inside, it lodged between my toes and went to work. I had the beginnings of three toe blisters.

I never get blisters. Not anymore. Some years ago, after struggling with toe blisters (my toes are very closely spaced) and repeatedly losing toenails on long hikes, I made some changes. I haven’t had a blister or lost a nail since.

The secret? Secrets. Plural.

 First, buy shoes with a big toe box.
Second, buy one size larger than you normally buy to provide some extra room for thick socks and foot expansion on long hikes. Pinched toes are blistered toes. The extra space will also help prevent bruising your toenails when (not if) you stub them on rocks or roots. Hence, the Altra Olympus, one of only a few brands with a huge toe box that come in size 15.
Third, wear toe sock liners under your hiking socks. The liners keep my close-spaced toes from rubbing against directly each other. I like the Injinji crew length toe socks.
Fourth, wear thick hiking socks over the liners. The second pair not only provides a little extra cushioning and warmth, it helps prevent dirt particles from getting between your toes. I've found the Darn Tough brand to be darn tough as well as darned comfortable. But if your socks get holes or start to fray, throw them out (or return the Darn Tough ones for free replacement).  An uneven frayed or holey sock surface is a breeding ground for blisters. Which leads to ...
Fifth, keep your feet clean. Dirty feet are blistery feet. Those little sand particles are blister-building terrorists. Make a point to take your socks off a few times a day, shake out your socks, and wash or rub down your feet.

Back in La Jolla, sitting on the curb opposite Puesto’s, I knew I’d screwed up. Wrong socks, wrong shoes, dirty feet, sand in my shoes. Blisters.

There was only one thing to do. Call Mrs. I for a ride? Uber? Urgent care?

Nope. Hike another six miles up Mount Soledad and over to Pacific Beach. I needed to walk off the chips, salsa, tacos, and a really yummy but sugary mango aqua fresca. Plus, the climb and view were spectacular.

As were the blisters, by the time I met Mrs I for a sunset dinner by the PB pier.

I opted for a ride back to the hospital with Mrs. I for my turn to hold Squish. Sitting down with a new grandbaby in my lap was the perfect way to end a winter day in San Deigo.

No major changes – I went from a beatup pair of Altra Olympus 4's to a new pair of Altra Olympus 5's. The same basic shoe. Big toe box, zero drop, lightweight, quick drying. Same ol’ same ol’. 
But what a feeling. Like walking on air. 
It was time. No, it was past time. The old ones had a huge hole above my right toe that was constantly letting sand, little pebbles, and the occasional creepy crawly in. The side walls had a few tears as well. Durability is not the hallmark of trail runner uppers, as the 4's were only had about 400 miles on them. But Arizona's rocks, gravel, and cacti are hard on shoes and the tread was almost completely worn off. I had been feeling the rocks for quite some time. 
My dogs had been barking at me to make the swap for weeks, but I kept thinking I could squeeze a few more days out of them. Then a few more. Then I’d promise myself I’d make the switch at the end of the week. Or the end of the month. Soon, I'd promise my aching feet.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660856,"I’ll be rafting in Grand Canyon and off the grid for the next 25 days. So, no blogs, vlogs, Insta, or Facebook until mid-March.* Probably.
We usually do a few hikes to the rim or peaks where there’s some internet connection, so I might be able to post a pic or quick video. But those would most likely not be on trailjournals.com. If you’re interested, you can follow me on @TheIncidentAT2023 on Instagram and Facebook.

This will be my eighth private rafting trip in Grand Canyon. I won my first permit in 2014 for a 16-day summer trip and followed it up with an AZ Game & Fish Science Trip (measuring not-so-endangered Amber Snails) that fall. All of my other trips have been winter trips (1 in December, 1 in January, 4 in February) on friends' permits.
Summer trips are great, but they are short (16 days vs. 25 days maximum in winter), hot (usually 100F+ by late morning and not much cooler at night), and more crowded (more private launches per day plus all the commercial trips and hikers). They also tend to have nasty upriver winds every afternoon. Also, the rattlesnakes, scorpions, and other nasties are more active when it’s hot.

February trips are fantastic. We usually have Phoenix weather (70’s, sunshine) and you can go days without seeing another group. The winter season 25-day trip length leaves lots of time for hikes up side canyons just when Spring is breaking out and the desert starts to bloom. But it is still winter, so the nights can be cold or even below freezing, and occasionally we get a few days of snow or rain. Even then, the canyon views are even more sublime draped in rain clouds or a blanket of snow.

Grand Canyon is my happy place. Whenever I’m stressed, I close my eyes and visualize running the Paria Riffle, the first named rapid below the launch. As soon as I do that, my anxiety floats away and I’m at peace. This year, Kate will be rafting the lower canyon with me for the first time since COVID, making it even better. Glorious!

See you in a month!

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660858,"Cold. Rainy. Fantastic.
I left Phoenix in the rain, escaped Flagstaff in between blizzards, and launched from Lee’s Ferry in below freezing weather. The first few days, I actually left my cooler open overnight to keep the ice inside from melting. 
This trip was by far the coldest of my eight trips. I’ve rowed and camped in the snow in the Canyon before. Snow on the Grand Canyon rim is pretty, but snow covering the canyon walls right down to the river is stunning. That is, once the sun comes out, which it usually does. Usually, we get Tucson weather in the Canyon – think Spring Training baseball temperatures. 
This year, not so much. Every day, the snow kept piling up on the rim 5,000 feet above us. While we had a few snowflakes on the river, mostly we rowed, camped, and hiked in cold drizzle or under cloudy skies. Around Day 20, we finally got a few days in a row of shirt sleeve weather, but most of the crew wore their dry suits for the entire trip. 
Georgia and the Smokies probably had worse weather though, so perhaps Mother Nature was preparing me for Springer Mountain in early April. 
Most people think of rafting Grand Canyon as all rapids, whitewater, and sitting in a boat all day. In fact, 99% of the river is calm flatwater, though the 1% that isn’t is a thrill ride you won’t forget. And with 25 days to cover the 226 river miles from Lee’s Ferry to Diamond Creek, we only needed to row for three to four hours per day. Most days, we arrived in our next camp before eating lunch. Plus, we took six zero days, known as “layovers” in the Canyon. 
That left plenty of time for hiking. 
Grand Canyon hikes are steep, rocky, and lonely. Every side canyon is a potential hike and promises epic views, trickling waterfalls, slot canyons, and magnificent geological wonders. There are dozens of opportunities to “rim out,” which is river-speak for hiking from the canyon bottom to the rim. Even on hikes that never reach the rim, it’s possible to gain several thousand feet in elevation. One rim hike in South Canyon gains 1,700 feet over a mile. I’m pretty confident I kept my legs in shape while on the river.

That said, my feet are itching to hit the AT. The Canyon was a welcome and needed distraction, but I’m counting every hour until I’ll be walking under the arch at Amicolola. 567 hours to go.",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Thu",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661122,"No good deed goes unpunished. A few years ago, my hiking buddy Brian Fry was sectioning the Arizona Trail with some friends. I agreed to help them haul water into a nasty dry stretch south of Picketpost Mountain east of Phoenix. The 8-mile drive in on Forest “Road” 4 cost me some new shocks on my Tacoma, but that wasn’t the worst of it.
On my drive home, I absent-mindedly reached down to scratch an itch on my leg. Is there anything better than scratching a burning itch? Such sweet relief…hmm…that itch reminds me of something…hmm…are those bumps on my leg? Oh no, poison ivy!! In winter? In the Arizona desert? 
Poison ivy exists in Arizona, but usually it’s only found along streams or near springs. Because I am so allergic to it, I keep a pretty sharp eye out. And for poison oak. And poison sumac. These plants are more than a nuisance for me. The merest brush with the “leaves of three” and a rash erupts in all the same places I had it last – ankles, arms, and shins. If I don’t catch it right away, over-the-counter remedies are useless. I need drugs, shots, and more drugs. 
I certainly had the rash that time, but for the life of me, I had no clue where I didn’t “leave it be.” I hadn’t been in any streams or springs. I hadn’t been crashing through any weed patches. A mystery.

The next spring, I got it again. This time, the only place I’d been is in the mountain preserve near my house where I do my training hikes. No poison ivy, oak, or sumac grows up there. That spring, the rash was worse than last year’s crop. I could actually watch the bumps swell into dime-sized blisters. The itching nearly pushed me over the edge. 
Then I happened to see a friend post on Facebook about her encounter with something called “Scorpion Weed,” a noxious desert plant that gives a poison-ivy-like rash. It has a lovely purple blossom, fern-like leaves, and apparently, little nettles that are loaded with plant venom. I’d seen that stuff on the mountain. I had probably stopped to admire it. Since then, I've kept my distance from all scorpions, whether weed or worm.
This year, we had an exceptionally wet winter in Arizona. Wet weather is great for our empty reservoirs, for spring flowers, landscape contractors, and unfortunately, for scorpion weed. 
I got home from my 25-day river trip to a front yard full of weeds. While I unloaded the gear, Kate started pulling weeds. I looked over and saw purple blossoms sticking out of the weed patch she was working on. Scorpion weed! 
We both dropped everything and hit the showers with a bottle of Dawn dish detergent and then waited breathlessly.  No rash. Whew!

The next day, I headed out for a training walk on the mountain with Roux. A hundred meters up the trail I noticed that the entire mountain was covered with purple blossoms. Hedges of it lined the trail. I’ve never seen anything like it. We turned right around and hit the shower again. So much for my training regimen. 
So the question is: Would you risk a debilitating rash to keep training on the best mountain trails in Phoenix or switch to the safer, but boring, Achilles-ruining treadmill and sidewalks? Or sit around atrophying as the clock ticks down to my date with Springer?

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661268,"Are there any thru hikers who haven’t already started?
Besides me, I mean. 
It feels like I’m the only one still sitting at home. Well, not sitting, more like pacing. The anticipation is killing me. 
My gear has been sitting in the garage for a week, laid out in one of those here’s-what-I’m-taking-poses. My to-do list is done, twice over. My training is on track – the legs and knees feel great. Great for their age, that is. The taxes are paid. I have a campsite reserved at Amicolola. I’ve even figured out my driving route from Arizona to Dahlonega, which, to be fair, consists only of getting on Interstate-10 a mile from my house and then turning right at Mobile, Alabama 1,508 miles later. 
So, let the countdown begin:

One week from tomorrow, I leave home. Two weeks from yesterday, I check in at Amicolola.
Two weeks from today I start the Approach Trail. 
I can’t wait.

Then again, I’m glad I’m not camping in the snow and walking icy trails through the Smokies this week.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Sun",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661417,"When friends or family members ask if they can come out and hike with me for a few days along the AT, there’s only one answer: Absolutely!
My long-time hiking buddy Brian is flying out to hike the Smokies. Brian climbs like a mountain goat and can hike all day. I’m more worried about keeping up with him than vice-versa, even if I’ve gotten my trail legs by then. 
But I have a few other friends who are less experienced long-distance hikers and campers. I want to share the trail with them, but their pace and endurance could be concerns the further I get into my hike. Since I don’t start until mid-April, and have a two-week break in July, I won’t have a lot of time to drop my pace back to 10-mile days or less.

But the bigger problem is how to plan when and where to meet them. Once I hike through the arch at Amicolola State Park on my permitted start date, I really won’t know for certain where I’ll be that night, let alone a month or two later. For friends who want to hike a specific section of the trail or who need to arrange travel and vacation time in advance, how will we figure out where or when to meet?

Today, I figured out the answer. 
First, I just needed to remember my priorities. My friends and family are more important than the trail. 
Second, as a thru-hiker, I’ve got a lot of freedom and flexibility that my working friends don’t. And I’ve also got an ace in the hole – Mrs. The Incident and the van. 
While trying to figure out how my college roommate and his wife can join us in June, I realized I could meet them just about anywhere. I simply gave them an approximate itinerary and let them pick a section they’d like to do within the window of their vacation schedule. Then we set the dates for a start and finish, using my expected daily mileage as a target. 
If I happen to get to their section’s start point before their chosen date, I’ll just skip ahead and keep hiking north. When our meet-up time rolls around, Mrs. I and I will shuttle back and meet them for their section as planned. When we finish their section, I’ll shuttle back to where I left off and hike on. Conversely, if I am behind, I’ll skip ahead to meet them and come back to finish the parts I skipped after they leave. 
If I have any concerns about my friends being able to keep up with me after I get my trail legs, I steer them towards sections that have lots of road crossings where they could start later or stop earlier than me to shorten their day while I hike on to make my miles. Mrs. I will simply pick them up wherever they bail out.

All it costs me is a little shuttling. It’s just a bonus that my disjointed trajectory might annoy the purists.  

That’s the plan. I’ll let you know how it goes.",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Thu",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661752,"I checked in this morning.
I flirted with hiking the Approach Trail this afternoon, but it's been raining steadily since early this morning with no signs of letting up. The hikers who went through the orientation with me looked grim – no grins, no eye contact, no hellos, no emotion. Everyone with a backpack milling around the visitor center and the lodge looked miserable. Tomorrow’s forecast is for sunny skies and mid-60’s. I think I’ll wait until then. I've logged my share of miserable hikes. 
If you’ve been following my trail journal you know that I’ve wanted to hike the AT for several decades, and that I’m not a purist, and am a firm believer in the HYOH (hike your own hike) philosophy.  Therefore, my “own hike” has to accommodate:

My age. I’ll be almost 63 when I hike the Approach Trail to Springer tomorrow morning. Sixty-three isn’t old, but it ain’t young either. I can be a tough old bird, but I can’t grind out the miles like I could in my 20’s. My health. This old chassis not only has a lot of miles on the odometer, but it has also had a few crashes. Besides all the usual creaking joints and chronic aches of a 63-year-old, I’ve got a pancake tear in the lateral meniscus in my right knee, am prone to Achilles tendinosis in my ankles, have three screws holding my index finger together, and have spent some time in PT for my lower back and shoulder. And nobody has called me skinny since grad school. Consequently, my hike will move a little slower than what I thought when I first started dreaming about it twenty years ago.Mrs. The Incident. Mrs. I has been the love of my life since she sat down next to me in the lobby of our freshman dorm one snowy Grand Rapids evening in January 1981. There’s no way I could leave her behind for six weeks, let alone six months. She’s a beast of a day hiker, but as she likes to say, “I like sleeping under the stars…four of them.” She’s kidding, but she does prefer a mattress and shower to sleeping in the dirt and wearing yesterday's clothes. Plus, cancer’s aftershocks and other chronic health issues make her a poor candidate for backpacking 2,198 miles. So, if I can’t leave her behind and she can’t hike along, my hike will have to include lots of meetups. Daily meetups preferred. The Doodles. We’ve had dogs our whole lives (German Shepherds, Beagles, Springer Spaniels, Vizslas, and a few mutts). After a couple of dog-free years when the kids moved out, a pair of Golden Doodles (Gus & Roux/father-daughter) managed to sneak in under the fence, into the house, and eventually, sigh, onto the bed.  And if Gus keeps giving me that look when we get to the AT, he’ll be logging some trail miles with me. And where Gus goes, Roux is usually right there biting his tail. Yeah, yeah, I know, thru hiking with dogs…feel free to lecture me in the comments. I’m sure you’ll convince me to leave them behind. Until Gus gives me that look.

Consequently, my “own hike” will need to accommodate traveling with a non-backpacking wife and two wannabe hiker dogs. Fortunately, these days our home has four wheels.  Mrs. The Incident and I, along with the Doodles, have been flirting with the Vanlife since my semi-retirement. We picked up a RAM ProMaster cargo van last summer and completed the conversion just in time to head to Springer.
So, here’s the plan:

Hike north from Amicolola State Park, including the arch, the stairs, and the Approach Trail to Springer Mountain.
Meet Mrs. I at road crossings in the evening and (van) camp as close as possible to the trail. Hike north most days, covering every step of the official trail, but allowing myself the freedom to hike in whatever direction makes the most sense logistically on any given day.
Mrs. I will spend her days finding coffee, writing, providing some trail magic, doing some short hikes of her own, entertaining the Doodles on their zero days, and finding cool things to do off trail. She’s quite good at the latter.
I’ll be backpacking the longer roadless sections, e.g., the Smokies, the 100-mile Wilderness, etc., or when Mrs. I gets lured west to cuddle our brand-new granddaughter.
Also, I’ll be taking a two-week break in July to run some wilderness rivers in Alaska above the Arctic Circle for work (tough duty, I know).  Should be epic.
Hopefully, I can wrap it up before Baxter State Park closes in October, but not so early as to miss fall color in New England. If not, I’ll flip flop and hike south from Katahdin to wherever I flipped. Or is that flopped?

Maybe we’ll find some other Vanlife slackers to hike with. Maybe we can corrupt some purists into the occasional SOBO slackpack (gasp!) or a resupply hookup. Maybe a few “real” thru hikers will stop by to charge their phones, drop off some trash, and chat with Mrs. I. She’s a gem and they’d be missing out if they didn’t.

Regardless, that’s what I expect my hike to look like. I can’t wait to get started...er, I guess I can wait, at least until it stops raining. I’m pretty sure this will be the last time I see rain before Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Sat",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661839,"Spring had sprung when I showed up this morning at the iconic Approach Trail arch at Amicolola Falls State Park. Mountain violets, azalea, and various trees and flowers this Arizona boy didn’t recognize were blooming. Most of the deciduous trees already had their leaves.
At the top of the stairs, Spring was a little further behind. And the further up I climbed toward Springer, the further out of Spring I walked. I’d hoped to see the last vestiges of Winter slowly disappear as I hiked through Georgia and North Carolina, so today’s bare branches and brown hillslopes along the Approach Trail were a welcome sight. 
So was the sun. Campers along the Approach trail still had their tents up when I passed at 11:00 am, with an overstuffed clothesline hanging low with soggy socks, pants, shirts, and sleeping bags flapping in the breeze. I talked to one hiker who had planned to start yesterday, but took one look at the rain forecast and spent the afternoon and night in his car outside the Visitor’s Center.

Just finding the Arch was a bit of a challenge due to construction. Funny, none of the videos and photos of hikers at the arch I’ve seen this season showed the chain link fences and the bulldozed mess all around the Arch. Maybe Facebook pics don’t tell the whole story. Who knew?

Also, don’t believe the Approach Trail horror stories. 
The stairs aren’t easy, but they’re no worse than 600 stairs anywhere else. And the view from the stairs is so much better than some of the high-rise stairwells I’ve trained in. After the stairs, the climb out of Amicolola State Park was steep, but it leveled out after a few miles. Most of it was a lovely walk in the woods. 
The hiker registration portal indicated that 19 thru hikers were starting with me, with almost double that number the day before. But I saw less than 10 possible thru hikers, and twice that many day hikers. Not bad for a holiday weekend. I hiked alone and out of sight of any human for 99 percent of the day. So much for rumors of trail crowding.

I stopped and chatted with nearly everyone I passed. Most were friendly, a few were not. 
Just before the Springer summit, I came up on an older gentleman sitting in the middle of the trail underneath a huge backpack. He struggled to stand up as I approached, nearly falling over with the weight of his pack. I stopped and asked how his day was going, but got nothing more than “Fine.” Something seemed off, so I asked again if he was okay, but he replied “See you later.” Thinking I’d been dismissed, so I hiked on. 
Five minutes later an ATC Ridge Runner coming down the trail asked if I’d seen a hiker in distress. I described the old guy I just passed and he hustled off in that direction. When I came down to the parking lot after the Springer summit, five emergency vehicles pulled up, two of which had ATV’s in trailers. Uh oh.

Mrs. The Incident and I had planned to camp at the Springer parking lot, so we spent the next five hours watching the (non)drama unfold. The ATV’s were never unloaded, a few EMT’s hiked up the trail, and apparently the old guy recovered enough to hike in without too much assistance, though he rode down the mountain in an ambulance. His hike is probably over. 
I also got my first trail magic after leaving Springer summit. Josie (YouTube: Olive’s Oyster – named for her Boston Terrier Olive) handed me a chocolate Easter egg after finding out I was thru hiking. Josie is Prius-camping the AT this year – hiking a bit at each gap and doing some low-key trail magic. 
We walked into the Springer parking area together, so I invited her and Olive over to meet Mrs. I and play with the Doodles. We all sat and enjoyed the sunshine and the EMT drama for a few hours. 
We also met a thru-hiking family with three preschool-aged children. Both parents had HUGE packs. Plus, mom was carrying the littlest one. The two other kids had tiny packs. One of the kids wanted to hike barefoot, but his dad said he could only do that a mile or so per day until his feet got stronger. I can’t imagine. They finally packed up and hiked out around 4:30, intending to do four miles before dark. 
Josie eventually said goodbye and drove off to the next gap, and we took advantage of the poor cell coverage and managed a short nap before dinner.  
I’m hoping for an early start tomorrow and an 11-mile day to Cooper Gap.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661866,"The cold woke me before the sun. The dogs had wedged themselves into a warm spot, pulling the quilt off my backside. I can ignore a cold behind for only so long and wrestling the blanket back from two very comfortable doodles killed any chance of going back to sleep. Plus, it was already 6:45 am. I rarely sleep past 5:00 am at home. I guess the time change and late sunrises are gifts.
We had camped at the Springer Mountain parking area, right on the trail, so after a quick breakfast I headed out with Roux. Gus is still nursing his broken claw (toenail?), so he missed his turn to hike with me. And by nursing, I mean incessantly licking.

Last night, I tried to fix his claw with Superglue, but ended up getting making a mess of the hair on his foot and almost gluing his toes together. Before you contact the SPCA, I’ve used Superglue on my own cuts many times. It’s a miracle cure and will always live in my first aid kit. Gus was much better this morning, but probably needs a few more days of rest before testing his claws out on the rocks and mud.

Speaking of the doodles and the SPCA, our dogs are bomber hikers. They literally beg us to go hiking. If they so much as hear mebump into one of their leashes, they are up and pawing at the door. Roux may be more excited about hiking the AT than me. Her trail blog reads: “That pokey old man was ahead of me again all day. He never gets out of the way!!”

They are also obedience trained, and walk in the heel position slightly behind me on the trail, at least as long as I keep reminding them. They also wear tracking collars, as well as an obedience collar that allows me to give them a beep or a vibration if they forget to pay attention to my commands.  And I have a pocket full of dog treats to reward them periodically for obeying. 
And yes, they will be mostly off leash along the AT. Technically, they are being off-leash trained, which is legal in most jurisdictions. I leash them up near road crossings, when we encounter other dogs, or if we come up on a crowd of hikers, especially if they are eating. The hikers, not the doodles. The doodles have yogi-ing down to a science, so letting them loose near someone else’s food is never a good idea. 
Ok, back to today’s hike. I’m trying to keep my daily mileage low for the first few weeks. For me that means 8-12 miles. Today’s walk was 11.3 miles, with a few decent climbs and descents. The Achilles and knees felt great. I was tired for the last steep climb before Cooper Gap, but only in a good way. I really wanted to hike a few more hours, especially since I got in just after noon, but I’m trying to be smart. 
I passed more thru hikers on the trail today. I had nice chats with Drewby (sp?) from Baltimore, Doggone and 13 who met on the PCT last year and who have a triple crown between them, Walmart who is hiking his 5th consecutive AT thru hike, Steve who was out of water (which we took care of), as well as a few others whose names escape me. Remembering names is definitely not my forte. There was a fairly steady stream of hikers passing through Cooper Gap in the early afternoon, probably 5 or so per hour, but it slowed to a trickle. Still, I wouldn’t call the trail over-crowded, or even crowded. 
Drewby filled me in on the hiker “rescue” on Springer yesterday – the old guy walked with assistance to the trailhead and took an ambulance ride down the mountain. What a pity. 
I did not see the family with the preschoolers during my hike, but I passed quite a few still-zipped-up tents during between 7:30 and 10:30. Any one of them could have been theirs. And then, at nearly 6:00 pm, they all came walking through Cooper Gap on their way to Justus Creek. The dad said they were pretty tired, but they looked happy. 
Alas, Prius-camping Josie was not at any of the Gaps today.

All in all, today was a perfect day for hiking – a bluebird sky, a slight breeze, frosty morning temperatures, a slightly chilly afternoon, and the first signs of spring. I saw my first trillium and buttercup blooms, plus lots of star chickweed. 
It just doesn't get any better than this.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661896,"Another short day - 8.2 miles with no significant climbs. Today’s section from Cooper Gap to Woody Gap offered some spectacular mountaintop overlooks, lovely creekside walks, and my favorite: side-slope trails through early spring woods.
But there wasn’t enough of it. I hiked into Woody Gap just after 11:00 am, well before Mrs. The Incident finished running her resupply errands in Dahlonega. Fortunately, Verizon’s coverage at Woody Gap was better than any of the other Gaps we’ve stayed in, so I had a chance to catch up on emails and the news. Only three days in and work emails have become nearly irrelevant. Remind me again why I care about the news?

We’ll boondock at Woody Gap tonight. Camping at road crossing trailheads lets me stay connected to the trail and hike out early each morning. I hope we can keep it up.

But most of the Gaps have been in deep, wooded valleys. They are beautiful, but relatively secluded. Woody Gap, however, is located in a high pass between two mountains and offers amazing views of the Appalachian valleys below. It also has a moderately busy paved road that brings travelers to the parking area.

Because I’m keeping the mileage low this first week, we get to spend our long, post-hike afternoons sitting outside the van with the doodles, watching the hikers and tourists come and go. 
The tourists pull in, take a picture from the overlook, and move on. Most of them are polite, clean, and more than a little bewildered by the clusters of dirty hikers lounging on the grass beside their huge backpacks. Most tourists give the hiker trash the same level of attention they’d give the homeless on streets of their hometown.  

Once in a while, a tourist will walk up to a cluster of hiker trash to ask a question, like “Where are you all going?” A few approach wanting to share their knowledge of the AT, or to say that their cousin Fred or a crazy guy from work tried to thru hike last year. The hikers give them the same level of attention the homeless give outsiders who walk down their street. Once they figure out that no food is forthcoming, they lose interest and keep to themselves.

The hikers trickle in alone or in groups of two or three. It is still too early for tramilies (trail families) to have formed. As the hikers arrive, they accordion up in small groups, sitting close enough to talk to each other, but far enough apart to not intrude. Conversations seem to be limited to hiker small talk – Where’d you start? Where are you going? How is your hike going?

These questions have double meanings, intended to ferret out thru hikers from section hikers, as they don’t look or smell that different yet. But honestly, the ATC thru hiker tags seem to do the sorting without having ask any questions. The questions also help identify potentially compatible hiker partners. 
If that goes well, they might venture into something more personal – Where are you from? What kind of work did you do? How did you manage to get six months off to hike the AT? Still small talk, but honing in on the question of compatibility. If no connections form, the hikers move on alone. But sometimes, hikers leave with someone new.
The interactions have all the tensions of my high school freshmen mixer dance, though to a much lesser degree, and much less awkward or mean. Still, there’s the cool crowd, the stoners, the jocks (uber hikers), the rich kids, the poor kids, the geeks, and the weirdos, each with their identifying types of gear, clothes and haircuts. There’s also been a few scary folks who looked like they just got out of juvie – who let them in? 
Just like at that first dance, everyone seems a little nervous, unsure of themselves, and hesitant to reach out. Also, I think we’re all wondering who of us is going to make to Katahdin. 
As for me, I’ll talk to anyone on the trail, even that scary guy with the bad teeth and the face tattoos. I have no idea who’ll be climbing Katahdin, or even if I will. I hope so, but it’s a long, long way from Woody Gap to the Birches Campsite at the foot of Mt. K. 
I have the feeling that two weeks from now, we’ll all recognize a lot more faces and will be more of a community. For now, the tentative dance of thru hikers and tourists is the view from the gap.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661961,"Blood Mountain is the Georgia AT’s big dog. It’s named for a (locally) famous Indian battle after which its streams supposedly ran red with blood. Ew. More to the point, it’s the highest point on the AT in Georgia. The 5-mile climb gains just under 2,000 feet with an average grade of 10%. The last mile gains about 800 feet (~15%). The mountain also boasts some of the most troublesome bears in Georgia. If you camp in the Blood Mountain Wilderness, you have to carry a bear-proof food cannister.
Not coincidentally, about 10% of AT thru-hiker wannabees drop out at Neel’s Gap, the first road crossing after Blood Mountain. 
For me, my climb up Blood Mountain came at the end of my day, boosting the difficulty a little. But frankly, it wasn’t as steep and punishing as my training loop back home. Plus, the AT is a whole lot softer on the feet than the rocky trails I use in Phoenix. The descent was tougher than the climb, and my Achilles tendons were barking by the time I climbed back down to Neels Gap. 
The views made the climb worthwhile. I’ve heard that on a clear day you can see Atlanta from the peak. I’ve been to Atlanta, so given today’s clear skies, I looked the other way. The tree-covered southern Appalachian vistas I took in were spectacular. 
I only saw three thru hikers on the trail today. None of them were particularly friendly and none offered more than the most perfunctory responses to my greetings. I blame headphones for the first one, and the potentially creepy old man/skittish young woman dynamic for the other. The third was someone I met yesterday, and he’s just not a talker. The encounters left me a little depressed and lonely. 
I passed the first two at the start of the 5-mile climb out the Lance Creek Restoration Area. I might have been a little amped up because I’d just seen an incredibly colorful pileated woodpecker and a huge grove of giant white trillium. Perhaps my enthusiasm was a little off-putting. Do trillium grow in groves? The point is, there were acres of them. 
The hikers leapfrogged me after I stopped to take a break. When I started hiking again, I found a knit hat on the trail, so I hurried along to catch them. Headphone guy said it wasn’t his. When I caught Ms. Skittish said she thought she knew who it belonged to and that she had carried it for a while, but didn’t really care if it fell out. But then she took it from me and stuffed it into the same too-small pouch on her hip belt she'd used before. Well, I wasn’t going to fight her for it, but I’m pretty sure Ms. Skittish’s friend will have a cold head tonight.

The Georgia Mountain Hiking Club was climbing the other, steeper side of Blood Mountain as I was descending. Their demographic matches mine, and I found them to be friendlier than the morning’s thru-hiker crowd. The last bunch of them I passed stopped me to ask about Roux, so we chatted about dogs, the weather, and our respective hikes.

Then one of the ladies asked me if I did something special “to make my hair so thick and lustrous.” I laughed out loud. I haven’t used a comb or brush on my hair in decades. My choice of shampoo is whatever brand Mrs. The Incident doesn’t want anymore and has left in the shower. 
Sure, if by “special” you mean not washing it for a week. In fact, not wanting to waste the water I’d poured into Roux’s dish atop Blood Mountain, I’d just poured her drool-y leftovers on my head to cool off. Maybe I’ve stumbled onto a secret hair tonic formula – doodle drool. Her hiking companion’s dome was of the shiny variety, so perhaps it was just the relative difference that caught her attention. He laughed along, saying he was considering a hair transplant from his ears. (For the younger readers, bizarrely fast-growing ear hair is coming for you. Just wait.) 
I chuckled over that the rest of the way down to Neels Gap. 
A crowd of 20 hikers milled about the deck at Mountain Crossings, the outfitter store at Neels Gap. As I walked up, I saw many of the same faces I’d seen at the Gaps over the past three days. Tramilies are starting to form and people were clustered up. 
Walmart saw me and called out, “Hey, Incident! Welcome.” And for the first time on the trail, I felt like I belonged.

It was a good day.

I remember stubbing it on a root (I swear that root jumped up to get me), but hardly for the first time on this hike. Let’s hope its not broken. I’ll be soaking it in the creek we’re camped by tonight.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662019,"I spent much of today’s 6.9 mile “nero” hike thinking about why I blog. But the trail seemed bent on distracting me with trail magic.
I walked into some traditional trail magic at Tesnatee Gap where “King Tut” and his friend were set up with tables of treats, coffee, and cold drinks. I grabbed a donut and some hot chocolate, but passed on the quick-drying backpacker towels and knit hats King Tut was demo-ing. New gear is new weight.

But the trail had some better magic in store for me. After the big climb out of Neels Gap, I walked up on Ms. Skittish from yesterday who smiled and waved after recognizing my dog. In fact, it was Gus, not Roux (who seems to have gotten the trail name “Rex,” but that’s beside the point). Ms. Now-Not-So-Skittish was with two friends this morning. We chatted about my dog, laughed about yesterday’s hat rescue (it was delivered to its owner), and today’s destinations. A much different experience than yesterday.

Then, when I stopped at King Tut’s trail magic, I saw Quiet Guy and Headphone Guy in the small crowd. Quiet Guy, who’s name turns out to be Will, gave me a quiet nod as I walked in, so I introduced myself by saying that I thought we’d seen each other for a few days in a row. Will said yeah, but he kept thinking I’d left the trail every time he saw me climb into our van. He’s a nice guy, but definitely a quiet one. 
Flush with success, I went and sat next to Headphone Guy. His trail name is “Ad Astra” (to the stars) which is the first half of the Kansas State Motto. I think you can guess where he’s from. He’s also not a big talker, but he was curious about the story behind “The Incident” (and no, I did not tell him the story). I think he and Will could be trail buddies. 
I also ran across Steve this morning, who we watered up at Cooper Gap after he hiked in nearly dehydrated on Day 2. Steve is now “Bushwack” and is hiking with Banshee and (no name yet), two hikers I’d met a few days ago. Mrs. I was disappointed to learn that “Thirsty Steve” hadn’t stuck as his trail name. 
I think the trail sent me all this magic to tell me to be patient. Just like at the freshmen mixer.

Also, there’s now a pair of my sneakers in the tree at Neels Gap. It’s the slightly too-small pair I bought in Jasper after leaving my hiking shoes home before my 2014 section hike. I found them under my desk when I cleaned out my office in December and brought them along. You can read about all that in previous posts. 
While hiking today, I got a few emails in response to yesterday’s post, which started me thinking about why I blog. 
Why do I blog? 
Mostly, I blog to record my journeys for myself, my family, and my friends. It also makes me happy to entertain some friends I haven’t met yet. Plus, I enjoy writing. I’ve always said that I think better with a pen in my hand. Writing helps me make sense of my world. Finally, I like making Mrs. The Incident laugh. Few things delight me more than having her chuckle over some story I’ve written. 
Because I’m mostly writing for myself, I want my blog to be real. I want to record my unsanitized thoughts in the moment and how I felt and reacted as the day’s events unfolded. I’ve read AT blogs where the author suddenly announced they were quitting the trail, but they’d never even hinted that things were anything but perfect. In those cases, I felt deceived or that I’d been cheated out of the real AT experience. 
As such, I will occasionally be wrong or make judgments about what I experience without all the pertinent facts. Other times, I may write something that bothers you or challenges the way you think about the world. That’s okay. Tomorrow’s, or next week’s blog may show a change of opinion, emotional growth, or a deeper truth I learned along the way. Or not. At this point, I have no idea where this journey will go.  

So, if I offend you, I’m sorry. Please feel free to comment (politely, please) and tell me where you think I went wrong. If you think I’m misinformed, either tell me or wait to see if I figure it out for myself. The best stories have some tension and character growth. We’ll see if this turns out to be one of those.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662076,"“The woods are lovely, dark, and deep … thick and lustrous”
My friend Jamie Compos sent me that paraphrase of Robert Frost’s poem yesterday morning. I’d just been thinking about how the woods feel in different seasons, but I’m not quite ready to write about it yet. 
Jamie must have “the gift.” Yesterday’s woods were light and airy, full of nature’s golden first green. This morning, they were dark and deep, and ever so lovely. 
I love walking in the woods. I love the fog. And I even like rain … in the same way I like salt. A little bit seasons the dish. Too much too often will kill you. Slowly. 
Fog forces you to look at what’s close around you. Partly, because you can’t see very far, but mostly because all the little things stand out. Today, in the fog, curled up flowers, the dull green mosses, the little springs and micro-waterfalls, the rows of shelf fungi on rotting logs, the shapes of trees, both living and dead, the furled up ferns, and misted spider webs caught my eye. 
The fogs also highlights the wood’s shadowy sounds. The bird calls, my footsteps, dripping springs, and the rain played a soft symphony for an audience of one. 
One rainy morning on England’s South West Coast Path, I met an old woman outside a foggy cemetery by an old stone church. She stopped to ask me how I liked the weather. Pleased that I said how much I enjoyed the rain, she said, “Well now, if you don’t love Cornwall in all it’s weathers, then you don’t love Cornwall, do you?”

I do love the AT in all it’s weathers. So far.

Today’s hike was a test of sorts: 14.3 miles, my longest so far. And in the rain. Well, in the drizzle with significance. The legs felt great and I had no Achilles pain. The toe was only bruised, not broken, and is healing. The doodles stayed with Kate so we wouldn’t have to deal with wet dogs in the van tonight. Tomorrow will be a bigger test. And then, perhaps, a zero day. 
Two nice moments on the trail today:

Trail magic at Unacoi Gap. Nice barbecue by Jean and Al from Noonan, GA. Great people, nice conversations, gave some wet hikers a ride into Hiawasee. While taking video of a micro-waterfall in the mist – very beautiful and secretive – my shot was interrupted by Boomhauer running full tilt down the trail in the rain waving both arms and smiling as he sped by. That’s the AT for you, beautiful and weird.

",Unacoi Gap,"Apr 14, Fri",14.30
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662151,"I learned something today.
Yesterday’s 14.3 miles was a new high for this hike. I finished yesterday like a champ, feeling strong and confident that I could make to Katahdin.
Today’s hike was only 2.4 miles longer, but I was dog-tired walking into Dick’s Creek Gap. Ironically, Roux was not. She still had energy enough for a game of chase with another doodle.
So here’s what I learned. It’s not just the distance. It’s distance & elevation together. And perhaps, it’s distance, elevation, and the cumulative effects of the previous days’ hikes. Today’s hike from Unacoi Gap to Dick’s Creek Gap had 4,908 feet of climbs (two of which were over 1,000 feet) and 5,063 feet of descent, in addition to the 16.7-mile length. Yesterday’s hike had only 3,000 feet of climbing spread over more than a dozen ascents, and no thousand-foot climbs.
By the way, my hiking buddy Brian developed a cool rating system for climbs that includes distance, elevation gain, and steepness. I’ll write more about that later when Brian joins me at Fontana to hike the Smokies.
Other than being long and tiring, today’s walk was a treat. I started before dawn, climbing out of the fog at Unacoi Gap and into blue sky views in both directions off the Blue Ridge. A group had set up breakfast trail magic at Tray Mountain, but they were just getting organized when I walked in before 8:00 am. I chatted briefly with a section hiker I’d seen previously, ate a banana, drank some Gatorade, and hiked on.
In the next gap, DrewB and crew were trying to restart last night’s rain-doused campfire, as well as disproving the adage that where there’s smoke, there’s fire. Bamhauser, who we’d taken into Hiawassee had returned to the trail, resupplying DrewB when he did, but had gotten ahead of him and was camped at the top of the second big climb. He was disappointed to hear that DrewB was making smoke and not miles.
A mile later I came across Fancy-Feast talking into his ipad – probably vlogging. He smiled and said he’d seen Roux the past two days and had admired how well-behaved she is on the trail. We leap-frogged after that for a few miles, chatting each time we passed. I got to hear part of his intriguing story (his trail name comes from a close encounter with a panther on the Florida Trail). Eventually he pulled away on a climb and disappeared when I stopped to take a picture of my first May Apple blossom.
I passed Las Dos Madres (my name for them – they introduced themselves on Day 2 as “we’re two moms”) at midday. They are sectioning from Springer to Winding Stair Gap over nine days and have some big days ahead to hit their goal. Just before I walked into Dick’s Creek Gap, a guy with two teenagers walking a doodle stopped me and said he’d seen my wife at Amicolola on Easter. He recognized Roux, not me. He was day hiking up to surprise his wife and her friend who were section hiking. Yup, he was el espouso de una madre. Small world.
In the gap before the last big climb of the day, I passed a hiker sitting on a fallen log by an empty campsite. I called out a “howdy” as I passed and asked how her day was going. She replied “Excellent! How are you today?” with such enthusiasm, I had to stop to answer and ask a follow-up question. I’m glad I did.
It turned out she was few days from finishing her thru hike. You might be wondering how someone could be finishing a SOBO (southbound thru hike) in April. I was. In fact, she was a flip-flopping SOBO. She’d started at Harpers Ferry last year, summited Katahdin in the fall, and then hiked south from Harpers Ferry, hoping to finish by Thanksgiving. But she got seriously ill and was unable to continue before winter.
She said she’d reach Springer Mountain this week, just before her 365-day window was up, and thus qualifying for a “real” thru hike. To which I replied: “Pshaw, it’s a real thru hike regardless.” Which got a big smile and led to an interesting discussion of “real” thru hikes, so-called purist thru hikers she’d encountered, and some people’s need to create rules about other people’s hikes.
Before any of my more excitable readers get all fired up about the official definition of “thru hike” or what constitutes “judging” someone else's hike, try to understand this moment. I was tired and facing yet another long climb. This hiker exuded so much excitement about her AT experience and how it had changed her. She’d faced adversity, adapted, and overcame it. An aura of self-confidence surrounded her. She radiated energy. Her joy of finishing was palpable.
I want all of that. I want to be 50 miles from Kathadin, full of excitement for the end and the thrill of what comes next. In the face of all that, quibbling over an arbitrary definition of a “real” thru hike seemed irrelevant.
As I turned to leave and start my climb with renewed energy, I asked her trail name.
“All Good,” she replied.
Perfect.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662164,"The AT gave me the day off. Hence, zero trail miles completed today, a.k.a., a “zero” day. The word can be a noun (I’m taking a zero today) or verb (I’m zeroing today). Or is that an adverb? Mrs. The Incident taught grammar, but she’s too sleepy this morning to answer definitively.
Sleeping in is definitely on the agenda, at least for half of the Incident family. I was up at 4:00, having crashed into oblivion by 8:00 pm last night. But zero miles doesn’t mean nothing to do. Lots of hiking chores, as well as some real-world obligations, pile up over the course of a week on the trail. 
Mostly though, I’ll be NOT hiking. My leg muscles aren’t sore after yesterday long day, but my Achilles could use some stretching and ice. My bruised toe got abused yesterday and wants a day off too. Update: my calves are little sore.

The forecast calls for rain and thunderstorms, so it’s a good one to stay indoors.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662233,"Today was a tough day.
But let’s start with yesterday, which wasn’t. By noon on our zero day yesterday, Mrs. Incident and I felt that we’d taken in all the wonders of Hiawassee, at least all those that can be done with two doodles tagging along. So, we packed up and headed out to Deep Gap to prepare for the next day’s hike. 
By her own admission, Mrs. The Incident is map challenged. Consequently, driving alone down miles of unpaved forest roads into the deep woods of southern Appalachia is not her forte. Frankly, the thought of her doing that gives us both anxiety. When such drives are required, we’ll make them together to assure ourselves the roads are drivable. Then, we’ll camp together if she feels she can handle the road back out alone, and I’ll hike back to civilization and our pickup point. 
In today’s case, I hiked southbound from Deep Gap back to Dick’s Creek Gap. The plan had everything to do with logistics. It was just a happy accident that hiking this 15.8-mile stretch southbound instead of northbound turned a net 2,000-foot climb (5,161 ft. total gain) into a net downhill trek. Going south still had 3,500 feet of climbing, so either direction was a workout. 
Deep Gap Road was in good condition despite the rain. We arrived at the AT trailhead around 1:30 pm and settled in for a quiet afternoon of napping, writing, and dodging the rain. When we pulled in, a young man, dressed in only a t-shirt and shorts (no backpack, no car) was sitting on the edge of a soggy fire ring. We waved and said hello, but he seemed to want to keep to himself.

About an hour later, I heard someone call out. The young man jumped up and had an animated conversation with a runner who’d just come up the trail...something about his GPS taking him to the wrong place. The runner was wearing the sort of gear ultra-marathoners use and had calves the size of my thighs. The runner drained the young man’s water bottle, shouted something about a med kit and what he needed for dinner, and then immediately headed out again. 
The young man looked a little bewildered, so I asked him if he needed anything, but he said he was fine and that he needed to bushwack back to where he’d left his car. Why he hadn’t driven it here and why he hiked here instead of driving remains a mystery. 
As he left, I asked him if the runner was trying to set an FKT (fastest known time). “Yeah, that’s Gerrit. He’s going for less than 40 days,” he said as he headed into the woods. That’s 40 days to walk/run the 2,198.4 miles from Springer to Kathadin. Zowie. 
We had just enough internet to figure out that we’d just seen Gerrit Van Ommering, who left yesterday from Springer Mountain. I’m kicking myself for not taking a picture. 
By mid-afternoon on his second day, Gerrit had covered 85 miles. He’ll need to average 55 miles per day to break the current record. By comparison, the next person that hiked into Deep Gap after Gerrit left Springer Mountain two weeks ago. You can track Gerrit’s progress on www.fastestknowntime.com. As I write this, he’s at Mile 134, approaching the NOC.

The rest of yesterday afternoon was uneventful. Fancy Feast and Las dos Madres (who’s trail names are actually Mountain Goat and Eventually, names that reflect their climbing styles) passed through and chatted for a while. One of Roux dog buddies also hiked in with its owners, but they just growled at each other. Everyone is grumpy after a hike if they haven’t eaten yet.

Today, I hiked out of Deep Gap before sunrise. We had no frost on the windshield, but it felt like we could have. Plus, the wind was howling, creating a wind-chill that must have been in the high 20’s. But the sun was coming up and the skies were clear. An excellent day for hiking. 
Roux & I had the trail to ourselves until about 9:30 am, though we passed a very crowded camp around the Muskrat Creek Shelter. After that, we saw only one or two hikers until we met Dr. Doolittle at the Georgia-North Carolina State line. 
That’s right. One state down, thirteen to go. Woot! Woot!

Actually, the state line was a little anticlimactic. I’ve hiked past there before. And technically, I hiked back into Georgia, not north into North Carolina. Plus, I guess I was a little wonked. That is, physically tired and low on blood sugar. Still, it’s an important milestone. I made it out of Georgia. Or, I would when Kate drove me back to Deep Gap, which is in North Carolina.

Just after the border, I started noticing poison ivy growing along both sides of the trail. I’d seen it few times in isolated places last week, and then a lot of it on the last climb down into Dick’s Creek Gap on Saturday. Today’s poison ivy crop took it up a level, leaving practically no place to sit down that wasn’t in a poison ivy patch. 
I’m very allergic to poison ivy. It’s one of the reasons I wear long pants, high socks, and long sleeve shirts when I hike. And one of the reasons I carry a plant ID app on my iPhone. 
I’m pretty confident that I can avoid contact with poison ivy by being vigilant. I am less confident that Roux or Gus can. So, I spent most of the next eight miles pulling Roux from one side of the trail to the other to avoid getting the poison ivy oils on her hair (Doodles have hair, not fur…look it up.). Roux on a leash meant using only one trekking pole, which in turn meant more tripping and almost falling…into the poison ivy. 
I arrived at Dick’s Creek Gap foot-tired, stressed, hangry, out of gas, and out of cell service. And Kate wasn’t there. Fortunately, a 2007 thru hiker was doing a little trail magic, and I got a hamburger, a hot dog, an ice-cold La Croix (my drink of choice), and few salty chips. He even cooked up a dog for Roux and gave me a little timely advice about handling the mental aspects of completing a thru hike. 
You’d think that be enough to bring me out of my funk. It wasn’t. I was stuck in mental quagmire trying to figure out how to keep the dogs out of poison ivy, whether I should send the dogs home, find a boarder, or just quit. That’s how I felt. An overreaction, I know, but there it is. 
Kate showed up, having had a stressful morning of her own, which included taking the wrong road out of Hiawassee and ending up at Unacoi Gap instead of Dick’s Creek Gap. She’s as allergic to poison ivy as I am and wasn’t thrilled to hear my news about Roux’s possible exposure. Our moods weren’t a good combination.

It took us 30 minutes to get out of the Dick’s Creek Gap parking area and another hour using the WiFi at Ingles in Hiawassee to figure out a plan. Thanks to some Dawn soap and latex gloves from Ingles and a few spent quarters at the HiaWASHee car wash, Roux has been sanitized. So have I, though I can tell you my heartrate jumps every time I get the slightest itch. 
The Doodles are not going home, and neither am I. I am, however, going to eat more and keep my blood sugar stable. We also now have a homemade poison ivy dog wash kit. Mental crisis #1 averted.

Stay tuned to see how this all works.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662311,"Today was as good as yesterday was bad. And by good, I mean fantastic.
I knocked out 20.8 miles and 4,500 feet of climbing from Rock Gap to Deep Gap. That included the tough, steep climb up Albert Mountain, as well as up and over Standing Indian Mountain, which tops out at 5,478 ft msl, the highest peak thus far on the AT. 
I felt strong throughout the hike. I could have done another 10 miles. 
What was different from yesterday? Mostly, the trail was better. Better maintained, more switchbacks, fewer steep, rocky sections, and fantastic viewpoints. Nearly everyone I met commented on it. 
Yesterday’s poison ivy forest was replaced by today’s stunning display of wildflowers lining the trail. Flowering bluets, red and white trillium, mountain violets, Canadian lousewort, and alpine cancer root, just to name a few.

I also ate more frequently and stayed hydrated. Looking back at yesterday’s crisis, it was probably 90% blood sugar management. After my second lunch at the trail magic, we stopped by McDonalds to use the free WiFi and I had a third one. An hour later, I felt great. And then I had supper.

And finally, Roux and Gus stayed with Mrs. The Incident. Twenty-one miles is a lot to ask from some dogs, though Roux has done it before. I just didn’t want to risk another poison ivy fiasco. This evening, I bumped into a couple of trail ambassadors back at Rock Gap, and they claimed that I won’t see much poison ivy between here and the NOC. We’re still considering dog management alternatives. 
What a difference a day makes.

I saw the family with three preschoolers at Dick’s Creek yesterday. They’re still on the trail and doing great. Kate has been seeing them regularly and chats them up. The kids like the dogs and always come over to say hi.

So, I stopped and took the rest of the day to hang out with Mrs. I and the doodles before moving on tomorrow.
A trio of thru-hikers - Survivor, Machina, and [forgot her name] - hitched a ride with us into Franklin, NC for quick resupply. Mrs. I headed over to the Scottish Tartans Museum, I guess because our daughter-in-law is of Scottish descent and because of “that Scottish play”(it’s bad luck to say or write the word “MacBeth.” Oops.
I checked in at Outdoor 76, Starbucks, Ingles, Lowes, the dog park, a laundromat, and old town Franklin. Chores are necessary parts of a thru hike, but hardly Blogger Hall of Fame stuff.
Instead, I’ll give you the story of last night’s drug bust.
Trail ""Magic"" - The Prequel
When we arrived at Rock Gap at the end of Day 9, we saw a Honda SUV with blacked out windows covered with all sorts of trail stickers parked on the other side of the lot. Two hiker-types were sitting behind it with a little bit of not-very-inviting food laid out on the wooden guardrail. I thought it was their dinner and jokingly asked if they were offering trail magic or they were hiking.
“I’m sitting” the one replied, “not hiking.” “You dumbass” was implied by tone and look. Ok, I deserved that one, by walking up and joking with someone I didn’t know. “Sorry,” I said, “I really just wanted to know if you mind if I park near you for the night, because this is the flattest spot and because we have dogs.”
I got the okay to park and we chatted briefly, enough to find out that one of them was actually offering trail magic, he had thru-hiked two years ago, and that he had his own dog he described as unfriendly. So I said we’d take the other side of the lot and keep our dogs out of sight and on their leashes. He started in on a trail story, but was having trouble remembering the details. He paused, shrugged, nodded toward his hand, and ended the story. That’s when I noticed he and his buddy were killing the last bit of a blunt he had in his hand.
That’s not my scene, so I excused myself after a few minutes. Other than his first comment, he seemed nice enough. Later, I saw him walk up toward the nearby shelter and return with a small crowd, but they were quiet, so I didn’t give it a second thought.
Trail Magic - Part Deux
The guy, let’s call him “Sunspot” (not his real trail name), was still there when we got back from Deep Gap the next night after my 20-miler. This time, he had two or three people hanging out behind his SUV. The parking lot was nearly full, so we took a spot on the other end and started doing our chores.
Mrs. I mentioned she’d met the woman who owned the SUV that morning and had chatted briefly about our vans and vanlife. Mrs. I started saying that something didn’t feel right about them, and that we might consider camping somewhere else. I responded that lots of different kinds of people hike the AT, basically dismissing her intuition in favor of my own.
Johnny Law
Just then, three County Sheriff’s cruisers pulled up, blocking off the entire parking area, preventing anyone from leaving. A half-dozen officers spread out and converged on the trail magic. Two started asking Sunspot questions, and the rest stood back a safe distance watching the interview and the rest of us in the parking lot.
Sunspot did not react kindly to be questioned, and even more so to being told where to stand and what not to do with his hands. Somehow, his objections did not convince the officers to back off. Nor did his yelling that they were violating his rights and that someone should film this. After some struggling and more yelling from all parties, Sunspot ended up in cuffs, and a young woman who whipped out her cell phone to film the action had her phone confiscated.
Suddenly changed from future viral YouTuber to potential inhabitant of the Macon County lockup, the young lady started protesting that she didn’t know anyone here, she’d just walked up, and that she’d delete her video if they returned her phone. To no avail. She was directed to sit on the guardrail with the other trail magic participants. Everyone else had decided, after a few initial protests, that their best option was to sit down, shut up, and wait it out.
An hour or two later, and a thorough search of Sunspot’s SUV, Sunspot and his significant other were placed in the business end of a squad car and driven off. Apparently, the SUV had quite a stash of magic. An hour after that, a tow truck showed up to impound the van.
The Aftermath
The other trail magic participants were released. A few were still there this morning grousing about what happened.
The young woman eventually got her phone back, but for some strange reason she also ended up with Sunspot’s dog. Mrs. I crossed paths with her later while walking our doodles and learned that she was in fact traveling with Sunspot and his partner, knew them well, and was in the process of figuring out how to bail him out. She said that the dog was named “Gypsy” because Sunspot was part Romany. Hmm, I thought that word was offensive to the Romany.
The parking lot and hiker crowd seemed split between “got what they deserved – thank you for your service, officer” and “they weren’t hurting anyone – all cops are fascists.” You have to admit to a certain irony in that half the spectators were sitting there putting away beer after beer, while Sunspot was getting busted for selling other intoxicants. But that’s our legal system – the worst one in the entire world, except for all the others.
The AT trail ambassadors stuck in the parking lot with us told us that drug dealers follow the hiker bubble. It’s just part of the AT thru hiker culture. There are even names for it: Haze blazin’, green blazing, or just blazing. HYOH - hike your own hike.
One of the cops told us they’d received a tip-off, or they’d never have bothered coming out to such a remote location. For the record, it wasn’t me. I’m too clueless to have figured out what was going on.
So, You See, Johnny
Are there any lessons in this little tale? Sure, how about:
This isn’t the big city. Don’t mess with the rural police. Repeat after me: “Yes, officer. Thank you, officer.”When it comes to drugs in the rural south, be the buyer, not the seller. Or stick to beer. Preferably domestic.You should trust your gut about safety. Except for me. I should trust my wife’s gut.If I hike longer days, I won’t have time to tell rambling stories. But it’s not a guarantee.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662423,"We slept in Franklin last night. Mrs. The Incident was still out cold at wheels up, so I kissed her cheek and said, “Time to go, beautiful.” She made a sleepy sound and mumbled “Have a nice day. Be safe.” When I laughed, she woke up enough to realize she had to drive me up the mountain to the trail.
The woods were magical today. The steep-sloped open glades, carpeted with last season’s browned leaves, and lit by dusty shafts of sunlight shining down through nearly bare branches, took me back 50 years. I spent my childhood hiking alone through the same scenes, going everywhere and nowhere in particular. Back then, the top of every wooded slope promised never-seen-before views. Every seep, spring, and stream was a path to adventure. A well-traveled trail to follow was the only difference in today’s walk. What a treat to visit that time again.

Winding Stair Gap to Burningtown Gap is 14.6 miles, with two 1,500-foot climbs. At this point in my trek, that distance feels about right. I’m tired at the end of the day, but not exhausted, and not sore the next morning. Perfect.

I think I’ve figured out my pacing. On the long climbs, I’m following the advice of a guide we met on Mt. Ranier some years ago who said to pick a climbing pace you could maintain all day if you had to. So that's what I do on the climbs. On rolling terrain and on smooth descents, I pick up the pace to grind out the miles.

But I also stop more. I stop to chat with other hikers, mostly. But I also pause to identify and photograph flowers, to let Roux drink from springs, and to take in the scenery. I think doing the 20.8-mile day to Deep Gap on Day 10 gave me confidence that I could log big miles eventually. In the meantime, I don’t need to rush.

Today’s highpoint, literally, was the stone tower on Wayah Bald (5,337 ft - a bald is a unique type of treeless peak found in North Carolina). I walked in Wayah Bald parking area at lunchtime, hungry and hoping for trail magic, but settled for catching up with Survivor, Machina, and Wheels, the hikers we drove into Franklin yesterday. They loved the van and asked a hundred questions about it and how I convinced Mrs. I to buy it. Actually, she convinced me. 
Also, Survivor has made it his mission to weedle the “Incident” story out of me. He got nowhere at lunch time. Later, when I got to Burningtown Gap, Survivor was there, trying to convince Mrs. I that I’d given her permission to tell him the story. Mrs. I wasn’t having it, but that didn’t stop him from making all sorts of guesses. I finally got him to stop by promising him I’d give him a hint if I saw him tomorrow. 
I did not promise it would be a useful hint though. Always check the fine print, Survivor. But then, he’s got another 2,074.4 miles to work it out. I wish him luck.

Back at Wayah Bald, I had just left when I got a text from Mrs. I saying she was at the Wayah Tower turnoff. Did I want to meet for lunch? Of course! So, Roux and I turned around, climbed back up to the bald, and waited while she drove up the steep gravel road.

As I waited by the parking area, some locals showed up and started talking about the big drug bust at Rock Gap. Their main source was a young lady one of them met at the Franklin library who was using “that Facebook thing.” Eventually, they said hi to me, and I mentioned that I'd been at Rock Gap for the action. We traded a few facts. Mine, from what I saw. Theirs, third hand from that Facebook thing, but definitely more interesting than mine. 
One of them, who was riding on a motorized wheelchair scooter, claimed to have left Rock Gap just before the bust. That might sound a little far-fetched, but in fact, one of the spectators mentioned that a guy on a scooter had tried to drive it up the trail earlier that afternoon. Scooter guy didn’t share what he was doing at Rock Gap in his scooter or how he knew Sunspot. Several of the hikers at Wayah Tower had also heard about the bust. News travels fast in the woods.

At Burningtown Gap, we put out our camp chairs and chatted with a few of the hikers who came through. Mousefeathers, who graduated high school early to hike the trail, stopped in, accepted an orange, and told us how he got his name. On his first night on the trail, a mouse ate his puffy and the whole shelter got a dusting from the debris. A few minutes after Mousefeathers left, Huckleberry, a Black Lab/Great Pyrenees mix we’ve seen for the past week, galloped in to play with the doodles. Double H (Huckleberry’s Human) followed soon after, with Shooter and Ninja. Fancy Feast hiked through in the late afternoon after a zero in Franklin.

Quite a few of them are on the same pace as me to enter the Smokies on Monday morning. I’m looking forward to travelling with familiar faces.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662465,"NOC, NOC.
Every hiker I talked to yesterday and today was heading to the NOC. They all had the same plan - eat, shower, and eat more.
For most AT thru-hikers, the NOC, or Nantahala Outdoor Center, is an iconic, thru-hiker-friendly milestone. For me, it’s more than that. Twenty years ago, I rediscovered the AT while staying at the NOC for a week of whitewater canoeing. I would not be thru hiking if NOC didn’t exist.
The NOC sits along the Nantahala River, which cuts deeply through the Appalachian Mountains. So deep, in fact, that the Cherokee called it the ""land of the noon day sun"" (Nantahala). For river runners, that means shade and cool waters. For AT thru hikers, that means massive climbs in and out of the NOC.
This morning, I descended 3,500 feet over six miles from Tellico Bald to the NOC. Tomorrow morning, I’ll climb 4,000 feet out of the Nantahala Valley and over 5,052-foot Cheoah Bald. I’ll more than earn the cheeseburger, fries, ice cream, and everything I stole from Mrs. I’s plate at lunch.
Everyone at lunch ate big. Bamhauser topped off his burger and fries with a large pizza. I saw him later heading for a grocery store to get more.
Survivor picked up the check for all of us (Machina, Wheels, The Walrus, Bamhauser, Mrs. I, and me) before we had a chance to object. It almost made me feel bad for short-changing him on today’s clue to my trail name origin. Almost. But I promised him a new one tomorrow. A real one. But probably so obscure it won’t help, though he claims he already figured it out.
Survivor said he bumped into Shooter and Double H during this morning's hike. Shooter told him we'd told him The Incident story, but had sworn him to secrecy. I'll have to watch out for Shooter. He doesn't seem the type to mess with someone like that. Survivor was crushed until he figured out he was being had.
I not only hiked into the NOC this morning, I also hiked into full-blown spring. Up high, most of the trees were still bare and few flowers graced the trail, so I focused on the sounds of the woods as I walked alone with Gus. I heard unseen songbirds, knocking woodpeckers, and an owl, as well as a rhythmic air-whomping sound I guessed was either turkeys or grouse awkwardly trying to fly. Every so often, I’d hear human voice in the distance. Minutes later I’d pass a hiker or camper.
Mostly, the woods were quiet. Until on the steep climb up to the Tellico Bald tower, a huge tree fell over just 40 feet below me. Gus jumped a foot in the air and started barking, because in dog world, barking fixes everything. Mrs. I asked me later if it made a sound, implying I guess, that I was the “nobody” there to hear a tree fall in the woods.
At Tellico Gap, I saw my first Azalea blooms. By the time I dropped into with 500 feet of the NOC, the forest understory was fully leafed out with lush, deep green vegetation, foreshadowing the jungle world coming soon to the trail.
I saw my first Dwarf-Crested Iris, Tulip Trees, and Heartleaf Foamflowers. There were more new species, but Mrs. I texted that she’d just ordered me a cheeseburger, so I was in no mood to stop and smell the flowers.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662547,"Sometimes, I think the AT has a mean streak. It might even be out to get me.
It throws up roots to catch my feet and break my toes. It hides the white blazes or distracts me, so I miss turns and have to backtrack. It drops trees that block my path. It wets the rocks in the steepest places, just when I need sure footing. It puts pointless climbs in long descents, and climbs for thousands of feet only to skip the summit view. Don’t even get me started about what it does with poison ivy. 
This morning, I realized that the AT doesn’t have a black heart. It isn’t a bully trying to crush my spirit. The AT is that awkward kid on the playground who trips you and laughs. It just wants my attention. It wants to play, and those are the only games it knows. Now, when the AT pulls one it’s pranks, I try to laugh and think “That was a good one. You got me. We’re friends, right?”

One of the AT’s favorite games is “hide the summit.” I’ve watched dozens of YouTubers narrating their climbs in northern Georgia. They’ll point at a peak and say, “I think that’s Blood Mountain in the distance.” Nope, not even close. The trail will take a sharp turn and entirely bypass the peak they photographed. I play that same game almost every day.

The AT desperately wanted to play the summit game with me on today’s 4,000-foot climb from the NOC to Cheoah Bald. It gave me false summits, views of peaks that were probably, could be, should be Cheoah, but I knew they were too close and not high enough. It hid the summit in clouds, rain, and fog. It put blue sky and shafts of light over nearby peaks as if heaven itself had revealed the summit location. It put some flat sections that could well have been the summit approach, but weren’t. It even sent a hiker down to tell me I was getting close. 
I was having none of it. I just plodded along for three and a half hours, ignoring its tricks, and knowing I’d get there soon enough. 
And I did, eventually. I started the climb in a light drizzle over the NOC parking lot, the last remnant of the previous night’s hard rain. When that ran out, I walked under dripping trees and ominous gray skies and around long puddles. By mid-morning, the clouds started to break up, alternatingly lighting and shading the green slopes of the Nantahala Valley below. 
But up above, Cheoah Bald’s head and shoulders were socked in with low clouds. I chased the lifting fog up the mountain. Just before I walked into the clouds, at the top of “The Jump Up,” one of the steeper sections of the climb, I stepped out of the wet trees into bright sunshine and an amazing view of the upper Nantahala. 
Just as suddenly, I was engulfed in thick fog, which hung with me for the last three miles up the mountain. I’d left Spring at the lower elevations, so the mists surrounded the bare trees like ghostly vapors in spooky cemetery. By the time I’d hiked to the Bald, my clothes were soaked with sweat and wet fog. 
But my new friend must have seen me shivering and alone, because just as I crested the Bald, the sun broke through the clouds, giving both warmth and an epic view, as well as pair of German hikers, Junco and Spills (?) for company.

The trail was back to its normal tricksy self for the hike back down to Stecoah Gap. It pounded my knees and Achilles, put mud and water in all the steepest spots, and threw in another 900 feet of climbing along the 2,600-foot descent. 
But no more than normal. And Mrs. I was there at the end, handing out Tootsie Pops to hikers and making them laugh. Another epic day on the AT, my new playground buddy.

A few random thoughts to wrap up: 
-We walked up to Nantahala Falls last evening to watch kayakers. Pretty river, lovely sound.
-NOC let us boondock for free. We just needed a free parking pass. Classy.
-Altra is sending me a free pair of Olympus V’s. Met a guy at lunch yesterday who was having the same delaminating sole problem, and he tipped me off to their warrantee web portal.
-Dude. If I’m 4,000 feet above you and 6.5 miles away, and I can still hear your motorcycle rev up, it’s too freakin’ loud. -Simp Gap? Who was that named after?
-I caught up to Psy-Ops taking a break around 1:30. We chatted briefly and then he took off RUNNING, hoping to make Fontana Dam by sunset (~19 miles). As if his normal pace isn’t already supersonic. I won’t see him again. -I think I’m hiking into the next hiker bubble. I’m seeing lots of new faces and few of the old ones.
-Survivor didn’t catch me today. No trail name hints today.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662621,"I won’t reach “The Roller Coaster” for another 500 miles, but today’s hike was more roller-coaster-ish than the official one.
I hopped on the ride at Stecoah Gap, a little later than usual at 8:30 am, in bright sunshine and a crisp 42F. Just like your favorite old wooden roller coaster, I started out with a slow, steep 950-foot climb, my joints creaking and clacking as I pulled to the highpoint of the hike. 
From there, it was all downhill to Fontana Dam, with just enough bumps, twists, and turns to make it interesting, and some great views of this big amusement park we’ve been visiting. The ride even had that second climb that slowed me down, almost to the point of stopping, before sending me down the last long 2,300-foot descent to the end.

Those old roller coasters are always too small for my long legs and I climb off the ride with aching knees. Today was no exception. After the long descents into the NOC, down from Cheoah Bald, and today’s 4,962 feet of total descent, the tendons above my left knee were screaming. 
Vitamin I (Ibruprofen/Advil), stretching, and dip in the Fontana Village hottub helped some, but it took a few hours of rest before I could walk without a limp. Fortunately, the next few days are almost all climbing, as we enter the Smokies and climb to the highest point along the entire AT at Clingman’s Dome.

I bumped into Mousefeaters at Yellow Creek Gap. He was just heading out as I walked in, so I skipped my planned break and hiked with him up the second big climb of the day (1,200 ft over 3 miles). I hadn’t hiked that long with another person so far, and the miles flew by. But given my knee pain, I probably should have taken the break and rested.

I met and walked with Shamrock for about 15 minutes earlier in the day. He’s my age and is also supported by his wife. She camps in their van, but they only meet up every three to five days. Shamrock said he knew of three other couples were doing the supported hike thing this year. I’d only heard of one – Heading Home and Home Sweet Home – but I’ve not met them yet. Nice to know I’m not alone.

I saw Happy Feet, Mudbug, Squeaks, and Psy-Ops at the Fontana Marina. Psy-Ops was getting off the shuttle and heading out, after arriving last night at 8:00 pm on his one-day 29.6-mile hike from the NOC. The other three were getting on, heading up to Fontana Village. Survivor and crew still haven’t caught up, though they had planned to hike the Smokies on the same pace as me.  

Speaking of Fontana Village, I’m not a fan, though the setting is gorgeous. The cabins are pricey, but there’s no WiFi (there is cable TV though) or cell coverage. Our cabin had holes in the walls, a missing shower door, huge bubbles in the linoleum, lots of other oddities, and seemed to be landscaped with poison ivy. If any of the other housing options allowed dogs (the campground was fully booked), we would have tried those. 
But the Village at least offered a known meeting place for my friend Brian, who caught a shuttle from the Knoxville airport and arrived at dinner time. Brian is my long-time hiking buddy from Phoenix who hiked with me from Springer to Winding Stair Gap in 2014. He flew in to hike the Smokies with me starting tomorrow morning, possibly giving him the record for the most consecutive zero days. 
I’m not sure what kind of internet access I’ll have in the Smokies, though we plan to resupply in Gatlinburg, so it may be a few days before I post again.

",Fontana Dam,"Apr 23, Sun",15.70
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662733,"Brian and I said goodbye to Mrs. The Incident around 9:00 am. Brian needed a few resupply items (coffee) and Mrs. I needed gas, so we had to wait until The Pit Stop gas station opened at 8:00 am. They both got a cuppa, but no backpacking coffee. So, we made a detour to the Fontana Marina, but got skunked again. He'll have to make do with tea, which is a more civilized drink. Mrs. I is heading west to be grandma while I'm in the Smokies. The doods are boarding at Nooga Sitters, which is run by my cousin Paul's daughters.
As soon as Mrs. I pulled away, I remembered that I should have printed my Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) hiking permit at the Marina. Oops. The chance of me hiking 1.5 miles back to print a piece of paper was less than zero, so when I got to the permit box, I just wrote the permit number, date, and my (real) name on a piece of paper and stuffed in the box. Or tried to. The box was so stuffed, I could barely fit a business card sized slip of paper in. Apparently, the park rangers and ATC ridge runners are a bit less vigilant about permits than the Amicolola orientation and ATC website imply.
The hike into the Smokies starts with a 2,000-foot climb over three miles. But the grade is relatively smooth, so we were at the Shuckstack Fire Tower in no time. After looking at the very tall, rickety stairs of the abandoned tower, Brian elected to inspect a nearby abandoned cabin, while I risked the stairs and got the payoff of the best view yet on the AT.
The knee/quad tendon problem that started on the descent into Fontana yesterday was fine on the climb up from the dam, but got steadily worse on each descent as we sawtoothed up the ridgeline. By lunch time, every step down came with a sharp pain like a dull electric shock and a punch in the thigh. Those huge descents into the NOC, off of Cheoah Bald, and into Fontana had taken their toll.
The refrain ""No rain, no pain, no Maine"" was echoing through my head, but the verses of that song were variants of: ""This is it. Knee pain doesn't get better with more walking. Your hike is over."" I envisioned a helicopter rescue (not my first), emergency surgery at a small town hospital (also not a first), and hobbling around all summer in rehab (that too), but I soldiered on trying all sorts of pacing, foot placements, and hiking pole support alternatives to alleviate the pain. I even tried walking backwards to fool the knee into thinking I was ascending. Nothing worked.
During a late lunch stop, Stoked and Tumbles, a pair of self-supported hikers staying in a van like ours, stopped to chat. I mentioned my knee problem and they suggested TY tape. Stoked even dug through his pack to try to find some. Somehow that triggered my brain into action, and I tried some stretches I'd learned when during PT for my Achilles. And some Vitamin I. And then some serious prayer.
Almost immediately after we continued the descent after lunch, I had no pain. Miraculous, you might say, particularly in light of yesterday's and today's meditation. Or maybe it was the stretching, which I continued to do at every break. Or the Advil. But I know what I know.
I felt so good, Brian convinced me to hike past Mollie's Ridge Shelter at mile 11.4 and do the extra 3.1 miles to Russell Field Shelter. As Machina and Survivor said when they zoomed past us after lunch, every mile in today's sunshine is a mile we don't have to walk in the rain later this week.
That's right, I've had the pain, the rain is coming, and so is Maine, I hope. The Wednesday to Saturday forecast is all the talk along the trail. What day, how much, how intense, where to stop? But who really knows? The forecast changes each time we get cell coverage. We'll get 100 percent of the weather we get.
Machina also called out as he passed, ""It's nice to see you in a 'real' backpack for a change!"" Nice for him, maybe. I miss flying up and down hills with my slackpack, but I enjoyed having someone to walk with all day. Poor Brian. Apparently, I had a lot of words stored up. Was he tired from climbing when he dropped back, or tired from listening?
A small crowd had gathered at Russell Field Shelter by the time we hobbled in, but only two hikers had set up in the shelter itself. Everyone else had set up their tents around the shelter. One older gentleman was actively trying to convince everyone else to tent, I think so he could snore with impunity. We didn't take much convincing. He can have the snoring, farting, rustling, mice, and norovirus, and I'll choose my tent every time. Unless the weather is horrible, which could happen later this week.
We set up by ourselves on the hill above the shelter, surrounded by fields of White Nemophila, a flowering ground cover. The GSMNP and ATC ""require"" that everyone stay in the shelters. Except that permitted section hikers can kick out thru hikers regardless of what time of night they arrive. And except that hikers concerned about COVID can elect to tent. Apparently, most of us were petrified of COVID and retreated to our tents by 7:30 pm.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662739,"Last night was c-c-cold. Brian's thermometer said low 30's. My toes and my battery cell agreed, as both had a rough night. I finally stuffed my puffy down in the bottom of my sleeping bag, put on my extra shirt, and mummied-up my head inside the hood. After that, and a second trip to the bushes, I slept much better.
It was my first night sleeping on the ground for this trek, but hardly my first night camping. I spent a month in a tent in February-March this year in Grand Canyon. I spend about two months every year tent-camping for work. The first night is always the roughest for sleep. Subsequent nights get easier, either because I'm more tired or because I get used to the discomfort.
The cold kept everyone else near the shelter in their tents until about 7:00 am. By that time, I'd already retrieved our food bags from the bear cables and was sipping my Chai tea. But a few groups had left by the time we were both packed up and ready to go at 8:00. Everyone is planning to log as many miles as possible before the rain and time their resupply at Gatlinburg to miss as much of the storm as possible.
I met a few new characters at the shelter last night: Thomas, just Thomas, with no story attached. Squirrel! (said with emphasis), an older hiker who started his hike in Alabama on the Pinhoti Trail. Mousefeathers rolled in for a late dinner before pushing on for Clingman's Dome. Long-beard, who came over to say he'd just read my blog at Fontana. He wanted to know if I planned to reveal my trail name story. I told him maybe after I summit Kathadin, so he signed up as a reader. I better come up with a good story about that name, huh?
Plus the guy trying to convince everyone to sleep in their tents. I didn't catch his name, but he may be the most profane man I've ever met. And that's saying something. To paraphrase a famous Mark Twain quote, I think if you edited out his profanity, he'd be one of the quietest people I've ever met. Relax, that's just a joke. In fact, he's a very experienced hiker with some interesting stories and insights about the AT. I laughed when he said he hated the PCT because it was all *!#^^@ bare +%!!`* rock and exposed *$#%&!!!@ views. I think he likes tree-covered mountains.
Today's hike was a ridge walk climbing toward Clingman's Dome with great views in all directions through the trees. None of today's climbs were especially long, but they were steep, rocky, steppy, and very tough. Everyone was gassed by the end of the day. Brian was feeling the climbs, and dropped back to suffer alone. Or, he just wanted some peace and quiet. I still have some words stored up, and having someone to talk with sure helps the climbs go faster.
We passed Rocky Top at mid-day. I'm not sure what the fuss about that mini-peak is all about. We were underwhelmed. Thunderhead Mountain, only a 1/4 mile away, is higher, but has no views through the thick foliage. But I hummed the tune for the rest of the day regardless.
Despite having thoughts about getting to Double Spring Gap Shelter, we'd had enough by the time we reached Siler's Bald Shelter and called it a day. Once again, tenting was the abode of choice, leaving the shelter almost empty.Two final thoughts:

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662742,"Brian and I were up at 6:00 am and hiking by 6:30 am in a light rain and with wet tents in our packs. This morning, Cold Pop Tarts and Clif bars while we hiked took the place of hot oatmeal and tea in camp. We hoped to catch the 9:30 free shuttle at the Clingman's Dome parking lot. Everyone agrees that bigger rain is coming, making it a perfect day for a zero in Gatlinburg.
Only 4.5 miles separated us from Clingman's Dome, which is both the 200-mile point and the highest elevation point on the entire AT. We broke off at 4.4 miles, saving those milestones for what we hope will be better weather after our zero day. This morning, the Dome was totally socked in, with visibility of less than a few hundred feet.
The climb from Siler's Bald to Clingman's Dome started out pleasant enough, but the trail builders apparently wanted hikers to feel, not just know, they were reaching the AT's high point, so the last mile was a repeat of yesterday's rough climbs. We did catch a perfect Smoky Mountain sunrise during the climb - a layered orange horizon, with ominous blue-grey clouds above and retreating blue ridges below.
The highlight of the walk was the conifer forest on the Dome, the first of its kind so far. It had a very different feel than any of the other woods I've traversed along the AT so far. These are not the woods of Spring or Summer. These are the woods of winter and faerie tales, dark and foreboding. Unseen witches and ogres lurked behind distant trees, waiting to entice victims into their hidden lairs.
The grey skies and cold drizzle only perfected the image. Everything in these woods is being eaten by moss and ferns. It is a forest made for and by decay. Every branch dripped with moss. Every stump was blanketed with deep green fur. Beyond the thick branches, no horizon exists. Even if I could see through the dense boughs, the surrounding peaks and valleys would have been lost in drifting mists, leaving only ghosts of mountains and glimpses of what might have once been views.
How can anyone not love the woods?
The ride into Gatlinburg was not nearly so magical. The van was overstuffed with young, exuberant hikers. For me, it was like being stuck in the 20-something exhibit at the zoo. After the quiet of the conifer forest, my senses were overloaded with ""Dude, this,"" and ""Bro, that.""
Mousefeathers was the last to squeeze into the van. Last night, during his brief stopover at Siler's Bald Shelter, he was telling a story about ""some old guys he camped with...they were like, 62 or something...why are they even out here?"" Brian and I smiled at other, and I called out to Squirrel!, ""Hey, Squirrel!, is 62 old?"" He replied, ""I think I remember being 62, and it wasn't then."" It isn't for me on most days. But on some of this week's climbs, it just might be.Daily Stat's:

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662787,"News update: Maine isn’t going anywhere and neither are we. My legs needed a zero. The weather in the Smokies is cold, wet, and miserable. We were out of food. And Gatlinburg was calling. We answered. 
How to describe Gatlinburg? If you took almost everything I didn’t want to see or do in the Great Smoky Mountains and put it in one town, that would be Gatlinburg. Ripley’s Museum? Aquarium? Wax museums? Moonshine outlets? Fudge? Souvenirs? Bubba Gumps? Salt & Pepper Shaker Museum? Family friendly axe throwing? Dollywood? Yup. It’s all here and more. Lots more. 
But here’s the thing. Tons of people love all that stuff, and their interests are no less crazy than me hiking in the woods for six months. And Gatlinburg is built for them. Plus, axe throwing might be kinda fun.  And Mrs. I went Dollywood a few years back and said it was fascinating. 
The town also has a great outfitter (NOC), grocery stores, a laundromat, restaurants, and hiker-friendly motels. Which is how we spent our zero day…eating, chores, napping, and more eating. Burning 2,000-4,000 calories a day leaves a big deficit to catch up with in town. But we’re doing our best. 
But mostly, we got out the rain. Vanloads of wet, bedraggled thru-hikers have been arriving all day across the street from our motel. The hikers we’ve met all have stories of big rains and freezing temperatures. 
Tomorrow’s forecast looks a little better, but we expect to get wet some part of the next three days. Maybe we’ll be joining the old men in the shelters after all. 
Ok, time to get back to napping. After a bite to eat.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663128,"It's simple logic. Since Clingman's Dome (6,643 ft. msl) is the highest point on the entire Appalachian Trail, then it must all be downhill to Maine. I will test this hypothesis in the upcoming weeks and months.
We woke to a forecast of rain, but the sun was shining in Gatlinburg, with a gorgeous display of debris clouds sliding down the green mountain slopes under a deep blue sky. A local Baptist church offers a free shuttle up the mountain, leaving at 8:30, 11:00, and 1:30. Yesterday, we watched a bunch of hikers get turned away after arriving too late and finding the shuttle capacity already exceeded. I hoped to avoid the same fate.
Survivor, Wheels, and Machina were too late for yesterday's 1:30 shuttle, and looked simultaneously despondent and elated to not to be hiking out. Not only did they miss out on a late start and 18 hours of near-constant rain, they had to endure another night in a warm, dry bed in Gatlinburg. But on the positive side, Survivor had a extra day to chase down his namesake ""Survivor"" buff that went missing at the laundromat. Last I spoke with him, he had tracked down the attendant, gotten access to the security tapes, and had identified someone he was convinced was the culprit. Now he only had to find the anonymous person amongst all the locals and visitors in Gatlinburg and convince him/her to return the missing piece of cloth.
Quite a few hikers managed to find an excuse to stay an extra night in Gatlinburg, though everyone we spoke to denied enjoying themselves. Last night, we waved to a hiker we saw across the street and he called out ""Don't tell anyone I'm here again"" and pulled his hood over his head, as if anyone else cared. As I've always said, when life throws you lemons, go back to the brew pub for another huge hamburger.
Hoping to avoid Survivor's fate, I arrived at this morning's shuttle pickup at 7:15 am. At 7:45, eight of us stood in line. I texted Survivor that he better hurry, unless he needed another day for his buff investigation. At 8:15, the line exceeded the van's capacity. Just then, a big Texan with an even bigger white beard sauntered up and said he could take three or four of us right then. Survivor, Wheels, Machina, Brian, and I jumped at the chance, and squeezed into ""The General's"" Texas-sized pickup. The General, a 2018 AT thru hiker, had just arrived to help a friend David from his 2022 PCT attempt. David is the father of the family I'd met at the Springer Mountain parking lot. The family was still hiking and were due to arrive at Clingman's Dome in the next day or two. Amazing.
I've visited Clingman's Dome four times, including this week's visits. I never seen the sun from the peak, or the view, unless you count the inside of wet clouds as the view. Gatlinburg's blue skies had disappeared by the time we hit the trail in the fog and rain, though we still climbed the tower just to say we did it. From there, we retraced our steps back to the trail, walked a few hundred yards to the 200.0 mile mark, and started the 7.7-mile descent to Newfound Gap.
The Appalachian Canal: A Footbath For Those Who Seek Fellowship With The Wilderness. I should have brought a canoe. Most of the trail was either a flowing stream or ponded up behind the log steps. Note to the GSMNP: The mountain's misting system works well. The drainage system could use some work. All the water made the roots more slick, the mud muddier, the rocks more slippery, and the foliage drippier.  With everything wet, we walked straight through to lunch avoid having to sit on the wet ground in the rain. Brian and I were tired, soaked, and muddy when we got to the US441 crossing at lunch time. But at least we had trail magic to brighten our day.
Nope. Not today. Just a parking lot full of wet tourists gawking at the idiots who walked out of the woods with huge backpacks, sat down, and pulled out a sad, little lunch of tuna and cheese on a pita. A few came over, having just seen a sign about the AT, to ask if we were hiking to Maine. But then, having gotten a ""Yes"" out of us, they had no follow-up questions ready and stood there awkwardly staring. I tried to fill the gap, but what to say? ""Are you hiking? Have you been to Maine? Nice weather? Did you check out Ripley's in Gatlinburg?"". So I went with, ""Nice day for hike, huh?"" A conversation killer if ever there was one, but at least I got to finish my pita before it got soaked.
We still had three miles and a long climb out of Newfound Gap to get to our intended destination, Icewater Springs Shelter, so we shouldered our packs and headed out. Brian was feeling the climb, the rain, and the forecast. I felt all those things, but more than that, I felt like Sam in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" as he prepared to leave his part of the Shire for the first time. At Newfound Gap, I stood at the edge of all the AT miles I done before, and faced 1,990.7 miles of new trail. To heck with the forecast, all I felt was sunshine, rainbows, excitement and hope.
With the overnight rain forecast, we decided to stay in the shelter to avoid having to pack up a wet tent in the morning. Fortunately, we arrived #5 and 6, and claimed primo spots on the lower deck next to the wall. Within an hour all 12 shelter spots were taken, and at least twice that number showed up later and ended up pitching tents somewhere in the woods nearby. Each hiker who claimed a spot immediately hung up their wet gear and packs, creating a labyrinth of dripping obstacles between the people-shelf and outdoors. We all had to duck and weave around the wet gear whenever we left our bunks.
As per GSMNP rules, section hikers can always ask thru hikers to vacate their spots, so as each new hiker arrived, all of us shelterites sized them up as either thru hikers (poor saps) or section hikers (our ticket to a wet tent). Around 8:00 pm, an older couple walked in dripping wet and looking with intent at the lower deck. ""Are you sectioning?"" I asked. The older woman replied, ""Yes, can we squeeze in?"" When the hiker next to Brian gruffly answered ""We're full! There's no room,"" someone gently reminded him that meant one or more of us would have to leave. He then suggested the upper level had room. In fact, they had one more than us, and since he was one of the last to arrive, it looked he'd be heading to a tent.
Suddenly, he decided some space was available, but was still  pretty surly about it. The older couple apparently anticipated this response, and hauled out a bribe of what must have been 10 pounds of oranges, candy bars, honey buns, and something else that disappeared before I got there. Suddenly, we all felt better about section hikers.
The weather cleared briefly around dinnertime, treating us to a sensational Smoky Mountain sunset, which brought 20-plus 20-somethings out of the woods onto the grass in front of the shelter. Suddenly, I was at a frat party with loud, forced laughter, youthful exuberance, flirting, and, of course, weed. I always hated frat parties, or would have if I were the sort of person that got invited to one. Being 45 years too old for them doesn't make me hate them any less.
But being that old does make me deaf enough to block it all out and fall asleep as soon as the sun sets. But not deaf enough for all the other night noises. At one point, I counted five different snores, each with its own cadence, pitch, timing, and volume. And then every time anyone rolled over, their sleeping pad crinkled like they were sleeping on a bag of potato chips. Not to mention the coughs, farts, sighs, and zippers opening and shutting whenever someone went out to pee. But, at least we were dry.
We plan to spend three more nights in the Smokies, so perhaps we'll get used to shelter life. So far, I'm not a fan and am longing for a lonely, quiet night in the woods.

An Update
PS - Less than one hour from Clingman's Dome, I modified my downhill hypothesis. The 2,600-foot descent from Clingman's Dome to Newfound Gap, included 1,000 feet of climbing. I guess I'm living in a ""down is up"" world. For that matter, along the AT, up is also up. Who knew there'd be more mountains to climb between North Carolina and Maine?","Clingman's Dome
",Icewater Spring Shelter,"Apr 28, Fri",10.80
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663129,"At 6:00 am I gave up staring at the bottom of the top bunk of the shelter and climbed out to do the morning essentials. The Icewater Springs Shelter has no privy, but it does have a sign that directs campers to a ""toilet area."" The toilet area doesn't look and smell all that bad for having had several thousand visits per year, but those weren't white lilies popping out of the ground everywhere.  One more strike against shelter life.
When I came back, Brian had dressed and set up his stove on the cooking shelf at the front of the shelter. Some shelters have cooking shelves on the outside, probably to minimize noise levels for anyone trying to sleep, but not this one. We managed to pack and cook quietly to not disturbed anyone. That is, until I tried to jam my trowel into the ground by my pack but instead hit a loose piece of tin roofing material. I might have just as well hit a gong or played reveille. I caught a few nasty glares and deep sighs from the bunks, but by the time we left at 7:00 am, everyone but the section hikers had gotten up to watch a multicolored sunrise spectacular.
Brian started out calling himself Fry-Hiker when asked his trail name, but I could tell his heart wasn't in it. After watching Survivor's ordeal with his namesake buff, Brian decided to get a comfy buff for himself. He liked it so much, he decided to adopt it as his new trail name. The name fits. He looks good in it and he is pretty buff. For an old man.
The GSMNP regulation requiring shelter stays plays havoc with thru hike planning. While many thru hikers seem to plan their daily mileage by the distances to upcoming shelters, others (like me) plan to hike a certain number of miles or hours and camp wherever that puts them. But with only a dozen or so shelters spread unevenly across the Smoky's 73 miles, the daily miles are often too short or too long between shelters.
Today was a perfect example. We started out at the Icewater Spring Shelter at Mile 210.8. The next shelter, Peck's Corner, is only 7.4 miles north, too short a day for us.  Tri-Corner Knob Shelter, at 12.8 miles from Icewater Springs, seemed like a good target given the daily mileage we logged hiking between Fontana Dam and Clingman's Dome. But with our early start, the spectacular weather, and superior trail conditions we arrived Tri-Corner Knob at 12:30, just in time for lunch.
Our legs felt every inch of the morning's 12.8-mile walk, and as the first to arrive, we could have claimed any bunk spot we wanted. But neither of us felt like sitting around a shelter for eight hours waiting for sunset. Plus, if we could add a few more miles, we thought we might be able to outdistance some of the Icewater Springs party crowd. But the next shelter wasn't until Mile 231.1, which would make it a 20.3-mile day. With a full backpack and +4,400/-5,900 feet of ascent/descent, 20.3 miles seemed like too much.
An extra four or five miles and a stealth camp would have been optimal, but neither of us wanted to break the Park rules or risk a fine. In the end, I left it to Brian, er...Buff, and he decided on the hero miles. For him, the better weather, a nice cooked lunch and a coffee at Tri-Corner Knob, a 1:40-long lunch break, and positioning ourselves to hike out of the Smokies on Sunday instead of Monday tipped the scales.
So we did the 20 miler and were rewarded with spectacular views. In many places, the AT follows a knife-edged ridge with huge, steep drop-offs on both sides. The grades are relatively easy, with few of the rocks and steps that add to the difficulty of the trail south of Clingman's Dome.
In the morning, we walked above the clouds that filled the bounding valleys. I kept stopping to take pictures and narrate videos. As I was oohing and ahhing at one vista, Buff agreed that it was a great view, but he'd already seen it 10 times this morning. In fact, he said, all his pictures looked the same.
He's right, of course, but isn't that the AT? We see a lot of the same thing. Green trees and round mountains. If you don't love that view, it could be a tiresome walk. Fortunately, I love the woods and still find every view inspiring. A little less so when I'm tired.
By mid-afternoon I was that tired. I found myself staring at the trail, lost in thought and trying to block out my ear worms. I walked right past Bear Stare,* a hiker I've been leapfrogging for at least a week. When he passed me some time later during a break, I asked him where he came from, since it seemed like he appeared out of nowhere. He said he was sitting on the edge of the trail when I went by. He had even called out to me. I must have been in the get-'er-done zone.  *(Bear Stare got his name from a midnight stare down with a bear who was stealing food bags at Carter Gap.)
About five miles out from Cosby Knob, we passed Mantra, Proton, Over-the-Counter, and two others who had been at Icewater Springs and were also doing the 20-miler. As we passed, I joked that we'd be getting the last two shelter spots. Buff shot me a look to let me know I should have kept my mouth shut and not given them any motivation. Sure enough, with less than a mile to go, they all zoomed past, grinning as they went. But alas, as we came down the last hill, they all came walking back up the trail saying the shelter was already full and that they were heading for the tent spots above it.
Buff and I walked into the shelter to see for ourselves, thinking there might be room for two. Not only was there no room at the inn, we were (not) greeted with palpable hostility. This shelter's crew were loud, surly, and vulgar. Aside from my favorite Quentin Tarantino movies, that's not my vibe, so we just walked past and found an (almost) level spot for our tents, and set up in preparation for the rain that was quickly moving in.
We were both tired enough that we'd sleep through almost anything the shelter tribe could dish out. But if not for the GSMNP rules, we'd have found our own quiet spot in the woods and had a much better evening. Strike two for shelter life.
Today's 20-miler took us out of the mossy conifer forest and back into the spring deciduous woods. I'll miss that the look, feel, and peace of that forest. I wonder when and if I'll see it again on this hike. I'll also miss Buff when he leaves tomorrow. The miles pass so much faster with good conversation and company.Daily Stat’s:

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663130,"Rain drops started tapping on the tent fly just before 4:00 am. Around 4:15, I took advantage of a brief lull to add a few drops of my own to the landscape before climbing back in to my nice, warm, dry sleeping bag while I waited for the sunrise. The rain and I both drifted in and out until about 6:15. By then, it was both light enough to see and dry enough to pack up without getting totally soaked. I could hear Buff rustling in his tent a few feet away and knew he was itching to get moving too.
Buff's brother planned to pick him up at the Standing Bear Hostel on the other side of I-40, just 10.8 miles away. Buff had had enough of the Smoky's cold and rain, and was longing for Arizona's desert climate. Yestereday, his wife had texted that Phoenix hit 97F. Hmm, I'll take a little more cold, rain, and green mountains, please. We packed our wet tents quickly and headed out just after 8:00 am into a cold, foggy, drizzle.
Once again, the rain prevented us from taking breaks, although we did stop in at the Davenport Gap Shelter, the last one in the Smokies to be enclosed in chain link fencing. I'd thought the fencing was meant to keep the bears out, but a sign in the shelter said the fences were intended to keep the wild hogs at bay. Either way, I could imagine bears and hogs lined up outside the fence, pointing and staring at the humans, and wondering whether the inhabitants would get more active at feeding time.
From Davenport Gap Shelter, we only had a mile or so before we passed the permit box that marked the official end of the GSMNP. After that, we had a short walk through the dense jungle foliage of the Pigeon River Valley. Poison ivy dominated the trailside and had me scratching phantom itches until I climbed a thousand feet up the other side of the valley.
Much of the trail talk since entering the Smokies centered around whether to stop at the Standing Bear Hostel for the night, for a quick resupply, or avoid it altogether. Depending on who you listened to, Standing Bear is either the best, funkiest, most hip hostel on the trail, or the maw of Dante's inferno. It's advocates tend to identify as hiker trash, who relish being dirty in most senses of that word. It's detractors tend to be, well, people with sticks up their butt. You know, people like me.
I'd heard stories and read online comments about rampant drug use, all-night parties, hook up culture, unsanitary conditions, out-of-date resupply stock, crowds, Norovirus outbreaks, and a host of other rumors. And just as many negative comments about the people who made the first kind of comments.
So, of course, I needed to see for myself. And I needed a few resupply items before heading off to Hot Springs. Plus, Siri can find Standing Bear Hostel, making it a good place for Buff to meet his brother.
As we walked up the side road to the hostel, a police cruiser passed us and turned in to the parking lot. Uh oh, I thought, this is going to be a repeat of the Rock Gap drug bust. (Which, by the way, is still being talked about daily on the trail. Backpacker Magazine and several other outlets carried stories about it. And it turns out, almost everyone I've talked to was there just moments before the cops showed up. Huh.) But instead, the Deputy was there to help a elderly woman we'd met on the Pigeon River Bridge who had troubles possibly related to dementia. The hostel's owners had taken her in until an ambulance arrived as I was leaving.
And that's the best of Standing Bear. I think they honestly want to help people be comfortable, as well as to live their alternative lifestyle. They hand you a clipboard with a blank piece of paper and tell you to record whatever you buy, and then ask you to pay on the way out. In cash. You know, so they can report receipts accurately to the IRS.
If that's your vibe, you like to party, you miss the 60's, and you're not particularly fastidious, you'll probably get a kick out of the hostel. You might even get stuck there for an extended stay. A fair number of hikers we'd been keeping pace with disappeared after stopping there.
Also on the plus side, we met Survivor, Wheels, and Machina at the driveway as they packed up to leave. I'd thought they'd be days ahead of us, as they'd planned to be in Hot Springs today. But they'd been slowed down by the rain and had stopped for lunch and resupply. We seem to be fated to hike together.
I arrived with an open mind, as I'm naturally skeptical of online reviews (as you should be of this one). But it didn't take long to make up my mind. Standing Bear is not my vibe.
I found it to be chaotic, disorganized, dirty, loud, smelly, and crowded. The resupply food was meagre, old, and probably, in need of a visit by the County Health Inspector. The next day, when I pulled out the PayDay bar I bought, it was crispy (not gooey) and smelled of cigarettes. I ate it anyways. My hiker hunger has fully kicked in.
The construction looked like something I'd built as a 13-year old without my dad's help, or perhaps something my neighbor built while high. I'm not sure I'd want to stay there in a stiff wind, though the air quality might be better.
Enough said. Standing Bear is not for everyone, but it has its fans. I guess there's something for everyone along the trail.
Buff gave me his leftovers in lieu of a full resupply, enough to get me to Hot Springs. Then we said our goodbyes. I headed back to the trail, and he went back to Gatlinburg for the night, each of us happy with our choice. I started out with a 2,500-foot climb to Snowbird Peak, a lovely bald with near-360-degree views. Despite being pretty gassed already and having a full pack again, I somehow managed 2.5 mph up the hill. Maybe I'm finally getting my trail legs.
I intended to camp in a little clearing just beyond the peak, but ran into Survivor's crew near the summit, who convinced me to stay with them at Groundhog Creek Shelter four miles ahead. I finished with a 17.6-mile day and more than 5,000 feet of descent. But no knee problems.
On the hike down from Snowbird Peak, Survivor continued to pester me about telling him ""The Incident"" story. After they pulled ahead of me, I decided that, what the heck, I might as well tell him. Who am I to deny fate. But we got to the shelter, we went our separate ways for the evening, and the moment passed.
Alas, a missed opportunity for him.
I not only completed the Smokies today, I wrapped up the first of the nine FarOut trail maps, another milestone. Today also marks the beginning of my third week of hiking.
I also started backpacking alone again. This time, I felt different. Was it the milestones I'd passed? The freedom of walking alone? Being free of the GSMNP regulations? I can't say. But it does feel new, fresh, and full of possibilities.
It was also my last shelter stay. After what happened that night, I'm done with shelter life. But that's a story for another day.

",Groundhog Creek Shelter,"Apr 30, Sun",17.60
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663139,"Today may have been my best day of hiking on the AT.
I got out early. The weather was perfect - cold, breezy, and clear. I climbed like a champ. Nothing hurt (much). The views, flora, and trail were great. I logged 17.7 miles without really thinking about it. I found myself saying things like ""I've only got 10 more miles."" Ten miles. That was a full day of hiking just three weeks ago. Now it's part of an afternoon.
Sitting atop two different peaks, one in the early morning and the other in late afternoon, I sat calmly and let peace wash over me as I absorbed the majestic views. Gradually, I realized that I belong here. This is my place. I am a thru hiker.
Specifically, I am a thru hiker who will avoid shelters from now on.
I arrived at Groundhog Creek Shelter last night around 5:00 pm, a few minutes after Survivor's crew. The shelter was already full, of course, so I began scanning the area for possible tent sites. Wheels was setting up right behind the shelter, but pointed me at Machina, who was calling out that he had room for me near his tent. So I set up about 20 feet away, just on the other side of the remains of a stone fire ring and began making my dinner.
As I finished eating, more hikers came in, and several set up around and between us, not bothering to ask if we minded them being so close. We wouldn't have refused, but it would have been the polite thing to do. I might have warned them that I'm an early riser, since they didn't look like they were, as well as an occasional snorer. Eventually, they made eye contact and we exchanged a nod and a smile, but no names. I turned in early, read for a bit, and then fell asleep just as the sun set, a.k.a., ""hiker midnight.""
About 9:15, well past hiker midnight, I woke suddenly to the sound of loud laughter, footsteps around my tent, a crackling fire, the smell of smoke in my tent, and the flashing of headlamps. My new neighbors had decided to build a fire in the fire ring eight feet from my tent door and were all gathered for 20-something story time. I got to hear all sorts of stories and commentary, including one of them wondering whether her having two periods this month meant she was pregnant. Incredibly, she was serious. She seemed to find out that the opposite was true.
After a few minutes waiting for them to settle into a quiet campfire reverie, I gave a little cough-cough and turned on my headlamp to let them know they weren't alone. One of them said, ""Oh, somebody's slumbering. Sorry. I guess I'll go to bed too."" Hey, there's hope for the future after all.  But not much hope. The rest of them continued their scintillating dialogue until I finally unzipped my sleeping bag and tent, put on my shoes, and climbed out of my tent. I would have walked over to them, but they were so close to my tent, I only had to stand up.
One of them looked up and said, ""What?"", with a tone I remember well from my own adolescence. ""Sorry, but I'm trying to sleep and you're being kind of loud. Plus, the smoke from your fire and 'cigarettes' are wafting right into my tent."" One young lady replied, ""Well, it's a fire ring. It's not unreasonable to expect someone to make a fire in it after dark.""  Another said, ""I can't control where the smoke goes."" Valid points all around. So I tucked my tail between my legs, apologized, and slunk back to my tent.
No, not really.
""First of all, there's a fire ring right by the shelter. Why aren't you using that one? (We all know why. Those surly shelter rats would kill you.) Or the one over there where no one is camping? (Because, uh, well, we didn't want to.) Second, you can control the smoke...by not starting a smoky fire with wet wood right by someone else's tent."" A lot of other counterpoints came to mind, but by then the young woman replied, ""We will honor your request, but not because we have to. We have every right to make a fire whenever we want."" We will honor your request. Thank you, princess.
Her last point was debatable, but the first part got what I was after, so in the spirit of bipartisan compromise, I said thank you and headed off to empty the tank before taking another shot at sleep. When I returned, they were all still standing there, and the three rather large, angry looking, beardies were glowering at me. But at least they were quiet and weren't adding more pine needles and twigs to their mighty blaze, so I said, ""Thanks"" again, and zipped up my tent.The thought of three inebriated libertines with a bone to pick sitting outside my tent turned out to be less than conducive to sleep, especially as the fire continued to glow. Every time a headlamp flashed against the side of my tent, or I heard them murmur just out of earshot, I braced myself for another confrontation and murmured a quick prayer.
And then God intervened. Seemingly out of nowhere, a rain shower swept through, dousing their fire and sending them scrambling for their tents. Problem solved. I literally laughed out loud as I heard the coals hissing and the zippers zipping.On today's hike, I found myself pondering what I could have done differently. I guess I could have introduced myself to them when they first showed up and explained that I was hoping for a good night's sleep after a long day. Maybe they'd have felt differently about disturbing someone they knew. Or, I could have played the ""old man"" card, and tried to generate some sympathy for a gimpy white-haired geezer who needed his rest.
For sure, I'll never camp near another fire ring, even it looks abandoned. But realistically, there are so many fire rings out there, they are hard to avoid. I could have sat down around their fire and trotted out some of my boring river stories. I've been known to kill even the liveliest parties that way.
But the biggest lesson is that I'll avoid shelters in the future. Shelters are for the party crowd, the people who like to gather. I've met some really nice people at shelters, but I've had far more negative experiences than positive ones. I recognize that's primarily because of the kind of person I am. I like the woods. The quiet, dark woods. I'll take my chances with the bears and other critters out there in the dark. Someone else can deal with the critters who live in shelters.
I camped with the Survivor crew again, this time just the four of us at a stealth site. It was wonderfully quiet. I even pulled up ""The Incident"" story on my phone to share if they asked. But for whatever reason, despite nagging me about it all afternoon, Survivor didn't ask before they all turned in at 7:30 pm. Sometimes, you just have to ask for what you want.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663138,"I love the southern Appalachian woods on a late spring morning.
Walking this trail at sunrise bathes me in joy and peace. Perfect light filters through the trees, highlighting the subtle shades of green and brown, as well as the rainbow of vibrant reds, yellows, and blues in the flowers and sky.
The feel of damp mountain air on my face and in my ears energizes me. I'm chilled and nearly shivering, laughing with the incongruity of sweat dripping off my forehead as I plod up the first steep climb of the day. The morning air bites at my nose and fingers, but sooths my soul. The dampness softens the trail and quiets my plodding footsteps, but seems to amplify the calls of unseen birds. If I lived in the woods, I would be a birder. I'd need to know who was talking to me.
In the early mornings I walk alone, my face clearing cobwebs left floating across the trail by impressively ambitious spiders. I have the woods to myself, to see, to listen, and to think. Morning is for quiet contemplation. What does all this mean? How can I make sense of yesterday's events? It drives me to prayer.
The afternoons are for trail business. How far have I come? Where will I camp? When will I need to filter water? Am I making good time? Afternoons are also about social interactions. Who is that hiker? Who have I passed? Who passed me? Hikers seem more willing to stop, lean on their poles, and chat as the day progresses.
But afternoons are also for breaks. For stopping at the end of a long climb, sheltering from the persistent wind behind a tree or rock. For soaking my feet in a cold stream. For staring out at the trees or up at the clouds and thinking about nothing at all.
This morning, I hiked out of camp just as Survivor's crew were climbing out of their tents. Somehow, I managed to stay ahead of them for the rest of the morning. I didn't see a single soul on the trail until I walked into the Laughing Heart Hostel on the edge of Hot Springs. More than once, I was so lost in thought, I'd realize I hadn't looked for a white blaze for at least an hour. But each time, I found that my feet had followed the trail even when my eyes had not.
Hot Springs is my first real trail town. AT logos are cast into the concrete sidewalks right down the main drag. AT banners hang in the streets and in front of stores. I stepped off the trail onto pavement and saw two AT trail signs, white blazes, and Jennifer Pharr Davis' trailer. If it's not hiker friendly, you won't find it in Hot Springs. I've never been here before, but I recognized more faces as I walked around than I do in my own hometown. The AT runs through the heart of this little town.
Walking downtown, I passed by a restaurant patio and saw Fancy Feast having an early lunch. I thought he'd be in Damascus by now. I was stunned to learn that a family situation and some other factors were taking him off trail. At lunch, I saw at least 30 hikers either just arriving or just heading north, most of whom I'd met at least once.
I'll be taking a zero day tomorrow so Mrs. I can catch up after visiting our granddaughter in San Diego. She'll be returning with just one dog. Roux has decided to live with my cousin's daughter in Chattanooga for a while. They have four kids and another doodle who all love her. Gus will be returning with Mrs. I, glad to be king once again. But he'll stay with Mrs. I until we get past the worst of the poison ivy, if such a thing is possible.
Mrs. I is also bringing the van, which means I say goodbye to a heavy pack, wet tent, and Mountain House meals, and hello to a warm, dry bed, healthy food, and my best friend. Life is good.
Sadly, Survivor will leave the trail for a month for a family obligation, but plans to return to finish the section to Damascus this summer. Then, having done the rest of the trail up to New Hampshire before, he'll try to reconnect with Wheels and Machina in the Whites for the trek to Maine in the fall. Even sadder, he left without hearing ""the story."" Not for lack of trying. I hope to cross paths with Wheels and Machina again, but they are much faster than me.Daily Stat’s:

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663186,"If you’ve ever lost a lot a weight, you’ve no doubt had the sensation that climbing stairs just got a lot easier. I lost 30 pounds between yesterday and today. Thirty pounds of backpack.
That’s right, I’m a slacker again. A slack-packer. Mrs. The Incident returned yesterday, which means most of my gear now sits in the van while I walk. I practically flew up today’s climbs, averaging 3 mph this morning, and a little slower in the afternoon when I started taking more breaks. 
Speaking of Mrs. The Incident, she is now “North Star.” She is my compass and keeps me, our family, and many others pointed in the right direction. Plus, she’s navigationally-challenged, adding an ironic element to the name.
Because of the latter characteristic, we decided that it would be better to make the complicated drive out to Log Cabin Drive together. That way, North Star need only retrace her steps back to Hot Springs while I hiked south to town. 
I like hiking south because I get to see more people, some of whom I haven’t seen for a long time. They came at me in pulses, probably timed by which restaurant meal they left Hot Springs after.
Some looked miserable, plodding along with grim faces, leaning forward under the weight of a newly filled pack. I saw one young man leaning over, gasping for breath, shoulders on his trekking poles, staring at the ground. He had ear buds in, so he neither saw or heard me approach and stop three feet in front of him. I finally had to wave my hiking poles under his face to get his attention, after which we both exchanged apologies and went on. 
Others walk with energy and determination, greeting everyone they see. PhD and Brinn (a.k.a. Girly, though its not her trail name) fit that category. They like my dogs and the van, and always stop to chat, which makes me happy. 
They had tried to camp in the Rich Mountain lookout tower, but got overrun by mice as soon as the sun set. Then they climbed down to camp at ground level only to discover a mama bear and cub were hunting food bags. As they left, I asked him what his PhD was in and he replied, “I’m a Privy-Hunting-Dude.” LOL.
I also saw Wheels (now hiking solo and doing huge miles), Mantra and her crew, my anonymous neighbor from the awful Alpine Court motel in Hot Springs, Dr. Doolittle, and Skittish (now hiking with a five-man entourage). Then I passed Soco, whom I hadn’t seen since Georgia. He said his brother had gone home and that he’d been snowed on in the Smokies last week. I’m glad I missed out on that.

Today’s hike covered a cool section of trail. Log Cabin Drive is the home of the Southern Cookie Lady, who gives free cookies to thru-hikers. But we showed up before 8:00 and thought it best to let her sleep in. But I did give the heads up to all the hikers I saw going north.
I also got my first taste of a road walk, a ½ mile of gravel road near Mill Ridge. Just after the road section, the trail passed a lovely mill pond with benches to sit and contemplate. So I found a bench under a blooming Pacific Dogwood, stared at the water, and finished my daily meditation. As I left, I passed some day hikers at the other end of the pond. Day hikers are so clean, well dressed, and smell like soap. 
As I started the final, steep, two-mile, 1,000-foot descent into Hot Springs, I caught a scent familiar to all Arizonans: Heat. The air still had a chill, but the sun was bright enough by early afternoon to heat the rocks and bare dirt of the trail enough to create the hint of summer heat. I should soak up all the chill I can. Summer is coming.
Today’s flowers: Wild Geraniums, Trillium fields, Mountain Laurel, Bristly Locust, Brambles (who knew they had flowers?). Plus, Rattlesnake Weed, even though it doesn’t flower, it deserves a shout out.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663319,"I wake up early. Once I’m awake, I stay awake. This morning I woke up at 4:45 am. After I’d done my morning rituals, I had an hour without any internet to kill, so I started looking over today’s route on the FarOut app, a digital trail map.
I went looking for the 300-mile marker I expected to see today, and discovered a bad weather bypass at that point. Apparently, the AT needs a bypass route during high winds, lightning, and rain? That sounded exciting. And it was! An exposed ridge, climby and rocky in places, occasionally hard to follow and overgrown, but with outstanding views. 
I also saw that I’d start the day with a 2,500-ft climb. But midway up that climb, I realized I’m no longer playing the “how much is left game.” I just climb. 
I set a pace I can keep for the entire climb, which is a function of the steepness and length of the climb, the day’s total miles and total vertical, and whether it’s morning or late afternoon (energy level, temperature). And then I grind it out. No, I walk it out. It’s no longer that much of a grind.

I think I’ve progressed through the five stages of climbing. I’m past the denial, anger, bargaining, depression…(the map must be wrong, stupid AT trail planners, if I climb this the rest will be downhill, this trail sucks)… I might be approaching acceptance. I just walk up whatever’s in front of me. That’s not to say I don’t still love getting to the top or get exhausted, but I’m enjoying the journey up more.

During today’s big climb, I saw a Great Blue Heron (GBH). It looked like a skinny, 90%-leg, 20-something, but it acted like a GBH. On river trips, when you see a GBH ahead of you, it always does the same thing. Just when you pull up next to it, it takes flight and zooms down river. And when you catch up again, it does the same thing all over again. It can do this for miles before it figures out that it should just let you pass by. 
About a third of the way up the first big climb, my 20-something GBH pulled out of a shelter just ahead of me and zoomed up the trail out of sight. Two minutes later, I saw him standing by the side of the trail, chest heaving and hands on his knees. Then he saw me plodding along toward him and he took off again. 
We did this maybe four or five times, each interval a little shorter than the last. Finally, the GBH gave up, stood off to the side and gave me a grumpy “good morning” as I plodded passed. I never saw him again. 
As I neared the top of the climb, I saw a lookout tower next to some cell phone towers. The AT twisted and turned, trying to get me to play “the game,” but I knew where we were going. We were headed to the towers. Until we didn’t. 
What in the AT? We got to within 200 vertical feet of the tower and went right past it with no Blue Blaze trail to the top. After a 2,500-foot climb. The AT got me again. It’s a tricksy one, that AT.

Part of the big climb today was along an old wagon road. I love walking the old wagon roads, partly because I love to imagine their history. But mostly, I love that they have much better grades than the regular AT. Which tells me that the old wagon road builders loved their mules more than the ATC loves thru-hikers. 
Last climb of the day was up Big Butt. Not Big Butte. Big Butt. But it wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. I expected a bald, but it was pretty hairy. Coming down the backside, I realized I was wiped. I probably looked a little flushed. Ok, that’s the end of that. Sorry to dump all those puns on you.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663327,"Yesterday, while perusing the FarOut app during my last break of the day, I discovered that Wolf Laurel was a private gated community. I’d hoped to meet Northstar (Mrs. I) at the Bald Head Trailhead above Wolf Laurel. Nope. Not unless we bought a luxury vacation home in the next 16 hours. For the record, we did not buy a luxury home. This story does not end that way.
Discovering that fact late yesterday afternoon was a pain. But not as much as it would have been finding out this afternoon, and realizing I needed to hike another seven miles to the nearest road crossing. My choices were to either shorten today’s hike to 8.6 miles (to Sam’s Gap) or do 22 miles to Spivey Gap. 
I just wasn’t feeling the 22. My hips and feet hurt from yesterday’s mileage. Plus, I woke up grumpy. So, I took the shorter option, knowing that meant I’d probably fall behind most everyone I know. That didn't improve my mood.
On the positive side, a shorter day meant Gus could come along. He could harder contain himself when I called him out of the van, he was so happy. And he’s such a good trail dog. He sticks right behind me, stays right on the trail, doesn’t pester other hikers or chase chipmunks. 
His one vice is that he’s a fetch-aholic. At one point, I kicked a loose rock off the trail, rolling it down the steep side-slope. Gus was on it in a second, chasing the rock 90 yards down the slope, giving up only when he realized it was too big to carry. 
Gus may have been happy, but I was not. For me, today sucked. I woke up grumpy. I walked grumpy. And I grumped at every flower and view I saw. I crabbed about the trail, the (many, many) stairs, forgetting to camel up at the last water, and just about everything else that crossed my mind. And yes, I crabbed about the climbs that just yesterday I had achieved a perfect Zen state about. Fortunately, I saw no one else on the trail, so I didn’t kill anyone.

As a side note, I hate stairs, especially the logs-across-the-trail kind. Yeah, they protect the trail, prevent erosion, preserve stream quality, provide a more stable walking surface…blah, blah, blah. We hates them, we do. 
And just when I’d worked myself into a hateful lather about everything and nothing, I walked into Sam’s Gap where three, count ‘em, three separate groups had set up trail magic. It’s amazing what some free pancakes, eggs, soda, cookies, muffins, hot dogs, and chips can do for one’s mood. Especially, when there’s enough to share with your dog.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663377,"I saw a bear. So nothing else that happened today really matters.
But I’ll tell you about it anyways. 
The kegs were still flowing last night at the beer garden part of the tri-fold trail magic at Sam’s Gap when we returned from Asheville at 7:00 pm. About 15 of their clientele appeared to have settled in for the long haul, barely moving when the magicians packed up and left. 
Most of them set up their tents in the parking lot, spent the night, and were still there when the kegs were uncorked in the morning. I’m guessing they spent today there too, at least as long as the free beer lasted. I never saw any of them on the trail or at Spivey’s Gap. 
Today’s hike was a pretty straightforward long climb up Big Bald (5,504 ft msl, 2,600 ft climb) and then back down into Spivey Gap. I had my climbing Zen back again today, though Gus and I growled at a few of the stairs out of spite. 
Just before the summit, we found a cooler along the trail above the Wolf Laurel resort community. We took it as their apology for closing the access road I’d planned to use, and accepted a banana as penance. I offered Gus a corner of a ginger snap cookie, but he refused after giving it a slimy sniff. He did try to fetch it back though, after I tossed the gooey crumb into the brush.

Shortly after that, we passed a blue blaze sign for a “Nature Trail.” Really? Isn’t the whole AT a nature trail? I was curious, but not enough to walk an extra mile to see some “nature.”

The Bald offered great views of the huge luxury homes in the Wolf Laurel Resort, as well as of the surrounding valleys. The bald’s peak lay just below the low cloud ceiling, with wisps of damp mist and fog sweeping across the huge grassy knob. I thought I heard thunder once or twice, but no rain came.

From the peak, we had a mostly downhill walk to Spivey Gap. As we walked off the bald, the AT briefly and blissfully followed an old wagon road. A little less briefly than what I did, however. I suddenly realized I hadn’t seen a white blaze for a while, and had to choose between hiking back uphill to the AT or bushwacking along the contour line until I intercepted the AT again. 
After my bushwack path went through a quarter mile of brambles, Gus pushed past me looking disgusted with my woodcraft, and took over route finding until we got back on track. As a reward, I let him run free in the last of the bald’s grassy fields before we returned to the woods.  

As we descended, we encountered some slackpackers heading south. Bluebird saw us and happily called out, “I just saw my first bear!” and told me the story of how it saw them and crashed down the hill into the woods. Soco appeared a minute later, and retold his version. Their hostel was slacking them today and tomorrow into Erwin. More slackpack converts. 
Since my path switchbacked directly toward where their bear went, I kept my eyes open. Sure enough, I saw it or its twin a mile later. Bears are such beautiful beasts. This one had a light brown snout and a jet black coat. On all fours, it couldn’t have stood more than three feet high. Not full grown, but not a cub either. 
The bear didn’t see us at first, grazing on something behind some trees, but ran off as soon as it did. Gus couldn’t have cared less, or was too tired to care, and just followed me as I filmed as best I could. 
When we got to Spivey Gap, Northstar was talking to a couple of young women who had set up some trail magic. We were the only customers until a few hikers wandered in over the next hour. Then Miss Janet showed up and told us we were taking too much space in the parking area. Ironically, her car was taking up several spots and she was the only one to drive up in the two hours we were there. We guessed that the free beer magic back at Sam’s Gap had sucked in most of the potential traffic. 
The plant of the day was White Nemophila. The trail was lined with acres of it, spiced with trillium and dwarf larkspur. Sometimes, the White Nemophila was so dense it looked like it snowed. Incredible.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663471,"I might need to re-think our camping strategy. We got back to our parking spot just before dark, after a short foray into Erwin to find some internet as well as place for Northstar to recuperate for a few days. All the cars from the afternoon trail magic had left, leaving us plenty of space, even by Miss Janet’s standards. 
Even though the cars were gone, somebody had left one of those pop-up pavilions people use for tailgating. A guy with hiker clothes and a huge black beard sat under it with his gear spread out around him. He had a small backpacking tent set up too, with a large dog inside it that was desperately trying to escape and barking for all it was worth. That’s a little odd, right?

I walked over to ask if he minded if we camped at the other end of the parking area, and to get a feel for whether we wanted to be anywhere near him. He had a surprising amount of toothpaste dribbling down through his beard and wasn’t making much sense, but other than that, he seemed normal enough, at least by AT thru hiker standards. 
I found a level spot and pulled in. Northstar looked out her window and asked, “Is that poison ivy?” This is North Carolina and there’s a stream nearby. Yes, it’s always poison ivy. I repositioned the van so Gus’ leash would keep him out of the urishiol zone and we set up for the night. 
A surprising number of cars and trucks came and went between sunset and the last time I looked out at 12:30 am, but nobody came knocking and the van still had all its wheels in the morning. The all-night rain, rotating neighbors, poison ivy, and the tenting wild dog complicated my nighttime pee runs and REM sleep, but hey, at least it wasn’t a shelter. 
Oddly, the pavilion tent and toothpaste beard were gone by 6:00 am, but the pup’s tent was still there with no sign of the pup. Two new cars had arrived, but with no sign of any drivers. I need to find lonelier, less ivied camp spots. 
Even more strangely, Northstar slept soundly through all this and barely gave me a “murmph” when I hiked out just before dawn. 
Speaking of hiker beards, I’ve seen more huge white beards on hikers, shuttle drivers, and bystanders in the past four weeks than in my entire life. Long, bushy, dirty, and fugly. Is that an AT thing or an Appalachian thing? It’s like Santa gone feral. But I digress. 
Today’s hike was an easy, 11.3-mile saunter with three short, steady climbs and long, smooth downhills to the Nolichucky River at Erwin, Tennessee. The woods were dense and dripping, the trail soft from the rain, and the skies were overcast and threatening. That, and temperatures in the mid-50’s, made for excellent walking, though the flower count in the long green tunnel was substandard. But I did see some cool lichens and shelf fungi. 
I clocked in at just over four hours, with a walking speed over 3 mph, and about 2.5 mph with breaks and photo stops. Normally, my overall speed is between 2.0 and 2.5 mph. That got me thinking about mileage. 
Twenty-mile days are the holy grail of thru hiking. Thirty milers are the stuff of legend. Most of my trail friends have started hitting 20 miles regularly and have left me behind. Or they’ve left the trail and gone home. 
If your net travel rate is 2.0 mph, a 20-mile day means 10 hours of walking, say 7:00 am to 5:00 pm. That’s tedious, but doable. But a 30-miler at that rate would take 15 hours. Most serious hikers could hike a 15-hour day once in a while with a few days’ rest afterwards, but not many could keep that up every day for weeks or months. 
All of which is to say, I will need faster feet and more endurance, or an easier trail, if I’m going to start knocking out 20’s regularly and finish before Katahdin freezes over. I’m hoping for both, at least until I get to the Whites in New Hampshire. Fingers crossed.

As I approached Erwin, I came up on a guy with a huge pack with lots of gear hanging off the back that swayed and jangled as he walked. I thought about taking a picture to remind myself to write about that packing style, but just as I pulled out my phone, I saw something move behind the tree he was walking past. I didn’t get a clear look, but it was black, furry, and smaller than Gus. 
One part of my brain started checking off the list of things it could be – skunk, fox, squirrel, badger, etc. The other part called out, “Dude, look right.” He looks, jumps back, and says, “Oh, no.” Just then, I caught up and saw a pint-sized bear cub hanging on to the base of a 2-ft diameter tree trunk. 
The cub squealed and scampered up the tree, perhaps the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in the woods.  Also, the most terrifying. All of us (two hikers, one cub) were frantically looking around for mama bear, and two of us were trying to film as we fled. All I could think of was that scene from The Revenant. You know, the one where Leonardo sees two bear cubs just before he gets mauled by mama Grizzly. Fortunately, mama stayed hidden in the woods this morning and I got some fantastic, if not a little shaky, footage of a bear cub. 
And that’s how you top seeing a bear yesterday.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663512,"One Month on the AT
We celebrated one month on the trail by getting off the trail. Not permanently, just for a day.
Zero ≠ Nothing
Thru hikers call it “taking a zero” or “zeroing.” What a misnomer. Zero miles on the AT, for sure, but not zero miles or zero things to do. I’ve got a long list that will keep me non-zeroing all day. But to be fair, a nice afternoon nap is on the list.
I’m long overdue for a trip to the laundromat. For the last week, restaurant hostesses have been automatically pointed us toward the outdoor seating. I caught one hostess licking her finger and holding it up in the breeze so she could put us downwind of the other paying clients. My hiking pants are so stiff with dirt and dried up sweat I’m afraid they might shatter. Needless to say, Northstar’s clothes will go in a different machine than mine.
Washing my clothes would be pointless if I don’t get a bath, shave, haircut, hot shower, and then another bath. Drinking water hasn’t been hard to find along the AT in Georgia and North Carolina, but bath-sized streams have been hard to come by and petty frigid when we find one. Loss of my sense of smell over the years has turned out to be a minor blessing.
Chores
I’ll also be looking for an outfitter. I’d like to get a lightweight pad to sit on during breaks to keep my butt dry and to help keep the ticks at bay. Speaking of which, I need to treat my shoes, socks, and outer layers with Permethrin. Several hikers have told me they’ve begun to see more ticks. I read about one hiker being diagnosed with Lyme’s disease already this season. I also need to replace my cathole spade after breaking the blade on a root.
Planning, RePlanning, & ReRePlanning
One of my more important tasks is to re-do my itinerary. I’d like to avoid camping near the busier roads and manage my daily mileage better. One of the challenges of a supported hike versus a backpacking hike is that I can’t just stop when I’m tired or grab a few extra miles when I’m not. My daily mileage is dictated by van-accessible road crossings.
Picking one really nice meetup spot for one day could leave me with either a too short or too long next day, so I have to map out a week or two at a time. I’m only 126 trail miles from Damascus (47 miles as the crow flies), where the annual Trail Days Festival starts in 10 days. I’d like to pass Damascus before then, but be near enough to easily come back to check out the gear displays before the crush.
And unless I can successfully procrastinate once again, I’ll spend some time catching up on email and taking care of a few work items. After my nap.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663575,"On A Clear Day, You Can’t See Anywhere
Would you climb almost 5,000 feet of total elevation for a summit with no view? I would. I did.
A Perfect Trail
The first few miles out from Uncle’s Johnny’s Hostel on the Nolichucky River near Erwin are exactly what you imagine when you visualize taking a walk in the woods. A smooth, soft trail, huge leafy trees, a nearby river, birds singing…so pleasant I almost forgot what was coming – a 20-mile day and and 5,774 feet of total climbing.
But the main climb up Unaka Mountain (5,183 ft) was spread out over almost 14 miles, which made the grades easy. If only the entire AT had climbs like that. Everyone would make it to Katahdin. Or at least out of North Carolina.
Beauty Spot
The climb crossed Indian Grave Gap, where a Catholic missionary was providing trail magic and a nice break. And then it passed through “Beauty Spot.” A local tried to convince me it got its name because that’s where the local pretty girls hang out. To which I replied, “What? Both of them?” But in fact, it was a sloping bald with near 360-degree views over the surrounding valley, well deserving of its name.
Unaka Peak wore a cap of thick conifer forest, too thick to see through or to let sun in, and reminiscent of the Smoky Mountains near Clingman’s Dome. Unaka’s forest wasn’t as primeval as the Smoky’s, but the deeply shaded mossy woods made for a great lunch spot on a warm, sunny day, even without a view.
Out of My Bubble
Once again, I saw almost no one I’d seen before or knew by name. I’m definitely out of my bubble. But everyone I spoke to said the same thing. Most of the people they knew and hiked with since starting the trail are either behind, ahead, or off the trail. So I made a mental note to make a point of talking with the new people I see, repeating what I did after feeling isolated during my first week on the trail.
Climbing With Yogi
Just as I started the climb out of the Nolichucky River Valley, I passed Yogi, a man just a bit younger than me. Yogi’s a Minnesotan, so you know you’ll get more than just a perfunctory hello. Sure enough, by golly, don’t cha know, we talked for the next six miles. We got separated at the Indian Grave Gap trail magic, but since we have about the same itinerary through Damascus, we’ll probably cross paths again. Conversation sure helps the miles speed past.
More Magic
On the descent from Unaka Mountain, Northstar texted that if I hurried I’d get trail magic at Iron Mountain Gap. I arrived at 3:45 pm, just in time for the second to last burger, which became my dinner. My first dinner, to be specific. By 7:00 pm, the food mood kicked in again and my original dinner became second supper.
Wrap Up
Twenty miles felt great. I’m tired, but nothing hurts. I guess that’s my new performance standard.
If you want to see more pictures every day, I usually post 8-12 pics on my Facebook page “The Incident on the Appalachian Trail 2023.” Every so often, I’ll post a reel on Instagram “@theincidentat2023,” usually when I pass a 100-mile marker or a state boundary.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663620,"Tired But Happy
I started out tired. I finished more tired. This one beat me up.
Today’s section had less climbing and fewer miles than yesterday’s, but I wonked on the climb up Roan Mountain. I made it, and kept my pace, but I took no pictures, recorded no video, and did nothing but put one foot in front of the other.
Roan Mountain is capped with a beautiful mossy conifer forest, but I barely noticed it. The ruins of a once-huge resort hotel lie atop the peak, but I walked right past them. (I intended to fetch Northstar and drive back up to tour them, but found out later the Forest Service has closed the road).  There may have been views, but I can't say for sure.
A Bit of My Bubble
I probably would have taken a nap before hiking down the mountain to Carver’s Gap, but I bumped into PhD and Bree just below the summit. PhD somehow discovered that I went to college in their hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. By the time we got to the Gap, I’d gotten a PhD in Michigan outdoors information. The guy has been everywhere. Nice to see them again.
Why So Tired?
I have no idea why this hike beat me up, but I have some likely suspects. I didn’t sleep well. I didn’t eat enough. And I had a long one yesterday.
I can do something about the first two. I’ll be asleep in a few minutes, well before the sun goes down, but only after I finish eating everything and anything in the van. There might be an Advil PM in my future as well. We’ll see if taking care of the first two overcomes the third.
Last night, we drove up a gravel side road a few miles to escape a weedy trail magic crowd at the Gap. We found a great spot and had a nice, quiet evening in our lawn chairs watching the sunset. But after we went to bed, the wind came up and rattled the bike rack all night. We’ll camp a little lower tonight to avoid the wind coming in with the weather. That should help me sleep.
Now THAT’s Quiet
Speaking of quiet, when I started walking this morning the woods were so still, I actually heard a spider web stretched across the trail snap when I broke it with my face.
Off to bed. Tomorrow is another long one.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663720,"A Standout Day
Some days, you see a bear cub. Some days, like today, you walk through flowery glades in the woods. Some days, like today, you walk over miles of scenic balds with forever views.
Most days, you walk through the long green tunnel, slog up steep climbs, and stumble down knee-crushing descents. But unless you’re out here every day you won’t catch the “somedays” or see the contrast that makes days like today stand out.
Today was a gift.
Mystery Solved
I also solved a little mystery today. For the last few weeks, I’d keep seeing hikers I thought I’d left behind. All day long I pass hikers and almost no one passes me. Then, the next day, I’d pass the same people again. How did they get ahead?
It’s simple. They hike later than me. Duh.
I usually start walking by 7:00 am and am done by mid-afternoon. Others hike until nearly dark, which also explains why I pass by so many tents still set up at 9:30 or 10:00 am. That explains most of the mystery, but not all of it.
Mystery Solved, Part II
I stopped in at Mountain Harbors Hostel on Route 19E this afternoon and saw a hiker I’d seen off and on since Georgia. I hadn’t seen her for at least a week, so I asked if she’d been at the hostel for a while. She replied, “Nope, I just got here.”
That was a puzzler, since I’d done some long days, but hadn’t seen her on the trail, at trail magics, or in campsites. So, I asked where she’d hiked in from. She looked off to the side, hesitated a few awkward seconds, and replied, “Uh…I just don’t keep track anymore. I don’t know where I was.”
Right. Some of us might forget the name of a camp spot, but everyone has some sense of where they came from. Then the light bulb went on. She’s been yellow-blazing (skipping miles by catching rides). That’s how she keeps inexplicably showing up without appearing anywhere along the trail. But who cares? If you’re skipping sections, just own it. There’s no referee out here.
The Passing of a Trail Icon
A quick scan of today’s profile as I hiked out of Carver’s Gap revealed that I’d be passing the Overmountain Shelter, a massive red barn with excellent views. It’s also one of the AT’s best-known shelters. Last year, the ATC and Forest Service determined it was structurally unsafe and decided to tear it down. It was supposed to be demolished already.
Based on pictures I’d seen, I’d assumed the trail went right through it, or at least right by it. I eagerly counted down the miles but got distracted and climbed several hundred feet up the next hill before suddenly wondering if I’d passed it. FarOut (my map app) to the rescue.
Sure enough, I was already a half mile past the turnoff. Plus, the shelter lay another quarter mile off the trail. A visit would require an extra 1.5 miles of walking, plus re-climbing the hill I’d just come up. I’d already picked up an extra half-mile and a climb by missing a poorly-marked turn at Grassy Ridge. No thanks.
Fortunately, I got a nice view of it from the hillside. Glad I got to see it before it’s destroyed.
Lunch on Hump Mountain
From there, I climbed several immense grassy balds to the summit of 5,559-foot Hump Mountain. PhD and Bree scrambled up just behind me, along with an ultralighter whose name I missed. We joined two LASH-ers (Long Ass Section Hikers) who were there when I arrived.
The LASH-ers said they were closing in on 2,000 trail miles. Interestingly, they said they’d only slept in tents along the trail three nights during their multi-year trek. There’s more than one way to hike the AT.
I didn’t catch what started it, but the ultralighter went on a (self-described) rant about his ultralight equipment. He claimed to have a base weight of eight pounds. Base weight accounts for everything you’re carrying except food and water. Or is supposed to. You can only get to eight pounds by leaving something home. Like a tent, stove, extra clothes, and lots of creature comforts.
Ultralight Math
One of the LASH-ers apparently made a snarky comment about how his camping must be miserable, because he immediately responded that he’d made it through the Smoky’s without getting wet. Well, he said, except for his arms below his elbows and his legs below his knees. Hmm, I’m thinking that counts as getting pretty wet, but I’m no ultralighter, so what do I know.
Then I noticed that he was carrying a paper copy of the AT Trail Guide. I have that book, but don’t carry it in my pack because it weighs at least a half pound. If his base weight is eight pounds, and he carries a half-pound book which accounts for about 5% of his pack weight, I think he needs to check his scale. I’ve long suspected that some ultralighters fudge their numbers.
Second Lunch
I got to Route 19E just as the skies opened up and dumped on me. Clearly, the rain was a sign from God to hustle down to Mountain Harbors Hostel and grab a burger and fries from their food truck. Except that the food truck wasn’t open, so I settled for an ice cream bar and cold Belgian White. Kinda gross, but kinda not too. The things we eat on the trail.
Wrap Up
Walking down to 19E, I passed a sign saying I was leaving North Carolina. Right. For about the thousandth time. Call me skeptical. I haven’t known whether I was in Carolina or Tennessee for weeks. I have a feeling I’ll be back tomorrow.On the climb out of the 19E gap, I saw SOCO and Bluebird hiking south with suspiciously small packs. Slackers. They’ve come over to the dark side and are now slacking the heck out of the trail. These are my people.Four weeks on the AT and I continue to see new flowers. Today’s newbies: Red-Berried Elder, Bittercress, Cream Violet, Woodland Stonecrop, and Ground Ivy.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663760,"Who Designed Today’s Trail? Kudos.
Weirdly, the AT didn’t go up and over all the peaks and ridges today. Instead, it pleasantly followed the contours for long stretches and even decided to let me tour some of the valleys for a change. The flatter traverses allowed me to average a little over 2.6 mph over 21.5 miles, including breaks. Sweet.
The valley tours also included a gorgeous walk along the brown, rain-swollen Elk River, and a lovely creek-side trek along the West Fork of Laurel Creek. Plus, it passed three impressive waterfalls – Jones Falls, Mountaineer Falls, and Hardcore Cascades.
I’m hoping it’s a sign of trails to come.
400 Miles & Goals
I passed the 400-mile point early this morning. The 100-mile markers really help me with the mental side of thru hiking. Maine and Mt. Katahdin are too far away to be effective goals, so thinking about them is almost overwhelming. So many things could go wrong between today and Maine.
Instead, I focus on daily goals like the top of the next climb or the next cool spot along the trail – a waterfall, a view, or a peak. Just finishing the day’s mileage is a realistic goal. Beyond that, the next 100-mile marker, the next trail town, the next State line, or the next zero day are effective goals. I know I can make it that far.
Almost Rainy
Today was the wettest I’ve ever been without getting rained on. The forecast called for showers all day, but all we got was the humidity. The air was pregnant with rain – almost delivered, but not quite. Or maybe just delivered. The woods looked and felt like it had just stopped raining. The trail was soggy, the leaves dripped with moisture, and wisps of mist hung on the edges of things. Which, now that I think of it, is exactly how I felt.
But the moisture quieted the woods and twisted the color spectrum. Lichens, moss, and fungi stood out from the valleys’ dense foliage. Wet Spring green is greener than regular Spring green.
Slacker Revolution
Everyone is slackpacking. Full packs were the exception along the trail today. I think thru hikers feel that, after 400 miles of toting 40-lb packs up and down countless peaks, they’ve paid their dues and have little prove. They’re also tired. The local hostels, of which there are many, have figured this out and are pushing their shuttle/slackpacking services.
Slacking makes for happy hikers. Mostly. Except for a contingent of the thru-hiker crowd that despises slackpackers as cheaters. But many of the same folks venerate ultralighters. Does it make sense to criticize one group for lightening their packs and praise another for the exact same thing? What if my slackpack weighs more than an ultralighter’s pack? Which of us is the hero? Thru-hike morality is complex.
Do Shoes Count For Pack Weight?
This morning, I saw the ultralighter from yesterday’s lunch stop on Hump Mountain. He was walking very slowly and gingerly out of a shelter I passed around 9:30 am. I stopped to say hi and noticed he was shoeless. He said he was going to try barefooting because he was sick of walking in wet shoes. This was the same guy who “stayed dry” in the Smoky’s, except for his arms and legs.
Hiking shoeless seemed like a perfect plan for a wet, muddy, slippery day on a very rooty and rock trail section. By the way, I’m now calling him Mowgli. Wanna take a bet on whether Mowgli is still walking the jungle barefoot next time I see him?
Called It
I walked past yet another “Leaving North Carolina” sign today. If I carried a marker, I’d have added “Again” to the sign. And every other one I see in the future. I wonder if they have them in Virginia?

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663819,"My Favorite Prankster
The AT pulled out its usual bag of tricks again today for the hike over Pond Mountain. A big, long climb with false starts, false summits, and finally, the tried and true missing the summit by a few feet and giving no view for the effort. Plus, acres of poison ivy along the creeks and lakeshore. Classic AT. I missed you the last two days.
Looking at Pond Mountain’s map profile before hiking it messed with my head. The hike features a steep, two-mile, 1,800-foot climb, and then an equally steep drop right back down. It looked intimidating on the map, but wasn’t that hard on the trail. I’ve climbed worse ones this Spring.
Today, I climbed the mountain alone, aside from Brandon Sanderson’s “The Lost Metal” whispering in my right ear. Yes, I’ve finally given in and resorted to audiobooks to get me up the big climbs. I not only did the big climb alone, I walked the entire day alone. I didn’t see a single thru-hiker on the trail all day. I have no clue where everyone went.
Missing Mom on Mother’s Day
I also missed my mom today, but I’d like to think she was smiling down on me. She handed me Bryson’s book all those years ago and inadvertently started this whole AT thing for me. I think she’d be pleased that I’m finally taking my walk in the woods. If she were still with us, she’d have a list of questions for me written in her little book. She’d sit me down, make tea, and we’d go over her questions one by one.
Trail Ethics I: Aqua Blazing
I stopped in at Boots Off Hostel for an early lunch. I also wanted to ask about an Aqua Blaze (boating instead of hiking) option I’d heard about. I couldn’t figure out how hikers got back to the trail from the other end of Watauga Lake, since the AT sits atop a ridge miles away from any point you could reach by boat.
But the hostel’s food area was locked up with no one around to answer questions, so I moseyed on and got my questions answered on the interweb. The hostel offers $90/person guided sit-on-top kayak rentals from the south end of the Lake (Mile 428.6) to a bay a short drive away from TN91 (Mile 449.1). Basically, that’s the worst part of today’s hike and all of tomorrow’s.
A crew was loading up kayaks and getting their safety briefing as I left. I love running rivers, but I have no interest in lake paddling or Yellow Blazing, so their Aqua Blaze option wasn’t even a little tempting.
Trail Ethics II: Blue Blazing
Like the Devil in the wilderness, the AT offered me a second temptation. This test came in the heat of the day. I hadn’t taken a break or eaten for a long while because the hostel store was closed and because the dense poison ivy crop along the trail along the lake left me no safe place to sit. And by now, we all know what I’m like when I’m hot, tired, hungry, and nearly out of water.
I was more than a little hangry when I finally hit the paved road the AT shares for a half mile near Wilber Dam. As I slogged up the black asphalt in the heat and humidity, I reached a junction point where the trail split off from the road. The AT headed back into the woods and up a ridge before recrossing the paved road a mile later. I’d planned to meet Northstar at the second crossing.
The White Blaze option along AT’s path was steep, rocky, long, and lined with poison ivy. The Blue Blaze option along road was shaded, had a soft grassy shoulder to walk on, and was considerably less steep than the trail, bypassing the peak that the trail summited. The road was also a half mile shorter to the crossing where Northstar was already waiting with some La Croix’s on ice.
What to Choose?
I stood at the junction point with two little hikers on my shoulders. One had a blue pointy tail and horns, and the other a pure white-blazed halo. Each whispered their temptations and virtues in ears, and derided the other’s arguments. I know I always say, “Hike your own hike, just enjoy yourself and the mountains. Don’t worry about the ‘rules’.” But somehow this choice seemed important.
I chose the trail.
If I’d been in danger of dehydration, on the verge of collapsing from fatigue, or at real risk of contacting poison ivy, I’d have stuck with the road. But I wasn’t. I was just tired and cranky. And I knew that the mile I’d skip would haunt me. Just a little, but enough to push me up that last hill.
In the movies, the trail would reward my purity by giving me a nice view, a new flower, a bear sighting, or a reunion with an old friend. Unfortunately, my life is not that well scripted, nor do I have that kind of relationship with the AT. The climb was steep and rocky, the trail missed the summit by a few feet, and the trail option offered nothing more than the same hot, humid, woods I’d walked in all morning.
Even so, I think I made the right choice for me.
Long-Beard Saves the Day
Just after I started hiking this morning, I saw Long-Beard walking packless near his tent along Laurel Creek. I hadn’t seen him since Hot Spring, so I reached out to give him a fist bump. But he put up both hands like he wanted a double high-five. I started to comply, but he said, “You should stay back. I’m not feeling well.” He said he’d been up all night with diarrhea and vomiting.
Norovirus, probably. I thanked him profusely for warning me and got the heck out of there. I’ve heard reports of Noro outbreaks all along the trail since Standing Bear Hostel. I’m starting to wonder about potential Noro issues at Trail Days this weekend.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663897,"There But for the Grace of God…
I’m just one stumble away from ending my hike. Today, I stepped over a log while adjusting the strap on my trekking pole, caught my heel, and slid awkwardly, twisting my knee. Fortunately, I stopped my fall with my other pole before completely trashing my knee and was able to walk it off.
I trip over roots or rocks at least five times a day. I don’t fall, thanks to my poles and an overworked guardian angel, but you never know. I read a blog yesterday by someone who did a faceplant and ended up with stitches, a concussion, brain trauma, and a trip home. They say it takes five million steps to reach Katahdin. Any one of them could be the last.
Dog-gone It
Gus gave me that look this morning as I left the van. I’ve been leaving him with Northstar because of the rain forecasts, the mileage, and the poison ivy. He’d been up late last night looking at the weather satellites and the trail profile and was convinced today was his day. So, I relented and invited him along.
He followed me obediently up the first half-mile, 500 foot climb before reminding me that although I’d filled his food bag and water bottle, and put his collapsible dish out, I’d left it all on the counter in the van. So, we got a bonus mile and a second shot at the first climb of the day. He was particularly excited about running down the trail to catch Northstar before she drove off. He thinks I walk too slow.
Is There a Ridge in Mirkwood?
Most of the route today followed a long, but more or less level, ridge. The trail had some up and down sawtoothing, but no big climbs or descents. I don’t want to jinx it, but this trail is getting easier.
When we walked atop the ridge, we got a nice cooling breeze. When the trail dropped off the ridge, we descended into a humid green tunnel. Those sections were like walking in Tolkien’s Mirkwood – we had only the narrow brown path in front of us and an opaque jungle of the thick green summer foliage on either side.
My New Normal
Despite the thrill of setting new records for spider webs in the face in the morning, I had to pull out the audiobook again today to get me through the afternoon doldrums. I treasure my time in the woods, but I’m also getting more accustomed to it. I find myself less likely to stop to photograph plants I’ve seen before, and more likely to be thinking about my mileage.
I’m also accepting the fact that I’ll probably walk most of the AT alone. I chat with hikers I pass or see at the water sources, but my hiking and camping style, tend to make me the odd man out. I start hiking early, while most people are still sleeping, maintain a brisk pace, rarely getting passed, and knock off by mid-afternoon. Plus, I camp near the road crossings in our van.
Trail Days in Damascus
But the hikers I have met are all talking about the Trail Days Festival that runs this weekend in Damascus. There are two basic responses: (1) Hoo-wee! Par-tay!, and (2) Ugh. Crowds, Noro, noise, and filth – no thanks. I lean toward the latter, but we’ll probably stop by Friday morning when the vendors show up. I’m hoping to get a replacement basket on one of my trekking poles, meet The Trek folks, pick up some new Injinji toes socks, and then escape back to the lonely woods.
Own It!
A lot of hikers are trying to time their hike to arrive in Damascus Friday morning, which might explain why the trail has been so lonely that past few days. One couple I met told me they’d realized that they couldn’t do the pace required to get there on Friday, so they had a friend drive them ahead 26 miles.
That’s exactly what I was writing about yesterday. They just owned their yellow blaze and were totally oblivious or unconcerned about how anyone might judge them for that. Good for them.
Wrap Up
I walked into the TN91 parking area by 3:00 pm, our camp for the night, to find some trail magic, plus Onesimus with his never-ending supply of ice cream sandwiches.  We chatted for a bit, before settling down in the van for the night.
Not long before dark, the Boots Off van pulled into the lot with their load of aqua blazers, one of whom was Yogi, who I’d met on the climb out of Erwin last week. I popped out and said howdy. He’ll be heading for Damascus tomorrow too, so I’ll try to catch him and find out about his lake paddle.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663911,"What THEY Want You to Think
When I went to elementary school, THEY told me “Tennessee” is a real place. THEY even gave me a wooden puzzle of the United States with a piece called “Tennessee.” THEY in the MEDIA will broadcast stories that supposedly happened in “Tennessee” or sporting events with the word “Tennessee” in the team names.
That all may be true in books or on maps, but out on the trail, there is no such place.
Evidence = Proof
Consider: Every single time THEY put up a sign indicating the supposed “Tennessee” border, I’d soon discover I was back in North Carolina. Or I’d pass another sign telling me I was now leaving North Carolina. Without ever leaving “Tennessee.”
Need more proof? THEY also make up songs about a place called “Rocky Top, Tennessee.” But I was there. It was neither rocky nor at the top. And it wasn’t until the next day that I passed a sign telling me I had finally entered “Tennessee.”
More Evidence = More Proofier
More? Even I still believed until yesterday when the following incontrovertible truths finally opened my eyes:
The AT had no significant climbs or descents over 22 miles today and I averaged just over 3 mph for the day. Clearly, I was not in a real place on the AT.I started out walking in deep fog through grassy fields with farm gates and stiles. Obviously, that only happens in England, not in the Appalachian forests.I met someone claiming to be “Wheels.” The real Wheels is at least 100 miles ahead of me by now. The fake one had been briefed to spread some story about catching Noro at a hostel, but I recognize a cover story when I hear one. Plus, after I passed the fake one, she never caught up. A real Wheels would have passed me in minutes.The 18 miles I walked in “Tennessee” were foggy, rainy, and miserable. But when I reached another one of those state border signs, the sun immediately came out. Coincidence? I think not.
The Proofiest Evidence
I’d seen Yogi leave TN91 last night after getting dropped off by the Boots Off Aqua Blaze shuttle. He said he would camp just a little way up the trail. But I left at 7:00 am and never saw him…until I got to Virginia. That’s right, not in “Tennessee.” After one of those “border signs.”
As if that wasn’t proof enough, he told me a “Tennessee” story about a bear chasing him down the trail. Yes, yes, I know. A “Yogi” bear story. Northstar pointed that out to me, because I’m too obtuse to make up such a pun on purpose.
Yogi’s Bear Story
Yogi claimed to have passed two bears, one quite large and another smaller one, each on different sides of the trail. He stopped to take a blurry, Sasquatch-quality photo before quickly moving on.
I’ve seen the photo and it’s everything I’ve described it as. It shows a lot of wet green woods and an obvious brown smudge that is clearly a bear. Or wet blanket. Or his thumb. Regardless, the photo is compelling enough for a History Channel unsolved mystery special. But I digress.
After making his escape, Yogi looked back to discover that the large bear was following him down the trail, huffing and grunting as it upped its pace to keep up. Steeped in bear repellent lore, Yogi turned to face the bear, made himself look as large as possible, and yelled, “F*** Off, Bear!” He said he tried different pitches, tones, volume, and emphases, but to no avail.
The big bear would stop when he stopped, but after he yelled, it would keep coming. As an aside, once he told me where this occurred, I recalled hearing yelling in the distance at about that time but couldn’t make out the content. I also explained to Yogi that perhaps in bear-world, “F*** Off!” signifies more of an invitation than a warning. You never can tell with bears. Especially in “Tennessee.” But, again, I digress.
Yogi then tried a less subtle approach but was foiled by a sudden lack of rocks or sticks along the trail. Once again, only in “Tennessee” would a hiker be unable to find rocks along the trail. Everywhere else, they line the trail to trip us or twist our ankles. Eventually, perhaps because he was near the Virginia border, he found a suitable rock and pitched a grounder at the bear, bouncing one right off its nose.
Somehow, that worked. Or perhaps the bear decided Yogi didn’t mean what he’d said, or he was simply far enough away from the smaller bear, and it disappeared into the woods. To be safe, Yogi carried two softball-size rocks for a full quarter mile down the trail. And it worked. The bear never returned.
If I hadn’t seen the brown smudge on his picture for myself, I’d have thought he made it all up.
Virginia, An Actual Real Place
Once I escaped “Tennessee,” not only did the sun come, the trail went downhill (gradually!) for four miles, my oldest son called and had enough cell reception for a conversation that got me all the way to Damascus, at which point I saw Yogi only a few yards ahead of me. They’d even put up banners and party flagging for us.
I’d told Northstar to park near a cheeseburger and I’d find her. She did and so did I.
Note that all this good stuff happened outside of “Tennessee.” Just sayin’.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663947,"Hmm, What Do I Need?
I hiked 126.4 miles and climbed about 29,000 feet in the last seven days, averaging just over 18 mpd. I walked into Damascus tired, footsore, dirty, smelly, shaggy, and seriously behind on my calorie count. And yes, Tentman, I could use a frosty cold one.
Damascus is set up to take care of those kinds of problems. I ate, showered, ate more, slept on clean sheets, ate again, did the laundry, got a haircut, took Gus to the dog park for some fetch, and ate more. Then I lounged around with Northstar all afternoon. And then we ate dinner. But the Dollar General is still open...
Lesson Learned
One word of advice: small town barbershops in the south may not be best place for a Phoenix boy to get a haircut. Fortunately, I brought my favorite Alaska ball cap. Expect to see it in photos for a few weeks.
Batter Up!
Tomorrow I’ll start on Virginia’s 541.7 miles of trail. That’s 71 more miles than I’ve done so far, and about 25% of the entire AT. I’m guessing Virginia will take me five weeks, Lord willing, two more pairs of shoes, and a few more audiobooks.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664048,"Back on the Trail
It felt good to be walking the woods again after a day off. I love the woods. It’s where I belong. But to be honest, I felt a little depressed and burdened after Northstar dropped me off early this morning at one of the many US58 crossings for my 17-mile walk back to Damascus.
We’d intended to camp at the US58 trailhead, but when we drove out there yesterday afternoon, we discovered there was no space to camp and no cell service. Northstar needs cell service for family reasons, so we headed back to town and boondocked on Main Street across from some porta-potties set up for Trail Days.
Since the trailhead had no place to park and no cell coverage, it worked better as a drop off spot than as a meetup spot. Plus, hiking from there back to Damascus would give me a chance to check out some of the vendor displays at Trail Days and maybe catch up with a few friends I hadn’t seen for a while.
Funk, Not Funky
I’m not quite ready to write about what was/is bothering me. Perhaps in a few days or weeks. For today, you only need to know that I was in a bit of a funk when I set out. And still was after about three miles, when the AT hooked up with and followed the Virginia Creeper Trail (VCT) for about a mile.
The VCT is a popular biking/hiking path that follows an old railway (the Virginia Creeper) grade. The VCT is wide, smooth, level, and well-graded. In other words, it’s a treat for the feet. As a bonus, it follows Whitetop Laurel Creek, crossing the lively trout stream on dozens of refurbished wood-decked bridges. The creek’s running water and small rapids provided a perfect harmony to the wind’s tree music.
Choices
After a mile, I reached a junction point where the AT headed back into hills, leaving the VCT’s gentle path along the creek behind. I stopped and looked at the map. The VCT and the AT both went back to Damascus over about the same distance. In fact, the AT paralleled the VCT in numerous places.
Standing at the junction, I had to wonder why are there two trails? Why wouldn’t the AT just follow the lovely VCT route? I scanned the AT route to see if it would take me to some lovely clifftop vistas, pass by waterfalls, or visit interesting historical sites. Nope. The AT just did what the AT always does – more climbs up wooded ridges with no views, more switchbacks over rough, rocky terrain, and more steep descents right back down to the VCT alignment.
Now, I love the AT, the woods, and seeing where the trail takes me. But I’ve seen a lot of that lately. The VCT is unique, a one-of-a-kind feature along the AT. People come to Damascus from all over the USA for the sole purpose of biking the VCT. It’s a unique feature that is part of Appalachian history. It’s also a lovely place to walk.
Stymied
So, I stood at the junction point, stymied over which way to go. I actually walked 20 feet up the AT, but met a hiker coming down and backed up to let him pass on the narrow trail. Gus looked at me, wondering what was up. I didn’t want to skip any part of the AT, but I really liked the idea of following the VCT along the creek. I love walking by rivers.
Just as I reluctantly and dutifully turned to go back up the AT, another group of thru-hikers came down the trail. The lead hiker, Red Beard, wore a ball cap with a cocktail umbrella stuck to the top. The hat had the words “Hike Your Own Hike” in huge letters on the bill. If that’s not a sign from God, I don’t know what is.
Hike Your Own Hike!
I took the VCT and that made all the difference.
I immediately felt some of my burden lift. Gus and I had a great walk, with plenty of space to walk side by side, and spots where he could jump in the creek for a swim. I saw parts of the Appalachians I might not otherwise have seen. Most of all, we had fun.*
And this is supposed to be fun, right?

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664114,"The Best So Far
I have a new favorite section of the AT:  Whitetop Mountain to the Grayson Highlands.
The views. Gracious goodness, the views. I could see forever, ridgeline after ridgeline of tree-covered mountains, fading bluer and bluer into eternity. And when the views disappeared, deep green, sweet smelling, soft-floored, softly scratchy, spruce forests replaced them. When perfect replaces better.
Deep inside one of the spruce groves, the 500-mile point was marked out in fist-size pieces of black and white granodiorite. Five hundred miles! Slightly longer than our 2017 Camino de Santiago hike, but not quite as long as our 2019 South West Coast Path trek. In a few days, I’ll be ¼ of the way to Katahdin.
Grayson Highlands
After leaving the spruce forest, I descended into Grayson Highlands State Park, which would be a treat to walk through even without the herds of wild ponies. The rock outcrops, meadows, views, brisk wind, and hills reminded me of Scotland. Or maybe it’s the other way around.
At Grayson Highlands, I walked past three small herds of wild ponies, two of which included foals so young they still struggled to stand and walk. I walked in between the ponies, close enough to touch them with my trekking poles, but quietly enough that they barely acknowledged my passing.
I Wonder If I Could Have Made Him Sit and Rollover Too?
But the rest of the day’s hike had its moments too. I saw four deer along Elk Ridge. The second one darted across the trail right in front of us, causing Gus to start to give chase. I immediately shouted, “No! Place! (“Place” is his command to get in the heel position). He stopped, turned around, and came quickly back, obedient but giving me his side-eye look to let me know I’m a killjoy.
I looked up and saw that the deer had also stopped when I commanded Gus to stop. It just stood there looking at us, seemingly waiting for the next command. But when I pulled out my phone to snap a picture, he must have figured out that, as a wild animal, he didn’t have to obey and bounded off. After watching the deer disappear, we walked around a bend and bumped into a pair of day hikers who were still laughing over what they’d witnessed.
Silver & Gold
I bumped into Yogi again and met Stormcrow for the first time. Both were happy to have escaped Damascus before Trail Days, preferring the quiet woods to a rowdy town.
After connecting with Northstar at the end of the day, I drove her up Whitetop Mountain to enjoy the views and the racing clouds. On the way down, we stopped at Elk Garden for break, where she met Five Cats. Five Cats is thru hiking with his girlfriend and their (white) golden doodle Mookie. I’d passed them several times during the last three days, but Mookie is a tad reactive, so we’d never spoken.
Five Cats wanted to know if the Railroad Restaurant was really within walking distance like it said in the FarOut app. I recalled seeing it along US58, about five or six miles away. Having just walked 500 miles, we decided that just about everything on the East Coast is walking distance, but he appreciated the ride down the mountain and back all the same.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664167,"The AT Giveth, But Not Always
Northstar walked up to the AT with me early this morning to visit the Grayson Highland ponies, but the AT was having a little snit and decided to not to share.  It also decided to punish her for hiking in Chaco’s and took a chunk of her heel. Bad AT.
Of course, as soon as she headed down the Blue Blaze trail back to the van, I saw a herd of horses in the distance. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be beef horses, but lovely creatures all the same. I had a double cheeseburger later in the day in their honor.
Into the Green Woods & Deep into My Own Head
After the Highlands, I walked back into the deep green woods, retreated into my own head, and stayed there for 18 miles. I cinched up my hip belt, strapped on my trekking poles, and ground out the miles, barely stopping to take a picture or record a video. I even forgot to take any breaks.
Without Gus along, I had no need to stop at any stream crossings while he slurped up the local water supply. Nor did I need to pull out his kibble bowl, so I just kept walking until I got Dickey Gap. I pounded out 18 miles in just under 6 hours.
Why Do Thru-Hikers Thru-Hike?
I saw no thru hikers except Stormcrow, who told me this was his third thru-hike. When I asked him why he’s thru hiking, he said he had no idea. Then he thought for a minute and said that maybe it’s because he likes the forests. When Northstar asked Five Cats the same question yesterday, she got the same “I don’t really know” answer. I hear that answer a lot.
I think all the thru hikers are either at Trail Days, they’re keeping pace with me, or we’re missing each other because of my up early/finish early schedule. I did see a lot of weekend backpackers though.
Déjà Vu All Over Again
Most of the weekenders keep to themselves, but I had more than one notice my purple AT Thru-Hiker tag and ask about it. The encounter always goes like this: “Uh, you’re not thru hiking, are you?” The question is asked with a quizzical look and tentative tone. I answer, “Yes I am,” knowing what the next question will be. The next question comes out hesitantly and skeptically, “But you have such a small pack.” Yup, called it.
So I answer, “Yes, ma’am, I’m doing a supported hike. I meet my wife every night. We live in our van. I only need to carry a small pack.” They cannot hide the disappointment/betrayal/disgust at having met a cheater instead of a “real” thru hiker. One lady today glared hateful at my hiker tag during our entire conversation. I was a little concerned she was going to tear it off like she was my commanding officer and I was a disgraced junior staffer.
I need to come up with a better story. Maybe I should be an uber-ultralighter with a four-pound base weight. Or maybe I’m product testing space-age technology that packs up super efficiently. Or perhaps offer to do a pack shakedown for their own huge packs and throw out all sorts of things they actually do need. Or smile politely and not worry about it.
Boy Scouts. Ish.
Northstar and I also met a troop of Boy Scouts, who apparently are girls now. The troop didn’t have a single boy. That is, no boys. I assume all boys of that age are single. When Northstar asked if they were Girl Scouts, one young lady answered, “We are Boy Scouts. We don’t sell cookies. We go camping. Every weekend.” Wow. That’s impressive.
Northstar persisted, asking if they weren’t all just “Scouts” now. That turned into an answer about lawsuits, discrimination, gender, and bureaucracy. All very interesting stuff, I’m sure, but I found myself longing to be alone in the deep green woods.
Walking & Thinking
Which I was for most of the day. I think I’m working out my problem, or at least some of it. The deep, green, lonely woods are a perfect place for that. Or, as St. Augustine once said, “Solvitur Ambulando,” which means, “It is solved by walking.”

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664247,"Planning
Living the vanlife along the trail means van-accessible road locations dictate my hiking mileage. I might want to hike 20 miles every day, but usually I have to choose 12, 15, or 24 miles because that’s where the road crossings fall along the trail.
Figuring out which roads are van-accessible can be a crap shoot. The FarOut app helps, as it marks the location of every road that crosses the AT and notes whether it is paved or unpaved. But FarOut generally doesn’t say whether road is drivable, so I try to stick with State highways or named, paved roads whenever possible.
Sometimes, if my only choices are unpaved forest service roads, I’ll post a question on the AT 2023 Facebook page, contact some of the local shuttle drivers, or look at Google Earth imagery to sleuth out the driving conditions, particularly if the weather forecast is bad.  Every once in awhile I forget to check.
Providence
Yesterday was one of those once-in-awhiles. Providentially, on our return from Marion after a resupply mission, the idea to check out tomorrow’s pickup point popped into my head. So, we turned around and made the circuitous drive off VA16 toward Glade Mountain Road. Not only was it a named road, FarOut assured me that it was maintained by the US Forest Service.
The locals disagreed. At the end of the paved road, a local farmer had posted a sign claiming that Glade Mountain Road was private, with no trespassing allowed. Even if I wanted to argue the point with the farmer, which is a risky proposition in Appalachia, trees overhung the rutted dirt road so low that we’d be sure to destroy our roof-mounted solar panels if we tried to drive any further.
Had we not checked, Northstar would have hit this blockage on her way to pick me up, and I would have been either sitting on the mountain all night or grudgingly turning an already long 18.3-mile day into a brutal 23-mile day. So, we revised the plan and made it into a shorter, 14.8-mile day, which came with its own set of blessings.
Coincidence
First, I saw my third bear on the ridge just after I hiked out of Dickey Gap. Well, part of a small bear. Not the bitey end, the part that’s visible as it runs away. And once again, no part of the mama bear. Second, I heard a couple of spiders wolf-whistling me as I passed, probably because my hair and beard were even more silvery than usual as they were draped with a record number of early morning spider webs.
Then, I met Birdsong climbing up from the South Fork of the Holston River. He’s a nice young man with solid Kentucky manners, who just started a flip-flop thru hike at Damascus “just in time to miss all that Trail Days mess.” My kind of guy.
At the top of the climb, I stopped to chat with Slapshot, a LASH-er from Calgary. He mentioned that he and Birdsong were heading to Marion for a resupply, so I offered to drive them in, something I couldn’t have done if I’d stuck with my original pickup point. We agreed to meet at the Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area Headquarters a few hours later.
When I pulled into the NRA HQ at 12:30, Birdsong was there talking with Chili Pepper and Moose Jaw, two hikers I’d never met. They turned out to be from Tucson and worked in the same consulting field as me. Small world.
Reunions
Then, just as Slapshot walked into the parking area, a compact car pulled up. The doors opened and Machina, Haze, The Walrus, two other hikers, the driver, and her dog all clown-car’d out of the vehicle, each with a full backpack. I don’t how they fit, let alone managed to sit inside it for the curvy two-hour drive from Damascus. Machina said Wheels is only 20 miles behind. Just yesterday, I’d concluded I’d never see any of them again.
None of that would have been possible if I’d stuck to my original plan. Weird.
An Agenda Item
Every day since I walked into Damascus, I’ve passed a woman who hikes with little furry dog she keeps on a long leash. Like most little dogs, it barks at bigger dogs. Gus is a bigger dog. Not by much, but enough to meet her little dog’s criteria. Gus usually walks off-leash, but always right behind me in the heel position, not counting the odd deer-chase in the woods.
Every time this woman sees Gus, she squawks out something in what sounds like German, grabs her little dog (which is already on a leash), glares at me, and says something. I think she’s scolding me, but I’m too deaf to make it out, and I certainly don’t want to stick around lest she keel over with a stress-induced heart attack. Gus, of course, couldn’t care less about this little dog or the squawking lady. He just walks on by without even looking at them.
Tomorrow, Gus will be taking a zero with Northstar, so I plan to meet and befriend this woman. Failing that, I need to either figure out what she’s saying or somehow reassure her that Gus and I have no interest in her excitable little friend.

This trail. Some days it leaves me grinning ear to ear. Other days it sees me grinning and kicks me in the teeth. Today, I’ve got a bloody grin, my head’s spinning, my eyes are crossed, and I can’t wait to get out there again. Thank you, sir, may I please have another?
Boondocking With the Feds
The mileage to Nick’s Creek Road made for a good stopping point, but offered no trailhead parking. So, after we returned from delivering Slapshot and Birdsong to Marion, we boondocked in the far corner of the Mt. Rogers NRAHQ. Wheels caught up and invited us for pizza delivery at the Partnership Shelter around the other side of the HQ, but her text didn’t come through until after midnight.
I woke early, drove the mile over to Nick’s Creek Road, and was hiking by 6:30 am, mostly so we’d be gone by the time the USFS staff showed up for work. I planned to hike 11 miles to US11 and eat a second breakfast at one of the two restaurants there. After a tasty meal, I’d decide whether I wanted to hike another 10 miles to VA 610 or stop early.
Coming Home
The hike over to US11 went great. I had the trail all to myself again. Well, me and the spider webs. Catabwa Rhododendron and Mountain Laurel, now in full bloom, added bright colors to what was mostly a long green tunnel. A few moderate climbs and some rocky sections slowed my pace compared to the last few days, but I also got to walk along a little brook on a soft carpet of last season’s oak leaves.
As I descended out of the hills into the US11/I-81 corridor, the trail ran through open meadows bordered by thin lines of flowering trees. Growing up, we called those meadow bordering trees “the woods.” We built tree houses in them, fought the Germans with stick guns, and spied on our friends and neighbors from their deep cover.
The AT’s path through the meadows had been recently mowed, just like my neighbor mowed paths for us to play on in Grandpa Russell’s fallow pastures. Even the wildflowers reminded me of home – dandelions, cow parsley, and white clover. Coincidentally, I grew up on US11, although our home was three states north in Lafayette, New York.
Full of happy memories and warm fuzzies, I could hear the US11 crossing in the distance, and imagined my delicious second breakfast just up the road. What a perfect day.
Cue the AT’s Evil Twin
I texted Northstar to invite her to join me for brunch. She replied that the van wouldn’t start. Again. She’d had the same problem yesterday, but we thought changing the fob battery had fixed it. Nope. She’d tried everything she’d found on the internet, but nothing worked. While reading her texts and replying, I missed a turn and ended up in a featureless wood a quarter mile off the trail.
I Guess That Counts as Second Breakfast
FarOut got me back on the AT and down to US11, but when I walked up to the highly recommended Sweetwater Venue, it was closed. Despite the “OPEN. Come on in” sign out front. No problem. The El Burrito Loco right across the highway offered tempting breakfast burritos. Just not on Mondays.
So, I settled on the Exxon station convenience market where I made a meal of hot tea, Gatorade, M&M’s (“sharing” size, but I didn’t), and Pringles. I’m pretty sure I got all four basic food groups: salt, sugar, caffeine, and crunch. Yum.
Paid For Words
While I sat and munched, Pay-it-Forward (PiF), an ultralighter who since 2018 has done the PCT (3), CDT (1), and AT (2) walked up and sat down across the table. PiF operates at a higher level of intensity than most humans. He radiates energy. He left Springer Mountain on May 1st, walks 4 mph for 8-10 hours a day, and routinely knocks out 30- to 40-mile days.
We had a great conversation, though it was a bit like drinking out of a firehose. Here’s a sampling:
“You’ve got a very small pack. Are you thru-hiking?” We all know where that conversation is going. And it did, mostly.“Have you done any other long-distance hikes?” I started to describe our Camino de Santiago and English Coast Path hikes, but he interrupted saying, “No, I mean REAL hikes. Not those walks where you stay in those hostels and eat in restaurants.” I laughed and told him about the van.“You look like Bryon Cranston’s Walter White character from Breaking Bad.” Yes, the soulless, meth-dealing, old man, dying of pancreatic cancer. Thank you. Actually, a former Pastor of ours told me the same thing many times.
But we found common ground over our disdain of shelters, the 20-something partier crowd, and Trail Days, and how solo hiking allows you time to work out your problems. He also passed along this nugget: When your feet start to hurt in the afternoon, it’s time to think about swapping out your shoes. When they hurt in the morning, swap them out immediately. Lately, my feet hurt in the late afternoon, and I’ve got about 400 miles on my current pair of Altras, so he’s spot on. Time to swamp them out.
Need Company?
Just as we’d both finished our Exxon delicacies, Northstar pulled in, having figured out how to get the van going somehow. Something about cell phone interference with the keyless fob. Brilliant! She passed off Gus, who’d spent the entire morning sitting on the passenger seat and crying for me.
Northstar agreed to pick me up at VA610 around 3:30, saying she planned to spend the afternoon trying to verify her solution to the key fob problem. Gus and I headed off through the deep grass paths through the meadows below the next climb into the forests.
Anyone Know an Honest Mechanic?
Cell phone interference was not the problem. It’s a known manufacturer’s defect with the RAM ProMaster’s radio frequency hub module. “Known,” as in known to dealers, not as in known to people who drive them and depend on them to facilitate their AT hikes. If we don’t replace it, she risks getting stranded in one of the remote places we camp.
This is the short version. If I tell you the long version, one of you will be driving out here to take her away from all this. I’m leaving out all the dealers she called who couldn’t/wouldn’t do the work or told her “Darlin’, y’all ain’t from around here” type stories. I’m also omitting the details of her tour of southern Virginia chasing down false leads.
She finally found a dealer in Christiansburg who can do the factory replacement, 1.5 hours away. But not until next week, though they agreed to let us drop it off tomorrow morning. Enterprise would provide a free rental car. Yeah, right. But they would rent us one, but not until tomorrow afternoon.
She’s a saint.
Zero Day, Anyone?
When she met me at VA610 she’d about had it. So, we packed up and headed for Christiansburg and an unplanned zero day. We might be without our van for some time, as it’s possible that the hub thingee is on international back order. Welcome to vanlife.
And Now for the Rest of the Story
We settled into a motel, took a shower, and did our best to eat all the perishibles in the van’s mini fridge before leaving it at the dealer tomorrow. Thinking about what to eat next, I scratched my scalp, and felt a little lump. A little moving lump. A tick. Gross. Then, just after falling asleep, I felt something crawling on my leg. Another tick. What the what?
I looked at Gus. He was busy scratching and biting his fur. He’d picked up some passengers on his walk from US11 to VA610. So, we have another task for our unplanned zero day: finding a groomer and getting the dog shaved. He’s got great hair, but it’s a perfect place for ticks to hide, even though his tick treatment seems to be working. The AT has not been kind to our dogs.
Notes:  I did not see Ms. Squawk and her little dog today, leaving my agenda item unchecked. Also, I hiked past the “¼ GA-ME” marker. Hard to believe I’ve come that far already.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664420,"But First, Day 44
Day 44 was our unscheduled zero. We took the van to the dealership in Christiansburg, emptied it out, loaded the rental, and found a motel back near the trail. Northstar misses her van. I miss the convenience of camping at trailheads and having everything in one place. But sometimes you have to play the hand you’re dealt, not the one you wish you had.
Our New Routine
Northstar is not an early riser by nature. By marriage, she will. When we camp at trailheads, I leave early, and she sleeps in. Now, since we live in motels, she has to get up with the sun and drive me out to the trail. Also, because she banished Gus from the tick-infested trail until he’s been shaved, she has to entertain him all day. And Gus has needs.
My routine hasn’t changed much. I eat, hike, eat, and sleep.
Northstar’s routine: She drives to trail, drives back from trail, walks the dog, plays fetch, drives to trail, drives back from trail, and sleeps. I think I’m going to owe her big time. More than I already do, that is.
Meadows
Virginia’s Appalachian Mountains feature long parallel mountain ridges separated by deep linear valleys littered by small farms carved out of the forests that blanket the entire region. Small rivers and creeks flow along the valley bottoms, completing the bucolic scene.
Homesteaders probably cleared the woods hundreds of years ago, creating green hilly meadows draped over the foothills of the bigger, still-forested peaks. Many of the meadows are still farmed, with border fences crossed by tall stiles where the trail leaves the pastures for the woods. In some of the fields, outposts of trees hint that the brooding forests are waiting to take it all back.
Somehow, walking through these pastures gives me more of sense of being on a journey. I’m no longer alone in a vast, uniform, deep woods with a few hikers. Seeing farms, tiny villages, windy country roads, and people makes me feel like I’m going somewhere. I’m walking across America.
Meadow Memories
I walked and played in fields like this as a child, though mine had no well-worn paths. On mornings like this, I walked through the dew-drenched long grass, soaking my socks and sneakers, and sometimes, the bottoms of my shorts. The grasses tickled my bare legs, making me stop and scratch.
These fields were Saturdays. They were summer vacation. I’d wake up, eat breakfast, and then escape out the backdoor across the pastures with a lunch packed in a brown paper bag. I’d be gone all day, exploring wherever whim took me. These fields were freedom and adventure. They still are.
My soul lives in the woods, but my spirit soars free in the meadows.
Woods
The AT inevitably leaves the meadows for the woods, just as I did as a boy. This morning, as I left the meadow’s wet grasses for the damp woods, my childhood memories came with me. I remember these woods, even though I’ve never been here before. I remember seeing them with a boy’s eyes.
To 10-year-old me, everything in the woods was an adventure. Trees existed to be climbed. Fallen trees were a lodgepole for a new fort, roofed and walled with rotting sticks and leaves, and always better built in my mind than in reality. I built hundreds of them and stocked them all with pinecones and acorns to throw at my enemies. But I never fought a single battle from any of them. And I certainly never spent the night in one of my leaky, bug-filled creations.
Still-standing dead trees were meant to be pushed over. I called them “Ely Trees,” after a friend of my father’s who taught me the art of toppling them over without getting crushed. Today, campers call them “widow-makers.” Ah, the dangers we survived as free-range children.
This morning, the woods were silent except for my leaf-muffled foot falls and a cacophony of bird calls. Does that count as silence? I think so. It’s certainly not noise.
Is this why I wanted to hike the AT? To reconnect with the woods of my childhood?
Today’s Highlights
I hit a rabbit on the drive out to Old Rich Valley Road. Northstar was appalled. On her drive back, she stopped at the murder scene, took crime scene pictures, and texted them to me along with a few snaps of the victim’s lonely mate. And of the crows waiting for her to leave the scene. I’m not quite sure what to make of all that, but I’m reminded of a scene in “Fatal Attraction.”The Forest Service desperately wanted me to know that Lick Creek Bridge was out, posting dozens of warnings about water safety, drowning hazards, and the like. Lick Creek was three inches deep. I survived without incident.After a week of small hills, the trail threw 5,200 feet of total elevation gain at me, with the largest single climb at 2,100 feet. But the view from the top at Chestnut Knob Shelter made it worth the effort.The last six miles of the trail were rocky, rough, uneven, hard to follow, and overgrown. At the end of the day, I stumbled into VA 623 completely spent. I tripped and stubbed my toes more during those miles than I had in the last week.Miraculously, Superman was offering trail magic at the obscure VA 623 crossing. We’d stopped at Superman’s trail magic at Dennis Cove Road a few days before getting to Damascus. Today, he was giving away his leftovers on his way home to New Orleans. Even better, he had ice cold La Croix. Exactly what I craved.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664502,"Sweet Feet
I passed the 566-mile mark yesterday. That means it’s been 400 miles since I broke out a new pair of shoes. So, today I pulled on a brand-new pair of the exact same shoes. Such sweet relief.
If you’re planning an AT thru hike and can only do one thing to prepare, make sure to figure out your footwear before you leave home. I’m happy with my Altra Olympus V’s, but I know that anything over 400 miles out of them is a bonus.
Same ‘Ol Same ‘Ol
The trail immediately put my new kicks to the test, starting out just as rocky as what I’d hiked yesterday afternoon. But I hardly noticed until I found myself looking at the scenery. Then I realized the trail had improved enough that I didn’t have to stare at my feet to avoid tripping or turning an ankle.
From then on, I walked through the long green tunnel, sometimes on abandoned wagon roads (love ‘em) and sometimes on newer single track (love ‘em less). The woods were quiet and lonely, as usual, leaving me plenty of time to think. Today, mileage occupied my mind.
Mileage Math
It felt right not doing a 20-miler today. I done my share of them and have survived, but they take a toll on my old joints and ligaments. At this point, sixteen to eighteen miles is more in my strike zone. And if I manage to do six 16-milers a week, I’ll get to Katahdin by the end of September, including my upcoming trips to San Diego and Alaska. That’s exactly when I want to finish.
I Could Get Used to This
I stopped for lunch at the scenic Laurel Creek Bridge. I had the usual: tortilla, cheese, chicken, with some raisins and an orange. Yum. Nothing fancy, but enough to power me through the afternoon. I ate quickly, packed up, and started the climb out of the river valley.
Fifty yards later, I saw a large tent through the trees and smelled hamburgers grilling. Some Christian missionaries called out to ask if I was hungry and thirsty. Sadly, I told them I’d just eaten and hiked on.
Not really. I pulled in, sat down, and wolfed down a cheeseburger, a hot dog, some chips, and another Gatorade. Second lunch. A new tradition was born, as long as the magicians keep showing up at the mid-day road crossings.
In retrospect, second lunch might not be the best idea right before a big climb.
Topper
At first lunch I chatted briefly with a section hiker I’d met yesterday at the Chestnut Knob Shelter. I mentioned that I don’t normally see hikers on the trail in the morning because I usually start at 7:00 or 7:30 am.  He responded that he’d started hiking at 4:30 this morning. (Ok…in the dark? And you only did 7 miles since then…in 7 hours?)
Then he mentioned he’d seen a bear yesterday afternoon. After listening to his story, and teasing out the details (it was black and it ran away), I told him that I’d seen three bears so far, and started to tell him my bear cub story, but only got half a sentence out before he interrupted to tell me that he’d seen six since Springer. (Ok, but didn’t you say you’re doing a one-week section hike?)
And so it went for the entire conversation. I've been calling him “Topper” in my notes.
Switchbacks
The climb up from Laurel Creek Gap had an insane number of switchbacks. I’m not complaining, mind you, but it was only a 500-foot climb. But they should post a sign or something, since one of us might be recording the Topper story on video and not notice how the close switchbacks take you to within earshot of trailing hikers.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664539,"Don’t Overlook the Obvious
Every once in a while, it hits me like a thunderbolt. Somebody made a path that goes all the way from Georgia to Maine. Through the woods in the middle of nowhere. Through towns and cities. Over and along rivers. Over mountains. Mostly over mountains. And people come out and volunteer to build it, repair it, and improve it. And anyone can just go out and walk it anytime they feel like it. It’s truly amazing.
Nothing Special
Notwithstanding all that, today’s walk was nothing special. There were no big climbs, no spectacular ridge walks with forever views, no awesome rivers, no wildlife, no trail magic, no reunions with friends, no new friends, and no cultural sites.
It was just another day in the woods. Which is way better than a day in the office. Say what you will about the long, green tunnel, but it sure beats working.
Getting Schooled
I had the trail to myself most of the day, although I passed Colin Farrell (not his real name, but he looks like him) and his dog Wade Wilson (his real name and he doesn’t), who I’d met at Superman’s trail magic a few days back. Colin Farrell is a professional thru-hiker. Not in the paid sense, but in the full-time sense.
So, I don’t think he appreciated getting passed on the climb out of Bland. But he was carrying a full pack and wrangling a dog, and I’m just a slack-packer. A white-haired, elderly, slack-packer. Then again, I’ve got long legs and a nasty competitive streak. I knew he’d reel me in eventually, but it was fun to hold him off for a few hours, like those unknown Tour de France riders who make a hopeless, too-early break against the seasoned pros.
I heard him behind me a couple of times, but he never closed until I stopped to make a little video at the 600-mile mark. He and Wade zoomed past, and I think I saw a little respect in his eyes when he said we’d probably leapfrog the rest of the day. We didn’t. He was gone and I’d already burned my extra fuel.
600 Miles
And that was about it for the day’s fun. Except for that 600-mile mark. I love clicking off the mileage milestones, though 600 doesn’t have the panache of 500. And I’ve got something special planned for 700.
Why Walk When You Can Swim?
My day ended at Kimberling Creek, crossing the historical suspension foot bridge. Gus wasn’t too sure about the bouncy, swinging bridge when he showed up to pick me up. He preferred to swim the somewhat smelly river and then roll in the riverbank mud. The latter earned him a toss back in the river for rinse before toweling him off and locking him in the rental car.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664631,"Dismal
The AT follows Dismal Creek for nine miles after crossing VA 606 at Kimberling Creek. Dismal? More like delightful. When I started at 7:15 am, I could see my breath. The woods, still wet from last night’s rain showers, dripped, and dampened the morning sounds, creating perfect hiking conditions.
The trailed followed, crossed, and re-crossed the creek dozens of times on little wood footbridges, sawn half-logs, or steppingstones. When the valley’s vegetation thickened enough to keep me from seeing the creek, I could still hear it, especially near the mis-named Dismal Falls, a wonderful ledged cascade that plunges into a swimmable pool. What a lovely walk.
Spooky
As always, I hiked alone for the first few hours. The trail may not have been dismal, but the weather was – overcast, windy, and threatening more rain. Alone in the deep, quiet, chilly woods with a storm coming. The perfect setting for a mystery.
On quiet mornings, the woodpeckers make a knocking sound that is eerily reminiscent of the gurgling velociraptor sound in the Jurassic Park movies. Every time I hear them, I peer into the brush expecting to see a pack of them hunting me.
When I left for the AT, my daughter warned me to look out for “skin walkers,” which in the southern Appalachians are called “Cryptids.” She generally keeps me informed about such things, like zombies and other weird ways to die in the wilderness.
Specifically, she told me that Appalachian cryptids lure their victims by imitating a baby’s cry, so if I hear it, DON’T GO LOOKING FOR IT. According to the legends, she said, “if you went toward it you have a mark on your back because they know you can hear it.” I remain skeptical.
But this morning, I heard a baby crying in the woods. Some might question whether the wind creaking the dead trees made the sound, but after I heard it, my hair stood on end for a full minute. That might be explained by my not washing my hair for a week, but that’s when I saw a man standing in the trail who completely disappeared a second later.
When I walked up to where he’d disappeared, I saw the sign to the Wapiti Shelter. That’s right, the place where two hikers were brutally murdered in 1981. So, I did what any sane hiker would do. I took a break, had a snack, checked my email, and looked up the murder account. Wapiti Shelter has pretty good cell reception.
Mind-Blowing
Yesterday afternoon, when Northstar picked me up, we decided to check in with the Van dealership to see if they’d made any progress figuring out the ignition issue. Recall that two mornings in a row, Northstar couldn’t get the van to start. After the second time, she went to a dealership who did some sort of scan that indicated a manufacturer’s defect in the “radio frequency hub module” which lets the key fob talk to the ignition.
We called at 4:15 on the Friday before Memorial Day Weekend. They’d had the van since Tuesday morning. Have you ever had your car serviced? Then you know what’s coming.
They had not even looked at it. And they had lost the paperwork describing the problem. They thought they’d get a chance next Tuesday, after the long weekend. The service manager must have sensed our displeasure because she called back 15 minutes later and said that it had started just fine. In fact, she said, the mechanics had been able to start it every day without any problems. (But hadn’t they lost the paperwork explaining what the problem was?)
Catch 22, Anyone?
And since it started, there would be no error code in their diagnostic program, so they couldn’t do a warrantee repair. And no, they couldn’t use the error code found by the other dealership (who wasn’t authorized to do factory defect repairs).  So, we could leave it all weekend and they could try again on Tuesday, or we could come pick it up today before they closed at 6:00 pm.
I explained our situation, how Northstar is often waiting in remote places without cell coverage, and that our hike depended on having the van, but she wouldn’t offer any options or advice. She had clearly checked out for the long weekend.
Northstar called our dealer back home, who outlined how badly this dealership was performing on what was a very straightforward repair, and advised us to take it somewhere else. Plus, he said, the starting problem needs to go through a “drive cycle” to be diagnosed because starting it successfully resets the error codes. Leaving it at the dealership without driving it would be pointless.
The Good News
The good news is that we have the van back, and that it will eventually start, even if we have to sit and wait an hour or so. Once that happens, we can take it somewhere, get a new diagnostic scan, and start the process over again. In the meantime, Northstar has brushed up on her Garmin Inreach skills, pumped up her bike tires, and vowed to only park where she has solid cell service.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664690,"Leaves of Three
I get a little wigged out by poison ivy. I believe I’ve mentioned that once or thrice. I’ve gotten better at identifying it, but early on, any time I saw “leaves of three” I’d go on high alert. But lots of plants grow their leaves in thrupples, so I spent a lot of time in high alert status.
Brambles
Brambles often present with leaf triplets, so they were one of the first plants I learned to identify along the AT in Georgia. I’d understood “brambles” as a synonym for what I grew up calling “pricker bushes,” but I accepted the name given them by my plant identification app. Brambles do have prickers, as Gus and I learned after bushwacking back to the trail on one of North Carolina’s Balds.
My mother, a botanist, taught me that pricker bushes were part of God’s “curse” on humanity after Adam and Eve were banished from Eden (Gen 3:18). Mom also made some pretty awesome blackberry jam. How do those two sentences fit together?
Blackberries
Yesterday, I posted a picture on Facebook of some glorious white blossoms in a bramble patch on the ridge above Pearisburg. Greta Cloutier, who Northstar believes to be the smartest student she ever taught, commented: “Blackberries?” I replied, “No, they’re brambles.” But then because it was Greta, I thought I’d better check, and sure enough, brambles are blackberries. Southerners see brambles. New Englanders see blackberries.
Not only do those nasty thornbushes I’ve been seeing along the trail have wonderful flower blossoms, they produce a delicious fruit I spent hundreds of hours gathering as a child. How did I not know this? I guess I sometimes see only what I’ve been conditioned to see.
Power Line Scars
The particular bramble/blackberry blossom patch I’d photographed yesterday grew inside a power line corridor. Wherever power lines cross the mountain, the utility companies cut all the trees within the right-of-way, leaving a huge scar that transects the forests as far as the eye can see. But those corridors not only provide some of the best (and only) views along parts of the AT, they are home to gardens of brambles and other flowering shrubs.
What’s Bothering the Incident?
A week ago, I posted that something was bothering me that affected by hike, but I wasn’t ready to talk about it. I still don’t think I can articulate it without being misunderstood or without risking offending some readers. Suffice to say that some aspects of thru hiking culture weigh heavily on me, but I think I’ve worked through it.
How? Partly by staying out of the (metaphorical) bramble patches and power line corridors. And when I find myself surrounded by irritating brambles, I try to look for the blossoms that will someday become berries. And when I cross the power line scars, I seek to look past the ugly steel towers and buzzing cancer-causing cables and just enjoy the view.
The other thing I needed to learn was to hike my own hike. That doesn’t just mean experiencing the kind of hike I expected to have before I left home. It means accepting and enjoying the hike I’m presented with on daily basis. Sometimes, it means ignoring the nastiest brambles, and intentionally seeking out more satisfying aspects of the trail. Mostly, it means not dwelling on what hasn’t gone well. Just hike on and leave that all behind.
It’s a daily effort, but it seems to be working. I'm happy.
Oh Yeah, I Also Hiked Today
I hiked alone, as usual. Gus was getting shaved, and everyone else was still asleep when I set out. The AT rained on me all afternoon, but the rhododendron-mountain laurel-flame azalea tunnels on the ridge above Pearisburg were spectacular. I put a long video of one delightful corridor on my Facebook page. I also saw some new wildflowers – Purple Skullcaps, Smooth Phlox, Pilosella Caespitosa, and Japanese Honeysuckle (probably an invasive, but still pretty).
Plus, I visited a convenience store that sold chips, beer, candy, soda, and a rack of automatic weapons. How awesome is that?

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664740,"Rain, Rain, Go Away
It rained all night. No problem.
It rained when I ate breakfast and packed up. No problem.
It was still raining when I started hiking. Now that’s a problem.
Yeah, yeah, I know. No rain, no pain, no Maine. I know I’ll get my share of rainy days, but nothing says I have to like them.
Jacket or No Jacket
I have a little routine I go through when it starts to rain on me while hiking. For light rain, I just get wet, figuring my body heat will keep me dry. For heavy rain, especially if it’s cold, I’ll pull out my rain gear. If it’s warm enough, I’ll let the rain give me a shower no matter how hard it pours.
When squalls of varying intensity roll though, bringing surges of wind and cold air, I get frustrated, taking my pack on and off to get out and stow my rain gear. Guess which kind of rain I had today.
I started out in a light rain without a rain jacket because I had a 1,200-foot climb that I knew would get me overheated. But then the rain’s intensity picked up, so I added my rain hat. Then I took off my long sleeve shirt and put on my rain jacket, but left it unzipped because I was already sweating.
Jacket or No Jacket, Doesn’t Matter
By the time I finished the climb, my upper body and head were soaked from sweat and rain. My feet and lower body were soaked partly from the rain, but mostly from the long, wet grass and the brush along the overgrown trail.
Hiking Wet
I’ve hiked wet before. It’s unpleasant, because there’s no dry place to sit and take a break, and because I had to stow my phone, which meant no music, audiobooks, or peeking at the map to see what’s coming. I was alone with my thoughts and the wet, dripping woods.
The rain also made a difficult section of trail much worse. Poor drainage turned the trail into a long pond in flat sections and a flowing stream wherever it was sloped. Rain weighed down the trees, making them hang low over the trail and making me duck and dodge to avoid getting a face-full of wet leaves. The low clouds, rain, and mist also blocked any views that might have been along the ridge.
The rocks and roots got slipperier too. I caught myself dozens of times, but had my first fall when I stepped on a sloped slab of rock and both feet went right out from under me. I landed well, catching myself in a pushup position, but my face and hands were buried in the trailside brush. Being me, my first thought was “Poison Ivy!,” but it was just brambles.
After an hour, I was drenched. My pants and shirt clung to my skin. Water squished out of my socks and shoes with every step. I’d given up trying to avoid the long puddles since my feet couldn’t get any wetter.
It Could Be Worse
And then it got cold.
I was chilled enough to start thinking about hypothermia. I wasn’t there yet, but I could see it in the distance. My kit includes an emergency kit for hypothermia, but I’d need to find or make a shelter for it to be effective. So, I kept an eye on it and kept walking and eating to generate heat.
Things You See in the Rain
By noon, I’d passed at least ten tents still set up while their occupants waited out the rain. Same for the shelters.
Of course, since my phone was stowed inside my pack, I saw tons of cool fungi, and a zoo-full of animals. I logged my first orange speckled salamanders, a half-dozen toads, one mole (drowned, on the trail), a box turtle, enough snails to feed a hungry Frenchman, and four deer. I tried out my “Stop!” command on the last deer, and sure enough, it worked again. After I finish thru-hiking, I’m going to rent myself out to hunters.
The rain slowed to a drizzle by noon, although the trees kept dripping and the overhanging brush was still wet until I entered a more open part of the woods that had been better maintained. Just then, Colin Farrell hiked toward me with a crew of seven slack packers, one of whom was Birdsong whom we’d driven into Marion for a resupply a week earlier.
They must have had a better weather report than I, and had waited until 11:30 to be dropped off for a southbound hike back to Pearisburg, just about the time the rain started to let up. None of them were even wearing rain gear, and they looked at me astonished and baffled about how I’d gotten so wet. They weren’t getting rained on, but they were about to enter the splash zone of wet grass and dripping, overhanging vegetation. They’d be soaked in an hour.
Hikers Hike
We stopped and chatted about the forecast, noting the number of tents we’d seen with people sitting out the weather. When someone asked why we were out here, one of the guys shrugged and said, “Hikers hike.”
It was a hard day. The trail was rocky, overgrown, and not well maintained. It was wet and cold. There were no views at the top of the steep climbs. But hikers hike. And that’s the only way to get to Maine.

In Arizona we celebrate the rain. It’s an event. Parents will call their children outside to look at it. People take pictures of it and post them online. People have no idea how to drive in it, and it brings traffic to a standstill, but we sure appreciate it. But only because it rarely rains twice in a month.
I’m starting to get the feeling that rain is a little less special along the AT. And this has been a dry year, according to the locals.
Doh!
Today’s forecast called for 0.1 inch of rain, the same as yesterday and equally as wrong. The rain began right as I started hiking, just like yesterday. I already had my rain jacket on but had skipped my rain hat this morning, so I put my hood up and started climbing. And bonked my head on tree trunks leaning low over the trail. Twice. I may have mentioned something nasty about trail maintenance. More than twice.
If hate something worse than bumping my head, I can’t recall what that might be at the moment. If I go to hell, I know it will have plenty of low ceilings, open cupboard doors, and tree branches over trails. Someday, someone will invent a hood that doesn’t hang too low over my face and obscure my peripheral vision, but that day has not yet come.
Maybe that same person will invent a rain jacket that actually keeps the rain out AND is breathable enough so that you don’t get twice as wet from sweat as you would have from the rain. Mine does the former, but not the latter, so it was off and stowed in my backpack after five minutes of climbing. If I’m gonna be wet, I might as well hang on to my electrolytes.
A Moto-Mystery
The 1,300-foot climb up from Big Stony Creek was steep but manageable, but the ridge walk from there to Mountain Lake Road was rocky, steppy, muddy, rugged, narrow, and overgrown. I spent most of the four miles carefully watching my feet to avoid tripping or slipping on wet rocks and roots.
In the middle of all that, I rounded a bend and saw brand new motocross style motorcycle lying on its side across the trail. I’d seen a set of very recent tire tracks heading south during my climb. I couldn’t imagine trying to ride this section. I could barely walk it without falling. And I had trekking poles to save me.
I didn’t see any evidence of a crash. The bike had no dents or scrapes. The tires were inflated. I saw no blood or skin. The rider had left their helmet strapped to the handlebar and, of course, a pile of trash. Typical motorhead. They’d also left skid marks, crushed vegetation, and gouges from spinning out all along the trail to the Mountain Lake Road crossing where they’d gotten on the AT.
I posted a picture of it on the Facebook AT 2023 page. Theories ranged from a stolen joy ride to poor souls forced to ride the AT due to some emergency. And someone who felt I needed to know that section of trail wouldn’t be hard to ride. Hmm, that fact that the bike was abandoned might be evidence that it was, not to mention the difficulty I had walking it. You gotta love the comments section on public Facebook posts.
Supersoaker
I crossed paths with Supersoaker (he carries no stove) shortly after that and we puzzled through the motorcycle mystery while we walked. We parted company after we stopped for lunch at the War Spur Shelter, just before the last climb of the day, a 1,700-foot (650 ft/mi) ascent that looked like a beast on the map but actually wasn’t that tough.
Unexpected Magic
Trail magic helped soften the climb. At the two-thirds point, a guy parked along VA 601, a gravel road in the middle of nowhere, had a cooler of ice-cold Yuenglings and Cokes, with boxes of chips and candy bars. He looked kind of lonely, so I took pity on him and broke my rule of never stopping during a climb. I can be nice that way.
I forgot to ask his name, but we’ll call him Overalls. Overalls told me about bird rescue, migratory raptor counts, and tick prevention, and I helped him with his inventory. As he spoke, he’d get a slightly distant look whenever we heard a bird. I asked, and he said he’d counted 28 species by ear while he’d parked there. Impressive.
Handmade
I’d seen only Supersoaker during my hike today, so I asked Overalls if he’d been busy. He said that seven hikers had just left before I arrived, but that no one had mentioned the abandoned motorcycle. He also told me he’d seen “Handmade” a few days ago.
Handmade built his own wood-(and deer antler) framed backpack and carried wooden trekking poles. He had also hiked barefoot from Springer, averaging 12 miles a day. I’m looking forward to catching that guy to see for myself.
More Rain?
Supersoaker arrived just then to take the next shift at the trail magic, so I moved on and finished the climb, scurrying to finish before the rain kicked in again. The last two miles passed through some lovely meadows and farms, though I paid for the views with some heavy rain squalls that soaked me down to my toes.
I’ll try to remember the feeling next time I’m getting baked by the scorching sun.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664838,"The Return of Gus
Gus is back on the trail. His hair is short enough to let us find ticks and the forecast called for no rain. Despite the lack of sky juice, the woods provided plenty of tree juice and the meadows chipped in buckets of grass juice, so we both got pretty wet in the morning. We’d mostly dried out by late afternoon though.
The Debut of Northstar
Even better, Northstar was on the trail today too! She finally felt well enough to walk a bit, so we met up at VA 630 and walked to the Keffer Oak together. The Keffer Oak is reputed to be the largest oak along the AT in the south and may be 300 years old. I agree, all those qualifiers take away some of the potential “wow,” but it was definitely a big tree.
My dad always referred to big trees as “huggin’ and chalkin’” trees because you’d need two pieces of chalk and long arms to hug your way around it when measuring the circumference. He’d describe certain large women using the same phrase, but those were different times.
I enjoyed walking with Northstar far more than seeing the big oak. She sees so many things I walk right past and sees them with a poet’s eye. The plant ID app was busy trying to keep up with all the mosses, lichens, and tiny flowers she noticed. My favorite was called Fan Clubmoss. Not Fanclub Moss or Fan Club Moss. After the Keffer Oak, I hiked on with Gus, planning to meet up with Northstar at Trout Creek in the afternoon.
A Little Bit of Everything
Today’s hike was a nice mix of meadows, woods, climbs, creeks, and ridges. I met Jellybean, a YouTube vlogger, at the top of the first big climb. We’d both stopped to look at the view, a rarity after three straight days of being socked in with clouds and rain. I’d met her briefly on the long climb out of 19E back in North Tennolina, and know a lot of the same hikers, but had never really spoken.
After that, I walked six miles along the spine of Bruiser Knob Ridge, the highlight of which is a mile-long section with dozens of weird, six-foot high rock cairns. The FarOut app says they were built by farmers a hundred years ago, but no one knows why. The lowlight of the ridge walk was climbing over miles of sloped, exposed, slippery bedrock. Gus had no problems, but my knees and feet were throbbing by the time I reached the descent off the ridge.
Fords and Climbs
Gus and I stopped for lunch after fording the mighty Craig Creek, another stream with a washed-out bridge the Forest Service had posted warnings about. I crossed at a riffle and got one foot a little wet, though the meadow grasses did a more effective job earlier in the day. Gus jumped in and swam across, and then insisted on a game of stick-fetch-and-shake-off right next to me as I ate lunch.
In southern Virginia, anytime you find yourself at a paved road crossing or a sizable stream, you can be certain there’s another steep climb in your future. Sure enough, the AT crossed to the next ridge, which required a 1,700-foot climb up Brush Mountain.
As I slogged up the steep trail, I realized my climbing has changed over the last two months. Unlike the climbs back in Georgia, I now spend less time thinking about the distance to the top, false summits, and where I’m going. I just walk. I’m also getting better at estimating how far I’ve gone without looking at the map. I just go into my head and grind it out.
Memories
Brush Mountain is also the location of the Audie Murphy Memorial. Murphy, one of the most decorated soldiers in World War II, died in a plane crash nearby. Someone had decorated the blue-blaze path to the monument with American Flags, as yesterday was Memorial Day.
A group of hikers were just packing up as I approached the side trail to the monument, and I was surprised to see Wheels and Shamrock in the group. Jellybean tracks Shamrock on the FarOut app, and had told me that they were 20 miles ahead with plans to be in Roanoke in two days. But they’d taken a zero in Blacksburg and slowed down a little when Shamrock’s son joined for a section.
We had a nice reunion before they hiked off while I visited Murphy’s shrine. When I left a few minutes later, I found Wheels’ croc (shoe) lying on the trail, so I hurried ahead to catch them. I caught Shamrock and one of their new friends, Navigator, and had a nice chat with them. But Wheels earns her name. I didn’t catch her until she stopped for trail magic at Trout Creek.
Taking a Break
Northstar was waiting for me at Trout Creek. She’d booked a stay in Roanoke for our 40th anniversary tomorrow, when we’ll take a zero. I’ve logged 141 miles and about 30,000 feet of climbing over the last eight days. I need a day off.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664906,"I Do
Forty years ago today, a very pretty, very young woman walked down the aisle at the Calvin Seminary Chapel and stood next to a very lucky young man and said “I do.” Unlike a lot of young grooms, I wasn’t the slightest bit nervous or scared. For once in my life, I knew I was getting exactly what I wanted and that it was absolutely the right thing.
And I’m more sure of it today than I was then. She was then, and still is, my North Star.
Her Too
Forty years is a long time. Six months on the AT seems long too, but will be gone in an eye-blink, just like 40 years has. But in fact, our six months hiking the AT will be a little more than one percent of the time we’ve been married. What a huge gift Northstar gave me when she agreed to support this little adventure.
A Roanoke Zero
We spent our zero day doing whatever Northstar wanted, which fortunately didn’t involve walking anywhere in the rain. Resting played a big role, as did eating food that others cooked, served, and cleaned up after.
We’ll be back on the trail to start on the Virginia Triple Crown tomorrow. And I’ve got something special planned for the 700-mile mark.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664949,"The Late Bird Gets the Heat
Northstar found us such a nice AirBnB in Roanoke neither of us felt like getting up early to get back to the trail. So we didn’t. Well, I did. I always get up early, but Northstar likes to sleep late. I only planned on 13.8 miles of hiking, so we had no need for an early start.
But a stop at Krogers and Starbucks, as well as a 40-minute drive back to Trout Creek, put us at the trailhead at 10:00 am. That’s late for me, though not so late for a lot of thru hikers, especially the younger ones, a few of whom I passed still sitting around at the shelter I passed.
Gus got to hike again today. He excitedly ran circles inside the van, crying pathetically before I finally let him out. He went straight for Trout Creek and dove in. Smart dog. I wish I had. It was the hottest day yet on the trail.
The Triple Crown
Today’s hike started me on Virginia’s Triple Crown, which consists of the Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee’s Knob, and Tinker Cliffs. Other than the fact that there are three of them, I have no idea why it’s called the triple crown. There’s no race, fastest known time, or any other competition that I know of.
I passed the Dragon’s Tooth today. McAfee and Tinker come tomorrow.
The Dragon’s Tooth
The climb up to the Dragon’s Tooth was only about 1,100 feet, but it kicked my butt. The elevation gain was no problem, but the trail was steep, rocky, and required hands and feet for at least a mile on either side of the Tooth. That kind of hiking wears me out.
The Tooth itself was a 20-foot-high bedrock spire at the end of the ridge and looked enough like a dragon’s tooth to earn its name. And heck yes, I climbed it. Gus couldn’t make the required chimney move to reach the top, and ran around looking for another way up, whining so much I came right back down before someone reported me to the SPCA.
700 Miles
I passed the 700-mile mark on the climb up to the Dragon’s Tooth. I’d been anticipating this milestone, math nerd that I am, and came prepared.
700 is One-Pith of the AT
The AT is 2,198.4 miles long. If you divide it’s length by Pi (π), which has a value of 3.1416, you get 700. And because I like pie (and pi), I packed an apple pi(e) in, intending to eat it all to celebrate the occasion. I got about a quarter of the way through the pie and realized this might not be my best idea.
Gus initially offered to help, but declined the taste I offered him. Just then, Thorn hiked up. We’d never met before, so she politely declined my offer to share. But I could see that the math nerd in her was intrigued. And she just happened to have fork and plate handy that came out nearly as fast as her initial polite refusal.
Thorn’s Norwegian friend Viking showed up next. He took no convincing at all, though I’m not sure he crossed the language barrier enough to get the pi/pie thing. But he did get the pie part of it. As a side note, Viking had Tolkien’s “One Ring” poem tattooed (in Elvish script) on his chest. But he wore no ring, which explained why I could still see him (his joke).
Seeing Thorn and Viking dig in convinced Gus that he was missing out, so he finally went to work on the little piece I had put down for him and then sniffed around for more.
In retrospect, sharing a pi(e) between three of us fits better than wolfing one down by myself, because the inverse of Pi is 1/3. Or close enough. Plus, eating a whole pie is gross. After downing my share, I walked with a belly tart the rest of the day and rode a sugar high for two hours before brutally crashing in the last few miles. If I’d eaten the whole thing, I’d surely have left most of it somewhere in the bushes along the trail.
What Happened to Spring?
Three days ago, I was on the edge of hypothermia. Today, I was looking for creek deep enough for a swim. It hit the mid-80’s in the sun by early afternoon, making me happy about the long green tunnel’s cool shade. The heat did not help me digest that pie.
And Tentman, you were right. I miss the cold.
Falling Down
I had my first fall earlier in the week, after 600+ miles. Today, I fell twice. The first was a simple slip. My foot got a little muddy just before I had to traverse a tricky spot with a sloped rock. It was a soft fall onto my most padded equipment.
The second fall was a one-in-a-million shot. I somehow caught my left foot on a root that had a little protruding, downward pointing knob that slipped through (or made) a little tear in my shoe’s upper fabric. It stopped me cold like I’d caught my foot in a bear trap. I caught myself with my poles, but couldn’t quite balance with my foot twisted up behind me, and slowly toppled on my side into the brush.
I’d just passed two younger hikers who immediately rushed up to help the old man who’d obviously had a heart attack. I just lay there laughing, trying to explain what happened. They helped me get up, looking at me like I should be in rocking chair somewhere. So, I said thanks and then crushed them on the next climb.
Odds & Ends
I got a text from my brother saying he’s in Richmond visiting his youngest son and might be able to meet up on Sunday somewhere along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Small world.I asked Alaska to release me from this summer’s field work so I can keep walking without a two-week break. The logistics of leaving for that long were getting really complicated for Northstar and making me worry that I wouldn’t be able to finish on Katahdin. Plus, I’m worried about getting injured up there and ruining my hike. Fingers crossed that it works out.I’m starting to feel my left knee a bit and my Achilles are pretty tight by the end of the day. They’re not quite painful but are definitely letting me know they’re there. I need to stretch regularly.The woods smelled like summer today. As I walked, I tried to think of how to describe that smell. Then I realized it was cow manure. Perhaps that’s the less glorious part of my childhood woods and meadows memories.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665026,"Boondocking
We boondocked at the VA 311 trailhead parking area, a popular starting point for locals wanting to hike to McAfee’s Knob. When it comes to parking the van, we’ve adopted the policy that if we don’t see any signs say we can’t park overnight, we assume that we can. So far, that’s worked for us, and we haven’t gotten the midnight knock that Vanlifers dread.
I’d thought about getting up early and trying to catch sunrise at McAfee’s Knob, but frankly, I was too tired to get up that early after a late bedtime. But I might have been the only one. The parking lot was jammed when I started at 6:30 am, after having been only half-full last night. Someone told me at least 50 people waited in line to take their McAfee Knob ledge picture at dawn.
I saw at least that many tents near the summit and as many hikers coming down during my hike up. I also saw a jog-stroller parked outside a tent. I guess you’re never too young to start a thru-hike.
McAfee’s Knob
Except for climbing on the Katahdin Summit sign with your trekking poles held triumphantly over your head, a profile shot on the potato chip ledge at McAfee’s Knob may be the most iconic photograph on the entire AT. I’ve been waiting 20 years to stand on that ledge. I wasn’t sure I’d ever get the chance.
I almost walked right past the turnoff. A nondescript blue blaze marker points the way through the dense, chest-high brush off the main trail near the summit. I guess I’d expected a more well-worn trail and a little more fanfare. Or a crowd. But I got none of that. Despite the sunrise crowd I’d heard about, I had the ledge pretty much to myself. I actually had to wait for a day hiker to show up to take my picture.
I almost got a little emotional standing on the cliff, under a crystal blue sky with a nice breeze in my face. What a great setting and view. What a perfect day. But it could have been overcast and raining. Something about putting your toes on the edge of McAfee’s Knob makes you feel like a thru hiker. Like you just might make it to Katahdin. Like you belong on this trail.
Hiking to Tinker Cliffs
Just after leaving McAfee’ Knob, I saw bear #4, a small one. He was big enough to be on his own, but small enough to evoke thoughts of cuddling him, rather than being eaten by him. He ran off too quickly for a picture, and then did the same thing again a few minutes later down the trail. McAfee’s Knob and a bear. Could this day get any better?
I got passed by a day hiker between bear sightings. I don’t get passed often, so I thought about trying to keep up with him, but he was 40 years younger, had long legs, no pack, and was built like an ultra-marathoner. I had no chance. As he disappeared down the hill, in the distance up ahead I saw the hiker who had tried to catch me on the last climb of the day yesterday.
The guy looked back at me, and I thought I saw a flash of recognition before he took off with a determined stride. Today’s hike was 20 miles, so I had no capacity to race, but I do have that competitive streak. He disappeared quickly, but I saw him whenever we hit a straight stretch with decent visibility. Every time, he’d look over his shoulder, see me, and accelerate.
Eventually, I caught him as we started to climb towards Tinker Cliffs. He was leaning over his poles, breathing hard, and smiling sheepishly as I walked past and said, “You’re a speedy hiker, my friend. See you on the next descent.” But I never saw him again.
Tinker Cliffs
Tinker Cliffs get none of the fanfare given to McAfee’s Knob, but I thought the views were better, with more space to spread out and find a quiet spot all to yourself. I found a good one and sat down with my feet over the edge and my back leaning against a rock and had an early lunch. I young hiker stopped by, pointed out a serviceberry bush next to me, and offered me one. We had it cleaned of ripe berries in minutes.
When I got up to leave, I met another thru-hiker who wanted to have the what-a-small-pack-you-have discussion. As usual, he proceeded to tell me that I wasn’t getting the real thru-hiking experience, though he tried to be nice about it. I explained that for me, my choice was between doing a supported hike or staying home, as leaving my wife behind for six months just wasn’t an option, but I got no traction with him.
I was crushed. His opinion of my hike means so much to me.
Hiking to Daleville in the Heat
By noon, temperatures reached the mid-80’s. In Arizona, that’s a nice winter day. Except for the humidity. I guzzled all the water I could and ground out the miles, grateful for the shade of the long green tunnel and the wisps of breeze whenever I got near any kind of ridge.
I took a break at “The Monolith,” a bedrock knob reminiscent of the Dragon’s Tooth, but without the view. I was too hot and tired to climb it. But it made a nice back rest.
Daleville/Troutville
Northstar was just pulling up to the VA220 crossing when I walked out of the woods. She had the air conditioning cranked up and had put a Gatorade in the freezer for me. Sweet.
We’d heard that Troutville Trail Days was happening just down the road, but got there and found that Gus wasn’t welcome. What? Parks are for dogs, not people. Several people at the gate encouraged us to just go in and make them throw us out, but I’m just not that confrontational. Plus, there weren’t that many exhibits and we had other things to do.
One of which was trying to get new tips for my trekking poles. I’d tried to get them in Roanoke, but the outfitters there were useless. One sold only clothes (Walkabout) and the other told me to go to Daleville (Roanoke Mountain). The folks at Outdoor Trails in Daleville were very friendly and helpful, but were out of Black Diamond tips. But they did offer to let us boondock in their parking lot, which we did, mostly because it was right by the trailhead and a Krogers.
Catching Up at Krogers
We parked outside the Krogers for the afternoon, with the doors open and Gus leashed up so he could enjoy the grass on one of the parking islands. We had a lot of people drive slowly by or stop to look in the van, which happens more than you’d think.
At one point, I looked up to see a guy carrying a grocery bag staring in. As he said something about hiking, I recognized the voice but not the face. It was Machina, now beardless, 20 pounds lighter, and rebranded as “Chopsticks.” I guess he got tired of explaining the “Deus Ex Machina” thing.
I’d thought he be in Pennsylvania by now. Apparently, he had taken a double zero at the Super 8 next door. Wheels, Shamrock, and bunch of others were there too.
How Are You Holding Up?
He asked how I was holding up, which I thought was an odd question. But when I thought about it, I realized I was tired. Bone tired. Muscles and joints tired. When I'm hiking, I feel great. But if I sit down for any length of time, I move like an old man when I get up.
And not just “that was a long day tired.” I am cumulatively tired. I need to think hard about that, as I’ve got an aggressive itinerary the next two weeks. More on that tomorrow.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665040,"A Shaky Start
We had a rough night. Northstar ate something funky and couldn’t get to sleep. Then, a semi pulled in right next to us and parked overnight with its engine running, blasting its exhaust our direction. At 3:00 am, Northstar still hadn’t slept. Such are the vagaries of vanlife.
I finally gave up around 5:00 am and crawled out of bed with sore knees and a belly tart of my own. I downed my breakfast and some Vitamin I and headed out under an overcast sky that threatened rain. At least I’d get a break from the heat.
The Plan
Uncertain about boondocking options along the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP), we decided to meet at Black Horse Gap for lunch. The AT first crosses the BRP at Black Horse Gap, after a long, gradual, 13.8-mile climb out of Daleville. Once there, I’d make the call whether I wanted to hike further that afternoon to try to log my target mileage or camp there and have a short day. If I went on, I’d leave Gus with Northstar.
Part of our uncertainty came from conflicting information about whether boondocking is allowed along the BRP. Some websites said yes, but others noted that potential parking spots exist or that the chances of getting noticed by anyone who’d care are low. I figured we’d look for ourselves before making the call. If we had to, we’d head to one of the Park Service or private campgrounds located just off the BRP.
Climbing to the BRP
I spent most of the morning’s walk pondering our plan, as well as Machina/Chopstick’s comment about the Virginia Blues being more of a fatigue factor than a function of geography. The trail was pleasant enough, with nice meadows and creeks in the lowlands around Daleville and Troutville, and a smooth, soft path once the trail began to climb into the woods.
I thought I heard a bear in the dense underbrush just before the Interstate 81 crossing but couldn’t get a glimpse of whatever it was. Then we crossed US11, where Gus and I stopped to watch the Half-Ironman bicyclists zoom by. Apparently, the event was today, not yesterday, as I’d been told. We cheered as they pedaled by, but only got a smile out of one of them. Serious business, I guess.
We passed the “1/3 of the way to Katahdin” marker next, a laminated piece of paper stapled to a telephone pole. Its location is off by a mile due to changes in the AT’s length this year, but who’s really counting? I texted a picture of the marker to my family, and inadvertently included a missing cat poster mounted just below it. Which inspired a string of AT/cat puns, like “maybe it’s not lost, it’s just Cat-Hidin’.”
I walked steadily, but slower than usual to nurse my knees, all the time expecting Chopsticks, Wheels, Shamrock, and Navigator to catch up and provide a little diversion and entertainment. But they never appeared, so as always, I had the early morning trail to myself.
The Allure of Wild Camping
At one point I passed one of many nice tent sites along the trail and found myself thinking about the “real” thru hiker’s comments yesterday. In many ways, he was right that I am missing out on some typical elements of thru hiking. I’d love to stop at one of those tent sites I’d just passed, watch the sunset and the stars come out, and listen to the night sounds in the woods. I enjoy the routine of making my breakfast tea on the trail, packing up, and heading out at first light.
Then again, I see a lot of the “real” thru hikers heading for motels or hostels, especially when the weather turns bad. I normally spend about two months a year in a tent, between work and river trips, so I’ve had my share of both good and Type II camping fun. I’m okay with missing some of that during this hike.
Eventually, I climbed into the low clouds and walked in a wet mist for the rest of the day. Near the summit, just before stopping to get Gus a drink at the Fullhardt Knob Shelter, I saw a large bear (#5) run across the trail, its distinctive gait silhouetted in the thick fog.
The Virginia Blues
About three miles out from Black Horse Gap, I passed a couple filtering water at Wilson Creek. When I stopped to chat, they mentioned that they were slackpacking out to the Peaks of Otter wayside, “an easy 19 miles from Daleville.” They also said that this was the last water stop for a long way, but I declined since I still had almost two liters and would be meeting Northstar in about an hour.
Oddly, they brought up the “Virginia Blues,” that I’d been talking about with Chopsticks yesterday afternoon and thinking about all morning. The Virginia Blues attributes high thru-hiker dropout rates in Virginia to being in one state for 521 miles.
The couple, like me, had decided that geography has little to do with it, but cumulative fatigue does. After all, the trail doesn’t look that much different in Virginia than it does in Georgia, North Carolina, and “Tennessee.” State lines are nice progress points, but they don’t change the trail much. But at this point, most hikers have been walking for at least two months, which puts a lot of stress on the body and mind.
Back to the Plan
I spent the rest of the morning thinking about my upcoming itinerary, which has a lot of 20-mile days. My plan included finishing Virginia by the end of June and included three consecutive 20-milers so I’d reach the James River in three days. But why? If Alaska cuts me loose, I’ll have an extra two weeks, so I have no need to rush. On the other hand, I seem to be able to hike 20 miles in a day.
As I wrestled with the itinerary in my head, I realized that Fleetwood Mac was whispering “You Can Go Your Own Way” in my ear. My subconscious earworm to the rescue.
I walked into Black Horse Gap having decided to stop for the day. I’d spend the afternoon writing, hanging out with Northstar, and resting my weary bones.
And that’s when everything fell apart.
Bring on the Clustercuss
Just as I reached the BRP, I got a text from Northstar saying the BRP was closed. She’d tried several routes and they were all blocked off. Lines of cars and trucks were backed up. The truck drivers had no idea why. No cops were around to explain. She’d looked online and found nothing but a months-old article about a landslide closing the BRP.
Her original route, the one given by the FarOut app, had taken her to a horse trail that was obviously closed to traffic unless she wanted to hike four miles. What the heck? And then she’d clipped another concrete post at a gas station, taking off another chuck of the van’s trim. Needless to say, Northstar was reaching her limit.
Choose Your Poison
As we were talking, the couple from the water stop walked up, along with a father/daughter who came up a side trail. All of us were counting on a ride, none of us had brought camping gear, and the weather had turned colder and wetter. And I was down to my last liter of water. The only things we could do were hunker down here and hope the road opened eventually or hike on to the nearest side road and try to catch a ride off the mountain. If the side roads were open.
The father/daughter chose to stay put. The couple and I decided to hike on. About an hour later, the couple got through to their shuttle driver, who’d discovered that the road was closed for the Half Ironman competition. Remember all those bikes I’d seen on US11? I guess the route included this section of the BRP. Surprise!
Sure enough, around 2:00 pm, we started seeing cars on the BRP again. But by then, I’d lost cell service with Northstar, so I was committed to meeting her at the VA695/BRP intersection, an 8-mile walk from our original meetup point. My restful 13.6-mile day just morphed into an epic 21.6-mile day.
But Wait, There's More!
We had our usual no-cell-service meetup problems but eventually found each other around 4:30 pm. By then, I was wet, cold, and worn out. We headed down to the NPS’ Peaks of Otter campground for the night, but got distracted by the resort’s restaurant, and decided we’d both earned a nice dinner.
Halfway through dinner, my teeth started chattering, even though I was inside with dry clothes and a jacket on. So, Northstar booked a room at the resort, put the shower on extra hot, and put me to bed with all the blankets she could find. Although she did make me get up to help de-tick Gus, who’d managed to adopt a dozen or so friends during his long day.
I didn’t fully warm up until about 2:30 in the morning, when I woke up and realized I didn’t need my hat and sweatshirt anymore.
Tomorrow can be nothing but better, right? At the very least, I deserve a late start, a hot breakfast, and a leisurely cup of piping hot tea.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665096,"Zombieland
I woke up multiple times last night. The first time, it took me a full minute to figure out where I was, and a few moments longer for anything to make sense. Northstar told me it was only 10:30 pm. I sat up thinking I felt better, but as soon as the covers fell off, I started shivering again. I dug in beneath them and was asleep again in seconds.
I woke again around 1:00 am but didn’t have the energy for anything other than looking at the time on my phone and fumbling around in my first aid kit for some Advil. At 2:30, I woke finally feeling warm enough to be clammy, and shed my sweatshirt, base layer, and hat. And for some reason, just one of my socks.
By sunrise, I woke to find that I’d pushed off the extra blankets. I had a slight headache, my knees throbbed when I moved, and my stomach had that bloated feeling you get before a mass exodus from the deeps. I lay on my back, staring at the ceiling, deciding what kind of hike I’d do today.
Better is Not Necessarily Good
Northstar woke sometime later and asked if I was feeling better. The correct answer to that question was “Yes.” I did feel better. But I did not feel good. Then she asked if I wanted to hike or stay another day, but immediately followed up with, “Nevermind, I know you, you’ll want to hike.” And then proceeded to suggest that I was an idiot (respectfully) and I should just rest.
After a long pause, I answered that I wanted to do exactly nothing today. I was wrung out.
I don’t know if I had a virus, some kind of fast-moving flu, mild hypothermia, or just wore myself out, but I knew for certain that I didn’t need a repeat of anything close to yesterday’s 22-mile slog.
Nap My Own Nap
Around noon, I got up just long enough to force down some oatmeal before heading back to bed. By evening, I felt well enough to eat dinner with Northstar, but my heart really wasn’t in it. If you know me at all, you know that lying in bed all day and not eating are not normal for me.
Just before I fell asleep again, I got a text from my Alaska clients saying, “we want you to finish the AT…bucket lists are important…don’t worry about this summer’s field schedule.” Best clients ever. Jim, Lael, Ron, Rocky, Tisha, Danny, Jamie, Wendy, and Kara – I owe you. Stay safe out there.
Here’s hoping for a solid night of sleep and fresh start tomorrow. If I hike, it’ll be a short day.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665157,"What To Do When You’re Not 100 Percent
I woke up feeling off, but not quite sick. I wasn’t hungry, which was weird, and I couldn’t finish my oatmeal. Oatmeal never goes unfinished at my breakfast table. And my stomach still had that bloated about-to-explode feeling. Clearly, the best thing to do was strap on a tight hip belt and go hiking.
Hiking downhill, of course, and only eight miles. Though when I started out, I realized I’d misread the mileage and had thought I only had six. Six, eight, twenty-one, it’s all the same thing. I just wanted to chip something off the distance to Katahdin. Plus, we’d cleaned all the ticks off Gus, and he was ready to hunt down a fresh batch.
The Hike
I couldn’t have asked for a nicer day. The woods smelled great this morning – a hint of pine, but basically just refreshing, clean air. I don’t think I’ve ever noticed it before.
After a short climb out of Bear Wallow Gap, the trail gradually descended to Jennings and Middle Creeks. Perfect for walking, seeing, and seeing what I see.
And thinking. I spent the morning in my head thinking about my adolescence and the trials I put my poor parents through. I have no idea why my brain went there. It’s probably the same answer I gave guy on Facebook who asked how in the world did I think of dividing the AT’s length by Pi to come up with the 700-mile Pi(e) Challenge. I answered him, “Dude, I’ve been hiking alone for 58 days. There’s nothing I haven’t thought about.”
Providence or Serendipity?
About four miles in, still along the ridge, a pair of white-haired hikers appeared up ahead, walking towards me. When I pulled aside to let them pass, they warned me that a rattlesnake was stretched out across the trail about 100 feet ahead. We chatted about rattlesnakes and Arizona for a minute or two and then went our separate ways.
After they hiked on, I thought how fortunate to have met them just then, as I had been distracted and inattentive all morning. I could have easily stepped right on the snake without noticing.
I walked up slowly and found a three- to four-foot rattler, with his head in a bush and his tail halfway across the trail. Given his girth, he’d just eaten something. Thinking he’d be fat and happy, I tried to sneak by, but he was in no mood to share the trail. He coiled up, stuck his buzzer straight up, and put his head in the attack position. Gus and I backed up and found an alternate route through the brush.
If the Snake Doesn’t Get You, the Fawn Will
After passing Mr. Buzzworm, I pulled out my camera to record a video about him. When I did, I saw a doe and fawn standing in the trail about 150 feet ahead. I switched to camera mode and tried to zoom in, expecting them to bound off before I could focus. Instead, they walked right toward us.
Great, I thought, I survived the rattlesnake but am going to be killed by a rabid fawn. Actually, I’m pretty sure the doe saw Gus and assumed I had a little brown fawn of my own. She was bringing hers over for a play date. When they got to within 15 feet, Gus decided a play date would be just fine and walked over to meet them. Frankly, he was so quiet, I’d forgotten he was behind me and off leash.
Once Gus came out from behind me, the doe realized that my fawn was too ugly to play with hers and jumped to the left. The fawn jumped right. Gus spun in place trying to keep both of them in front of him. And then it got a little chaotic. The fawn ran off and doe started running circles around Gus, darting back and forth across the trail, all while doing this weird hacking cough thing. For his part, Gus never barked or chased either of them, and he came right back when I called him.
As Gus came back, the doe ran around behind me, passing a few feet away and cough/hacked her way through the underbrush over the ridge where the fawn had gone. Bizarre. I’d never seen anything like it.
Did Anyone Else See All That?
Five minutes later I saw a backpacker ahead of me. She was all bundled up like it was cold out. Her hood was up, covering her face, and she wore gloves and long pants. I greeted her, but she was grumpy and sullen. I was still pumped with adrenalin, so I asked if she saw the rattlesnake.
“Snake?”, she said. Now she was interested. The hood came off to reveal raven-black hair. And was that a wart on her hooked nose? “Where?”, she asked eagerly.
“Well,” I said, “Did you pass an older couple a few minutes ago on the ridge?” She gave me a weird look and said she hadn’t seen anyone all day. What? How could you not see two friendly people walk right past you? She shrugged and suddenly lost interest.
The Only Rational Explanation
Then it dawned on me. Clearly, the older couple were guardian angels sent to warn me of impending danger in the form of an evil serpent. Obviously, the grumpy woman was a snake-loving witch unable to see angels. Or she had left the snake on the trail to get me, possibly her revenge for noticing the cryptids along Dismal Creek last week.
I’m not sure how the fawn fits into all that. Maybe it’s the exception that proves the rule, or maybe it was an evil fawn infected with deer ticks. Or more likely, that I should have stayed in bed another day.
What About Caesar?
I did promise a Caesar, didn’t I? Eight miles counts as a nero, right? And Nero was one of the … Never mind, blame it on the fever.
Blue Blazin’
When I reached Jennings Creek Road, I left the AT and headed up VA614 toward the Middle Creek Campground where Kate had secured a campsite for the night. That’s right, I blue blazed* 1.5 miles. In the morning, I’ll blue blaze right out again, connecting back up with the AT a few miles north.
No apologies, no rationale, no guilt. I’m hiking my own hike, which we now know has been blessed by angels.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665192,"Feeling Better
I woke up feeling much better. Not 100%, but well enough for a full day on the trail. I mapped out a 17-mile day, identified some bailout points along the Blue Ridge Parkway if needed, and happily blue-blazed back to the AT.
Blue Blazin’ With BullDogs and No Blazes
A mile up the gravel road, I encountered two unchained bulldogs actively patrolling the front yard of an unfenced home. Fortunately, Gus had stayed with Northstar due to a light rain when I left and today’s long climbs. The latter was for my sake, not his. Managing a dog on long days is an unnecessary hassle. The bulldogs barked and growled at me but stayed on their grass, keeping pace with me as I walked quickly past.
The “official” blue blaze was supposed to begin where the gravel road ended. Instead, the road split into three directions, none of which were blazed, and all of which generally headed toward the AT. Without the FarOut app, I would have had to guess and hike a half-mile or more before finding out if I got it right. Instead, I just watched my little location icon to make sure I stayed on the mapped trail. Easy peasy.
FarOut might be the most useful thing I carry with me, although the comment section content for their marker points can be hit or miss. Just like the comment section of anything on the web, I suppose. A few users had commented that this morning’s blue blaze trail was as “sketchy as [*#4%].” Hardly. Aside from lacking blazes, the trail was as obvious and easy to follow as the AT.
Freakin’ Van
Somewhere along the blue blaze section, Northstar texted that the van wouldn’t start, but followed up a few minutes later that it had started. I think this is our new life in the van – intermittent starting.
Northstar spent the rest of the morning on the phone and internet with dealership service departments trying to schedule the repair. The short story: the needed part does not exist.
Don’t Buy a RAM ProMaster!
The long story: I’ll spare you the details, but numerous internet sites report the starting defect in the RAM ProMaster, including RAM’s own site. But RAM has not issued a recall. Nor are they manufacturing a replacement part. Why? Because they do not want to sell more vans, obviously. On the upside, if I drop one of my kids on their head, I can take comfort in that they’ll fit right in as an executive at the RAM corporation.
The RAM service departments who are authorized to do the repair absolutely will not tell you that they cannot do the repair or that the needed part is on backorder with no announced delivery date. But they insist that you schedule an appointment for the diagnosis. Watch the movie “Brazil” and you’ll get the gist of it. If you think I’m bitter, Northstar tells this story with even more venom and sarcasm, and she’s the nice one of us.
Rattlesticks
After yesterday’s rattlesnake encounter, I had a mild case of the snake willies all morning. I come from rattlesnake country and have met my share of venomous snakes. I’ve even had one strike at me (I jumped just in time, totally by instinct). Consequently, this morning I saw a dozen rattlesticks on the trail, stopping abruptly for each one and even jumping back once. For any non-Arizonan’s reading along, a rattlestick is a stick that pretends to be a snake.
Speaking of yesterday’s encounters, I met the witch again, though she turned out to be quite nice. And wart-less. So, probably not a real witch. Then again, she did appear just after I almost stepped on a copperhead (seriously). And she asked to borrow my phone, which is a sure sign of evil. Maybe the jury’s still out on that one.
Is the AT the Hardest of Them All?
I also met an Arizonan named Boomerang, who is on the third leg of his triple crown. I caught up to him on the long climb out of the Middle Creek Valley and chatted briefly, but then leapfrogged him all day long, chatting each time we passed. American thru hikers call hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the AT the “Triple Crown.”
I asked Boomerang whether he agreed with Pay It Forward’s opinion that the AT was the hardest of the three and he scoffed. He thought the CDT was the hardest by far, followed by the PCT, due to their high elevations (> 10,000 ft), snowy passes, lack of water and trail support, long carries between resupplies, and extreme weather.
He said the AT is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s also not the hardest. But then he said he’s only done a third of the AT so far and that I should ask him again in September.
Great Stuff on the Trail Today
The Guillotine. A well-known rock formation with a huge boulder suspended between two cliff faces over the trail.Black Rocks Overlook. Nice views and a cool breeze made for nice break spot and a sketchy climb to the perch.The Appalachians in Virginia are just so green. I’ve lived in Arizona for so long, I just can’t get over all the rich shades of green. And when all that green moves in the breeze, it’s magic.
Weird Stuff on the Trail Today
Why do people carry their trekking poles? I followed and passed one guy all day long and never once saw him put his pole tips on the ground. He carried them 17+ miles.I saw a day hiker with the giant AT beard who was wearing a kilt and I really wanted to ask, but grown-up me said I couldn’t.The shelters along this stretch of the AT are closed due to “aggressive bear activity.” I stopped at one for water and watched a guy setting up his tent right next to the shelter under the closure sign. I hope I won’t be reading about him in the news tomorrow.I tried to use my nature ID app to identify the copperhead, but it couldn’t get beyond Genus: Copperheads, Cottonmouths, and Cantils. It recommended that I move closer for a better shot. Uh, no. It had no rattle, but once the app said “Viper” I knew all I needed to know.A minute after I saw the viper, I tried to be a white-haired guardian angel for a shorts- and sandals-wearing approaching hiker, but he couldn’t have cared less.
Feeling Worse
Northstar arrived right on time at Petite’s Gap, moments after I hiked in. But when I leaned in for a hello kiss, she warned me off with two hands up. Her stomach was exploding, she said, best not to get too close. We’d planned to camp right at the trailhead, but I decided she’d be better off in her own bed near a clean bathroom.
Instead, I found her a lumpy bed and dirty bathroom at the Relax Inn near Glascow. But it’s the thought that counts, right?
More on her condition tomorrow.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665276,"Ugh, What a Night
Northstar had a rough night. The motel I picked for her turned out to be a bit of a dive, but it was the only one that allowed dogs, was close enough to the trail that we could get there before her insides exploded, and was a place I could get a shuttle back up to the trail in the morning.
The cheesy motel didn’t cause her rough night. And it was way better for both of us than trying to sleep in the van while sick. Based on her symptoms, she thinks she either had food poisoning or Norovirus. Northstar is blaming the undercooked burger she bought at Middle Creek Campground. Another hiker told me that Daleville just had a significant Noro outbreak which has followed the bubble up the trail. But Northstar has almost no contact with hikers except me, and she’s extremely fastidious.
Her symptoms were different enough from mine, so I don’t think she had whatever took me down after my long hike out of Daleville.
Sparkles & Circuit, Future Hiking Legends
Regardless of the cause, Northstar was in no condition to drive me back up to Petite’s Gap, so the good folks at Stanimal’s hostel filled in for her. I shared the shuttle with Sparkles and Circuit, who started their hike in the Florida Keys in January. They flew past Springer Mountain on April 27 and have been logging 20’s and 30’s since then. They plan to hike past Katahdin on the Eastern Continental Trail into Canada, assuming Canada hasn’t burned to crisp by then.
Last year, they yo-yo’d* the Arizona and Colorado Trails, finishing all four legs of the yo-yo just in time to head to the Keys. They looked great, but said they’re both bone tired, sick of trail food, the rain, camping, their smell, and hiking. They’d just taken five days off to get their heads in a better place. If five days at the Glasgow Relax Inn gets you to a better place, you know you needed an upgrade.
We had a 40-minute drive to their drop off point, so we had plenty of time to swap Arizona stories and compare desert hiking with AT trail conditions. I almost started to miss Phoenix until I remembered that they’re hitting 100F daily with air pollution alerts. I think I’ll stay in the mountains for a few more months.
Passive-Aggressive Bears
I didn’t get dropped off until 10:00 am, an unusually late start for me. I stopped to take a picture of the “Aggressive Bear Warning” signs at Petite’s Gap, looked up, and noticed a bear sitting by the side of the trail, less than 100 feet from the road. We looked at each other for a solid minute until I raised my hands and gave him a “Hey, Bear!” I didn’t even yell it, but he bounded off into the brush.
I heard him crunching around just out of sight as I hiked away…right into a second bear. This one took off running as soon as he saw me. Good thing we didn’t camp at the Gap last night. Running outside to barf is bad enough without running into bears, even “aggressive” ones that run away when spoken to. For those who are counting, those were bears #6 and #7 for me.
Squirrel
Remember Squirrel, a fellow “elderly” hiker from my first night in the Smokies (according to 18-year-old Mousefeathers)? I bumped into him today along the James River path. He’s not the speediest hiker, so I never expected to see him again, but there he was. I guess we all just accordion along, and you never know who will show up on the trail.
The friendliness factor on the trail increased significantly since the Smokies. With the exception of some of the more insular tramilies,** and the occasional scary hiker (there were two today), most of us will at least exchange pleasantries as we pass on the trail. About half will stop and chat for a few minutes. Maybe there are fewer faces to remember in Virginia than there were in North Carolina, so it’s easier to recognize each other.
The Virginia Blues
The high dropout rate in Virginia is often blamed on the length of the trail compared to other states, as if crossing state lines is the only thing that keeps hikers motivated. As for me, I’m loving Virginia, except possibly its tick population. And I’ve been hiking Virginia for 320 miles so far and nothing about it has made me blue.
Virginia has so many iconic locations – Damascus, the Creeper Trail, Mount Rodgers, Grayson Highlands, Azaleas & Rhododendron tunnels, Keffer Oak, Bruiser Knob Cairns, Audie Murphy Monument, Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs, Blue Ridge Parkway, Guillotine, James River Footbridge – and I’m only about half-way through the state – how could anyone get the blues?
The Virginia Blues is about cumulative fatigue after two months and 700 miles of hiking, camping, and eating trail food. It has nothing to do with Virginia.
Smoke
Today’s haze had me puzzled at first. It wasn’t hot or humid enough for summer haze, but visibility from the ridges was limited. I could barely see the valley bottoms.
Then I read online about the wildfires in Canada which are closing parts of the trail up north. It’s hard to believe but Canada’s smoke is here in western Virginia. Northstar said she smells it, but my sniffer hasn’t worked well for years (to my benefit lately), so I’ll have to take her word for it. Pray for rain in Canada.
Every Day on the AT is a Good Day
I passed a young thru hiker in the early afternoon. He was all smiles and enthusiasm, had the skipped-a-generation-wannabe-hippy vibe going strong, and had one of those “Look! I can grow a beard!” chin things some young men in their late teens cultivate. We had a nice chat about trail stuff. As I left, I asked how his day was going and he answered, “Every day on the AT is a good day.”
I’m a cynical old curmudgeon, so I almost stopped and poked at that. Six decades of life experience and a naturally pessimistic outlook has taught me that not every day is good. So far this week, I’ve had an unexpected road closure, a sudden illness, two venomous snake encounters, another sudden illness, a van accident, rain, and wildfire smoke. Other hikers have experienced much worse.
Fortunately, six decades has also given me a small measure of tact, so I just smiled at him and said, “You’re absolutely right. There’s no place I’d rather be today.”
Life will kick some of the enthusiasm, optimism, and idealism out of him soon enough. It will need no help from me.
Also, he is right.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665319,"The Text No One Wants
“Love you. Please contact me asap. Sad news. I’m going to tell you via text because I don’t want you to think it’s the kids or anything. I’m so sorry to tell you that your brother died in his sleep last night.”
When I reached the top of the 3,700-foot climb up Bluff Mountain from the James River and turned on my phone, this text from Northstar popped up. I had put my phone in airplane mode when I started hiking because I had forgotten to charge it overnight.
I’d climbed well, despite a migraine and realizing half-way up that I’d forgotten Gus’ dog chow and water, which put us both on reduced rations for the day. Suddenly, none of that mattered.
My brother was only 66. He had three great kids, seven grandkids, and had been married to his college sweetheart for 44 years. A few years ago, he’d left a corporate job to start his own successful consulting business. His firm was just taking off.
Five days ago, we’d planned to meet up near Roanoke, but the combination of his family and work obligations and my long day along the closed Blue Ridge Parkway put a stop to that. No matter, we’d catch up at his place in Indianapolis on our drive back to Arizona in the fall. We had plenty of time.
Except that we didn’t.
Hiking in a Daze
I only vaguely remember my hike after that. Aside from a nasty pond Gus found by a shelter and returned from caked in reeking mud I smelled all afternoon, it all went by in a blur. I saw some ridgetop views, lovely green groves, mountain streams, a dozen deer, and some lovely flowers, but I forgot to photograph most of it.
Was this one of the “good days” on the AT that youthful hiker was enthused about yesterday?
800 Miles
In the early afternoon, I hiked up to the 800-mile marker. Two hikers my age sat there, digging a late lunch out of their bear cannisters. Three international hikers walked in just behind me (South Africa, Switzerland, and Quebec). We took the obligatory selfies by the pinecones that spelled out 800 and exchanged our trail names.
The two older hikers were named Jethro and Shazam. Shazam’s name got a laugh and the obvious follow-up question. No, he wasn’t named for the superhero or the musical act. He’d given up eating meat some years ago for health reasons and took the name Belteshazzar in honor of a Biblical character who’d done the same thing. Belteshazzar turned out to be too much of a mouthful for most hikers, who shortened it to Shazam.
If you want to kill a conversation in the modern world, just mention the Bible. After a second of awkward silence, I asked Shazam, “So…Daniel wasn’t an option?” Belteshazzar was the prophet Daniel’s Babylonian name (think Daniel and the Lion’s Den). Shazam and Jethro caught my eye and gave a little nod indicating that we each knew which team we played for.
Are You Having a Good Day?
Then one of the three internationals asked me if I was having a good day and I robotically started to answer, “Yes, it’s a …” and then stopped myself. “No.” I said, “This not a good day. It’s an awful day. I just found out my brother died unexpectedly early this morning.”
Everyone offered their condolences and sympathetically asked the right kinds of heartfelt questions. It felt cathartic to talk to someone about it, though it hardly removed the pain. After a few minutes, the internationals walked on, and I followed them out a bit later.
Done
After a short walk from the 800-mile spot, I arrived early at my pickup point, which turned out to be a sketchy gravel road by a wobbly wooden suspension foot bridge over the Pedlar River. I enticed Gus into the swimmable river with a game of fetch, hoping to remove a few layers of the smelly mud and some of the ticks he’d undoubtedly picked up today.
Then I leashed him up and took him back up to the road to dry off while we waited for Northstar. There was too much mud along the riverbank to let him roam unleashed.
Providence or Serendipity?
As we waited, the sky clouded over and began to drizzle. I got up to dig out my rain gear and saw Jethro and Shazam coming down the trail on their way north. Jethro saw me and came right over, saying he couldn’t get me out of his mind. His brother had died under similar circumstances a few years ago. Then he asked if I’d be willing to let them pray for me. Mind? I’d be honored and grateful.
We stood together, exchanged our “real” names, choked out prayers for Tim’s family and mine, and added a few drops of our own to the rain. Thankful for our “chance” meeting, we parted ways feeling comforted and encouraged.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, Thou art with me. 
So, yes, youthful hiker, I had a bad day on the AT. But parts of it were very good.

After everything thrown at us last week, we needed a day or two off.
Northstar had improved, but relapsed again after she picked me up on Day 60. I decided that I’m not moving again until she’s better. She’d moved out of the Relax Inn and found us a nice quiet place in Lexington, Virginia where we hunkered down to lick our wounds and heal.
I’ve been taking my morning tea under a huge magnolia tree in the middle of the motel’s big grassy lawn, soaking up the shade and sending Gus out into the sun on stick-fetching missions. The pure joy he radiates as he’s returning with his new favorite stick is restorative.
I haven’t got much to say today.
Thanks for the kind words, prayers, and encouragement some of you sent about my brother’s passing.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665483,"Welcome Back
The AT welcomed me back with a day of drizzle, fog, and humidity. I don’t mind hiking in a drizzle, and I absolutely love walking in fog. I could have done without the humidity, but it still felt good to have the trail under my feet again. And by “good,” I mean slightly painful. As usual.
It never rained hard enough to pull out my rain gear, but my clothes were damp all day, either with sweat or rain. For the most part, my body heat kept pace and kept me from getting totally soaked. Plus, trail maintainers had recently cut back most the overhanging vegetation which kept me from getting smacked with wet grass and leaves all day.
I’m still not 100% yet. I felt well enough to hike, but the climbs felt tougher than they should have, and my pace suffered. A group of four young men pulled away at the bottom of the 4-mile, 2,800-foot climb up Bald Knob and I just let them go. I didn’t even try to keep up. I passed them when they stopped for water a half mile later though and they never caught me afterward. But still, I didn’t have the fight in me I usually have.
What Would I Do If?
US60 crosses the trail about a third of the way up the long climb to Bald Knob. For some reason, as I climbed, I found myself pondering what I would do if Northstar was at the crossing having decided that she wanted to go home. I was deep down that rabbit hole when I stepped out of the woods and saw our van parked across the road. Uh oh. We weren’t supposed to meet until Salt Log Gap, about eight miles further north.
I knocked on the door but got no answer. So, I opened it up and found her cashed out in bed. She’d driven toward the pickup point, but found the steep, dirt road impassible in the rain, at least for our van. So, she’d driven back to where she had cell service, which is our standard emergency plan.
She woke up to find me staring at her with “a weird look.” Stupid me, I explained why, which now sounded more ridiculous to me that it does to you. Northstar, of course, had no plans to quit and frankly, was a little insulted that I’d been thinking she might. Hey, I can’t help where my brain goes when I’m walking alone in the rain. I can’t even stop myself from writing about it later.
An Unplanned Flip Flop
Since our original meeting place was unreachable, we decided to try an alternative pickup spot six miles ahead, but this time we’d drive there together to make sure the road was open. Then it occurred to me that if the van made it up there, she could drop me off and I could hike south. I’d meet her back at US60, which had excellent cell coverage, making it a better place to wait than Salt Log Gap. As a bonus, two-thirds of my 2,800-foot climb just turned into a descent.
It turned out she’d been up the wrong road last time, so we ended up at Salt Log Gap after all, via a bumpy but drivable road rife with wildlife. We saw at least a dozen deer and two turkeys along the way, as well as a bunch of gold finches, cardinals, and other colorful songbirds. Win, win, win.
My southbound, flip-flop route still had 1,200 feet of climbing but was broken up into three separate ascents instead of one big long one. Two of the climbs took me across grassy balds, something I hadn’t expected to see in Virginia. Both were lovely, even in buried in thick fog.
By the time I reached the descent to US60, the clouds had started to lift, giving brief views of the wet valleys below and even briefer glimpses of blue patches of sky above. By the time I reached the van, the rain stopped, the sun shone, and a stiff breeze did its best to dry everything out. Also, the rain cleared most of the Canadian smoke out of the air.
Old Home Week
Compared to the last few weeks, the trail was crowded today. I’m used to having it to myself most mornings. But today, I passed two dozen hikers before I reached US60 and at least that many tents with their occupants inside, presumably waiting out the rain.
As usual, most of those I passed had nothing to say, but I forced a grudging hello out of as many of them as I could as I passed. While walking by the Brown Mountain Creek Shelter, I heard someone call out, “Is that The Incident?” As that almost never happens, I stopped and climbed up to the shelter to find PsyOps, who I’d last seen in Damascus, but hadn’t spoken to since he literally ran ahead of me trying to do a 30-miler to Fontana Dam.
You Again?
During the southbound flip-flop part of my day, I passed most of the hikers I’d passed in the morning, but now I was going the opposite direction. I could see a flash of recognition in eyes of the more sullen ones, who gave a confused nod but said nothing. A few others stopped and asked if I was doing some kind of loop.
When the trail provides a perfect opportunity to make someone pay for their morning grouchiness, you take advantage of it. I tried out a couple with different people, some of whom I strung along for a few minutes:
“Really? You saw someone who looked like me? Weird.”“Uh, no. You’re going south. I’m going north. Did you get turned around?”“You must have seen my twin brother. We’re self-shuttling and walking opposite directions.”
Later in the day I passed Proton, who I’d last seen in Hot Springs, as well as a woman who remembered meeting Gus and me somewhere near Erwin. I think my four zeros this month allowed some of the Trail Days crowd to catch up.
Out of the Haze
Still later, while I sat in the van writing, Haze walked out of the woods and past our open door. I’d last seen Haze getting out of the clown car with Machina at Mt. Rodgers HQ after Trail Days. He was days ahead of me then. I’d since heard he was with the Walrus somewhere in Pennsylvania. But no, he’d gotten shin splints and two bouts of Noro and had been off trail for more than a week.
Haze told us PhD broke his ankle and is done for the summer. In a weird coincidence, after we’d raced up Hump Mountain, PhD told me “it will take a broken ankle or something to get me off this trail…no way I’m not finishing.” He must be devastated.
After catching up, Haze went over to the roadside to try to hitch a ride into Buena Vista. Ninja, another hiker we hadn’t seen for a month, appeared next and joined Haze on the shoulder. A few minutes later, Ninja knocked on the door and asked to be taken to the urgent care in Lexington. He’d been stung by wasps and his arm was starting to swell. We just can’t seem to escape Lexington.

Last Friday marked two months on the AT. Hard to believe it’s been that long.I passed a lady this morning wearing an ankle-length clear poncho with a pointy hood that covered her face. The phrase “see-through Klansman robe” got in my head and couldn’t get out.I just heard that Bluebird is off the trail with foot problems. She crushed 600+ miles and has the chops to finish the trail. I’m sure she will.Do any hikers between the ages of 18 and 32 have the ability to express a thought without using the f-word at least once? If so, I hope I meet one someday.I met a grifter in the motel breakfast area claiming to be a thru hiker needing some help. Boy, did he pick the wrong guy. He knew a few things about the trail, but not nearly enough to convince a real thru hiker. Mostly, he just didn’t look like a hiker with 800 miles under his belt. Though apparently, neither do I, since the guy pick me as his mark. Unfortunately, the AT attracts some of those folks.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665512,"Good Sleeping Weather
Last night was deliciously cold. It had been a while since I pulled out the long johns and pulled up the covers. I left the wool socks in my clothes sack because Gus has been providing foot-warming services. We have an agreement. He gets the window well in the van, and my feet go on his back.
We’d parked 10 feet from the AT, so I was hiking by 7:00 am. Northstar barely stirred when Gus and I left to chase the morning mists. I do love walking the trail while everyone else sleeps. I didn’t see another person until 10:45 am. As a matter of fact, after seeing almost 50 people yesterday, I didn’t see more than 10 hikers today.
Perfect Walking Weather
It was a perfect morning for walking alone. The air had been freshly cleaned by yesterday’s rain, the wind had mostly dried the grasses and brush along the trail, and the night’s chill hadn’t yet burned off. Walking is best when you’d need your puffy if you stopped, but just your edges are cold while you’re moving.
Happy to be rid of the fog and rain, the woods put on a spectacular show. Ferns blanketed the forest floor, their fronds sticking out every which way, like a tow-headed nine-year-old’s hair at Saturday morning breakfast. The tree canopy let in just enough light to dapple the ferns in alternating bright sun and deep shade that gently shifted patterns with the breeze.
A strong breeze rustled the trees’ upper canopy, though the air at trail level barely moved. A chorus of invisible birds sung their greetings up there, chasing away my earworms. Occasionally, birds dropped down to dart in front of us in a flash of red or yellow, before disappearing as fast as they had appeared. Even more rarely, one landed on the trail ahead of us, bring Gus to attention though even he seemed to know this moment was not for chasing the wildlife.
On the Right Path
In a world of constant stimulation, the trail through the southern Appalachian woods is a place of constant soothing. The chilled greens and damp browns clean my mind and bring me peace. White blazes on dark brown tree trunks appear periodically to tell me I am on the right path. Most assuredly, I am on the right path.
Side Hill Trails
Side hill trails may be my favorite, and not just because they hug the contours, making the walking easy. Along a side hill traverse, I can see deep into the valley below where there ought to be bears foraging. I can also see into the upper canopy of the trees below me, which give me glimpses of the birds I usually only hear.
But most of all, I love the way the side hill trails rhythmically sag downhill like powerlines between towers. Gravity would pull the trail completely downhill if it weren’t clothespinned in place by anchoring trees, too deeply rooted to be bothered by Newton’s formulas.
Everything about the trail was soft today, at least until I reached the top of the day’s climb at The Priest. The path was soft and smooth, almost like a rubberized playground surface. Recently cleared of overgrowth, Gus and I could often walk shoulder to shin, catching each other’s eye as I told him about what he was seeing.
Milestones
Today’s milestones included Spy Rock, a lookout that promised 360-degree views and mostly delivered. We stopped for an early lunch and water at the viewpoint. I drank what I brought, and Gus sampled the rainwater trapped in bedrock depressions, which we call tinajas in the Southwest.
Next up was The Priest Shelter, where thru hikers fill the shelter log with confessions of their trail transgressions. I poured Gus a bowl of kibble while we waited to read the log and add our own sins. But when the hiker sitting next to me lit a cigarette (inside the shelter), we decided to finish our climb up The Priest (mountain) and left him to the confessional.
I confess my impatience with such behavior and that I make up names for hikers that don’t introduce themselves. Like Smokestack, who I left puffing away in the shelter. And the Witch, who passed me yesterday again without so much as a nod. Fortunately, it was too cold and wet for the snakes she’d sent my way the last two times I saw her, though I kept a sharp lookout anyway.
After we summited The Priest, we had a punishing four-mile, 3,200-foot, rocky, steppy descent that pounded my knees and ankles and had me counting the miles until we met Northstar at the Tye River.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665578,"Things That Go Crunch in the Night
I woke at 3:45 am to the sound of wheels on gravel in the Tye River trailhead parking area. Gus sat up and listened too, not in full alert mode, but definitely aware of the sound. I peeked out and saw a large sedan with its lights off idling near the entry.
I needed to visit the bushes anyway, so I climbed out of bed, turned on the lights, opened the door, and gave them the silhouette a large man to think about. Fortunately, they immediately backed out and drove off, turning their lights on after driving down the road far enough that I couldn’t see their license plates. Gus wisely stayed in bed, not wanting to escalate the situation.
An Early Start
Needless to say, I didn’t sleep after that, which put me on track for an early start on today’s long climb. Once I crossed the highway, I found that we weren’t camping alone after all. I counted five tents along the river, and another guy cowboy camping in the bushes by the parking lot. I bumped into that guy while looking for a quiet spot for my morning constitutional and accidentally walked in on his.
The trail crossed the Tye River on yet another bouncy, wooden suspension bridge, one of many in Virginia. Kudos to the ATC or the USFS for building such interesting structures to keep our feet dry. After the bridge, the trail headed up the ridge, gaining back all 3,200 feet of elevation it lost descending The Priest yesterday afternoon. Overall, I had 5,200 feet of climbing ahead of me…unless…
Options
Unless I took the Blue Blaze option. Yesterday, Smokestack had asked if I planned to Blue Blaze to the Maupin Shelter, but I had no idea what he was talking about. He said something about following a route along a creek with small waterfalls and sweet swimming holes. The route also cut off a weird horseshoe-shaped loop the AT makes along a tree-covered ridge with limited views.
My feelings about Blue Blazing have evolved over the last two months. At Springer Mountain, the thought of a Blue Blaze shortcut would set my teeth on edge. Now, I’ll consider my options, even though I almost always stick with the “official” trail, especially if the white blazes go past one of the AT’s well-known landmarks or vistas. I won’t Blue Blaze just to cut off miles or skip a steep climb.
But I will take a Blue Blaze Trail if it takes me someplace more interesting than the white blazes. And if going someplace interesting happens to lop off a few miles or shorten a climb, so much the better.
An Easy Choice
Today’s decision was obvious. I’ve seen plenty of tree-covered viewless ridges, but I rarely get to walk along noisy, cascading streams with deep pools. Plus, Gus weighed in that we both needed a bath. And when your dog starts thinking you stink, you know you really must be getting foul. That said, when I reached the bifurcation, I was climbing so well I almost decided to take the high route just for the joy of climbing.
FarOut app comments about the Blue Blaze option described the trail as a knee-busting, hard-to-follow, poorly signed, death march. Or an easy stroll in the woods. Typical internet. In fact, the trail was as well marked as the AT, and as well-maintained. The quarter-mile section along Campbell Creek was steppy and required some effort, but the sights and sounds of walking creekside were worth the effort. The route reminded me of some of the rugged trails I backpack in Arizona.
Hey ATC, Here’s a Thought
I arrived at back at the AT two hours after leaving the van, having covered nine AT miles along the five-mile Blue Blaze route. In my opinion, the ATC should adopt the Mal Har trail as the official path. The AT could use a little more variety. I suspect that the original AT route planners were peak-baggers, intent on climbing as many summits as possible, regardless of whether the peak had views that made the climb worth the effort.
But the Appalachians offer a lot more than peaks, and the AT tends to miss much of that. I’d love to walk through more of the small mountain communities, see more streams, marshes, ponds, and lakes, and explore some of the deep valleys. I love what I have been seeing along the ridges, but I suspect there’s much more to see that the AT misses.
Fun With Smokestack
I saw Smokestack walking out of the Maupin Shelter just when I reached the clearing, but I stopped for a break so Gus could eat my lunch. Lately, I pour out his kibble and he just looks at me expectantly, knowing that I’ll soon give in. He yogis my cheese first, then hints around that some tuna would go nicely with more cheese. I’ve tried mixing it in with his kibble, but he just sniffs at it, and then sits and stares at me while I work on my share of my lunch. Oddly, when we get back to the van, he’ll wolf down all the kibble I put in his bowl. His yogi routine is strictly a trail thing.
We caught Smokestack on the next climb. I thanked him for tipping me off to the Blue Blaze option and asked him about his hike. Since he couldn’t get away, and I refused to go ahead, I could pepper him with questions until he reluctantly gave in to conversing with this old geezer. It was work. Not only was he an unenthusiastic conversationalist, he really needed a shower. Hanging around close enough to talk was punishing.
Just as our conversation began to gain some momentum, a pair of older women (that is, people my age) approached from the other direction and stopped to chat. As I said hi, out of the corner of my eye I could see Smokestack assessing the situation. As soon as I started answering their first question, he gave me a look of gratitude and jetted off faster than I’d ever seen him move, smiling over his shoulder as he escaped.
Not So Fast, Smoky
The ladies and I had a nice chat about how much we loved the AT in Virginia and the myth of the Virginia Blues. They lived near the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP) and were day hiking one of their favorites. When I said something about how well maintained the trail was today and how it was easy on the feet, I thought I caught a look between them, but didn’t follow up with a question. I should have asked.
I caught Smokestack on the descent into Reid’s Gap, where the AT intersects the BRP. But this time, I just waved and passed. He’s a decent guy, but I have no need to talk with anyone that would rather not talk with me. He did ask my name as I passed. And now I see I have someone named Smokestack commenting on my blog, though I think they’re just teasing me. I don’t think anyone under 30 reads old geezer blogs.
Black Dog Meets Gus Dog
Or so Black Dog implied when I ran into him along the next leg of the trail. I’d met Black Dog in the Smoky’s, but I hadn’t seen him since the climb out of Hot Springs. Today, I rounded a bend and saw a phone set atop a tripod with its recording video on, but no one in sight. I stopped and looked around, then saw a guy hiking down the trail towards the camera. He was apparently getting the classic “walking past” shot for a vlog.
We chatted briefly about vlogging. I originally set up a YouTube channel with the intention of posting some trail videos but found that blogging occupies enough of my limited spare time. I enjoy writing. Editing videos is work. As I spoke, I could see Black Dog looking at me with the skeptical eyes of the young. Video is their medium. Writing is for the aged.
In fact, when I mentioned that I blog for The Trek, he said “Yeah, there’s another old guy who blogs, and I guess he gets a lot of reads.” Another old guy. I guess. The implication was that I’m old and that it is somewhat shocking that some people still read. That’s hilarious but correct. And a little bit agist.
The AT Gets Mean
The five miles of trail between Three Ridges Overlook and Humpback Ridge Picnic Area is punishing. I’m pretty sure the two ladies I met earlier knew it, but we’re kind enough to let me find out for myself when I mentioned how nice the trail had been this morning. It’s as rocky as any section of the AT so far. I think I walked a quarter mile in places without stepping on any dirt. My feet were pounded by the time I crossed paths with Black Dog.
Many of the rocks that comprised the trail were loose, with gaps that caught my poles, stopping me cold and yanking my arm back. In places, trail crews had made elaborate steps from slabs of rock. The rock work was impressive, but the too-high steps were difficult to ascend and their spacing prevented me from establishing a consistent pace. I come from a land of rocky trails, and this section matched the worst of those.
Since there were no views in this rocky mess and the trail was buried in the deep woods, I had only the gusting wind to keep me entertained. The treetops were shaking like wild long-haired women at a rave, making the tree trunks creak and moan like, well, like my knees and hips. The only time I’d take my eyes off my foot placement was when I heard a branch creak like it was giving way. Then I’d scan the canopy to find likely candidates and decide whether to duck, run, or pray.
A branch cracked suddenly above me. I heard the snap and the sound of a branch cartwheeling down through the leaves, but before I had a chance to react, it hit the ground, landing on the edge of the trail 20 feet in front of me. It wasn’t big enough to kill me but it would have definitely left a mark.
Home is Where the Van Is
Despite slow walking over the rocky last few miles, I hiked into the Humpback Ridge Picnic Area around 12:30, in time for a late (second) lunch. Northstar was craving Starbucks and frustrated with the cell coverage and convinced me to wait until we drove into Waynesboro.
Mr. The Incident may have been a little hangry by the time we got off the mountain, and possibly had a slight tantrum when Siri had us make three U-turns in a row to get to the Starbucks. Fortunately, Northstar is a veteran of my moods, and came out of the Chipotle across the parking lot with a huge barbacoa burrito that started to fill the void.
More Shen-Van-Igans
The goal for the afternoon was to find a body shop in Baltimore that could fix the damage done by the gas station posts that had entrapped Northstar. Progressive put us through the inquisition, trying desperately to understand what city we were in and where we would be a week from now, and never quite getting it. But they finally gave the okay, warning us that we might have a hard time scheduling the work.
In fact, no shop in Baltimore would even take a look at our van before late July. Northstar tried a local shop in Waynesboro, who graciously offered to try to squeeze us in, but said it would take two weeks to get the parts and at least that long to do the work. How long would we be in Waynesboro?
So, we’ll be living in a dented van until we get back to Arizona. Bring on the duct tape, magic marker, and super glue.
What’s Next?
The rest of the afternoon we tried to figure out the next few weeks’ itinerary. This weekend, we’re flying out to San Diego for my oldest son’s graduation from his medical residency (anesthesia). Next weekend is my brother’s memorial service in Indianapolis. The day after that, we’re meeting my college roommate and his wife in Harpers Ferry for a few days of hiking. Somewhere in all that, we’re trying to keep our AT momentum alive.
Northstar started to feel overwhelmed by all these moving pieces, so we retreated back the BRP and found an empty overlook with stunning views and three bars of Verizon LTE. We didn’t make any decisions, but we had a lot to look at while we pondered. After a colorful sunset, we drove down the road to a legal boondocking site at Reid’s Gap and set up for the night.  We’d considered trying to sneak a boondock at the Humpback Ridge Picnic Area, but neither of us wanted to risk the midnight knock from a ranger.
Is There a Next?
Just before we called it a day, Northstar said her hips and shoulders ached and that she had a sharp headache. We’ve been watching her closely since we pulled the tick out of her scalp last week. But she doesn’t have the rash or other Lyme’s disease symptoms. Plus, we think we got the tick within hours of when it latched on, making it very unlikely the tick transmitted anything evil. More likely, those symptoms mean another Shingles flair up. We'll follow up with a family doctor this weekend.
There are some dark moments along the AT, when it all seems to be falling apart. This was one of them. I’d like to say the hike has been all rainbows and pixie dust, but that’s just not true. I went to sleep wondering if this was the end of it.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665601,"Live Every Day Like It’s Your Last
When trucks started rolling past the van about 5:30 am, I climbed out of bed and drove back to the Humpback Ridge Picnic Area, figuring Northstar would appreciate the quieter location as well as a nearby public restroom.
Later, when I woke her to let her know Gus and I were heading out, she said she felt better than last night but still had some of her symptoms. Still, Gus and I hiked out under a dark cloud, thinking that today’s hike might be our last one on the AT. Hopefully not, but if I’ve learned anything over the past two weeks, it’s to not assume anything about what will happen tomorrow.
Illnesses, van problems, a bad fall, family issues, ticks, snakes, poison ivy… any day can be the last one. But whatever happens next, we know we won’t be on the AT for at least four days. I’m excited to see my kids and celebrate my son’s milestone. My knees and hips are excited to escape the abuse for a few days.
I Have a Plan
If God smiles on us and our hike continues, I at least have a plan for the next few weeks. Overnight, my thinking gelled about our upcoming itinerary. After we get back from San Diego, I think we’ll skip ahead to Front Royal and hike the ~50 miles from there to Harper’s Ferry over three days. Then, we’ll need to leave the trail again for a few days for my brother’s memorial service in Indianapolis, returning to Harpers Ferry just in time to meet my college roommate and his wife.
I’d given them the option of hiking the Shenandoah’s with us, but they’d already arranged their trip around the Harpers Ferry segment and were excited about seeing that section of the AT. That’s fine by me.
The Shennies in the Fall?
After that, we’ll either return to Rockfish Gap and hike the Shenandoah’s or save the Shennies until after I summit Katahdin. I’m leaning toward finishing Virginia right away, but hiking the Shenandoah’s at the peak of fall color could be epic. We’ll need to drive back to Chattanooga to pick up Roux from doggie reform school, and when we do, I hope to drive Skyline Drive and the Blue Ridge Parkway instead of the Interstate Highways.
Then again, drumming up the motivation to hike anything after Katahdin and being away from home for six months might be a challenge. I really don’t want to risk leaving any part of the AT undone.
I think I’ll let www.recreation.gov decide for me. If I can get campground reservations the week after Harpers Ferry, we’ll come back and hike it right away. If not, I’ll wait until the fall, though I’ve heard that Shenandoah National Park gets busy when the trees turn.
An Apology to 20-Somethings
A few days back I wrote a snide comment about 20-somethings being unable to express a thought without using the f-word. That thought occurred to me after overhearing yet another conversation that went something like this:
Guy: Are you filtering the f-ing water?Other Guy: What the f? I just got out my f-ing filter.Guy: F yeah, I f-ing filtered this morning at the f-ing shelter. F.
They aren’t angry. It’s just the way certain hikers converse. They drop f-bombs the way my generation used “man,” or “um.” It’s not like hearing that ruins my day or anything, I just find it jarring and unpleasant. My mom taught me differently. Usually, with a bar of soap.
Well, over the past two days the trail provided a string of articulate 20-somethings who are a credit to their generation, so I apologize. Smokestack, Black Dog, Beard, Siren, Squirt, and Witchdokter – you guys are all right. And meeting them reminded me of others I’ve met along the way. My bad.
What Are All Those Old People Doing Out Here?
But it’s still kind of laughable how awkward some young hikers are with older folks. Rarely will one of them initiate a conversation with me. When I initiate, I can see some of them squirming, wondering why on earth this old guy is talking to me? Like Mousefeathers said out loud back in the Smoky’s, “The guy was, like, 62 or something. What is he even doing out here?”
Maybe They’re Right
In fact, some of us old guys can be a little weird. Today, I met one of my crowd climbing up from Mill Creek, a day hiker who stopped me to ask if I wanted a little trail magic. I had no idea what he had in mind, so the question was a little off-putting. Then he took off his little backpack and pulled out a ziplock baggie with some Halloween-sized candy.
As he handed it to me, he said, “this exemplifies everything that’s wrong with women.” I gave him a questioning look. I’ve long pondered that topic and wondered what insight his many years had bestowed on his gray head. He continued, “Yesterday, I handed a woman a baggie, she took one piece out, and handed the bag back to me.” He gave a huge guffaw at his own story and looked at me for affirmation.
I looked back, waiting for the rest of the story that would answer this great mystery. None was forthcoming. Handing back candy uneaten was the punchline. I looked at my little bag of candy and thought about taking just one and handing it back, but he looked at me so eagerly, I felt I had to say something. So, I replied, “I’m not sure you’ve captured the extent of the problem but thank you for the magic.” That got another guffaw, though I don’t think he got my point.
Just then his phone rang and he took the call, so I pulled a Smokestack and hiked off. For the record, Northstar had a completely different perspective on his comment.
A Wonderfully Unremarkable Day
Other than a remarkable squirrel count, surpassing the number I’d seen over the past 65 days combined, today’s walk was unremarkable. Pleasant, but unremarkable. I made a point to savor every moment as if it was my last AT hike. And enjoy the fact that Gus didn’t chase a single squirrel after two days of wearing his training collar again.
We did see two snakes today, two harmless garter snakes, and we ran over a copperhead while driving back to the BRP yesterday afternoon. But once again, the witch was nowhere to be found. I’m starting to think she might not be the cause.
Berries!
Just as I approached Rockfish Gap, I saw BAM! up ahead leaning to some bushes by the Forest Service trail pavilion. When I got near enough, she looked up and said only one word: “Blackberries.” Specifically, ripe blackberries. No other communication was required. We cleaned them off in no time.
By the time I found Northstar and the van, BAM!, Squirt, Witchdokter, and Siren had also appeared in the parking lot, looking like they needed a ride into Waynesboro. So, we packed them all in and dropped them off at the Chinese All-You-Can-Eat buffet where I’m sure they did some damage. Northstar made some noise about taking me in with them as she’s been on a campaign to fatten me up, but I declined.
Dorothy, We Aren’t in the Woods Anymore
After that, we packed up the van and headed to Baltimore to catch a plane to San Diego. All I can say is about Baltimore is that after two months driving primarily in small towns along the AT, big city traffic is a nightmare. Walking through a crowded airport is worse. So much noise. So many people. So much agitated haste.
Take me back to the woods and the squirming, f-ing 20-somethings.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665657,"Are You a Purist?
I saw a Facebook post the other day where some confused soul needed to know what percent of thru-hikers were “purists.” The post’s comments section did little to answer this ever-so-important question, and soon devolved into name-calling, mostly by worthless slack(pack)ers and other members of the tainted rainbow of off-color blazers. Even the humble-brags offered up by a few self-proclaimed purists did little to settle the issue.
The ATC, LDHA, USOC, NCAA, and REI rulemakers have all failed to adequately define AT hiking purity. Simply letting hikers make up their own standards of purity doesn’t work because the rest of us won’t be able to judge whether someone else’s hike is truly pure. And that simply will not do. The thru hikers of Appalachia need, nay demand, a standardized thru hiking purity litmus test.
I Am The Incident and I Am Here to Help
Fellow AT hikers, I hear you. I am a problem solver. I have conclusively established, once and for all, the definition of a purist thru-hike. I have stepped up as the final arbitor of purity on behalf of all hikers. Who better?
Let me start with my qualifications. First and foremost, I have not yet completed a thru hike. Therefore, as clearly demonstrated by any internet forum comment section, I am the most qualified to render opinions on the matter. My armchair and keyboard have imbued me with knowledge unavailable to those with worn-out shoes and smelly packs.
Second, I am no whites-only blazer. I have blue-, aqua-, yellow-, black-, brown-, platinum-, red-, no-, and bike-blazed parts of the AT. ‘Tis true that I have strayed from the one true trail, but my sins allow me to see the pinnacle of thru-hiking’s mountain of purity with greater clarity, unlike those lofty souls laboring up the holy mountains’ white-blazed path who are buried in tunnels of green and so shrouded in mists of glory.
Purist Thru Hiking Defined. Finally!
Here now is the definitive summary of a “pure” thru hike’s characteristics:
Every Inch. Purists must walk every inch of the official ATC approved trail. And yes, I mean every inch. Without question, if a hiker leaves the trail to dig a cathole, sleep in a shelter, or run from a bear, they must return to the exact point they left it. Preferably, they will place their foot precisely over the outline of their last footprint before continuing north.The following are not valid reasons for leaving the precise AT alignment:Venomous snakes coiled in a striking position direction on the trail. Go fast and hope for the best. The pure have nothing to fear.Same for bears, skunks, porcupines, banjo-playing yokels, or tick-infested overhanging vegetation.Bridge out. If the official bridge is closed or has been swept away by flooding, the purist must still ford the river or cross the freeway on the bridge’s or road’s original alignment. If they are swept downstream by the torrent or carried away on the front grill of a semi, they must go back and try again, taking care to place their foot in the exact spot they left the trail.Tree falls. Never, ever leave the trail to go around a fallen tree. Always climb under it, keeping direct contact with the hallowed official soil of the trail. Failure to do so not only negates purity, it causes untold environmental damage to the surrounding forest.Poorly marked trail sections. When a purist encounters a poorly marked trail, they should send a non-purist scout they trust ahead to ferret out the exact location of the official trail to make sure they do not accidentally step on unholy ground.Crossing the street. In towns like Hot Springs and Damascus, where white blazes are found on only one side of the street, hiking on the other side of the street for any reason is not allowed. If the official sidewalk is closed or blocked, the purist must wait at the blockage for it to open again.Remediating Errors. Should a hiker fail to return to the exact point where they left the trail, they have 24 hours to remedy the error. Failure to do so, invalidates the entire hike. They must start over at Springer to qualify for a pure thru hike.Getting Lost. Purists do not get lost. Any thru-hiker who loses the trail for more than 10 standard hiking strides must start over at the Springer Approach Trail.Stride Length. Long-legged hikers should take care to not take too long of a stride, as that can be considered skipping short portions of the trail.White Blazes. While it is not required, those who do not physically touch each white blaze with the same ungloved hand will receive an asterisk next to their name embroidered on their purity sash, to be awarded upon completion of their thru hike. Tapping blazes with a trekking pole is also impure.Slackpacking is the antithesis of hiking purity, even if one’s slackpack weighs more than an ultralight hiker’s pack, it is the spirit of the thing that counts. Leaving stuff out of a pack you don’t need that day is impure. Unless, you are going ultralight, in which case it is extra pure.Pack Weight. See slackpacking. A purist’s pack must be heavy. But not too heavy, or they’re stupid. Or too light, because that would be cheating. Unless they are an ultralighter, in which case they are automatically pure. Defer to ultralighters in all things. They know best. Note: It may be prudent to independently weigh an ultralighter’s pack with all the stuff they actually carry, as they have been known to fudge their numbers and accidentally leave out a few items before weighing it.Reversing Direction. North is the only pure direction. Hiking south on a northbound thru hike, except to remedy an error of foot placement or as the second part of a yo-yo, is impure. Purists should not even associate with flip-floppers.Beards. Purists must wear unkempt beards. Hairy legs and armpits may be substituted by those unable to grow beards to the required disgusting, food-trapping length. Purists do not trim, groom, or comb out their beards (or leg hair & pits) between Springer and Katahdin. Picking food out of one’s beard with a stick does not count as grooming if one eats whatever they find.Tramilies. Have you really hiked the AT if you don’t have a tramily? Of course not. Two types of tramily are accepted as pure: (1) With Drama, and (2) With More Drama.Assistance. A true purist accepts no food, money, or any other kind of assistance during their hike. This includes trail magic. A purist walks by trail magic with eyes averted while emanating hiker purity. It also includes medical emergencies. A purist would rather die in the woods than borrow a tourniquet from a passing hiker.Rides. A true purist may not ride in any kind of vehicle between Springer and Katahdin.Purists only camp in their own tents or ATC-built shelters. Motels, hostels, homes, and RV’s are verboten for pure purists.Zero Days. Purists take less than five zero days, all of which must be taken directly on the trail in a tent or shelter. Really pure purists do not zero.Approach Trail. Purists must hike the Springer Mountain Approach Trail, passing under the stone archway in Amicolola State Park and touching the plaque on Springer Mountain with the same foot used for their first step through the archway.Katahdin. Purists must carry their full pack with all their camping equipment up Katahdin. In addition, they must do it because “they just don’t feel right without it.” It is NOT weird that they’ve just spent five months preaching to anyone who will listen about the need to lighten their pack by removing everything they don’t need.Documentation. Purists should photo-document or video themselves (with GPS tracking turned on) each time they leave and re-enter the trail.Witnesses. A minimum of two reliable witnesses are required to document thru hiker purity. Anyone self-identifying as hiker trash is not considered reliable. Or safe. Or sober.Southbounders. Those miscreants can do whatever the hell they want.
Post-Modern Purity
A subclassification of purity is also recognized and is called a Post-Modernist Purist Thru-Hike (PMP). The following are allowable for post-modernist purists:
Hostels. Although staying in grimy, noro-infested hostels is preferred, staying in luxury private rooms at hostels, or even quaint, pricy B&B’s, is acceptable for PMP hikers.Motels. Cheap hotels shared with more hikers than legally allowed by local fire codes is preferred. Nice hotels known to have doors that properly lock, beds built after the Eisenhower administration, or working plumbing may invalidate true purist status and trigger post-modernist purity status. If, however, the hiker is “tired” or worried about the weather, then by all means, they may stay in whatever hotel for as many nights as they want without violating their PMP hiker status.Hitchhiking. Hitchhiking is allowable if the driver is drunk or stoned, legally blind, or talking and driving while looking over his shoulder. Exceptions for sober drivers will be made if the PMP hiker rides in the back of a pickup during a rainstorm or if they stand or sit above the truck’s side panels. Alternatively, PMP hikers may take any type of ride if they are tired, in a hurry, or just don’t feel like walking that far.Trail Magic. Of course, accepting trail magic is PMP approved. How could accepting food and supplies you didn’t carry yourself be considered anything but pure? Don’t be ridiculous. Same for running out of food because you expected those stupid trail magic people to stick around long enough for you to get to their feed. Can you believe they didn’t have vegan and gluten-free options? Morons.Zero Days. Zero days have no bearing on PMP purity. Unless a hiker takes too many according to those who’ve seen them do it and are not part their tramily.Ultra-Light Equipment. Ultra-lighters are the vegans of the hiking world. They are imbued with extra sanctity that covers a multitude of other types of impurity. How do you know if someone is an ultralighter? Wait five minutes, they’ll tell you.Stuff that You Like to Do. If you feel like doing it, then it’s okay and does not alter your PMP status. But if other people do it and you don’t, it’s assuredly a PMP violation.Documentation. Simply claiming to be purist, especially if done on social media, is sufficient to prove one’s PMP status. As long as you think you’re pure, and say so publicly, you are.
I have filed papers to form a legal entity to enforce these purity standards. I’m calling it the “Ultra Pure Hike Your Own Real Hike Society” (UPHYORS).  Whenever someone says they’re a purist, just think UPHYORS. You probably already were.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665727,"Getting Out of AT Bubble World
This weekend, Northstar, Gus, and I stepped outside the AT bubble and reentered the real world. Gus only made it as far as the dogsitter’s in Baltimore where, reportedly, he appropriated the bed in their spare room and comes out only to get more stuffed toys to de-squeaker.
Northstar and I made it a little further, flying five hours cross-country to San Diego for a family celebration where, strangely, people call us weird names like Kate and Jon. They also wear clean clothes, shower daily, poop inside, drive everywhere, know what day of the week it is, and wait in long lines everywhere for nearly everything. Several times, I had to stop myself from stepping off the sidewalk and peeing into a bush. Although in my son’s urban neighborhood, that might have made me the exception, as many of the residents seem to do their business directly on the sidewalks. Welcome to California.
Take Me Back to the Woods!
I’ve been on sensory overload since we drove into the outskirts of Baltimore last Friday. So many people. Constant jarring noise, flashing lights, crowds, lines, parking, traffic, merge lanes, semi’s, and more. The first morning at BWI, Northstar said I looked gray and worn. I don’t doubt it, because that’s exactly how I felt, despite having shaved, showered twice, and put on clean clothes.
Which no longer fit, by the way. If I put anything heavier than my reading glasses in my pants pockets, they slide right off. Which also makes me fit right in on the streets near my son’s apartment. I picked up a new pair of Teren travel pants in a smaller size which fit much better than the ones I started out in. If you’re looking for a durable, quick-drying, well designed pair of hiking pants, Teren makes the best ones I’ve ever worn. They’re nice enough to wear to graduation (I did) as well as rugged enough slog through mud and butt-slide down rocky trails (I’ve done that too).
We spent the weekend just hanging with the family. Nathan was honored for his work as Chief Resident and was brutally roasted by his Attending Physician/Mentor, a tradition at UCSD-Scripps graduations. Of course, his best accomplishment was producing the cutest grandchild ever, who spent every waking hour getting cooed at by Northstar. The whole family made it to San Diego and we had enough time for everyone. Perfect.
The Real World's View of the AT
I discovered that most people in the real world don’t care that much about the Appalachian Trail. My family does, partly because I do, but mostly because we’re that kind of people. But nearly everyone else gave me a blank stare if someone introduced me as “He’s hiking the Appalachian Trail.” The most common response was, “Where’s that?” If the conversation got as far as, “How long will that take?”, it ended when I answered that I expected to finish in September. People just can’t fathom hiking for that long and probably thought I was teasing them.
Q & A in the Real World
My family asked lots of questions like, “What have you learned so far? What’s the weirdest person you’ve met? Is the AT what you expected? Are you excited to go back?”
The answer to the first question I’ll keep to myself for now, aside from what I’ve already written in this blog. I had a hard time answering the second question. Almost every AT hiker is a little weird, and none have been over-the-edge weird. I told my family some stories that I’ve already blogged. But I die a little inside every time friends or family ask me questions I’ve already answered in my blog. Which, coincidentally, is part of the answer to the first question.
Hiking the AT has been exactly what I expected. And more. And less. Parts of it are harder than I imagined (mentally, emotionally, socially). Other parts are easier (physically). But overall, I think I came well prepared and have endured well enough. I love the woods as much as I expected to. I appreciate the open meadows and balds more than I imagined. I’m looking forward to experiencing the trail in the middle Atlantic states, and New England even more.
The last question was easiest to answer: Yes. Definitely yes. I’ve had days where I thought I might not be able to hike the next day, days where the hiking was unpleasant, and plenty of days where it seemed like everything was falling apart. But I don’t recall a single day where I didn’t want to get up and hike.
Let's Get Walking
Northstar woke up feeling better the last day I hiked and has improved every day since, so we are definitely returning to the trail. Four delightful days of eating and not walking all day salved both my spirits and soles (a pun, not a typo), but I’m eager to hike again. I can’t wait to get away from the crowds, the noise, the traffic, and all the over-stimulation and just walk in the quiet woods.
I miss my family and will especially miss watching my granddaughter get bigger and more playful every day. But I miss very little else outside the AT bubble.
At least for now.","Hiking Nirvana

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665808,"I’ve Been Everywhere, Man
We live in an amazing world. I watched the sunrise light up the Pacific, got on a plane, flew 3,000 miles to the Atlantic, drove back inland a few hours, and watched the sun set over the Appalachians. Or we would have, if the clouds hadn’t rolled in and started spitting rain on us as soon as we left Baltimore.
Impure Hiking Plans
Last week, I finished walking outside Waynesboro, at the south end of Shenandoah National Park. Today, I started hiking again outside Front Royal, at the north end of the Shenandoahs. For logistical reasons, we decided to skip the Shenandoahs and come back to them next week.
Basically, I have three possible days of hiking between our San Diego trip and our upcoming Indianapolis trip. I’d prefer to not break up the Shenandoahs, but I think I can hike from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry in three days. We’ll hike a few days around Harpers Ferry with friends after the Indy trip, head back to Waynesboro for the Shennies, then back north to wherever we left off with our friends. After that, I hope to be done with flip flopping, backtracking, and yellow blazing.
Rain, Rain, and More Rain
The AT punished me for my impure hiking by sending rain. We arrived at our boondocking site along US522 in a light rain, just hard enough that we had to close all our vents and windows, making for a hot, clammy night in the van. Add that to the trucks air-braking 20 feet in front of us and we had a perfect recipe for a sleepless night. Welcome back to the trail.
According to the forecast, I should expect six more days of rain. I started hiking this morning in a light drizzle, which continued on and off all day. The thick tree canopy caught most of the drizzle, so I didn’t need rain gear, though my clothes were damp. The brush and low branches caught enough rain to make them lean over the trail, making me bend, twist, and dodge in a mostly futile attempt to keep them off my face, arms, and legs. I walked under gray skies, drizzle, and wet branches all day.
Walking Again
Despite the rain, it felt great to be walking again. The first two miles of trail bordered some kind of US government facility bounded by an eight-foot chain link fence topped by three strands of barbed wire. A 15-foot swath inside the fence had been cleared of vegetation mechanically as well as with some kind of defoliant that turned every plant brown. I didn’t see any cameras, but it definitely gave off the “we’re watching you” vibe.
It looked military, but I didn’t see any soldiers or army equipment. I did see an old barn and heard pigs squealing. Pig warfare? Bovine missiles? I have no idea. I started looking it up on the internet but got distracted by a thick patch of ripe blackberries and did a little defoliating of my own. I even put a couple of handfuls in a ziplock bag for Northstar, though they were a little smushed and warm by the time I got back to the van.
A few portions of today’s trail had some of the best walking on the entire AT so far. The trail was well-groomed, smooth, level, shady, and wide. And had blackberries. Goodness. If the entire trail were built like that, it’d be packed with thru-hikers. Fortunately, today’s walk also included some nasty rocks and roots, steep climbs, overhanging poison ivy, overgrown wet vegetation, and mud.
A Miles-on-Trail Day
Mostly, today was a “miles on trail” day. I watched a YouTuber last season named “Energizer” who used that phrase to describe days with no significant geographic features or milestones. On such days, you just log the miles and get on down the trail. The trail didn’t offer much besides miles of long green tunnel, dense underbrush too thick to see through, drizzle, and grey skies.
The trail didn’t even provide much company today. I saw fewer than ten hikers all day, and half of those were day-hikers and runners going the other direction. Have you ever noticed how if hikers (or cars) ahead get a glimpse of you behind them they’ll accelerate and hold you off as long as they can? And then, as soon as you pass them, they totally drop off and disappear, and you never see them again even if you stop for a long break.
Friends, Furry & Otherwise
I got texts from Chopstix and Wheels. They’re two days ahead of me in Harpers Ferry, but will be two weeks ahead of me by the time I go back and finish the Shenandoahs. Alas. I doubt I’ll see them again.
I did share the trail with some wildlife, probably because there were so few hikers. I spotted two black snakes crossing the trail, my first of that species. I also saw two decent-sized box turtles and some deer. I may also have seen a bear drop out of a tree. I caught something black in my peripheral vision that broke a branch and landed with a thud, but I didn’t see or hear it run away after that. I didn’t see enough of it to add it to my bear count though. And I spoke with Early Riser, who said she saw a red fox this morning. Northstar has seen a fox near the trail, but I haven’t yet.
Seeking Quiet Lodging
I logged just over 20 miles today. I’d planned a little less, but when I got to Liberty Lane, the parking area was right next to a steep downhill along US50/17. I didn’t think Northstar would be up for another night of air-braking, so I hiked another half-mile up to a quieter spot along Blue Ridge Mountain Road. We have the parking lot to ourselves, and our fingers are crossed.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665861,"A Quiet Night 
We made the right call on parking spots last night. Other than the poison ivy garden on all four sides, the site was perfect. We couldn’t hear the highway, caught a little cooling breeze in the evening, and slept like babies. Do babies snore? I can’t remember. If so, we definitely slept like them.
I got out early and had the trail to myself as usual. Gus stayed with Northstar because of the rain forecast but wasn’t happy about it. The last time I looked, he was sitting in the front seat with his nose pressed up against the window. Northstar said he barely moved all morning.
Poison Ivy, My New Friend
As I headed up the first climb of the day, I saw a notice from the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club that they were spraying to kill some invasive plants and that we should not eat any plants with blue dye on them. My first thought was to wonder if they really expected that to happen. My second was to wonder if I could convince them to overspray and knock out some of the poison ivy.
And that got me wondering if poison ivy has some useful role in the ecosystem. Well, according to the infallible internet, birds and deer eat poison ivy fruit. Who knew it had fruit? Also, its leaves are used to make medicine, including one to treat itchy skin disorders. Hmm, but I thought… never mind. Speaking of the internet, thank you to several of you who pointed out that the fenced-in area I saw yesterday was a Smithsonian Biological Research Station. Supposedly.
The Rollercoaster
Today’s hike had two big milestones. The first was “The Rollercoaster,” a 14-mile stretch with 13 climbs (depending on how you count) and descents that intimidates a lot of thru-hikers. But none of the climbs are bigger than 600 feet and there’s only 4,600 feet of total climbing over the entire section. Anyone who’s hiked from Springer Mountain has done many tougher, longer, steeper, higher climbs.
That’s not to say the Rollercoaster was easy. The rain, the slick pointy rocks, the lack of views, and a few steep spots had their challenges. But it just wasn’t anything we hadn’t seen or done before.
Still, its reputation can mess with your head. On the second climb of the day, I passed a young man struggling with the climb. He moaned, cussed, and groaned with every step, and said he didn’t know if he could make it. I asked if he needed anything, but that just initiated another stream of invective. Honestly, he seemed to enjoy the misery and the prospect of the gruesome story he’d no doubt tell when he finished.
A Thousand Miles
Just after the third hill of the Rollercoaster I walked up to the 1,000-mile marker. A thousand miles is huge. Or would be if I had completed the 107.9 miles in the Shenandoahs before I got there. My impending flip flop took some of the shine off reaching the 1,000-mile post, but didn’t stop me from snapping a few pictures with Retro and Scout, a father-son duo doing their annual week-long section hike.
Seconds after hiking on from our photoshoot, the rain really started coming down. It had drizzled on and off all morning and was forecasted to hold off the serious stuff until early afternoon. Nope. I was drenched in minutes.
I had just started thinking about hiking another eight miles to the Blackburn Trail Center, but the harder rain and the increasingly rocky trail put an end to those dreams. I’d gotten permission to boondock in the Bear’s Den Hostel parking lot and walked in there soaked through and shivering, ready for a change of clothes and a hot meal, and happy to have a long afternoon looking out the van door at the rain.
Hike Naked Day
As I sat in the van, I realized that today was Hike Naked Day (summer solstice). I think the cold rain put a stop to that, fortunately, given that everyone I saw was an old man and/or overweight.
I’ve been doing field work in lonely places for 40+ years and have stumbled across more than my share of nudists. Once, while doing a study on desert wash north of Phoenix, I walked into a nudist camp volleyball court. From a distance, I absent-mindedly thought it was a bunch of retirees in tan jumpsuits. As I got closer, I realized they were quite tan (very uniformly, and all-over), but weren’t wearing jumpsuits. Whatever they were wearing, it didn’t fit like it did when they were younger.
Based on years of similar experiences, I developed what I call “The Fundamental Law of Naked People in the Wilderness.” Imagine the last person you’d want to see naked. Your elderly dentist (that actually happened). Your kid’s Vice Principal. Your Great Aunt Edna with the skin condition. Mitch McConnell. Your boss. That’s pretty much who you’ll see out there letting their freedom flag fly. Never fails.
The Ever-Changing Plan
Tomorrow was supposed to be another 20-miler, but with the rain forecast, I’m thinking of lopping off the last six miles because rain hiking really slows me down and I want to get an early start on the 8-hour drive to Indy. Plus, after a “meh” experience at the 1,000-mile marker, I think I’d like to walk into Harpers Ferry after really finishing Virginia.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665875,"I Hear the Drizzle of the Rain
Rain tapped on the roof of the van all night, just to remind me I’d be getting wet again tomorrow. It was still out there during my breakfast, but switched to tapping on my head the second I stepped out the door. Gus climbed out of the van with me, took one hard look at the sky, and climbed right back in.
I’ve never had a day on the AT yet where I didn’t feel like hiking. Every day so far, I’ve woken up excited to get my miles and to see what I will see. But today I could empathize with Gus. The thought of walking for a third day in a row in the rain, with no views and lots of slippery rocks, almost made me climb back in bed. Almost. But sunny day hikers don’t get to Maine, so I geared up and headed out, hopeful that the trail had something pleasant in store for me.
Rain Days and Thursdays Always Get Me Down
Another hiker walked out of the hostel as I walked up the Bear’s Den driveway toward the blue blaze trail back to the AT, but he was in no mood for conversation. Northstar and I had walked up to the hostel last night and gotten the same vibe from everyone in there except from Glen, the caretaker. A hostile hostel. After a couple of one-word answers from the grumpy hiker, I got the message and moved on. Just as well. I’d gotten a couple of work emails overnight that I needed to pointlessly obsess over for hours.
The Wiz
Which I did as I worked my way up the last few bumps of the Rollercoaster. Fortunately, at the top of the second climb I passed a young man hiking alone. He pulled aside to let me pass and I got a friendly hello in response to mine. And then a thoughtful answer to one of standard hiking questions, a rare treatment from a younger hiker. And then he sped up a bit to match my pace and we had the longest trail conversation I’ve had since Buff went home after the Smokies.
Wiz and I talked gear (he worked at REI and hikes with an umbrella), pack weight (light but not ridiculous), blue blazing (getting less purist as the miles add up, we both took the Campbell Creek blue blaze), mileage (he’s doing 20’s), bear encounters (I won that one), more about gear (water filters mostly, he likes the Platypus, I like my Be Free), Virginia Blues (he thinks it’s the length of the state, but he’s wrong), Vanlife (the pros and cons), the Rollercoaster (overhyped, but not easy), best section (Grayson Highlands), why we’re hiking (doing hard things is healthy), tramilies (his is spread out over 200 miles now), and just about everything else trail related. He was a walking encyclopedia of trail information.
We walked right out of the Rollercoaster and didn’t even notice until we were a mile down the trail. Somewhere in there, a hiker flew past us in a blur and Wiz said, “He’s definitely done a previous thru hiker. Look at his pack. And you don’t get that pace until you’ve hiked a couple thousand miles.”
Hard Worn Trail
Sure enough, when we stopped for lunch at the David Lesser Memorial Shelter, we met the guy, and he told us he’d done the Continental Divide Trail last year. He said he averages about 35 miles a day and 4 mph (walking speed). I got the same “the Camino is not a real hiking trail” response I got from Pay It Forward, the last triple crowner I met a month ago. But he disagreed with Pay It Forward, saying the AT is much more physically demanding than the CDT because of the AT's constant up and down.
Milestones
Wiz and his friend Sam, who caught up just as we left the Lesser Shelter, planned to hike all the way to Harpers Ferry today. I thought about hiking on with them, as the miles fly by when I have someone to talk to. But I'd had enough rain walking and decided to stop at Keys Gap to get started on what would likely be a rainy drive to Indianapolis. Also, I want the walk into Harpers Ferry to be more of a celebration.
I passed the Virginia/West Virginia border sign just before I met Wiz. Just like seeing the 1,000-mile marker yesterday, the milestone lost some of its luster for me, knowing that I still had 108 miles of trail left to hike in the Shenandoahs. So, I decided I’d rather save the thrill of crossing the Shenandoah River Bridge and walking up the hill to the ATC headquarters in Harpers Ferry for when I’m really done with Virginia.
BreakTime
Northstar pulled up just after I got to Keys Gap at 12:30. She had the van all gassed up and ready for an 8-hour drive. Unlike the last time we got pulled off the trail, this time we both know we’ll be back. See you in a few days.

My flippity-floppity thru hike continues, though I’m starting to feel like that stripe-shirted, bespeckled Waldo cartoon character. Since last Thursday, we’ve been in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and all those states once again in reverse order. Plus, now that we’re back on the AT, I feel like every time we make a left turn, we leave Virginia for Maryland or West Virginia, or vice versa. It’s exhausting trying to figure out where we are at any given moment.
Lyle Said it Best
More likely, we’re exhausted from driving out to and attending my brother’s memorial service last weekend. Thanks to all of you who passed along your condolences, kind words, and prayers. Most of the family made the trip out to Indianapolis, setting up the paradox of contradictory emotions that Lyle Lovett sang about in “Since the Last Time.”
I went to a funeral
Lord, it made me happy
Seeing all those people that I ain’t seen Since the last time somebody died
I talked to more people in six hours last weekend than I’d spoken to over the past two months. Many of the folks attending the funeral had heard I was hiking the AT and politely asked how it was going. But if I answered, almost none of them had any context to really grasp what they heard. Hiking miles, rain, climbs, rocks, and white blazes mean almost nothing to most people in pancake-flat Indiana, particularly in light of why we’d all gathered there.
Getting Back to AT Mode
Frankly, even Northstar and I were yanked so hard out of AT-mode by the trip, none of those things meant much to us either. Fortunately, as we drove back east again and had time to process some of our thoughts and feelings, we started to think about the trail again. But I suspect it might take a few more weeks of walking to finish processing. About the time we started driving up and down the Appalachian foothills in eastern Ohio, thoughts about the logistics of where we’d be hiking and camping next started crowding out everything else.
New Hiking Partners
This morning, we skipped a few miles ahead of where I stopped last week and started hiking north from the Harpers Ferry (WV) railroad depot. We stopped at Gathland (MD) State Park, making it a short day for me, but a long enough day for my college roommate Dan (no trail name yet) who drove out from Detroit to hike with me for a few days. His wife Beth (also no trail name) went to high school with Northstar and came along too.
Dan and his wife Beth are the kind of people who you just pick right up where you left off, even if the last time you crossed paths was four years ago. COVID travel restrictions kept us apart for a few years, and then last year I got COVID just before we were supposed to meet for a week in Glacier National Park.
Hiking Out of Harpers Ferry
The five of us hiked over the railroad bridge out of the Harpers Ferry and onto the C&O Canal Path along the Potomac. Dan, Gus, and I continued north up the trail past Weverton Cliffs, while Northstar and Beth headed back to Harpers Ferry to take in some history (a.k.a., shopping). Two months ago, a 10-mile day would have been plenty for me too. Today, I gladly traded a “short” day for Dan’s company.
I have no idea what flora and fauna we may have passed today, as we were deep in conversation the entire time. For all I know, we walked through a sleuth of dancing bears and blindly stepped over a dozen vipers. I vaguely remember a climb, humidity, stopping at the luxurious Ed Garvey Shelter (a loft, windows, benches, and a back deck) for lunch, more humidity, and then being surprised when I saw the van sitting in a parking area near the trail.
How Can the Time Go So Fast If We're Going So Slow?
Apparently, we didn’t set any speed records, as our wives had been waiting for us in Gathland State Park for an hour, and had been asking hikers if they’d seen “seen two elderly hikers with a brown dog.” Consensus from the hiking crowd was that the two old guys were “relaxing” along the trail.
We walked fast enough to get inside the van before the thunderstorms hit. I don’t we’ll be so fortunate tomorrow. Nor do I think we’ll go any faster than “relaxing.”
It’s nice to be back. This time, I hope to stay on trail until we summit Katahdin, though we have a bit more flippity-flopping planned for the next week.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666163,"It Gets Easier
If you walk all day, every day for two months you get better at walking. Who knew? For me, this was a short day.
Dan has run 15 marathons, at least one half-Ironman triathlon I know of (possibly more), I don’t know how many half-marathons and sprint triathlons, and two rim-to-rim Grand Canyon hikes (one with a return rim-to-rim). But he’d had enough trail walking by the time we got to the Washington Monument State Park, so we called it a day and went in search of something cold and bubbly.
A Fresh Look
I really enjoyed seeing the AT through his eyes for two days. Trail blazes, blue blazes, trail names, thru-hikers, and shelters have all become everyday normal to me. But to Dan, it was as exciting as it was to me the first time I walked the trail. I wish I could have shown him a bear, but we talked so much, I’m sure we scared off any wildlife within a quarter mile of the trail.
Slackers
At our relaxed pace, we didn’t pass any thru hikers, but we met a busload of them slacking south to Harpers Ferry. We chatted with V6 and Optimus at the White Rocks viewpoint, hearing their trail name stories and comparing opinions about the Rollercoaster while we ate an early lunch. As we packed up to leave, V6 looked at Gus and said, “I think your dog is eating poison ivy.”
After a moment of panic, I determined that he probably ate the plant right next to some poison ivy, but regardless, he’ll get a sudsy chin bath when we get back to the van. He hasn’t shown any signs of poison ivy rashes on the AT so far, even though I know he’s occasionally gotten into it. But I’ve read that urishiol (poison ivy’s bad juju) can stick to dog fur and rub off on humans. His beard needs a wash anyway. I have no idea what would happen if he ate some.
A few minutes later, we saw Hoot-y-who & Cheesecake coming south with nearly empty packs. I’d last seen them at the VA60 pull out near Buena Vista (mile 809). I’d neglected to get Hoot-y-who’s trail name that time, even though we’d previously met even further south. So today I made sure to ask. She said it, spelled it out, and I repeated it into a quick video so I wouldn’t forget. I’ve got horrible short-term memory, especially for names.
Rollercoaster Recap
I’ve talked to several thru hikers about their experience on the Rollercoaster. Apparently, I’m alone in my opinion that it’s been over-hyped. One hiker said he thought it was the hardest day on the entire trail so far. Another said she broke down and cried on the last climb. Still another said that while it wasn’t the hardest day yet, it was one of the top three. It sure wasn’t for me. Go figure.
Measure Twice
After we left the slackpackers, I noticed Dan starting to fade, so I pulled out the FarOut app and checked the mileage to the Washington Monument, which was just after the next road crossing. We had less than two miles to go, which revived Dan enough to make him charge off into the woods.
Unfortunately, I misread the map. I didn’t realize it until we got to Old National Pike, which I mistook for the Washington Monument Road, which is another 1.5 miles further. Plus, another 0.6 miles to the monument itself where our wives planned to meet us. Oops. Poor Dan. I think I heard his heart break when I told him he had another two miles to go. Extra miles are the worst.
Antietam’s Ghosts
But we survived the extra mileage and walked up the hill to the monument just as our wives pulled up in the shuttle vehicles. They’d spent the morning touring Antietam battle sites and came armed with tons of information about the Civil War. Antietam was the bloodiest battle in American history, with 22,740 casualties in just a few days of fighting, more than half in the first hours of fighting. Something like 60% of the Confederate troops were lost in the first onslaught.
Dan and I had sensed ghosts of soldiers all morning. The woods still faintly echo musket shots, cannon blasts, and battle cries. It takes no effort to imagine blue and gray soldiers moving silently through the dark woods or taking aim at each other from behind trees and rocks. Parts of the woods are so thick entire battalions could probably pass hundreds of yards away without being seen. I wonder how many soldiers crawled off battlefields and died quietly in the woods from their wounds without ever being found?
The Original Washington Monument
We all hiked the short path up to the Washington Monument, a 25-foot high stone tower built decades before the more famous one on the Capitol Mall in Washington, D.C. Maryland’s monument tower has been rebuilt and restored several times. Northstar recalls visiting as a child but remembers it as a pile of rock rubble.
Today, we climbed the circular stone stairs to the lookout platform and watched an approaching rainstorm blanket the valley to the northwest. When the storm started sending lightning bolts, we scurried back down, reaching the van just as the first raindrops hit. Another reason to quit early.
Goodbyes
After a shower, we gathered for one last dinner at Bulls & Bears in Hagerstown, where we told stories and laughed until we cried. We’ll miss our friends, but it’s time to get serious about making some miles.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666201,"A Pleasant Walk
Siri’s route back to the trail this morning took us down Pleasant Walk Road, which I took as a good omen. Northstar was shocked and a little bit jealous. Siri usually routes her on streets like Pot Hole Trail, End of the World Drive, or Devil’s Cliff End. What can I say? Maps like me.
Hiking My Own Hike
I had a great time with Dan, but after I few miles of walking by myself this morning a feeling of overwhelming happiness rolled over me. Walking alone is my gig.
I start when I want (early), set my own pace (fast in the mornings, slower in the afternoon), rest when I’m tired (but never before or during a climb), stop whenever something interests me (flowers mostly), and quit when I decide I’m done. I talk to myself, Gus, or the video recorder frequently, which would be annoying if I had a hiking partner.
I’ve come to love my rhythms of boondocking at trailheads, hiking out early from the van while Northstar snoozes, carrying a light pack with just my lunch and my survival gear, not worrying about resupply or finding shuttles into town, sleeping warm and dry (or air conditioned), writing on my laptop instead of on my phone, and hanging out with Northstar all evening.
I don’t think I could do the tramily thing now. Our two-person tramily is all I want when camping, and my one-person/one-dog tramily is all I want on the trail. Thinking back on the few times I’ve had daily hiking companions, I found myself either hurrying to keep up or lagging so others could catch up.
Life is good.
Trail Schizophrenia
Both the trail and the weather were bipolar today. The forecast called for clouds but no rain. So, of course, it was rainy with patches of blue sky when I set out. Then the serious clouds rolled in and it stopped raining. Followed by puffy clouds and bright sun with a pleasant breeze. And more clouds and some rain. This continued all day.
The trail did the same thing. I think I walked on the very best groomed and designed trail today. And possibly the worst. Dan’s friend had warned him that the trail in Maryland was brutally rocky, but we had nothing but perfect walking conditions. I was busy rhapsodizing about the perfect trail on a video and walked right into a mile of pointy boulder hopping. And then right back out.
Utility Corridors
Speaking of contradictions, has anyone else noticed that the “disturbed” utility corridors have some of the best, most unusual flora and fauna? I see the most deer in them, and not coincidentally, the most berries. They also have some of the best views, aside from the power lines, that is.
I often meet hikers stopped on the edge of a utility clearing enjoying the sun, the flowers, and the view. I wonder if anyone has ever done an ecological study of the biodiversity in manmade clearings in forests compared to the adjacent forest?
Roadway Crossings
As much as I love the utility corridors, I don’t love road crossings. Most are harmless enough, with just two lonely lanes running through the woods. Gus and I cross those with barely a concern. Others, like VA7 at Snickers Gap, feel like the championship level of Donkey Kong. And not in a good way.
Regardless of how anyone feels about the crossing hazards, we have to agree that the AT is not a true wilderness trail. Aside from the Smoky’s and the 100-mile wilderness, we rarely go a day without at least one road crossing.
Crossing I-70 at mile 1048.8 was no exception. The trail crosses a small, paved road, goes directly between two houses along the edge of their mowed side yards, before dropping down a little hill and crossing the freeway on a pedestrian bridge covered in chain link fence. Once off the chain link tunnel/bridge, the trail follows the Interstate for a quarter mile before crossing under another highway. That section of trail is loud, fumey, and unsettling.
Thru Hiker Shenanigans
About halfway through the day, I stopped to let Gus drink from a small stream. Two guys sat by the stream surrounded by six backpacks. They wore long chin beards, black pants held up by cloth suspenders, white shirts, and straw hats. Amish?
They smiled at me as Gus drank his fill and I said, “You guys carry more packs that most people.” One guy chuckled. The other looked very serious and gave me a sincere explanation that the rest of their family was down at the spring getting water. I nodded just as seriously and said, “Ah, that makes way more sense.” The other guy laughed more, but the serious guy looked satisfied. Mission accomplished.
A few minutes later I saw some women walking up the blue blaze trail in long-sleeved, floor-length dresses and white bonnets. Yup, definitely Amish. Interestingly, their backpacks were all modern, lightweight designs. And we didn’t see any horse and buggies at the trailhead.
Shortly after that, I saw Hoot-y-who and Cheesecake ahead of me. I’d made a special point of remembering her name, so I called out, “Good morning, Hoot-ananny!” She gave me a funny look, and replied, “Hoot-y-who.” Right. It sucks to get old and lose the little short-term memory I started with.
Phantom Pain and Itchies
At least once a day I have a hike-ending mysterious injury. I’ll be walking along and suddenly get a searing pain in my foot, knee, shin, hip, ankle, thumb, or whatever. Clearly, I’ve broken a bone. As I get lost in thought about how I’ll get help, find an ER, and recuperate in time to return to the trail, I realize that the pain is gone. What is that?
I get the same thing every time I see poison ivy or a tick. I immediately start itching somewhere, usually just out of reach. Oddly, I can’t see any rash, bumps, or any other signs of irritation, but it can’t be anything but the worst. Until it mysteriously disappears, usually just about the time I’ve broken a bone in my foot.
Wrapping Up
Today’s plan was to meet at Raven Rock Road, six miles south of the Pennsylvania border. A part of me really wanted to finish Maryland today, but we have a better plan. More on that plan next week. Also, quitting a little early gave us time to drive back to Rockfish Gap near Waynesboro, VA.
Tomorrow, I start the Shenandoahs, where we left off before the San Diego trip.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666242,"Backsliding
We left Maryland just shy of the Pennsylvania border and headed back to Virginia to pick up 109 miles through Shenandoah National Park. Northstar got more and more depressed as we drove south, finally admitting that it felt like we were losing ground. Regressing. Slipping down the mountain.
I had the same feeling, but I knew we’d made the right decision. As bad as going back felt now, it could only be worse if we waited until after Katahdin. Mustering up the will power to pick up those missing miles after “finishing” in Maine might be more than I could do. Northstar is “all-in” on this adventure, but that might be a hard sell even for her.
The Plan
We hope to finish the Shenandoahs in six days. We didn’t have a lot of flexibility because the Park strictly enforces their no boondocking policy. I read reports that rangers patrol the likely parking spots at sunset. But I was able to get campground reservations for all but one night. We’ll need to get a walk-up spot for that night. Given that our “missing” night is in the middle of a holiday weekend, that might be a challenge.
Originally, I’d planned to be at least halfway through Pennsylvania by July 4. But life intervened and we’re two or three weeks behind, completely eating up the time I got back by getting out of my Alaska commitment. But at least we feel like we’re getting back on track now.
A Gift from Canada
The Canadian wildfire smoke was just blowing in when we set up on the ridge above Rockfish Gap, making for a beautiful red sunset. Our parking spot next to an abandoned motel offered a great view, but wasn’t quite as lonely as we had hoped.
A dozen cars came and went before sunset, all of which seemed to be driven by slightly creepy old guys. But they left us alone, disappeared before dark, and didn’t reappear during the night. The smoke hung around all night, creating an other-worldly orange sunrise. Despite the air quality warnings, I rarely smelled the smoke and didn’t notice any trouble breathing, even on the steepest climbs.
Heading Into the Mountains
Walking out of Rockfish Gap in the morning, I felt as if I were finally back to thru-hiking after nearly a month of planned and unplanned interruptions, obligations, course corrections, and logistical accommodations. The last three weeks seemed like a series of section hikes. I’m sure hiking across the Pennsylvania border next week will feel even more like I’m back to thru hiking.
The climb out of Rockfish Gap greeted me with a face-full of spider webs, letting me know I was the first one out this morning. Gus and I left early to beat the heat, mostly because I discovered that the van was out of drinking water. We managed to gather two liters, which would need to get us eight miles to the first reliable spring. In fact, all the rain over the last two weeks gave us plenty of dog-worthy options not on the map.
The Shenandoah Hit Parade
We hit all the highlights. Gus insisted we take his picture at Beagle Gap, saying that it’s important to recognize the “lesser” dog breeds occasionally. His words, not mine. I tried out the steel tractor seats at the top of Bear Den Mountain. The seats were fine, though both left disappointed at the lack of a bear den. In fact, despite numerous posted warnings, Day One in the Shenandoahs was completely bare of bears.
What we lacked in bears, we made up for in deer and rabbits. We saw so many, we gave up counting. During our lunch break, a six-point buck walked out of the woods, between two parked cars, and strutted across the parking lot not 25 feet away from Gus. I called to the buck as he re-entered the woods and he turned around and came right back out. That was a little more than Gus could take, so he barked the buck back into the woods, but was incensed to see him 50 feet up the trail after we finished our break.
I also came up with a new way to pass the time. I am not a soft-footed hiker - I clump my feet, breath like an old man walking uphill, and clack my poles on rocks. Yet I still manage to walk up behind slower hikers, getting close enough to tap them on the shoulder before they notice I’m there.
Not that I actually touch them. I just walk “silently” behind them until they look over their shoulder. At which point, many of them jump and let out a little scream. I think I’ll keep doing this until someone shoots me. Or punches me…the Shenandoah “hit” parade.
The LONG Green Tunnel
I think I felt my first hint of being tired of the long green tunnel this morning. But it could have been the humidity. Without the sun to dry me off, sweat drenched my clothes. Or possibly the smoke. Every time I topped a peak or broke out of the woods at an overlook, smokey haze buried the view.
These woods are jungle-like, offering no line of sight further than a hundred feet and crowding the trail with overhanging branches and lush verdant underbrush. Despite the constant bird calls, I only catch fleeting glimpses of birds in flight, or sometimes just their shadows, which disappear by the time I look. The green foliage radiates humidity, amplifying the discomfort of the already moist air. Ivy twines around nearly every woody trunk and branch, adding even more leaves to the thick cover.
If not for the trail, I would not be here. I would not venture into these woods, where I can’t see my feet and every other plant seems to look like poison ivy. If I veered off the trail, I doubt I’d re-emerge unscathed. I’d be eaten by bugs. Or worse. For a place with so much biodiversity, everything looks the same. For those who walk off trail, how do they mark and hold a direction in the face of all the uniform green?
I loved the woods in winter and spring, and I love the trail through the summer woods, but I do not love the thick jungle of latent green that wants to cover and bury every thing that is not green.
And yet, the jungle is shady and cool. Every plant exhales oxygen for me to inhale. I walk out of the tunnel into the hazy sunshine and am relieved, hot, and ready for more of the green tunnel.
A Face from the Past
I walked past Mudbug this morning. I’d wondered if I’d see anyone from my original hiking bubble in the Shenandoahs. I hadn’t seen Mudbug since the descent into Fontana two months ago when he was hiking with Happy Feet and another guy. Instagram tells me that Happy Feet moved on and just did a 30-mile day. Mudbug said he’d been moving slowly due to foot issues.
Surprisingly, even though we’d only talked once or twice back in April, we recognized each other right away. Oddly, he heard that my brother had passed. And that I’d left the trail. For being so isolated, news (both fake and real) travels fast on the AT.
We Like the Shenandoahs
So far, I’m loving the Shenandoahs. I mostly had the trail to myself. The trail was quiet, despite the proximity of Skyline Drive, and was very well maintained. Except for the smoke, the occasional views would have been spectacular.
As I sat under a shady tree eating my lunch at an overlook, with Gus napping in my lap, I thought “This is how I’m spending my summer.” I walk in the woods, get great exercise, see cool stuff, rarely have to wash or bathe, and avoid seeing almost every unpleasant person I’ve ever known. I hang with Northstar morning and night. What could be better?
Miscellaneous Thoughts
I started a new audiobook – Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. I pulled it out on a long climb through the long green tunnel. So far, an excellent read. Or listen.Does it bother you that the word “Wordle” has six letters?I can smell Day Hikers well before I see them. They smell like perfume, shampoo, and detergent. I do not.I got to our pick-up point about ½-hour early and saw that Northstar was still in Waynesboro, so I hiked another 1.8 miles to Blackrock Gap, making it a 20-mile day.
It’s really good to be back.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666314,"The Real Reason We Love Blackberries
What’s the best part of eating blackberries along the trail? Their tasty sweetness? Getting free calories? Letting Mother Nature provide sustenance? Adding nutrients to our bland hiker’s diet? Nope. The best part is the little seeds that get stuck in your teeth. They provide hours of entertainment. First while trying to get them out, and then again while crunching them once they break free.
Shenandoahs Day 2: Gus Gets a Day Off
Northstar dropped me off at Blackrock Gap at 7:30, pretty early for her. She had plans to drive up to Lewis Mountain Campground to snag a walk-up camp site. The Ranger at Loft Mountain told her that it might fill up early due to the holiday weekend. But Gus convinced her that a nap would be a better use of her time and she conked out.
When I pulled out Gus’ training collar this morning, he took one look and crawled back in bed and dug himself under the covers. He said he’d had four consecutive days of hiking, including yesterday’s 20-miler, and deserved a day off.
By the time we’d driven to Blackrock Gap, he’d changed his mind, but it had started drizzling. Neither of us want to sleep with or smell a wet dog, so he stays with Northstar on rainy days. I’m pretty sure the nap was his revenge for being left behind.
The Plan
I had two main goals today: (1) Eat a Wayside smash burger, and (2) Pass the 900-mile marker. We all know what the 900-mile marker means, and most of us have eaten a smash burger, but unless you’ve driven Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park, you may have never heard of a Wayside.
Waysides
Waysides are small restaurants run by a Park Service Concession with a reputation for overpriced, relatively unhealthy, delicious food. Everything I’d read before leaving Springer led me to believe that I could eat nearly every meal in the Shenandoahs at one of the many Waysides located just off the trail. Grim reality shattered my dreams of hot, greasy breakfasts, daily smash burgers with blackberry milkshake chasers, and something even more caloric for dinner.
First of all, only a few Waysides are found along the 100-mile Skyline Drive, and only one in the first 50 miles. Second, some of them, including the one I’d planned to visit today, are located about a mile off trail and require a steep detour climb. Or a blue blaze hike along Skyline Drive which cuts off a 1.5-mile loop of the AT that has one of the better vistas in the Park. Talk about a bitter choice.
Blue Blazing
Not really. I walked the road, recalling Smokestack’s advice to skip the entire trail in the Shenandoahs in favor of the road, which has much better views and smoother grades. Or at least it might on sunny, non-hazy, non-Canadian smoke days. I can’t really say for sure.
I cruised into the Loft Mountain Wayside just in time for second breakfast. Except that, unlike the adjacent gift shop, the Wayside grill didn’t open until 11:00 am. Well, I’d already ruined my previously purist thru hike by walking Skyline Drive for a mile, so I might as well sit around for an hour waiting to be fed. Plus, the drizzle hadn’t let up, and they let me sit at one of the empty tables, though my pack and poles had to wait outside.
Smash Burgers and Blackberry Shakes
Northstar cruised by just in time to share a smash burger (as delicious as it sounds), fries (meh), and ONE sip of my blackberry shake (no seeds, unfortunately). Northstar said she’d seen lots of backpackers walking the road. I’m guessing more than one purist has lost their purity sash in the Shenadoahs. It has a very long green tunnel and the road walks are very tempting.
I don’t know if the nearly 2,000 calories, the smoke-laden drizzle, or the nearly 900 miles of hiking brought me clarity, but after I returned to the trail the lightbulbs suddenly started going off.
Lightbulb #1: Beyond PUDs
Pointless ups and downs (PUDs) are a hallmark of the AT. Any tough climb that doesn’t quite reach the summit or that has no vista that makes the climb worthwhile is a PUD. The same for random descents in the middle of a long climb that serve no purpose except to lengthen the ascent.
As I climbed yet another PUD, I realized I really don’t mind PUDs. Mind you, I prefer a view and reaching the summit, but whatever. I’ll walk whatever trail section that is front of me. Unless there’s a blue blaze that leads to another blackberry milkshake.
Lightbulb #2: The Incident Gets Grumpy
I can get grumpy. Stupidly grumpy. I admit it. Mostly, I get hangry when my blood sugar drops too low or I get overtired, but those aren’t the only times I’m a jerk. I need to learn to recognize the warning signs. Like letting little stuff bother me. Or when I start muttering to myself or using hiker trash vocabulary. I must fix this by eating, napping, and mostly shutting up. Sorry, Northstar. Sorry, family.
Lightbulb #3: I Like My Hike
I really like walking the AT with Gus, meeting Northstar at night, living in the van, having good food, eating cold yogurt and fresh berries on my morning oatmeal, drinking my chai tea in a good ceramic mug before I set out for the day, wearing dry clothes, hanging with Northstar in the afternoons and evening, keeping the dog dry, and sleeping in a cushy bed. I love walking in the woods, having my afternoons to write, and doing my writing on my laptop rather than on my iPhone while lying in my tent.
For any haters out there who think that I’m not really thru hiking, your opinion just doesn’t matter that much to me. After a thousand miles on the trail, I’ve finally walked into my comfort zone. I have a sweet gig and I love it.
Lightbulb #4: Smooth Trails are the Best
The Shenandoahs have the best designed and groomed trails I’ve walked so far. Smooth, rockless trails that follow the contours make me happy. Why isn’t the whole trail more like this?
Lightbulb #5: Mileage Markers are Getting Less Meaningful
I passed the 900-mile mark on the descent into Simmons Gap. Nine hundred miles is a long, long way, but I just wasn’t as excited about seeing the marker as I had been for previous milestones. Maybe passing the 1000-mile marker last week took some of the oomph out of 900 miles. Maybe I’m getting to the point where 500-mile increments will be how I measure progress.
Trail’s End
All that thinking must have wore me out. I’d thought about pushing for another 20-miler today, but when Northstar texted that she’d gotten us spots for the next two nights at Lewis Mountain Campground, I called it at Simmons Gap. From Lewis Mountain, I can hike south back to Simmons Gap tomorrow and then north to Skyland Resort the next day, and Northstar won’t have to drive anywhere to drop me off. She can sleep in three days in a row.
I sat down against a tree by the road until black ants and little green spiders started crawling all over me and I relocated to lie down on some pavement on a side road. I must have drifted off but awoke when a doe and fawn walked out of the woods are started huffing at me. That was a first. Awakened by a deer.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666342,"Humidity
East Coast humidity takes a toll on this Arizona boy. The forecast called for rain, which led me to leave Gus with Northstar, but I didn’t feel a single rain drop all day. But after two hours of climbing my clothes were as wet as if I’d walked in a downpour all day. A salty downpour. A salty, smelly downpour.
By mid-day, the combination of soggy pants and salt build-up on my thighs led to some uncomfortable chaffing. Which is why I carry body glide in my first aid kit. It might be the only thing I’ll actually use in that kit. Hopefully.
How Humid Was It?
My pants got so soaked with sweat I had to put my phone in a ziplock bag so the touch screen wouldn’t be too slimy to sense my wet, sweaty fingers. I’d pull out my reading glasses to look at the map app and they’d be completely fogged over. And I didn’t have a single dry thing to wipe them off. Even my ears got so sweaty, my ear buds kept sliding out. I didn’t even know that ears sweat.
And the good news is that everyone assures me that Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York will be worse. I grew up in upstate New York and my grandparents lived in northern New Jersey. I know what’s coming but am still in denial. My only comfort is that Arizona’s 110F dry heat would be worse. It is worse, right?
Where are the Bears?
Today’s tour of the Shenandoahs was another episode of the long green tunnel, with no views due to fog, low clouds, haze, and smoke. My feet loved the well-groomed, smooth trail, but the rest of me wanted some distraction besides the dozens of deer that seem to live within 20 feet of the AT and have no fear of hikers. Gus and I have walked to within 10 feet of them. I practically have to shoo them off the trail.
I really wanted to see bears. The Shenandoahs are famous for their bears. Warning signs posted near every campground warned of active bears in the area, but nobody is seeing them. I think all the ripe berries are keeping them in the deep woods and away from shelters. I, however, have I’ve logged a few stump bears – tree stumps pretending to be bears in the distance – but those are even less exciting than rattlesticks.
Find Your Excitement Where You Can
My only moments of excitement came when I suddenly, er… urgently?... remembered that last night I’d forgotten to replace the TP I carry in my pack. All I had was the empty cardboard cylinder, the blank pages of my write-in-the-rain field book, and in a pinch, a sweaty dry-fit undershirt. Fortunately, I rounded a bend and saw one of the many Skyline Drive picnic areas in the distance and avoided any unfortunate incidents.
32 Feet Up
The other bit of excitement came when I met the “32 Feet Up” clan, a single mom hiking the AT with her 15 children. The mom posts snippets of their adventures on Facebook and Instagram, which has led to some fame and notoriety. A fair number of AT hikers gripe that the clan fills up shelters and campsites, clogs up the trail, is unruly, and all manner of other complaints. Some internet haters speculate that the mom is mooching help from trail angels, scheming to defraud local merchants, or simply guilty of child abuse.
Northstar and I had seen them in the Loft Mountain Wayside last night but didn’t recognize them until we’d driven away. One of the boys ran up to the van and raced us across the parking lot…a little weird, but something I might have done at his age. Other than that, my only impression was, “Wow! That’s a lot of kids.”
I saw them again this morning, this time at a pull out where the AT crosses Skyline Drive. They’d camped nearby and were getting ready to start hiking. I can’t imagine the logistics of camping and hiking with 15 children. That morning, they were being wrangled by two of the older brothers and a trail angel named Smoky who has been following and assisting them since Georgia.
Thumbs Up for 32 Feet Up
I’ve seen them three times since that first encounter. Regardless of what the internet says, they seem like happy kids. They are definitely enjoying their adventure. They are very polite, saying “Sir” whenever they spoke to me. The older ones remembered me the next time we met, even though I didn’t have Gus along that day. Most people remember Gus, but not me.
When I passed them, they all pulled to the side to let me go by, the rear guard calling out something that sounded like “To the right” when I approached. When I saw them gearing up in the parking lot, they asked me if I needed anything. As I walked past them on the trail, I thought about how many times I’ve been pushed aside by surly hiker trash who can’t grunt out a simple hello as they walk by.
I chatted briefly with the mom, complementing her on the kids’ behavior.  She seemed happy and like she had everything under control, even though the next time I passed them the little one was having a tantrum about something that small children get excited about. But they all took it in stride.
I mentioned the internet controversy and she shrugged it off, saying that it used to bother her, but not anymore. That’s 900 miles of thru hiking for you – you’re either comfortable with what you’re doing or you’ve already quit.
Soco
I got back to camp by 2:00 having knocked out 18 miles in six hours. Northstar and I were chilling by the van with some icy La Croix’s, when Soco walked up and said hi. I hadn’t seen him since May. I’d thought he’d be much farther north by now, but he’d gotten off trail for a wedding or something.
We walked up to the camp store for some refreshments, had a great chat about the trail (especially the lack of bears in the Shenandoahs), and caught up on some mutual acquaintances. I mentioned that I’d seen Mudbug yesterday and he told me that Happy Feet was pulling consecutive 30’s to get to Harpers Ferry by July 4th and must have passed through here yesterday.
Happy Feet
No sooner than he said that, Happy Feet limped up the road and sat down with a groan at a picnic table. She saw us, got up, and hobbled over to join our palaver. Apparently, the consecutive 30’s was just a rumor. She’d done one 30-mile day (an impressive feat) a few days ago, but had injured her knees and had been limping ever since. It sounded like the same injury I had between the NOC and Fontana Dam back in April that disappeared rather miraculously in the Smokies.
It finally started to rain, so I hurried back to button up the van and hang out with Northstar, who had begun to wonder where I’d gone. After dinner, I saw them walk out after the thunder quit.
Owls and Warnings
Just before bed, I noticed the campground host standing outside our van staring up into the trees, so I poked my head out to see what had captured his attention. The birds were going nuts, calling out and flying in and out of the trees above us.  He said a barred owl often sat in that tree and hunted in the robin’s nests. Sure enough, the owl was up there doing its thing.
After the robins finally drove off the owl, the host asked me where I was going tomorrow. When I told him I planned to hike to Skyland Resort, he looked startled. He said that was an extremely long hike and that he’d never heard of anyone going that far in a single day because of the steep, rocky climbs and descents. He checked with his wife and she agreed.
So, I spent the rest of the evening scouring the map and profile for tomorrow’s walk, trying to find the difficult sections. All I could find out was that there are two Waysides along the route. I might not make it all the way, but at least I’ll be well fed.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666382,"Respect
“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir, can I ask a question about your van?”
I’ll be crossing the Mason-Dixon line in a few days and I’m afraid I won’t be hearing that title anymore. The first time a young man addressed me as “Sir” on this trip, I did a double take. Three months later, it still surprises and pleases me. Mind you, it’s always the locals who say it, not thru hikers, unless they’re southerners. I’ll miss the respect.
Advice
Tentman, one of my readers, tells me to take reports of trail conditions from other hikers with “a grain of salt or downright disbelief.” I hiked out of the campground with the host’s warnings in my head about the horrible trail conditions going north. I have no idea what he meant, as the trail was great and had some of the best walking and views in the Shenandoahs so far.
During a steep descent today, I met a lot of day hikers climbing up one of the more popular summits. Several of them asked me some variant of “Are we there yet?” In general, no one should ask that question of any hiker they don’t know well, and especially someone who’s been walking alone for five hours and needs a little entertainment.
When my kids would ask that question on long drives, Northstar’s and my standard answer was “About an hour.” We once told them that seconds before pulling into Grandpa’s driveway and then left them sitting in the backseat while we “went inside this building (Grandpa’s house) to check something out.”
If you ask me that question on a climb, you’ll get anything from “About an hour” to “This trail doesn’t go to that peak” to a sincere estimate of the actual distance. What you get depends on how bored I am, how desperate you look, and whether you called me “Sir.”
A Rock Scramble
Today’s hike started out with an optional blue blaze trail appropriately named “Bearfence Rock Scramble.” I don’t know about the bearfence, though once again we didn’t see any bears. But we definitely had a rock scramble.
The longer, tougher blue blaze offered a half mile of hands-required climbing and descents, great 360-degree views, and some say-a-quick-prayer sections. Of course, Gus and I took the blue blaze, just to get above the long green tunnel and see some sky.
But what do the purists do? Stick to the official trail, miss the views, and avoid the more difficult option? Hike both trails in a loop? Unfortunately, purists aren’t speaking to me at the moment, so I have no answer.
The nasty blue blaze trail was only a few yards from the “official” AT, highlighting the awesome job the trail designers in Shenandoah National Park have done choosing trail alignments that are usually smooth and well-graded. Which makes me wonder why the entire AT isn’t like that.
Trail Design
I think the AT’s design (grade, alignment, ruggedness, rocks, steps, switchbacks, etc.) reflects the designers’ priorities. Most of the trail was originally built or designed by local hiking clubs or local ATC chapters, many of whom were peak-baggers who wanted to scale as many high points as possible. Even today, most hikers on any given section of trail are day or section hikers, not thru hikers. The trail is designed to meet their needs.
When the AT was first conceived, no one thought hiking the entire AT in a single season was possible, so the trail wasn’t designed with thru-hiking in mind. Most thru hikers I’ve met wish the trail were designed to get them from Georgia to Maine as efficiently as possible, while taking them past the best peaks and cool spots along the way. Thru hikers have little use for steep climbs that have no views or alignments that miss the best swimming holes or resupply locales.
Big Meadows
Not surprisingly, Big Meadows was located at the edge of a very large meadow. More importantly, Big Meadows has a Wayside grill, which was open when I walked in at 10:15, eight miles into my 17-mile hike. Unfortunately, only the breakfast menu was available until 11:00, and I had promised Gus he’d be getting a smash burger patty for lunch.
So, we waited the 40 minutes for the lunch menu, and pulled out some snacks to tide us over. Not quite believing me about the burger, Gus ate his entire kibble supply and several of my Cheezits during the wait, but still managed to wolf down his smash burger. In seconds. And then walked the next ten miles with a little more wobble than usual.
Out of the Tunnel
The hike from Big Meadows to Skyland Resort is spectacular. The trail hugs the west side of the ridge, which is more open than the jungle I’d walked through the past three days. We not only had views of the Shenandoah Valley, we caught a wonderful cooling breeze blowing up the slope.
The woods along this section were lighter, had less underbrush, and much less of the Tolkienesque Mirkwood feel. It was a forest I’d gladly walk into. And expect to come out the other side.
If you only have time to walk one section of the Shenandoahs, I’d suggest the stretch from Big Meadows to Skyland Resort. Not only does it have the best views and walking, but it’s also bookended by Wayside Grills.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666484,"Sorry I’m Late
Internet has been a little hard to come by in the Shenandoahs, so pardon the delays in posting. I seem to get decent cell coverage when I’m walking the ridges, but the gaps and campgrounds erratically vacillate between SOS-mode and one bar. I always post a day or two behind our actual location for safety reasons, but I’m a little further behind than usual.
I’m also behind on responding to comments. I’ll catch up on our next zero day. I always appreciate the feedback and encouragement. And I almost always value the admonitions, if only for something to brood about during the more tedious parts of the day.
I’m not only behind on blogging, I’m also behind on where I thought I’d be by now. Yesterday marked 12 weeks on the trail. I’ve been out here almost three months and I’m not halfway. I know the first month mileage tends to be lower than the middle months, but I think my June gets most of the blame.
I logged 11 zero (no trail miles) and four nearo (a near zero) days in June, none of which were intentional rest days.  If I’d walked only 10 miles on those off days, I’d be Pennsylvania eating a half-gallon of ice cream.* If I’d pushed hard on those off days, I’d be counting New Jersey bears.
Skyland Resort
Northstar and I enjoyed our night at Skyland Resort, mostly for the hot shower and all-night air conditioning. As for the rest, the resort was exactly what I expected of someplace run by the federal government – priceless location, overpriced rooms and food, aging infrastructure, and exceptionally lousy customer service. Our dinner bordered on awful but offered a great view.
I especially appreciated being able to let Northstar sleep in while I slipped out extra early at 6:00 am to try to beat the heat and humidity on a 20-mile day. I didn’t have particularly big climbs or descents, just a lot of miles and not a lot of points of interest to serve as intermediate goals to help break up the day. Instead, I used the road crossings to measure my progress.
I also left early hoping to see some bears near the resort, but once again, the bears must have been off doing what bears do in the woods. Eat berries, that is. They left all the berries along the trail for me. The deer, however, continued to clog up the trail. I’ve stopped taking pictures of them and now just hike past saying, “ ‘ello, dear” in a British accent. Yeah, they don’t think that’s very funny either. But you might after 78 days alone in the woods.
Congratulations…Maybe
A mile out of Skyland Resort, just after sunrise, I saw three people walking towards me. The lead hiker wore a Woodsy Owl Ranger outfit and carried a fancy camera with a long lens. Okay, not an actual Woodsy Owl Ranger uniform, but the kind of clothes LL Bean thinks forest rangers wear.
Next came a young woman, who couldn’t have been more than 18 years old, wearing white silky knee length shorts and a brightly colored silk zipper jacket (pink and blue, maybe?). A young man in a full black tuxedo carrying a bouquet of colorful flowers brought up the rear.
Obviously, they were returning from a sunrise wedding proposal photoshoot. I grinned at them and almost called out, “Congratulations!” but then decided from the grim looks on their faces that it might not have gone as planned. My son has a similar wedding proposal story…stories…so I kept my mouth shut. Hopefully, she said yes, and only the drizzle and early hour were to blame for their sad faces.
Sunrise at Little Stony Man Cliffs
The sunrise couldn’t be blamed for a bad proposal photo. The stormy weather made for an exceptionally dramatic sunrise, which I caught as I passed the cliffs before Mary’s Rock. Dark clouds lay just above the deep red, orange, dark blue horizon. Gray and white clouds interspersed with thin patches of blue sky swept skyward tracing out wild patterns and the motion of the atmospheric winds. If the skies offered any kind of omen, that young couple’s marriage will be an epic adventure.
For me, the sunrise, cliffs, and open woods provided possibly the best view on the entire AT. So far. I walked with a lively breeze most of the morning, which kept the humidity at bay and almost dried out my clothes still damp from yesterday’s hot yoga hike.
Camping With 32 Feet Up
When I passed the first shelter after Skyland Resort, I saw the 32 Feet Up family packing up. I heard them about a quarter mile before that. The kids were having a blast, and like most kids, blasted their excitement. Soco and two other hikers my age told me they planned to camp at that shelter, but I didn’t see any of them in the midst of the family’s semi-controlled chaos. They must have gotten out early or moved on. I was curious how camping next to 15 kids went.
I passed one of the older hikers later that morning. Since we’d met twice before, and he hadn’t been particularly extroverted, this time I introduced myself. Our dialogue went something like this:
Me: Hi, I’ve seen you three days in a row. I guess I should introduce myself. I’m The Incident.Guy: Oh.Me: Uh, and what’s your name?Guy: Pete (I’m using an alias for him).Me: Hi, Pete. Is that your trail name?Pete: I use my real name.Me: Have you seen Soco today? I was hoping to catch him again.Pete: He left early.Me: He was going to camp at the shelter back there. Is that where you camped? With the 32 Feet Up family?Pete: Yeah.Me: How was it camping with all those kids? Did you get a chance to meet them?Pete: It was okay.
From this exchange, I concluded that camping with 32 Feet Up was “okay.” And that Pete is not much of a storyteller.
Ending the Day with a Bang
The rest of the day turned into a humid hike through the long green tunnel. The Elk Wallow Wayside provided a beacon of light at the end of the tunnel, though I decided I was a little smash-burgered out today. I did have room for another blackberry milkshake.
Service was predictably slow, so by the time I got served and walked back outside to fetch my pack, storm clouds had moved in and brought rumblings of thunder. I geared up and took the shake with me back into the woods, but barely made it across Skyline Drive before it started raining.
One of the nice things about the long green tunnel is that the trees intercept the rain, as long as it doesn’t rain too hard or too long. With only two miles to go to the van, I hoped I might just beat out a soaking. Nope and nope.
It rained buckets. But it felt great. The rain washed off most of today’s sweat and some of yesterday’s. By the time I’d finished my milkshake, my shoes were squishing out little jets of water with every step and my clothes were plastered to my body. When I got to the last short climb, the sun popped out, but the rain kept coming. So, I walked in rain and sun, whistling all the rain songs I could remember until I saw Northstar and the van at a turnout.
Odds and Ends
I logged 20 miles in eight hours. At that pace, a 30-miler would take me at least 12 hours. I’ve done my share of 12-hour hikes, but never on a daily basis. That’s a long time on my feet.I passed a Boy Scout Troop on an end-to-end hike through the Shennies. They all wore matching pink shirts. Except for two of them who claimed their shirts stunk. Ten minutes later, I passed two rather overweight leaders struggling up the climb, which reminded me of every Scout hike I ever did.I also saw a family with four kids doing a 10-day end to end hike. When I told them they were about to meet the 32 Feet Up family, they were pretty excited, having followed them on social media.Two days ago, I saw a barefoot backpacker walking along Skyline Drive during our drive to the campground. After I passed, I realized I should have stopped to see if it was Homemade, the barefooter who made all his own gear.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666492,"AT Beards
I’ve seen a thousand miles of trail so far, but I wonder how many miles of cumulative beard I’ve seen. Mine gets a regular trim to keep Northstar from bolting for home or locking me out of the van, but given the heat, humidity, and tick population on the AT, I’m surprised that so many beards survived this far north. Of the types of chin art I’ve seen, the following are the most prevalent and my favorites:
Feral Santa. The Mason-Dixon line between Santa and Feral Santa is volume. Both have long, white whiskers, but St. Nick’s feral followers rock beards that stick out in all directions, could hide raptor nests, and haven’t been combed since Earl Shaeffer walked the trail.A subset of the white beard crowd (grey is allowed in this category), the Gandalf beard is straight, long enough to cover their clavicle, and shows signs of being thoughtfully pulled on when pondering the lack of white blazes at a trail junction. Extra points carrying a wooden hiking stick or wearing a tall pointy hat, both of which I’ve seen. These guys are tough to pass.Hiker Trash. Basically, a younger version of feral Santa. Bearlike, except smellier and less friendly.Wannabe Hiker Trash. Has the trash attitude but not the testosterone. Their beard looks like they tried eating brown cotton candy without using their hands and didn’t have time to clean up yet. A thin patchy mess.Girl Beards. A.k.a. leg hair. Personally, I respect girl beards. Rock on.
Feral Santa Speaks
I started musing on AT beards after easily passing (therefore, not a Gandalf) a feral Santa (FS) on the steep climb up Compton Peak, just before reaching a nice stream crossing. Gus needed water, so I sat down to give him time to drink his fill. That turned into a lunch break, which gave FS time to catch up.
Most FS I’ve met, and there have been a lot, are as jovial as their namesake. This one, however, had an edge. He spied my purple thru-hiker tag and asked if I was hiking all the way from Georgia to Maine. That question usually precedes a friendly chat about the trail, but I could see judgment in FS’ eyes. Had I been a good hiker or a bad hiker this year?
“Yes, sir,” I replied, “I’m hiking northbound.” “Well, then,” he said, “You’re pretty far behind everyone else, aren’t you? Do you think you’ll make it to Maine in time?” Ouch. Actually, I think about that all the time. Doesn’t everyone? Still, ouch.
Thinking FS had some sage advice for me, I asked when he’d completed a thru-hike. “Well, I haven’t, but I’ve hiked all over the world back when you didn’t need permits to hike.” Huh? I guess I can cross sage advice off my list of expectations from FS. He didn’t ask when I’d started, what kind of daily mileage I logged, and had never thru hiked himself, but still felt qualified to render an opinion of doom about my chances.
Lots of snarky replies passed through my head, but fortunately not over my lips. I just asked him what hike his world favorite was. He replied, “The Canadian Rockies,” but didn’t provide any more details. He and Pete (from yesterday) should get together and not talk.
Closing the Gap
Today’s hike was all about closing the gap we left between our San Diego and Indianapolis trips. I walked out of the Shenadoahs and north to US 522 where I’d flip-flopped to between our travels. Expecting more heat and humidity, and possibly some afternoon showers, Gus and I were out the door by 6:30 am.
Once again, we passed no major landmarks or milestones except the northern Shenandoah National Park boundary. We caught some nice views from rock outcrops on ridges, saw plenty of deer, and stopped to chat with some day hikers but saw no other thru hikers. Maybe FS was right, and we are way behind everyone else. Except the 32 Feet Up crowd, who we saw one last time as the younger ones crawled out of their tents and waved as we passed.
At one trail overlook, we walked up to the edge for a peek and saw Northstar drive past below us on Skyline Drive. I tried to call her, but she must not have had coverage. So, I left a voicemail explaining the coincidence and hiked on. Unfortunately, a few minutes later she got the call notification but not the message and assumed the worst. Which led to a few panicked moments and a flurry of delayed texts. Note to self. Do not call Northstar unless something really bad happens. And maybe not then either.
Chasing Soco
My other goal for the day was to catch Soco, who I guessed was hiking with Pete and the other nameless old guy I’d seen the past few days. But either he slept in, left early, or just plain outhiked me, because I walked 17.7 miles without a rumor of him.
North of the Park, the trail returned to the rocky, steep, root-covered, single track I’ve come to know and love. Gus turned wistfully and looked back at the wide, smooth, groomed trail in the park, and then soldiered on behind me as he always does.
Yelp Review of the Shenandoahs
The trails were fantastic and uncrowded. We caught some fantastic views and saw lots of deer, though the long, green tunnel became a bit too long and green in places. But to be fair, the rain, heat, and humidity probably made the tunnel more oppressive than it would be in other seasons. Unfortunately, the famous Shenandoah bears stayed out of sight.
The Waysides let me down a little, as they were fewer in number and harder to get to than I expected, though I did get to nearly all of them. Also, the Park rules against boondocking, which are perfectly reasonable, complicated my original plan to meet Northstar more frequently and park right on the trail.
Overall, I’m glad I didn’t skip the Shenandoahs, enjoyed my hike through them, and am glad I’m done.
The End of The Incident's Shenandoah Gap
We walked up to US 522 tired and footsore and saw Northstar at the far of the parking area. And then I noticed Soco and Pete sitting on the north side of the highway with their packs off. So, I dodged the traffic and crossed over to chat, getting viciously honked at by some old guy in a rusty Toyota. I think he was angry that Gus followed me across traffic.
Sometimes, people can’t see the thin parachute cord leash I use on Gus when we’re near roads or in populated areas and they lecture (or honk at) me about dog safety and leash rules. In other places, I have Gus on an electronic training collar to make sure he doesn’t wander off, chase disrespectful critters, or approach dog-haters. Most jurisdictions allow off-leash training if you use an electronic collar. Plus, Gus is very chill around other dogs and people, especially after hiking a few hours takes some of the bounce out of him.
Soco and Pete were done for the day, waiting on the 2:15 shuttle into Front Royal to resupply. Since they had an hour’s wait, we gave them a ride and got a bit more of the story out of Soco about camping next to 32 Feet Up. But basically, I discovered, it was “okay.” Turns out Pete was right.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666541,"A Perfect Plan
I set this one up perfectly.  June’s interruptions gave me lemons and a flippity-floppity itinerary, and I turned them into a sweet lemonade of a day. A day of epic milestones. Watch and learn. Or read and learn. Whatever.
Yesterday, we put the Shenandoahs behind us and drove north to Key’s Gap where we stopped two weeks ago before heading to Indianapolis for Tim’s funeral. As we drove north from Shenandoah National Park, Northstar said that she finally felt like herself again. She hasn’t had a shingles flair up for more than a month, her energy level is good, she’s avoided dozens of gas station posts, and she’s even ready to hike little bits of the trail with me.
I stopped at Keys Gap two weeks ago for two reasons. First, I didn’t want to leave Virginia before finishing the 109 miles I’d left in Shenandoah National Park. Second, walking past the 1,000-mile marker before the 900-mile marker had felt weird. I didn’t want to relive that feeling at by walking into Harpers Ferry, which is kind of the AT’s emotional halfway point, before I’d actually finished the first half of the AT. I’d stopped just shy of the Pennsylvania border, after walking most of Maryland with Dan, for the same reason.
Today’s plan set me up to click off the following milestones:
Finish Virginia (State #4)Enter West Virginia (State #5)Cross the Shenandoah RiverEnter Harpers FerryVisit the ATC headquarters and get my AT mugshot recorded.Finish West Virginia (State #5)Finish Maryland (State #6)Cross the Mason-Dixon Line and enter the North
Plus, in a non-purist, cheating, yellow-blazing sort of way, I could pull off the four-state challenge. Uber-hikers hike the 40+ miles from just south of the West Virginia line to Pennsylvania, bagging four states (VA-WV-MD-PA) in less than 24 hours. My days of doing that sort of mileage on foot are long behind me.
Virginia
We boondocked at the VA 9 parking area at Keys Gap along the Virginia-West Virginia border. Trucks roared by all night, but we put our exhaust fan on high and drowned out most of the noise. After nine straight days of walking, I could probably have slept well on the VA 9 centerline.
Virginia’s last few miles of trail was pleasant. Not great, but the woods were more open, with better visibility and bright, spring green cover of ferns and grass, as well as a blanket of the brown leaves I love leftover from last fall. I could survive off-trail in these woods. In fact, the open understory tempted me to take a left and just spend the day exploring.
I might have on a less humid day. From now on, you can just assume that its hot and humid unless I say otherwise. To celebrate my new acceptance of East Coast humidity, I dropped a layer. I’ve always worn a wicking t-shirt under my long-sleeve shirt. Even during summer field work in Arizona. But that just doesn’t work well in high humidity. It only provides more fabric to get hopelessly soaked with sweat.
On a short rocky section, I slipped off the edge of boulder, dropped and twisted my ankle and knee, but caught myself before doing any damage. Whew. One bad step is all it takes to end a thru hike, I reminded myself, as I picked my way along more carefully. One bad step.
Within an hour I walked up to the West Virginia border sign. It felt great walking out of Virginia knowing I’d done everything to the south. After more than 500 miles and 47 days, Virginia is finally done.
I loved Virginia, my favorite state so far, but I’m happy to check it off the list. I just have to avoid thinking about that John Denver song for the next 3.1 miles.
West Virginia
Most of the AT in West Virginia lies within the Harpers Ferry National Historical Area, which is rife with Civil War remnants, memories, and ghosts. But my thoughts looked to the future, not to the past. I found myself thinking about hiking in New England, something I hadn’t been able to visualize so far. I even started planning the drive back to Arizona from Maine. It must be the proximity to Pennsylvania and the North. For the first time, I’m sensing the end of my hike.
The rumble of Highway 340 and glimpses of the Shenandoah River through the trees brought me back to the present. Just before the bridge, I stopped, chatted, and laughed with an Amish family heading south. They had the traditional beards, brimmed hats, bonnets, and long dresses, but the men wore brightly colored shirts and they all were using carbon-fiber trekking poles. I need to learn more about their lifestyle.
Walking the Shenandoah River Bridge felt like a celebration. Such a beautiful river, so wide, and with so many bedrock shelves and white, swirling rapids. What I wouldn’t give for a canoe and an afternoon off.
Harpers Ferry/ATC Headquarters
Gus and I walked up the hill to the Appalachian Trail Conference (ATC) headquarters in Harpers Ferry just before 9:00 am but discovered it didn’t open until 10:00 am on Wednesdays. Fortunately, Northstar drove up a minute later and whisked us away to the Battle Ground Coffee Shop for a mug of the best chai tea latte I’ve ever had. So I had another one. Northstar said the coffee was also excellent.
Thoroughly sugared and caffeined, we headed back to the ATC for the standard halfway mug shot that goes in the ATC’s permanent records. I looked longingly at the notebooks full of this year’s hikers, but didn’t feel like burning any more of the morning’s cool temperatures paging through to see who was ahead of me. I wanted to get out and log miles.
On my way out, I bumped into Sharpens Steel. I’d last seen him around mile 500, on the day the van wouldn’t start the first time. He’d lost 45 pounds, he said, and looked great. I mentioned that I’d seen V6 and Optimist, his original hiking partners, which seemed to make him happy, though I think he had a new tramily with him.
Maryland
Since I’d already hiked the Potomac River Bridge into Maryland and most of Maryland’s AT, we drove 40 minutes up to Raven Rock Road at Mile 1061.4, six miles south of the Pennsylvania border. As I climbed out of the van, a day hiker pulled up and parked behind us, asking if it was legal to park here. I’m the wrong guy to ask, as Northstar didn’t plan to stick around, and I’d pretty much leave any parking tickets behind. The parking cops can chase me up the AT or come get me in Arizona.
The hike out of Maryland started with a sweaty 900-foot climb, followed by six rocky miles up to Pen-Mar State Park which straddles the state line. I planned to meet Northstar at the park and hike the 0.2 miles to the border together. Then we’d hike back to the van, drive into Waynesboro, and take a zero.
The Perfect Plan Unravels
An AT First. About three miles from Pen Mar Park, I popped out of the woods at a parking lot. I’d been seeing spray painted graffiti on boulders and trees for about a mile, a rarity for the AT, but suddenly realized where I was. High Rock Ledges, a bedrock overlook, is a local graffiti mecca. The overlook and nearly every paintable surface around it is blanketed with layers of colorful, but not particularly artistic, graffiti. But there’s enough of it that it somehow transcends (barely) ugly and becomes interesting.
I’d forgotten about this place and didn’t expect to see it, since it requires a blue blaze side trail to reach. But I’d somehow gotten off the AT and on the blue blaze. After snapping some obligatory pictures, I turned around to head back to the AT, but couldn’t find the blue blaze trail I’d come in on. FarOut to the rescue. I turned on the map app, zoomed in, and followed the little icon through the woods until I reached the AT. Problem solved.
I’d hiked about 30 minutes further when I saw a hiker coming my direction. As soon as he saw me, he called out, “Hey, did you hike to the state line and back already? That’s incredible!” I didn’t know how to reply. Who was this guy? Why did he think I’d been to the state line? And more importantly, why did he think I was “coming back?”
Uh oh. I recognized him as the hiker who parked behind the van at Raven Rock Road. A dark suspicion began to form in the back of my mind, so I asked, “Are you hiking north?”
He gave me a funny look. “Yes,” he said, “Which direction do you think you’re hiking?” I didn’t have to answer. I knew which direction I’d been walking. I was headed back to Raven Rock Road, not north to Pen Mar Park. My six-mile hike just became a nine-mile hike.
I thanked Von for saving me from hiking all three miles back to the starting point, for recognizing me, and for saying something. It could have been much worse. I turned around and headed back north, having just done my first wrong way hike after a thousand miles on the AT.
Rocks…Nasty Rocks. The trail down from High Rock Ledges is nasty. It’s steep and so bouldery that it’s nearly impossible to find and follow the trail in places. It may be Maryland’s way of letting us know what’s coming in Pennsylvania.
The huge rock fields are a geologic feature called rock rivers, which are created by freeze-thaw processes that break chunks off cliff faces and slope processes which move them slowly downhill. They look like huge, steeply sloped, boulder fields.  The AT crosses many of them in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, but today’s rock river was one of the biggest I’ve seen yet. If some of the rocks weren’t painted with white blazes, I’d probably still be out there wandering around.
One Misstep is All it Takes. I walked into Pen Mar Park and met Northstar and Gus for a 0.2 mile celebratory hike into Pennsylvania. As we walked off the park’s manicured lawns and into the green woods, Northstar mentioned she had an itchy bug bite on the back of her leg and asked me to look at it. She’s been a little on edge about tick bites because Gus brings so many of the evil little ba$t@rds back to the van.
I’m always willing to check out her legs, so I leaned over for a good look. And saw a central red bump with a red bull’s eye halo ¾-inch off center. My heart sank.
It wasn’t a textbook picture of an infected tick bite, but it was close enough for concern. We turned around immediately and headed for the nearest urgent care, calling our genius doctor son on the way. He agreed with my assessment. As did the urgent care doctor, who’s prognosis was that it could be anything from just a bug bite to you’ll be in the hospital for weeks…we’d just have to take the prescribed antibiotics and wait.
Now What? So we wait. Northstar had a tough battle with thyroid cancer 28 years ago, and has struggled with autoimmune disorders ever since, so we’ve been down the “just wait” road many times. It sucks. Really, really sucks.
We sat in the van, totally stunned. Eventually, one of us started talking scenarios. Do we go home? Do we want hospital-level symptoms to occur while I’m out hiking? If we stay, what could we do differently to avoid future tick bites? Should we find a place for Gus until we’re out of the middle Atlantic states and the worst of the tick habitat? What if it’s just a bug bite? Are we overreacting?
Just when we started to normalize all this and formulate a plan, the phone rang. Our daughter in Phoenix was on the way to the ER. She’d described some of her symptoms to my doctor son and he told her to get to an ER right away.
Tomorrow will be a zero day, but we’ll have more than zero going on.
Stay tuned.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666583,"Settling the Shock Waves
Northstar and I talked late into the night yesterday, working out a Plan A, B, and C, each with a host of variants, each depending on her condition. By the time we’d figured that all out, our daughter had been treated and released from the ER. At that point, we had nothing left to do but collapse into bed. After I had a long, hot shower, that is, and had sequestered my smelly hiking clothes in a closet.
Resolved
Northstar and I both woke up knowing we want to keep hiking. We want to reach Katahdin. I think she said it before she said good morning. We’ll stop if Northstar develops Lymes Disease condition worsens, obviously, but until it does we’re moving north.  Just not today. Today is for rest, reflection, and recovery.
Yesterday was my tenth consecutive day hiking and my legs and feet were feeling it. They feel strong in the mornings but start sputtering earlier and earlier each successive day. I think my endurance is improving and I hope to log a few more 20’s in Pennsylvania. I appreciate the wise advice I’ve gotten in the comments to not rush and risk hurting myself, but I am excited to see what I can do, at least before I get to the nastiest rocks.
Reflection
As bad as yesterday was, it could have been worse. In retrospect, lots of things fell into place for us. For example, the urgent care was completely empty when Northstar walked in. A few minutes later, fifteen people were in line. Our motel sat right next to a Walmart, Lowes, Verizon, Laundromat, and Harbor Freight, all of which I needed to work through my chore list.
Also, both the tick bite and our daughter’s ER visit happened when we’d already scheduled a zero day, so we had time to adapt and process. I had time to catch up on my blogs, fix the van’s cabinetry, and figure out why our wireless hot spot box wasn’t charging.
Our Tick Prevention Plan
Roux’s reform school/summer camp in Chattanooga doesn’t have room for Gus and we don’t know anyone willing to dog sit a somewhat needy Golden Doodle for three months. So, Gus is banned from hiking until we’re out of tick country and the weather turns colder. He and I are both despondent, but it's definitely the right thing. Also, he’s relegated to the floor until he completes a quarantine period. He agreed to this last clause reluctantly. It’ll be a battle.
Progress
By mid-day, the halo around the tick bite had disappeared, though its still a dime sized red spot. We’ve also heard some less scary accounts of tick bites and Lyme’s Disease. We’ve adopted a wait and see attitude, but for now, we plan to head north again tomorrow.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666632,"Appa-LAY-shun Trail
Northstar drove me out to Pen Mar Park and decided to walk Gus and me up to the Pennsylvania Border. The state line is also the Mason-Dixon Line, the unofficial boundary between the South and the North. We whistled Dixie as we approached. But when we crossed the line, I switched to The Battle Hymn of the Republic, a critical mistake, as that became my earworm for the next eight hours.
I’m a Yankee by birth (not the baseball team, though…when the Brooklyn Dodgers went west, we were left only with our hatred of those pinstripes until the Mets showed up… but I digress), but I have lived more than twice as long in Arizona as New York. Arizona had not yet become a state during the Civil War, though it was mostly populated at that time by former Texans and other Confederate sympathizers. My ancestors, however, were abolitionists and helped with underground railroad, or so I’ve been told by the family historian.
South vs. North
All of which is to say that I’m not highly invested in the whole North-South thing. However, I’ve had to work hard for the past three months to say Appa-LATCH-chun, and will be happy to revert back to the more natural and grammatically correct Appa-LAY-shun. Also, gravy is NOT a breakfast staple. And what the heck is it with seven different kinds of gizzard in the buffet line?
Just kidding, of course (I’m not). I loved hiking the AT in the South. Early spring in the southern AppaLATCHchuns was fantastic, even if the trail itself was a chore. Spring in North Carolina and the mythical “state” of Tennessee was so beautiful. Virginia was my favorite, though I somehow missed the “flatter” part of Virginia where everyone said I’d be able to easily knock out 20-mile days.
I’m really looking forward to the cool, crisp air and the soft, pleasant trails of the middle Atlantic states. I’ve been told that the trails are all easy walking, I’ll probably need a sweater most of the time, and that there’ll be no more ticks or poison ivy.  Can’t wait!
A New Bubble
After I walked across the border, Northstar and Gus turned to head back to the van. Gus, the little traitor, didn’t even look back over his shoulder at me.  So, I walked on alone, with the morning trail all to myself as usual.
I guess I’ll be starting over with a new bubble of hikers. Almost everyone I started out with in the deep south is weeks ahead of me. Everyone I met in the Shenandoahs is weeks behind me. I’ll need to be extroverted to find my place in my new bubble, which is not exactly my strong suit. Oh boy.
An Ausssie, an Old Guy, and a 20-Something
Eventually, after passing quite a few still-occupied tents, a few other hikers began to appear. I mostly leapfrogged three other thru hikers – a young Australian woman, a pencil thin guy my age, and another young woman who had no more to offer than a reluctant nod.
I chatted with the Australian woman for a few minutes as I passed. She started at Springer the day after I did and expects to finish about the same time. I don’t think we’ll be besties, but she was nice and seemed intrigued by my slackpacking-vanlife regime. Later in the day, a day-hiker approached me to ask if I was “the vanlife guy.” Apparently, he’d met the Aussie, learned about my van (why?), and had a hundred questions about it for his upcoming (2036!) thru hike.
I passed the skinny old guy next. We exchanged the usual pleasantries until he told me, with an extremely guilty look, that he liked to book a motel every 10 days to clean up. I replied that I lived in a van and cleaned up every night, so I had no problem with motels.
He looked shocked. And then told me I was a cheater. I laughed, but when I turned to look at him, I realized he wasn’t kidding. So, I smiled, and I told him a few others had told me that before, that they are welcome to their opinion, but I’m happy hiking my own hike. Then he told me that I should probably move on since my pace was faster than his. So I did. Too bad. He seemed like a decent guy.
It’s Gonna Be Hot
I was kidding about expecting cooler weather in Pennsylvania. I grew up in upstate New York and remember those hazy summer 90-90 days - 90% humidity and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Yuck. So far, air temperatures haven’t crested the mid-80’s, but we all know what’s coming.
I only had about 3,000 feet of climbing today, but it included one 800-foot climb and a 1,000-foot climb. Both climbs were hot and sweaty, and the humidity kept me dripping all day. I never dried off. By mid-morning my pants, shirt, and underlayers were drenched with slimy, salty sweat. I tried soaking my head in a stream. It cooled me a little, but my hair never dried. This ain’t Arizona’s dry heat.
Wildlife
At least the bugs aren’t bad. I’ve seen a few hikers wearing head nets. I have one along, but it’s reserved for Alaska-level mosquito infestations or New England black fly swarms. I think I’ll miss black fly season up north, but I’ll probably get my share of New Jersey and Connecticut skeeters. If I do, I’ll share some Alaska mosquito stories for perspective.
Speaking of wildlife, besides bugs and birds (including one incredible scarlet tanager which landed on a branch right front of me), it’s gone. I saw only one deer in the woods today and it disappeared immediately. I also saw a fair number of hunting signs. A coincidence, I’m sure.
My only wildlife encounter was with a black snake. Not a Black Snake, a black colored snake I couldn’t identify. He’d stretched out across the trail, so I tapped his tail with my trekking pole, expecting him to slither off into the brush. Instead, he coiled up, lifted his head into the strike position, and stuck his tail up, wiggling it like he expected it to rattle.
Except that it had no rattles, and he didn’t have a viper’s head shape. But he kept at it, defending the trail against any advance until I worked my way around behind him through the underbrush. I do not like snakes.
Life Intervenes Again
Northstar called as I was closing in on Caledonia State Park. Our daughter was headed back to the ER with a more severe allergic reaction than she’d had two days ago. It appears the ER had been more motivated to discharge (and charge!) her than to treat her, an all-too-common occurrence in the medical world.
By the time I found Northstar at the Park, she’d corralled our doctor son and her friend who’s an allergist to intervene and things seemed more or less under control, though we didn’t have any kind of diagnosis or prognosis. The poor girl just can’t seem to catch a break.
It Could Be Worse…
When things are going wrong, Northstar and I often quote the Marty Feldman line from Mel Brooks’ Young Frankenstein – “It could be worse, it could be raining.” Just after I climbed into the van, the skies let loose with the hardest downpour we’ve seen on the trail so far. The windshield wipers couldn’t keep up.
At least I wasn’t still hiking.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666664,"Caledonia State Park
Instead of boondocking for free, I booked a $30 campsite at Caledonia State Park because it’s located right on the AT, has clean bathrooms, showers, and dispersed sites spread out through the woods. All of that is true, but our part of the campground was a packed gravel parking lot 1.5 miles down the highway from the AT, had intermittent cell coverage, and a fully functional barking network.
But it did have showers, flush toilets, and an electrical hookup so we could run the AC all night. Having AC on a freakin’ stuffy, humid night was worth having to wake up Northstar at 5:45 am to drive back to the trail. But she managed to get back to sleep and woke to find herself in the middle of a local craft fair.
I Should Tie a String Around My Finger
As I drove out of the campground, I bumped my ring finger against the van window and it didn’t clink the way it usually does. Oh no! I’d taken my ring off in the shower last night and left it there. So, I sprinted (in my mind anyway, actual land speed may have been what most people consider slowly jogging) back up to the bathrooms and found it right where I’d left it.
Last time I left it in a shower, at the Black Bear Hostel near Laurel Falls, Northstar had used the outdoor shower stall after me. She found the ring on the floor, pocketed it, and waited for me to realize I’d lost it. I think she was hoping it’d be days before I figured out, but I noticed it before bedtime. Married people games.
Hike On
Today’s hike promised to be another hot, humid, slog through the long green tunnel, and it delivered. The woods were lovely, quiet, and had minimal ground cover and nice filtered light. At one point, I walked through a patch of blooming Mountain Laurel, something I hadn’t done in a month.
The trails were well groomed and not too steep, with still no sign of Pennsylvania’s famous rocks. The 1,000-foot climb at the start left me dripping with greasy sweat that hung on me all day. I don’t mind being sweaty, but once my clothes and hands are soaked, I can’t dry off my reading glasses or use my phone’s touchscreen. First world problems.
Close Encounters of a Karmic Kind
Last week, I posted about my new game of loudly sneaking up on hikers. This morning, the trail got its Karmic revenge. A runner slipped up behind me and I nearly jumped out of my skin when he asked to pass.
I had that encounter in mind as I closed the gap on the skinny old guy who’d called me a cheater yesterday. But he heard me coming and pulled over to let me pass. He was friendly enough to make me think he might have been just joking about the “cheater” thing. We chatted about yesterday’s rain deluge, which he and the Aussie just missed by sitting under a pavilion at the State Park.
As I started to pull away, I asked his trail name and he answered, “Hoodie. With an H.” I started wondering how else Hoodie might be spelled when he asked my name. I told him, and he said, “I think I’ll call you Cheater, because your wife helps you so much.” I laughed and replied, “Ok. You can call me Cheater, but I’m going to call you Zebra.”
He looked a little confused, so I continued, “Because you’re like a referee, calling out fouls and rule violations.” (Referees wear black and white “zebra” shirts.) He didn’t much like that idea, but we were both smiling. I think.
What Do You Call a Man in a Dress?
Later, I saw a group of backpackers heading up the trail towards me. The three guys, all built like offensive lineman, wore tartan kilts. The one woman with them wore pants. As they approached, I called out in my best Scottish accent (which is pretty good, if I say so myself, and doesn’t sound at all like an Irish accent), “A wee bit o’ Scotland today, aye?” The lead guy smiled and without missing a beat replied, “Aye, laddie, aye.”
The Half Gallon Challenge
The big question of the day was, “Are you going to do the Half Gallon Challenge?” The Half Gallon Challenge, invented to celebrate passing the AT’s halfway point located near Pine Grove Furnace State Park, requires participants to eat an entire half gallon of ice cream in a half hour.
Winners earn a small wooden spoon with the words “Half Gallon Challenge” on it. Some winners also earn a quick trip to the bushes to unload their half gallon. The rest of the winners get to carry five pounds of partially digested ice cream up the next climb.
I’d talked about the Challenge with Zebra, who like me had his heart set on a burger and fries, rather than a mountain of sugary ice cream. When I mentioned that my 700-mile Pie Challenge hadn’t gone well, he looked distraught. Apparently, he’d been craving cherry pie for the last three days. I may not be destined to be friends with Zebra after all.
But the Half Gallon Challenge doesn’t happen until I reach Pine Grove Furnace State Park. I still had ten miles of trail and two significant milestones to cross.
Halfway to Katahdin
This year, the AT is 2,198.4 miles long. The mileage can vary from year to year due to trail reroutes, detours, maintenance, or improvements such as adding switchbacks. PhD told me that in the 70’s the trail was 400 miles shorter before the ATC started improving it. Regardless, half of this year’s 2,198.4 miles is 1099.2, so as I neared that mile point, I kept my eyes open for the marker.
At mile 1097.15, I passed a wooden post with a framed, glass-enclosed certificate that supposedly marked the 2022 halfway point. Then, at mile 1099.2, someone had built a “1/2 WAY” sign out of rocks. I stopped and sat down to ponder its significance.
Halfway is a big deal. 1099.2 miles is a long hike. The folks at the ATC told me that more than half of the people who started at Amicolola Falls State Park in Georgia didn’t make it to Harpers Ferry, let alone another 70 miles up the trail to the halfway marker.
But for me, half done is not done. My job isn’t finished. Plus, my feet and legs were tired today, I was hot and dripping with sweat, and thoughts of that burger had put me in the food mood. I hiked on.
Less than a mile later I passed the 1,100-mile marker, snapping a quick picture and some video as I went by. A few miles after that, I saw yet another halfway marker, this time indicating that Springer and Katahdin were each 1090.5 miles in opposite directions. The trail was once 17 miles shorter, but the halfway point was further north. Go figure.
Ghosted
I’d hardly seen any thru hikers on the trail today, so I walked into the Pine Grove Furnace General Store expecting to not see any hikers facing down their ice cream dreams and nightmares. Instead, three different groups sat around three different tables, watching a few brave/unlucky souls try to earn their wooden spoons.
I barely recognized two of the groups, but one group included the Aussie, the unfriendly 20-something from two days ago, a bearded bald guy who’d given me the death stare as I’d passed his camp yesterday, a young woman who sat in the Caledonia State Park conference room for two hours with Northstar yesterday afternoon, Nearly Naked Nurse, a hiker I hadn’t seen since Erwin (my name for him since I couldn’t remember his trail name – he always hiked shirtless with tiny shorts and works as a travel nurse), and a few others from their demographic.
I waved as I walked in, but got no response from anyone, so I continued on to where Northstar was waiting in the van. Apparently, she’d gotten ghosted as well. I’ve gotten used to that treatment from that crowd, but it still bothers her, so she’d retreated to the van. We leashed up Gus, grabbed our laptops, and claimed a table to watch the celebrations and make use of the free Wi-Fi.
Forget-Me-Not
All told, about a dozen thru hikers sat down, but only a handful took the challenge. None of them looked particularly celebratory as they either quit or triumphed. After all but the last stragglers left, a woman walked in, dropped her pack at the table next to us, pulled out a very wet tent, and spread it out on the grass to dry. Then she quietly walked into the store and came out with a half-gallon of ice cream.
Without a word, she peeled off the lid, pulled out her titanium camp spoon and went to work. Northstar gave her a smile and asked if she was thru hiking. The woman smiled back and soon they were trading stories and grandkid pics in between ice cream bites.
And what a story we heard. Forget-Me-Not, a grandma-aged thru hiker, walking mostly by herself, will be 10 years sober when she summits Katahdin this fall. She’d never backpacked before this trip, and except for a story from her sponsor, had never even heard of the Appalachian Trail before this year. Remarkable.
By the time she finished the challenge, as unassumingly as she’d walked in and sat down, she had a crowd of supporters cheering her on and peppering her with questions about thru hiking.
What a contrast with the louder crowd who’d announced themselves, met no one they didn’t already know, and left only to the relief of those who’d endured their visit. A lesson for all thru hikers.
Post-Scripts & Questions Answered
I finished Project Hail Mary yesterday, an excellent listen. I started Will Wight’s Unsouled, Book one of the Cradle Series. I’m not as excited about this one yet, but we’ll see. It is a very long green tunnel.Northstar’s antibiotics (doxycycline) seem to be working. No other symptoms so far. Thanks for all the prayers and good wishes.Gus takes tick medication and gets Permethrin treatments. The ticks that bite him die, but he seems to bring home live ones in his hair which fall out in the van. Hence, his banishment from the trail. He’s definitely pouting.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666707,"Half Done
Question: What do you do when you’re half done with a huge task?
Answer: The same thing you did every day before you were half done.
I slammed the van door shut at exactly 6:01 am and headed north from the Pine Grove Furnace General Store. Walking out of the Park, I realized I’d forgotten to go to the Appalachian Trail Museum or take a swim in Fuller Lake. I did manage to feed myself, get some sleep, and gear up for today’s hike. So, all in all, I did well enough to keep moving north.
The AT’s Meseta
Northstar and I hiked the Camino de Santiago (Frances Route) with our youngest son in 2017. That Camino route starts just north of the Spain (Basque)-France border in the Pyrenees and crosses northern Spain to the city of Santiago in the Galician highlands. The trail begins and ends in mountainous terrain, with a pancake flat section in the middle called the Meseta.
Pilgrims on the Camino moan about crossing the Meseta, which can be hot, windless, monotonous, and punishing. Or, depending on your perspective, full of beautiful farmland, old villas, crumbling ruins, and historical cathedrals and churches, as well as hot, windless, and punishing.
I’m starting to think Pennsylvania is the AT’s Meseta. It’s certainly not flat, but it is bookended by more exciting terrain to the north and south. And the rocks, heat, humidity, poison ivy, ticks, and many road crossings don’t exactly add to Pennslyvania’s “Wow!” factor.
I liked Spain’s Meseta. I also enjoyed driving across Kansas and Nebraska on our coast-to-coast trip. I had fun seeing the west Texas on our drive to Georgia this spring. And I find something to love every day in Pennsylvania. We’ve also met a lot of nice locals. But I find myself looking forward to bigger mountains and cooler weather up north.
A Miles on Trail Day
Putting on my best Meseta attitude, I set out to log some miles and move north. The trail started out flat, climbed into some hills for most of the day, then descended into the rolling farm fields surrounding the town of Boiling Springs.
I passed Hoodie near the first climb of the day, calling him by name as I approached. He turned, recognized me, and called out, “Good morning … [longish pause] … Incident.” Win. He said he planned a short day, leaving him a nearo into Carlisle tomorrow to meet his family and take a motel night. After a nice chat, I moved on. I think his normal pace is about 2/3’s of my morning pace.
I didn’t see any other thru hikers besides Hoodie all day. All the others must have been recovering from the half-gallon challenge or sitting out the heat, humidity, and the forecasted afternoon thunderstorms. Even without a weather forecast, I could feel the humidity ramping up all morning. It felt as if the sky was going to explode.
Rain
Just as I stopped for lunch, the sky started rumbling with distant thunder. Close enough to let me know I’d be wet before I got to Boiling Springs, but far enough to politely let me finish my lunch. Hoodie came hustling by as I packed up, demonstrating that he did have another gear, and shouted that he’d decided to make a run for the nearest shelter to wait out the storm, then head for Carlisle tonight instead of tomorrow.
He invited me to run for the shelter with him, but I kind of wanted the shower. Needed the shower. I stunk, my clothes stunk, and salt crystals had started growing in every sweaty crevice. I got my shower.
The tree canopy kept me mostly dry for about 30 minutes until the rain intensified, coinciding almost exactly with when I walked out of the woods and into the farm fields around surrounding Boiling Springs. Then, I got soaked. I thought I’d been wet before along the trail, but today’s soaking was a whole new level of wet.
It turns out I like walking in the rain. Or at least I like walking in a cool rain on a warm day when I know I’m heading toward a (relatively) dry van and a fluffy towel. I walked for nearly two hours in the rain. After a while, you don’t get any wetter, but you do get cleaner.
Rain Gear
Which brings me to a reader’s question about rain gear. Yes, I almost always carry a waterproof rain jacket (REI brand) and pants (Marmot), as well as a rain hat (Outdoor Research). But I rarely put them on while hiking. Here are the conditions in which I wear my rain gear:
If it’s cold enough that I might get hypothermic, I’ll wear just enough rain gear to regulate my body temperature. Hypothermia can sneak up on you, so anything below pleasantly cool might mean it’s time to gear up.When it’s hot (and humid), putting on waterproof rain gear, even breathable Gortex, will make me wetter from sweat than from a light rain. Usually, I just let myself get a free shower on hot rainy days.Sometimes, I’ll swap out my hat, unzip or zip up my jacket, or change my underlayers in response to changing air temperatures and rainfall intensity. It’s best to keep the rain gear where you can get at it or stow it easily.It’s more important to stay dry if you’re living in a small tent. In the van, I have more dry clothes options than most backpackers, so I don’t mind getting wet. Wet clothes in a tent generally means a wet sleeping bag, sooner or later.At Camp. If I walk in the rain when I’m backpacking and arrive at camp soaked, I’ll sometimes switch into my rain gear once I get to camp and I cool down, putting on a dry layer underneath.
Rain gear can also serve as survival gear, so it’s definitely worth its pack weight. Thanks for the question.
Boiling Springs
I arrived in Boiling Springs wet and happy. Northstar pulled up a short time later, saying she had found a legal boondocking spot at the Mechanicsburg Walmart. I guess my second half of this hike starts with Walmart.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666796,"AT Dreams
My original AT dreams didn’t envision waking up in a Walmart parking lot. But Boiling Springs didn’t offer any good boondocking sites and Northstar wanted to visit the Mechanicsburg REI. Plus, Walmart offered cleanish bathrooms, free parking, and excellent cell service with which to stay on top our daughter’s situation back home.
So, this morning I climbed out of the van to a colorful sunrise over the Sam’s Club gas pumps and started my day. Yesterday’s rain continued into the evening, so I pulled on soggy pants and squishy shoes, starting out wet and likely to only get wetter with sweat as the day heated up.
On deck today was about 13 miles of relatively flat, open farm walking, followed by another 3.5 miles over one woody ridge to PA 840. Once there, I’d decide whether to add another 10 miles into Duncannon.
Farm Walking
I think I remember wishing that the AT would explore other parts of the Appalachians besides the tree-covered hills. Today, I got my wish.
I left Boiling Springs around 7:00 am under the last vestiges of yesterday’s rain clouds. After a half-mile of road walking, the trail turned off into a narrow wooded area between farm fields. I spent the next 13 miles plunging into the dripping wet woods and emerging minutes later into gentle rolling hills thick with corn, beans, wheat, and hay.
The slick, muddy trail recorded at least one hiker ahead of me, as well as the passing of racoons and possibly a bear during the night. But I saw no one, and walked alone past family farms, some which looked prosperous and well-kept, and others that looked as if the end was near. Just past the edge of one field, I stopped to take in the Chambers family cemetery with weather-worn gravestones dating to the mid-1800’s.
In another wooded section, I passed very near what I hope was a shooting range. I heard a lot of gunfire but saw no branches or leaves cracking overhead. I’ve been (unintentionally) shot at before while hiking and canoeing and know that the only thing to do is either sit it out behind something solid or keep low and get the heck out of Dodge. This time, I chose the latter.
The sun came out by mid-morning, making the farm scenery even more picturesque. But the sunshine also ramped up the heat and humidity, making me appreciate the shaded sections of trail. I probably wouldn’t sign up for 2198.4 miles of farm walking, but today’s path was a welcome break from the long green tunnel.
More Trail Encounters
Just before the I-81 crossing, I walked up on a farm stand selling fruit, vegetables, and other farm products. The produce looked fantastic, but I had no interest in hauling zucchinis the next 10 miles. But fresh, homemade chocolate milk in a glass bottle with a foil lid? I had just enough cash for that and more than enough nostalgia and appetite. Break time.
Jake Tucker. As I walked into the farm stand, a thru hiker walked out carrying his purchases. I’d seen this guy three times in the last three days. The first time, I passed him as he stood by his tent early one morning. I’d smiled and waved silently because of the hour, but he just stared at me intently with no response as I walked past. He was also part of the Pine Grove Furnace crowd. And he ghosted me when I passed him midday yesterday.
Today, he walked out of the farm stand shirtless, despite the No Shirt-No Service sign, which no doubt the 10-year boy running the register was too intimidated to enforce. I gave him a smile and asked, “Hey! How’s your hike going?” All I got was a grunt.
When I came out with my chocolate milk, I sat down across the picnic table and tried again. No response. He got up and left. That’s a little weird, right? I don’t know, maybe he’s hearing impaired. Maybe I stink worse than I think.
But we all know what happens to unfriendly people who don’t say hi and tell me their trail name…I get to name them. This one’s Jake Tucker, after the Simpsons character with the upside-down head. My Jake Tucker has a flowing beard and shiny dome. You shoulda said hi, Jake.
Gabby. As I left the farm stand and crossed the I-81 Bridge, I saw a young woman hiking toward me. This made four days in a row we’d crossed paths, and each time she was hiking south and carrying a mostly empty pack. The first time, I noticed her because she wore unwieldy hiking clothes. But I didn’t say anything because she seemed to be making a point of avoiding eye contact.
The second time, she passed silently again, giving me a déjà vu feeling. After she was gone, I remembered seeing her the previous day.
The third day, I saw her coming up a climb towards me and stepped aside to yield to the uphill hiker. As she passed, I caught her eye and asked: “Have I seen you slacking southbound three days in a row?” She walked right by, saying “Yes” as she strode by. Heck of a storyteller, that one, which earned her the name Gabby.
Today, as she approached, I simply held up four fingers to indicate this was the fourth time. I could see in her eyes she recognized me, but she mistook my gesture and gives me a girly, wiggly, four-finger wave. So, I silently mouth the word “Four” at her and hiked on past. She got it, but didn’t stop, and I didn’t say anything either. I’m playing the long game. There’s a story there and I will eventually learn it.
Jake Tucker, Part II. Just after I crossed the bridge, I caught a glimpse of Jake Tucker in the distance. This is Tour de France season, so I knew what I had to do. Thirty minutes later, I had reeled him in. As I approached, he looked over his shoulder and saw a white-haired old man bearing down on him, but he couldn’t hold me off for long. The shock in his eyes was a thing of beauty.
I thought about giving him the Lance Armstrong-Jan Ulrich “Look” as I passed, but I didn’t want to crush his spirit or be responsible for him quitting the trail. At least that’s how it went in my mind. In reality, I smiled and said, “See you down the trail.” He nodded silently in reply.
Heated Decisions
Northstar was waiting in the van at the PA 840 crossing parking lot when I arrived shortly after noon. She had the AC running but was losing the battle against the increasing heat and humidity. The forecast called for highs near 90F, with evening thundershowers.
I had the legs to make to Duncannon, but not the need. I’d checked the maps and the extra 10 miles didn’t help my itinerary for the rest of the week. I didn’t really want to hike in the heat. And if I sat out the mid-day sun, I’d hike the rocky section to Duncannon in the rain.
So, happy with 16.5-mile day, we drove over to the Church Hostel in Duncannon and hung out in the air-conditioned basement, took a shower, and used the free WiFi. That evening, as we left town to head back to the trailhead, I passed a couple I’d seen on the 1,000-foot climb before PA 840 walking down Main Street. It had taken them about seven hours to do the 10 miles into Duncannon, which made me glad I’d save that hike for tomorrow morning.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666828,"Groundhog Day
Am I anywhere near Punxsutawney? Because I’m starting to feel like I’m living the same day over and over again. I woke up early, headed out at dawn to try to beat the heat and humidity, and spent the day in the deep green woods. I think I’ve done that before. At least once.
As a matter of fact, I did hike the first half of today’s itinerary before, in 2017, with my sister (Chompers), her husband (Cuddles), and Northstar, when we’d all come east for our nephew’s (Pincushion) wedding. Ok, I made up their trail names, because that’s the kind of thing little brothers do.
Except for my nephew’s – he earned his trail name when he and his brother (The Duke of Hurl) came out to Arizona for a little backpacking before he got married. It turned out he had an affinity for finding cacti with his feet. And his brother ate something that didn’t like him and wanted out. Collectively, I called them “The Nephewlim,” a reference to their gigantic size that some of you will get. But I digress.
Rocksylvania
I keep hearing that the notorious Pennsylvania rocks are just ahead. And I’d read online that the hike into Duncannon is one of the rockier sections in the State. I didn’t remember it as being particularly rocky the last time I hiked it, but at that time I’d been hiking in central Arizona in the months before I got here.
I suspect that my training trails back home are as rocky as anything in Pennsylvania, and that the soft trails on the AT south of Rocksylvania contribute to its reputation. Maybe Pennsylvania is only rocky compared to the southern AT. I guess I’ll find out soon enough.
At this point, I’m halfway through Pennsylvania and haven’t seen anything that much tougher than what Maryland and Virginia doled out in their worst sections. At least the Pennsylvania trails have been pretty well groomed, unlike the rocky, overgrown trail near Pearisburg, Virginia.
What’s the Fuss?
At some level, the entire AT is rocky. I doubt I’ve walked a day without risking breaking a toe, twisting an ankle, or tripping over a rock. There have been plenty of boulder fields, rock rivers, rock outcrops, and rogue toebusters everywhere. But from what I’ve read, what separates Pennsylvania from the rest of the AT are long, continuous miles of rocky terrain.
On the miles-long rocky sections I’ve already walked, it’s been the cumulative effect having to constantly watch your foot placement, thinking about every step, ready to respond immediately if you slip, slide, or roll. It gives as much mental aasnd physical fatigure. Plus, trekking pole tips have a way of catching in between rocks, yanking your arm back and throwing you off balance. And finally, all-day-long repeated jarring your foot bones on rock leaves your feet tender and painful.
A day of rocky terrain is tough. Weeks of rocky terrain can push you over the edge, especially if you’re trying to do hero miles to get north as quickly as possible.
But I guess that the “real” rocks are still coming. Today’s hike was rocky, but nothing I haven’t already seen.
Duncannon
I walked into Duncannon just before 9:00 am and called Northstar to see if she’d like join me for second breakfast. She did, so I hung out at Veterans Park while she drove over.
The AT goes right through Duncannon, passing along Main Street through the length of the town, putting it in the same category of trail towns as Hot Springs and Damascus.
Duncannon is also the home to the Doyle Hotel, which once was a seedy, dilapidated, dive famous for cheap beer and burgers, as well as truly awful rooms. The old timers told stories of five-dollar hotel rooms illuminated only by bare light bulbs you needed to check out from the front desk, windows and doors that wouldn’t shut properly, and bare mattresses on the floor for beds.
Those days are gone, but they aren’t that far gone. Duncannon tries very hard but doesn’t have the resources of other well-known trail towns. Like much of the rest of rural Pennsylvania, Duncannon is struggling.
But, to be honest, I felt more welcome as a thru hiker in Duncannon than anywhere else on the AT. Our waiter at Goodies, a dumpy looking breakfast restaurant with excellent food (they gave me an extra egg and double home fries!), was friendly and took the time to swap travel stories. A complete stranger invited everyone at the free, always-open, Assembly of God Hiker Hostel up to swim in his pool.
I walked out of Duncannon fatter and happier than when I arrived.
Back to the Tunnel
The trail out of Duncannon crosses two long bridges over the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers, then crosses a busy highway and heads back up a rocky ridge into the woods. The climb up from the highway is steep and, according to online chatter, not well maintained, so many hikers take a blue-blazed short-cut that shaves off a mile of climbing.
The main trail promised several views of the river valleys, so I took the purist route. However, I discovered that the views were what I call “Realtor Views” rather than real views. Realtor views are what you read in property listings where “ocean view” really means that if you stand in the corner of the lot leaning over the neighbor’s fence and the wind blows just right, you sometimes catch a glimpse of the ocean through the trees. But such is the price of purity.
Magic
I’d heard from Psyops, who I unexpectedly saw at the church hostel, that someone planned trail magic at Peters Mountain Road this afternoon. Sure enough, as I crossed the pedestrian bridge into the parking area, Northstar and Gus were sitting in a group of hikers at the back of Twizzler’s SUV. She introduced me to Tiger, Hot Americano, Queso, Mystery Otter, Masters, and some others whose names escape me.
I’d seen all of them before, but not since April at the Icewater Shelter in the Smoky’s. I hadn’t met them then, but I remembered hearing Mystery Otter’s name. We all chatted some at the trail magic today, but I think the climb, the rocks, the humidity, and the prospect of more miles put everyone in a business-only mood. We ate, drank the cold beverages, and moved on.
After they left, I talked with Twizzler, a member of the local ATC chapter. When I told him of my plans for a 25-mile day tomorrow, he shook his head and said that the first nine miles to PA 325 would be a pleasant walk, but after that the rocks, climbs, and lack of water might make it unbearable. I briefly considered knocking out the nine-mile section tonight, but after learning from him that there was no parking or cell coverage at PA 325, I elected to stick with my plan and just tough it out tomorrow.
Boondocking at Peters Mountain Road
We planned to camp at the trailhead. Once Twizzler packed up and left, we had the parking area to ourselves. For an hour.
At 5:00, cars started rolling in until the parking lot was completely full. An older woman walked over to hint that we might want to leave as she was hosting a memorial hike for her son. She also said we shouldn’t be afraid of them. What? Why would we be afraid?
We passed on our condolences but elected to stay put, though the tough-looking crowd had Northstar (and Gus) on alert. Our daughter, who works in law enforcement, tells me that outdoor funerals sometimes get out of hand and have a surprising number of shootings and brawls. Looking around, I could see what she meant. I grew up around these guys.
But everyone played nice. Either the hike and humidity took the salt out of them, or they only looked rough. Either way, the parking lot was clear by 9:30 pm and stayed that way until 4:30 the next morning when the uber-hiker/trail runner crowd started showing up.
Odds & Ends
Our daughter’s health situation seems to have stabilized, which is a load off our minds.I finished Book One (of 10) of the Cradle series. On to Book Two.
To combat the Meseta Blues, I’m thinking of ways to up the entertainment factor, but I’m not sure what that will look like. Every hiker I meet is looking a little strung out and I supposed I look that way too. Fortunately, the day after tomorrow is a zero day.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666859,"Butterflies
I woke up nervous about today’s hike. At 24.9 miles, it would be my longest day yet. Twizzler, the guy from the local ATC Chapter at yesterday’s trail magic, said I was in for a doozy of hike. He said the first nine miles would be a pleasant walk, but after I crossed PA 325 I’d face a steep climb and 16 miles of rocks with no water, no cell coverage, and no exits. Also, he thought the recent storms might have washed out the beaver dam crossing at Stony Creek.
While I made my morning oatmeal, I told myself that 24.9 miles is well within my strike zone. My Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim hikes were longer, hotter, and had much more elevation gain. I’ve run a marathon, though that was 20 years ago. I’ve been training for this for three months. I’ve got this.
But what about the rocks? The Rim-to-Rim hikes are rocky, but they aren’t boulder hopping. Twenty-five miles of boulder hopping would be exhausting. I considered hiking just the nine miles to PA 325 and saving the hard part for tomorrow, sacrificing my planned zero day. I’m 62 years old and hiking alone. I should act like it.
In the end I just decided to go for it. Maybe I’d survive. Maybe I’d get a good story out of being rescued.
Never Believe What You Hear. Usually.
Twizzler was wrong about almost everything. I had decent cell coverage at PA 325. The climb up from PA 325 to the ridgeline was no problem. I crossed at least a dozen decent water sources in the last 16 miles. The beaver dam crossing looked exactly as described in FarOut comments from two weeks ago.
And the rocks? Twizzler had that backwards. The nine-mile walk from Peters Mountain Road to PA 325 was much rockier than the 16-mile section from there to Green Point School Road, but it wasn’t any rockier than the rockiest parts of the other states I’ve hiked through so far. In fact, parts of those last 16 miles were some of the best walking I’ve done yet. More on that in a second.
Advice From Another Local
I didn’t see a single hiker on the trail all morning. After lunch, I ran across a guy standing on a ladder taking wooden trail signs off a tree. He greeted me, so I stopped to chat. He said he’d made all the wooden signs for the local ATC Chapter and the tree had started to eat these, so he was replacing them.
I thanked him for the trail maintenance and commented on how nice the trail had been, especially since I’d been expecting endless rocks. He told me that almost everything I’d walked on since crossing PA 325 had been a stagecoach road between mining camps in the 1800’s. There had even been a resort along the route.
We chatted for another 15 minutes before I left him to his work. I heard about his 19-year AT section hike and answered the usual question about my small pack. As I left, he told me that the real rocky section would start on Blue Mountain in a few days and would extend along that ridge all the way into New Jersey. We’ll see. I’m skeptical.
Stony Creek Beaver Dam Crossing
I had no idea that any beaver dam crossings existed along the AT south of Vermont until Twizzler mentioned it yesterday. But when I reached Rausch Gap, trail signs pointed at a longer, blue-blazed, dry route around a beaver dam. I didn’t even consider it. I had no interest in additional miles and had a keen interest in seeing if Twizzler got something right. He didn’t.
I didn’t see an actual beaver dam, as it was probably well downstream of the AT crossing, but there was plenty of beaver activity, as well as a wide marshy floodplain typical of beaver habitat. The trail wandered into the marsh and then disappeared under water. In its place were several hundred feet of floating beaver-gnawed logs that hikers could potentially balance on and pick their way across. Or they could just dive in and wade.
I elected to try balancing my way across. It worked pretty well until one log started rolling under me. I did my best Minnesota lumberjack impression, walking the rolling log from end to end, and successfully hopping off it onto a much bigger, anchored log. And then I fell off the 2.5-foot diameter, totally stable log. Fortunately, only one foot got wet and even that had been wetter after the downpour walking into Boiling Springs two days ago. I made it the rest of the way across without incident.
Old Friends
I’d seen Tiger and Americano across Stony Creek just I started my crossing, but they were long gone by the time I got to the other side. I caught Americano on the next climb and then Tiger and Mystery Otter a few minutes after that. I was 22 miles into my day and they were the first thru hikers I’d seen.  Just as I caught the rest of their group, I saw “Bells,” a little dog Gus and I had met back in North Carolina and hadn’t seen since.
Suddenly, it was old home week. As we walked, we talked about our hikes since North Carolina, hikers we knew, gear, Pennsylvania rocks, and our itineraries. I found out Mystery Otter had hiked the PCT in 2021 and is planning to complete his triple crown in 2026. The tramily thing seems to be working for them. They’ve weathered plenty of challenges together and are still talking to each other. Well done.
We talked right up to Green Point School Road where Northstar waited for me in the van. The tramily had a few more miles planned and hiked on. I said I’d be taking a zero day tomorrow but would look for them down the trail. They planned to zero in Pine Grove on Friday. Perhaps we’ll meet again.
 Odds and Ends
For some reason, I really loved the woods today. They had an inviting lightness that was somehow encouraging, despite having been extensively mined and deforested in the past. They gave me a strange sense of anticipation of something good coming my way.The gnats are out. According to my extensive research, Pennsylvania gnats prefer eyelids and ear canals. A few kamikaze gnats flew in my piehole and got stuck on my tonsils. Coughing, drinking, and gargling do not remove tonsil gnats. Eating Clif bars does. Just so you know.I briefly thought about asking Northstar to meet me another 1.3 miles down the trail so I could bag a marathon day. Briefly.Zero Day tomorrow. Woot, woot!

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666918,"Just Enough Ado About Nothing
Northstar surprised me with an awesome AirBnB located just a few miles from the Green Point School Road trailhead. We stayed in the basement level of a large A-frame cabin built at the base of Blue Mountain, the allegedly rocky ridge I’d be hiking next. We had air conditioning, a shower, room for Gus to run, a washing machine, clean sheets, and a pool. What more could we ask for?
Funny you should ask. The host left a basket of salty snacks on the table and a frozen pizza in the fridge, all of which I vacuumed up in no time. Same for the frosted beer mugs in the freezer.
Best of all, it was country quiet – birds, a distant lawn mower, and nothing else. Northstar snoozed, and I sat on the shaded porch swing and threw Gus’ lacrosse ball out into the five-acre lawn. Perfect.
We never left the property.

Today’s forecast called for heat, humidity, and early afternoon thunderstorms. It delivered on two of three. I’d planned a 22.6-mile day, rejecting the shorter 13-mile option as inconsistent with my goal of getting out of Pennsylvania in six days.
Halfway up the 1,000-foot climb that kicked off the day, so drenched in sweat I looked as if I’d just been rained on, I started reviewing my options. But I went on, counting on the afternoon showers to wash me off again.
Finally, Some Rocks
When I crested the Blue Mountain Ridge, I finally hit some long patches of rocks. Midway through the first big rock river, I caught up to a day hiker slowly picking his way across the minefield. He looked up, completely frustrated, and asked how long I thought the rocks would last. I just laughed, and said, “Sir, I have no idea. I’ve heard everything from ‘there aren’t any rocks’ to ‘the rocks will last into New Jersey.’ I’m just going to keep going north until they’re gone.”
I don’t think I helped him.
But as a matter of fact, none of the rockiest patches lasted that long. And the majority of the trail was no rockier than it had been yesterday or the day before.
I also discovered I have a pretty decent rock-walking technique developed from 40 years of hiking rocky central Arizona trails and a career of fieldwork in bouldery streams. Whenever possible, I only step on the biggest, most stable rocks. I avoid the wet, smooth, and sloped ones. And I keep moving. Above all, I keep my eyes on my feet and never forget that one bad step can end my hike.
Normal Stuff
I took a break near the turn off to the William Penn Shelter (or as Seri calls it, the William Pennsylvania Shelter) to decide if I needed to make the downhill trek to a spring to refill my water supply. A pair of young thru hikers came up the side trail, but didn’t see me, and went north. I like having other hikers out front, as it motivates me to keep moving. So, I gave them a decent head start, and set out again.
Unfortunately, they stopped 15 minutes later to talk to another hiker, ending the chase. I nodded silently as I passed, but they stopped me for a little trailside palaver. What a pleasant surprise. We talked about the alleged rocks, agreeing that they hadn’t been particularly bad yet and that we’d all heard that the really rocky section was still coming.
Personally, I’ve started to think that we’ll be met at the PA/NJ border by ATC agents in dark suits and sunglasses. They’ll be hosting trail magic where they’ll feed us spiked drinks and will program us to repeat the lie that Pennsylvania is rocky.
The trio of thru hikers cheerfully volunteered their trail names (Lucky McShorts, Goldie, and Builder(? – I didn’t catch that one due to his Belgian accent), and then asked for mine. A normal trail interaction. Was that so hard? Not wanting to press my luck, after chatting briefly, I said goodbye and moved on.
Trail Magic. Real Trail Magic.
A day hiker coming south gave me the heads up that a church group was doing trail magic at PA 501. I no longer needed a rabbit to chase. I put it in high gear and headed for free food and cold drinks. I hadn’t seen a real hiker feed since April.
I walked up to PA 501 to find shade tents, sack chairs, a choice of eggs and sausages or chili dogs, coolers of ice water and sodas, and tables of snacks and cookies. They even had power banks for charging phones and were offering rides into town for anyone who wanted them. Chumbawumba was there, who I hadn’t seen since Tennessee. She remembered my name even though I’d forgotten hers.
Lucky McShorts, Goldie, and Builder walked in a few minutes later and we all sat there stuffing ourselves, talking, and enjoying the shade while the magicians waited on us. Clearly, I’ve found myself in some kind of weird friendly vortex.
Wrapping Up
I left the trail magic energized, refreshed, and ready to knock out the last nine miles to PA 183. I rolled up to the PA 183 parking area around 4:00 pm. Northstar had just pulled in, had the AC cranked, and had stocked cold La Croix in the freezer. The trailhead was posted for no parking, but she had found a nice spot just down the road that was flatter, quieter, and safer.
Oh, yeah. I passed the 1,200-mile marker today. Twice. There are two of them, a couple hundred yards apart. Plus, a 1,201-mile marker. I figured someone missed the first two but still wanted a photo opportunity and didn’t want to fake it.
Life is good.

How do you break a rock blocking your path? You don’t. Just go around it.
What if it’s thousands of rocks sticking pointy side up in your path? Same answer.
More Rocks
Pennsylvania’s rocks finally showed up yesterday, had a great time, and decided to stick around for another day. I think my Altra’s soles are starting to break down because after an hour I started feeling every rock I found.
I’d hoped that this pair would last until New Jersey, since they only have about 300 miles on them. Pay It Forward, the triple crowner I met around mile 500, told me that “when your feet hurt in the afternoon, it’s time to think about getting new shoes. When they hurt in the morning, get new shoes.” It’s almost time to dig out a new pair, but I’m not sure even a new pair is the cure for these rocks.
Less Rocks
About five miles into the hike I crossed a well-graded gravel road. I stopped to look at my map app and noticed that the AT ran parallel to the road for about three miles. The AT was rocky. The road was very smooth. The AT ran through the gnat-infested long green tunnel. The road lay under the blue sky where a gentle breeze and the bright sun kept the gnats away. The AT was narrow and overgrown. The road was wide and clear.
Both ran through the same woods, were closed to wheeled traffic, and sat atop the same long mountain ridge. The weather was the same – hot and humid. Both would get me to Port Clinton.
I took the road.
If Less Rocks is Good, More Less Rocks is More Betterer
For three miles on the gravel road, I cruised along at top speed. Just before the road teed back into the AT, I noticed that another, slightly less well-maintained forest road branched off to the right. That road paralleled the AT for another five miles, ending just before the AT dove off the ridge on the steep descent into Port Clinton. Why not?
I knocked out the eight miles of dirt road walking in just over two hours. When I set out this morning at 6:00 am, my goal was to reach Port Clinton by noon. By the time I rejoined the AT, I was set to get to our meet up point on the other side of Port Clinton by 11:00 am. Even betterer.
Lynx
On the steep, 1,000-foot descent to the Schuykill River, I overtook a backpacker who called out something that sounded like “You don’t have to eat my shi*.” He hadn’t looked back and appeared to be shouting to someone ahead of him. I have some hearing loss. Sometimes what I hear is entertaining, but not at all what was said. So, I asked him if he was talking to me, and if so, could he repeat that.
He did. It sounded like what I had thought because that’s exactly what he said. I replied, “I should hope not.” But from the context, I figured that must be some hip way to say I could pass him. I did.
As I passed, we exchanged friendly greetings, i.e., like normal people, and he asked me something about berries, which led to a conversation. Somewhere along the way, he mentioned that he planned to walk into Hamburg to resupply, and I told him he was welcome to ride with us. So, we walked along together for the next mile and a half amiably chatting.
Lynx has led an interesting life. He’s traveled extensively, hiked all over the US, has never driven a car, loves dogs, has a nice girlfriend, lived in Phoenix for a time, was born in Cleveland, and knows tons of information about edible plants, especially mushrooms. He says he’s worked extensively in the cannabis industry, but only long enough to earn enough for his next adventure. I know all this and more from a 30-minute conversation.
The Point
If I had walked past Lynx in Portland where he lives “rent-free” part of the year, I doubt we’d notice each other. But here we are in the woods, sharing the same adventure. Here, we have the time, opportunity, and common ground to meet and get know people we might otherwise never speak to.
When I grouse about not connecting with people I see on the trail, it’s not because I want to bully people into conforming to my behavioral ideals. It’s mostly because I want to hear people’s stories. I want to hear about their experiences on the AT, what they’ve learned, and why they’re out here. Every person that passes me without a word is a book I don’t get to read.
I’m not an idiot. I get that some people don’t want to talk to strangers, especially to people who look like me. I get that people have different privacy settings. Most people I pass get and give no more than a head nod and a hello, which is perfectly fine. But when I see the same people day after day, knowing that they love (or hate) such an important thing like the AT as much as I do, I have to at least try to make a connection.
Whenever I get the cold shoulder or when people are downright rude, it surprises me, though it probably shouldn’t at this stage of my life. So, when that happens to me on the trail, my way of putting it behind me and letting it go is to sometimes invent little games to amuse myself, like giving them silly names, or imagining we’re competitors in a race. I'm not upset. It doesn't ruin my day. My “victims” don’t even know I’m playing these games. I share these stories to entertain you, to illustrate how I'm coping, and because there’s only so much I can say about green leaves, brown tree trunks, and rocks.
I’m just playing. I spend six to ten hours alone every day. It gets lonely.
De-Purifying Lynx
Talking with Lynx as we walked through the busy metropolis of Port Clinton, I went right past a turn in the AT. After dodging semi’s along the shoulder of PA 61 for a few hundred yards, I realized I must have made a mistake, so I asked Lynx if he was a purist. “What’s a purist?”, he asked. Boy, did he ask the wrong guy.
I explained briefly and I told him I’d go back with him if he wanted. He decided that he must be a purist because he hadn’t skipped any sections of the trail yet. But then he decided that he’d catch that segment when he came back out after hitting the Walmart in Hamburg. We’ll see. If he doesn’t, I’ll proudly hang his purist scalp from my belt. Another one bites the dust.
We drove Lynx to Walmart, but he decided that he’d rather ride along with us to Starbucks. He didn’t seem the Starbucks type, but whatever. Then said that he preferred Starbucks because they have very hot water in the restrooms, which he liked for washing out his socks. So, I guess we also helped re-purify him too. And maybe I just gave you a reason to not use the Starbucks restroom sinks.

Sorry about that. But it ends well. Maybe not today, but eventually.
On a Bender
The Pennsylvania Appalachian Trail went out drinking Saturday night and had a little too much. After a hot, sweaty evening pounding shots with its crew – humidity, rocks, rain, pointy rocks, and ticks – it stumbled back to our campsite and threw up on us all night. Rain, that is. It had nothing left by morning but woke up sick and irritable with a nasty hangover, and angry about something I’d written.
Apologies were useless. Out of sheer cussedness, the AT dumped more rain, humidity, rocks, ticks, and poison ivy on my all morning.
The Downside of Vanlife
We love our van. I remember waking up one snowy morning in Utah, surrounded by tent campers in puffies and wool hats trying to shovel snow off their picnic tables and get their Coleman stoves lit. We watched them struggle until the microwave dinged letting me know my tea was hot. Ah, roughing it.
Van camping is fantastic. Except when it’s hot and rainy, there’s no electrical hookup, and you’ve been running the AC off the solar batteries all afternoon. Under those conditions, the van becomes a very expensive tent with absolutely no ventilation. Last night was that kind of night.
I woke up early. And by “woke up,” I mean I stopped pretending to sleep. Northstar had been getting up to soak her shirt in the sink every few hours and got a little more sleep than I did. She looked great. My eyes were bloodshot and puffy, my hair stuck out in all directions, and I had no color.
While Northstar headed into Walmart to use the facilities, Gus and I climbed into the front seats, fired up the engine, and cranked the AC. Gus stuck his face right in front of one of the vents and looked over and said, “I’m staying in today. Have a good hike out there.”
The Pennsylvania Blues
I’ve got the Pennsylvania Blues. I’m so sick of the humidity. I’m tired of sweat-soaked clothes. And smelly, sweat-soaked clothes. And even more tired of chaffing from my smelly, sweat-soaked clothes. I hate being able to see the moisture-saturated air. It’s so humid that I can’t use my iPhone by mid-morning because my thumbs are too sweaty for the touchscreen, and I have no clothes dry enough to wipe them off. How do easterners live like this?
I’m fine with the rocks. I’ll walk on them, avoid them, bypass them, curse them – whatever it takes. I can avoid the ticks and the poison ivy. I’m not loving the viewless ridge walks through long green tunnel, but I’m used to them. The humidity, however, is gonna push me over the edge. Maybe it already has.
On the Trail
I took my bad attitude back to the trail at Port Clinton and I started the 1,000-foot climb back to the top of yet another long, rocky ridge. Wisps of fog hung between the dripping trees along the steep, rocky trail. On a cooler day, I’d have found the ambiance enchanting, mystical, and inspiring. Today, as once again, my sweat-soaked shirt clung to my skin and my drenched pants stuck to my thighs, and I carefully picked my way through the wet rocks, I had no kind thoughts about Pennsylvania.
Feeling Blue
I slogged along for five miles until the trail crossed Reservoir Road. A quick look at FarOut indicated a Blue Blaze option along the Reservoir that cut off four miles of the official AT. The AT makes one of those weird horseshoe-shaped loops, presumably to pick up viewpoints at Pulpit Rock and The Pinnacle. I only had 14.5 miles planned for today, so I didn’t need to shave any miles. Blue blazes don’t tempt me if they miss notable views or other landmarks.
But then I looked up at the fog and rain clouds clinging to the ridge. There would be no views today and the rocky trail leading to them would be wet and slippery. Plus, the description of the viewpoints included warnings about copperhead sightings. And I think I mentioned that I might have been in a bit of a mood.
The FarOut description mentioned that the blue blaze option used to be the official AT alignment, as if to appease the purists looking for an excuse to shorten their day. I’m no purist, so that excuse would not work for me. As a committed impurist, I need no excuse to blue blaze, but I was still conflicted.
I even investigated whether cutting out four miles would let me bag some extra miles today that might shorten our stay in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, unless I was willing to commit to three 25-mile days in a row, four miles wouldn’t help.
As I pondered, I checked the weather forecast. Sure enough, it would be raining and cloudy all day, guaranteeing no view and miserable trail conditions. Then I noticed that the rain, heat, and humidity would continue through the night, which meant another stifling night in the ProMaster sauna.
Blue Blazing
Northstar texted me that the caretaker wouldn’t allow us to park at the Eckville shelter where we’d planned to boondock. Plus, nothing nearby had cell coverage. So I asked her, “How would you like a night in an air-conditioned motel?” I thought she was going to cry, she was so happy. That was reason enough to shorten the day, find some air conditioning, and get out of this miserable weather.
I put it in high gear, hiked up the blue blaze trail, and rolled into the Hawk Mountain Road crossing just before 11:00 am. A few hours later, we’d both showered, I’d washed my sweaty clothes, taken a chilly air-conditioned nap, and gotten cold enough to want hot chocolate from the lobby coffee bar.
Maybe Pennsylvania isn’t that bad after all.
An Attitude Adjustment
It’s amazing what a good night’s sleep will do. Afterward, I realized I’d been at the breaking point. A thru-hike is supposed to be fun. Sometimes, it’s Type II fun. Other times, it’s just needlessly miserable and I need a break.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667088,"A Good Decision
As we drove away from Hawk Mountain Road yesterday on our way to a motel, Northstar reached over and absentmindedly put her hand on me. She drew it back immediately and said, “How’d you get so wet?” “Sweat and humidity,” I replied. Then she gave her hand a sniff and grabbed a towel for me to sit on. Good call.
I have no regrets about taking the afternoon off yesterday. I took two showers – one long hot one and another icy cold one, then cranked up the A/C and took a nap while my hiking clothes took their turn in the heavy-duty cycle. This humidity really makes them stink. Well, I provide the stink, but the humidity makes it last.
If I had any regrets about my blue blaze yesterday, it was not seeing the views from Pulpit Rock and The Pinnacle. But then I saw the outlooks from below on the drive back up to the trail this morning. Let’s just say the views in Pennsylvania haven’t been spectacular, and these looked like more of the same, but with low clouds to obstruct them.
Today’s Plan
I set out from Hawk Mountain Road planning to log 19.8 miles the Ashfield Road crossing. The hike included the usual 1,000-foot climb out of the gap, followed by a long, rocky ridge walk. Despite active bear and ground hornet warnings posted along the trail, I saw nothing but the occasional doe and heard nothing but invisible birds.
We weren’t sure if Ashfield Road was drivable in the van, so Northstar jetted ahead to check it out and reported that the road was passable, and the crossing offered both good camping and decent cell coverage. All I had to do was get there.
What If
Shortly after setting out, my phone notified me that my flight from Fairbanks to Newark had boarded last night. If Alaska hadn’t let me out of my summer field work, I’d have missed the last two weeks of hiking and would be driving back to Harper’s Ferry this afternoon. I’d be just starting Pennsylvania tomorrow and would have to push hard to make Katahdin before Baxter State Park closes for the winter.
I really do not want to have to flip flop and finish my thru hike at some random road crossing in southern Maine. I want to stand on the Katahdin sign, climb down the mountain, and drive home. Thank you, Alaska, for supporting my dream.
Pennsylvania’s Rocks
With every step north since Pine Ridge south of Duncannon, the trail has gotten rockier and rockier. The rocky sections are intermittent and variable, but they have either been getting longer and nastier, or I’m getting crankier about them. Or both.
So far, I’ve catalogued the following types of rocks:
Loose softball sized rocks. These are the trickiest to navigate as they can roll like loose softballs when you step on them. Fortunately, they are the least common.Imbedded softball sized rocks. These are the most common rock feature on the northern Pennsylvania AT. Don’t be fooled by the word “softball,” as they are neither soft or ball-like. They are usually pointy-edged slabs imbedded immovably in the trail. They frequently stick straight up to maximize tripping and toe-stubbing hazards. And after a few hours walking on them, the sharp edges seem to come straight through the soles of your shoes. Sometimes, the AT includes miles-long sections of these kinds of rocks. These rocks give Pennsylvania its evil reputation.Rock rivers. These geological phenomena leave massive blankets of boulder-sized, angular rock slabs on hillslopes. Rock rivers require some straightforward boulder hopping to cross, unless they’re wet from rain, in which case they can be tricky. And unless the trail planners aligned the trail downslope (which they occasionally do in PA), rock river crossings are usually less than a hundred meters long and are more of an annoyance than an impossible task. I’ve walked across rock rivers in every state since Georgia. Either more of them exist in Pennsylvania, or the Pennsylvania trail planners didn’t try to avoid them like they do in other states. I lean toward the latter explanation.Bedrock outcrops. A few of the rock sections lead to or include large outcrops of the underlying bedrock which require some scrambling to ascend, traverse, and descend. I think these are the most fun as they usually lead to a view, or at least the possibility of one. Less fun is the number of FarOut comments saying that copperheads and rattlers like to sun themselves on the outcrops.
The rocky sections seem to come in pulses, with a normal trail in between. Every one of the rocky section types will slow you down and require your full attention be directed at the trail. Who knows what scenic beauty, wonders, and wild beasts I’ve missed while staring at my feet for hours at time? Pennsylvania may be the AT’s most beautiful state, but no one would ever know.
An Ever-Changing Cast
It occurred to me today that I rarely see the same hikers day after day. I can’t tell if I’m outpacing the people I pass, or they’re leaving me behind after I stop in the mid-afternoon. I don’t think I’ve seen anyone more than two days in a row since the Shenandoahs. Maybe everyone is escaping to air-conditioned motel, throwing our itineraries out of sync.
Old People Hiking Alone
Another thing I’ve noticed is that people my age tend to thru hike alone. I doubt I’ve seen more than three pairs of people over 50 thru hiking together, unless they are part of a larger multi-generational tramily. I definitely haven’t seen a tramily composed entirely of older hikers. Today, I met three solo thru hikers in my demographic.
The first one was Sun Treader. I met him on the first climb of the day. He was friendly, but seemed preoccupied with the rocks and the climb and encouraged me to not wait for him and I happily obliged. Before I hiked on, we exchanged names and the usual hiker stuff. When he heard my name he said, “Oh, I think I’ve heard of you.” As I walked away, I realized I should have asked how and what he had heard. If I see him again I will. Why would someone have heard of me? This can’t be good.
Next, I passed Mosey, a friendly gray-haired woman from Florida. We chatted for five minutes about our hikes and, of course, the rocks. She told me that the trail listens to your thoughts. Whenever you start to think that the rocks might have gone away, it hits you with another batch. She also said they come in 45-minute pulses. I’m not so sure about either theory, though I firmly believe in the Pennsylvania AT’s inherent malevolence.
As I approached Bake Oven Knob around noon, I stopped to help a day-hiker who’d tripped and fallen on some imbedded rocks. She asked about my thru hike and mentioned that a guy with a long white (Gandalf) beard just ahead of me had started on April 10th, the day after me. I caught that guy about 30 minutes later when he stopped for lunch.
He waved as I passed, so I walked over and mentioned that some folks had told me he’d started April 10th, a day after me. He corrected me, saying he’d started April 1st, and then started offering excuses why I’d caught up. It was as if I cared about his pace, instead of just being curious whether I’d seen him before. I think everyone feels some level of pressure to meet some vague collective performance standard. It’s hard to hike your own hike without feeling judgment.
One of his reasons for going slow was that he’d taken yesterday off. He said he just couldn’t take the humidity, rocks, gnats, and the prospect of more rain anymore. Now we had common ground, so we commiserated on the hiking conditions for a few minutes until I left him so he could finish his meal.
I think I know why we older thru hikers frequently go solo, but I think I’ll mull it over for a few days before writing more about it. Feel free to weigh in with your own ideas.
Thigh Massage
I cruised on toward Ashfield Road, stopping briefly to chat with Soul Diver, a masseuse who travels the AT giving free massages. I guess he’s an AT fixture, though it’s the first I’ve heard of him. He offered to work on me, but he already had someone on his table and another scowling young beardie in line behind her. I declined, hoping to finish my near-20-mile day before it really heated up.
As I left, I looked back and realized my brain had read his “Thai Massage” sign as “Thigh Massage.” I’d had so many questions about why he only did thighs. Glad I kept my mouth shut.
Boondocking at Ashfield Road
Northstar had picked out a shady spot at the crossing where we could watch hikers pass through with our feet up and hand out lollipops and cold drinks, but no one came by. Around dinnertime, a group that had been sitting in the woods across the road came out and said hello. They’d been supported by their father for the last few days. He was about to head home, but he wanted to talk vans before he left. He’s retiring next year and wants to travel in a van.
Odds and Ends
I passed a thru hiker wearing a bug headnet yesterday. Oddly, he wore no shirt and very short shorts.I finished Book #2 of the Cradle series. On to Book #3. I think I’m more compelled than enthralled so far.The Canadian wildfire smoke is back. Northstar says she can smell it, but I can’t.The humidity dropped a bit this afternoon.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667129,"Hope and Possibility
What a great night for sleep! Quiet, chilly, and dark. I woke just as the stars disappeared, well before dawn, and lay in bed looking over the map for today’s hike. And contemplating the pounding my already-bruised feet were in for again today. Then I noticed some unmarked trails and forest roads that paralleled the AT. My feet tingled with hope.
Some of last night’s chill still lingered as I headed out the door at 6:00 am, though I knew it wouldn’t last. It didn’t, but it was cooler and less humid than it had been for two weeks, and it was lovely for an hour or two. Once again, I hiked into the morning sun, as the AT goes mostly east through northern Pennsylvania.
The Old Rocky AT
I reached the first alternate trail about a mile north of Ashfield Road. A wooden sign called the other option the “South Trail” and noted that it rejoined the AT in 1.1 miles. But it looked more overgrown and just as rocky as the AT, so I stuck to the official trail. My guess is that the South Trail was an old AT alignment because the current AT trail was well built and maintained. It had its share of trippy, pointed rocks, but had enough dirt to not pulverize my feet, and was a pleasure to hike.
The second alternative trail split off about a quarter mile after the AT passes hundreds of feet over the I-476 (Lehigh) Tunnel. Once again, the alternative looked rockier, narrower, and more overgrown than the official AT. The official AT was the better choice. This time, the trail planners managed to avoid the rock rivers and long stretches of imbedded softball-sized rocks, and had built a six-foot wide, sidewalk smooth trail. Obviously, someone with a little knowledge of geology and trail building got involved.
The New Well-Built AT
In fact, the trail from there to halfway down the descent to the Lehigh River was incredible, undoubtedly the best trail work I’ve seen on the AT so far. It avoided nearly all the worst rocky places, provided spectacular views of the Lehigh Valley, wandered through lush, fern-filled meadows and open forest glades, and had excellent dispersed campsites. Best of all, where it encountered rock rivers, they had placed flat rocks to make a smooth flagstone path over the worst spots.
I took a dozen videos, my narration gushing with praise and more than a little shock. Had I left Pennsylvania? Had some out-of-state trail builders snuck in and sabotaged the cruel, punishing original trail? Wow. Wow. Wow. By far, the best section of trail in Pennsylvania.
Does it Have to be Rocky?
As I floated through the lovely meadows and glades, a thought entered my brain. If someone could make a nice trail on this ridge, couldn’t the same thing be done on the rest of the Pennsylvania ridges? No, of course not. The geology must be different. There must be right-of-way or environmental constraints. The slopes, climate, aspect, forest cover, and land ownership must be unique in this section. Best not to think of such things.
The Lehigh Valley
I followed the trail down the steep rocky descent into Lehigh Valley and walked quickly over the Lehigh River Bridge passing a line of cars backed up at the traffic light. Then I headed back into the woods toward the next ridge.
What a climb, possibly the toughest climb on the AT so far. The ascent was steeper and longer than Albert Mountain, and much, much rockier. The trail crossed and followed several rock rivers, and ascended a half dozen near-vertical bedrock outcrops. My trekking poles were almost useless, as I had to steady and pull myself up by hand multiple times. The views were worth the effort though and made for a nice excuse to stop and gasp for air while taking in the scenery.
The Non-Rocky Non-AT
Near the top of the climb, I found the junction to the third alternate trail I seen on the map this morning. This one followed a small, unmarked, very overgrown path through deep grass to a second turnoff that led to a forest road that paralleled the AT. A five-foot black snake blocked the trail, so I knew treasure lay just beyond. And I was right.
After a half mile, I reached a grass-covered two track road that had been recently mowed. The road lay within 100 feet of the AT for nearly 2.5 miles. But unlike the rocky AT, it was soft, wide, smooth as butter, and lined with blackberries and wildflowers. I almost felt sorry for the purists I’d passed on the tough climb up the ridge. It killed me to think they were now laboring through the pointy rocks a hundred feet away. You recognize sarcasm, right?
Ironically, the purist trail joined my idyllic road after a few miles and followed it until it branched off again at a major utility crossing. I wonder, did I become pure when the two trails joined, or did the AT become impure by following a forest road? I guess I’ll never know, but I’d guess my chances of finding hiking purity are slim by this point.
Bushwacking and Ultralighting
Engrossed in a making a snarky video, I missed the split where the AT left the road. I saw movement to my right a few hundred feet later and saw a hiker following the powerline. A quick look at FarOut told me I was off trail and that my wonderful road now headed the wrong direction. So, I bushwacked back to the AT, but when I got there the hiker had disappeared.
The AT made another sharp turn off the utility alignment, but this time I saw it. As I made the turn, the hiker reappeared coming back down the powerline trail. He’d missed the turn and told me I was his miracle, saving him from getting lost. I’d told him he’d just done the same thing for me.
As we hiked along together, I noticed his very small, school-sized backpack and asked if he was slack packing. “No,” he said, “That’s all my stuff. Eight pounds. I’m ultralight.” Awesome. I caught one. As long as I can keep up, I might get some answers to a few questions. So, I asked him what he doesn’t have in that pack.
He doesn’t carry a sleeping bag (he uses a fleece blanket), pad, tent (he has a hammock, but no cover), extra clothes, stove and fuel, rain gear, or smart phone. If it looks like rain, he stays in shelters. When he passes near restaurants or stores, he pounds down as many calories as he can so he doesn’t have to carry them. He said he only weighs 120 pounds, so he couldn’t really carry much weight anyway. As I pondered all that, he volunteered that ultralighters have to be willing to be uncomfortable in camp, but they can go much faster on the trail. That’s about what I expected.
Another Cheater
Then I asked his trail name. “Cheater,” he replied. What are the chances? He got the name because he started out hiking with a large, leashed dog who pulled him up the hills.  I told him my “Cheater” story, and he asked if I was a platinum blazer (named for people who pull out their platinum Mastercard a lot). Guilty, I guess. But he said, “Sounds great. I would if I could, but I can’t so I don’t.” We chatted a few more minutes before I slowed to record some thoughts and he slipped away.
One thing Cheater didn’t carry was the FarOut app. In the few minutes we hiked together, he lost the trail twice. Then, after he’d hiked ahead, I rounded a bend to see him hiking my direction. He looked shocked and I asked if I had started hiking south. “No,” I replied, “I’m going north, and I’m pretty sure I’m following the white blazes.” He’d gotten off trail again, then intercepted it, and had picked a direction he thought was downhill.
Another hiker, a German with limited English-speaking skills, showed up just then coming down a gravel road that crossed the AT. He too had lost the trail. In fact, FarOut had also lost the trail, which had obviously been relocated recently from what the FarOut alignment showed. Cheater and the German wanted to pull out maps and talk about it, but I was confident I had it right and started walking. They reluctantly followed, showering the AT trail builders with f-bombs and frustration.
Within ten minutes we started hearing cars speeding through Blue Mountain Gap and knew we’d made the right choice. FarOut had it wrong. The white blazes had it right. So did the trail builders, who once again had done some really amazing rock work building a nice, smooth trail in tough terrain.
To Smith Gap and Beyond
I had 7.2 miles left to go to Smith Gap, where I planned to meet Northstar and camp for the night. But it was still morning, great weather, and I’d avoided miles of rock, so my feet and legs were still fresh. What if I hiked another 8.1 miles past Smith Gap to Wind Gap, which would turn tomorrow into a 16-mile day instead of a 24-mile day?
Northstar had scouted the Smith Gap crossing and reported that there was no cell coverage and no legal place to camp. That settled it. I’d hike to meet her at Smith Gap, rest for an hour or two through the worst of the afternoon heat, eat and hydrate, and then hike to Wind Gap before sunset.
Back to the Rocky AT
Everything went according to plan. Cheater hiked past with a wave as I was resting but didn’t stop. I haven’t seen him since. I saw no one else the rest of the day. The eight miles to Wind Gap were another rock fest – miles of imbedded softball-sized pointy rocks. And they invited the gnats to the festival. I could hear them buzzing in every video I made.
Although I’d downed all the protein and electrolyte I could stomach while at the van, I wonked. My blood sugar dropped. I got a little woozy and a lot cranky. This time I recognized it and started eating Clif bars, which, by the way, are delicious but incredibly difficult to swallow with a dry mouth. It’s like peanut butter and epoxy got together and had a baby.
Voices in the Deep Woods
In the midst of my semi-delirium, I heard voices in the nearby woods. A man’s voice was saying “Hello? Hello?” I stopped to look and listen but saw no one and hiked on. A few minutes later, I heard it again. This time, I thought, “That voice sounds a lot like my son Sam.” But still no one appeared.
I took out my phone to record a video about it and saw that I’d pocket-dialed Sam multiple times. The touchscreen was so wet with sweat that it had come to life and was opening apps, making calls, and reading my emails. Unfortunately, it hadn’t written any blog posts for me.
I called Sam to let him know I wasn’t dying in the woods and there was a ghost out here that sounded just like him. He laughed and told me I’d pocked dialed him almost every day this week.
Done and Done
I walked into Wind Gap beat. My feet hurt, I needed food and water, I stunk, and I could barely stay awake. On the bright side, I only have one more day in Pennsylvania.
I’d also gotten my marathon: 26.5 miles.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667179,"On a Mission
My feet were a little hammered from yesterday’s marathon, but they wanted out of Rocksylvania, so they were up with socks on and shoes laced up almost before I was. We’d boondocked right at the trail crossing in Wind Gap, so I only had to stumble out the door and start climbing.
Same Old Same Old
PUDslyvania said its goodbyes the same way it had said its hellos for the past two weeks – a steep, sweaty climb out of the gap, and then a rocky ridge walk through the long green tunnel. Today’s ridge started with seven miles of imbedded pointy rocks, and a few rock rivers thrown in for good measure.
Then came Wolf Rocks, a bedrock outcrop just high enough to see out over a tree-covered terrace below. Comments on the FarOut app promised copperheads and rattlesnakes sunning themselves on the ankle-busting cliffs. No snakes were out this morning, so I had to settle for a trio of buzzards that let me walk up to within 10 feet before they slowly flapped their wings and lumbered away.
Roll Call
After that, six more slightly less rocky, but still viewless, miles took me to the Delaware River overlook where I stopped for an early lunch and a look at the river below. Besides a couple of day hikers, I passed only two thru hikers all day.
The first was an older guy, hiking solo of course, who said his name was “Jon – J-O-N,” spelling it out for me. He said someone had tried out “Jontana,” after his home state, but it didn’t stick. The second was a young man named Fizz, who I hadn’t seen since the Blue Ridge Parkway. He asked about Gus, chatted a bit, and disappeared down the hill.
Straight Outta’ PA
I walked into the town of Delaware Water Gap just before noon, met Northstar, and walked with her and Gus across the bridge to New Jersey. I brought a little pile of rocks to mound up on the Pennsylvania side of the boundary sign and left them there as an offering.
In a fitting reminder of what I hope we’re leaving behind, we saw a pair of twenty-somethings approaching the bridge as we returned to the van. They saw us, crossed to the other side of the road, and passed by without a wave or a nod.
The PA AT
I won’t miss Pennsylvania. Rockslyvania. PUDslyvania. Tickslyvania. Hotslyvania. But I feel a little sorry for the state. It can’t help the miserable weather we had for the last two weeks, the tick infestation, or the local geology, but the ATC could have done more with the trail.
The long rocky sections are ridiculously unpleasant. I’ve hiked lots of rocky trails. I fully expect mountain trails to be rocky in places. My home trails in Arizona are rocky. But after two weeks walking the trail through Pennsylvania, I’m convinced the AT does not need to be so rocky.
Rocky Trails Are a Choice
I believe the Pennsylvania AT is rocky primarily because of poor trail building. Sure, the geology creates rocky conditions, some of which can’t be avoided, but consider the following:
The bedrock that lies under the AT doesn’t change much in Pennsylvania, but the annoyingly rocky sections don’t begin until well north of Duncannon. The rocky and non-rocky trail sections north of Duncannon have the same bedrock geology. We can’t blame the geology.Stagecoach Roads. Between Duncannon and Bordnersville, I walked almost ten miles along a 170-year-old former stagecoach road that was one of the smoothest trail sections in Pennsylvania. If road builders in the 1850’s could figure out how to build smooth trails through the Appalachians that have lasted almost two centuries, I’m pretty sure the ATC could too.Forest Roads. The same argument applies to the smooth-as-butter forest roads I walked. They cover the same terrain and have more restrictive right-of-way requirements as the AT but are smooth enough for wheeled travel. If forest roads (and old wagon roads) can be rockless, the AT could be too.New Trail Sections. The beautiful new trails near Palmerton also prove that the foot trails on Pennsylvania’s ridges don’t have to be rocky. It may take more work to build non-rocky trails, but it can be done.
In my career, I’ve worked on dozens of road alignment, bridge design, and planning studies. I completely understand about budget, right-of-way, jurisdictional, environmental, and political constraints. Sometimes roads and bridges get put in places that don’t make sense one to particular stakeholder. I’m sure the same is true for trail building.
I also know that AT thru hikers’ foot comfort wasn’t the only or primary concern when the AT was built. That said, much of the AT in Pennsylvania is a crappy trail. We could have done better. In some places in Pennsylvania, we have done better. We should fix the rest of it.
Time For a Day Off
Whew. I had to get that off my chest. Feel free to disagree. I found lots to like in Pennsylvania, but I had to work a little harder to find it. I’m guessing that it would be easier to find in Spring or Fall.
But I’m very happy I’m hiking in New Jersey now.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667209,"Rest is Best
On our past long hikes, Northstar and I found that taking a day off every week works for us. We rest our weary bones and feet, do something different for a day, catch up on chores like laundry and resupply, and get out of the weather. We’ve been trying to do the same thing on the AT.
Usually by mid-day on a zero, I’m itching to hit the trail again. But after getting pounded by the rocks for the last few days, and sapped out by the humidity, I started thinking about a double zero. But the lure of New Jersey is strong, and I’m starting to hear Maine’s siren call. I’ll probably save a double zero for when we really need it.
Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania wasn’t kind to me. Besides the rocks, the heat and humidity sucked the enthusiasm right out of me. The ticks took Gus off the trail and put Northstar in the urgent care. On the trail, I swatted and swallowed enough gnats to last a lifetime. I battled blisters and chaffing, primarily from being soaked with salty sweat or drenched by rain. Between the smoke, the haze, rain clouds, fog, and the long green tunnel, the views left much to be desired. And the weird bubble of unfriendly hikers in southern Pennsylvania was a trial I hope not to repeat.
The Pennsylvania woods were lovely, deep, and verdant. I’d love to come back and see them in Spring or Fall, and possibly even in winter. And I’d like to get to know the local history and see some of the sights the trail bypasses.
Until that time, I’m happy to put my seventh state behind and move on to number eight.
Enough Already
Thanks for putting up with my grousing and bitterness. Happier days are ahead, I promise. But this is a real story. Not everything resolves in one episode. Some things may never resolve. If I’m crabby one day (or week), that’s how I felt and what it looked like to me at the time. I’ll be better another day. Or I won’t. But its real. I’ve read enough unicorns and rainbows AT blogs. The world doesn’t need another one.","New Jersey

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667260,"It’s Nice to Get Up in the Morning…
I like to hit the trailhead by 6:30 am, or earlier if possible. When I woke at 5:00 am this morning, I heard rain pattering against the windows. I rolled over and checked the forecast. It called for more showers until noon, with rain accumulation of one to two inches possible. Yuck.
The motel couldn’t kick us out until 11:00 am. I still hadn’t caught up on my blogging. I only had 13.7 miles planned for today and no need to hurry. The afternoon forecast predicted sunshine and a breeze. Northstar and Gus looked very comfortable. I let them sleep. We’d get our money’s worth out of this motel stay.
The rain had stopped by 11:00 when I packed up the van, so Gus and I had a chance to play some fetch in the empty parking lot with his favorite ball. He found a lacrosse ball somewhere and will chase that thing until he drops, even though catching it mid-air may someday knock out his teeth. Lately, he’s started catching it off his chest by jumping and crossing his legs. But we have to hide it in between fetch sessions or he’ll chew it apart. Life’s simple pleasures.
Heading Out
Fueled by two DQ cheeseburgers and a chocolate milkshake I set out from the Delaware Gap Visitor Center parking lot and headed for the 1,300-foot climb back up the ridge. I passed a ranger who told me the same thing everyone else has – New Jersey is just as rocky, hot, and humid as Pennsylvania, at least for 40 miles, and the mosquitos are ferocious.
Whatever. I’m ready for it. But these days, I’m also skeptical of any trail information I get. New Jersey is the Garden State, how bad could it be? Plus, New Jersey supposedly has the highest density of bears on the entire AT. I haven’t seen a bear since Daleville, Virginia, more than 700 miles south. I want to see bears. And I’d finally pulled out a new pair of shoes. They’re itching to prove themselves on some rocks.
To New Jersey and Beyond!
However bad New Jersey might be, I only plan to be there for four days. For that matter, three weeks from now I’ll be in Vermont, if all goes according to plan.
Vermont! State #12 of 14. Hard to believe.
Love at First Sight
After crossing under Interstate 80 and taking only a few steps back into the woods, I knew I loved New Jersey. The wide, smooth trail followed an abandoned forest road above a rushing brook. The air, freshly scrubbed clean by the morning rain, had no smoke residue and still had a morning chill at noon.
Without the Canadian smoke and with the break in humidity, I finished the 1,300-foot climb with hardly any effort, stopping only to record passing the 1,300-mile marker. The lack of smoke and humidity also improved the wood’s lighting, making the green ferns blanketing the forest floor stand out against the brown leaves and grey bedrock that shifted tones as puffy white clouds sped across a blue sky above.
I stopped and ate an apple on an open peak, watching the clouds and looking down at the Delaware River and a series of small lakes. Somehow, this felt like hiking the AT again. I don’t know where I’d been for the last two weeks. Purgatory, perhaps. The Meseta, maybe. But this felt like someplace I wanted to be. Someplace I’d driven across the country to see.
Rattlesnakes, Swamps, and Adventure
I walked the edge of Sunfish Pond, a place I’d seen in hundreds of AT videos and read about in twice as many blogs. Was this the first mountain pond we’ve passed on the AT? It felt like it. Before long, I reached the turnoff to the Mohican Trail Center, which offered a store with ice cream cones and cold La Croix.
A quick look at the map revealed a blue blaze that continued from the Mohican Trail Center along a side trail called the “Rattlesnake Swamp Trail.” With a name like that, how could I resist? Especially with ice cream along the way.
Finding the Rattlesnake Swamp Trail turned out to be a challenge as it was neither blue blazed nor signed, and because FarOut’s map base layer wasn’t working, so I couldn’t see where I was. But I pulled out my pre-internet trail finding skills, made an educated guess, and followed the obvious trail until it dead-ended in a swamp. Then I backtracked and made a now slightly more educated guess which turned out to be the right one.
I saw a large turkey, a well-built beaver lodge, and several deliciously stinky swamps along the blue blaze trail, but no rattlesnakes. Trying to find and follow the unmarked, overgrown trail turned out to be nice change from walking the well-trodden, white-blazed AT. Frankly, if felt more like what most of my mountain wilderness hikes are like. I loved it.
Home for the Night
I popped out of the swampy forest and back onto the AT for a short walk before reaching Millbrook-Blairstown Road, where Northstar and Gus were waiting. They’d found several parking and camping options along the road, so we picked the one with the best cell coverage and set up for the night.
Are We Happy?
What a great day. Nice weather, nice trail, good hiking, and some adventure.
New Jersey – the way life should be.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667315,"The Midnight Knock
Apparently, the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area has strict overnight camping restrictions, but fortunately somewhat lax enforcement. We didn’t get the dreaded midnight knock* last night, but to be safe tonight we’ll be heading to the Stokes State Forest Campground. Parking at the trailhead is so much better, but rules are rules.
Magic and More Magic
Today promised to be full of magic. A reader who goes by the name of Slowsy Mosey contacted me to find out where I’d be today so she could set up trail magic. This morning, she texted to say that someone had already set up at the Culvers Gap parking area, so she’d moved on to the Sunrise Mountain Overlook where I planned to finish.
The good news: I’ll get trail magic at Culvers Gap, 14.5 miles into my hike, which will be perfect for an early lunch. The better news: I’ll get more trail magic for a late lunch 5.7 miles later. Even more good news: I have all the motivation I’ll need to bag 20.2 miles by early afternoon.
New Jersey Just Gets Better and Better
I’d hiked an hour before I realized I wasn’t soaked in sweat. In fact, I was a little chilly. I haven’t been chilly since southern Virginia and that was only because I was soaked by a cold rain. This is the East Coast weather I’d expected - chilly mornings and evenings with hot, humid afternoons. It stayed cool until noon. I barely broke a sweat all day.
Despite all reports to the contrary, New Jersey’s rocks have been pretty tame. So far, the AT seems to follow old forest roads and avoid long feet-killing rocky sections wherever possible. It’s the mountains. I expect to walk over and around some rocks.
Without the punishing rocks to absorb all my attention, I had a chance to look up and appreciate the ponds, lakes, reservoirs, streams, beaver dams, and a greater variety of trees. I even got to walk through some long stretches of aromatic conifer with soft needle-covered trails.
Trail Magic #1
I rolled through Culvers Gap about 11:30 and found Moose set up in the parking lot with two folding tables full of homemade sandwiches, cold drinks, and salty and sweet snacks. He also had a table full of hiker resupply items and a ring of chairs. Apparently, he’s a regular in this lot and has his schtick down to a science.
Purple Pilgrim and Solo were there when I arrived. I’d seen Purple Pilgrim once or twice, but never spoken with her. Solo was an older, flip-flopping southbounder. I’d just written about older hikers going solo, so during a lull in the conversation, I asked him about his trail name. Hearing that it was because he hiked alone, I asked if he thought most older hikers like us preferred going solo.
As it turns out, some people don’t like any implication that they might be part of the “older” crowd. I probably won’t be getting a Christmas card from Solo. Nor did I get an answer.
Hiking On
The six-mile hike from Culvers Gap to Sunrise Mountain Overlook was delightful, at least for me. Just after I left, some day hikers coming south warned me about a swarm of ground hornets that had attacked them. One of them suggested that if I ran, I’d probably be okay. I don’t run anymore, but the hornets left me alone anyway.
I popped in my audiobook to help speed the miles along, got wrapped up in an intense fight scene, and missed a turn. Eventually, when the ridgeline trail I took evaporated, I realized that I hadn’t seen a white blaze for a while. FarOut to the rescue. Sure enough, the trail was 500 feet to the east and about 200 feet below me down a steep slope.
I could have walked a quarter mile back to the turnoff, but I was already doing 20 miles and I had trail magic waiting, so I plunged down the steep slope toward the AT. Halfway down the slope, I realized this could end up being one of the dumber things I’ve done. So many things can go wrong off trail and help is much harder to come by. But I managed to intercept the main trail without stepping on a snake, wandering through a poison ivy patch, or breaking an ankle.
I passed and climbed the Culver Fire Tower, which had some great views and was much sturdier than any of the other AT fire towers I’d climbed. Just before Sunrise Mountain Overlook, the trail went past a huge wooden pavilion on the hilltop. I didn’t see a road up to it and wondered how they got all the building materials up there. It remains a mystery to me.
Trail Magic #2
I got to Sunrise Mountain Overlook well before Slowsy Mosey started thinking about packing up for the day. Northstar was there already, so she and Gus joined us for snacks and cold drinks. Purple Pilgrim walked in a few minutes later and said she’d missed the same turn I did but had more wisely chosen to hike back to the junction. Thriller and Expresso, two hikers I’d never seen before, joined us a few minutes later.
Wrap Up
I knocked out 20 miles in just under seven hours, averaging just under 3 mph.I’ve got my first real blister of my thru hike, an annoying little bubble on my right #2 toe. I never get blisters. I blame the new shoes, or possibly my supersonic pace.I’m still loving New Jersey, even though it hasn’t delivered any bears yet.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667375,"Promises
The internet promised that the New Jersey AT had rocks, mosquitos, and bears. And Sopranos, Real Housewives, Gravy Sauce, and Springsteen. I’d seen none of it. Well, some of it, but not what I’d been promised.
We did see a bear in the woods on the drive to our campground last night, but road bears don’t count. And some day hikers at Sunrise Mountain Overlook said they’d met a guy who told them he’d just seen a bear, but a third-hand bears don’t count either, even if the day hikers were pretty freaked out.
I pulled up to the Sunrise Mountain Overlook parking area not long after sunrise hoping that Day 3 in New Jersey would be THE day.
Rocks
I’d been promised 40 miles of Pennsylvania style rocks. I passed the 40-mile mark today totally disappointed. Jersey has a few wannabee PA rocks, but they are deficient in number, pointiness, duration, and overall cruelty, so I had to settle for my feet still being sore from PA rocks. The trail did get a little rocky near High Point State Park, just enough to slow me down from yesterday’s blistering (literally) pace, but then they all but disappeared. Sadly, Jersey only has normal AT-level rocks.
Mosquitos
I started seeing more head nets today, many with the weird shorts-sleeveless or no shirt combination. Overall, I’ve swatted at and accidentally eaten more gnats than mosquitos so far. I did find one mosquito swarm lurking on a steep descent when both my hands were occupied. But the bug count isn’t high enough for me to bother with putting on my head net yet.
Bears
I can live with New Jersey’s failure to live up to its rock and mosquito reputations, but I’ve been really disappointed about the lack of bears. Purple Pilgrim told me that the park rangers in the Shenandoahs had told her that the bear population had declined in Virginia. Maybe the same thing is happening in New Jersey.
Then, 30 minutes after setting out, a full-grown black bear lumbered across the trail 100 feet in front of me. It pretended not to see me but was obviously carefully choreographing it’s movement to keep just enough trees between us so I couldn’t get a decent video. I’d upload the video to prove my point, but it looks like a video of the woods. Use your imagination and I’ll save my monthly Verizon data allotment.
Still, it was a bear, the first I’d seen since Daleville, Virginia. Thank you, New Jersey.
Blue Blazing
FarOut shows a blue blaze trail south of High Point State Park called the Iris Trail that has about the same mileage as the official trail. The comments describe it as less rocky, wider, grassy, and lonelier. Sold. As if to reward my insolent disrespect of the official trail, no sooner than I started blue blazing, I saw a large sow and two small cubs scamper across the trail.
I’d have gotten some great video of the bear family if I hadn’t been narrating a video when they appeared. Instead, I have a video of my face and a recording of me saying things like, “Oh wow, they’re right in front of me…those cubs are so cute…the mom is looking right at me…etc.” Trust me, that made five bears (if you count the road bear) in less than 24 hours.
So far today, I’d learned two important lessons: (1) Always believe some of the things you read on the internet about New Jersey, (2) the trail rewards you for blue blazing.
High Point State Park
Giddy with bear ecstasy, I stopped in at the High Point State Park headquarters to celebrate with a somewhat cold ginger ale and a non-hiker-sized bag of Cheezits. Thriller, Espresso, Spa, and Pony sat at the picnic tables taking a break, so I sat down and swapped bear stories. They’re all heading to Unionville for beer and a deli stop, a hiking style known as deli-blazing.
Having shaved 0.3 miles off my hike on my blue blaze, I added it right back on, taking the steep blue blaze up to the High Point monument, a slightly smaller, grayer version of DC’s Washington Monument. I poked my head inside the door and saw a circular stairway spirally up out of the lobby.
That didn’t look too bad, so I climbed up 20 feet or so and arrived at a landing from which the real stairs began. Well, I’d come this far, so I clomped up 291 stairs to the top, still wearing my backpack. Unfortunately, the top is built for safety, not views. Four small, glassed over, slightly smudgy windows, one in each direction, provide the only lookouts. Alas.
I came down to find a woman playing bagpipes on the deck outside, which made my Scottish heritage stand up with pride that I’m mostly Dutch. And motivated me to get back to the trail.
Heading North?
The blue blaze junction to the monument wasn’t particularly well marked, but I found it and headed off toward NJ 284. Twenty minutes later, I saw Bells hiking towards me. I’d last seen her in Pennsylvania hiking with Mystery Otter’s crew. I immediately thought, “Oh crap, I made the wrong turn and have been hiking south.” But she was slacking south for the day. Whew.
She assured me that the rocks were about to end and warned me not to miss a swamp bypass trail ahead. “What rocks?” I thought and thanked her for the heads up about the swamp.
I didn’t see Thriller or Espresso at the tower, which meant they were out in front. I love having a rabbit to chase, so I set out to catch them. When I passed, I mentioned taking the blue blaze trail, to which Thriller responded, “At this point in my hike, the thought of a blue blaze crushes my soul.” That could mean any number of things, but all I could think was, “Blue blazes lift my soul.” Hike your own hike.
A 30-Mile Day
I finished 20 miles yesterday with plenty of time and energy to spare. So, this morning, I started wondering if I could have gone on to High Point State Park and made it a 30-miler. And that maybe I should start doing 20-25 miles per day in these “easy” states. I spent the morning doing the trail math, thinking about distances, finishing dates, who I’d catch, and the like.
By early afternoon, the heat and humidity had ramped up, and my feet were getting sore. Who was I kidding? I had no shot, and more importantly, no desire for a 30-mile day. I didn’t even want to do another two miles to the next road crossing after NJ 284. I’m too old to sustain that kind of mileage on a daily basis. But it was nice to dream for a bit. But nicer to climb into an air-conditioned van and put my feet up.
Unionville
When I got to NJ 284, Northstar had already arrived. Splat was there looking overheated and a little discombobulated. We offered her a ride to Unionville, where she met up with One Love, a hiker I hadn’t seen since Tennessee. I’ve been getting a lot of that lately. I may be catching up to a bubble I’d left behind before my hike went flippity-flop in June.
We dropped Splat at the deli in Unionville, where Northstar strong-armed me into eating a giant turkey sub (excellent, by the way) and a quart of orange juice. She said I looked a little insane and probably needed calories. Who am I to argue?
Next, we pulled across the street and hung out at the public park where they let thru hikers tent for free, but we had the place to ourselves. We sat on the benches under the pavilion and stared across the street at the Pizza Parlor until we couldn’t resist any longer and hobbled back across the street for dinner. The pizza was just so-so (though much better cold the next day) and the dining area was sweltering, so we headed back to the woods.
All in all, New Jersey gave us another bluebird day. Bears, towers, blue blazes, delis, and an end to the rocks. Supposedly.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667428,"Portents and Signs
Trailhead boondocking, a cool morning, and no rain in the forecast. What could be better?
I crossed NJ 284 and stepped onto a janky two-plank boardwark over a wetland, a portent for the kind of day queued up for me. Boardwalks through swamps and marshes, that is, not anything janky. Today’s wetlands would be both underfoot and in the air. The morning chill was refreshing, but I could sense that New Jersey was going to turn up the humidity.
I happened to notice the date – July 24th. My projected Katahdin summit is September 24th, two months from today. In one month, I should be in New Hampshire. The last few days, I’ve found myself thinking about the drive home and what comes next. I’m in no hurry to finish, but I’m starting to feel it coming.
Woods and Meadows
After the planks, I walked through some woods and into a hayfield by a small farm. A flock of turkeys ambled through the knee-high grass, and a pair of small deer bounded across the meadow behind them, flashing their white tails high in the air. The simple dirt path along the field border was lined with wildflowers and wineberries. I do love the meadows.
The trail intercepted a road and crossed the placid Wallkill River. I need a canoe and a shuttle to explore all these small rivers. The internet tells me that “kill” in river names is Dutch word for “water body.” But it also means “wood” or “church” in Irish, or perhaps Scottish. Ah, the internet. Regardless, with morning mists still hanging over the river, I’d kill for a chance to explore some murky quiet waters.
Marshes and Swamps
Next, I walked three sides of a National Wildlife Refuge constructed wetland rich with waterfowl, songbirds, and bellowing bullfrogs, and ringed with wildflowers. I stopped to stare at something large and brown moving through the reeds. A local hiker carrying a huge camera came over to look, so I asked him if those were deer. He said the deer go into the marsh to hide from packs of coyotes. He’s watched the coyotes surround and take down deer, egrets, and other birds.
Climbs
After the wetlands perimeter walk, the trail headed back into the woods for the first climb of the day, a moderately steep 700-foot ascent. It felt good to climb, though by the top I was drenched in sweat. Again. Still. I’ve accepted that I’ll be walking soggy for at least another month.
Friends
Near the top of the climb, I saw Manbun and Chatty (my names) just leaving their camp. I’d seen them a handful of times over the past three weeks, but could never get a word out of them. Yesterday, I’d walked up on them as they left camp just before my blue blaze adventure, and had gotten a “Hello,” a small victory.
Today, I saw them coming out of camp again and said, “How’s that for timing? What time shall we meet tomorrow?” That got a little chuckle and a smile, which led to a short conversation. I told them I’d seen four bears along the blue blaze, and they said I’d missed an afternoon trail magic by going too fast. They both speak with a thick European accent, which probably explains their normal reticence.
A few minutes later, Splat appeared ahead of me in the woods. Suddenly, she bent over at the waist and tilted forward like she was going to earn her name. A stream of sailor-worthy invective followed, echoing loudly through the woods. She turned and saw me, and shouted, “Stop! Hornets! No! Don’t stop there! Run!” I walked, figuring her array of commands averaged out to walking. The ground hornets got her but didn’t bother me. Maybe it’s the long pants and long sleeve shirt.
Then I passed Thriller and Cheater, and Espresso a few minutes later, followed by One Love after that. Splat told us that One Love is 70 and hiking with one lung. He’s killing it. Cheater and I might be the only ones not wearing head nets yet.
The Boardwalk
The trail soon spilled out of the woods, crossed a small road, and turned into another wetland. This time, the trail crossed through the marshlands on a miles-long boardwalk that must be the pride of the New Jersey ATC. Every AT vlog I’ve ever watched includes a segment about walking the Appalachian Trail Boardwalk. I’d been anticipating hiking it ever since I crossed the Delaware River.
I’ve talked to a few hikers who hate the boardwalk because it is too flat, too artificial, and boring. I loved it. I thought it was fun and different. I spent my time staring down into the reeds and muck from above, looking for critters. I saw one black-faced little rodent I couldn’t identify before he disappeared as my shadow crossed over him. A hedgehog?
Halfway across, I met a trail maintainer whacking weeds to keep up the three-foot buffer from the planks He gave me a little history of the boardwalk and talked about his daily battle trying to keep it from disappearing into the swamp. As we chatted, another hiker approached and we left him to his chores, thanking him profusely for his efforts before we hiked on.
Deli Blazing
As we left, the hiker mentioned that she was heading to a hot dog food truck at the next crossing. Suddenly, the room-temperature tortilla and tuna fish bouncing around in my pack lost its luster. I’d be eating hot dogs off the grill in minutes. The boardwalk ended at a small woods bordered by a railroad and then another meadow.
A signed posted by the meadow read, “Hikers – Do Not Approach the Cows.” I supposed some people must be told not to walk off a solid, dry plank trail through a wet bog toward huge animals that could hurt them. But seeing the sign kind of made me want to try. Also, what if the cows approach me? Do I reject them? Refuse their overtures? I wouldn’t want to be rude. Then again, I was heading toward grilled all-beef hot dogs, so the chances of building a long-term relationship with cows was slim.
The hot dog truck was locked up tight and wouldn’t open for another hour. Crushing disappointment. But then, a ray of hope in the distance. A sign up the road said “Farmers Market Today.” I recalled that farmers have food and stumbled deliriously toward a big barn, which turned out to be the Heaven Hill Farm Market. And they were flying the ice cream flag. Salvation.
Espresso and two other hikers eventually joined me at the picnic tables for ice cream, Gatorade, and other treats. Espresso told me stories of living in Italy while in the Navy. I might be going to Italy next.
The Stairway to Heaven
Fueled by sugar, I returned to the trail and the notorious “Stairway to Heaven” climb. Would “Stairway From Heaven” be a better name, considering where I’d just been fed? The climb was steep, but not particularly long, though a warning sign at the base told us to watch for rattlesnakes and copperheads. Just what a steep climb on a sweltering day needs – vipers.
I passed Thriller on the climb but saw no sign of Cheater. When I’d passed Cheater earlier, he’d put on the afterburners, chasing me down with all eight cylinders firing. Just as he got within a stone’s throw, but was still out of sight in the woods, I heard him briefly yelling about something, but he never reappeared. More hornets? It didn’t occur to me until later that I should have gone back and checked.
Might As Well Be Raining
Thriller was standing off to the side of the trail downing some water. He looked up at me wearily and said, “Might as well be raining.” I knew exactly what he meant. We were both rainstorm wet – clothes plastered to our skin and sweat forming puddles around us when we stopped.
I like that line. Expect to see it in my blog frequently until Fall.
It’s a real problem. When I’m this sweaty, I can’t use the touchscreen on my phone. I can’t open food wrappers without using my teeth. I can’t answer the phone or take pictures. I need a different way to carry my phone to keep the sweat off it. And to dry off my thumb before trying.
How Far Am I?
I stopped at the top to take a drink and gasp for air. A day hiker coming the other way stopped and asked if I was thru hiking. When I said yes, she asked how far along I was. People should not ask questions like that when I’m hot, tired, and more than a little befuddled.
How far am I? Uh, I’m here. I’m this far. I couldn’t figure out what else she might have meant. I appreciated the conversation but struggled not to say something snarky. Fortunately, I’d just looked at FarOut and knew the mileage, so I said I’m almost at 1,400 miles. She looked a little confused, so I might have misunderstood. I wished her a good hike and hurried off.
A Full Cooler
At the Warwick Turnpike I had a first. I found a trail magic cooler that still had cold drinks left in it. I’ve seen at least 20 coolers near crossings and never found anything but garbage in any of them. I sat down and had a second lunch with a chilly soda. And I met my first south bounder, a friendly guy who lives the vanlife when he’s off trail. He’d seen Northstar and the van waiting at the next road crossing and had lots of questions about amperage and such that I couldn’t answer.
A Full Heart
As I left the cooler magic, I realized that I’d spoken to nearly everyone I’d passed today, and I knew almost all of them by name. Northstar said that she’d seen Fizz and Lucky McShorts at the Unionville Deli and that they’d said hello to her. That hasn’t happened to me anywhere on the AT. I’m putting that down as part of New Jersey’s magic. I hope New York keeps up with its neighbor.
A Date
I met Northstar at Longhouse Drive around 2:00 pm, and we drove to Warwick so Gus could play at the park and I could write in the shade. After Northstar made dinner, we drove over to the Appalachian Boardwalk and walked it again, this time stopping frequently to watch dragonflies and evening birds.
Gus managed to fall off the Boardwalk trying to avoid a yappy little dog, but he was leashed and I caught him before he hit the muck. I’m pretty sure I heard Gus curse for the first time ever. It’s always the little dogs.
Jersey Love
I’m still loving New Jersey. I love the pine woods, the wetlands, the plank trails, the Boardwalk, the climbs, and small towns. Also, the wildflowers are back. And the variety of mushrooms has been stunning. The trail is well-blazed and signed, with a few interesting alternate routes. It didn’t hurt that the weather wasn’t as punishing as it was in Pennsylvania.
I felt good on the climbs today. I could have done another eight miles if I had to, but I sure didn’t feel like it. My feet are a little tender from last week’s rocks and this weeks miles. I’m looking forward to our next zero day.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667443,"100
A hundred days. Now that’s a milestone. I should probably sit down and write about what I’ve learned over the past 100 days of AT hiking, but not today. Today, I had another milestone on my mind: New York. My home state. State #9.
Home
After 40 years in Arizona, almost everything along the AT has looked somewhat the same to me. It’s all green, leafy, and wet, with its geology covered by dirt and plants. But today, I walked into New York State, and it looked a little different. It looked like home.
I recognized the knobby, glacially carved metamorphic and granitic outcrops sticking out above the dense woods as the ones I’d played and hiked on as a kid. The trees and birds were more familiar, like distant relatives whose faces I knew, though their names escaped me. I’d never visited the lakes and streams I saw today, but I’d known their upstate cousins once upon a time.
Welcome Home, Son
New York welcomed me back like a long-lost son. Unfortunately, not with a feast like a prodigal son. New York greeted me the son it banished to the Wild West and hoped to never see again. New York kicked my butt. It must have read the nice things I’d written about New Jersey.
New York had me scrambling on all fours to climb up and over every rocky ridge, and wishing I had two more limbs to swat mosquitos and wipe the sweat off my face. It picked the rockiest, steepest, slickest, buggiest, twisty, overgrown routes it could find.
And then it hid most of the white blazes. I spent an inordinate amount of time standing in open terrain, with either no trail or a myriad of them, trying to find the next blaze. Several times, I had to pull out FarOut and just follow the digital “You are here” icon toward the red line that indicates the trail. Lesser men might call that being lost.
Sure, some of the climbs were fun and had outstanding views of lakes and valleys. But I had to work hard for everything I got. I started thinking the New York AT had been built by Georgians, as the trail didn’t miss a single highpoint and seemed to pick the steepest route up every one of them. Did I see a switchback today?
I picked the wrong day for a 20-miler. I’ll need to revisit my plan if New York keeps this up.
Almost Alone
I only saw three other hikers on the trail today, and one of those was southbound. Just after entering New York, I met Pine. He started his flip flop less than a week ago at the Delaware Water Gap and is heading north to Katahdin. He’d been startled by a bear walking right through his camp as he climbed out of his tent yesterday and had scurried out this morning when he heard my bear-like clomping and puffing as I came down the trail.
Pine had a bright-eyed enthusiasm and eagerness few thru hikers who started at Springer Mountain still have. I found it both refreshing and slightly off-putting. But I’m hoping we meet again. I could use a little refreshing eagerness. I wonder if we all looked like that in Georgia?
Fix-It
I met Fix-It as I picked my way along a narrow outcrop atop a ridgeline. He’s another flip-flopper, filling in the last section of his thru hike. He started at Springer in late winter (snow and cold), skipped ahead to hike New England in early summer (black fly season), summiting Katahdin on July 15th. Now he’s hiking southbound back to southern Virginia (heat and humidity). We all hike our own hikes, but I sure wouldn’t have picked his itinerary.
Fix-It warned me about Cat Rock and Ledges (a.k.a., The Pinnacle), two exposed outcrops ahead that would be life threatening if I attempted them with my pack and poles. Then he noticed my small pack. Queue the usual small pack discussion, at the end of which he pronounced that my supported hike “was okay, since other people do that too.” I just smiled. I think it’s okay too.
I asked Fix-It if the bugs had been bad north of here, but he said bugs really hadn’t been a problem. Now, that’s good news! Then I noticed that he was wearing a hat, head net, long sleeves, long pants tucked into his socks, and full-fingered gloves. He seemed to want to chat more, but I had 20 miles today and a deadline, so I hiked on toward certain death at Cat Rock.
Reports of My Death Have Been Exaggerated
I didn’t notice I’d passed both Cat Rock and the Pinnacle until I stopped for a break a few hours later. To me they didn’t seem much more exposed or dangerous than a dozen other spots along the trail today. At one point, the trail went straight up a 10-foot vertical rock face. Fortunately, the trail builders had drilled rebar rungs into the outcrop to make a crude ladder. Weird, but fun.
Death By Mosquito
Despite my mantra of “One bad step is all it takes,” death by mosquito was more probable today than death by falling off a cliff. As long as I kept moving, the mosquitos just buzzed around my head, annoying me, but essentially keeping to themselves. As soon as I stopped though, the feeding frenzy began.
Not stopping was the obvious solution. Or perhaps stopping only in direct sunshine on a peak with a breeze. Yeah, right. New York wasn’t about to give me that option. The sunshine was punishingly hot, breezeless, and only slightly less buggy.
A family at the park in Unionville the other night asked me how to prevent the mosquitos from biting. I laughed and suggested staying home. Or covering up. Or Deet. They didn’t like any of my advice. They thought covering up would be too hot and that Deet is a dangerous carcinogen. Yup. Pick your poison.
I pick covering up. I’ll be bringing my head net tomorrow to slip on whenever I stop. If the bugs get really bad, I’ll pull out my Deet.
Fitzgerald Falls
I stopped for lunch at Fitzgerald Falls, a popular day hiking destination just past Lakes Road. The falls were down to two small cascades with a half-foot deep pool at the base, but it was miraculously almost bug free. I took advantage of the flowing stream to filter water, having already drained three liters today. I also soaked my head and torso in the pool to cool off. After lunch, I packed up and climbed the steep stairs next to the falls and headed out for the last 8 miles.
May As Well Be Raining
Within minutes, despite having washed off at lunch, I was rainstorm wet with sweat. Northstar called but I couldn’t get my phone’s touchscreen to work with my sweaty fingers. When I finally dried my thumb and the screen enough to use (I pulled out a spare pair of socks to use as a towel), I downloaded her voice message saying that many of the roads and trails around Bear Mountain State Park were closed due to the recent floods. She also mentioned that the National Weather Service had just issued a severe storm warning.
Almost on cue, I heard thunder rumbling in the west. I shifted into high gear, hoping to clear the final ridgeline before the storm reached me. But New York wasn’t done with my welcome home party yet. Raindrops started pelting me as I hiked the last climb of the day. I started counting the seconds between lightning flashes and thunder as I scurried along the ridge.
I missed the worst of the lightning, but the intense rain hit just as I reached the ladder-steep, 500-foot, quarter mile descent to NY 17. I got to the bottom without injury, silently chanting “just one bad step” as I went. By the time I crossed the NY Thruway I was thoroughly soaked.
I walked into Harriman State Park rainstorm clean, salt-free, and singing Gene Kelly’s famous show tune at the top of my lungs. And by “top of my lungs,” I mean humming quietly, happy that at least Sting wasn’t wrapping me around his finger anymore.
The Tentman Cometh
Northstar was waiting with dry clothes and our route back to the Bellvale Farms Creamery queued up on the navigation system. The Tentman, one of our blog e-tramily, had invited us out for a chocolate malt. We’d planned to meet up when I passed by the Creamery that morning, but I got there three hours before it opened, so we had rescheduled for the afternoon.
The Creamery lived up to its reputation and The Tentman delivered as promised. A former outdoor company rep, he even gave us some Darn Tough socks leftover from his trail magic stash, along with some sound advice about the upcoming sections of the AT. Too cool.
Wrap Up
I earned my 20.6 miles today. Neither the total mileage nor the total elevation gained was extreme, but the terrain was tough. I felt like I’d been walking over picnic tables all day. Every step was an effort. I’ll need to consider terrain more carefully when planning my daily mileage from now on.
I have the feeling that day one in New York was just a hint of what I’ll encounter in New Hampshire and southern Maine.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667472,"Doctor, It Hurts When I Do This
I woke up a little sore this morning. I slept like a log, but when I climbed out of bed I felt yesterday’s terrain and mileage more than I thought I would. It felt a little like mile 22 in a marathon. Everything still worked, but I was getting tapped out and was starting to question my motivation. It’s time to dig a little deeper.
But What If I Don’t Like Any of the Options?
Also, my head hurt from trying to sort through all my options today. My original plan was to hike from Harriman State Park through Bear Mountain State Park to a point just before the Hudson River Bridge. But a ton of trail closures, reroutes, and alternates lay between here and there.
First, the ATC had recently rerouted the trail to eliminate the surface crossing of Palisades Parkway, after a hiker died trying to dodge traffic. The reroute adds a few miles to the trail, turning my planned 19-miler into a 22-miler. After yesterday, I wasn’t particularly excited about another 20+ mile day.
Second, recent floods closed all of the roads in Bear Mountain State Park and some of the trail. The ATC just posted that the trail up Bear Mountain is closed and that the recommended route now follows Seven Lakes Drive through the Park. That would shave a few miles off the day but would miss one of the signature high points along New York’s AT.
Third, the NY Department of Transportation closed parts of several highways in and around Bear Mountain State Park complicating my logistics for getting dropped off and picked up.
Finally, I’m beat. I need a day off. We’d planned a zero day for tomorrow for Northstar’s birthday, but I had an early celebration on my mind. And by “celebration,” I mean a nap and some time in a hot tub. I could knock off early and stop before Bear Mountain State Park, but that would leave me short of the 1,400-mile mark which I’d hoped to cross today.
Hikers Hike
But hikers hike, or so I’m told by the AT apostles, so I hiked. I’d decide what alternatives and routes to take when I reach each trail junction. Maybe by then, I’d have some clarity, or the trail would decide for me.
Northstar dropped me off early at Harriman State Park. If I’m going to hike, I might as well get out early before the heat, humidity, and mosquitos kick in. Climbing out of Elk Park, I saw 17 salamanders on the trail, probably displaced by last night’s storms. That’s a good sign. Maybe today won’t be as bad as I thought.
Then Again, Maybe It Will Be Worse
Kate called. She gotten tangled up in one of those confusing NY round-about exits and bumped a pickup truck that had tried to zoom around her. She and Gus weren’t hurt, and the van was drivable, but part of the front bumper was gone. If my spirit was flagging before, it was sucked almost dry now. I had a hard time thinking about anything else for a few hours.
How appropriate that I arrived at the Lemon Squeezer just after she called.
Lemon Squeezer
The Lemon Squeezer is a well-known geologic feature similar to Virginia’s Guillotine and Grayson Highland’s Fatman Squeeze. New York’s squeezer starts with a triangular opening you must crawl through, followed by a narrow, chest-high, two-foot-wide gap in the bedrock. I walked through easily with my “small” pack, though my selfie video shows dozens of mosquitos swarming around my head as I went.
The hard part came at an 8-foot vertical climb after the slot that could have been a rated rock climb with serious consequences if I missed a hold and fell. I could have blue blazed around it but didn’t. I wasn’t going to let the trail get the better of me today. I made the climb, leaving my lemons unsqueezed. At least so far.
In a Daze
I trudged along, mostly in a daze, thinking about the van and my thru hike, trying not to lose the poorly marked trail, still unsure about what alternative routes I’d follow. I walked up one small hill and saw Boonie sitting on a sawn log that had once blocked the trail. I’d met him once before, the day I’d first met Cheater in Pennsylvania, but hadn’t seen him since.
I wasn’t in a mood to chat, so I just nodded and said hello as I passed. As I did, Boonie said, “You will want to see this,” in his thick German accent. I looked back and he pointed across the trail. I’d walked right by the 1,400-mile mark.
I would have missed it if he hadn’t said something. I’ve been making silly little reels on Instagram at every 100-mile mark, so I stopped and did my thing with a very somber German looking on. He looked amused, but didn’t volunteer to join in.
Re-Route #1
I asked Boonie what he planned to do at the upcoming trail reroutes. He said that he’d follow the new official route to avoid the Palisades Parkway crossing but wasn’t sure about Bear Mountain. He’d do whatever the signs recommended when he got there.
Then he reminded me that the Palisades re-route didn’t have any water sources. So, I trudged back down the hill to the last stream I’d crossed and filtered some murky stagnant water. Murky filtered water is better than unfiltered water, and much, much better than no water at all.
By the time I came back up the hill, Boonie had moved on, so I hiked on alone on the new official alignment. I’m such a follower.
Unsettled
Avoiding the Palisade Parkway crossing was absolutely the right decision. Safety first. But I was still unsettled about the Bear Mountain detour. Even though the Park is closed and the ATC recommends that thru hikers bypass Bear Mountain, online chatter says Park Rangers allow thru hikers to follow the old trail. I didn’t want to miss the Bear Mountain views and five miles of the trail, but I wasn’t excited about a 22-mile day either.
Settled
I reached the northern end of the first reroute, but as I started to turn toward the Palisades Parkway underpass, I saw pavement through the trees. I was about 400 feet from a road and an unmarked trail went right to it. A light dawned in my brain.
If Northstar could come get me at the road, I could stop right here. I’d bagged the 1,400-mile marker and had done 14 miles today. Northstar had texted me that the motel she’d booked for her birthday had let her in early. She was only ten minutes away. As was a shower and an air-conditioned room. Very tempting.
Then I realized that if I stopped right here, I’d start here again after my zero. From here, I could hike right through all the Bear Mountain State Park road and trail closures, across the Hudson River, and out of the flood damaged zone without having to do a 20-miler or worry about road closures preventing Northstar from picking me up. Win, win, win.
Zero, Baby, Zero
Northstar had made a friend at the motel who volunteered her husband to come pick me up. The husband is a mechanic, who agreed to look at the van with me, and figure out if it’s okay to drive. It is.
What a day. We deserve a zero. We need a zero. We just might need a double zero.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667506,"How Did You Know?
Day 102 was Northstar’s birthday. I knew exactly what she wanted: clean sheets, air conditioning, and no one slamming the van door at 6:00 am on his way out. On deck for the day: napping, no chores, and delivery food. A true zero. That went so well that…
…we did it again.
Deja Vu
Day 103 was double zero. I don’t think we’ve done a double zero yet, unless you count when Northstar had Norovirus and my brother died. I don’t think that counts. Or our family leave trips to San Diego and Indianapolis. Well, maybe those count, but I really needed this one. The rocks, heat, humidity, and bugs have sucked the lifeblood out of me.
On Zero.2 Northstar slept in and I nursed my sore feet. Then we tackled the normal zero-day chores – laundry, shopping, etc. I tried unsuccessfully to find a place to cut my hair. When I showed up at the place I picked I discovered it also offered tanning. Not a good sign. Even worse was the sign out front saying they needed a stylist. I decided to let my freedom flag fly. And I don’t wonder why.
Gus flunked out of grooming class too. At least I didn’t try to bite my groomer. We think another dog bit him at the dog park and his leg is sore, so he didn’t like it when the groomer poked him. He’ll get a vet visit next week.
Plus, we began the fight with Progressive over getting a claims adjuster to come out and look at the van. This time, I think our representative figured out that telling us to stay in one place for a week doesn’t work with an AT thru hike. We had a polite but firm discussion about customer service and what separates good businesses from bad ones. She called back 30 minutes later to say she’d figured out a solution. We’ll see if they deliver.
Then it was out for Northstar’s birthday dinner. She wanted steak, so we tried the Outback up the street. The steak was delicious, but something we ate kept us both up most of the night. But that’s a story for another day.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667535,"A Dickens of a Day
It was the best of times (double zero). It was the worst of times (getting back on trail).
I now understand the zero-day vortex that sucks thru hikers into taking extended town stays. We could have happily stayed a week in that air-conditioned motel room. When my alarm rang this morning, I could hear rain pounding on the windows. Ugh. I’m gonna be wet, then I’m gonna be hot, and then I’ll be wet again from sweat.
Not that I’d been sleeping when the alarm went off. Something we ate at Outback had us tossing and turning all night. When I did fall asleep, I had nightmares. Twice I woke up trying to scream. Once I was pounding the bed with my fists and trying to yell. I don’t even remember the dreams. Poor Northstar.
I probably should have just called the front desk and made it a triple zero. But zeros don’t get us to Maine, so off we went, back to the trail to tackle Bear Mountain and cross the Hudson. I only planned to hike 15.4 miles, having dialed back my daily mileage after hitting the wall last week. I should be done by noon, right?
Motivation
For the first time during my AT thru hike, I didn’t feel like hiking. I mean, I love hiking the AT, but I just couldn’t dig up any enthusiasm about another day of humidity, mosquitos, gnats, heat, rocks, and pointless climbs. I hadn’t even started, and I felt spent. I needed sleep. I needed motivation.
Discipline is doing what you know you need to do even when you don’t feel like it. It’s squats at the gym. It’s wind sprints. It’s buckling down and studying a week before the exam. It’s putting your feet on the trail when you’d rather be in bed. Fine. I’ll do it, but I won’t be happy about it.
I sucked it up and drove back out to the trail. And prayed for relief.
Am I a Purist After All?
Northstar dropped me off at the Lone Mountain traffic circle. From there, I could walk down a closed road to the 1779 trail that would take me back to the AT. Or I could take the paved road over to the Palisades Parkway Overpass and save a half mile of walking with the mosquitos in the woods.
Not today. I walked back to where I’d left off two days ago and climbed back to the AT like a good little purist. I’m glad I did. A few hundred yards along I saw Bells walking towards me, slackpacking again and heading south. Her parents have been visiting and spoiling her, so she was all smiles and enthusiasm. We stopped and talked trail stuff for a few minutes before moving. I needed that. A friendly face.
Now I need to work on my attitude.
Good ‘Ol New York AT
The New York AT was still serving up the same old humidity, gnats, and heat it had before my zero days. And it kept sending the trail straight up the hills and cliffs. But today I noticed that hikers have started ignoring the white blazes that lead up rock faces and have worn their own easier paths around the steepest sections. There’s a limit to people’s blind obedience.
I blame the thru hikers. They’ve had enough climbing. The little rock scrambles might be fun on a four-mile day hike, but after 50 miles of trail over multiple days in New York, the rock face climbs become an annoyance, especially on 60-year-old knees that need to last at least another 800 miles. I took a few of the bypasses. I’m not that much of a purist.
I stepped out of the woods to cross a road and saw a huge rattlesnake stretched on the pavement. My heart skipped a beat and I jumped back before I noticed the tread mark on its head and that someone had cut off the rattles. Squished by a car. But I was still on high alert for the next hour, checking myself every time I saw a brown root on the trail.
Am I a Scofflaw?
Yes. Obviously. But enough of one to disobey a trail closure sign? Again, not much suspense on that question either. I’ve been trespassing professionally for 40 years and have developed all sorts of morally questionable rationalizations to justify going where I want or need to go.
Still, when I encountered the trail closure sign at the beginning of the Bear Mountain Loop, I had to stop and weigh my options. On the one hand, I really wanted to climb Bear Mountain, see the views and the tower, and possibly see the New York City skyline. Plus, I’d read online that Rangers were letting thru hikers stay on the AT despite the closure signs. And it wasn’t raining anymore, so hiking conditions were good.
On the other hand, a Ranger could give me a ticket (or worse), or there could be real danger along the flood-damaged trail. And the signs were quite clear. The trail was closed. Plus, the “mandatory” re-route was shorter and easier, and I was already hot and tired. I could use the break.
But…even though two signs said “closed,” another said to use “extreme caution.” Why would they tell me to use caution if I couldn’t go that way? Clearly, that meant I could stay on the trail if I used “extreme” caution. I felt I was up to the task of extreme caution.
I stayed on the trail and hiked the mountain. The views were well worth the climb and the risk of a ticket. Especially a ticket that I didn’t get.
Rocky Lives in PA
The trail was fine. Some of the paved roads the trail crossed looked like they’d taken a hit during the floods, but most of the trail was actually in better condition than it had been in the rest of the state. I only saw one 200-foot-long section where floods had partially buried the constructed stairs and trail with rocks. I guess in the Nanny state of New York, when the trail gets some rocks on it, they close an entire state park for weeks. In Pennsylvania, they’d call a trail buried by rock a job well done.
Seriously, the flood damaged trails in Bear Mountain State Park were still better than most of Pennsylvania’s rocky sections. I saw nothing that would concern a thru hiker with 1,400 miles under their belt.
Crossing the Hudson
I’d climbed back down Bear Mountain by 11:00 and worked my way through the park to the Hudson River bridge, the lowest point on the entire AT. I guess it’s all uphill from here. The bridge walk offered excellent views, but the breeze was the best part.
Thank you, God, for a bit of moving air. It had gotten so humid, I felt like I could barely get the air into my lungs. And I was so wet with sweat, it might as well have been raining.
Cashed Out
Once I’d crossed the Hudson, I only had five miles to the Graymoor Monastery where we planned to camp. But the stifling heat on steep climb up from the river wiped me out. I sat down for a lunch break, got swarmed by mosquitos, and finally pulled out my head net. I folded my arms, put my head on them, and fell asleep sitting up. On a rock.
I woke up when a noisy group of day hikers passed by a few minutes later. I got up, packed up my lunch and finished the climb one step at a time.
Why?
As I slogged up the rest of the climb, dripping sweat and brushing away hoards of mosquitos, I found myself wondering why on earth I was putting myself through all this. Great question.
Why? Because hiking the AT is a life goal. I like to hike. I like to hike long distance trails. I love the woods. I crave physical exercise. I love epic journeys. And because I hate quitting.
I also know that epic journeys have defining moments. Marathons have “the wall” at mile 22. River trips have days of ripping upriver winds. Anything outdoors has punishing weather. In football, it’s Lambeau Field in January.
It’s what we call Type II fun. Type I fun is running the rapid on a bright sunny day. Type II fun is running the rapid in a headwind so stiff it stops your boat or in such freezing cold that icicles form on your canoe’s thwarts. Type II fun is not fun at the moment. It’s fun in retrospect. If you survive.
Today was Type II AT fun. I just need to survive it.
Goals
It also helps to have goals to mark my progress, so I reviewed my short- and long-term goals as I plodded along. Today, my goal was just to finish, eat, and sleep. Tomorrow, our friend Kerry is visiting. I can make it until tomorrow. The day after that is the last day of July. I can make it through the month.
After that, I want to finish New York State. And Connecticut. And Massachusetts. And celebrate four months on the trail on August 9th. Beyond that, I want to walk into New Hampshire. And still be hiking when my son’s family visits in early September. I know what’s beyond New Hampshire but that’s about as far out as I can possibly see right now.
Good Stuff
With my perspective and goals sorted, I turned toward the positive. Hiking in this heat sucks, but it could be worse. I get to walk every day. I’m healthy enough to hike 1,400 miles. I’m not writing reports and attending meetings all day long. I get to see my granddaughter on FaceTime most days. I’ve seen bears. We laughed with the Asmas when they visited. Survivor’s crew was a joy. I love watching Gus chase his lacrosse ball. I love reading encouraging comments on the blog. I like writing the blog. Jesus loves me. Life is good.
And Northstar is there waiting for me at the end of every hike. She does so much to make this hike happen, from resupply to parking to camping. She’s a joy. I have so much to be thankful for.
Well, That Feels Better
I walked out of the woods in better spirits than I’d walked in, though I was still sapped from the heat and humidity. As if to reward me, I arrived at the Appalachian Market, a convenience store right off the trail. I downed some cold drinks and a banana. Now my electrolytes were as in tune as my spirit, and I headed off for the last mile.
St. Francis, all dressed in white marble robes, smiled and waved at me as I turned into the Graymoor Monastery and found Northstar. We found a parking spot on the ballfield across from the thru hiker tents and called it a day.
I made it through dinner, but conked out before 8:00.
But I made it. Goal accomplished.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667571,"Out Go the Lights
I slept like a rock. I don’t think I moved the entire night until I heard the birds starting to sing just before dawn. Sometime during the night hikers set up eight tents across the ballfield from us but I was up and gone before they started to stir.
What a difference a good night’s sleep made. I woke refreshed and ready to hike. Yesterday’s blues washed away like last night’s rain. The rain seemed to have washed out the humidity and heat too, but not the bugs.
Bugs
But without the heat, even the mosquitos were more tolerable. Unless I stopped walking. Or worse yet, when I remembered that I’d forgotten to apply body glide this morning. Memo to self: do not expose certain places to voracious mosquito swarms.
About an hour into my hike, I realized I wasn’t drenched yet. A little sweaty from climbing, sure, but my pants were dry and I didn’t leave Incident-sized puddle rings on the trail if I stopped to take a picture. What a blessing! Just a hint that summer’s heat won’t last forever.
Just a Normal Trail Day
Without the heat and humidity to whine about, I focused on hiking. Let’s see…no big climbs today, no trailside deli’s, no big landmarks, no ridiculous PUD’s, and no silly rock face climbs. Just a quiet walk through woods and alongside bogs, lakes, little flowing streams, and fern-covered glades. And I didn’t see a single hiker before noon. On a weekend? Did I leave New York?
I walked by several tents though. Once, I was fiddling with my phone and didn’t see a brown tent set up a few feet from the trail. All of a sudden, I heard the crash of broken glass right next to me. I jumped to the side before realizing the tenter must have been playing Hearts on their phone with the sound effects on.
Friends From Home
I hiked into the Canopus Lake parking area about 11:15 am and met Northstar and her friends Kerry and Laura from Phoenix. They’d come east to watch Laura’s son Brantley play baseball for the Long Island Ducks and drove up to the trail to celebrate Northstar’s birthday. They strong-armed me to into a late morning brunch before returning me to the trail for the last few miles over to Long Hill Road.
A Quiet Afternoon
Even with the break, I was finished by 2:30. Since the weather was ideal and I felt great, I briefly contemplated adding another five miles. But we had a sweet parking spot in the woods with good cell reception. Why mess with success?
So, we spent a quiet Sunday afternoon recharging our batteries. Northstar took Gus for a little road walk and came back with pictures of a deer and a huge hornet’s nest hanging over their path. I’d seen one of those myself along the trail this morning and had jogged past as fast as I could.
All in all, a lovely day with near perfect weather. What a difference a day makes.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667622,"Crisis De Jour
I woke this morning to no electrical power in the van. First world problems, I know, but no power meant no oatmeal, no morning tea, and potentially a mini-fridge full of spoiling food. Conversion vans are great when everything works, but there are lots of things that can break.
Imagine taking your whole house on the road and jiggling every electronic and mechanical device in it for hours every day. Something is going to break eventually. It’s just a matter of time. And it’s definitely not what you’ll see in the Instagram Vanlife reels.
I’d put off ignorantly poking at the electrical system to this afternoon. First, I hike.
Just Another Day on the Trail
I just hiked today. Another day in the long green tunnel with not much to report. My goal for the day was to finish the month of July and get closer to the New York border. I did both.
New York Attitude
Speaking of New York, Northstar has decided that the proper trailside greeting in the Empire State is, “How you doing?” And the proper response is, “How you doing?” If you want to breach New York etiquette, actually answer the question.
Also, what’s with the car horns? I guess I’d forgotten that when I took Driver’s Education Class in upstate New York, we spent a whole week on using the horn. We got quizzed on how many milliseconds you should wait before beeping at the car ahead of you when the stoplight turns green (Answer: Zero)? And when is it improper to beep the horn (Answer: Never)? New York drivers need to relax.
I hiked up on a guy with some New York attitude this morning. I’d met him yesterday. He and a buddy are section hiking to Great Barrington. This morning he was leaning over his trekking poles midway up a small climb ahead of me, breathing heavily. When I got within 20 feet, he started moving, so I assumed he’d seen me. Nope. He didn’t hear me either.
I shadowed him for a few seconds until he stepped to the side, which I assumed meant he’d realized I was behind him. Nope. He jumped and started angrily yelling at me that I should have coughed or clicked my poles or something. I had, but he must have been too distracted with his suffering. I’d have apologized but he kept on angrily lecturing me until I stopped, looked him in the eye, and said, “How you doing?” He had to stop and ask how I was doing. Problem solved.
I felt a little bad killing him and leaving him in a shallow grave, but how did he not know section hikers are not supposed to speak directly to thru hikers?
Water Management
Ski Bum told me she was hiking to the Italian Deli for some “real food,” but I decided I didn’t want the extra mile since I had plenty of real food in the van to eat before it spoiled.
I used the same rationale to skip filtering water at the last flowing stream. But I misjudged my water supply and ended up hiking dry for the last two miles. Then, unfortunately, Northstar got tied up in town and arrived a little later than planned. I won’t make that mistake again.
Vanlife
The folks at Boho, the outfit that did our van conversion, were very responsive, walking me through a bunch of diagnostics over several hours of emails and video instructions. Basically, it looks like we’ve been parking in the woods so much, the solar panels aren’t getting enough sun. Plus, we’ve been hitting AC too hard because of the heat. Not the most satisfying answer, but at least they didn’t tell us to leave the van at a repair shop for a month.
Earworm Defined
It occurs to me that some of you may not know what an “earworm” is. Earworms are those little songs or snippets of songs that get stuck in your head, repeating themselves over and over.  For me, the cadence of my stride, something Northstar says, or just my subconscious triggers one.
Odd & Ends
We saw Catherine and Frederick in Pauling last night. I didn’t recognize them until we’d driven away. They’d lost some weight and Frederick had grown about four inches of scraggily beard since I last saw them near Roan Mountain in April.I’m starting to see south-bounders almost every day. They tell me that Vermont is a mudfest and that the stream crossings in Maine were challenging. I’ll take that over the heat and humidity they’re heading for down south.Went to the book early today. I’m nearly done with Book 5 of 10 in the Cradle series.A climb today had five, count ‘em, five switchbacks. On one climb! What is happening in New York? Must be the Connecticut influence creeping across the border.I nearly fell off a footbridge into a roaring stream while shooting video. One bad step.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667664,"Goals
Another goal accomplished: I made it through July. I survived the heat, humidity, rocks, and bugs. Next up: Get out of New York and into New England.
Home For the Night
We boondocked at the NY55 AT parking area, a small dirt lot that had all the amenities we’ve come to expect: all-night road noise, large mud puddles for Gus to wade through, and poison ivy around the perimeter. Ahhh, home.
The parking lot connected to the AT via a short blue-blaze. As I hiked out a 300-foot connector trail at sunrise, skipping the 500 feet of the AT I’d missed when I’d come down the highway to the parking area yesterday afternoon, I thought back to the consternation I’d had about such short blue blazes three months ago. How silly. AT culture can be weirdly conformist and Pharisaical about the trail.
Nuclear Lake
First up for today: Nuclear Lake. In the 1950’s, according to the internet, the Rockefellers financed a nuclear research facility on the south side of this remote mountain lake. An explosion in the 1970’s, and probably more than a little carelessness with waste disposal for several decades, severely contamination the lake with radioactive material. After the research facilities were demolished, the ATC decided it would make a great location for the trail. To be safe, they don’t allow camping near the lake.
I didn’t bring a Geiger Counter or do anything more than a quick Google search, so I can’t verify whether any of the story is true. From my perspective, Nuclear Lake was lovely - ringed by trees, low morning mists blowing swiftly over still waters, beaver swimming to and from their lodge, and sunrise reflecting off the lake. I saw a dozen campsites and fire rings from people who’ve ignored the no camping rule, but no “Don’t Touch the Water” signs. Perhaps its name is warning enough.
Calling It
As I hiked the perimeter of Nuclear Lake, Northstar texted me a photo of two older hikers looking up at her through the van window. Her text read, “Giving these guys a ride. If you don’t hear from me later, it was them.” Funny girl.
Spoiler alert: They didn’t.
Apparently, they woke her up before 8:00 am banging on the van window, asking for a ride. Still groggy, she asked, “Where do you want to go?” They replied, “Anywhere. Out of here. We’re done.”
A little less groggily, she told them she’d need to see identification and that she’d be texting their pictures to her daughter who works in law enforcement. On the ride into Pauling, they told her they’d just quit the AT. The heat, humidity, bugs, the long green tunnel, the terrain, their age, and their knees were too much. They weren’t having fun.
I can sympathize with them, but I’m not there yet. Especially not today, as the air was dry (ish), the sky was blue, and best of all, the projected high was only 72 F. Perfect hiking weather. And I had a lovely radioactive lake to visit.
Hello Again
The problem with yelling at someone on the trail is that you’re likely to see them again. If not that day, then the next or the day after. In fact, you have a fair chance of seeing them every day for weeks.
I hiked past a couple of tents and recognized the guy who’d yelled at me yesterday for accidentally scaring him. Yes, accidentally. I had made what I thought was an appropriate level of warning sounds. He recognized me too, so I waved, and then coughed a few times and made sure to click every possible rock with my trekking poles as I walked past. I think he chuckled as he waved back.
At the next climb I chatted with a section hiker who told me that he’d also hiked past the Bear Mountain closures, but that he’d been given permission by the ranger on duty at the detour. I’m glad I listened to my gut and didn’t needlessly skip that section.
Landmarks
An hour later, I hiked past the Dover Oak, a seven-foot diameter oak that sits right by the trail at a road crossing. AT lore used to call it the biggest oak on the AT, but now I notice that it’s described as “one of the largest.” I can sympathize with that too. I hate it when facts get in the way of good story.
Then came another long boardwalk, built in the same style as New Jersey’s Appalachian Trail Boardwalk. This one crossed a thick, reedy marsh which ends at the famous AT railroad stop. AT hikers can (or used to be able to?) catch a commuter train directly into New York City.
A Trip to the Big Apple?
Frankly, I can’t imagine a harsher transition from the trail than downtown Manhattan. I think my head would explode. My mom grew up across the river in New Jersey, my grandfather worked in the City, both my parents went to Columbia (in the 40’s before it was a big deal), and I had high school friends who lived there. As a kid, I loved visiting New York.
But after living in Arizona for two decades, we decided to take the family there on a trip back east. We went to all the places I used to love. I absolutely hated it. I couldn’t see the sky, it was noisy, dirty, and expensive, and too many people crowded the sidewalks. Living in the West had changed me. I had such a sense of relief when we crawled through a traffic jam across the George Washington Bridge and headed north on the Palisades Parkway through the woods. Never again. Certainly not on this trip.
Back on the Trail
Feeling no lure toward Gotham, I hurriedly crossed the railroad tracks, climbed over a rickety wooden stile and began a long, soothing meadow walk. Acres of chicory, wild carrot, purple clover, and other wildflowers surrounded the trail as it meandered across the fields past a cool wooden water tower, old barns, and farmhouses before returning to the shady woods. I walked under a cloudless blue sky and reveled in the cool breeze.
Another Accidental Blue Blaze (on the real AT)
I crossed a quiet road and saw signs about a bridge out ahead and that I should follow the trail re-route along the road. What I didn’t get was that the signs meant I should start following the road right then. Instead, I saw a white blaze along a trail that led into the woods. So, I went into the woods. Right towards the dangerous bridge failure.
I walked happily along, enjoying the soft lighting, shade, and trees until I came to a stream crossing. The remains of a wooden footbridge lay plastered to the far bank. A thin rope replaced what had been the bridge. A young man camped on our side of the stream, who was drying out his clothes over a smoky fire, looked over and smiled at me and asked if I planned to slackline across.
Cautiously, I walked up to the streambank by the rushing, half-foot deep water and stepped across. I almost had to jump, as the torrent was nearly a full stride wide.
Yup. Another overblown trail warning. During the flood that took out the bridge, I’m sure the re-route was needed, but no longer. I’d saved a mile of walking pavement and dodging cars through my mistake and had been rewarded with a nice walk in the woods that took me right to the Connecticut border.
Thanks For the Memories, New York
New York had saved its best for last. What a privilege to walk today’s section of trail. No PUD’s (PUD: pointless ups and downs), almost no rocks, no cliff face scrambles, plenty of water (albeit radioactive), lakes, meadows, views, and clean air. The trail was well-blazed for a change, was well built, and made sense. Several times, I stopped to just breathe and enjoy the loneliness, quiet, and lighting of the woods. The last two day’s weather didn’t hurt either.
I needed a day like today. I could almost forgive New York for torturing me over the last week.
That said, I’m stoked to be leaving New York behind and entering New England. A few times this morning I caught views of what looked like the beginnings of the real mountains to the north. I’m excited to get there.
Connecticut
New England welcomed me with a steep climb and descent over Ten-Mile Hill, yet another AT viewless summit. I put it down to training for the climbs to come. After that came a nice walk along the Tenmile and Housatonic Rivers. I love river walks, listening to the stream’s soft music, watching light play on the water, and waiting for wildlife to appear.
To PUD or Not to PUD
After a mile of walking the Housatonic River trail, the AT decided that we needed to head back into the woods for another pointless climb up a nameless, viewless, mosquito-infested hill that would miss the historic wooden Bulls Bridge. Or…I could blue blaze along the river, see the bridge, and avoid the PUD. Think, think, think.
Northstar texted me asking the height of the van, including the roof-mounted AC and antenna. She’d wisely stopped at the “10 ft 8 in” sign by the Bull Bridge. I should know things like that, having looked it up once myself. But I didn’t recall at that moment, and it gave me yet another reason to blue blaze along the river. I walked over to meet her and eyeballed it as she carefully drove through.
Wrap Up
For the first time in weeks my pants weren’t slimy with sweat all day. I’d knocked out 19 miles before 2:00 pm and had barely worked up a sweat. What a day! I had fun hiking again.
We found a nice boondocking spot along Schaghticoke Road and started to set up for the night, but the lure of something cold and bubbly in Kent was too strong. As was the buzz of the river-dwelling mosquito swarms. We’d be back later after recharging our batteries in Kent’s bug-free sunshine.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667701,"Type II Boondocking
We boondocked in a one-car pullout along Schaghticoke Road where the AT leaves the river and heads back into the hills. Unlike many of our parking spots, this one stayed quiet and dark all night, though the mosquitos swarms near the river were voracious. Ravenous mosquitos turn a simple midnight or early morning visit to the woods into a Type II adventure.
Northstar’s Plan
Northstar was studying the FarOut map before bed, reading all the user comments for each waypoint along tomorrow’s route. I heard her make that “I’m thinking” sound and then she asked if I knew about the unmarked blue blaze. I did not.
Someone had commented that you could save a few miles and 1,800 feet of climbing by walking Schaghticoke Road instead following the AT into the hills. After climbing some hills through the woods, the AT returned to Schaghticoke Road at Macedonia Brook. From our parking spot, we’d noticed that about half of the thru hikers who passed by skipped the official AT in favor of the river walk down the road.
I didn’t really care about shortening the miles or missing climbs, but I loved the idea of walking along the Housatonic River again.  When I looked at FarOut myself, I noticed I could take another road from the end of Schaghticoke Road all the way to Cornwall Bridge, where I planned to finish.
River Walking
Rivers are my jam. They have been my career, my hobby, and my passion. I’ve done river studies on well over 500 rivers in the western United States and I’ve boated just over a hundred of them. As a kid, I spent my Saturdays playing in the creek up the road. My mother was constantly telling me to get out of the highway ditch in front of our house, but the lure of building little dams and floating tiny boats was too tempting to obey her.
I prefer rivers to mountains and woods. I love the sound of running water and can stare into rapids the way some people stare at fires. And boating rivers? When I’m boating, the landed world simply does not exist. To me, piloting a boat downriver is art, beauty, and adventure all rolled into one.
I’ve walked almost 1,500 miles through the Appalachian’s woods this summer and only a few along its streams. I had no question that I’d be river blue blazing along the Housatonic all day tomorrow.
Schaghticoke Road
I set out in a crisp 51F morning. Perfect walking weather. Schaghticoke Road offers a few river views. Instead, it mostly lies at the edge of the floodplain buffered from open water by thick vegetation. Along the road, I passed a sign that announced the entrance to the Schaghticoke Indian Reservation and warned us to “Beware of the Dog.” Interesting combination, but I’ve travelled enough tribal land to know that reservation dogs can be a handful, so I kept my eyes open.
I also passed the tribal cemetery, where I stopped to read the names and dates. The number of cross-shaped headstones and American flags and Veterans designations marking graves surprised me. I grew up next to the Onondaga Tribe, part of the Iroquois Nation, but I’d never visited one of their cemeteries. I’d never heard of the Schaghticoke Tribe.
River Road
I snuck through the Kent School’s posh grounds to cut off a half-mile road walk. I’d planned to walk over the bridge into the Town of Kent, but I’d made such good time so far that I hardly needed the break. After walking nearly a half-mile through the Kent School’s dorms, academic buildings, and athletic facilities, I found myself back along the Housatonic River. This time, the road followed the river closely with excellent open water views.
In general, I’m not a big fan of road walking. As a teen, I read Peter Jenkin’s A Walk Across America, the story of his coast to coast walk on America’s rural byways. I think the book inspired my love of epic journeys, but I’ve found my own road walks to be hot, painful, and somewhat boring. Today, I wasn’t hot, but I definitely got a little bored whenever the river was blocked from sight.
So, I started reading emails and sending texts as I walked. I checked in with Yogi, Survivor, and Wheels to see whether they were still hiking and where they were. Survivor responded immediately that he was gearing up to head north to finish the last 300 miles of the AT. I didn’t hear back from Yogi or Wheels.
Back on the AT
A few miles down River Road, the AT came back down out of the hills and followed the road, ending my blue blaze adventure. After another mile, the gravel road ended at a locked gate and turned into a hard packed sand path. The hard packed sand made for the best walking conditions of the entire AT so far. If feet can smile, my were grinning toe to toe.
I passed several southbounders (AT thru hikers going from Maine to Georgia), who I’ve found to be much friendlier than my fellow northbounders. At a narrow point in the trail, I pulled aside to let a southbound hiker pass, but he stopped and said, “I’ve been wanting to meet you.” Huh? That confused me a little. I looked around for someone behind me he might be speaking to, but we were the only two hikers in sight.
Then he introduced himself as Jim, which triggered my memory enough that I recognized him as someone who clicks on some of my Facebook posts. He lives in Connecticut and had guessed I’d be walking this section of trail today and walked south to intercept me. I’m so glad we didn’t miss each while I hiked one of my blue blazes! We stood on the trail and talked for about 30 minutes. What a nice surprise!
Got Questions?
Jim asked a bunch of questions, which I happily answered. Which reminds me, if you have questions, feel free to ask them in the comment section (which is why I defined “earworm” yesterday). Or drive to Connecticut and try to find me. Just remember that my posts are delayed a few days, so factor that into your guess about where I’m hiking.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667746,"Not Again
We had a rough night. We’d driven into Kent for groceries, cell coverage, and a parking spot in the sun to let the solar batteries charge. Just before we left Kent for our trailside boondocking spot, our son called to say that he was headed to the ER with possible heart problems. Some context:
This son is the doctor. Doctors don’t go to the ER unless they really, really have to.My brother just died of heart failure.Northstar absolutely hates to see her children suffer.
When we got back to our boondocking spot, we discovered that the cell coverage vacillated between SOS mode and 1 bar. This displeased Northstar (massive understatement), but our son assured us we could do nothing but pray until morning. He said he’d be fine. Northstar remained displeased. I fell asleep, but not for long.
A Force of Northstar
When it comes to the health of her children, Northstar is a force of nature. In fact, I once spent an evening around a campfire with a hurricane, a typhoon, an earthquake, a tsunami, and a flood. One of them, I forget which, told a story about an irresistible, inevitable outcome that couldn’t be stopped, no matter how hard they tried. They called it a “Northstar.”
Northstar woke me to inform me that we were driving to find better cell coverage. My questions about why were met with firm resolve. We drove. Resistance was futile.
Boondock Hunting After Dark
Finding legal boondocking sites with excellent cell coverage near Cornwall Bridge, Connecticut after dark isn’t an easy as you might think. Highways with no shoulder have good coverage. Parking lots do not. We ended up at a small motel, knocking on the office door at 10:45 pm, asking to rent a room with Wi-Fi for the night.
Eventually, one of the permanent residents came out to tell us that the owner was out of town and that they weren’t renting rooms. But he took pity on us, gave us permission to park in the driveway, and provided the Wi-Fi code. Problem solved. In a matter of hours, I’d relaxed enough to fall asleep again.
Yogi Checks In
Somewhere in all that, Yogi responded to my message asking if he’d summited Katahdin yet. He hadn’t. In fact, he’d quit the trail at Great Barrington and gone home to Minnesota. He’d had it with the heat and had hit New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in the middle of the flooding that took the life of the hiker in Vermont. He’d had enough.
The Aftermath
Yogi’s departure hit me hard.  He’s a strong, experienced hiker who had been crushing the AT. I woke up after a bad night of sleep thinking if he can’t make it, what hope do I have? I left the van in a funk, carrying a full pack of dark thoughts up the climb out of the Housatonic Valley. Maybe I should quit. We should go take care of our kids. I can always come back next year to finish.
Somewhere along the climb up Breadloaf Mountain my attitude began to change. St. Augustine’s famous quotation drifted back into my mind, “Solvitor Ambulando,” it is solved by walking. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve walked myself out of a funk. I don’t know if it’s the endorphins, the zen of movement, the quiet woods, or just getting off my butt and doing something, but it works.
Go With What You Know
Then I remembered something Northstar used to say when she was battling cancer, “You feel your feelings, but go with what you KNOW.” So, I began listing all the things I know about my thru hike. I know:
I’ve always wanted to thru hike.If I quit I’ll be miserable. I shouldn’t be, but I know I will be.This is the best time to do this hike in my life. I’ve sold my firm, annoyed my clients, set aside other projects and goals. I bought a van. I did all the planning.I’ve spent four months hiking so far. I have to respect that and not toss it away.The scenery will get better (and the hiking harder).The heat will end (and it will get cold, but I like hiking in the cold).
Mostly, I know I want to finish this. “Alright,” I told myself aloud, “You old white-haired whiner, you’re going to Maine. I don’t care if every day is Type II fun. Until you get carried off the trail on a stretcher, you’re going north.”
I texted Northstar to tell her we’re going to Maine. She replied, “I never thought you weren’t.”
Hiking North
I don’t remember much about the rest of the day except that I enjoyed it. I felt like my first love had returned. The woods were pleasant. I passed some “view” points and recall thinking, “These overlooks need Fall” and imagined them blanketed in fall colors. I bet they’re magnificent.
Meeting Moses
On a short climb, a smiling southbounder stopped to let me pass, asked if I was thru hiking north, and asked my trail name. He said he was called “Moses” and nodded slightly toward the large wooden staff in his right hand. I asked if he’d been using it to part the waters in Maine’s flooded river crossings. He gave me a funny look and replied, “I carry the stick, God parts the waters.”
This kind of exchange is the Christian equivalent of the secret Masonic handshake. We exchanged blessings and went our separate ways. It’s always nice to meet a brother. And I definitely needed a blessing today.
Eventually, the trail dropped back down the ridge and followed the Housatonic River for the last stretch through Falls Village. I stopped to admire the whitewater paddling course and then rounded the bend to find the 1,500-mile mark on a bridge abutment. 1,500 miles. 700 to go.
Another Force of Northstar
Northstar had read my mood this morning and whisked me off to a pizza feast in Lakeview. And there was nothing I could do about it.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667773,"Decisions
One of the challenges of living the Vanlife along the AT is that my daily mileage is dictated by road crossings. Some days my legs tell me I should be hiking 20 miles, or 10, but the road atlas overrules them and gives me a choice of 8, 15, or 24 miles.
Today was one of those days. I could either do 7.7 or 23.6 miles. Since today would have been our weekly zero day, and I wasn’t sure if I’d really have the legs for 23.6 miles, I picked the short mileage and made it a nearo. Plus, a short day would set me up for a more reasonable 16.9 miles the next day, which would include three notable climbs.
How to Spend a Nearo
On nearo days, you can either sleep in or quit early. Or both. Or in my case, I get up early as usual and lollygag around while my better half and dog sleep in. To each his own. And by lollygag, I mean write and edit blog posts. I’m always trying to catch up.
Great Falls
We rolled into the Great Falls of the Housatonic near Falls Village around 10:30 am. I’d planned on taking Gus for a swim but the morning was overcast and a little chilly, and Northstar wasn’t enthused about spending the day with a wet dog. For his part, Gus was all in for a swim and kept bringing me sticks to toss in the water for him. Nice try, pup, but I’m not falling for that one again.
Gus & A Long Game of Fetch
Last summer, we took Gus and Roux on a little raft trip on the Oregon’s Lower Deschutes River. Our second day out, Gus found a stick by the river and went to work trying to pull it up to our camp site for a game of fetch. Unfortunately for him, the stick was part of a tree that had recently fallen in the river, so he didn’t make much progress.
Gus tugged, chewed, and wrestled with the tree for a while, but ended up just barking at it incessantly and annoying everyone in camp. Eventually, I walked down to the river, broke it off the chunk he was mad at, and absently mindedly tossed it far out into the strong current. Just as it left my hand, I realized my mistake.
Gus watched the stick’s flight into the water, glanced at me, and dove in. He still had his life vest on, fortunately, as he was swept downstream into a mile-long Class II rapid. Not that it bothered Gus. He is very committed to his games of fetch and was actually gaining on the stick, though he was a quarter mile downstream by the time he got within 50 feet.
Meanwhile, I ran along a railroad grade that follows the river calling him back. Not until the stick got away did he look around, see me, and turn to swim back to shore. By that time, we were almost a half-mile downstream. He climbed out, soaked and happy, and immediately started looking for another stick.
So, no, I would not be playing fetch with Gus at the top of the waterfalls today.
A Nearo Hike
The 7.7-mile hike went about as expected. It included a moderate climb, a few nice partial views of the surrounding valleys, some fragrant pine woods with needle-covered trail segments, and a short road walk through some fancy homes and an old cemetery. Best of all, I felt like I had walked in the mountains again.
I don’t know if it’s the granitic terrain, slight vegetative changes, cooler weather, or the first hints of bigger peaks in the distance, but trail hasn’t felt very mountainous since southern Virginia until today.  I know that the AT has had higher peaks since then, but something about them didn’t feel like mountains. I’ll have to give more thought to that over the next few days and take another crack at an explanation.
Moldering?
I walked up to Undermountain Road but saw no sign of Northstar or the van. I was about to pull out my phone to call her when I recognized Gus’ bark in the distance. The parking area was setback in the trees out of sight of the road between two nice homes, a perfect boondocking site. It even had a privy, though I had to explain the difference between a moldering and a moldy privy before Northstar would take a look. A moldering privy uses leaves to help digest the waste. A moldy privy is what you find out back of gas stations in Tennessee hillbilly country.
A Boondock Afternoon
We spent a wonderful afternoon sitting behind the screens in the van, writing, reading, napping, and occasionally poking our heads out to greet hikers as they passed through. Northstar was entertaining a group of section hikers when I walked up. Later we saw Pony and Soup walk through, two hikers I’d met at High Point State Park in New Jersey.
We had a long conversation with J-Mo and his daughter Lioness. J-Mo was hiking with the Warrior Project until he fell behind after going home to collect his daughter after her high school graduation. The Warrior Project helps veterans work out some of their post-service burdens through long distance hiking. I’m not sure I’ve met two nicer thru hikers on the trail this year. I’d love to hear more of his story.
I’d hoped to meet some of the permanent neighbors. I’ve been noticing homes that back up to the woods that surround the AT and have been wondering what the locals think about the trail. Do they know it exists? Are they aware that thousands of hikers pass by their backyards every year? Do their kids come out and play on the trail? Is “right by the AT” part of the sales pitch when they sell their homes? Or is it something they hide from? I could see it going either way.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667825,"Awesome Z’s
For the first time in a long time, we had a wonderfully chilly night, a quiet location, and a perfectly flat parking spot. I slept like a rock. I didn’t wake up until 6:05 a.m., but still hit the trail just before 7:00 a.m., anxious to get started on what promised to be an excellent hike.
My goals for the day included bagging Connecticut’s high point, entering Massachusetts, and getting one day closer to Katahdin. I’d also get some real climbing in today, with over 4,200 feet of total elevation gain that included a few steep ascents.
Lion’s Head
The climbs started right at the van, with an 1,100-foot ascent up the Lion’s Head that left more than half of the elevation gain for last ¾ mile. The final 40 feet turned into a New York-style scramble. I’d like to say the view was worth the climb, but the overlook was surrounded by trees, occupied by Saturday hikers, and socked in with low clouds. Instead, the climb itself was worth the climb.
I added some extra fun after getting lost in thought and walking almost a half mile down an unmarked trail after missing a turn. Eventually, my subconscious poked my conscious about not having seen a white blaze for a while, not to mention a suspicious flattening of the trail.  Fortunately, the trail back to the AT was relatively flat, so I didn’t have to lose and regain a lot of elevation.
Bear Mountain
The Lion’s Head is only a blip on the bigger climb up Bear Mountain, Connecticut’s highest peak. And it felt like a mountain, with nice views off the ridge between the Lion’s Head and the summit, steep climbing, and a change in vegetative cover near the top.
While craning my neck to see over the scrubby trees near the summit, I heard something largish move in the brush by feet. I jumped back and watched a porcupine waddle across the trail and disappear on the other side. I’ve only seen one other porcupine in the wild, though I used to take care of one that lived at a nature center in Grand Rapids.
They’re fairly docile, unless threatened, so I’d let that one wander around the nature center during visiting hours. It spent most of its time sleeping on the wood pile by the stone fireplace. Today’s porcupine seemed to have the same mellow attitude as my old friend.
What Are the Odds?
Bear Mountain’s summit is marked with a huge cairn, big enough for a dozen people to stand on and look out over the trees into the surrounding valleys. Today, four day hikers stood there pointing out Twin Lakes peeking through the dissipating clouds across the valley. I climbed up to join them and check out the view.
One of the young men looked over at me and stared. I gave him a little nod, but he kept staring, and then asked, “Are you Natalie J’s father-in-law?” I’ve climbed a lot of mountains, and hardly ever get asked that question. But in fact, Natalie J married my youngest son last October.
I’m from Arizona. Natalie and my son live in Oregon. As I stood there, I couldn’t think of a single person I knew in Connecticut or anyone who know I’d be here today. Then I remembered that Natalie grew up in Connecticut. Still, what are the chances that I’d meet her best friend’s husband, his father, brother, and friend on a mountain peak in the middle of nowhere? Or that they’d recognize me. I would never have recognized him.
But we’d met last fall at the wedding. Weird. We stood there swapping Natalie stories and chatting about his upcoming Grand Canyon hike until his crew hiked south, leaving me alone with the view.
State #11
I crossed the Connecticut-Massachusetts state line after practically parachuting down Bear Mountain’s steep descent (500 ft/0.3 mile). According to trail signage, I entered Massachusetts twice and must have been in disputed territory for about a mile. Either way, I’d completed state #10. Only four more to go.
Mt. Race/Mt. Everett
Almost immediately, the trail started ascending 1,700 feet up Mt. Race (2,361 ft.) and Mt. Everett (2,605 ft.). FarOut calls the trail up Mt. Everett grueling. I’d put it down as steep, but not particularly grueling.
I’d read lots of complaints online about the steep climbs on today’s hike, but I found them much more enjoyable than anything I’d done in New York. Then again, I’d read most of those complaints during the heat wave I complained about when I was in New York. Perhaps the cooler weather was the difference.
A Nerd-Fest
As I reached Everett’s summit, an AT Ridgerunner was just telling Pony and Soup that they should read Patrick Rothfuss’ The Name of the Wind. “Don’t do it!” I said as I walked by, “Rothfuss will never, ever finish Book 3 of the series and you’ll be left forever wondering how it ends.” It really is a fantastic read, if you like the fantasy genre, but Book 2 (The Wise Man’s Fear) came out in 2011. It’s been 12 years, with only rumors of a future release date.
Well, that led to a nerd-fest about our favorite fantasy/Sci-Fi titles, during which Pony and Soup happily escaped, though Samwise and I hardly noticed. Always nice to meet a fellow nerd, especially one named for my favorite Tolkien character.
That Sure is a Tiny Pack
On the descent back down to Undermountain Road, I met a pair of trail maintainers clipping back the brush. When I slowed to thank them for their efforts, the woman asked me if I was out hiking for the day. Again, why do people ask me these kinds of questions when I’m hot and tired? Let’s see…
I’m on a hiking trail, so yes, I’m hiking today.I have a bright purple AT thru hiking tag on my shoulder strap in plain sight, so no, I’m not a day hiker.
But I smiled and cheerily replied that I’ve been hiking for a lot of days, but I knew what was coming next. Sure enough, she followed up with the usual comment.
You Should Have Used a Kayak
When I did my solo canoe trips down the Verde and Gila Rivers (It’s been a while since I’ve shamelessly plugged my books), it seemed like every person I met along the way offered the advice that I should have taken a kayak instead of a canoe. And not a single one of them was a boater. But they felt free to offer their expertise, nonetheless. It got to be a joke.
At least on the AT, most of the “tiny pack” comments come from hikers, if not backpackers. Still, I may have to print up a t-shirt or button with my standard answer. Or better yet, make up an uber-lighter story that I carry nothing in my pack but protein powder, a shower curtain tarp, and my k-bar.
Yeah, I’m going with the uber-lighter idea. I’m open to suggestions on what items I should carry in my tiny pack.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667856,"Jug End Road
I finished at Undermountain Road (MA 41) yesterday, but we boondocked a mile back at Jug End Road trailhead, where we had safer and quieter parking. I briefly thought about re-hiking the lovely meadows between the two roads this morning and letting Northstar sleep in, but she was up when I left and was happy to drop me off. As it turned out, I didn’t need the extra mile.
Today’s goals included finishing map #6 of 9 (three more to go!) and biting off another chunk of Massachusetts before a zero the day after tomorrow.
Meadows
I started out with six miles of relatively flat terrain that traversed an alternating sequence of pleasant meadows, bogs, and woods. Summer wildflowers dominated the meadows, splashing bright colors over the tall, dew-soaked grasses. After four months in the long green tunnel, I treasure the farm fields’ open skies and colorful carpets. And my feet love the soft grass.
Several of the woody sections included fragrant pine groves with wide, soft, needle-covered trails and long views through the nearly bare understory. If I owned a house in woods like these, I’d walk the dogs along these peaceful paths every morning and evening. But I must be the only one who feels that way as I walked completely alone all morning.
In some places the trail crossed boggy wetlands, sometimes on rough-hewn wood planks and stepping stones, and occasionally on more elaborate boardwalks raised above the ground surface. Despite the morning chill, I had to pull out my head net whenever the trail got swampy or shady, especially if I stopped moving.
Eventually, I reached the Housatonic River, this time following it briefly downstream before crossing it and traversing its floodplain to head toward the mountains. I saw my first white birches growing along the Housatonic. I’d seen several fallen birches the last few days, but no standing groves until today. I love everything about birches.
Mountains
As I walked away from the Housatonic River along a paved road, a runner startled me from behind. So, of course I yelled at her, telling her to cough or click her poles…just kidding. When I noticed she wore a race number, I asked if I was on a race route. She must have thought I was worried about crowds because she began explaining about the pack and her pace or something. But all I really wanted to know was whether there might be a snack station ahead. Alas.
I left the road and started climbing back into the woods. Two 1,000-foot climbs lay ahead of me, the first steep and the second much more gradual, with plenty of saw-toothed terrain in between them.
I passed Goldie at the top of the first climb, loudly chanting, horking up a hairball, or something at the only view portal, so I slipped past to give her some space. I’d last seen her in Pennsylvania. Northstar had met her two days ago where she was planning a 30-mile day to try to catch her tramily, but from what I saw, she was still alone.
Since the view rock was taken, I stopped for an early lunch at the next paved road crossing where I could sit in the sun to try to escape some of the mosquitos. I pulled out FarOut to check my remaining mileage and was shocked when it told me I still had 13 miles to go.
Mistakes
I had planned a 19-mile day. I’d been hiking for about four hours. Usually, by the time I break for lunch, I only have six or eight miles left. I did some quick math. I’d hiked four miles before reaching the end of FarOut map #6 and nearly eight miles since then. I should have had seven miles left to go, not 13, unless I’d only managed a pathetic 1.5 mph this morning. If FarOut was right, I’d end up with a 24-mile day, sore feet, and just possibly, a bad attitude.
Northstar had called this morning to tell me that our planned meet-up spot didn’t exist. There was no road crossing where I’d sent her. Plus, the road was nearly undrivable and had no parking, not even enough to sit and wait for me. Clearly, FarOut had flipped out.
[I learned later that when you change maps in FarOut, you need to find and click the update button, or you might end up with last year’s mileage. The 2023 trail is four miles longer than 2022’s trail.] 
Regardless, we needed a new meeting place. Eventually, we decided on the wonderfully named Beartown Mountain Road, a gravel road with a pullout just large enough for the van. I’d hoped for an actual town of bears but was happy enough with a place to park and to not have to walk 24 miles.
Magic
Now all I had to do was walk the remaining miles. Somehow, the threat of 24 miles made the 19 miles feel longer than it was. But God was smiling on me this fine Sunday and I found an untended trail magic setup at the next road crossing, just before I began the last big climb. At least I think it was trail magic. If it was somebody’s picnic, they had one less banana, Gatorade, and cookie when I left.
Don’t panic, it was definitely trail magic. They had a hiker sign-in sheet and a southbounder had told me about it, saying the lady had just left to run an errand.
Fueled with sugar and caffeine, I headed out for the last few miles. I passed Pony and Soup taking a break on a big rock. Pony said he’d just started The Name of the Wind, the book the Ridgerunner had recommended yesterday.
That Again?
Then he invited me to join him at the Upper Goose Cabin tomorrow night, saying it’s a great place to meet other hikers, sit around the fire, and tell stories. Like, for example, stories about how you got your trail name. I’d seen that one coming. He started working that angle yesterday. Not a chance. He’ll have to wait like the rest of you.
But I did make him the same offer I made Survivor back in North Carolina. I’d give him another clue every day I saw him. He’ll learn soon enough that I won’t necessarily give him good or useful clues. Plus, I knew that I’d be taking a zero day soon and we’d probably get separated. It all depends on his commitment.
For now, all he knows is that no priests were defrocked as a result of the incident. As far as I know.
Odds & Ends
I saw a turkey on the trail today. In the woods. Also, two garter snakes pretending to be something more alarming.The bite valve on my water bladder is leaking. Maybe it’s not been the humidity that’s been soaking my shirt after all.The water caches at road crossing are a mess of empty plastic bottles. The ATC needs to figure out a better solution.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667897,"I Hear the Drizzle of the Rain
I woke to rain pattering on the van roof. We’ve had rain in the past two weeks, but I hadn’t had to hike in it since the day I got drenched walking into Harriman State Park 14 days ago. I peeked out the window. From the look of the sky, my dry streak just ended.
Northstar had said that Beartown Mountain Road had been pretty washed out to the north of where we’d boondocked at the trailhead. To the south, we’d heard the road was usually in better condition. But my plan called for a 22-mile day that would end at another gravel forest road described as steep and rough. With rain in the forecast, we probably needed a better pickup location.
Since we had zero day on tomorrow’s calendar, we decided to cut today back rather than hiking 26 miles to the next paved crossing. Maine’s not going anywhere, and it’s always nice to ease into a day off and get a jump on tomorrow’s chores. We’d meet at US 20 around noon.
Like a Memory it Falls
The rain picked up as soon as I started walking. The dry tree canopy kept it off me for about 30 minutes, but then it started dripping off the leaves. I was soaked through within 10 minutes and hiked wet the rest of the day.
Stopping makes no sense in the rain, except at shelters, so I walked straight through for five hours. Since my iPhone touchscreen is useless in the rain, I couldn’t take pictures, record video, take notes, or listen to my audiobook. I just walked and looked at the woods. How retro.
No one else was dumb or desperate enough to be on the trail in this downpour, so I walked alone with no sounds except the rain and the water squishing out of my shoes with each step. Even the mosquitos had hunkered down to wait it out.
My Mind’s Distracted and Diffused
Eventually, I just started talking to myself. I’d noticed a Facebook post yesterday from a hiker who’d just summited Katahdin. He’d thanked everyone and said that he’d learned so much about himself by thru hiking. But he didn’t mention any specific lessons. So, I asked myself what I’ve learned. And then tried to answer, but I didn’t get very far.
It turns out I need some distance from this hike before I can answer that question. I remember feeling the same way about our Camino de Santiago hike. I enjoyed every day of that trek, but I didn’t fully appreciate it until after we’d finished. If I’d told you what I was learning during the hike, it wouldn’t have had the depth of the life lessons that emerged in the months after we’d returned home.*
My Thoughts are Many Miles Away
Right now, my head is too full of itineraries, distances, logistics, and chores. I probably won’t be able to see how much I’ve changed until we get back to our normal life. Or for that matter, to find out whether any perceived changes last through the transition back into the real world.
But I had a nice conversation with myself on the topic.
I Gaze Beyond the Rain-Drenched Streets
I walked up to US 20 about 11:30, five hours after I started, and saw two backpacks bouncing up the trail just ahead of me. As I stepped out onto the pavement, I recognized Catherine and Frederick. We’d seen them briefly at the park in Pauling, but hadn’t recognized them. Before that, we hadn’t seen them since North Carolina.
I walked across the highway to apologize for not recognizing them the other night and to ask where they were headed today. Frederick had just pulled out his cell phone to call a shuttle, so I offered them a ride to town, which gave us a chance to catch up during the drive. They are probably the two nicest people I’ve met on the trail.
After dropping them off at the Pittsfield Big Y, the best grocery store we’ve visited on the trail, we stopped at a laundromat conveniently located behind a Burger King. While Northstar watched the clothes spin, I took care of some Kingly business and then finished shaving Gus.
The Only Truth I Know is You
Northstar started his haircut yesterday with a pair of clippers she bought at Walmart, but Gus wasn’t cooperating toward the end. She’d got him shaved enough that he could have hiked today if it hadn’t been raining. We won’t be opening a mobile grooming business, but we did alright. People who see him aren’t gasping in shock. That’s good enough for me.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667926,"Staying Healthy
We’re back on our one zero day per week plan. As much as I want to get to Katahdin as fast as possible, I want to stay healthy enough to get there. Taking breaks is part of staying healthy.
Northstar & the Bard
Northstar timed this zero to squeeze in a visit with Greta, one of her favorite former students. Northstar taught High School English and Drama in Tucson when we first moved to Arizona and still keeps up with many of her students. Greta now lives in upstate New York and made the drive over to Massachusetts.
We all had lunch together and then Gus and I went back to our room to nap, write, play fetch, and eat more. Northstar and Greta went to see a summer theater production of Midsummer’s Night Dream. I don’t hear well enough to process Shakespearean English. I may also have a well-deserved reputation for falling asleep during live theater.
A New Itinerary
My main goal for the zero day was to revise my itinerary from here to Katahdin. If I can’t get through Vermont without any 25+ mile days, I’ll need to backpack. The real challenge was to not rely on any forest roads that might have been washed out in last month’s floods.
After a few hours on FarOut, Google Earth, and some AT websites, I worked out a slackpack plan for Vermont. I’ll have a few longer-than-usual days, but nothing too extreme.
New Hampshire and Maine, however, will require some overnight backpacking and then a six-day stint in the Hundred Mile Wilderness. In addition to their rugged terrain and steep climbs, both states have some long stretches between van-drivable roads. I tried to work out a stay in one of the New Hampshire Huts, but they weren’t really in the right places for my plan. Alas.
Wheels & Chopstix
I finally heard back from Wheels and Chopstix. They’d just climbed Mt. Moosilauke in New Hampshire. I didn’t hear whether Shamrock or Navigator are still with them. They’re weeks ahead of me and pulling away.
Alaska
I also heard from the Alaska crew, who apparently have been following my hike, which inspires me to keep going. Best of all, they haven’t fired me! Yet.
The Mosquitos Could Be Worse
The Alaska folks also reminded me of what bad mosquitos are really like. The bugs have been intermittently annoying along the AT since Pennsylvania, but nowhere close to Alaska-scale mosquito infestations.
On bad bug days on the AT, I debate about whether I should pull out my head net. I’ve put it on a half dozen times, but never for very long.
No some of our Alaska river trips, there’s no debate. Up there, we almost always wear head nets, long sleeves (several layers), long pants (tucked in to boots or socks), and gloves. Some of the crew have bug net coats. No skin is left uncovered. And then we spray ourselves with Deet. And we still get bit.
Sometimes, after getting frustrated with the constant buzzing in front of my face, I’d put down the oars, outline a one cubic foot zone in front of my face, and try to smack every bug that came into the kill zone. I’d put 200+ bugs on the floor of the boat in no time and not made the slightest dent in the population. They just keep landing on me, crawling over my head net, and trying to squeeze in between my clothes layers to find flesh.
Every time I climbed into my tent, no matter how quickly and efficiently I did it, I’d have to spend the next five minutes hunting down and killing all the mosquitos that came in with me. Anytime I’d hear one of the crew get back in their tent, I’d hear them go through the same routine.
Worst of all, after a few brutal trips to the bushes to do my business, I started wearing Deet on my butt and thighs under my pants. It’s hard to reach the required level of relaxation while dozens of mosquitos land in places you really, really don’t want them.
But it sure is pretty up there. I’d go back in a heartbeat. After I’m done here.","US20

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667970,"Man’s Best Friend
Gus was banished from hiking at Maryland-Pennsylvania state line after Northstar’s tick bite. Poor little guy, he finally given up even asking to go with me in the morning. I’d get up, he’d look over at me, and then flop back down on the bed in frustration, refusing to acknowledge my existence.
But since we’re through the worst of the tick habitat and his much shorter haircut makes ticks easier to find and less likely to end up in the van, he’s been cleared to hike again. He also got a Permethrin shower last night before bedtime. Fingers crossed he doesn’t come home with a new crop of ticks.
I love having a friend to talk to on the trail. Gus doesn’t say much, and he makes me carry his food and water, and he generally eats my cheese at lunch.  But he looks up at me whenever I say something, especially if it begins or ends with, “Right, Gus?” Despite having a month off, he knocked out a 19-miler today without a complaint.
Goals
I’ve started reciting my goals each day as I start hiking. It keeps me motivated and focused on the positive. I can endure if I remember the good things that come with endurance.
My goals for today consisted of checking off some miles in Massachusetts and visiting the Cookie Lady. The Cookie Lady has been handing out cookies and helping thru hikers for as long as I’ve been an AT junkie. The original Cookie Lady retired recently and moved away, but the new owners have vowed to keep up her tradition.
Beyond today, I’m focused on reaching Vermont this week and New Hampshire later this month. I can’t wait for some bigger mountains, hiking above the tree line, and seeing fall colors.
Today also marked four months on the trail. We have less than two months to go.
A Named Climb
Today’s hike started with a climb called Jacob’s Ladder. Anytime a climb has its own name, I assume I’m in for a doozy, especially when it includes the word “ladder.” But the ascent wasn’t particularly punishing, either in steepness or length. Plus, once I’d reached the top, I noticed that the rest of the day was basically a downhill walk, aside from a few sawtooth sections and a small PUD right before Dalton.
A Good Day for Walking
I started out with freshly laundered, clean, and aromatic clothes, a nice change from their condition two days ago. The morning air matched their clean, fragrant feeling and added a wonderful chill that had me dreaming about Fall.
I’ve been calling this weather “Salamander Mornings,” because the moist, post-rainstorm, chilly weather seems to bring them out on the trail. I see dozens of them, each one orange, alone, and frozen in fear from my approach. Neither Gus nor I bother them. I just call out their number as we pass, and Gus looks up to confirm the count.
The woods in this part of Massachusetts are thick, the dense understory accentuated by last night’s rain still clinging to the leaves and branches, dragging them down to shoulder height over the trail. This morning, a storybook mist swirled among the branches and leaves, giving the impression that a strange tale was about to unfold. I half expected to see a knight in armor ride around the next bend, emerging like magic out of the mists.
But instead, Gus and I walked alone, as usual, lonely heroes of our own small story set in a skyless land of brown and green.
Cookies or Magic
The Cookie Lady must have enemies. Or perhaps jealous competitors. I walked out of the woods expecting to see signs directing me up the road to the Cookie Lady’s house. Instead, two guys had set up a ring of sack chairs in front of two folding tables. Trail magic. Right by the trail with no extra walking required. It seemed pretty bold to set up magic within sight of the Cookie Lady, but I was hungry and had no cash to tip the Cookie Queen.
I really love cookies, but I guess I love not walking extra miles even more, because I sat down and let them shove hot dogs, Gatorade, chips, and donut holes at me. Our hosts were two section hikers who’d just summited Katahdin, finishing their three-section AT hike over two years. When they figured out why my pack was so small, they admitted to staying in hostels and motels most nights, and only using their backpacking stoves about 25 times.
The hosts said that they hadn’t seen any northbounders today, besides me and Deadbeat, a young woman who left Springer May 1st. They’d only seen a handful of northbounders in the last two weeks that they’d been providing trail magic. I looked through their sign-in sheet and saw only one name I knew, Long Beard. If he’s the one I knew, I last saw him when he had Noro at Laurel Falls in southern Virginia.
More Magic
Deadbeat left the magic stop a minute or two ahead of me. Given that she’d started her thru hike three weeks after me, I didn’t expect to see her again. But I kept catching glimpses of her backpack in the distance, and eventually passed her when she stopped to filter water.
At the next road crossing, a woman sat by her hatchback in a sack chair. Her car’s open hatch revealed a cooler and boxes of goodies. The telltale signs of trail magic. Twice in one day. And on a Wednesday. I’ve only ever had double magics on weekends.
The host gave me the once over and asked if I was dayhiking - small pack, clean shaven, clean clothes, and a floofy dog – who can blame her? - so I pointed at my purple thru hiker tag. Reluctantly, she asked if I’d like a soda, but I don’t think I convinced her I was thru hiking. Then Deadbeat showed up and vouched for me. Deadbeat definitely has the thru hiker look.
Dalton
A text from Northstar got me moving again. She was parked in front of the ice cream shop in Dalton, right on the trail. She’d promised the owner that I’d be buying a cone so she could use the bathroom. I had a mission now, so Gus and I scooted on down the remaining miles to town.
While I picked out a cone, Northstar picked through Gus’ coat, checking for ticks. He’d picked up boots of caked mud but no ticks. We discovered this morning that Gus prefers sloshing through the mud to walking on the many planks and boardwalks.
As soon as he got the “all-clear” from Northstar, he climbed into the van and conked out.
I wouldn’t be far behind.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668003,"Walmart
Some Walmart stores allow boondocking. Others do not. According to the internet, Dalton’s Walmart allows overnight stays in their parking lot. But when we got there, all the lots just outside of Walmart’s main lot had signs stating that overnight campers would be towed and fined. So, we found a sunny spot on the fringe of the main lot well away from any shoppers’ cars.
We recently discovered that if you ask the store managers at the no-camping Walmart’s in advance, they will let you camp one night if you park on the edge of the lot and are discrete about it. They won’t officially give you permission, but they will tell you with a wink that no one will care if you don’t call attention to yourselves.
But after an hour, a big RV pulled in near us, pulled out their camping chairs, cracked open some beers, and started doing repairs on their rig while a half dozen visitors came and went. It had all the hallmarks of the kinds of behaviors that lead to the midnight knock. And if they got the knock, they looked like the sort to point us out to the cops. So, I pulled up my maps and started looking for alternatives.
Plan B: Tom Livardi
On my walk into Dalton yesterday afternoon, I’d passed a house decorated with all sorts of AT paraphernalia, so my first thought was to knock on their door and ask if I could park on the street out front. FarOut informed me that Tom Livardi, a well-known trail angel, owned the house and allowed thru hikers to camp in his backyard.
But when we drove up to his house, we found that his street wasn’t wide enough for on-street parking. So, I parked next door in a commercial lot before walking up to his front door to ask for suggestions about where we could go. Tom happily agreed to let us park in his backyard, but the spot he pointed at was sloped and right next to some tents. Meanwhile, the owner of the commercial lot had showed up to give us the boot. Until he met Northstar.
Northstar worked her charm, and by the time I got back to the van the guy had agreed to let us park there if we left before 8:00 am when the place opened up. I think if I’d left Northstar alone and she had time to push a bit, we’d be staying in his guestroom. The guy took a picture of our license plate, “in case something went missing in the building,” and told us to tell the cops that “Dennis said it’s okay” if they showed up to roust us in the middle of the night. I envisioned a lot of ways all that could go wrong, but by then I just wanted to go to sleep.
Heading Out
I got up early to beat our 8:00 am deadline, stopping by Tom’s house to fill my water bladder with the supply he leaves out for hikers. I noticed that he’d put out breakfast for the tenters along with some other goodies. Incredible.
I moved the van to a vacant lot across the street from the ice cream shop, and left Northstar and Gus sleeping. Gus showed no signs of wanting to get out of bed after his 19 miles yesterday, so I gave him the day off.
Goals
My goal for today was climbing Mount Greylock, a 2,000-foot ascent of Massachusetts’ highest peak, enroute to a 17-mile day with 4,800 feet of total climbing. I haven’t had that big of a climbing day since central Virginia. I looked at today’s climb as preparation for what’s coming in Vermont and New Hampshire.
My other goal was to score a room at Bascomb Lodge at the Greylock summit. I’d called and emailed them yesterday but hadn’t gotten a response. I wasn’t optimistic, but you never know.
My final goal was to find a nice coffeeshop in Dalton or Cheshire. The van’s batteries were drained this morning, so I’d had to skip my morning tea. But both towns relegated the AT to side streets away from the main drag and any potential chai lattes. Brutal.
A PUD in the Long Green Tunnel
Dalton and Cheshire are separated by about eight miles of long green tunnel, one 800-foot-high PUD, and a saw-toothed descent. Not the most exciting terrain, but at least it put me eight miles closer to Katahdin.
Cheshire’s Moment of Pride
To make up for the less-than-inspiring hike from Dalton, Cheshire offered up a concrete replica of a 1,235-pound block of cheese the town had gifted to Thomas Jefferson in 1802. I guess it’s been a while since something noteworthy happened here.
Even better, they had a Dollar General just a few steps from the trail. Incredibly, the Dollar General had no 1,000-pound cheese blocks, but I was able to procure a chocolate milk, Gatorade, and a bag of chips and eat them on the sidewalk out front while contemplating my impending climb.
Southbounders
I’d passed at least eight southbounders on the hike from Dalton to Cheshire. In general, I’ve found southbounders to be friendlier than northbounders. Maybe they’re fresher and still full of residual excitement after hiking New Hampshire’s White Mountains. I try to match their enthusiasm and listen to their stories about what’s next for me.
This morning, one of them solemnly warned me that my hike was about to get “horribly difficult” and that I’d “probably hate it.” I replied that I don’t really mind climbing and that I was looking forward to getting above the tree line, and to see Fall colors in a month.
He smugly persisted with his message of doom, so I took his cue and warned him that he was about to encounter some of the more mentally tough parts of the trail – mosquito swarms, spirit-crushing humidity, and 1,500 miles of uninterrupted long green tunnel. I probably went too far. He suddenly looked crushed as if he’d just realized he already eaten his tasty desert and now only had a plateful of bland mashed potatoes left.
Climbing Greylock
Fueled with sugar, caffeine, and the satisfaction of ruining a SOBO’s hike, I started the six mile climb up Mount Greylock. The ascent had some steep spots but nothing too punishing. If anything, the climb was a little boring, with very few views past the trees. My legs were still relatively fresh when I finally reached the summit. I’d averaged a respectable 2.4 mph on the ascent.
I checked in at the Bascomb Lodge, discovered that they were booked, and was informed that overnight parking was prohibited on the entire mountain. Then Northstar texted to let me know she’d been delayed waiting for the Progressive claims adjuster to call.  I almost decided to hike another six miles down to North Adams and meet her but decided to pace myself.
While I waited, I climbed the memorial tower, took in the views I’d earned, bought some overpriced snacks and drinks in the Lodge café, and battled the horrible Wi-Fi in the lobby. She appeared in no time, and we drove back down the mountain to North Adams for another night of Walmart, this time with the winking approval of the store manager.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668056,"Back to Business

We survived a night in the Walmart parking lot without incident. Well, with THE Incident. But no new ones. But by the time we packed up and drove back up Mount Greylock, 8:00 am had come and gone, making a late start for me. 
The clocks might have been saying “You’re late!” but the mountain top still wore a thick coat of early morning clouds. I could barely see Mt. Greylock’s tower from the trailhead when we pulled up, but when I walked by it, the clouds parted, giving it a blue-sky backdrop. Ten seconds later, storybook fog had swallowed it again.

Gus had popped out of the van as soon as we stopped, letting me know he was ready for business. And promptly did his business on the memorial tower’s sidewalk. As a (semi-)conscientious dog owner, I’d come prepared with a bag but soon discovered the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation encourages park visitors to take their trash home with them by not providing any bins. 
I’ll happily carry my own trash, but some things just aren’t going in my pack. So, Gus and I left a memorial of our own buried in their woods. A mountain under their mountain, if you will. 
Goals

Today’s hike consisted of a steep, 3,300-foot, six-mile descent from Mt. Greylock to the Hoosic River Valley, followed by a steep 1,800-foot, two-mile climb back out of the valley to a saw-toothed plateau that would take me into Vermont and then to today’s meetup point. Along the way, we’d pass the 1,600-mile marker. 
Leaving Greylock

Gus and I had the trail to ourselves, as usual, as we wound our way down the mountain through the foggy woods. The low clouds and the soggy green tunnel gave the trail a gloomy feel, and the steep, wet, rocky descent kept my eyes glued to the ground to avoid a misstep and fall. In typical AT fashion, the 3,300-foot descent included two steep climbs. The AT always seems to find a way to add a climb or two to a descent. 
As we paused yet again at another unmarked trail junction, looking in vain for a white blaze to show which branch we should take, Gus looked up at me and said, “If I owned an AT, you know what I’d do? I’d buy a bucket of white paint and mark some trees. I’d even put some blazes in places where there’s some confusion about which direction to go instead of marking every fourth tree along straight stretches that don’t have the faintest hint of a choice of trails.” 
I think Gus was still a little testy about the lack of trash cans at the summit. 
1,600 Freakin’ Miles!

Just before we reached North Adams, we passed the 1,600-mile marker which someone had made from sticks alongside of the trial. Gus excitedly ran all around the marker, knocking all the sticks out of place. Bad dog. I’d rebuild it, set up the camera, and he do it again. Accidentally, of course. 
After the fifth or sixth time, he gave me that Doodle side-eye look and wandered off to a nearby creek for a drink.  It was definitely a message, but I still don’t know what he meant. Suggestions?

The Hoosic River Valley

The trail through fringes of North Adams, Williamstown, and the Hoosic River Valley follows local streets down to the river where it crosses on a nice pedestrian bridge. Sadly, no grocery stores or cafes are found right on the route, but the Baptists had stocked some coolers at an AT Kiosk located along the way. 
The coolers had the usual snacks and cold drinks, but also had a ton of hiking supplies. I don’t know how Baptists feel about magic in general, but they’ve owned the trail magic scene since Georgia. 
An Awesome Climb

The two-mile, 1800-foot climb back out of the Hoosic Valley was steep, rocky, and for some reason, a total blast. The first mile followed a cascading stream that provided the soundtrack, distracting me from the rigor of the ascent. I passed a half-dozen hikers taking breaks, soaking their feet, and filling their water bottles along its banks. 
After the trail left the creek for the false summit of East Mountain, it headed up through a rock fall of huge angular boulders that made finding the trail a combined treasure hunt and a test of balance and agility. These sorts of climbs were annoying in Pennsylvania and New York, but here it was fun, probably due to a 20-degree temperature difference, 40% less humidity, fewer bugs, and the fact that a rocky climb was the exception rather than the rule in Massachusetts. 
The Peak of Awesomeness 
Even though East Mountain’s “summit” only had partial views of the surrounding valleys, it had a perfect lunch spot. A bright white, granitic rock outcrop formed the floor, large smooth granitic slabs provided the tables and chairs, and fragrant scrubby pines surrounded by a grove of smooth white birch made up the rest of the décor. The trees provided just the right amount of shade, filtered light, and sunshine, and were spaced perfectly to block the stiffest wind gusts but let through enough cooling breezes to keep the bugs at bay. 
I sat down and soaked up the sun, letting the breeze dry out my sweat-soaked clothes for the first time all day. Gus sat down, laid his head on my lap, ignored his kibble, and shared the best parts of my lunch. It was so delightful, we lingered as we watched the hikers we’d passed on the climb crest the summit and hike on ahead. I never do that. 
Something Different

Our lunch spot wasn’t high enough to be above the tree line, but it had the feel of being close to it. I could feel the AT whispering in the breeze that a gap in the long green tunnel, the heat, and the humidity was coming. Someday. 
The birches and scrubby pines promised a different kind of forest. For a mile or two, we walked in utter bliss. Sunlight penetrated the tree canopy. A dry breeze cooled us as we walked quietly in wonder. This is what I came to hike. All of my videos began and ended with “This is so amazing. I’m so happy.”  

Vermont

A few miles later we walked up to the “Welcome to Vermont” sign that marked the beginning of The Long Trail (LT), the oldest long distance hiking trail in the United States. The AT and the LT share the same path for the next hundred miles before the AT turns east toward New Hampshire and the LT follows the spine of the Green Mountains to Canada. 
Appropriately, the Welcome sign was surrounded by a morass of sticky mud, earning State #12’s nickname “Vermud.” As I carefully picked my way around the perimeter of the muck (and Gus went straight through), a southbounder hiked up. He told me to expect lots more mud from here to Manchester, about 60 miles north.  

Honestly, the mud could have been much worse. I always found a dry route around the worst spots, or the trail maintainers had placed little archipelagos of rocks to hop across. Gus seemed to like the direct route and hiked with boots of black mud caked to his knees the rest of the afternoon. But whenever he’d stop for a drink in a flowing stream, he get frustrated until he learned to face upstream to avoid the plumes of cloudy water trailing below him. 
Crisis Avoided

I’d been mostly out of cell range since leaving the Hoosic Valley, so when my phone rang and I saw Northstar’s icon on the screen, I stopped in my tracks. If I moved an inch, I’d be sure to lose coverage. She rarely calls unless its important. 
Sure enough, she’d had an adventure getting to our meetup spot. The comments on FarOut had described the County Road as well graded and maintained. But Northstar had crossed a tiny wooden bridge she wasn’t sure would hold the van, dodged dozens of deep mud puddles, and skirted under a forest of low-hanging trees. 
She’d finally gotten to a huge puddle that covered the whole road that was four or five times as long as the van and wasn’t sure what to do. The road was too narrow to turn around and she’d have to back up at least a mile to find a pullout. Eventually, we figured out she was with a half-mile of the meetup, so I told her to stay put and I’d be there within an hour. 
How’d You Get That Van Up Here?

After testing the mud puddle with my poles and walking enough of the road to determine it would be drivable, I moved the van up to the trail crossing to a nice boondocking spot. We got some long stares from the 4-wheelers and ATV’ers who drove by in the next few hours, but a few cars passed by as well. 
I watched one mini-SUV go by three times before it backed up and pulled in next to us. They were looking for a way to get to Risky Ranch Road, an even worse dirt road I’d passed a half-mile back. The driver, who was supporting his thru-hiking wife PUD, had been concerned about driving County Road until he seen that we’d gotten our van up here and over that bridge.  That gave Northstar a little, much-needed confidence boost about her driving skills. 
PUD was meeting her tramily, which included Thriller, who I last saw in New Jersey, if it’s the same person. They were resupplying her crew, and then would come back in the morning to hike north together. After hearing my description of Risky Ranch Road, they decided to hike the half mile down the trail rather than trying to drive. 
A Quiet Night

Other than the ATV’s that continued to roar past every so often until 11:00 pm, we had a nice quiet night in the dark woods, a welcome change from the Walmart parking lots. I slept like a rock, dreaming of State #12 and what would come next.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668057,"Puffy Time
If I’d lingered over breakfast, I would have pulled out a fleece or my puffy. But instead, I hurried through my morning chores and hit the trail by 6:30 am. I’d planned a relatively short 11.2-mile day to account for drivable road crossings and set myself up for reasonable mileage the next three days.
I needed a short day to catch up on some van-related chores. We’d emptied our water tank two days ago and had been using water jugs from Walmart until we could find a spigot. Also, we’d woken up to no electrical power the last three mornings and needed to either find a plug-in to fully charge the batteries or find a sunnier trail to hike.
Goals
So, my goals for the day were to get done early and get to work. I also planned to enjoy hiking in Vermont. I can hardly believe I’m here, with only two more states and less than 600 miles to go.
The Hike
Today’s hike started with a 1,000-foot climb, followed by several smaller ups and downs, and finished with a steep 700-foot descent into the VT9 notch. That’s right, “notch.” I’ve left “gaps” behind in the South. In New England, the narrow valleys are called “notches.”
After crossing New England’s AT, some thru hikers start using “notch” as an expletive, as in “Notch it all! I stubbed my notching toe on another notching rock.” Most other hikers just stick with their tried-and-true f-bombs.
Gus came along again today, though I had to coax him out of bed. He can rest tomorrow, when I’ll leave him home for a planned 21-mile day because the notching roads are spaced too notching far apart.
Vermont Views
I’m discovering that views will be far and view between in the Green Mountain State, unless you count views looking up at continuous tree cover. Over today’s 11-mile span, FarOut lists two view locations. The first is a powerline cut, which hardly counts, but is still a welcome break from the long green tunnel. The second is described as follows:
“Harmon Hill is a mostly wooded and grassy peak above the town of Bennington. If you search around on some of the short side trails from the AT, you may find some nice views down to Bennington.”
LOL. I can help you with some of the FarOut-speak. “Mostly” means completely. “May” means won’t. “Nice views” means the same view of trees you’ve had all day. “If you search around” means the folks at FarOut are notching sadists.
The LGT Community
Don’t get me wrong. I still love the woods. I’m at peace in the Long Green Tunnel (LGT), despite its lack of diversity. I once wrote that “my soul lives in the woods…bring on the long green tunnel,” and I still feel that way. But I’ve noticed that my soul exalts when I see the sky above and long views out in front of me.
Since the trees leafed out and the spring flowers faded, it’s been a lot of the same view. Some of my friends who quit their thru hikes blamed the trail’s monotony. After four months in the tunnel, I’m having to look harder for those moments of joy in the woods.
Today, mountain ponds and streams provided the visual relief. Sometimes, the morning mists, birds, or other critters are the highlights. Most afternoons, I lean hard on my audiobook for entertainment. And I’m counting the miles until I get some continuous views in the White Mountains.
The Third Meeting Rule
I saw Lost Child again this morning. Today, I got a smile and a sentence or two as we passed, proving my “third meeting” rule. The first time you see someone, you’re lucky to get a hello or a head nod. The second time, you get slight acknowledgement. The third time, you exchange names (yesterday). After that, you’re friends. Not hang-out-together friends, but at least we-know-each-other friends.
Homeless or Hipster?
You know that game where someone shows you a picture of a young person and you have to guess whether they’re homeless or a hipster? This morning I started playing “Trail or Canal?” as I hiked up and down yet another flowing section of trail. Vermont is a little stingy with the white blazes, upping the challenge.
At one point, I’d been hiking down an old forest road for a while and had just pulled out my camera to video an episode of “Trail or Canal?” Suddenly, it occurred to me that I hadn’t seen a white blaze for some time, and that the right answer might be neither. So, I pulled out FarOut, and sure enough, I was a half-mile off the trail, down a steep hill, and with no hope of bushwacking back along a short cut.
Then, my FarOut app hiccupped and the map and the AT icon disappeared. All I had were the waypoints, like water sources, mountain peaks, and trail junctions. I wouldn’t be able to see when I got back to the AT and would have to find a white blaze. Uh oh.
I knew I had to go back up the hill, so I started climbing, hoping the maps would recover sometime soon. Along the way up, Lost Child came down the same road. She’d made the same mistake, but at least her app was working. She turned around to follow me but fell behind immediately. When I found the unmarked turn (except for a white blaze and a pile of sticks I’d walked right over) I yelled down the trail to her that I’d found it. From the number of footprints along the road, we weren’t the only two to have missed the turn.
Katahdin
People have been posting their Katahdin summit pics on social media for the last few weeks as they finish their thru hikes. Every day, as I see their photos, I feel the pull of the end more and more. Many of them also post the number of days they took to finish, which pokes at my competitive nature. Is this a race?
It’s definitely not a race, but I’m wired that way. Seeing those numbers makes me search for excuses for my performance, question my choices about zero days and daily mileage, second-guess my start date, and wonder if I’m going to make it. It’s an easy trap to fall into.
The first time I hiked Grand Canyon rim to rim with a group of extended friends, I got sucked into the same trap. I’d been assured we weren’t racing, but the guys kept talking about their previous completion times, who would be fastest, and how long they expected to take this time. A few of them started out running, so I did too, but I hit the wall at about 18 miles and had a miserable climb out.
Eventually, I had to step aside to let a mule train pass and sat down totally exhausted. I didn’t get up for 40 minutes. Then I saw one of the shuttle drivers hiking down the trail from the North Rim. He asked me why I was sitting when the trailhead was literally 150 feet away. I’d become so focused on my time that I lost track of where I was and why I was hiking.
I don’t want to do that on the AT.
A Trail Oasis
I hiked into the VT9/Woodford Hollow trailhead parking area about 11:30 after a steep, knee-punishing descent down a long series of ankle-breaking rock stairs. All the way down, I kept up my mantra of “one bad step,” so that I’d stay focused and upright.
Chippy and Broken Branch had set up trail magic in the parking lot, something they do most weekends, though for religious reasons they call it a trail oasis, rather than use the m-word. They hadn’t been too busy that morning (I’d seen only two hikers myself), so we sat and traded stories while I waited for Northstar to arrive.
When I signed my trail name in their log, Broken Branch told me he’d been reading my blog, which made me like them even more. Such nice people. I also noticed that Lucky McShorts, Pony, and Soup are a day ahead of me after my zero day in Pittsfield. But I didn’t see any other names of anyone I’d met since New Jersey. Where is everyone?
Greenwood Campground
We knew we needed an electrical hookup and water, so we took a chance and checked out a private campground up VT9. Usually, campgrounds are fully booked on summer weekends, and usually they don’t have cell or Wi-Fi coverage. But Greenwood had one space left, Wi-Fi, clean facilities, and I could see the cell phone tower on the mountain above the camp. Perfect.
A Surprise Visit
Just after we pulled in, Northstar got a text from an old friend from Phoenix who now lives in Connecticut. Tonja been reading the blog and guessed that we might be nearby. She and her husband Bruce were out riding with their motorcycle club (Indian Bikes) and were less than 40 miles away. So, they broke away and came for a visit. We spent the afternoon sitting around the picnic table catching up on 20 years, a perfect end to a very nice day.
The only hiccup came when the campground host came by to tell us that our friends could visit for one hour, but if they stayed longer there’d be a fee. Was he notching serious? But we decided old friends were worth three dollars. Each. We’d have gladly paid much more for such an infusion of joy.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668108,"Forecast: Early Morning Light Rain Then Afternoon Sunshine. Or not.
Rain on the roof woke me at 4:45 am. “That’s nice,” I thought, “the forecasted hour of rain is coming earlier than expected. It should be done by the time I have to get up and hike.” Then I remembered that I’d left my shoes outside to dry (a dumb idea in general, I know) and scrambled out of bed to rescue them.
I went back to bed but didn’t sleep. Nor did I get up and make breakfast. I just didn’t feel like going anywhere. Certainly not on a 21-mile hike through the LGT in the rain. Eventually, I gave in to reality and got dressed, buttoned up the van, and drove back down VT9 to the trailhead.
Goals
Today’s hike called for 20.6 miles of trail and nearly 5,000-feet of total climbing, most of which occurred in the first 10 miles during the ascent of Glastenbury Mountain. FarOut promised “spectacular views” from Glastenbury’s “recently renovated lookout tower.” My goals for the day were to survive, click off some mileage, and catch the views from Glastenbury’s summit.
Gus Stays Home. Ish.
Gus really thought he’d be hiking today and tried to squirm out of the van when I left, but I thought 21 miles and 5,000 feet of climbing might be too much for him. Poor guy.
He watched me from his usual perch in the passenger seat as I crossed the parking area and disappeared into the woods. From there, I crossed the pedestrian bridge over City Creek, followed the creek downstream a hundred yards, and began the steep climb out of the notch.
I hadn’t gone more than a quarter mile when I thought I heard yelling below me. I turned and saw a small brown deer dashing along the creek trail. A deer with a curly tail. And a collar. And the yelling sounded a lot like Northstar. A second later, the little deer came back up the creek and started running up the trail toward me. It was pretty disappointed to be led back to the van. Nearly as disappointed as I was having to re-climb that part of the hill.
Might as Well Be Raining, So it Was
Despite the forecast, I got spit on most of the day. Between the sweat from climbing, the humidity, the wet vegetation hanging over the trail, and the drizzle, I walked wet all day. The muddy trail was just bonus wetness.
Everyone Else Stayed Home
The woods were dark and ghostly quiet. I heard no birds, saw no critters, felt no breeze, and had the spiderwebs crossing the trail all to myself. I passed Lost Child sitting alone by a small stream around 7:30 am but didn’t see another soul until mid-afternoon. I didn’t even see any tents. I had my own private forest.
Even the views stayed home. I passed through a wide utility corridor, but low clouds dampened the sightlines. At least I had Glastenbury Mountain’s observation tower to look forward to, and by then the clouds surely would have burned off.
FarOut-Speak
When I reached the Glastenbury summit, I became a little more fluent in FarOut-speak. By “recently renovated,” they mean recently condemned by the FAA, with the first flight of stairs removed to prevent fools like me from climbing it anyways. And by “spectacular,” they meant non-existent, unless you count the same spectacular view I’d been seeing in the thick, green woods all morning.
Well, At Least I Have…
Still, it was a nice steady climb and my legs felt strong. At least I had my book to keep me company. Except that I hadn’t realized I only had 45 minutes of it left and hadn’t downloaded the next one.
Okay, so no book, but at least it’s all downhill from to Glastenbury’s 3,749-foot summit to our meetup point on Kelly Stand Road (2,223 ft), right? But in typical AT fashion, the 2,800-foot descent included 1,800 feet of climbing.
So, I walked alone. It must have rained harder north of Glastenbury Mountain, because the trail got muddier, the rocks got slicker, and the overhanging vegetation got drippier. But I gradually approached the end. When I got within six miles of our meetup spot, I decided to text Northstar to confirm the time, but found that I still had no cell coverage.
At least I’d brought my Garmin GPS. Except that battery was completely dead. My Garmin InReach Mini2 battery will last for months if I don’t send any texts or use it to track my position, neither of which I’d done since the last time I’d charged it.
Then I remembered I’d turned it on when we’d boondocked at County Road two nights ago. I’d brought inside for the night at bedtime and had not turned it off. Apparently, it spent the night searching for satellites under the van roof which ran down its charge. Lesson learned. For next time.
For this time, it could be the beginning of a long afternoon, since I planned to meet Northstar along another dirt road that probably had no cell service.
At Last…Company
Around 2:00 pm, a southbounder passed by and told me that five or six northbounders were ahead of me, two of which were within a mile. FarOut told me I had only 4.8 miles to go, so I stepped it up a notch to try and catch them.
I reeled them in about an hour later, but they were a couple of Long Trail hikers I’d never met. We chatted briefly and I kept going, but I never caught anyone else.
You Know What This Day Needs?
Just after I passed the Story Spring Shelter, with a little over a mile to go, I climbed up a short, rocky section of trail. I stepped on a wet slanted rock, my feet slid out from under me, and I landed face first in a pile of rocks. Fortunately, I caught myself in a pushup position that took most of the force, though my wrists were bloodied. I stood up, shook myself off and finished the climb.
Two minutes later, on the descent, my lead food slipped on a muddy slope, and I went down again, this time in a baseball slide off the trail into a puddle. I was recording when it happened and got a nice video of my face, the sky spinning in circles, some notching dialogue, and then a view looking up at some dripping underbrush.
I hadn’t fallen like that since southern Virginia, when coincidentally, it was raining, the trail was slick, rocky, and overgrown, and I was exhausted from a 20-mile day. I thought I’d learned that lesson.
A Strong Finish
I hobbled up to Kelly Strand Road to find four emergency services and mountain rescue vehicles parked along the road. This was bad. Not just for whomever they’d come to rescue, but for me.
Anytime Northstar hears a siren in our neighborhood, she’s likely to call to make sure it’s not coming for me, all because of the one time that it was. So, I knew that when she drove up today, she’d see the trucks and assume the worst.
If I’d known which direction she’d be coming from I’d have walked that way to intercept her, but I didn’t, so I sat down to wait. Sure enough, she drove up, stopped the van, and stared in dismay. When she finally saw me, she just put her head down on the steering wheel.
As we drove away in search of cell service, she confessed that she really wanted to be mad at me for the shock but couldn’t figure out how to make it my fault. I could, so I quickly changed the subject and offered to take her out to dinner.
A Rare Find
We found a little bar near Mount Snow that had four bars of service, smash burgers, good service, and some locally brewed beers. Northstar ordered me a double smash burger and fries to make up for me skipping lunch, and I picked out the Switchback Ale.
I figured I needed to see at least one switchback before leaving Vermont.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668126,"Goals
We boondocked at the trailhead where I met Northstar yesterday, so this morning I just had to get dressed, eat breakfast, and walk out the door, all of which I’d done by 6:20 am. My motivation ran high today because I had Gus for company, a zero-day coming tomorrow, and a nice climb up Stratton Mountain where I’d been promised the “best views in Vermont.”
Back to the LGT
Puffy clouds sailed through blue skies above the trailhead when I left the van. The forecast called for no rain today. Finally, I’d get some views in Vermont. But not right away, as the trail plunged into the dark LGT as soon as it left the road. Because of the thick tree cover, I never noticed the clouds moving in until I’d climbed high enough that mists started swirling around me as I approached the summit.
So much for my view, unless the clouds burned off quickly or I chanced on a little gap in the clouds like the one that briefly revealed the Greylock Memorial Tower two days ago. I’d had that happen on a climb up Scotland’s Ben Nevis and several times on Grand Canyon hikes. I could always hope.
Where’d Everyone Go?
Once again, Gus and I had the forest to ourselves. Like yesterday, we saw no hikers, birds, or critters. I’d passed a tent at the trailhead, though the woods were so dark under the trees I could barely see the man standing next to it. We saw no one at all on the trail until we’d done 15 miles and were approaching Manchester.
Where is everyone? I met or saw dozens of people in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. If they fell behind, why haven’t I caught the next batch? If they all got ahead of me, which I know isn’t true, why haven’t others caught up to me?
Stratton Summit
Eventually, I reached the Stratton Summit. Without the tower and a commemorative plaque, I’d never have recognized it among the tall pines that completely blocked any chance of a view. I climbed the tower, braving the gusty wet wind and cold, as well as slick steps that were so steep Gus had to drop the stick he’d carried up from the shelter. The tower cleared the treetops but not the thick clouds, which limited visibility to about 100 feet.
A blue blaze trail split off to the north toward the Stratton Mountain ski lift. Some thru hikers take the lift down to the ski village for food and lodging, but I doubted the lift was running before 9:00 am on a Monday or in this weather. And I didn’t need food or a place to sleep. I needed to finish today’s hike and start on a zero. So, Gus and I climbed back down the tower, left the summit, and headed toward Manchester.
Off the Mountain
I supposed I could have sat around and waited for the clouds to lift, but the stiff wind and my sweaty clothes made for a chilly combination. Reluctantly, Gus and I plunged back into the LGT and the storybook mists that made roots look like tentacles and gave me the sense that the trees were awake, watching and plotting.
As we left, I checked FarOut and noted that we’d pass no overlooks, geographic features, or anything else until a few miles before Manchester. So, I pulled out the ear pods, flipped on the Audible app, and started in on Wintersteel, Book 8 of the Cradle series.
A Bright Spot
Gradually, as we descended Stratton Mountain, the clouds started to lift, and the skies lightened. When the trail popped out of the woods and joined a limited-access forest road about a mile before Prospect Rock, we actually had a sliver of blue sky above us. What a pleasure to walk the gravel surface under a sunny sky, with enough room for Gus to walk by my side instead of trailing behind. Gus loved it, excitedly dashing ahead and spinning around to look at me before running back when called. Is there anything better than a happy dog?
We stopped for an early lunch to enjoy the view of Manchester from Prospect Rock, soaking up the sun and letting a light breeze keep the mosquitos at bay. Northstar texted that she’d gotten a motel in town and that they’d let her in early, so we packed up to hustle down the meetup spot four miles away.
Is Today the Solstice?
As we left, we saw our first hiker of the day. To clarify, we saw all of our first hiker of the day. He wore boots, socks, and a backpack. And nothing else. Except a baseball cap, I guess because he thought he needed sun protection under the trees. No protection needed for the rest of him. Poison ivy, ticks, rain, mud, sun, cold, or mosquitos…no problem. Really, I loved that he wore the hat.
He said nothing as he passed, and I certainly had nothing to say. I pointedly looked the other direction, embarrassed for him, as he proved, once again, my Fundamental Law of Naked People in the Wilderness. Let’s just say Michaelangelo did not use him for a model for the David sculpture, though possibly for his less well-known depiction of a hairier, chubbier, less manly subject that probably never sold.
And no, I didn’t take a picture. Ugh.
Did You See That?
I passed two more southbounders after ugly naked guy. I thanked the first guy for being clothed and he responded that he’d heard a naked hiker was in front of him. Then he asked to take a picture of Gus. I said he could, but then asked, “Why?” He said he was documenting his hike and wanted to include a page of dogs he’d seen. But he didn’t offer up any contact information and didn’t want Gus to pose or even to face him. Weird.
The second guy knew all about the naked hiker, so I assumed they were together. From the way he talked about it, I guessed naked guy had lost a bet.
Maybe hiking alone isn’t so bad after all.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668176,"A Day of Rest
I love our zero days. I’m sure I fall behind some of the hikers I’ve just met or passed while I’m lazing about doing nothing, but after four months of walking, I really need the regular rest. Also, catching up on laundry, writing, email, and stuff at home is not fun, but it must be done.
I’d hoped to get a new water bladder and a haircut on this zero, but only managed one of them. I stopped by “Bob’s Barber Shop” in Manchester, but a sign on the door said they only had one “stylist” working today and the waiting area was jammed. I consoled myself with a hot chai latte from Starbucks, something I’d been craving for weeks.
I guess I’ll be shaggy until Hanover. If I miss out in Hanover, I’ll either have a ponytail on Katahdin or I’ll have borrowed Gus’ shaver and given myself a buzz cut.
Roll Call
I saw PUD and Thriller in town and chatted briefly with them. I think they were heading back to the trail after resupplying at the grocery store but couldn’t quite work out how or when they got here from what they said. I should catch them on the trail in the next few days.
I saw another dozen hikers I didn’t recognize plodding along the sidewalks with big packs, trekking poles, wet clothes, muddy boots, and solemn faces. AT thru hikers really stand out in the foofy town of Manchester. We’re not exactly the J Crew crowd.
All You Had to Do Was Ask
Because “Nate” asked, here’s the porcupine story. I’ll see if I have enough bandwidth to upload the video. If not, I’ll include some screenshots.
A Porcupine Story
A few days ago, I had my camera out, recording a long, semi-rational rant about something only obliquely trail related, the kind of thing Northstar rolls her eyes and chuckles to herself about when I play back my video notes in the evenings. Such rants rarely make the blog. But I digress.
As I recorded, a porcupine waddled out of the underbrush just ahead of me and climbed onto the two-plank walkway we were following through yet another mud bog. I zoomed in, momentarily forgetting that my hiking buddy was right on my heel.
My hiking buddy is as lonely as I am on the trail and is always looking to make new friends. So, he slipped silently around me, suddenly appearing on my iPhone’s viewscreen. He got within inches of his new friend’s tail. Yelling ensued, without any notching, I’m proud to say. What came out was a long, maximum volume, “Nooooooooooooo!”
Another Section Heading Because the Trek's Editor Wants One
In my head, I envisioned carrying a squirming, writhing Gus the next nine miles, and then spending my entire zero day at the emergency vet, holding Gus down while they pull dozens of quills out his face. Also, that Gus would be injured. You see, it’s not all about me and my day off.
But if Gus knows anything, it’s the answer to, “Who’s a good boy?” if only because he’s asked that question a hundred times a day. And he is. As soon as I yelled, he stopped, looked at me, and reluctantly abandoned his new potential friend and returned to his heel position. I wish I were clever enough to have said to him, “He could have quilled you,” instead of “He could have killed you,” but I’m not.
Completely unfazed by all this, the porcupine waddled nonchalantly on down the trail for 30 feet before turning back into the underbrush and disappearing.
Your Turn
Feel free to lecture me about leash laws, responsible pet ownership, wilderness ethics, etc. I’m sure that this time I’ll heed your advice, unlike all the other times.
Now take a day off yourself. You deserve one.","VT30 - Manchester
",Manchester,"Aug 15, Tue",0
The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668195,"Refreshed from a nice zero in Manchester and relaxed from a late start to let Northstar sleep in, Gus and I set out from VT 30 for a nice 17.7-mile hike over Bromley and Styles Peaks, both of which promised excellent views as a reward for the climbs.
Goals
My goals for today were to finally catch some mountaintop views and log more miles toward New Hampshire. If I hold to my itinerary, I’ll be in New Hampshire for our next zero after just six more days of hiking. Beyond that, after the next zero, my oldest son, his wife, and most importantly, our magical granddaughter arrive for a visit. We’re counting the days.
I’d done some quick math as I hiked last week and thought that I’d pass the ¾ mark today, but when I pulled out my calculator app this morning, I realized that I’d passed it on the day before our zero. I didn’t see the marker, if there was one. Still, I’m ¾ done with the AT! Woot, woot!
What’s That I Don’t Smell?
Clean clothes feel so good on my skin. And for at least an hour, I didn’t stink. Not wearing salt-encrusted pants and shirt is a joy, but clean socks are the best. It felt like walking on air. Through mud. Vermont’s mud and rocks have been tough on my shoes and feet.
I’ve got two pairs of shoes left, but both are white. Who makes white trail shoes? And who buys them? Well, when you wear size 15 shoes, you take what you can find. And you order them in advance because no retail stores stock 15’s. For a while last year, Altra was totally out of my size, except in white. I’m currently wearing my last pair of black shoes. I’d hoped to bring out the whities when I hit the White Mountains in New Hampshire, but they may appear in Hanover.
Oh For Vermont
Bromley Summit was totally socked in. The ski lift wasn’t running, visibility was less than 200 feet, and the air was wet enough that it might as well have been raining. A few hikers wandered in and out of the Ski Patrol hut, saying that it was dry and warm, but Gus was too muddy for me to check it out. Styles Peak was no better, offering no view from the lone rock outcrop that peeked through the trees.
I’m going to be 0 for Vermont on summit views. All that climbing with nothing but muddy shoes and sore knees to show for it. Climbing a mountain with no views is the outdoor equivalent of using the stairmaster at the gym. It’s just exercise with bad weather.
I talked with a young Long Trail hiker named Matt on the climb up Bromley. He’d been on Stratton Mountain about four hours after me and said the views were spectacular. Ok, Vermont, I’m starting to take this personally. I may be scraping the “I LOVERMONT” sticker off the van.
Did Someone Push the Button?
Gus and I sat on the Styles Peak rock outcrop, eating my lunch and taking in the view of cloudy nothingness. Three of the northbounders who had been on Bromley with us passed by as we packed up, and the last one stopped to say hello. But just as he spoke, a low-flying jet passed over, drowning out any chance of conversation.
And then other jet flew over, this time sounding like it was only hundreds of feet above us. In seconds, it sounded like an entire squadron was doing laps around the peak or had scrambled to prevent a Canadian invasion. I haven’t been following the news. Are we on the brink of war? Nevermind, I don’t want to know.
Vermont Needs to Step Up Its Game
I’m not one to complain […pausing while you choke back a laugh…], but Vermont really needs to step it up or it risks dropping down to Pennsylvania status. So far, it’s been muddy, rocky, rooty, rainy, and humid. And a lot of the same thing day after day. The mud that I’d been told disappeared at Manchester is back. Today, the gnats and mosquitos came out in force to add to the misery.
On the bright side, the mountain ponds and streams have been lovely, it has never gotten above 80F, and every so often I get a brief glimpse of what’s possible. I’d like an extra helping of what’s possible, please.
A Conversation
I packed up during the fighter plane attack and headed down the trail. A few minutes later I caught the hiker who’d tried to talk to me at the summit. This being the first day/second encounter, and well short of the official third day/third encounter threshold, I didn’t expect more than a nod or a hello. But as I passed, after a hello I asked, “How are you feeling about your hike?” A breach of protocol, I know, but I did it.
The guy looked me straight in the eye, another protocol breach, and said, “You know, I probably shouldn’t answer that today.” Screw protocol. I asked why. We hiked and talked for nearly three hours. Not counting my friends Dan and Brian (Buff) who came out to hike a few days with me, I hadn’t had an extended trail conversation since I met Wizz on the Roller Coaster in northern Virginia in June.
What a treat. I’d barely even seen a northbounder in the past week, let alone say anything more than “Good morning.”
Engineer Speak
Both he and I are frustrated with the trail conditions lately (mud, rain, no views) and have grown a little tired of the LGT. Since were both civil engineers, we tend to look at the trail as infrastructure and wonder why it’s been built with poor drainage, without switchbacks, and along strange alignments. That’s how civil engineers think, and I enjoyed hearing someone else speak my language.
When I asked if he had a trail name, he chuckled a little and said something I didn’t quite catch but sounded like, “Trail names are silly.” That’s AT heresy, though Warren Doyle told me the same thing when I asked him if he knew where the tradition of trail names came from. Warren Doyle is an AT legend, having thru hiked it more times than anyone else. So, we’ll just call my new friend “No Name.”
In no time, we’d hiked the nine miles to Big Branch shelter. No Name eats his big meal for lunch and likes to take an hour to cook, take off his boots, and relax. So, I wished him well, since I’d eaten lunch on Styles Peak, and headed down the trail.
AT Heresy
No Name also said something I’d just said to Northstar the night before. While talking about the cumulative effect of months in the long green tunnel he said, “At this point, I’m just in it to finish.” Or something like that. I’ve heard the same sentiment from other hikers lately. Translated, it means we’re not having as much fun as we thought we would, but we’re too stubborn to quit. Or motivated. Or committed. Or resolved.
I know exactly what he meant. It’s why I’ve been reciting my goals every day. And why I’m hoping New Hampshire’s White Mountains will provide some variety and excitement.
I think everyone is feeling it to some degree, but I have rarely heard it spoken out loud. Strangely, I found that negative message very encouraging and energizing, and I finished my day more excited about my hike than I have been for weeks.
I can’t wait for tomorrow.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668216,"Northstar Magic
We boondocked last night at the Forest Road 10 trailhead parking area. An official-looking sign said overnight camping wasn’t allowed, but Northstar had met a Ranger earlier and he’d said that if we were gone by 8:00 am, no one would know.
I know that if I’d been the one asking, not only would I have gotten a firm and disdainful “No” from the Ranger, I’d probably also have gotten detained, strip-searched, and a lifetime ban from the National Forest. I’m starting to think it might be me.
Without the previous night’s midnight motorcycles, all-night airbrakes, and penetrating headlights, I slept like a rock. When I stepped outside to “stretch” at 6:20 am, I saw No Name hiking by. He’s an early riser and says he starts hiking by 5:30 am most days. I wouldn’t be ready for an hour, so I waved and said good morning, disappointed that we wouldn’t be hiking together today.
Goals
Today’s goals consisted only of knocking out 14.7 miles as quickly as possible so I could get my writing done and hang out with Northstar. When did 14.7 miles become an easy day? Six months ago, six miles was a long day hike, and 14.7 miles was an epic day. Not that 14.7 miles is easy, because it still takes half a day to complete, but somehow that distance seems inconsequential after four months and almost 1,700 miles of daily hiking.
Adventures with Gus
Gus showed no interest in getting out of bed until I grabbed my poles. Then, suddenly he was all in, jumping and wiggling around like he hadn’t hiked 18 miles yesterday. He likes the walking but hasn’t been thrilled with Vermont’s streams and lakes. It might be the tannic acid. He’ll climb in for a drink, but after a few sips he’ll look back at me like I’ve tricked him into something unpleasant.
The rust-colored streams don’t prevent him from wanting to swim or fetch sticks, which he brings back to me at every significant water body with a hopeful look in his eyes. I stopped to let him swim at Little Rock Pond, a pretty lake ringed by thick trees and overhung by low clouds. But the lack of fetchable sticks and swarms of pesky gnats had us moving on almost immediately.
The Return of No Name
A few miles later, I hiked up on No Name. We’d just passed through a fragrant pine grove where the trail lay in a wonderfully soft blanket of brown pine needles. Even better, the layer of needles was well drained, giving us a brief reprieve from the mud.
No Name looked at my muddy shoes and the shin-high mud stains on my pants and asked if I preferred walking though the mud rather than around it. I don’t, but sometimes it works out that way if I lose my footing or make a bad guess about what’s solid ground and what’s ankle-deep goo. But from the footprints I’ve seen, I think some hikers just march straight through the muck.
Near the end of the pines, we passed White Rocks, where hikers (or perhaps wood elves) have stacked granite rocks into hundreds of balanced Jenga towers. I found the display artistic and whimsical, though from what I’ve read online, such displays give some hikers fits.
The haters go on about how the little towers disturb habitat, mar the natural scenery, and destroy the forest ecology. I find that opinion odd since the trail itself, as well as all its associated infrastructure and activity, has a far greater impact than a few hundred square feet of inert natural material. The stacked rocks didn’t seem to have any adverse impact on the squirrels, birds, ants, or gnats we saw.
The Australians
No Name and I talked and walked until we reached the shelter where No Name planned a lunch stop. I hadn’t eaten yet, so Gus and I walked up to the shelter with him. As we approached, someone called out Gus’ name and gave him a friendly head rub. It was Hammer and Corky, an Australian couple Northstar had met in Hiawassee, Georgia.
I’d never met them, but Gus had, and they remembered each other. Northstar checks their blog from time to time, so I knew they were in front of me, but I never expected to ever catch them. In fact, I didn’t. They’d reached Vermont during the July floods and had flip-flopped up to Katahdin and hiked south. They planned to finish their thru hike tomorrow at Manchester, beating me by a month and a half.
So, How’s Your Hike?
When I asked how their hike was going, I got an earful. Hammer and Corky are accomplished long-distance hikers, having completed the PCT, CDT, and a host of other long international hiking trails. Theirs were not the rantings of an unhappy rookie.
Nor were their complaints anything I hadn’t heard or felt before. The long green tunnel, the lack of views, lack of switchbacks, mud, general condition of the trail, and PUD’s all got mentioned. Corky likened her hike to an endurance race in New York City that just goes around a single city block until the last man is left standing.
I think a lot of hikers are feeling the miles, the months, the weather, and their feet. I know I am, but I am resolved to keep running around the block until everyone else quits. And until then, I’ll be doing my best to find my joy in the woods.
Roll Call
Voices and Masters had also stopped in at the shelter but planned on hiking 2.6 more miles to next road crossing to deli blaze. Deli blazing means walking a road to a deli near the trail crossing. I heard them debating whether the distance to the deli would be worth the walk, so I offered them a ride if they could keep up. I’d planned to meet Northstar at that crossing anyway and knew she was already there.
A free ride to deli-fresh food was sufficient motivation for them, so we all packed up and left No Name cooking his big meal and airing out his feet. I’d seen Voices before, but never talked to him. He has a distinctive, 12-inch-long white Gandalf beard, and is hard to miss. I’d met Masters at a trail magic outside of Duncannon, but hadn’t seen him to speak to since.
A few minutes after leaving the shelter, we passed J-Mo and Lioness at an overlook. I hadn’t seen them since the day before Great Barrington, but after a brief hello, I hurried on to meet Northstar. They must have heard our plan, because they flagged us down as we were leaving the parking lot and joined us for a crowded ride to the deli.
Walmart Again?
We dropped off our passengers at the Goucheberg Farm Market and headed down the mountain in search of cell coverage. Once again, we found ourselves in the Walmart parking lot in Rutland, but this time we headed back to the trail at sunset to camp by the trailhead.
Regardless of whether overnight parking was allowed, this Walmart didn’t seem like a safe place. I witnessed two police encounters with vagrants and a raving domestic dispute while I sat in the van writing. And we when I threw a bag of trash in the dumpster, I heard a yell from someone living in there.
Back at the VT103 trailhead, we shared the parking lot with a feral Santa motorcyclist camped under a sheet of clear plastic over his bike while hundreds of truckers zoomed past and hitting their airbrakes. Ah, the joys of the vanlife.
Hadn’t we just done this?

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668261,"Vroom, BRAHKKKKK, Vroom
Truck traffic started zooming up VT103 about 4:30 am, underscoring the difference between trailhead boondocking on remote forest roads and camping in mountain highway parking lots. One hundred air brakes later, I gave up pretending to sleep and looked out the window at the first hints of a blue-sky day.
Perfect. I’d finally catch a Vermont summit with a view.
Finally, A Sunny Day in Vermont
But you knew that’s not how this day would go, didn’t you? Vermont would not be that kind to me.
As soon as I climbed out of the van to go find a hole in the woods, I glanced west. A bank of dark grey clouds already covered the valley below us and advanced steadily toward our mountain. The rain held off just long enough for me to finish my woodsy business, letting loose seconds after I got back to the van.
Walking Wet. Again.
A quick check of the local forecast indicated steady rain most of the morning, with a slight lessening around 11:00 am, and clearing up by late afternoon. I’d be walking wet all day.
I’ve walked wet plenty of times on the AT. I’ve been rained on every day in Vermont. I could endure one more day of rain. But that doesn’t mean I have to like it.
A Revelation
Or, I realized, that I have to hike at all.
I’d never delayed my start before. I’d always marched out into the weather to take my beating and soldier on in the elements. Hikers hike, after all, or so say the hard-core types.
But I don’t report to a trail boss. No one besides you and me tracks my progress, and you won’t know what I’ve done for several days. I can do whatever I want.
I wanted to go back to bed. So I did.
Back to Bed
Northstar made space for me, reluctantly giving back the warm spot she’d appropriated. Gus opened a lazy eye, misquoted something about mad dogs and Englishman, climbed up on my lap (is there such a thing as a lying down lap?), and went back to sleep.
I’d either wait out the rain and get a late start, hoping to catch Killington as the skies cleared this afternoon, or take an unplanned zero or nero. I have options. I am not a slave to my itinerary.
Another Revelation
As it turns out, I’m not that good at napping by a noisy highway with a dog on top of me. I’m also bad at sitting around doing nothing. So, I got up, made a pot of double spice chai, and enjoyed taking my time as I wrote my blog and leisurely sipped through several mugs of tea.
I like listening to the rain on the roof. I like writing in the morning when my brain is brimming with ideas. I always have. Lo and behold, I even like being flexible with my hiking schedule. This could be the start of something new and wonderful.
The rain agreed, tapping out its approval on the van roof while I kept time tapping my keyboard.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668270,"A Ray of Hope
About 8:45 am the rain started to slacken and the sky in the west looked less ominous, which got me thinking about hiking. At 9:30, I headed out into a light drizzle, counting on the brighter western horizon to bring me some relief.
Goals
My goals for today included summiting Killington Peak, Vermont’s 2nd highest mountain with a 3,000-foot ascent. I planned to stop at US 4, an 18.1-mile day, with almost 5,000 feet of total climbing. That would leave me with a 5.6-mile day tomorrow, setting me up for another 19-mile roadless trek the next day.
I’d given up hope that I’d catch a view from Killington, but still had a chance to at least dry out after delaying my start. In two days, I planned to cross the Connecticut River into New Hampshire with less than two weeks until our granddaughter’s visit.
Wading and Climbing
The rain had destroyed the trail. Vermont’s usual mud pit had become a stream, flowing between deep puddles under dripping trees and brush that hung low over the trail, smacking my face and clothes as I passed. Fortunately, I started climbing immediately, taking me from the boggy lowlands into more solid, rocky terrain.
The trail out of the Mill River Valley climbs 1,400 feet over two miles, with the bulk of the climb coming in two half-mile, 500-foot ascents. As I scrambled up the first steep section, I saw Queso and Hot Americano up ahead pondering how to get over a particularly steep rock slick with rain. Tiger stood above them calling out suggestions.
I stopped to talk with Tiger, who I hadn’t seen since the day after I left Duncannon. I looked around for Mystery Otter, but Tiger stunned me when said his friend left the trail due to a leg injury. Mystery Otter had hiked the PCT two years ago and planned to complete his triple crown on the CDT in 2026. One bad step.
Sunny Meadows and a Jedi Warrior
I popped out of the woods briefly, surprised by sunshine on open farm meadows buried in the deep green woods. I have a long history of talking to cows, but when I stopped to chat with them about the weather and apologize for what I’d done to their cousins at yesterday’s barbeque, I noticed bright lines of light crossing their innocent faces.
It wasn’t them, it was me. A migraine aura. Now THAT’s what a rainy 18-mile, 5000-foot day needs – a migraine. My migraines aren’t as debilitating as they were forty years ago, but I still can’t see well for about a half hour and usually feel washed out for the rest of the day. Oh well, hikers hike, so I hiked on taking extra care on foot placement and anything that relied on my vision.
I ran into Cryptic Jedi at the Cold River Road crossing as he returned from deli blazing to the Stone’s Throw Farmstand. I hadn’t met him before but had heard his name from Voices and J-Mo. Cryptic hikes with the Warrior Project, a group that helps veterans assimilate to civilian life through long distance hiking.
Cryptic added the “Jedi” to his trail name after someone saw him literally stare down a tree. He told me he was looking around a tree to find the next blaze when the entire tree fell over directly away from him. The stunned bystander asked if he’d used the Force and his name was born.
Flowing Rivers
Cryptic and I hiked together, chatting off and on as we went. I was happy for the company at the two unbridged crossings of Gould Creek, which was flowing above normal due to the morning’s rains. No dry routes across were available, so we plunged into the shin deep water and waded safely across.
We’d both had swift water training and knew the still-clear, but fast-flowing water was fordable since we could see the stream bed and everything we’d be stepping on. I emerged with wet socks and shoes, glad that Gus had stayed home today. As a bonus, my pants legs were cleaner than they’d been for a week, if only for the next few minutes before we hit the next mud bog.
What Do You Think of the Trail?
At the 500-Miles-to-Katahdin marker, we ran into a Long Trail Ridgerunner who proudly asked us what we thought of his section of trail. Cryptic and I looked at each other, uncertain how to answer that question, even though we’d been discussing that exact topic for nearly an hour. Cryptic diplomatically suggested the last wet crossing could use a cable to hang on to.
The Ridgerunner turned to me. “Uh,” I said hesitantly, “It’s … as good as any other section of Trail in Vermont.” Cryptic snorted, but fortunately, the Ridgerunner took it as a compliment.
Milestones
Cryptic hung back to chat with the Ridgerunner, but I moved on with less than 500 miles to go. At first, 500 miles seemed like Katahdin was just around the corner. Then, I thought about how long it had taken to get to the 500-mile mark in Virginia and what kind of terrain lay between me and the end of the trail. 500 miles is still a long walk.
A few minutes later I walked past the 1,700-mile marker which someone had built from sticks alongside the muddy path. By that point, I’d begun the 3,000-foot climb up to Killington Peak, so I only lingered for a minute, just long enough to film Cryptic almost hike right by without seeing the marker.
A Turning Point
I felt great on the six-mile climb, even with wet feet from the two river crossings, post-migraine malaise, and the off-and-on drizzle and storybook mists that kept me from drying out. At the trail’s high point near the Cooper Lodge (shelter), a trail sign surprised me with the realization that the AT didn’t actually summit Killington. The sign pointed me toward a 0.2-mile blue blaze trail to the summit which was another 331 feet higher than the junction point.
I stood at the junction in a light drizzle with wet mists swirling around me. Except for a few brief windows, the skies had been cloudy and rainy all day. What was the point of making a steep (31%) climb to stare at the insides of clouds in a cold, wet wind? I’d seen enough cloudy summits in Vermont.
But something urged me to go. It might have been No Name’s comment yesterday that he planned on blue blazing all the summits in New Hampshire’s White Mountains. It might have been the fact that I’d already climbed 99% of Killington Peak. Finally, I told myself it was only 0.2 miles. At least I could say I was there.
Another Cloudy Summit?
The blue blaze path to the top was easily as steep, rocky, and slick as anything I’d hiked on the AT so far. As expected, when I got to the summit, clouds blanketed the towers and blocked out any views. I stood on the glacially carved granitic peak and stared into the white nothingness, preparing to climb back down to the AT.
And then I thought I saw a faint outline of the next mountain range through the fog, making it the best mountaintop view I’d had in Vermont. Then I looked down and caught a clear view of a river winding across the valley floor, thousands of feet below. Next, I started seeing individual wisps of clouds racing by, as if the cloud bank were breaking apart.
Five minutes later, just as Cryptic crested the summit, the sky broke open, giving us clear views in all directions capped by wild storm clouds painted over a bright blue background. We looked out in awe between the clouds, both above and below us, as well as in every direction around us. Then, just as suddenly, clouds socked in the summit again.
Energized
I hiked off the summit triumphantly, completely energized by what I’d experienced. I practically floated down the mountain, so excited I forgot to eat lunch. At some point during today’s excitement, my weeks-long funk dissipated like the clouds on the summit. This was fun. It was an adventure again.
Choices
Two and a half miles from the summit junction, the AT branches again. To the right, the official AT follows a newly built alignment described as being “in better condition.” To the left, the old AT, which is now a blue blazed trail, skirts along the edge of the Pico Mountain Ski Resort. That trail is described as having “better views” though it is less well-maintained and harder to follow. The mileage along either option is about the same.
Cryptic, Matt, and another LT hiker had stopped at the junction, but were all sticking to the official trail. I wished them the joy of purity as they departed, but for me, it was an easy choice. I’ll take the views and the wilder trail every time. I’ve found that taking the less traveled road feels wilder, more adventurous, and more like backcountry hiking.
An Inkling of an Idea
My blue blaze took me directly to The Inn at the Long Trail, though it failed to deliver on any views. I’d originally planned to finish at US4 near the Inn, an iconic AT stop due to its hiker-friendly hospitality and its location at the split between Vermont’s Long Trail and the AT. But somewhere on the descent, I saw an opportunity.
Northstar had been feeling down for a few days and needed some TLC. I’d hoped to take care of that during tomorrow’s 5.6-mile nearo day. What if I combined today’s hike with tomorrow's nearo and gave her (and me) an unplanned day off?
I called her and asked her preference. She was all over that like mud, stink, and mosquitos on a Vermont hiker. Well, no, not like that. Something better. But you get the idea. She was happy.
Finishing Strong
My legs still felt good, but I had five miles to get to tomorrow’s meetup location. Midway through the extra miles, I passed through Gifford Woods State Park and saw a sign for the ALDHA (Appalachian Long Distance Hiking Association) trail magic. Because of my delayed start and the extra miles, I was racing the sunset, but I needed a cold drink.
I walked into their campsite to find a dozen hikers and magicians, none of whom I’d met before. The host looked me up and down, clearly trying to decide if I was a thru hiker. I could see him considering my “tiny” pack and my relatively clean-shaven face and trimmed beard, but then he settled in on my mud-caked pants and shoes, and said, “Well, you’re muddy enough to be a thru hiker” and offered me something from the grill. They welcomed me in, gave me a chair, handed me the sign-in log, and pointed me at the cooler. They even had my drink of preference, an ice-cold lime La Croix.
That was the first time in 1,712 miles that I’d been identified as a thru hiker by a stranger.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668297,"What a Perfect Day to Not Hike
Yesterday ended up being a 23.3-mile day. Northstar had been the one who wanted a day off, but when I got up, saw the weather report, and heard the rain on the windows, I thanked my lucky stars she’d picked today for a rest day. My feet still hurt from yesterday’s long walk, and I had no desire to test out Vermont’s newly refreshed mud pits.
Killington Village
We drove into Killington Village around lunchtime, expecting to find something akin to Aspen or Breckenridge, given all I’d heard about Killington Ski Resort growing up in New York. But Killington Village is as different from western ski resort towns as Vermont is from Colorado, so we ended up back the Inn at the Long Trail eating out of van’s larder.
The Inn at the Long Trail
The Inn at the Long Trail is a hiker-friendly AT icon. It sits at the junction where Vermont’s Long Trail continues north along the spine of the Green Mountains and the AT turns east toward New Hampshire. They offer a special hiker rate (or free tenting across the highway), beer, and bus service to grocery stores, outfitters, and restaurants in Killington.
The motel and bar are Vermont-style rustic, which means lots of wood paneling, woodsy décor, and photographs documenting its long history. It also means some stuff doesn’t work, like the gas fireplace in our room, hot water in the shower, and some of our door handles. None of that was a problem, it was just … rustic.
The Irish bar/restaurant offered live music with an Irish flavor and a huge slab of granitic gneiss (bedrock) sticking through the floor and serving as an end table. Rooms come with a free breakfast and the best maple syrup I’ve ever had (I don’t normally like it).
After an evening listening to the band, Northstar decided we need to hike Ireland next. I’m in. No chance of rain or mud there.
Mud Report
I talked to a local in the bar who told me that this has been the wettest, muddiest, buggiest August anyone can remember. He said the trail has been as muddy as it gets during snowmelt season. I believe it, though a Long Trail hiker disagreed, saying the mud is worse in the Spring. They agreed that the trail conditions are awful right now.
I guess I’m proud to have survived it. So far.
Rest
Northstar got what she needed out of the day, which included a nap, a nice dinner, and charming the musicians in the Irish Pub into playing some of her favorite tunes. We also planned our visit with our son’s family coming up in a few weeks. There will be some AT hiking and multiple zeros.
We weren’t the only ones dodging the weather. We saw Voices, Masters, Pony, Soup, and a half-dozen other hikers in the restaurant.
Like them, we did mostly nothing all day, the best kind of zero.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668344,"What Are You Doing Here?
Hikers dominated the breakfast room at the Inn. Pony and Soup had one table with two new friends, plus Matt the Long Trail hiker, who’d taken a zero and joined them. Hikers filled four other tables. At least I assumed they were thru hiking based on the snippets of conversation I overheard. Nobody else would be that interested in gear and miles.
I didn’t see him when we came in, but when he got up to leave, I saw No Name. I’d thought he’d be a day ahead of me after our zero. I knew he planned to stay one night at the Inn, but figured he’d moved on already. No, he told us, he got up yesterday morning, saw the weather, and decided it was time for a zero.
But today he’d be starting from the Inn, nearly five miles behind me, and probably wouldn’t catch up to me for another day.
Northstar’s Shuttle Service
After breakfast, Northstar drove me back to River Road where I’d stopped two days ago. As we pulled out of the Inn’s parking lot, Pony’s new friend flagged us down and asked for a ride to the Base Camp Outfitter down the highway. No problem. We’ve given a ton of rides to hikers.
After a late breakfast, some last-minute chores, and some shuttling, I didn’t hit the trail until 9:00 am. Given my 18.1-mile itinerary, I’d probably finish late too.
Goals
Today’s goals were simple. I wanted to log miles toward New Hampshire and check off another day until our granddaughter arrives. With a great weather forecast today, I didn’t need much other motivation.
Dry and Muddy
Weather sure makes a difference. The forecast called for no rain, cool temperatures, and nice puffy clouds in a blue sky. Great hiking weather, except for the humidity. The trail was slick from yesterday’s rain and the trail mud had been refreshed to maximum Vermont levels, but there was still less of it than I’d slogged around most of last week.
As I skirted around one large mud bog, I stepped over a fallen log and my foot started to slide, twisting my knee. But I caught myself with my trekking poles, leaning backwards and holding on for all I was worth. I could have easily torn up my knee on that one, which would have ended my hike. That is why I always use two poles. They’ve saved me more times than I can count.
Ladders and Dogs
Later, I encountered my first trail ladder. I have no idea why the trail just doesn’t go a different way, but it didn’t. Instead, it went straight over a 12-foot vertical cliff. The AT geniuses that picked that alignment had tied an aluminum extension ladder to the cliff and put a little white blaze on it to let us know that was the way down. I’m okay with ladders, but Gus was skeptical.
Usually, I’ll just let him find his own way down the steep sections, but today I was worried he’d jump when he saw me get to the bottom. Last summer, he jumped off our second story deck trying to reach his four-footed nemesis next door. Northstar saw him go over the railing and ran out expecting the 13-foot drop to have cost him a broken leg, but he was just a little mad that he hadn’t cleared the neighbor’s fence.
Today, however, I coaxed him over to the ladder and carried him down in my arms.
Something Different
Even though once again the trail didn’t provide any scenic vistas, unless you count the same old view of green trees, it did serve up a few differences. I saw a hobblebush with red leaves. In Georgia, hobblebush blossoms were harbingers of Spring. In Vermont, perhaps they’re signaling the beginning of Fall color.
The trail was different in one other way today. It was empty. All those mud-loving, fresh-faced, optimistic Long Trail riffraff were gone, split off to the north for another two hundred miles of Vermont muck and gnats.
Flooded River Crossings
Every brook ran high today after all the recent rain. I crossed at least three unbridged streams, once by jumping from stone to stone and twice on wobbly logs. In July, a thru hiker named Steady Eddy drown trying to ford a flooded stream crossing. The folks at the Inn told us he’d been warned to stay in that day. A poster with his picture and a memorial poem stuck to a tree marked the crossing where he lost his life. Fortunately, none of today’s crossings were anywhere close to flood levels.
I worked a civil litigation case in Arizona in the late 90’s where a flash flood flipped a carload of Boy Scouts that had been stuck in a stream crossing. The surviving mom’s deposition, where she described been swept down the flooded stream was the most emotionally draining thing I’ve ever read.
After their SUV flipped, she watched her son get swept away while she tumbled down the rocky stream herself. She grabbed another boy only to have to let him go after his panicked thrashing knocked her off her feet and sent them back into the current. The boy she let go drowned, as did two other boys and another adult. Only after hours of searching did she find her son, who survived but was injured and severely traumatized.
Stay out of flooded river crossings.
Dang it, FarOut
As I got close to our meetup spot, I took a quick look at the FarOut app to check the distance. Only 1.5 miles. Sweet. I texted Northstar to let her know I’d been there in 30 minutes.
After walking 20 more minutes, I didn’t feel like I’d made progress toward the valley bottom, so I looked at FarOut again. 2.6 miles to go.
FarOut got me again. I hadn’t waited long enough for FarOut to refresh my GPS location. It’s a glitch in its software. When you first open it up, it always plots your position inaccurately and then computes the remaining distance based on the wrong location. Heartbreaking.
Fearless
Northstar was hanging out with a small crowd outside the van when I finally arrived at the VT 12 parking area. She had the sack chairs set up and was in the middle of a lively conversation. Most of the crowd were southbounders, but all of them had just come back from a bakery/deli a short walk down the highway.
A young lady named Fearless occupied our other sack chair. Northstar had met her at the bakery and helped rescue her from a pesky pink blazer. Pink blazing is following a female hiker in hopes of romance. Northstar described the guy as having a hungry look, and not in a good way. Fearless wanted a ride to West Hartford, 14 miles up the trail, so we packed up and delivered her, listening to her story along the way.
No Fear
She’s from Switzerland and had intended to hike from Pennsylvania to Maine but was having a rough go. Besides her pink blazing would-be suitor, her hiking partner had just quit the trail after becoming disenchanted with the weather, bugs, and trail conditions. Fearless said that what she called the monotony of the trail had taken its toll on her too, and that she’d found most thru hikers to be unwelcoming because she was a section hiker, not counting her amorous pink blazing friend.
Given all that, she was in remarkably good spirits. She hoped that our yellow blazing ride would not only put her far enough ahead of the pink blazer but would help her catch the group she’d fallen behind to hike with her slower ex-hiking partner.
Trail Magic
Fearless had no idea where in West Hartford she wanted to go, so we pulled into the local library’s parking lot across from the White River Bridge. I noticed a public Wi-Fi sign on their kiosk, so we decided to park there for a few hours rather return to VT 12 where we only had sporadic cell service.
Just before sunset, as we packed up to return, Fearless knocked on the door. Two ladies in the house next door to the library had seen her looking at her map and had invited her up to their porch for rice pudding. Then they’d offered her a tent spot in their backyard. She came by with some chocolate as payment for the ride.
All in all, that was a pretty good day.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668378,"Vanlife
We boondocked at the VT12 trailhead parking lot, which had just enough space for the van and possibly two Prius. Priuses? Priusi? But the July floods had done so much damage to the trailhead, bridge, and parking area, I doubt a Prius would have been able to navigate the driveway.
Hold on, hold on, I know how sensitive Prius owners can be, but I’m one of you. We just donated ours to the Red Cross in February after 17 years and 189,000 miles of saving the planet.
Fortunately, we didn’t have to share the parking lot with any Priusi and we were gone before any day hikers showed up.
Goals
I’d planned a 19.2-mile hike today, but when I checked the map before I left this morning, I discovered Hanover was 22.6 miles away, not 19.2. It was that same mileage error I’d experienced at Great Barrington when I crossed between FarOut map segments. I wasn’t thrilled about a 22.6-mile day, given the terrain, climbs, and likely trail conditions. But I was even less thrilled about staying one more day in Vermont.
So, today’s motivational goals included: (1) Get out of Vermont, and (2) Get into New Hampshire. Plus, check off one more day until our magical granddaughter arrives. And her parents too, of course.
Same ‘Ol Vermont
Don’t get me wrong, I love Vermont. But I don’t think I’ve seen it at its best, and its AT needs a little TLC. Sure enough, the trail was once again buried in the long green tunnel. In places, brush, grass, weeds, and branches leaned so far over the path that I walked by faith, not sight. I literally could not see the ground or my feet. And my pants and socks were soaked from the dew.
Locals told me that the summer floods diverted resources from trail maintenance to emergency road and infrastructure repairs. That may be, so I’m giving Vermont a pass. In fact, I met five hikers in New Hampshire who completely gave Vermont a pass, hitching rides from Massachusetts to Hanover, skipping the entire Green Mountain State.
Today’s hike had no big climbs, but all the little ones added up to 5,700 feet of total elevation gain, with somewhat more elevation loss as the trail dropped out of the mountains to the Connecticut River. The air was cool, but humid, causing me to take off my sopping wet outer shirt after one of the first climbs, and take my chances with the gnats and mosquitoes.
Don’t You Wish We Were Hiking This 200 Years Ago?
As I stood next to the trail wringing out my shirt before stowing it in my pack, a burly, beardy thru hiker came up the trail and stopped near me where the one-track path joined an old forest road. He saw the forest road, which was bordered by a mossy stone wall, grunted in disapproval, and said, “Ugh, a road. I hate road walking. Don’t you wish we could have hiked this road 200 years ago when it was all farms, wagons, and sheep?”
As you know by now, I love the old forest roads. They’re wider, smoother, and less steep than the rest of the AT, and they often have interesting historical artifacts nearby. But I still found his comment confusing. Does an old dirt road that probably hasn’t carried a vehicle for 50 to 100 years count as “road walking?” If he hated road walking, why did he want to walk it 200 years ago when it would have been in better condition? And why sheep?
Then I noticed his ultralight pack, carbon fiber hiking holes, lightweight trail runners, polyfiber clothing, and cell phone. Did he expect to bring all that back with him on his time travel hike to the early 1800’s? Back then, young men who spent their summers hiking instead of working were regarded as worthless bums, not adventurous thru hikers.
All those questions flashed through my mind in an instant. But of course, all that came out of my mouth was, “Uh, I like forest roads.” The guy gave me a disgusted look and sped off.
West Hartford
Around lunchtime, I hiked into West Hartford, the community where we’d dropped off Fearless last night. After six hours of hiking, I’d developed little hot spots on two of my toes and my knees hurt. I attributed the pre-blister hot spots to not washing out my socks, which were a little crispy from all the mud. My knees hurt because I’ve been abusing them for four months. And because I’m old. Lots of things hurt.
I stopped in at the public library, hoping to refill my water bladder and use the facilities, desperately on both counts, having drunk three liters of water this morning. Alas, the library was closed on Mondays.  And Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, though the Monday closure was the key today.
FarOut informed me that no other public facilities existed in this metropolis, and I had a 0.8 mile walk before I reached the woods again. Then I remembered the nice old ladies who’d helped Fearless last night and walked over to ask if I could fill up at their water spigot.
Secret Trail Magic
Sure enough, they were sitting on the porch. Had they ever left? They invited me up for a cold soda out of their mini fridge, to sample any of the snacks laying out on the table, and to rest on the comfy chairs on their shady porch. They even had a porta-potty for hikers next to their garage. Permanent, unadvertised, secret trail magic. Sweet.
I thumbed through the hiker log, paging back to see who else had found this place. Voices and Masters had stopped by earlier today, and J-Mo and Lioness the day before yesterday. A week and a half ago, Black Dog and Mantra, who I’d last seen along the Blue Ridge Parkway in early June, had signed in. And dozens of hikers I’d never met. I guess the place is not so secret after all.
The old ladies, who had kept up their own conversation about local affairs since inviting me up, saw me looking at the register and asked if I recognized any names. I said yes and that I’d been surprised to see a few that I thought were behind me. They laughed and said, “That happens a lot. I guess a blaze is a blaze, whether yellow or white.”
Yellow blazing means catching a ride in a car to skip portions of the trail, named for the yellow lines on the highway. I’m starting to think yellow blazing is a lot more common than the popularized AT culture will admit.
What a Nice Town
The ladies pointed me at their water spigot with an odd smile, where I filled up before moving on. Later on, when I took my first sip, I discovered why they were smiling. The water “had a little extra,” as my Great Uncle Alec would say when we drank from his tap. Sulphur and who knows what else. Two hundred years ago, their water could have been bottled and sold as “the cure.” Today, we wrinkled our noses at the smell and wonder what toxins are in there.
The next house I passed had the most elaborate trail mileage sign I’ve ever seen on the AT, complete with a surrounding flower garden and a marker describing the house’s history. After that, I saw a white-haired man sat in a rocking chair on the porch of a restored, circa 1880 schoolhouse. He waved, called me over, and chatted about his home (purchased for $15,000 in 1968), the weather, and the trail. His neighbor waved as I walked past.
To heck with Hot Springs and Damascus. West Hartford, Vermont is the friendliest AT town I’ve walked through.
The Last Leg
I wasn’t excited about the next 10 miles, with another long climb and then a sawtoothed descent into the Vermont side of Hanover’s suburbs. I met Stallion on the climb. He started May 9, a full month after me, and is crushing the AT. He’d taken a zero at Killington and gone mountain biking for the day with a friend. Must be nice to have young legs.
Just before I left the woods near Norwich, Vermont, I met Skitch (or something similar) and walked with him along the sidewalks into Hanover. He had met Northstar at a trail magic somewhere in the south, knew about our van, and said he’d seen me off and on for a few months. I don’t recall ever seeing him.
We groused and laughed about our sore feet, poor blazing in New York and Vermont, humidity, and PUDs. His AT hiking partner had just quit in Connecticut, worn out and tired from the long green tunnel, and he seemed a little lonely. We both have our eyes on the White Mountains and Katahdin and are committed to finishing well.
New Hampshire
We rounded a bend and saw the bridge over the Connecticut River that leads to New Hampshire. Finally! Skitch planned a zero in Hanover but didn’t know where. I was meeting Northstar, of course, and I had a surprise for her.
The Gift of the Magi
One of my blog reader had invited us to stay at a private nature reserve near Hanover. We’d have the place all to ourselves. The pictures she’d sent looked incredible. I thought I’d surprise Northstar with something better than another Walmart parking lot.
But when Northstar met me at the Dartmouth Boating Club across the bridge, she surprised me with a motel reservation and a plan for a zero day. A non-refundable motel reservation. And she’d already checked in. Surprise! So I texted our would-be host to explain the situation, thank her for her kindness, and say sorry for any inconvenience.
The motel shower, cushy bed, and delivery pizza were lovely. And a day off before starting the White Mountains after a 23-mile day was a really good idea.
Well done, Northstar.

By now, most of you know how we spend our zero days.
We did all that, plus I finally cut my hair. Tentman has been relentless that I should cut it myself, so I pulled out my beard trimming clippers and did it. The results were a little shocking and I’m pretty sure I felt the Blood Mountain lady’s heart break as my lustrous white locks fell into the motel sink, but I won’t be as sweaty or as subject to daily bedhead. But I digress.
Dinner Anyone?
Lori, the blog reader who had invited us to stay at the private nature reserve near Hanover, contacted us to invite us to dinner at the preserve owner’s home. They’d both been reading the blog and wanted to meet us. But when someone you don’t know invites you to dinner, some questions immediately pop into your mind. For instance:
Am I being recruited as an Amway or Essential Oils distributor?How long can I hold a polite smile while listening to their bizarre religious/political views?Will I end up chained to a wall in their soundproof basement?
As if she anticipated these kinds of questions, Lori forwarded our host’s Wikipedia page. Who has their own Wikipedia page? I don’t. Northstar doesn’t, and she’s pretty darn interesting.
Well, That's Impressive
So, we read Steve’s Wikipedia biography. Descendent of a Colonial Connecticut governor, a Gerald Loeb Award winner, Harvard graduate, Army veteran, Wall Street Journal writer, magazine publisher, owns a spectacular nature preserve, blah, blah, blah. Pretty much a run-of-the-mill New Hampshirite.
Then I read that he’d sailed a 38-foot cruising sloop across the Atlantic and wrote a book about it. More recently, he’s been writing books about historical figures who catch his fancy. Now we’re talking! This is my kind of guy. Plus, he’s 89, so if he invites me down into his dark basement, I think I could take him in a clean fight. We said yes.
My Dinner With Lori
It was an enchanting evening with great conversation, delicious food, and a wonderful setting. We sat around his backyard fire pit overlooking a lush garden eating Ramunto’s pizza, drinking Vermont craft beers, and talking. No, not just talking. Conversing.
When was the last time you sat down and had a great conversation with smart, insightful people with deep life experience who are also great listeners? It had been a while for me. We talked about literature, sailing, hiking, the AT, writing, work, adventures, and family, the conversation flowing like a gentle breeze - refreshing and heading in its own direction.
I mentioned how much I’d enjoyed photographing the colorful variety of mushrooms along the trail, and Steve pulled out a book about Mushrooms written by his late wife. Lori and Northstar discovered that they both had been teachers and loved writing, Lori having recently published a book about hiking with her dog.
By the Way, What's a PUD?
As we left, Lori asked one more question, “What’s a PUD?” That’s an easy one – it’s a pointless up and down, like when the AT climbs straight up a long, steep hill only to miss the summit or any view before heading back down the mountain.
Which reminds me, if you have any other questions, feel free to invite us to dinner on our upcoming zero days.","Hanover, NH

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668435,"Dartmouth
I only planned on 14.5 miles today, so we lingered over breakfast and took our time packing up. I pulled out a new pair of shoes to celebrate a new state. This pair should take me to Maine.
Northstar dropped Gus and I back at the Connecticut River Bridge. Dartmouth College dominated our walk through Hanover, from the Dartmouth Boating Club by the river where we started, past ivy-covered academic buildings, through a posh shopping district, and finally to the athletic fields almost two miles later where we finally left the pavement for the woods.
Goals
Now that I’m finally in New Hampshire, I’ve had to re-think my short-term goals. I guess I’m hoping to see a moose on its namesake mountain today, though I won’t hold my breath. I wouldn’t mind catching No Name, but I’m guessing that he’s still more than a day ahead of me. Other than that, I’m looking forward to the White Mountains and seeing my granddaughter in a week.
Perfect Hiking Weather
Finally, I caught some decent hiking weather. Check that, perfect hiking weather – chilly, dry air, sunny with puffy clouds, and a breeze. Good weather makes such a difference. The tunnel was just as green as it had been for weeks, but the blue sky above let sunlight down through the leaves creating a filtered, dappled tapestry along the path. Even better, the bugs disappeared, and the birds reappeared.
Today, the trail had views both under and over the trees. Sidehill trails and an open understory provided long views under the tree canopy, which I love. And some cliffs and clearings allowed even longer views across the green hills and valleys after I’d climbed to elevation. I even got to walk some meadows gone wild with flowers.
This is what I’d imagined when I’d dreamed of thru hiking the AT.
Welcome to New Hampshire
I passed a young couple struggling up the climb out of Hanover, no doubt with heavy packs after resupplying in town. I welcomed them to New Hampshire and congratulated them on getting out of Vermont. They looked at each other sheepishly before answering, “Actually, we skipped Vermont. We just couldn’t face the mud and wanted to get to the good stuff.”
I laughed and told them it's their hike, they can do whatever they want with it. The woman said she’d started out as a purist, unwilling to skip even a few feet of trail or consider a blue blaze. Now she just wants to hike what she wants to hike. Good for her. Own your own hike.
Then I asked her if her thru hike had met her expectations, to which she replied, “Yes and no.” When I asked for examples of each, she said that she loved the social aspect of the trail, meeting people at shelters and hostels. But she wouldn’t name anything that she didn’t like. That’s a typical response, as most people don’t like to admit to having negative feelings about something they’ve invested so much time and energy in.
Hiking Alone
I had the trail to myself after passing the rest of the young couple’s tramily. I enjoyed the Dartmouth Outing Clubs funky trail signs and had a lovely view near the peak of South Moose Mountain, though neither it nor its northern twin delivered a moose. I did get to see a flock of turkeys in a forest clearing though.
On the final descent, two young thru hikers caught and passed me, a relatively rare occurrence. I tried to hold them off, but it just wasn’t my day. At least it wasn’t my day for speed. Everything else about this day was perfect.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668486,"Morning Mists
An enchanting fog, wet enough to make the leaves drip like rain, swirled through the trees and floated sleepily down Upper Goose Pond Road at our boondocking spot. When I climbed out of the van this morning, the chill air whispered that crisp Autumn would soon replace Summer’s heat and humidity.
A hazy sun tried to burn through low mists hanging over a broad swamp the trail crossed on parallel wooden planks just before it started climbing out of Goose Notch. As I stood on the wobbly planks, shivering and scouting for moose, I tried to remember where I’d stowed my long johns, fleece, and hat months ago. I wouldn’t need them today, but I will soon.
Some mornings are magical. Some are full of promise. This morning was both.
Goals
Today’s goal was to climb well on three significant ascents that added up to more than 6,000 feet of total elevation gain over 19.6 miles, a good test for when I entered the heart of the White Mountains in a few days. Hopefully, I’d catch some views with all that climbing.
Climb #1: Holt’s Ledge
The climb up Holt’s Ledge wasn’t particularly steep, muddy, or steppy, but the 1,200-foot ascent had my blood pumping enough that I stopped to remove a layer as I took in the view from one of the many lookouts along the way. Rivers of thick clouds flowed through the valleys below, making islands of the mountains and marking out the lakes and rivers.
Chain link fences cordoned off the highest cliffs at the summit, protecting falcon hunting habitat and probably more than a few inebriated frat boys, given the proximity to the top of Dartmouth’s ski lift. I discovered the ski center after missing an unmarked turn, walking a half-mile downhill, and realizing I hadn’t seen a white blaze for a while.
I hiked back uphill, found the turn, and noticed that someone had pulled all the branches that blocked the wrong path into the underbrush, probably to clear the way for hikers coming from the ski slopes. I reblocked the false trail and continued hiking, wishing I’d brought a can of white paint. Trail junctions have been poorly marked since New York.
Even with the extra mile, climb #1 was so satisfying. I felt strong and caught some epic views. I even saw my first fall color, two red trees standing alone on a distant mountainside.
A Blue-Ribbon Blue Blaze
The descent off Holt’s Ledge ended at Dorchester Road, an unpaved rural lane that leads to the Dartmouth Ski Lodge. I opened my FarOut app to figure out where the trail went and noticed that it paralleled the road, recrossing it 1.9 miles north. Since Dartmouth had already given me an extra mile, I thought it owed me a break. I took the road.
I’m glad I did, and not just for the chance to briefly escape the path of the white-blazing sheeple glued to the ATC-mandated track. I came to see the woods, but not just the woods. My occasional blue blazes take me past other parts of Appalachia that the trail avoids. I like seeing the homes, communities, and people who live in these mountains.
I passed a variety of beautiful and rundown homes and cabins, rustic and restored barns, and dilapidated and gentleman’s farms. I even passed an interesting sculpture garden comprised of what I guess were huge steel milk-bottle people. But acres of manicured and natural wildflower displays outshone the other art. I hadn’t seen flowers like that in months.
Two of the three cars that drove by stopped to ask if I needed anything, and one of them offered me an “ice-cold seltzer,” telling me I could leave the can on her car at the trailhead up the road. The third one, an old pickup truck, nearly ran me off the road.
I’d have missed all that if I’d stuck to the official trail.
Climb #2. Lambert Peak
The 2,400-foot climb up Lambert Peak took a little more time and effort than the first climb of the day, but it delivered a better payoff. The trail passed several overlooks from glacially sculpted granite outcrops, and continually offered glimpses of the surrounding valleys through the trees. The steep ascent had me sweating, and one short climb on iron rungs driven into a steep bedrock slab gave me a boost of adrenaline.
Near the halfway point, I saw a fire tower a thousand feet above me on the next ridge and decided that would be where I’d eat lunch. Climbs like this were what I envisioned when I set out on the AT. It’s been a long time coming.
I arrived at the fire tower to find it open, with 360-degree views from the glassed-in observation deck, and perfect weather for change. Like every other tower I’ve climbed along the AT, and most of the shelters I’ve stopped at, some turd named “Smokemaster” had left his signature in black marker on the wall.
Lunch With Beardy
When I climbed down the tower, Beardy and the lady who’d given me the seltzer were having lunch and talking about road walking in the Shenandoah’s. The lady made a point of telling me I’d been off the trail when we met. She didn’t like my explanation that I knew exactly where I was, but every once in a while, you have to stop following the sheep along the white blazes. If I had stuck to the trail, I’d have missed out on a nice cold drink, as well as all the other cool things I’d seen.
She must be a purist, because she gave me a bit of a stink-eye as she hurriedly packed up and left, while Beardy and I compared notes on other blue blazes and road walks we’d enjoyed in Pennsylvania, as well as how much we’d enjoyed the trail today and yesterday.
Beardy went on to say that trail conditions had sucked for a while. He’d lost a friend who’d quit in Connecticut, saying the heat, humidity, and bugs were just too much. They’d hiked together since Georgia.
I wonder how many times I’ve heard hikers say that lately. And I wonder how many thru hikers have dropped out in the last month. Too many. If you’ve made it this far, you probably have the legs to get to Maine. At this point, it’s a mental game.
Climb #3: Mt. Cube
After the first two climbs, the hike up Mount Cube was an afterthought, even though at 1,700 feet, the ascent was no cake walk. The summit offered views from pine-bounded rock ledges, but I was too tired to sit and savor them. Plus, the gnats had come out as the clouds had blown in, so I hurried down the mountain to meet Northstar before the rain arrived.
Like Medicine for My Soul
I finished the day tired, footsore, and a little hangry. I hadn’t managed my eating and water intake very well, leaving about half of my 3-liter water bladder and most my lunch untouched. I’d only taken one break, my lunch stop at the fire tower. And I’d hiked alone all day, seeing only two northbounders and only speaking to Beardy at lunch.
But I had so much fun. I loved this hike. I loved enjoying the AT again, two days in a row. The weather was superb. The trail was in great condition, with nice views, minimal mud, and clear walkways.
I don’t know what tomorrow will bring, but today was medicine for my soul.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668555,"Decisions, Decisions
Now that was an easy choice. I could either do 19.2 miles today, including Mt. Moosilauke, or 11 miles and leave Mt. Moosilauke for tomorrow.  Mt. Moosilauke, a steep 3,800-foot ascent with an even steeper descent, is considered the first of New Hampshire’s big climbs and the beginning of the White Mountains. When I saw the weather forecast, the choice became even easier. It had rained all night and wouldn’t stop until noon.
I rolled over and went back to sleep. I could wait out this morning’s driving rain, hike the 11 miles to the base of Mt. Moosilauke this afternoon, and tackle the big climb early tomorrow before the next rainstorm swept through.
A Lazy Morning
I’m not much for sleeping late, but I managed to stay in bed until 7:00 am. Northstar had found us nice campground right on the Connecticut River, so I set up my laptop so I could watch the rain on the river while I wrote. Then I cleaned up the van, took Gus for a quick walk during a break in the downpour, and enjoyed a second cup of chai without the usual rush to get out the door.
Time to Hike
Northstar dropped Gus and me off in a light drizzle just after lunch. I walked a muddy trail into dripping woods under a gray, ominous sky, though the rain was so intermittent that I never bothered to put on any rain gear. The trail slowly ascended into foggy, low clouds, wrapping the trail in storybook mists – a salamander afternoon.
I’d originally planned to hike 9.5 miles to NH25C near Glencliff, but then saw that I could add another 1.5 miles and bag the 1800-mile marker today. Today’s hike only had about 2,500 feet of climbing, with no steep climbs or descents. An easy day.
FarOut promised me views from Mt. Mist, but it hadn’t seen the weather report. The dark woods and low clouds would be my only views today. So I missed misty Mt. Mist. Besides, bagging the summit required hiking a 0.7-mile blue blaze trail. Anyone who hikes an extra 1.4 miles to summit a minor peak with partial views on a foggy day has my respect. I am not that ambitious.
Roll Call
I almost missed the first two hikers I passed today. Both sat on logs 15 feet off the trail, barely visible in the fog and surrounded by dense underbrush. The first was cooking something warm on a JetBoil stove, waving a silent hello as I walked by. The second, just a hundred yards up the trail, was burning a blunt and looked away furtively without a greeting. None of us wanted to spoil the ghostly silence with idle conversation.
I walked the next few hours completely alone. Fresh tracks though the mud told me that others had walked this way today. But those folks not only didn’t have the sense to stay out of the rain, they just plodded right through the ankle-deep mud. I haven’t reached that level of oneness with the trail yet.
I Hear Voices
About a half mile before NH25C, I hiked up behind Voices. He was feeling chatty today, so we walked and talked, mostly catching up on hikers we both knew. He told me Cheater had gotten Lyme Disease, which Voices attributes to wearing shorts on the trail.
I told him I’d seen his name in the hiker’s log at the trail magic in West Hartford last week but had been surprised at a few of the hikers who’d gotten ahead of us. He scoffed at one name I mentioned and said derisively that they were “retro-blazers.” That was a new one for me.
A retro-blazer is someone who hikes the former AT alignment, rather than the current, official trail. I’d heard that called “black blazing,” because the white blazes on old alignments are sometimes painted over with black paint. I guess I’d retro-blazed off Killington last week, so I can add that to my resume of AT sins.
1800 Miles
I left Voices at NH25C, where he stopped to find a nearby hostel to get out of the rain. Gus and I crossed the highway and then crossed the unbridged, waste deep Oliverian Brook on a fallen log. I made it safely across. Gus jumped off and swam, giving himself a much-needed bath and leaving a brown plume of mud trailing downstream of his path.
After a short climb, we passed the 1800-mile marker someone had built out of birch bark. Less than 400 miles to go. Katahdin feels so close now. It feels possible.
I’m so happy. It feels good to hike again. It feels good to feel good. After so much dreary hiking, the trail is enjoyable again. Even in the rain.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668647,"Walking in the Whites
I never envisioned reaching the White Mountains.
Northstar never doubted I’d complete the entire AT, but I knew the facts. Three out of four hikers who start the AT don’t finish. Don’t get me wrong, I thought I had the legs, stamina, desire, and commitment to reach Katahdin, but most people don’t get this far.
Once I stood on the ledge at Virginia’s McAfee Knob, I knew in my heart I could do it all. But for some reason, even at my most confident moments, I never could picture myself hiking the Whites. So, for the last month, hiking these mountains has been one of my main motivational goals. The hope of someday walking above the tree line has helped kept me from quitting.
And now I’m here, standing at a trailhead in Glencliff, New Hampshire, looking up at Mount Moosilauke, the first real climb in the White Mountains.
The Moosilauke Mystique
“Wait, which one was Moosilauke?” is a question no former thru hiker will ever ask. Everyone remembers Mount Moosilauke. It’s the beginning of the White Mountains. It’s the first significant ascent in months. It’s where thru hikers, confident in their hiking legs after four to five months of climbing, stop and wonder what happened to their stamina.
The climb is “only” 3,857 feet over 5.7 miles from valley to summit, a mere 700 feet per mile (13% grade). But a one-mile segment just below the south summit exceeds 1,000 feet per mile (20% grade). For those readers who don’t hike mountains or do math, that’s notching steep.
But the ascent doesn’t earn most of the hiker chatter. It’s the descent that really gets hikers’ attention. The steepest part of the descent drops more than 1,800 feet per mile (34%). I read one hiker’s comment bragging that she’d finished the 3.5-mile descent in under four hours. For many hikers, their time is irrelevant, they just want to finish the descent uninjured.
The Ascent
Northstar dropped Gus and I at the Glencliff Trailhead around 7:00 a.m. under a blue sky, with only a few debris clouds left over from yesterday’s rain. The trail followed a paved country road for a half mile before turning into the still, dripping woods. It was another chilly, salamander morning.
Then we passed through several flowery, dewy meadows, where we scared up a pair of grouse, Gus’ first encounter with their explosion of wings and sound. He looked back to see if I was okay, but I’d seen them moving before they took off and had braced myself. Then we walked back into the trees and started to climb in earnest.
The steep trail was tough, though the wet, slippery rocks and roots we had to climb over and around were tougher. The mud and large puddles of standing water were the biggest challenge. As I struggled to keep my feet dry, the Civil Engineer in me puzzled over how the trail builders managed to pond up so much water and mud on a 13% grade. It seems like gravity should take care of that without much effort.
But other than another migraine, the ascent was fine. It was not easy, but as we climbed into the clouds now covering the summit, Gus shrugged and asked, “What’s all the fuss about that?” We’d managed an acceptable two miles per hour and hadn’t even had to break out the audiobook.
The Summit
The wind howled and wisps of mist whipped across the bare rocks as we reached the summit. We’d been buried in fog for the last 30 minutes of the climb, so we expected nothing less. I recorded a “You probably can’t hear me…” video at the rock cairn marking the peak as an homage to all the too-windy AT vlogs I’ve watched.
Even though we had no view through the clouds, it somehow felt different than getting skunked on views in Vermont. Today, at least we’d gotten above the tree line and had a chance at a view. And from the look of the sky, if we sat around for a few hours, we might see a spectacular 360-degree panorama.
But I’d heard that someone had set up trail magic at Kinsman Notch, so Gus and I decided to bet on a sure-thing hot dog rather than on anyone’s guess at a possible break in the clouds.
The Descent
The climb back down the mountain started off pleasantly enough. The trail passed through a dense stand of fragrant spruce trees that gently brushed at my elbows, happily reminding me of picking out Christmas trees as a child. I love walking through spruce forests. Maybe the climb down Moosilauke wouldn’t be so bad after all.
And then the bottom dropped out.
What part of steep descents do I like least? Miles of huge, knee-busting rock steps? Steep, rain-slick, bedrock faces? Ankle-breaking, slippery-as-whale-snot roots? Toe-width foot and hand holds? Sock soaking mud puddles? Hanging on to trees as I descend? Trusting who-knows-how-old wood block steps attached to bare rock faces? Sliding down slick rock faces on my butt? Jumping off cartilage-shattering ledges?
It didn’t matter. Moosilauke’s descent had all of that and more.
A long chunk of the trail followed a steep, cascading stream. I’m pretty sure the trail builders put the descent by the stream just to remind their victims that at least they weren’t climbing down an actual waterfall. Though, now that I think of it, much of the trail was still flowing with yesterday’s rain. The Civil Engineer in me wondered … no, my engineer packed up and went home muttering something about switchbacks, alternate alignments, and grade, leaving Gus and I to scramble down as best we could.
Spoiler alert: We survived, arriving with sore feet, aching knees, and aan thru-hiker’s appetite at the trail magic at Kinsman Notch just as the sun came out.
Reflections
I’m so glad I didn’t attempt to combine yesterday’s and today’s hikes into a single 19-mile day. Tackling the Moosilauke descent while tired and during yesterday’s drizzle could have easily led to a fall that ended my hike.
I think the trail up and over Moosilauke would be a fun day hike, but I look at the trail differently as a thru hiker. The risk of an injury was too high on the descent, making it too hard to enjoy the challenging terrain.
If today’s trail is any indication, hiking the Whites will be an adventure unlike anything I’ve done so far.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668696,"Boondocking in the White Mountains
The Kinsman Trailhead parking area has plenty of room, a clean(ish) restroom, lots of shade, and a great location. But the Granite, Glory, and Paddington, the local hikers who put on yesterday’s trail magic, told us that the White Mountain USFS Rangers aggressively enforce their no overnight parking regulations. They also said the Rangers prefer the loud midnight knock over a gentle sunset suggestion to move along.
So, we drove off the mountain and found a decent private campground on the outskirts of North Woodstock, our van looking hopelessly out of place in a row of huge, big boy RV’s and 5th wheels.
Red Sky in the Morning…
I woke to a red sky and a cool, dewy morning. The mountains had their heads in dark ominous clouds and the forecast called for mid-day rain. But it wasn’t raining yet when we drove back up to the trailhead, so we still had hope that the Whites would deliver on our high expectations.
Granite and Glory were setting up for Day 2 of their trail magic when we arrived at Kinsman Notch. They’d section hiked most of the AT through New England and live nearby, so I asked them how the rest of the White Mountains compared to yesterday’s Moosilauke hike. I’d read that the Whites were tough but had the impression that Moosilauke was one of the hardest hikes.
They said Moosilauke was pretty typical of the rest of the Whites and that its nasty descent wasn’t really an outlier. Also, they thought much of southern Maine was about the same level of difficulty as the Whites. But then they said, “We’re only section hikers, so we’ve never hiked these mountains with the kind of trail conditioning you thru hikers have.”
So That Means…What?
I guess I learned that today’s hike over the Kinsmans and the rest of the Whites would either be better, worse, or the same than Moosilauke. From the map, I knew that I had twice as many miles (16.4) as yesterday, twice as many significant climbs (2), and 1,300 more feet of total climbing. But 1,300 feet spread over twice the distance should mean that the climbs and descents would be less steep, and I had less mileage than I’d averaged for the last four months. I’d be fine, right?
There’s Only One Way to Find Out for Sure
Gus and I set out alone into a dark, mossy forest swirling with storybook mists. I expected an endurance test, but in a good way. It wasn’t hot or humid, and it wasn’t raining yet. We might catch some views from the ridges, or we might get drenched and blown off them. Either way, it’d be an adventure. I’m young, strong, and healthy. What could go wrong?
Mount Wolf
The five mile, 1,300-foot, saw-toothed ascent of Mount Wolf went slower than I’d expected, mostly due to the rocky, root- and puddle-covered trail conditions. It takes time and concentration to find safe footing on the rocks and roots, and even more time to pick my way around the long mud bogs and puddles that covered long stretches of the trail.
Mt. Wolf’s tree-covered summit offered no views, so we immediately started down the three-mile, 1,000-foot descent to the foot of the Kinsman Peaks, arriving just before 11:00. So far, I’d only managed two miles per hour, despite taking no breaks and having no significant climbs or descents. And I was unusually tired. I’d have to pick up the pace or I’d need to find a pocket of cell coverage and let Northstar know I’d be late.
We stopped for an early lunch at the Eliza Brook Shelter, one of the official camping areas in the Whites run by New England’s Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), before starting the climb up the Kinsmans. AT thru hikers have a love/hate relationship with the AMC, often referring to it as the Appalachian Money Club because they charge for camping in their shelters and tent sites and have worked with the USFS to disallow (free) stealth camping in the Whites.
Maybe it’s more like a hate/hate relationship. Both “donation” boxes at the Eliza Brook Shelter had been vandalized.
Climbing South Kinsman
The climb up South Kinsman peak was brutal. I’ve climbed longer (2.5 mi.), higher (2,000 ft.), and steeper (800 ft/mi) mountains along the AT, but I don’t think I’ve climbed anything as nasty as South Kinsman. As I climbed, I thought back to Amicolola State Park’s 600 stairs in Georgia. That was child’s play compared to this.
When I finally reached the summit, almost two hours later, my feet were hammered from the near constant rocks and roots. I don’t think I put my soles on solid dirt more than one in fifty steps. My knees and quads ached from climbing up and over miles of irregular boulders that ranged from knee to waist high. My arms and torso had been jabbed and scratched by the broken branches and sharp rocks that bordered and hung over the trail. I was soaked with sweat.
And my shoes, socks, and pants legs were soaked and slimy from stepping or falling into the hundreds of puddles and mud pits that seemed to fill every crevice and depression on the trail. How is that even possible? How can that much water accumulate on a 15% slope? In civil engineering, slope is the solution to poor drainage. How can so much mud form and collect on a steep granite mountain? Granite weathers to sand and gravel, not mud and clay.
The Summits
A thick cloud cover had blown in just before I summited South Kinsman Peak, blocking out any chance of a view between the gaps in the trees. I had no time to wait for a break in the weather, so I headed across the mile-long, spruce covered ridge toward North Kinsman Peak, where the weather broke just long enough to give me some dramatic views of sunlit clouds rushing over the forested landscape.
A Metaphorical Descent
The climb down from North Kinsman Peak was stupidly steep. In the first mile, it dropped almost 1,000 feet over slick rock outcrops, wood block steps, rain-soaked slippery wooden ladders, and waist-high boulders. Most of the trail flowed with a trickle of water, having eroded over time to become its own drainage channel. At several points, Gus balked, stopping and staring at me like I’d lost my mind, sure that he could find a better route off this mountain.
I hadn’t eaten enough and probably was a little dehydrated, so with each cartilage-busting, ankle-twisting, mud-bathed step, my mood sunk lower and lower. By the time I’d finished the worst of the descent, I’d decided that this trail was awful. Badly built, eroded, and poorly maintained. Gus was right, there had to be a better route up and down this mountain.
Stupid Stinking AMC
The signage and trail blazing were even worse. The AMC prefers using its own local trail names, even for the trails that comprise the AT. Most signs have a faded “(AT)” in parentheses next to one of the local trail names, though some don’t mention that AT at all unless a hiker has graffitied it on.
Even worse, the AMC seems to have some kind of jag about using white blazes, especially at trail junctions. At one point, I stopped at a junction, facing four possible options. The wooden AMC trail sign listed five different trail names and another four possible destinations, none of which was the “(AT).” There were no white blazes in sight.
I pulled out FarOut, but it was drizzling, and my hands were too sweaty to use my iPhone touchscreen, so I couldn’t open the app. I tried walking a hundred feet down each trail, but still couldn’t see any white blazes. No one was around to help, and I hadn’t seen anyone for hours.
Finally, in frustration (and at low blood sugar levels), I yelled out something along the lines of “Notching stupid notching AMC. Notch, notch, NOTCH!” Not one of my prouder moments, obviously. But I was tired and frustrated. Surprisingly, that didn’t help and it only made me feel stupid.
I’m From the AMC and I’m Here to Help
Just then, I heard a sweet female voice call out through the dense fir trees to my right, “Uh, do you need some help?” Apparently, I was within 50 feet of a hosted AMC campsite. They graciously pointed me in the right direction, and I hiked off, grateful for their timely help. What a lovely moment of reconciliation.
Or, in an alternate reality, I yelled back, “Buy a notching can of notching white paint and paint some notching trees!” The lovely voice went silent.
It’s hard now to remember which reality I lived in. But I clearly remember thinking that irrational anger is one of my warning signs of dehydration and hunger, so I downed some Propel and a couple of protein bars as I stomped down what seemed like the best possible trail choice, with Gus warily following along a safe distance behind me.
Sure enough, we found a white blaze 250 feet later, completely out of sight of the junction and along a section of trail where no partially sentient human would have any level of confusion about where the trail went next. Thanks, AMC. You’re super helpful.
Lonesome Lake Hut
A short time later, we hiked past the AMC’s Lonesome Lake Hut, the first of several forest lodges where paying guests get a bunk, dinner, and breakfast. It looked inviting to me, but Gus wasn’t allowed in, so we hiked on to the lake where Gus grabbed a much-needed bath and a large stick to bring along for the rest of the hike.
Unfortunately, we missed another unsigned junction by the lake and added an extra half-mile of hiking to our day. But by this time, my mood (and the trail) had leveled out and hiking was fun again, so we took the miscue in stride. Two miles later, we reached I-93 and the ¾-mile blue blaze trail to the parking area where Northstar would be waiting.
One More Miscue
Except that FarOut’s map had the meetup location in the wrong place, so Northstar was doing laps between exits on the Interstate, trying to figure out where I might be. I was sitting in the wet grass by freeway access road, glad to not be hiking, with my wet shoes off and my socks wrung out and drying in the breeze. Gus curled up on my lap and went to sleep. We both were knackered.
Sixteen miles is a long day in the Whites. Twenty-mile days aren’t a realistic option. We need a Plan B for the rest of the Whites.
Lessons Learned
Lesson #1:  Hiking the Whites is hard. Notching hard.
I’d been warned on this point but had dismissed the warning as just more AT fearmongering. My mistake. If you plan to hike the White Mountains, I’d recommend cutting your expected miles to 50 to 75 percent of your pre-Whites daily average, adding in zero or nearo days for every three to four hiking days, and leaving some schedule flexibility to account for bad weather.  Even then, plan on being more tired and footsore than usual.
Lesson #2: The AT in the Whites is not well marked. Make sure you know your route well, have route finding maps or apps, and some kind of emergency transponder like a Garmin In-Reach Mini. It’s just too easy to get off trail, lost, or hurt in the Whites.
Lesson #3: Consider a different hobby. I hear gardening is nice.
Odds and Ends
I saw Skitch from the walk into Hanover on the steep descent from Kinsman. He was beat and no happier about trail conditions than he had been in Vermont.Northstar ran into Fearless and Masters at the campground store. I may catch them tomorrow.I saw No Name, Lucky McShorts, Voices, Black Dog’s names on the trail magic register at Kinsman Notch. They’re just ahead me, but I doubt I’ll see them again.A really tiny snake, so small I initially thought it was a piece of white string (1 mm thick, 10 inches long).I finished Book 9 of Cradle series, but accidentally downloaded Book 11, and didn’t have enough cell service to get Book 10 during my hike. I really needed the distraction on the climbs.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668722,"Plan B
Walking past the Lonesome Lake Hut yesterday, nearly done in by the Kinsman descent, I noticed that all their guests seemed well rested and happy. Since I really like being well rested and happy, I decided I should do what they’re doing. So, I booked a stay at the Galehead Hut, which is conveniently located near the halfway point between the Indian Springs Trailhead and Crawford Notch, the next road crossing where I could meet Northstar.
And then, feeling good about what I’d done, I booked stays at Lake of the Clouds and Carter Gap Huts, at the halfway points of the next two roadless sections of the Whites, thus guaranteeing my well-rested happiness for the rest of the week.
It Always Starts with a Climb
Northstar dropped me off at the end of the I-93 on ramp, saving me half of the blue blaze distance back to the AT. Gus smudged up the passenger side window as I hiked off, broken hearted that AMC doesn’t allow nearly human Doodles in their huts.
As always, I started today’s hike with a big climb – nearly 4,300 feet from the valley to the Mount Lafayette summit. Along the way, I also summit Mt. Liberty, Little Haystack, and Mt. Lincoln. By the end of the day, if I survived, I’d have climbed 6,200 feet and descended 4,000 feet.
Today’s climb wasn’t that bad. It was steep and rocky, of course, but the ascent was steady enough that I could maintain a regular pace. Plus, it wasn’t as muddy, wasn’t flowing like a small stream, and the weather was much better. I can do steep. I like climbing. Especially in delightful weather.
Sometimes There’s a Payoff
But the best thing about today’s climb out of the Franconia Notch was the views. The trail popped out of the trees regularly, with jaw-dropping overlooks from rocky outcrops perched high above the valley. This is what mountain hiking is supposed to be like.
I can barely convey how restorative it was to hike a steep mountain trail that had views. I’d stop, take pictures, and then just stand and stare, completely unconcerned about making miles or anything else. The picturesque views wiped away months of the long green tunnel, weeks of bad weather, and hundreds of frustrating PUDs. The climbs were still hard, but they were worth the effort.
I felt so energized there was no question that I’d hike the extra half mile and 400 feet blue blaze trail up to the summit of Mt. Liberty. It was totally worth the effort. I had the little peak to myself. Just me, the bright sun, and the wind in my face.
And Then it Got Even Better
After Mt. Liberty, I hiked back into a lovely spruce forest for another mile before emerging above tree line on Franconia Ridge, which extends from Little Haystack Mountain to the northern shoulder of Mt. Lafayette. About half of the Ridge is above 5,000 feet in elevation, high enough to catch or form clouds on its highest slopes. But rather than block the view, these clouds merely added to the dramatic vistas.
I walked in awe, stopping and sitting to watch the clouds race across the sky and snag on the peaks, the cloud shadows track across adjacent mountain slopes, and endless blue sky. The wind let me know I was on a mountain, blowing constantly, chilling me and drying off the sweat from the climb, and then re-wetting me with its damp mists and fog.
I Recognize You
The ridges and summits were a little busy with day hikers, but it didn’t matter. Who could blame them for being here in such perfection? Why would anyone hike anywhere else in New England? At Mt. Lafayette’s peak, so many people had gathered that I was there twice.
I swept past a small crowd and did a double take. White hair, crew cut, short goatee, my height and weight, and same “don’t talk to me” vibe. He caught me staring and looked annoyed (me again), so I told him I loved the haircut. He looked a little confused until he focused on me, then laughed. When I pulled out my identical black reading glasses, he agreed to a selfie. They say if you hike far enough, you’ll eventually find yourself. It’s true.
As I walked away, I passed a young woman who stopped and asked, “Is your name Jon?” I had to think for a moment as I’m getting used to being “The Incident.” Then she said, “I follow your blog on The Trek. I’m from Brooklyn.” My first thought was “Cool!” My second was, “Brooklyn? I wasn’t too kind on New York’s AT, was I? Did she hunt me down?”
But Tek was just peak-bagging with a friend and happened to recognize me, and was willing to forgive me my unkind musing about hot, humid, buggy New York. Fortunately, she met me before encountering my doppelganger who was still resting a hundred feet away. Who knows how other-me would have reacted.
And You. And You Too
A few minutes later I saw Black Dog sitting on a rock, taking in the view, and finishing the last embers of a roll-your-own. I last saw him shooting a YouTube video along Blue Ridge Parkway. He said he’s started taking his time, confident that he’ll get to Katahdin before it closes for the winter, and unconcerned that his tramily has moved on ahead.
On the next descent, I walked up behind Fizz at the back of a long line of day hikers struggling with the steep trail, which had now become slippery and treacherous. I hadn’t seen him since the descent into the Delaware Water Gap my last day in Pennsylvania. He asked if I’d seen Fearless and Fire Hydrant.
I had passed them on the first climb up from the Indian Springs Trailhead. They’d taken a zero in North Woodstock, where Fearless had seen Northstar. Fire Hydrant had been so knocked out by the Kinsman traverse that she’d slept nearly the entire day and was struggling with the climb today.
Galehead Hut
I’d seen Galehead Hut in the distance before climbing off Franconia Ridge, but it wasn’t nearly as close as it seemed from there, and I didn’t arrive until 5:30. The last two miles took their toll, as the trail returned to Kinsman conditions – excessively steep, slippery, and muddy. Given the terrain, I was glad I didn’t have to find a flat, dry spot for a tent.
The huts are staffed by college-aged workers called “the Croo” who cook, clean, and pack in all the food and supplies on their backs in exchange for some cash and the privilege of living in the White Mountains all summer. One of them took a break from setting tables to check me in and point me at my assigned bunkroom.
The hut was completely booked, and I got the last spot, a third level wooden bunk with a thin plastic-coated mattress, two wool army blankets, and a pillow. It was glorious, aside from the thought of climbing down the eight foot ladder in the middle of the night with stiff joints and sore feet. But still better than sleeping on the rooty mountainside in the rain. And better than the fourth level bunk someone else had already taken on the other side of the room.
I had barely unpacked and hung up my sweaty clothes, changing into my rain gear, my only other option besides doing the naked hiker thing, before the dinner bell rang. Food was served family style at long picnic tables. It was tasty and plentiful, more than I could ask for after only nibbling at my cheese and protein bars all day.
Hut Life
Most of my fellow hut residents were friendly and happy to chat about hikes and weather over dinner, the kind of conversations we have with people we sit with but know we’ll never see again. My lower-level bunk buddies were a little less cordial, a married couple who huffed every time I climbed the ladder, apparently thinking their hut reservation included more private accommodations.
I looked around the room, assessing the snoring and farting potential, thankful for being next to an open window and for being partially deaf in one ear, but ruing what would rise to my near-ceiling berth with the warm air. I turned in right after dinner, hoping that sleep quantity would make up for any loss in sleep quality.
Barney’s Bedtime Stories
As the other residents filtered in, I heard one thru hiker getting grilled with the usual questions by his weekend-hiking bunk mates. They started talking about rules and laws, and the thru-hiker replied, “You know, I’m just so tired and beat, that I’ll almost be glad if I get arrested, because I’ll have a valid excuse for not finishing the AT. I feel the same way about getting injured.”
I laughed out loud and peered over the railing of my bunk to see a hiker my age who looked as tired as I felt. I could relate to the sentiment and have heard similar thoughts from both young and old thru hikers lately. Everyone is weary. Some of us are barely holding on just to finish. Not me, of course, I’m as strong as an ox and am a fountain of cheery optimism.
Soon, nearly everyone had climbed into their bunks, the headlamps stopped dancing on the walls and ceilings, and the room quieted to the soft rustling of 14 people in one room trying to fall asleep.
Bunkroom Blasts
Our room was as quiet as you’d expect. We had our share of snoring and people getting up to use the bathroom and struggling to climb the ladders or find their shoes. A little girl cried off and on in her sleep. The wind howled outside. And then, in the middle of the night, someone started talking and shouting furiously in their sleep. A typical night in a crowded bunkhouse.
The next morning, I stood on the hut’s deck looking out at the thick fog. A bleary-eyed father and son came out and watched with me. The son said, “I had the most vivid dreams last night. I may have been talking in my sleep.” I smiled and asked whether he was in the Pine Marten Room. When he said he had been, I asked if he wanted to know what he’d said.
He did. So I warned him that he’d asked and told him he’d moaned something incomprehensible at first, but then had shouted, “G..d… it! Keep your hands off my fancy a**!” Then he was out cold. His dad and I had a good laugh, and the son replied with a chuckle, “Yeah, that sounds about right,” but didn’t provide any further details about his dream. And he didn’t sit near me at breakfast.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668740,"A Foggy Morning
Thick fog blew up the mountain, burying Galehead Hut in wet clouds when I woke this morning, though the forecast called for clearing skies by mid-day. Every seat in the dining hall was taken, mostly with weekenders who were working on bagging New England’s 48 peaks over 4,000 feet.
Breakfast Stories
My table neighbors had only two more peaks to go and were debating whether to do both or just one today. They warned me that the 1,200-foot, 0.8-mile climb out of Galehead Hut would be brutal, but that the rest of my day would be downhill. They misread the look on my face, assuring me I could manage the climb. Actually, I like the climbs. It’s the steep descents that do me in, especially when the rocks are wet.
A middle-aged thru hiker next to them described how she’d sat down and cried during her hike over the Kinsmans. It had taken everything she had to get off the mountain that day, even with 1,800 AT miles and innumerable climbs behind her. She and her hiking partners had decided to shorten their mileage and stay at every hut in the Whites and get motels at every road crossing.
Even the 20-something thru hikers are feeling the pain. There’s been a line of them at every hut hoping to get one of the work-for-stay spots where they get to eat leftovers and sleep indoors in exchange for a few hours of cleaning or other chores. Fizz got in too late yesterday to qualify, so he’d moved on after refilling his water supply at the hut’s spigot.
Hiking On
I packed up and left as the Croo started a silly skit about cleaning up our rooms based on the Cinderella story. But I’d already cleaned up my bunk, and I had 14.7 miles, a steep ascent, and two nasty descents ahead of me. I wanted to get going.
A Fallen Warrior
When I picked up my pack, I noticed that the right side of the hip belt had torn away from the frame and was hanging on by just a few stitches. That would render the hip belt pretty much useless and would leave all the pack weight hanging off my shoulders. Not what I wanted for a long day and a heavier than usual pack.
Fortunately, Osprey offers a lifetime warranty on their backpacks, though I’ll need to mail it in before getting a replacement. I’ve heard they’ll make exceptions for thru hikers, but I’d still need to sit around and wait at least a few days to get a new one. Instead, I’ll just switch to my 70-liter backpack that I use when I’m not slackpacking and work on the replacement when I get home.
An Easy Hard Climb
As expected, the climb up from Galehead Hut to South Twin Mountain was hard, but short, and the fog had lifted making perfect climbing weather. Plus, I caught some nice views from the summit. After that, I saw-toothed down for five miles, touching lower summits on Mount Guyot and Zealand Mountain.
Then came the first of the day’s two big descents. The trail dropped almost 2,000 feet from Zealand Mountain to Zealand Falls, with about 1,400 feet of the descent in an ugly, one-mile segment at the end. No, I didn’t cry or notch at anyone, but my knees and feet were suffering when I sat down on the polished granitic slabs at Zealand Falls for an early lunch.
Can We Do That Again?
I don’t know how the next five miles slipped through the AMC-USFS-ATC trail design process, but it was relatively level and even had a 1.5-mile segment that was downright smooth. ADA smooth. Be still my fainting heart, an easy AT walk in the woods. Who knew such things were possible?
My feet and knees rebelled when we got to the next descent. I had to promise them a massage, ice packs, and extra-strength Advil to get them to not turn around and re-hike the smooth section again.
Home at Last
The last descent wasn’t as punishing as the first, dropping only 1,500 feet over two miles, but the trail conditions were back to the White Mountain standard – steep, rocky, muddy, and water flowing down the middle. Even so, I walked into our meetup spot exhausted.
So tired, in fact, that I refused food at the trail magic in the parking area. Instead, I walked over to the van, peeled off my shoes and socks, and lay on the bench seat while Northstar caught me up on the world and family news.
Fifteen miles is a long day in the Whites.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668780,"Boondocking in the White Mountain Boondocks
We’d been warned about trying to camp at the trailheads near Crawford Notch, so we drove north looking for a legal spot with cell coverage. We struck out. For grins, Northstar checked out the room rates of the palatial Mount Washington Hotel (a.k.a. Louis XIV’s summer home) when we drove past. With rates starting at only $450 per night (before tax and fees), we weren’t surprised they were already 100% booked. But they didn’t allow dogs, so we turned around and headed south again.
The Mount Crawford Campground looked promising, but they too were full and make it a point of pride to offer neither cell service nor Wi-Fi. After nearly an hour of hunting, we gave up, drove to North Conway, and booked a motel. I needed a shower and a washing machine anyway, and it had started to rain.
REI to the Rescue. Not.
The trail let us know we’d made the right decision when our motel turned out to be right next to an REI and a Starbucks. Northstar took the laundry and Gus. I emptied out my damaged pack and headed over to the REI to see if they could work a miracle.
REI’s service desk guy saw my thru hiker tag and tried to work out a replacement, but his manager quashed that idea. If I’d bought the pack at REI within a year, they’d exchange it with no questions. But my little lime green 38L is more than 10 years old and had been with me for thousands of trail miles before I got to Springer.
I briefly thought about just buying another pack, but since Osprey would probably send me a new one rather than a check, I didn’t want to own two small packs. I’ll make do with my Osprey Aether. Plus, I couldn’t get the attention of a sales associate in the backpack aisle, so I walked back to the van and dug my 70L behemoth out of storage.
Rain Delay
It rained through the night and hadn’t stopped when I took Gus out for his morning constitutional. A quick check of the forecast indicated continued rain all morning, possibly ending around 1:00 pm. Since I only had 11.1 miles today, I could sit out most of the weather and leave after lunch if I could sustain a 2-mph pace.
Two miles per hour seemed a little optimistic for the Whites, so we pulled up to the trailhead about 11:30 a.m., leaving me 6.5 hours (1.7 mph) to get to Lake of the Clouds Hut. I headed out into a drizzle, too light to pull out my rain gear.
A Big Climb
The climb out of Crawford Notch starts with a steep 2,700-foot, 3.5-mile ascent (800 ft/mi), then crosses a four-mile plateau, before steadily climbing another 1,600 feet over five miles to the Lake of the Clouds Hut. Despite an intermittent drizzle, steep terrain, wet rocks, and low clouds, I loved the climb up from the trailhead.
I caught a few soggy, but excellent views of the misty valley from under the low cloud ceiling every time the trail passed one of the many glacially polished cliffy granitic outcrops. Despite the rain and clouds, it was a great hike and I arrived at the plateau grinning ear to ear.
But I’d only managed a paltry 1.4 mph on the ascent, leaving me about four hours to finish the remaining nine miles. I’d need to pick up the pace to make the hut’s 6:00 p.m. dinner bell. I could save some time by cutting out photo breaks, as the clouds had rolled in, leaving me in a misty forest with about 100 feet of visibility.
Say, That’s Not a Tiny Pack. Are You Thru Hiking?
The danger of using a bigger backpack is that you tend to fill the space with gear (and weight) you don’t really need. I don’t think I brought any extras, but I certainly hadn’t bothered to compress anything I carried, so my 70-liter pack looked full.
Sure enough, about half the hikers I passed asked if I was thru hiking. I hadn’t reattached my purple thru hikers’ tag, was freshly showered, I’d shaved, and my clothes had been laundered that morning. I guess it was the pack after all, not me. Ironically, I was carrying less weight and gear than when I used my 38L pack on the hike to Galehead Hut earlier in the week when no one mistook for a thru hiker.
Trail Signage
As I picked my way though the rocks and ever-increasing puddles on the plateau section of the hike, I kept thinking I heard voices yelling somewhere just ahead me. In fact, I had. Literally.
I crested a little bedrock knob and saw Voices standing on the edge of the outcrop, talking to himself and cursing like the crazy old trapper in Jeremiah Johnson. Or like me on the descent off Kinsman Peak. He saw me behind him and let loose with a sailor-worthy stream of invective about the lack of trail signage. Specifically, the dearth of white blazes and the plethora of false trails.
Seeing his soaking wet shoes and shin-level muddy pant legs, I asked how he felt about the puddles and mud pits on the trail, but he said he’d given up being mad about that. At that particular moment, he couldn’t figure out where the trail went and had reached his limit. After agreeing to chip in and buy New Hampshire a can of white paint and a shovel, I pointed him toward the Mizpah Hut, his destination for the night.
Cutting it Close
I’d made better time along the plateau than on the initial climb, but I was still running late. Missing dinner would be bad, but I had emergency food I could use in a pinch. Plus, the hut usually keeps leftovers for stragglers.
The big problem would be getting stuck out here after dark. Trying to navigate the poorly marked trail in the rocky, treeless, fogged-in terrain could be deadly. A red-lettered warning sign appeared in front of me saying exactly that, just as the rain and wind intensified.
I’d put on my rain jacket two hours earlier, but now I zipped it up to my chin, trying to keep the sideways blowing rain from soaking my torso. The nasty weather, poor visibility, and potential for getting lost in the rocks above tree line gave the rest of the day’s hike an epic feel. I made my peace with my Maker and soldiered on.
Lake of the Clouds Hut
When I finally burst through the door of the Lake of the Clouds Hut, just minutes before the dinner bell, I felt like the moment demanded that everyone inside stop and stare in amazement, anticipating the wild tales of survival I’d no doubt be telling. But no, I was just another soggy hiker, one of many who’d walked in wet and cold that day. The ones coming in after dark would have better stories.
The hut only had 24 guests, about a quarter of its capacity, but the room I’d been assigned was nearly full, with almost every peg occupied by dripping gear and wet clothes. Two ladies who’d registered just ahead of me, took one look, and went back out to request another room. I peeked into the room across the hall and discovered it was empty, so I went and asked if I could move too. Just like that, I had a private room, at least for an hour or two.
My roommates rolled in about 8:00, well after dinner had been cleaned up, though the kitchen managed to feed them something. One of them had been blown over by the wind on a peak, hurting her head and bruising her arms. She was clearly shaken and had decided they’d hike off the mountain tomorrow morning, abandoning their longer planned hike.
A Thru Hiker Talk
Four lucky 20-something thru hikers gave a presentation about the AT after dinner as their work for stay assignment. Their presentation consisted of introducing themselves and asking if we had any questions.
We did. Lots of them. At least an hour’s worth. As they started to wind down and began looking longingly at the dinner leftovers, I asked which was their least favorite state. Without a moment’s hesitation, they all said, “Vermont. The mud and weather were atrocious.”
That led to another series of questions about the difficulties of hiking the AT. Someone asked if they ever thought about quitting. At first, all of them choked on the answer, looking awkwardly at each other, and not responding. Then, one of them said, “No. Never. I’m committed to finishing. It’s been great.” But it sounded flat and rehearsed, and she looked down and to the left as she said it.
The next two hikers repeated the same mantra with about the same (lack of) intensity. Finally, the last guy said, “Yes. I’m homesick all the time. I had to get off the trail for three weeks in Maryland after injuring my foot, and it was really hard to come back. But I’m glad I did.”
I believed that guy. Everybody has at least one day where they think about quitting. And about 75 percent of those who start a thru hike do more than think about quitting. Most wannabe thru hikers quit.
Hiker Chatter
Talk in the hut centered around the difficulty of hiking the Whites. Everyone warned me that southern Maine was just as hard, if not harder, than the Whites. They also said my 14.9-mile hike tomorrow would be a beast, especially if the weather didn’t break.
So, I went to bed early, pulled out my FarOut app, and started re-thinking my itinerary for southern Maine.

The Incident,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668819,"Hut Life
Despite the talking, snoring, rustling, electronic beeping, and other nighttime noises, no one in the hut would have preferred their tent on a night like last night. The wind howled and rain splattered against the windows all night. I pitied anyone trying to survive, let alone sleep, on Mount Washington.
The Croo comes around and yells everyone awake at 6:30 a.m., giving us all ample time to get dressed before the 7:00 breakfast bell. Even so, one guy in the room set his alarm for 6:00, let it buzz for nearly a minute, then turned it off and went back to sleep. After that, everyone else in the room either got up or lay in bed waiting for the Croo to call.
The breakfast cook was off his game this morning, feeding us cold sticky oatmeal and burned sausage, though he did okay with the scrambled eggs. Still, there was plenty of it and being served beat the heck out of carrying and making it myself. I gulped mine down and headed out the door before the Croo started in on the same silly breakfast skit I’d seen before.
Show Time
I’d planned 14.9 miles from the Hut to Pinkham Notch, but everyone I talked to at dinner thought I was insane. Maybe, but I had no other viable options. At least it was mostly downhill.
I walked out into a crisp 34F, ripping winds, and blowing mists, though the air was drier than when I’d arrived last night. My clothes hadn’t dried overnight, but the wind took care of it on the 1,300-foot, 1.5-mile climb to the Mount Washington summit, teaching me the true meaning of wind chill factor. I’d pulled on my fleece beneath my zipped and hooded rain jacket, but my hands, face, and legs suffered until I’d climbed enough to get the furnace going.
After I’d climbed a quarter mile, the clouds began to break up, showing patches of blue sky above, though thick fog continued to sweep over the mountain slopes and catch on the peaks.
Mount Washington
Mount Washington is the second highest point on the entire AT and the highest point in New England. Benton MacKaye’s original plan identified the peak as the AT’s northern terminus, but Myron Avery insisted it end in his home state of Maine. Since Avery was the get-it-done guy, and MacKaye was the visionary, Maine’s Mount Katahdin became the northern end point.
There are three ways up and four ways down Mount Washington. You can hike, drive, or take the cog railway up the mountain. If you’re going down, can also just stand tall and wait to get blown off the peak. That worked for my pack cover. One of the 80-90 mph gusts ripped it off my pack and sent it sailing off into the valley below. I knew when I put it on that morning, I should have used a tether.
I could barely stand up in those gusts, but they were nothing compared to the 220 mph winds recorded previously on at the NOAA weather station on the summit. Today’s winds and the 31F air temperature kept everyone else off the summit when I arrived. I had the entire mountain top to myself. Nothing was open and nobody else was around.
I took a lonely selfie at the summit sign and left, staggering in the wind like a drunken sailor.
Ridge Walking
The bright blue sky, dramatic clouds, and bare rocky terrain made for stunning views and pictures, but the walking was hard work. The rocky trail pounded my feet and challenged my balance, particularly when the irregular gusts swept across the ridge.
I crossed the Cog Railway tracks and spotted the train slowly climbing up the west face toward the summit. Traditionally, thru hikers moon the train, but I had no intention of waiting around for it to crawl up the tracks to me, nor was I going to expose any skin to the wind and cold.
I’d intended to take the blue blaze trails to the summits of Mt. Clay and Mt. Jefferson, but both had their heads buried in thick clouds when I passed the trail junctions. Plus, with the wind and my long day, I didn’t need an extra work beside navigating the rocky, poorly marked trail. I can’t imagine hiking this terrain in a winter storm.
Mount Madison
I reached the Mt. Madison hut about 11:30 a.m., only six miles done in four hours, and already worn out, so I stopped to eat lunch out of the wind. Other guests at the Lake of the Clouds hut had warned me that the hike to Madison Hut was challenging. And I still had nine miles to go. Everyone resting in the Madison Hut looked a little shell-shocked.
The ascent from the hut to Mt. Madison’s summit was truly evil. Steeper than steep, bouldery, poorly marked, and totally exposed to the wind. But the view from the top was worth the effort, even though I had to take shelter behind a rock outcrop to be stable enough to appreciate it.
A lady stumbled past yelling to me from six feet away, “Is this the trail?” I responded, but she never heard me, as my words landed in Gorham, blown off the mountain by the wind.
The climb down was as nasty as the climb up, and for all the same reasons. Dozens of false trails splintered off the main trail, ending at unclimbable rock faces, turning in the wrong direction, or just finding their own way down the scree slope of angular boulders. Eventually, I reached the tree line, happy for the first time in weeks to be back in the long green tunnel.
Back in the Woods
I took a break behind a cluster of trees, happy to have my feet back on soil and the rest of me out of the wind. As I sat there, I realized that New Hampshire is just as rocky as Pennsylvania and nearly as muddy as Vermont. But the views are much, much better. And I’ve had better weather.
Back in the woods meant not yet out of the woods. I still had seven more miles to Pinkham Notch and about 3,500 feet of descent left to go. And my feet, Achilles, and knees were beat. I’d banged every toe at least once, hyperextended by knee at least five times, and had pinched my feet between boulders a dozen times. Everything ached and the furnace was empty. I pulled out my Vitamin I (Ibuprofen/Advil) for the first time since the Smokies.
Done
After a long break, I took a deep breath, climbed back to my feet, shouldered my pack, and headed down the trail. Normally, this would be the perfect time to pull out my audiobook, but I’d accidentally downloaded Book 11 instead of 10, so I had nothing to listen to except the one Switchfoot album I have on my phone. It would be a long hike down.
Why was this so slow and painful? The miles are less than what I’m used to. The elevation change is high, but nothing I haven’t seen before. I’ve done rocky, muddy, cold, and windy.
It must be the combination of all of that, plus the poor signage. I find myself stopping multiple times every mile choosing between unmarked splits, searching for white blazes or cairns, or pulling out the FarOut app to figure out which way to go. Picking my way through the endless puddles and mud pits takes time too, as does pulling out my trekking poles when they get stuck in mud or between roots and rocks.
I pondered all this as I plodded along. Climbing over a downed tree, I slipped and fell face first into a mud pit. Flat out. Legs, torso, arms, and face in the mud. I was too tired to notch. I just rolled over and laughed.
Plan C
As I walked the last mile into Pinkham Notch, I didn’t know if I’d be able to hike tomorrow. I’d only scheduled 5.9 miles to the Carter Gap Hut, but it included some very steep climbs, and I had another 15.2-mile day after that. Then I planned two short days with the kids. I need to rethink all that.
But first I had to get off this mountain. Things will look better after a rest, a hot meal, and a night’s sleep.
