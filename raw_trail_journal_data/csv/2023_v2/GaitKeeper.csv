It’s that time of the year again. I plan to start my 10th SOBO section hike where I left off last fall at Daleville, VA in a couple of days.
More to come…
Until next time,

Today was a really long day for me. I left my PA home this morning at 3:00 AM and drove to Pearisburg, VA and dropped off a re-supply box at the Angel’s Rest Hiker Hostel and then drove back north to Daleville to begin my hike. Total of 6 hours of driving. I managed to get on the trail at 9:30 so the early rise was well worth it. I was still able to get 15 miles in for the day. I should sleep good tonight. 


Today’s hike was challenging but so worth it and the weather was perfect. The view from Tinker Cliffs is amazing. I cannot wait to check out the view from McAfee’s Knob tomorrow morning. 



There are quite a few hikers on the trail and the Campbell Shelter is really busy but I did find a pretty good spot to pitch my tent.Many thanks to my beautiful wife for letting me get out here and do my thing, again.

Campbell Shelter to Pickle Branch Shelter 


I hit the trail at 6:00 AM this morning with the intention of climbing the 529 feet in 0.7 miles to catch the sunrise on McAfee’s Knob. I’m happy to say that the plan worked out perfectly and it did not disappoint. It was one of the most beautiful things that I have ever seen. 


My excitement about seeing the sunrise had me flying high for the next few hours but as the miles piled on and the temperature rose I found myself starting to run out of energy. The 1,200’ rock scramble up to Dragons Tooth seemed to take me forever and the final 4 miles to the shelter was mostly on a rocky ridge that significantly slowed down my pace. That’s all OK because I still made it to the shelter by 3:30 and even had enough time to give myself a birdie bath in the stream below the shelter. Felt oh so good. 


I have now seen all three of the Virginia Triple Crown attractions (Tinker Cliffs, McAfee’s Knob and Dragons Tooth) on this trip.

Campsite to Big Stony Creek Road, VA 635


I was faced with two pretty big climbs today. The first was 1,800’ and the second was 2,000’. The first went reasonably well but the second was later in the day and my legs were really feeling it. I did not plan to do big miles today but I arrived at the campsite that I planned to say at (12.3 miles) and it was only 11:00. Yep, I started the day with my trusty headlamp leading the way. So I figured that I would just go to the next shelter which was only a few more miles. I arrived there assuming that there would be water but I assumed wrong. And I only had a few ounces of water left. So I cranked up my trusty trail app (FarOut) and saw that there was a nice mountain creek along with a few campsites 1.5 miles and 1,100’ below me at Big Stony Creek Road. So I figured that I did not have a choice so I tacked on the additional 1.5 miles. My milder day turned into my longest yet but it was so worth it because I’ve got a great campsite along Big Stony Creek. That’s my camp for the night in the picture I attached. 



The highlight of the day was Wind Rock with its unobstructed beautiful westerly view from 4,100’. I would guess that I saw about 12 other hikers today, all headed in the northerly direction. Some were northbound thru-hikers and some were section hikers like me. There was also a day hiker or two.
I only have 22 miles left to get to Pearisburg, VA but I plan to split that up into 2 days. I only brought food for 5 days so I will have to ration a bit to have some food left for the additional 6th day.

Big Stony Creek Road to Pearis Cemetery Parking Area 


Today was a mild elevation day with only one significant climb of 1,500’ and it had plenty of switchbacks so minimal effort was required. Although the miles clicked off rather quickly once I was up on the ridge the cold, wind driven rain took a bit of the enjoyment out of it. Originally I had planned to camp up on that ridge to avoid having to do the full 22 miles to Pearisburg but I’m pretty sure that it would have been miserable night. I stopped at the Rice Field Shelter, still at 3,354’ elevation, just long enough to satisfy my belly and I immediately started getting cold by not moving. The wind was driving the rain into the shelter. The included photo is from that moment. As I descended down the mountain to Pearisburg the wind and fog elements of the weather improved but the rain continued. 


Once I reached the Pearis Cemetery Parking Area I walked into town and stopped at the first restaurant that I came to which happened to be Hardee’s. To my surprise there were two NOBO thru-hikers there that I had met and spoke with for a while in the mountain yesterday. We chatted for a bit and I gave them my contact information in case they could use some assistance once they reach my area in Pennsylvania. I texted Angel’s Rest Hiker Hostel for a ride to their place and they promptly picked me up. 
I have a shuttle to Daleville scheduled, thank you Angel’s Rest, for later this afternoon so that I can grab my car and hit the road to PA. 



The highlight of my day today was meeting a NOBO YouTuber “Chasing Blazes” whose videos I have been viewing, along with others, since she started the trail about two months ago. We didn’t chat long because it was miserable standing still in that weather.
Today my Section Hike 10 comes to a conclusion. I will be looking forward to Section Hike 11 this fall when I will be picking up at the area where I left on Section Hike 10.
