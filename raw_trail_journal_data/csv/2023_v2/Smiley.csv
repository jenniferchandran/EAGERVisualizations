Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660126,"End of the line for year 3!
I have now completed 514.9 miles on the Appalachian Trail since I started in the fall of 2020. Each year has been interesting, to say the least. The first year everything was so new and the adventure was just that, an adventure in learning the reality of trail life...Scared, uncertain, uncomfortable, but incredibly freeing, and with each day, each mile I learned a lot about myself and what I was capable of enduring. 
The second year was simply just amazing especially in the spring when I hiked from the southern terminus, approach trail included, with my wife, to the NOC in Bryson City, NC.  I followed that hike up in the fall with the ambition to close out the Northern section of VA which ended up short and with two broken toes. Defeated I felt, I left the trail with thoughts as to if I would ever return to the trail again. I really missed hiking with someone whom I knew, who I could share in the journey with. Yes, I love being alone on the trail at times but it sure is a lot of fun to have someone around during the times when the trail sucks. Of course, also when it was amazing. Yes, folks, hiking the AT is hard, and at times it just downright sucks.
This year, I vowed not to ever hike alone, or to hike in high heat, and after 3 section hikes by myself, I failed to listen to what I vowed to myself.  In all transparency, I haven't really enjoyed myself to the fullest during my hiking this year. Yes, there were good moments but, in the end, even though there were plenty of hikers out on the trail, I never connected with anyone. I guess that's hard to do when my sections this year were only for a few days, and one was SOBO not by choice. My three-section hikes this year were more about just counting off the miles to the final prize.  So much that I didn't even realize that I actually broke, no pun intended, 500 miles this year, I guess that was on my last day into Waynesboro, how fitting...
When I finally finished Glasgow, VA to Waynesboro, VA at Rockfish Gap, it was all I could do to get the hell out of town as fast as possible. I swore that I would never come back to this area of VA again, ever. I also left the trail with the thought of never returning to AT ever again. A feeling that still lingers in the back of my mind today. Yet, there is still a strong desire, a flicker of flame, to finish what I've started three years ago. As I drove home back to Asheville, NC I passed numerous towns that I've hiked through, and the memories are still so vivid that I can just about recall every step that I took. I also drove past towns in southern, VA like, Roanoke, Damascus, and Erwin places that I've read about, which got my heart pumping again and my mind wondering what adventures could ensue. 
Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the loneliness, maybe it was just not the right time for this journey for me. The one thing that did stand out is that perseverance is also something that I should be proud of. I finished a trail gap that had been just eating at me. I need to take some time off from the AT, how long, it's undetermined right now. I had planned to get back on the trail in October for three weeks, my longest section hike ever, but I've since shelved that for now. I guess right now I just don't know when I'll return, and I really don't need to have that answer either. I have so many mixed emotions to sort out over the summer. Or maybe it's just best to put those emotions on a shelf for now and just live for today. 
Have a great summer and for those out there on the trail fulfilling your dreams, Happy Hiking!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sun",0
Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660127,"Plans are now surfacing for what I hope to be my biggest year in miles yet so far. Stay tune, the details are coming shortly, and I'll elaborate in more in my next post. Until then, good luck to the Thru-hiking class of 2023 as I see many of you are poised to hit the trail soon.",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Thu",0
Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660198,"If you've been following my journey, the short story is this, born and raised in southeastern Michigan and I had lived there for most of my life. Lived in Central Indiana for 9ish years, until I retired, aka the adult gap year. Moved to Asheville, NC and bought a business until it's time to really retire. The MST (Mountain to Sea Trail) and Pisgah National Forest, along with many other public lands are a stone throws away from where Snacks and I live. 
The weather has been pretty mild this year in the south which gets me thinking about possibly hitting the trail a little sooner for a warm up before a longer hike in April. Details on that longer hike will come soon as plans are starting to shape up. If the weather and my schedule permits, I'd like to close the 70ish mile gap in the Smoky Mountains from Fontana to Standing Bear Hostel in March. I might do this in 2 sections with Newfound Gap being the central point as it's about an hour and 45 minutes away from my house.
Until then, some training has started. I'll be getting out my hiking gear this week to tune things up and to see what I need. I do know that I need to replace my water filter cartridge, and I'm thinking about changing from hiking shoes to trail runners. Let the research begin on that...",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Sun",0
Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660230,"It's been far too long since I've spent any considerable time living in the woods, and my mental health has suffered from it. Too many distractions last year, too many excuses, too many missed opportunities. This year, I vowed to not let this happen again. Because honestly, if you wait for the perfect opportunity to run off into the woods, chances are life is going to happen. So, it's about making the choice to just go and figure it out when you return.
Over the fall/winter I shifted from what I call functional hiker training to traditional strength training. I spent more time lifting heavy weights to build strength and muscle mass and I never felt stronger in my life. However, muscle mass on the trail isn't very functional, sure it makes the backpack feel lighter, but functionally it's not very helpful for hiking up and down mountains. So, I've recently shifted back to functional hiker training. What is that you ask, or not, LOL.
Basically, my workout is more cross training like. This is a full body program using lighter weights with timed sets and multiple repetitions, mixed with platform step ups while holding light weights, and abdominal exercises with very little rest breaks in between sets to build up cardio. I've also started to walk more, and I will start to work in some walk runs to increase my cardio capacity and endurance.  Fitness on the trail has never been an issue for me and 12-20 miles a day right out of the car has come pretty easy, so I don't intend to let poor physical conditioning stop me, ever! 
I guess it's time to get out the backpack and take inventory...I've already ordered the replacement filter for my water filtration system, the Katadyn Hiker Pro since it takes a while to get it. The Katadyn Hiker Pro is worth the extra ounces for me to carry because it is fast, reliable, has awesome filtration, and is easy to use. While you all are squeezing for life, I've filled up two 2-liter bottles, drank one, and filled it up again...lol.  
Keeping my fingers crossed because if the weather stays mild who knows what could happen.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Thu",0
Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660463,"Well, it's been over a week now and 3 to 5 more weeks to go is what the doctor told me. If I had not injured my wrist at the gym, I would have been getting off the AT today for what would have been half of the GSMNP.  Then this weekend I would have completed the rest of the GSMNP completing the section from Springer to Hot Springs. Now it looks like that's going to have to wait until late spring after April's section hike from Hot Springs to Erwin/Roan with ""Snacks"". I was so ready to get back to walking on top of mountains...but if anything, good came out of it, I did dodge some harsh weather. 
It's time to shake off the disappointment and focus on some big miles in the future. At least I can still walk so after a week's rest to just let my body focus on healing, it's time to get the legs back moving again. I'm taking a couple of days to escape city life/work in the van to just breath and do some lite hiking to get things started again. So much for getting into top physical condition before hitting the trail. Staying trail ready for a LASH (Long Ass Section Hiker) is always a challenge. Well at least I didn't break any toes, again...LOL!",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661793,"As the picture shows, it's almost go time again. In the next 5 days my boots will hit the AT NOBO again for the 4th consecutive year. However, getting to this day has been difficult, frustrating, depressing, and I'm still not 100%. 8 weeks ago, I suffered from a serious tendon injury to my wrist. The pain was so excruciating for 3 days that I had a hard time sleeping. After going to the doctor, the injury had me in brace that prevented any thumb or wrist twisting movement. Needless to say, it was difficult to do anything with my left arm. I also through my back out a week ago, as I was prepping my food and resupply box today, I tweaked my back again...Err, I hate that I'm sounding like the old guy that I've become in body, but not in mind.
So, Routine? One thing I've perfected over the last four years of section hiking, is gear packing and meal planning. Shake down hikes prior to my thru-hike attempt in 2020 helped but the trail will really show you the ways. I've learned to not pack my fears, I've learned for me that less is more, and that sticking to eating the same things on the trail just makes life easier. I can still recall the first in town resupply I did after walking out of the woods and into a grocery store, it wasn't pretty. I was so overwhelmed with all of the delicious food options, and I was starving. I ended up grabbing an orange, sitting on the curb outside to wait out my panic attack before going back in. 
Since that day, I've really perfected packing, resupplies, and while ""yes"", it's that same old, same old, it just works. I know what exactly what to buy, what to pack, what to eat and when, and it just works for me...stress free. When you're banging out miles, it's really just calories and not food when you're out there. Nero's and Zero's in town is when food becomes the luxury meal and with much, much delicious gratitude. 
So, here is the general hike plan in a nutshell: (It's always fluid.)
1. Hot Springs to Erwin, TN with Snacks and Birdy & Scout (Dog). 7 days - 96.3 Miles 
2. Then a Nero/Zero in Erwin, TN to as far as I can go before Snacks can pick me up. The target: Hampton, TN or Shady, Valley TN. 9 days - 111.5 Miles.
Next post will be from the trail...Happy Easter!",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Sun",0
Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662137,"Well if you're wondering about day, It was a zero day...lol. On our way to drop off a vehicle in Erwin, TN were Snacks and Birdy are getting off trail the truck broke down. So we got a tow into the shop and headed home after a few stops and a quick hike to Craggy Gardens then a few breweries and back home to Asheville to regroup.
SO...Official day 1 was today. Hot Springs to Spring Mountain Shelter. The bubble is huge so we've already met a ton of through hikers. TRAIL MAGIC GALORE alresdy so why did I bring 6 lbs of food? As we were about 6 miles out of Hot Springs some SOBO day hikers reported that there was trail magic. So lunch was served by two trail angels, yum. 
The second half of the hike had some big elevation gains so it was slow going. Although Birdys dog Scout did seen to mind. If only I had four legs...lol. When got into camp the normal routine, put up tent, get water, and bam. Here comes trail magic right down the trail to the shelter. Fresh fruit, root beer floates, yep hiked in with dry ice, and  there was wine.
What and amazing start. Rain and storms tomorrow so hoping the forecast is wrong. Good night!","Hot Springs, NC

Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662183,"The rain came in around 4 am the good thing was that it was just rain. The bad thing meant pacing up in the rain so we could make it to our next destination before the afternoon storms came. Of course a few minutes after we packed up the rain stopped. Thank you mother AT for your humerus weather joke. 
Shorter mileage day today because of some bigger climbs in store as we head up to over 5000ft tomorrow. The weather did cooperate for the most part. The highlight of the day was we stop at a cabin just off the trail where cookie lady leaves fresh baked chocolate chip cookies on her porch for hikers, yum. Then it was a final push straight up to camp and just in time. We got set up right before a heavy rain hit, so dry we stayed. 
Chilling in my tent to stay warm waiting for the shower to pass. Then it's dinner time and more conversations with the other hikers. Early rise tomorrow with a final push up to 5000 ft before we walk the ridgeline for a few days. Weather looks better so we're hoping to get some great views.

Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662295,"Last night was in the top 3 for being the coldest I've experienced on the AT. After the rains the temperature dropped hard and the winds were relentless. For the second time I had to put on everything I had just to not shiver it was a hard night. 
When morning came it was still freezing but we had miles to make. The Temps eventually climb in to the 50's, the sun was out, but the winds where still there. Regardless today's views were in the top 5 as we walked and exposed ridge above 5000ft with views on both sides as far as the eyes could see.
Note - Made good time to our lunch spot double timing to stay warm. Actually took a nap in the sun after eating, a trail first for me.
Stealth camping tonight at the grave of the Shelton Family - The story is called the Shelton Laurel Massacre,  amazing storey...Another first camping in a grave yard. Dinner complete, bear bags hug, and once again putting everything I own on as the Temps will drop into the 30's again. Hopefully, I stay warmer as I rethink how I layered differently from last night. I got this...just wish the wind would die down. 
Warm for now...Good night.","Little Laurel Shelter

Like the trail, life is also fluid. A situation back in the working world had me in a situation where I had to get of the trail today. This was known a few days ago which bummed me out for a minute but I shook it off to enjoy the present. 
Last night's cold waswasn't as bad as anticipated, sure it was cold but the winds died down and no rain. With just a short 6 miles to a hostel that was right off the AT meant for a short day before we could get a ride to town. While we waited for our ride it was cheap frozen pizza and cheap beer for lunch. 
We also met a few other hikers one of them being the legendary Trail Marshall.  After a few hours of waiting for our ride from the second ledgen of the the Miss Janet it was back in car home word bound.

No, I haven't fully taken care of the business matter that pushed me off the trail but at least I could keep these hiker legs fresh and continue a bit further up the trail for a few more days. I got home from work, confirmed with Snacks my plan, repacked my bag, and then I sat down to check the weather. The look on my face said it all...You've got to be kidding me, how can it get even colder, 45 mph winds, and thunderstorms? WTF...
Well, we'll see what the next couple of weeks have in store...That is if I can resolve the issue that made me have to leave the trail and if the weather lightens up. If that falls through the next window of opportunity won't be until mid May...
Currently sitting at 551.7 AT miles...when I should have been well over 650 this month. 2023 is not starting out as planned...

Smiley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663144,"I've been dreaming of the trail since I had to get off unexpectedly last month due to some issues at work. However, If the stars align tomorrow afternoon, I'll tap back in at mile 311.5 Rector Laurel Rd. and at least hike to Erwin, TN a mere 32.7 miles away.  So, 3 days at minimum since I'll have a late start tomorrow. However, I've been known to do 35 miles in two days so we'll see where my rested legs will take me. 
There is still some unfinished business at work, so I have to be at the ready to get pulled off trail again if an emergency comes up. So, it makes it hard to plan for a further car drop and more days. I'll also be going alone again, so no Birdy, Snacks, and Scout the dog, aka...trail name Tail Gate, well that's just one of his trail names...LOL.
So, if I get to Erwin early and it makes sense maybe I'll push a little further or not, because it sure would be a nice section to do from Erwin to Damascus. You know what they say just put one foot in front of the other and we'll see where we end up.  The itch to crack the 600-mile mark is very tempting...

We'll at least to a extraction point that makes sense for a future section hike.  Made 6 miles faster than I anticipated to my camp spot even though it was up the mountain all the way here(Started @ 1:30pm). I decided to stay ,after contemplating for 30 mins, but since there wasn't many good water or camping spots listed why push myself on day one without a guarantee. I'll just get up early and push for a big day tomorrow and looks like the weather will be great for it.
Looks like the bubble has broken up a bit. Only a few hikers at the shelter although it's relatively early but not, almost 6pm. Tonight's dinner an Italian sub sandwich and a bag if chips that I packed in...YUM, no cooking tonight...lol. 
Missing Snacks, she's always fun to hike with...Thanks for the lift!
