Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/655270,"I have 700 miles of experience on the AT from my 2008 attempt. This causes me to analyze certain aspects of my hike to increase my possibility of sucess.I've been laboring over what to wear on my feet. It is a personal choice. As everyone's feet are different and a million recommendations can be found. Merrell Moan 1 was my go to until I hit Daleville where I replaced them with Montrails. I was having shin splint issues and thought that switching up my boot typs would make a diference. But I was too far into my injury and ended up stopping in the Shendoahs. When in New Mexico, I wore Vasque boots, which I don't have any complaints about. However the pair I have doesn't seem wide enough.So I ventured into the Hoka OneOne's and just found them not to be sturdy enough. I remember when the box was received I literally thought the box was empty.So I find myself going back to the Merrells. I like the padding on my instep. I like the feel of the Vibram sole beneath my foot. However, I am trying the Moab 2 which is the higher model. Hoping this will allow for extra support and assist in healthy ankles and calves.Let's get stepping.",,View Entry,"Jul 25, Mon",0
Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658622,"Less than 6 months to prepare. I'll be dialing in my equipment soon. Life has kept me from focusing on the most important training. That of my physical self and mental self.Life is a series of intentions. I envision my journey as a series of intentions that I will out into the universe as I watch each come to a conclusion; some as imagined and some a complete surprise.Folks will as why? I already started in 2008 and didn't finish; for the longest time looking at that as failure. A failure because as far as I was concerned, my only option was to finish in Maine. And that was just not to be.Retirement is on 3/1/2023. AT start date is 41/2023. I intend to work on meditation, physical conditioning and dialing in my equipment. Oh. Don't forget trying to absorb the technical side of my journey. Trail Journal entries will be easy as I can do that myself. Camera will be my cell. But learning Farout. And how to use my Inreach. And should  I post on FB? Instagram? Fifteen years have gone by since my first experience with the AT. It will be so much easier to "" keep in touch"". Life is Good.",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Sun",0
Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658938,"I have been reviewing my past hiking experiences. I've always been head strong and end up pushing myself, resulting in injuries. Mostly shin injuries.So I'm slowing down. I've arranged a schedule that will allow me to take my time and not push too hard. Although I'm sure the schedule will change after day one.But in training I have tried slowing down and I'm amazed at how different it feels.",,View Entry,"Oct 22, Sat",0

Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659561,"Just finished the book ""2000 miles together"". I will write this down and read it to myself when going through tough times. As I have tasted the AT, I know this to be true.""The trail will only provide if you accept its offer. All of it. You must leave home. You must be broken. It will cost you your entire life as you know it. And then, and only then, can you receive. What you receive will be far greater than anything you had or anything you lost. It will change you.

Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659730,"It's finally 2023.  I feel like my journey is finally coming to fruition.  In fact, there are times I ask time to slow just a tad so I can catch up.I've been occupying myself by reading journals, books and watching YouTube videos.  I hope to have my YouTube channel up and running soon.  I still struggle with the technology side of things.Air fare is purchased.  I'll be flying to Roanoke, VA.  Then taking the bus to Blacksburg for $4.  Once there, Angels Rest Hostel will be picking me up for my two nights stay at the hostel.  The first day will be recouping from my travels.  Day two will be spent working on my headspace and purchasing the supplies that I am not able to bring on the plane.I will be bringing an InReach mini, which is a personal satellite. This will allow those closest to me to be able to call me up on a website and be ensured that I am moving forward, hopefully in a northward direction.I am starting in Pearisburg, VA which is where my attempt in 2008 started slipping away from me.  I will be a different person.  I will have some different equipment.  I know what it's like to live in the forest for 10 weeks.  This time I will return a stronger person, both mentally and physically.I will also be traveling with a ""one day at a time"" attitude.  I remember the despair I felt when I didn't make it to Katahdyn in 2008.  I am going, knowing that I can take my time and will be doing the best that I am able.  It will also be easier to keep in contact with family and friends.  I will accept all the encouragement that anyone wants to send my way.Back to planning.  See you up the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Wed",0
Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660232,"Can you tell what I've been up to? I have two more days of work and I'll be retired. That was the first major milestone of my hike. Look at that. Success! And I haven't even started.Equipment has been selected. Most of it is stuff I used in 2008. I finally decided to go with a 20 degree down quilt. Up until a week ago I was going to take my Kelty 20 degree bag. I can't justify the extra bulk from the bag. So that problem is resolved.I'll be using my Go Lite Quest backpack that I used in '08. It was considered ultralight back in those days.And probably the heaviest piece of equipment is my tent- a North Face Stormbreak 1. My Hubba from '08 is a mess. I want to see if the poles from the Hubba will work on the stormbreak. I might be able to save some weight that way.The last new iece of equipment was a bear canister. I'm really bad at throwing the rope up in the tree. It's usually a calamity. Once I was with my grandson who threw the rock so well it went over the limb and the rock came back and hit him in the face. In '08 someone was helping me throw the rope and forgot to hang onto the other side of the rope. Thus leaving my entire rope in the tree beyond my reach. So I'll simply walk my bear canister into the woods and hope it's still there in the morning. Just to be safe, I'll put an air tag in the canister so I can locate my goodies.So there. That is what I've been up to. Now it's just a month of fine tuning of my equipment, my physical strength and mental preparedness. The mental part is the most important. My equipment won't get me to Katadyn. But my mind will.Time to get after it.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Thu",0
Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661173,Let the over thinking begin. T minus seven days. And even less than that until my departure.Did I pack too much? Will I be hungry?Will I be successful managing my blood sugar?Do I have enough strength? And wisdom?What do I leave behind without compromising my well being?I also have been appreciating the luxuries I enjoy. A soft bed. A hot shower along with all the products I use. Nourishing food. But most of all the people that I will miss while on trail. The advances in communication and the ability to stay connected since 2008 are amazing. Mount Katadyn has been a goal of mine for at least 40 years. I'm one third of the way. It's time to head north.Pre-hike jitters are normal. It's part of the journey. The trail will provide.Let's get after it.,,View Entry,"Mar 24, Fri",0
Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661470,"I am truly the April Fool. I was to start my hike today. Alas, the forecast includes high winds with gusts to 65 mph up in the mountains after a day of rain yesterday. The first part of the hike is on an exposed ridge. I prefer not to be blown off my first mountain ridge.Starting tomorrow will set me up for 3 days of fair weather. I will experience a lot of rain in these first weeks. And spring will bring some intense storms. I can only hope that I make good choices based on the information  at hand to avoid an emergency.I am using the app ATweather.org which is a wonderful resource that forecasts the weather in the location of each shelter.  As I hike the AT I will be hiking down into towns where the weather is more favorable and then up, up, up, back into the mountains. At some point I may be able to experience spring in town and winter in the mountains.It's an adventure. One day at a time.Lie is incredibly Good.","Angel's Rest Hostel

Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662008,"Where do I begin with this day. I didn't sleep well as the two sectionals took turns snoring. I think too that my mind couldn't stop thinking of the struggle of the day.
Got on trail from the shelter at 9a. For some reason I thought that I would be able to hike 12 miles right from the start. I was still exhausted from the previous day and the struggle with the ups was extremely slow at like .7 mph. But when the trail leveled out, I felt I was right where I was suppose to be.
I met Shades going south where I was looking for a place to set up camp after 8+ miles. Too bad I wasn't just a little slower cuz I would have loved to set up camp with her.
There has been talk about aggresive goats on the trail. Midway thru the day, I came upon them as they were playing/fighting off to the right. I ignored them and kept on walking and smuggly thought that I got away without an encounter.
I set up my tent, hung my food which was a joke. I cannot throw a rock so that it goes where intended. I'll get plenty of practice. I gathered my belongings and placed them either in the tent or under the vestibule. I didn't eat cuz everything I tried, I immediately spit out. So I went to bed with the sun still out.
And then the profile of an animal standing right next to my tent appeared. I at first thought it was someone's dog. But soon figured out it was the goats. I punched the side of the tent. I yelled at them to go home. I whistled loudly. And they hung out for about an hour.","Rice Field Shelter

Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662009,"I woke at 2:30a and couldn't go to sleep. I tossed and turned. I dozed. And then I started evaluating my progress and just knew that I wasn't going to be able to keep going without eating. And my pack weight wasn't going down because I wasn't eating. So at 7a I called Angel's Rest to discuss where they could pick me up.
At about 7a, my friends the goats returned to harass me. I shouted and whistled and even asked politely for them to leave. I opened the vestibule a bit to see if there was really goats, or if was my delirium. I focused my camera and hollered at them to leave and the buggars just kept walking towards me. They eventually decided I wasn't very good company. I checked the food hang that I had failed at, and saw that it was high enough to keep the goats out.
5.5 miles to Peter's Mt. I had researched the possibilities and figured that would be the case. I had to tell them a time to meet me, so figuring 1 mph with some to spare. I figured 3p. I managed to eat a PayDay bar that had been in my pocket since I left Ironwood. The rest of my day was fueled by glucose tablets.
Every incline was grueling. But there was much beauty to keep me distracted. With 1.3 to my destination, I came to a stream. My feet were so sore from the downhill. I removed boots and socks and soaked my feet for 10 minutes. 30 minute break in all.
I was struggling, but kept pushing forward so I could be early to my pickup. I arrived at 2:30p and dropped my pack, knowing that I wasn't going to pick it back up. I didn't have time to sit down and Hot Tamale arrived in her air conditioned car. She carried my pack for me. When I got out of the van I could barely walk. But she said Shades will be here. I'm so glad to have the chance to meet up with her again.
She too had issues with the goats, more so than my issues. Good to catch up and meet the other hikers.","Mile 651 campsite

Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662013,"Slackpacking 7.2 miles today with a big rise in elevation at the beginning of the hike. I get to see how my Frogg Toggs work with my umbrella. And the best part is a shower and dry bed at the end of the day.
Plan is to hike Sat & Sun. Low Sat night is in the 20s. Then returning to the hostel on Sunday.
Trying to get from Pearisburg to Daleville is a 90 mile stretch with little support and water. I know a slow start will help me in the long game.7.2 miles in 5.25 hours. About 1.4 mph. Previously, I was hitting .7 mph on the inclines. I can do hard things!
Returned to a full shelter. Lots of young ones. All drenched in the spirit of the AT. Call us nerds and we are proud of it. No matter the age, gender or profession, we'll hiked thru the same crap. Some of us stronger. But each encouraging one another and sharing spirits, advice, empathy and comraderie.

Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662014,"Taking a zero day. Laundry, resorting, planning route and resting are on the agenda today. And a trip to DQ and the Mexican restaurantI decided while I was hiking yesterday that I was not ready to hike in the rain, set up my tent and try to figure out how to prevent hypothermia. Not ready to be on an episode of NWL. As you hike and go up in elevation, you can feel the air cool. Today in town it's 42 degrees. I am comfortable with the decision to zero. Tomorrow is forecasted to be sunny and bright going thru the next couple of days.","

Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662015,"Sitting in the sunshine waiting for the 9a shuttle. It was a blessing when they came at 8p last night to change our shuttle time from 7a to 9a. Alarm canceled. I've fueled up with Oatmeal raisin cookies, coffee and diet Pepsi. If I can manage to keep my food supply down to 2-3 days, I will be so much more comfy. Looking forward to walking in the sunshine. Hope to get my camera out for more pictures and videos.
Pack weight is at 26 with 1 liter of water.
Downhill is not necessarily easy. 3.7 miles at 1.5 mph. Stopped at noon as my legs felt shaky and I thought some calories would do a body good. I'm 1/2 thru the days mileage. So a break it is. PB on a wrap and teddy grahms. Reduced my pack weight by 1/4 jar PB
34 degrees at 3200 elevation. Dropping 1000 ft in 1.5 miles. Tough on the knees. Ended up not being too bad. Although I fell twice. Always on a giant step down and my knee buckles and I go down. No bruises or cuts and scrapes. And no one was there to see it happen.
We arrived to our campsite at 3p. We could of hiked farther. But then we would miss the sound of the stream next to us all night. Talk about white noise.
I need to watch a video on how to set up my tent. It certainly is not ready for prime time. But it will fulfill its purpose for the night.
Ramen and broccoli for dinner. Very yummy. 
Good day. 6.6 miles in 4.4 hours 1.375 mph. Need to get out early in the morning as we have 10.4 to go with 3 of them up.
Awesome sauce. After viewing our route tomorrow, we only have 7.5 miles tomorrow. Now I'm sure I will reach my destination by 4p. Life is Good.
I finally got the nerve to try my pee funnel. I can pee like a boy! Incredible!","
