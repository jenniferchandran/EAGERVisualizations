Cloud Toucher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440385,"Reading through the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike Planner, have a lot of work ahead of me. One of my first objective to get in good physical condition. From what I read so far heading south will be difficult and requires a lot of physical strength. I am more sound and round at this point so step one weighing in at 205 and 5'10"" the plan is to get the weight and strength in order. Can't change the height but can work on the weight, will be 175 by this time next year. Goal 1 designated.","Appalachian Trail

Cloud Toucher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440639,"Well I put together a alcohol stove, two beer cans construction. Came out pretty nice even works but is this a reliable way to cook on a through hike such as the AT. I use a canister type stove for years and it's always got the job done. But I am looking to go as light as possible. Any thoughts or experience with alcohol stoves.",,Alcohol Stove,"Jan 04, Sat",0
Cloud Toucher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441605,"Every day is one day closer. I have started making plans on how to get to Maine but I should say how to get to Baxter State Park. Never been much further that New York as far as being in the US. Been to Canada/Quebec back in the 70's but that was a long time ago.  So now I am spending most of my time studying the maps around the state of Maine that are pertinent to the AT. Trail towns, resupply,   fuel, mail drops all the thing I will need along the trail.Been working on my gear and pack weight, this will be fine tune in the next 15 months. Just saying that seems like forever, but I know so well time is not static and it will be here before I know it.Till next time","Appalachian Trail
