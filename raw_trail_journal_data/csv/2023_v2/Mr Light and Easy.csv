Mr Light and Easy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661481,"Yesterday and today I did day hikes continuing to put in miles that I have not done yet. I hope to hike weekends and whenever I can for the year and would like to hike all AT sections to Massachusetts at least. Any sections I cover this year, I will skip next year when I hike my version of the through hike or as I have come to understand it to be called a LASH.Was a beautiful day for a hike rain cleared at 11 and became sunny and mid 60s.Had the scariest moment as I was coming down a small hill I heard a crash above me. I instantly put my hand over my head and dashed forward and to the right. And one foot to my left right in the middle of the trail a tree crashed down. No wind it just fell!",,View Entry,"Apr 01, Sat",0
