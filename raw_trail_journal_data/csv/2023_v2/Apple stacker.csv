Apple stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605275,"I completed most of the Georgia section of the AT. Dicks creek gap to springer mnt. The first day was tough as I ate something that didn’t agree with me the day before and dry heaved a couple of times going up the first mnt and only got 4.5 miles in. I set up my tent at about 4:30pm and crawled in and slept till 7:00 am.it rained off and on all nite with really strong winds. I felt a lot better and hiked to the cheese factory campsite. Good water close and nice protected campsite. No rain that nite. The next day we hiked about9 miles and again camped in the rain. The climbs were the hardest so far, downhills weren’t to bad. We hiked another 8 miles and spent the nite at Mt Crossing jostle really nice place with really good advice. We ran into 2 solo hikers who gave us some reall good tips on cutting down on bulk.We climbed Blood my the next day and made about 10 miles. My legs were starting to get in shape and I didn’t have to stop as often going up. Lots of great views, only day we weren’t fogged in.We camped in the rain again that nite. Next day hiked about 12 miles to hawk mnt shelter, we knew it was supposed to down pour all nite and wanted to be under cover.it rained hard all nite so it was a good call. Left in the mourning in pouring rain and finished the hike to springer at about 2 pm.We took the mandatory pictures and retreated to the springer mnt shelter for a very cold windy nite as our ride wasn’t arriving until the next morning at 9.I will post equipment reviews and what I did and didn’t need.","Dicks creek gap
