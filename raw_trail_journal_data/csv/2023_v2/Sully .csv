Sully ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668081,"""You should get that done. Don’t wait, do it this year if you can.” Those were the words of my doctor during my annual physical in January, 2023 when I mentioned my intention to attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail. She went on, “You’re turning 60 this year... It’s not going to get any easier... Get it done.""  That was the affirmation I was looking for. I began adding up my savings and calculating my expenses. I went over the numbers again and again until I was certain I could afford to do it. Then I took her advice and finally quit my job of 35 years. I will begin a non-traditional flip-flop starting in August.
Before it became my intention it was a dream. The dream began in my teen years when a friend and I started doing backpacking trips together. We became keenly interested in the AT and the idea of thru hiking. But it wasn’t to be, at least not in my twenties when most people take on the challenge. My college years were soon followed by a career job, marriage, house, kids… but not the AT. I suppose I was in my thirties when I lost track of the dream in a blur of long hours at the office, a mortgage, kids soccer games, vacations, holidays, and all the other entrapments of adult life. Now, decades later, the kids are grown and I have the combined fortunes of relatively good health and the means to finance a months long hike. I have found the dream again and it has grown into an intention.
Among my many fortunes is the fact that a number of loved ones are supportive of my idea; My two sons who have heard me talk about the AT for years and who have consistently said ""When are you going to do that Dad?"", my lovely partner, Ms Sully, who wants no part of the actual hiking but is eager to help with travel logistics and with executing mail drops while I am on trail, and my 92 year-old mother who responded, “don’t you think it’s a little late for you to be doing that?” when I told her….and yet she supports me with her interest and other encouragement regardless of her concern. They are among many other friends and family who mostly encourage me to go for it. I am very fortunate indeed!

Sully ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668348,"As my plans to hike the AT have become known by my friends and family, many have offered their support. Encouraging words mean a lot to me, as do the many offers of help with transportation, and other assistance. Some have offered to help by expressing their desire to hike with me for a day. To all of those offering help and encouragement I am truly grateful whether or not the assistance or the hiking together actually happens. It is immensely helpful to me just to know that so many people are supporting this endeavor of mine. 


From reading Trailjournals over the years and from speaking directly with thru hikers, I have learned volumes about the various strategies other hikers have used to complete their hikes and to document their hike in their journals. Of note, I learned from Mule who entered a very interesting journal about his 2022 nobo thru hike., Kidding Right, who wrote an excellent account of her 2022-2023 non-traditional flip flop (the same version of thru hike I am embarking on), and my friend Highlander who completed a 2019 nobo thru hike and trail journal that I found to be very informative. I can only hope to be as clear eyed and entertaining with my journal as these and many others I have followed.

Sully ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668433,"There is a custom among hikers to assume an alias while hiking. This alias is known as a trail name. My trail name “Sully” is obviously not my real name. For online safety reasons I will use only my trail name in my journal. Likewise, whenever possible, I will refer to friends, family, and other hikers by an alias.",,View Entry,"Aug 24, Thu",0
Sully ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668434,"While discussing my upcoming AT hike a friend of mine, Poptart, expressed that he would like to come along for three days if we could start on Friday instead of Sunday. We worked out the logistics and have agreed to make it happen. His wife, Mrs Poptart will drive us to the trailhead on Friday morning and we will hike the northern part of Shenandoah National Park, returning home Sunday night.


Poptart did a section hike in SNP earlier this summer. He completed most of the park but had to get off trail due to a bad rub on his heel.  The section we do this weekend will complete the AT through the park for him. For me, this arrangement allows me to carry only 3 days worth of food. So, my pack will be lighter. It also allows me to test out some of my new gear and assess my shoes before hitting the trail in earnest later next week.  If the plan works I should still be on schedule. ",,View Entry,"Aug 25, Fri",0
Sully ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668438,"Poptart and I were dropped off at the trailhead by Mrs Poptart around 815 am. For this section we are hiking northbound. The trail was moderate at first with several good views of the valley. A nice breeze from the valley side of the ridge kept us comfortable at first but by afternoon the heat was on us and the humidity too. We leapfrogged all day with a young German fellow who was hiking in the same direction as we were. The trail passes Mary’s Rock and then Stony Man peak and then plunges steeply down to Thornton gap. My toes were getting crushed on the long downhill. After the gap it was a moderate uphill for about 1.3 miles to Pass Mountain hut. The German fellow, Michael was at the hut. Fifteen miles with heat and high humidity made for an ambitious first day out. Poptart and Michael slept in the shelter while I slept nearby in my tent  it was uncomfortable at first but a breeze eventually stirred and we all rested well until daylight  (about 630am). 
In the morning, we got up, broke camp, and stepped off before 8am. Michael was first to leave with Poptart and I about 10 minutes behind. Again, we found ourselves leap frogging with Michael all day. Leap frogging is when you pass a hiker going in your same direction only to be passed later by that hiker while you are stopped for a rest, and so on. We did this all the way to Gravel Springs hut (13 miles). My feet were really starting to hurt. I had developed a nasty blister on the bottom of my left foot and my toes were getting crushed on the downhills. I concluded that I need new boots and made plans to get them once the three day hike was over. There were seven hikers at Gravel springs hut and all of us were in tents because everyone had heard about the resident rat in the shelter. I met a few folks going southbound including Mitch (a nice fellow from Arizona) and a flipflopper who goes by the trail name “Last “. Last started at Harpers Ferry in April but got off trail after about a month because he suffered a stress fracture due to hiking too many miles through the rocky Pennsylvania section (note to self….take it easy out there). Last is back on trail now hoping to at least do the sobo part of his flip flop. Michael also stayed at the hut  
On Sunday, we packed up again and did another 13 miles to Rte 522 to make a total of 41 miles hiked in three days. By this time, Michael was like one of our crew. We gave him a ride to a Metro station so he could get into DC where he had plans. Poptart and I returned home. I plan on getting new shoes, cleaning up, and making adjustments to the gear before getting back out later this week to complete the Shenandoah section. All in all a good shakedown hike for me and a good introduction of what to expect. Ms. Sully made a delicious dinner….I ate like a hiker.

Sully ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668445,"This question has been asked so I thought it would be helpful to include a little information about how we navigate on trail. 
The AT is marked along the entire length with paint markings called blazes. The paint markings are white and about 2” wide and 6” tall. Mostly the blazes are on trees but can be on rocks, buildings, fence posts or other objects along the way. Side trails that lead to and from the AT are marked with blue blazes.
 Two blazes with top blaze offset right means trail turns right

two blazes with top blaze offset left means trail turns left

Two blazes vertically stacked means pay close attention, trail crosses a stream, road, or intersecting trailHikers often carry with them other navigational aids. I am carrying a detailed paper map called The AT Guide as well as a mobile phone app called FarOut.",,View Entry,"Aug 28, Mon",0
Sully ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668500,"I’m fairly certain that I wore a size 8.5 shoe about 20 years ago. I know for certain that I have been wearing size 9.5 for at least the past 12 years. Today I am wearing size 10.5. I suppose I will be ok with this.
Today Ms Sully dropped me off at the same trailhead where Poptart and I started out last Friday. We said our goodbyes and I was off. The emotion of finally being out on trail had me ecstatic and a little nervous at the same time. I felt good and the miles seemed to fly by. Before I knew it I had passed Milam gap and was heading up the north side of Hazeltop mountain. I stopped for some lunch before continuing on. At one point I came across a sign that read “caution, wasp nest on trail”. This instinctively made me look down on the trail trying to spot a wasp nest. I walked slowly scanning from side to side when it occurred to me that wasps typically build nests up in a tree. I looked up and there was a large wasp nest right in front of me at head level. I almost walked into it. Maybe the sign should say “watch your head, wasp nest at head level”. Having avoided a disaster I pressed on. 
 Wasp nest at head level
A short distance further I passed a northbound day hiker. He told me that he had just passed a southbound hiker who had told him he had just seen a bobcat in the area. Being a second hand account we must take such a report with some degree of skepticism.  Trail news can be embellished. On the other hand I saw a bobcat in this park back in 2016 so I know they are here. Before moving on I told the northbound day hiker not to be fooled by the sign ahead like I was or he might get smacked on the head by a wasp nest!

Moving on the trail crests over the top of Hazeltop mountain then down into Bearfence gap before ascending and skirting the rocky west side of Bearfence mountain just below the summit. I took a side trail to Bearfence hut with the hope of finding a spring but there was no flow. I opted not to collect water from the stagnant pool and went back up to the AT trail. That was a wasted 1/2 mile effort but I did spot a wild turkey down near the spring. The Lewis Mountain campground was only a mile further and my destination for the night. There are showers here and I was able to buy a cold beer at the camp store.
Todays hike was a relatively easy 12.3 miles with mostly smooth trail and moderate grades.

I Covered a total of 53.8 miles over 5 days. Some days I kept notes of random occurrences, musings, odd thoughts. Whatever came to pass or came to mind. Here is a summary of my stroll through Shenandoah National Park on those 5 days;



Pocosin Cabin. This restored cabin can be rented from the PATC
When large birds beat their wings it makes a distinct whooshing sound. You can hear the friction of wing against air. 
At night when an owl visited my tent site it inquired who was there. I did not answer but rather I held the moment and listened to  the resonant call. Finally departing, the owl beat its wings past my tent as it flew away leaving me to savor the wildness of it.

Stealth site past Hightop hut
I tawt I taw a putty tat. Hiking up Hightop mountain I caught a glimpse of the hind side of an animal just as it disappeared into the undergrowth. I saw a tawny body, a short white tail, and long legs…..like a rabbit. Only this animal was about 30 pounds. Could it have been a bobcat?  No, I must be seeing things…..it must have been a rabbit. Damn big rabbit.

The magic is real! I ascended to the rangers station on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. A line of cars with passengers waiting to get their campsites. The campground was full and I knew it before I arrived.  The ranger asked authoritatively if I had a reservation. “No”, I replied, out of breath, “would you have a spot where a thru hiker could pitch a tent for the night?” The ranger sized me up, “ take a load off sir, I’ll figure something out.  I did and a few minutes later the ranger came out of the station and directed me to put my pack in the golf cart. We rode together. He told me that he had thru hiked the AT in 1974. He said he likes the thru hikers and tries to accommodate them. He took me to a tent site and told me where to set up. No charge. I thanked him for the kindness. The magic is real! This arrangement led to a shower and a hot meal.


Lone oak in meadow at top of a mountain. Notice the moon. Bear goes missing News on the trail travels at the speed of hikers. Still, the news that Bear wandered off in the middle of the night spread up and down the trail by the end of the day. Bear is a 75 year-old hiker who must have gotten disoriented in the dark on his way to the privy and never made it back to his tent. By dawn his campmates noticed his absence while all his gear remained at Pinefield hut. The next day a search and rescue party was combing the area. Fortunately, Bear was found alive near Ivy Creek but not until he spent 2.5 days wandering alone in the wilderness.

This section of trail is 76.9 miles long and includes the Three Ridges Wilderness and The Priest Wilderness areas both within the George Washington National Forest. I traversed this section over 6 days Sept 5 through Sept 10.
News and happenings from the trail;
The Priest. Coming southbound through the Shenandoah’s is a relatively gentle hiking experience. As soon as one hikes out of Shenandoah National park and continues further south on the AT, it becomes clear that the moderate trail gives way to a more mountainous terrain. The trail becomes less forgiving. The climbs are steeper and longer, the woods are bigger and far more lonely, the trail signage is less frequent, and the AT shelters have fewer amenities. This becomes painfully evident on The Priest Mountain. There is nothing in the Shenandoah’s that compares to the Priest for a southbound hiker in terms of steepness and length of climb…..Nothing is even close. Tradition among hikers is to visit The Priest shelter near the top of the mountain and write down all of one’s trail sins in the shelter guest book as a form of confession. For me, my confessions were made and my penance was paid on the long, exhausting slog up the mountain.  I thought it would never end. All told it took me 3.5 hours to climb the over 3000 feet of vertical ascent that this mountain presents. I skipped the confessional at the top, my trail sins having been spat out and my penance doled out along the arduous climb. Once I reached the top I pressed on to Spy Rock Junction where I pitched in a grassy spot, washed, fed myself, hung a bear bag, and collapsed into my tent just as a thunderstorm rolled through. The next morning I was able to do a quick ascent of Spy Rock to have breakfast with a sunrise view. 
A very unpleasant experience. Yellow jackets build nests in holes in the ground. I have seen several yellow jacket nests along the trail in both the Three Ridges and Priest Wilderness areas.  As I ascended into the Three Ridges Wilderness on Sept 6 I found myself suddenly being attacked by a swarm of yellow jackets. Realizing the situation I had to quickly run up the steep rocky section to get away from the swarm. Fortunately I did not fall.  I did manage to put distance between me and the swarm but the bees won. I received six stings mostly on my legs. I tend to have a bad swelling reaction to bee stings so I took two Benadryl tablets right away to suppress the allergic reaction. The Benadryl worked well to keep the swelling to a minimum. For the next several days the stings were very itchy but I was able to continue with my hike. I suppose I was lucky, it could have been much worse.

Forrest Gump is running around in these woods! I ran into Forrest….for the second time. The first time I was sweating it out on my hike up The Priest mountain and this lean, older trail runner was coming down the trail. We paused just long enough to confirm that each of us were OK (I was seriously out of breath).  The second time was 2 days later when I ran into him along Brown Mountain Creek about 20 miles south of The Priest. We chatted for a good spell and we exchanged trail names. He told me he was “Forrest”…..”as in Run Forrest!” Then he offered me some gu (electrolyte). I declined with the reasoning that I was already carrying too much food. 


one of many wooden suspension bridges in the area. It’s very quiet on the trail. I have been leap frogging the same few hikers this past week. Last, Cutoff, and Insect are all southbound and all within a day’s hike of me more or less. One will get ahead of me then get off trail for a resupply in a nearby town. As a result , I then pass them and get ahead only to be repositioned in the group when I get off trail or take a long break allowing them to catch up and pass. Also in my orbit and going south are Huckleberry and his dog Wyatt, Loon and her dog Duke and three young sobos one of whom goes by the name Doubledub. It’s comforting to meet these other hikers and to know they are in my vicinity.
